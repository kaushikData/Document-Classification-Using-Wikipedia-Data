      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4102">{{About|the physiological principle|the finance term|All or none|the mathematical term|Zero–one law}}

The '''all-or-none law''' is the principle that the strength by which a [[nerve]] or [[Skeletal striated muscle|muscle fibre]] responds to a stimulus is independent of the strength of the stimulus. If that stimulus exceeds the [[threshold potential]], the nerve or muscle fibre will give a complete response; otherwise, there is no response. 

It was first established by the American physiologist [[Henry Pickering Bowditch]] in 1871 for the [[Muscle contraction|contraction]] of [[Cardiac muscle|heart muscle]]. According to him, describing the relation of response to stimulus,&lt;blockquote&gt;““An induction shock produces a contraction or fails to do so according to its strength; if it does so at all, it produces the greatest contraction that can be produced by any strength of stimulus in the condition of the muscle at the time.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;The individual fibres of both [[skeletal muscle]] and nerve respond to stimulation according to the all-or-none principle.&lt;ref&gt;Cannon, Walter B. ''Biographical Memoir, Henry Pickering Bowditch, 1840–1911''. Washington, D.C.: [[National Academy of Sciences]], Volume xvii, eighth memoir. 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship between stimulus and response==
The magnitude of the [[action potential]] set up in any single [[nerve fibre]] is independent of the strength of the exciting stimulus, provided the latter is adequate. An [[Electrical muscle stimulation|electrical stimulus]] below threshold strength fails to elicit a propagated spike potential. If it is of threshold strength or over, a spike (a nervous impulse) of maximum magnitude is set up. Either the single fibre does not respond with spike production, or it responds to the utmost of its ability under the conditions at the moment. This property of the single nerve fibre is termed the all-or-none relationship. This relationship holds only for the unit of [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]; for [[nervous tissue]] the unit is the [[nerve cell]], for [[skeletal muscle]] the unit is the individual muscle fiber and for the heart the unit is the entire [[Atrium (heart)|auricles]] or the entire [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]s.

Stimuli too weak to produce a spike do, however, set up a local [[Electrotonic potential|electrotonus]], the magnitude of the electronic potential progressively increasing with the strength of the stimulus, until a spike is generated. This demonstrates the all-or-none relationship in spike production.

The above account deals with the response of a single nerve fibre. If a [[Sympathetic trunk|nerve trunk]] is stimulated, then as the exciting stimulus is progressively increased above a threshold, a larger number of fibres respond. The minimal effective (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;[[Threshold potential|threshold]]) stimulus is adequate only for fibres of high excitability, but a stronger stimulus excites all the nerve fibres. Increasing the stimulus further does increase the response of whole nerve.

[[Cardiac muscle|Heart muscle]] is excitable, i.e., it responds to external stimuli by [[Muscle contraction|contracting]]. If the external stimulus is too weak, no response is obtained; if the stimulus is adequate, the heart responds to the best of its ability. Accordingly, the [[Atrium (heart)|auricles]] or [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]s behave as a single unit, so that an adequate stimulus normally produces a full contraction of either the auricles or ventricles. The force of the contraction obtained depends on the state in which the muscles fibres find themselves. In the case of [[muscle fibre]]s, the individual muscle fibre does not respond at all if the stimulus is too weak. However, it responds maximally when the stimulus rises to threshold. The contraction is not increased if the stimulus strength is further raised. Stronger stimuli bring more muscle fibres into action and thus the tension of a muscle increases as the strength of the stimulus applied to it rises.

'''Antinomy''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἀντί, ''antí'', "against, in opposition to", and νόμος, ''nómos'', "law") refers to a real or apparent mutual incompatibility of two laws.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/antinomy Antinomy], Encyclopædia Britannica Online, accessed 8/27/2016&lt;/ref&gt; It is a term used in [[logic]] and [[epistemology]], particularly in the philosophy of [[Kant]].

There are many examples of antinomy. A self-contradictory phrase such as "There is no absolute truth" can be considered an antinomy because this statement is suggesting in itself to be an absolute truth, and therefore denies itself any truth in its statement. A [[paradox]] such as "[[this sentence is false]]" can also be considered to be an antinomy; for the sentence to be true, it must be false, and vice versa.

==Kant's use==
{{see|Kant's antinomies}}
The term acquired a special significance in the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804), who used it to describe the equally rational but contradictory results of applying to the universe of pure thought the categories or criteria of reason that are proper to the universe of sensible perception or [[experience]] (phenomena).&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Antinomy|volume=2|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empirical]] reason cannot here play the role of establishing rational truths because it goes beyond possible experience and is applied to the sphere of that which [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcends]] it.

For Kant there are [[Kant's antinomies|four antinomies]],&lt;ref&gt;S. Al-Azm, The Origins of Kant's Argument in the Antinomies, Oxford University Press 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Grier, Kant's Doctrine of Transcendental Illusion, Cambridge University Press 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Grier, "The Logic of Illusion and the Antinomies," in Bird (ed.), Blackwell, Oxford 2006, pp. 192-207.&lt;/ref&gt; connected with:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/antinomy|title=antinomy {{!}} philosophy|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the limitation of the universe in respect to [[space]] and [[time]]
*the theory that the whole consists of indivisible [[atom]]s (whereas, in fact, none such exist)
*the problem of [[free will]] in relation to universal [[causality]]
*the existence of a universal being&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In each antinomy, a thesis is contradicted by an antithesis. For example: in the first antinomy, Kant proves the thesis that time must have a beginning by showing that if time had no beginning, then an infinity would have elapsed up until the present moment. This is a manifest contradiction because infinity cannot, by definition, be completed by "successive synthesis"—yet just such a finalizing synthesis would be required by the view that time is infinite; so the thesis is proven. Then he proves the antithesis, that time has no beginning, by showing that if time had a beginning, then there must have been "empty time" out of which time arose. This is incoherent (for Kant) for the following reason: Since, necessarily, no time elapses in this pretemporal void, then there could be no alteration, and therefore nothing (including time) would ever come to be: so the antithesis is proven. Reason makes equal claim to each proof, since they are both correct, so the question of the limits of time must be regarded as meaningless.

This was part of Kant's critical program of determining limits to [[science]] and philosophical inquiry. These contradictions are inherent in reason when it is applied to the world as it is in itself, independently of any perception of it (this has to do with the distinction between [[phenomena]] and [[noumena]]). Kant's goal in his critical philosophy was to identify what claims are and are not justified, and the antinomies are a particularly illustrative example of his larger project.

==Marx's use==

Kant is not the only philosopher to employ the term, however. Another famous use of antinomy is by Karl Marx, in Capital Volume One, in the chapter entitled 'The Working Day'. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlwerke.de/me/me23/me23_245.htm], K. Marx. Das Kapital &lt;/ref&gt; On Marx's account, capitalist production sustains 'the assertion of a right to an unlimited working day, and the assertion of a right to a limited working day, both with equal justification'. &lt;ref&gt;J. Furner, Marx on Capitalism: The Interaction-Recognition-Antinomy Thesis, Brill Press 2018, p.405.&lt;/ref&gt; Furner emphasizes that the thesis and antithesis of this antinomy are not contradictory opposites, but rather 'consist in the assertion of rights to states of affairs that are contradictory opposites'. &lt;ref&gt;J. Furner, Marx on Capitalism: The Interaction-Recognition-Antinomy Thesis, Brill Press 2018, p.125.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2759">'''Basic goodness''' is a term coined by Tibetan spiritual teacher [[Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche]] and is a core concept in his [[terma (religion)|terma]]. It is used both to discuss the experience of reality and also basic human [[virtue]].

In his 1980 Seminary he associates this term with both absolute [[bodhicitta]] and specifically the Tibetan term kun.gzhi.ngang.lugs.kyi.dge.ba which comes from the [[Kadam (Tibetan Buddhism)|Kadam]] tradition and refers to the natural virtues of the kunshi or [[alaya]]. Specifically he described three virtues: ''unborn'' meaning non-manufactured; ''nondwelling'' meaning that it cannot be pinned down, and ''free from pigeonholing'' meaning that it is beyond conceptual reference points.&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa (1980) Mayahana Seminary Transcript, pgs 91-94&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1981 Seminary he described it as also referring to personal wholesomeness and dedication to others.&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa (1981) Mayahana Seminary Transcript, pg 89&lt;/ref&gt;

Melvin McLeod explains the term with ''basic'' indicating the primordial, self-existing nature and ''goodness'' indicating a faultless aspect.&lt;ref&gt;Mindful politics: a Buddhist guide to making the world a better place By Melvin McLeod; pp92-93&lt;/ref&gt; John Miller associated the term with [[Buddha-nature]].&lt;ref&gt;The holistic curriculum By John P. Miller; p29&lt;/ref&gt;

Trungpa Rinpoche's son, Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche, expressed the relationship between basic goodness and enlightened society in these words: "In essence, the emphasis of the Buddhist path is to help us attain enlightenment, and the emphasis of the Shambhala path is to help us create and maintain a good society. When we put these two together, we have the Shambhalian Buddhist view of enlightened society. Thus the two paths work in tandem, not in competition."

Descendants of the earliest English colonists, such as those who came to America on the ''[[Mayflower]]'' or the ''[[Arbella]]'', are often considered to be the most representative of the Boston Brahmins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenwood|first=Andrew|title=An Introduction to the Unitarian and Universalist Traditions |page=LX|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OuGQuC4bcJgC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=Boston+Brahmin+origins+Britain&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwA2oVChMItsKBhPDJxwIVITrbCh0iwgmp#v=onepage&amp;q=Boston%20Brahmin%20origins%20Britain&amp;f=false|date=11 August 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined by the physician and writer [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]], in an 1860 article in the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Wendell Holmes, "The Brahmin Caste of New England", ''The Atlantic Monthly'', Volume 5, Issue 27, Chapter 1 (1860). The series of articles that this article was part of eventually became his novel ''[[Elsie Venner]]'', and the first chapter of that novel was about the Brahmin caste.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[Brahmin]]'' refers to the highest ranking caste of people in the traditional Hindu [[caste system in India]]. In the United States, it has been applied to the old, wealthy [[New England]] families of British [[Protestant]] origin which were influential in the development of American institutions and culture.

The term effectively underscores the strong conviction of the New England gentry that they were a people set apart by destiny to guide the American experiment as their ancestors had played a leading role in founding it. The term also illustrates the erudite and exclusive nature of the New England gentry as perceived by outsiders, and may also refer to their interest in Eastern religions, fostered perhaps by the impact in the 19th century of the [[transcendentalist]] writings of New England literary icons such as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Walt Whitman]], and the enlightened appeal of [[Universalist Unitarian]] movements of the same period.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Benjamin Crowinshield (captain).jpg|thumb|Typical dress of the Boston elite{{When|date=June 2017}}]]
The nature of the Brahmins is hinted at by the doggerel "Boston Toast" by [[College of the Holy Cross|Holy Cross]] alumnus [[John Collins Bossidy]]:
:And this is good old Boston,
:The home of the [[Boston baked beans|bean]] and the [[Sacred Cod|cod]],
:Where the [[Lowell family|Lowells]] talk only to [[Cabot family|Cabots]],
:And the Cabots talk only to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Andrews, Robert (ed.) |title=Famous Lines: A Columbia Dictionary of Familiar Quotations |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=1996 |isbn=0-231-10218-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0_P0m01GclYC&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;pg=PA163#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Giving Good Weight |author=McPhee, John |page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While some 19th-century Brahmin families of large fortune were of bourgeois origin, still fewer were of a somewhat aristocratic origin. The new families were often the first to seek, in typically British fashion, suitable marriage alliances with those old aristocratic New England families that were descended from landowners in England to elevate and cement their social standing. The Winthrops, Dudleys, Saltonstalls, Winslows, and Lymans (descended from English magistrates, gentry, and aristocracy) were, by and large, happy with this arrangement. All of Boston's "Brahmin elite", therefore, maintained the received culture of the old English gentry, including cultivating the personal excellence that they imagined maintained the distinction between gentlemen and freemen, and between ladies and women. They saw it as their duty to maintain what they defined as high standards of excellence, duty, and restraint. Cultivated, urbane, and dignified, a Boston Brahmin was supposed to be the very essence of enlightened [[aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Story, ''Harvard and the Boston Upper Class: The Forging of an Aristocracy, 1800–1870'' (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Goodman, "Ethics and Enterprise: The Values of a Boston Elite, 1800–1860", ''American Quarterly'', Sept 1966, Vol. 18 Issue 3, pp 437–451.&lt;/ref&gt; The ideal Brahmin was not only wealthy, but displayed what was considered suitable personal virtues and character traits.

The Brahmin was expected to maintain the customary English reserve in his dress, manner, and deportment, cultivate the arts, support charities such as hospitals and colleges, and assume the role of community leader.&lt;ref&gt;Peter S. Field [https://books.google.com/books?id=HXHbEWJacwwC Ralph Waldo Emerson: The Making of a Democratic Intellectual] Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003. {{ISBN|0847688429}}. {{ISBN|978-0847688425}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}} Although the ideal called on him to transcend commonplace business values, in practice many found the thrill of economic success quite attractive. The Brahmins warned each other against [[avarice]] and insisted upon personal responsibility. Scandal and divorce were unacceptable. The total system was buttressed by the strong extended family ties present in Boston society. Young men attended the same prep schools, colleges, and private clubs,&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Story, "Harvard Students, the Boston Elite, and the New England Preparatory System, 1800–1870", ''History of Education Quarterly'', Fall 1975, Vol. 15 Issue 3, pp 281–298.&lt;/ref&gt; and heirs married heiresses. Family not only served as an economic asset, but also as a means of moral restraint. Most belonged to the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] or [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] churches, although some were [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]] or [[Methodism|Methodists]]. Politically they were successively [[Federalist Party|Federalists]], [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]], and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]. They were marked by their manners and once distinctive elocution, the [[Boston Brahmin accent]], a version of the New England accent. Their distinctive Anglo-American manner of dress has been much imitated and is the foundation of the style now informally known as [[preppy]]. Many of the Brahmin families trace their ancestry back to the original 17th- and 18th-century colonial ruling class consisting of Massachusetts governors and magistrates, Harvard presidents, distinguished clergy and fellows of the [[Royal Society of London]] (a leading scientific body), while others entered New England aristocratic society during the 19th century with their profits from commerce and trade, often marrying into established Brahmin families.

'''''Christian Morals'''''  is a prose work written by the physician [[Sir Thomas Browne]] as advice for his eldest children. It was published posthumously in 1716 and consists, as its title implies, of meditations upon [[Christian]] values and conduct. 

The work is divided into three sections with many of the numbered  paragraphs standing-alone as text, with unique and startling imagery involving optics, perspective and appearance. A work of a lifetime's study and understanding of the human condition, in psychological terms, Browne's last major work may be considered as advice on obtaining individuation and self-realization as much as Christian virtue.

Stylistically, it displays some of the best and worst excesses of Browne's at times labyrinthine and meandering baroque style, often involving [[Parallelism (grammar)|parallelism]]s in its sentence construction.  

''Christian Morals'' was edited by [[Samuel Johnson]] in 1756; Johnson prefaced his edition with a biography of Browne. His latter prose imitated aspects of Browne's late prose-style.

A '''Christmas gift''' or '''Christmas present''' is a [[gift]] given in celebration of [[Christmas]]. Christmas gifts are often exchanged on December 25.

==History==
[[File:C. Dreisbach's Sons (3093736478).jpg|thumb|Christmas advertising mentioning gifts from c. 1900]]
[[File:StateLibQld 2 105888 Red Cross workers packing Christmas presents for the Fighting Forces during World War II, October 1942.jpg|thumb|Red Cross workers packing Christmas presents for the Fighting Forces during World War II, October 1942]]
The tradition of [[Gift|gift-giving]] is an old one, but it became associated with [[Christmas]] more recently. It is a relic of a pagan custom, namely, the [[winter solstice]] which in Europe [[December solstice|occurs in December]]. This was celebrated in [[ancient Rome]] with gift-giving during the [[Saturnalia]] holiday, which took place that month.&lt;ref name="Berking1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berking|first=Helmuth|title=Sociology of Giving|date=March 30, 1999|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-0-85702-613-2|page=14|quote=}}&lt;!--|accessdate=December 24, 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Christianity]] became increasingly widespread in the Roman lands, the custom of gift-giving continued.&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{cite book|author=Collins, Ace|title=Stories Behind the Great Traditions of Christmas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mo8vgZoROl8C&amp;pg=PT88|date=April 20, 2010|accessdate=April 10, 2012|publisher=Zondervan|pages=96-100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the year 336 AD the date of December 25 appears to have become established as the day of Jesus's birth, and the tradition of gift-giving was reinterpreted and tied to the story of [[three Magi]] giving gifts to [[baby Jesus]]; together with another story, that of [[Santa Claus]] based on the historical figure of [[Saint Nicholas]], a fourth-century Greek bishop and gift-giver, it slowly became a part of Christmas celebrations.&lt;ref name="Berking1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt; 

Some early Christian rulers, however, interpreted this story as indications that it should be their subjects who should give gifts to their superiors, and insisted on tributes and tithes during that period. This changed around the turn of the millennium following the popularity of the [[Good King Wenceslas]] story based on the life of another historical person claimed to be a gift-giver, [[Saint Wenceslaus]].&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt; Christmas gift-giving to superiors became less common, and around the time of the [[Protestant Reformation]], customs of gift-giving to children became increasingly widespread in Europe.&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt; The custom spread to the United States around the 19th century. This also coincided with the desire of some elites to reduce the rowdiness of adult Christmas celebrations, which in some places were tied to begging, as "bands of young men, often rowdy, would "wassail" from home to home and demand handouts from the gentry". Another related aspect was the growing desire by parents to keep children at home, away from the "corrupting" influence of the urban streets.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/12/why-people-give-christmas-gifts/421908/|title=Why Do Children Get Presents on Christmas Anyway?|last=Ringel|first=Paul|work=The Atlantic|access-date=December 4, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/World/2013/1221/Christmas-How-did-gift-giving-and-caroling-get-started|title=Christmas: How did gift-giving and caroling get started?|date=December 21, 2013|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=December 4, 2017|issn=0882-7729}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Another relatively recent change concerned the time of Christmas gift-giving. For many centuries, gift-giving took place on December 6 around [[Saint Nicholas Day]] or in early January after [[New Year's Eve]].&lt;ref name="Collins" /&gt; The popularity of this custom grew after the positive reception of the 1823 poem ''[[The Night Before Christmas]]'' and the 1843 novella ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''.&lt;ref name="Collins" /&gt; By the end of the 19th century, [[Christmas Eve]] replaced early December or January dates as the most common date for gift-giving in the [[Western culture]].&lt;ref name="Collins" /&gt; It is custom for one to open a single gift on the evening of Christmas Eve.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

==Economic impact==
[[File:HK Kln Bay Telford Plaza mall Xmas cart Reindeer decor Nov-2015 DSC.JPG|thumb|[[Christmas decorations]], often featuring Christmas gifts, abound in many shopping malls]]
{{main|Economics of Christmas}}
The tradition was also embraced by retailers, for whom the weeks and, eventually, the entire month before Christmas became a very profitable period.&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt; Around the turn of the 20th century retailers started directing marketing efforts at children in the hopes that they would entice the parents to buy more goods.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the early 2000s it was estimated that shoppers in the U.S. alone spend over $4 billion each day during the Christmas shopping season, with an average individual spending over $1,000 on gifts.&lt;ref name="Collins" /&gt; 

There are concerns that gift-giving during Christmas is too commercial. Seventy percent of respondents to an online survey of 13,576 people in 14 European countries in 2016 said that too much attention is put on spending during the Christmas period, 42% said they felt forced to spend more at Christmas, and 10% borrowed money to be able to afford the gifts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ing.com/Newsroom/All-news/The-truth-about-unwanted-Christmas-gifts.htm|title=The truth about unwanted Christmas gifts|last=ING.com|date=December 1, 2016|work=ING.com|access-date=December 1, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Joel Waldfogel]]&amp;nbsp;noted that because of the mismatch between what the giftee values the gift and the value paid for by the giver, the gifts lose between 10% to one-third of their value; he calls it the "deadweight loss of Christmas".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/new-money/2016/12/21/14032662/christmas-gift-giving-wasteful|title=The economic case against Christmas presents|work=Vox|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to gifts often being returned, sold, or re-gifted. In the 2016 European online survey, 15% of respondents were unhappy about their gifts and 10% could not remember what they had received. Twenty-five percent of respondents said they had re-gifted their presents to someone else, 14% sold the items, 10% tried to return them to the store, and 5% returned the gift to the giver.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Seniors were more likely to send their unwanted presents to charity, while those aged 25 to 34 "simply threw them away".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Gifts that are least likely to be appreciated rely on personal tastes, and include items like perfumes and cosmetics, ornaments, and clothing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Collider''''' (sometimes referred as '''''Collider World''''') is a 2013 Irish-Portuguese [[International co-production|co-produced]] [[Drama film|drama]]/[[Science fiction film|science fiction]] film distributed by beActive Entertainment. The film acts as the core for a [[Transmedia storytelling|transmedia project]] developed for [[Multi-platform|various platforms]].

The world premiere was scheduled for 10 January 2014, taking place in [[Dublin]].

==Plot==
The [[Large Hadron Collider]] research at [[CERN]] was on the verge of a breakthrough in regards to [[black holes]]. Scientists believed that they would be able to control the micro black holes once created but Peter Ansay, a young genius in quantum physics thought differently. His report brought up astounding conclusions that the current research on the radiation phenomenon was inaccurate and that if they were actually able to create these black holes, the level of radiation would be so significantly lower than anticipated that they would literally implode in on themselves, taking all surrounding matter with them.

Depending on the exact level of radiation it could be catastrophic. Peter's report was rejected by CERN and his credibility as a scientist was destroyed. On 23 September 2012, Peter breaks into the CERN laboratories to gain access to the Collider and sabotage it preventing any future experiments. But something goes wrong in a way that Peter couldn't have predicted, and he is transported to 2018 by a [[wormhole]] to a world destroyed by [[natural disasters]] and at war with the Unknown. He wakes up in a strangely familiar place, convinced he's somehow been there before. He is now in the future, 2018, and "trapped" inside what seems to be a hotel.

Outside, the atmosphere is unlivable and anyone who ventures out disappears in the shadows, taken by the Unknown. What Peter soon realises is that he is not alone. Five total strangers from different times and places are also in the hotel with him, but unlike him they know nothing about the future or how they got there. Peter keeps getting flashes of memory and a sense of [[déjà vu]] linked to the future. If he's right then he has just 36 hours to figure out a way to get to CERN, reverse the wormhole and prevent the apocalypse because when the clock runs out so does Earth's existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colliderworld.com/en/film.php|title=Film|work=beActive Entertainment|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tie-in material and media==
Prior to the film's development, ''Collider'' started as an [[Interactive movie|interactive]] [[Cross-platform|multi-platform]] project distributed by beActive Entertainment that combines [[comic book]] series alongside a [[graphic novel]], two mobile video games for Android devices [[Web series|webisodes]] and [[Social media|online presence]].

===Comics===
A 6-issue [[comic book series]] alongside a [[graphic novel]] were written by Mike Garley and illustrated by R H Stewart, Gareth Gowran, Jack Tempest, Will Pickering and Martin Simmonds. The comics are available as on [[iTunes]] and [[Google Play]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/collider-comics/id511991947?mt=8 ''Collider'' Comics on iTunes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pt.beactive.collidercomics&amp;hl=en ''Collider'' Comics on Google play]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the comics, a graphic novel is available on [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iBookstore]], and on [[Paperback|paperback edition]] in major comic stores around Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/collider-graphic-novel/id530537951?mt=11 ''Collider'' Graphic Novel on iTunes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0086WCIUE ''Collider'' Graphic Novel on Amazon]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Games===
Two [[mobile games]] have been available for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platforms.

''Collider Quest'' is the first game in the franchise. This game is about collecting items, solving puzzles and testing memory through multiple levels with increasing difficulty.

The game was released in the Summer of 2012, and is available in the [[iOS App Store]] and [[Google Play]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/collider-quest/id524690072?mt=8 ''Collider Quest'' on the App Store]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pt.beactive.colliderquest ''Collider Quest'' on Google Play]&lt;/ref&gt; had also been available on Facebook.

''Collider Code Breaker'' is the second game in the franchise and is available exclusively on [[iOS]] devices. The game follows Luke Spencer on disarming every bomb by cracking their code.&lt;ref&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/collider-code-breaker/id647989978 ''Collider Code Breaker'' on the App Store]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital series===
An 8-episode digital series that acts as prequel to the film was developed in January 2012 for YouTube and [[SAPO (company)|SAPO]], gaining more than 1 million viewers. The series was subsequently broadcast on Portuguese television channel [[SIC Radical]].

The series was shot in [[Lisbon]] and was written by Catriona Scott and Nuno Bernardo, with Bernardo being the director and Iain Robertson reprising his role as Peter Ansay from the film.

{{Expert-subject|philosophy|WikiProject|talk=Major inadequacies -- For the intrepid expert|reason=the article does not provide an adequate portrayal of the philosophical literature on this issue|date=March 2015}}
{{one source|talk=Single source|date=June 2017}}

In [[epistemology]], '''criteria of truth''' (or '''tests of truth''') are standards and rules used to judge the accuracy of statements and claims. They are tools of verification. Understanding a [[philosophy]]'s criteria of [[truth]] is fundamental to a clear evaluation of that philosophy. This necessity is driven by the varying, and conflicting, claims of different philosophies. The rules of [[logic]] have no ability to distinguish truth on their own. An individual must determine what standards distinguish truth from [[Falsity|falsehood]]. Not all criteria are equally valid. Some standards are sufficient, while others are questionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sahakian|first=William|author2=Mabel Lewis Sahakian|year=1993|title= Ideas of the Great Philosophers|publisher=Barnes and Noble|isbn=1-56619-271-4|pages=3&amp;ndash;4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criteria listed represent those most commonly used by scholars and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Dolhenty states there seem to be only three functional, effective tests of truth. He lists these as the correspondence, coherence and pragmatic [[theories of truth]].&lt;ref name="dolhenty"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themoralliberal.com/theradicalacademy/2011/08/17/truth-and-certainty/ |title=Truth and Certainty |accessdate=2007-10-31 |last=Dolhenty |first=Jonathan |work= The Problem of Knowledge: A brief introduction to epistemology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authority==
{{See also|Appeal to authority}}
The opinions of those with significant experience, highly trained or possessing an advanced degree are often considered a form of [[logical argument|proof]]. Their [[knowledge]] and familiarity within a given field or area of knowledge command respect and allow their statements to be criteria of truth. A person may not simply declare themselves an authority, but rather must be properly qualified. Despite the wide respect given to [[expert testimony]], it is not an infallible criterion. For example, multiple authorities may conflict in their claims and conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', pp. 8&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coherence==
{{See also|Coherence theory of truth}}
Coherence refers to a consistent and overarching explanation for all facts. To be coherent, all pertinent facts must be arranged in a consistent and cohesive fashion as an integrated whole. The theory that most effectively reconciles all facts in this fashion may be considered most likely to be true. Coherence is the most potentially effective test of truth because it most adequately addresses all elements. The main limitation lies not in the standard, but in the [[fallibility|human inability]] to acquire all facts of an experience. Only an [[omniscient]] mind could be aware of all of the relevant information. A scholar must accept this limitation and accept as true the most coherent explanation for the available facts. Coherence is difficult to dispute as a criterion of truth, since arguing against coherence is validating incoherence, which is inherently illogical.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', pp. 10&amp;ndash;11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consensus gentium==
{{See also|Argumentum ad populum}}
Some view opinions held by all people to be valid criteria of truth. According to ''consensus gentium'', the universal consent of all mankind, all humans holding a distinct belief proves it is true. There is some value in the criterion if it means innate truth, such as the laws of logic and [[mathematics]]. If it merely means agreement, as in a unanimous vote, its value is questionable. For example, general assent once held the [[flat earth|earth was flat]] and that the [[geocentricism|sun revolved about the earth]].&lt;ref name=sahakian1993p7&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consistency (mere)==
Mere [[Consistency proof|consistency]] is when correct statements do not contradict, but are not necessarily related. Accordingly, an individual is consistent if he does not contradict himself. It is inadequate as a criterion because it treats facts in an isolated fashion without true cohesion and integration; nevertheless it remains a [[necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary condition]] for the truth of any argument, owing to the [[law of noncontradiction]]. The value of a proof largely lies in its ability to reconcile individual facts into a coherent whole.&lt;ref name=sahakian1993p10&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consistency (strict)==
Strict consistency is when claims are connected in such a fashion that one statement follows from another. [[Formal system|Formal logic]] and mathematical rules are examples of rigorous consistency. An example would be: [[multiple modus ponens|if all As are Bs and all Bs are Cs, then all As are Cs]]. While this standard is of high value, it is limited. For example, the premises are ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' (or self-apparent), requiring another test of truth to employ this criterion. Additionally, strict consistency may produce results lacking coherence and completeness. While a philosophical system may demonstrate rigorous consistency with the facts it considers, all facts must be taken into consideration for an adequate criterion of truth, regardless of their detriment to any given system.&lt;ref name=sahakian1993p10/&gt;

==Correspondence==
{{See also|Correspondence theory of truth}}
{{See also|Scientific method}}
Correspondence is quite simply when a claim corresponds with its object. For example, the claim that the White House is in Washington, D.C. is true, if the White House is actually located in Washington. Correspondence is held by many philosophers to be the most valid of the criteria of truth. An idea that corresponds to its object is indeed true, but determining if the correspondence is perfect requires additional tests of truth. This indicates that correspondence is a perfectly valid ''definition'' of truth, but is not of itself a valid criterion of truth. An additional test beyond this "definition" is required to determine the precise degree of similarity between what is posited and what exists in [[objective reality]].&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Custom==
Most people consciously or unknowingly employ [[Norm (sociology)|custom]] as a criterion of truth, based on the assumption that doing what is customary will prevent error. It is particularly applied in the determination of moral truth and reflected in the statement "when in Rome, do as the Romans do". People stick closely to the principle of custom when they use common vernacular, wear common fashions and so forth; essentially, when they do what is [[Mainstream (terminology)|popular]]. Custom is not considered a serious, or valid, test of truth. For example, public opinion polls do not determine truth.&lt;ref name=sahakian1993p4&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emotions==
Many people allow feelings to determine judgment, often in the face of contrary evidence or without even attempting to collect evidence and facts. They are implicitly accepting [[emotions]] as a criterion of truth. Most people will admit that feelings are not an adequate test for truth. For example, a seasoned businessman will put aside his emotions and search for the best available facts when making an investment. Similarly, scholars are trained to put aside such [[Qualia|subjective]] judgments when evaluating knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Emotions are real, however, and thus must be considered within any social scientific system of coherence.

==Instinct==
The existence of distinct [[instinct]]s has long been debated. Proponents of instinct argue that we eat because of hunger, drink because of thirst, and so forth. Some have even argued for the existence of God based on this criterion, arguing that the object of every instinct has a referent in reality. The counterpoint of hunger is food; for thirst it is liquid; for the sex drive it is a mate. Instincts are not accepted as a reliable test because they are most often indistinct, variant and difficult to define. Additionally, universal instincts are so few that they offer little to the greater body of philosophy as a criterion.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', pp. 5&amp;ndash;6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intuition==
[[Intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]] is an assumed truth with an unknown, or possibly unexamined, source. It is a judgment that is not dependent on a [[Rationality|rational]] examination of the facts. It is usually experienced as a sudden sensation and/or rush of thoughts that feel "right". Many persons experience intuitive epiphanies which later prove to be true. Scholars have sometimes come upon valid theories and proofs while daydreaming or otherwise mentally occupied with something bearing no apparent relationship to the truth they seek to reveal. Intuition is at best a source for truths, rather than a criterion with which to evaluate them. Intuitive knowledge requires testing by means of other criteria of truth in order to confirm its accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Majority rule==
[[Majority rule]] is a statistical method of accepting assertions and proposals. In [[democracy|democratic systems]], majority rule is used to determine group decisions, particularly those relating to personal [[morality]] and [[social behavior]]. Some systems divided into several oppositional factions may depend on mere [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]]. While majority rule may make for a good democratic system, it is a poor determinant of truth, subject to the criticisms of the broad version of ''[[consensus gentium]]''.&lt;ref name=sahakian1993p7/&gt;

==Naïve realism==
[[Naïve realism]] posits that only that which is directly observable by the [[human senses]] is true. First-hand observation determines the truth or falsity of a given statement. Naïve Realism is an insufficient criterion of truth. A host of natural phenomena are demonstrably true, but not observable by the unaided sense. For example, Naïve Realism would deny the existence of [[ultrasound|sounds beyond the range of human hearing]] and the existence of [[x-rays]]. Similarly, there are a number of sense experiments which show a disconnect between the perceived sensation and the reality of its cause.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', pp. 7&amp;ndash;8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pragmatic==
{{See also|Pragmatic theory of truth}}
{{See also|Scientific method}}
If an idea works then it must be true, to the Pragmatist. The consequences of applying a concept reveal its [[truth value]] upon examination of the results. The full meaning of an idea is self-apparent in its application. For example, the therapeutic value and effect of penicillin in relation to infections is proven in its administration. Although [[Pragmatism]] is considered a valuable criterion, it must be used with caution and reservation, due to its potential for false positives. For example, a doctor may prescribe a patient medication for an illness, but it could later turn out that a placebo is equally effective. Thus, untrue concepts could appear to be working contrary to the purpose of the pragmatic test. However, it has validity as a test, particularly in the form [[William Ernest Hocking]] called "Negative Pragmatism". In essence, it states that ideas that do not work cannot possibly be true, though ideas which do work may or may not be true.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas of the Great Philosophers'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revelation==
The principal distinction between intuition and [[revelation]] is that revelation has an assumed source: [[God]] (or another higher power). Revelation may be defined as truth emanating from God. Many [[religion]]s fundamentally rely on revelation as a test of truth. This criterion is subject to the same criticisms as intuition. It may be a valid reference of truth for an individual, but it is inadequate for providing a coherent proof of the knowledge to others.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', pp. 6&amp;ndash;7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time==
Time is a criterion commonly appealed to in debate, often referred to as "[[the test of time]]". This criterion posits that over time erroneous beliefs and logical errors will be revealed, while if the belief is true, the mere passage of time cannot adversely affect its [[Validity (logic)|validity]]. Time is an inadequate test for truth, since it is subject to similar flaws as custom and tradition (which are simply specific variations of the time factor). Many demonstrably false beliefs have endured for centuries and even millennia (e.g. [[vitalism]]). It is commonly rejected as a valid criterion. For example, most people will not convert to another faith simply because the other religion is centuries (or even millennia) older than their current beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', pp. 4&amp;ndash;5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tradition==
[[Tradition]], closely related to custom, is the standard stating that which is held for generations is true. Those accepting tradition argue that ideas gaining the loyalty multiple generations possesses a measure of credibility. Tradition possesses many of the same failings as custom. It is possible for falsehoods to be passed down from generation to generation, since tradition generally emphasizes repetition over [[critical thinking|critical evaluation]].&lt;ref name=sahakian1993p4/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4152">'''Critical friend''' has its origins in [[critical pedagogy]] education reforms in the 1970s and arose out of the self-appraisal activity which is attributed to Desmond Nuttall.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, Harold (1988) "The Advisory Service and Consultancy". In Gray, H. (Ed) ''Management Consultancy in Schools'' (1988), London: Cassell&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most widely used definitions is from 1993,
{{quote|''A critical friend can be defined as a trusted person who asks provocative questions, provides data to be examined through another lens, and offers critiques of a person’s work as a friend. A critical friend takes the time to fully understand the context of the work presented and the outcomes that the person or group is working toward. The friend is an advocate for the success of that work.''&lt;ref&gt;Costa, A. and Kallick, B.(1993) "Through the Lens of a Critical Friend". ''Educational Leadership'' 51(2) 49-51&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Andrew Hutchinson, a public sector consultant, introduced the term to the Local Government Consortium at the [[University of Warwick]] in 1998 and it is cited in several papers produced by Professor Jean Hartley of the Local Government Consortium. The critical friend is characterised as falling between the extremes of the "hostile witness" and the "uncritical lover"&lt;ref&gt;Brighouse, T. and Woods, D. (1999) ''How to Improve your School''. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; whereas earlier texts go so far as to allude to Janus in discussing the concept.&lt;ref&gt;Bolam, R., Smith, G. and Canter, H. (1978) ''Local Education Authority Advisers and the Mechanisms of Innovations''. Windsor: NFER&lt;/ref&gt;

This dichotomy appealed to Hutchinson who frequently used the term while leader of the South East Midlands Citizen's Charter Quality Network run by the [[Cabinet Office]] in Whitehall. In his time running the network he came into regular contact with fellow Lancastrian and Government Minister [[Peter Kilfoyle]] MP, Public Service Minister who was responsible for the running of the networks as minister. When Kilfoyle found himself increasingly distanced from the policy agenda of Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] and he chose to resign from Government, [[Hansard]] quotes him as saying that he wished to return to the back benches but remain a "critical friend" of the Government. 

He was misquoted in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' as they claimed that he had said that he wished to be a "candid friend" to Government. It is not unreasonable to suppose that the term critical friend has its origins in the softer sounding notion of the candid friend. Nonetheless following the resignation of Peter Kilfoyle ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper (a popular publication amongst the intelligentsia and public sector middle management) began to popularise the term which is increasingly entering into general usage. The phrase is still most commonly used in education circles but its wider use in the public sector can to a large part be attributed to Andrew Hutchinson and his natural enthusiasm for the concept, being described as 'a natural critical friend acting with positive intent' in 1999 by the then Chief Executive of [[Coventry City Council]], Iain Roxburgh, who is now Director of the Warwick Research Consortium. While a variety of useful and interesting quotations are to be found on the web&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criticalfriend.eu|title=criticalfriend.eu|website=www.criticalfriend.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps the reason for the popularity of the phrase is best summed up by the following quotation,
{{quote|''The Critical Friend is a powerful idea, perhaps because it contains an inherent tension. Friends bring a high degree of unconditional positive regard. Critics are, at first sight at least, conditional, negative and intolerant of failure. Perhaps the critical friend comes closest to what might be regarded as 'true friendship' – a successful marrying of unconditional support and unconditional critique.''&lt;ref&gt;A John MacBeath; Professor of Education Leadership, Cambridge University&lt;/ref&gt;''}}

{{redirect|Damaged}}
'''Damage''' is any [[Change (philosophy)|change]] in a thing, often a physical object, that degrades it away from its initial state. It can broadly be defined as "changes introduced into a system that adversely affect its current or future performance".&lt;ref name="Farrar"&gt;Farrar, C.R., Sohn, H., Park, G., "[https://books.google.com/books?id=6ET9AP6PRogC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=%22damage+can+be+defined+as+%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidq76hhOnRAhXL7YMKHbrDDWE4ChDoAQghMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22damage%20can%20be%20defined%20as%20%22&amp;f=false Converting Large Sensor Array Data into Structural Health Information]", in Andrew Smyth, Raimondo Betti, ''The 4th International Workshop on Structural Control'' (2005), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Damage "does not necessarily imply total loss of system functionality, but rather that the system is no longer operating in its optimal manner".&lt;ref name="Farrar"/&gt; Damage to physical objects is "the progressive physical process by which they break",&lt;ref name="Lemaitre"&gt;Jean Lemaitre, ''A Course on Damage Mechanics'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1.}}  and includes [[stress (mechanics)|mechanical stress]] that weakens a structure, even if this is not visible.&lt;ref name="Lemaitre"/&gt;{{rp|ix.}}

==Physical damage==
[[File:Hurricane Ike Bridge City TX Shell gas station.jpg|thumb|right|Damage to a gas station in Texas caused by a hurricane.]]
[[File:Groene savooiekool schade van kooluil (Mamestra brassicae damage).jpg|thumb|right|Damage to cabbage leaves caused by insects.]]
All physical damage begins on the [[atom]]ic level, with the shifting or breaking of [[atomic bond]]s, and the rate at which damage to any physical thing occurs is therefore largely dependent on the elasticity of such bonds in the material being subjected to stress. Damage can occur where atomic bonds are not completely broken, but are shifted to create unstable pockets of concentration and diffusion of the material, which are more susceptible to later breakage.&lt;ref name="Lemaitre"/&gt;{{rp|1.}} The effect of outside forces on a material depends on the relative [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] or [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] of the material; if a material tends towards elasticity, then changes to its consistency are reversible, and it can bounce back from potential damage. However, if the material tends towards plasticity, then such changes are permanent, and each such change increases the possibility of a crack or fault appearing in the material.&lt;ref name="Lemaitre"/&gt;{{rp|2–3.}}

Although all damage at the atomic level manifests as broken atomic bonds, the manifestation of damage at the macroscopic level depends on the material, and can include [[Fracture|cracks]] and [[Deformation (mechanics)|deformation]], as well as structural weakening that is not visible.&lt;ref name="Lemaitre"/&gt;{{rp|4.}}

===Damage to objects===
Damage to structures and other objects can take a number of forms, such as [[fire damage]] caused by the effects of burning, [[water damage]] done by [[water]] to materials not resistant to its effects, and [[radiation damage]] due to [[ionizing radiation]]. Some kinds of damage are specific to vehicles and mechanical or electronic systems, such as [[foreign object damage]] caused by the presence of any foreign substance, debris, or article; [[hydrogen damage]] due to interactions between metals and hydrogen; and [[damage mechanics]], which includes damage to materials due to cyclic mechanical loads. When an object has been damaged, it may be possible to [[repair]] the object, thereby restoring it to its original condition, or to a new condition that allows it to function despite the damage.

===Damage to living organisms===
Damage to a living organism may be referred to as an [[injury]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/woundsandinjuries.html |title=Wounds and Injuries: MedlinePlus |publisher=Nlm.nih.gov |accessdate=2015-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kinds of damage experienced by living things range from microscopic [[direct DNA damage]] and [[cell damage]] in a biological cell, to damage to larger systems such as [[nerve damage]], [[brain damage]], and [[articular cartilage damage]]. Damage to the body on a larger scale is often referred to as [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]]. [[Ageing]] is accompanied by a loss of ability to recover quickly from various kinds of biological damage. Damage is one of two factors proposed to influence biological ageing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Mitochondrial Theory of Aging and Other Aging Theories | publisher = 1Vigor | url = http://www.1vigor.com/science/mitochondrial-theory/ | accessdate = 4 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (the other being programmed factors follow a biological timetable). Damage-related factors include internal and environmental assaults to living organisms that induce cumulative damage at various levels.&lt;ref name="KunlinJin2010"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= |title=Modern Biological Theories of Aging.|year=2010 |last1=Jin|first1=Kunlin|volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=72–74 |pmid=21132086|pmc=2995895 |journal=Aging Dis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other concepts of damage==
Damage that occurs as an [[unintended consequence]] of an effort to cause intentional damage elsewhere, such as with a military operation, is called [[collateral damage]],&lt;ref name=USAF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/usaf/afpam14-210/part20.htm#page180 |title=USAF Intelligence Targeting Guide&amp;nbsp;— AIR FORCE PAMPHLET 14- 210 Intelligence |accessdate=6 October 2007 |date=1 February 1998 |page= 180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/collateral%20damage |title=collateral damage |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while damage specifically done to public or private property is called [[property damage]]. By extension, damage is also used to describe a degradation in the value of intangible things such as [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Steve Duck, Julia T. Wood, ''Confronting Relationship Challenges'' (1995), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[self-image]],&lt;ref&gt;David Read Johnson, Renee Emunah, ''Current Approaches in Drama Therapy'' (2009), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; [[reputation]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Moberly, ''Safeguarding Intangible Assets'' (2014), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Social capital|goodwill]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Sidney Rogers, ''Good Will, Trade-marks and Unfair Trading'' (1914), p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hazel Carty, ''An Analysis of the Economic Torts'' (2010), p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics of damage===
The propensity for damage to occur to physical objects and systems, as well as to intangible characteristics, is built into the prices of goods and services that depend on the supply of these things, particularly as a component of [[insurance]] costs.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Ghesquiere, ''Sovereign Natural Disaster Insurance for Developing Countries: A Paradigm Shift in Catastrophe Risk Financing'', The World Bank (2007), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[law]], [[Damages (law)|damages]] are the award, typically of [[money]], to be paid to a person as compensation for loss or injury (i.e., economic or physical damage).&lt;ref&gt;International principle: [http://www.trans-lex.org/946000 Trans-Lex.org], Garner, p.416&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutional damage===
Institutional damage is broadly defined as [[unintended consequence]]s to an individual resulting from interaction with an institution which has responsibility for his or her care. The individual might be a [[hospital]] patient, a child in a school, or a prison [[Convict|inmate]]. Some forms of institutional damage, such as [[medical error]]s and [[hospital-acquired infection]] are relatively easily measured; others, such as long-term damage to development and [[mental health]] are significantly harder to measure. There is controversy as to whether such damage can be measured and if it actually occurs.

It is not a widely used term, however, but it is a legal concept of considerable importance, because it is extremely common, particularly in countries where [[human rights]] of prisoners and other people under institutional care are not respected or guaranteed by [[law]].

[[Constitutional law]], [[civil law (common law)]] and [[criminal law]] codices have many provisions to protect individuals against injuries caused by institutions to which they are unwillingly committed. The extent and the respect to these laws vary widely among countries and communities. These controversies relate to the old [[government]] versus [[individual]] debate which has permeated philosophy and political science since [[Ancient Greece]].

====Damage to institutions====
The same expression is also used in the opposite sense, i.e., as damage caused to institutions, as opposed to damage caused to individuals. For example, [[State of emergency|political exception]] situations, such as the suspension of [[political rights]] for a time, are said to damage [[democracy|democratic]] institutions. Other examples are [[vandalism]] of public buildings, extremely large [[epidemics]] that disrupt normal functioning of society's institutions, such as in the case of [[AIDS]] in [[Africa]]; external military intervention, such as in the invasion of [[Iraq]] by the USA and [[Allies|allied nations]]; and even (paradoxically), external aid to countries which are rich in natural resources but have a poor [[Economic system|economy]] and/or [[Political corruption|corrupt]] government (the so-called "[[resource curse]]")

The two concepts, damage caused by institutions and damage caused to institutions, are related in many situations. In widespread political trials ("[[witch hunting]]") in democratic countries, such as in the famous [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] in the 1940s, damage was said to occur in both directions, i.e., not only the lives, families and professional activities of a number of individuals were wrecked by the public exposure, but also the political institutions of individual rights and freedom in the United States were also similarly damaged by the Committee's activities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11768">[[File:This_book_elaborates_DAH_and_its_the_Bangladesh_ed.jpg|thumb|right|The text book 'Human Immortality' that elaborates DAH and issues related to it]]
'''Death and adjustment hypotheses''' ('''DAH''') is a theory about death and dying that focuses on [[death anxiety (psychology)]] and adjustment to death.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://glencoe.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0078883601/680442/Additional_Lifespan_Development_Topics.pdf Theories on Death and Dying]'', McGraw-Hill, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; It was presented by [[Mohammad Samir Hossain]] as an answer to the overwhelming anxiety and grief about death.&lt;ref&gt;Md Zakaria Siddique, "A review of ''Quest for a New Death: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses''", ''Death Studies'', vol. 33, no. 2 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Meyers, Robert N. Golden, and Fred Peterson (eds.). ''The Truth about Death and Dying''. 2nd ed. New York: DWJ Books, 2009, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to find the resolution to death anxiety, predominantly the existential one, DAH postulates two key themes. Its first part postulates that death should not be considered the end of existence and the second part emphasizes that the belief in immortal pattern of human existence can only be adopted in a morally rich life with the attitude towards morality and materialism balanced mutually.

==Beginning==

The theory was first promoted in the book ''Quest for a New Death: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses'' in 2007. A second book with its elaboration, ''Human Immortality: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated'', was published in 2008. Both books were authored by Hossain. Later the journal ''[[Death Studies]]'' and [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] reviewed these publications for the readerships in Scientific Thanatology and Spiritual Psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, P. (2009). Human Adjustment and the Problem of Death. Death Studies, 33 (8), 771–774&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siddique, M. Z. (2009)Reviewing the Phenomenon of Death—A Scientific Effort from the Islamic World. Death Studies, 33 (2), 190–195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fenwick, P. (2009). Book Reviewing by Dr. Peter Fenwick. Newsletter, 27, Spirituality and Special Interest Group. The Royal College of Psychiatrists. London. at http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/college/specialinterestgroups/spirituality/publications/newsletter27.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  After the analyses of the reviewers were published, the [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] at London published the theory itself as the short article ''Facing the Finality: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses''&lt;ref&gt;http://rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Hossain%20Facing%20the%20Finality.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] publication ''Journal of Loss and Trauma'' did the same in its article "Introducing Death and Adjustment Hypotheses".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mohammad Samir Hossain. "Introducing Death and Adjustment Hypotheses". ''Journal of Loss and Trauma'', vol. 15, no. 4 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Hossain was intolerant to death himself. His childhood was terrified with the anticipatory thoughts of his parents' death. When his elder son Mohammad Seeyam Samir died, parallel to developing support for himself, Hossain decided to put forward his resolutions for death anxiety and grief through the scientific readerships. His research works during and after that period gave birth to the articles and books that he later published promoting the theory and for sufferers of intense death anxiety. Hossain's works on the theory further flourished as his parents' terminal illnesses appeared and compelled him to adjust himself comprehensively to the phenomenon of death for a peaceful personal life. He admitted in one of his autobiographical articles that without the turmoils in his own life he could never realize about the disasters and work to prevent them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hossain, MS, 2011, Abstinence: A Memoir, Journal of Loss and Trauma, 16:5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key components==

Factors behind the DAH are described in ''European Psychiatry'', Volume 26, Supplement 1, Page 1727 in the following manner –

"Viewed from a naturalistic and scientific perspective, death appears to represent the permanent cessation of human existence, contributing to the widespread experience of death anxiety. The present argument attempts to deconstruct this argument on epistemological grounds by analyzing
1) the prevailing universal concept of death in naturalistic discourse, &lt;br/&gt;
2) the issue of our adjustment to this presumed reality, and &lt;br/&gt;
3) the relationship between existence and death in the context of their social evolution. &lt;br/&gt;
Integrating this conceptual analysis with empirical observations, the paper then explores the contrasting postulate, namely that death may not be the end of our existence, and the moral
implications of this alternative assumption. This position, termed the "death adjustment hypotheses," would seem to offer an alternative grounding for theory and research in Thanatology."

===Concept of death===

Finding a common platform regarding the concept of death was the first step towards this work. Dr Hossain's finding was that without a common idea about death people will not be able to share the same remedy for death anxiety.&lt;ref name="MohammadSamir"&gt;Mohammad Samir Hossain and Peter Gilbert. 2010. Concepts of Death: A key to our adjustment. ''Illness, Crisis and Loss'', Vol 18. No 1&lt;/ref&gt; There are many scientific approaches to the concept. For example, brain death, as practiced in medical science, defines death as a point in time at which brain activity ceases.&lt;ref name="MohammadSamir" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0078883601/680442/Additional_Lifespan_Development_Topics.pdf |title=Additional Lifespan Development Topics |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Fenwick%20Book%20Review%20Human%20Immortality;%20%20Death%20and%20Adjustment%20Hypotheses%20Elaborated.x.x.pdf Human Immortality; Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated.] Book Review by Dr. Peter Fenwick&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Hossain%20Facing%20the%20Finality.pdf Facing the finality – Death and Adjustment Hypotheses] Dr. Mohammad Samir Hossain, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It was Hossain's claim that whenever death is taken as permanent and absolute cessation of human existence, morbid fear of death begins; therefore DAH he presented with different ideas of death in relation to existence to reach a conclusion that will be acceptable to most.&lt;ref name="Hossain, M S 2007"&gt;Hossain, M S. 2007. Quest for a new death: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses. Booksurge Publishing, Charleston, US&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death anxiety as a whole===

Death anxiety is the central concern of DAH. It is the morbid, abnormal or persistent fear of one's own death or the process of his/her dying. One definition of death anxiety is a "feeling of dread, apprehension or solicitude (anxiety) when one thinks of the process of dying, or ceasing to ‘be’".&lt;ref&gt;Definition by Farley G.: Death anxiety. National Health Service UK. 2010, found in: {{cite journal|url=http://benthamscience.com/open/tonursj/articles/V007/14TONURSJ.pdf |title=How death anxiety impacts nurses' caring for patients at the end of life: a review of literature |vauthors=Peters L, Cant R, Payne S, O'Connor M, McDermott F, Hood K, Morphet J, Shimoinaba K |journal=Open Nurs J. |year=2013 |volume=7 |pages=14–21 |doi=10.2174/1874434601307010014 |pmid=23400515 |pmc=3565229 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014172346/http://benthamscience.com/open/tonursj/articles/V007/14TONURSJ.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also referred to as thanatophobia (fear of death), and is distinguished from  [[necrophobia]], which is a specific fear of  dead or dying persons and/or things (i.e. others who are dead or dying, not one's own death or dying).&lt;ref&gt;The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition copyright ©2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Updated in 2009. Published by Houghton Mifflin Company&lt;/ref&gt; DAH proposes that no one is free from this anxiety unless there is something significantly positive in the phenomenon of death for humans. Hossain claimed, the idea of 'cessation of existence' through death is the prime factor responsible for initiating death anxiety in one.&lt;ref&gt;Hossain, M S.2008. Human Immortality: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated. Booksurge Publishing, Charleston, US.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Existential death anxiety===

It is apparent that Hossain's description of death anxiety in DAH actually overlaps the idea of existential death anxiety, which is the basic knowledge and awareness that life must end. However, DAH indicates 'existence' as the primary humane need and 'pleasure' as the secondary one. Therefore, DAH postulates, though existential death anxiety strongly correlates behavioral changes,&lt;ref name=langs&gt;Langs, R. (1997). Death Anxiety and Clinical Practice. London: Karnac Books; Langs, R. (2004). "Death anxiety and the emotion-processing mind," ''Psychoanalytic Psychology'', vol. 21, no.1, 31-53; Langs, R. (2004) ''Fundamentals of Adaptive Psychotherapy and Counseling''. London: Palgrave-Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; pleasure in existence must be ensured to maintain the balance between life and death peacefully. Hossain, in the iteration of DAH, highlighted how this sort of death anxiety evolved in the society through time based on his analysis of the history of the West starting from 5th century up to 20th century. DAH adds that assurance of pleasure or pain-free status in any existence after death is another key factor in adjusting with the phenomenon of death even if one is not overwhelmed by existential death anxiety due to his/her belief in any sort of existence after death.&lt;ref&gt;Hossain, M S. 2008. Human Immortality: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated. Booksurge Publishing. Charleston, US&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materialism, immorality and judgment issues===
Hossain explained, as existence after death creates the scope for being judged and punished for the immoral deeds in life, most self-claimed believers pass through the denial of afterlife for their immorality in search of limitless materialistic pleasure. Therefore, one of the key propositions of DAH was the fact that mostly humans abandon their moral ethics due to heightened materialism that gives birth to existential death anxiety even among the self-claimed believers in the existence after death.&lt;ref name="Hossain, M S 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name=MeyersGoldenPeterson&gt;Karen Meyers, Robert N. Golden, Fred Peterson. Infobase Publishing, 2009, 106 page. Retrieved from https://books.google.com/books?id=V-wan_XhkzcC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=Mohammad+Samir+Hossain&lt;/ref&gt;

==Declarations of the Death and adjustment hypotheses==

As outlined very briefly in journal articles, DAH hypothesizes the following for optimum attitude towards death as well as to harmonize the adjustment problems in relation to the phenomenon:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

*Death and Adjustment Hypotheses – One: In the absence of empirical evidence from science, to regard death to be not our absolute end seems natural and is an epistemologically sound point of view. Therefore, it is also more useful practically and for our adjustment to the phenomenon.
*Death and Adjustment Hypotheses – Two: Changing our materialistic view to a moral one on life can help eradicate the social denial of death through the establishment of a sound concept of the phenomenon at personal and societal level, which should also potentate our adjustment to the phenomenon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9193">In [[mathematics]], especially in [[higher-dimensional algebra]] and [[homotopy theory]], a '''double groupoid''' generalises the notion of [[groupoid]] and of [[category (mathematics)|category]] to a higher dimension.

== Definition ==
A '''double groupoid''' '''D''' is a higher-dimensional [[groupoid]] involving a relationship for both `horizontal' and `vertical' groupoid structures.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Ronald and C.B. Spencer: "Double groupoids and crossed modules", ''Cahiers Top. Geom. Diff.''. '''17''' (1976), 343–362&lt;/ref&gt; (A double groupoid can also be considered as a generalization of certain higher-dimensional groups.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Ronald, [http://www.bangor.ac.uk/r.brown/hdaweb2.htm Higher-dimensional group theory] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120723235509/http://www.bangor.ac.uk/r.brown/hdaweb2.htm |date=2012-07-23 }} explains how the groupoid concept has led to higher-dimensional homotopy groupoids, having applications in [[homotopy theory]] and in group [[cohomology]]&lt;/ref&gt;) The geometry of squares and their [[Function composition|compositions]] leads to a common representation of a ''double groupoid'' in the following [[Diagram (category theory)|diagram]]:

[[Image:Dgpd8fdp02.jpg|Double groupoid diagram]]

where '''M''' is a set of 'points', '''H''' and '''V''' are, respectively, 'horizontal' and 'vertical' groupoids, and '''S''' is a set of 'squares' with two compositions. The [[Function composition|composition laws]] for a double groupoid '''D''' make it also describable as a groupoid internal to the [[Groupoid|category of groupoids]].

Given two groupoids '''H''' and '''V''' over a set '''M''', there is a double groupoid &lt;math&gt;\Box(H,V)&lt;/math&gt; with '''H,V''' as horizontal and vertical edge groupoids, and squares given by quadruples

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} &amp; h&amp; \\[-0.9ex] v &amp; &amp; v'\\[-0.9ex]&amp; h'&amp; \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

for which one assumes always that h, h′ are in '''H''' and v, v′ are in '''V''', and that the initial and final points of these edges match in '''M''' as suggested by the notation; that is for example sh = sv, th = sv', ..., etc. The compositions are to be inherited from those of '''H,V'''; that is:

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} &amp; h&amp; \\[-0.9ex] v &amp; &amp; v'\\[-0.9ex]&amp; h'&amp; \end{pmatrix} \circ_1
\begin{pmatrix} &amp; h'&amp; \\[-0.9ex] w &amp; &amp; w'\\[-0.9ex]&amp; h''&amp; \end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix} &amp; h&amp; \\[-0.9ex] vw &amp; &amp; v'w'\\[-0.9ex]&amp; h''&amp; \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

and

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} &amp; h&amp; \\[-0.9ex] v &amp; &amp; v'\\[-0.9ex]&amp; h'&amp; \end{pmatrix} \circ_2
\begin{pmatrix} &amp; k&amp; \\[-0.9ex] v' &amp; &amp; v''\\[-0.9ex]&amp; k'&amp; \end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix} &amp; hk&amp; \\[-0.9ex] v &amp; &amp; v''\\[-0.9ex]&amp; h'k'&amp; \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

This construction is the right adjoint to the forgetful functor which takes the double groupoid as above, to the pair of groupoids '''H,V''' over '''M'''.

Other related constructions are that of a double groupoid with connection&lt;ref&gt;http://planetphysics.org/encyclopedia/DoubleGroupoidWithConnection.html Double Groupoid with Connection&lt;/ref&gt; and homotopy double groupoids.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, R., Hardie, K., Kamps, H. and T. Porter: 2002, "The homotopy double groupoid of a Hausdorff space.", ''Theory and Applications of Categories'': '''10''', 71–93&lt;/ref&gt; The homotopy double groupoid of a pair of pointed spaces is a key element of the proof of a two-dimensional Seifert-van Kampen Theorem, first proved by Brown and Higgins in 1978,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, R. and Higgins, P.J. "On the connection between the second relative homotopy groups of some related spaces". _Proc. London Math. Soc._ (3) (36)(1978) 193–212&lt;/ref&gt; and given an extensive treatment in the book.&lt;ref&gt;R. Brown, P.J. Higgins, R. Sivera, [http://pages.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/nonab-a-t.html ''Nonabelian algebraic topology: filtered spaces, crossed complexes, cubical homotopy groupoids"], EMS Tracts in Mathematics Vol. 15, 703 pages. (August
2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homotopy double groupoid==
A generalisation to dimension 2 of the fundamental groupoid on a set of base was given by Brown and Higgins in 1978 as follows. Let &lt;math&gt;(X,A,C)&lt;/math&gt; be a triple of spaces, i.e. &lt;math&gt;C \subseteq A \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt;. Define &lt;math&gt; \rho(X,A,C)&lt;/math&gt; to be the set of homotopy classes rel vertices of maps of a square into '''X''' which take the edges into '''A''' and the vertices into '''C'''. It is not entirely trivial to prove that the natural compositions of such squares in two directions are inherited by these homotopy classes to give a double groupoid, which also has an extra structure of so-called connections necessary to discuss the idea of commutative cube in a double groupoid.  This double groupoid is used in an essential way to prove a two-dimensional Seifert-van Kampen theorem, which gives new information and computations on second relative homotopy groups as part of a crossed module. For more information, see Part I of the [http://pages.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/nonab-a-t.html book] by Brown, Higgins, Sivera listed below,.

==Convolution algebra==
A ''convolution C*-algebra'' of a double groupoid can also be constructed by employing the square diagram '''D''' of a double groupoid.&lt;ref&gt;http://planetphysics.org/encyclopedia/DoubleGroupoidGeometry.html Double Groupoid Geometry&lt;/ref&gt;

== Double groupoid category ==
The [[category (mathematics)|category]] whose objects are double groupoids and whose morphisms are double groupoid [[homomorphisms]] that are double groupoid diagram ('''D''') [[functors]] is called the '''double groupoid category''', or the '''category of double groupoids'''.

The term '''Ecofeminism''' is used to describe a [[feminism|feminist]] approach to understanding [[ecology]]. Ecofeminist thinkers draw on the concept of [[gender]] to theorize on the relationship between humans and the natural world.&lt;ref name="MacGregor"&gt;{{cite book |author=MacGregor, Sherilyn |title=Beyond mothering earth: ecological citizenship and the politics of care |year=2006 |publisher=UBC Press |location=Vancouver |isbn=978-0-7748-1201-6 |page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was coined by the French writer [[Françoise d'Eaubonne]] in her book ''Le Féminisme ou la Mort'' (1974).&lt;ref name="Merchant"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Warren"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warren|first=Karen|date=September 2002|title=Karen Warren's Ecofeminism|url=|journal=Ethics &amp; the Environment|volume=7|pages=12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, there are many interpretations of ecofeminism and how it might be applied to social thought, including: [[ecofeminist art]], ecofeminist theory, [[social justice]] and [[political philosophy]], religion, contemporary feminism and poetry. As there are several different types of feminism and different beliefs held by feminists, there are different versions of ecofeminism.

Ecofeminism is widely referred to as the third wave of feminism, it adds to the former feminist theory that an environmental perspective is a necessary part of feminism. Ecofeminism uses the parallels between the oppression of nature and the oppression of women as a way to highlight the idea that both must be understood in order to properly recognize how they are connected. These parallels include but are not limited to seeing women and nature as property, seeing men as the curators of culture and women as the curators of nature, and how men dominate women and humans dominate nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecofeminism and the Sacred|last=Adams|first=Carol|publisher=Continuum|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charlene Spretnak]] has offered one way of categorizing ecofeminist work: 1) through the study of political theory as well as history; 2) through the belief and study of [[Earth religion|nature-based religions]]; 3) through [[environmentalism]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Spretnak, Charlene. "Ecofeminism: Our Roots and Flowering." ''Reweaving the World: The Emergence of Feminism'', edited by Irene Diamond and Gloria Ornstein, Sierra Club Books, 1990, pp. 3-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-Oppression==

According to [[Françoise d'Eaubonne]] in her book ''Le Féminisme ou la Mort'' (1974, Ecofeminism relates the [[oppression]] and [[Dominance hierarchy|domination]] of all subordinate groups (women, people of color, children, the poor) to the oppression and domination of nature (animals, land, water, air, etc.). In the book, the author argues that oppression, domination, exploitation, and [[colonization]] from the Western [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] society has directly caused irreversible environmental damage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Françoise d'Eaubonne]] was an activist and organizer, and her writing encouraged the eradication of all social injustice, not just injustice against women and the environment.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecofeminist Philosophy: A Western Perspective on What It Is and Why It Matters|last=Warren|first=Karen J.|publisher=Roman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc|year=2000|isbn=9780847692996|location=Lanham, Maryland|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This tradition includes a number of influential texts including: ''Women and Nature'' ([[Susan Griffin]] 1978), ''The Death of Nature'' ([[Carolyn Merchant]] 1980) and ''Gyn/Ecology'' ([[Mary Daly]] 1978). These texts helped to propel the association between domination by man on women and the domination of culture on nature. From these texts feminist activism of the 1980s linked ideas of ecology and the environment. For example, conferences for women devoted to living on the earth and protests against [[nuclear testing]] and other [[militarism]] that oppresses [[femininity]]. Writing in this circle discussed ecofeminism drawing from Green Party politics, [[peace movement]]s, and [[direct action]] movements.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lamar|first=Stephanie|year=1991|title=Ecofeminist Theory and Grassroots Politics|journal=Hypatia|volume=6|issue=1|pages=28–45|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1991.tb00207.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern ecofeminism, or feminist eco-criticism, eschews such [[essentialism]] and instead focuses more on [[intersectional]] questions, such as how the nature-culture split enables the oppression of female and nonhuman bodies. It is also an activist and academic movement that sees critical connections between the exploitation of nature and the domination over women both caused by men.

==Gendering Nature==
[[File:Petra Kelly.jpg|thumb|[[Petra Kelly]].]]
One ecofeminist theory is that [[capitalist]] values reflect [[paternalistic]] and gendered values. In this interpretation effects of capitalism has led to a harmful split between [[nature]] and [[culture]]. In the 1970s, early ecofeminists discussed that the split can only be healed by the feminine instinct for nurture and [[holistic]] knowledge of nature's processes.

Several feminists make the distinction that it is not ''because'' women are female or "feminine" that they relate to nature, but because of their similar states of oppression by the same male-dominant forces. The [[marginalization]] is evident in the [[Language and gender|gendered language]] used to describe nature and the animalized language used to describe women. Some discourses link women specifically to the environment because of their traditional social role as a nurturer and [[caregiver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stoddart|first=Mark|last2=Tindall|first2=D. B.|year=2011|title=Ecofeminism, Hegemonic Masculinity, And Environmental Movement Participation In British Columbia, Canada, 1998-2007: "Women Always Clean Up The Mess"|journal=Sociological Spectrum|volume=31|issue=3|pages=342–368|doi=10.1080/02732173.2011.557065}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecofeminists following in this line of thought believe that these connections are illustrated through the coherence of socially-labeled values associated with 'femininity' such as nurturing, which are present both among women and in nature.

[[Vandana Shiva]] says that women have a special connection to the environment through their daily interactions and this connection has been ignored. She says that women in subsistence [[Economy|economies]] who produce "wealth in partnership with nature, have been experts in their own right of holistic and ecological knowledge of nature's processes". She makes the point that "these alternative modes of knowing, which are oriented to the social benefits and sustenance needs are not recognized by the [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[Reductionism|reductionist]] paradigm, because it fails to perceive the interconnectedness of nature, or the connection of women's lives, work and knowledge with the creation of wealth (23)".&lt;ref name="Shiva"&gt;{{cite book |author=Shiva, Vandana |title=Staying alive: women, ecology and development |year=1988 |publisher=Zed Books |location=London |isbn=978-0-86232-823-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &amp;nbsp;Shiva blames this failure on the West's [[patriarchy]], and the patriarchal idea of what development is. According to Shiva, patriarchy has labeled women, nature, and other groups not growing the economy as "unproductive".&lt;ref&gt;Shiva, Vandana. "Development as a New Project of Western Patriarchy." ''Reweaving the World: The Emergence of Feminism,'' edited by Irene Diamond and Gloria Ornstein, Sierra Club Books, 1990, pp. 189-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

==An "Ecofeminist Framework"==

In the 1993 essay entitled "Ecofeminism: Toward Global Justice and Planetary Health" authors [[Greta Gaard]] and [[Lori Gruen]] outline what they call the "ecofeminist framework". The essay provides a wealth of data and statistics in addition to laying out the theoretical aspects of the ecofeminist critique. The framework described is intended to establish ways of viewing and understanding our current global situations so that we are better able to understand how we arrived at this point and what may be done to ameliorate the ills.

Gaard and Gruen argue that there are four sides to this framework:

# The [[Mechanistic Materialism|mechanistic materialist]] model of the universe that resulted from the [[Scientific Revolution|scientific revolution]] and the subsequent reduction of all things into mere resources to be optimized, dead inert matter to be used
# The rise of [[patriarchal religion]]s and their establishment of gender hierarchies along with their denial of [[Immanence|immanent]] divinity
# Self and other dualisms and the inherent power and domination ethic it entails
# Capitalism and its intrinsic need for the exploitation, destruction and instrumentalization of animals, earth and people for the sole purpose of creating [[wealth]].

They hold that these four factors have brought us to what ecofeminists see as a "separation between nature and culture" that is the root source of our planetary ills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaard, Greta and|first=Gruen, Lori|date=1993|title=Ecofeminism: Toward Global Justice and Planetary Health|url=|journal=Society and Nature|volume=2|pages=1–35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concepts ==

=== Modern science and ecofeminism ===
In ''Ecofeminism'' (1993) authors [[Vandana Shiva]], [[Maria Mies]] and [[Evan Bondi]] ponder [[modern science]] and its acceptance as a universal and value-free system. Instead, they view the dominant stream of modern science as a projection of Western men's values.&lt;ref name="Mies"&gt;(Mies, Maria, and Vandana Shiva.  ''Ecofeminism''. Halifax, N.S. : Fernwood Publications; 1993. 24.)&lt;/ref&gt; The privilege of determining what is considered scientific knowledge has been controlled by men, and for the most part of history restricted to men. Bondi and Miles list examples including the medicalization of [[childbirth]] and the industrialization of [[plant reproduction]].&lt;ref name="Mies" /&gt;

Bondi argues that the [[medicalization]] of childbirth has marginalized [[midwife]] knowledge and changed the natural process of childbirth into a procedure dependent on specialized technologies and appropriated expertise.
A common claim within ecofeminist literature is that patriarchal structures justify their dominance through binary opposition, these include but are not limited to: [[heaven]]/earth, mind/body, [[male]]/[[female]], human/animal, spirit/matter, culture/nature and [[White people|white]][[Non-white|/non-white]].&lt;ref name="Hobgood-Oster"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/bron/PDF--Christianity/Hobgood-Oster--Ecofeminism-International%20Evolution.pdf|title=Ecofeminism: Historic and International Evolution|author=Laura Hobgood-Oster|accessdate=March 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oppression is reinforced by assuming truth in these binaries and instilling them as 'marvelous to behold' through religious and scientific constructs.&lt;ref name="Hobgood-Oster" /&gt;

=== Vegetarian ecofeminism ===
The application of ecofeminism to animal rights has established [[vegetarian ecofeminism]], which asserts that "omitting the oppression of animals from feminist and ecofeminist analyses […] is inconsistent with the activist and philosophical foundations of both feminism (as a "movement to end all forms of oppression") and ecofeminism."&lt;ref name="gaard"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaard|first1=Greta Claire|year=2002|title=Vegetarian ecofeminism: A review essay|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/frontiers/v023/23.3gaard.html|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|volume=23|issue=2|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It puts into practice "[[the personal is political]]" for it believes that "meat-eating is a form of patriarchal domination…that suggests a link between male violence and a meat-based diet."&lt;ref name="gaard" /&gt; Vegetarian ecofeminism combines sympathy with the analysis of culture and politics to refine a system of ethics and action.&lt;ref name="gaard" /&gt;

=== Materialist ecofeminism ===
Ecofeminism as materialist is another common theme in ecofeminism. A materialist view connects some institutions such as labor, power and property as the source of domination over women and nature. There are connections made between these subjects because similarly there are varying values in production and reproduction.&lt;ref name="Borders" /&gt;

=== Spiritual ecofeminism ===
[[Spiritual ecofeminism]] is another branch of ecofeminism, and is popular among ecofeminist authors such as [[Starhawk]], [[Riane Eisler]], Carol J. Adams, and more. Starhawk calls this an earth-based spirituality, which recognizes that the Earth is alive, that we are interconnected, as well as a community.&lt;ref&gt;Starhawk. "Power, Authority, and Mystery: Ecofeminism and Earth-based Spirituality." ''Reweaving the World: The Emergence of Ecofeminism,'' edited by Irene Diamond and Gloria Orenstein, Sierra Club Books, 1990, pp. 73-86.&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritual ecofeminism is not linked to one specific religion, but is centered around values of caring, [[compassion]], and non-violence.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Eisler, Riane. "The Gaia Tradition &amp; The Partnership Future: An Ecofeminist Manifesto." ''Reweaving the World: The Emergence of Ecofeminism,'' edited by Irene Diamond and Gloria Orenstein, Sierra Club Books, 1990, pp. 23-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Often, ecofeminists refer to more ancient traditions, such as the worship of [[Gaia]], the Goddess of nature and spirituality (also known as Mother Earth).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''Buddhism'''

Buddhism and feminism simultaneously gained momentum in America during the 1960s. Some of the parallels between these movements include their experiential epistemology, the intersection of the constrained mind, intersectionality and connection, using emotional energy as a coping mechanism, relational ethics, and a communal mindset and lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Kaza, Stephanie. “Acting with Compassion: Buddhism, Feminism, and the Environmental Crisis” ''Ecofeminism and the Sacred,'' edited by Carol Adams, Continuum, 1993, Pg 50-69.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Buddhist and ecofeminist practitioners viewed nature as a pathway to enlightenment and as a source of many jumping off points for introspection and deeper thought about the relationship of nature and humans.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Alfred. “Buddhism, Nature and the Environment.” ''The Eastern Buddhist'', vol. 5, no. 1, 1972, pp. 115–129. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/44361321.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Judaism'''

Jewish ideology emphasizes leaving the earth as it was found (or in better condition than it was found in). This concept is also promoted through ecofeminist theories and movements. Both Judaism and ecofeminism do not always present as social justice movements, but they often contribute ideals and motivations for social change.&lt;ref&gt;Plaskow, Judith. “Feminist Judaism and Repair of the World” ''Ecofeminism and the Sacred,'' edited by Carol Adams, Continuum, 1993, Pg 70-83.&lt;/ref&gt; Social justice is an important part of Judaism, and many practitioners see social justice as a form of spirituality, and some feel this form of spirituality through environmental and feminist movements.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Eilon. “Judaism and Nature: Theological and Moral Issues to Consider While Renegotiating a Jewish..” ''Judaism'', vol. 44, no. 4, Fall 1995, p. 437. ''EBSCOhost'', echo.louisville.edu/login?url=&lt;nowiki&gt;https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=9601090437&amp;site=ehost-live&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hinduism'''

In Hinduism, the Ganges River is personified by the Goddess Ganga. She is a paradoxical deity, as she is supposed to be independent yet guarded, pure yet polluted. Ganga is referred to as a deity to be both subjugated and protected. The underlying tone of the passages is patriarchal despite being reverent. The pollution or purity of the Ganges river is a reflection on Ganga, which represents the relationship between spirituality and nature.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, Lina. “Ganga: Purity, Pollution, and Hinduism” ''Ecofeminism and the Sacred,'' edited by Carol Adams, Continuum, 1993, Pg 99-116.&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism emphasizes that all lives are connected and indistinguishable. In this context, every life, be it human or animal, is important.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Rana PB. "Ecospirituality in Indian Tradition: Messages for Global Order."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental Movements==
Women participated in the [[environmental movement]]s, specifically preservation and conservation beginning in the late nineteenth century and continuing into the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mann|first=Susan A.|date=2011|title=Pioneers of U.S. Ecofeminism and Environmental Justice|journal=Feminist Formations|volume=23|issue=2|pages=1–25|doi=10.1353/ff.2011.0028|jstor=41301654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Movements of the 1970s ===

In [[northern India]] in 1973, women took part in the [[Chipko movement]] to protect forests from [[deforestation]]. [[Non violent protest|Non-violent protest]] tactics were used to occupy trees so that [[loggers]] could not cut them down.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Wangari Maathai no Brasil.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Wangari Maathai]].]]
In [[Kenya]] in 1977, the [[Green Belt Movement]] was initiated by Professor [[Wangari Maathai]], environmental and political activist, and is ongoing today. It is rural [[tree planting]] program led by women, which Maathai designed to help prevent [[desertification]] in the area. The program created a '[[green belt]]' of at least 1,000 trees around villages, and gives participants the ability to take charge in their communities. In later years, the Green Belt Movement was an advocate for informing and empowering citizens through seminars for civic and environmental education, as well as holding national leaders accountable for their actions and instilling agency in citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greenbeltmovement.org/who-we-are/our-history|title=Our History|last=|first=|date=|website=The Green Belt Movement|publisher=|access-date=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 in [[New York (state)|New York]], mother and environmentalist [[Lois Gibbs]] led her community in protest after discovering that their entire neighborhood, [[Love Canal]], was built on top of a toxic [[dump site]]. The toxins in the ground were causing illness among children and reproductive issues among women, as well as [[birth defect]]s in babies born to pregnant women exposed to the toxins. The Love Canal movement eventually led to the evacuation and relocation of nearly 800 families by the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chej.org/about-us/story/love-canal/|title=Love Canal|last=|first=|date=|website=Center for Health, Environment, &amp; Justice|publisher=|access-date=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 and 1981, members of such a conference organized a peaceful protest at the [[Pentagon building|Pentagon]]. Women stood, hand in hand, demanding equal rights (including social, economic, and [[reproductive rights]]) as well as an end to militaristic actions taken by the government and exploitation of the community (people and the environment). This movement is known as the [[Women's Pentagon Actions]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 1985, the [[Akwesasne]] Mother's Milk Project was launched by [[Katsi Cook]]. This study was funded by the government, and investigated how the higher level of contaminants in water near the Mohawk [[Indian reservation|reservation]] impacted babies. It revealed that through [[breast milk]], Mohawk children were being exposed to 200% more toxins than children not on the reservation. Toxins contaminate water all over the world, but to due [[environmental racism]], certain subversive groups are exposed to a much higher amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/cjm5/blogs/english/2012/04/mothers-milk-project.html|title=Mother's Milk Project|last=Doverspike|first=Nicole|year=2012|website=English 487W Blog: West of Everything|publisher=|access-date=October 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Greening of Harlem Coalition]] is another example of an ecofeminist movement. In 1989, [[Bernadette Cozart]] founded the coalition, which is responsible for many urban gardens around [[Harlem]]. Cozart's goal is to turn vacant lots into [[community gardens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/26/nyregion/neighborhood-report-harlem-sowing-a-future-with-green-in-it.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Bernadette%20Cozart&amp;st=cse|title=Neighborhood Report: Harlem; Sowing a Future With Green in It|last=Bernstein|first=Emily|date=1993|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=October 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is economically beneficial, and also provides a way for very urban communities to be in touch with nature and each other. The majority of people interested in this project (as noted in 1990) were women. Through these gardens, they were able to participate in and become leaders of their communities. [[Green urbanism|Urban greening]] exists in other places as well. Beginning in 1994, a group of [[African Americans|African-American]] women in [[Detroit]] have developed city gardens, and call themselves the Gardening Angels. Similar garden movements have been occurring globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wild Politics: Feminism, Globalisation, Bio/diversity|last=Hawthorne|first=Susan|publisher=Spinifex Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=Melbourne, Australia|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of [[vegetarian ecofeminism]] can be traced to the mid-80s and 90s, where it first appeared in writing. However, the roots of a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] ecofeminist view can be traced back further by looking at sympathy for non-humans and [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture movements]] of the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="gaard" /&gt; At the culmination of the decade ecofeminism had spread to both coasts and articulated an [[Intersectionality|intersectional analysis]] of women and the environment. Eventually, challenging ideas of environmental [[classism]] and racism, resisting toxic dumping and other threats to the impoverished.&lt;ref name="Gaard" /&gt;

In the 1980s and 1990s some began to see the advancing theories in ecofeminism as essentialist. Through analysis done by post structural and third wave feminists it was argued that ecofeminism equated women with nature. This [[dichotomy]] is dangerous because it groups all women into one category and enforces the very societal norms that feminism is trying to break. Out of this critique rose the [[Gender essentialism|anti-essentialist]] argument. Ecofeminist and author [[Noel Sturgeon]] says in an interview that what anti-essentialists are critiquing is a strategy used to mobilize large and diverse groups of both theorists and activists.&lt;ref&gt;Michiels, Nete. "Social Movements And Feminism." Women &amp; Environments International Magazine, no. 92/93, 2013, pp. 15-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s–present===
[[File:Video Vandana Shiva 2014.webm|thumb|[[Vandana Shiva]].]]
Coming out of the 90s, ecofeminism met a lot of criticism from anti-essentialist feminism, which heavily critiqued what they viewed as [[essentialism]]. The essentialist view saw ecofeminism as reinforcing and growing patriarchal dominance and norms.&lt;ref name="Borders" /&gt; Feminist thoughts surrounding ecofeminism grew in some areas as it was criticized; vegetarian ecofeminism contributed intersectional analysis; and ecofeminisms that analyzed [[animal rights]], [[labor rights]] and activisms as they could draw lines among oppressed groups. To some, the inclusion of non-human animals also became to be viewed as essentialist. According to ecofeminist and author [[Charlene Spretnak]], modern ecofeminism is concerned about a variety of issues, including reproductive technology, [[Equal pay for equal work|equal pay]] and equal rights, toxic poisoning, [[Third World]] development, and more.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Ecofeminism as it propelled into the 21st century became aware of the criticisms, and in response ecofeminists with a materialist lens began doing research and renaming the topic, i.e. queer ecologies, global feminist [[environmental justice]], and [[gender]] and the environment.&lt;ref name="Gaard" /&gt;

=== Movements based on literature ===
Beginning in the late 20th century, women worked in efforts to protect [[wildlife]], food, air and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glazebrook|first=Trish|date=Autumn 2002|title=Karen Warren's Ecofeminism|url=|journal=Ethics &amp; the Environment|volume=7|issue=2|pages=12–27|doi=10.2979/ete.2002.7.2.12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts depended largely on new developments in the environmental movement from influential writers, such as [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Aldo Leopold]], [[John Muir]], and [[Rachel Carson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Norlock|first=Kathryn J.|date=December 2011|title=Building Receptivity: Leopold's Land Ethic and Critical Feminist Interpretation|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/NORBRL|journal=Journal for the Study of Religion, Nature &amp; Culture|volume=5|issue=4|pages=491–509|doi=10.1558/jsrnc.v5i4.491|via=|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seager|first=Joni|date=Spring 2003|title=Rachel Carson Died of Breast Cancer: The Coming of Age of Feminist Environmentalism|url=|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=28|issue=3|pages=945–973|doi=10.1086/345456|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fundamental examples of women's efforts in the 20th century are the books ''[[Silent Spring]]'' by Rachel Carson and ''Refuge'' by [[Terry Tempest Williams]]. These works truly opened American's eyes to the environmental harm they were perpetuating, and created a platform for change.

Ecofeminist author [[Karen J. Warren|Karren Warren]] lists [[Aldo Leopold|Aldo Leopold's]] essay "[[Land ethic|Land Ethic]]" (1949) as a fundamental work to the ecofeminist conception, as Leopold was the first to pen an ethic for the land which understands all non-human parts of that community (animals, plants, land, air, water) as equal to and in a relationship with humans. This inclusive understanding of the environment launched the modern [[Conservation movement|preservation movement]] and illustrated how issues can be viewed through a framework of caring.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Susan A. Mann]] an eco-feminist and professor of [[Sociological theory|sociological]] and feminist theory considers the roles women played in these activisms to be the starter for ecofeminism in later centuries. Mann associates the beginning of ecofeminism not with feminists but with women of different race and class backgrounds who made connections among gender, race, class and environmental issues. This ideal is upheld through the notion that in activist and theory circles marginalized groups must be included in the discussion. In early environmental and women's movements, issues of varying races and classes were often separated.&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;

==Major critiques==
The major criticism of ecofeminism is that it is essentialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaard|first=Greta|date=Summer 2011|title=Ecofeminism Revisited: Rejecting Essentialism and Re-Placing Species in a Material Feminist Environmentalism|url=|journal=Feminist Formations|volume=23|issue=2|pages=26–53|via=|doi=10.1353/ff.2011.0017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ascribed essentialism appears in two main areas:

* '''Adherence to strict dichotomy between men and women:''' Some eco-feminist critiques are that the [[dichotomy]] between women and men and nature and culture creates a [[dualistic cosmology|dualism]] that is too stringent and focused in the difference of women and men. That eco-feminism too strongly correlates the [[social status]] of women with the social status of nature, rather than the non-[[Essentialism|essentialist]] view that women along with nature both have masculine and feminine qualities, and that just like feminine qualities have often been seen as less worthy, nature is also seen as having lesser value than culture, or the qualities involved in these concepts.&lt;ref name="greenfuse" /&gt;
* '''Divergent view regarding participation in oppressive structures:''' As opposed to [[Radical feminism|radical]] and [[Liberal feminism|liberation-based]] feminist movements, mainstream feminism which is most tightly bound with [[hegemonic]] social status strives to promote equality within the existing social and political structure,&lt;ref&gt;hooks, bell. "Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center" Cambridge, MA: South End Press 1984&lt;/ref&gt; such as making it possible for women to occupy positions of power in business, industry and politics, using direct involvement as the main tactic for achieving pay equity and influence. In contrast, many ecofeminists oppose active engagement in these areas, as these are the very structures that the movement intends to dismantle.&lt;ref name="greenfuse" /&gt;

[[Social ecology (Bookchin)|Social ecologist]] and feminist [[Janet Biehl]] has criticized ecofeminism for focusing too much on a [[mystical]] connection between women and nature and not enough on the actual conditions of women.&lt;ref name="Biehl"&gt;{{cite book |author=Biehl, Janet |title=Rethinking eco-feminist politics |year=1991 |publisher=[[South End Press]] |location=Boston, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-89608-392-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also stated that rather than being a forward-moving theory, ecofeminism is an anti-progressive movement for women.&lt;ref name="Biehl" /&gt;

[[Rosemary Radford Ruether]] also critiques this focus on [[mysticism]] over work that focuses on helping women, but argues that spirituality and activism can be combined effectively in ecofeminism.&lt;ref name="Ecofeminism&amp;Globalization"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruether|first=Rosemary Radford|title=Ecofeminism and Globalization|year=2003|editor=Heather Eaton &amp; Lois Ann Lorentzen|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|location=Lanham, Boulder, New York, Toronto, Oxford|isbn=978-0-7425-2697-6|pages=vii – xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A.E. Kings]] has criticized ecofeminism for limiting itself to focusing only on gender and the environment, and neglecting to take an intersectional approach. Kings says that ecofeminists claim to be intersectional, however have fallen short on their commitment until recently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kings|first=A.E.|date=Spring 2017|title=Intersectionality and the Changing Face of Ecofeminism|url=|journal=Ethics and the Environment|volume=22|pages=63–87|via=|doi=10.2979/ethicsenviro.22.1.04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ehrhart Neubert''' (born 2 August 1940) is a retired [[Germany|German]] Evangelical minister and [[theologian]].&lt;ref name=ENlautrbb&gt;{{cite web|title=Ehrhart Neubert geb. 2.

During its final decade he emerged as an opponent of the [[East Germany|East German]] [[Single-party state|one-]][[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|party]] dictatorship, becoming a member of the [[:de:Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR|League of Evangelical Churches in the German Democratic Republic (''Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR''/BEK)]].

==Life==
Neubert was born into the family of a Protestant minister in 1940 in [[Herschdorf]], a hillside village near [[Erfurt]] in central southern Germany. He grew up in nearby [[:de:Großenbehringen|Großenbehringen]]. Between 1958 and 1963 he studied [[Theology]] at [[University of Jena|Jena]]. After 1964 he worked at [[:de:Niedersynderstedt|Niedersynderstedt]] initially as a vicar and later as the minister in charge for the parish. From 1973 he was combining his parish duties with work as a [[:de:Studentenpfarrer|student chaplain]] at nearby [[Weimar]].&lt;ref name=ENlautWerwarwer/&gt; In 1976, probably on the advice of [[Robert Havemann]],&lt;ref name=ENlautEK&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ddr89.de/ddr89/personen/neubert_e.html|title=Ehrhart Neubert|work=DDR 1989/90|publisher=Erhard Kleps, Berlin|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; he joined the [[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)|CDU]], in western Germany a political party of the moderate right, but in the politically and by this time physically [[Inner German border|separated]] eastern German state, one of the so-called "block parties" controlled by the ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party of Germany (''Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands''/SED)]] party through an organisation known as the [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front (''Nationale Front der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik''/NF)]]. In 1984 Neubert resigned from the CDU.&lt;ref name=ENlautrbb/&gt; In 1984 he became community sociology secretary in the Theology Studies department with the Berlin-based [[:de:Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR|East German League of Evangelical Churches]].&lt;ref name=ENlautWerwarwer/&gt;

From 1967 Ehrhart Neubert was also taking part in various informal discussion groups, focusing on theology, sociology and the interface between them. He was sympathetic to the civil right demands of [[Robert Havemann]], who was seen by the regime as a high-profile political dissident. By 1979 Neubert was participating actively in Peace Groups of the [[:de:Evangelische Studierendengemeinde|Evangelical Students' Association]] and, during then 1980s, in other peace circles. He found himself increasingly in conflict both with the state authorities and with the inherently collaborationist leaderships of the official evangelical churches which were keen to retain a level of recognition and toleration from the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|party leadership]]. Neubert also produced a number of quasi-political sociological and theological studies: some of his work appeared in [[West Germany]] under the pseudonym "'''Christian Joachim'''".&lt;ref name=ENlautEK/&gt;

During [[Peaceful Revolution|East Germany's Peaceful Revolution]], Neubert was a co-founder of the [[Democratic Awakening]] movement, founded in 1989 in his apartment.&lt;ref name=spiegel452002&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-25604109.html|title= Karrieren: Angela rennt|date=4 November 2002|author=Matthias Geyer| volume=45/2002| publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] (online) |accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He contributed to the new party's programme and served as its first vice-chairman.&lt;ref name=spiegel452002/&gt; He represented [[Democratic Awakening]] at several of the [[East German Round Table]] sessions&lt;ref name=ENlautEK/&gt; and served on various related investigatory commissions.&lt;ref name=ENlautWerwarwer/&gt; A (relatively) young fellow activist in Democratic Awakening was [[Angela Merkel]] who later became [[Chancellor of Germany]].&lt;ref name=ENlautEK/&gt; Finding himself out of sympathy with what he saw at the time a shift towards the political right,&lt;ref name=ENlautWww&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/wer-war-wer-in-der-ddr-%2363%3B-1424.html?ID=2485| publisher=Ch.

The crunch issue appears to have been the issue of its developing political alliances, notably with the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU (party)]]: Merkel stayed.&lt;ref name=spiegel452002/&gt; After [[German reunification|reunification]], which formally took place in the late summer of 1990, in 1992 he became a member of the [[Brandenburg]] branch of the [[Alliance 90]] (political party).&lt;ref name=ENlautWerwarwer/&gt;

In 1976 the [[Stasi|Ministry for State Security (Stasi)]] had attempted, without success, to recruit Neubert:&lt;ref name=ENlautEK/&gt; sixteen years later, as a member of the "Law and reconciliation" initiative Neubert stood up for the rights of [[Stasi]] victims and for fair and consistent treatment of those involved in the endlessly complex interactions of the Stasi and the Protestant churches in former [[East Germany]].&lt;ref name=RuVlautZeit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/1991/44/missionar-der-stasi/komplettansicht|date=25 October 1991|title=Missionar der Stasi - Ein Ostberliner Pfarrer stellt sich seiner Gemeinde und seiner Vergangenheit |author=[[Christoph Dieckmann (writer) |Christoph Dieckmann]]|publisher=[[Die Zeit]] (online)|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 the [[Alliance 90]] group in the [[Landtag of Brandenburg|Brandenburg Landtag ("regional parliament")]] nominated him as a member of the [[Manfred Stolpe|Stolpe]] inquiry committee. The committee concluded its work in 1994 (although many of the matters it investigated would not be so quickly laid to rest).&lt;ref name=MSUnters&gt;{{cite web|pages=22–23|volume=UiD 10/1995|title=Stolpes Stasi-Vergangenheit steht wieder auf dem Prüfstand|work=CDU-Informationsdienst Union in Deutschland|date=23 March 1995|url=http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_27599-544-1-30.pdf?110826092756| publisher=Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung e.V., Sankt Augustin| accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 Ehrhart Neubart (re)joined the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union of Germany (''Christlich Demokratische Union Deutschlands''/CDU party)]].&lt;ref name=ENlautWerwarwer/&gt; That same year, at the age of 46, he received his doctorate from the [[Free University of Berlin]] for a dissertation on the history of political opposition in the German Democratic Republic from 1949 to 1989.&lt;ref name=1949-1989DDRlautEN&gt;{{cite book|title=Geschichte der Opposition in der DDR 1949-1989 (Forschungen zur DDR-Gesellschaft)|publisher=Ch. Links Verlag, Berlin (paperback edition)|author=Ehrhart Neubert|date=April 1998| isbn=978-3-861-53163-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 the work was published, repackaged into a volume of approximately 1000 pages.&lt;ref name=spiegel031998&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-7809583.html|volume=3/1998|author=Hans Michael Kloth| publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] (online)|title= Politisches Buch Tausend Seiten Widerstand|date=12 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 Neubert took a post with the [[Stasi Records Agency|Stasi Records Agency (''Bundesbeauftragten für die Unterlagen des Staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen Deutschen Demokratischen Republik''/BStU)]], taking charge of the agency's research and education department.&lt;ref name=ENlautWerwarwer/&gt; Together with the agency's commissioner of the time, [[Joachim Gauck]], Neubert compiled the German contribution to the German-language version of [[The Black Book of Communism]], writing the chapter entitled "Politische Verbrechen in der DDR" ("Political Crimes in East Germany").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=[[Stéphane Courtois]] | author2=[[Joachim Gauck]] | author3=Ehrhart Neubert | title=Das Schwarzbuch des Kommunismus.

In 1998 he was co-opted as a board member of the [[Federal Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship|Federal Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship (''Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur'')]].&lt;ref name=ENlautWerwarwer/&gt; By this time he had already become, in 1996, a founding member of the ''Bürgerbüro (Verein)Bürgerbüro - Verein zur Aufarbeitung von Folgeschäden der SED-Diktatur'', a Berlin-based organisation established to provide practical and psychological advice and support for victims of East Germany's [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] version of socialism,&lt;ref name=buergerbuero&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buergerbuero-berlin.de/|title=Wir über uns: Das Bürgerbüro wurde am 17.

'''Everything''' (or '''every thing''') is all that [[existence|exists]]; the opposite of [[nothing]], or its [[Opposite (semantics)|complement]]. It is the totality of things relevant to some [[theory|subject matter]]. Without expressed or implied [[Maxima and minima|limits]], it may refer to [[universal quantifier|anything]]. The [[Universe]] is everything that exists theoretically, though a [[multiverse]] may exist according to theoretical cosmology predictions. It may refer to an [[anthropocentric]] [[worldview]],&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the sum of human experience, history, and the [[human condition]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;"This is the excellent foppery of the world..." — [[Shakespeare]], ''[[King Lear]]'',&lt;/ref&gt;  Every [[object (philosophy)|object]] and [[entity]] is a part of everything, including all [[physical body|physical bodies]] and in some cases all [[abstract object]]s.

==Scope==
In ordinary conversation, ''everything'' usually refers only to the totality of things relevant to the subject matter.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; When there is no expressed limitation, ''everything'' may refer to the [[universe]], the [[world]].

The ''Universe'' is most commonly defined as everything that physically exists: the entirety of [[time]], all forms of [[matter]], [[energy]] and [[momentum]], and the [[physical law]]s and [[physical constant|constants]] that govern them. However, the term "universe" may be used in slightly different contextual senses, denoting such concepts as the ''[[cosmos]]'', the ''[[world (philosophy)|world]]''  or ''[[Nature]]''. According to some speculations, this universe may be one of many disconnected universes, which are collectively denoted as the [[multiverse]]. In the [[bubble universe theory]], there is an infinite variety of universes, each with different [[physical constant]]s. In the [[many-worlds hypothesis]], new universes are spawned with every [[quantum measurement]]. By definition, these speculations cannot currently be tested experimentally, yet, if they{{clarify|reason='they' refers to 'these speculations', which obviously exist. Probably the entities the speculations are about are meant.|date=August 2013}} exist, they would still be part of everything.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Especially in a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] context, ''World'' may refer to everything that constitutes [[reality]] and the [[Universe]]: see [[World (philosophy)]]. However, world may "only" refer to ''[[Earth]]'' envisioned from an [[anthropocentric]] or [[human]] [[worldview]], as a place by [[human beings]].

==In theoretical physics==
{{Main article|Theory of everything}}
In [[theoretical physics]], a ''theory of everything'' (TOE) is a hypothetical [[theory]] that fully explains and links together all known physical phenomena. Initially, the term was used with an ironic connotation to refer to various overgeneralized theories. For example, a great-grandfather of [[Ijon Tichy]]—a character from a cycle of [[Stanisław Lem]]'s [[science fiction]] stories of 1960s—was known to work on the "General Theory of Everything". Over time, the term stuck in popularizations of [[quantum physics]] to describe a theory that would unify or explain through a single model the theories of all [[fundamental interaction]]s of nature.

There have been many theories of everything proposed by [[theoretical physicists]] over the last century, but none have been confirmed experimentally. The primary problem in producing a TOE is that the accepted theories of [[quantum mechanics]] and [[general relativity]] are hard to combine. Whereas theories exploring quantum mechanics and string theory are easier to combine{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}. 

Based on theoretical [[holographic principle]] arguments from the 1990s, many physicists believe that 11-dimensional [[M-theory]], which is described in many sectors by [[matrix string theory]], and in many other sectors by [[dual resonance model|perturbative string theory]], is the complete theory of everything. Other physicists disagree.

==In philosophy==

In philosophy, a ''theory of everything'' or ''TOE'' is an ultimate, all-encompassing explanation of [[nature]] or [[reality]].&lt;ref name=Rescher2006a&gt;Rescher, Nicholas (2006a).

'''Fabel''' is a critical term and a [[Dramaturge|dramaturgical]] technique pioneered by the twentieth-century [[Germany|German]] [[theatre practitioner]] [[Bertolt Brecht]].

''Fabel'' should not be confused with '[[fable]]', which is a form of short narrative (hence the retention of the original German spelling in its adoption into English usage). Elizabeth Wright argues that it is "a [[term of art]] which cannot be adequately translated".&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;Wright, Elizabeth. 1989. ''Postmodern Brecht: A Re-Presentation''. Critics of the Twentieth Century Ser. London and New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-02330-0}}. p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==A critical term==

As a critical term, ''fabel'' refers to an analysis of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of a [[Play (theatre)|play]]. This includes three interrelated but distinct aspects: firstly, an analysis of the events portrayed in the story. In an [[Epic Theater|epic]] production, this analysis would focus on the [[social interaction]]s between the [[Fictional character|characters]] and the [[causality]] of their [[Behavior|behaviour]] from a [[Historical materialism|historical materialist]] perspective; the ''fabel'' summarizes "the moral of the story not in a merely ethical sense, but also in a [[Political theatre|socio-political]] one".&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt; For example, in relation to Brecht's play ''[[Man Equals Man]]'' (1926), Wright argues that "[t]he ''fabel'' of this play centres on the transformation of an individual through his insertion into a collective."&lt;ref name="Wright2"&gt;Wright, Elizabeth. 1989. ''Postmodern Brecht: A Re-Presentation''. Critics of the Twentieth Century Ser. London and New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-02330-0}}. p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, a ''fabel'' analyzes the plot from a [[Formalism (art)|formal]] and [[Semiotics|semiotic]] perspective. This includes the play's [[dramatic structure]] and its formal shaping of the events portrayed. It also includes an analysis of the semiotic fabric of the play, recognizing that it "does not simply correspond to actual events in the collective life of human beings, but consists of invented happenings [and that t]he stage figures are not simple representations of living persons, but invented and shaped in response to ideas."&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt;

Thirdly, a ''fabel'' analyzes the attitudes that the play appears to embody and articulate (in the sense of the author's, the characters' and, eventually, the company's). Brecht refers to this aspect of a play as its ''[[Gestus]]''. Analyzing a play in this way presupposes Brecht's recognition that ''every'' play encodes such attitudes; "for art to be 'unpolitical'", he argued in his "[[Little Organum for the Theater|Short Organum for the Theatre]]" (1949), "means only to ally itself with the 'ruling' group".&lt;ref name="Brecht1"&gt;[[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht, Bertolt]]. 1949. "[[Little Organum for the Theater|A Short Organum for the Theatre]]". In John Willett, ed. ''Brecht on Theatre: The Development of an Aesthetic''. London: Methuen, 1964. {{ISBN|0-413-38800-X}}. p.196.&lt;/ref&gt;

==A practical tool==

As a practical tool, ''fabels'' form part of the process of engaging with a play-text undertaken by a company when mounting a production of a play. A ''fabel'' is a piece of creative writing, usually made by a [[Dramaturge|dramaturg]] or the [[Theatre director|director]], that summarizes the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of a play in such a way as to emphasize the production’s interpretation of that play-text. It is produced in order to make clear the company's ''particular way'' of understanding and rendering the story. In this respect, it is related to the concept of [[Gestus]] (insofar as this renders an action and an attitude towards that action simultaneously); a ''fabel'' indicates the sequence of [[Gestus|gestic]] episodes that constitute the dramatic or theatrical [[narrative]].

[[Carl Weber (theatre director)|Carl Weber]], who worked as a director with [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]] at his [[Berliner Ensemble]], explains that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[w]hat he [Brecht] called ''fabel'' was the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of the play told as a sequence of interactions, describing each event in the [[dialectic]] fashion developed by [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and, in Brecht’s last years, also by [[Mao Zedong|Mao]]. This may sound quite theoretical, but in Brecht’s practice the ''fabel'' was something utterly concrete and practical. Acting, music, the visual elements of the staging, in short, everything an audience perceived, had to contribute to the storytelling and make it lucid, convincing, entertaining and ‘elegant’--as Brecht liked to put it. One result was that the [[Berliner Ensemble|Ensemble’s]] productions were quite well understood by international audiences who could not follow the German text. Brecht insisted that the [[Blocking (stage)|configuration and movement of actors]] and objects on stage should clearly ‘tell the ''fabel''’. If they were to watch a play through a glass wall blocking all sound, the audience should still be able to follow the essential story. He also insisted that each of the performance elements: acting, design, music and so forth, should remain a recognisable [[Separation of the Elements|separate entity]] while it contributed to the ''fabel''’s presentation.  Brecht liked to speak of a 'storytelling arrangement', which meant the specific [[Blocking (stage)|blocking]] of actors and all props employed in a scene. He regarded this arrangement as the most important means to achieve a clear presentation of the ''fabel'', and the term 'scenic writing' may best convey what he was aiming for. [. . .] The thorough and extremely detailed preparation included countless discussions in which a text was dissected to determine which ''fabel'' it might yield."&lt;ref name="Weber"&gt;[[Carl Weber (theatre director)|Weber, Carl]]. 1994. “Brecht and the Berliner Ensemble - the making of a model.” In Peter Thomson and Glendyr Sacks, eds. ''The Cambridge Companion to Brecht''. Cambridge Companions to Literature Ser. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-42485-2}}. p.181, 183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As Weber's reference here to 'scenic writing' suggests, a director or other company member may produce multiple ''fabels'' during the course of a production, each detailing and clarifying a different aspect of the process: a dramatic analysis; an interpretive proposal; an initial springboard position from which to initiate a process of exploration and experiment in rehearsals; a description of individual production aspects (the lighting ''fabel'', the sound ''Fabel'', the visual or scenic design ''fabel'', etc.); an account of progress made at different stages of the rehearsal process; individual actor performance and character behaviour ''fabels''. Virtually any aspect of the theatrical process of production may be explored through the use of a specific ''fabel''.

[[John Willett]], Brecht's English translator, suggests that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[t]he primary principle which [Brecht] taught his collaborators was that of the ''fabel'' or story. The chain of events must be clearly and strongly established not just in the production, but beforehand in the actual play. Where it was not clear it was up to the ‘[[Dramaturge|Dramaturg]]’ to alter the text, in order to cut unnecessary entanglements and come to the point. The play itself might be by [[George Farquhar|Farquhar]] or [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], [[Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz|Lenz]] or [[Molière]], but ‘the writer’s words are only sacred insofar as they are true’. This went for Brecht’s own words as well, and his plays were subject to continual small changes even in the course of a single run. Atmosphere and ‘psychology’ did not matter as such; everything  would emerge given a clear and credible sequence of concrete events. ‘Each scene,’ says a writer in ''Theaterarbeit'',
::is subdivided into a succession of episodes. Brecht produces as though each of these little episodes could be taken out of the play and performed on its own. They are meticulously realized, down to the smallest detail.
The chain of events had become his substitute for the tidy, comprehensive ‘[[Plot (narrative)|plot]]’. Thus the "[[A Short Organum for the Theatre|Short Organum]]":
::As we cannot invite the public to fling itself into the story as if it were a river, and let itself be swept vaguely to and fro, the individual events have to be knotted together in such a way that the knots are easily seen. The events must not succeed one another indistinguishably but must give us a chance to interpose our judgment.
‘Playing according to the sense’, the [[Berliner Ensemble|Ensemble]] calls it; and the sense is what Brecht tried to get clear in any play, first for himself and his collaborators, then for the audience too.Hence, for example, his emphasis on that side of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare’s]] work which is so often neglected: the actual story. ‘It is a long time,’ he found, ‘since our theatre played these scenes for the events contained in them; they are played only for the outbursts of temperament which the events allow.’ [. . . ]
In such conferences Brecht would get his colleagues to make a written or verbal précis of the play, and later they would have to write descriptions of an actual performance. Both were practice in distilling the incidents that count.&lt;ref name="willett"&gt;[[John Willett|Willett, John]]. 1959. ''The Theatre of Bertolt Brecht: A Study from Eight Aspects''. Rev. Ed. London: Methuen, 1977. {{ISBN|0-413-34360-X}}. p.152-153,154)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A ''fabel'' specifies, narrativizes, and objectifies the attitudes and activities involved in the process of producing a play. In doing so, it enables company members to [[Dialectics|dialecticize]] that process—in the sense that a particular ''fabel'' provides a fixed 'snapshot' of a transitory and constantly developing process in a form that enables comparisons to be made. These comparisons may be between the description in the ''Fabel'' and the reality of the production as it stands or between different ''fabels'' (which have been generated by the production either at different stages of the process or in relation to different aspects—lighting, sound, blocking, etc.---of it); for example, having produced a ''Fabel'' at the beginning of the rehearsal process, the director may return to it near the end of rehearsals to check that the production is 'telling the story' intended (or, alternatively, to clarify the ways in which that story has changed as a result of rehearsal exploration and development).

The use of ''fabels'' does not predetermine the style of production nor does it necessarily require an [[Epic theater|epic]] [[Dramatic structure|dramaturgy]] or aesthetic (the elimination of [[suspense]] and mystery,&lt;ref name="suspense"&gt;[[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin, Walter]]. 1939. "What is Epic Theatre? [Second Version]". In ''Understanding Brecht''. Trans. Anna Bostock. London: Verso, 1973. {{ISBN|0-902308-99-8}}. p.17: "[T]he suspense concerns less the ending than the separate events".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alienation effect|defamiliarization effects]], etc.), despite having originated in [[Bertolt Brecht|Brechtian]] practice. The creation of ''Fabels'' is an attempt to achieve clarity for the ''producers'' (actors, director, designers) rather than the ''audience'' (which would characterize an epic production). One may create [[psychological fiction|psychological]] (in a [[Konstantin Stanislavsky|Stanislavskian]] approach) or [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] (in an [[Antonin Artaud|Artaudian]] approach) ''fabels'' as well as the [[Sociology|social]] ones that Brecht explored.

The '''Federation of Egalitarian Communities''' ('''FEC''') is a group of [[egalitarian communities]]&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, Ellen. [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-6385943_ITM Some communes have survived -- and prospered -- beyond the '60s.] ''Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service.'' 23 Sept. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; which have joined together with the common purpose of creating a lifestyle based on equality, cooperation, and harmony with the [[Earth]].&lt;ref name="about"&gt;[http://wiki.ic.org/wiki/Federation_of_Egalitarian_Communities ic.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UK Diggers"&gt;[http://www.diggersanddreamers.org.uk/index.php?one=lin&amp;two=lin&amp;sel=3 Diggers and Dreamers]&lt;/ref&gt; A central principal of these communities is that in exchange for a members working quota (typically between 35 and 42 hours per week) the community pays for all aspects of their life style.  Members do not typically get salaries, instead they have small allowances (typically between $75 and $150 per month) with which they may buy luxury items.  They live, work and socialize within the community but are free to leave whenever they would like.

There are six full-member communities in the FEC, all of which share the primary values of [[egalitarianism]], [[non-violence]] and income-sharing. Approximately 200 people live in the various communities. The organization offers various programs to its member communities, including outreach, labor exchange and catastrophic health care coverage.&lt;ref name="reference"&gt;[http://www.ocfvillage.org/federation-egalitarian-communities/ OFC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="book"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fr20KegfE8gC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=%22federation+of+egalitarian+communities%22&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA130,M1 Utopias and Utopians By R. C. S. Trahair]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the full membership, the FEC has lower levels of membership, such as "Allied" or "Community in Dialog".  These are for communities that may share some, but not all of the FEC values, or who are not prepared for full membership.&lt;ref name="our"&gt;[http://thefec.org/taxonomy/term/4 FEC Communities]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles ==
Each of the full-member FEC communities holds the following values:&lt;ref name="principles"&gt;[http://thefec.org/taxonomy/term/3 FEC Principles]&lt;/ref&gt;
	
# Holds its land, labor, income and other resources in common
# Assumes responsibility for the needs of its members, receiving the products of their labor and distributing these and all other goods equally, or according to need
# Practices [[non-violence]]
# Uses a form of decision making in which members have an equal opportunity to participate, either through [[consensus]], [[direct vote]], or right of appeal or overrule
# Actively works to establish the equality of all people and does not permit discrimination on the basis of race, class, creed, ethnic origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity
# Acts to conserve natural resources for present and future generations while striving to continually improve ecological awareness and practice
# Creates processes for group communication and participation and provides an environment which supports people's development.

The '''Graphical Modeling Framework''' ('''GMF''') is a framework within the [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse platform]]. It provides a generative component and runtime infrastructure for developing graphical editors based on the [[Eclipse Modeling Framework]] (EMF) and [[Graphical Editing Framework]] (GEF). The project aims to provide these components, in addition to exemplary tools for select domain models which illustrate its capabilities.

GMF was first released as part of the [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] 3.2 ''Callisto'' release in June 2006.

The '''Great White Brotherhood''', in belief systems akin to [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and [[New Age]], are said to be perfected beings of great power who spread spiritual teachings through selected humans.&lt;ref name="barrett"&gt;{{cite book |title= Sects, 'Cults', and Alternative Religions: A World Survey and Sourcebook|last= Barrett|first= David|year= 1996|publisher= Blandford|location= London|isbn= 0-7137-2567-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The members of the Brotherhood may be known as the [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] or the [[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]].&lt;ref name="barrett" /&gt;  The first person to talk about them in the West was [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]] (Theosophy), after she and other people claimed to have received messages from them.  These included [[Helena Roerich]], [[Aleister Crowley]], [[Alice A. Bailey]], [[Guy Ballard]], Geraldine Innocente ([[The Bridge to Freedom]]), [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] and [[Benjamin Creme]].&lt;ref name="barrett" /&gt;

==History==
The idea of a secret organization of enlightened mystics, guiding the spiritual development of the human race, was pioneered in the late eighteenth century by [[Karl von Eckartshausen]] (1752-1803) in his book ''[[The Cloud upon the Sanctuary]]''; Eckartshausen called this body of mystics, who remained active after their physical deaths on earth, the ''Council of Light''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl von Eckartshausen|von Eckartshausen, K.]], ''[[The Cloud upon the Sanctuary]]'' (Isabelle de Steiger, translator).  (Weiser: 2003.  {{ISBN|0-89254-084-2}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adepti.com/docs/eck.pdf ''The Cloud on the Sanctuary''] ([[PDF]] etext; accessed Dec. 14, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Eckartshausen's proposed communion of living and dead mystics, in turn, drew partially on Christian ideas such as the [[Communion of Saints|Communion of the Saints]], and partially on previously circulating European ideas about [[secret society|secret societies]] of enlightened, [[mysticism|mystical]], or [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] adepts typified by the [[Rosicrucian]]s and the [[Illuminati]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joscelyn Godwin|Godwin, J]]. ''The Theosophical Enlightenment'' (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1994), ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Mahatma Letters]]'' began publication in 1881 with information purportedly revealed by "[[Koot Hoomi]]" to [[Alfred Percy Sinnett]], and were also influential on the early development of the tradition. Koot Hoomi, through Sinnett, revealed that high-ranking members of mystic organizations in [[India]] and [[Tibet]] were able to maintain regular [[telepathy|telepathic]] contact with one another, and thus were able to communicate to each other, and also to Sinnett, without the need for either written or oral communications, and in a manner similar to the way that [[spirit medium]]s claimed to communicate with the spirits of the dead. The letters published by Sinnett, which proposed the controversial doctrine of [[reincarnation]], were said to have been revealed through this means.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joscelyn Godwin|Godwin, J.]] ''The Theosophical Enlightenment'' (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1994), ch. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eckartshausen's idea was expanded in the teachings of [[Helena P. Blavatsky]] as developed by [[Charles W. Leadbeater]], [[Alice Bailey]] and [[Helena Roerich]]. Blavatsky, founder of the [[Theosophical Society]], attributed her teachings to just such a body of adepts; in her 1877 book ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'', she called the revealers of her teachings the "Masters of the Hidden Brotherhood" or the "[[Mahatma]]s". Blavatsky claimed that she had made physical contact with these adepts' earthly representatives in Tibet; but also, that she continued to receive teachings from them through psychic channels, through her abilities of spirit mediumship.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Hutton|Hutton, R.]] ''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft'' (Oxford, 2000; {{ISBN|0-19-820744-1}}), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideas about this secret council of sages, under several names, were a widely shared feature of late nineteenth century and early twentieth century [[esotericism]]. [[Arthur Edward Waite]], in his 1898 ''Book of Black Magic and of Pacts'', hinted at the existence of a secret group of initiates who dispense truth and wisdom to the worthy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Edward Waite]], ''[http://www.sacred-texts.com/grim/bcm/bcm80.htm The Book of Ceremonial Magic]'' (first edition title: ''The Book of Black Magic and of Pacts''), conclusion.  (London, 1913)&lt;/ref&gt; A young [[Aleister Crowley]], reading this, wrote Waite and was directed to read von Eckartshausen's book. Crowley's search for this secret wisdom eventually led him to become a neophyte in the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], which represented itself to be the visible and earthly outer order of the Great White Brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aleister Crowley]] ([[John Symonds|Symonds, John]] and [[Kenneth Grant|Grant, Kenneth]], eds.), ''[[The Confessions of Aleister Crowley]]'' (Bantam, 1971), pp. xiv-xv (Symonds introduction)&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Golden Dawn itself, its teachings claimed to be derived from a similar body of initiates which in that tradition were called the [[Secret Chiefs]].&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, supra, p. 347 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual phrase "Great White Brotherhood" was used extensively in Leadbeater's 1925 book ''The Masters and the Path''.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. W. Leadbeater|Leadbeater, C. W.]], ''The Masters and the Path'' (Theosophical Publishing House, 1925; expanded, 1927)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alice A. Bailey]] also claimed to have received numerous revelations from the Great White Brotherhood between 1920 and 1949, which are compiled in her books known collectively by her followers as the ''[[Alice Bailey#Bibliography|Alice A. Bailey Material]].'' Since the introduction of the phrase, the term "Great White Brotherhood" is in some circles used generically to refer to any concept of an enlightened community of adepts, on earth or in the hereafter, with benevolent aims toward the spiritual development of the human race, and without strict regard to the names used within the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, supra.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dion Fortune]] adopts the name to refer to the community of living and dead adepts.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, [[Dion Fortune|Fortune, Dion]], ''The Training and Work of an Initiate'' (1930; rev. ed. Weiser, 2000; {{ISBN|1-57863-183-1}}) and ''The Esoteric Orders and their Work'' (1928).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ritual magic]]ians of the [[Western mystery tradition]] sometimes refer to the Great White Brotherhood as the "Great White Lodge", a name that appears to indicate that they imagine it constitutes an [[initiation|initiatory]] [[hierarchy]] similar to [[Freemasonry]]. [[Gareth Knight]] describes its members as the "Masters" or "Inner Plane Adepti", who have "gained all the experience, and all the wisdom resulting from experience, necessary for their spiritual evolution in the worlds of form." While some go on to "higher evolution in other spheres", others become teaching Masters who stay behind to help younger initiates in their "cyclic evolution on this planet". Only a few of this community are known to the human race; these initiates are the "teaching Masters."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gareth Knight|Knight, G]], ''A Practical Guide to Qabalistic Symbolism'' (1965; repr. Weiser, 1978; {{ISBN|0-87728-397-4}}), v. 1 ch. X "Chesed", ss. 14-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[AMORC]] Rosicrucian order maintains a difference between the "Great White Brotherhood" and the "Great White Lodge", saying that the Great White Brotherhood is the "school or fraternity" of the Great White Lodge, and that "every true student on the Path" aspires to membership in this Brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. Spencer Lewis|Lewis, H. S.]], ''Rosicrucian Manual'' (AMORC, 1938), pp. 139-140.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Aleister Crowley's remarks appear to indicate that Crowley identified the Great White Brotherhood with the [[A∴A∴]], his magical secret society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aleister Crowley|Crowley, A.]] ''[http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/aba/app2.html Liber ABA]'', book 4. part 3, appendix II; a/k/a ''Magick in Theory and Practice'' (Sangreal, 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bulgaria]]n [[Gnostic]] master [[Peter Deunov]] referred to his organization of followers as the [[Universal White Brotherhood]], and it is clear that he too was referring to the [[Western mystery tradition|Western esoteric community-at-large]]. When ex-communicated as a heretic on 7 July 1922, he defended the Brotherhood as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 ‘Let the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] resolve this issue, whether Christ has risen, whether Love is accepted in the Orthodox Church. There is one church in the world. But the Universal White Brotherhood is outside the church - it is higher than the church. But even higher than the Universal White Brotherhood is the Kingdom of Heaven. Hence the Church is the first step, the Universal White Brotherhood is the second step, and the [[Kingdom of God|Kingdom of Heaven]] is the third step - the greatest one that is to be manifested.’ (24 June 1923).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, [[Bulgaria]]n teacher [[Omraam Mikhaël Aïvanhov]] ([[Deunov]]'s principal disciple) formally established [[Fraternité Blanche Universelle]] as an "exoteric" esoteric organization still operating today in Switzerland, Canada, the USA, the UK and parts of Scandinavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbu.org/site_anglais/general_english/oma.htm |title=Omraam Mikhaël Aïvanhov |publisher=Fbu.org |date= |accessdate=2009-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Great White Brotherhood'' was further developed and popularized in 1934 with the publication of "Unveiled Mysteries"&lt;ref&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''Unveiled Mysteries''. Chicago, Illinois: Saint Germain Press 1934&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Guy Ballard|Guy Ballard's]] [["I AM" Activity]].&lt;ref&gt;Saint Germain Foundation. ''The History of the "I AM" Activity and Saint Germain Foundation''. Schaumburg, Illinois: Saint Germain Press 2003&lt;/ref&gt; This Brotherhood of "Immortal Saints and Sages"&lt;ref&gt;Vyasa, Krishna-Dwaipayana. [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/maha/index.htm Mahabharata]. Chapter 23 - Arjuna's Quest: Indra addresses Arjuna saying: "This area is the abode of Immortal Saints and Sages. War and war-weapons are just unknown here."&lt;/ref&gt; who have gone through the Initiations of the Transfiguration, Resurrection, and the Ascension&lt;ref&gt;Besant, Annie. London: Theosophical Publishing House 1912&lt;/ref&gt; was further popularized by [[Ascended Master Teachings]] developed by [[The Bridge to Freedom]], [[The Summit Lighthouse]] and the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]], and The Temple of The Presence.

[[Benjamin Creme]] has published books—he claims the information within them has been telepathically transmitted to him from the Great White Brotherhood.

==Founding of the Great White Brotherhood==
In 1952, [[Geraldine Innocente]], messenger for ''The Bridge to Freedom'', delivered this address purported to be from [[Sanat Kumara]] describing the founding of the "Great White Brotherhood":

:" . . . I had nothing to work with but Light and Love, and many centuries passed before even two lifestreams applied for membership - One, later became Buddha (now, Lord of the World, the Planetary Logos [[Gautama Buddha]]) and the Other, became the Cosmic Christ (Lord [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]], now the Planetary Buddha). The Brotherhood has grown through these ages and centuries until almost all the offices are held now by those belonging to the evolution of Earth and those who have volunteered to remain among her evolution. . .."&lt;ref&gt;''The Bridge to Freedom Journal'' November 1953 (Reprinted by Ascended Master Teaching Foundation).&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of [[The Bridge to Freedom]] believe that on July 4, 1954 [[Sanat Kumara]] stated through Geraldine Innocente:

:" . . . Thus We took Our abode upon the sweet Earth. Through the same power of centripetal and centrifugal force of which I spoke (cohesion and expansion of the magnetic power of Divine Love), We then began to magnetize the Flame in the hearts of some of the Guardian Spirits who were not sleeping so soundly and who were not too enthusiastically engaged in using primal life for the satisfaction of the personal self.
 
:"In this way, the Great White Brotherhood began. The Three-fold Flame within the heart of [[Shamballa]], within the Hearts of the Kumaras and Myself, formed the magnetic Heart of the Great White Brotherhood by Whom you have all been blessed and of which Brotherhood you all aspire to become conscious members. . . . "&lt;ref&gt;''The Bridge to Freedom Journal'' November 1955 (Reprinted by Ascended Master Teaching Foundation).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Great Brotherhood of Light==
The Great White Brotherhood, also known as Great Brotherhood of Light or the Spiritual Hierarchy of Earth, is perceived as a spiritual organization composed of those [[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]] who have risen from the Earth into immortality, but still maintain an active watch over the world.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, H. P. ''Isis Unveiled'' Volume 2 page 100:  ". . . the Secret Association is still alive and as active as ever"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roerich, Nicholas and Helena ''Hierarchy'' Agni Yoga Society, Inc. 1931 (reprinted 1977): "Certainly, when the black lodge directs its arrows against the White Brotherhood, the consequences are self-destructive, and the manifestation of a rebounding blow is unavoidable. What you heard is a consequence of self-destruction, because the aimed arrow returned to the sender."&lt;/ref&gt; C.W. Leadbeater said "The Great White Brotherhood also includes members of the Heavenly Host (the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] directly concerned with the evolution of our world), [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings on Venus|Beneficent Members from other planets]] that are interested in our welfare, as well as certain unascended [[Apprenticeship|chelas]]".&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] are believed by Theosophists to be joined together in service to the Earth under the name of the Great White Brotherhood. The use of the term "white" refers to their use of white magic, as opposed to black, and is unrelated to race. The later versions of Blavatsky described the masters as&lt;ref&gt;Sinnett, Alfred Percy. ''[[s:The Occult World/Occultism and Its Adepts#Page 24|The Occult World]]''. Boston: Colby &amp; Rich, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt; ethnically [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] or [[India]]n ([[Hindu]]), not [[European ethnic groups|European]]. Recent skeptical research indicates, however, that this description was used by Blavatsky to hide the real identity of her teachers, some of whom are said to have really been well known Indian rulers or personalities of her time.&lt;ref&gt;K. Paul Johnson: The Masters Revealed. Madame Blavatsky and the myth of the Great White Lodge. Albany, NY 1994: SUNY press&lt;/ref&gt;

Most occult groups assign a high level of importance to the Great White Brotherhood, but some make interaction with the Ascended Masters of the Brotherhood a major focus of their existence. Of these several, the most prominent are the [["I Am" Activity]], founded in the 1930s, The Bridge to Freedom, the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]], and The Temple of The Presence.&lt;ref&gt;''White Paper - Wesak World Congress 2002''. Acropolis Sophia Books &amp; Works 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Belief in the Brotherhood and the Masters is an essential part of the [[syncretism|syncretistic]] teachings of various organizations that have continued and expanded the Theosophical philosophical concepts.&lt;ref&gt;''I AM Ascended Master Dictation List'' Saint Germain Press Inc., 1995, Listing of those who are claimed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004, Listing of those who are believed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity and The Bridge to Freedom&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life - Book II''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989, Listing of those who are claimed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity and The Bridge to Freedom&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Annice ''The Masters and Their Retreats '' Summit Lighthouse Library June 2003, Listing of those who are believed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, and The Summit Lighthouse&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shearer, Monroe &amp; Carolyn ''I AM Adorations, Affirmations &amp; Rhythmic Decrees'' Acropolis Sophia Books and Works 1998, Listing of those who are claimed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, The Summit Lighthouse, and The Temple of The Presence&lt;/ref&gt; Information given by the Summit Lighthouse and the I AM movement is suspect, since none of the writers of these groups are Masters of any Brotherhood. Examples of those believed to be Ascended Masters would be, according to different unconfirmed sources are the [[Master Jesus]], [[Confucius]], [[Gautama Buddha]], [[Mary the Mother of Jesus]], [[Master Hilarion|Hilarion]], [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], [[Paul the Venetian]], [[Kuan Yin|Kwan Yin]], [[Comte de Saint-Germain|Saint Germain]], and [[Kuthumi]]. These sources say that all these peoples put aside any differences they might have had in their Earthly careers, and unite instead to advance the spiritual well-being of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Sinnett, Alfred Percy. ''[[s:The Occult World/Recent Occult Phenomena#Page 95|The Occult World]]''. Boston: Colby &amp; Rich, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agni Yoga==

The Great White Brotherhood is the name given in some metaphysical/occult circles to adepts of wisdom in or out of earthly incarnation who have assumed responsibility for the cosmic destiny of the human race, both individually and collectively. [[Nicholas Roerich]] and his wife, [[Helena Roerich]], inspired by the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] writings of [[H.P. Blavatsky]], published the "[[Agni Yoga]]" series of books. Their contents, claimed to be inspired by the Master [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]], described the work of the White Brotherhood and the Spiritual Hierarchy.

{{original research|date=August 2018}}
{{refimprove|date=December 2016}}
The '''history of ideas''' is a field of [[research]] in [[history]] that deals with the expression, preservation, and change of human [[idea]]s over time.  The history of ideas is a sister-discipline to, or a particular approach within, [[intellectual history]].  Work in the history of ideas may involve interdisciplinary research in the [[history of philosophy]], the [[history of science]], or the [[history of literature]]. In [[Sweden]], the history of ideas and science or [[Swedish history of ideas|''Idé- och lärdomshistoria'']] has been a distinct university subject since 6 November 1932, when [[Johan Nordström]], a scholar of literature, was appointed professor of the new discipline in a ceremony at [[Uppsala University]] (coinciding with that commemorating the 300-year anniversary of the [[Battle of Lützen (1632)|Battle of Lützen]]). Today, several universities across the world provide courses in this field, usually as part of a graduate programme.

==The Lovejoy approach==
The historian [[Arthur O. Lovejoy]] (1873–1962) coined the phrase ''history of ideas''{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} and initiated its systematic study&lt;ref name=greatchain&gt;Arthur Lovejoy: ''The Great Chain of Being: A Study of the History of an Idea'' (1936), {{ISBN|0-674-36153-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the early decades of the 20th century. [[Johns Hopkins University]] was a "fertile cradle" to Lovejoy's history of ideas;&lt;ref name="Paulson1970"&gt;[[Ronald Paulson]] [https://www.jstor.org/pss/468272 ''English Literary History at the Johns Hopkins University''] in ''New Literary History'', Vol. 1, No. 3, History and Fiction (Spring, 1970), pp. 559–564&lt;/ref&gt; he worked there as a professor of history, from 1910 to 1939, and for decades he presided over the regular meetings of the ''History of Ideas Club''.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Lovejoy, ''Essays in the History of Ideas,'' {{ISBN|0-313-20504-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another outgrowth of his work is the ''[[Journal of the History of Ideas]]''.

Aside from his students and colleagues engaged in related projects (such as [[René Wellek]] and [[Leo Spitzer]], with whom Lovejoy engaged in extended debates), scholars such as [[Isaiah Berlin]],&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, ''Against the Current: Essays in the History of Ideas'', {{ISBN|0-691-09026-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Foucault]], [[John Edward Christopher Hill|Christopher Hill]], [[J. G. A. Pocock]], and others have continued to work in a spirit close to that with which Lovejoy pursued the history of ideas.  The first chapter of Lovejoy's book ''The Great Chain of Being'' (1936) lays out a general overview of what he intended to be the programme and scope of the study of the history of ideas.&lt;ref name=greatchain/&gt;

==Unit-ideas==
Lovejoy's history of ideas takes as its basic unit of analysis the unit-idea, or the individual concept.  These unit-ideas work as the building-blocks of the history of ideas: though they are relatively unchanged in themselves over the course of time, unit-ideas recombine in new patterns and gain expression in new forms in different historical eras.  As Lovejoy saw it, the historian of ideas had the task of identifying such unit-ideas and of describing their historical emergence and recession in new forms and combinations.

The unit-idea methodology, intended to extract the basic idea within any philosophical work and movement,&lt;ref name="greatchain"/&gt; also has certain defining principles: 1) assumptions, 2) dialectical motives, 3) metaphysical pathos, and 4) philosophical semantics. These different principles define the overarching philosophical movement within which, Lovejoy argues, one can find the unit-idea, which can then be studied throughout the history of that idea.

==Modern work==

[[Quentin Skinner]] criticizes Lovejoy's "unit-idea" methodology, and he argues that such a "reification of doctrines" has negative consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Quentin Skinner (1969). "Meaning and Understanding in the History of Ideas". ''History and Ideas'' '''8''' (1): 3–53.&lt;/ref&gt;  He emphasizes sensitivity to the cultural context of the texts and ideas being analysed. Skinner's own [[historical method]]ology is based on [[J.L. Austin]]'s theory of speech acts. [[Andreas Dorschel]] criticizes Skinner's restrictive approach to ideas through verbal language, and points out how ideas can materialize in non-linguistic media or genres such as music and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Dorschel, ''Ideengeschichte.'' Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht,  2010. {{ISBN|978-3-8252-3314-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important development within the study of ideas has been within the academic discipline of [[Intellectual History]]. The [[Harvard]] historian [[Peter Gordon (historian)|Peter Gordon]] explains that intellectual history, as opposed to the history of ideas practiced by Lovejoy, studies and deals with ideas within a broader context.&lt;ref name="history.fas.harvard.edu"&gt;Peter E. Gordon, [http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/history/files/what_is_intell_history_pgordon_mar2012.pdf "What is intellectual history? A frankly partisan introduction to a frequently misunderstood field"]. Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon further emphasises that intellectual historians, as opposed to historians of ideas and philosophers ([[History of Philosophy]]), "tend to be more relaxed about crossing the boundary between philosophical texts and non-philosophical contexts...[they regard] the distinction between "philosophy" and "non-philosophy" as something that is itself historically conditioned rather than eternally fixed."&lt;ref name="history.fas.harvard.edu"/&gt; Therefore, intellectual history, as a means of reproducing a historically valid interpretation of a philosophical argument, tends to implement a contextualist approach when studying ideas and broader philosophical movements.

==Foucault's approach==
{{see also|Genealogy (philosophy)|The Archaeology of Knowledge}}

[[Michel Foucault]] rejects the idea of the traditional way historians go about writing, which is a narrative. He believed that most historians preferred to write about long periods of time instead of digging deeper into a more specific history.&lt;ref&gt;Felluga, Dino. [http://www.purdue.edu/guidetotheory/newhistoricism/modules/foucaulthistory.html "Modules on Foucault: On History"]. Introductory Guide to Critical Theory.&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault argues that historians should reveal historical descriptions through different perspectives. This is where he comes up with the term “archaeology” for his method of historical writing. His historical method differs from the traditional sense of historical writing and is divided up into four different ideas.

The first is that "archaeology" seeks to define the history through philosophical means, which is to say the discourse between thought, representation, and themes. The second is that, in "archaeology," the notion of discontinuity assumes a major role in the historical disciplines. The third idea is that "archaeology" does not seek to grasp the moment in history at which the individual and the social are inverted into one another. And finally the fourth point is that "archaeology" does not seek the truth of history, rather it seeks the discourse in it.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. [https://foucault.info/doc/documents/archaeologyofknowledge/foucault-archaeologyofknowledge-00-intro-html "Archaeology Of Knowledge, Introduction"], edited by A. M. Sherida Smith. Vintage, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1973">'''Ideological repression''' refers to forceful activities against competing [[ideology|ideologies]] and [[philosophy|philosophies]].

[[Alan Wolfe]] defines ideological repression as "the attempt to manipulate people's consciousness so they accept the ruling ideology, and distrust and refuse to be moved by competing ideologies".&lt;ref&gt;as cited in "Television as an Instrument of Terror", by [[Arthur Asa Berger]], p. 369 &lt;!-- need to find the original text --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early days of the [[Soviet Union]] and in other countries, ideological repression was carried out by [[political repression]] of the carriers of competing ideologies.

Instruments of ideological repression are [[propaganda]] and [[censorship]]. During the days of "Marxism-Leninism" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://0-www.jstor.org.lasiii.losrios.edu/stable/pdf/1399530.pdf|title=Off-Campus Access - Los Rios Libraries|website=0-www.jstor.org.lasiii.losrios.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Soviet Union -around the early 1930s- students of this particular school of thought were given textbooks that encouraged one particular way of thinking (the Marxist way) as being paramount and the most scientific and true school of thought.

Through ideological repression and control of output information, the Soviet Union was attempting to keep social revolutions at bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://0-www.jstor.org.lasiii.losrios.edu/stable/pdf/1399530.pdf|title=Off-Campus Access - Los Rios Libraries|website=0-www.jstor.org.lasiii.losrios.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2780">In [[topology]] and related areas of [[mathematics]], an '''induced topology''' on a [[topological space]] is a [[topology]] which makes the inducing [[Function_(mathematics)|function]] [[Continuity (topology)|continuous]] from/to this topological space.

== Definition ==

Let &lt;math&gt;X_0, X_1&lt;/math&gt; be sets, &lt;math&gt;f:X_0\to X_1&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;\tau_0&lt;/math&gt; is a topology on &lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt;, then a '''topology coinduced on''' &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; '''by''' &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\{U_1\subseteq X_1 | f^{-1}(U_1)\in\tau_0\}&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;\tau_1&lt;/math&gt; is a topology on &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt;, then a '''topology induced on''' &lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt; '''by''' &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\{f^{-1}(U_1) | U_1\in\tau_1\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The easy way to remember the definitions above is to notice that finding an [[inverse image]] is used in both. This is because inverse image preserves [[union (set theory)|union]] and [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]. Finding a [[direct image]] does not preserve intersection in general. Here is an example where this becomes a hurdle. Consider a set &lt;math&gt;X_0=\{-2, -1, 1, 2\}&lt;/math&gt; with a topology &lt;math&gt;\{\{-2, -1\}, \{1, 2\}\}&lt;/math&gt;, a set &lt;math&gt;X_1=\{-1, 0, 1\}&lt;/math&gt; and a function &lt;math&gt;f:X_0\to X_1&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(-2)=-1, f(-1)=0, f(1)=0, f(2)=1&lt;/math&gt;. A set of subsets &lt;math&gt;\tau_1=\{f(U_0)|U_0\in\tau_0\}&lt;/math&gt; is not a topology, because &lt;math&gt;\{\{-1, 0\}, \{0, 1\}\} \subseteq \tau_1&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;\{-1, 0\} \cap \{0, 1\} \notin \tau_1&lt;/math&gt;.

There are equivalent definitions below.

A topology &lt;math&gt;\tau_1&lt;/math&gt; coinduced on &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the [[finest topology]] such that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] &lt;math&gt;(X_0, \tau_0) \to (X_1, \tau_1)&lt;/math&gt;. This is a particular case of the [[final topology]] on &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt;.

A topology &lt;math&gt;\tau_0&lt;/math&gt; induced on &lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the [[coarsest topology]] such that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] &lt;math&gt;(X_0, \tau_0) \to (X_1, \tau_1)&lt;/math&gt;. This is a particular case of the [[initial topology]] on &lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Examples ==

* The [[quotient topology]] is the topology coinduced by the quotient map.
* If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is an [[inclusion map]], then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; induces on &lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt; a [[subspace topology]].

==Scientific contributions==

In geology, his work included sedimentation in isostatically driven tectonic basins, the active margins of continental plates, physical chemistry of evaporite and pelagic diagenesis, documentation of granulite formation, catastrophic consequences of meteorite impacts, extinction of life forms and the limnology of Lake Zurich.

==Commercial activities==

'''Enterprise'''

After his retirement, Hsu made several inventions in mining, oil, water and energy technology, and founded various companies including Tarim Resource Recycling Limited (UK, 2003); Kenneth Hsu IHC Technology &amp; Development Limited (China, 2005) and Lazarus Energy International Limited (UK, 2007).

'''Inventions'''

Hsu was awarded 16 patents in mining, petroleum, water, carbon, energy and environment management, including the '''Hydro-Transistor''' and '''Integrated Hydrologic Circuit (IHC).'''

Hsu's technologies applied in China [http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=239576] included:
*3-D Enhanced Oil Recovery of the world's residual oil reserves;
*Lithium Production from brine lakes and sea water to empower hybrid vehicles;
*Water Availability by waste water recycling and rainwater harvesting to eliminate shortages;
*Nitrite-Free Drinking Water scientifically demonstrated to reduce the cancer mortality rate by half;
*Nitrite-Free Sewage-Treatment Works to denitritize the drinking water supply;
*Lake Rehabilitation by eliminating algal pollution through sequestering of carbon dioxide;
*Biofuel Generation by utilizing carbon dioxide emissions to mitigate the burning of fossil fuels;
*Capillary Irrigation to conserve water whilst reclaiming land without utilizing surface irrigation;
*Land Reclamation and Desert Greening by sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide;
*Hydro-Electricity without building hydro-electric dams.

'''Endorsements'''

After extensive research and development, Hsu's water technologies were unanamiously endorsed by an expert panel called by the Chinese State Counsellors' Office (Civilian Chief of Staff) of the Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao; and by Nobel Laureate Samuel Ting, and University of California Chancellor, Henry Yang, who both served on the Chinese Premiere's KHC Advisory Board.[http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=239576]

In 2000, Hsu combined the newly developed enhanced oil recovery techniques of hydro-fracturing and horizontal drilling, with water flooding, to invent a totally new process of residual oil recovery (ROR), called 3-dimensional fluid injection, to exploit residual oil. The method utilized water rather than carbon dioxide, although carbon dioxide can also be used in the process. Hsu suggested the technique could increase the recoverable petroleum reserve of the world by a factor of 50% or more.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.searchanddiscovery.net/documents/2008/08070hsu/hsu.pdf Hsu 3-D Fluid Injection Document 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=241291]

With the full support of the Chinese Prime Minister, Wen Jiabao, in February 2006, an Expert Panel called by former Petroleum Minister Dr Wang Tao, unanimously agreed Hsu's ROR invention was innovative, and should be tested and applied in China. In April 2006, PetroChina reported a successful test at the Changqing Oil Field (Northwest China), first discovered in 1907. Prior to the test, its annual production was about 10,000 tons. In 2006, this rose to 10 million tons, and in 2007, to 20 million tons.&lt;ref&gt;http://aapg08.onlineevent.com/PresentationLaunch.aspx?PresentationID=1630{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} KH AAPG Video Presentation 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ventures'''

Hsu is active with institutions, organizations and corporations to apply the new technologies in China and internationally.

'''Consultancy'''

Hsu is President of the IHC Technology &amp; Development Corporation (China), Senior Advisor and Chief Engineer to the Kenneth Hsu Institute for IHC Development (National Institute Of Earth Sciences, Beijing) and Director of the Center for Environmental &amp; Health Engineering (Henan University, Kaifeng). His work on the link between nitrite in drinking water and cancer was documented in The Ecologist journal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theecologist.org/blogs_and_comments/commentators/other_comments/269421/cancersupporting_nitrites_an_alltoofamiliar_story.html Nitrites &amp; Cancer by Oliver Tickell, The Ecologist, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable writings==

Hsu authored or edited over 20 books, many in multiple languages, and was elected an International Writer of the Year by the International Book Club (Cambridge, UK) in 2003.

'''The Mediterranean Was A Desert, 1982'''

The book concerned Hsu's work deciphering the [[Messinian Salinity Crisis]] and provided a first-hand account of one of the most significant deep-sea drilling cruises ever launched. The voyage, Leg 13 of the D/V Glomar Challenger, was undertaken in 1970 and led to the hypothesis that 5.5 million years ago, the Mediterranean was a desert. It documented the adventures of the oceanographic expedition and offered portraits of 'big' science and 'big' scientists at work, with human touches, as a memoir for historians of science.&lt;ref&gt;The Urantia Book, Editors: Richard Bain, Ken Glasziou, Matt Neibaur, &amp; Frank Wright, Jesusonian Foundation, Colorado, "In 1970 the Glomar Challenger sailed for the Mediterranean Sea. Two scientists, Bill Ryan and Ken Hsu, were looking for evidence of the early history of the Mediterranean."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Vita-Finzi, Times Literary Supplement, April 1984: "In his book Hsu narrated a blow-by-blow account of the discovery that the Mediterranean had been a desert caused by the Messinian desiccation at the end of the Miocene.... Echoing a long-standing fictional conceit, Hsu boldly proposed that 5.5 million years ago the Mediterranean had completely dried up to become a salt-strewn desert. Hsu may tell us too much about his toothache and too little about his Chinese antecedents, but he amply succeeds in conveying the emotions and tensions of the cruise and the excitement that accompanies the birth of a persuasive hunch."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Drake, Geology, September 1984: "The whole adventure illustrates how modern science, big science, works, sometimes right on target because of brilliant intuition, sometimes hit-or-miss, and often frustrating because of wrong decisions or equipment breakdown. All students of earth science must read this book. Others should read it for pure enjoyment."&lt;/ref&gt; The book was selected by [[Philip Morrison]] of [[Scientific American]] as one of the 100 most significant and influential books of science in the 20th century. A film was also made by PBS, based on the book.

'''Challenger At Sea, 1983'''

The book was an overview of the then current state of marine geology and a source book for the history of that science, and was used as a geology textbook for non-majors.&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Cann, of The [[Times Higher Education Supplement]]: "Not only is the book good fun, and an honest account of how real science works, but it is a lesson for all practising scientists, especially those who find themselves tempted to be irritatingly conservative."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Smith, ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'': "That this book succeeds in imparting the flavour of what it must be like to take part in such a knife-edged enterprise likewise says much about Hsu’s skill as a communicator, not only of facts and events but also of hopes, fears, elation, despair and, above all, enthusiasm. Hsu has managed to reach parts of the scientific undertaking that most others have been unable or unwilling to reach; and the result is an impressive, if informal and racy account, for layperson and scientist alike, of the nerve-racking business of wresting information from the Earth’s deeper ocean crust."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Morrison, [[Scientific American]]: "The book is a personal and candid chronicle of Hsu’s Leg 13, a tale of garbled radio messages, stubborn management, elated success, grim failure, shipboard intrigue and loyal and delighted colleagues. But his warmth, good humor and candid manner remain much as they must have been when he spent all those days and nights forward in the noisy little driller’s shack just starboard on the tower. The plentiful photographs, maps and bottom profiles are evocative and helpful. This is a winning account of a sunny and serendipitous quest after deep secrets, of youth and insight and simplicity amid world tangles, and not least a "testimonial to a friendship born at sea"."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Great Dying, 1986'''

The book described the circumstances leading to the discovery that the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|dinosaur extinction]] was triggered by a cometary impact. An inquiry into the nature of survival and extinction, it was published in 6 languages, selling over 170,000 copies worldwide, selling 28,000 copies in the United States between 1986 and 1988; 100,000 copies in Mainland China in 1989 and 40,000 copies in Taiwan. A popular newspaper in Taipei ''United Post'' featured ''The Great Dying'' in its weekly list of best-selling books list for more than a year, and it was chosen as a top non-fiction book of the year in August 1992. Originally intended to teach the public, the book was used as a textbook in the United States for its scientific method. A film was also made based on the book by ZDF.

In the book, Hsu marshalled "some of the most gripping and controversial geological discoveries of our time to blast Darwin’s claim and to shake the foundations of his evolutionary theory,"&lt;ref&gt;The Great Dying, Kenneth Hsu, Ballantine Books&lt;/ref&gt; showing evidence indicating a meteor collided with the Earth, 66 million years ago, leaving much of it uninhabitable, and warning that a similar event may threaten humanity in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scientific American]], in September 1987, Philip Morrison : "Hsu writes with unusual clarity and intimacy. He spells out the full logical content of his arguments with more attention to how he came by his premises than is common in popular exposition. The book offers more, a first chapter and a last one. They are attractive, strong, compassionate and well argued. This brilliant geologist has divided a lifetime among three cultures, in China, America and Switzerland. He was certainly an achieve in his American phase. Now, however, he leans toward the Tao. In a cogent but brief discussion he finds no validity in natural selection as a driving force for evolution. Adaptation is real, but not natural selection. That is deeper water."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee Dembard, [[Los Angeles Times]]: "Hsu may well be right that chance is as important to evolution as any other factor. He presents, discusses and analyzes the evidence in support of the comet-extinction theory of dinosaurs and other species, and he shows the role he has played in its development. Hsu’s argument does not show that Darwin’s idea of natural selection is wrong. It merely shows that natural selection may not be evolution’s only determinant."&lt;/ref&gt;

Hsu criticized Charles Darwin's theory of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Philip. (1987). ''Reviewed Work: The Great Dying by Hsü Kenneth J.''

Los Angeles Times.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hsu "If most extinctions are caused by catastrophes... then chance, not superiority, presides over who shall live and who shall die. Indeed, the whole course of evolution may be governed by chance, and not reflect at all the slow march from inferior to superior forms so beloved by Victorians, and so deeply embedded in Western thought."&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"/&gt; The book endorses [[catastrophism]] and [[non-Darwinian evolution]].&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"/&gt;

'''Klima Macht Geschichte, 2000'''

''[[Klima Macht Geschichte: Menschheitsgeschichte als Abbild der Klimaentwicklung|Klima Macht Geschichte]]'' presented a theory of climate and history, looking at future climate changes based on historical, archaeological and helio-biological evidence. It made the prediction of global cooling of the planet in the last decades of the 21st century, and the coming of a little ice age before 2500. The claim forecast was corroborated by scientists [[Khabibullo Abdusamatov]],&lt;ref&gt;http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20080103/94768732.html Cold Spell To Replace Global Warming&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yuk Yung]], John Cassey,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spaceandscience.net S&amp;SR Center Official Site&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nigel Calder]], [[Henrik Svensmark]], [[Alexander Chizhevsky]] and [[John D. Hamaker]] [http://www.remineralize.org]. Orell Fussli Verlag [http://www.books.ch] published the book after an article about Hsu appeared in Bilanz Magazine [https://web.archive.org/web/20100208082239/http://www.bilanz.ch/] in 1998. Earlier, in 1992, Hsu wrote in ''Geographical Magazine'', "Perhaps our species was created by Gaia to prevent a catastrophic chill" in reference to his published paper '''Is Gaia Endothermic?'', on which the book is also based.&lt;ref&gt;Geographical Magazine, March 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''knowledge arena''' is a virtual space where individuals can manipulate [[concept]]s and relationships to form a [[concept map]]. Individuals using a computer with appropriate software can represent concepts and the relationships between concepts in a node-relationship-node formalism. The process of thinking about the concepts and making associations between them has been called "off-loading" by McAleese.&lt;ref&gt;McAleese, R ( 1988) The Knowledge Arena as an Extension to the Concept Map: reflection in action, ''Interactive Learning Environments'', 6,1,1&amp;ndash;22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[concept map]] is a form of  a semantic network or semantic graph. It is formally based on [[graph theory]]. In the concept map, concepts are represented by nodes. The relationship between nodes are represented by ''typed links'' or ''edges''.  (See [[Graph theory]].) In creating a map or graphic representation of what is known an individual intentionally interacts with the graphical interface or map and through a reflective process adds nodes (concepts) and /or adds relationships (edges or typed links) or modifies existing node-relationship-node instances. It is likely that the process of engaging with concepts and relationships between concepts brings about the creation of understandings as well as making the understandings explicit.

Many different claims have been made for the utility of the [[concept map]]. The interactive and reflective nature of map creation is highlighted by the use of the description Knowledge Arena. Although maps may represent what an individual knows at a point in time; it is likely that by interacting with the concepts and relationships in the knowledge arena individual continues to create and modify what that individual ''knows''.

See also &lt;ref&gt;McAleese, R (1999) Skill Aaquisition &amp;ndash; "The Curious Case of Information Searching", ''Interactive Learning Environments'', 7,2, 20&amp;ndash;34.&lt;/ref&gt;

This '''list of [[eponym]]ous laws''' provides links to articles on [[Law (principle)|laws]], [[principle]]s, [[adage]]s, and other succinct observations or predictions named after a person. In some cases the person named has coined the law – such as [[Parkinson's law]]. In others, the work or publications of the individual have led to the law being so named – as is the case with [[Moore's law]]. There are also laws ascribed to individuals by others, such as [[Murphy's law]]; or given [[eponym]]ous names despite the absence of the named person.

* [[Sturgeon's law]]: "Ninety percent of everything is crud." Derived from a quote by science fiction author [[Theodore Sturgeon]] (1918–1985).
* [[Sutton's law]]: "Go where the money is." Often cited in medical schools to teach new doctors to spend resources where they are most likely to pay off. The law is named after bank robber [[Willie Sutton]], who when asked why he robbed banks, is claimed to have answered "Because that's where the money is."
* [[Swanson's law]]: solar cell prices fall 20% for every doubling of solar cell industry manufacturing capacity. The law is named after [[SunPower Corporation]] founder Dr. [[Richard Swanson]].
* [[Szemerényi's law]], in [[Proto-Indo-European phonology]]: word-final clusters of vowels (V), resonants (R) and either */s/ or */h₂/ are simplified by dropping the word-final fricative (*{{PIE|/h₂/}} was phonetically itself probably a back fricative), with [[compensatory lengthening]] of the preceding vowel. Named for Hungarian linguist [[Oswald Szemerényi]].

{{coord|28|44|04|N|110|25|10|W|display=title}}
'''Los Horcones''' is an [[intentional community]] located about 40 miles from [[Hermosillo]], [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/07/science/isolated-desert-community-lives-by-skinner-s-precepts.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm| author=Rohter, Larry| title=Isolated Desert Community Lives by Skinner's Precepts| newspaper=The New York Times | date=November 7, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has described itself "as the only true ''[[Walden Two]]'' community in existence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lamal | first1 = Peter | year = 2009 | title = From Rats and Pigeons to Cultural Practices: A Review of ''Beyond the Box: B. F. Skinner's Technology of Behavior from Laboratory to Life, 1950s to 1970s'' | url = http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/bsi/article/viewFile/2551/2449 | journal = Behavior and Social Issues | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 175–177 | doi=10.5210/bsi.v18i1.2551}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members of Los Horcones use techniques based on behavioral science to [[Shaping (psychology)|shape]] their own and each other's behaviors. They use those behavior-shaping techniques in politically coordinated ways and they do so in order to ''continuously improve'' themselves and their culture. They are striving to build a culture "based on cooperation, sharing, non-violence, equality and ecological sustainability".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.loshorcones.org/start/introduction.html|publisher= Los Horcones|title= Cultural Objectives|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090717054741/http://www.loshorcones.org/start/introduction.html|archivedate= 2009-07-17|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Experimentalism]]'' and ''[[continuous improvement]]'' are two of the most important doctrines of a Walden Two community. [[Burrhus Frederic Skinner]], author of the novel ''[[Walden Two]]'', expressed this in the following way. He wrote:
{{Infobox|name = Los Horcones
|title = Bifurcated Pillars
|headerstyle = background:#ddf;
|header1 =
|belowstyle = background:#ddf;
|below = '''"Comunidad de los Horcones"'''&lt;br /&gt;is the name of the ''corporation'' that owns and operates the ''community'' known as&lt;br /&gt;Los Horcones.
In English, Comunidad de los Horcones means "community of the bifurcated wooden pillars".

A wooden pillar that divides into two branches can be described as being "bifurcated". A bifurcated pillar has a shape similar to the capital letter '''Y'''.

At Los Horcones, bifurcated pillars are sometimes used to support a roof that protects a building's patio.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|"The main thing is, we encourage our people to view every habit and custom with an eye to possible improvement. A constantly experimental attitude toward everything—that's all we need. Solutions to problems of every sort follow almost miraculously." ''Walden Two'', page 25
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The members of Los Horcones refer to their community as a cultural laboratory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.loshorcones.org/start/experimentalculture.html|publisher= Los Horcones|title= A Cultural Laboratory|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090411052420/http://loshorcones.org/start/experimentalculture.html|archivedate= 2009-04-11|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and they regard themselves as cultural engineers.&lt;ref&gt;Cultural engineering means the politically coordinated application of [[behavioral science]] to the establishment of cultural behaviors and to the manufacture of cultural materials.&lt;/ref&gt; They will readily adopt new cultural behaviors&lt;ref&gt;Cultural behavior means the learned behaviors that are shared by the members of a society.&lt;/ref&gt; when experimental evidence indicates that doing so will improve their lives. As a result of their cultural engineering efforts, they are unlikely to suffer from [[cultural lag]].

Los Horcones is listed in the ''[[Communities Directory]]'' of the [[Fellowship for Intentional Community]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://directory.ic.org/715/Comunidad_Los_Horcones ''Communities Directory'']. Fellowship for Intentional Community, February 25, 2012. Retrieved August 23, 2012. "We are a Walden Two community in the sense we apply behavioral principles in our daily life to learn communitarian behaviors. Being a Walden Two does not mean we are inspired by or follow the novel ''Walden Two'' (Skinner) but rather that we apply the science of behavior on which ''Walden Two'' was based".&lt;/ref&gt;

==An Experimental Community==
Los Horcones can also be regarded as an "experimental community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Skinner | first1 = B. F. | year = 1985 | title = News From Nowhere, 1984 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2741768/pdf/behavan00064-0007.pdf | format = PDF | journal = The Behavior Analyst | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 5–14 | pmc=2741768 | pmid=22478616}} "My name is Burris. I live in an ''experimental community'' called Walden Two". p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. (1968). "The Design of Experimental Communities". ''[[International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences]]'' (Volume 16). New York: Macmillan, 1968, pp. 271–275.&lt;/ref&gt; When the members of Los Horcones encounter problems they design and conduct experiments to test possible solutions to their problems. Depending on the result of an experiment, they may collectively resolve to make an experimental behavior into a community-approved component of their behavioral culture. In this way, the Los Horconans try to exercise control over the evolution of their culture.

Despite being sometimes referred to as an "utopian vision",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atlus|first1=Deborah E|last2=Morris|first2=Edward K|title=B. F. Skinner's Utopian Vision: Behind and Beyond Walden Two|journal=The Behavior Analyst|date=2009|volume=32|issue=2|pages=319–335|pmc=2778813|pmid=22478531}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Walden Two community does not claim to be perfect. An experimental community attempts to thrive on its problems because its problems are seen as opportunities for experimentation. According to its proponents, an experimental community can be thought of as a ''eutopia'' (a good place) in which there is always room for experimentation and improvement.

==Behaviorology Movement==
''[[The Behavior of Organisms]]'', [[BF Skinner|B. F. Skinner's]] first book, was published in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. (1938). '' [[The Behavior of Organisms|The Behavior of Organisms: An Experimental Analysis]]''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: B. F. Skinner Foundation. {{ISBN|1-58390-007-1}}, {{ISBN|0-87411-487-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The research strategy that Dr. Skinner presented in that book was widely adopted and grew into a school of psychology named the [[experimental analysis of behavior]]. That school is today known as [[Behavior analysis#21st century behavior analysis|Behavior Analysis]].

As Behavior Analysis grew larger, a growing number of scholars began to believe that Behavior Analysis had outgrown its place in [[Psychology]] and that it was time to establish a separate discipline. Makram Khalil Samaan gave expression to this belief in 1973 when he wrote, "It is time now for the scientific analysis of behavior to call for its own scientific discipline. It is contradictory to its function, objective, methods and content to stay within the realm of psychology." Mr. Samaan suggested that the scientific analysis of behavior become a separate scientific discipline named "behaviorology".&lt;ref&gt;Samaan, M. K. (1973). ''Behaviorology: The Humanist Alternative''. Sacramento, California: [[California State University]]. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 the Los Horconans began using the term "behaviorology" to refer to "the natural science of behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.loshorcones.org/psychology/behaviorology.html|title= Los Horcones: Behaviorology, The natural science of behavior.|access-date= 2009-09-12|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090718043113/http://www.loshorcones.org/psychology/behaviorology.html|archive-date= 2009-07-18|dead-url= yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their summary of behaviorology reads as follows: "Behaviorology encompasses basic research, applied research and philosophy. Basic research includes (a) descriptive analysis of behavior (behaviography), (b) experimental analysis of behavior (experimental behaviorology), and (c) a theoretical or conceptual analysis of behavior (theoretical behaviorology). Applied research refers to behavior-analytic applications of the experimental analysis of behavior to the prevention and solution of social problems. As such, it includes (a) applied research in the form of experimental analysis oriented towards finding solutions to social problems and (b) behavioral technology, in the form of behavior-analytic procedures alone. The philosophy of behaviorology is that of behaviorism, which includes both, philosophical (or metatheoretical) assumptions and the philosophical implications of data obtained by the experimental analysis of behavior and its applications."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Los Horcones | first1 = C | year = 1986 | title = Behaviorology: An Integrative Denomination | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2741890/pdf/behavan00063-0093.pdf | format = PDF | journal = The Behavior Analyst | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 227–228 | pmc=2741890 | pmid=22478664}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Behaviorology Association (TIBA) was founded in 1987. TIBA's purpose statement reads, in part, "TIBA is a professional organization dedicated to representing and developing the philosophical, analytical, experimental, and technological components of the discipline of behaviorology, the comprehensive natural science of the functional relations of behavior including determinants from the environment, both socio-cultural and non-cultural, as well as determinants from the biological history of the species".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Ledoux|first = Stephen F.|year = 2002|url = http://www.behaviorology.org/pdf/F&amp;LCh4OriginsBk.pdf|title = Origins and Components of Behaviorology|edition = Second|location = Canton, New York: ABCs|page = 95|isbn = 1-882508-08-4|access-date = 2018-11-02|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120226203907/http://www.behaviorology.org/pdf/F%26LCh4OriginsBk.pdf|archive-date = 2012-02-26|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1988 three Los Horconans attended the first TIBA convention, which was held at [[Clarkson University]] in Potsdam, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Ledoux|first = Stephen F.|year = 2002|url = http://www.behaviorology.org/pdf/F&amp;LCh4OriginsBk.pdf|title = Origins and Components of Behaviorology|edition = Second|location = Canton, New York: ABCs|pages = 92&amp;ndash;93|isbn = 1-882508-08-4|access-date = 2018-11-02|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120226203907/http://www.behaviorology.org/pdf/F%26LCh4OriginsBk.pdf|archive-date = 2012-02-26|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The second TIBA convention was held at Los Horcones in January 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Ledoux|first = Stephen F.|year = 2004|url = http://www.behaviorology.org/pdf/v7N1IntroOriginsBg.pdf|title = An Introduction to the Origins, Status, and Mission of Behaviorology|journal = Behaviorology Today|volume = 7|issue = 1|page = 30|access-date = 2009-09-12|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081006162523/http://behaviorology.org/pdf/v7N1IntroOriginsBg.pdf|archive-date = 2008-10-06|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; To accommodate that convention, the Los Horconans built a convention hall and several residential buildings.

TIBA subsequently changed its name and is today known as the International Society for Behaviorology (ISB). The ISB describes itself as "an organization of behavioral materialists who hold that: (a) evolution from nonhuman to human behavior is a continuous physical, biological, and behaviorological process; (b) contingencies evoke, shape, and maintain behavior and its processes with no implied or inferred agency playing a causal role".&lt;ref&gt;International Society for Behaviorology: [http://web.me.com/eavargas/ISB/Membership_.html Membership Requirement]&lt;/ref&gt; The ISB's twenty-first annual convention was held in Newport Beach, California. That convention opened on March 18, 2009 and closed 2 days later on March 20, after a "Memorial Dinner" that celebrated the birth of [[B. F. Skinner]] on March 20, 1904.&lt;ref&gt;International Society for Behaviorology: [http://web.me.com/eavargas/ISB/Site_Information.html 2009 Convention]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal Structure==
From a legal perspective, Los Horcones is a corporation. The corporation's full name is Comunidad de los Horcones. It was organized in 1973 and it operates under the laws of the [[Sonora|State of Sonora]], one of the thirty-one states that together make up the [[United Mexican States]]. Los Horcones is a particular type of corporation: it is a [[producer cooperative]].

==Location==
The corporation owns a parcel of land that contains approximately 260 acres (105 hectares). That parcel is approximately 1,312 feet (400 meters) above [[sea level]]. The members of Los Horcones live in buildings which are located on that parcel. Most of those buildings are grouped together on the southern half of the parcel (see aerial photograph).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wikimapia.org/#lat=28.7340414&amp;lon=-110.4197645&amp;z=17&amp;l=0&amp;m=s&amp;v=9|title= Aerial photograph of central building area at Los Horcones}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parcel is bounded on its northern border by Mexican Federal Highway 16 (Carretera Federal 16). The drive from [[Hermosillo]], capital of the State of Sonora, takes about 45 minutes.

'''''MacGyver''''' is an American action-adventure television series created by [[Lee David Zlotoff]] and starring [[Richard Dean Anderson]] as the title character. [[Henry Winkler]] and [[John Rich (director)|John Rich]] were the executive producers. The show ran for seven seasons on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the United States and various other [[television network|networks]] abroad from 1985 to 1992. The series was filmed in Los Angeles during seasons one, two, and seven, and in [[Vancouver]] during seasons three through six. The show's final episode aired on April 25, 1992 on ABC (the network aired a previously unseen episode for the first time on May 21, 1992, but it was originally intended to air before the series finale).

The series was a moderate ratings success and gained a loyal following. It was popular in the United States and around the world. Two television movies, ''[[List of MacGyver (1985 TV series) episodes#TV films (1994)|MacGyver: Lost Treasure of Atlantis]]'' and ''[[List of MacGyver (1985 TV series) episodes#TV films (1994)|MacGyver: Trail to Doomsday]]'', aired on ABC in 1994. A spin-off series, ''Young MacGyver,'' was planned in 2003, but only the pilot was made. Merchandise for ''MacGyver'' includes games, toys, print media and an original audio series.

A [[MacGyver (2016 TV series)|reboot series of the same name]] premiered on September 23, 2016 on [[CBS]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/06/cbs-fall-premiere-dates-2016-1201776569/|title=CBS Sets Fall 2016 Premiere Dates, Slates JonBenet Ramsey kLimited Series|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=June 21, 2016|accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which today owns the rights to the series through its acquisition of the original [[Paramount Television]].

==Plot==
The show follows [[secret agent]] [[Angus MacGyver]], played by [[Richard Dean Anderson]], who works as a [[Troubleshooting|troubleshooter]] for the fictional Phoenix Foundation in Los Angeles and as an agent for a fictional United States government agency, the ''Department of External Services'' (DXS). Educated as a scientist in [[Physics]] at Western Tech ("Hell Week"), MacGyver served in the U.S. Army Special Forces as a [[Bomb squad|Bomb Team Technician]]/EOD during the [[Vietnam War]] ("Countdown"). Resourceful and possessing an encyclopedic knowledge of the [[physical science]]s, he solves complex problems by making things out of ordinary objects, along with his ever-present [[Swiss Army knife]],&lt;!-- need a citation stating each timestamp  --&gt; [[duct tape]], and occasionally matches&lt;!-- need citation with each timestamp --&gt;. He favors non-violent resolutions and prefers not to handle a gun due to a gun death of one of his friends in his teenage years.

His main asset is his practical application of scientific knowledge and inventive use of common items. The clever solutions MacGyver implemented to seemingly unsolvable problems{{nsmdns}}often in life-or-death situations requiring him to improvise complex devices in a matter of minutes{{nsmdns}}were a major attraction of the show, which was praised{{by whom|date=July 2015}} for generating interest in the applied sciences, particularly engineering,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal= Design News|page= 50|author= Design News Staff|date =December 18, 2001|title= Engineers making a difference; Five engineers find the time to teach kids that engineering is cool}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date= September 2013}} and for providing entertaining storylines. All of MacGyver's exploits on the show were ostensibly vetted by consulting scientists for the show's writers to ensure a basis on scientific principles (even though, the creators acknowledged,{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} in [[real life]] one would have to be extraordinarily lucky for most of MacGyver's ideas to succeed). In the few cases where MacGyver used household chemicals to mix up poisons, explosives or other items deemed too dangerous to be accurately described to the public, details were altered or left vague or an essential component or step was omitted.&lt;ref name=britton /&gt;

The show often dealt with social issues, though more so in seasons 4–7 than 1–3, which were mostly about MacGyver's adventures working for the United States government and later for the Phoenix Foundation.

==Cast==
{{Main|List of MacGyver characters}}
{{see also|Organizations in MacGyver}}

* [[Richard Dean Anderson]] as [[Angus MacGyver]], a secret agent who prefers not to carry or use a firearm, due to a childhood accident with a [[revolver]] that resulted in the death of a friend.&lt;ref name="brothers"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink= | title=Brothers | series=MacGyver | serieslink= |credits = | writers = | network = American Broadcasting Company | season = 4 | number = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, MacGyver is willing to use an acquired gun, its parts, or its bullets in non-standard ways, such as a substitute for a wrench. There are three exceptions when he uses a gun for its original intended purpose: in the pilot episode, MacGyver is seen firing an AK-47 on a mission in the opening gambit (7:51 into the episode); he holds two kidnappers at gunpoint in the opening scene of episode 10, season one;&lt;ref name="TargetMacGyver"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink= | title=Target MacGyver | series= MacGyver | serieslink= |credits = | writers = | network = American Broadcasting Company | season = 1 | number = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, is seen using a gun in the TV movie ''Trail to Doomsday''. He is often suspicious of militaristic attitudes within the government; he sees the Los Angeles-based Phoenix Foundation, his employer, as an alternative to more conventional (and violent) means of law enforcement.&lt;ref name="macgyverbook"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pieter Jacobus Fourie |title=Media Studies: Content, audiences, and production |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OLiS7_vqB2EC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=macGyver+production#PPA174,M1 |publisher=Google Books |location=|isbn=978-0-7021-5656-4|date=April 28, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dana Elcar]] as [[Peter Thornton (MacGyver)|Pete Thornton]], MacGyver's boss and best friend. He was an operative at the ''Department of External Services'' (DXS), which is where he is impressed by Mac's ingenuity while tracking down [[Murdoc]] ([[Michael Des Barres]]), an international assassin and master of disguise. When Thornton becomes director of operations at the ''Phoenix Foundation'' several years later, he brings MacGyver into the program. In addition to sending Mac out on various tasks for the foundation, Thornton is many times forced to bail MacGyver out of the trouble he gets into. Thornton has a son named Michael. Late in the show it is learned that Pete has [[glaucoma]], an element written in because of Elcar developing glaucoma in real life. [[Dana Elcar]] is first cast in the pilot episode as Andy Colson, the Chief of Operations at the KIVA Laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macgyveronline.com/pages/andy_colson.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140919122954/http://www.macgyveronline.com/pages/andy_colson.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 19, 2014 |title=MacGyver Online: Andy Colson |accessdate=May 18, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bruce McGill]] as [[Jack Dalton (MacGyver)|Jack Dalton]], MacGyver's comical best friend. He is a soldier of fortune/bush pilot who periodically gets everyone into a heap of trouble with various get rich quick schemes that only MacGyver can get them out of. His left eye twitches when he's lying. Dalton often attempts to romance the women he is introduced to.

== Production ==
===Development===
While creating the series ''MacGyver'', [[John Rich (director)|John Rich]] was working on the sitcom ''Mr. Sunshine'' for ABC, which was short-lived and cancelled quickly. [[Henry Winkler]] had just finished off his eleven-year run on ''[[Happy Days]]'' and was looking for another project. [[Lee David Zlotoff]] was working as a producer for ''[[Remington Steele]]'', which was airing on NBC. The three got together to form the basis for ''MacGyver'' and sold the idea to [[Paramount Television|Paramount]], and ABC became interested in the series.&lt;ref name="macgyverbookrich" /&gt;

===Filming===
The series was filmed in [[Southern California]] for its first two seasons and again in its final season. From seasons 3-6, it was filmed in various locations around [[Vancouver]] in British Columbia, Canada.&lt;ref name="filmingcanada"&gt;{{cite web|author=Canadaka |title=TV Series Filmed in Canada |url=http://www.canadaka.net/content/page/127-tv-series-filmed-in-canada |work=Canadaka.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Los Angeles remained as the setting of the show for the entire duration.  The move to Vancouver was due to the threat of the series being cancelled due to the high production cost. In seasons 1 and 2, MacGyver was portrayed living in a waterfront apartment in [[Venice Beach, California|Venice Beach]]. In season 3, he moved onto a houseboat at an unspecified location, though implied still to be in Los Angeles (the actual shooting took place at [[Coal Harbour]], near downtown Vancouver). Filming returned to Los Angeles for the final season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macgyveronline.com/pages/locations.html|title=MacGyver Online: Filming Locations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
When the series was in pre-production, Winkler and Rich were looking for a suitable actor for the lead.&lt;ref name="macgyverbookrich" /&gt; After Richard Dean Anderson's appearance in the American television series ''[[The Love Boat]]'', Winkler got Anderson to audition for the part.&lt;ref name="casting"&gt;{{cite web |last=Brady |first=James |title=In Step With Richard Dean Anderson |url=http://www.rdanderson.com/archives/98-12-27.htm |date=December 27, 1998 |publisher=Parade Magazine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927080959/http://www.rdanderson.com/archives/98-12-27.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |accessdate=May 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rich, every auditioning actor "hulked" his way through his audition. When Anderson eventually auditioned for the role, Winkler and Rich felt that he gave the character a human touch which the other actors could not. Both believed that Anderson would become one of the new "breakout" stars on American television.&lt;ref name="macgyverbookrich"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Rich |title=Warm Up the Snake |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CIW4EVwj1egC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=macGyver+richard%20dean%20anderson#PPA161,M1 |work=Google Books |accessdate=May 14, 2009|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-11578-5|date=October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson is known for having done many of the stunts in the series, though in later seasons he reduced his participation because of accumulating injuries. He injured his back and required foot surgery because of accidents working as a stuntman.&lt;ref name="stuntman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenstein |first1=Lindsay |last2=Giles |first2=Laura |last3=Bogdan |first3=Alex |title=Kidsday: Talking with Richard Dean Anderson |url=http://www.rdanderson.com/archives/90-02-04.htm |date=February 4, 1990 |publisher=Newsday |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927081005/http://www.rdanderson.com/archives/90-02-04.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |accessdate=May 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Episodes==
{{Main|List of MacGyver (1985 TV series) episodes}}
{{:List of MacGyver (1985 TV series) episodes}}

Several episodes, including the pilot, begin with a [[cold open]], finding MacGyver already on a mission. MacGyver often narrates a story from his childhood relating to his current situation. He resolves this situation quickly, and the main story commences after the opening credits. The credits refer to such an opening sequence as the "Opening Gambit"{{nsmdns}}it occurs far more commonly in earlier episodes than in later ones. This segment is often written and directed by a different team than the main story of the episode. After the credits, the main story plays out in standard [[three-act structure]]. In many episodes, the opening sequence occurs after the opening credits and often does not involve MacGyver on a mission but rather in a situation used for [[characterization|character development]]. In the same manner as the "Opening Gambit" sequences, these opening segments often do not directly relate to the main story.

==Broadcast history==
After a slow start in its first season, ''MacGyver'' became a [[sleeper hit]] for ABC in its second season, during which it began a six-year run as the lead-in to ABC's ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' (the longest such run in history).&lt;ref name="onetwohit"&gt;{{cite web|author=Suzanne Stevens |title=In a fix? Call MacGyver, not the average Joe who plays him |url=http://www.macgyveronline.com/pages/article30.html | date= January 19, 1987 | publisher=People Weekly | accessdate=May 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the show's [[MacGyver (1985 TV series, season 4)|fourth season]], Richard Dean Anderson complained that ABC was not marketing the series enough. Saying that the series is "just another action show" for ABC, he further stated that ABC didn't give the series enough promotion.&lt;ref name="thephiladelphia"&gt;{{cite web|author=David Walstad |title=Series gets no respect, star says; Richard Dean Anderson faces his fourth season as MacGyver |url=http://www.macgyveronline.com/pages/article16.html | date= July 24, 1988 | publisher=The Philadelphia Inquirer | accessdate=May 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''MacGyver's'' seventh season was abbreviated. After the twelfth episode of the season aired on December 30, 1991, ''MacGyver'' disappeared from the ABC schedule and did not return until April 25, 1992 by which point the series had been cancelled. The finale aired that night, with a previously unaired episode following on May 21, 1992. When asked why the series was cancelled, Anderson replied: "The only reason it went off the air was that everybody was ready to move on. I was physically exhausted and had no life."&lt;ref name="iceman"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark Nollinger |title=Ice Man |url=http://rdanderson.com/archives/1997-07-05.htm | work=TV Guide | date= July 15, 1997 | publisher=TV Guide | accessdate=May 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TV films===
In 1994, the series was released in over 70 different worldwide markets.&lt;ref name="producingmacsequal" /&gt; Because of popular demand, two TV-movies were created, both released in 1994. The first movie ''[[List of MacGyver (1985 TV series) episodes#TV films (1994)|MacGyver: Lost Treasure of Atlantis]]'' premiered in the United States in May. The film was shot in England and Greece. The second movie was entitled ''[[List of MacGyver (1985 TV series) episodes#TV films (1994)|MacGyver: Trail to Doomsday]]''. Anderson served as [[executive producer]] for both films,&lt;ref name="producingmacsequal"&gt;{{cite web |first=Susan |last=King |title=Richard Dean Anderson producing Macsequels |url=http://www.rdanderson.com/archives/94-05-08.htm |date=May 8, 1994 |publisher=The Los Angeles Times |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927081143/http://www.rdanderson.com/archives/94-05-08.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |accessdate=May 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were filmed in Europe.&lt;ref name="anewimageformacgyver"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jerry |last=Buck |title=A New Image for MacGyver |url=http://www.rdanderson.com/archives/92-12-14.htm |date=December 14, 1992 |publisher=The Wichita Eagle |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927081155/http://www.rdanderson.com/archives/92-12-14.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syndication and home media==
Re-runs of the series still air in North America, Europe, Australia, Asia and Ethiopia. Alongside local syndication, reruns aired on the [[USA Network]] from 1990 to 1997, on [[WGN America]] from 1998 to 2002, on [[TV Land]] from January 2003 to 2006, on [[Paramount Network|Spike]] for a brief time in 2005. It is formerly aired on [[Cloo]] (2011–2017) with marathon blocks shown on the weekends and on May 13, 2015, [[Esquire Network]] started airing reruns of the series.  [[MeTV Network]] has acquired some rights to air the series as of December 2, 2015.

[[Paramount Home Entertainment]] has released all seven seasons of ''MacGyver'' on DVD in  [[Dvd region code|Regions]] 1, 2 and 4. On October 16, 2007, CBS DVD released ''MacGyver: The Complete Series'', a special collectors' edition box set that features all 139 episodes of the series as well as the two TV movies that followed.

On June 15, 2010, Paramount released the two TV movies on DVD in Region{{nbsp}}1 in a separate single-disc release entitled ''MacGyver – The TV Movies.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/MacGyver-The-TV-Movies/13505 |title=MacGyver DVD news: Date Change for MacGyver – The TV Movies |publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com |date= |accessdate=February 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916024956/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/MacGyver-The-TV-Movies/13505 |archivedate=September 16, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 13, 2015, [[CBS Home Entertainment]] announced they would release a repackaged version of the complete series set on DVD in Region{{nbsp}}1, at a lower price, on April 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/MacGyver-The-Complete-Series/20648|title=Paramount to Re-Release 'The Complete Collection' on DVD|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418144029/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/MacGyver-The-Complete-Series/20648|archivedate=April 18, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This series aired weekday afternoons &amp; weeknights on [[MeTV]] from 12/19/16-5/26/17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://woio.titantv.com|title=TitanTV Programming Guide -- What's on TV, Movies, Reality Shows, and Local News|first=Decisionmark Corp. 818 Dows Road SE, Cedar Rapids, Iowa|last=52403|website=woio.titantv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== High definition remaster ===

In June 2018, [[CBS]] announced that the original camera negatives, thought to be lost, had been relocated and a high definition remaster of the series was underway. The June 21 press release confirmed that the first three seasons had been completed, with the remaining four to be remastered before the end of 2018. The press release also included a teaser showcasing the notable improvement in quality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.home.cbssi.com/news-press-details/the-original-macgyver-hd-remastered/ CBS Press Release, June 21 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first season was eventually released on October 30, 2018.

==Impact==
{{See also|List of awards and nominations received by MacGyver|MacGyver in popular culture}}

The character's ability to use everyday objects to perform extraordinary feats (sometimes called "MacGyvering") has been widely referenced and parodied. There have been a few comedic [[spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] of the show, such as ''[[Saturday Night Live|Saturday Night Live's]]'' "[[MacGruber]]," which later was made into a full feature film named ''[[MacGruber (film)|MacGruber]]'', and a parody of the song "[[Hey There Delilah]]", which was given the name "Hey There MacGyver."

The series is referenced in episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', primarily detailing the obsession [[Marge Simpson|Marge Simpson's]] sisters ([[Patty Bouvier|Patty]] and [[Selma Bouvier|Selma]]) have with the show and their [[Limerence|crush]] on the MacGyver character. The sisters' regular viewing of the show is an unalterable element of their daily schedule to the point of death as demonstrated in the episode "[[Black Widower]]". The episode featured a fictional scene of MacGyver where he downplays his role in saving a village. ("Don't thank me. Thank the moon's [[gravitational pull]].")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=A Star Is Burns |episodelink=A Star Is Burns |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |airdate=1995-03-05 |season=6 |number=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another episode, "[[A Star is Burns]]", Homer tricks [[The Critic|Jay Sherman]] into insulting MacGyver in front of Patty and Selma; Sherman ends up being hung from the rain gutter by his underpants, and Bart asks "You badmouthed MacGyver, didn't you?" Anderson himself is an avid fan of ''The Simpsons'', and even provided his voice for an episode of the show titled "[[Kiss Kiss, Bang Bangalore]]", which first aired April 9, 2006, where Patty and Selma kidnap Richard Dean Anderson after he admits that he never liked doing ''MacGyver'' and only did the show for the money, but eventually gets a thrill out of escaping and annoys them by wanting to do it again and again.

In the first episode of Anderson's later show, ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', [[Amanda Tapping]] mentions that the Air Force had to "MacGyver" a Dial Home Device for the Stargate, and a split-second shot following this shows Anderson twitching an eyebrow. (However, this line was removed when this episode was re-released in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stargate SG-1: Children of the Gods – Final Cut review|url=http://www.reviewstream.com/reviews/?p=99007|publisher=ReviewStream.com|accessdate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ) There is a blooper reel where Tapping's character, who is trapped with Anderson's character on a glacier, begins ranting about how "we got belt buckles, shoelaces and a piece of gum. Build a nuclear reactor, for cryin' out loud! You used to be MacGyver, MacGadget, MacGimmick... now you're Mr. MacUseless... Dear God, I'm stuck on a glacier with MacGyver!"  Later, various episodes establish that Jack O'Neill (Anderson's character) has an immense love of the cartoon series "The Simpsons".

In 2001, the band [[They Might Be Giants]] released a song titled "All MacGyver on It" on the [[Japan]]ese version of their album ''Mink Car''.

In 2006, Anderson appeared in a MasterCard television commercial for [[Super Bowl XL]]. In it, he manages to cut the ropes binding him to a chair using a pine tree air freshener, uses an ordinary [[sock|tube sock]] as the [[pulley]] for a [[zip-line]], and somehow repairs and [[hot-wiring|hot-wires]] a nonfunctional truck using a paper clip, ballpoint pen, rubber band, tweezers, nasal spray, and a turkey baster. In contrast to previous MasterCard commercials showing people making extravagant purchases to accomplish some mundane task, MacGyver is portrayed as escaping from some sort of deathtrap using less than $20 worth of common household items. The commercial ends by showing him purposefully buying an assortment of such things at a department store with his credit card (as a tongue-in-cheek explanation for how he seems to always have items he needs on hand no matter where he goes). Although the commercial implies that Anderson is portraying MacGyver, he is not identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tow.com/2006/02/05/macgyver-mastercard-commercial/|title=MacGyver MasterCard Commercial|publisher=Tow.com|date=December 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an August 2007 survey commissioned by the McCormick Tribune Foundation, Americans polled voted MacGyver as the favorite fictional hero they would want to have if they were ever caught in an emergency.&lt;ref name="macgyver2007"&gt;{{cite web | title= MacGyver is favorite disaster hero | url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/macgyver-trumps-jack-bauer/2007/09/13/1189276851582.html | work= The Sydney Morning Herald | date= September 13, 2007 | accessdate=September 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[NBC]] sketch series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' featured a parody of ''MacGyver'' called "[[MacGruber]]" with [[Will Forte]] as the title character. The intros for these skits featured scenes from the ''MacGyver'' series. MacGruber and cohorts are always locked in a control room of some type with a bomb set to go off in 15–20 seconds. MacGruber has his co-stars hand him components to defuse the device, but something inevitably gets in the way (either situational, because MacGruber himself interferes, or because no one wants to touch what he has asked for) and the bomb detonates. In the March 7, 2009 installment of the "MacGruber" sketches, it was revealed that MacGyver is MacGruber's long-lost father. In 2010 the character was featured in its own R-rated spinoff movie, entitled ''[[MacGruber (film)|MacGruber]]''; the film was released by [[Rogue Pictures]].

In February 2008, the science series ''[[MythBusters]]'' featured a [[MythBusters (2008 season)#Episode 100 – "MacGyver Special"|''MacGyver'' special]] which tested several of MacGyver's tactics. Of the seven tested only one (an ultralight plane can make a safe landing while gliding) was confirmed. In the final season's "[[MythBusters (2016 season)#Episode 238 – "The Explosion Special"|Explosion Special]]" they busted filling a mail truck containing a bomb with wet concrete to contain the blast.

In 2008, the phrase "What would MacGyver do?" was used in a New Zealand television commercial for Gregg's "freestyle cooking" range of herbs and spices. The commercial featured the word MacGyver unfolding like a puzzle with a potato peeler and chopping knife opening out like the blades of a [[Swiss Army knife]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macgyveronline.com/pages/wwmd.html MacGyver Online web site] has this commercial to watch online&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' episode "Emancipation" has Daisy Johnson telling Lincoln Campbell (twice) that he has to "MacGyver" the door of his holding room to escape.

[["Weird Al" Yankovic]] has twice referenced the series in his songs – "Couch Potato" and "Handy" both mention MacGyver.

==="MacGyver" and "MacGyverism"===
MacGyver employs his resourcefulness and his knowledge of chemistry, physics,&lt;ref name=britton&gt;Britton, Wesley, ''Spy Television'', Praeger/Greenwood, {{ISBN|0-275-98163-0}}, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; technology, and sportsmanship to resolve what are often life-or-death crises. He creates inventions from simple items to solve these problems. These inventions became synonymous with the character and were called MacGyverisms by fans.&lt;ref name=rich&gt;Rich, John, 2006, ''Warm Up the Snake: A Hollywood Memoir'', {{ISBN|0-472-11578-2}}, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; MacGyver was unlike secret agents in other television series and films because, instead of relying on high-tech weapons and tools, he carried only a [[Swiss Army knife]] and [[duct tape]] but never a gun.&lt;ref name=britton /&gt;

This also led to the verb, "to MacGyver". "MacGyverism" was first used by Joanne Remmings (played by [[Pamela Bowen]]) in the third episode of Season 2. When MacGyver introduces himself to her, she uses the term in a manner that suggests other people had used it before:&lt;ref&gt;Season 2, Episode 3 – "[[Twice Stung]]". Her phrasing suggests it's a popular term to those who know of MacGyver's track record, although MacGyver himself was unaware of the term.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|quote=Oh I've heard about you! You're the guy who does the whatchamacallits, you know, ''MacGyverisms''; turns one thing into another?}}

In a 1989 interview with Richard Dean Anderson, [[Arsenio Hall]] said that he had heard the word ''MacGyver'' used as a verb meaning "to do the impossible." Anderson then used it as an adjective meaning "impossible." Anderson stated that his show's producers had just missed out on getting the word "MacGyverism" entered into the [[Webster's Dictionary]] and that "we" intended to try to get it in the next update.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macgyveronline.com/pages/video11.html Arsenio Hall interview of Richard Dean Anderson]. ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]''. 1989. MacGyver Online. accessed July 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The word "MacGyver" however entered the [[Oxford Dictionaries]] in 2015 as a verb meaning "make or repair (an object) in an improvised or inventive way, making use of whatever items are at hand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/macgyver |title=MacGyver |work=Oxford Dictionaries }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34075407 |title=How 'MacGyver' became a verb|date= August 27, 2015|work=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show's writers based MacGyver's inventions on items they found on location, concepts from scientific advisers John Koivula and Jim Green, and real events.&lt;ref name=britton /&gt; The show offered a monetary prize to people who sent good ideas for the show. A young fan suggested that MacGyver could patch up a vehicle's radiator by cracking an egg into it. The episode "Bushmaster" was constructed around this trick, and the fan was rewarded (producer Henry Winkler said in a 2005 NPR interview that this was his favorite "MacGyverism"). Although staff read every letter, few usable ideas were obtained in this way.&lt;ref name=rich /&gt;

==2016 CBS reboot series==
{{main|MacGyver (2016 TV series)}}
In October 2015, the original series' executive producer, Henry Winkler, signed on to produce a reboot series with [[James Wan]] and [[R. Scott Gemmill]] for [[CBS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/09/macgyver-series-remake-cbs-james-wan-henry-winkler-1201566340/|title='MacGyver' Series Remake Set At CBS, James Wan &amp; Henry Winkler Producing.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, [[Lucas Till]] was announced as the new MacGyver, Joshua Boone as Gunner, MacGyver's best friend from high school, former ''[[CSI:Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' star [[George Eads]] as Lincoln (later renamed as Jack Dalton), a man who could easily be written off as an eccentric conspiracy theorist but is a legitimate government employee with great capability for compassion, [[Addison Timlin]] as Mickey, an app developer who is aggressively progressive in her political views, with a soft spot for MacGyver, and [[Michelle Krusiec]] as Agent Croix, Lincoln’s sister who works for the [[Department of Homeland Security]].

In May 2016, the network picked up the series, with co-creator/exec producer [[Peter Lenkov]] to serve as showrunner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/05/training-day-bull-macgyver-the-great-indoors-matt-leblanc-jason-katims-cbs-series-1201755376/|title=‘Training Day’, ‘Bull’, ‘MacGyver’, ‘The Great Indoors’, Matt LeBlanc Comedy &amp; Jason Katims Drama Picked Up By CBS|publisher=Deadline|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=May 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 18, 2016, CBS indicated that the new series would air in late 2016.&lt;ref name="MacGyverFall"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tvline.com/2016/05/18/macgyver-trailer-cbs-fall-video/|title= MacGyver: CBS Unveils Trailer for Upcoming Reboot of '80s Series|publisher=TV Line|last=Ianucci|first=Rebecca|date=May 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, however, the network scrapped the pilot and set Wan to direct the new pilot episode with Till and Eads remaining in the cast. [[Justin Hires]] was cast as Wilt Bozer, MacGyver's roommate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/james-wan-direct-cbs-rebooted-903740|title=James Wan to Direct CBS' Rebooted 'MacGyver' Pilot|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|date=June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/06/macgyver-rush-hour-justin-hires-cast-cbs-series-reboot-1201771878/|title=‘MacGyver’: ‘Rush Hour’s Justin Hires Cast In CBS Series Reboot|publisher=Deadline|last=Andreeva |first=Nellie|date=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that [[Sandrine Holt]] is cast as Patricia Thornton, an ex-field agent who is now director of operations for the Department of External Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/macgyver-casts-sandrine-holt-as-series-regular-1201815294/|title=‘MacGyver’ Casts Sandrine Holt as Series Regular|publisher=Variety|last=Prudom|first=Laura|date=July 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that [[Tristin Mays]] was cast as Riley Davis, a highly unpredictable computer hacker with a chip on her shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/macgyver-tristan-mays-cast-cbs-1201824668/|title=Tristin Mays Joins ‘MacGyver’ Completing Cast of CBS Reboot|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|last=Wagmeister|first=Elizabeth|date=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Wan]] thinks they were lucky to find Lead actor [[Lucas Till]] who is one of the biggest discoveries with the show.

==In other media==

===''MacGyver and the New Citan''===
Anderson reprised his role as MacGyver in September 2012 in a new series of short films, created by [[Mercedes-Benz]] for the launch of their new MPV [[Mercedes-Benz Citan|Citan]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/television/MacGyver-Gets-Comeback-Mercedes-Benz-Web-Episodes-45879.html |title=MacGyver Gets A Comeback In Mercedes-Benz Web Episodes |last=Kasperowicz |first=Leslie |work=Cinema Blend |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518190114/http://www.cinemablend.com/television/MacGyver-Gets-Comeback-Mercedes-Benz-Web-Episodes-45879.html |archivedate=May 18, 2016 |dead-url=no |accessdate=May 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.daimler.com/dcmedia/0-921-656174-1-1521664-1-0-1-0-0-1-13457-656174-0-1-0-0-0-0-0.html |title=MacGyver and the new Citan: every hero needs a strong partner |publisher=[[Daimler AG]] |location=Stuttgart |date=August 14, 2012 |accessdate=May 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episodes were shot in [[Johannesburg, South Africa]], in July 2012.

In the short film series, MacGyver now runs a mobile repair service with his daughter Caitlin. They go to a high-rise building to fix a faulty air conditioning system when terrorists incapacitate all of the occupants with knockout gas and take over the building. Despite his age, MacGyver uses his skills to overcome the knockout gas and follow the terrorists, discovering a military bunker below the basement. After the terrorists load a large crate into a van, MacGyver follows them in his Citan work van to a shipping yard, where the terrorists begin an exchange deal with another party. Inside the crate is a robot soldier, which goes haywire and kills everyone in sight. MacGyver then runs over the robot with his Citan and deactivates it to save the day.

===Comic book===
In 2012, [[Tony Lee]] joined with MacGyver creator [[Lee David Zlotoff]] and technical advisor John Potter to write a 5-part comic book series of MacGyver titled ''MacGyver: Fugitive Gauntlets''. The story has a contemporary setting but retains all the major elements of the old show, including well known character Pete Thornton and the Phoenix Foundation as well as the much loved narration by the eponymous protagonist and [[MacGyverisms]].  The first issue was released October 10, 2012 with a new issue released each month ending with issue 5 on February 27, 2013.

The comic book was very well received around the world with the first issue selling out within the first two weeks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://macgyveronline.com/news/macgyver-comic-sells-out-in-less-than-2-weeks |title=MacGyver comic sells out in less than 2 weeks |work=MacGyver Online |date=October 31, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801045300/http://macgyveronline.com/news/macgyver-comic-sells-out-in-less-than-2-weeks |archivedate=August 1, 2013 |accessdate=May 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received mostly favorable reviews through major comic book sites. However, the series' lead author, Tony Lee, confirmed in September 2014 that the series in total did not sell well enough to warrant a second series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No more comics planned|url=http://www.macgyveronline.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=7955|publisher=MacGyver Online Forums|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4002">'''Motivating operation''' ('''MO''') is a [[behaviorism|behavioristic]] concept introduced by [[Jack Michael]] in 1982. It is used to explain variations in the effects in the consequences of behavior.  Most importantly, a MO affects how strongly the person is reinforced or punished by the consequences of their behavior. For example, food deprivation is a motivating operation; if a person is hungry, food is strongly reinforcing, but if a person is satiated, food is less reinforcing. &lt;ref&gt;Laraway, S., Snycerski, S., Michael, J., &amp; Poling. (2003). Motivating operations and terms to describe them: some further refinements. Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis. 36. 407-414.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 Laraway suggested subdividing MOs into those that increase the reinforcing or punishing effects of a stimulus, which are termed establishing operations, and MOs that decrease the reinforcing or punishing effects of a stimulus, which are termed abolishing operations.

==Theory==
The concept of motivating operation deals with the observation that behavior depends not only on the stimuli present in the current situation and the organism's past experience with those stimuli, but also on the organism's recent past history of deprivation, satiation, pain, or other such influences. Such a past history can have two effects: it can change the value of a consequence by making it more or less reinforcing, and/or it can change the probability of behaviors that have produced that consequence. For example, food deprivation changes the value of food, making it more reinforcing, and it also evokes learned behaviors that have obtained food. Likewise, food satiation reduces the both the reinforcing effect of food and the probability of food-getting behaviors.

Note that a motivating operation differs from a discriminative stimulus (Sd). A discriminative stimulus signals the availability of reinforcement, while a motivating operation changes the effectiveness of a reinforcer.&lt;ref&gt;Michael, J. (1982) Distinguishing between discriminative and motivational functions of stimuli. Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior. 37. 149-155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine main '''unconditioned''' (i.e. not learned) motivating operations, have been identified in humans. Deprivation of food, water, sleep, activity, or oxygen; becoming too warm or too cold; and increase of a painful stimulus all function as establishing operations for related behaviors, and increase the effect of positive or negative reinforcement related to them. Conversely, being satiated with food, water, sleep, activity, oxygen and sex; getting cooler after being too warm or warmer after too cold; and decrease of a  painful stimulus all function as abolishing operations for related behavior and reinforcement.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Applied Behavior Analysis|last = Cooper|first = John O|publisher = Pearson Education|year = 2007|isbn = 0-13-129327-3|location = Upper Saddle River, NJ, USA|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also '''conditioned''' motivating operations that result from the learning history of the organism. Three kinds of conditioned operations have been identified: a '''surrogate''', '''reflexive''', and '''transitive'''.  A surrogate MO has the same effect as the MO it was paired with when it was learned; a reflexive MO acts as a reinforcement when it is removed; a transitive MO make something else effective as reinforcement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  It should be noted that there is some debate as to whether an organism can be deprived or satiated from conditioned reinforcers.

==Theoretical note==
The concept of motivational operations has been applied to [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]]&lt;ref&gt;Maslow, A. (1943). A theory of human motivation. Psychological Review, Vol 50(4). 370-396. doi: 10.1037/40054346.&lt;/ref&gt; by describing the lower two levels as involving unconditioned MOs and the upper three levels as involving conditioned MOs.

'''Mónica Rey Gutiérrez''' (born 1964) is an [[Afro-Bolivian]] cultural leader and activist whose [[anthropological]] research helped pass legislation for formal recognition of Afro-Bolivians as an ethnic category in the census of the country. After serving as an educator and cultural activist for many years, she went to work in the government. She is currently a supranational delegate in the [[Plurinational Legislative Assembly]] of [[Bolivia]].

==Early life==
Adalberta Mónica Rey Gutiérrez was born on 23 April 1964 in Comunidad Marca, of the [[Nor Yungas Province]], [[La Paz Department, Bolivia]]. She was raised in the Comunidad Santa Ana, near [[Coroico]] by her mother, Florentina Gutiérrez Barra, and step-father, Simeón Rey Barra.{{sfn|Busdiecker (OUP)|2016}}{{sfn|Legislative Assembly of Bolivia|2017}} Rey moved to [[La Paz]] when she was eleven and continued her schooling at the boarding school Hogar y Colegio Ave María. She was the first Afro-Bolivian to graduate with a high school diploma from the school. Rey continued her education at the [[Higher University of San Andrés]] ({{lang-es|Universidad Mayor de San Andrés (UMSA)}})and earned a bachelor’s degree in [[Communication studies|social communications]] in 1997. Her thesis, ''La Saya como medio de comunicación y expresión cultural en la comunidad Afroboliviana'' (Saya as Mode of Communication and Cultural Expression in the Afro-Bolivian Community) was the first substantial work which had been extensively researched which analyzed the Afro-Bolivian segment of the population.{{sfn|Busdiecker (OUP)|2016}} In interviews with community elders, Rey discovered that members of the Yungas communities still had songs and ceremonies performed in African languages.{{sfn|Ceaser|2001|p=3}} The thesis evaluated the importance of ''[[Saya (artform)|saya]]'', a unique song and dance tradition to the identity of Afro-Bolivians, confirming that it was not a musical performance, but an integral part of their cultural expression. It became an important reference for both researchers who followed, and journalists.{{sfn|Busdiecker (OUP)|2016}}

While still in college, Rey emerged as one of the leaders of the identity movement of Afro-Bolivians, which at that time was made up mostly of young people who had moved from the countryside to the capital for education or work. They began performing ''saya'' at public events and gained official recognition of their organization,{{sfn|Busdiecker (OUP)|2016}} the Afro-Bolivian Saya Cultural Movement ({{lang-es|Movimiento Cultural Saya Afroboliviana (MCSA)}}), which was created in 1989 to revive and assert the cultural traditions of Afro-Bolivians.{{sfn|Ceaser|2001|p=3}} One of their first successes was to replace the vernacular way of referencing the people of African descent in Bolivia from being called ''negritos'' (dear/cute little blacks) or ''morenos'' (dark-colored people) to ''Afroboliviano'', recognizing that blacks were a distinct ethnic group but also Bolivian.{{sfn|Busdiecker|2016|p=125}} In 1994, she led a march on the presidential palace to gain recognition for Afro-Bolivians.{{sfn|Ceaser|2001|p=3}} Rey, one of the founders of the organization, served as president of MCSA from 1996 to 2001.{{sfn|Busdiecker (OUP)|2016}}{{sfn|Ceaser|2001|p=3}}   

==Career==
Almost immediately after her graduation, Rey began working with a group of team members on a project sponsored by the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] to conduct research and survey conditions throughout the country effecting the Afro-Bolivian population. Their findings reported as, ''Diagnóstico de la situación del pueblo negro en Bolivia'' (Diagnostic of the Situation of the Black Community in Bolivia), estimated for the first time the size of that segment of the population to be around 20,000. Another booklet, ''El tambor mayor'' (The main drum), written in conjunction with the Fundación Simón y Patiño, was produced in 1998 by Rey, who coordinated a group effort written on the culture and history of Afro-Bolivians. That same year, Rey took a position in the General Directorate of Archaeology and Anthropology, leaving after one year to teach at the {{ill|Franz Tamayo Private University|es|Universidad Privada Franz Tamayo}} (UniFranz). After five years, she left UniFranz and in 2004 began teaching at her alma mater, UMSA.{{sfn|Busdiecker (OUP)|2016}}

Between 1990 and 2009, Rey participated in and led workshops at many international events related to the [[African diaspora]] traveling to [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Honduras]], [[Panama]], [[Peru]], the United States, [[Uruguay]] and [[Venezuela]].{{sfn|Busdiecker (OUP)|2016}} She also served as the Bolivian representative at numerous meetings of African American organizations throughout the continent.{{sfn|Ceaser|2001|p=3}} In 2009, Rey accepted a post in the Ministry of Culture became the Director General of the Fight Against Racism within the Vice-Ministry of Decolonization. The following year, she became an advisor to the Office of the Ministry of Productive Development and Plural Economy{{sfn|Busdiecker (OUP)|2016}} and at the same time, Afro-Bolivians were allowed to participate in the government and as part of the Departmental Council. They formed the National Council of Afro-Bolivians ({{lang-es|Consejo Nacional del Afroboliviano (Conafro)}}) on which Rey served as secretary of communication and international relations.{{sfn|Inarra|2011}}{{sfn|Legislative Assembly of Bolivia|2017}} In 2012, for the first time Bolivians of African descent were enumerated on the national population census as a specific ethnic group. Census data, which counted citizens over age fifteen, showed that the Afro-Bolivian sector represented 16,329 people compared to the 10 million people in the entire population.{{sfn|Busdiecker (OUP)|2016}}

In 2014 Rey became Director General of Consumer Protection in the Ministry of Productive Development and was elected as supranational deputy in the [[Chamber of Deputies]] of the administration of President [[Evo Morales]].{{sfn|Busdiecker (OUP)|2016}} She introduced legislation in 2016 to protect the human and civil rights of the African community in Bolivia including anti-discrimination provisions.{{sfn|''El Diario''|2016}}

Rey has published articles both nationally and internationally in journals as well as having been the subject of interview for other researchers and journalists on Afro-Bolivian themes.{{sfn|Busdiecker (OUP)|2016}} She is one of the few authors who have created major reference works on Afro-Bolivian people.{{sfn|Walker|2001|p=330}}

'''''Nemo iudex in causa sua''''' (or ''nemo iudex in sua causa'') is a [[Latin]] phrase that means, literally, "no-one should be a judge in his own case." It is a principle of [[natural justice]] that no person can judge a case in which they have an interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legal-glossary.org/nemo-judex-in-sua-causa/ |title=Legal definition of Nemo iudex in causa sua |publisher=legal-glossary.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule is very strictly applied to any appearance of a possible bias, even if there is actually none: "Justice must not only be done, but must be seen to be done".&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Sussex Justices, ex parte McCarthy]]'', [1924] 1 KB 256, [1923] All ER 233&lt;/ref&gt;

This principle may also be called:
* ''nemo judex idoneus in propria causa est''
* ''nemo judex in parte sua''
* ''nemo judex in re sua''
* ''nemo debet esse judex in propria causa''
* ''in propria causa nemo judex''

The legal effect of a breach of natural justice is normally to stop the proceedings and render any judgment invalid; it should be quashed or appealed, but may be remitted for a valid re-hearing.

The phrase is credited to Sir [[Edward Coke]] in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/show_me_the_money_states_aba_try_to_figure_out_when_campaign_cash_adds_up ABA Journal,] "Show Me the Money: States, ABA Try to Figure Out When Campaign Cash Leads to a Judge’s Recusal", 1 March 2012 (retrieved 28 June 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is also found in ''The Moral Sayings of Publius Syrus, a Roman Slave'' (1856), by Darius Lyman, Jun., A. M.

"'''No taxation without representation'''" is a [[slogan]] originating during the 1700s that summarized a primary grievance of the [[Colonial history of the United States#British colonies|American colonists]] in the [[Thirteen Colonies]], which was one of the major causes of the [[American Revolution]]. In short, [[Patriot (Revolution)|many in those colonies]] believed that, as they were not directly [[Representation (politics)|represented]] in the distant [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]], any laws it passed affecting the colonists (such as the [[Sugar Act]] and the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]]) were illegal under the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], and were a denial of their [[Rights of Englishmen|rights as Englishmen]].

[[Jonathan Mayhew]], [[Old West Church (Boston, Massachusetts)|Old West Church's]] second Congregational pastor, used the phrase, "no taxation without representation" in a sermon in 1750.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chris Beneke |year=2008 |title=The Critical Turn: Jonathan Mayhew, the British Empire, and the Idea of Resistance in Mid- Eighteenth-Century Boston |journal=Massachusetts Historical Review |volume=10|jstor=25478696 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase revives a sentiment central to the cause of the [[English Civil War]] following the refusal of parliamentarian [[John Hampden]] to pay [[ship money]] tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The English Civil War|page=97

The English Parliament had controlled colonial trade and taxed imports and exports since 1660.&lt;ref&gt;Unger, pg. 87&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1760s, the Americans were being deprived of a historic right.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Miller, ''Origins of the American Revolution''. 1943. pp. 31, 99, 104&lt;/ref&gt;  The English [[Bill of Rights 1689]] had forbidden the imposition of taxes without the consent of Parliament.  Since the colonists had no representation in Parliament, the taxes violated the guaranteed [[Rights of Englishmen]].  Parliament initially contended that the colonists had [[virtual representation]], but the idea "found little support on either side of the Atlantic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OBvNHl6UYKsC&amp;pg=PA126|title=Recreating the American Republic|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dunmore Lang]] wrote in 1852, "The person who first suggested the idea [of Parliamentary representation for the colonies] appears to have been Oldmixon, an American annalist of the era of Queen Anne or George I.  It was afterwards put forward with approbation by the celebrated Dr. [[Adam Smith]], and advocated for a time, but afterwards rejected and strongly opposed, by Dr. [[Benjamin Franklin]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://webjournals.ac.edu.au/journals/EB/freedom-and-independence-lang-1852/19-parliamentary-representation/ 1.9 Parliamentary Representation. • E-Books • Webjournals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703184301/http://webjournals.ac.edu.au/journals/EB/freedom-and-independence-lang-1852/19-parliamentary-representation/ |date=2013-07-03 }}.

Jared Ingersoll Snr., colonial agent for Connecticut, wrote to his American colleague, the Royal Governor of Connecticut Thomas Fitch, that following Isaac Barre's famous Parliamentary speech against the Stamp Act in 1764, Richard Jackson, M.P., supported Barre and other pro-American M.P.s by producing before the House copies of earlier Acts of Parliament that had admitted Durham and Chester seats upon their petitions for representation. The argument was put forward in Parliament that America ought to have representatives on these grounds too.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iqPdJyMcP4IC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=american+members+of+parliament&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jyjOUM_aOaHK0AXY8ICABw&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=american%20members%20of%20parliament&amp;f=false Prologue To Revolution: Sources And Documents On The Stamp Act Crisis, 1764–1766].

==== The Knox-Burke debates ====
[[William Knox (British politician)|William Knox]], an aide of George Grenville, pamphleteer and subsequent Irish [[Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies]], received an appointment in 1756 to the American provinces, and after his return to London in 1761, he recommended the creation of a colonial aristocracy and colonial representation in the British Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryireland.com/biography/WilliamKnox.php William Knox]. Libraryireland.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-15.&lt;/ref&gt; He was shortly afterwards appointed agent for Georgia and East Florida, a post which he forfeited by writing in favour of the Stamp Act. In his Grenville-backed pamphlet of 1769, ''The Controversy between Great Britain and her Colonies Reviewed'', Knox suggested that colonial representatives might have been offered seats in the British Parliament if they had sought such representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/williamknoxoname00knox#page/18/mode/2up/search/offer |title=William Knox on American taxation, 1769 |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Knox submitted that, &lt;blockquote&gt;whilst [the radical colonists] exclaim against Parliament for taxing them when they are not represented, they candidly declare they will not have representatives [in Parliament] lest they should be taxed...The truth...is that they are determined to get rid of the jurisdiction of Parliament...and they therefore refuse to send members to that assembly lest they should preclude themselves of [the] plea [that Parliament's] legislative acts...are done without their consent; which, it must be confessed, holds equally good against all laws, as against taxes...The colony advocates...tell us, that by refusing to accept our offer of representatives they...mean to avoid giving Parliament a pretence for taxing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/williamknoxoname00knox#page/18/mode/2up/search/representatives |title=William Knox on American taxation, 1769 |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Edmund Burke responded to Knox, who had drawn up ''The Controversy between Great Britain and her Colonies Reviewed'' as well as ''The Present State of the Nation'' (1768) under the supervision of George Grenville, by opining in his political tract ''Observations on a Late State of the Nation'' (1769), &lt;blockquote&gt;NOW comes [Knox's] American representation...Is not the reader a little astonished at the proposal of an American representation from that quarter [of Grenville's]? It is proposed merely as a project of speculative improvement; not from the necessity in the case, not to add any thing to the authority of parliament: but that we may afford a greater attention to the concerns of the Americans, and give them a better opportunity of stating their grievances, and of obtaining redress. I am glad to find the author has at length discovered that we have not given a sufficient attention to their concerns, or a proper redress to their grievances. His great friend [Grenville] would once have been exceedingly displeased with any person, who should tell him, that he did not attend sufficiently to those concerns. He thought he did so, when he regulated the colonies over and over again: he thought he did so, when he formed two general systems of revenue; one of port-duties, and the other of internal taxation. These systems supposed, or ought to suppose, the greatest attention to, and the most detailed information of, all their affairs. However, by contending for the American representation, he seems at last driven virtually to admit, that great caution ought to be used in the exercise of all our legislative rights over an object so remote from our eye, and so little connected with our immediate feelings; that in prudence we ought not to be quite so ready with our taxes, until we can secure the desired representation in parliament. Perhaps it may be some time before this hopeful scheme can be brought to perfect maturity; although the author seems to be no wise aware of any obstructions that lie in the way of it.&lt;ref name="quod.lib.umich.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/004899151.0001.000?rgn=main;view=fulltext;q1=american+representatives |title=The political tracts and speeches: of Edmund Burke, Esq.

While Knox, Grenville and Burke were not necessarily opposed in principle to direct colonial representation in Parliament, Grenville nonetheless conjectured that Parliament retained a constitutional right to virtually represent the colonial subjects.&lt;ref name="quod.lib.umich.edu" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page 69 – {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6K8pM6Z3BdAC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=grenville+knox+virtual+representation#v=onepage&amp;q=grenville%20knox%20virtual%20representation&amp;f=false|title=The Constitutional Origins of the American Revolution|isbn=978-1-139-49293-5|author1=Greene|first1=Jack P|date=2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''On the American Taxation'' ====
Burke supported the doctrine of virtual representation in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Page 58 – {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xH2lEKIZ4yMC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=burke+virtual+representation+philip+reid#v=onepage&amp;q=burke%20virtual%20representation%20philip%20reid&amp;f=false|title=The Concept of Representation in the Age of the American Revolution|isbn=978-0-226-70898-0|author1=Reid|first1=John Phillip|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet in his Parliamentary speech of 1774, entitled ''On American Taxation'', Burke responded to the suggestion that America was virtually represented in Parliament by remarking, &lt;blockquote&gt;What! does the electric force of virtual representation more easily pass over the Atlantic than pervade Wales, which lies in your neighborhood? or than Chester and Durham, surrounded by abundance of representation that is actual and palpable? But, Sir, your ancestors thought this sort of virtual representation, however ample, to be totally insufficient for the freedom of the inhabitants of territories that are so near, and comparatively so inconsiderable. How, then, can I think it sufficient for those which are infinitely greater, and infinitely more remote?  You will now, Sir, perhaps imagine that I am on the point of proposing to you a scheme for a representation of the colonies in Parliament. Perhaps I might be inclined to entertain some such thought; but a great flood stops me in my course. Opposuit Natura. I cannot remove the eternal barriers of the creation. The thing, in that mode, I do not know to be possible. As I meddle with no theory, I do not absolutely assert the impracticability of such a representation; but I do not see my way to it; and those who have been more confident have not been more successful...My resolutions, therefore, mean to establish the equity and justice of a taxation of America by grant, and not by imposition; to mark the legal competency of the colony assemblies for the support of their government in peace, and for public aids in time of war; to acknowledge that this legal competency has had a dutiful and beneficial exercise, and that experience has shown the benefit of their grants, and the futility of Parliamentary taxation, as a method of supply.&lt;ref name="gutenberg.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/15198/15198-h/15198-h.htm#AMERICAN_TAXATION |title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of Burke's Writings and Speeches, Volume the Second, by Edmund Burke |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Burke apparently qualified such remarks concerning America by stating in the same speech that, &lt;blockquote&gt;The Parliament of Great Britain...is never to intrude into the place of the [provincial legislatures], whilst they are equal to the common ends of their institution. But in order to enable [Parliamentary]...superintendence, her powers must be boundless. The gentlemen who think the powers of Parliament limited may please themselves to talk of requisitions. But suppose the requisitions are not obeyed? What! shall there be no reserved power in the empire, to supply a deficiency which may weaken, divide, and dissipate the whole? We are engaged in waar,—the Secretary of State calls upon the colonies to contribute,—some would do it, I think most would cheerfully furnish whatever is demanded,—one or two, suppose, hang back, and, easing themselves, let the stress of the draft lie on the others,—surely it is proper that some authority might legally say, "Tax yourselves for the common Supply, or Parliament will do it for you." This backwardness was, as I am told, actually the case of Pennsylvania for some short time towards the beginning of the last war, owing to some internal dissensions in that colony. But whether the fact were so or otherwise, the case is equally to be provided for by a competent sovereign power. But then this ought to be no ordinary power, nor ever used in the first instance. This is what I meant, when I have said, at various times, that I consider the power of taxing in Parliament as an instrument of empire, and not as a means of supply.&lt;ref name="gutenberg.org" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== William Pitt the Elder ====
The views of Knox, Grenville and Burke did not go unchallenged: William Pitt was amongst those who disputed that a Parliamentary right or power existed to levy "internal" taxes "for the purposes of raising a revenue" without the consent of actual representatives of the "Commons of America".&lt;ref name="bartleby.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/268/3/23.html |title=II.

==== Colonial spokespersons ====
In 1764, the Massachusetts politician James Otis, Jr., said that, {{quote|When the parliament shall think fit to allow the colonists a representation in the house of commons, the equity of their taxing the colonies, will be as clear as their power is at present of doing it without, if they please...But if it was thought hard that charter privileges should be taken away by act of parliament, is it not much harder to be in part, or in whole, disfranchised of rights, that have been always thought inherent to a British subject, namely, to be free from all taxes, but what he consents to in person, or by his representative? This right, if it could be traced no higher than Magna Charta, is part of the common law, part of a British subjects birthright, and as inherent and perpetual, as the duty of allegiance; both which have been brought to these colonies, and have been hitherto held sacred and inviolable, and I hope and trust ever will. It is humbly conceived, that the British colonists (except only the conquered, if any) are, by Magna Charta, as well entitled to have a voice in their taxes, as the subjects within the realm. Are we not as really deprived of that right, by the parliament assessing us before we are represented in the house of commons, as if the King should do it by his prerogative? Can it be said with any colour of truth or justice, that we are represented in parliament?|sign=James Otis|source=''Rights of British Colonies Asserted''&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.libertyfund.org/files/2335/Otis_RightsBritishColonies1556.pdf The rights of the British Colonies 1556]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Otis, Jr., attended the Continental Congress of 1765 along with other colonial delegates.  The resolutions of the Congress stated that the Stamp Act had "a manifest tendency to subvert the rights and liberties of the colonists" and that "the only Representatives of the People of these Colonies, are Persons chosen therein by themselves, and that no Taxes ever have been, or can be Constitutionally imposed on them, but by their respective Legislature."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1068&amp;Itemid=264 |title=Online Library of Liberty |publisher=Oll.libertyfund.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="avalon.law.yale.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/resolu65.asp |title=Avalon Project – Resolutions of the Continental Congress October 19, 1765 |publisher=Avalon.law.yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, it was declared that, "it is unreasonable and inconsistent with the Principles and Spirit of the British Constitution, for the People of Great-Britain, to grant to his Majesty the Property of the Colonists."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="avalon.law.yale.edu" /&gt;

Daniel Dulany, Jr., of Maryland, wrote in 1765 that, "the Impropriety of a Taxation by the British Parliament...[is proven by] the Fact, that not one inhabitant in any Colony is, or can be actually or virtually represented by the British House of Commons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xGsBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=daniel+dulany+impropriety#v=onepage&amp;q=daniel%20dulany%20impropriety&amp;f=false|title=Considerations on the propriety of imposing taxes in the British colonies, for the purpose of raising a revenue, by act of parliament [by D.

In 1766, Benjamin Franklin told the House of Commons that, "an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/268/8/10.html |title=I.

==== Heightening of tensions ====
The Americans rejected the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]] brought in by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[George Grenville]], and violently rejected the remaining tax on [[tea]] [[import]]s, under the [[Tea Act]] passed in May 1773, at the [[Boston Tea Party]] on December 16, 1773. The Parliament considered this an illegal act because they believed it undermined the authority of the [[Crown-in-Parliament]]. When the British then used the military to enforce laws that the colonists believed Parliament had passed illegally, the colonists responded by forming [[militia]]s and seized political control of each colony, ousting the [[Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies|royal governor]]s – with the exception of the American-born Royal Governor of Connecticut, John Trumbull, who was allowed to remain as the new Patriot Governor.

The complaint was never officially over the amount of taxation (the taxes were quite low, though [[ubiquitous]]), but always on the political decision-making process by which taxes were decided in [[London]], i.e. without representation for the colonists in [[British Parliament]].

[[Patrick Henry]]'s resolution in the [[Virginia General Assembly|Virginia legislature]] implied that Americans possessed all the rights of Englishmen, that the principle of no taxation without representation was an essential part of the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British Constitution]], and that [[Virginia]] alone had the right to tax Virginians.&lt;ref&gt;Miller p 122–25&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Efforts at conciliation ====

This offer of actual imperial representation was likewise re-stated to the delegates of the colonies via the colonial agents in 1774, according to Connecticut-born Reverend Thomas Bradbury Chandler, in his publication ''A Friendly Address to All Reasonable Americans''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaVbAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=snippet&amp;q=house&amp;f=false|title=A Friendly Address to All Reasonable Americans, on the Subject of Our ...|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1775, Britain passed the [[Conciliatory Resolution]] which ended taxation for any colony which satisfactorily provided for the imperial defence and the upkeep of imperial officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycentral.com/documents/North.html |title=Lord North's Conciliatory Resolution [February 27, 1775&amp;#93; |publisher=Historycentral.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Had they, like the County and City of Chester, represented, that "for lack of Knights and Burgesses to represent them in the High Court of Parliament, they had been oftentimes TOUCHED and GRIEVED with Acts and Statutes made within the said Court, derogatory to their most ancient jurisdictions, liberties and privileges, and prejudicial to their quietness, rest and peace;" this Country [of Britain] would, I am persuaded, have no objection to their being represented in her Parliament... If they are not madly bent on independence, let them propose the conditions on which they wish to continue as subjects...The Legislature of this Kingdom cannot possibly depart from any part of its supremacy over the Colonies; but it is in the power of the Colonies to share in that supremacy. If they complain of being taxed without having the privilege of sending Members to Parliament, let them be represented. Nay, more: Let their representation increase in proportion to the Revenue they shall furnish. If they wish rather to vote their QUOTA towards the general supply, through their own General Courts and Assemblies, the resolution of Parliament on that subject is still open to their choice. But, as long as they assume the language of a Sovereign State, this Kingdom can enter into no negociation [sic], can meet no compromise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/004772194.0001.000/1:2?firstpubl1=1700;firstpubl2=1800;rgn=div1;sort=occur;subview=detail;type=simple;view=fulltext;q1=american+representatives |title=The rights of Great Britain asserted against the claims of America: being an answer to the declaration of the General Congress |publisher=Quod.lib.umich.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/rightsofgreatbri00macp |title=The rights of Great Britain asserted against the claims of America: being an answer to the Declaration of the general Congress : Macpherson, James, 1736–1796 : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The noted economist Adam Smith seconded this view in his famous 1776 publication ''Wealth of Nations'' when he recommended the Americans "to send fifty or sixty new representatives to Parliament" on the basis of the amount of taxes they would contribute to the Imperial coffers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adam Smith |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/smith-adam/works/wealth-of-nations/book04/ch07c-2.htm |title=Wealth of Nations  Bk 4 Chpt 07 (III p.2) |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in October 1776 to Lord North in ''Strictures upon the Declaration of the Congress'' of the recent Declaration of Independence, and particularly of James Otis, Jr.'s pamphlet ''Rights of the British Colonies'' and its endorsement by the Massachusetts Assembly, Governor Thomas Hutchinson said, &lt;blockquote&gt;The Assembly of Massachusetts Bay, therefore, was the first that took any publick of the [Sugar] Act, and the first which ever took exception to the right of Parliament to impose Duties or Taxes on the Colonies, whilst they had no representatives in the House of Commons. This they did in a letter to their Agent in the summer of 1764, which they took care to print and publish before it was possible for him to receive it. And in this letter they recommend to him a pamphlet, wrote by one of their members, in which there are proposals for admitting representatives from the Colonies to fit in the House of Commons. I have this special reason, my Lord, for taking notice of this Act of the Massachusetts Assembly; that though an American representation is thrown out as an expedient which might obviate the objections to Taxes upon the Colonies, yet it was only intended to amuse the authority in England; and as soon as it was known to have its advocates here [in London], it was renounced by the colonies, and even by the Assembly of the Colony which first proposed it, as utterly impracticable."&lt;ref name="oll.libertyfund.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutchinson 1776" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Indeed, the resolves of the Continental Congresses of both 1765 and 1774 declared that imperial representation was too impractical on the footing that "local and other circumstances, cannot properly be represented in the British parliament".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/resolves.asp |title=Avalon Project – Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress |publisher=Avalon.law.yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The British Government, similarly, does not appear to have formally requested discussions with the Americans concerning the issue of Parliamentary seats until 1778.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=550146|title=Chatham and the Representation of the Colonies in the Imperial Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zqw3ou3i1McC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false John Phillip Reid, ''The Constitutional History of the American Revolution: The Authority of Law'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2003)]&lt;/ref&gt;  In that year "the commissioners of the king of Great Britain," known as the Carlisle Peace Commission of 1778, made an offer to the Congress of "a reciprocal deputation of an agent or agents from the different states, who shall have the privilege of a seat and voice in the parliament of Great Britain".&lt;ref name="teachingamericanhistory.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Phillip Reid, ''The Constitutional History of the American Revolution: The Authority of Law'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2003), p. 131-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Virtual representation ==
{{Main article|Virtual representation}}

In Britain, representation was highly limited due to unequally distributed voting constituencies and property requirements; only 3% of the population could vote and they were often controlled by local gentry.  This meant that spurious arguments had come to be employed in Britain to try to explain away and cover up the iniquities in its political life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McGee|first=Michael C.|title=The Rhetorical Process in Eighteenth Century England|url=http://mcgeefragments.net/OLD/rhetorical_process_england.htm |accessdate=March 18, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515204305/http://mcgeefragments.net/OLD/rhetorical_process_england.htm |archivedate=May 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/struggle_democracy/getting_vote.htm |title=Exhibitions &amp;#124; Citizenship &amp;#124; Struggle for democracy |publisher=The National Archives |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller p 212&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore the [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]] tried to argue that the colonists had [[virtual representation]] in their interests.  In the winter of 1764–65, George Grenville, and his secretary Thomas Whately, invented the doctrine of 'virtual representation' in an attempt extend the scope of such unjust arguments to America, and thereby attempt to legitimise the pernicious policies of the Stamp Act.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 13: Law and the Origins of the American Revolution – {{cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Law in America, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KeEi14czrnoC&amp;pg=PA454&amp;dq=whately+virtual+representation#v=onepage&amp;q=whately%20virtual%20representation&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-521-80305-2|author1=Grossberg|first1=Michael|last2=Tomlins|first2=Christopher|date=2008-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Debating the Issues in Colonial Newspapers: Primary Documents on Events of ..|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bm6kNpvnnhgC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;lpg=PA205&amp;dq=thomas+whately+virtual+representation+secretary+grenville#v=onepage&amp;q=thomas%20whately%20virtual%20representation%20secretary%20grenville&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-313-30982-3|author1=Copeland|first1=David A|date=2000-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 5: Transformation – {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=p6-tKuFD1KsC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=virtual+representation+american+revolution#v=onepage&amp;q=virtual%20representation%20american%20revolution&amp;f=false|title=THE IDEOLOGICAL ORIGINS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION|isbn=978-0-674-07666-2|author1=Bailyn|first1=Bernard|date=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In English history, "no taxation without representation" was an old principle and meant that Parliament had to pass all taxes. At first, the "representation" was held to be one of land, but, by 1700, this had shifted to the notion that, in Parliament, all British subjects had a "virtual representation." "We virtually and implicitly allow the institutions of any government of which we enjoy the benefit and solicit the protection," declared [[Samuel Johnson]] in his political pamphlet ''Taxation No Tyranny''. He rejected the plea that the colonists, who had no vote, were unrepresented. "They are represented," he said, "by the same virtual representation as the greater part of England."  However, the tradition of greater democracy amongst Americans gave impetus to the well-founded charge, voiced by Britons and colonists alike, that virtual representation was "sophistry" and "a mere Cob-web, spread to catch the unwary, and intangle [''sic''] the weak."&lt;ref&gt;Page 7 – {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xGsBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=daniel+dulany+cob-web,+spread+to+catch+the+unwary#v=onepage&amp;q=daniel%20dulany%20cob-web%2C%20spread%20to%20catch%20the%20unwary&amp;f=false|title=Considerations on the propriety of imposing taxes in the British colonies …|author1=Dulany|first1=Daniel|year=1765}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page 82 – {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jnNbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=sophistry+virtual+representation+british#v=onepage&amp;q=sophistry%20virtual%20representation%20british&amp;f=false|title=A Letter to the Right Honourable the Earl of Hilsborough, on the …, Volume 3|year=1769}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The colonial insistence on direct representation as opposed to virtual representation has thus been seen by later commentators to have "usher[ed] in a profound political and social revolution, which rooted out most of the remaining traces of monarchic rule and feudalism inherited from the only partially complete English bourgeois revolution. The Americans carried through the bourgeois democratic revolution on a scale never before seen in history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marxist.com/class-struggle-and-the-american-revolution.htm|title=Class Struggle and the American Revolution|work=In defense of Marxism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colonial reactions ===
Virtual representation was wholly rejected in the colonies also  who said the "virtual" was a cover for [[political corruption]] and was irreconcilable with their belief that government derives its just powers from the [[consent of the governed]].  In 1765, the American lawyer and politician James Otis, Jr., responded to Soame Jenyns' ''The Objections to the Taxation of Our American Colonies, by the Legislature of Great Britain, Briefly Considered''.&lt;ref name="files.libertyfund.org"&gt;[http://files.libertyfund.org/files/2336/Otis_Considerations1555_Bk.pdf Considerations on behalf of the colonists in a letter to a noble Lord]&lt;/ref&gt;  Otis' own publication was entitled ''Considerations on Behalf of the Colonists, in a Letter to a Noble Lord''.&lt;ref name="files.libertyfund.org" /&gt;  He wrote in it, "To what purpose is it to ring everlasting changes to the colonists on the cases of Manchester, Birmingham and Sheffield, who return no members?  If those now so considerable places are not represented, they ought to be."&lt;ref name="files.libertyfund.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page 169 – {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=p6-tKuFD1KsC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=virtual+representation+american+revolution#v=onepage&amp;q=virtual%20representation%20american%20revolution&amp;f=false|title=The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution|isbn=978-0-674-07666-2|author1=Bailyn|first1=Bernard|date=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing in his 1763 publication ''The Rights of the British Colonies Asserted and Proved'', Otis declared that,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Every British subject born on the continent of America, or in any other of the British dominions, is by the law of God and nature, by the common law, and by act of parliament, (exclusive of all charters from the Crown) entitled to all the natural, essential, inherent and inseparable rights of our fellow subjects in Great Britain. Among those rights...which it is humbly conceived no man or body of men, not excepting the parliament, justly, equitably and consistently with their own rights and the constitution, can take away...[are that the] supreme and subordinate powers of the legislation should be free and sacred in the hands where the community have once rightfully placed them...[that the] supreme national legislative cannot be altered justly ’till the commonwealth is dissolved, nor a subordinate legislative taken away without forfeiture or other good cause. Nor then can the subjects in the subordinate government be reduced to a state of slavery, and subject to the despotic rule of others...Even when the subordinate right of legislature is forfeited, and so declared, this cannot affect the natural persons either of those who were invested with it, or the inhabitants, so far as to deprive them of the rights of subjects and of men — The colonists will have an equitable right notwithstanding any such forfeiture of charter, to be represented in Parliament, or to have some new subordinate legislature among themselves. It would be best if they had both...[Furthermore, the right of every British subject is that the] supreme power cannot take from any man any part of his property, without his consent in person, or by representation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|author=Bruce Frohnen |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=669&amp;chapter=206126&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 |title=The American Republic: Primary Sources – Online Library of Liberty |publisher=Oll.libertyfund.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Otis simultaneously refuted, in ''The Rights of the British Colonies Asserted and Proved'', a contemporary argument that attempted to rationalise virtual representation on the basis of the [[Colonial agent|colonial agents']] alleged influence on British policy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;  "As to the colonists being represented by the provincial agents," he wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;I know of no power ever given them but to appear before his Majesty, and his ministry. Sometimes they have been directed to petition the parliament: But they none of them have, and I hope never will have, a power given them, by the colonists, to act as representatives, and to consent to taxes; and if they should make any concessions to the ministry, especially without order, the provinces could not by that be considered as represented in parliament.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Colonists said no man was represented if he were not allowed to vote. Moreover, even "If every inhabitant of America had the requisite freehold," said [[Daniel Dulany the Younger|Daniel Dulany]], "not one could vote, but upon the supposition of his ceasing to become an inhabitant of America, and becoming a resident of Great Britain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tracts of the American Revolution 1763–1776|editor=Merrill, Jensen|page=99|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cfo8b75HOT0C&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=If+every+inhabitant+of+America+had+the+requisite+freehold+not+one+could+vote,+but+upon+the+supposition+of+his+ceasing+to+become+an+inhabitant+of+America,+and+becoming+a+resident+of+Great+Britain.%22#v=onepage&amp;q=If%20every%20inhabitant%20of%20America%20had%20the%20requisite%20freehold%20not%20one%20could%20vote%2C%20but%20upon%20the%20supposition%20of%20his%20ceasing%20to%20become%20an%20inhabitant%20of%20America%2C%20and%20becoming%20a%20resident%20of%20Great%20Britain.%22&amp;f=false|isbn=0-87220-693-9|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colonists and like-minded Britons insisted that representation was achieved only through an assembly of men actually elected by the persons they were intended to represent.&lt;ref name="google1" /&gt;

The argument between the colonies and Parliament sought to resolve how the British 'commoners' of the various part of the Empire were represented most constitutionally&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; – as Daniel Dulaney, an American Loyalist and lawyer, put it "[the] constitutional authority [of Parliament's rights to bind American subjects] depends upon the single question, Whether the Commons of Great-Britain are virtually the representatives of the Commons of America, or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/faculty/gkornbl/H397F10/Dulany-Considerations.htm |title=Considerations on the Propriety of Imposing Taxes in the British Colonies, for the Purpose of Raising a Revenue, by Act of Parliament |publisher=Oberlin.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pitt and Camden ===
The theory of virtual representation was attacked in Britain by [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden]], and his ally [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]].  William Pitt argued in 1766 that the Commons of Britain ought not to tax the '"Commons of America" without gaining consent of their representatives in stating, "even under former arbitrary reigns, Parliaments were ashamed of taxing a people without their consent, and allowed them representatives. Why did [Grenville] confine himself to Chester and Durham? He might have taken a higher example in Wales—Wales, that never was taxed by Parliament till it was incorporated."&lt;ref name="bartleby.com" /&gt; He then said, &lt;blockquote&gt;I am no courtier of America. I stand up for this kingdom. I maintain that the Parliament has a right to bind, to restrain America. Our legislative power over the colonies is sovereign and supreme. When it ceases to be sovereign and supreme, I would advise every gentleman to sell his lands, if he can, and embark for that country. When two countries are connected together like England and her colonies, without being incorporated, the one must necessarily govern. The greater must rule the less. But she must so rule it as not to contradict the fundamental principles that are common to both... let the sovereign authority of this country over the colonies be asserted in as strong terms as can be devised, and be made to extend to every point of legislation whatsoever; that we may bind their trade, confine their manufactures, and exercise every power whatsoever, except that of taking their money out of their pockets without their consent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicpersuasion.org/cbo/chatham/chat08.htm#N_5_ |author=Earl of Chatham|title=Right of Taxing America|date=January 14, 1766 |publisher=Classicpersuasion.org |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his first speeches in Parliament, Lord Camden vigorously attacked the declaratory act which was proposed to mollify the crown on the repeal of the Stamp Tax. After his first affirmation of "no taxation without representation" Camden was attacked by British PM Grenville, [[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas|Chief Justice]] [[James Mansfield]], [[Robert Henley, 1st Earl of Northington]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;16 Parliamentary History of England, London: Hansard, 1813, pp. 170-77. "Lord Northington, leaving the woolsack, commenced in a tone most insulting to the new Peer, and, what was much worse, most insulting to the people of America,--Benjamin Franklin being a listener below the bar … ." 5 Lord Campbell, Lives of the Lord Chancellors, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; He responded:&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he British Parliament have no right to tax the Americans. I shall not consider the Declaratory Bill now lying on your table; for to what purpose, but loss of time, to consider the particulars of a Bill, the very existence of which is illegal, absolutely illegal, contrary to the fundamental laws of nature, contrary to the fundamental laws of this constitution? A constitution grounded on the eternal and immutable laws of nature; a constitution whose foundation and centre is liberty, which sends liberty to every individual who may happen to be within any part of its ample circumference. Nor, my Lords, is the doctrine new, it is as old as the constitution; it grew up with it; indeed it is its support; taxation and representation are inseparably united; God hath joined them, no British parliament can separate them; to endeavour to do it, is to stab our very vitals. … My position is this—I repeat it—I will maintain it to my last hour,—taxation and representation are inseparable; this position is founded on the laws of nature; it is more, it is itself an eternal law of nature; for whatever is a man's own, is absolutely his own; no man has a right to take it from him without his consent, either expressed by himself or representative; whoever attempts to do it, attempts an injury; whoever does it, commits a robbery; he throws down and destroys the distinction between liberty and slavery. Taxation and representation are coeval with and essential to the constitution. … [T]here is not a blade of grass growing in the most obscure corner of this kingdom, which is not, which was not ever, represented since the constitution began; there is not a blade of grass, which when taxed, was not taxed by the consent of the proprietor. … I can never give my assent to any bill for taxing the American colonies, while they remain unrepresented; for as to the distinction of a virtual representation, it is so absurd as not to deserve an answer; I therefore pass it over with contempt. The forefathers of the Americans did not leave their native country, and subject themselves to every danger and distress, to be reduced to a state of slavery: they did not give up their rights; they looked for protection, and not for chains, from their mother country; by her they expected to be defended in the possession of their property, and not to be deprived of it: for, should the present power continue, there is nothing which they can call their own; or, to use the words of Mr. Locke, ‘What property have they in that, which another may, by right, take, when he pleases, to himself?’"&lt;ref&gt;16 Parliamentary History of England, London: Hansard, 1813, pp. 177-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In an appearance before Parliament in January, 1766, former Prime Minister [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The idea of a virtual representation of America in this House is the most contemptible that ever entered into the head of a man. It does not deserve a serious refutation. The Commons of America, represented in their several assemblies, have ever been in possession of the exercise of this their constitutional right, of giving and granting their own money. They would have been slaves if they had not enjoyed it.&lt;ref&gt;Walford Davis Green, ''William Pitt, Earl of Chatham and the Growth and Division of the British Empire, 1708–1778.'' 1901. p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Grenville responded to Pitt, saying the disturbances in America "border on open rebellion; and if the doctrine I have heard this day be confirmed, nothing can tend more directly to produce a revolution." External and internal taxes are the same, argued Grenville.&lt;ref&gt;sFor legal questions surrounding the constitutional nature of the Imperial Crown-in-Parliament's right to legislate and tax for the British Isles and Empire, and the colonies' chartered rights to legislate and tax themselves see {{Cite journal

[[File:No tuition without representation Shimer College.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shimer College]] student holds "No tuition without representation" sign during protest over school governance in 2010.]]
In the 1860s, [[suffragette]] [[Sarah E. Wall]] of [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] invoked the principle of "no taxation without representation", initiating an anti-tax protest in which she encouraged women not to pay taxes until they were [[Women's suffrage in the United States|granted the right to vote]]. Soon after she began this movement, the Worcester city tax collector sued Wall for refusing to pay taxes, and the case reached the [[Massachusetts Supreme Court]] in 1863. In "Wheeler v. Wall," the court ruled against Wall and held that despite not having the right to vote, women are still obligated to meet their tax burden. Even still, Wall refused to cooperate with the collector, and as a result, officers seized and sold her property in order to raise the money necessary to meet her tax obligation. After several years, Wall's inexorability eventually prevailed, as the collector began to ignore Wall and allow her to abstain from paying taxes.&lt;ref name=UMKC&gt;{{cite web|title=Address of Susan B. Anthony|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/anthony/anthonyaddress.html|work=University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884, [[Susan B. Anthony]] cited Wall's audacity and willingness to stand up for women's suffrage, stating, "for the last twenty-five years, [she] has resisted the tax gatherer when he came around. I want you to look at her. She looks very harmless, but she will not pay a dollar of tax. She says when the Commonwealth of [[Massachusetts]] will give her the right of representation she will pay her taxes."&lt;ref name=Sven&gt;{{cite web|title=Debate on Woman Suffrage in the Senate of the United States, 2d Session, 49th Congress, December 8, 1886, and January 25, 1887|url=http://www.sveninho.com/book/2259482/Debate-on-Woman-Suffrage-in-the-Senate-of-the-United-States--2d-Session--49th-Congress--December-8--1886--and-January-25--1887/|work=Sven Digital Books|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is also used by other groups in America who pay various types of taxes ([[Sales tax|sales]], [[income tax|income]], [[property tax|property]]) but lack the ability to vote, such as [[Felony|felons]] (who are, in many states, [[Disenfranchisement|barred from voting]]), people who work in one state and live in another (thus having to pay income tax to a state they don't live in), or [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|people under 18]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://16tovote.com/reasons.html Top Reasons National Youth Rights Association of Southeast Florida Wants a Lower Voting Age], 16tovote.com&lt;/ref&gt;

To become citizens of the United States, [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]] most often must be permanent residents for a period of time (usually 5 years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uscis.gov/graphics/services/factsheet/howdoi/B3.pdf |title=USCIS Home Page |publisher=Uscis.gov |accessdate=2011-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925104214/http://www.uscis.gov/graphics/services/factsheet/howdoi/B3.pdf |archivedate=September 25, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Permanent residents must pay taxes on their worldwide income and, in most cases, cannot [[Elections in the United States|vote]]. However, throughout the 19th century, many states did allow immigrants to vote after they had declared their intention to become citizens. This was primarily because these new states were populated in large part by immigrants who had not yet attained citizenship.

In 2009, the phrase "taxation without representation" was also used in the [[Tea Party protests]], where protesters were upset over increased government spending and taxes, and specifically regarding a growing concern amongst the group that the U.S. government is increasingly relying upon a form of taxation without representation through increased regulatory levies and fees which are allegedly passed via unelected government employees who have no direct responsibility to voters and cannot be held accountable by the public through elections.&lt;ref name=foxchicago&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxchicago.com/dpp/news/TeaParty |title=Protestors Gather for Self-Styled Tea Party |publisher=Myfoxchicago.com |date=February 27, 2009 |accessdate=2011-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A modified version of the phrase, "no tuition without representation", is sometimes used in disputes over [[governance in higher education]] in the United States to emphasize student's rights to a voice in institutional decisions.  The term first emerged in a 1977 dispute at [[Union County College]] in New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New Jersey's Union College: A History, 1933–1983|page=232

== Modern use in the United Kingdom ==
British Prime Minister [[John Major]] used a modified version of the quote, with the order reversed, in October 1995, when at the [[United Nations]]'s 50th Anniversary celebrations he said, "It is not sustainable for states to enjoy representation without taxation," in order to criticize the billion-dollar [[arrears]] of the United States' payments to the UN, echoing a statement made the previous month at the opening session of the UN General Assembly by UK Foreign Secretary [[Malcolm Rifkind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/finance/chronol/fin1995.htm |title=Chronology of the United Nations Financial Crisis: 1995 – Global Policy Forum |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |accessdate=2011-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern use in Canada ==
In Canada, [[Québec]] politician [[Gilles Duceppe]], former leader of the [[Bloc Québécois]], has repeatedly cited this phrase in defending the presence of his party in [[Ottawa]]. The Bloc is a [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Québec sovereigntist]] party solely running candidates in Canadian Federal elections in the province of Québec. Duceppe's evocation of the phrase implies that the proponents of Quebec's sovereigntist movement have the right to be represented in the body (which they are), the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian Parliament]], which levies taxes upon them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-bloc-at-20-a-conversation-with-gilles-duceppe/|magazine=Maclean's|date=2010-05-20|title=The Bloc at 20: a conversation with Gilles Duceppe|first=John|last=Geddes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He will usually cite the sentence in its original English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|magazine=L'actualité|date=2005-11-01|first=Micheline|last=Lachance|title=Il fait bouger le Canada|url=http://www.lactualite.com/actualites/politique/il-fait-bouger-le-canada/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8954">'''Normalization''' refers to social processes through which ideas and actions come to be seen as '[[normality (behavior)|normal]]' and become taken-for-granted or 'natural' in everyday life. In [[sociological theory]], normalization appears in two forms.
First, the concept of normalization is found in the work of [[Michel Foucault]], especially ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'', in the context of his account of disciplinary power.  As Foucault used the term, normalization involved the construction of an idealized norm of conduct &amp;ndash; for example, the way a proper soldier ideally should stand, march, present arms, and so on, as defined in minute detail &amp;ndash; and then rewarding or punishing individuals for respectively conforming to or deviating from this ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel, 1990. ''The History of Sexuality, Volume I: An Introduction''. Robert Hurley, trans. New York: Vintage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Mary Louise, 2004. "The Trouble with Normal: Postwar Youth and the Making of Heterosexuality". In Michelle Webber and Kate Bezanson, eds., ''Rethinking Society in the 21st Century: Critical Readings in Sociology''.  Canadian Scholars' Press Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In Foucault's account, normalization was one of an ensemble of tactics for exerting the maximum [[social control]] with the minimum expenditure of force, which Foucault calls "disciplinary power".  Disciplinary power emerged over the course of the 19th century, came to be used extensively in military barracks, hospitals, asylums, schools, factories, offices, and so on, and hence became a crucial aspect of [[social structure]] in modern societies.

Second, [[normalization process theory]]&lt;ref&gt;May C, Mair FS, Finch T, MacFarlane A, Dowrick C, Treweek S, et al. Development of a theory of implementation and integration: Normalization Process Theory. Implementation Science. 2009;4 art 29&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle-range theory]] used mainly in [[medical sociology]] and [[Science, technology and society|science and technology studies]] to provide a framework for understanding the social processes by which new ways of thinking, working and organizing become routinely incorporated in everyday work. Normalization process theory has its roots in empirical studies of [[technological innovation]] in healthcare, and especially in the evaluation of complex [[Health intervention|interventions]].

There are different behavioral attitudes humans accept as normal, such as grief for a loved one, avoiding danger, and not participating in [[cannibalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What's Normal?: Reconciling Biology and Culture|last=Horwitz|first=Allan|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=197|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences of behavior ==
The world is constantly changing and many things can change the situation an individual is in. Many [[Social influence|influences]] such as past experiences, environment, mental strength, physical strength, people, and the media can affect a person's behavior.  A person can decide to let certain things influence them. This will determine if the person is able to make a decision rationally or not. Some people fail to see the effects of their actions after letting influences affect their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://behaviorandmotivation.com/2011/08/21/sources-of-influence-your-life/|title=9 Sources of Influence in Your Life|last=Milford|first=Scott|date=2011-08-21|website=Behavior and Motivation|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mood and emotions ===
People can greatly be affected by their [[Mood (psychology)|mood]]. One's judgement and [[emotional well-being]] is influenced by one's mood. A negative mood can cause someone to be unproductive and it will show in the person's performance. Positive moods can make a person be more active and productive.  If the person is well emotion-wise, they are full of energy and are able to stay positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Boundless|date=2016-05-26|title=How Emotion and Mood Influence Behavior|url=https://www.boundless.com/management/textbooks/boundless-management-textbook/organizational-behavior-5/drivers-of-behavior-44/how-emotion-and-mood-influence-behavior-233-7047/|work=Boundless}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Child development ===
Children are known for developing behaviors based on family, friends and media influences. A child may not know what they were doing is right or wrong. They must be able to learn from experiences if their actions are right or wrong. It is the parent's job to teach the child whether it is socially accepted or not. As the child develops from a child to a young adult, most of their influence will come from their friends. It will become harder for parents to tell how the child behaves as the child grows older.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oureverydaylife.com/normal-child-behavior-development-2386.html|title=Normal Child Behavior &amp; Development|work=Our Everyday Life|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Role models ===
Young adults and teenagers are heavily affected by looking up to [[role model]]s. Young adults are influenced to act, talk, dress and behave similarly to their role models. This can either be a positive or negative for the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reference.com/science/factors-affect-human-behavior-3512986d01e403d4#|title=What are the factors that affect human behavior?|work=Reference|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Looking up to a role model can have positive effects, as may influence young adults to strive for success and it brings the best out of the person to do well. Positive role models are people able to overcome obstacles, inspire others, and achievements of success. However, negative role models may model bad behaviors like bullying, drug usage, and cheating, which may lead to failure rather than success. Young adults may learn to avoid problems rather than solve them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rootsofaction.com/role-models-youth-strategies-success/|title=How Role Models Influence Youth Strategies for Success|date=2014-01-14|newspaper=Roots of Action|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problems with blindly copying a role model is that people start to lose a sense of identity.

== Types of normal behavior ==

=== Grief ===
[[Grief]] is the deep sorrow usually caused by someone's death. It has now become a normal human reaction to a loss of a loved one. It is not uncommon for someone to be in sadness. Many have to deal with [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] with grief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.griefrecoverymethod.com/blog/2013/06/best-grief-definition-you-will-find|title=The Best Grief Definition You Will Find|last=Friedman|first=Russell|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Body markings ===
Body markings such as [[tattoo]]s and [[piercing]]s were once considered unaccepted, many people today use body markings as a form of expression. It is not uncommon to see doctors, lawyers, soldiers, police officers, and other professionals to have them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/anthropology-and-archaeology/customs-and-artifacts/body-marking|title=body-marking facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about body-marking|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Homosexuality ===
During the 1900s [[homosexuality]] was not accepted as a normal behavior and people attracted to the same gender were considered different and were heavily discriminated against. Over the years, it has now been accepted in places such as the United States, Canada and other places around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.norc.org/NewsEventsPublications/PressReleases/Pages/american-acceptance-of-homosexuality-gss-report.aspx|title=Americans Move Dramatically Toward Acceptance of Homosexuality {{!}} NORC.org|website=www.norc.org|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Laughter ===
Laughter signals acceptance and trust in a group. This is often why laughter is contagious, and explains why people are unlikely to laugh alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://listverse.com/2013/07/11/10-human-actions-with-biological-explanations-2/|title=10 Common Human Behaviors Explained With Science|date=2013-07-11|website=Listverse|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of abnormal behavior ==
[[Abnormal behavior]] is broken up to two types: atypical and maladaptive. Atypical behavior is not necessarily harmful, but maladaptive behavior could potentially be harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite work|url=https://www.reference.com/world-view/different-types-abnormal-behaviour-778d1d5311f4dd6f#|title=What are the different types of abnormal behaviour?|work=Reference|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students''''' is an [[aerospace engineering]] textbook by Howard D. Curtis, in its third edition {{as of|2013|lc=y}}.{{r|curtis}} The book provides an introduction to [[orbital mechanics]], while assuming an undergraduate-level background in physics, [[rigid body dynamics]], [[differential equations]], and [[linear algebra]].{{r|hall}}{{r|jablonski}}

Topics covered by the text include a review of [[kinematics]] and [[Newtonian dynamics]], the [[two-body problem]], [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]], [[orbit determination]], [[orbital maneuver]]s, relative motion and [[space rendezvous|rendezvous]], and [[interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary]] trajectories.{{r|jablonski}} The text focuses primarily on orbital mechanics, but also includes material on rigid body dynamics, [[rocket]] vehicle dynamics, and [[attitude control]].{{r|hall}}{{r|jablonski}} [[Control theory]] and [[spacecraft]] [[control system]]s are less thoroughly covered.{{r|jablonski}}

The textbook includes exercises at the end of each chapter, and supplemental material is available online, including [[MATLAB]] code for orbital mechanics projects.{{r|hall}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21634">[[File:Martian face viking cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Satellite photo of a [[mesa]] in the [[Cydonia (region of Mars)|Cydonia region of Mars]], often called the "[[Cydonia (region of Mars)|Face on Mars]]" and cited as evidence of [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] habitation. Subsequent higher-resolution photos from multiple viewpoints demonstrated that the "face" is in fact a natural rock formation.]]
'''Pareidolia''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ær|ɪ|ˈ|d|oʊ|l|i|ə}} {{respell|parr|i|DOH|lee|ə}}) is a psychological phenomenon in which the mind responds to a [[stimulation|stimulus]], usually an image or a sound, by perceiving a familiar pattern where none exists.

Common examples are perceived images of animals, faces, or objects in cloud formations, the [[Man in the Moon]], the [[Moon rabbit]], [[hidden message]]s in recorded music played in reverse or at higher- or lower-than-normal speeds, and hearing indistinct voices in random noise such as that produced by air conditioners or fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nautil.us/blog/why-we-hear-voices-in-random-noise |title=Why we hear voices in random noise |last=Jaekel |first=Philip |date= |website= |publisher=Nautilus |access-date=April 1, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word derives from the Greek words ''[[wikt:para-|para]]'' (παρά, "beside, alongside, instead [of]"&amp;nbsp;— in this context meaning something faulty or wrong) and the noun [[wikt:εἴδωλον|''eidōlon'']] (εἴδωλον "image, form, shape"&amp;nbsp;— the diminutive of ''[[Theory of Forms|eidos]]'').

== Explanations ==
[[File:Emojione BW 1F611.svg|thumb|A simple collection of lines can be quickly perceived as a face, and even be interpreted as expressing a particular emotion]]
Pareidolia can cause people to interpret random images, or patterns of light and shadow, as faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sagan |first=Carl |title=The Demon-Haunted World – Science as a Candle in the Dark |publisher=Random House |year=1995 |location=New York |isbn=0-394-53512-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 [[magnetoencephalography]] study found that objects perceived as faces evoke an early (165 &lt;abbr title="millseconds"&gt;ms&lt;/abbr&gt;) activation of the [[fusiform face area]] at a time and location similar to that evoked by faces, whereas other common objects do not evoke such activation. This activation is similar to a slightly faster time (130 ms) that is seen for images of real faces. The authors suggest that face perception evoked by face-like objects is a relatively early process, and not a late cognitive reinterpretation phenomenon.&lt;ref name="pmid19218867"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hadjikhani |first1=Nouchine |last2=Kveraga |first2=Kestutis |last3=Naik |first3=Paulami |last4=Ahlfors |first4=Seppo P. |title=Early (M170) activation of face-specific cortex by face-like objects |journal=NeuroReport |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=403–7 |year=2009 |pmid=19218867 |pmc=2713437 |doi=10.1097/WNR.0b013e328325a8e1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) study in 2011 similarly showed that repeated presentation of novel visual shapes that were interpreted as meaningful led to decreased fMRI responses for real objects. These results indicate that the interpretation of ambiguous stimuli depends upon processes similar to those elicited by known objects.&lt;ref name="pmid22079921"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Voss |first1=J. L. |last2=Federmeier |first2=K. D. |last3=Paller |first3=K. A. |title=The Potato Chip Really Does Look Like Elvis! Neural Hallmarks of Conceptual Processing Associated with Finding Novel Shapes Subjectively Meaningful |journal=Cerebral Cortex |volume=22 |issue=10 |pages=2354–64 |year=2012 |pmid=22079921 |pmc=3432238 |doi=10.1093/cercor/bhr315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These studies help to explain why people identify a few circles and a line as a "face" so quickly and without hesitation. [[Cognition|Cognitive processes]] are activated by the "face-like" object, which alert the observer to both the emotional state and [[identity (philosophy)|identity]] of the subject, even before the conscious mind begins to process or even receive the information.  A "stick figure face", despite its simplicity, can convey mood information, and be drawn to indicate emotions such as happiness or anger.  This robust and subtle capability is hypothesized to be the result of eons of natural selection favoring people most able to quickly identify the mental state, for example, of threatening people, thus providing the individual an opportunity to flee or attack pre-emptively.  In other words, processing this information subcortically&amp;nbsp;—  therefore subconsciously&amp;nbsp;— before it is passed on to the rest of the brain for detailed processing accelerates judgment and decision making when a fast reaction is needed.&lt;ref name="recog"&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/13/health/psychology/13face.html |title=Facial Recognition – Brain – Faces, Faces Everywhere|publisher= The New York Times|access-date=July 3, 2010 | work=The New York Times | first=Elizabeth | last= Svoboda | date = 2007-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ability, though highly specialized for the processing and [[emotion recognition|recognition of ''human'' emotions]], also functions to determine the demeanor of wildlife.&lt;ref name="dog"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.paw-rescue.org/PAW/PETTIPS/DogTip_EmotionsInCaninesAndHumans.php | title= Dog Tips – Emotions in Canines and Humans|publisher=Partnership for Animal Welfare|access-date=July 3, 2010}}{{self-published inline|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pareidolia can be considered a subcategory of [[Apophenia]].

== Mimetoliths ==
Rocks may come to mimic recognizable forms through the random processes of formation, weathering and erosion. Most often, the size scale of the rock is larger than the object it resembles, such as a cliff profile resembling a human face. Well-meaning people with a new interest in fossils can pick up [[chert]] nodules, [[concretion]]s or pebbles resembling bones, skulls, turtle shells, dinosaur eggs, etc., in both size and shape.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Japanese researcher [[Chonosuke Okamura]] self-published a series of reports titled ''Original Report of the Okamura Fossil Laboratory'', in which he described tiny inclusions in polished [[limestone]] from the [[Silurian]] period (425 [[Year#Mya|mya]]) as being preserved [[fossil]] remains of tiny humans, gorillas, dogs, dragons, dinosaurs and other organisms, all of them only millimeters long, leading him to claim, "There have been no changes in the bodies of mankind since the Silurian period... except for a growth in stature from 3.5 mm to 1,700&amp;nbsp;mm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume6/v6i6/okamura-6-6.html |last=Spamer |first=E. |title=Chonosuke Okamura, Visionary |publisher=Academy of Natural Sciences |location=Philadelphia}} archived at [http://improbable.com/ Improbable Research].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The earwig's tail: a modern bestiary of multi-legged legends |first=May |last=Berenbaum |publisher=Harvard University Press | year=2009 | isbn=0-674-03540-2 | pages=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Okamura's research earned him an [[Ig Nobel Prize]] (a parody of the Nobel Prizes) in [[biodiversity]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/mar/16/highereducation.research |title=Tiny tall tales: Marc Abrahams uncovers the minute, but astonishing, evidence of our fossilised past |first=Marc |last=Abrahams |authorlink=Marc Abrahams |work=The Guardian |date=2004-03-16 |place=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Science's most wanted: the top 10 book of outrageous innovators, deadly disasters, and shocking discoveries |series=Most Wanted |first1=Susan |last1=Conner |first2=Linda |last2=Kitchen |publisher=Brassey's |year=2002 |isbn=1-57488-481-6 |page = 93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projective tests ==
{{Main|Rorschach test}}
The [[Rorschach test|Rorschach inkblot test]] uses pareidolia in an attempt to gain insight into a person's mental state. The Rorschach is a projective test, as it intentionally elicits the thoughts or feelings of respondents that are "projected" onto the ambiguous inkblot images.&lt;ref name="zusne" /&gt;

== Art ==
[[File:Giuseppe Arcimboldo - The Jurist - WGA00837.jpg|thumbnail|''[[The Jurist (painting)|The Jurist]]'' by [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]], 1566. What appears to be its face is a collection of fish and poultry.]]
In his notebooks, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] wrote of pareidolia as a device for painters, writing, "If you look at any walls spotted with various stains or with a mixture of different kinds of stones, if you are about to invent some scene you will be able to see in it a resemblance to various different landscapes adorned with mountains, rivers, rocks, trees, plains, wide valleys, and various groups of hills. You will also be able to see divers combats and figures in quick movement, and strange expressions of faces, and outlandish costumes, and an infinite number of things which you can then reduce into separate and well conceived forms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://archive.org/stream/leonardodavincis007918mbp/leonardodavincis007918mbp_djvu.txt | editor1-last =John | editor1-first = R | editor2-first =J | editor2-last = Don Read| first =Leonardo | last = Da Vinci | title = Note-Books Arranged And Rendered Into English| publisher =Empire State Book Co |year= 1923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
Two 13th century edifices in Turkey display architectural use of shadows of stone carvings at the entrance. Outright pictures are avoided in Islam but  tessellations and calligraphic pictures were allowed, so "accidental" silhouettes became a creative escape. 
*[[Ni%C4%9Fde#Sightseeing|Alaaddin Mosque]], [[Niğde]], [[Turkey]] ([[1223]]) with its "mukarnas" art where the shadows of three-dimensional ornamentation with stone masonry around the entrance form a [[chiaroscuro]] drawing of a woman's face with a crown and long hair appearing at a specific time, at some specific days of the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nevsehirkentrehberim.com/?Bid=1047024 Niğde Alaaddin Camii ’nin Kapısındaki Kadın Silüetinin Sırrı?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nigdekulturturizm.gov.tr/TR,74357/camiler.html Camiler, ALÂEDDİN CAMİ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wha.com.tr/en/world_heritages_of_turkey_tentative_lists_33.php HISTORICAL MONUMENTS OF NIGDE]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Divriği Great Mosque and Hospital]] in [[Sivas]], [[Turkey]] ([[1229]]) shows shadows of the 3 dimensional ornaments of both entrances of the mosque part, to cast a giant shadow of a praying man that changes pose as the sun moves, as if to illustrate what the purpose of the building is. Another detail is the difference in the impressions of the clothing of the two shadow-men indicating two different styles, possibly to tell who is to enter through which door.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fotogaleri.haberler.com/divrigi-ulu-camii-nde-namaz-kilan-insan/ DİVRİĞİ ULU CAMİİ'NDE 'NAMAZ KILAN İNSAN' SİLÜETİ]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious ==
{{Further information|Perceptions of religious imagery in natural phenomena}}
There have been many instances of perceptions of religious imagery and themes, especially the faces of religious figures, in ordinary phenomena. Many involve images of [[Jesus]],&lt;ref name="zusne"&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Zusne | first1 =Leonard | first2 =Warren H | last2 = Jones |title=Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking | publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |year=1989 |isbn= 0-8058-0508-7 |pages= 77–79 |url = https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0805805087 | access-date = 2007-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/23/nyregion/in-a-tree-trunk-in-new-jersey-some-see-our-lady-of-guadalupe.html | newspaper = The New York Times | title = In New Jersey, a Knot in a Tree Trunk Draws the Faithful and the Skeptical | date = July 23, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the word [[Allah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Yahaya | last = Ibrahim | title = In Maiduguri, a tree with engraved name of God turns spot to a Mecca of sorts| date = 2011-01-02 | url = http://sundaytrust.com.ng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5698:in-maiduguri-a-tree-with-engraved-name-of-god-turns-spot-to-a-mecca-of-sorts&amp;catid=17:community-news-kanem-trust&amp;Itemid=28| work = Sunday Trust | publisher =Media Trust Limited, Abuja| access-date = 2012-03-21 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104031545/http://sundaytrust.com.ng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5698:in-maiduguri-a-tree-with-engraved-name-of-god-turns-spot-to-a-mecca-of-sorts&amp;catid=17:community-news-kanem-trust&amp;Itemid=28 | archivedate = 2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other religious phenomena: in September 2007 in [[Singapore]], for example, a [[callus (cell biology)|callus]] on a tree resembled a [[monkey]], leading believers to pay homage to the "Monkey god" (either [[Sun Wukong]] or [[Hanuman]]) in the [[monkey tree phenomenon]].&lt;ref name="Ng Hui Hui"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/printfriendly/0,4139,141806,00.html | last =Ng | first = Hui Hui |title= Monkey See, Monkey Do? | work = [[The New Paper]] |date=13 September 2007 |pages=12–13 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071014083330/http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/printfriendly/0,4139,141806,00.html |archivedate= 2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publicity surrounding sightings of religious figures and other surprising images in ordinary objects has spawned a market for such items on online auctions like [[eBay]].  One famous instance was a grilled cheese sandwich with the face of the Virgin Mary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4034787.stm |title= 'Virgin Mary' toast fetches $28,000 |publisher=BBC News |date=23 November 2004 |access-date= 2006-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computer vision ==
[[File:Aurelia-aurita-3-0049 (cropped).jpg|thumbnail|Given an image of jellyfish swimming, the [[DeepDream]] program can be encouraged to "see" the faces and legs of dogs]]
Pareidolia also arises in [[computer vision]],&lt;ref&gt;Chalup, Stephan K., Kenny Hong, and Michael J. Ostwald. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephan_Chalup/publication/228735838_Simulating_Pareidolia_of_Faces_for_Architectural_Image_Analysis/links/0fcfd511b3ff280efe000000/Simulating-Pareidolia-of-Faces-for-Architectural-Image-Analysis.pdf Simulating pareidolia of faces for architectural image analysis]." brain 26.91 (2010): 100.&lt;/ref&gt; specifically in [[Computer vision#Recognition|image recognition]] programs, which can spuriously detect [[feature (machine learning)|features]]. In the case of an [[artificial neural network]], higher-level features correspond to more recognizable features, and enhancing these features brings out what the computer sees. These reflect the training set of images that the network has "seen" previously.

Striking visuals can be produced in this way, notably in the [[DeepDream]] software, which falsely detects and then exaggerates features such as eyes and faces in any image.

== Speech ==
In 1971 [[Konstantīns Raudive]] wrote ''Breakthrough'', detailing what he believed was the discovery of [[electronic voice phenomenon|electronic voice phenomena]] (EVP). EVP has been described as auditory pareidolia.&lt;ref name="zusne" /&gt; Allegations of [[backmasking]] in popular music, in which a listener claims a message has been recorded backward onto a track meant to be played forward, have also been described as auditory pareidolia.&lt;ref name="zusne" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vokey |first1=John R. |last2=Read |first2=J. Don |title=Subliminal messages: Between the devil and the media |journal=American Psychologist |volume=40 |issue=11 |pages=1231–9 |year=1985 |pmid=4083611 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.40.11.1231 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the psychologist [[Diana Deutsch]] invented an algorithm for producing phantom words and phrases with the sounds coming from two stereo loudspeakers, with one to the listener's left and the other to his right. Each loudspeaker produces a phrase consisting of two words or syllables. The same sequence is presented repeatedly through both loudspeakers; however, they are offset in time so that when the first sound (word or syllable) is coming from the speaker on the left, the second sound is coming from the speaker on the right, and vice versa. After listening for a while, phantom words and phrases suddenly emerge, and these often appear to reflect what is on the listener's mind, and they transform perceptually into different words and phrases as the sequence continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://philomel.com/musical_illusions/|last1=Deutsch |first1=D. |title=Musical Illusions and Paradoxes|journal=Philomel Records|year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://philomel.com/phantom_words/|last1=Deutsch |first1=D. |title=Phantom Words and Other Curiosities|journal=Philomel Records|year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related phenomena ==
Various European ancient [[divination]] practices involved the interpretation of shadows cast by objects. For example, in [[molybdomancy]], a random shape produced by pouring molten tin into cold water is interpreted by the shadow it casts in candlelight.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

A [[shadow person]] (also known as a shadow figure, shadow being or black mass) is often attributed to pareidolia. It is the perception of a patch of shadow as a living, humanoid figure, particularly as interpreted by believers in the [[paranormal]] or [[supernatural]] as the presence of a spirit or other entity.&lt;ref name="Idiot's Guide"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahlquist|first=Diane|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Life After Death|year=2007|publisher=Penguin Group|location=USA|isbn=978-1-59257-651-7|page=122|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0lkscwxGSoAC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=dark+shadow+entity+corner+eye#v=onepage&amp;q=dark%20shadow%20entity%20corner%20eye&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pareidolia is also what some skeptics believe causes people to believe that they have seen [[Ghost#Scientific view|ghosts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/pareidol.html |title=pareidolia |last=Carroll |first=Robert Todd |date= June 2001|work=skepdic.com |access-date=2007-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematical logic]], the '''Peano axioms''', also known as the '''Dedekind–Peano axioms''' or the '''Peano postulates''', are [[axiom]]s for the [[natural number]]s presented by the 19th century [[Italian people|Italian]] [[mathematician]] [[Giuseppe Peano]]. These axioms have been used nearly unchanged in a number of [[metamathematics|metamathematical]] investigations, including research into fundamental questions of whether [[number theory]] is [[consistency proof|consistent]] and [[Completeness (logic)|complete]].

The need to formalize [[arithmetic]] was not well appreciated until the work of [[Hermann Grassmann]], who showed in the 1860s that many facts in arithmetic could be derived from more basic facts about the [[successor function|successor operation]] and [[mathematical induction|induction]].{{sfn|Grassmann|1861}} In 1881, [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] provided an [[Axiomatic system#Axiomatization|axiomatization]] of natural-number arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peirce|1881}}, {{harvnb|Shields|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In&amp;nbsp;1888, [[Richard Dedekind]] proposed another axiomatization of natural-number arithmetic, and in&amp;nbsp;1889, Peano published a simplified version of them as a collection of axioms in his book, [[Arithmetices principia, nova methodo exposita|''The principles of arithmetic presented by a new method'']] ({{lang-la|Arithmetices principia, nova methodo exposita}}).

The Peano axioms contain three types of statements. The first axiom asserts the existence of at least one member of the set of natural numbers. The next four are general statements about [[Equality (mathematics)|equality]]; in modern treatments these are often not taken as part of the Peano axioms, but rather as axioms of the "underlying logic".{{sfn|van Heijenoort|1967|page=94}} The next three axioms are [[first-order logic|first-order]] statements about natural numbers expressing the fundamental properties of the successor operation. The ninth, final axiom is a [[second-order logic|second order]] statement of the principle of mathematical induction over the natural numbers. A weaker first-order system called '''Peano arithmetic''' is obtained by explicitly adding the addition and multiplication operation symbols and replacing the [[Second-order arithmetic#Induction and comprehension schema|second-order induction]] axiom with a first-order [[axiom schema]].

== Formulation ==

When Peano formulated his axioms, the language of [[mathematical logic]] was in its infancy. The system of logical notation he created to present the axioms did not prove to be popular, although it was the genesis of the modern notation for [[Element (mathematics)|set membership]] (∈, which comes from Peano's ε) and [[logical implication|implication]] (⊃, which comes from Peano's reversed 'C'.) Peano maintained a clear distinction between mathematical and logical symbols, which was not yet common in mathematics; such a separation had first been introduced in the ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' by [[Gottlob Frege]], published in 1879.{{sfn|van Heijenoort|1967|page=2}} Peano was unaware of Frege's work and independently recreated his logical apparatus based on the work of [[George Boole|Boole]] and [[Ernst Schröder|Schröder]].{{sfn|van Heijenoort|1967|page=83}}

The Peano axioms define the arithmetical properties of ''[[natural numbers]]'', usually represented as a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] '''N''' or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}.&lt;/math&gt; The [[non-logical symbol]]s for the axioms consist of a constant symbol 0 and a unary function symbol ''S''.

The first axiom states that the constant 0 is a natural number:
{{ordered list|start=1
| 1= 0 is a natural number.
}}
The next four axioms describe the [[equality (mathematics)|equality]] [[relation (mathematics)|relation]]. Since they are logically valid in first-order logic with equality, they are not considered to be part of "the Peano axioms" in modern treatments.{{sfn|van Heijenoort|1967|page=83}}
{{ordered list|start=2
| 2= For every natural number ''x'', {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''x''}}. That is, equality is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]].
| 3= For all natural numbers ''x'' and ''y'', if {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''y''}}, then {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''x''}}. That is, equality is [[symmetric relation|symmetric]].
| 4= For all natural numbers ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'', if ''x'' = ''y'' and ''y'' = ''z'', then {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''z''}}. That is, equality is [[transitive relation|transitive]].
| 5= For all ''a'' and ''b'', if ''b'' is a natural number and {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''b''}}, then ''a'' is also a natural number. That is, the natural numbers are [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under equality.
}}
The remaining axioms define the arithmetical properties of the natural numbers. The naturals are assumed to be closed under a single-valued "[[successor function|successor]]" [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''S''.
{{ordered list|start=6
| 6=For every natural number ''n'', ''S''(''n'') is a natural number.
| 7=For all natural numbers ''m'' and ''n'', {{nowrap|1=''m'' = ''n''}} if and only if {{nowrap|1=''S''(''m'') = ''S''(''n'')}}. That is, ''S'' is an [[injective function|injection]].
| 8=For every natural number ''n'', {{nowrap|1=''S''(''n'') = 0}} is false. That is, there is no natural number whose successor is 0.
}}
Peano's original formulation of the axioms used 1 instead of 0 as the "first" natural number.{{sfn|Peano|1889|page=1}} This choice is arbitrary, as axiom 1 does not endow the constant 0 with any additional properties. However, because 0 is the [[identity element|additive identity]] in arithmetic, most modern formulations of the Peano axioms start from 0. Axioms 1, 6, 7, 8 define a [[unary numeral system|unary representation]] of the intuitive notion of natural numbers: the number 1 can be defined as ''S''(0), 2 as ''S''(''S''(0)), etc. However, considering the notion of natural numbers as being defined by these axioms, axioms 1, 6, 7, 8 do not imply that the successor function generates all the natural numbers different from 0. Put differently, they do not guarantee that every natural number other than zero must succeed some other natural number.

The intuitive notion that each natural number can be obtained by applying ''successor'' sufficiently often to zero requires an additional axiom, which is sometimes called the ''[[axiom of induction]]''.

{{ordered list|start=9
| 9=If ''K'' is a set such that:
* 0 is in ''K'', and
* for every natural number ''n'', ''n'' being in ''K'' implies that ''S''(''n'') is in ''K'',
then ''K'' contains every natural number.
}}

The induction axiom is sometimes stated in the following form:
{{ordered list|start=9
| 9=If ''φ'' is a unary [[predicate (mathematics)|predicate]] such that:
* ''φ''(0) is true, and
* for every natural number ''n'', ''φ''(''n'') being true implies that ''φ''(''S''(''n'')) is true,
then ''φ''(''n'') is true for every natural number ''n''.
}}

In Peano's original formulation, the induction axiom is a [[second-order logic|second-order axiom]]. It is now common to replace this second-order principle with a weaker [[first-order logic|first-order]] induction scheme. There are important differences between the second-order and first-order formulations, as discussed in the section {{section link||Models}} below.

== Arithmetic ==

The Peano axioms can be augmented with the operations of [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] and the usual [[total order|total (linear) ordering]] on [[natural numbers#Notation|'''N''']]. The respective functions and relations are constructed in [[set theory]] or [[second-order logic]], and can be shown to be unique using the Peano axioms.

=== Addition ===

[[Addition in N|Addition]] is a function that [[map (mathematics)|maps]] two natural numbers (two elements of '''N''') to another one. It is defined [[recursion|recursively]] as:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
a + 0      &amp;= a ,        &amp; \textrm{(1)}\\
a + S (b)  &amp;= S (a + b). &amp; \textrm{(2)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
For example:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
a + 1 &amp;= a + S(0)     &amp; \mbox{by definition} \\
      &amp;= S(a + 0)     &amp; \mbox{using (2)} \\
      &amp;= S(a),        &amp; \mbox{using (1)} \\
\\
a + 2 &amp;= a + S(1)     &amp; \mbox{by definition} \\
      &amp;= S(a + 1)     &amp; \mbox{using (2)} \\
      &amp;= S(S(a))      &amp; \mbox{using } a + 1 = S(a) \\
\\
a + 3 &amp;= a + S(2)     &amp; \mbox{by definition} \\
      &amp;= S(a + 2)     &amp; \mbox{using (2)} \\
      &amp;= S(S(S(a)))    &amp; \mbox{using } a + 2 = S(S(a)) \\
\text{etc.} &amp; \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] {{nowrap|('''N''', +)}} is a [[commutative]] [[monoid]] with identity element 0. {{nowrap|('''N''', +)}} is also a [[cancellation property|cancellative]] [[magma (algebra)|magma]], and thus [[embedding|embeddable]] in a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. The smallest group embedding '''N''' is the [[integer]]s.

=== Multiplication ===

Similarly, [[multiplication]] is a function mapping two natural numbers to another one. Given addition, it is defined recursively as:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}

a \cdot 0 &amp;= 0, \\
a \cdot S (b) &amp;= a + (a \cdot b).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
It is easy to see that ''S''(0) (or "1", in the familiar language of [[decimal representation]]) is the multiplicative [[identity element|right identity]]:

: ''a'' · ''S''(0) = ''a'' + (''a'' · 0) = ''a'' + 0 = ''a''

To show that ''S''(0) is also the multiplicative left identity requires the induction axiom due to the way multiplication is defined:

* ''S''(0) is the left identity of 0: ''S''(0) · 0 = 0.
* If ''S''(0) is the left identity of ''a'' (that is ''S''(0) · ''a'' = ''a''), then ''S''(0) is also the left identity of ''S''(''a''): ''S''(0) · ''S''(''a'') = ''S''(0) + ''S''(0) · ''a'' = ''S''(0) + ''a'' = ''a'' + ''S''(0) = ''S''(''a'' + 0) = ''S''(''a'').

Therefore by the induction axiom ''S''(0) is the multiplicative left identity of all natural numbers.  Moreover, it can be shown that multiplication [[distributive law|distributes over]] addition:

: ''a'' · (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' · ''b'') + (''a'' · ''c'').

Thus, {{nowrap|('''N''', +, 0, ·, ''S''(0))}} is a commutative [[semiring]].

=== Inequalities ===

The usual [[total order]] relation ≤ on natural numbers can be defined as follows, assuming 0 is a natural number:

: For all {{nowrap|''a'', ''b'' ∈ '''N'''}}, {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''b''}} if and only if there exists some {{nowrap|''c'' ∈ '''N'''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''a'' + ''c'' = ''b''}}.

This relation is stable under addition and multiplication: for &lt;math&gt; a, b, c \in \mathbf{N} &lt;/math&gt;, if {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''b''}}, then:

* ''a'' + ''c'' ≤ ''b'' + ''c'', and
* ''a'' · ''c'' ≤ ''b'' · ''c''.

Thus, the structure {{nowrap|('''N''', +, ·, 1, 0, ≤)}} is an [[ordered ring|ordered semiring]]; because there is no natural number between 0 and 1, it is a discrete ordered semiring.

The axiom of induction is sometimes stated in the following form that uses a stronger hypothesis, making use of the order relation "≤":

: For any [[predicate (mathematics)|predicate]] ''φ'', if
:* ''φ''(0) is true, and
:* for every {{nowrap|''n'', ''k'' ∈ '''N'''}}, if {{nowrap|''k'' ≤ ''n''}} implies that ''φ''(''k'') is true, then ''φ''(''S''(''n'')) is true,
: then for every {{nowrap|''n'' ∈ '''N'''}}, ''φ''(''n'') is true.

This form of the induction axiom, called ''strong induction'', is a consequence of the standard formulation, but is often better suited for reasoning about the ≤ order. For example, to show that the naturals are [[well-order]]ed—every [[empty set|nonempty]] [[subset]] of '''N''' has a [[least element]]—one can reason as follows. Let a nonempty {{nowrap|''X'' ⊆ '''N'''}} be given and assume ''X'' has no least element.

* Because 0 is the least element of '''N''', it must be that {{nowrap|0 ∉ ''X''}}.
* For any {{nowrap|''n'' ∈ '''N'''}}, suppose for every {{nowrap|''k'' ≤ ''n''}}, {{nowrap|''k'' ∉ ''X''}}. Then {{nowrap|''S''(''n'') ∉ ''X''}}, for otherwise it would be the least element of ''X''.

Thus, by the strong induction principle, for every {{nowrap|''n'' ∈ '''N'''}}, {{nowrap|''n'' ∉ ''X''}}. Thus, {{nowrap|1=''X'' ∩ '''N''' = ∅}}, which [[contradiction|contradicts]] ''X'' being a nonempty subset of '''N'''. Thus ''X'' has a least element.

== First-order theory of arithmetic ==

All of the Peano axioms except the ninth axiom (the induction axiom) are statements in [[first-order logic]].{{sfn|Partee|Ter Meulen|Wall|2012|page=215}} The arithmetical operations of addition and multiplication and the order relation can also be defined using first-order axioms. The axiom of induction is in [[second-order logic|second-order]], since it [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifies]] over predicates (equivalently, sets of natural numbers rather than natural numbers), but it can be transformed into a first-order ''[[axiom schema]]'' of induction. Such a schema includes one axiom per predicate definable in the first-order language of Peano arithmetic, making it weaker than the second-order axiom.{{sfnp|Harsanyi|1983}}

First-order axiomatizations of Peano arithmetic have an important limitation, however. In second-order logic, it is possible to define the addition and multiplication operations from the [[successor function|successor operation]], but this cannot be done in the more restrictive setting of first-order logic. Therefore, the addition and multiplication operations are directly included in the [[signature (logic)|signature]] of Peano arithmetic, and axioms are included that relate the three operations to each other.

The following list of axioms (along with the usual axioms of equality), which contains six of the seven axioms of [[Robinson arithmetic]], is sufficient for this purpose:{{sfn|Mendelson|1997|page=155}}

* &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \mathbf{N} \ (0 \neq  S ( x ))&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \in \mathbf{N} \ (S( x ) =  S( y ) \Rightarrow x = y)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \mathbf{N} \ (x  + 0 = x )&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \in \mathbf{N} \ (x + S( y ) =  S( x + y ))&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \mathbf{N} \ (x \cdot 0 = 0)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \in \mathbf{N} \ (x \cdot  S ( y ) = x \cdot y + x )&lt;/math&gt;

In addition to this list of numerical axioms, Peano arithmetic contains the induction schema, which consists of a [[Countable set|countably infinite]] set of [[axioms]]. For each formula {{nowrap|''φ''(''x'', ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} in the language of Peano arithmetic, the '''first-order induction axiom''' for ''φ'' is the sentence

: &lt;math&gt;\forall \bar{y} (\varphi(0,\bar{y}) \land \forall x ( \varphi(x,\bar{y})\Rightarrow\varphi(S(x),\bar{y})) \Rightarrow \forall x \varphi(x,\bar{y}))&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\bar{y}&lt;/math&gt; is an abbreviation for ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''y''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. The first-order induction schema includes every instance of the first-order induction axiom, that is, it includes the induction axiom for every formula ''φ''.

=== Equivalent axiomatizations ===

There are many different, but equivalent, axiomatizations of Peano arithmetic. While some axiomatizations, such as the one just described, use a signature that only has symbols for 0 and the successor, addition, and multiplications operations, other axiomatizations use the language of [[ordered ring|ordered semirings]], including an additional order relation symbol. One such axiomatization begins with the following axioms that describe a discrete ordered semiring.{{sfn|Kaye|1991|pages=16–18}}

&lt;!-- These axioms are taken directly from Kaye 1991. Please don't "tweak" them, add additional axioms, or remove axioms without discussion on the talk page. --&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y, z \in \mathbf{N} \ ( (x + y) + z = x + (y + z) )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., addition is [[associative property|associative]].
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x + y = y + x )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., addition is [[commutative property|commutative]].
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y, z \in \mathbf{N} \ ( (x \cdot y) \cdot z = x \cdot (y \cdot z) )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., multiplication is associative.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x \cdot y = y \cdot x )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., multiplication is commutative.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y, z \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x \cdot (y + z) = (x \cdot y) + (x \cdot z) )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., multiplication [[distributive property|distributes]] over addition.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x + 0 = x \land x \cdot 0 = 0 )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., zero is an [[identity element|identity]] for addition, and an [[absorbing element]] for multiplication (actually superfluous&lt;ref group=note&gt;"&lt;math&gt; \forall x \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x \cdot 0 = 0 ) &lt;/math&gt;" can be proven from the other axioms (in first-order logic) as follows. Firstly, &lt;math&gt; x \cdot 0 + x \cdot 0 = x \cdot (0+0) = x \cdot 0 = x \cdot 0 + 0 &lt;/math&gt; by distributivity and additive identity. Secondly, &lt;math&gt; x \cdot 0 = 0 \lor x \cdot 0 &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; by Axiom 15. If &lt;math&gt; x \cdot 0 &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; x \cdot 0 + x \cdot 0 &gt; x \cdot 0 + 0 &lt;/math&gt; by addition of the same element and commutativity, and hence &lt;math&gt; x \cdot 0 + 0 &gt; x \cdot 0 + 0 &lt;/math&gt; by substitution, contradicting irreflexivity. Therefore it must be that &lt;math&gt; x \cdot 0 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;).
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x \cdot 1 = x )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., one is an [[identity element|identity]] for multiplication.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y, z \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x &lt; y \land y &lt; z \Rightarrow x &lt; z )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the '&amp;lt;' operator is [[Transitive relation|transitive]].
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \mathbf{N} \ ( \neg (x &lt; x) )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the '&amp;lt;' operator is [[Reflexive relation|irreflexive]].
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x &lt; y \lor x = y \lor y &lt; x )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the ordering satisfies [[trichotomy (mathematics)|trichotomy]].
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y, z \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x &lt; y \Rightarrow x + z &lt; y + z )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the ordering is preserved under addition of the same element.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y, z \in \mathbf{N} \ ( 0 &lt; z \land x &lt; y \Rightarrow x \cdot z &lt; y \cdot z )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the ordering is preserved under multiplication by the same positive element.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x &lt; y \Rightarrow \exists z \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x + z = y ) )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. given any two distinct elements, the larger is the smaller plus another element.
# &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; 1 \land \forall x \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x &gt; 0 \Rightarrow x \ge 1 )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. zero and one are distinct and there is no element between them.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \mathbf{N} \ ( x \ge 0 )&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. zero is the minimum element.

The theory defined by these axioms is known as '''PA&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;'''; the theory '''PA''' is obtained by adding the first-order induction schema. An important property of PA&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is that any structure &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; satisfying this theory has an initial segment (ordered by &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt;) isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N}&lt;/math&gt;. Elements in that segment are called '''standard''' elements, while other elements are called '''nonstandard''' elements.

== Models ==

A [[model theory|model]] of the Peano axioms is a triple {{nowrap|('''N''', 0, ''S'')}}, where '''N''' is a (necessarily infinite) set, {{nowrap|0 ∈ '''N'''}} and {{nowrap|''S'' : '''N''' → '''N'''}} satisfies the axioms above. [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]] proved in his 1888 book, ''The Nature and Meaning of Numbers'' ({{lang-de|Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen?}}, i.e., “What are the numbers and what are they good for?”) that any two models of the Peano axioms (including the second-order induction axiom) are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]]. In particular, given two models {{nowrap|('''N'''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;, 0&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{nowrap|('''N'''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;, 0&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} of the Peano axioms, there is a unique [[homomorphism]] {{nowrap|''f'' : '''N'''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; → '''N'''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;}} satisfying

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}

f(0_A) &amp;= 0_B \\
f(S_A (n)) &amp;= S_B (f (n))
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and it is a [[bijective function|bijection]]. This means that the second-order Peano axioms are [[Morley's categoricity theorem|categorical]]. This is not the case with any first-order reformulation of the Peano axioms, however.

=== Set-theoretic models ===
{{Main|Set-theoretic definition of natural numbers}}
The Peano axioms can be derived from [[set theory|set theoretic]] constructions of the [[natural number]]s and axioms of set theory such as [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Suppes|1960}}, {{harvnb|Hatcher|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard construction of the naturals, due to [[John von Neumann]], starts from a definition of 0 as the empty set, ∅, and an operator ''s'' on sets defined as:

: &lt;math&gt;s(a) = a \cup \{a\}&lt;/math&gt;

The set of natural numbers '''N''' is defined as the intersection of all sets [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under ''s'' that contain the empty set. Each natural number is equal (as a set) to the set of natural numbers less than it:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}

0 &amp;= \emptyset \\
1 &amp;= s(0) = s(\emptyset) = \emptyset \cup \{ \emptyset \} = \{ \emptyset \} = \{ 0 \} \\
2 &amp;= s(1) = s(\{ 0 \}) = \{ 0 \} \cup \{ \{ 0 \} \} = \{ 0 , \{ 0 \} \} = \{ 0, 1 \} \\
3 &amp;= s(2) = s(\{ 0, 1 \}) = \{ 0, 1 \} \cup \{ \{ 0, 1 \} \} = \{ 0, 1, \{ 0, 1 \} \} = \{ 0, 1, 2 \}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and so on. The set '''N''' together with 0 and the [[successor function]] {{nowrap|''s'' : '''N''' → '''N'''}} satisfies the Peano axioms.

Peano arithmetic is [[equiconsistent]] with several weak systems of set theory.{{sfn|Tarski|Givant|1987|loc=Section 7.6}} One such system is ZFC with the [[axiom of infinity]] replaced by its negation. Another such system consists of [[general set theory]] ([[Axiom of extensionality|extensionality]], existence of the [[empty set]], and the [[general set theory|axiom of adjunction]]), augmented by an axiom schema stating that a property that holds for the empty set and holds of an adjunction whenever it holds of the adjunct must hold for all sets.

=== Interpretation in category theory ===

The Peano axioms can also be understood using [[category theory]]. Let ''C'' be a [[category (mathematics)|category]] with [[terminal object]] 1&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;, and define the category of [[pointed unary system]]s, US&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'') as follows:

* The objects of US&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'') are triples {{nowrap|(''X'', 0&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} where ''X'' is an object of ''C'', and {{nowrap|0&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; : 1&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''X''}} and {{nowrap|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''X'' → ''X''}} are ''C''-morphisms.
* A morphism ''φ'' : (''X'', 0&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;) → (''Y'', 0&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a ''C''-morphism {{nowrap|''φ'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} with {{nowrap|1=''φ'' 0&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{nowrap|1=''φ'' ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; ''φ''}}.

Then ''C'' is said to satisfy the Dedekind–Peano axioms if US&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'') has an initial object; this initial object is known as a [[natural number object]] in ''C''. If {{nowrap|('''N''', 0, ''S'')}} is this initial object, and {{nowrap|(''X'', 0&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is any other object, then the unique map {{nowrap|''u'' : ('''N''', 0, ''S'') → (''X'', 0&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is such that

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}

u 0 &amp;= 0_X, \\
u (S x) &amp;= S_X (u x).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
This is precisely the recursive definition of 0&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Nonstandard models ==

Although the usual [[natural number]]s satisfy the axioms of PA, there are other models as well (called "[[non-standard model]]s"); the [[compactness theorem]] implies that the existence of nonstandard elements cannot be excluded in first-order logic.{{sfn|Hermes|1973|loc=VI.4.3|ps=, presenting a theorem of [[Thoralf Skolem]]}} The upward [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]] shows that there are nonstandard models of PA of all infinite cardinalities. This is not the case for the original (second-order) Peano axioms, which have only one model, up to isomorphism.{{sfn|Hermes|1973|loc=VI.3.1}} This illustrates one way the first-order system PA is weaker than the second-order Peano axioms.

When interpreted as a proof within a first-order [[set theory]], such as [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]], Dedekind's categoricity proof for PA shows that each model of set theory has a unique model of the Peano axioms, up to isomorphism, that embeds as an initial segment of all other models of PA contained within that model of set theory. In the standard model of set theory, this smallest model of PA is the standard model of PA; however, in a nonstandard model of set theory, it may be a nonstandard model of PA. This situation cannot be avoided with any first-order formalization of set theory.

It is natural to ask whether a countable nonstandard model can be explicitly constructed. The answer is affirmative as [[Skolem]] in 1933 provided an explicit  construction of such a nonstandard model.  On the other hand, [[Tennenbaum's theorem]], proved in 1959, shows that there is no countable nonstandard model of PA in which either the addition or multiplication operation is [[computable function|computable]].{{sfn|Kaye|1991|loc=Section 11.3}} This result shows it is difficult to be completely explicit in describing the addition and multiplication operations of a countable nonstandard model of PA. However, there is only one possible [[order type]] of a countable nonstandard model. Letting ''ω'' be the order type of the natural numbers, ''ζ'' be the order type of the integers, and ''η'' be the order type of the rationals, the order type of any countable nonstandard model of PA is {{nowrap|''ω'' + ''ζ''·''η''}}, which can be visualized as a copy of the natural numbers followed by a dense linear ordering of copies of the integers.

=== Overspill ===

A '''cut''' in a nonstandard model ''M'' is a nonempty subset ''I'' of ''M'' so that ''I'' is downward closed ( ''x''&lt;''y'' and ''y''&amp;isin;''I'' implies ''x''&amp;isin;''I'') and ''I'' is closed under successor. A '''proper cut''' is a cut that is a proper subset of ''M''. Each nonstandard model has many proper cuts, including one that corresponds to the standard natural numbers.   However, the induction scheme in Peano arithmetic prevents any proper cut from being definable.  The overspill lemma, first proved by Abraham Robinson, formalizes this fact. 

:'''Overspill Lemma'''{{sfn|Kaye|1991|pages=70ff.}} Let ''M'' be a nonstandard model of PA and let ''I'' be a proper cut of ''M''. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\bar a&lt;/math&gt; is a tuple of elements of ''M'' and &lt;math&gt;\phi(x, \bar a)&lt;/math&gt; is a formula in the language of arithmetic so that
::&lt;math&gt;M \vDash \phi(b, \bar a)&lt;/math&gt; for all ''b''&amp;isin;''I''.
:Then there is a ''c'' in ''M'' that is greater than every element of ''I'' such that
::&lt;math&gt;M \vDash \phi(c, \bar a).&lt;/math&gt;

== Consistency ==
{{Further|Hilbert's second problem|Consistency}}

When the Peano axioms were first proposed, [[Bertrand Russell]] and others agreed that these axioms implicitly defined what we mean by a "natural number".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fritz|1952|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=Yl_XAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137, p. 137]}}&lt;br&gt;An illustration of 'interpretation' is Russell's own definition of 'cardinal number'. The uninterpreted system in this case is Peano's axioms for the number system, whose three primitive ideas and five axioms, Peano believed, were sufficient to enable one to derive all the properties of the system of natural numbers. Actually, Russell maintains, Peano's axioms define any progression of the form &lt;math&gt;x_0,x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; of which the series of the natural numbers is one instance.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Poincaré]] was more cautious, saying they only defined natural numbers if they were ''consistent''; if there is a proof that starts from just these axioms and derives a contradiction such as 0 = 1, then the axioms are inconsistent, and don't define anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gray|2013|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=w2Tya9gOKqEC&amp;pg=PA133 p. 133]}}&lt;br&gt;So Poincaré turned to see whether logicism could generate arithmetic, more precisely, the arithmetic of ordinals. Couturat, said Poincaré, had accepted the Peano axioms as a definition of a number. But this will not do. The axioms cannot be shown to be free of contradiction by finding examples of them, and any attempt to show that they were contradiction-free by examining the totality of their implications would require the very principle of mathematical induction Couturat believed they implied. For (in a further passage dropped from S&amp;M) either one assumed the principle in order to prove it, which would only prove that if it is true it is not self-contradictory, which says nothing; or one used the principle in another form than the one stated, in which case one must show that the number of steps in one's reasoning was an integer according to the new definition, but this could not be done (1905c, 834).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, [[David Hilbert]] posed the problem of proving their consistency using only [[Finitism|finitistic]] methods as the [[Hilbert's second problem|second]] of his [[Hilbert's problems|twenty-three problems]].{{sfn|Hilbert|1902}} In 1931, [[Kurt Gödel]] proved his [[second incompleteness theorem]], which shows that such a consistency proof cannot be formalized within Peano arithmetic itself.{{sfn|Gödel|1931}}

Although it is widely claimed that Gödel's theorem rules out the possibility of a finitistic consistency proof for Peano arithmetic, this depends on exactly what one means by a finitistic proof. Gödel himself pointed out the possibility of giving a finitistic consistency proof of Peano arithmetic or stronger systems by using finitistic methods that are not formalizable in Peano arithmetic, and in 1958, Gödel published a method for proving the consistency of arithmetic using [[type theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gödel|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, [[Gerhard Gentzen]] gave a proof of the consistency of Peano's axioms, using [[transfinite induction]] up to an ordinal called [[epsilon zero|ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gentzen|1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gentzen explained: "The aim of the present paper is to prove the consistency of elementary number theory or, rather, to reduce the question of consistency to certain fundamental principles". Gentzen's proof is arguably finitistic, since the transfinite ordinal ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; can be encoded in terms of finite objects (for example, as a [[Turing machine]] describing a suitable order on the integers, or more abstractly as consisting of the finite trees, suitably linearly ordered). Whether or not Gentzen's proof meets the requirements Hilbert envisioned is unclear: there is no generally accepted definition of exactly what is meant by a finitistic proof, and Hilbert himself never gave a precise definition.

The vast majority of contemporary mathematicians believe that Peano's axioms are consistent, relying either on intuition or the acceptance of a consistency proof such as [[Gentzen's consistency proof|Gentzen's proof]]. A small number of philosophers and mathematicians, some of whom also advocate [[ultrafinitism]], reject Peano's axioms because accepting the axioms amounts to accepting the infinite collection of natural numbers. In particular, addition (including the successor function) and multiplication are assumed to be total. Curiously, there are [[self-verifying theories]] that are similar to PA but have subtraction and division instead of addition and multiplication, which are axiomatized in such a way to avoid proving sentences that correspond to the totality of addition and multiplication, but which are still able to prove all true &lt;math&gt;\Pi_1&lt;/math&gt; theorems of PA, and yet can be extended to a consistent theory that proves its own consistency (stated as the non-existence of a Hilbert-style proof of "0=1").{{sfn|Willard|2001}}

[[Image:Focal stability.png|thumb|300px|right|Phase space of a dynamic system with focal instability, showing one phase space trajectory]] 
In [[Dynamical systems theory|dynamical system theory]], a '''phase space''' is a [[Space (mathematics)|space]] in which all possible states of a [[system]] are represented, with each possible state corresponding to one unique point in the phase space. For [[classical mechanics|mechanical systems]], the phase space usually consists of all possible values of [[position (vector)|position]] and [[momentum]] variables.  The concept of phase space was developed in the late 19th century by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], [[Henri Poincaré]], and [[Willard Gibbs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nolte | first1 = D. D. | title = The tangled tale of phase space | doi = 10.1063/1.3397041 | journal = Physics Today | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = 33–38| year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2010PhT....63d..33N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
In a phase space, every [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] or [[parameter]] of the system is represented as an axis of a multidimensional space; a one-dimensional system is called a [[Phase line (mathematics)|phase line]], while a two-dimensional system is called a [[phase plane]]. For every possible state of the system, or allowed combination of values of the system's parameters, a point is included in the multidimensional space. The system's evolving state over time traces a path (a '''phase space trajectory''' for the system) through the high-dimensional space. The phase space trajectory represents the set of states compatible with starting from one particular [[initial condition]], located in the full phase space that represents the set of states compatible with starting from ''any'' initial condition.   As a whole, the phase diagram represents all that the system can be, and its shape can easily elucidate qualities of the system that might not be obvious otherwise. A phase space may contain a great number of dimensions. For instance, a gas containing many molecules may require a separate dimension for each particle's ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' positions and momenta (6 dimensions for an idealized monatomic gas), and for more complex molecular systems additional dimensions are required to describe vibrational modes of the molecular bonds, as well as spin around 3 axes. Phase spaces are easier to use when analyzing behavior of mechanical systems restricted to motion around and along various axes of rotation or translation - e.g. in robotics, like analyzing the range of motion of a [[robotic arm]] or determining the optimal path to achieve a particular position/momentum result.

===Conjugate momentarily===
[[File:Hamiltonian flow classical.gif|frame|left|Evolution of an [[statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|ensemble]] of classical systems in phase space (top). The systems are a massive particle in a one-dimensional potential well (red curve, lower figure). The initially compact ensemble becomes swirled up over time.]]

In classical mechanics, any choice of [[generalized coordinates]] ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; for the position (i.e. coordinates on [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]]) defines [[conjugate momentum|conjugate generalized momenta]] ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; which together define co-ordinates on phase space. More abstractly, in classical mechanics phase space is the [[cotangent bundle]] of configuration space, and in this interpretation the procedure above expresses that a choice of local coordinates on configuration space induces a choice of natural local [[Darboux coordinates]] for the standard [[symplectic structure]] on a cotangent space.

===Statistical ensembles in phase space===
The motion of an [[Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|ensemble]] of systems in this space is studied by classical [[statistical mechanics]]. The local density of points in such systems obeys [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's Theorem]], and so can be taken as constant. Within the context of a model system in classical mechanics, the phase space coordinates of the system at any given time are composed of all of the system's dynamic variables.  Because of this, it is possible to calculate the state of the system at any given time in the future or the past, through integration of Hamilton's or Lagrange's equations of motion.

=== Low dimensions ===
{{main|phase line (mathematics)|phase plane}}

For simple systems, there may be as few as one or two degrees of freedom. One degree of freedom occurs when one has an [[Autonomous system (mathematics)|autonomous]] [[ordinary differential equation]] in a single variable, &lt;math&gt;dy/dt = f(y),&lt;/math&gt; with the resulting one-dimensional system being called a [[Phase line (mathematics)|phase line]], and the qualitative behaviour of the system being immediately visible from the phase line. The simplest non-trivial examples are the [[exponential growth model]]/decay (one unstable/stable equilibrium) and the [[logistic growth model]] (two equilibria, one stable, one unstable).

The phase space of a two-dimensional system is called a [[phase plane]], which occurs in classical mechanics for a single particle moving in one dimension, and where the two variables are position and velocity. In this case, a sketch of the [[phase portrait]] may give qualitative information about the dynamics of the system, such as the [[limit cycle]] of the [[Van der Pol oscillator]] shown in the diagram.

Here, the horizontal axis gives the position and vertical axis the velocity.  As the system evolves, its state follows one of the lines (trajectories) on the phase diagram.

=== Chaos theory ===
Classic examples of phase diagrams from [[chaos theory]] are :
* the [[Lorenz attractor]]
* population growth (i.e. [[logistic map]])
* parameter plane of [[complex quadratic polynomial]]s with [[Mandelbrot set]].

==Phase plot==
A plot of position and momentum variables as a function of time is sometimes called a '''phase plot''' or a '''phase diagram'''. [[Phase diagram]], however, is more usually reserved in the [[Outline of physical science|physical sciences]] for a diagram showing the various regions of stability of the thermodynamic phases of a chemical system, which consists of [[pressure]], [[temperature]], and composition.

==Quantum mechanics==
In [[quantum mechanics]], the coordinates ''p'' and ''q'' of phase space normally become [[hermitian operators]] in a [[Hilbert space]].

But they may alternatively retain their classical interpretation, provided  functions of them compose in novel algebraic ways (through [[Moyal product|Groenewold's 1946 star product]]), consistent with the [[uncertainty principle]] of quantum mechanics. 
Every quantum mechanical [[observable]] corresponds to a unique function or [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] on phase space, and vice versa, as specified by [[Hermann Weyl]] (1927) and supplemented by [[John von Neumann]] (1931); [[Eugene Wigner]] (1932); and, in a grand synthesis, by [[Hilbrand J. Groenewold|H J Groenewold]] (1946). 
With [[José Enrique Moyal|J E Moyal]] (1949), these completed the foundations of  the '''[[phase space formulation]] of quantum mechanics''', a complete and logically autonomous reformulation of quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Curtright | first1 = T. L. | last2 = Zachos | first2 = C. K. | doi = 10.1142/S2251158X12000069 | title = Quantum Mechanics in Phase Space | journal = Asia Pacific Physics Newsletter | volume = 01 | pages = 37 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = | arxiv = 1104.5269 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Its modern abstractions include [[deformation quantization]] and [[geometric quantization]].)
 
Expectation values in phase-space quantization are obtained isomorphically to tracing operator observables with the density matrix in Hilbert space: they are obtained by phase-space integrals of observables, with the [[Wigner quasi-probability distribution]] effectively serving as a measure.

Thus, by expressing quantum mechanics in phase space (the same ambit as for classical mechanics), the [[Wigner–Weyl transform|Weyl map]] facilitates recognition of quantum mechanics as a [[Deformation theory|'''deformation''']] (generalization) of classical mechanics, with deformation parameter ''[[Reduced Planck constant|ħ]]/S'', where ''S'' is the [[Action (physics)|action]] of the relevant process. (Other familiar deformations in physics involve the deformation of classical Newtonian into [[Special relativity|relativistic mechanics]], with deformation parameter ''v''/''c'';{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} or the deformation of Newtonian gravity into [[General Relativity]], with deformation parameter [[Schwarzschild radius]]/characteristic-dimension.){{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Classical expressions, observables, and operations (such as Poisson brackets) are modified by ħ-dependent quantum corrections, as the conventional commutative multiplication applying in classical mechanics is generalized to the noncommutative star-multiplication characterizing quantum mechanics and underlying its uncertainty principle.

==Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics==
&lt;!-- [[Thermodynamic phase space]] redirects here]] --&gt;
In [[thermodynamics]] and [[statistical mechanics]] contexts, the term phase space has two meanings: It is used in the same sense as in classical mechanics. If a thermodynamic system consists of ''N'' particles, then a point in the 6''N''-dimensional phase space describes the dynamic state of every particle in that system, as each particle is associated with three position variables and three momentum variables. In this sense, as long as the particles are [[Gibbs paradox|distinguishable]], a point in phase space is said to be a [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]] of the system. (For [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] a microstate will consist of a set of ''N''&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt; points, corresponding to all possible exchanges of the ''N'' particles.)  ''N'' is typically on the order of [[Avogadro's number]], thus describing the system at a microscopic level is often impractical. This leads  to the use of phase space in a different sense.

The phase space can also refer to the space that is parametrized by the ''macroscopic'' states of the system, such as pressure, temperature, etc. For instance, one may view the pressure-volume diagram or entropy-temperature diagrams as describing part of this phase space. A point in this phase space is correspondingly called a macrostate. There may easily be more than one microstate with the same macrostate. For example, for a fixed temperature, the system could have many dynamic configurations at the microscopic level. When used in this sense, a phase is a region of phase space where the system in question is in, for example, the [[liquid]] phase, or [[solid]] phase, etc.

Since there are many more microstates than macrostates, the phase space in the first sense is usually a [[manifold]] of much larger dimensions than in the second sense. Clearly, many more parameters are required to register every detail of the system down to the molecular or atomic scale than to simply specify, say, the temperature or the pressure of the system.

==Optics==
Phase space is extensively used in [[nonimaging optics]],&lt;ref name="IntroNio2e"&gt;{{cite book | first = Julio | last = Chaves | title = Introduction to Nonimaging Optics, Second Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e11ECgAAQBAJ | publisher = [[CRC Press]] |  year = 2015 | isbn = 978-1482206739}}&lt;/ref&gt; the branch of optics devoted to illumination. It is also an important concept in [[Hamiltonian optics]].

== Phase integral ==
In classical statistical mechanics (continuous energies) the concept of phase space provides a classical analog to the [[Partition function (mathematics)|partition function]] (sum over states) known as the phase integral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Laurendeau |first=Normand M. |title=Statistical Thermodynamics: Fundamentals and Applications |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-521-84635-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of summing the Boltzmann factor over discretely spaced energy states (defined by
appropriate integer [[quantum numbers]] for each degree of freedom) one may integrate over continuous phase space.  Such integration essentially consists of two parts: integration of the momentum component of all degrees of freedom (momentum space) and integration of the position component of all degrees of freedom (configuration space).  Once the phase integral is known, it may be related to the classical partition function by multiplication of a normalization constant representing the number of [[quantum energy states]] per unit phase space. This normalization constant is simply the inverse of [[Planck's constant]] raised to a power equal to the number of degrees of freedom for the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clesm.mae.ufl.edu/wiki.pub/index.php/Configuration_integral_%28statistical_mechanics%29|title=Configuration integral|last=Vu-Quoc|first=L.|year=2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428193950/http://clesm.mae.ufl.edu/wiki.pub/index.php/Configuration_integral_%28statistical_mechanics%29|archivedate=April 28, 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12495">'''Pocket set theory''' ('''PST''') is an [[alternative set theory]] in which there are only two infinite [[cardinal number]]s, ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ([[aleph-naught]], the cardinality of the set of all natural numbers) and ''c'' (the [[cardinality of the continuum]]). The theory was first suggested by [[Rudy Rucker]] in his ''Infinity and the Mind''.&lt;ref&gt;Rucker, Rudy, ''Infinity of the Mind'', Princeton UP, 1995, p.253.&lt;/ref&gt; The details set out in this entry are due to the American mathematician Randall M. Holmes.

== Arguments supporting PST ==
There are at least two independent arguments in favor of a small set theory like '''PST'''.
#One can get the impression from mathematical practice outside set theory that there are “only two infinite cardinals which demonstrably ‘occur in nature’ (the cardinality of the natural numbers and the cardinality of the continuum),”&lt;ref&gt;''Pocket Set Theory'', p.8.{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore “set theory produces far more superstructure than is needed to support classical mathematics.”&lt;ref&gt;''Alternative Set Theories'', p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it may be an exaggeration (one can get into a situation in which one has to talk about arbitrary sets of real numbers or real functions), with some technical tricks&lt;ref&gt;See ''Pocket Set Theory'', p.8. on encoding.&lt;/ref&gt; a considerable portion of mathematics can be reconstructed within '''PST'''; certainly enough for most of its practical applications.
#A second argument arises from [[Foundations of mathematics|foundational]] considerations. Most of mathematics can be [[Implementation of mathematics in set theory|implemented]] in [[Axiomatic set theory|standard set theory]] or one of its large alternatives. Set theories, on the other hand, are introduced in terms of a logical system; in most cases it is [[first-order logic]]. The syntax and semantics of first-order logic, on the other hand, is built on set-theoretical grounds. Thus, there is a foundational circularity, which forces us to choose as weak a theory as possible for [[bootstrapping]]. This line of thought, again, leads to small set theories.
Thus, there are reasons to think that Cantor's infinite hierarchy of the infinites is superfluous. Pocket set theory is a “minimalistic” set theory that allows for only two infinites: the [[Aleph number#Aleph-null|cardinality &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;]] of the (standard) natural numbers and the [[Cardinality of the continuum|cardinality &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{2^{\aleph_0}}&lt;/math&gt;]] of the (standard) reals.

== The theory ==

'''PST''' uses standard first-order language with identity and the binary relation symbol &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \in }&lt;/math&gt;. Ordinary variables are upper case ''X'', ''Y'', etc. In the intended interpretation, the variables these stand for [[Class (set theory)|classes]], and the atomic formula &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ X \in Y }&lt;/math&gt; means "class ''X'' is an element of class ''Y''". A ''set'' is a class that is an element of a class. Small case variables ''x'', ''y'', etc. stand for sets. A ''proper class'' is a class that is not a set. Two classes are [[Equinumerosity|''equinumerous'']] iff a [[bijection]] exists between them. A class is ''infinite'' iff it is equinumerous with one of its proper subclasses. The axioms of PST are
:'''(A1)''' (''extensionality'') — Classes that have the same elements are the same.

::&lt;math&gt; \forall z \, ( z \in X \leftrightarrow z \in Y ) \rightarrow X = Y &lt;/math&gt;

:'''(A2)''' (''class comprehension'') — If &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle{\phi (x)} &lt;/math&gt; is a formula, then there exists a class the elements of which are exactly those sets ''x'' that satisfy &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle{\phi (x)} &lt;/math&gt;.
:: &lt;math&gt; \exists Y \forall x \, ( x \in Y \leftrightarrow \phi (x)) &lt;/math&gt;

:'''(A3)''' (''axiom of infinity'') — There is an infinite set, and all infinite sets are equinumerous.
:: &lt;math&gt; \exists x \, ( \mathrm{inf}(x) \land \forall y \, ( \mathrm{inf}(y) \rightarrow x \approx y ) ) &lt;/math&gt;
::(inf(''x'') stands for “''x'' is infinite”; &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ x \approx y }&lt;/math&gt; abbreviates that ''x'' is equinumerous with ''y''.)
:'''(A4)''' (''limitation of size'') – A class is a proper class if and only if it is equinumerous with all proper classes.

::&lt;math&gt; \forall X \forall Y \, ( ( \mathrm{pr}(X) \land \mathrm{pr}(Y) ) \leftrightarrow ( \mathrm{pr}(X) \land X \approx Y ) )&lt;/math&gt;
::(pr(''X'') stands for “''X'' is a proper class”.)

== Remarks on the axioms ==
* Although different kinds of variables are used for classes and sets, the language is not many-sorted; sets are identified with classes having the same extension. Small case variables are used as mere abbreviations for various contexts; e.g.,
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \, \phi (x) \Leftrightarrow_{\mathrm{def}} \forall X \, ( \mathrm{set}(X) \rightarrow \phi (X) )&lt;/math&gt;
* Since the quantification in A2 ranges over classes, i.e., &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle{\phi (x)} &lt;/math&gt; is not set-bound, A2 is the comprehension scheme of [[Morse–Kelley set theory]], not that of [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]]. This extra strength of A2 is employed in the definition of the ordinals (not presented here).
* Since there is no [[axiom of pairing]], it must be proved that for any two sets ''x'' and ''y'', the [[Ordered pair#Kuratowski definition|Kuratowski pair]] {{''x''},{''x'',''y''}} exists and is a set. Hence proving that there exists a [[one-to-one correspondence]] between two classes does not prove that they are equinumerous.
*Pocket set theory is analogous to third order arithmetic, with the sets and classes corresponding to subsets of the natural numbers and subsets of the powerset of the natural numbers.
*A model for pocket set theory is given by taking the sets of pocket set theory to be the constructible elements of ''HC'' (the set of hereditarily countable sets), and the classes to be the constructible subsets of ''HC''.

== Some PST theorems ==

;1. The Russell class &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \mathrm{R}}&lt;/math&gt; is a proper class. (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \mathrm{R} =_{\mathrm{def}} \{ x\,|\,x\notin x\} }&lt;/math&gt;)
:''Proof''. &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \mathrm{R}}&lt;/math&gt; cannot be a set by [[Russell's paradox]]. ∎
;2. The empty class &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \emptyset }&lt;/math&gt; is a set. (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \emptyset =_{\mathrm{def}} \{ x\,|\,x\neq x\} }&lt;/math&gt;)
:''Proof''. Suppose ([[Reductio ad absurdum#In mathematics|towards a contradiction]]) that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \emptyset }&lt;/math&gt; is a proper class. By (A4), &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \emptyset }&lt;/math&gt; must be equinumerous with &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \mathrm{R}}&lt;/math&gt;, in which case &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \mathrm{R}}&lt;/math&gt; is empty. Let ''i'' be an infinite set, and consider the class &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \{ i\} }&lt;/math&gt;. It is not equinumerous with &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \emptyset }&lt;/math&gt;, thus it is a set. It is finite, but its single element is infinite, thus it cannot be an element of itself. Therefore, it is an element of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \mathrm{R}}&lt;/math&gt;. This contradicts that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \mathrm{R}}&lt;/math&gt; is empty. ∎
;3. The singleton class &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \{\emptyset\} }&lt;/math&gt; is a set.
:''Proof''. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \{\emptyset\} }&lt;/math&gt; is a proper class. Then by (A4), every proper class is a singleton. Let ''i'' be an infinite set and consider the class &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\{\emptyset,i\}}&lt;/math&gt;. It is neither a proper class (because it is not singleton) nor an element of itself (because it is neither empty nor infinite). Thus &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\{\emptyset,i\}\in R}&lt;/math&gt; holds by definition, so &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \mathrm{R}}&lt;/math&gt; has at least two elements, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \emptyset }&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\{\emptyset,i\}}&lt;/math&gt;. This contradicts the initial assumption that proper classes are singletons. ∎
;4. &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \mathrm{R}}&lt;/math&gt; is infinite.
:''Proof''. Let &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathrm{R}^- =_{\mathrm{def}} \mathrm{R} \setminus \{\emptyset\}}&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that this class is a set. Then either &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathrm{R}^- \in \mathrm{R}^-}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathrm{R}^- \notin \mathrm{R}^-}&lt;/math&gt;. In the first case, the definition of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathrm{R}^-}&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathrm{R}^- \in \mathrm{R}}&lt;/math&gt;, from, which it follows that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathrm{R}^- \notin \mathrm{R}^-}&lt;/math&gt;, a contradiction. In the second case, the definition of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathrm{R}^-}&lt;/math&gt; implies either &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathrm{R}^- \notin \mathrm{R}}&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathrm{R}^- \in \mathrm{R}^-}&lt;/math&gt;, a contradiction, or &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathrm{R}^- = \emptyset}&lt;/math&gt;. But &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathrm{R}^-}&lt;/math&gt; cannot be empty because it has at least one element, namely &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\{\emptyset\}}&lt;/math&gt;. ∎
;5. Every finite class is a set.
:''Proof''. Let ''X'' be a proper class. By (A4), there exists an &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{F:X\longrightarrow \mathrm{R}}&lt;/math&gt; such that ''F'' is a bijection. This contains a pair &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\langle x_0,\emptyset \rangle}&lt;/math&gt;, and for each member ''r'' of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathrm{R}^-}&lt;/math&gt; , a pair &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\langle x,r\rangle}&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X^-=X\setminus \lbrace x_0\rbrace}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{F^-=F\setminus \lbrace \langle x_0,\emptyset \rangle \rbrace}&lt;/math&gt;. By (A4), both of these classes exist. Now, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{F^-:X^-\longrightarrow \mathrm{R}^-}&lt;/math&gt; is a bijection. Thus by (A4), &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X^-}&lt;/math&gt; is a proper class, too. Clearly, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X^-\subseteq X}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X^-\neq X}&lt;/math&gt;. Now, another application of (A4) shows that there exists a bijection &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{G:X\longrightarrow X^-}&lt;/math&gt;. This proves that ''X'' is infinite. ∎
Once the above facts are settled, the following results can be proved:
;6. The class V of sets (&lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle{\mathrm{V} =_{\mathrm{def}} \{ x\,|\mathrm{set}(x)\}} &lt;/math&gt;) consists of all hereditarily countable sets.
;7. Every proper class has the cardinality &lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak c}&lt;/math&gt;.
:''Proof''. Let ''i'' be an infinite set, in which case the class &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle{\mathcal{P}(i)} &lt;/math&gt; has cardinality &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{2^{\aleph_0}}&lt;/math&gt;. By (A4), all proper classes have cardinality &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{2^{\aleph_0}}&lt;/math&gt;. ∎
;8. The union class of a set is a set.

'''PST''' also verifies the:
*[[Continuum hypothesis]]. This follows from (5) and (6) above;
*[[Axiom of replacement]]. This is a consequence of (A4);
*[[Axiom of choice]]. ''Proof''. The class ''Ord'' of all ordinals is well-ordered by definition. ''Ord'' and the class ''V'' of all sets are both proper classes, because of the [[Burali-Forti paradox]] and  [[Cantor's paradox]], respectively. Therefore there exists a bijection between ''V'' and ''Ord'', which well-orders ''V''. ∎

The [[well-foundedness]] of all sets is neither provable nor disprovable in '''PST'''.

== Possible extensions ==

*Adding the so-called ''axiom of free construction'' to '''PST''', any consistent system of set-theoretical axioms will have an inner model in the resulting system.
*It is an unfriendly feature of '''PST''' that it cannot handle classes of sets of real numbers or classes of sets of real functions. However, it is not a necessary one. (A3) can be modified various ways to allow for various portions of the usual hierarchy of infinites, with or without supporting the continuum hypothesis. One example is
:&lt;math&gt; \exists x \exists y \,( \mathrm{inf}(x) \land \mathrm{inf}(y) \land |\mathcal{P}(x)| \neq |\mathcal{P}(y)| \land \forall z ( \mathrm{inf}(z) \rightarrow ( |z|=|x| \lor |z|=|y| ) ) ) &lt;/math&gt;
:In this version, the cardinality of an infinite set is either &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;, and the cardinality of a proper class is &lt;math&gt;2^{2^{\aleph_0}}&lt;/math&gt; (which means that the generalized continuum hypothesis holds).

'''Public hypersphere''' is a new kind of public sphere that has come into existence globally through the use of modern information technology, digital media, and computer networks.

Swedish writer [[Karl-Erik Tallmo]] used the corresponding Swedish term ''hyperoffentlighet'' in an article in the daily ''Sydsvenska Dagbladet'' in 1999&lt;ref&gt;Tallmo, K-E, "Konsten att låsa köksdörren på nätet", ''Sydsvenska Dagbladet'' November 25, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and the same year also the English expression ''public hypersphere'' in an article in the journal ''Human IT''.&lt;ref&gt;Tallmo, K-E, "Self-publishing: publicera själv eller publicera sig själv?", ''Human IT'' nr 3/1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is derived from [[Jürgen Habermas]] and his thoughts concerning a ''bourgeois public sphere''. The public hypersphere, however, is not limited to publishing or the European café culture, not even to the Internet but includes the larger part of human relations, mediated or not. It encompasses both voluntary participation as well as involuntary, through mass surveillance: "The electronic traces we leave constantly write our autobiographies ... [The public hypersphere is] a gas that fills the entire available space, it is 'the place that doesn't exist'." The public hypersphere is "not just public or transparent to a higher degree than the regular public sphere; it has a whole new structure. Mathematicians talk about ''hyperspheres'' when they want to describe a sphere of higher dimensionality, where normal geometric rules don't apply – here, the shortest path between two points is not necessarily a straight line."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://slowfox.wordpress.com/2005/04/04/our-new-public-hypersphere/

The French philosopher and media scholar [[Pierre Lévy]] used the expression  ''l'hypersphère publique'' in an article in 2011 in the journal ''Medium''. He describes the combined effect of social media, real time functions, and wireless technology. He mentions API programming as important when it comes to connecting various databases with different interfaces. He writes that traditional information monopolies are dissolved and a kind of ''[[digital ecosystem]]'' has evolved, where old and new media interact. Citizens gain new liberties in expressing and retrieving information but also new ways to establish personal contacts. All these new phenomena "contribute in building a ubiquitous medium, hypercomplex and fractal, that everyone, ''nolens volens'', partake in designing, directing and using ..."&lt;ref&gt;Lévy Pierre, "L'hypersphère publique", ''Médium'' nr 4/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Lévy has also written about the transformation of the public sphere in his book ''Cyberdémocratie'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;Lévy Pierre, ''Cyberdémocratie'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

In German, the word ''Hyperöffentlichkeit'' has been used by sociologist [[Udo Thiedeke]] in his characterization of [[Howard Rheingold | Howard Rheingold's]] ideas concerning the virtual community,&lt;ref&gt;Rheingold, H.S., ''The Virtual Community: Homestanding on the Electronic Frontier'' (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; that is a high degree of participation and interactivity.&lt;ref&gt;Thiedeke, Udo, "Virtuelle Gruppen. Begriff und Charakteristik", i ''Virtuelle Gruppen. Charakteristika und Problemdimensionen'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the site's author is celebrated in the 2012 novel ''The Master Blaster'' by writer and former Saipan [[Peace Corps]] Volunteer [[P. F.

''Saipan Sucks'' seeks to call attention to what it alleges to be systemic societal problems in the CNMI that are supported by misuse of United States taxpayer money.

Nepotism rules on the islands. Fueled by money paid by American taxpayers and diverted to the far-off territory, politicians run for office primarily for the sake of being in a position to appoint their relatives to high-paying sinecures.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The website presents allegations of [[Political corruption|corruption]], [[racism]], [[nepotism]], [[jury-rigging]], [[exploitation of labour|worker exploitation]], [[employment discrimination]], and mismanagement of the CNMI [[tourism]] industry by local CNMI officials, and seeks to warn U.S. mainlanders about moving to the islands to accept employment offers.&lt;ref name=SlursSaipan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beautify/&gt;&lt;ref name=CounterCritical/&gt;&lt;ref name="east-west"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AuthorUnknown/&gt;&lt;ref name="ssaboutsaipan"/&gt;

== Criticism ==

Since July 2001, shortly after ''Saipan Sucks'' was created, CNMI government officials criticized the website's [[Anonymity#Issues facing the anonymous|anonymity]] and characterized it as a "[[smear campaign]]". Stemming from its reported investigations, the CNMI government has threatened to [[lawsuit|sue]] the website's author for [[libel]] or [[defamation]].&lt;ref name=SlursSaipan/&gt;&lt;ref name=AuthorUnknown/&gt;&lt;ref name="st:7-27-01"&gt;{{Cite web

In November 2006, a local [[environmental group]], Beautify CNMI!, decried the website's high [[PageRank]] in search engines such as [[Google]], and the fact that anyone who searches with the [[Keyword (Internet search)|keyword]] "Saipan" could find the website in the top-ten search result positions. The group published a plan to counter the website's ranking through a campaign of [[linkspam]]ming via [[Google bomb]]ing and [[anchor text|text anchoring]].&lt;ref name=Beautify/&gt;&lt;ref name=CounterCritical/&gt;&lt;ref name="east-west"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sb:5-24-06"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.taotaotasi.com/2006/05/lets-do-something-about-saipan-sucks.html |title=Let's Do Something About Saipan Sucks! |accessdate=2006-11-23 |work=The Saipan Blog |date=May 24, 2006 |first=Angelo |last=Villagomez |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002073755/http://www.taotaotasi.com/2006/05/lets-do-something-about-saipan-sucks.html |archivedate=October 2, 2011 }} Villagomez is Restoration Chairman of Beautify CNMI!

All along, counter-critics who are either [[Chamorros]] (indigenous people of Saipan) or those otherwise knowledgeable about the CNMI have maintained that, although ''Saipan Sucks'' uses [[hyperbole]] as a [[literary device]], much or most of what it states is true and should be heeded.&lt;ref name="msncache"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cc.msnscache.com/cache.aspx?q=4779841890975&amp;lang=en-US&amp;mkt=en-US&amp;FORM=CVRE |title=Putting things in perspective |accessdate=2006-11-24 |publisher=Beautify CNMI! |date=Nov 16, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="st:7-26-01"&gt;{{Cite web

''Saipan Sucks'' was written by a person or persons going by the pseudonym "Forgetabilia".

[[Image:JIE_Sankey_V5_Fig1.png|thumb|400px|Sankey's original 1898 diagram showing energy efficiency of a steam engine.]]

'''Sankey diagrams''' are a specific type of [[flow diagram]], in which the width of the arrows is shown proportionally to the flow quantity.

The illustration shows a Sankey diagram which represents all the primary energy flows into a factory. The widths of the bands are directly proportional to energy production, utilization and losses. The primary energy sources are gas, electricity and coal/oil and represent energy inputs at the left hand side of the Sankey diagram. They can also visualize the energy accounts, material flow accounts on a regional or national level, and also the breakdown of cost of item or services.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Sankey diagrams put a visual emphasis on the major transfers or flows within a system. They are helpful in locating dominant contributions to an overall flow. Often, Sankey diagrams show conserved quantities within defined system boundaries.

== History ==
Sankey diagrams are named after Irish Captain [[Matthew Henry Phineas Riall Sankey]], who used this type of [[diagram]] in 1898 in a classic figure (see panel on the right) showing the [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]] of a [[steam engine]]. While the first charts in black and white were merely used to display one type of flow (e.g. steam), using colors for different types of flows has added more degrees of freedom to Sankey diagrams.

One of the most famous Sankey diagrams is [[Charles Minard]]'s Map of Napoleon's Russian Campaign of 1812. It is a [[flow map]], overlaying a Sankey diagram onto a geographical map. It was created in 1869, so it actually predates Sankey's 'first' Sankey diagram of 1898.

[[File:Minard.png|thumb|none|400px|Minard's classic diagram of [[Napoleon]]'s [[French invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]], using the feature now named after Sankey.]]

== Science == 
[[File:Earth_heat_balance_Sankey_diagram.svg|thumb|250px|[[Earth's energy budget]] &amp;ndash; line thickness is linearly proportional to relative amount of energy]]
Sankey diagrams are often used in fields of science, especially physics. They are used to represent energy inputs, useful output, and wasted output.

== Active examples ==
The United States Energy Information Administration (EIA) produces numerous Sankey diagrams annually in its ''Annual Energy Review''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Energy Review|url=http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/annual/|website=Energy Information Administration|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which illustrate the production and consumption of various forms of energy. 

[[Eurostat]], the Statistical Office of the European Union, has developed an interactive Sankey web tool to visualise energy data by means of flow diagrams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy balance flow for European Union (28 countries) 2015|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/sankey/sankey.html?geo=EU28&amp;year=2015&amp;unit=KTOE&amp;fuels=0000&amp;highlight=&amp;nodeDisagg=0101000000&amp;flowDisagg=false|website=Eurostat|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tool allows the building and customisation of diagrams by playing with different options (country, year, fuel, level of detail).

The [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA) created an interactive Sankey web application] that details the flow of energy for the entire planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Balance (2015)|url=http://www.iea.org/Sankey/#?c=World&amp;s=Balance|website=International Energy Agency (IEA)|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users can select specific countries, points of time back to 1973, and modify the arrangement of various flows within the Sankey diagram.

The US Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore Laboratory maintains a site of Sankey diagrams, including US energy flow and carbon flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LLNL Flow Charts|url=https://flowcharts.llnl.gov/|website=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ben Schmidt, an assistant professor of history at Northeastern University, created a Sankey diagram relating majors in college to eventual careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmidt|first1=Ben|title=What are you going to do with that degree?|url=http://benschmidt.org/jobs/|website=Ben Schmidt|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bodhipakkhiyadhamma}}
In [[Buddhism]], the '''Seven Factors of Awakening''' ([[Pali]]: ''satta bojjha{{IAST|ṅ}}gā'' or ''satta sambojjha{{IAST|ṅ}}gā''; [[Sanskrit|Skt.]]: ''sapta bodhyanga'') are:

* '''Mindfulness''' (''[[mindfulness (Buddhism)|sati]]''). To maintain awareness of reality ([[dhamma|''dharma'']]).
* '''Investigation''' of the nature of reality (''[[dhamma vicaya]]'').
* '''Energy''' (''[[Vīrya|viriya]]'') also determination, effort
* '''Joy''' or '''rapture''' (''[[pīti]]'')
* '''Relaxation''' or '''tranquility''' (''[[passaddhi]]'') of both body and mind
* '''Concentration''', clear awareness (''[[samādhi (Buddhism)|sam&amp;#x101;dhi]]'') a calm, one-pointed state of concentration of mind,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g.,  Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), entry for "Samādhi," retrieved 3 Feb. 2011 from "U.Chicago" at  {{cite web |url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:3397.pali |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120709035335/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:3397.pali |archivedate=2012-07-09 |df= }} .&lt;/ref&gt; or clear awareness
* '''Equanimity''' (''[[upekkha]]''). To accept reality as-it-is (''yatha-bhuta'') without craving or aversion.

This evaluation of seven awakening factors is one of the "Seven Sets" of "Awakening-related states" (''[[bodhipakkhiyadhamma]]'').

The Pali word ''bojjhanga'' is a compound of ''[[bodhi]]'' ("awakening," "enlightenment") and ''anga'' ("factor").&lt;ref&gt;For instance, see Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 490, [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:3371.pali entry for "Bojjhanga" (retrieved 10 Jul 2007).]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Satta sambojjha{{IAST|ṅ}}gā:
* satta - seven;
* [[Bodhi|bodh]] - an [[abstract noun]] formed from the verbal root ''*budh-'' (to awake, become aware, notice, know or understand) corresponding to the verbs ''bujjhati'' (Pāli) and ''bodhati'' or ''budhyate'' (Sanskrit);
* aṅga - a part of a whole; factor, cause.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pali.hum.ku.dk/cpd/search.html Critical Pali Dictionary, ''aṅga'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pali literature==
In the [[Sutta Pitaka]]'s [[Samyutta Nikaya]], the bojjhangas refer to wholesome, mundane factors ''leading to'' enlightenment.  In the [[Abhidhamma]] and [[Pali literature|Pali commentaries]], the bojjhangas tend to refer to supramundane factors ''concurrent with'' enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000), p. 1499.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sutta Pitaka===
According to one discourse in the Samyutta Nikaya entitled "Bhikkhu Sutta" ([[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 46.5):
:[Bhikkhu:] "Venerable sir, it is said, 'factors of enlightenment, factors of enlightenment.' In what sense are they called factors of enlightenment?"
:[Buddha:] "They lead to enlightenment, bhikkhu, therefore they are called factors of enlightenment...."&lt;ref&gt;''Bhikkhu Sutta'' (SN 46.5), trans. Bodhi (2000), p. 1574.  See also Walshe (1985), [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/walshe/wheel318.html#n-265 n. 265.]&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]], one may contemplate the seven Factors of Enlightenment as well as on their antithesis, the [[Five Hindrances]] ([[kama|sensual pleasure]], ill-will, sloth-torpor, restlessness-worry, doubt).&lt;ref&gt;For an example of a discourse that includes the juxtaposition of these two sets of phenomena, see the [[Satipatthana Sutta]].  For a group of discourses in which these two sets of phenomena are juxtaposed, see [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 46.31 to 46.40 (Bodhi, 2000, pp. 1501, 1589-94).&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, one Samyutta Nikaya sutta identifies developing each of the enlightenment factors accompanied by each of the four [[brahmavihara|brahma vihara]]s ([[metta|lovingkindness]], [[Karuṇā|compassion]], [[mudita|sympathetic joy]], [[upekkha|equanimity]]).&lt;ref&gt;SN 46.54, variously known as the ''Mettaasahagata Sutta'' (CSCD) or ''Metta Sutta'' (SLTP) or ''Metta.m Sutta'' (PTS Feer).  See Bodhi (2000), pp. 1607-11; Walshe (1985), [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/walshe/wheel318.html#passage-59 sutta 59], pp. 71-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Samyutta Nikaya's "Fire Discourse," the Buddha identifies that mindfulness is "always useful" (''sabbatthika''); while, when one's mind is sluggish, one should develop the enlightenment factors of investigation, energy and joy; and, when one's mind is excited, one should develop the enlightenment factors of tranquility, concentration and equanimity.&lt;ref name="aggi sutta"&gt;"Fire Discourse" (''Aggi Sutta'', [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 46.53) (Bodhi, 2000, pp. 1605-7; Walshe, 1985, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/walshe/wheel318.html#passage-58 sutta 58], pp. 69-70).&lt;/ref&gt;

Again according to the Samyutta Nikaya, once when the Buddha was gravely ill he asked Venerable Mahacunda to recite the seven Factors of Enlightenment to him. In such a way the Buddha was cured of his illness.&lt;ref&gt;''Gilana Sutta'' ([[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 46.16) [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn46/sn46.016.piya.html (Piyadassi, 1999;] [http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhism/bp_sut14.htm Piyadassi, n.d.).]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abhidhamma and commentarial literature===
In the [[Visuddhimagga]], in a section discussing skills needed for the attainment and maintenance of absorption (''[[jhana]]''), [[Buddhaghosa]] identifies the bojjhangas in the following fashion:
* "Strong mindfulness ... is needed in all instances...."
* "When his mind is slack with over-laxness of energy, etc., then ... he should develop those [three enlightenment factors] beginning with investigation-of-states..." (i.e., ''dhamma vicaya, viriya, piti'').
* "When his mind is agitated through over-energeticness, etc., then ... he should develop those [three enlightenment factors] beginning with tranquility..." (i.e., ''passaddhi, samadhi, upekkha'').&lt;ref&gt;Buddhaghosa &amp; {{IAST|Ñāṇamoli}} (1999), pp. 129, 131.  Note that Buddhaghosa clearly references the last six ''bojjhangas'' in the last two cited statements.  The first statement about ''sati'' (mindfulness), while immediately preceding mention of the ''bojjhangas'', is technically in reference to the five spiritual faculties (''[[indriya]]'').  See also SN 46.53 (Bodhi, 2000, pp. 1605-7; Walshe, 1985, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/walshe/wheel318.html#passage-58 sutta 58], pp. 69-70).&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

The seven factors of awakening are closely related to the practice of ''dhyana'', resembling the various factors that are part of the four dhyanas.&lt;ref&gt;Gethin, ''Tha Buddhis Path to Awakening'', chapter five; Arbel (2017), ''Early Buddhist Meditation''&lt;/ref&gt;

In meditation everyone most likely experiences two of the [[five hindrances]] (Pāli: pañca nīvaraṇāni). They are '''sloth and torpor''' (Pāli: thīna-middha), which is half-hearted action with little or no collectedness, and '''restlessness and worry''' (uddhacca-kukkucca), which is the inability to calm the mind.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

As indicated above, in the "Fire Discourse" ([[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 46.53), it is recommended that joy or rapture, investigation, and energy are to be developed when experiencing sloth and torpor. Relaxation, concentration, and equanimity are to be developed when experiencing restlessness or worry. Mindfulness should be constantly present to remain aware of physical change as well as mental change in either skillful or unskillful direction.&lt;ref name="aggi sutta" /&gt;

'''Sexual harassment in the military''' is unwanted [[Human sexual activity|sexual behaviour]], which is defined as threatening, offensive, or otherwise upsetting to others in a [[military]] setting. The behaviour is more common in the military than in [[civilian]] life. Women are substantially more likely than men to experience [[sexual harassment]] in the armed forces. Other groups at higher risk include child cadets/recruits and military [[Detention (imprisonment)|detainees]].

== Behaviour ==
{{Main|Sexual harassment}}

Sexual harassment in the military includes a broad spectrum of behaviour. Undirected behaviours that affect the working environment, such as sexist jokes and the prominent display of [[Pornography|pornographic material]], may constitute sexual harassment, as do directed behaviours targeted at one or more individuals, such as unwanted sexual advances and [[sexual assault]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/538E55EE-9CA4-4177-9A0B-6853A431B283/0/20060522SRReport.pdf|title=Quantitative &amp; qualitative research into sexual harassment in the armed forces|last=Rutherford|first=Sarah|last2=Schneider|first2=Robin|date=2006|website=|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121018171845/http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/538E55EE-9CA4-4177-9A0B-6853A431B283/0/20060522SRReport.pdf|archive-date=2012-10-18|dead-url=bot: unknown|access-date=2018-03-08|last3=Walmsley|first3=Alexis|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in Canada has found that a culture of undirected sexual harassment increases the risk of directed sexual harassment and assault.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Case examples ===
In the [[British Army|British army]], a woman told the following story to researchers in 2006:&lt;blockquote&gt;‘A friend was out on an [[Military exercise|exercise]] when a group of men ducked her head in a bucket of water and each time she came up for breath she had to repeat “I am useless and I am a female”. She told the story and said it was a joke but I could see she was upset.’&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the [[Canadian Armed Forces|Canadian armed forces]], demeaning attitudes to women are pervasive, according to the ''Deschamps Review'' of 2015:&lt;blockquote&gt;'Interviewees reported regularly being told of orders to “stop being pussies” and to “leave your purses at home” [...] The use of the word “cunt”, for example, is commonplace, and rape jokes are tolerated. [...] A commonly held attitude is that, rather than be a soldier, a sailor or an aviator, a woman will be labeled an “ice princess”, a “bitch”, or a “slut”. Another saying is that women enter the CAF “to find a man, to leave a man, or to become a man”.'&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;A woman in the [[French Army|French army]], [[pseudonym]]ised by the ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'' newspaper as Captain Carole, was [[rape]]d by her commanding officer:&lt;blockquote&gt;'It was months before I could pronounce the word "rape"... I blamed myself. I said: "We are trained in hand to hand combat. Why didn’t I stop him?" But when that happens you are terrorised.'&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/france-battles-sexual-abuse-in-the-military-9271383.html|title=France battles sexual abuse in the military|last=Lichfield|first=John|date=2014-04-20|work=Independent|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Prevalence and risk factors ==
Studies of sexual harassment have found that it is markedly more common in [[military]] than [[civilian]] settings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/828143812|title=Military psychologists' desk reference|last=Anderson|first=E H|last2=Suris|first2=A|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-19-992826-2|editor-last=Moore|editor-first=Brett A|location=Oxford|pages=264–269|chapter=Military sexual trauma|oclc=828143812|editor-last2=Barnett|editor-first2=Jeffrey E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several reasons for this have been suggested. A Canadian study found that key risk factors associated with military settings are the typically young age of personnel, the isolated locations of bases, the minority status of women, and the disproportionate number of men in senior positions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cimvhr.ca/conference/mh-symposium/documents/presentations/5-Watkins.pdf|title=Sexual Assault in the Canadian Armed Forces: Prevalence, Circumstances, Correlates, and Mental Health Associations|last=Watkins|first=Kimberley|last2=Bennett|first2=Rachel|date=|website=|access-date=2018-03-08|last3=Richer|first3=Isabelle|last4=Zamorski|first4=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Canadian research has found that an emphasis in military organisations on [[conformity]], [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]], and [[Hierarchy|hierarchical power relations]], combine to increase the risk, particularly to personnel of low rank, who are less able than others to resist inappropriate expectations made of them.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The [[Masculinity|traditionally masculine]] values and behaviours that are rewarded and reinforced in military settings are also thought to play a role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gallagher|first=Kathryn E.|last2=Parrott|first2=Dominic J.|date=May 2011|title=What accounts for men's hostile attitudes toward women?

Canadian research has also found that the risk of sexual misconduct increases during deployment on [[military operation]]s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Principal targets ==

=== Female personnel ===
While some male personnel are sexually harassed, women are substantially more likely to be affected.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Women who are younger and joined the military at a younger age face a greater risk, according to American, British, Canadian, and French research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.apha.org/policies-and-advocacy/public-health-policy-statements/policy-database/2014/07/23/11/19/cessation-of-military-recruiting-in-public-elementary-and-secondary-schools|title=Cessation of Military Recruiting in Public Elementary and Secondary Schools|last=American Public Heatlh Association|date=2013-10-30|website=www.apha.org|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

=== Detainees ===
Individuals detained by the military are particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment. During the [[Iraq War]], for example, personnel of the [[United States Army|US army]] and [[Central Intelligence Agency|US Central Intelligence Agency]] committed a number of [[human rights violations]] against detainees in the [[Abu Ghraib prison]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/abu_ghraib/2006/03/14/chapter_5/index.html|title=Other government agencies|last=Greenwald|first=Glenn|publisher=Salon.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212035108/http://www.salon.com/news/abu_ghraib/2006/03/14/chapter_5/index.html|archivedate=February 12, 2008|deadurl=yes|accessdate=April 3, 2012|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[rape]], [[sodomy]], and other forms of sexual abuse.&lt;ref name="New Yorker 2004-05-17"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/05/17/040517fa_fact2?currentPage=all|title=Chain of Command|last=Hersh|first=Seymour M.|date=May 17, 2004|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=September 13, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101055751/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/05/17/040517fa_fact2?currentPage=all|archivedate=January 1, 2012|deadurl=no|quote=NBC News later quoted U.S. military officials as saying that the unreleased photographs showed American soldiers "severely beating an Iraqi prisoner nearly to death, having sex with a female Iraqi prisoner, and 'acting inappropriately with a dead body.'

== Barriers to redress ==
Although the risk of sexual misconduct in the armed forces is widely acknowledged, personnel are frequently reluctant to report incidents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/1168765/dod-releases-latest-military-sexual-assault-report/|title=DoD Releases Latest Military Sexual Assault Report|last=US, Department of Defence|date=2017-05-01|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; For example:
* An official report of the [[Australian Defence Force]] concluded that women affected by harassment were less likely to make a complaint because they do not expect a serious response.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.defenceabusetaskforce.gov.au/Reports/Documents/Dart-final-report-2016.pdf|title=Defence Abuse Response Taskforce: Final report|last=Defence Abuse Response Taskforce|date=2016|website=|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[ombudsman]] of the [[Canadian Armed Forces|Canadian armed forces]] confirmed that women fear the consequences if they report a sexual offence against them to their [[command hierarchy|chain of command]]: 'The fear of repercussions is blatant,' he said in 2014.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; In 2015, the Deschamps Review reported that one of the main reasons why personnel do not lodge a complaint is a fear of the consequences for their career and that there had many complainants had faced reprisals.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* Leila Minano, the co-author of a book documenting sexual abuse in the [[French Armed Forces|French armed forces]], commented that complaints from women were systematically discouraged from complaining, and were often moved out of their unit if they did so.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;
* In the UK, an official report on sexual harassment in the [[British Army|British army]] found that almost half of personnel who had an 'upsetting' experience of sexual harassment did not complain for fear of an impact on their career.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* In the [[United States Armed Forces|US armed forces]], a study in 2016 found that 58% of women who reported sexual misconduct by peers said that they had met with retaliation as a consequence.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/sexual-assault-reports-u-s-military-reach-record-high-pentagon-n753566|title=Sexual assault reports in U.S. military reach record high, Pentagon says|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Defense estimated in 2017 that two in three victims of sexual assault do not report it.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Since the number of official complaints represents only a fraction of sexual harassment in the military,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sapr.mil/public/docs/reports/FY16_Annual/FY16_SAPRO_Annual_Report.pdf|title=Department of Defense Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military: Fiscal Year 2016|last=US, Department of Defense|date=2017|website=|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; armed forces that have committed to reduce prevalence produce periodic estimates of its extent using anonymised surveys.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Mental health effects ==
Women affected by sexual harassment are more likely than other women to suffer [[Stress (biology)|stress]]-related [[Mental disorder|mental illness]] afterwards.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Research in the US found that when [[sexual abuse]] of female military personnel is [[Psychological trauma|psychiatrically traumatic]], the odds of suffering from [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) after deployment on operations increase by a factor of nine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Research in the US has found that personnel affected by sexual harassment are somewhat less likely to develop depression or PTSD if a formal report leads to effective action to address the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bell|first=Margret E.|last2=Street|first2=Amy E.|last3=Stafford|first3=Jane|date=2014|title=Victims' psychosocial well-being after reporting sexual harassment in the military|journal=Journal of trauma &amp; dissociation: the official journal of the International Society for the Study of Dissociation (ISSD)|volume=15|issue=2|pages=133–152|doi=10.1080/15299732.2014.867563|issn=1529-9740|pmid=24410254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The military leadership in some countries has begun to acknowledge a culture of sexual misconduct in the armed forces. For example:
* The British armed forces co-commissioned their first formal study of the problem in 2006, and in 2016 the head of the [[British Army|British army]] noted the ‘overly sexualised’ soldier culture and committed to reducing the extent of sexual misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/14/army-has-overly-sexualised-heavy-drinking-culture-head-of-armed/|title=Army has 'overly-sexualised' heavy drinking culture, Chief of General Staff admits|last=Farmer|first=Ben|date=2016-06-14|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2016, after a major study uncovered widespread sexual harassment and assault in the Canadian armed forces, [[Jonathan Vance|General Jonathan Vance]], Chief of the Defence Staff, acknowledged: 'Harmful sexual behaviour is a real problem in our institution.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/sexual-misconduct-military-survey-1.3868377|title=960 soldiers reported being sexually assaulted in the past year|last=Harris|first=Kathleen|date=2016-11-28|work=CBC News|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The US established the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office in 2005, which reports annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sapr.mil/index.php/about/mission-and-history|title=Mission &amp; History|last=US, Department of Defense|date=2018|website=|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual harassment in the military, by country ==

=== Australia ===
Widespread reports of sexual harassment in the [[Australian Defence Force|Australian armed forces]] led to the establishment of the [[Defence Abuse Response Taskforce]] to investigate complaints from women between 1991 and 2011. It received 2,439 complaints, of which it deemed 1,751 to be plausible.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

A [[Royal Commission]] into institutional [[child sexual abuse]] was established in 2012, which investigated widespread allegations of historical abuse in the navy.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The Commission took evidence from 8,000 individuals&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.childabuseroyalcommission.gov.au/private-sessions|title=Private sessions|last=Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse|date=2017-05-30|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reported in 2017 that many recruits of both sexes and from the age of 15 had been repeatedly sexually abused by older recruits between 1967 and 1971, including by anal [[gang rape]], and in some cases young recruits had been forced to rape each other.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The practice was ‘tolerated’ by senior staff, according to the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/22/navy-staff-tolerated-widespread-child-sexual-abuse-of-recruits-royal-commission-says|title=Navy staff tolerated widespread child sexual abuse of recruits, royal commission says|last=Australian Associated Press|date=2017-08-22|website=Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Further|Defence Abuse Response Taskforce|Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse}}

=== Canada ===
{{Main|Sexual assault in the Canadian Forces}}According to official statistics gathered by [[Maclean's|''Maclean's'' magazine]], the Canadian military police received an average of 178 complaints of sexual assault between 2000 and 2014, representing an estimated 10% of all cases.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

In 2014, the [[ombudsman]] of the Canadian armed forces described sexual harassment in the institution as 'a huge problem'.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

In 2015, after widespread allegations of sexual misconduct in the military, a major official report, the ''External Review into Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Harassment in the Canadian Armed Forces'' (the ''Deschamps Review''), was published.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It found that sexual harassment was commonplace and embedded in military culture, and that pervasive degrading attitudes to women and LGBTQ personnel were jeopardising their safety.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The ''Deschamps Review'' also criticised the armed forces for a culture of dismissiveness.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; One male interview told the Review, for example: "Girls that come to the Army know what to expect." It stated that senior [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] are frequently seen as tolerating sexual harassment and discouraging the individuals affected from making a complaint.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The following year, in 2016, a major study of 43,000 [[Canadian Armed Forces|Canadian armed forces]] personnel reported that 27% of female personnel reported at least one incident of sexual assault since they joined the military, and 5% of female regular armed forces personnel reported the same in the previous 12 months (equivalent to approximately 960 women per year).

=== France ===
The extent of sexual harassment in the [[French Armed Forces|French armed forces]] first came to light in 2014 when 35 cases of sexual harassment and assault were detailed in ''La Guerre Invisible'', a book by Leila Minano and Julia Pascual.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/871236655|title=La guerre invisible: révélations sur les violences sexuelles dans l'armée française|last=Leila|first=Miñano|last2=Pascual|first2=Julia|publisher=Les Arènes|others=|year=2014|isbn=2352043026|location=Paris|pages=|language=fr|oclc=871236655}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'' newspaper, the armed forces had not been required to report incidents or to keep statistics, and an official report acknowledged that awareness of the problem had been institutionally suppressed.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
Following concerns expressed in 2004 by the UK Equal Opportunities Commission (now the [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]]) about persistent sexual harassment in the British armed forces,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; a number of anonymised, official surveys have been undertaken. The first, in 2006, found that a male-dominated culture sexualised women and diminished their military competence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Among the comments made to researchers by male personnel about their female counterparts were: ‘Ok there are a few exceptions but on the whole they [women] shouldn’t be here.’; 'They're all [[lesbian]]s or [[slut]]s.'; and 'They are emotionally unstable.'&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The report found that 15% of women had had a 'particularly upsetting' experience of sexual harassment in the previous 12 months; the proportion rose to 20% in the youngest age group.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A similar survey in 2009 found the 8% of women in the army had had a ‘particularly upsetting’ experience in the previous 12 months, and the most recent survey, in 2015, found that 13% of women reported the same.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2017, a [[Panorama (TV series)|BBC ''Panorama'']] documentary found multiple cases of the sexual abuse of cadets from age 11 during the 1980s, and reported that the victims and their parents were discouraged from making a formal complaint or contacting the police.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The [[Ministry of Defence]] paid £2 million in 2012 and 2013 to settle allegations of the child sexual abuse of military cadets,&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; and between 2012 and 2017 recorded a further 363 allegations, of which 282 were referred to the police.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

=== United States ===
{{Main|Military sexual trauma|Sexual assault in the United States military}}In 2017, the Department of Defense reported that an estimated 14,900 military personnel were sexually assaulted in 2016,&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; of whom 6,172 made an official complaint.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; According to an article published in ''[[Medscape]]'', up to 80% of women in the armed forces have been sexually harassed, and 25% have experienced a sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/781380_3|title=Mission Critical: Getting Vets With PTSD Back to Work|last=Meade|first=Barbara J|last2=Glenn|first2=Margaret K|date=2013-03-29|website=www.medscape.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315173801/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/781380_3|archive-date=2016-03-15|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4771">'''Social estates in the Russian Empire''' were denoted by the term '''soslovie''' ('''sosloviye'''), which approximately corresponds to the notion of the [[estate of the realm]]. The system of ''sosloviyes'' was a peculiar system of [[social group]]s in the history of the [[Russian Empire]]. In Russian language the terms "сословие" and "состояние" (in the meaning of the civil/legal estate) were used interchangeably.

The Code of the Law of the Russian Empire of 1832, vol. 9, "Laws about Estates" (Законы о состояниях) defined four major estates: [[dvoryans]] ([[nobility]]), [[clergy]], urban dwellers and rural dwellers ([[peasant]]s). Within these, more  detailed categories were recognized:

See "[[Russian nobility#Categories|Russian nobility: Categories]]" for dvoryans. 

Clergy was subdivided into "white" (priests) and "black" (monks). 

Urban dwellers (Городские обыватели) were categorized into потомственные почетные граждане (hereditary distinguished citizens), личные почетные граждане(personal distinguished citizens), merchantry ([[:ru:купечество]]), urban commoners ([[:ru:мещанство]]), and [[guild]]ed [[artisan|craftspeople]] (цеховые ремесленники). 

There also existed the military estate, which included lower military ranks (higher ranks were associated with the estate of dvoryans), and [[discharge (military)|discharge]]d and indefinite-[[leave (military)|leave]]. Dependent families were usually included into the estate of the head of the household.

Urban commoners included people who had some [[real estate]] in a town, were engaged in some trade, craft, or service, and paid taxes. Subject to these conditions, a person could assign himself into this category, which was hereditary, and one may be excluded from it in the court of law or by the urban commoner's self-government (мещанская управа). 

The category of rural dwellers (сельские обыватели) had permanent residence in towns, and they were correspondingly classified as "urban peasants" (городовые крестьяне). The rural dwellers category also included the ''[[inorodtsy]]'' (инородцы) estate, that included non-Russian and non-Orthodox native peoples of Siberia, Central Asia or Caucasus. An inorodets who converted into Orthodox Christianity was excluded from this estate and included into one of the other ones, most often peasantry.

A separate category, not assigned to any of the above estates were ''[[raznochintsy]]'' (literally "persons of miscellaneous ranks", but in fact having no rank at all).

A separate stratification existed for governmental bureaucracy, who were classified according to the [[Table of Ranks]]. The higher ranks belonged to the ''sosloviye'' of dvoryanstvo, while the indication of a lower rank of a person was comparable to that of the indication of a ''soslovie'' for various formal purposes (e.g., for the [[Russian Empire Census]]).
 
Finally, in Siberia, the estate of "exiled" was officially recognized, with the subcategory of "exiled nobility". 

The institution of distinguished citizenship (or two categories) was introduced by the manifesto of [[Nicholas I of Russia]] of April 10, 1832. The distinguished citizens ranked above merchantry and below nobility. They were freed of [[personal tax]]es, military service obligation (рекрутская повинность), [[corporal punishment]]s, etc. Distinguished citizenship was available for persons with a scientific or scholar degree, graduates of certain schools, people of arts and destinguished merchants and industrialists subject to certain conditions.

The estates were classified into two major groups: '''taxable estates''' (податные  сословия), i.e., which had to pay the personal tax, and non-taxable ones.

With the development of [[capitalism]] and the [[Emancipation reform of 1861|abolishment of the serfdom]] in Russia in the second half of the 19th century the estate paradigm no longer corresponded to the actual socio-economical stratification of the population, but the terminology was in use until the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]. At the same time the legal and governmental system gradually became estate-independent, with the property grade (имущественный ценз) of a person playing the decisive role.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16547">'''Socio-analysis''' is the activity of exploration, consultancy, and [[action research]] which combines and synthesises methodologies and theories derived from [[psychoanalysis]], group relations, social systems thinking, [[organisational behaviour]], and social dreaming.&lt;ref&gt;Bain A., “On Socio-Analysis” Socio-Analysis, Vol.1 No.1 June 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Socio-analysis offers a conception of individuals, groups, organisations, and global systems that takes into account conscious and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] aspects and potentialities. From this conception are born methods of exploration which can increase capacities through making conscious what was [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] for individuals, groups, and organisations, and through releasing energy and ideas that help create individual and organizational direction, and meaning.

Socio-analysis has at its heart a query as to what is the psychological truth for an individual, group, organisation, or other social system, and how may this best be brought to light as a means for creative transformation and growth?

==Socio-analysis and wonder==

[[Anxiety]], its exploration, and understanding are of central concern to [[psychoanalysis]], which was founded to explore the mental problems of medical patients. While socio-analytic exploration frequently uncovers systemic pain, (of which anxiety is a part), the “pain” is a guide to transformation of the system as a whole with all its potentialities for growth. Joshua Bain has suggested that the emphasis on anxiety is limiting, and that a more appropriate paradigm for socio-analysis is wonder.&lt;ref&gt;Bain J., “From Anxiety to Wonder: A New Paradigm for Socio-Analysis” in Centre for Socio-Analysis Newsletter No.1, February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Wonder was regarded by [[Plato]] as the beginning of [[philosophy]], and its link to exploration, creativity, and the growth of capacities of human beings, would seem to make it the appropriate starting point for socio-analysis  as well.&lt;ref name="Bain A. 2006"&gt;Bain A., “Sources of Authority: The Double Threads of Anxiety and Wonder” in Dare to Think the Unthought Known?, Ed.  Ajeet N. Mathur, Aivoainut Oy, Tampere, Finland. March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

“Wonder is the special affection of a philosopher; for philosophy has no other starting point than this; and it is a happy genealogy which makes Iris the daughter of [[Thaumas]]”. [[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]], 155D

The saying “When wonder ceases, knowledge begins”, which is attributed to
[[Sir Francis Bacon]], is especially apt for socio-analysis with its emphasis on always explore, rather than sit tight on what is supposedly known.

==Brief history==

Socio-analysis has its roots in the first Northfield Experiment carried out by [[Wilfred Bion]] and John Rickman, and reported in the [[The Lancet|Lancet]] in 1943,&lt;ref&gt;Bion, W.R., and Rickman, J., "Intra-group Tensions in Therapy", Lancet, 27 November 1943&lt;/ref&gt; and later by Bion in the Bulletin of the [[Menninger Clinic]] in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Bion, W.R., "The Leaderless Group Project", Bull. Meninger Clinic, 10, 3: 77 - 8l.1946&lt;/ref&gt; Bion is generally regarded as the father of socio-analysis (although the word was not used in those days).

===Wilfred Bion===

[[Wilfred Bion]] was born in [[India]] in 1897 and educated at Bishop Stortford College in [[England]]. During the [[First World War]] he commanded a tank on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and was decorated for bravery: [[Distinguished Service Order]], and the [[Legion of Honour]]. After studying [[History]] at [[Oxford University]], and a stint teaching History at his old school, he began Medical training at [[University College Hospital]] in 1924 and qualified in 1930. He worked at the [[Tavistock Clinic]] in London before the [[Second World War]], and started a personal psychoanalysis with John Rickman. After the Second World War he contributed to the formation of the [[Tavistock Institute]].  He had a second psycho-analysis with [[Melanie Klein]], and trained and qualified as a psychoanalyst. Bion was, and is, regarded by many people as a genius who made fundamental contributions to psychoanalysis, and to the understanding of groups. His stance of always pointing to the unknown, whether with a patient or with a group or in himself, was the realization of his genius.

===Northfield experiments===

[[Northfield Hospital]] was a military hospital, situated in [[Birmingham]], in the [[English Midlands]], with the task of treating soldiers who had developed psychiatric problems, in order to get them back into the war. Together with John Rickman, Wilfred Bion introduced group meetings as the principal method of change for these patients.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, T.  Bion, Rickman, Foulkes and the Northfield Experiments. London: Jessica Kingsley, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kraemer, S. "‘The dangers of this atmosphere’: a Quaker connection in the Tavistock Clinic’s  development" History of the Human Sciences 2011; '''24'''(2): 82–102&lt;/ref&gt; This Experiment, together with the Second Northfield Experiment associated with the innovations of [[S. H. Foulkes]], Tom Main and Harold Bridger, contributed the following elements to the emerging discipline of socio-analysis:
*Attention to, and making hypotheses, and interpretations, about conscious and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] functioning at the level of the group. A group was no longer regarded as simply an aggregate of individuals, but as having its own intrinsic dynamics that required understanding and interpretation.
*The concept of working therapeutically with the “institution as a whole", or the “whole community". The idea of the “[[therapeutic community]]” which burgeoned after the Second World War, e.g. at the [[Menninger Clinic]] in Kansas, and the Cassel Hospital in London has its origins in Main’s work at Northfield.&lt;ref&gt;Main, T."The Concept of the Therapeutic Community: Variations and Vicissitudes", Group Analysis, 10, Suppl.1977&lt;/ref&gt;
*The significance of creating "transitional space" for therapy, action projects, and development, so that people, (in this case patients), are enabled to take up their own authority for task. Bridger pioneered this approach at Northfield through his celebrated “Club”, a space for patients to make of it what they wished to, without the use of the space being determined by hospital or military staff. Bridger continued to develop this approach to working with groups and organisations of all kinds after the War.

===Socio-analytic role===

The Northfield Experiments heralded a socio-analytic consultant role: one of exploration of individual, group, and organisational phenomena which are linked dynamically. The socio-analyst, as exemplified by the role Bion took at Northfield, and after the War in his group explorations at the [[Tavistock Clinic]], works from a stance of “not knowing” with the courage, and fortitude, to pursue psychological truth.

The socio-analyst, like the psychoanalyst, uses concepts such as the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]], defences, [[splitting (psychology)|splitting]], [[psychological projection|projection]], [[projective identification]], [[introjection]], and [[transference]], but the field for exploration, while including the individual, is wider than the psychoanalytic dyad – e.g. a group, an organisation, a society, global systems.

Thus, for example, the socio-analyst uses concepts of group and organisational [[transference]], and pays particular attention to the way he/she is made to feel through client engagements, as a possible indication of [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] dynamics within the client system.

===Group relations theory and Tavistock conferences===

Bion’s exploration of [[group dynamics]] at the [[Tavistock Clinic]] in London after the war culminated in a seminal publication “Experiences in Groups”,&lt;ref&gt;Bion, W.R. Experiences in Groups and Other Papers, London, Tavistock, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; which describes and analyses three basic assumptions that can be observed in group behaviour at different times: basic assumption dependency, basic assumption fight / flight, and basic assumption pairing. Basic assumptions operate unconsciously within groups at the same time a group may be engaged in a conscious work task – that Bion called a W group.&lt;ref&gt;Two other basic assumptions have contributed to understanding group behaviour: basic assumption “Oneness” discovered by Pierre Turquet in 1974. Turquet P, “Leadership: The individual and the group” in Gibbard G. et al. eds. The Large Group: Therapy and Dynamics. San Francisco and London. Jossey Bass, 1974. And basic assumption Me discovered by Gordon Lawrence and Alastair Bain in 1992. Lawrence W., Bain A.,  &amp; Gould L., “The Fifth Basic Assumption.” Free Associations, London, Vol. 6, Part 1 (no. 37), 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

These insights of Bion together with theories of [[Kurt Lewin]] led to the first Group Relations Conference in 1957 that was sponsored by the [[Tavistock Institute]] of Human Relations and [[Leicester University]], and directed by [[Eric Trist]].&lt;ref&gt;Trist, E., and Sofer, C., Exploration in Group Relations, Leicester, Leicester University Press, 1959&lt;/ref&gt;
Group Relations Conferences typically explore the effects of group and organisational dynamics on how individuals take up authority and leadership in this temporary institution, and in their work. The “Leicester” Conference as it came to be known under the leadership of A.K.Rice and colleagues such as Pierre Turquet, Eric Miller,&lt;ref&gt;Eric Miller as director of the ''Group Relations Program'' in the [[Tavistock Institute]] since 1969 developed the design of the so called [[Nazareth-Conferences]]. See: {{cite book|last1=Erlich|first1=H. Shmuel|last2=Erlich-Ginor|first2=Mira|last3=Beland|first3=Hermann|year=2009|title=Fed with Tears – Poisoned with Milk.

Tutu|series=|language=|volume=|issue=|others=|edition=|location=Gießen|publisher=Psychozial|pages=35–47|isbn=978-3-89806-751-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Gosling, and Bruce Reed stimulated similar explorations and enterprises in numerous countries: United States, Canada, Mexico, Peru, France, Éire, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Bulgaria, Finland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, South Africa, Israel, India, and Australia.

===Other influences===

Other influences on the nascent discipline of socio-analysis that emerged from the work of social scientists at the [[Tavistock Institute]] in the 1950s were [[action research]];&lt;ref&gt;Jaques, E., The Changing Culture of a Factory, London, Tavistock, 1951&lt;/ref&gt; the discovery of [[socio-technical systems]]  by [[Eric Trist]] and Ken Bamforth,&lt;ref&gt;Trist, E., and Bamforth, W., "Some Social and Psychological Consequences of the Long Wall Method of Coal-Getting", Human Relations, 4.1951&lt;/ref&gt; its development by Trist and [[Fred Emery|Emery]],&lt;ref&gt;Emery F. and Trist E., "The Causal Texture of Organizational Environments", Human Relations, 18. 1965&lt;/ref&gt; Rice and Miller;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, E., and Rice, K., Systems of Organisation, London, Tavistock, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Elliott Jaques]]&lt;ref&gt;Jaques, E. "Social Systems as a Defence against Persecutory and Depressive Anxiety" in Klein, M. et. a1. (eds.), New Directions in Psycho-analysis, London, Tavistock, 1955&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Isabel Menzies Lyth|Isabel Menzies]]'s concept of social systems being structured as a defence against anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Menzies, 1. The Functioning of Social Systems as a Defence Against Anxiety, London, Tavistock Institute of Human Relations,1970&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent innovations==

===Social dreaming===

A recent methodology for the exploration of social phenomena has been the discovery of social dreaming by Gordon Lawrence at the [[Tavistock Institute]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence W. “Ventures in Social Dreaming: The First Experience” in Changes, Vol. 7, No.3, July 1989
Lawrence W. ed. Social Dreaming @ Work, London, Karnac, 1998.
Lawrence W. ed. Experiences in Social Dreaming, London, Karnac, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
Social Dreaming is the activity of sharing dreams (night dreams), associations to the dreams, and connections between dreams, with others in a Matrix setting. The focus of social dreaming (unlike in psychoanalysis or dreaming groups) is not on the meaning of the dream for the individual dreamer, but regarding the dreams and associations as a way of exploring and making social meaning. Conferences to explore social dreaming have been held in Israel, the United States, Australia, India, and most European countries.

Up until 1996 the work that has been described in this article went under different labels.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Psycho-analytic Social Systems Thinking, Working in the Bion I Tavistock Tradition, Psychodynamic approaches to consultancy, System Psychodynamics.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no one word that described the activities and the role. Alastair Bain suggested that the discipline should be called “Socio-Analysis” in 1996.

===Organisations===

The Australian Institute of Socio-Analysis pioneered a three-year professional training program in socio-analysis in 1999, and began publishing a Journal “Socio-Analysis” in 1999. While the Australian Institute of Socio-Analysis no longer exists the work of socio-analysis continues to be developed by the Centre for Socio-Analysis in Melbourne [http://www.acsa.net.au]. Other organisations which do socio-analytic or closely related work include the [[William Alanson White Institute]] in New York, the [[A.K. Rice Institute]] in the United States, the [[Tavistock Institute]] and [[Tavistock Clinic]] in London, the Grubb Institute [http://www.grubb.org.uk/] and OPUS [http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~opusuk/], both in London, the Centre for Applied Research in Philadelphia, the International Society for the Psychoanalytic Study of Organisations [http://www.ispso.org/], the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, the University of Wuppertal [http://www.wiwi.uni-wuppertal.de/Startseite.1566.0.html], and practitioners from many countries who work in the tradition of Wilfred Bion. The Journal “Socio-Analysis” is now published by Group Relations Australia.[http://www.grouprelations.org.au/]

===Organisational dreaming===

Current developments in socio-analysis include Bain’s discovery of Organisational Dreaming,&lt;ref&gt;Bain A.,“Organisational Dreaming”, in PACAWA Newsletter, February, 2006.
Bain A. “The Organisation Containing and Being Contained by Dreams: The Organisation as a Container for Dreams (1)” in Infinite Possibilities of Social Dreaming in Systems, ed. Lawrence W., Karnac, London,2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
which is based on the observation that dreams are “container sensitive”, and that the dreams shared by people within an organisation during a project will reflect organisational realities that are the “unexpressed known” within the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Organisational Dreaming is a part of the generic Social Dreaming&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authority, wonder and the sangha===

The work of the Centre for Socio-Analysis has also led to a formulation of “[[authority]]” that is based in [[wonder (emotion)|wonder]] and the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] (Buddhist notion of “people on the path”) in contrast to usual understandings that are based on the individual, [[anxiety]], and [[hierarchy]].&lt;ref name="Bain A. 2006"/&gt;

The Supreme Court reversed the case for further trial after finding that expert testimony regarding the defence's submission, that Kelly suffered from [[Battered woman defence|battered woman syndrome]], was incorrectly excluded since battered woman syndrome was a proper subject for expert evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.audiocasefiles.com/cases/detail/case/8764/ ''State v.

==Implications==
This is a notable case, both regarding the role of experts in new fields and in trials where the [[battered woman defense]] may be advanced, as is demonstrated by it being cited in other states,&lt;ref name=virginia&gt;[http://www.state.wv.us/wvsca/DVBenbook/OStateCases/OstateKelly.pdf Full text here] "STATE of New Jersey, Plaintiff-Respondent v.

'''Stevens's power law''' is an empirical relationship in [[psychophysics]] between an increased intensity or strength in a physical stimulus and the perceived [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] increase in the sensation created by the stimulus. It is often considered to supersede the [[Weber–Fechner law]], based on a logarithmic relationship between stimulus and sensation, because the power law describes a wider range of sensory comparisons.

The theory is named after psychophysicist [[Stanley Smith Stevens]] (1906–1973).  Although the idea of a [[power law]] had been suggested by 19th-century researchers, Stevens is credited with reviving the law and publishing a body of psychophysical data to support it in 1957.

The general form of the law is
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(I) = k I ^a,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''I'' is the intensity or strength of the stimulus in physical units (energy, weight, pressure, mixture proportions, etc.), ψ(''I'') is the magnitude of the sensation evoked by the stimulus, ''a'' is an exponent that depends on the type of stimulation or sensory modality, and ''k'' is a [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality]] constant that depends on the units used.

A distinction has been made between local [[psychophysics]], where stimuli can only be discriminated with a probability around 50%, and global psychophysics, where the stimuli can be discriminated correctly with near certainty ([[R. Duncan Luce|Luce]] &amp; Krumhansl, 1988). The Weber–Fechner law and methods described by [[L. L. Thurstone]] are generally applied in local psychophysics, whereas Stevens's methods are usually applied in global psychophysics.

The table to the right lists the exponents reported by Stevens.

==Methods==
The principal methods used by Stevens to measure the perceived intensity of a stimulus were ''magnitude estimation'' and ''magnitude production''. In magnitude estimation with a standard, the experimenter presents a stimulus called a ''standard'' and assigns it a number called the ''modulus''. For subsequent stimuli, subjects report numerically their perceived intensity relative to the standard so as to preserve the ratio between the sensations and the numerical estimates (e.g., a sound perceived twice as loud as the standard should be given a number twice the modulus). In magnitude estimation without a standard (usually just ''magnitude estimation''), subjects are free to choose their own standard, assigning any number to the first stimulus and all subsequent ones with the only requirement being that the ratio between sensations and numbers is preserved. In magnitude production a number and a reference stimulus is given and subjects produce a stimulus that is perceived as that number times the reference. Also used is ''cross-modality matching'', which generally involves subjects altering the magnitude of one physical quantity, such as the brightness of a light, so that its perceived intensity is equal to the perceived intensity of another type of quantity, such as warmth or pressure.

==Criticisms==
Stevens generally collected magnitude estimation data from multiple observers, averaged the data across subjects, and then fitted a power function to the data.  Because the fit was generally reasonable, he concluded the power law was correct.

A principal criticism has been that Stevens's approach provides neither a direct test of the power law itself nor the underlying assumptions of the magnitude estimation/production method: it simply fits curves to data points. In addition, the power law can be deduced mathematically from the Weber-Fechner logarithmic function ([[Mackay, 1963]]&lt;ref&gt;MacKay, D. M. Psychophysics of perceived intensity: A theoretical basis for Fechner's and Stevens' laws. Science, 1963, 139, 1213-1216.&lt;/ref&gt;), and the relation makes predictions consistent with data ([http://hdl.handle.net/10161/6003 Staddon], 1978&lt;ref&gt;Staddon, J. E. R.)].  Theory of behavioral power functions. Psychological Review, 85, 305-320. &lt;/ref&gt;). As with all psychometric studies, Stevens's approach ignores individual differences in the stimulus-sensation relationship, and there are generally large individual differences in this relationship that averaging the data will obscure {{Harv|Green|Luce|1974}}.

Stevens's main assertion was that using magnitude estimations/productions respondents were able to make judgements on a [[Scale (ratio)|ratio scale]] (i.e., if ''x'' and ''y'' are values on a given ratio scale, then there exists a constant ''k'' such that ''x'' = ''ky''). In the context of [[axiomatic system|axiomatic]] psychophysics, {{harv|Narens|1996}} formulated a testable property capturing the implicit underlying assumption this assertion entailed. Specifically, for two proportions ''p'' and ''q'', and three stimuli, ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', if ''y'' is judged ''p'' times ''x'', ''z'' is judged ''q'' times ''y'', then ''t'' = ''pq'' times ''x'' should be equal to ''z''. This amounts to assuming that respondents interpret numbers in a veridical way. This property was unambiguously rejected ({{harvnb|Ellermeier|Faulhammer|2000}}, {{harvnb|Zimmer|2005}}). Without assuming veridical interpretation of numbers, {{Harv|Narens|1996}} formulated another property that, if sustained, meant that respondents could make ratio scaled judgments, namely, if ''y'' is judged ''p'' times ''x'', ''z'' is judged ''q'' times ''y'', and if ''y''{{'}} is judged ''q'' times ''x'', ''z''{{'}} is judged ''p'' times ''y''{{'}}, then ''z'' should equal ''z''{{'}}. This property has been sustained in a variety of situations ({{Harvnb|Ellermeier|Faulhammer|2000}}, {{harvnb|Zimmer|2005}}).

Critics of the power law also point out that the validity of the law is contingent on the measurement of perceived stimulus intensity that is employed in the relevant experiments. {{harv|Luce|2002}}, under the condition that respondents' numerical distortion function and the psychophysical functions could be separated, formulated a behavioral condition equivalent to the psychophysical function being a power function. This condition was confirmed for just over half the respondents, and the power form was found to be a reasonable approximation for the rest {{Harv|Steingrimsson|Luce|2006}}.

It has also been questioned, particularly in terms of [[signal detection theory]], whether any given stimulus is actually associated with a particular and ''absolute'' perceived intensity; i.e. one that is independent of contextual factors and conditions. Consistent with this, Luce (1990, p.&amp;nbsp;73) observed that "by introducing contexts such as background noise in loudness judgements, the shape of the magnitude estimation functions certainly deviates sharply from a power function". Indeed, nearly all sensory judgments can be changed by the context in which a stimulus is perceived.

[[Image:Rigveda MS2097.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rigveda]] manuscript, [[Sanskrit]] in [[Devanagari]] script, India, early 19th century]]

'''{{IAST|Svādhyāya}}''' ([[Devanagari]]: {{lang|sa|स्वाध्याय}}) is a [[Sanskrit]] term which literally means "one's own reading" and "self-study".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html svAdhyAya], Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=self-study&amp;direction=ES&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 svAdhyAya] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a broader concept with several meanings. In various schools of [[Hinduism]], ''Svadhyaya'' is a [[Niyama]] (virtuous observance) connoting introspection and "study of self".&lt;ref&gt;Sharda Nandram (2010), Synchronizing Leadership Style with Integral Transformational Yoga Principles, In Spirituality and Business (Editors: Nandram and Borden), Springer Berlin Heidelberg, {{ISBN|978-3-642-02660-7}}, pages 183-203&lt;/ref&gt; The term also means the self-study and recitation of the [[Vedas]] and other sacred books.&lt;ref&gt;For compound derivation as {{lang|sa|स्व}} +  {{lang|sa|अध्यायः}} and meanings of ''{{IAST|svādhyāya}}'' as "1. self-recitation, muttering to one-self. -2. study of the Vedas, sacred study, perusal of sacred books. -3. the Veda itself. -4. a day on which sacred study is enjoined to be resumed after suspension." see: {{Harvnb|Apte|1965|p=1016}}, right column.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For definition of "स्वाध्याय, m. repeating to oneself, study ''of the Veda''; repetition ''of the Veda'' aloud" see: {{Harvnb|Macdonell|1996|p=373}}, left column.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For definition as "the regular habit of study of religious books", see: Chatterjee and Datta (1984), p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology, meaning and usage==
Svādhyāya is a compound Sanskrit word composed of svā (स्वा) + adhyāya (अध्याय). Adhyāya means "a lesson, lecture, chapter; reading".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html AdhyAya], Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; Svā means "own, one's own, self, the human soul".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html SvA], Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Svādhyāya literally means "one's own reading, lesson".

Svādhyāya is also a compound Sanskrit word composed of svā (स्वा) + dhyāya (ध्याय). Dhyāya means "meditating on".&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=dhyAyam&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes&amp;choice=yes dhyAyam], Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; The root of Adhyāya and Dhyāya is “Dhyai” (ध्यै) which means “meditate, contemplate, think of”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=dhyai&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 ध्यै] Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; The term Svādhyāya therefore, also connotes “contemplation, meditation, reflection of one self”, or simply “to study one’s own self”.&lt;ref name=rsovik&gt;Rolf Sovik (2014), Understanding Yourself: the path of Svadhyaya, Himalayan Institute Press, {{ISBN|978-0893892470}}, pages 191-197&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Svadhyaya'' has other meanings. In the ''[[Smritis]]'', it refers to the historical practice of self-reciting Vedas to ensure it is memorized and faithfully transmitted, without writing, by the word of mouth, to the next generation.&lt;ref name=arya6/&gt; In various schools of Hinduism, particularly ''[[Yoga]]'', ''Svadhyaya'' is also a ''[[niyama]]'', a virtuous behavior. As a virtue, it means "study of self", "self-reflection", "introspection, observation of self".&lt;ref&gt;C Woiwode (2013), Transcendence and Spirituality Human Needs and the Practices of the Indian Svadhyaya Movement, Journal of Developing Societies, 29(3): 233-257&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;KH Garland (2010), Yoga, Pradhana Dharma, and the Helping Professions: Recognizing the Risk of Codependency and the Necessity of Self-Care, International Journal of Yoga Therapy, 1(1): 90-97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Fishman (2002), Yoga in medicine. in Alternative medicine and rehabilitation (Wainapel S, Fast A, Editors), {{ISBN|978-1888799668}}, pages 139–73&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IAST|Svādhyāya}} is translated in a number of ways. Some translate it as the "study of the scriptures and ''[[Indian philosophy|darśanas]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bhattacharyya|1956|pp=25–26}}, volume 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Some translators simply use the word "study" without qualifying the type of study.&lt;ref&gt;For translation of YS 2.1 as ""Purificatory action, study, and making God the motive of action, constitute the ''yoga'' of action." see: Radhakrishnan and Moore, p. 462.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For translation of YS 2.1 as "Austerity, study, and the dedication of the fruits of one's work to God: these are the preliminary steps to yoga." see: [[Prabhavananda]] and [[Christopher Isherwood|Isherwood]], p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; MacNeill translates it as "self-study or spiritual self-education".&lt;ref&gt;Paul MacNeill (2011), Yoga and Ethics: The Importance of Practice, in Yoga-Philosophy for Everyone (Editors: Stillwagon et al.), Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|978-0470658802}}, Chapter 18&lt;/ref&gt; Dhyāya, when used in the context of self study in ancient and medieval Indian texts, is synonymous with ''Abhyasa'', ''Adhi'' and ''Viks''; while Adhyāya, when used in context of reciting and reading in Indian texts, is synonymous with ''Anukti'', ''Nipatha''&lt;ref&gt;often used to describe recitation of Vedas by a student; see BL Dwivedi (1994), Evolution of educational thought in India, {{ISBN|978-8172110598}}, page 119&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Patha''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html Study] Monier Williams Sanskrit Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany; see discussion notes and cited Indian texts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de Sanskrit English Dictionary] Koeln University, Germany; Search for each of: abhyAsam, adhI, vIkS, anUkti, nipaTha, paTh&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Taittiriya Upanishad]]’s hymn 1.9.1&lt;ref&gt;Original:&lt;br&gt;ऋतं च स्वाध्यायप्रवचने च । सत्यं च स्वाध्यायप्रवचने च । तपश्च स्वाध्यायप्रवचने च । दमश्च स्वाध्यायप्रवचने च । शमश्च स्वाध्यायप्रवचने च । अग्नयश्च स्वाध्यायप्रवचने च । अग्निहोत्रं च स्वाध्यायप्रवचने च । अतिथयश्च स्वाध्यायप्रवचने च । मानुषं च स्वाध्यायप्रवचने च । प्रजा च स्वाध्यायप्रवचने च । प्रजनश्च स्वाध्यायप्रवचने च । प्रजातिश्च स्वाध्यायप्रवचने च ॥ १ ॥&lt;br&gt;For two translations: TN Raghavendra (2002), Vishnu Saharanama, {{ISBN|8190282727}}, page 763, and {{Harvnb|Zaehner|1966|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizes the central importance of ''Svadhyaya'' in one’s pursuit of Reality ([[Ṛta]]), Truth ([[Satya]]), Self-restraint (Damah), Perseverance ([[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapas]]), Tranquility and Inner Peace (Samas),&lt;ref&gt;शम&lt;/ref&gt; Relationships with others, family, guests (Praja, Prajana, Manush, Atithi) and all Rituals (Agnaya, Agnihotram).&lt;ref name=tnr&gt;TN Raghavendra (2002), Vishnu Saharanama, {{ISBN|8190282727}}, page 763&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For translation, see: {{Harvnb|Zaehner|1966|p=136}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taittiriya Upanishad, however, adds in verse 1.9.1, that along with the virtue of ''{{IAST|svādhyāyā}}'' process of learning, one must teach and share (''[[pravacana]]'') what one learns.&lt;ref name=tnr/&gt; This is expressed by the phrase "''{{IAST|svādhyāyapravacane ca}}''", translated as "and learning and teaching" by Gambhīrānanda&lt;ref&gt;For Sanskrit text of ''Taittirīya Upanishad'' 1.9.1; translation of {{lang|sa|स्वाध्यायप्रवचने च}} (''svādhyāyapravacane ca'') as "and learning and teaching (are to be practiced)"; and comment that "''Svādhyāyaḥ'' is study (of the scriptures). ''Pravacanam'' is teaching (of the scriptures)", see: {{Harvnb|Gambhīrānanda|1986|pp=40–43}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In verse 1.11.1, the final chapter in the education of a student, the Taittiriya Upanishad reminds,&lt;ref&gt;For context as "the teacher gives the scholar who is departing on his life's journey", and translation of opening phrases of ''Taittirīya Upanishad'' 1.11, see: {{Harvnb|Winternitz|1972|p=259, vol. 1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest mention of Svādhyāya is found in [[Taittiriya Aranyaka]] 2.15: "{{IAST|svādhyayo-adhyetavyah}}" ("svādhyāya must be practiced"). Śatpath Brāhmana also repeats it.&lt;ref&gt;Monier-Williams&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[Chandogya Upanishad]] verse 4.16.1-2 recommends both silent (''mānas'') and vocal (''vāchika'') types of svādhyāya.

Kaelber (1979), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3269719 Tapas and Purification in Early Hinduism], Numen, Vol. 26, Fasc. 2 (Dec., 1979), pages 192-214&lt;/ref&gt; Baudhayana Dharmasastra describes ‘‘Svadhyaya’’, in verse 2.6.11, as the path to [[Brahman]] (Highest Reality, Universal Spirit, Eternal Self).&lt;ref name=walter/&gt;

{{IAST|Svādhyāya}} is mentioned as one of the virtues in ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' 16.1.&lt;ref&gt;For text of BG 16.1 and translation of ''{{IAST|svādhyāya}}'' as "study of the scriptures", see: Chidbhavananda, p. 779.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Svadhyaya'' is mentioned a second time in ''Bhagavad Gita'' verse 17.15 as a component of the discipline of one's speech by which, states the verse, " speak words that are truthful, kind, helpful, and elevates those who hear it".&lt;ref&gt;For text of BG 17.15 and translation of ''{{IAST|svādhyāyābhyasanaṁ}}'' as "the practice of the study of scriptures" see: {{Harvnb|Gambhīrānanda|1997|pp=644–645}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Key Chapple (2009), ''The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty-fifth–Anniversary Edition'', State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-1-4384-2841-3}}, page 648&lt;/ref&gt;

==Svadhyaya as a historical practice==
;Learning one's Vedic recension
As a tool for memorization, ''{{IAST|svādhyāya}}'' had a unique meaning for Vedic scholars as the principal tool for the [[Vedic recitation|oral preservation of the Vedas in their original form for millennia]]. When used as a formal part of scriptural study, ''{{IAST|svādhyāya}}'' involves repeated recitations of scripture for purposes of mastering the [[mantras]] with their accurate pronunciation.&lt;ref name=arya6&gt;For traditional uses of ''{{IAST|svādhyāya}}'' in the sense of repetition of scriptural mantras for purposes of memorization, see: {{Harvnb|Arya|1986|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vedas had not been committed to writing in ancient times. Almost all printed editions depend on the late manuscripts that are hardly older than 500 years, not on the still-extant and superior oral tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Quotation of "... almost all printed editions depend on the late manuscripts that are hardly older than 500 years, not on the still extant and superior oral tradition" is from: Witzel, M., "Vedas and {{IAST|Upaniṣads}}", in: {{Harvnb|Flood|2003|p=69}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monier Monier-Williams]] defines ''[[śruti]]'' as "sacred knowledge orally transmitted by the {{IAST|Brāhmans}} from generation to generations, the Veda".&lt;ref&gt;For definition of ''śruti'' as "sacred knowledge orally transmitted" see: {{Harvnb|Monier-Williams|1899|p=1101}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael E. J. Witzel|Michael Witzel]] explains this oral tradition as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Vedic texts were orally composed and transmitted, without the use of script, in an unbroken line of transmission from teacher to student that was formalized early on.  This ensured an impeccable textual transmission superior to the classical texts of other cultures; it is, in fact, something like a ''tape-recording''.... Not just the actual words, but even the long-lost musical (tonal) accent (as in old Greek or in Japanese) has been preserved up to the present.&lt;ref&gt;For the quotation comparing recital to a "tape-recording" see: Witzel, M., "Vedas and {{IAST|Upaniṣads}}", in: {{Harvnb|Flood|2003|pp=68–69}}.&lt;/ref&gt;"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The commentator [[Sayana|Sāyana]] discusses this term in the introduction of his commentary on the ''{{IAST|Ṛgveda}}'', in which he says that ''{{IAST|svādhyāya}}'' enables Vedic rituals ([[Yajna|yājnika karmakānda]]) to take place.&lt;ref&gt;For text of Sāyana commentary as ''{{IAST|karma-kārana-bhūta-svādhyāya}}'' see: {{Harvnb|Sontakke|1972|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Madhvacharya|Madhva]], the [[Dvaita|dualistic]] [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] philosopher, defined philosophy as the three-stage process of understanding (''{{IAST|śravaṇa}}''), reflection (''{{IAST|manana}}''), and application (''{{IAST|nididhyāsana}}''), expressing itself in two forms: study (''{{IAST|svādhyāya}}'') and teaching (''{{IAST|pravacana}}'').  Of these two, Madhva considered teaching to be the highest aspect of discipline leading to [[Moksha|{{IAST|mokṣa}}]].&lt;ref&gt;For Madhva's threefold definition of philosophy and the twofold division of expression, see: Raghavendrachar, H. N., "Madhva's Brahma-Mīmāṁsā", in: Bhattacharyya (1956), volume 3, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; Mādhavāchārya's views on svādhyāya are to be found in chapter 15 of Sarva-Darśana-Sangraha (cf. references).

The ''[[Taittiriya Upanishad|Taittirīya Upanishad]]'', which belongs to the ''[[Yajurveda|Yajur Veda]]'', is still popular among those who learn [[Vedic chant]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;For ''{{IAST|Taittirīya Upaniṣad}}'' as part of ''Yajur Veda'', and continued popularity with students of Vedic chant, see: {{Harvnb|Gambhīrānanda|1986|p=iv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Recitation of mantras ([[Japa]]) is an integral part of [[Bhakti Yoga]], and in this tradition of Hinduism, it is sometimes called ''Japa Yoga''.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Munyer (2012), ''How Yoga Won the West, in Yoga-Philosophy for Everyone: Bending Mind and Body'' (Editors: Liz Swan and Fritz Allhoff), Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|978-0-470-65880-2}}, pages 3-14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exceptions===
There are certain days on which ''{{IAST|svādhyāya}}'' were prohibited, these were called ''{{IAST|anadhyāya}}'', after which ''{{IAST|svādhyāya}}'' must be resumed on the following day ; therefore the day of resumption is also called {{IAST|svādhyāya}}.&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit English Dictionary of [[Monier-Williams]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Svadhyaya as a Niyama==
[[File:Siddhasana.svg|thumb|Yoga meditation – a means to the virtue of Svadhyaya.]]
Svādhyāya is one of the three key elements in the practice of yoga as defined in the ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]'', appearing in the opening verse of Book two on spiritual practice and elaborated upon in two other verses.&lt;ref&gt;For Sanskrit text of verses 2.1, 2.32, and 2.44 and discussion as a key practice, see: {{Harvnb|Taimni|1961|pp=127–128, 220, 250}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Patanjali]] mentions {{IAST|svādhyāya}} a second time as one of the five recommended observances (''[[niyama]]s''), along with purity, contentment, austerity, and self-surrender.&lt;ref&gt;For text and translation of YS 2.32, and translation of ''niyama'' as "observances", see: {{Harvnb|Taimni|1961|p=220}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The five ''niyamas'', together with the five abstentions (''[[yamas]]''),&lt;ref&gt;For the five ''yamas'' or "restraints" as: abstention from injury (''{{IAST|ahiṁsā}}'', [[nonviolence]]), truthfulness (''satya''), non-stealing (''asteya''), control of the carnal desires and passions (''brahmacarya''), and non-acceptance of unnecessary gifts (''aparigraha''), see: Chatterjee and Datta (1984), p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; have been described as "'the ten commandments' of the {{IAST|Sāṁkhya-Yoga}}."&lt;ref&gt;For quotation including ''{{IAST|svādhyāya}}'' in the comparison to the ten commandments, see: Hiriyanna, M., "The {{IAST|Sāṁkhya}}", in: {{Harvnb|Bhattacharyya|1956|p=49}}, volume 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of Svadhyaya as a Niyama is perfected in many forms.&lt;ref name=rsovik/&gt; One form of Svadhyaya is [[mantra]] meditation, where certain sound constructs pregnant with meaning are recited, anchoring the mind to one thought. This practice helps draw the mind away from outward-going tendencies, silencing the crowding of thoughts, and ultimately towards inward feeling of resonance.&lt;ref name=rsovik/&gt; It can alternately be any music, sermon, chant, inspirational book that absorbs the person to a state of absorption, trance, unifying oneness.&lt;ref name=gary&gt;Gary Kraftsow, [http://www.yogajournal.com/article/philosophy/polishing-the-mirror/ Polishing the mirror], Yoga Journal, February 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Svadhyaya is practiced as a self-reflection process, where one silently meditates, in [[Asana]], on one’s own behaviors, motivations and plans. Svadhyaya is, in a sense, for one’s spirit and mind a process equivalent to watching one’s body in a non-distorting mirror.&lt;ref&gt;G Kraftsow (2002), Yoga for Transformation: Ancient Teachings and Holistic Practices for Healing Body, Mind, and Heart, Penguin, {{ISBN|978-0140196290}}, pages 22-27&lt;/ref&gt; This self-study, in Yoga, is not merely contemplation of one’s own motives and behaviors, but also of one’s circumstances and the environment one is in, assessing where one is in one’s life, what is one’s life direction, if and how desirable changes may lead to a more fulfilling Self.&lt;ref name=gary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nina Markil, Hatha Yoga: Benefits and Principles for a More Meaningful Practice, ACSM'S Health &amp; Fitness Journal, September/October 2010, 14(5): pp 19-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Corrigan (2010), Your Quest for a Spiritual Life: Based on the Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, {{ISBN|978-1846942952}}, pages 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:V2 Lab.jpg|thumb|V2 Lab Building on Eendrachtsstraat in Rotterdam]]

'''V2_, Lab for the Unstable Media''', founded in 1981, is an interdisciplinary center for art and media technology in Rotterdam (the Netherlands). V2_ presents, produces, archives and publishes about art made with new technologies and encourages the debate on these issues. It offers a platform where artists, scientists, developers of software and hardware, researchers and theorists from various disciplines can share their findings. It is the main organizer of the [[Dutch Electronic Art Festival]], which grew out of the Manifestations for the Unstable Media that V2_ organized since 1987.

Over the years V2_ has collaborated with many artists and theorists, including for instance: [[Stelarc]], [[Orlan]], [[Symbiotica]], [[Dick Raaymakers]], [[Michel Waisvisz]], [[Francisco López (musician)|Francisco López]],  [[Brian Massumi]], [[Manuel de Landa]], [[Paul Virilio]], [[Rafael Lozano-Hemmer]], [[Knowbotic Research]], and [[Rem Koolhaas]].
