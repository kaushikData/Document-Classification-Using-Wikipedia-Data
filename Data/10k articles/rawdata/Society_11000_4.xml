'''Anarchism and violence''' have become closely connected in popular thought, in part because of a concept of "[[propaganda of the deed]]". Propaganda of the deed, or ''attentát'', was espoused by leading anarchists in the late nineteenth century, and was associated with a number of incidents of violence. [[Anarchist thought]], however, is quite diverse on the question of violence. In the name of coherence [[Antimilitarism|some anarchists]] have opposed [[coercion]], while others have supported it, particularly in the form of violent revolution on the path to anarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, R.B. The Western Political Quarterly, Vol. 25, No. 4. (Dec. 1972), pp. 743-744&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchism includes a school of thought which rejects all violence ([[anarcho-pacifism]]).

Many anarchists regard the state to be at the definitional center of [[structural violence]]: directly or indirectly preventing people from meeting their basic needs, calling for violence as self-defense.&lt;ref&gt;[[Right of self-defense]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the first anarchist periodical was named ''[[The Peaceful Revolutionist]]'', a strain of anarchism that followed [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy's]] pacifism.

== Propaganda of the deed ==

{{main|Propaganda of the deed}}

Late in the 19th century, [[anarchism|anarchist]] [[labor union]]s began to use the tactic of [[general strike]]. This often resulted in  [[violence]] by both sides and some of the [[strike action|strikes]] even resulted in the deaths of striking workers, their replacements and security staff.

In this climate, some anarchists began to advocate and practice of [[terrorism]] or [[assassination]], which they referred to as [[propaganda of the deed]]. In many cases, newspapers blamed anarchist terrorism on immigrant naïvete, but scholar Richard Bach Jensen explained that "the emigrant experience may have heightened a pre-existing radicalism or given more precise configuration to its violent expression."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Anarcho-pacifism (also pacifist anarchism or anarchist pacifism) is a form of anarchism which completely rejects the use of violence in any form for any purpose. Important proponents include [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Bart de Ligt]]. [[Mohandas Gandhi]] is an important influence.

[[Henry David Thoreau]], though not a pacifist himself,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thoreau |first1=Henry |editor1-last=Rosenblum |editor1-first=Nancy |title=Thoreau: Political Writings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QpT7MEwYy5QC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=thoreau%20political%20writings&amp;pg=PR24&amp;q=%22advocate%20of%20nonviolence%22 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521476755 |page=xxiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; influenced both Leo Tolstoy and Mohandas Gandhi's advocacy of [[Nonviolent resistance]] through his work ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]''.&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.ppu.org.uk/e_publications/dd-trad8.html#anarch%20and%20violence "Resiting the Nation State, the pacifist and anarchist tradition" by Geoffrey Ostergaard]&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point anarcho-pacifism had as its main proponent [[Christian anarchism]]. The first large-scale anarcho-pacifist movement was the [[Tolstoyan]] peasant movement in [[Russia]]. They were a predominantly peasant movement that set up hundreds of voluntary anarchist pacifist communes  based on their interpretation of Christianity as requiring absolute pacifism and the rejection of all coercive authority.

"Dutch anarchist-pacifist Bart de Ligt’s 1936 treatise ''The Conquest of Violence'' (with its none too subtle allusion to Kropotkin’s ''The Conquest of Bread'') was also of signal importance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://anarchiststudies.org/node/292 "Anarchism and the Movement for a New Society: Direct Action and Prefigurative Community in the 1970s and 80s" by Andrew Cornell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518071734/http://www.anarchiststudies.org/node/292 |date=2013-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Gandhi's ideas were popularized in the West in books such as [[Richard Gregg (social philosopher)|Richard Gregg]]'s ''The Power of Nonviolence'' (1935), and Bart de Ligt's ''The Conquest of Violence'' (1937).
[[Peter Gelderloos]] criticizes the idea that nonviolence is the only way to fight for a better world. According to Gelderloos, pacifism as an ideology serves the interests of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gelderloos|first=Peter|title=How Nonviolence Protects the State|year=2007|publisher=South End Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=9780896087729|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anarchist theory ==
{{see also|anarchist schools of thought}}
Anarchism encompasses a variety of views about violence. The [[Tolstoyanism|Tolstoyan]] tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among some anarchists. [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s novel ''[[The Dispossessed]]'', a fictional novel about a society that practices "Odonianism", expressed this anarchism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Odonianism is anarchism. Not the bomb-in-the-pocket stuff, which is terrorism, whatever name it tries to dignify itself with, not the social-Darwinist economic '[[libertarianism]]' of the far right; but anarchism, as prefigured in early [[Taoism|Taoist]] thought, and expounded by Shelley and Kropotkin, Goldman and Goodman. Anarchism's principal target is the authoritarian State (capitalist or socialist); its principle moral-practical theme is cooperation (solidarity, [[Mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]]). It is the most idealistic, and to me the most interesting, of all political theories.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ursula K. Le Guin]]|Preface of '[[The Day Before the Revolution]]' ('In Memorial to [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]] 1911-1972'), published in the anthology '[[The Wind's Twelve Quarters]] Vol2'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Emma Goldman included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination in her early career, but changed her views after she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocated violence only as a means of self-defense.

===Arguments in favor of violent and non-violent means===
Some anarchists see violent revolution as necessary in the abolition of capitalist society, while others advocate non-violent methods.  
[[Errico Malatesta]], an [[anarchist-communist|anarcho-communist]], propounded that it is "necessary to destroy with violence, since one cannot do otherwise, the violence which denies [the means of life and for development] to the workers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/anarchists/malatesta/rev_haste.html |title=The revolutionary haste by Errico Malatesta&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt; |access-date=2003-01-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030210201006/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/anarchists/malatesta/rev_haste.html |archive-date=2003-02-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As he put it in ''[[Umanità Nova]]'' (no. 125, September 6, 1921):

{{quote|It is our aspiration and our aim that everyone should become socially conscious and effective; but to achieve this end, it is necessary to provide all with the means of life and for development, and it is therefore necessary to destroy with violence, since one cannot do otherwise, the violence that denies these means to the workers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Umanità Nova]], n. 125, September 6, 1921. A translation can be found at [http://www.marxists.org/archive/malatesta/1921/09/haste.htm The revolutionary haste by Errico Malatesta]. Retrieved June 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Anarchists with this view advocate violence insofar as they see it to be necessary in ridding the world of exploitation, and especially states.

[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] argued in favor of a [[non-violent revolution]] through a process of [[dual power]] in which libertarian socialist institutions would be established and form associations enabling the formation of an expanding network within the existing state-capitalist framework with the intention of eventually rendering both the state and the capitalist economy obsolete. The progression towards violence in anarchism stemmed, in part, from the massacres of some of the communes inspired by the ideas of Proudhon and others. Many anarcho-communists began to see a need for revolutionary violence to counteract the violence inherent in both capitalism and government.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Emma. 'Anarchism and Other Essays' Mother Earth (1910) p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anarcho-pacifism]] is a tendency within the anarchist movement which rejects the use of violence in the struggle for social change.&lt;ref name="Anarchism 1962"&gt;Woodcock&lt;/ref&gt; The main early influences were the thought of [[Henry David Thoreau]]&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"/&gt; and [[Leo Tolstoy]].&lt;ref name="Anarchism 1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"/&gt; It developed "mostly in {{Sic|[[Netherlands|Holland]]}}, Britain, and the United States, before and during the Second World War".&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock, p. 21: "Finally, somewhat aside from the curve that runs from [[anarchist individualism]] to [[anarcho-syndicalism]], we come to [[Tolstoyanism]] and to pacifist anarchism that appeared, mostly in [[Netherlands|Holland]] ''(sic)'', Britain, and the United states, before and after the Second World War and which has continued since then in the deep in the anarchist involvement in the protests against nuclear armament."&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition to the use of violence has not prohibited anarcho-pacifists from accepting the principle of resistance or even [[Nonviolent revolution|revolutionary action]] provided it does not result in violence; it was in fact their approval of such forms of opposition to power that lead many anarcho-pacifists to endorse the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] concept of the general strike as the great revolutionary weapon. Later anarcho-pacifists have also come to endorse the non-violent strategy of dual power.

Other anarchists have believed that violence (especially [[self-defense]]) is justified as a way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution.

==Education==
Braga received his B.A. from the [[University of Massachusetts]] in 1991, his M.A. and Ph.D. from Rutgers in 1993 and 1997, respectively. He later received his [[Master of Public Administration|M.P.A.]] from [[Harvard University]] in 2002.&lt;ref name=cv&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rscj.newark.rutgers.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Braga-CV-July-2015.pdf | title=Anthony Braga CV | accessdate=7 March 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308122035/http://rscj.newark.rutgers.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Braga-CV-July-2015.pdf# | archive-date=2016-03-08 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Braga worked as a research associate at Rutgers University's Center for Crime Prevention Studies from 1993 to 1995. He then began working at Harvard's [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] as a research associate, where he has been a senior research fellow since July 2010. Also in July 2010, he joined Rutgers again as a professor of criminal justice, and became the [[Don Gottfredson|Don M. Gottfredson]] Professor of Evidence-Based Criminology there in September 2012.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; On July 1, 2016, he left Rutgers and Harvard to become the director of the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Northeastern University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.northeastern.edu/cssh/sccj/spotlight/dr-anthony-braga/ |title=Dr. Anthony Braga |website=Spotlight |publisher=Northeastern University School of Criminology &amp; Criminal Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Braga's research focuses on multiple topics in the field of criminology, including reducing criminals' access to guns, reducing gang-relatead violence, and crime control hot spots.&lt;ref name="rscj"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://rscj.newark.rutgers.edu/faculty/member/braga-anthony/ |title=Dr. Anthony A.

He has recommended that, to conduct this study, the [[New York Police Department]] put such cameras on some of its officers in 20 precincts and compare these officers to their counterparts in precincts where officers are not wearing cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/nypd-wrapping-up-body-camera-pilot-program-1456916402 | title=NYPD Prepares to Expand Body Camera Use | work=Wall Street Journal | date=2 March 2016 | accessdate=7 March 2016 | author=Shallwani, Pervais}}&lt;/ref&gt; His research has also found that hot-spot policing is effective at reducing the crime rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/nyregion/police-have-done-more-than-prisons-to-cut-crime-in-new-york.html | title=Prison Population Can Shrink When Police Crowd Streets | work=New York Times | date=26 January 2013 | accessdate=7 March 2016 | author=Tierney, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, while a research associate at Harvard, he and his colleagues designed and implemented the anti-[[gang violence]] program [[Operation Ceasefire]] in [[Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.northeastern.edu/2016/09/new-professor-has-made-crime-prevention-his-lifes-work/ |title=New professor has made crime prevention his life's work |last=Kornwitz |first=Jason |website=Northeastern University |publication-date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since published research showing that this program was associated with reductions in violence, but that this relationship may not be causal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/03/06/chicagos-murder-rate-is-finally-falling-can-that-keep-up/ | title=Chicago’s murder rate is finally falling.

The '''Arara''' are an [[indigenous people of Brazil]] native to the state of [[Rondônia]]. They are closely related to the [[Zoró]] and [[Gavião (Rondônia)|Gavião]] peoples, and are distinct from other groups known as "[[Arara (disambiguation)|Arara]]" to outsiders, including the [[Arara (Pará)|Arara]] of [[Pará]] and the [[Kwaza people|Kwaza]]. Their language is part of the [[Monde languages|Monde]] branch of the [[Tupian languages]].&lt;ref name=Olson&gt;{{cite book |last= Olson |first= James Stuart |year= 1991 |title= The Indians of Central and South America: An Ethnohistorical Dictionary|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=175c4xOpLtYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|location= |publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group|page= 26|isbn= 0313263876 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arara were an [[uncontacted tribe]] until the 1950s. At the time, they were at war with the neighboring Gavião. Through the Gavião, the Brazilian government contacted the Arara and enforced a peace. Their numbers declined rapidly after contact; only 50 were alive in 1966. The [[New Tribes Mission]] introduced medical care, and the population rose to over 200 by the 1990s. The Mission formally converted most Arara to the [[Baptists|Baptist]] faith, though the community largely retained their traditional beliefs.&lt;ref name=Olson/&gt;

There is a small '''Chilean diaspora in Mexico'''. According to the 2010 census, there were 5,267 registered [[Chilean people|Chilean citizens]] living in Mexico,&lt;ref name="inegi.gob.mx"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/inegi/contenidos/espanol/prensa/contenidos/Articulos/sociodemograficas/nacidosenotropais.pdf |title=Conociendonos todos |publisher=INEGI |accessdate=October 30, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427100913/http://www.inegi.gob.mx/inegi/contenidos/espanol/prensa/contenidos/Articulos/sociodemograficas/nacidosenotropais.pdf |archivedate=April 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an increase from the 3,848 registered in the 2000 census.&lt;ref name="inegi.gob.mx"/&gt; Chilean immigrants constitute the fifth largest community of South Americans in Mexico (after [[Colombian immigration to Mexico|Colombian Mexican]]s, [[Argentine immigration to Mexico|Argentine Mexican]]s, [[Venezuelan immigration to Mexico|Venezuelan Mexican]]s and [[Peruvian immigration to Mexico|Peruvian Mexican]]s) and the fifteenth largest immigrant community overall.&lt;ref name="inegi.gob.mx"/&gt;

==History==
The first South Americans who came to an independent Mexico came from [[Chile]] and [[Peru]], who passed through the ports of [[Acapulco]] and [[Puerto Ángel]] for supplies during the height of the gold rush in California in the mid-nineteenth century. Some Chilean and Peruvian migrants stayed and threw culturares roots among the coastal populations of the Mexican south Pacific.

In the summer of 1849, hundreds of Chileans were deceived by American filibusters to have alliances to invade the port of [[Guaymas]], in an attempt to found the [[Republic of Sonora]]. The Chileans were taken to the camps, but the Mexican army attacked Chilean vessels and killed many immigrants accused of supporting separatists.

===Political asylum===
After the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|coup]] that overthrew [[Salvador Allende]] in 1973, many Chileans fled the political persecution of the dictatorship of [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]], seeking [[political asylum]] in Mexico, accompanied by [[Uruguay]]ans, [[Argentina|Argentines]] and [[Peru]]vians fleeing persecution carried out by their respective governments. The higher educational level of Mexico provided a platform to protect their stay in the country. 

Many Chileans who sought political asylum, have settled permanently in the country. They have found the same life expectancy at best to proceed with businesses and jobs that have allowed them to maintain a standard of living much better than other Hispanic American immigrants. Both countries share the [[Spanish language]]; their historical origins are common (part of the [[Spanish Empire]]). The warmth of the people of the country has allowed them to live peacefully and in total harmony, some marrying and having families of success. There are others who are simply charmed with everything about Mexico and decided to settle in definitively. Without a doubt this is a unique example of coexistence between migrants and local.

==Chilean culture in Mexico==
[[File:Club de Danza Álvaro Carrillo, interepretes de la Chilena Cacahuatepec.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Las chilenas,'' a musical expression of the [[Costa Region|Costa Chica]] which has its origins in the Chilean foklore called cueca.]]
Undoubtedly, one of the cultural contributions of Chile on Mexican soil is the Chilean folk, artistic and innovative tradition of the South American sailor expressed and taught in many Guerrero and Oaxaca spaces strongly influenced by this community who arrived during and after independence from Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EkDinuTpfs ''Chile en México – La Chilena Mexicana – La Chilena de Oaxaca'']&lt;/ref&gt;  

Both countries celebrate their respective anniversaries of independence during the same month, being an important link between the two nations.

Although both countries have different mining industries, they have developed to a level that allows it to be profitable and competitive in foreign markets. 

==The new wave of immigration==
Today, the Chilean community in Mexico is one of the largest communities of foreigners in Mexico. The presence of Chileans stands mainly in large urban centers as [[sport]]smen, [[academy|academics]], researchers, students, [[businessperson|entrepreneurs]] and artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/internacional/62248.html Chilenos llevan a México en su corazón.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

It may be mentioned also that in the technology and transport field, both countries share in their capital a metro system in common which was installed by a French consortium as the [[Santiago Metro]] and [[Mexico City Metro]] have a system trains with rubber tires, both of [[Alstom]] technology. In the 80s, when an attack took place in Santiago, the FPMR Concarril I built for Chile a NS88 train of five cars to replace the wrecked train. Both state-owned transport companies share knowledge and strategies to optimize their respective systems. Even [[Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles|CAF]], who was winner of a bid in Santiago, designed the NS2007 Train with similarities to the NM02 Mexicano.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11399">[[Image:Chinesische.Zahl.Eins.jpg|thumb|right|a common sign for the number one]]
'''Chinese number gestures''' are a method to signify the [[natural number]]s one through ten using one hand.  This method may have been developed to bridge the many [[varieties of Chinese]]&amp;mdash;for example, the numbers 4 ({{zh|c=四|p=sì}}) and 10 ({{zh|c=十|p=shí}}) are hard to distinguish in some dialects. Some suggest that it was also used by business people during bargaining (i.e., to convey a bid by feeling the hand gesture in a sleeve) when they wish for more privacy in a public place. These gestures are fully integrated into [[Chinese Sign Language]].

==Methods==
While the five digits on one hand can easily express the numbers one through five, six through ten have special signs that can be used in commerce or day-to-day communication. The gestures are rough representations of the [[Chinese numerals|Chinese numeral characters]] they represent. The system varies in practice, especially for the representation of "7" to "10". Two of the systems are listed below:

* '''Six''' ([[wikt:六|六]])
**The little finger and thumb are extended, other fingers closed, sometimes with the palm facing the signer. (The extended thumb indicates one set of 5)
* '''Seven''' ([[wikt:七|七]])
**'''In North China''': The fingertips are all touching, pointed upwards; or just the fingertips of the thumb and first two fingers [note: this is the most common method]; another method is similar to the eight described immediately below, except that the little finger is also extended. 
**'''In North China''': The index finger and middle finger point outward, with the thumb extended upwards, sometimes with the palm facing the observer. (The extended thumb indicates one set of 5)
**'''In coastal South China''': The index finger points down with the thumb extended, mimicking the shape of a "7".
* '''Eight''' ([[wikt:八|八]])
**'''In North China''': The thumb and index finger make an "L", other fingers closed, with the palm facing the observer.
**'''In North China''': The index finger and middle finger point down, often with tips on a horizontal surface, making the Chinese number 8 ("八").
**'''In coastal South China''': The thumb, index finger, and middle finger are extended.
* '''Nine''' ([[wikt:九|九]])
**'''In Mainland China''': The index finger makes a hook, other fingers closed, sometimes with the palm facing the signer.
**'''In Taiwan''': The thumb, index finger, middle finger, and ring finger are extended.
**'''In Hong Kong''': Both methods are used.
* '''Ten''' ([[wikt:十|十]])
**The fist is closed with the palm facing the signer; or the middle finger crosses an extended index finger, facing the observer. Some Chinese distinguish between zero and ten by having the thumb closed or open respectively.
**The arms are raised and the index fingers of both hands are crossed in a "十" (making the Chinese number ten) with the palms facing in opposite directions, often in front of the face of the signer.

Use of the signs corresponds to the use of numbers in the [[Chinese language]]. For instance, the sign for five just as easily means fifty. A two followed by a six, using a single hand only, could mean 260 or 2600 etc. besides twenty-six. These signs also commonly refer to days of the week, starting from Monday, as well as months of the year, whose names in Chinese are enumerations.

In different regions signs for numbers vary significantly. One may interpret the "8" sign as a "7". The "index finger-hook" symbol for 9, also means "death" in other contexts.

The numbers zero through five are simpler:

* '''Zero''' ([[wikt:〇|〇]])
**'''In North China''': The fist is closed. It may be interpreted as 10 depending on the situation, though some Chinese distinguish between zero and ten by having the thumb closed or open respectively.
**'''In coastal South China''': The thumb and the index finger make a circle, with the last three fingers closed.
* '''One''' ([[wikt:一|一]])
**The index finger is extended.
* '''Two''' ([[wikt:二|二]])
**The index and middle fingers are extended.
* '''Three''' ([[wikt:三|三]])
**With the index finger and thumb closed, the last three fingers are extended.
**The thumb holds the little finger in palm with the middle three fingers extended.
* '''Four''' ([[wikt:四|四]])
**The thumb is held in palm with the four fingers extended.
* '''Five''' ([[wikt:五|五]])
** All five digits are extended.
** Only thumb is extended, upwards or outwards, with the palm facing the signer.

Counting with fingers is often different from expressing a specific number with a finger gesture. When counting, the palm can be either facing its owner or the audience, depending on the purpose. Before counting, all fingers are closed; counting starts by extending the thumb as ''the first'', then the index finger as ''the second'', till all fingers are extended as ''the fifth''; then counting can be continued by folding fingers with the same sequence, from thumb through the little finger, for counting from ''the sixth'' through ''the tenth''. Repeating the same method for counting larger numbers. One can also starts counting with all fingers extended. Some believe that for formal scenario such as giving speech or presentation, counting with the palm facing the audience and starting with all fingers extended is more polite, since the gesture of folding of fingers representing bowing.

When playing ''drinking finger games'' (划拳, [[wikt:猜拳|猜拳]]), slightly different sets of finger gestures of numbers is used. One of them is:

* '''Zero''' ([[wikt:〇|〇]])
**The fist is closed. 
* '''One''' ([[wikt:一|一]])
**The thumb is extended with all other fingers folded toward the palm.
* '''Two''' ([[wikt:二|二]])
**The thumb and index finger make an "L", other fingers closed.
* '''Three''' ([[wikt:三|三]])
**With the last two fingers closed and the rest fingers (the thumb and the first two fingers) extended, or
**With the index finger and thumb closed, the last three fingers are extended.
* '''Four''' ([[wikt:四|四]])
**The thumb is held in palm with the four fingers extended.
* '''Five''' ([[wikt:五|五]])
** All five digits are extended.

The '''Clinton–Lewinsky scandal''' was an American [[political scandal|political]] [[sex scandal]] that involved 49-year-old [[President of the United States of America|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] and 22-year-old [[White House]] intern [[Monica Lewinsky]]. The [[sexual relationship]] took place between 1995 and 1997 and came to light in 1998. Clinton ended a televised speech in late January 1998 with the statement that he "did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky".  Further investigation led to charges of [[perjury]] and to the [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeachment of President Clinton]] in 1998 by the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]. He was subsequently acquitted on all impeachment charges of perjury and [[obstruction of justice]] in a 21-day [[United States Senate|Senate]] trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Posner|first=Richard A,|title=An Affair of State The Investigation, Impeachment, and Trial of President Clinton|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/p/posner-affair.html|accessdate=March 1, 2012|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-00080-3|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton was held in civil [[contempt of court]] by Judge [[Susan Webber Wright]] for giving misleading testimony in the [[Paula Jones|Paula Jones case]] regarding Lewinsky&lt;ref name=ppppava&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/13/us/clinton-is-found-to-be-in-contempt-on-jones-lawsuit.html|title=Clinton is found to be in contempt on Jones lawsuit |last2= Lewis| first1= John M. |last1= Broder |first2=Neil A.|date=April 13, 1999|work=The New York Times|page=1|accessdate=March 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also fined $90,000 by Wright.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jul/30/news/mn-61021 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Robert L. | last=Jackson | title=Clinton Fined $90,686 for Lying in Paula Jones Case | date=July 30, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; His license to practice law was suspended in Arkansas for five years; shortly thereafter, he was disbarred from presenting cases in front of the [[United States Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/01/national/01WIRE-CLIN.html |title= Clinton Disbarred From Practice Before Supreme Court |work= The New York Times |first= Anne |last= Gearan |agency= Associated Press |date= October 1, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewinsky was a graduate of [[Lewis &amp; Clark College]]. She was hired during Clinton's first term in 1995 as an [[White House Internship Program|intern]] at the White House and was later an employee of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs. Some believe that Clinton began a personal relationship with her while she worked at the White House, the details of which she later confided to [[Linda Tripp]], her Defense Department co-worker who secretly recorded their telephone conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tripp: I Am Not Intimidated |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/07/07/archive/main13349.shtml |date=July 7, 1998 |accessdate=January 26, 2010 |publisher=CBS |quote=In January, Tripp gave Starr the tapes. She made the recordings secretly at her home at the urging of her friend [[Lucianne Goldberg]], a New York literary agent.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1998, Tripp discovered that Lewinsky had sworn an [[affidavit]] in the Paula Jones case, denying a relationship with Clinton. She delivered tapes to [[Kenneth Starr]], the [[United States Office of the Independent Counsel|Independent Counsel]] who was investigating Clinton on other matters, including the [[Whitewater scandal]], the [[White House FBI files controversy]], and the [[White House travel office controversy]]. During the grand jury testimony, Clinton's responses were carefully worded, and he argued, "It depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Timothy |last= Noah |url=http://www.slate.com/id/1000162/ |title= Bill Clinton and the Meaning of "Is" |work=[[Slate magazine|Slate]] |date=September 13, 1998 |accessdate=July 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with regard to the truthfulness of his statement that "there is not a sexual relationship, an improper sexual relationship or any other kind of improper relationship."&lt;ref name="ls-nh"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/white_house/jan-june98/clinton_1-21.html President Bill Clinton], ''[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]'', January 21, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The improper relationship between Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky was confirmed, but Clinton's marriage with [[Hillary Clinton]] survived the infidelity.

==Allegations of sexual contact==

Lewinsky stated that she had sexual encounters with Bill Clinton on nine occasions from November 1995 to March 1997. According to her published schedule, [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Hillary Clinton]] was at the White House for at least some portion of seven of those days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2008-03-19-852575883_x.htm| title= Lewinsky and the first lady| date= March 19, 2008 |agency= Associated Press |work= [[USA Today]] |accessdate= January 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1996, Lewinsky's superiors relocated her job to the [[Pentagon (building)|Pentagon]], because they felt that she was spending too much time around Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Leen (January 24, 1998). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/lewprofile.htm "Lewinsky: Two Coasts, Two Lives, Many Images"], ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his autobiography, then-[[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|United Nations Ambassador]] [[Bill Richardson]] was asked by the White House in 1997 to interview Lewinsky for a job on his staff at the UN. Richardson did so, and offered her a position, which she declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.aim.org/media-monitor/bill-richardson-caught-in-clinton-undertow/|title=Bill Richardson Caught In Clinton Undertow| last1= Irvine| first1= Reed| first2= Cliff |last2= Kincaid|date=August 21, 1998|publisher=Accuracy in Media|accessdate=March 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The American Spectator]]'' alleged that Richardson knew more about the Lewinsky affair than he declared to the [[grand jury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://spectator.org/archives/1998/11/15/slick-billy/|title=The American Spectator : Slick Billy|last=York|first=Byron|date=November 15, 1998|work=[[American Spectator]]|accessdate=March 5, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423232401/http://spectator.org/archives/1998/11/15/slick-billy|archivedate=April 23, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewinsky confided in  [[Linda Tripp]] about her relationship with Clinton. Tripp persuaded Lewinsky to save the gifts that Clinton had given her, and not to dry clean a [[semen]]-stained blue dress. Tripp reported their conversations to literary agent [[Lucianne Goldberg]], who advised her to secretly record them,&lt;ref&gt;''US News and World Report'', "The Monica Lewinsky Tapes", February 2, 1998, v.124 n.4 p.23.&lt;/ref&gt; which Tripp began doing in September 1997. Goldberg also urged Tripp to take the tapes to [[Independent Counsel]] [[Kenneth Starr]] and bring them to the attention of people working on the [[Paula Jones]] [[Clinton v. Jones|case]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/93748 |work=Newsweek |title=The Goldberg-Tripp-Jones Axis |date=November 9, 1998 |first1=Evan |last1=Thomas |first2=Michael |last2=Isikoff |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625224317/http://www.newsweek.com/id/93748 |archivedate=June 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 1997, Goldberg began speaking to reporters (including [[Michael Isikoff]] of ''[[Newsweek]]'') about the tapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|title=Lucianne Goldberg: in pursuit of Clinton|date=February 2, 1998|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,987748,00.html|first1= John |last1= Cloud |first2= Edward |last2= Barnes |first3= Richard |last3= Zoglin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Paula Jones case, Lewinsky had submitted an [[affidavit]] that denied any physical relationship with Clinton. In January 1998, she attempted to persuade Tripp to commit perjury in the Jones case. Instead, Tripp gave the tapes to Starr, who was investigating the [[Whitewater controversy]] and other matters. Starr was now armed with evidence of Lewinsky's admission of a physical relationship with Clinton, and he broadened the investigation to include Lewinsky and her possible [[perjury]] in the Jones case.

News of the scandal first broke on January 17, 1998, on the ''[[Drudge Report]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drudgereportarchives.com/data/2002/01/17/20020117_175502_ml.htm "Newsweek Kills Story On White House Intern"], DrudgeReportArchives, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; which reported that ''[[Newsweek]]'' editors were sitting on a story by investigative reporter [[Michael Isikoff]] exposing the affair. The story broke in the mainstream press on January 21 in ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref name="WP-21jan1998"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/clinton012198.htm|title=Special Report: Clinton Accused| last= Schmidt| first= Susan |author2=Peter Baker |author3=Toni Locy|date=January 21, 1998|work=The Washington Post| accessdate=August 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story swirled for several days and, despite swift denials from Clinton, the clamor for answers from the White House grew louder. On January 26, President Clinton, standing with his wife, spoke at a White House press conference, and issued a forceful denial in which he said:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apoliticus.com/2008/10/top-5-political-quotes-that-defined-presidencies/ Top 5: Political Quotes That Defined Presidencies], APOLITICUS.COM  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207092012/http://www.apoliticus.com/2008/10/top-5-political-quotes-that-defined-presidencies/ |date=December 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pundits debated whether Clinton would address the allegations in his [[State of the Union Address]]. Ultimately, he chose not to mention them. Hillary Clinton remained supportive of  her husband throughout the scandal. On January 27, in an appearance on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' she said, "The great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this [[vast right-wing conspiracy]] that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president."

For the next several months and through the summer, the media debated whether an affair had occurred and whether Clinton had lied or obstructed justice, but nothing could be definitively established beyond the taped recordings because Lewinsky was unwilling to discuss the affair or testify about it. On July 28, 1998, a substantial delay after the public break of the scandal, Lewinsky received [[Witness immunity|transactional immunity]] in exchange for [[grand jury]] testimony concerning her relationship with Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/07/28/lewinsky/|title=Lewinsky Strikes Far-Reaching Immunity Deal|last1= Blitzer| first1= Wolf|last2= Franken |first2= Bob|date=July 28, 1998|publisher=[[CNN]]| accessdate=March 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also turned over a [[semen]]-stained blue dress (that Linda Tripp had encouraged her to save without [[dry cleaning]]) to the Starr investigators, thereby providing unambiguous [[DNA]] evidence that could prove the relationship despite Clinton's official denials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/icreport/6narrit.htm#L28 | title=Starr Report | work= The Washington Post| accessdate=May 9, 2013 | date=September 15, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinton admitted in taped [[grand jury]] testimony on August 17, 1998, that he had engaged in an "improper physical relationship" with Lewinsky. That evening he gave a nationally televised statement admitting that his relationship with Lewinsky was "not appropriate".&lt;ref&gt;Clinton, Bill.

On August 20, 1998, three days after Clinton testified on the Monica Lewinsky scandal, [[Operation Infinite Reach]] launched missiles against al-Qaeda bases in Khost, Afghanistan, and the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum, Sudan.{{sfn|Baum|2006|p=1}} Some countries, media outlets, protesters, and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] accused Clinton of ordering the attacks as a diversion.{{sfn|Coll|2005|p=412}}&lt;ref name="vick"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vick|first1=Karl|title=U.S., Sudan Trade Claims on Factory|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1998/08/25/us-sudan-trade-claims-on-factory/b85afb93-83fb-4186-a49d-e5cb080a0187/|accessdate=August 17, 2016|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=August 24, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attacks also drew parallels to the then-recently released movie ''[[Wag the Dog]]'', which features a fictional president faking a war in [[Albania]] to distract attention from a sex scandal.{{sfn|Coll|2005|p=412}}&lt;ref name="Dirty"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Loeb|first1=Vernon|title=A Dirty Business|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1999/07/25/a-dirty-business/1af5189d-8973-41a3-8b6f-0e9e4ef4c691/|accessdate=August 17, 2016|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=July 25, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Administration officials denied any connection between the missile strikes and the ongoing scandal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=John|title=In the Midst of Scandal, Clinton Plotted Action|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=August 21, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pine|first1=Art|title=Missiles Strike Bases Linked to African Blasts|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/aug/21/news/mn-15247|accessdate=August 17, 2016|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 21, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 9/11 Commission investigators found no reason to dispute those statements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report.pdf 9/11 Commission Report], p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perjury charges==
In his deposition for the Jones lawsuit, Clinton denied having sexual relations with Lewinsky. Based on the evidence—a blue dress with Clinton's semen that Tripp provided—Starr concluded that the president's [[Oath|sworn]] testimony was false and [[Perjury|perjurious]].

During the deposition, Clinton was asked "Have you ever had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, as that term is defined in Deposition Exhibit 1?" The judge ordered that Clinton be given an opportunity to review the agreed definition. Afterwards, based on the definition created by the Independent Counsel's Office, Clinton answered, "I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky." Clinton later stated, "I thought the definition included any activity by [me], where [I] was the actor and came in contact with those parts of the bodies" which had been explicitly listed (and "with an intent to gratify or arouse the sexual desire of any person"). In other words, Clinton denied that ''he'' had ever contacted ''Lewinsky's'' "genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks", and effectively claimed that the agreed-upon definition of "sexual relations" included ''giving'' oral sex but excluded ''receiving'' [[fellatio|oral sex]].&lt;ref&gt;Tiersma, Peter. [http://www.languageandlaw.org/PERJURY.HTM "The Language of Perjury"], languageandlaw.org, November 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months after the Senate failed to convict him, President Clinton was held in civil [[contempt of court]] by Judge [[Susan Webber Wright]] for &lt;!--allegedly--&gt;&lt;!--Plaintiffs, defendants, and witnesses "allege", but a court ruling is a decision, a finding, and is considered proof; the matter is no longer merely "alleged".--&gt;giving [[Perjury|misleading testimony]] regarding his sexual relationship with Lewinsky, and was also fined $90,000 by Wright.&lt;ref name=ppppava/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Clinton declined to appeal the civil contempt of court ruling, citing financial problems,&lt;ref name=ppppava/&gt; but still maintained that his testimony complied with Wright's earlier definition of sexual relations.&lt;ref name=ppppava/&gt; In 2001, his [[license to practice law]] was suspended in Arkansas for five years and later by the [[United States Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Impeachment== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[State of the Union Address]] --&gt;
{{Main|Impeachment of Bill Clinton}}
In December 1998, Clinton's Democratic political party was in the minority in both chambers of Congress. A few Democratic members of Congress, and most in the opposition Republican Party, claimed that Clinton's giving false testimony and allegedly influencing Lewinsky's testimony were crimes of [[obstruction of justice]] and [[perjury]] and thus impeachable offenses.  The House of Representatives voted to issue Articles of Impeachment against him which was followed by a 21-day trial in the Senate.

All of the Democrats in the Senate voted for acquittal on both the perjury and the obstruction of justice charges.  Ten Republicans voted for acquittal for perjury: [[John Chafee]] (Rhode Island), [[Susan Collins]] (Maine), [[Slade Gorton]] (Washington), [[Jim Jeffords]] (Vermont), [[Richard Shelby]] (Alabama), [[Olympia Snowe]] (Maine), [[Arlen Specter]] (Pennsylvania), [[Ted Stevens]] (Alaska), [[Fred Thompson]] (Tennessee), and [[John Warner]] (Virginia). Five Republicans voted for acquittal for obstruction of justice: Chafee, Collins, Jeffords, Snowe, and Specter.

President Clinton was thereby acquitted of all charges and remained in office. There were attempts to [[Censure in the United States|censure]] the president by the House of Representatives, but those attempts failed.

==Aftermath==
===Effect on 2000 presidential election===
The scandal arguably affected the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 U.S. presidential election]] in two contradictory ways. [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidate and sitting vice president [[Al Gore]] said that Clinton's scandal had been "a drag" that deflated the enthusiasm of their party's base, and had the effect of reducing Democratic votes. Clinton said that the scandal had made Gore's campaign too cautious, and that if Clinton had been allowed to campaign for Gore in [[United States presidential election in Arkansas, 2000|Arkansas]] and [[United States presidential election in New Hampshire, 2000|New Hampshire]], either state would have delivered Gore's needed [[electoral votes]] regardless of the effects of the [[Florida election recount|Florida recount controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Bill Clinton on Lewinsky Affair: 'I Cracked' | first= Brian |last= Montopoli| work=Political Hotsheet |publisher= CBS News |date= September 21, 2009 |url= http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/09/21/politics/politicalhotsheet/entry5327644.shtml |accessdate= September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political analysts have supported both views. Before and after the 2000 election, John Cochran of ''[[ABC News]]'' connected the Lewinsky scandal with a voter phenomenon he called "Clinton fatigue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Missed opportunity: Gore, incumbency and television in election 2000 |first=Edwin D. |last= Dover |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2002 | isbn= 978-0-275-97638-5 |page= 130|quote= John Cochran on ABC described this phenomenon as "Clinton fatigue." He said voters were happy with the policy agenda and direction of the country but were tired of Clinton and wanted to forget him.

===Collateral scandals===
During the scandal, supporters of former President Clinton alleged that the matter should remain private, and called some supporting Clinton's impeachment hypocritical. For example, during the House investigation, it was revealed that [[Henry Hyde]], Republican chair of the [[House Judiciary Committee]] and [[House manager|lead House manager]], also had an affair while in office as a [[State legislature (United States)|state legislator]]. Hyde, aged 70 during the Lewinsky hearings, dismissed it as a "youthful indiscretion" (he had been 41).&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, David. "This hypocrite broke up my family", ''Salon'', September 16, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

A highly publicized investigation campaign actively sought information that might embarrass politicians who supported impeachment. According to the British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'',

{{quote|[[Larry Flynt]]...the publisher of ''[[Hustler]]'' magazine, offered a $1 million reward... Flynt was a sworn enemy of the Republican party [and] sought to dig up dirt on the Republican members of Congress who were leading the impeachment campaign against President Clinton.
[...Although] Flynt claimed at the time to have the goods on up to a dozen prominent Republicans, the ad campaign helped to bring down only one. Robert Livingston – a congressman from Louisiana...abruptly retired after learning that Mr. Flynt was about to reveal that he had also had an affair.&lt;ref&gt;Goldenberg, Suzanne.

Republican congressman [[Bob Livingston#Resignation|Bob Livingston]] had been widely expected to become [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] in the [[106th United States Congress|next Congressional session]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/10/us/robert-livingston-the-heir-apparent-with-a-black-belt.html "Robert Livingston, The Heir Apparent With a Black Belt"]. ''The New York Times'', November 10, 1998, p. A24. Retrieved September 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Then just weeks away after Flynt revealed the affair,  Livingston resigned and challenged Clinton to do the same.

Flynt's investigation also claimed that Congressman [[Bob Barr]], another Republican House manager, had an affair while married; Barr had been the first lawmaker in either chamber to call for Clinton's resignation due to the Lewinsky affair. Barr lost a primary challenge less than three years after the impeachment proceedings.&lt;ref name="Spoiler"&gt;McCaffrey, Shannon.

===Personal acceptance===
Historian [[Taylor Branch]] implied that Clinton had requested changes to Branch's 2009 Clinton biography, ''[[The Clinton Tapes: Wrestling History with the President]]'', regarding Clinton's revelation that the Lewinsky affair began because "I cracked; I just cracked." Branch writes that Clinton had felt "beleaguered, unappreciated, and open to a liaison with Lewinsky" following "the Democrats' loss of Congress in the November 1994 elections, the death of his mother the previous January, and the ongoing [[Whitewater controversy|Whitewater investigation]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Secret interviews add insight to Clinton presidency | first= Susan |last= Page |newspaper= USA Today | date=September 21, 2009 |url= https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2009-09-21-clinton-tapes_N.htm |accessdate= September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publicly, Clinton had previously blamed the affair on "a terrible moral error" and on anger at Republicans, stating, "if people have unresolved anger, it makes them do non-rational, destructive things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/06/20/clinton.book/ |title= Clinton: Lewinsky affair a 'terrible moral error'| publisher= CNN |date= June 21, 2004 |accessdate= May 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Croats]]''' ({{lang-hr|Hrvati}}, {{lang-ro|Croați}}) are an [[Minorities of Romania|ethnic minority]] in [[Romania]], numbering 6,786 people according to the 2002 census. They mainly live in the southwest of the country, particularly in [[Caraș-Severin County]]. Declared Croatians form a majority in two Romanian localities: the communes of [[Carașova]] and [[Lupac, Romania|Lupac]]. In these communes, [[Croatian language|Croatian]] is an officially recognised language, with [[signage]], education and access to justice and public administration being provided in Croatian alongside Romanian.

== Krashovani ==
{{main|Krashovani}}
Most Croats in Romania are [[Krashovani]], even though only around 200 people declared themselves Krashovani in the census, the rest declaring Croatian ethnicity. Due to some political, economic, social and cultural factors, most of them started identifying themselves with Croats, and some still continued to call themselves Krašovani. Today, many Krashovani chose the Croatian ethnicity, partly due to the attention given to them by the Croatian state (which also awards them the Croatian citizenship).

== Political participation ==
As an officially recognized ethnic minority, Croats have [[Romanian ethnic minorities parties|one seat]] reserved in the Romanian [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber of Deputies]], held by the [[Union of Croatians of Romania]].

A '''cultural movement''' is a change in the way a number of different disciplines approach their work. This embodies all [[art]] forms, the [[science]]s, and [[philosophies]]. Historically, different nations or regions of the world have gone through their own independent sequence of movements in [[culture]], but as world communications have accelerated this geographical distinction has become less distinct. When cultural movements go through revolutions from one to the next, genres tend to get attacked and mixed up, and often new genres are generated and old ones fade. These changes are often reactions against the prior cultural form, which typically has grown stale and repetitive. An obsession emerges among the mainstream with the new movement, and the old one falls into neglect – sometimes it dies out entirely, but often it chugs along favored in a few disciplines and occasionally making reappearances (sometimes prefixed with "neo-").

There is continual argument over the precise definition of each of these periods, and one historian might group them differently, or choose different names or descriptions. As well, even though in many cases the popular change from one to the next can be swift and sudden, the beginning and end of movements are somewhat subjective, as the movements did not spring fresh into existence out of the blue and did not come to an abrupt end and lose total support, as would be suggested by a date range. Thus use of the term "period" is somewhat deceptive. "Period" also suggests a linearity of development, whereas it has not been uncommon for two or more distinctive cultural approaches to be active at the same time. Historians will be able to find distinctive traces of a cultural movement before its accepted beginning, and there will always be new creations in old forms. So it can be more useful to think in terms of broad "movements" that have rough beginnings and endings. Yet for historical perspective, some rough date ranges will be provided for each to indicate the "height" or accepted time span of the movement.

This current article covers western, notably European and American cultural movements. They have, however, been paralleled by cultural movements in the Orient and elsewhere. In the late 20th and early 21st century in Thailand, for example, there has been a cultural shift away from western social and political values more toward Japanese and Chinese. As well, That culture has reinvigorated monarchical concepts to accommodate state shifts away from western ideology regarding democracy and monarchies. 
&lt;!-- NOTE: I'm including the sub-sections (the isms) *only* for organizational purposes since in most cases Wikipedia does not have articles on the various sections/periods/movements/whatever. Similarly for calling out the different cultural forms - art, architecture, philosophy, etc. I also think it is worthwhile to include short descriptions of each movement for similar reasons. The purpose of this page is to help get these areas of Wikipedia filled in – hopefully by folks more knowledgeable in the particular topics than I! --&gt;

==Cultural movements==
* [[Graeco-Roman]]
** The [[ancient Greece|Greek]] culture marked a departure from the other Mediterranean cultures that preceded and surrounded it. The [[ancient Rome|Romans]] adopted Greek and other styles, and spread the result throughout Europe and the [[Middle East]]. Together, Greek and Roman thought in philosophy, religion, science, history, and all forms of thought can be viewed as a central underpinning of [[Western culture]], and is therefore termed the "Classical period" by some. Others might divide it into the [[Hellenistic]] period and the Roman period, or might choose other finer divisions.
:: See: [[Classical architecture]] — [[Classical sculpture]] — [[Architecture of Ancient Greece|Greek architecture]] — [[Hellenistic architecture]] — [[Ionic order|Ionic]] — [[Doric order|Doric]] — [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] — [[Stoicism]] — [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]] — [[Epicurean]] — [[Roman architecture]] — [[Early Christian]] — [[Neoplatonism]]
* [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] (11th century &amp; 12th centuries)
** A style (esp. architectural) similar in form and materials to Roman styles. Romanesque seems to be the first pan-European style since Roman Imperial Architecture and examples are found in every part of the continent.
:: See: [[Romanesque architecture]] — [[Ottonian Art]]
* [[Gothic art|Gothic]] (mid 12th century until mid 15th century)
: &lt;!-- description goes here --&gt;
:: See: [[Gothic architecture]] — [[Gregorian chant]] — [[Neoplatonism]]
* [[Nominalism]]
&lt;!--Can someone well versed in medieval history help figure out how/where this fits in? --&gt;
** Rejects [[Platonic realism]] as a requirement for thinking and speaking in general terms.
* [[Renaissance humanism|Humanism]] (16th century)
&lt;!-- description goes here --&gt;
* [[Renaissance]]
** The use of light, shadow, and perspective to more accurately represent life. Because of how fundamentally these ideas were felt to alter so much of life, some have referred to it as the "Golden Age". In reality it was less an "Age" and more of a movement in popular philosophy, science, and thought that spread over Europe (and probably other parts of the world), over time, and affected different aspects of culture at different points in time. Very roughly, the following periods can be taken as indicative of place/time foci of the Renaissance: [[Italian Renaissance]] 1450–1550. [[Spanish Renaissance]] 1550–1587. [[English Renaissance]] 1588–1629.
* [[Protestant Reformation]]
** The Protestant Reformation, often referred to simply as the Reformation, was a [[schism]] from the [[Roman Catholic Church]] initiated by [[Martin Luther]], [[John Calvin]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and other early [[Protestant Reformers]] in the 16th century Europe.
* [[Mannerism]]
** Anti-classicist movement that sought to emphasize the feeling of the artist himself.
** See: [[Mannerism/Art]]
* [[Baroque]]
** Emphasizes power and authority, characterized by intricate detail and without the "disturbing angst" of Mannerism. Essentially is exaggerated [[Classicism]] to promote and glorify the Church and State. Occupied with notions of infinity.
** See: [[Baroque|Baroque art]] — [[Baroque music]]
* [[Rococo]]
* [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] (17th–19th centuries)
** Severe, unemotional movement recalling Roman and Greek ("classical") style, reacting against the overbred Rococo style and the emotional Baroque style. It stimulated revival of classical thinking, and had especially profound effects on science and politics. Also had a direct influence on [[Academic art|Academic Art]] in the 19th century. Beginning in the early 17th century with Cartesian thought (see [[René Descartes]]), this movement provided philosophical frameworks for the natural sciences, sought to determine the principles of knowledge by rejecting all things previously believed to be known about the world. In [[Renaissance Classicism]] attempts are made to recreate the classic art forms — tragedy, comedy, and farce.
** See also: [[Weimar Classicism]]
*[[Age of Enlightenment]] (1688–1789): Reason ([[rationalism]]) seen as the ideal.
* [[Romanticism]] (1770–1830)
** Began in [[Germany]] and spread to [[England]] and [[France]] as a reaction against Neoclassicism and against the Age of Enlightenment.. The notion of "folk genius", or an inborn and intuitive ability to do magnificent things, is a core principle of the Romantic movement. Nostalgia for the primitive past in preference to the scientifically minded present. [[Romantic hero]]es, exemplified by Napoleon, are popular. Fascination with the past leads to a resurrection of interest in the Gothic period. It did not really replace the Neoclassical movement so much as provide a counterbalance; many artists sought to join both styles in their works.
** See: [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]
* [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] (1830–1905)
** Ushered in by the [[Industrial Revolution]] and growing [[Nationalism]] in the world. Began in France. Attempts to portray the speech and mannerisms of everyday people in [[everyday life]]. Tends to focus on [[middle class]] social and domestic problems. Plays by [[Ibsen]] are an example. [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]] evolved from [[Realism (theatre)|Realism]], following it briefly in art and more enduringly in theatre, film, and [[Naturalism (literature)|literature]]. [[Impressionism]], based on 'scientific' knowledge and discoveries concerns observing nature and reality objectively.
** See: [[Post-impressionism]] — [[Neo-impressionism]] — [[Pointillism]] — [[Pre-Raphaelite]]
* [[Art Nouveau]] (1880–1905)
** Decorative, symbolic art
** See: [[Transcendentalism]]
* [[Modernism]] (1880–1965)
** Also known as the [[Avant-garde]] movement. Originating in the 19th century with [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], the Modernist movement composed itself of a wide range of 'isms' that ran in contrast to Realism and that sought out the underlying fundamentals of art and philosophy. The [[Jazz Age|Jazz age]] and Hollywood emerge and have their hey-days.
** See: [[Fauvism]] — [[Cubism]] — [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]] — [[Suprematism]] — [[Dada]] — [[Constructivist epistemology|Constructivism]] — [[Surrealism]] — [[Expressionism]] — [[Existentialism]] — [[Op Art]] — [[Art Deco]] — [[Bauhaus]] — [[Neo-Plasticism]] — [[Precisionism]] — [[Abstract expressionism]] — [[New Realism]] — [[Color field painting]] — [[Happening]] — [[Fluxus]] — [[Hard-edge painting]] — [[Pop Art]] — [[Photorealism]] — [[Minimalism]] — [[Postminimalism]] — [[Lyrical Abstraction]] — [[Situationist International|Situationism]]
* [[Postmodernism]] (since c.1965)
** A reaction to Modernism, in a way, Postmodernism largely discards the notion that artists should seek pure fundamentals, often questioning whether such fundamentals even exist – or suggestion that if they do exist, they may be irrelevant. It is exemplified by movements such as [[deconstructivism]], [[conceptual art]], ''etc.''
** See: [[Postmodern philosophy]] — [[Postmodern music]] — [[Postmodern art]]
* [[Post-postmodernism]] (since c.1990)

'''Disability in Saudi Arabia''' is seen through the lens of [[Sharia|Islamic Sharia]], through cultural norms and also through legislation. As an Islamic society that follows the [[Quran|Qur'an]] and the [[Sunnah]], disability is often seen through the lens of religion.{{Sfn|Alquraini|2011|p=152}} Islam teaches that people with disabilities are to be treated with respect and equality. However, Saudi Arabia tends to view disability through the [[Medical model of disability|medical model]], rather than the [[Social model of disability|social model]].{{Sfn|Mulazadeh|Al-Harbi|2016|p=124}} In addition, there are few studies relating to people with disabilities in Saudi Arabia compared to other countries.{{Sfn|Al-Jadid|2013|p=455}}

== Demographics ==
For many years, it was thought that the rate of disability in Saudi Arabia was low, but it turned out that many families were not integrating people with disabilities into daily life.{{Sfn|Al-Jadid|2013|p=455}} A 2000 census found that 135,000 Saudi Arabian people have disabilities, with 33.7% of these being physical disabilities.{{Sfn|Mulazadeh|Al-Harbi|2016|p=122}} More people with disabilities live in rural areas.{{Sfn|JICA|2002|p=11}}

== Causes ==
In 2010, statistics showed the leading cause of disability in Saudi Arabia for men was traffic injuries on the highway, while for women, the leading cause was [[major depressive disorder]].{{Sfn|Aldosari|2017|p=17}} The prevalence of depression in women is between 17 and 46 percent and early diagnosis is critical to both patient outcome and cost of treatment.{{Sfn|Aldosari|2017|p=23}} Younger women are also more likely to intentionally attempt [[suicide]].{{Sfn|Aldosari|2017|p=24}}

Another major cause of disability is close family intermarriage.{{Sfn|JICA|2002|p=7}} [[Cousin|First cousins]] marrying in Saudi Arabia is common.{{Sfn|Al-Jadid|2013|p=455}} There is also a higher risk of [[Congenital disorder|congenital]] disability among parents who are disabled, older mothers and mothers who do not have adequate health care during pregnancy.{{Sfn|Al-Jadid|2013|p=456}}

== Cultural attitudes towards disability ==
[[File:Beggars_out_at_Arafat_-_Flickr_-_Al_Jazeera_English.jpg|alt=A person with disability begging for money at Mount Arafat, 2011.|thumb|A person with disability begging for money at [[Mount Arafat]], 2011.]]
In [[Islam|Islamic]] society, there is an emphasis in respecting the lives of people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whyislam.org/social-values-in-islam/disability-in-islam/|title=Disability in Islam|last=Pervez|first=Saulat|date=|website=Why Islam|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Islam is against all kinds of discrimination, including discrimination against disability.{{Sfn|Al-Jadid|2013|p=454}} In society, people with disabilities are often marginalized for various reasons, including lack of education about disabilities in communities and shame for having disability and the [[poverty]] that often accompanies disability.{{Sfn|Al-Jadid|2013|p=456-457}} Parents of children with disabilities such as [[autism]], often get information about their children's condition from non-medical sources, believing [[Vaccine|vaccinations]] or the [[evil eye]] caused the autism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some parents turn to religion to help their children improve.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Among health care professionals, there is an overall positive attitude towards people with disabilities, regardless of gender.{{Sfn|Al-Abdulwahab|Al-Gain|2003|p=66}}{{Sfn|Al-Abdulwahab|Al-Gain|2003|p=67}} It was found that doctors often did not give adequate health information to patients who have [[Down syndrome]].{{Sfn|Jan|Binjahlan|Alqurashi|Alqurashi|2017|p=148}} It is still common for people who can afford it to receive medical treatment for disabilities in [[Western world|Western]] countries.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Algahtani|first=Mohammed M. J.|date=January 2012|title=Understanding Autism in Saudi Arabia: A Qualitative Analysis of the Community and Cultural Context|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2699971361.html|journal=Journal of Paediatric Neurology|volume=|pages=|subscription=yes|via=HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is [[politically correct]] to refer to people with disabilities as "people with special needs."{{Sfn|Al-Jadid|2013|p=455}} 

== Policy ==
Saudi Arabia bases its laws on Islamic [[Sharia]].{{Sfn|Al-Jadid|2013|p=456}} Islamic Sharia puts an emphasis on people with disabilities to have the rights "to live with dignity and benefit from welfare."{{Sfn|JICA|2002|p=7}} The [[House of Saud|Royal Family]] of Saudi Arabia is supportive of both private and public endeavors to help people with disabilities.{{Sfn|JICA|2002|p=7-8}}

The [[Ministry of Education (Saudi Arabia)|Ministry of Education]] runs several organizations to help people with disabilities. These include the [[Noor Institute for the Blind]], the [[Amal Institute for the Deaf]] and the [[Institute for the Intellectually Disabled]].{{Sfn|JICA|2002|p=10}} Other organizations are run by the [[Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (Saudi Arabia)|Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs]].{{Sfn|JICA|2002|p=10}} The [[Ministry of Health (Saudi Arabia)|Ministry of Health]] provides health services to most people in Saudi Arabia.{{Sfn|Al-Jadid|2013|p=457}}

People with disabilities in Saudi Arabia are entitled to 50% off airfare for themselves and a companion.{{Sfn|JICA|2002|p=16}} They have the right to education, equal work and access to public space.{{Sfn|JICA|2002|p=16}} People with disabilities are entitled to handicapped parking spaces and a subsidy of SR 10,000 to convert cars for specifications relating to their disability.{{Sfn|JICA|2002|p=16}} [[Social security]] is available to individuals with disabilities or who become disabled later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/progdesc/ssptw/2010-2011/asia/saudiarabia.html|title=Social Security Programs Throughout the World: Asia and the Pacific, 2010 - Saudi Arabia|last=|first=|date=|website=United States Social Security|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-governmental organizations ===
The [[King Salman Center for Disability Research|King Salman Centre for Disability Research]], Disabled Children Association and the Joint Centre for Research in Prosthetics and Orthotics and Rehabilitation Programs are three non-governmental organizations operating in Saudi Arabia to help people with disabilities.{{Sfn|JICA|2002|p=21}}

=== Legislation ===
The first law to protect people with disabilities in Saudi Arabia was created in 1956 with Royal Decree No. 1219.{{Sfn|Mulazadeh|Al-Harbi|2016|p=121}} This decree also directs government organizations to coordinate with [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organizations]] so that  services aren't duplicated.{{Sfn|JICA|2002|p=10}} It is also concurrent with a major outbreak of [[Poliomyelitis|polio]] in the country.{{Sfn|Al-Jadid|2013|p=456-457}} In 1969, the labor code was established to define [[vocational rehabilitation]] for people with disabilities.{{Sfn|JICA|2002|p=11}} The Council of Ministers Resolution No. 407 in 1973 provided a monthly [[Allowance (money)|allowance]] for people with disabilities who "participate at Disabled Training Centers."{{Sfn|JICA|2002|p=11}} The next year, the Council of Ministers passed Resolution No. 715 which provided services for various people with disabilities who require medical care.{{Sfn|JICA|2002|p=11}} The Decree No. 129 created policy for the [[General Department of Rehabilitation (Saudi Arabia)|General Department of Rehabilitation]] and created vocational and rehabilitation programs for people with disabilities.{{Sfn|JICA|2002|p=12}} 

In 1980, under the Council of Ministers Resolution No. 219 allows the General Department of Rehabilitation is to give an annual donation of [[Saudi riyal|SR]] 30,000 to projects for people with disabilities which were created by people with disabilities themselves.{{Sfn|JICA|2002|p=12}} The Council of Ministers Resolution No. 187 in 1981 allowed people with disabilities and organizations they run to reprieve a 50% discount on government-owned [[Transport|transportation]].{{Sfn|JICA|2002|p=12}}  In 1987, Legislation of Disability was created.{{Sfn|Mulazadeh|Al-Harbi|2016|p=121}} In 1992, the Basic System, Issue No. A/90, article 27 ensures that citizens' rights are upheld in "cases of emergency, disability, or old age by providing social security."{{Sfn|JICA|2002|p=11}} In 1997, the Council of Ministers Resolution No. 85 created the Person with Disabilities Services Coordination Committee.{{Sfn|JICA|2002|p=12-13}} The resolution also created plans to raise awareness of disabilities and provided donations to families of people with disabilities.{{Sfn|JICA|2002|p=12-13}} The Council of Ministers Resolution No. 7 of 1999 provides approval to raise donations up to SR 50,000 for rehabilitation programs developed by people with disabilities for training goals.{{Sfn|JICA|2002|p=12}}

Later, the Disability Code of 2000 was created.{{Sfn|Mulazadeh|Al-Harbi|2016|p=121}} The disability code emphasizes the civil rights of people with disabilities to equally access free and "appropriate medical, psychological, social, educational, and rehabilitation services through public agencies."{{Sfn|Alquraini|2011|p=150}} The only provision of Saudi Arabian law that deal with accessibility is the Saudi Building Code (SBC) of 2007, which states that all buildings must be accessible, but doesn't provide exact determinations of what this needs to entail.{{Sfn|Mulazadeh|Al-Harbi|2016|p=124}}

Criticism of legislation for people with disabilities is that since it is most often based on the [[medical model of disability]], it rarely deals with the social consequences that people with disability face in Saudi Arabia.{{Sfn|Mulazadeh|Al-Harbi|2016|p=124}} Not dealing with the social aspects of disability means that there is not enough emphasis on integrating people into society.{{Sfn|Mulazadeh|Al-Harbi|2016|p=127}} For example, despite the passage of SBC, many people who use [[Wheelchair|wheelchairs]] face difficultly accessing public spaces in Saudi Arabia.{{Sfn|Mulazadeh|Al-Harbi|2016|p=126}}

=== Education ===
The first [[special education]] services were provided for [[Visual impairment|blind]] students who received education in "scientific institutes" in 1958.{{Sfn|Al-Jadid|2013|p=458}} Prior to 1958, parents were expected to provide assistance to their children with disabilities.{{Sfn|Alquraini|2011|p=150}} Official special education in Saudi Arabia was created in 1962, when the [[Ministry of Education (Saudi Arabia)|Ministry of Education]] established the Department of Special Learning.{{Sfn|Altamimi|Lee|Sayed-Ahmed|Kassem|2015|p=98}} Like most schools in Saudi Arabia, special education classes are also gender segregated and teach [[Islam|Islamic]] principals.{{Sfn|Altamimi|Lee|Sayed-Ahmed|Kassem|2015|p=98}} A study published in 2016 looked at parent's satisfaction with special education for daughters with learning disabilities. The results were that the parents were generally satisfied with intervention and referral services,{{Sfn|Abahusain|2016|p=203}} and with classroom services for their daughters.{{Sfn|Abahusain|2016|p=205}} Special education is meant to take place in the [[least restrictive environment]] (LRE) and all students have an [[Individualized Education Program|Individual Educational Program]] (IEP).{{Sfn|Alquraini|2011|p=151}}{{Sfn|Alquraini|2011|p=156}}

== Unique challenges ==
Accessibility to buildings for those with physical disabilities in Saudi Arabia is lacking.{{Sfn|Mulazadeh|Al-Harbi|2016|p=122}} In addition, there are more services and organizations for people with disabilities in urban areas.{{Sfn|JICA|2002|p=8}}

Saudi Arabia offers limited [[mental health]] services.{{Sfn|Aldosari|2017|p=24}}

[[Prosthesis|Prosthetics]] must be engineered to help people be able to attend and perform the [[Adhan|Muslim Call to Prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-642877241.html|title=A Cutting-Edge Rehabilitation Facility in Saudi Arabia Is Now a City of Hope|last=Harrison|first=Roger|date=1 June 2004|work=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs|access-date=10 September 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|subscription=yes|via=HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender and disability ===
Women in Saudi Arabia often must use women-only clinics which are often not accessible for individuals with physical disabilities.{{Sfn|Aldosari|2017|p=11}} Women's restrictions in Saudi Arabia limit their ability to access mental health services.{{Sfn|Aldosari|2017|p=24}} Girls with disabilities have often been hidden at home so that people are not afraid to marry into their family.{{Sfn|Al-Jadid|2013|p=455}}

Various sorts of '''dogs''' are known to have existed in prehispanic [[Mesoamerica|In]] Mesoamerica, as shown by archaeological and iconographical sources, and the testimonies of the 16th-century Spaniards. In the Central Mexican area, there were three races: the medium-sized furred dog (''itzcuintli''), the medium-sized hairless dog (''[[xoloitzcuintli]]''), and the short-legged, (''tlalchichi'') based in Colima and now extinct. Apart from other, more obvious functions, dogs were also used for food (10% of all consumed meat in [[Teotihuacan]]) and ritual sacrifice.
{{TOC right}}

==Maya used domesticated dogs==
The ancient [[Maya civilization|Mayan]]s, a group of people who lived throughout southern [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]], used domesticated [[dog]]s on a daily basis as a food source, hunting aide, and an element in religious and spiritual rituals.

==Archaeological evidence==
Remains of dogs have been found in sites dating from the [[Preclassic Maya|Preclassic]] through the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Postclassic Era|Postclassic]] periods of [[Mesoamerica]] dating as early as 1200 BCE.  These remains have appeared in [[midden]]s, spread over yard surfaces, and near areas of sacrificial offerings. Since the deposits of dogs were discovered along with other plant and animal remains, it is difficult to decipher dog parts from those of other small mammals.  In [[Colha, Belize]], dog foot bones and teeth were found more than any other body part.

==Uses of dogs==
Despite the fact that the amount of dog use varied throughout time and place, people of the coastal regions of the Maya area placed more importance on dogs due to their constant availability as a source of protein and their ability to rapidly reproduce.{{citation needed|date=September 2008}} Breeding and raising domesticated dogs required low energy use.  Fish and other hunted animals were not as reliable as dogs as a food resource, and it required more energy and time to capture these animals for consumption.  Overall, it is because of the comparison of dog deposits to other fauna and how the amount of dog deposits differs among sites from various periods.  Because of this variation, it is not certain if the function of dogs altered from a food source to that of a religious symbol over time.  Besides becoming a meal, dogs were also used as hunting and traveling companions and were scavengers in the home.

===Dogs as food===
During a portion of the Preclassic and Early Classic period (1200 BCE through 250 CE), dogs in [[Cuello]], Belize were bred and killed once they reached one year of age.  Dog bones had completed [[epiphyseal plate|epiphyseal fusion]] and did not indicate the normal pattern of wear like adult dogs who lived longer than a year.  Puppy remains were not found.  Dogs were castrated and fed [[maize]] until they were fat enough to be ready for slaughter.  Throughout the Preclassic period in the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán region]], dogs were not the primary meat supply, but archaeological evidence indicates they were a substantial part of the Maya diet.  In fact, at the Colha site, white-tailed deer accounted for up to fifty percent of the Maya meat source.  Starting in the Preclassic period, Maya elites served dogs during competitive feasts.  They were either stewed or were burned in a sacrificial ceremony.  Bones were chopped, broken, crushed and boiled to extract the marrow inside.

===Dog nutrition===
In addition to eating [[maize]], dogs ate household scraps.  There is no evidence for any kind of specialized diet for dogs.  Today, the [[Yucatec]] Maya continue to talk about their dog-eating ancestors and carry on the tradition of feeding dogs maize by giving them six to eight [[tortilla]]s daily.

===Breeds of dog===
Contemporary Maya have nine words for "dog" in their lexicon, not all of which correspond to separate breeds. It was documented in the sixteenth century by Spanish explorers in Mérida, Yucatán that dogs were bred locally in pens, fed maize, and sold at market.  Another type of dog recognized by Maya was the hairless [[xoloitzcuintli]], however, breeds are difficult to recognize archaeologically.

==Dogs in Maya culture and religion==
{{main|Dogs in Mesoamerican folklore and myth}}

===Dogs in Maya literature===
In the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', the [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Maya]] creation story, dogs played important roles in certain events.  For example, the second attempt at creating humans turned disastrous when the gods made them out of wood.  The wooden humans were emotionless and would not feed the dogs.  In retaliation, the dogs became angry and destroyed them.  The moral of the story is “civilized” Maya make certain that dogs are fed on a decent human diet such as maize.  When dogs were used in ritual sacrifices, the act contained a dual meaning: a person gave respect to the dog by feeding it maize, which represent humans.  Humans were made of maize by the gods in the Popol Vuh.  Another account in the Popol Vuh describes the [[Maya Hero Twins|Hero twins]] sacrificing a dog that belonged to the Lords of the Underworld, also known as [[Xibalba]].  After the dog was dead, the Hero Twins brought it back to life.  The Lords were so impressed that they asked the twins to sacrifice and resurrect them.  In the end, the Hero Twins sacrificed the Lords of Xibalba and did not follow through on bringing them back to life.  This made it possible for humans to live on earth.  The story linked dogs with renewal and human life.  Dogs are associated with death and have the job of leading people into the Underworld.  They represent fire and are protectors of the hearth, two components of Maya life.

===Dog sacrifice and burial===
There are multiple situations in which dogs were used for sacrifice or burial.  Dog sacrifices were important in the political sphere for rituals concerning “...inaugurations and founding of new civic religious centres...”{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} There has also been confirmation of dog burials in [[Cozumel]] used in circumstances involving administration.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}  Dogs were associated with “new beginnings" and were sacrificed instead of humans on the New Year ceremony.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}  Dogs with spots that looked like the color of [[Cocoa bean|cacao]] were sacrificed during cacao rituals because they represented economic significance.  Landmarks linked to [[fertility]] and [[ancestor worship]] contain dog burials.  Dogs were found buried alongside humans in graves as well as in royal residences,{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} presumably to guide their owners to the afterlife.

===Dogs in Maya art===
In Maya art, dogs are represented in various roles and media.  They have been depicted in scenes such as those from the Popol Vuh or burial processions.  The [http://www.mayavase.com Maya Vase Database] exhibits a great example of a possible funeral procession on a painted vase, [http://research.mayavase.com/kerrmaya_list.php?_allSearch=&amp;hold_search=&amp;vase_number=5534&amp;date_added=&amp;ms_number=&amp;site=&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 K5534].  The dog standing below the head noble’s [[palanquin]] may be guiding its owner to Xibalba.  In picture [http://research.mayavase.com/kerrmaya_list.php?_allSearch=&amp;hold_search=&amp;vase_number=555&amp;date_added=&amp;ms_number=&amp;site=&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 K555], another vase painting shows a scene from the Popol Vuh with Dog asking Itzamná to return to Xibalba.  In addition to paintings, artists created clay figurines to resemble dogs, [http://research.mayavase.com/portfolio_hires.php?search=*Colima*&amp;date_added=&amp;image=8235&amp;display=8&amp;rowstart=40 K8235].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1392">The term '''economic spin-off''' is widely used in popular media to describe the potential secondary economic effects of project or development.  This may reflect a real phenomenon, especially when used looking back into the past, where the results are measurable, though still subject to rival interpretations.  More often, however, it is use by proponents of a particular project to [[speculate]] or [[promotion (marketing)|promote]] their favoured project.

An example of the former (measuring past results) would include a report in the activities surrounding the [[400th anniversary of Quebec City|400th Anniversary of Quebec City]], which claimed that the festivities created 8,742 [[person-year]]s of employment (jobs) C$438 million of [[value added]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bcn.gouv.qc.ca/publications/pdf/400e_RetEcono_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of the latter (making claims to support a project) include the following:  A 2003 presentation by the [[Caribbean Tourism Organization]] supporting the [[2007 World Cup of Cricket]] A new public bus service promote by the [[Société de transport de l’Outaouais]] suggests that a new bus service will promote urban development and more localized consumption along the route.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rapibus.sto.ca/index.php?id=219 Economic Spin-offs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of programming in women's prisons ==
{{See also|Prison contemplative programs}}

=== Before 1980 ===
Programming for imprisoned women was centered on domesticity, although efforts were made to include industrial training programs and academic programs. For example, the [[Indiana Women's Prison]] tried to incorporate chair caning, paper-boxing making, glove stitching, and laundry, which, with the exception of the latter, were deemed "financially disappointing."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.press.umich.edu/pdf/9780472080526-ch5.pdf|title=Their Sisters' Keepers: Women's Prison Reform in America 1830-1930|last=Freedman|first=Estelle|date=2009|website=The University of Michigan Press|publisher=University of Michigan|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic classes were difficult to maintain due to staff and funding shortages, and differences in education levels among the women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At another institution in Framingham, Massachusetts, administrators implemented an indenture system, a conditional early release program that allowed women to serve as domestic servants in nearby homes located on the country side, which proved to be rather successful with a less than nine percent recidivism rate for those who participated in the program. Domesticity was also promoted by prisoner officials. For example, in 1896, former superintendent Sarah Keely described the work offered to women as being appropriate, since it reflected work in a familial setting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The lucrative nature and accessibility of acquiring domestic skills contributed to their lack of participation in higher skills training.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite efforts to equip female inmates with remunerative skills, programming throughout the early and mid-1900's continued to consist of limited educational and vocational opportunities. Job training programming mostly entailed training in as cleaning, sewing,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; cosmetology, food service, laundry, and clerical work,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.dldocs.stir.ac.uk/documents/womenoffenders.pdf|title=Substance abuse treatment for women offenders|last=Kassebaum|first=Patricia|publisher=US Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Center for Substance Abuse Treatment|year=2004|isbn=|location=Rockville, MD|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; programs that did not lead women to meaningful and financially secure job opportunities upon release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prendergast|first=Michael L.|last2=Wellisch|first2=Jean|last3=Falkin|first3=Gregory P.|date=1995-06-01|title=Assessment of and Services for Substance-Abusing Women Offenders in Community and Correctional Settings|url=http://tpj.sagepub.com/content/75/2/240|journal=The Prison Journal|language=en|volume=75|issue=2|pages=240–256|doi=10.1177/0032855595075002007|issn=0032-8855}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that use of such programs persisted since most women entered prison with little to no education or work experience.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Carla|date=2006|title=Gender and Use of Substance Abuse Treatment Services|url=http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh291/55-62.pdf|journal=Health Services Research|volume=29|issue=1|pages=55–62|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Prior to the 1980s, there was a lack of programming focused on drug treatment for incarcerated women, and even less research regarding the outcomes of treatment programs in general.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lipton|first=D. S.|last2=Falkin|first2=G. P.|last3=Wexler|first3=H. K.|date=1992-01-01|title=Correctional drug abuse treatment in the United States: an overview|journal=NIDA research monograph|volume=118|pages=8–30|issn=1046-9516|pmid=1620228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research regarding the relationship between women and substance abuse had begun only a few years earlier during the 1970s, and focused primarily on alcohol treatment services, rather than drug treatment services.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Furthermore, since the female prison population was relatively small, male substance abuse treatment had set the standard. Two of the earliest research studies investigated the outcomes of Cornerstone program (Oregon, 1976), and the  Stay'n Out  program (New York, 1974), with the latter conducted at an all-female facility. While these programs were found to be successful, it was noted that other male-oriented programming such as urine testing and drug education courses were generally ineffective for female offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vigdal|first=Gerald|last2=Stadler|first2=Donald|year=1992|title=Comprehensive System Development in Corrections for Drug-Abusing Offenders: The Wisconsin Department of Corrections|url=http://archives.drugabuse.gov/pdf/monographs/118.pdf#page=133|journal=NIDA research monograph 118|pages=126–141|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only during the 1980s and 1990s did research regarding gender-specific programming for women become more prevalent.

=== 1980's to late 1990's ===
During the 1980s and the early 1990s, researchers began investigating how substance abuse affected women and men differently,&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson-Zlupko|first=Lani|last2=Kauffman|first2=Eda|last3=Dore|first3=Martha Morrison|date=1995-01-01|title=Gender Differences in Drug Addiction and Treatment: Implications for Social Work Intervention with Substance-Abusing Women|url=http://sw.oxfordjournals.org/content/40/1/45|journal=Social Work|language=en|volume=40|issue=1|pages=45–54|doi=10.1093/sw/40.1.45|issn=0037-8046|pmid=7863372}}&lt;/ref&gt; and how women functioned in traditional treatment programs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Researchers found that the characteristics of female substance abuse differed from male substance abuse in several ways including pathways to drug use, psychosocial factors, and psychological impacts of drug use.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; One study conducted in California prisons found that nearly 80% of women reported some form of physical and/or sexual abuse followed by post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephanie S. Covington PhD|first=LCSW|date=1998-02-12|title=Women in Prison|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J015v21n01_03|journal=Women &amp; Therapy|volume=21|issue=1|pages=141–155|doi=10.1300/J015v21n01_03|issn=0270-3149}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zlotnick|first=Caron|title=Treatment of Incarcerated Women with Substance Use Disorder and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder in Providence, Rhode Island, 1999-2001|url=http://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR03416.v1|journal=ICPSR Data Holdings|doi=10.3886/icpsr03416.v1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it was observed that in traditional drug and alcohol programs such as Alcohol Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA), women had lower participation rates in all aspects including entry, retention, and completion compared to those of their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The emphasis on gender-specific programming was further substantiated by the fact that a greater proportion of women than men were serving sentences for drug-related offenses during this period of time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In highlighting the relationship between women's drug use to other issues such as poverty, abuse, race and gender inequalities, studies acknowledged the ineffectiveness of isolated, treatment options.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|date=September 1999|title=Gender-Responsive Programming for Women Offenders: Guiding Principles and Practices|url=http://www.csc-scc.gc.ca/research/forum/e113/113f_e.pdf|journal=Forum on Corrections Research|volume=11|issue=3|pages=22–27|last1=Bloom|first1=Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As a result of this research, several designs for an effective gender-specific program were identified. Some of most common characteristics included female-only environments, promotion of female empowerment, skill building, mutual exchange, and relational orientation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

One major effort designed to achieve gender-specific substance abuse treatment include the implementation and monitoring of therapeutic communities (TCs), which are characterized by the National Institute for Drug Abuse as "drug-free residential settings that use a hierarchical model with treatment stages that reflect increased levels of personal and social responsibility". TCs have been a national model for drug abuse treatment historically found in male facilities, but have appeared in female facilities. While male-oriented TCs tend to use authoritarian and aggressive approaches, female-oriented TCs take a more relaxed, and less confrontational approach.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In both cases, TCs have been successful in reducing recidivism. For example, the Stay'n Out program was shown to reduce recidivism rates for both women and men. Furthermore, women who stayed in the program for 9 to 12 months were more likely to successfully complete their parole compared to their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; For women suffering from severe and long-term abuse, a more intense TC, residential TC, was implemented. Women in these residential programs lived together, and away from the general prison population. Despite this being most needed form of treatment for women, in 1994, most prisons lacked this type residential programming, with less than nine percent of women receiving such treatment while incarcerated.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In addition to TC programs being successful, they tend to be less expensive than the cost of incarceration.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1993, the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, an initiative developed under the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), began funding mid-term and long-term residential TC programs for incarcerated women. These programs tend to last anywhere from fifty days to six months. In addition, they began funding one residential program, and two intensive intervention programs which lasted at least six months, and on average two weeks, respectively. One TC program was roughly $790,000 for 250 women, or approximately $3,200 per inmate, while the cost of incarceration ranged from $20,000 and $30,000, supporting the idea that incarceration is more expensive than treatment. In the case of CSAT-sponsored programs, the average cost of incarceration was roughly $51, while the cost of treatment was $9.22 per woman.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In the early 1990s, post-secondary educational programs were solely academic in nature, and in women's prisons, were either nonexistent, or underutilized, with less than 10 percent of female prison population enrolled in educational programming.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In 1994, this number further decreased due to inmates' ineligibility for the Pell grant and other financial aid.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.dllr.state.md.us/adulted/aeprisonpostseced.pdf|title=1 Prison Postsecondary Education: Bridging Learning from Incarceration to the Community|last=Contardo|first=Jeanne|last2=Tolbert|first2=Michelle|publisher=Reentry Roundtable on Education, John Jay College of Criminal Justice|year=2008|publication-place=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for educational programming included federal grants, private donors, as well as state financial aid, as seen in North Carolina and California.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Substance abuse programming ==
{{See also|Restorative justice}}
Traditionally, the most common treatment for [[substance abuse]] stems from a medical model, which views addiction disease. This model sees disease of addiction as being rooted solely in the individual. Relatively recent research suggests that addiction can be best understood holistically, as evident in the more recent programming that focus on other aspects of the individual. Currently, most female correctional facilities contain a range of evidence-based programming for substance abuse that have been shown to both reduce recidivism, and promote positive social behavior. Most of the substance abuse programs are largely funded by organizations such as CSAT. In addition to residential TCs, prison-based substance abuse programming may include detoxification units, inpatient drug treatment, outpatient treatment or counseling, self-help group/peer counseling, education/awareness, or maintenance program.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Volunteering professionals across several disciplines often run these programs, since effective gender-responsive programming should address substance abuse holistically.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; While there has been an increase in the number of substance abuse treatment options, research regarding their effectiveness has reduced since the late 1990s. The outcome evaluations that come during the early 2000s focus primarily on programming elements that contribute to high levels of effectiveness. For example, a 2001 study of treatment investigated the effectiveness of receiving treatment (versus not receiving treatment), group type (mixed versus female only), and the type of women's treatment (enhanced vs standard).&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prendergast|first=Michael|last2=Hall|first2=Elizabeth A.|last3=Wellisch|first3=Jean|title=Outcome Evaluation of the Forever Free Residential Substance Abuse Treatment (RSAT) Program at the California Institution for Women, 1997-2000|url=http://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR03442.v1|journal=ICPSR Data Holdings|doi=10.3886/icpsr03442.v1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional development/employment ==

=== Vocational Training ===
[[Vocational education|Vocational training]] covers a wide range of occupations including trade skills such as auto mechanics, and electrical work or other occupational skills such as culinary arts, warehousing, and other hands-on work experience.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Nonetheless, there tends to be far less vocational training programs in women's facilities compared to male facilities, even though women are more likely to take advantage of such programs.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Vocational training programs currently provided in female correctional facilities are much like those seen throughout the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richmond|first=Kerry M.|date=2014-07-04|title=The Impact of Federal Prison Industries Employment on the Recidivism Outcomes of Female Inmates|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07418825.2012.668924|journal=Justice Quarterly|volume=31|issue=4|pages=719–745|doi=10.1080/07418825.2012.668924|issn=0741-8825}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are gender-stereotyped and lower-skill opportunities such as sewing, clerical work, food services, and cosmetology.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zaitzow|first=Barbara|date=2006|title=Empowerment not Entrapment: Providing Opportunities for Incarcerated Women to Move Beyond 'Doing Time'|url=http://www.cjcj.org/uploads/cjcj/documents/empowerment_not.pdf|journal=Justice Policy Journal|volume=3|issue=1|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The use of these types of vocational programs has been described as ironic since some state legislatures prohibit ex-offenders from entering such fields. In 2003, at least six states had barred ex-offenders from public employment, prohibiting them opportunities in approximately 350 higher-skilled occupations, thus restricting women to low-paying jobs upon reentry.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.nicic.gov/Library/024662.pdf|title=Employment and female offenders: An update of the empirical research|last=Flower|first=Shawn|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice, National Institute of Corrections|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By far, vocational training and work assignments have ranked highest among women's priorities. Due to limitations and high demands of these programs, enrollment is quite difficult.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In some cases, the waitlists tend to be longer than the number of students. In one survey conducted in 1995, vocational was identified as a top priority, but only 14 to 28 percent of women were actually enrolled. Furthermore, the educational eligibility requirements for vocational training tend to result in underutilization of programs since some require higher levels of education.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; For example, a business program at a New Hampshire women's facility in the 1990s was inaccessible since most women lacked the educational requirements.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Additionally, access to stable employment is often compounded by the fact that newly released women have limited access to adequate transportation and resources, which reduces the likelihood of long-term employment.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The existence of vocational program is not enough to recidivism; the quality of the program, and the need for that occupation must also be taken into account.  More specifically, the program must train women in widely available fields experiencing shortages, and must in an area that will provide a living wage. For example, a temporary plumbing maintenance program was implemented throughout correctional facilities in New York State during the early 2000s, a time where plumbers were of relatively high demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Diane S.|last2=Mattucci|first2=Robert F.|date=2006-01-01|title=Enhancing the Vocational Skills of Incarcerated Women Through a Plumbing Maintenance Program|jstor=23282704|journal=Journal of Correctional Education|volume=57|issue=2|pages=126–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the strongest indicators of stable employment is education. Studies of women in state correctional facilities reveal a positive relationship between educational level and probability of employment.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Furthermore, higher education has been shown to increase self-esteem. The high regard for post-secondary is not reflected in prison programming. Over 90 percent of state prisons provide educational programs that focus on GED preparation and adult basic education, but only a few prisons offer programming in post-secondary education.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Furthermore, participation in educational programs is relatively lower than participation in vocational training, and work assignments. The challenge to complete coursework appears specifically when competing with participation in paid work assignments. In a comparative study of women's participation in programming, less than half, 34 percent of women participated in educational programming, while 70 percent of women had work assignments.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Postsecondary Education ===
[[Prison education|College education]] is becoming increasingly important for advancement in the labor market. Consequently, more focus is being placed on higher education in correctional facilities.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Some prisons have developed relationships with local community colleges to form postsecondary correctional education (PSCE) programs. Such programs allow individuals to take credited (or non-credited) college level courses. Through funding, these programs are offered at discounted rates, or at no cost to the inmate. The programs vary in length, eligibility requirements, eligibility, course type, and program structure.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vera.org/sites/default/files/overview-pathways-v2.pdf |title=Pathways from Prison to Postsecondary Education Project |date= |website= |publisher=Center Sentencing and Corrections |access-date=2016-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629232044/http://www.vera.org/sites/default/files/overview-pathways-v2.pdf |archivedate=2016-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hemba people''' (or ''Eastern Luba'') are an ethnic group in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC).

==History==
[[File:Hemba Stuhl Museum Rietberg RAC 126.jpg|thumb|240px|Hemba carved stool]]

The [[Hemba language]] belongs to a group of related languages spoken by people in a belt that runs from southern [[Kasai region|Kasai]] to northeastern [[Zambia]]. Other peoples speaking related languages include the [[Luba people|Luba]] of Kasai and Shaba, the [[Kanyok people|Kanyok]], [[Songye people|Songye]], Kaonde, Sanga, Bemba and the people of Kazembe.{{sfn|Reefe|1981|p=74}}
Today the Hemba people live in the north of [[Zambia]], and their language is understood throughout Zambia. Some also live in [[Tanzania]]. They live west of [[Lake Tanganyika]] and [[Lake Mweru]] in the DRC, and their villages are found several hundred miles up the [[Lualaba River]].{{sfn|Olson|1996|pp=223-224}}

The Hemba people migrated eastward to the Lualaba valley from the Luba empire, probably some time after 1600.{{sfn|Mukenge|2002|p=16}}
They traded salt for iron hoes made in the Luba heartland, and wore raphia cloth that came by way of the Luba from the Songye people further to the west.{{sfn|Reefe|1981|p=98}}
At the time of the eastward expansion of the [[Luba Kingdom]] under King [[Ilunga Sungu]] around 1800, Hemba people were living in a territory bounded by the [[Lukuga River]] in the north, the [[Luvua River]] in the south and the [[Lualaba River]] to the west.{{sfn|Reefe|1981|p=124}}
The lower Lukuga and the Lualaba provided natural lines of communication, and the river valleys were densely populated.{{sfn|Reefe|1981|p=131}}

During Ilunga Sungu's rule the southern Hemba became tributaries to the Luba.
They were headed by a "fire king", who symbolically represented the Luba king.{{sfn|Reefe|1981|p=127}}
The Hemba fire kingdom cut its links to the Luba empire after Ilunga Sungu died.
His successor, Kumwimbe Ngombe, had to fight several campaigns to recover the eastern territories.{{sfn|Macola|2002|p=108}}
Kumwimbe created a client state that united the Hemba villages of the [[Lukushi River]] valley, and that played an important role in preserving Luba dominance over other small states in the region.{{sfn|Reefe|1981|p=137}}
Later the Hemba regained their independence, but were subject to attacks by Arab slave traders in the later part of the nineteenth century, and then to colonization by the Belgians.{{sfn|Hemba Information}}

==Culture==

The Hemba people live in villages, recognizing chiefs as their political leaders.
A chief will be the head of an extended family of landowners, inheriting his title through the maternal line.{{sfn|Hemba Information}}
Hemba people may also belong to secret societies such as the Bukazanzi for men and Bukibilo for women.{{sfn|Tribal African Art}}
The So'o secret society is guarded by the beautifully carved mask of a chimpanzee, which is used in rituals that relate to the ancestral spirits.{{sfn|Alesha|2004|p=52}}
These societies serve to offset the power of the chief.{{sfn|Tribal African Art}}

Although the [[Luba people]] failed to keep the southern Hemba in their kingdom they did have considerable cultural influence.
Art forms, including wooden sculptures representing ancestors, are similar in style to Luba sculptures.
The Hemba religion recognizes a creator god and a separate supreme being.
The Hemba make sacrifices and present offerings at the shrines of ancestors. When social harmony has been upset, religious leaders may demand offerings to the specific ancestors that have become displeased and are causing the trouble.{{sfn|Hemba Information}}
Each clan owns a ''kabeja'', a statuette with one body and two faces, male and female, on one neck.
Sacrifices are made to the ''kabeja'', which will convey them to the spirits. A receptacle on the top of the ''kabeja'' is used to receive magic incredients. A ''kabeja'' is dangerous to handle.{{sfn|Tribal African Art}}

==Economy==

The villagers live by subsistence agriculture, growing manioc, maize, peanuts, and yams.
They also hunt and fish to a small extent to supplement their diet.
Cash is obtained through panning alluvial copper from the streams.{{sfn|Hemba Information}}
Many Hemba men are also employed as miners in the copperbelt.{{sfn|Olson|1996|p=224}}

==Gallery of Hemba artwork==
The Hemba artistic tradition is well known. Subjects include ancestral figures, spirits, human faces and ceremonial masks.{{sfn|Mukenge|2002|p=76}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4539">'''Heterogeneous medical condition''' in medicine are those [[medical condition]]s which have several [[etiologies]], like [[hepatitis]] or [[diabetes]]. Medical conditions are normally defined pathologically (liver inflammation) or clinically (excessive urination) and not etiologically, and therefore it is normal to have more than one cause for them. The word is used as an opposition to [[homogeneous]], meaning that given a group of patients, the disease is the same for all of them.

When a condition is heterogeneous, it is normally divided in [[endotype]]s.

==Endotype==
{{main|endotype}}
An '''endotype''' is a subtype of a condition, which is defined by a distinct functional or [[Pathobiology|pathobiological]] mechanism. This is distinct from a [[Phenotype (clinical medicine)|phenotype]], which is any observable characteristic or trait of a [[disease]], such as [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], development, biochemical or physiological properties, or behavior, without any implication of a mechanism. It is envisaged that [[patient]]s with a specific endotype present themselves within phenotypic clusters of diseases.

One example is asthma, which is considered to be a [[syndrome]], consisting of a series of endotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lötvall |first1=Jan |last2=Akdis |first2=Cezmi A. |last3=Bacharier |first3=Leonard B. |last4=Bjermer |first4=Leif |last5=Casale |first5=Thomas B. |last6=Custovic |first6=Adnan |last7=Lemanske Jr. |first7=Robert F. |last8=Wardlaw |first8=Andrew J. |last9=Wenzel |first9=Sally E. |last10=Greenberger |first10=Paul A. |title=Asthma endotypes: A new approach to classification of disease entities within the asthma syndrome |journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology |date=February 2011 |volume=127 |issue=2 |pages=355–360 |doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2010.11.037 |pmid=21281866}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is related to the concept of [[disease entity]]

==Heterogeneity in medical conditions==

The term '''medical condition''' is a [[nosology|nosological]] broad term that includes all diseases, disorders, injuries and [[syndrome]]s, and it is specially suitable in the last case, in which it is not possible to speak about a single disease associated to the clinical course of the patient.

While the term ''medical condition'' generally includes mental illnesses, in some contexts the term is used specifically to denote any illness, injury, or disease except for mental illnesses. The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM), the widely used psychiatric manual that defines all [[mental disorder]]s, uses the term ''general medical condition'' to refer to all diseases, illnesses, and injuries except for [[mental disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |year=2000 |title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders |edition=4th |location=Washington, DC |author=American Psychiatric Association. Task Force on DSM-IV |isbn=978-0-89042-025-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This usage is also commonly seen in the psychiatric literature. Some [[health insurance]] policies also define a ''medical condition'' as any illness, injury, or disease except for psychiatric illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theinsurancepage.co.uk/expat-insurance-glossary.html |title=Expat Insurance Glossary by The Insurance Page |accessdate=2008-11-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027142342/http://www.theinsurancepage.co.uk/expat-insurance-glossary.html |archivedate=2008-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As it is more [[value-neutral]] than terms like ''disease'', the term ''medical condition'' is sometimes preferred by people with health issues that they do not consider deleterious. It is also preferred when etiology is not unique, because the word disease is normally associated to the cause of the clinical problems. On the other hand, by emphasizing the medical nature of the condition, this term is sometimes rejected, such as by proponents of the [[autism rights movement]].

The term is also used in specialized areas of the medicine. A genetic or allelic heterogeneous condition is one where the same disease or condition can be caused, or contributed to, by varying different genes or alleles. In clinical trials and statistics the concepts of homogeneous and heterogeneous populations is important. The same applies for [[epidemiology]]

'''Indians in Korea''' consist of migrants from [[India]] to [[Korea]] and their locally born descendants. A majority of them live in [[Seoul]] while there are smaller populations living in other parts of Korea.

==History==

According to the 11th century legendary chronicle [[Samguk Yusa]], [[Heo Hwang-ok]], the consort of [[Suro of Geumgwan Gaya]] was originally a princess from a kingdom called Ayuta. In the 20th century, Kim Byung-Mo, an anthropologist from the Hanyang University, identified Ayuta with [[Ayodhya]] in India based on phonetic similarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Choong Soon Kim |title=Voices of Foreign Brides: The Roots and Development of Multiculturalism in Korea |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b43pR3Z8zTcC&amp;pg=PA34 |year=2011 |publisher=AltaMira |isbn=978-0-7591-2037-2 |page=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heo Hwang-ok is considered an ancestor by several Korean lineages, which has led to Korean interest in Ayodhya, resulting in the construction of a [[Memorial of Heo Hwang-ok, Ayodhya|Memorial of Heo Hwang-ok]] there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1205728.stm Korean memorial to Indian princess], 6 March 2001, [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.koreatimes.co.kr/phone/news/view.jsp?req_newsidx=219704 Legacy of Queen Suriratna], 6 Dec. 2016, [[The Korea Times]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Korean War===
{{Main|Parachute Regiment (India)}}
The [[Indian army]] provided a medical unit to attend the sick and wounded in the [[Korean War]]. With the communist invasion of South Korea in 1950, the UN sent out a call to the free world for assistance. India decided not to get involved militarily but contributed a medical unit, the 60 Parachute Field Ambulance which served in Korea for a total of three and a half years (Nov 1950- May 1954), the longest single tenure by any military unit under the UN flag.
 
They were involved in providing medical cover alternately to the US Army/ROK forces and the Commonwealth Division under the UN Command as well as the local civilians, and earned a very well-deserved title, "The Maroon Angels". The unit also looked after the [[North Korea]]n POWs. The highlight of the tenure undoubtedly was when the unit provided an ADS and a surgical team (7 officers and 5 Other ranks) during [[Operation Tomahawk]], an airborne operation launched on 21 March 1951 by the US Army’s 187 Airborne Regimental Combat Team.

Towards the end of the Korean War in 1953, a reinforced [[brigade]] known as the Custodian Force of India was deployed for the repatriation of the prisoners of war and was deployed for almost two years (1953–54).

===After the Division of Korea===
[[South Korea]] has been gaining popularity among Indian expatriates. Since the 1970s, many Indians have been coming to the South Korea and now there are about 7,006 Indians as per International Migration Report, living and working in the country.

According to officials of the Indian mission in South Korea, over 1,000 engineers and software professionals have recently come to South Korea, working for large conglomerates such as [[LG]], [[Hyundai]] and [[Samsung]],  which have today become household names back in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biztechreport.com/story/446-more-indian-techies-south-korea''More Indian Techies in South Korea''.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deccanherald.com/content/111803/it-professionals-dominate-indian-diaspora.html''IT professionals dominate Indian diaspora in South Korea''.]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also around 125 Indian scientists and post-doctoral research scholars working or conducting research at various institutions in the country. Indian companies are also making inroads in South Korea. The agreement between Indian and South Korea on IT will leverage the IT software capabilities of India and IT hardware capabilities of South Korea, resulting in an increased flow of IT professionals between the two countries.

==Skilled IT Professionals and Researchers==
Recently there has been influx of many skilled IT professionals and researchers due to investment in emerging technologies by major companies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-elec-research-centre/samsung-electronics-to-set-up-ai-research-center-idUSKBN1DM0QN

"Samsung tops at IIT campus placements while Microsoft dips in its hiring numbers".]&lt;/ref&gt; South Korean companies are now keen to employ Indian engineers from IITs and are offering them salaries that are impressive even by western standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstpost.com/business/samsung-places-10-iit-b-students-in-s-korea-for-rs-90-lakh-bonus-free-indian-food-1993589.html "Samsung places 10 IIT-B students in S Korea for 150,000 USD".]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://m.gadgetsnow.com/jobs/IIT-placements-Google-Samsung-offer-top-salaries/articleshow/17442348.cms"IIT placements: Google, Samsung offer top salaries".]&lt;/ref&gt; The companies are also extending support for free housing and food.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstpost.com/business/samsung-places-10-iit-b-students-in-s-korea-for-rs-90-lakh-bonus-free-indian-food-1993589.html "Samsung places 10 IIT-B students in S Korea for 150,000 USD".]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisations and associations==
Some of Indian associations in South Korea include "IndiansInKorea" (also known as IIK) with more than 5000 members (www.indiansinkorea.com), the "Indian Association of Korea" with mainly professionals as members, and the "Annapurna Indian Women's Association".

An '''Italian Peruvian''' is a [[Peru]]vian citizen of [[Italian people|Italian descent]]. The phrase may refer to someone born in [[Peru]] of Italian descent or to someone who has immigrated to Peru from [[Italy]]. Among [[European Peruvian]]s, Italians were the second largest group of immigrants to settle in the country.

==History==
Between 1532 and 1560, 50 Italians established in [[Lima]] (Viceroyalty of Peru) and [[Callao]], mostly from [[Liguria]] and [[Tuscany]], such as Martin from [[Florence]], Pietro Catagno, Pietro Martín from [[Sicily]] (all of them involved in Atahualpa's capture), [[Juan Bautista Pastene]], born in [[Genoa]] in 1505 and also present since the beginning of the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Spanish Conquest of the Inca Empire]]. It is worthy to say that, in 1584, the first printing press was brought to the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] by an Italian named ''Antonio Ricciardi Pedemontanus''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Radicati di Primeglio has done an exhaustive research about Italians in Lima and he found the well-documented existence of 343 Italians in Lima between 1532 and 1650 (this number can vary because many Italians were not registered). From these 343 Italians: 124 were from [[Genoa]], 28 from [[Venice]], 28 from [[Corsica]], 15 from [[Naples]], 11 from [[Milan]], 10 from [[Rome]], 5 from [[Sicily]] and the rest from other Italian states. Italians from [[Genoa]] used to work in the transport of passengers and merchandises between [[Callao]] and other Viceroyalty harbors to Panama. We can mention to Captains Giustiniani y Vicenzo Pascuale, who founded many navigation and trade enterprises between Callao and Valparaiso; Giovanni di Malta, Nicolo da Bonifilio, Alvaro Pastrello, Giovanni Gaetano; Enrique Porri from [[Milan]], Lucas de Astra from [[Genoa]]; Nicoroso y Marcos Corso, captain Alessandro Malaspina.

There were also marines from [[Venice]] and from the [[Aegean Islands]], like Pedro from [[Heraklion] AKA Crete] and Francisco from [[Cyprus]] (these places were under the Venetian dominion from 1204 to 1669); Anello Oliva, Ludovico Bertonio, Francesco Carletti, and the Prince of Santo Buono and Viceroy of Peru; Carmine Nicolao Caracciolo, born in [[Naples]] and Dr. Federico Bottoni who published a treaty about sanguineous circulation, in 1723.

During the last decades of Spanish dominion in Perú, the number of Italians in Peru grew faster than in previous centuries (most of them came from [[Genoa]]). The richest ones were related to the marine commerce while the rest of Italians worked at small family-run business (such as grocery stores) or in larger enterprises along with their fellow Italians, as they were relatively skilled. [[Image:Chucuito callao.jpg|thumb|right|250px| While most [[Italians]] settled in the main cities, a group of [[Sicily#Demographics|Sicilian]] and [[Genovese]] fishers established in Chucuito, [[Callao]]]] The pioneers of the Italian immigration to Peru were Antonio Dagnino, who established in Callao in 1802 and Felix Valega, who arrived, in 1806. The same ship brought to the musician Andrea Bolognesi, father of the Peruvian National Hero "[[Francisco Bolognesi]]".

The first wave of Italian immigration to Peru occurred during the period 1840–1866 (the "Guano" Era): not less than 15,000 Italians arrived to Peru during this period (without counting the non-registered Italians) and established mainly in the coastal cities, especially, in [[Lima]] and [[Callao]]. They came, mostly, from the northern states ([[Liguria]], [[Piedmont]], [[Tuscany]] and [[Lombardy]]). [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] arrived to Peru in 1851, as well as other Italians who participated in the [[Five Days of Milan|Milan rebellion]] like Giuseppe Eboli, Steban Siccoli, [[Antonio Raimondi]], Arrigoni, etc.

In 1872, the ''Sociedad de Inmigración Europea'' ("European Immigration Society") was founded in Peru. Its objective was promoting [[Old World]] [[immigration]] by covering the costs of their journeys and financially supporting them during their first settler years in Peru. Furthermore, many Italians came in search for a better future, upon the arrival they established themselves in small business.

During the second world war waves of Italian families started to immigrate to Peru; these families mainly settled in Lima. (Godbersen, 2006)

Many Italian Peruvians intermarried and many Italian Peruvian families are related. Most Italian Peruvians live in the metropolitan area of Lima and the coastal cities. The Peruvian cuisine has been largely influenced by the Italian cuisine. In Chanchamayo there is an Italian colony in the Province of La Merced, founded by Italian immigrants.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

[[Image:Gitega_drums.JPG|thumb|Drums from [[Gitega]], Burundi]]

The '''''karyenda''''' is a traditional [[African music|African]] [[drum]]. It was the main symbol of [[Burundi]] and its ''[[mwami]]'' (kings) and had semi-divine status. The ''mwami'' was said to interpret the beatings of the karyenda into rules for the [[Kingdom of Burundi|kingdom]].

== History ==
[[File:Flag_of_Burundi_(1962-1966).svg|thumb|Flag of the Kingdom of Burundi with a ''karyenda'' in the middle.]]
[[File:La maison des tambours.jpg|thumb|upright|A house of drums]]
[[File:Burundian drummers Bujumbura 2008.JPG|thumb|Traditional Burundian drummers]]

When Burundi gained independence from [[Belgium]] in 1962, the karyenda was the symbol on the [[Flag of Burundi|national flag]] and its [[Coat of arms of Burundi|coat of arms]] from 1962 to 1966.&lt;ref&gt;''Guide to the Flags of the World'' by Mauro Talocci, revised and updated by Whitney Smith ({{ISBN|0-688-01141-1}}), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; It was replaced after the republic was established. Traditionally the most important folk songs and dances were performed to extol the virtues of the kingship. A major festival was the annual ''[[umuganuro]]'' ([[sorghum]] festival), which was a huge display of pomp, festivities, and dances for the royal court. Since the fall of the monarchy in 1966, and particularly after a massacre of [[Hutu]]s in 1972, such cultural expressions have waned. 

The second most important drum was the ''[[rukinzo]]''. It accompanied the ''mwami'' wherever he went.

The drums, despite many upheavals, have remained popular and are still revered. The old families who were wardens of the drums have tried to keep the ancient traditions alive. Some have an international outreach, such as the [[Royal Drummers of Burundi]], or L. Ndoricimpa and C. Guillet, who recorded ''[[Les tambours du Burundi]]'' (''The Drums of Burundi'') in 1983.

== Symbolism ==
As sacred objects, the drums were much more than simple musical instruments. They were used in rituals, such as the ''umuganuro'', or for special circumstances. Major events for the king, such as royal [[coronations]], [[funerals]], and [[weddings]] were announced through the drums. The beating of the drums also signalled certain rites, such as when the ''mwami'' rose in the morning or retired in the evening.

Drums had various names, such as "dispenser of peace" or "lady of the land".

The Royal Order of Karyenda and the Royal Order of Rukinzo were founded by King [[Mwambutsa IV of Burundi]] on July 1, 1962. The Order of Karyanda was the principal order of the kingdom and was divided into five classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.royalark.net/Burundi/burundi10.htm|title=BURUNDI|work=royalark.net|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Royal_Order_of_Karyenda.gif|title=English: Royal Order of Karyenda - Royal Female Drum (Kingdom of Burundi)|first=Antonio Prieto|last=Barrio|date=19 November 2015|publisher=|accessdate=12 April 2017|via=Wikimedia Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmedals.com/Order-of-Rukinzo-Knight-L25153.html|title=Order of Rukinzo Knight  :: Burundi :: World Medals and Decorations :: Liverpool Medals Ltd :: World Military Medals :: Medals for Sale|work=liverpoolmedals.com|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sanctuaries ==
The drums were normally kept in drum [[Sanctuary|sanctuaries]]. These were a tight network of high places, as well as centres of political and religious power in [[pre-colonial]] Burundi. The sanctuaries were guarded mainly by Hutu families, who were the only ones the king allowed to manufacture, play, and keep the drums or bring them to court for an occasion. They were called ''[[abatimbo]]'', which is [[Rundi language|Rundi]] for drummers "who hit hard". A sacred drum was enthroned in each sanctuary and guarded by attendants.  There were also ''[[ingendanyi]]'' (minor drums), and a set of drums that were played with the main drums.

Some of the main sanctuaries for the drums were: [[Gishora]] Hill, near [[Gitega]]; [[Higiro]] Hill, also near Gitega; [[Magamba]] Hill; and [[Banga, Burundi|Banga]].

'''''King of the Gypsies''''' is a 1978 American [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] by [[Paramount Pictures]] starring [[Eric Roberts]], [[Sterling Hayden]], [[Shelley Winters]], [[Susan Sarandon]], [[Brooke Shields]], [[Annette O'Toole]] and [[Judd Hirsch]].

[[film director|Directed]] by [[Frank Pierson]], the [[screenplay]] was [[film adaptation|adapted]] by Pierson from the 1975 book ''King of the Gypsies'' by [[Peter Maas]], which tells the story of Steve Tene and his [[Romani people|Romani]] (Gypsy) family.

Several [[technical advisor]]s, [[bit player]]s and [[extra (actor)|extras]] who worked on the movie were real gypsies. [[David Grisman]] composed the score, which prominently featured legendary jazz violinist [[Stephane Grappelli]]; both men also appeared onscreen as gypsy musicians. Future actress [[Rachel Ticotin]] was one of the gypsy dancers.

[[Eric Roberts]] was nominated for a 1979 [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] for "Best Motion Picture Acting Debut &amp;ndash; Male" for his [[performance]] as Dave.

==Plot summary==
The film deals with the criminal ways and turbulent lives of a group of modern-day Gypsies living in [[New York City]]. While on his deathbed their "king", Zharko Stepanowicz ([[Sterling Hayden]]), passes his position of leadership on to his unwilling grandson, Dave ([[Eric Roberts]]). In spite of Dave's reluctance to become the Gypsies' new leader, Dave's father, Groffo ([[Judd Hirsch]]), resentful over not having been appointed leader, attempts to have Dave killed. Gruff is scheming and temperamental, and uses violence and threats to get the clan to do his bidding. Eventually this leads to a major confrontation with his son, and the film ends with the suggestion that Dave has finally accepted his legacy; with his voiceover considering the possibility of his bringing the rest of the tradition-bound Gypsies into the world of 20th Century customs and lifestyles.

==Main cast==
*[[Eric Roberts]] as Dave Stepanowicz
*[[Sterling Hayden]] as King Zharko Stepanowicz 
*[[Judd Hirsch]] as Groffo Stepanowicz

==Production==
[[Peter Bogdanovich]] was originally announced as director.&lt;ref&gt;Briefs on the Arts: Monet Study Added To Met Exhibition Bogdanovich Signs For Gypsy Film Mrs. Ford to Aid Group for Dance
New York Times 25 Jan 1975: 13. &lt;/ref&gt;
==Additional notes==
Dave's sister, Tita, is played by [[Brooke Shields]], and his girlfriend, Sharon, is played by [[Annette O'Toole]]. This was the second consecutive film in which [[Susan Sarandon]] and [[Brooke Shields]] played mother and daughter, following ''[[Pretty Baby (film)|Pretty Baby]]''. Five and a half years after the release of the film,  on June 20, 1984, Shelley Winters and Annie Potts appeared as guests on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' starring  [[Johnny Carson]]. Miss Winters had no memory of working with Potts and the conversation brought the house down. A clip of this segment was replayed on several ''Tonight Show'' anniversary specials.

The casting director was future producer [[Scott Rudin]]; it is his first screen credit in any capacity.

'''''La Hermana del Hombre Bóveda''''' is a public artwork by [[Spain|Spanish]] artist [[Pablo Serrano]], located at the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] (IMA), which is near downtown [[Indianapolis]], [[U.S. state|Indiana]]. The artwork is an abstract bronze piece which tops a granite fountain.

==Description==
''La Hermana del Hombre Bóveda'' is an abstract, figural, cast bronze artwork.  The form wraps around a central cavity, which is the focal point when viewed from the front.  Jutting edges that look as though they were ripped or chopped face the front, surrounding the circular cavity and contrasting with its smooth, hollowed surface.  

The highly textured surface curves around the back to create a rounded form that evokes a woman’s backside. The texture is consistently applied, with sporadic scratches creating emphasis and texture throughout. The artwork was originally patinated a medium brown color, unevenly applied to emphasize texture and form. The highly polished central cavity originally had a bright, golden sheen – the natural color of the bronze.  The polished and patinated surfaces were intended to play off of each other; the edge of the polished circle was slightly feathered into the rich brown.&lt;ref name=Westerdahl&gt;{{cite book|last=Westerdahl|first=Eduardo|title=La Escultura De Pablo Serrano|year=1977|publisher=Ediciones Polígrafia|location=Barcelona}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The artwork is currently mounted on a granite base which is part of a fountain; the fountain rests on a limestone base.  The artwork is secured to the top of the fountain by means of a custom-made piece of steel which is hooked to the edges of the hollow bottom of the artwork.  This steel piece has fittings so that it and the bronze can be rotated and then lifted off of the fountain.  The bronze element itself weighs approximately 450&amp;nbsp;lbs.

===Identifying marks===
The artwork is signed at the bottom proper left edge “Serrano”.

==Historical information==
''La Hermana del Hombre Bóveda'' was hollow cast in a multi-part mold in Madrid in 1963.

===Location history===
''La Hermana'' was installed as the central attraction of one of the IMA's most prominent accessibility projects - the Garden for Everyone.  This garden made its debut in 1993, located at the east end of the Sutphin Mall in front of the museum.  It was designed specifically for people with disabilities, and it creates a full sensory experience with fragrant flowers, various textures of stone and landscaping, and a gentle fountain, upon which ''La Hermana'' rests.&lt;ref name="IMA-Garden"&gt;Indianapolis Museum of Art.

The '''Maya peoples''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|aɪ|ə}}) are a large group of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous peoples]] of [[Mesoamerica]]. They inhabit southern [[Mexico]], [[Guatemala]], [[Belize]], [[El Salvador]] and [[Honduras]]. The overarching term "Maya" is a collective designation to include the peoples of the region that share some degree of cultural and linguistic heritage; however, the term embraces many distinct populations, societies, and ethnic groups that each have their own particular traditions, cultures, and historical identity.

There were an estimated six million Maya living in this area at the start of the 21st century.&lt;ref name="total"&gt;{{cite book|language=es|author1=Lorenzo Ochoa|author2 = Patricia Martel(dir.)|title=Lengua y cultura mayas|publisher=UNAM|year=2002|isbn=9703200893|pages=170|	quote=''El "Pueblo Maya" lo constituyen actualmente algo menos de 6 millones de hablantes de 25 idiomas''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Guatemala]], [[Mexico|southern Mexico]] and the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], [[Belize]], [[El Salvador]], and western [[Honduras]] have managed to maintain numerous remnants of their ancient cultural heritage. Some are quite integrated into the majority [[hispanicized]] [[Mestizo]] cultures of the nations in which they reside, while others continue a more traditional, culturally distinct life, often speaking one of the [[Mayan languages]] as a primary [[language]].

The largest populations of contemporary Maya inhabit Guatemala, Belize, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador, as well as large segments of population within the [[Political divisions of Mexico|Mexican states]] of [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]], [[Campeche]], [[Quintana Roo]], [[Tabasco (state)|Tabasco]], and [[Chiapas]].

==Yucatec Maya==

{{Maya civilization}}
One of the largest groups of modern Maya can be found in Mexico's [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán State]] and the neighboring states of Campeche, Quintana Roo and in Belize. These peoples commonly identify themselves simply as "Maya" with no further ethnic subdivision (unlike in the Highlands of Western Guatemala). They speak the language which anthropologists term "[[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec Maya]]", but is identified by speakers and Yucatecos simply as "Maya". Among Maya speakers, Spanish is commonly spoken as a second or first language.

There is a significant amount of confusion as to the correct terminology to use—Maya or Mayan—and the meaning of these words with reference to contemporary or pre-Columbian peoples, to Maya peoples in different parts of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and to languages or peoples.

Linguists refer to the Maya language as Yucatec or Yucatec Maya to distinguish it from other [[Mayan languages]]. This norm has often been misinterpreted to mean that the people are also called Yucatec Maya; that term refers only to the language, and the correct name for the people is simply Maya (not Mayans). Maya is one language in the Mayan language family. Thus, to refer to Maya as Mayans would be similar to referring to Spanish people as Romantics because they speak a language belonging to the Romance language family.{{huh?|date=November 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=OSEA|first=Open School of Ethnography and Anthropology|title=Maya or Mayans?

Persons use a strategy of ethnic identification that Juan Castillo Cocom refers to as "ethnoexodus"—meaning that ethnic self-identification as Maya is quite variable, situational, and articulated not to processes of producing group identity, but of escaping from discriminatory processes of sociocultural marginalization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i09.cgpublisher.com/proposals/330/index_html Ethnoexodus: Maya Topographic Ruptures].

The Yucatán's indigenous population was first exposed to Europeans after a party of Spanish shipwreck survivors came ashore in 1511. One of the sailors, [[Gonzalo Guerrero]], is reported to have taken up with a local woman and started a family; he became a counselor among a local polity near present-day [[Chetumal]]. Later Spanish expeditions to the region were led by [[Francisco Hernández de Córdoba (discoverer of Yucatán)|Córdoba]] in 1517, [[Juan de Grijalva|Grijalva]] in 1518, and [[Hernán Cortés|Cortés]] in 1519. From 1528 to 1540, several attempts by [[Francisco de Montejo|Francisco Montejo]] to conquer the Yucatán failed. His son, Francisco de Montejo the Younger, fared almost as badly when he first took over: while desperately holding out at Chichen Itza, he lost 150 men in a single day.&lt;ref name="ambconq"&gt;[[Inga Clendinnen|Clendinnen, Inga]] (1989) ''Ambivalent Conquests: Maya and Spaniard in Yucatán, 1517–1570''. p. 34. {{ISBN|0-521-37981-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; European diseases, massive recruitment of native warriors from Campeche and Champoton, and internal hatred between the Xiu Maya and the lords of Cocom eventually turned the tide for Montejo the Younger. [[Chichen Itza]] was conquered by 1570.&lt;ref name="ambconq" /&gt; In 1542, the western Yucatán Peninsula also surrendered to him.

[[File:Chichen Itza 3.jpg|thumb|left|Chichen Itza's [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|''El Castillo'']]]]
Historically, the population in the eastern half of the peninsula was less affected by and less integrated with Hispanic culture than the western half. In the 21st century in the Yucatán Peninsula (Mexican states of Campeche, Yucatán and Quintana Roo), between 750,000 and 1,200,000 people speak Mayan. However, three times more than that are of Maya origins, hold ancient Maya surnames, and do not speak Mayan languages as their first language.

[[Matthew Restall]], in his book ''The Maya Conquistador'',&lt;ref&gt;Restall, Matthew (1998). ''Maya Conquistador''. Boston, Massachusetts: Beacon. pp. xvi, 254.&lt;/ref&gt; mentions a series of letters sent to the King of Spain in the 16th and 17th centuries. The [[Nobility|noble]] Maya families at that time signed documents to the Spanish Royal Family; surnames mentioned in those letters are Pech, Camal, Xiu, Ucan, Canul, Cocom, and Tun, among others.

A large 19th-century revolt by the native Maya people of Yucatán (Mexico), known as the [[Caste War of Yucatán]], was one of the most successful modern Native American revolts.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Nelson (2002) ''The Caste War of Yucatán'': Stanford University Press, {{ISBN|0-8047-4001-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a period the Maya state of [[Chan Santa Cruz]] was recognized as an independent nation by the [[British Empire]], particularly in terms of trading with British Honduras.

[[File:Dr Luna Kan (2010).jpg|thumb|left|[[Francisco Luna Kan|Dr. Francisco Luna Kan]] is a Maya having the very common surname "Kan"]]
[[Francisco Epigmenio Luna Kan|Francisco Luna-Kan]] was elected [[Governor of Yucatán|governor]] of the state of Yucatán from 1976 to 1982. Luna-Kan was born in [[Mérida, Yucatán]], and he was a Doctor of medicine, then a Professor of Medicine before his political offices. He was first appointed as overseer of the state's rural medical system. He was the first Governor of the modern [[Yucatán Peninsula]] to be of full Maya ancestry. In the early 21st century, dozens of politicians, including Deputies, Majors and Senators, are of full or mixed Maya heritage from the Yucatán Peninsula.

According to the National Institute of Geography and Informatics (Mexico's [[INEGI]]), in Yucatán State there were 1.2 million Mayan speakers in 2009, representing 59.5% of the inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130221080003/http://www.el-universal.com.mx/articulos/52903.html El Universal, el periódico de México líder en noticias y clasificados].

==Chiapas==
[[File:Chiapas-Maya.gif|thumb|right|Maya populations in Chiapas. The area officially assigned to the [[Lacandon Community]] is the [[Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve]], which partly overlaps with the [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltal]], [[Tojolabal people|Tojolabal]] and [[Ch'ol people|Ch'ol]] areas]]
[[Chiapas]] was for many years one of the regions of Mexico that was least touched by the reforms of the [[Mexican Revolution]]. The [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]], launched a rebellion against the Mexican state, Chiapas in January 1994, declared itself to be an [[Indigenous people of the Americas|indigenous]] movement and drew its strongest and earliest support from Chiapan Maya. Today its number of supporters is relevant. (see also the [[EZLN]] and the [[Chiapas conflict]])

Maya groups in Chiapas include the [[Tzotzil people|Tzotzil]] and [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltal]], in the highlands of the state, the [[Tojolabal]]is concentrated in the lowlands around [[Las Margaritas, Chiapas|Las Margaritas]], and the [[Ch'ol people|Ch'ol]] in the jungle. (see map)

The most traditional of Maya groups are the [[Lacandon people|Lacandon]], a small population avoiding contact with outsiders until the late 20th century by living in small groups in the [[Lacandon Jungle]]. These Lacandon Maya came from the Campeche/Petén area (north-east of [[Chiapas]]) and moved into the Lacandon rain-forest at the end of the 18th century.

In the course of the 20th century, and increasingly in the 1950s and 1960s, other people (mainly the Maya and subsistence peasants from the highlands), also entered into the Lacandon region; initially encouraged by the government. This immigration led to land-related conflicts and an increasing pressure on the [[rainforest]]. To halt the migration, the government decided in 1971 to declare a large part of the forest (614,000 hectares, or 6140&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) a protected area: the [[Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve]]. They appointed only one small population group (the 66 Lacandon families) as tenants (thus creating the Lacandon Community), thereby displacing 2000 Tzeltal and Ch'ol families from 26 communities, and leaving non-Lacandon communities dependent on the government for granting their rights to land. In the decades that followed the government carried out numerous programs to keep the problems in the region under control, using land distribution as a political tool; as a way of ensuring loyalty from different campesino groups. This strategy of [[divide and rule]] led to great disaffection and tensions among population groups in the region.&lt;br /&gt;
(see also the [[Chiapas conflict]] and the [[Lacandon Jungle]]).

==Belize==
{{Expand section|date=January 2012}}
The Maya population in [[Belize]] is concentrated in the [[Corozal District|Corozal]],  [[Cayo District|Cayo]], [[Toledo District|Toledo]] and [[Orange Walk District|Orange Walk]] districts, but they are scattered throughout the country. The Maya are thought to have been in Belize and the Yucatán region since the second millennium BC. Much of Belize's original Maya population died as a result of new infectious diseases and conflicts between tribes and with Europeans. They are divided into the [[Yucatec]], [[Q'eqchi' people|Kekchi]], and [[Mopan people|Mopan]]. These three Maya groups now inhabit the country.

The Yucatec Maya (many of whom came from Yucatán, Mexico to escape the Caste War of the 1840s) there have been evidence of several Yucatec Maya groups living by the Yalbac area of Belize and in the Orange Walk district near the present day Lamanai at the time the British reach. The Mopan (indigenous to Belize but were forced out by the British; they returned from Guatemala to evade slavery in the 19th century), and Kek'Chi (also fled from slavery in Guatemala in the 19th century). The later groups are chiefly found in the Toledo District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jesuitarchives.org/belize-mission-collection|title=Belize Mission Collection|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tabasco==

The Mexican state of [[Tabasco]] is home to the [[Chontal Maya people|Chontal Maya]].

==Guatemala==
[[File:Nebaj.JPG|thumb|Ixil women in Nebaj, Guatemala.]]
In [[Guatemala]], indigenous people of Maya descent comprise around 40% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.gob.gt/np/generoypueblos/documentos/Perfil+Estadistcio+final.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113153907/http://www.ine.gob.gt/np/generoypueblos/documentos/Perfil%20Estadistcio%20final.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=13 November 2011|title=Wayback Machine|date=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest and most traditional Maya populations are in the western highlands in the departments of [[Baja Verapaz]], [[Quiché Department|Quiché]], [[Totonicapán Department|Totonicapán]], [[Huehuetenango Department|Huehuetenango]], [[Quetzaltenango Department|Quetzaltenango]], and [[San Marcos Department|San Marcos]]; their inhabitants are mostly Maya.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060831075207/http://www.inforpressca.com/municipal/mapas_web/guatemala.php Republica de Guatemala]. inforpressca.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maya people of the Guatemala highlands include the [[Achi people|Achi]], [[Akatek people|Akatek]], [[Chuj people|Chuj]], [[Ixil people|Ixil]], [[Jakaltek people|Jakaltek]], [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]], [[K'iche' people|K'iche']], [[Mam people|Mam]], [[Poqomam people|Poqomam]], [[Poqomchi']], [[Q'anjob'al people|Q'anjob'al]], [[Q'eqchi' people|Q'eqchi']], [[Tz'utujil people|Tz'utujil]] and [[Uspantek people|Uspantek]].

The Q'eqchi' live in lowland areas of Alta Vera Paz, Peten, and Western Belize. Over the course of the succeeding centuries a series of land displacements, re-settlements, persecutions and migrations resulted in a wider dispersal of Q'eqchi' communities, into other regions of Guatemala (Izabal, Petén, El Quiché). They are the 2nd largest ethnic Maya group in Guatemala (after the [[K'iche' people|K'iche']]) and one of the largest and most widespread throughout Central America.

In Guatemala, the Spanish colonial pattern of keeping the native population legally separate and subservient continued well into the 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} This resulted in many traditional customs being retained, as the only other option than traditional Maya life open to most Maya was entering the Hispanic culture at the very bottom rung. Because of this many Guatemalan Maya, especially women, continue to wear traditional clothing, that varies according to their specific local identity.

The southeastern region of Guatemala (bordering with [[Honduras]]) includes groups such as the [[Ch'orti' people|Ch'orti']]. The northern lowland Petén region includes the [[Itza]], whose language is near extinction but whose agro-forestry practices, including use of dietary and medicinal plants may still tell us much about pre-colonial management of the Maya lowlands.&lt;ref&gt;Atran, Scott; Lois, Ximena; Ucan Ek', Edilberto (2004) ''Plants of the Peten Itza Maya'', Memoirs of the Museum of Anthropology, University of Michigan, 38&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genocide in Guatemala ===
{{main|Guatemalan genocide}}
The 36 year long [[Guatemalan Civil War]] left more than 200,000 people dead, half a million driven from their homes, and at least 100,000 women raped; most of the victims were Maya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brett|first=R.L.|year=2016|title=The Origins and Dynamics of Genocide:Political Violence in Guatemala|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-12-29/why-you-need-know-about-guatemalas-civil-war|title=Why you need to know about Guatemala's civil war|work=Public Radio International|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genocide against Mayan people took place throughout the whole civil war because indigenous people were seen as supporting the leftist guerillas, but most acts against humanity occurred during [[Efraín Ríos Montt]]'s presidency (1982-1983). Ríos Montt instituted a campaign of state terror intended to destroy the Mayas in the name of countering “communist subversion” and ridding the country of its indigenous culture. This was also known as Operation Sofia. Within Operation Sofia, the military followed through with [[Scorched earth|"scorched earth policies"]] which allowed them to destroy whole villages, including killing livestock, destroying cultural symbols, destroying crops, and murdering civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB297/index.htm|title=Operation Sofia: Documenting Genocide in Guatemala|website=nsarchive2.gwu.edu|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas, government forces killed about 40% of the total population; the campaign destroyed at least 626 Mayan villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hmh.org/la_Genocide_Guatemala.shtml|title=Genocide in Guatemala|website=www.hmh.org|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maya people are known for their brightly colored, [[yarn]]-based, [[textiles]] that are woven into capes, shirts, blouses, [[huipil]]es and dresses. Each village has its own distinctive pattern, making it possible to distinguish a person's home town. Women's clothing consists of a shirt and a long skirt.

The Maya religion is [[Roman Catholicism]] combined with the indigenous [[Maya religion]] to form the unique syncretic religion which prevailed throughout the country and still does in the rural regions prior to 2010s of "orthodoxing" the western rural areas by Christian Orthodox missionaries. Beginning from negligible roots prior to 1960s, however, [[Protestant]] [[Pentecostalism]] has grown to become the predominant religion of [[Guatemala City]] and other urban centers, later to 2010s that almost of all Maya of several rural areas of West Guatemala, living rural areas were mostly mass converted from Catholicism or possibly Maya religion due of various reasons to either [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern]] or [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] by late Fr. Andres Giron and some other Orthodox missionaries, and also  smaller to mid-sized towns also slowly converted as well since 2013.&lt;ref name="theorthodoxchurch.info"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theorthodoxchurch.info/blog/news/2014/04/16/introducing-mayan-orthodoxy/|title=News|work=Orthodoxy Cognate PAGE|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211145827/http://theorthodoxchurch.info/blog/news/2014/04/16/introducing-mayan-orthodoxy/|archivedate=2015-12-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unique religion is reflected in the local saint, [[Maximón]], who is associated with the subterranean force of masculine fertility and prostitution. Always depicted in black, he wears a black hat and sits on a chair, often with a cigar placed in his mouth and a gun in his hand, with offerings of tobacco, alcohol, and Coca-Cola at his feet. The locals know him as San Simon of Guatemala.

The [[Popol Vuh]] is the most significant work of Guatemalan literature in the [[K'iche' language]], and one of the most important of [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian]] American literature. It is a compendium of Maya stories and legends, aimed to preserve Maya traditions. The first known version of this text dates from the 16th century and is written in Quiché transcribed in Latin characters. It was translated into Spanish by the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priest [[Francisco Ximénez]] in the beginning of the 18th century. Due to its combination of historical, mythical, and religious elements, it has been called the Maya Bible. It is a vital document for understanding the culture of Pre-Columbian America. The [[Rabinal Achí]] is a dramatic work consisting of dance and text that is preserved as it was originally represented. It is thought to date from the 15th century and narrates the mythical and dynastic origins of the Toj K'iche' rulers of Rabinal, and their relationships with neighboring K'iche' of [[Q'umarkaj]].&lt;ref&gt;Akkeren 1999, pp. 281, 288.&lt;/ref&gt; The Rabinal Achí is performed during the Rabinal festival of January 25, the day of [[Saint Paul]]. It was declared a masterpiece of oral tradition of humanity by UNESCO in 2005. The 16th century saw the first native-born Guatemalan writers that wrote in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

==Maya cultural heritage tourism==
[[File:Boy playing Mayan trumpet opposite of Palacio Nacional, Mexico City, Mexico.webm|thumb|A boy playing Maya trumpet opposite of [[National Palace (Mexico)|Palacio Nacional, Mexico City]], Mexico.]]
There is an undeniable symbiotic relationship between cultural heritage, tourism, and a national identity.  In the case of the Maya, the many national identities have been constructed because of the growing demands placed on them by cultural tourism.  By focusing on lifeways through costumes, rituals, diet, handicrafts, language, housing, or other features, the identity of the economy shifts from the sale of labor to that of the sale of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Comaroff|first=John L.|author2=Jean Comaroff|title=Ethnicity, Inc.|journal=Chicago: University of Chicago Press|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global tourism is now considered one of the largest scale movement of goods, services, and people in history and a significant catalyst for economic development and sociopolitical change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stronza|first=Amanda|title=Anthropology of Tourism: Forging New Ground for Ecotourism and Other Alternatives|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=30|issue=30|pages=261–83|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.30.1.261|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Estimated that between 35 and 40 percent of tourism today is represented by cultural tourism or heritage tourism, this alternative to mass tourism offers opportunities for place-based engagement that frames context for interaction by the lived space and everyday life of other peoples, as well as sites and objects of global historical significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lefebvre|first=Henri|title=The Production of Space|year=1974|publisher=London: Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this production of tourism the use of historic symbols, signs, and topics form a new side that characterizes a nation and can play an active role in nation building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Soper|first=Anne K.|author2=Charles E. Greer |author3=Daniel C. Knudsen |title=Mauritian Landscapes of Culture, Identity, and Tourism|journal=Landscape, Tourism, and Meaning|year=2008|pages=51–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With this type of tourism, people argue that ethno-commerce may open unprecedented opportunities for creating value of various kinds. Tourists travel with cultural expectations, which has created a touristic experience sometimes faced with the need to invent traditions of artificial and contrived attractions, often developed at the expense of local tradition and meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Laurajane|title=Cultural Heritage: Critical Concepts in Media and Cultural Studies|year=2007|publisher=London: Routledge|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this can be seen in “Mayanizing Tourism on Roatan Island, Honduras: Archaeological Perspectives on Heritage, Development, and Indignity.”  Alejandro j. Figueroa et al., combine archaeological data and ethnographic insights to explore a highly contested tourism economy in their discussion of how places on Roatan Island, Honduras, have become increasingly “Mayanized” over the past decade.  As tour operators and developers continue to invent an idealized Maya past for the island, non-Maya archaeological remains and cultural patrimony are constantly being threatened and destroyed.  While heritage tourism provides economic opportunities for some, it can devalue contributions made by less familiar groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lyon|first=Sarah|author2=E. Christian Wells|title=Ethnographies of Global Tourism: Cultural Heritage, Economic Encounters, and the Redefinition of Impact|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mexico]], the term '''Mestizo''' (lit. mixed) is used to refer to an [[ethnic group]] that can be defined by different criteria, namely a cultural criterion (the language spoken) or a more strict biological criterion. Because of this, estimates of the number of Mestizos in Mexico do vary.&lt;ref name="EL MESTIZAJE Y LAS CULTURAS REGIONALES"&gt;[http://www.nacionmulticultural.unam.mx/Portal/Izquierdo/BANCO/Mxmulticultural/Elmestizajeylasculturas-elmestizaje.html en el censo de 1930 el gobierno mexicano dejó de clasificar a la población del país en tres categorías raciales, blanco, mestizo e indígena, y adoptó una nueva clasificación étnica que distinguía a los hablantes de lenguas indígenas del resto de la población, es decir de los hablantes de español.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823015618/http://www.nacionmulticultural.unam.mx/Portal/Izquierdo/BANCO/Mxmulticultural/Elmestizajeylasculturas-elmestizaje.html |date=2013-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Knight 1990:73"&gt;{{cite book |last=Knight |first=Alan |year=1990 |chapter=Racism, Revolution and ''indigenismo'': Mexico 1910–1940 |title=The Idea of Race in Latin America, 1870–1940 |editor-first=Richard |editor-last=Graham |pages=71–113 [p. 73] |location=Austin |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=0-292-73856-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bartolomé |first=Miguel Alberto |year=1996 |chapter=Pluralismo cultural y redefinicion del estado en México |title=Coloquio sobre derechos indígenas |location=Oaxaca |publisher=IOC |isbn=968-6951-31-8 |chapterurl=http://courses.cit.cornell.edu/iard4010/documents/Pluralismo_cultural_y_redefinicion_del_estado_en_Mexico.pdf |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investigacionyciencia.es/revistas/investigacion-y-ciencia/matemticas-del-planeta-tierra-585/el-impacto-del-mestizaje-en-mxico-11442 "El impacto del mestizaje en México"], “Investigación y Ciencia”, Spain, October 2013.

The meaning of the word ''Mestizo'' has changed over time. The word was originally used in [[New Spain|the colonial era]] to refer to individuals who were of half-[[Spaniards|Spanish]] and half-[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]] ancestry and it was one of the many extant [[castes]] used to classify individuals. While the caste system and racial classifications were officially abandoned once Mexico achieved its [[Independence of Mexico|independence]], the label mestizo was still used in academic circles: now to refer to all the people who were [[mixed race]]. It was in those academic circles that the "Mestizaje" or "[[La Raza Cósmica|Cosmic Race]]" ideology was created, the ideology asserted that Mestizos are the result of the mixing of all the races and that all of Mexico's population must become Mestizo so Mexico can finally achieve prosperity. After the [[Mexican Revolution]] the government, on its attempts to create an unified Mexican identity with no racial distinctions adopted and actively promoted the "Mestizaje" ideology, by 1930 racial identities other than "Indigenous" disappeared from the Mexican census, however at an institutional level all Mexicans who did not speak indigenous languages where now considered to be Mestizos, transforming what once was a racial identity into a cultural one.&lt;ref name="EL MESTIZAJE Y LAS CULTURAS REGIONALES"&gt;[http://www.nacionmulticultural.unam.mx/Portal/Izquierdo/BANCO/Mxmulticultural/Elmestizajeylasculturas-elmestizaje.html en el censo de 1930 el gobierno mexicano dejó de clasificar a la población del país en tres categorías raciales, blanco, mestizo e indígena, y adoptó una nueva clasificación étnica que distinguía a los hablantes de lenguas indígenas del resto de la población, es decir de los hablantes de español.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823015618/http://www.nacionmulticultural.unam.mx/Portal/Izquierdo/BANCO/Mxmulticultural/Elmestizajeylasculturas-elmestizaje.html |date=2013-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Gonzalo Guerrero.JPG|thumb|150px|A statue of [[Gonzalo Guerrero]], who adopted the Maya way of life and fathered the first mestizo children of [[Mexico]], but not of the [[Americas]], since the first mestizos were born in the Caribbean, by Spanish men and indigenous Caribbean women.]]
[[File:Mestizo.jpg|thumb|An 18th-century [[casta]] painting show an indigenous woman with her Spanish husband and their Mestizo child.]]
The exact date on which the term Mestizo and the caste system as a whole were introduced to Mexico is not known, however, the earliest surviving records that categorized people by different "qualities" (as castes were known in early colonial Mexico) are church birth and marriage records from the late 18th century.&lt;ref name="scielo.org.mx2"&gt;[http://www.scielo.org.ar/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1668-81042000000100018 "Ser mestizo en la nueva España a fines del siglo XVIII. Acatzingo, 1792"], ''Scielo'', Jujuy, November 2000. Retrieved on 01 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Back then there was an extensive caste system which assigned a different caste name for each possible racial combination, thus unlike definitions of "Mestizo" that would appear later, in these records "Mestizo" referred strictly to people who were of half Spanish and half indigenous ancestry. The same system is present in the first ever national population census of New Spain made in 1793, on which besides "Mestizo" the classification "castizo", "pardo", "mulatto", "zambo" etc. are present and are referred as a whole as "castes".&lt;ref name="EnsayospoblaciónMéxico"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sherburne Friend Cook|author2=Woodrow Borah|title=Ensayos sobre historia de la población.

The aforementioned, new definition of “Mestizo” would be the one used in the 1921 census (the second nationwide census that included a comprehensive racial classification in Mexico‘s history). Made right after the consummation of the Mexican revolution, the social context on which this census was made makes it particularly unique, as the government of the time was in the process of rebuilding the country and was looking forward to uniting all Mexicans under a single national identity,&lt;ref name="fnavarrete"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nacionmulticultural.unam.mx/Portal/Izquierdo/BANCO/Mxmulticultural/Elmestizajeylasculturas-elmestizaje.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130823015618/http://www.nacionmulticultural.unam.mx/Portal/Izquierdo/BANCO/Mxmulticultural/Elmestizajeylasculturas-elmestizaje.html |archivedate= 2013-08-23 |title=El mestizaje y las culturas |first=Federico |last=Navarrete |work=México Multicultural |publisher=[[UNAM]] |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Mixed race and cultures |accessdate=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the government found the identity it was looking for in the “mestizaje” or “cosmic race” ideology forged mainly by prominent academics and politicians [[José Vasconcelos]] and [[Manuel Gamio]]. The ideology asserted that Mexican Mestizos were the result of the mixing of all the races, obtaining the best qualities of each and that for Mexico to finally achieve prosperity all of the country’s population had to become Mestizo. By the 1930 census, the racial classifications of “White” and “Mestizo” disappeared, however implicitly all Mexicans who did not speak an indigenous language were now considered to be Mestizos.&lt;ref name="EL MESTIZAJE Y LAS CULTURAS REGIONALES"/&gt; The government also implemented cultural policies designed to "help" indigenous peoples achieve the same level of progress as the Mestizo society, eventually assimilating indigenous peoples completely to mainstream Mexican culture, aiming to solve the "Indian problem" by transforming indigenous communities into Mestizo ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bartolomé |first=Miguel Alberto |year=1996 |chapter=Pluralismo cultural y redefinicion del estado en México |title=Coloquio sobre derechos indígenas |location=Oaxaca |publisher=IOC |isbn=968-6951-31-8 |chapterurl=http://courses.cit.cornell.edu/iard4010/documents/Pluralismo_cultural_y_redefinicion_del_estado_en_Mexico.pdf |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The institutional enforcement of the Mestizaje ideology would continue until after the first decade of the 21st century, when Mexico’s government begun to recognize at a degree the different ethnicities that conform Mexico’s non-indigenous population, likely due recommendations of Mexico’s modern academic circles, which nowadays criticize the ideology claiming that it delegitimizes racist practices in Mexico under the idea of “(Racism) Not existing here (Mexico), as everybody is Mestizo” said critics assert that the Mestizaje ideology thus, has cemented a terrain of resistance in regards to social, politic and academic mobility around the theme of race in Mexico as while at an institutional level a Mexican who is of Indigenous or African appearance and one who is of European appearance are of the same race, on everyday interactions they get inevitably perceived and treated differently by Mexico’s society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El archivo del estudio de racismo en Mexico|url=http://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1405-92742016000200092&amp;lng=pt&amp;nrm=iso|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804041510/http://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1405-92742016000200092&amp;lng=pt&amp;nrm=iso|archivedate=2017-08-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other criticisms claim that the ideology couldn’t homogenize the different races that lived within Mexico because at its root, the ideology sought the “whitening” of Indigenous peoples and never the “indianization” of Whites&lt;ref name="MexicoRacista"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Federico Navarrete|title=Mexico Racista|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=FC_4CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT89#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=February 23, 2018|date=2016|publisher=Penguin Random house Grupo Editorial Mexico|isbn=9786073143646|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that it has accidentally erased from history minority ethnic groups such as Afro-Mexicans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2011/08/08/cultura/a11n1cul "El estado no reconoce a los Afromexicanos"], ''La Jornada'', 08 August 2011. Retrieved on February 22 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the authors conclude that Mexico introducing a real racial classification and accepting itself as a multicultural country opposed to a monolithic Mestizo country would bring benefits to the Mexican society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El mestizaje en Mexico|url=http://enp4.unam.mx/amc/libro_munioz_cota/libro/cap4/lec10_federiconavarreteelmestizaje.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of Mexico, the word "mestizo" is still used to refer to persons with mixed Indigenous and European ancestry. This usage does not conform to the modern Mexican usage of the word where a person of pure indigenous genetic heritage would be considered mestizo either by rejecting his indigenous culture or by not speaking an indigenous language,&lt;ref name="Bartolomé 1996:2" /&gt; and a person with a very low or without any percentage of indigenous genetic heritage would be considered fully indigenous either by speaking an indigenous language or by identifying with a particular indigenous cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="Knight 1990:73"&gt;{{cite book |last=Knight |first=Alan |year=1990 |chapter=Racism, Revolution and ''indigenismo'': Mexico 1910–1940 |title=The Idea of Race in Latin America, 1870–1940 |editor-first=Richard |editor-last=Graham |pages=71–113 [p. 73] |location=Austin |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=0-292-73856-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some regions of Mexico such as the Yucatán peninsula the word Mestizo is used to refer to the Maya-speaking populations living in traditional communities because during the caste war of the late 19th century those Maya who did not join the rebellion were classified as mestizos. In Chiapas, the term Ladino is used instead of Mestizo.&lt;ref name="Bartolomé 1996:2"/&gt;

Overall, the term "Mestizo" is no longer in wide use in contemporary Mexican society, with its use being limited to social and cultural studies when referring to the non-indigenous part of the Mexican population. The word has somewhat pejorative connotations and most of the Mexican citizens who would be defined as mestizos in the sociological literature would probably self-identify as Mexicans,&lt;ref name="Bartolomé 1996:2"/&gt; which complicate their quantification via self-identification. This is a direct contrast to ethno racial terms such as “Indian” “White” “Black” etc. who are still prominent in everyday social interactions in Mexico, it is not exactly known why this happened but is attributed to Mexicans simply favoring the use of “static” ethnic labels over “fluid” ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El mestizaje en Mexico|url=http://enp4.unam.mx/amc/libro_munioz_cota/libro/cap4/lec10_federiconavarreteelmestizaje.pdf

Mexicans who are biologically Mestizos are primarily of [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] and [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|Native American]] ancestry. The third largest component is sub-Saharan African, a legacy of the slavery in [[New Spain]] (which saw the importation of some 100,000&lt;ref name="ImmigrationandMigration"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rayna Bailey|title=Immigration and Migration|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=pVcDEfNxEvAC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=20,000+african+slaves+in+mexico&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=B7nhkAUuGR&amp;sig=lzioUH0PcXpeVziI05JASzjP0xU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwib3-2k-JvUAhWCJiYKHTXSBVMQ6AEIKzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=20%2C000%20african%20slaves%20in%20mexico&amp;f=false|accessdate=June 1, 2017|date=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9780816071067|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;-200,000&lt;ref name=INMEGEN /&gt;  black slaves). However, geneticists theorize that in regions of Mexico that did not have any presence of slaves, traces of African ancestry might have come from Spanish colonists and not African slaves themselves, as said ancestry is of North African and Near East origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genoma destapa diferencias de mexicanos|url=http://www.cnnexpansion.com/actualidad/2009/06/04/genoma-destapa-diferencias-de-mexicanos}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the region, some may have small traces of Asian admixture due the thousands of Filipinos and ''Chinos'' (Asian slaves of diverse origin, not just Chinese) that arrived on the ''[[Nao de China]]''. More recent Asian immigration (specifically Chinese) may help explain the comparatively high Asian contribution in Northwest Mexico (i.e., Sonora). The INMEGEN report also notes that on average, the largest genetic component of the self-identified Mestizo Mexicans is indigenous, while African and Asian [[genetic markers]] are diminishing with each generation and will continue to do so without new migration.&lt;ref name=INMEGEN /&gt; For example, there were an estimated 600,000 ''Afromestizos'' or Mestizos of significant African descent at the end of the colonial period which roughly amounted to 10% of the population (Euromestizos and indomestizos were estimeted at 1,000,000 and 600,000 respectively)&lt;ref name="Aguirre Beltrán"&gt;{{cite book|title=Historia de Mexico, Legado Historico Y Pasado Reciente|date=2004|publisher=Pearson Educación|location=Table 2.1|isbn=9789702605232|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WbYYZiMANjEC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=Gonzalo+Aguirre+Beltr%C3%A1n+afromestizos+indomestizos+euromestizos&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiOzf3CqrrPAhWr1IMKHQFzAqMQ6AEINjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Gonzalo%20Aguirre%20Beltr%C3%A1n%20afromestizos%20indomestizos%20euromestizos&amp;f=false|accessdate=October 1, 2016|chapter=Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; while as of 2015, the number of self identified Afro-Mexicans was 1.38 million (1.2% of the population).&lt;ref name="Encuesta Intercensal 2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=Principales resultados de la Encuesta Intercensal 2015 Estados Unidos Mexicanos |url=http://www.inegi.org.mx/est/contenidos/proyectos/encuestas/hogares/especiales/ei2015/doc/eic2015_resultados.pdf |publisher=[[INEGI]] |accessdate=9 December 2015 |pages=77 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210212235/http://www.inegi.org.mx/est/contenidos/proyectos/encuestas/hogares/especiales/ei2015/doc/eic2015_resultados.pdf |archivedate=10 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mestizaje ideology, which has blurred the lines of race at an institutional level has also had a significative influence in genetic studies done in Mexico:&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12394-010-0074-7 "The Map of the Mexican's Genome”: overlapping national identity, and population genomics"], ''Springer'', Retrieved on 01 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; As the criteria used in studies to determine if a Mexican is Mestizo or indigenous often lies in cultural traits such as the language spoken instead of racial self-identification or a phenotype-based selection there are studies on which populations who are considered to be Indigenous per virtue of the language spoken such as [[Nahua peoples]] from the state of [[Veracruz]] show a higher degree of European genetic admixture than the one populations considered to be Mestizo report in other studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Genetic admixture of eight Mexican indigenous populations: based on five polymarker, HLA-DQA1, ABO, and RH loci | pmid=18770527 | doi=10.1002/ajhb.20747 | volume=20 | journal=Am J Hum Biol | pages=647–50 | last1 = Buentello-Malo | first1 = L | last2 = Peñaloza-Espinosa | first2 = RI | last3 = Salamanca-Gómez | first3 = F | last4 = Cerda-Flores | first4 = RM | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite also happens, as there instances on which populations considered to be Mestizo show genetic frequencies very similar to continental European peoples in the case of Mestizos from the state of [[Durango]]&lt;ref name="Wiley"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0091270006287586 | volume=46 | title=CYP2D6Genotype and Phenotype in Amerindians of Tepehuano Origin and Mestizos of Durango, Mexico | year=2006 | journal=The Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | pages=527–536 | last1 = Sosa-Macías | first1 = Martha}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to [[White Americans|European derived Americans]] in the case of Mestizos from the state of [[Jalisco]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1470320310388440 "Renin gene haplotype diversity and linkage disequilibrium in two Mexican and one German population samples"], ''Sagepub'', Retrieved on 21 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the criteria used all the autosomal DNA studies made coincide on there being a significant genetic variation depending on the region analyzed, with southern Mexico having prevalent Amerindian and small but higher than average [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|African]] genetic contributions, the central region of Mexico showing a balance between Amerindian and European components,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/articles/15935948 "STR for 15 Loci in a population Sample From the Central Region of Mexico"], ''Pubmed'', Retrieved on 15 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and the latter gradually increasing as one travels northwards and westwards, where European ancestry becomes the majority of the genetic contribution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 11891937 | doi=10.1002/ajhb.10020 | volume=14 | issue=2 | title=Genetic admixture in three Mexican Mestizo populations based on D1S80 and HLA-DQA1 loci. | journal=Am J Hum Biol | pages=257–63 | year=2002 | last1 = Cerda-Flores | first1 = RM | last2 = Villalobos-Torres | first2 = MC | last3 = Barrera-Saldaña | first3 = HA | last4 = Cortés-Prieto | first4 = LM | last5 = Barajas | first5 = LO | last6 = Rivas | first6 = F | last7 = Carracedo | first7 = A | last8 = Zhong | first8 = Y | last9 = Barton | first9 = SA | last10 = Chakraborty | first10 = R}}&lt;/ref&gt; up until cities located at the [[Mexico-United States border]], where studies suggest there is a significant resurgence of Amerindian and African admixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=25617558 | doi=10.3305/nh.2015.31.2.7729 | volume=31 | title=SNP-19 genotypic variants of CAPN10 gene and its relation to diabetes mellitus type 2 in a population of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico | year=2014 | journal=Nutr Hosp | pages=744–50 | last1 = Loya Méndez | first1 = Y | last2 = Reyes Leal | first2 = G | last3 = Sánchez González | first3 = A | last4 = Portillo Reyes | first4 = V | last5 = Reyes Ruvalcaba | first5 = D | last6 = Bojórquez Rangel | first6 = G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 study conducted by Mexico's [[National Institute of Genomic Medicine INMEGEN|National Institute of Genomic Medicine (INMEGEN)]], which genotyped 104 samples, reported that mestizo Mexicans are 59% European, 35% "Asian" (primarily Amerindian), and 5% Other.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ashg.org/genetics/abstracts/abs06/f1065.htm|title=Evaluation of Ancestry and Linkage Disequilibrium Sharing in Admixed Population in Mexico|author1=J.K.

Research conducted by the country's ''[[Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genómica]]'' (INMEGEN) has found that Mexico's Mestizo population is not uniform in its genetic composition, with there being significant regional variation.&lt;ref name=INMEGEN /&gt; For example, [[Castizo|mestizos of primarily European ancestry]] predominate in [[Sonora]], while mestizos from the central region ([[Guanajuato]] and [[Zacatecas]]) have a more even split between indigenous and European.&lt;ref name=INMEGEN /&gt; The highest African contribution in the twelve participating [[Mexican states|states]] (picked to be representative of the major [[regions of Mexico]]) was found in [[Guerrero]] and [[Veracruz]], while the highest Asian contribution was found in Guerrero and Sonora.&lt;ref name=INMEGEN /&gt;

A study made by the [[University College London]] which included the countries of Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Brazil, and was made with collaboration of each countries' antrophology and genetics institutes reported the genetic ancestry of Mexican Mestizos was 56% Native American, 37% European and 5% African making Mexico, after Peru, the country with the highest Amerindian ancestry out of the five sample populations. Additionally, different phenotypical traits were analyzed, with the study determining that the frequency of blond hair and [[Eye color|light eyes]] in Mexicans was of 18.5% and 28.5% respectively,&lt;ref name="journals.plos.org"&gt;[http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004572 "Admixture in Latin America: Geographic Structure, Phenotypic Diversity and Self-Perception of Ancestry Based on 7,342 Individuals" table 1], ''Plosgenetics'', 25 September 2014. Retrieved on 9 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
making Mexico also the country with the second highest frequency of blond hair in the study. The reason behind such discrepancy between phenotypical traits and genetic ancestry may lie in the low African contribution found within the Mexican population relative to Brazil and Colombia. In addition, the samples used in Mexico's case were highly unproportional, as [[List of Mexican states by population|the northern and western regions of Mexico contain 45% of Mexico's population]], but no more than 10% of the samples used in the study came from the states located in these regions. For the most part, the rest of the samples hailed from [[Mexico City]] and southern Mexican states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004572 |pmid=25254375 |pmc=4177621 |title=Admixture in Latin America: Geographic Structure, Phenotypic Diversity and Self-Perception of Ancestry Based on 7,342 Individuals |journal=PLoS Genetics |volume=10 |issue=9 |pages=e1004572 |year=2014 |last1=Ruiz-Linares |first1=Andrés |last2=Adhikari |first2=Kaustubh |last3=Acuña-Alonzo |first3=Victor |last4=Quinto-Sanchez |first4=Mirsha |last5=Jaramillo |first5=Claudia |last6=Arias |first6=William |last7=Fuentes |first7=Macarena |last8=Pizarro |first8=María |last9=Everardo |first9=Paola |last10=De Avila |first10=Francisco |last11=Gómez-Valdés |first11=Jorge |last12=León-Mimila |first12=Paola |last13=Hunemeier |first13=Tábita |last14=Ramallo |first14=Virginia |last15=Silva De Cerqueira |first15=Caio C. |last16=Burley |first16=Mari-Wyn |last17=Konca |first17=Esra |last18=De Oliveira |first18=Marcelo Zagonel |last19=Veronez |first19=Mauricio Roberto |last20=Rubio-Codina |first20=Marta |last21=Attanasio |first21=Orazio |last22=Gibbon |first22=Sahra |last23=Ray |first23=Nicolas |last24=Gallo |first24=Carla |last25=Poletti |first25=Giovanni |last26=Rosique |first26=Javier |last27=Schuler-Faccini |first27=Lavinia |last28=Salzano |first28=Francisco M. |last29=Bortolini |first29=Maria-Cátira |last30=Canizales-Quinteros |first30=Samuel |display-authors=29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional studies suggests a tendency relating a higher European admixture with a higher socioeconomic status and a higher Amerindian ancestry  with a lower socioeconomic status: a study made exclusively on low income Mestizos residing in Mexico City found the mean admixture to be  0.590, 0.348, and 0.062 for Amerindian, European and African respectively whereas the European admixture increased to an average of around 70% on mestizos belonging to a higher socioeconomical level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ajhb.1310070210 |title=Racial admixture in a Mestizo population from Mexico City |journal=American Journal of Human Biology |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=213–6 |year=1995 |last1=Lisker |first1=Rubén |last2=Ramírez |first2=Eva |last3=González-Villalpando |first3=Clicerio |last4=Stern |first4=Michael P. |pmid=28557218}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, an autosomal dna study was conducted in Mexico city, with 1,310 samples, showing the average proportion of Native American, European, and African ancestry for the population to be 64%, 32%, and 4% respectively. Additional autosomal dna studies conducted on people from Mexico city show a predominate Native American background, with Native American ancestry ranging from 61-69% in 5 different studies.

A 2012 study published by the ''[[Journal of Human Genetics]]'' [[Y chromosome]]s  found the deep paternal ancestry of the Mexican  mestizo population to be predominately European (64.9%), followed by Amerindian (30.8%) and Asian (1.2%).&lt;ref name=pmid22832385&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/jhg.2012.67 |pmid=22832385 |title=Admixture and population structure in Mexican-Mestizos based on paternal lineages |journal=Journal of Human Genetics |volume=57 |issue=9 |pages=568–74 |year=2012 |last1=Martínez-Cortés |first1=Gabriela |last2=Salazar-Flores |first2=Joel |last3=Gabriela Fernández-Rodríguez |first3=Laura |last4=Rubi-Castellanos |first4=Rodrigo |last5=Rodríguez-Loya |first5=Carmen |last6=Velarde-Félix |first6=Jesús Salvador |last7=Franciso Muñoz-Valle |first7=José |last8=Parra-Rojas |first8=Isela |last9=Rangel-Villalobos |first9=Héctor }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Minister for Community Safety''' is a [[Junior minister]]ial post in the [[Scottish Government]]. As a result, the minister does not attend the [[Scottish Cabinet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980046_en_1 Scotland Act (1998)], ''Only those appointed under Section 47 of the Scotland Act "attend" Cabinet. Junior ministers are appointed under Section 49 and may be "present".''&lt;/ref&gt; The post was created in May 1999 during the [[1st Scottish Parliament]] as the ''Deputy Minister for Justice''. Deputy ministers were renamed ministers after the election of the [[Scottish National Party]] in 2007. The minister reports to the [[Cabinet Secretary for Justice]], who has overall responsibility for the portfolio, and is a member of cabinet.&lt;ref name=june2018&gt;{{cite web|url=https://beta.gov.scot/about/who-runs-government/cabinet-and-ministers/minister-for-community-safety/|title=Minister for Community Safety|date=2018-06-27|accessdate=2018-06-27|publisher=Scottish Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minister for Community Safety has specific responsibility for:&lt;ref name="june2018"/&gt;
*Community safety
*Access to justice
*Anti-[[sectarianism]]
*[[Anti-social behaviour]]
*Civil law
*[[fire and rescue services of Scotland|fire and rescue services]]
*Liquor licensing
*Legal profession

==History==
From 1999 to 2007 responsibility for Community Safety rested with the '''Minister for Justice''' and the '''Deputy Minister for Justice'''. The [[Government of the 3rd Scottish Parliament|Salmond government]], elected following the [[2007 Scottish Parliament election]] created the junior post of the '''Minister for Community Safety''' who assists the [[Cabinet Secretary for Justice]], in the [[Scottish Executive Justice Department| Scottish Justice Department]]. After the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election]] the post was renamed '''Minister for Community Safety and Legal Affairs''' and was given additional responsibilities for tackling sectarianism. It was renamed again to simply '''Minister for Community Safety''' in June 2018.&lt;ref name="june2018"/&gt;

==List of office holders==
The current Minister for Community Safety and Legal Affairs is [[Ash Denham]] MSP.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13572">The system of orders, decorations, and medals of the [[Republic of Kazakhstan]] has its origins in the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan No. 2676 dated December 12, 1995 titled "On State Awards of the Republic of Kazakhstan." Awards have been modified and added over time. The system has similarities to other countries that were formerly part of the [[Soviet Union]].

'''Patricia Monique Soltysik''' (May 17, 1950 – May 17, 1974) was an American woman, best known as one of the founders of the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]].

==Early life==
Patricia Soltysik was the daughter of a pharmacist, the third of seven children, the eldest of five girls. She grew up in [[Goleta, California]], and graduated from [[Dos Pueblos High School]] in 1968 in the top 10 percent of her class and was the student body treasurer of her high school.&lt;ref name="Book"&gt;{{cite book |last=Soltysik |first=Fred |title=In Search of a Sister |year=1976 |publisher=Bantam |location=New York  |asin=B0006WBNXU |page=248 |quote=21-35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She enrolled in the [[University of California, Berkeley]] on a state scholarship in 1968.  While at Berkeley she became embittered by the [[People's Park (Berkeley)|"Bloody Thursday" incident]] where a protester was killed.&lt;ref name="Book"/&gt; Drifting into radical groups she became a [[Radical feminism|radical feminist]] and self-avowed revolutionary. When her brother asked about her plans of becoming a lawyer, she replied, "Sisters, none of us are free until we are all free." In 1971 she attached herself to the radical ex-convict group '''United Prisoners Union''' and dropped out of school. She and her neighbor, [[Camilla Hall]], became lovers, and it was Hall who gave Soltysik the name "Mizmoon."&lt;ref name="Toobin"&gt;{{cite book| last = Toobin | first =Jeffrey | authorlink = | title =American Heiress: The Wild Saga of the Kidnapping, Crimes and Trial of Patty Hearst | publisher = Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group | year = 2016| page = 11| isbn = 978-0385536714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SLA is born==
[[Image:Patricia Soltysik.jpg|frame|Patricia Soltysik]]
On March 5, 1973, [[Donald DeFreeze]] escaped from prison and future [[Symbionese Liberation Army|SLA]] members [[Russ Little (SLA)|Russ Little]] and [[Willie Wolfe]] took him to Soltysik's house because unlike their other associates, Soltysik hadn't visited the prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.super70s.com/Super70s/News/Special-Reports/Terrorism/SLA/Chronology.asp |title=SLA Chronology |accessdate=January 21, 2007 |last=Patrick Mondout |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two became lovers and Soltysik and DeFreeze created the first SLA literature.&lt;ref name="Toobin" /&gt;

On November 6, 1973 in [[Oakland, California]], two members of the SLA murdered superintendent of schools [[Marcus Foster|Dr. Marcus Foster]] and badly wounded his deputy Robert Blackburn as the men left an Oakland school board meeting. The SLA mistakenly believed Foster supported the introduction of identification cards into Oakland schools, condemning him as "fascist". It was later revealed that Soltysik and [[Emily Harris (SLA)|Emily Harris]] were the two who shot Marcus Foster according to [[Patty Hearst]]'s sworn testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

Soltysik was one of the six SLA members killed in a shootout with [[Los Angeles Police Department]] on May 17, 1974.  She was found underneath the floor of the house in a crawl space.  She died from smoke inhalation, burn injuries, and several gunshot wounds as the house burned down around her.

'''''Pied-Noir''''' ({{IPA-fr|pjenwaʁ}}, "''Black-Foot''"), plural '''''Pieds-Noirs''''', is a term primarily referring to people of European, mostly ethnic [[French people|French]] origin, who were born in [[Algeria]] during the [[French Algeria|period of French rule]] from 1830 to 1962. More broadly, it can refer to other foreign-origin persons, both [[Christian]] and [[Jewish]], from all parts of the Mediterranean whose families had also migrated under French occupation in the 19th and 20th centuries to French Algeria, the [[French protectorate in Morocco]], or the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]], where many carried on living for several generations but fled or were expelled at the [[French colonial empire#Decolonization (20th century)|end of French rule in North Africa]] between 1956 and 1962. The term sometimes also includes the pre-existing [[Maghrebi Jews|North African Jews]] who had been living there prior to French colonization, whether [[Ladino language|Ladino]]-speaking [[North African Sephardim|Sephardi Jews]] who had arrived after the expulsion from [[Sepharad]] ([[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]) several centuries earlier in 1492 or even earlier Berber-speaking and/or Arabic-speaking [[Maghrebi Jews]] who had been residing there for over a thousand years, all of which were nonetheless awarded French citizenship by the 1870 [[Crémieux Decree]] whilst the rest of the native Muslim population was maintained in a second class status with the "Code de l'Indigénat" (ref Indigénat). More specifically, the term ''Pied-Noir'' is used for those of [[White Africans of European ancestry|European ancestry]] who "returned" to [[Metropolitan France|mainland France]] as soon as Algeria gained independence, or in the months following.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Naylor"/&gt;

From the French invasion on 18 June 1830 until its independence, Algeria was administratively part of France, and its European population was simply called Algerians or '''''colons''''' (colonists), whereas the [[Muslim]] people of Algeria were called [[Arab people|Arabs]], Muslims or [[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous]].

The term ''"pied-noir"'' began to be commonly used shortly before the end of the [[Algerian War]] in 1962. As of the last census in French-ruled Algeria, taken on 1 June 1960, there were 1,050,000 non-Muslim civilians (mostly [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], but including 130,000 [[History of the Jews in Algeria|Algerian Jews]]) in Algeria, 10 percent of the total population.&lt;ref name="Cook"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Cook, Bernard A. | title=Europe since 1945: an encyclopedia | year=2001 | publisher=Garland | location=New York | isbn=0-8153-4057-5 | pages=398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Algerian War the ''Pieds-Noirs'' overwhelmingly supported colonial French rule in Algeria and were opposed to Algerian nationalist groups such as the ''[[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Front de libération nationale]]'' (English: National Liberation Front) (FLN) and ''[[Mouvement national algérien]]'' (English: Algerian National Movement) (MNA). The roots of the conflict reside in political and economic inequalities perceived as an "alienation" from the French rule as well as a demand for a leading position for the [[Berbers|Berber]], Arab, and Islamic cultures and rules existing before the French conquest. The conflict contributed to the fall of the [[French Fourth Republic]] and the [[mass exodus]] of Algerian Europeans and Jews to France.&lt;ref name="Naylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

After Algeria became independent in 1962, about 800,000 ''Pieds-Noirs'' of French nationality were evacuated to mainland France while about 200,000 chose to remain in Algeria. Of the latter, there were still about 100,000 in 1965 and about 50,000 by the end of the 1960s.&lt;ref name="ladepeche"&gt;[http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2012/03/10/1308713-pieds-noirs-ceux-qui-ont-choisi-de-rester.html "Pieds-noirs": ceux qui ont choisi de rester], [[La Dépêche du Midi]], March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who moved to France suffered ostracism from the Left for their perceived exploitation of native Muslims and some blamed them for the war, thus the political turmoil surrounding the collapse of the French Fourth Republic.&lt;ref name="Naylor"/&gt; In popular culture, the community is often represented as feeling removed from [[Culture of France|French culture]] while longing for Algeria.&lt;ref name="Naylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; Thus, the recent history of the ''Pieds-Noirs'' has been imprinted with a theme of double alienation from both their native homeland and their adopted land. Though the term ''rapatriés d'Algérie'' implies that they once lived in France, most ''Pieds-Noirs'' were born in Algeria. Many families had lived there for generations, and the Algerian Jews, who were considered ''Pieds-Noirs'', were as indigenous to Algeria as its Muslim population.

==Origin of the term==
[[File:Pied noir.svg|thumb|Generic "black feet" emblem used by post-independence ''Pied-Noir'' associations.]]
There are competing theories about the origin of the term ''"pied-noir"''. According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', it refers to "a person of European origin living in Algeria during the period of French rule, especially a French person expatriated after Algeria was granted independence in 1962."&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = pied-noir | encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd Edition | volume = XI | pages =&amp;nbsp;799 | publisher = Clarendon Press | location= Oxford, United Kingdom | year = 1989 | isbn = 0-19-861223-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Dictionnaires Le Robert|Le Robert]]'' dictionary states that in 1901 the word indicated a sailor working barefoot in the coal room of a ship, who would find his feet dirtied by the soot and dust. Since, in the Mediterranean, this was often an Algerian native, the term was used pejoratively for Algerians until 1955 when it first began referring to "French born in Algeria" according to some sources.&lt;ref name="Shephard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Le Robert"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = pied-noir | encyclopedia = Dictionnaire Historique de la langue française | volume = 2 | pages =&amp;nbsp;2728–9 | publisher = Dictionnaires le Robert | location= Paris, France | date = March 2000 | isbn = 2-85036-532-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' claims this usage originated from mainland French as a negative nickname.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt;

There is also a theory that the term comes from the black boots of French soldiers compared to the barefoot Algerians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://fr.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_741539436/pieds-noirs.html|title=Pieds-noirs (histoire)|trans-title=Black feet (history)|language=fr|encyclopedia=Microsoft Encarta Online|year=2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210115310/http://fr.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_741539436/pieds-noirs.html|archivedate=10 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other theories focus on new settlers dirtying their clothing by working in swampy areas, wearing black boots when on horseback, or trampling grapes to make wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.francparler.com/syntagme.php?id=337|title=Francparler.com - Voyons en détails...|date=12 October 2005|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051012145549/http://www.francparler.com/syntagme.php?id=337|archivedate=12 October 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main |French Algeria|History of Algeria}}
European settlement of Algeria began during the 1830s, after France had commenced the process of conquest with the military seizure of the city of Algiers in 1830. The invasion was instigated when the [[Dey of Algiers]] struck the French consul with a fly-swatter in 1827, although economic reasons are also cited. In 1830 the government of [[Charles X of France|King Charles X]] blockaded Algeria and an [[Naval fleet|armada]] sailed to Algiers, followed by a land expedition. A troop of 34,000&amp;nbsp;soldiers landed on 18 June 1830, at [[Sidi Ferruch]], {{convert|27|km|mi}} west of Algiers. Following a three-week campaign, the [[Hussein Dey]] capitulated on 5 July 1830, and was exiled.&lt;ref name="Lapidus"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 0-521-77933-2| pages =585–600| last = Lapidus

In the 1830s the French controlled only the northern part of the country.&lt;ref name="LOC"/&gt; Entering the [[Oran]] region, they faced resistance from [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|Emir Abd al-Kader]], a leader of a [[Sufism|Sufi]] Brotherhood.&lt;ref name="Churchill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stone"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5mqlsUm193cC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=french+invasion+of+algeria|publisher = Columbia University Press| isbn = 0-231-10911-3| pages =31–37| last = Stone| first = Martin| title = The Agony of Algeria| year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1839 Abd al-Kader began a seven-year war by declaring [[jihad]] against the French. The French signed two peace treaties with al-Kader, but they were broken because of a miscommunication between the military and the Parisian government. In response to the breaking of the second treaty, Abd al-Kader drove the French to the coast. In reply, a force of nearly 100,000&amp;nbsp;troops marched to the Algerian countryside and forced Abd al-Kader's surrender in 1847.&lt;ref name="Churchill"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IANFAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=surrender+of+abdel+al+kader|pages=270|last=Churchill|first=Charles Henry|title=The Life of Abdel Kader, Ex-sultan of the Arabs of Algeria|publisher=Chapman and Hall|year=1867}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1848 Algeria was divided into three [[Departments of France|départements of France]], Alger, [[Oran (department)|Oran]], and Constantine, thus becoming part of the French state.&lt;ref name="Milton"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YHXBpzKjNCkC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=french+colonization+of+algeria| publisher = Polity| isbn = 0-7456-3593-8| pages =28| last = Milton-Edwards| first = Beverley| title = Contemporary Politics in the Middle East| year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Churchill"/&gt;

The French modeled their colonial system on their predecessors, the [[Ottomans]], by co-opting local tribes. In 1843 the colonists began supervising through ''Bureaux Arabes''&lt;ref name="Lapidus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Amselle"/&gt; operated by military officials with authority over particular domains.&lt;ref name="Amselle"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Amselle, Jean-Loup | title=Affirmative exclusion: cultural pluralism and the rule of custom in France | year=2003 | publisher=[[Cornell University Press]] | location=Ithaca, N.Y. | isbn=0-8014-8747-1 | pages=65–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system lasted until the 1880s and the rise of the [[French Third Republic]], when colonization intensified.&lt;ref name="Cook"/&gt; Large-scale regrouping of lands began when land-speculation companies took advantage of government policy that allowed massive sale of native property.

===Relationship to mainland France and Muslim Algeria===
[[Image:Algérie fr.jpg|thumb|Map of [[French Algeria]]]]
The ''Pied-Noir'' relationship with France and Algeria was marked by alienation. The settlers considered themselves French,&lt;ref name="Grenville"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 0-415-28955-6| pages =520–30| last = Grenville| first = J. A. S.| title = A History of the World from the 20th to the 21st Century| year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; but many of the ''Pieds-Noirs'' had a tenuous connection to mainland France, which 28 percent of them had never visited. The settlers encompassed a range of [[socioeconomic]] ''strata'', ranging from peasants to large landowners, the latter of whom were referred to as ''grands colons''.&lt;ref name="Grenville"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kacowicz"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Lexington Books| isbn = 0-7391-1607-X| pages =30–70| last = Kacowicz| first = Arie Marcelo|author2=Pawel Lutomski| title = Population Resettlement in International Conflicts: A Comparative Study

In Algeria, the Muslims were not considered French and did not share the same political or economic benefits.&lt;ref name="Grenville"/&gt; For example, the indigenous population did not own most of the settlements, farms, or businesses, although they numbered nearly nine million (versus roughly one million ''Pieds-Noirs'') at independence. Politically, the Muslim Algerians had no representation in the [[French National Assembly]] until 1945 and wielded limited influence in local governance.&lt;ref name="Kantowicz"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Kantowicz, Edward R. | title=Coming apart, coming together | year=2000 | publisher=W.B. Eerdmans | location=Grand Rapids, Mich. | isbn=0-8028-4456-1 | pages=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; To obtain citizenship, they were required to renounce their Muslim identity. Since this would constitute [[Apostasy in Islam|apostasy]], only about 2,500&amp;nbsp;Muslims acquired citizenship before 1930.&lt;ref name="Kacowicz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kantowicz"/&gt; The settlers' politically and economically dominant position worsened relations between the two groups.

===The ''Pied-Noir'' population as part of the total Algerian population===
[[Image:Non musulmans en Algérie-1954-par départements.png|thumb|Non-Muslim proportion of population in 1954 by ''département'' (post-1957 administrative division). White: less than 2% non-Muslim; light blue: 2-5%; mid-blue: 5-10%; dark blue: 10-30%; black: greater than 30% non-Muslim population]]
From roughly the last half of the 19th century until independence, the ''Pieds-Noirs'' accounted for approximately 10% of the total Algerian population.  Although they constituted a numerical minority, they were undoubtedly the prime political and economic force of the region.

In 1959, the ''Pieds-Noirs'' numbered 1,025,000, and accounted for 10.4% of the total population of Algeria, a percentage gradually diminishing since the peak of 15.2% in 1926. However, some areas of Algeria had high concentrations of ''Pieds-Noirs'', such as the regions of Bône (now [[Annaba (city)|Annaba]]), Algiers, and above all the area from [[Oran]] to [[Sidi Bel Abbes|Sidi-Bel-Abbès]].&lt;ref&gt;Albert Habib Hourani, Malise Ruthven (2002). "''[https://books.google.com/books?id=egbOb0mewz4C&amp;pg=PA323&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false A history of the Arab peoples]''". Harvard University Press. p.323. {{ISBN|0-674-01017-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oran had been under European rule since the 17th century, and the population in the Oran metropolitan area was 49.3% European and Jewish in 1959. In the Algiers metropolitan area, Europeans and Jewish people accounted for 35.7% of the population. In the metropolitan area of Bône they accounted for 40.5% of the population. The ''département'' of Oran, a rich European-developed agricultural land of 16,520&amp;nbsp;km² (6,378 sq. miles) stretching between the cities of Oran and Sidi-Bel-Abbès, and including them, was the area of highest ''Pied-Noir'' density outside of the cities, with the ''Pieds-Noirs'' accounting for 33.6% of the population of the ''[[département]]'' in 1959.

This advancement was resisted by part of the larger ''Pied-Noir'' community and in 1897 a wave of anti-Semitic riots occurred in Algeria. During World War II the ''décret Crémieux'' was abolished under the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime, and Jews were barred from professional jobs between 1940 and 1943.&lt;ref name="Stora"/&gt; Citizenship was restored in 1943. Thus, the Jews of Algeria eventually came to be considered part of the ''Pied-Noir'' community,&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt;, and many fled the country to France in 1962, alongside most other ''Pieds-Noirs'', after the Algerian War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Behrman House, Inc| isbn = 0-940646-38-2| last = Grobman| first = Alex| title = Genocide: Critical Issues of the Holocaust| year = 1983|pages=132|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uf1rdNyUwRQC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=algeria+jews+vichy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Algerian War and exodus===
====Algerian War====
{{main |Algerian War|Évian Accords}}
For more than a century France maintained [[French colonial empire|colonial rule]] in Algerian territory. This allowed exceptions to republican law, including [[Sharia]] laws applied by Islamic customary courts to Muslim women which gave women certain rights to property and inheritance that they did not have under French law.&lt;ref name="Stora"/&gt; Discontent among the Muslim Algerians grew after the World Wars, in which the Algerians sustained many casualties.&lt;ref name="Stora"/&gt; Algerian nationalists began efforts aimed at furthering equality by listing complaints in the ''Manifesto of the Algerian People'', which requested equal representation under the state and access to citizenship, but no equality for all citizens to preserve Islamic precepts. The French response was to grant citizenship to 60,000&amp;nbsp;"meritorious" Muslims.&lt;ref name="LOC"/&gt; During a reform effort in 1947, the French created a [[Bicameralism|bicameral legislature]] with one house for the French citizens and another for the Muslims; but gave a European's vote equal seven times more weight than a Muslim's vote.&lt;ref name="Kacowicz"/&gt; Paramilitary groups such as the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (''Front de Libération nationale'', FLN) appeared, claiming an Arab-Islamic brotherhood and state.&lt;ref name="Stora"/&gt; This led to the outbreak of a war for independence, the [[Algerian War]], in 1954.

[[File:Bataille d'Alger.jpg|thumb|upright|Algiers: Muslim quarters (green), European quarters (brown), terrorist attacks]]
From the first armed operations of November 1954, ''Pied-Noir'' civilians had always been targets for the FLN, either by assassination; bombing bars and cinemas; mass massacres; torture; and rapes in farms.&lt;ref name="Courrieres"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Courrières, Yves |authorlink =Yves Courrière | title=La Guerre d'Algerie | year=1968 | publisher=Fayard | location= | isbn=2-213-61121-1 | pages=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the onset of the war, the ''Pieds-Noirs'' believed the French military would be able to overcome opposition. In [[May 1958 crisis|May 1958 a demonstration]] for French Algeria, led by ''Pieds-Noirs'' but including many Muslims, occupied an Algerian government building. [[Jacques Massu|General Jacques Massu]] controlled the riot by forming a 'Committee of Public Safety' demanding that his acquaintance [[Charles de Gaulle]] be named president of the [[French Fourth Republic]], to prevent the "abandonment of Algeria". This eventually led to the fall of the Republic.&lt;ref name="Grenville"/&gt; In response, the French Parliament voted 329 to 224 to place de Gaulle in power.&lt;ref name="Grenville"/&gt; Once de Gaulle assumed leadership, he attempted peace by visiting Algeria within three days of his appointment, proclaiming "French Algeria!"; but in September 1959 he planned a referendum for Algerian self-determination that passed overwhelmingly.&lt;ref name="Grenville"/&gt; Many French political and military leaders in Algeria viewed this as a betrayal and formed the ''[[Organisation armée secrète]]'' (OAS) that had much support among ''Pieds-Noirs''. This paramilitary group began attacking officials representing de Gaulle's authority, Muslims, and de Gaulle himself.&lt;ref name="Grenville"/&gt; The OAS was also accused of murders and bombings which nullified any remaining reconciliation opportunities between the communities,&lt;ref name="Meredith"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Meredith, Martin | title=The Fate of Africa: A History of Fifty Years of Independence | publisher=PublicAffairs | location= | isbn=1-58648-398-6 | pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Pieds-Noirs'' themselves never believed such reconciliation possible as their community was targeted from the start.&lt;ref name="Courrieres"/&gt;

The opposition culminated in the [[Algiers putsch of 1961]], led by retired generals. After its failure, on 18 March 1962, de Gaulle and the FLN signed a cease-fire agreement, the [[Évian Accords]], and held a referendum. In July, Algerians voted 5,975,581 to 16,534 to become independent from France.&lt;ref name="Kacowicz"/&gt;
This triggered a [[Oran massacre of 1962|massacre of ''Pieds-Noirs'' in Oran]] by a suburban Muslim population. European people were shot, molested and brought to Petit-Lac [[slaughterhouse]] where they were tortured and executed.&lt;ref name="Monneret"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Monneret, Jean | title=Oran, 5 juillet 1962 | publisher=Michalon | location= | isbn=2-84186-308-5 | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exodus====
[[File:Adolphe Crémieux by Lecomte du Nouy.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Minister of Justice (France)|Minister of Justice]] [[Adolphe Crémieux]]'s [[Crémieux decrees|decrees of October 24, 1870]] granted automatic French citizenship to French Algeria's Sephardic Jews. In contrast, Muslims and 3-year resident European foreigners had to have reached the [[age of majority]] (21) to apply.]]
The exodus began once it became clear that Algeria would become independent.&lt;ref name="Shephard"/&gt; In Algiers, it was reported that by May 1961 the ''Pieds-Noirs'&amp;nbsp;'' morale had sunk because of violence and allegations that the entire community of French nationals had been responsible for "terrorism, torture, colonial racism, and ongoing violence in general" and because the group felt "rejected by the nation as ''Pieds-Noirs''&amp;nbsp;".&lt;ref name="Shephard"&gt;{{Cite book

The number of ''Pieds-Noirs'' who fled Algeria totalled more than 800,000 between 1962 and 1964.&lt;ref name="Meredith"/&gt; Many ''Pieds-Noirs'' left only with what they could carry in a suitcase.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meredith"/&gt; Adding to the confusion, the de Gaulle government ordered the [[French Navy]] not to help with transportation of French citizens.&lt;ref name="Kacowicz"/&gt; By September 1962, cities such as Oran, [[Bône]], and [[Sidi Bel Abbès]] were half-empty. All administration-, police-, school-, justice-, and commercial activities stopped within three months after many ''Pieds-Noirs'' were told to choose either "''la valise ou le cercueil''" (the suitcase or the coffin).&lt;ref name="Stora"/&gt; 200,000&amp;nbsp;''Pieds-Noirs'' chose to remain, but they gradually left through the following decade; by the 1980s only a few thousand ''Pieds-Noirs'' remained in Algeria.&lt;ref name="ladepeche"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grenville"/&gt;

The flight of the ''Pieds-Noirs'' dwarfed that of the Muslim [[harki]]s who had fought on the French side during the Algerian War. Of approximately 250,000 Muslim loyalists only about 90,000, including dependents, were able to escape to France; and of those who remained many thousands were killed by lynch mobs or executed as traitors by the FLN. In contrast to the treatment of the European ''Pieds-Noirs'', little effort was made by the French government to extend protection to the harkis or to arrange their organised evacuation.&lt;ref name="Horne"&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = The Viking Press| isbn = 0-670-61964-7|pages=533 and 537| last = Horne| first = Alistair| title = A Savage War of Peace: Algeria 1954-1962| year = 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Flight to mainland France====

The French government claimed that it had not anticipated that such a massive number would leave; it believed that perhaps 300,000 might choose to depart temporarily and that a large portion would return to Algeria.&lt;ref name="Shephard"/&gt; The administration had set aside funds for absorption of those it called ''repatriates'' to partly reimburse them for property losses.&lt;ref name="Kacowicz"/&gt; The administration avoided acknowledging the true numbers of refugees to avoid upsetting its Algeria policies.&lt;ref name="Kacowicz"/&gt; Consequently, few plans were made for their return, and, psychologically at least, many of the ''Pieds-Noirs'' were alienated from both Algeria and France.&lt;ref name="Naylor"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = University Press of Florida| isbn = 0-8130-3096-X| pages =9–23,&amp;nbsp;14|last = Naylor| first = Phillip Chiviges| title = France and Algeria: A History of Decolonization and Transformation | year = 2000|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZMUb8R3Cs-MC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=pied+noir+alienation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

Integration was easier for the upper classes, many of whom found the transformation less stressful than the lower classes, whose only capital had been left in Algeria when they fled. Many were surprised that they were often treated as an "underclass or outsider-group" with difficulties in gaining advancement in their careers. Also, many ''Pieds-Noirs'' contended that the money allocated by the government to assist in relocation and reimbursement was insufficient regarding their loss.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;

Thus, the repatriated ''Pieds-Noirs'' frequently felt "disaffected" from French society. They also suffered from a sense of alienation stemming from the French government's changed position towards Algeria.

==The Song of the Africans==
The ''Pied-Noir'' community has adopted, as both an unofficial anthem and as a symbol of its identity, Captain Félix Boyer's 1943 version of "[[Le Chant des Africains]]" (lit. "The Song of the Africans").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nice.algerianiste.free.fr/pages/les_africains/lesafricains.html#chant|title=Les Africains|website=nice.algerianiste.free.fr|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a 1915 ''[[Infanterie de Marine]]'' marching song, originally titled "C'est nous les Marocains" (lit. "We are the Moroccans") and dedicated to Colonel Van Hecke, commander of a World War I cavalry unit: the ''[[:fr:7e régiment de chasseurs d'Afrique|7e régiment de chasseurs d'Afrique]]'' ("7th African Light Cavalry Regiment"). Boyer's song was adopted during World War II by the Free French [[First Army (France)|First Army]] that was drawn from units of the [[Army of Africa (France)|Army of Africa]] and included many ''Pieds-Noirs''. The music and words were later utilized by the ''Pieds-Noirs'' to proclaim their allegiance to France. &lt;small&gt;([http://nice.algerianiste.free.fr/pages/les_africains/africains.wma listen to the Chant des Africains])&lt;/small&gt;

The "Song of the Africans" was banned from use as official military music in 1962 at the end of the Algerian War until August 1969, when the French Minister of Veterans Affairs (''Ministre des Anciens Combattants'') at the time, Henri Duvillard, lifted the prohibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Mémoire Vive |author=John Franklin |magazine=Magazine du C.D.H.A. |url=http://nice.algerianiste.free.fr/pages/les_africains/lesafricains.html#chant |issue=32, 4th trimester 2005|access-date=2010-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prince Imperial of Mexico''' was a title created after Mexico gained independence from the [[Spanish Empire]] as the [[First Mexican Empire]]. It was designated to be the official title of the [[heir apparent]] to the imperial throne of Mexico. 

Only a few days after [[Agustín de Iturbide]] was created [[Emperor of Mexico]] in May 1822, his eldest son, [[Agustín Jerónimo de Iturbide y Huarte]], was created heir apparent and invested with the title of Prince Imperial of Mexico and the honorific "[[Don (honorific)|Don]]" to accompany the title. 

Only three people have ever held the title, and only one of them when it was still in legal effect. It is no longer recognized by the [[Mexico|United Mexican States]], since the [[Mexican Constitution|Mexican Constitution of 1917]] specifically prohibits the creation and use of Mexican noble titles by Mexican citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040411090034/http://www.casaimperial.org/introduction.htm Casa Imperial]&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between '''[[Race (human categorization)|race]] and capital punishment in the United States''' has been studied extensively. As of 2014, 42% of those on [[death row]] in the United States were black. &lt;ref name=atlantic/&gt; However, this is an under-representation relative to the proportion of convicted murderers; 52.5% of all homicide offenders between 1980 and 2008 were black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf|title=Homicide Trends in the United States, 1980-2008|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the FBI’s Supplementary Homicide Reports, between the early 1960s and the late 1970s, the rate of homicides doubled. For every 100,000 U.S residents, the homicide victim rate elevated from 4.6 to 9.7.
The homicide victim rate per 100,000 U.S. residents has heightened at 10.2 in 1980 and dropped in 1984 to 7.9.
In 1992, homicide victim rate decreased drastically again from 9.3 to 4.8 in 2010. Since 1999 the rate of homicide victims have retained a steady range.
The number of homicides peaked at 24,703 in 1991 and then dwindled to 15,522 in 1999.
The rate of homicides consistently elevated between the years of 1950 and 1970.
Since 1999 the rate of homicide victims have retained a steady range. In 1999, the rates were at 15,552 and slowly increased to 17,030. In comparison to the 24,703 disclosed in 1991, these numbers have gradually declined and become more consistent.

In 1983, [[David Baldus]] co-authored a study that found that [[Capital punishment in Georgia (U.S. state)|capital punishment in Georgia]] since the decision in ''[[Furman v. Georgia]]'' was handed down 1972 had been applied unevenly across race. Specifically, his and his colleagues' study found that only 15 out of 246 murder cases (6%) where the victim was black resulted in a death sentence, as compared with 85 out of 348 (24%) of such cases when the victim was white.&lt;ref name=atlantic&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/06/race-and-the-death-penalty/373081/ | title=Racism and the Execution Chamber | work=The Atlantic | date=23 June 2014 | accessdate=8 April 2016 | author=Ford, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6378&amp;context=jclc | title=Comparative Review of Death Sentences: An Empirical Study of the Georgia Experience | author=Baldus, David | journal=Journal of Criminal Law &amp; Criminology | date=Fall 1983 | volume=74 | issue=3 | pages=661–753|display-authors=etal | doi=10.2307/1143133}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study led to Warren McCleskey's death sentence being challenged due to allegations that it was racially biased.

==Kleck==
In 1981, [[Gary Kleck]] published a [[literature review]] that declared that all states, except the [[Southern United States]], found that African Americans were less likely than white Americans to be sentenced to death or executed. The review also found that cases with black victims were less likely than those with white victims to result in the death sentence, possibly as a result of the devaluing of black crime victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Racial Discrimination in Criminal Sentencing: A Critical Evaluation of the Evidence with Additional Evidence on the Death Penalty | author=Kleck, Gary | journal=American Sociological Review | date=December 1981 | volume=46 | issue=6 | pages=783–805 | doi=10.2307/2095079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radelet==
A 1981 study by [[Michael Radelet]] found that murder cases involving white victims were more likely to result in a death sentence than were those involving black victims, mainly because those accused of murdering whites were more likely to be indicted for [[first-degree murder]]. The same study found that after controlling for the race of the victim, there was no clear evidence that the race of the defendant predicted how likely they were to receive a death sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Racial Characteristics and the Imposition of the Death Penalty | author=Radelet, Michael | journal=American Sociological Review | date=December 1981| volume=46 | issue=6 | pages=918–927 | doi=10.2307/2095088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dwayne Smith==
A 1987 study by [[M. Dwayne Smith]] of [[Tulane University]] found a racial bias in capital punishment cases in [[Louisiana]], but only with regard to the race of the victim, not the offender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=M.Dwayne|title=Patterns of discrimination in assessments of the death penalty: The case of Louisiana|journal=Journal of Criminal Justice|date=January 1987|volume=15|issue=4|pages=279–286|doi=10.1016/0047-2352(87)90015-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ekland-Olson==
A 1988 study by [[Sheldon Ekland-Olson]] found that in the first decade after ''Furman'', criminal cases in [[Texas]] involving white victims were more likely to result in a death sentence than those involving either black or Hispanic victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://search.proquest.com/openview/7b729b9f59348abc0516211a50ffe9cd/1?pq-origsite=gscholar | title=Structured Discretion, Racial Bias, and the Death Penalty: The First Decade after "Furman" in Texas | date=December 1988 | author=Ekland-Olson, Sheldon | journal=Social Science Quarterly | volume=69 | issue=4 | pages=853–873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government Accountability Office==
A 1990 [[Government Accountability Office]] analysis of 28 studies, in 82% of these studies, found that murder cases with white victims were more likely than those with black victims to result in a death sentence. The report described this relationship as "remarkably consistent across data sets, states, data collection methods,
and analytic techniques."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/220/212180.pdf | title=Death Penalty Sentencing: Research Indicates Pattern of Racial Disparities | work=Government Accountability Office | date=26 February 1990 | accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sorensen &amp; Wallace==
A 1995 study by [[Jonathan Sorensen]] and Donald H. Wallace found evidence of a racial bias in capital punishment in [[Missouri]], mainly in regards to the race of the victim. The study found that cases with white victims were more likely to result in death sentences, and that cases with black victims were less likely to result in such sentences. The study also reported that these disparities were largest when "prosecutors and jurors are freed from the seriousness of the cases to consider other factors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sorensen|first1=Jonathan R.|last2=Wallace|first2=Donald H.|title=Capital punishment in Missouri: Examining the issue of racial disparity|journal=Behavioral Sciences &amp; the Law|date=Winter 1995|volume=13|issue=1|pages=61–80|doi=10.1002/bsl.2370130105}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1999 study by the same authors found that murder cases with black defendants and white victims were more likely than those with any other combination of defendant and victim races to "result in first-degree murder charges, to be served notice of aggravating circumstances, and to proceed to capital trial."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sorensen|first1=Jon|last2=Wallace|first2=Donald H.|title=Prosecutorial discretion in seeking death: An analysis of racial disparity in the pretrial stages of case processing in a midwestern county|journal=Justice Quarterly|date=September 1999|volume=16|issue=3|pages=559–578|doi=10.1080/07418829900094261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eberhardt==
A 2006 study led by [[Jennifer Eberhardt]] found that even after numerous other factors were controlled for, defendants who looked more stereotypically black in death penalty cases with white victims were more likely to be sentenced to death. People tend to see Black physical traits as directly related to criminality. The synthesis supported a strong race of victim influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eberhardt|first1=J.

==Alesina and La Ferrara==
A 2014 study by Alberto Alesina and [[Eliana La Ferrara]] found evidence of racial bias in capital sentencing in that error rates tended to be higher in capital cases involving minority defendants and white victims. However, this pattern was only seen in Southern states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alesina|first1=Alberto|last2=La Ferrara|first2=Eliana|title=A Test of Racial Bias in Capital Sentencing|journal=American Economic Review|date=November 2014|volume=104|issue=11|pages=3397–3433|doi=10.1257/aer.104.11.3397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gustave Courbet 010.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|''[[Bonjour, Monsieur Courbet]]'', 1854. A [[Realism (art movement)|Realist]] painting by [[Gustave Courbet]]]]

'''Realism''', sometimes called '''naturalism''', in [[the arts]] is generally the attempt to represent subject matter truthfully, without [[artificiality]] and avoiding artistic conventions, or implausible, exotic, and supernatural elements.  Realism has been prevalent in the arts at many periods, and can be in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of stylization.

In the visual arts, illusionistic realism is the accurate depiction of lifeforms, perspective, and the details of light and colour. But realist or naturalist works of art may, as well or instead of illusionist realism, be "realist" in their subject-matter, and emphasize the mundane, ugly or sordid.  This is typical of the 19th-century  [[Realism (art movement)|Realist movement]] that began in France in the 1850s, after the [[French Revolution of 1848|1848 Revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rlsm/hd_rlsm.htm |title=Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=2014-06-02 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also [[social realism]], [[Regionalism (art)|regionalism]], or [[kitchen sink realism]]. The Realist painters rejected [[Romanticism]], which had come to dominate French literature and art, with roots in the late [[18th century]].

There have been various movements invoking realism in the other arts, such as the [[opera]] style of [[Verismo (music)|verismo]], [[literary realism]], [[Realism (theatre)|theatrical realism]], and [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealist cinema]]. 

==Visual arts==
[[File:The Arnolfini Portrait, détail (2).jpg|thumb|left|Realist or illusionistic detail of the [[convex mirror]] in the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]], 1434]]
Realism is the precise, detailed and accurate representation in art of the visual appearance of scenes and objects i.e., it is drawn in photographic precision. Realism in this sense is also called [[Naturalism (visual art)#Realism or naturalism as resisting idealization|naturalism]], [[mimesis]] or [[Illusionism (art)|illusionism]]. Realistic art was created in many periods, and it is in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of [[stylization]].  It becomes especially marked in European painting in the [[Early Netherlandish painting]] of [[Robert Campin]], [[Jan van Eyck]] and other artists in the 15th century.  However such "realism" is often used to depict, for example, angels with wings, which were not things the artists had ever seen in real life. Equally, 19th-century [[Realism art movement]] painters such as [[Gustave Courbet]] are by no means especially noted for precise and careful depiction of visual appearances; in Courbet's time that was more often a characteristic of [[academic painting]], which very often depicted with great skill and care scenes that were contrived and artificial, or imagined historical scenes.  It is the choice and treatment of subject matter that defines Realism as a movement in painting, rather than the careful attention to visual appearances.  Other terms such as naturalism, naturalistic and "veristic" do not escape the same ambiguity, though the distinction between "realistic" (usually related to visual appearance) and "realist" is often useful, as is the term "illusionistic" for the accurate rendering of visual appearances.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aSBAUzb8SokC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Realism+painting&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sfslUYLPDKK30QXLmIHIAQ&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Realism%20painting&amp;f=false Stremmel, Kerstin,  ''Realism''], pp. 6–9, 2004, Taschen, {{ISBN|3822829420|978-3822829424}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finocchio, Ross.

===Illusionistic realism===
[[File:Frederic Leighton - Cimabue's Madonna Carried in Procession - Google Art Project 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lord Leighton]]'s ''[[Cimabue's Celebrated Madonna]]'' of 1853–55 is at the end of a long tradition of illusionism in painting, but is not Realist in the sense of Courbet's work of the same period.]]

The development of increasingly accurate representation of the visual appearances of things has a long history in art.  It includes elements such as the accurate depiction of the anatomy of humans and animals, of [[graphical perspective|perspective]] and effects of distance, and of detailed effects of light and colour. The [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic]] in Europe achieved remarkably lifelike depictions of animals, and [[Ancient Egyptian art]] developed conventions involving both [[stylization]] and idealization that nevertheless allowed very effective depictions to be produced very widely and consistently. [[Ancient Greek art]] is commonly recognised as having made great progress in the representation of anatomy, and has remained an influential model ever since. No original works on panels or walls by the great Greek painters survive, but from literary accounts, and the surviving corpus of derivative works (mostly Graeco-Roman works in [[mosaic]]) it is clear that illusionism was highly valued in painting. [[Pliny the Elder]]'s famous story of birds pecking at grapes painted by [[Zeuxis]] in the 5th century BC may well be a legend, but indicates the aspiration of Greek painting. As well as accuracy in shape, light and colour, Roman paintings show an unscientific but effective knowledge of representing distant objects smaller than closer ones, and representing regular geometric forms such as the roof and walls of a room with perspective.  This progress in illusionistic effects in no way meant a rejection of idealism; statues of Greek gods and heroes attempt to represent with accuracy idealized and beautiful forms, though other works, such as heads of the famously ugly [[Socrates]], were allowed to fall below these ideal standards of beauty. [[Roman portraiture]], when not under too much Greek influence, shows a greater commitment to a truthful depiction of its subjects.

The art of [[Late Antiquity]] famously rejected illusionism for expressive force, a change already well underway by the time Christianity began to affect the art of the elite. In the West classical standards of illusionism did not begin to be reached again until the [[Late medieval]] and [[Early Renaissance]] periods, and were helped, first in the Netherlands in the early 15th century, and around the 1470s in Italy, by the development of new techniques of [[oil painting]] which allowed very subtle and precise effects of light to be painted using very small brushes and several layers of paint and glaze.  Scientific methods of representing perspective were developed in Italy in the early 15th century and gradually spread across Europe, and accuracy in anatomy rediscovered under the influence of classical art. As in classical times, [[Idealism (art)|idealism]] remained the norm.

The accurate depiction of [[landscape painting|landscape in painting]] had also been developing in Early Netherlandish/Early Northern Renaissance and Italian Renaissance painting, and was then brought to a very high level in 17th-century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], with very subtle techniques for depicting a range of weather conditions and degrees of natural light. After being another development of Early Netherlandish painting, by 1600 European portraiture could give a very good likeness in both painting and sculpture, though the subjects were often idealized by smoothing features or giving them an artificial pose. [[Still life]] paintings, and still life elements in other works, played a considerable role in developing illusionistic painting, though in the Netherlandish tradition of flower painting they long lacked "realism", in that flowers from all seasons were typically used, either from the habit of assembling compositions from individual drawings, or as a deliberate convention; the large displays of [[Flower bouquet|bouquets]] in vases, though close to modern displays of cut flowers that they have influenced, were entirely atypical of 17th-century habits, where flowers were displayed one at a time.  Intriguingly, having led the development of illusionic painting, still life was to be equally significant in its abandonment in [[Cubism]].

===Realism or naturalism as the depiction of ordinary, everyday subjects===
[[File:Simon Bening (Flemish - Gathering Twigs - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcutting, miniature from a set of [[Labours of the Months]] by [[Simon Bening]], c. 1550]]

The depiction of ordinary, everyday subjects in art also has a long history, though it was often squeezed into the edges of compositions, or shown at a smaller scale. This was partly because art was expensive, and usually commissioned for specific religious, political or personal reasons, that allowed only a relatively small amount of space or effort to be devoted to such scenes. [[Drolleries]] in the margins of medieval [[illuminated manuscripts]] sometimes contain small scenes of everyday life, and the development of perspective created large background areas in many scenes set outdoors that could be made more interesting by including small figures going about their everyday lives. Medieval and Early Renaissance art by convention usually showed non-sacred figures in contemporary dress, so no adjustment was needed for this even in religious or historical scenes set in ancient times.

Early Netherlandish painting brought the painting of portraits as low down the social scale as the prosperous merchants of [[Flanders]], and in some of these, notably the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by Jan van Eyck (1434), and more often in religious scenes such as the [[Merode Altarpiece]], by [[Robert Campin]] and his workshop (circa 1427), include very detailed depictions of middle-class interiors full of lovingly depicted objects.  However these objects are at least largely there because they carry layers of complex significance and symbolism that undercut any commitment to realism for its own sake. Cycles of the [[Labours of the Months]] in late medieval art, of which many examples survive from [[books of hours]], concentrate on peasants labouring on different tasks through the seasons, often in a rich landscape background, and were significant both in developing [[landscape art]] and the depiction of everyday working-class people.
[[File:Annibale Carracci - Butcher's Shop - WGA04409.jpg|thumb|[[Annibale Carracci]], ''The Butcher's Shop'', early 1580s]]

In the 16th century there was a fashion for the depiction in large paintings of scenes of people working, especially in food markets and kitchens: in many the food is given as much prominence as the workers. Artists included [[Pieter Aertsen]] and his nephew [[Joachim Beuckelaer]] in the Netherlands, working in an essentially Mannerist style, and in Italy the young [[Annibale Carracci]] in the 1580s, using a very down to earth unpolished style, with [[Bartolomeo Passerotti]] somewhere between the two. [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] pioneered large panoramic scenes of peasant life.  Such scenes acted as a prelude for the popularity of scenes of work in [[genre painting]] in the 17th century, which appeared all over Europe, with [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] sprouting several [[Dutch Golden Age painting#Scenes of everyday life|different subgenres]] of such scenes, the [[Bamboccianti]] (though mostly from the [[Low Countries]]) in Italy, and in Spain the genre of [[bodegones]], and the introduction of unidealized peasants into [[history paintings]] by [[Jusepe de Ribera]] and [[Velázquez]].  The [[Le Nain brothers]] in France and many Flemish artists including [[Adriaen Brouwer]] and [[David Teniers the Elder]] and [[David Teniers the Younger|Younger]] painted peasants, but rarely townsfolk. In the 18th century small paintings of working people working remained popular, mostly drawing on the Dutch tradition, and especially featuring women.

Much art depicting ordinary people, especially in the form of [[Old master print|prints]], was comic and moralistic, but the mere poverty of the subjects seems relatively rarely have been part of the moral message.  From the mid-19th century onwards this changed, and the difficulties of life for the poor were emphasized. Despite this trend coinciding with large-scale migration from the countryside to cities in most of Europe, painters still tended to paint poor rural people, largely leaving illustrators such as [[Gustave Doré]] to show the horrors of city slums.  Crowded city street scenes were popular with the Impressionists and related painters, especially ones showing Paris.

Medieval manuscript illuminators were often asked to illustrate technology, but after the Renaissance such images continued in book illustration and prints, but with the exception of [[marine painting]] largely disappeared in [[fine art]] until the early [[Industrial Revolution]], scenes from which were painted by a few painters such as [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] and [[Philip James de Loutherbourg]]. Such subjects probably failed to sell very well, and there is a noticeable absence of industry, other than a few [[railway]] scenes, in painting until the later 19th century, when works began to be commissioned, typically by industrialists or for institutions in industrial cities, often on a large scale, and sometimes given a quasi-heroic treatment.

[[American realism]], a movement of the early 20th century, is one of many modern movements to use realism in this sense.

===Realist movement===
{{main|Realism (art movement)}}
The Realist movement began in the mid-19th century as a reaction to [[Romanticism]] and [[History painting]]. In favor of depictions of 'real' life, the Realist painters used common laborers, and ordinary people in ordinary surroundings engaged in real activities as subjects for their works. Its chief exponents were [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Jean-François Millet]], [[Honoré Daumier]], and [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/sfp/noflash/realism/1941_6_1.htm |title=NGA Realism movement |publisher=Nga.gov |date=1941-01-06 |accessdate=2014-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714144138/http://www.nga.gov/collection/sfp/noflash/realism/1941_6_1.htm |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/realist-movement |title=National Gallery glossary, Realism movement |publisher=Nationalgallery.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://impressionist1877.tripod.com/realism.htm |title=Philosophy of Realism |publisher=Impressionist1877.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ross Finocchio, formerly of the Department of European Paintings at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], Realists used unprettified detail depicting the existence of ordinary contemporary life, coinciding in the contemporaneous naturalist literature of [[Émile Zola]], [[Honoré de Balzac]], and [[Gustave Flaubert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rlsm/hd_rlsm.htm |title=Nineteenth-Century French Realism &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=2014-06-02 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Realist movement had equivalents in all other Western countries, developing somewhat later. In particular the [[Peredvizhniki]] or ''Wanderers'' group in Russia who formed in the 1860s and organized exhibitions from 1871 included many realists such as [[Ilya Repin]], [[Vasily Perov]], and [[Ivan Shishkin]], and had a great influence on Russian art. In Britain artists such as [[Hubert von Herkomer]] and [[Luke Fildes]] had great success with realist paintings dealing with social issues.

===Realism or naturalism as resisting idealization===
[[File:La familia de Carlos IV.jpg|thumb|[[Francisco Goya]], ''[[Charles IV of Spain and His Family]]'', 1800–01]]

Realism or naturalism as a style meaning the honest, unidealizing depiction of the subject, can be used in depicting any type of subject, without any commitment to treating the typical or everyday.  Despite the general idealism of classical art, this too had classical precedents, which came in useful when defending such treatments in the Renaissance and [[Baroque]]. [[Demetrius of Alopece]] was a 4th-century BCE sculptor whose work (all now lost) was said to prefer realism over ideal beauty, and during the [[Ancient Roman Republic]] even politicians preferred a truthful depiction in portraits, though the early emperors favoured Greek idealism. [[Goya]]'s portraits of the Spanish royal family represent a sort of peak in the honest and downright unflattering portrayal of important persons.

A recurring trend in [[Christian art]] was "realism" that emphasized the humanity of religious figures, above all [[Christ]] and his physical sufferings in his [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]].  Following trends in [[devotional literature]], this developed in the [[Late Middle Ages]], where some painted wooden sculptures in particular strayed into the grotesque in portraying Christ covered in wounds and blood, with the intention of stimulating the viewer to meditate on the suffering that Christ had undergone on his behalf.  These were especially found in Germany and [[Central Europe]].  After abating in the Renaissance, similar works re-appeared in the [[Baroque]], especially in Spanish sculpture.

Renaissance theorists opened a debate, which was to last several centuries, as to the correct balance between drawing art from the observation of nature and from idealized forms, typically those found in classical models, or the work of other artists generally. All admitted the importance of the natural, but many believed it should be idealized to various degrees to include only the beautiful. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was one who championed the pure study of nature, and wished to depict the whole range of individual varieties of forms in the human figure and other things.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 30–32, and the whole short chapter on Leonardo&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leon Battista Alberti]] was an early idealizer, stressing the typical,&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 14–20&lt;/ref&gt; with others such as [[Michelangelo]] supporting selection of the most beautiful – he refused to make portraits for that reason.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 59–64&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henri BIVA, ca 1905-06, Matin à Villeneuve, Salon 1906 postcard - original painting, oil on canvas, 151.1 x 125.1 cm, private collection.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Henri Biva]], c. 1905–06, ''[[Matin à Villeneuve|Matin à Villeneuve (From Waters Edge)]]'', oil on canvas, 151.1 x 125.1 cm.]]
In the 17th century the debate continued, in Italy usually centred on the contrast between the relative "classical-idealism" of [[the Carracci]] and the "naturalist" style of the [[Caravaggisti]], or followers of [[Caravaggio]], who painted religious scenes as though set in the back streets of contemporary Italian cities, and used "naturalist" as a self-description. [[Bellori]], writing some decades after Caravaggio's early death, and no supporter of his style, refers to "Those who glory in the name of naturalists" (''naturalisti'').&lt;ref&gt;"Quelle che si gloriamo del nome de naturalisti", quoted in Raben, 134, note 31&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century "Naturalism" or the "'''Naturalist school'''" was somewhat artificially erected as a term representing a breakaway sub-movement of Realism, that attempted (not wholly successfully) to distinguish itself from its parent by its avoidance of politics and social issues, and liked to proclaim a quasi-scientific basis, playing on the sense of "naturalist" as a student of [[Natural history]], as the [[biological sciences]] were then generally known.  The originator of the term was the French art critic [[Jules-Antoine Castagnary]], who in 1863 announced that: "The naturalist school declares that art is the expression of life under all phases and on all levels, and that its sole aim is to reproduce nature by carrying it to its maximum power and intensity: it is truth balanced with science".&lt;ref name="Needham"&gt;Needham&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Zola]] adopted the term with a similar scientific emphasis for his aims in the novel. Much Naturalist painting covered a similar range of subject matter as that of [[Impressionism]], but using tighter, more traditional brushwork styles, and in landscapes often with more gloomy weather.&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt;

The term "continued to be used indiscriminately for various kinds of realism" for several decades, often as a catch-all term for art that was outside Impressionism and later movements of [[Modernism]] and also was not [[Academic art]].  The later periods of the French [[Barbizon School]] and the [[Düsseldorf school of painting]], with its students from many countries, and in 20th-century American [[Regionalism (art)|Regionalism]] are movements which are often also described as "Naturalist", although the term is rarely used of British painting.  Some recent art historians have deepened the confusion by claiming either Courbet or the Impressionists for the label.&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt;

==Literature==
{{Main|Literary realism}}
Broadly defined as "the faithful representation of reality",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Donna M. Campbell |url=http://www.wsu.edu/~campbelld/amlit/realism.htm |title=Realism in American Literature |publisher=Wsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Realism as a literary movement was based on "[[objective reality]]." It focused on showing everyday activities and life, primarily among the middle or lower class society, without romantic idealization or dramatization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Realism |title=Realism definition of Realism in the Free Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be regarded as the general attempt to depict subjects as they are considered to exist in third person [[objective reality]], without embellishment or interpretation and "in accordance with secular, [[empirical]] rules."&lt;ref&gt;in so far as such subjects are "explicable in terms of natural causation without resort to supernatural or divine intervention" [[#refMorris2003|Morris, 2003]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=MFAW6dh24ZwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=realism&amp;ei=ROOkS_LBA5TszASD95nXCA&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the approach inherently implies a belief that such [[reality]] is [[ontological]]ly independent of human kind's conceptual schemes, linguistic practices and beliefs, and thus can be known (or knowable) to the artist, who can in turn represent this 'reality' faithfully. As [[Ian Watt]] states, modern realism "begins from the position that truth can be discovered by the individual through the senses" and as such "it has its origins in [[Descartes]] and [[John Locke|Locke]], and received its first full formulation by [[Thomas Reid]] in the middle of the eighteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refWatt1957|Watt, 1957]], p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

While the preceding [[Romantic era]] was also a reaction against the values of the [[Industrial Revolution]], realism was in its turn a reaction to romanticism, and for this reason it is also commonly derogatorily referred as "traditional" "bourgeois realism".&lt;ref name="Barth79Replenishment"/&gt; Some writers of [[Victorian literature]] produced works of realism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victorian Literature|url=http://www.online-literature.com/periods/victorian.php|publisher=The Literature Network|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rigidities, conventions, and other limitations of "bourgeois realism," prompted in their turn the revolt later labeled as [[Modernist literature|modernism]]; starting around 1900, the driving motive of modernist literature was the criticism of the 19th-century bourgeois social order and world view, which was countered with an antirationalist, antirealist and antibourgeois program.&lt;ref name="Barth79Replenishment"&gt;[[John Barth]] (1979) ''[[The Literature of Replenishment]]'', later republished in ''[[The Friday Book]]' '(1984).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graff75"&gt;[[Gerald Graff]] (1975) ''Babbitt at the Abyss: The Social Context of Postmodern.

==Theatre==
{{Main|Theatrical realism}}
Theatrical realism is said to have first emerged in European drama in the 19th century as an offshoot of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the age of science.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Our Dramatic Heritage, Volume 6|last=Hill|first=Philip|publisher=Associated University Presses|year=1992|isbn=978-0838634219|location=Cranbury, NJ|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Making of Theatre History|last=Kuritz|first=Paul|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1988|isbn=978-0135478615|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some also specifically cited the invention of photography as the basis of the realist theater&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Art of Theatre: A Concise Introduction, 3rd edition|last=Downs|first=William|last2=Wright|first2=Lou Anne|last3=Ramsey|first3=Erik|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|year=2013|isbn=978-1111348311|location=Boston, MA|page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theatre Histories: An Introduction, 2nd edition|last=Zarrilli|first=Phillip|last2=McConachie|first2=Bruce|last3=Williams|first3=Gary Jay|last4=Sorgenfrei|first4=Carol|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=978-0415462235|location=Oxon|page=389}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others view that the association between realism and drama is far older as demonstrated by the principles of dramatic forms such as the presentation of the physical world that closely matches reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contemporary British Drama|last=Lane|first=David|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0748638215|location=Edinburgh|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The achievement of realism in the [[theatre]] was to direct attention to the social and psychological problems of ordinary life. In its dramas, people emerge as victims of forces larger than themselves, as individuals confronted with a rapidly accelerating world.&lt;ref&gt;Simard, Rodney. ''Postmodern Drama: Contemporary Playwrights in America and Britain.''  New York: UP of America, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; These pioneering playwrights were unafraid to present their characters as ordinary, impotent, and unable to arrive at answers to their predicaments. This type of art represents what we see with our human eyes. [[Anton Chekhov|Anton Chekov]], for instance, used camera works to reproduce an uninflected [[slice of life]], exposing the rhetorical and suasive character of realistic theatricality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Drama and the Rhetoric of Theater|last=Worthen|first=W.B.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0520286870|location=Berkeley, CA|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars such as Thomas Postlewait noted that throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, there were numerous joinings of [[melodrama]]tic and realistic forms and functions, which could be demonstrated in the way melodramatic elements existed in realistic forms and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Theatre|last=Saxon|first=Theresa|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0748645206|location=Edinburgh|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, realism in drama preceded fictional realism by about two decades as theater historians identified the first impetus toward realism during the late 1870s and early 1880s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Realism and American Drama, 1880–1940|last=Murphy|first=Brenda|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|isbn=978-0521327114|location=Cambridge|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its development is also attributed to [[William Dean Howells]] and [[Henry James]] who served as the spokesmen for realism as well as articulator of its aesthetic principles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The realistic approach to theater collapsed into [[nihilism]] and the [[Absurdism|absurd]] after World War II.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

==Cinema==
{{See also|Neorealism (art)|Poetic realism|Socialist realism}}

[[Italian Neorealism]] was a cinematic movement incorporating elements of realism that developed in post-WWII Italy. Notable Neorealists included [[Vittorio De Sica]], [[Luchino Visconti]], and [[Roberto Rossellini]]. Realist films generally focus on social issues.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Realism" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of realism in film: seamless realism and aesthetic realism. Seamless realism tries to use narrative structures and film techniques to create a "reality effect" to maintain its [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Realism" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35&lt;/ref&gt; Aesthetic realism, which was first called for by French filmmakers in the 1930s and promoted by [[Andre Bazin]] in the 1950s, acknowledges that a "film cannot be fixed to mean what it shows", as there are multiple realisms; as such, these filmmakers use location shooting, natural light and non-professional actors to ensure the viewer can make up her/his own choice based on the film, rather than being manipulated into a "preferred reading".&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Realism" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35&lt;/ref&gt; [[Siegfried Kracauer]] is also notable for arguing that realism is the most important function of cinema.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dudley Andrew]], ''The Major Film Theories: An Introduction'', Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press, 1976, Part II.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aesthetic realist filmmakers use [[long shot]]s, [[deep focus]] and eye-level 90 degree shots to reduce manipulation of what the viewer sees.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Realism" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35&lt;/ref&gt; Italian neorealism filmmakers from after WWII took the existing realist film approaches from France and Italy that emerged in the 1960s and used the to create a politically-oriented cinema. French filmmakers made some politically-oriented realist films in the 1960s, such as the [[cinéma vérité]] and documentary films of [[Jean Rouch]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Realism" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. pp. 334–35&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s and 1960s, British, French and German new waves of filmmaking produced "slice-of-life" films (e.g., [[kitchen sink drama]]s in the UK).&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan.

==Opera==
{{main|Verismo}}
Verismo was a post-Romantic operatic tradition associated with Italian composers such as [[Pietro Mascagni]], [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]], [[Umberto Giordano]], [[Francesco Cilea]] and [[Giacomo Puccini]]. They sought to bring the naturalism of influential late 19th-century writers such as [[Émile Zola]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], and [[Henrik Ibsen]] into opera. This new style presented true-to-life drama that featured gritty and flawed lower-class protagonists&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Chronology Of Western Classical Music 1600-2000|last=Paxman|first=Jon|publisher=Omnibus Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1783231218|location=London|pages=425–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some described it as a heightened portrayal of a realistic event.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Tanner's Worth of Tune: Rediscovering the Post-war British Musical|last=Wright|first=Adrian|publisher=The Boydell Press|year=2010|isbn=978-1843835424|location=Suffolk, UK|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although an account considered [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Luisa Miller]]'' and ''[[La traviata|La Traviata]]'' as the first stirrings of the verismo,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tosca|last=Carner|first=Mosco|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1993|isbn=978-0521228244|location=Cambridge|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; some claimed that it began in 1890 with the first performance of [[Pietro Mascagni|Mascagni]]'s ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'', peaked in the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;"Verismo" in Stanley Sadie (ed.) ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music &amp; Musicians'', London: Macmillan/New York: Grove, 1980, vol. 19 p. 670, {{ISBN|1561591742}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by Leoncavallo's Pagliacci, which dealt with the themes of infidelity, revenge, and violence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Verismo also reached Britain where pioneers included the [[Victorian era|Victorian-era]] theatrical partnership of the [[dramatist]] [[W. S. Gilbert]] and the composer [[Arthur Sullivan]] (1842–1900).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Specifically, their play ''[[Iolanthe]]'' is considered a realistic representation of the nobility although it included fantastical elements.

'''"Revolving Door"''' is a famous [[Attack ad|negative television commercial]] made for the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 United States Presidential Campaign]]. Along with the [[Willie Horton]] "Weekend Passes" advertisement, it is considered to be a prime factor in [[George H.W. Bush]]'s defeat of [[Michael Dukakis]].  The ad was produced by political consultant [[Roger Ailes]] with help by [[Lee Atwater]], and first aired on October 5, 1988. "Revolving door syndrome" is a term used in criminology to refer to [[recidivism]]; however, in the ad, the implication is that prison sentences were of an inconsequential length.

==Synopsis==
The ad shows a line of convicts (portrayed by actors) casually walking in and out of a [[prison]] (filmed in [[Draper, Utah]]) by means of a [[revolving door]]. The narration states that as [[Governor of Massachusetts|governor]] of [[Massachusetts]], Dukakis vetoed [[Mandatory sentencing|mandatory minimum]] sentencing for [[drug dealers]], that he vetoed the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]], and that he gave weekend [[furlough]]s to first-degree murderers. The narrator goes on to point out that while furloughed, many of the convicts committed crimes including [[kidnapping]] and [[rape]], and are still at large. The ad concludes with the phrase: "Now Michael Dukakis says he wants to do for America what he's done for Massachusetts. America can't afford that risk." The disclaimer at the end indicates the ad was paid for and endorsed by the [[George H. W. Bush|Bush]]/[[Dan Quayle|Quayle]] campaign.

==Impact==
A [[CBS News]]/[[New York Times]] poll showed that of all of the political ads of the 1988 presidential campaign, this one had the greatest impact on respondents. The percentage of poll respondents who felt Bush was "tough enough" on crime rose from 23 percent in July 1988 to 61 percent in late October 1988 while the proportion saying Dukakis was "not tough enough" on crime rose from 36 to 49 percent during the same period.&lt;ref name="Inside"&gt;{{cite web | author=InsidePolitics | title=Candidate Ads: 1988 George Bush "Revolving Door"| url=http://www.insidepolitics.org/ps111/candidateads.html | accessdate=2006-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women particularly were affected by the ad. Said Dukakis campaign manager [[Susan Estrich]], "The symbolism was very powerful...you can't find a stronger metaphor, intended or not, for racial hatred in this country than a black man raping a white woman....I talked to people afterward....Women said they couldn't help it, but it scared the living daylights out of them."&lt;ref name="Inside"/&gt;

==Furlough program==
The original State inmate furlough program, for which convicted first-degree murderers were ineligible, was actually signed into law by Republican Governor [[Francis W. Sargent]] in 1972.  After the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that this right extended to first-degree murderers, the Massachusetts legislature quickly passed a bill prohibiting furloughs for such inmates.  However, in 1976, Dukakis [[veto]]ed this bill. The program remained in effect through the intervening term of governor [[Edward J. King]] and was abolished during Dukakis' final term of office on April 28, 1988. This abolition only occurred after the ''[[The Eagle-Tribune|Lawrence Eagle Tribune]]'' had run 175 stories about the furlough program and won a [[Pulitzer Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://backissues.cjrarchives.org/year/95/2/pulitzers.asp |title=So What?|website=Columbia Journalism Review|year=1995|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123173623/http://backissues.cjrarchives.org/year/95/2/pulitzers.asp|archivedate=2008-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dukakis continued to argue that the program was 99 percent effective; yet, as the ''Lawrence Eagle Tribune'' pointed out, no state outside of Massachusetts, nor any federal program, would grant a furlough to a prisoner serving life without parole.

In the [[Illinois gubernatorial election, 2014|2014 Illinois governors' race]], Republican gubernatorial candidate (and eventual governor) [[Bruce Rauner]] created an attack ad entitled "Unthinkable," alleging that then-governor [[Pat Quinn (politician)|Pat Quinn]] "secretly" released 230+ violent offenders early, such as wife-beaters, rapists, sex offenders, and murderers.  The ad went on to say that the consequences were "unthinkable": sexual assault of a minor, aggravated assaults, domestic abuse, and more murders.  The video ends with the voiceover saying "Now Pat Quinn Wants Four More Years?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhNq_1Y-sWM |title=Bruce Rauner: Unthinkable}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sabantuy''' is a [[Bashkirs|Bashkir]], [[Idel-Ural]]ian and [[Tatars|Tatar]] summer [[festival]], that dates back to the [[Volga Bulgaria]]n epoch. At first Sabantuy was a festival of [[farmer]]s in rural areas, but it later became a [[Public holiday|national holiday]] and now is widely celebrated in the [[city|cities]]. In 2012, [[Kazan]] Sabantuy was celebrated on June 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drayton|first=James|title=Sabantuy|url=http://hometoroam.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/sabantuy.html|work=home to roam|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nomenclature ==
[[Tatar language|Tatar]]-speakers call the holiday ''Sabantuy'' (Сабантуй, {{IPA-tt|sʌbɑnˈtuɪ|}}), or, more correctly, '''Saban tuyı''' (Сабан туе, {{IPA|[sʌˈbɑn tuˈjɯ]}}) - plural form: ''Sabantuylar'' {{IPA|[sʌbɑntuɪˈlɑr]}}.

Other [[Turkic peoples]] living along the [[Volga]] also celebrate the holiday. [[Bashkir language|Bashkir]]-speakers call it '''Habantuy''' (Һабантуй), [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]]-speakers — '''Akatuy''' (Акатуй).

The [[holiday]]'s name means "[[plough]]'s [[Festival|feast]]" in [[Turkic languages]]. The synonym "plough's holiday", or '''Saban bäyräme''' (Сабан бәйрәме {{IPA|[sʌˈbɑn bæɪræˈme]}}) also occurs.

==History==
Sabantuy traces its origins to the pre-[[Islam]]ic epoch, when it was celebrated before the [[sowing]] season. The presence of Sabantuy was noticed by [[ibn Fadlan]] as early as in 921. Traditional [[song]]s and other customs of the Sabantuy probably had a religious connotation at that time. 

Later, with the spread of [[Islam]] among [[Tatars]] and [[Bashkirs]] and [[Christianity]] among [[Chuvash people|Chuvashs]], it became a [[secular holiday]]. In each region, [[village]]s took turns to celebrate the holiday.

In the beginning of the 20th century Sabantuy gained recognition as the national festival of the Tatars. The [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities approved of this festival probably due to its humble rural origin. However, they moved Sabantuy to the after-sowing season, thus merging it with the ancient summer festival ''[[Cıyın]]'' (Cyrillic: Җыен, {{IPA|[ʑɯɪˈɯn]}}). 

Recently, Moscow announced plans to nominate Sabantuy for the inclusion into the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] list in 2007.

==Traditions==
The main distinctive elements of Sabantuy include the traditional sporting competitions such as ''[[köräş]]'' (Tatar wrestling), horse racing, race-in-sack, pillar-climbing, egg-in-spoon-in-mouth-racing, sacks-battle on the crossbar, pot smashing [http://www.ogoniok.com/common/archive/1996/4459/28-10-11/28-11-1b.gif], finding a coin in a ''qatıq'' (a beverage made from sour milk), and other contests. Such activities take place on the ''[[:wikt:mäydan|mäydan]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Мәйдан; {{IPA|[mæɪˈdɑn]}}; also ''maydan'', майдан, {{IPA|[mʌɪˈdɑn]}} in spoken language&lt;/ref&gt; which would usually be located at the edge of a forest.

A tradition, called ''sörän'',&lt;ref&gt;Сөрән; {{IPA|[sœˈræn]}}&lt;/ref&gt; was held to collect a fare for guests of the festival and prizes for the winners of the contests. ''Qarğa botqası'' (Rook's porridge),&lt;ref&gt;Карга боткасы, {{IPA|[qʌrˈɣɑ bɔtqɑˈsɯ]}}&lt;/ref&gt; a ritual porridge, was cooked before the Sabantuy to treat children in the village. Another tradition was praying at the cemetery.

In the recent years Sabantuy is also often combined with the [[Music of Tatarstan|folk and pop music festivals]], as well as accordion music festivals, named ''Play, accordion!'' (''Uyna, ğarmun!'').

===[[Kurash]]===
[[File:Көрәш.JPG|thumb|Kurash ([[Tatar language|Tatar:]]Көрәш) on a Sabantuy in [[Ulyanovsk]]]]
The [[wrestling]] [[Kurash]], is the main competition of Sabantuy. Wrestlers use [[towel]]s and the aim is to knock down the opponent.

Usually young boys start the competition. At the end of Sabantuy, the main event of the festival is the final of köräş. The winner becomes the ''[[batır]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{IPA|[bʌˈtɯr]}}, also батыр ''batyr,'' паттӑр ''pattăr''&lt;/ref&gt; the hero of the Sabantuy. The prize varies from a [[Sheep|ram]] in small villages to a [[car]] at big cities' celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drayton|first=James|title=Sabantuy|url=http://hometoroam.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/sabantuy.html|work=home to roam|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calendar of the festival===
Sabantuylar do not have a set date. The festivities take place approximately from June 15 to July 1, and usually fall on a Sunday. Initially, Sabantuylar are arranged in villages, followed by Sabantuylar in rural districts, and the final ones taking place in major cities. The last Sabantuy is held in [[Kazan]], the capital of [[Tatarstan]]. A similar schedule is applied for Akatuy in [[Chuvashia Republic|Chuvashia]] and Habantuy in [[Bashkortostan]].

In the last few years the Russian government arranged [[Russian Federation|federal]] Sabantuylar in Moscow.  Many cities in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] that have major Tatar diasporas, such as [[Moscow]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Tallinn]], [[Prague]], [[Istanbul]], [[Kiev]] and [[Tashkent]], also hold Sabantuylar.

Today Sabantuy can be characterized as an international festival attracting many people of various ethnicities who participate in Sabanuylar, both in Tatarstan, and all over the world.

==Political traditions==
Sabantuy is a symbol of [[Tatarstan]]. This is why every Russian president visiting the republic takes part in the Sabantuy held in Kazan. During his visit to Kazan in the mid-1990s [[Boris Yeltsin]] became the center of attention at a Sabantuy when he took part in a traditional competition in which the participants try to crash a clay pot while being blindfolded. [[Vladimir Putin]] took part in a humorous competition during which he tried to dip his face into a jar full of [[Soured milk|sour milk]] in order to fish out a coin without using his hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://2001.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2001/41n/n41n-s07.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scientology''' is a [[Scientology beliefs and practices|body of religious beliefs and practices]] launched in May 1952 by American author [[L. Ron Hubbard]] (1911–86). Hubbard initially developed a program of ideas called [[Dianetics]], which was distributed through the Dianetics Foundation. The foundation soon entered bankruptcy, and Hubbard lost the rights to his seminal publication ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'' in 1952. He then recharacterized the subject as a religion and renamed it Scientology,&lt;ref name="metro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/03/13/l-ron-hubbards-birthday-who-was-he-and-what-is-scientology-5747353/|publisher=metro.co.uk|title=L Ron Hubbard's Birthday: Who was he and what is Scientology? &amp;#124; Metro News|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; retaining the terminology, doctrines, the [[E-meter]], and the practice of [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smi.org/features/glossary/ |title=Scientology glossary |accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Melton28"&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|pp=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a year, he regained the rights to Dianetics and retained both subjects under the umbrella of the [[Church of Scientology]].&lt;ref name="TimeVenus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ehca"&gt;{{cite book |author=Melton, J.

Hubbard describes the etymology of the word Scientology as coming from the Latin word "scio", meaning know or distinguish, and the Greek word "logos", meaning "the word or outward form by which the inward thought is expressed and made known". Hubbard writes, "thus, Scientology means knowing about knowing, or science of knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rethinking Scientology A Thorough Analysis of L.

Hubbard's groups have encountered considerable opposition and controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reitman |first1=Janet |title=Inside Scientology: The Story of America's Most Secretive Religion |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |year=2011 |isbn=9780547549231 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 1951, the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners brought proceedings against Dianetics Foundation on the charge of teaching medicine without a license.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=umep6P6dYLAC&amp;pg=PA532 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903232811/https://books.google.com/books?id=umep6P6dYLAC&amp;pg=PA532 |archivedate=September 3, 2016 |df= |isbn=9781462712618 |last1=Lebron |first1=Robyn E |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard's followers engaged in a [[Operation Snow White|program of criminal infiltration]] of the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]].&lt;ref name="urban2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="urban2008" /&gt;

Hubbard-inspired organizations and their classification are often a point of contention. [[Scientology in Germany|Germany]] classifies Scientology groups as an "anti-constitutional sect".&lt;ref name="spiegel.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/hubbard-s-church-unconstitutional-germany-prepares-to-ban-scientology-a-522052.html|publisher=spiegel.de|title=Hubbard's Church 'Unconstitutional': Germany Prepares to Ban Scientology - SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="assemblee-nationale.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/rap-enq/r2468.asp|publisher=assemblee-nationale.fr|title= National Assembly of France report No. 2468 |accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scientology in France|France]], they have been classified as a dangerous [[cult]] by some parliamentary reports.&lt;ref&gt;A 1995 [[French Parliament|parliamentary]] report lists Scientology groups as [[cult]]s, and in its 2006 report [[MIVILUDES]] similarly classified Scientology organizations as a dangerous [[cult]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NouvelObs"&gt;[http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/societe/20090525.OBS8000/le-point-sur-l-eglise-de-scientologie.html Le point sur l'Eglise de Scientologie], Le Nouvel Observateur&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hubbard and moulton.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Two men in naval uniform|L. Ron Hubbard and Thomas S. Moulton in Portland, Oregon in 1943]]

[[L. Ron Hubbard]] (1911–1986) was the only child of Harry Ross Hubbard, a United States Navy officer, and his wife, Ledora Waterbury. Hubbard spent three semesters at George Washington University but was placed on probation in September 1931. He failed to return for the fall 1932 semester.&lt;ref name="Wallis-21"&gt;Wallis, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1941, Hubbard was commissioned as a Lieutenant ([[junior grade]]) in the U.S. Naval Reserve. On May 18, 1943, his [[USS PC-815|subchaser]] left Portland. That night, Hubbard ordered his crew to fire 35 depth charges and a number of gun rounds at what he believed were Japanese submarines.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; His ship sustained minor damage and three crew were injured. Having run out of depth charges and with the presence of a submarine still unconfirmed by other ships, Hubbard's ship was ordered back to port. A navy report concluded that "there was no submarine in the area." A decade later, Hubbard claimed in his Scientology lectures that he had sunk a Japanese submarine.&lt;ref name="CRA Triangle"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hubbard | first=L. Ron | title=CRA Triangle | date= October 23, 1956 | series = Fifteenth American Advanced Clinical Lectures | publisher=Golden Era Publications|location=Los Angeles, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 28, 1943, Hubbard ordered his crew to fire on the [[Coronado Islands]]. Hubbard apparently did not realize that the islands belonged to US-allied [[Mexico]], nor that he had taken his vessel into Mexican territorial waters.&lt;ref name="Miller-139"&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; He was reprimanded and removed from command on July 7.&lt;ref name="Miller-139" /&gt; After reassignment to a naval facility in Monterey, California, Hubbard became depressed and fell ill. Reporting stomach pains in April 1945, he spent the remainder of the war as a patient in [[Oak Knoll Naval Hospital]] in Oakland, California.&lt;ref name="Atack-82"&gt;[[#Atack|Atack]], p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; According to his later teachings, during this time Hubbard made scientific "breakthroughs" by use of "endocrine experiments".&lt;ref name="wiseoldgoat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiseoldgoat.com/papers-scientology/popup-windows/scn_summary_scn_for_scientists_69.html|publisher=wiseoldgoat.com|title=A Summary on Scientology for Scientists (1969)|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 15, 1947, Hubbard wrote a letter to the Veterans Administration formally requesting psychiatric treatment, but admitted that he was unable to afford it.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Bare-Faced Messiah: The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard|author=Miller, R.|date=2016|publisher=Silvertail Books|isbn=9781909269361|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tz0LjwEACAAJ|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few years, Hubbard would condemn psychiatry as evil, which would grow into a major theme in Scientology.

===''Excalibur'' and Babalon Working===
{{main|Scientology and the occult}}
In April 1938, Hubbard reportedly reacted to a drug used in a dental procedure. According to his account, this triggered a revelatory [[near-death experience]]. Allegedly inspired by this experience, Hubbard composed a manuscript, which was never published, with the working titles of "The One Command" or ''[[Excalibur (L. Ron Hubbard)|Excalibur]]''.&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/01/24/170010096/going-clear-a-new-book-delves-into-scientology|publisher=npr.org|title='Going Clear': A New Book Delves Into Scientology: NPR|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lermanet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lermanet.com/excalibur/|publisher=lermanet.com|title=The History of Excalibur|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contents of ''Excalibur'' formed the basis for some of his later publications.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, "The Anatomy Of Thought". Hubbard Communication Office Policy Letter 26 April 1970R, revised March 15, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur J. Burks]], who read the work in 1938, later recalled it discussed the "one command": to survive. This theme would be revisited in Dianetics, the set of ideas and practices regarding the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] relationship between the mind and body which became the central philosophy of Scientology.&lt;ref name="american-buddha"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.american-buddha.com/cult.yesbookcalledexcalibur.htm|publisher=american-buddha.com|title=PunʞLawyer |accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard later cited ''Excalibur'' as an early version of Dianetics.&lt;ref name="tonyortega.org"&gt;Letter to Forrest Ackerman January 13, 1949, "THE SCIENCE OF MIND, really EXCALIBUR" quoted by http://tonyortega.org/2014/10/23/l-ron-hubbard-explains-to-a-friend-the-real-reason-he-wrote-dianetics/&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=November 2015}}

In August 1945, Hubbard moved into the [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] mansion of [[Jack Parsons (rocket propulsion engineer)|John "Jack" Whiteside Parsons]], an avid [[occultism|occultist]] and [[Thelema|Thelemite]], follower of the English ceremonial magician [[Aleister Crowley]] and leader of a lodge of Crowley's [[magical order]], [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (OTO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Going_Clear.html|title=Google Books|website=books.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller-113"&gt;Miller, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons and Hubbard collaborated on the "[[Babalon Working]]", a [[sex magic]] ritual intended to summon an incarnation of [[Babalon]], the supreme Thelemite Goddess.&lt;ref name="urban2006"&gt;Urban, Hugh B.

Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-520-24776-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of Scientology admits to Hubbard's involvement with Parsons while claiming that it was for the purpose of naval intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first1=Lawrence |title=Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood and the Prison of Belief |publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group |year=2013 |isbn=9780385350273 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1940s, Hubbard practiced as a hypnotist&lt;ref name="secretlives"&gt;{{cite episode|

More complex studies include [[Roy Wallis|Roy Wallis's]] ''The Road to Total Freedom''.&lt;ref name=Gutjahr/&gt;

Dianetics appealed to a broad range of people who used instructions from the book and applied the method to each other, becoming practitioners themselves.&lt;ref name="Melton9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GA172" /&gt; Dianetics soon met with criticism. [[Morris Fishbein]], the editor of the ''Journal of the American Medical Association'' and well-known at the time as a debunker of [[quack medicine]], dismissed Hubbard's book.&lt;ref name="Melton13"&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first1=James R.|title=Scientology |location=USA |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article in Newsweek stated that "the Dianetics concept is unscientific and unworthy of discussion or review".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Poor Man's Psychoanalysis?|publisher=[[Newsweek]]|date=November 6, 1950 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard asserted that Dianetics is "an organized science of thought built on definite axioms: statements of natural laws on the order of those of the physical sciences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carroll |first1=Robert |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6FPqDFx40vYC&amp;dq=dianetics+science |title=The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions |accessdate=November 23, 2015|isbn=9781118045633 |date=2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard became the leader of a growing Dianetics movement.&lt;ref name="Melton9" /&gt; He became a popular lecturer and established the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], where he trained his first Dianetics counselors or ''auditors''.&lt;ref name="Melton9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GA172"&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|Bromley|2006|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Campbell and Winter (who was still hopeful of winning support for Dianetics from the medical community) championed a resolution to ban the topic.&lt;ref name="Melton10" /&gt;--&gt;

Some practitioners of Dianetics reported experiences which they believed had occurred in past lives, or previous incarnations.&lt;ref name="GA172" /&gt; In early 1951, [[reincarnation]] became a subject of intense debate within the Dianetics community.&lt;ref name="Melton10"&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard took the reports of past life events seriously and introduced the concept of the ''[[thetan]]'', an immortal being analogous to the [[soul]].&lt;ref name="GA172" /&gt; This was an important factor in the transition from secular Dianetics to the religion of Scientology. Sociologists [[Roy Wallis]] and Steve Bruce suggest that Dianetics, which set each person as his or her own authority, was about to fail due to its inherent individualism, and that Hubbard started Scientology as a religion to establish himself as the overarching authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=3711319| title = The Stark-Bainbridge Theory of Religion: A Critical Analysis and Counter Proposals | journal = Sociological Analysis | date = Spring 1984 | first = Roy | last = Wallis |author2=Steve Bruce  | volume = 45 | issue = 1 | page = 24 | doi=10.2307/3711319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, Roy. 1975.

Also in 1951, Hubbard incorporated the ''[[electropsychometer]]'' ([[E-meter]] for short), a kind of [[electrodermal activity]] meter, as an auditing aid.&lt;ref name="Melton10"/&gt; Based on a design by [[Volney Mathison]], the device is held by Scientologists to be a useful tool in detecting changes in a person's state of mind.&lt;ref name="Melton10" /&gt; The global spread of Scientology at the latter half of the 1950s was culminated with the opening of churches in Johannesburg and Paris, while world headquarters transferred to England in Saint Hill, a rural estate. Hubbard lived there for the next seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first1=James R. |title=Scientology |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dianetics is different from Scientology in that Scientology is a religion while Dianetics is not. The purpose of Dianetics is the improvement of the individual, the individual or "self" being only one of eight "dynamics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chryssides |first1=George D. |last2=Wilkins |first2=Margaret |title=A Reader in New Religious Movements: Readings in the Study of New Religious Movements |publisher=Bloomsbery Academic |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; "According to Hugh B. Urban, Hubbard's early science of Dianetics would be best comprehended as a "bricolage that brought together his various explorations in psychology, hypnosis, and science fiction." If Dianetics is understood as a bricolage, then Scientology is "an even more ambitious sort of religious bricolage adapted to the new religious marketplace of 1950s America," continues Urban. According to Roy Wallis, "Scientology emerged as a religious commodity eminently suited to the contemporary market of postwar America." L. Ron Hubbard Jr. said in an interview that the spiritual bricolage of Scientology, as written by Hugh B. Urban, "seemed to be uniquely suited to the individualism and quick-fix mentality of 1950s America: just by doing a few assignments, "one can become a god." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Urban |first1=Hugh B. |title=The Church of Scientology: A History of a New Religion |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2011 |isbn=9780691146089 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harlan Ellison]] has told a story of seeing Hubbard at a gathering of the [[Hydra Club]] in 1953 or 1954. Hubbard was complaining of not being able to make a living on what he was being paid as a science fiction writer. Ellison says that [[Lester del Rey]] told Hubbard that what he needed to do to get rich was start a religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Underdown |first1=James |authorlink1=James Underdown |title='I Was There...': Harlan Ellison Witnesses the Birth of Scientology |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=6 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1951, the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners began proceedings against the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation for teaching medicine without a license, which eventually led to that foundation's bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flowers|1984|pp=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Streissguth ''Charismatic Cult Leaders'', p. 70, The Oliver Press Inc., 1996 {{ISBN|978-1-881508-18-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Malko ''Scientology: the now religion'', p. 58, Delacorte Press, 1970 ASIN B0006CAHJ6&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 1952, the Hubbard Dianetic Foundation filed for bankruptcy, and Hubbard lost control of the Dianetics trademark and copyrights to financier Don Purcell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tonyortega.org/2014/08/21/jon-atack-the-games-l-ron-hubbard-played/|title=Jon Atack: The games L.

L. Ron Hubbard originally intended for Scientology to be considered a science, as stated in his writings. In May 1952, Scientology was organized to put this intended science into practice, and in the same year, Hubbard published a new set of teachings as ''Scientology, a religious philosophy.''&lt;ref&gt;Christian D. Von Dehsen-Scott L. Harris ''Philosophers and Religious Leaders'', p. 90, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999 {{ISBN|978-1-57356-152-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marco Frenschkowski quotes Hubbard in a letter written in 1953, to show that he never denied that his original approach was not a religious one: "Probably the greatest discovery of Scientology and its most forceful contribution to mankind has been the isolation, description and handling of the human spirit, accomplished in July, 1951, in Phoenix, Arizona. I established, along scientific rather than religious or humanitarian lines that the thing which is the person, the personality, is separable from the body and the mind at will and without causing bodily death or derangement. (Hubbard 1983: 55)."&lt;ref name="Frenschkowski 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Images of Religions and Religious History in the Works of L.

In April 1953, Hubbard wrote a letter proposing that Scientology should be transformed into a religion.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; As membership declined and finances grew tighter, Hubbard had reversed the hostility to religion he voiced in ''Dianetics''.&lt;ref name=creation&gt;Kent, Stephen A. "The Creation of 'Religious' Scientology." ''Religious Studies and Theology'' '''18''':2, pp. 97–126. 1999. ISSN 1747-5414&lt;/ref&gt; His letter discussed the legal and financial benefits of religious status.&lt;ref name=creation /&gt; Hubbard outlined plans for setting up a chain of "Spiritual Guidance Centers" charging customers $500 for twenty-four hours of auditing ("That is real money&amp;nbsp;... Charge enough and we'd be swamped."). He wrote:

{{quote|I await your reaction on the religion angle. In my opinion, we couldn't get worse public opinion than we have had or have less customers with what we've got to sell. A religious charter would be necessary in Pennsylvania or NJ to make it stick. But I sure could make it stick.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. Letter of April 10, 1953. Quoted in Miller, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In December 1953, Hubbard incorporated three churches&amp;nbsp;– a "Church of American Science", a "Church of Scientology" and a "Church of Spiritual Engineering"&amp;nbsp;– in [[Camden, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="Bare-faced Messiah220"&gt;{{cite book|author=Miller, Russell|title=Bare-faced Messiah, The True Story of L.

Ron Hubbard."&lt;ref name="Bare-faced Messiah220"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Melton11"&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement spread quickly through the United States and to other English-speaking countries such as Britain, Ireland, South Africa and Australia.&lt;ref name="Melton12" /&gt; The second local Church of Scientology to be set up, after the one in California, was in [[Auckland, New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="Melton12"&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, Hubbard established the [[L. Ron Hubbard House|Founding Church of Scientology]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref name="GA172"/&gt; The group declared that the Founding Church, as written in the certificate of incorporation for the Founding Church of Scientology in the District of Columbia, was to "act as a parent church for the religious faith known as 'Scientology' and to act as a church for the religious worship of the faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zald |first1=Mayer N. |last2=McCarthy |first2=John David |title=Social Movements in an Organizational Society: Collected Essays |publisher=Transaction Publishers |date=1987 |isbn=9780887388026  |url= {{Google books|id=dVHJAgAAQBAJ|page=78|plainurl=yes}}}}{{better source|reason= looking at p 78 of source Zald, it's clear they're quoting p 89 of a source named Stoner, so this is still not the entirely correct way to do this citation|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church experienced further challenges. The United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) began an investigation concerning the claims the Church of Scientology made in connection with its E-meters.&lt;ref name="Melton13" /&gt; On January 4, 1963, FDA agents raided offices of the Church of Scientology, seizing hundreds of E-meters as illegal medical devices and tons of literature that they accused of making false medical claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Hidden Story of Scientology|last = Garrison|first = Omar V.|publisher = Citadel Press, Lyle Suart, Inc.|year = 1974|isbn = 978-0-8065-0440-7|location = Secaucus, NJ|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original suit by the FDA to condemn the literature and E-meters did not succeed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The hidden Story of Scientology|last = Garrison|first = Omar V.|publisher = Citadel Press, Lyle Stuart, Inc.|year = 1974|isbn = 978-0-8065-0440-7|location = Secaucus, MJ|pages=136, 142}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Court ordered the Church to label every meter with a disclaimer that it is purely religious artifact,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/E-Meter/Mark-VII/ |title=1963 FDA raid |publisher=Cs.cmu.edu |date=January 4, 1963 |accessdate=September 4, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019110136/http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/E-Meter/Mark-VII/ |archivedate=October 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to post a $20,000 bond of compliance, and to pay the FDA's legal expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Hidden Story of Scientology|last = Garrison|first = Omar V.|publisher = Citadel Press, Lyle Stuart, Inc.|year = 1974|isbn = 978-0-8065-0440-7|location = Secaucus, NJ|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of developing Scientology, Hubbard presented rapidly changing teachings that some have seen as often self-contradictory.&lt;ref name="lindholm" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallis|first=Roy|title=The Road to Total Freedom|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|year=1977|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lindholm, for the inner cadre of Scientologists in that period, involvement depended not so much on belief in a particular doctrine but on unquestioning faith in Hubbard.&lt;ref name="lindholm"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lindholm|first=Charles|year=1992|title=Charisma, Crowd Psychology and Altered States of Consciousness|journal=Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry|volume=16|issue=3|pages=287–310|doi=10.1007/BF00052152|ref=harv|hdl=2144/3836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Hubbard purportedly stepped down as executive director of Scientology to devote himself to research and writing.&lt;ref name="GA172" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Neusner225"&gt;{{harvnb|DeChant|Jorgenson|2003|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year, he formed the ship-based Sea Organization or [[Sea Org]] which operated three ships:  the ''Diana'', the ''Athena'', and the flagship the ''Apollo''.&lt;ref name="GA172" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Melton17"&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One month after the establishment of the Sea Org, Hubbard announced that he had made a breakthrough discovery, the result of which were the "[[OT III]]" materials purporting to provide a method for overcoming factors inhibiting spiritual progress.&lt;ref name="Melton17" /&gt; These materials were first disseminated on the ships, and then propagated by Sea Org members reassigned to staff Advanced Organizations on land.&lt;ref name="Melton17" /&gt;

===Hubbard in hiding, death, and aftermath===
In 1972, facing criminal charges in France, Hubbard returned to the United States and began living in an apartment in [[Queens]], New York.&lt;ref name="tonyortega"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tonyortega.org/2015/02/16/the-paranoid-depressed-l-ron-hubbard-jim-dincalcis-1997-secret-lives-tv-interview/|publisher=tonyortega.org|title=The paranoid, depressed L. Ron Hubbard: Jim Dincalci's 1997 'Secret Lives' TV interview ' The Underground Bunker|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When faced with possible indictment in the United States, Hubbard went into hiding in April 1979.  He hid first in an apartment in [[Hemet, California]], where his only contact with the outside world was via ten trusted Messengers. He cut contact with everyone else, even his wife, whom he saw for the last time in August 1979.&lt;ref name="Atack-258"&gt;Atack, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 1980 he disappeared into deep cover in the company of two trusted Messengers, Pat and Anne Broeker.&lt;ref name="Atack-259"&gt;Atack, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller-364"&gt;Miller, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, as a result of FBI raids during [[Operation Snow White]], eleven senior people in the church's Guardian's Office were convicted of obstructing justice, burglary of government offices, and theft of documents and government property. In 1981, Scientology took the German government to court for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Amveck ''Researching New Religious Movements'', p. 261, Routledge, 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-415-27754-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, 1986, L. Ron Hubbard died at his ranch in [[Creston, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newtimesslo.com/cover/2628/l-ron-hubbards-last-refuge/ L.

While ''Scientology'' generally refers to [[David Miscavige|Miscavige]]-led [[Church of Scientology]], other groups practice Scientology. These groups, collectively known as Independent Scientologists, consist of former members of the official Church of Scientology as well as entirely new members.

In 1950, founding member Joseph Winter cut ties with Hubbard and set up a private Dianetics practice in New York.&lt;ref name="cmu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/wallis/wallis1.txt|publisher=cs.cmu.edu|title=~dst/Library/Shelf/wallis/wallis1|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1965, a longtime Church member and "Doctor of Scientology" Jack Horner (born 1927), dissatisfied with the Church's "ethics" program, developed Dianology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Melton|first1=J.

==Beliefs and practices==
{{Main|Scientology beliefs and practices}}

According to Scientology, its beliefs and practices are based on rigorous research, and its doctrines are accorded a significance equivalent to scientific laws.&lt;ref name="GA170-171"&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|Bromley|2006|pp=170–171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientology cosmology is, however, at odds with modern science, with claims of memories going back "76 trillion years":&lt;ref name=lrh07&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hubbard|first1=L.

Blind belief is held to be of lesser significance than the practical application of Scientologist methods.&lt;ref name="GA170-171" /&gt; Adherents are encouraged to validate the practices through their personal experience.&lt;ref name="GA170-171" /&gt; Hubbard put it this way: "For a Scientologist, the final test of any knowledge he has gained is, 'did the data and the use of it in life actually improve conditions or didn't it?{{Single double}}&lt;ref name="GA170-171" /&gt; He defined Scientology's aims as: "A civilization without insanity, without criminals and without war; where the world can prosper and honest beings can have rights, and where man is free to rise to greater heights, are the aims of Scientology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilkins |first1=Margaret |last2=Chryssides |first2=George D. |title=A Reader in New Religious Movements: Readings in the Study of New Religious Movements |publisher=A&amp;C Black |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kent |first1=Stephen A. |title=From Slogans to Mantras: Social Protest and Religious Conversion in the Late Vietnam War Era |publisher=Syracuse University Pres |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He described Scientology as an "applied religious philosophy" because, according to him, it consists of a metaphysical doctrine, a theory of psychology, and teachings in morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Dericquebourg |first=Regis |title=Acta Comparanda |language=English, French |url=http://www.observatoire-religion.com/2016/12/scientology-in-a-scholarly-perspective/ |booktitle=Affinities between Scientology and Theosophy |conference=International Conference – Scientology in a scholarly perspective 24-25th January 2014 |publisher=University of Antwerp, Faculty for Comparative Study of Religions and Humanism |place=Antwerp, Belgium |year=2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216050903/http://www.observatoire-religion.com/2016/12/scientology-in-a-scholarly-perspective/ |archivedate=February 16, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The core of Scientology teaching lies in the belief that "each human has a reactive mind that responds to life's traumas, clouding the analytic mind and keeping us from experiencing reality." Scientologists undergo auditing to discover sources of this trauma, believing that re-experiencing it neutralizes it and reinforces the ascendancy of the analytic mind, with the final goal believed to be achieving a spiritual state that Scientology calls "clear."&lt;ref name="cnn.com"/&gt;

=== Theological doctrine ===
Scientology does not preach or impose a particular idea of God on Scientologists. Rather, people are expected to discover the truth through their own observations as their awareness advances.&lt;blockquote&gt;... the Church of Scientology has no set dogma concerning God that it imposes on its members. As with all its tenets, Scientology does not ask individuals to accept anything on faith alone. Rather, as one's level of spiritual awareness increases through participation in Scientology ''auditing'' and ''training'', one attains his own certainty of every dynamic. Accordingly, only when the Seventh Dynamic (spiritual) is reached in its entirety will one discover and come to a full understanding of the Eighth Dynamic (infinity) and one's relationship to the Supreme Being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Does Scientology have a concept of God?|url = http://www.scientology.org/faq/scientology-beliefs/what-is-the-concept-of-god-in-scientology.html|website = www.scientology.org|accessdate = December 31, 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many Scientologists avoid using the words "belief" or "faith" to describe how Hubbard's teachings impacts their lives. They perceive that Scientology is based on verifiable technologies, speaking to Hubbard's original scientific objectives for Dianetics, based on the quantifiability of auditing on the E-meter. Scientologists call Dianetics and Scientology as technologies because of their claim of their scientific precision and workability.&lt;ref name="Lewis 2017"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first1=J. |title=Handbook of Scientology |volume=Brill Handbooks on Contemporary Religion |editor-last=Lewis |editor-first=James R. |editor2-last=Hellesoy |editor2-first=Kjersti |publisher=Brill |year=2017 |isbn=9789004330542 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactive mind, traumatic memories, and auditing===
{{See also|Dianetics|Auditing (Scientology)}}
[[File:Stresstest.jpg|thumb|A Scientologist introduces the [[E-meter]] to a potential student]]
Scientology presents two major divisions of the mind.&lt;ref name="strangetimes98"&gt;{{harvnb|Flowers|1984|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[reactive mind]]'' is thought to record all pain and emotional trauma, while the ''analytical mind'' is a rational mechanism that serves consciousness.&lt;ref name="Chryssides" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Farwell"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bednarowski, Mary Farrell |title=New Religions and the Theological Imagination in America (Religion in North America) |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington |year=1995 |page=60 |isbn=978-0-253-20952-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reactive mind stores mental images which are not readily available to the analytical (conscious) mind; these are referred to as ''[[Engram (Dianetics)|engrams]]''.&lt;ref name="pollock"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pollock, Robert |title=The Everything World's Religions Book: Discover the Beliefs, Traditions, and Cultures of Ancient and Modern Religions |publisher=Adams Media Corporation |location=Avon, MA |year=2002 |page=210 |isbn=978-1-58062-648-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engrams are painful and debilitating; as they accumulate, people move further away from their true identity.&lt;ref name="Neusner" /&gt; To avoid this fate is Scientology's basic goal.&lt;ref name="Neusner" /&gt; Some engrams are taught by Hubbard to happen by accident while others are inflicted by "thetans who have gone bad and want power," as described by the Los Angeles Times. These engrams are named Implants in the doctrine of Scientology. Hubbard said, "Implants result in all varieties of illness, apathy, degradation, neurosis and insanity and are the principal cause of these in man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-scientologysidea062490-story.html|title=Defining the Theology|last=Sappell|first=Joel|last2=Welkos|first2=Robert W.|date=June 24, 1990|publisher=|accessdate=January 14, 2017|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

L. Ron Hubbard described the analytical mind in terms of a computer: "the analytical mind is not just a good computer, it is a perfect computer." According to him it makes the best decisions based on available data. Errors are made based on erroneous data, and is not the error of the analytical mind.&lt;ref name="Lewis 2017"/&gt;

Dianetic [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] is one way by which the Scientologist may progress toward the ''[[Clear (Scientology)|Clear]]'' state, winning gradual freedom from the reactive mind's engrams and acquiring certainty of his or her reality as a thetan.&lt;ref name="Melton32" /&gt; [[David V. Barrett]], a sociologist of religion who has written widely about the subject, says that according to Scientology, the "first major goal is to go Clear." Clearing was described to represent "the attainment of Man's dreams through the ages of attaining a new and higher state of existence and freedom from the endless cycle of birth, death, birth … Clear is the total erasure of the reactive mind from which stems all the anxieties and problems the individual has."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barrett |first1=David V. |authorlink=David V. Barrett |title=A Brief Guide to Secret Religions: A Complete Guide to Hermetic, Pagan and Esoteric Beliefs |publisher=Little, Brown Book Group |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientology asserts that people have hidden abilities which have not yet been fully realized.&lt;ref name="J. Gordon Melton p. 224"&gt;J. Gordon Melton ''The Encyclopedia of American Religion'', p. 224, McGrath Publishing Co., 1978 {{ISBN|978-0-7876-9696-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It teaches that increased spiritual awareness and physical benefits are accomplished through counseling sessions referred to as ''[[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]]''.&lt;ref name="Finkelman509"&gt;Paul Finkelman ''Religion and American Law'', p. 509, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2000 {{ISBN|978-0-8153-0750-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through auditing, people can solve their problems and free themselves of engrams.&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt; This restores them to their natural condition as thetans and enables them to be ''at cause'' in their daily lives, responding rationally and creatively to life events rather than reacting to them under the direction of stored engrams.&lt;ref name="GA175"&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|Bromley|2006|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, those who study Scientology materials and receive auditing sessions advance from a status of ''Preclear'' to ''Clear'' and ''Operating Thetan''.&lt;ref name="GA176-177"&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|Bromley|2006|pp=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientology's utopian aim is to "clear the planet", that is, clear all people in the world of their engrams.&lt;ref name="Lewis316"&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|2009|p=316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auditing is a one-on-one session with a Scientology counselor or ''auditor.''&lt;ref name="Neusner229-230"&gt;{{harvnb|DeChant|Jorgenson|2003|pp=229–230}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to [[Confession (religion)|confession]] or pastoral counseling, but the auditor records and stores all information received and does not dispense forgiveness or advice as a pastor or priest of another religion might do.&lt;ref name=Neusner229-230 /&gt; Instead, the auditor's task is to help a person discover and understand the universal principles of [[ARC triangle|affinity, reality, and communication]] (ARC).&lt;ref name=Neusner229-230 /&gt; Most auditing requires an [[E-meter]], a device that measures minute changes in [[electrical resistance]] through the body when a person holds electrodes (metal "cans"), and a small current is passed through them.&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Neusner229-230 /&gt;

Scientology teaches that the E-meter helps to locate spiritual difficulties.&lt;ref name=Neusner229-230 /&gt; Once an area of concern has been identified, the auditor asks the individual specific questions about it to help him or her eliminate the difficulty, and uses the E-meter to confirm that the "charge" has been dissipated.&lt;ref name=Neusner229-230 /&gt; As the individual progresses up the "Bridge to Total Freedom", the focus of auditing moves from simple engrams to engrams of increasing complexity and other difficulties.&lt;ref name=Neusner229-230 /&gt; At the more advanced OT levels, Scientologists act as their own auditors ("solo auditors").&lt;ref name=Neusner229-230 /&gt;

Douglas E. Cowan writes that the e-meter "provides an external, material locus for the legitimation of [Scientology] practice." Scientologists depend on the "appearance of objectivity or empirical validity" of the e-meter rather than simply trusting an auditor's abstract interpretation of a participant's statements. He also states that without the e-meter, "Scientology could not have achieved whatever status it enjoys as a new religious movement." He also argues that without it, the Church may not have survived the early years when Dianetics was just formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Cowan |first=Douglas E. |title=Acta Comparanda |language=English, French |url=http://www.observatoire-religion.com/2016/12/scientology-in-a-scholarly-perspective/ |booktitle=Clearly Material: Objects, Meaning, and the Ongoing Construction of New Religious Reality. |conference=International Conference – Scientology in a scholarly perspective 24-25th January 2014 |publisher=University of Antwerp, Faculty for Comparative Study of Religions and Humanism |place=Antwerp, Belgium |year=2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216050903/http://www.observatoire-religion.com/2016/12/scientology-in-a-scholarly-perspective/ |archivedate=February 16, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emotional Tone Scale and survival===
{{main|Emotional tone scale|Science of Survival}}
Scientology uses an emotional classification system called the ''[[Emotional tone scale|tone scale]]''.&lt;ref name="nowreligion"&gt;{{cite book |author=Malko, George |title=Scientology: The Now Religion |publisher=Delacorte Press |location=New York |year=1970 |page=109 |isbn=978-1-112-96373-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tone scale is a tool used in auditing; Scientologists maintain that knowing a person's place on the scale makes it easier to predict his or her actions and assists in bettering his or her condition.&lt;ref name="tone scale"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=kkj3yBwED2IC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=Scientology+tone+scale |title=The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Emotion, page 132 |author=John Corrigan |isbn=978-0-19-517021-4 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientology emphasizes the importance of ''survival'', which it subdivides into eight classifications that are referred to as ''"[[Scientology beliefs and practices#The Dynamics|dynamics]]"''.&lt;ref name="Wallis1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/wallis/wallis1.txt |title=The Road to Total Freedom A Sociological analysis of Scientology, page 1 |author=Roy Wallis |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015230830/http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/wallis/wallis1.txt |archivedate=October 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dynamics"&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual's desire to survive is considered to be the first dynamic, while the second dynamic relates to procreation and family.&lt;ref name="Wallis1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Melton25"&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining dynamics encompass wider fields of action, involving groups, mankind, all life, the physical universe, the spirit, and infinity, often associated with the Supreme Being.&lt;ref name="Wallis1" /&gt; The optimum solution to any problem is held to be the one that brings the greatest benefit to the greatest number of dynamics.&lt;ref name="Wallis1"/&gt;

Liungman ''Symbols'', p. 297, Ionfox AB, 2004 {{ISBN|978-91-972705-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientology teaches that the thetan is the true identity of a person&amp;nbsp;– an intrinsically good, omniscient, non-material core capable of unlimited creativity.&lt;ref name=Chryssides /&gt;&lt;ref name="Neusner" /&gt;

Hubbard taught that thetans brought the material universe into being largely for their own pleasure.&lt;ref name="Neusner" /&gt; The universe has no independent reality, but derives its apparent reality from the fact that thetans agree it exists.&lt;ref name=Chryssides /&gt; Thetans fell from grace when they began to identify with their creation rather than their original state of spiritual purity.&lt;ref name="Neusner" /&gt; Eventually they lost their memory of their true nature, along with the associated spiritual and creative powers. As a result, thetans came to think of themselves as nothing but embodied beings.&lt;ref name=Chryssides /&gt;&lt;ref name="Melton32"&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thetans are reborn time and time again in new bodies through a process called "assumption" which is analogous to [[reincarnation]].&lt;ref name="Neusner" /&gt;  Scientology posits a causal relationship between the experiences of earlier incarnations and one's present life, and with each rebirth, the effects of the ''MEST'' universe (MEST here stands for matter, energy, space, and time) on the thetan become stronger.&lt;ref name="Neusner" /&gt;

The Church of Scientology holds that at the higher levels of initiation ("[[Operating Thetan|OT levels]]"), mystical teachings are imparted that may be harmful to unprepared readers. These teachings are kept secret from members who have not reached these levels. The church says that the secrecy is warranted to keep its materials' use in context and to protect its members from being exposed to materials they are not yet prepared for.&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt;

These are the OT levels, the levels above ''Clear'', whose contents are guarded within Scientology. The OT level teachings include accounts of various cosmic catastrophes that befell the thetans.&lt;ref name="Melton33" /&gt; Hubbard described these early events collectively as "[[space opera in Scientology doctrine|space opera]]".

In the OT levels, Hubbard explains how to reverse the effects of past-life trauma patterns that supposedly extend millions of years into the past.&lt;ref name="DoubleCrossed"/&gt; Among these advanced teachings is the story of [[Xenu]] (sometimes Xemu), introduced as the tyrant ruler of the "[[Galactic Confederacy]]". According to this story, 75&amp;nbsp;million years ago Xenu brought billions of people to Earth in spacecraft resembling [[Douglas DC-8]] airliners, stacked them around volcanoes and detonated hydrogen bombs in the volcanoes. The thetans then clustered together, stuck to the bodies of the living, and continue to do this today. Scientologists at advanced levels place considerable emphasis on isolating body thetans and neutralizing their ill effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sappell |first=Joel |author2=Robert W.

Excerpts and descriptions of OT materials were published online by a former member in 1995 and then circulated in mainstream media. This occurred after the teachings were submitted as evidence in court cases involving Scientology, thus becoming a matter of public record.&lt;ref name="DoubleCrossed"&gt;{{cite web|first=Tony|last=Ortega|title=Double Crossed|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1999-12-23/news/double-crossed/full|website=[[Phoenix New Times]]|publisher=[[Village Voice Media]]|date=December 23, 1999|accessdate=September 16, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hfVJF9yj?url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1999-12-23/news/double-crossed/full|archivedate=June 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Loss"&gt;{{cite web|first=Matt|last=Hines|title=Scientology loss keeps hyperlinks legal|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1028_3-5072581.html|publisher=[[CNET]]|date=September 8, 2003|accessdate=September 16, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116233523/http://news.cnet.com/2100-1028_3-5072581.html|archivedate=November 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are eight publicly known OT levels, OT I to VIII.&lt;ref name="DavisNRMRL45-47"&gt;Derek Davis ''New Religious Movements and Religious Liberty in America'', pp. 45–47, Baylor University Press, 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-918954-92-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest level, OT VIII, is disclosed only at sea on the Scientology cruise ship ''[[Freewinds]]''.&lt;ref name="DavisNRMRL45-47" /&gt; It has been rumored that additional OT levels, said to be based on material written by Hubbard long ago, will be released at some appropriate point in the future.&lt;ref name="LewHam36"&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Hammer|2007|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics, suppressives, and disconnection===
{{main|Ethics (Scientology)|Suppressive Person|Disconnection}}
The ''Ethics'' system regulates member behavior,&lt;ref name="GA180" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Melton34"&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Ethics officers'' are present in every Scientology organization. ''Ethics'' officers ensure "correct application of Scientology technology" and deal with "behavior adversely affecting a Scientology organization's performance", ranging from "Errors" and "Misdemeanors" to "Crimes" and "Suppressive Acts", as those terms defined by Scientology.&lt;ref name="GA181"&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|Bromley|2006|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientology asserts some people are truly malevolent, and Hubbard taught 20 percent of the population were ''[[Suppressive Person|suppressive persons]]'', which includes some hopelessly antisocial personalities who are the truly dangerous individuals in humanity: "the Adolf Hitlers and the Genghis Khans, the unrepentant murderers and the drug lords."&lt;ref name="GA177" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ZP146-147"&gt;{{harvnb|Zellner|Petrowsky|1998|pp=146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientology [[disconnection]] policy prohibits most contact with Suppressive Persons.&lt;ref name="GA177" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ZP146-147" /&gt; The church denies that a disconnection policy exists, and quotes Hubbard's definition of disconnection as "a self-determined decision made by an individual that he is not going to be connected to another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientology.org/faq/scientology-attitudes-and-practices/what-is-disconnection.html |title=What is Disconnection? |accessdate=November 30, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Scientologist who communicates with a suppressive person risks being declared a ''Potential Trouble Source''.&lt;ref name="newreli"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bednarowski, Mary Farrell |title=New Religions and the Theological Imagination in America (Religion in North America) |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington |year=1995 |page=114 |isbn=978-0-253-20952-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="altreliny"&gt;{{cite book |author=Miller, Timothy |title=America's alternative religions |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany, N.Y |year=1995 |page=388 |isbn=978-0-7914-2397-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defectors who turn into critics of the movement are declared suppressive persons,&lt;ref name="isbn978-0-04-445687-2"&gt;{{cite book |author=Marshall, Gordon |title=In praise of sociology |publisher=Unwin Hyman |location=Boston |year=1990 |page=187 |isbn=978-0-04-445687-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="strangetimes101"&gt;{{harvnb|Flowers|1984|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="netwars"&gt;{{cite book |author=Grossman, Wendy |title=Net. wars |publisher=New York University Press |location=New York |year=1997 |page=73 |isbn=978-0-8147-3103-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn978-0-691-12582-4"&gt;{{cite book |author=Greenawalt, Kent |title=Religion and the Constitution |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J |year=2006 |page=298 |isbn=978-0-691-12582-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Church of Scientology has a reputation for moving aggressively against such detractors.&lt;ref name="Melton36"&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fair game===
{{main|Fair Game (Scientology)}}
The term ''Fair Game'' is used to describe policies and practices carried out against people the Church perceives as its enemies. Hubbard established the policy in the 1950s, in response to criticism both from within and outside his organization.&lt;ref name="urban2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="urban2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Urban|first=Hugh B.|year=2008|title=Secrecy and New Religious Movements: Concealment, Surveillance, and Privacy in a New Age of Information|journal=Religion Compass|volume=2|issue=1|pages=66–83|issn=1749-8171|doi=10.1111/j.1749-8171.2007.00052.x|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals or groups who are "Fair Game" are judged to be a threat to the Church and, according to the policy, can be punished and harassed using any and all means possible.&lt;ref name="urban2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="urban2008" /&gt;

Hubbard and his followers targeted many individuals as well as government officials and agencies, including a [[Operation Snow White|program of illegal infiltration]] of the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] and other [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] agencies during the 1970s.&lt;ref name="urban2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="urban2008" /&gt; They also conducted private investigations, [[character assassination]] and [[lawsuit|legal action]] against the Church's critics in the media.&lt;ref name="urban2006" /&gt; The policy remains in effect and has been defended by the Church of Scientology as a core religious practice.&lt;ref name="wollersheim212calapp3d872"&gt;Wollersheim v. Church of Scientology, 212 Cal. App. 3d 872 (Cal. App. 2d Dist. 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="flinnp4032"&gt;Frank K.

Church of Scientology of California, Court of Appeal of the State of California, civ.no. B023193, July 18, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scientology ceremonies ===
In Scientology, ceremonies for events such as weddings, child naming, and funerals are observed.&lt;ref name="Neusner" /&gt; Friday services are held to commemorate the completion of a person's religious services during the prior week.&lt;ref name="Neusner" /&gt; Ordained Scientology ministers may perform such rites.&lt;ref name="Neusner" /&gt; However, these services and the clergy who perform them play only a minor role in Scientologists' religious lives.&lt;ref name="GA170"&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|Bromley|2006|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The arts ===
Hubbard theorized in 1951 that the "aesthetic mind" is a phase of mental activity that "deals with the nebulous field of art and creation." In August 1965, Hubbard published the book ''Art'' that defines art as "a word which summarizes the quality of communication." He also claimed that art is "the least codified of human endeavors and the most misunderstood." The book is used as a textbook for art courses in Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Berzano |first=Luigi |contribution=Scientology's Spatial Aesthetics |title=A Zero Conference on Research in the Religious Fields |place=Bologna |date=2017-06-18 |contribution-url=http://www.cesnur.org/2017/berzano_engl.pdf |accessdate=2017-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Membership statistics===

A 2001 survey estimated that 55,000 people in the United States claimed to be Scientologists.

===Sea Org===
The highest ranking people in the Scientology hierarchy are the members of the Sea Organization, or [[Sea Org]].&lt;ref name="GA180"&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|Bromley|2006|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization includes some 5,000 of Scientology's most  dedicated adherents, who work for low pay, and sign a billion-year contract.&lt;ref name="GA180" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Melton43"&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rehabilitation Project Force===
The [[Rehabilitation Project Force]] (RPF) is a controversial part of the Scientology "justice" system.&lt;ref name="GA181" /&gt; When Sea Org members are found guilty of a violation, they are assigned to the RPF.&lt;ref name="GA181" /&gt; The RPF involves a daily regimen of five hours of auditing or studying, eight hours of work, often physical labor, such as building renovation, and at least seven hours of sleep.&lt;ref name="GA181" /&gt; [[Douglas E.

CST licenses this intellectual property to the Religious Technology Center who then sub-licenses it to [[Church of Scientology International]].

===Franchises and advanced organizations===
Many Scientologists' first contact with Scientology is through local informal groups and field auditors practicing Dianetics counseling.&lt;ref name="Melton39"&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these, Scientology operates hundreds of Churches and Missions around the world.&lt;ref name="GA182"&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|Bromley|2006|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is where Scientologists receive introductory training, and it is at this local level that most Scientologists participate.&lt;ref name="GA182" /&gt; Churches and Missions are licensed franchises; they may offer services for a fee provided they contribute a proportion of their income and comply with the [[Religious Technology Center]] (RTC) and its standards.&lt;ref name="GA182" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Melton42"&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bromley98"&gt;{{harvnb|Bromley|2009|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, Hubbard created a list of 63 celebrities targeted for conversion to Scientology.&lt;ref name="Shaw_telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3671262/What-do-Tom-Cruise-and-John-Travolta-know-about-Scientology-that-we-dont.html|title=What do Tom Cruise and John Travolta know about Scientology that we don't?|last=Shaw|first=William|date=February 14, 2008|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=June 25, 2009 | location=London |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65TZTh8C2?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3671262/What-do-Tom-Cruise-and-John-Travolta-know-about-Scientology-that-we-dont.html|archivedate=February 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a church policy letter in 1973, L.

Scientology operates eight churches that are designated ''[[Celebrity Centres]]'', designed to minister to celebrity Scientologists.&lt;ref name=Neusner233 /&gt; The largest of these is in Hollywood, California, called ''Church of Scientology Celebrity Centre International''.&lt;ref name="Neusner233"&gt;{{harvnb|DeChant|Jorgenson|2003|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Celebrity Centre International was the first one that was opened in 1969 and its opening is celebrated the first week of August each year in an evening gala.&lt;ref&gt;Melton, J.

===Scientology tech in jails and prisons, schools, and management===
[[File:Church of Scientology Tampa.jpg|thumb|Church of Scientology of [[Tampa, Florida]]]]
Several Scientology organizations promote the use of Scientology technology as a means to solve social problems. Scientology began to focus on these issues in the early 1970s, led by Hubbard. The church developed outreach programs to fight drug addiction, illiteracy, learning disabilities and criminal behavior. These have been presented to schools, businesses and communities as secular techniques based on Hubbard's writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Neusner |first1=Jacob |title=World Religions in America |edition= 4th |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association for Better Living and Education]] (ABLE) acts as an umbrella organization for these efforts.&lt;ref name="Melton44"&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable examples include:

* [[Criminon]], an offshoot of Narconon, introduces Scientology practices to criminal offenders.&lt;ref name="GA182" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Melton45-46" /&gt;
* [[Applied Scholastics]], founded in 1972, teaches Scientology [[study tech]] to K-12 students.&lt;ref name="GA183"&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|Bromley|2006|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Delphi Schools]] operates numerous private schools throughout the United States, including the flagship academy [[The Delphian School]] in Yamhill County, Oregon.
* The [[World Institute of Scientology Enterprises]] (WISE) applies Scientology technology to business management.&lt;ref name="GA183" /&gt; The most prominent training supplier to make use of Hubbard's technology is [[Sterling Management Systems]].&lt;ref name="GA183" /&gt;
* [[The Way to Happiness|The Way to Happiness Foundation]] promotes a moral code written by Hubbard, to date translated into more than 40 languages.&lt;ref name="GA183" /&gt;

===Volunteer ministers===
{{Main|Volunteer Ministers}}

The Church of Scientology began its "[[Volunteer Ministers]]" program as a way to participate in community outreach projects. Volunteer Ministers sometimes travel to the scenes of major disasters in order to provide assistance with relief efforts. According to critics, these relief efforts consist of passing out copies of a pamphlet authored by Hubbard entitled ''[[The Way to Happiness]]'', and engaging in a method said to calm panicked or injured individuals known in Scientology as a "[[touch assist]]." Accounts of the Volunteer Ministers' effectiveness have been mixed, and touch assists are not supported by scientific evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sly|first1=Randy|title=Updated: Scientologists in Haiti: Volunteers or Vultures?|url=http://www.catholic.org/news/international/americas/story.php?id=35377|accessdate=December 16, 2015|work=Catholic.org|date=September 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Winn|first1=Patrick|title=Scientologists are in Nepal trying to 'heal' trauma victims|url=http://www.globalpost.com/article/6550051/2015/05/15/scientologists-are-nepal-trying-heal-trauma-victims|accessdate=December 16, 2015|work=Global Post|date=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Winn|first1=Patrick|title=Scientology's global disaster squad|url=https://www.minnpost.com/global-post/2011/04/scientology%E2%80%99s-global-disaster-squad|accessdate=December 16, 2015|work=MinnPost|date=April 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Scientology-related organizations include:
* [[International Association of Scientologists]], the official Scientology membership organization.  Since 1985, the IAS has held an annual ceremony awarding the IAS Freedom Medal.   
* The National Commission on Law Enforcement and Social Justice, devoted to combating what it describes as abusive practices by government and police agencies, especially [[Interpol]].&lt;ref name="GA184" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Melton50-51"&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

States defended the practice by noting their responsibility to respond to citizens' requests for information about Scientology as well as other subjects. While many of the pamphlets were factual and relatively unbiased, some warned of alleged dangers posed by Scientology to the political order, to the free market economic system, and to the mental and financial well being of individuals. Beyond the Government's actions, the Catholic Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church have been public opponents of Scientology. Evangelical 'Commissioners for Religious and Ideological Issues' have been particularly active in this regard."]]

The Church of Scientology is one of the most controversial religious organizations. A first point of controversy was its challenge of the psychotherapeutic establishment. Another was a 1991 [[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]] [[The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power|article]] that attacked the church, who responded with a major lawsuit that was rejected by the court as baseless early in 1992. And a third is its religious status in the United States, formalized when the IRS granted the organization tax-exempt status in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first1=James R. |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WEy-BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT9&amp;dq=scientology+controversy#v=onepage&amp;q=controversy&amp;f=false |title=Scientology |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=November 5, 2015 |isbn=9780199887118 |date=2009-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the controversy surrounding Scientology stems from the criminal convictions of core members of the Scientology organization.

In 1978, a number of Scientologists, including L.&amp;nbsp;Ron Hubbard's wife [[Mary Sue Hubbard]] (who was second in command in the organization at the time), were convicted of perpetrating what was at the time the largest incident of domestic espionage in the history of the United States, called "[[Operation Snow White]]". This involved infiltrating, wiretapping, and stealing documents from the offices of Federal attorneys and the [[Internal Revenue Service]].&lt;ref name="nr4186"&gt;{{cite book|title = National Reporting, 1941-1986|last = Ficsher|first = Erika|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|page = 302}}&lt;/ref&gt;  L.&amp;nbsp;Ron Hubbard was convicted ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' by French authorities of engaging in [[fraud]] and sentenced to four years in prison.&lt;ref name="criticsabroad"&gt;{{cite web|first=Lucy |last=Morgan |title=Abroad: Critics public and private keep pressure on Scientology |url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/32999/Worldandnation/Abroad__Critics_publi.html |website= |publisher=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |date=March 29, 1999 |accessdate=November 4, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219080712/http://www.sptimes.com/News/32999/Worldandnation/Abroad__Critics_publi.html |archivedate=December 19, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The head of the French Church of Scientology was convicted at the same trial and given a suspended one-year prison sentence.&lt;ref&gt;''Catholic Sentinel'', March 17, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

An FBI raid on the Church's headquarters revealed documentation that detailed Scientology's criminal actions against various critics of the organization. In "[[Operation Freakout]]", agents of the church attempted to destroy [[Paulette Cooper]], author of ''The Scandal of Scientology'', an early book that had been critical of the movement.&lt;ref name="sppulitzer"&gt;{{cite news |author=Charles L.

===Organized harassment===
{{main|Fair Game (Scientology)}}
Scientology has historically engaged in hostile action toward its critics; executives within the organization have proclaimed that Scientology is "not a [[Turn the other cheek|turn-the-other-cheek]] religion".&lt;ref&gt;

Many of Scientology's critics have also reported they were subject to threats and harassment in their private lives.&lt;ref name="Behar2"&gt;{{cite magazine | first = Richard | last = Behar | authorlink = Richard Behar | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,972886,00.html | title = The Scientologists and Me |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = May 6, 1991}}

According to a 1990 ''Los Angeles Times'' article, Scientology had largely switched from using church members to using private investigators, including former and current Los Angeles police officers, as this gives the church a layer of protection in case investigators use tactics embarrassing to the church.  In one case, the church described their tactics as "LAPD sanctioned," which was energetically disputed by Police Chief Daryl Gates.  The officer involved in this particular case of surveillance and harassment was suspended for six months.&lt;ref name="On the Offensive Against an Array of Suspected Foes, Los Angeles Times, June 29, 1990"&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/local/la-scientology062990x-story.html#page=1 On the Offensive Against an Array of Suspected Foes], ''Los Angeles Times'', Joel Sappell, Robert W.

===Violation of auditing confidentiality===
[[File:Scientology - The E-Meter.jpg|thumb|Scientology [[E-Meter]]]]

During the auditing process, the auditor collects and records personal information from the client.&lt;ref name="Melton29"&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="namehubbard"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jun/09/tvandradio.broadcasting1 |title=My name is L Ron Hubbard|accessdate=January 14, 2009 | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=James | last=Donaghy | date=June 9, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307111832/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/jun/09/tvandradio.broadcasting1 |archivedate=March 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Church of Scientology claims to protect the confidentiality of auditing records, the Church has a history of attacking and psychologically abusing former members using information culled from the records.&lt;ref name="namehubbard" /&gt; For example, a December 16, 1969, a [[Office of Special Affairs#History|Guardian's Office]] order (G.

===Shunning===
{{details|Disconnection}}
The practice of shunning in Scientology is termed "Disconnection". Members can disconnect from any person they already know, including existing family members. Many examples of this policy's application have been established in court.&lt;ref&gt;Judgement of Mr Justice Latey, Re: B &amp; G (Minors) (Custody) Delivered in the High Court

A former high-ranking source reports that "some 1,500 abortions" have been "carried out by women in the Sea Organization since the implementation of a rule in the late '80s that members could not remain in the organization if they decided to have children."   The source noted that "And if members who have been in the Sea Organization for, say, 10 years do decide to have kids, they are dismissed with no more than $1,000" as a [[severance package]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =New York Post staff  | title =Abort-Happy Folks  | work =[[New York Post]]  | page =011  | publisher =[[News Corporation]]  | date =June 29, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1993 U.S. lawsuit brought by the Church of Scientology against Steven Fishman, a former member of the Church, [[Fishman Affidavit|Fishman made a court declaration]] which included several dozen pages of formerly secret [[esotericism|esoterica]] detailing aspects of Scientologist [[cosmogony]].&lt;ref name="DC2004"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dawson | first = Lorne L. | author-link= Lorne L.

In January 1995, church lawyer [[Helena Kobrin]] attempted to shut down the [[newsgroup]] [[alt.religion.scientology]] by sending a control message instructing [[Usenet]] servers to delete the group.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Grossman ''[[Net.wars]]'', p. 77, NYU Press, 1997 {{ISBN|978-0-8147-3103-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, this [[rmgroup message]] had little effect, since most Usenet servers are configured to disregard such messages when sent to groups that receive substantial traffic, and [[newgroup message]]s were quickly issued to recreate the group on those servers that did not do so. However, the issuance of the message led to a great deal of public criticism by free-speech advocates.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Vedro ''Digital Dharma'', p. 190, Quest Books, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-8356-0859-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mike Godwin ''[[Cyber Rights]]'', p. 219, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press, 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-262-57168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the criticisms raised, one suggestion is that Scientology's true motive is to suppress the free speech of its critics.&lt;ref&gt;Catharine Cookson ''Encyclopedia of Religious Freedom'', p. 432, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-415-94181-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Grossman ''[[Net.wars]]'', p. 90, New York University Press, 1997 {{ISBN|978-0-8147-3103-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anonymous Protest.jpg|thumb|An Internet-based group which refers to itself as '[[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]' held [[Project Chanology|protests]] outside Scientology centers in cities around the world in February 2008 as part of [[Project Chanology]].

The Church also began filing lawsuits against those who posted copyrighted texts on the newsgroup and the [[World Wide Web]], and lobbied for tighter restrictions on copyrights in general. The Church supported the controversial [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act]] as well as the even more controversial [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA). Some of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]]'s provisions (notably the [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act]]) were heavily influenced by Church litigation against US [[Internet service providers]] over copyrighted Scientology materials that had been posted or uploaded through their servers.

Beginning in the middle of 1996 and ensuing for several years, the newsgroup was attacked by anonymous parties using a tactic dubbed ''[[sporgery]]'' by some, in the form of hundreds of thousands of forged spam messages posted on the group. Some investigators said that some spam had been traced to church members.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Lueg ''From Usenet to CoWebs'', p. 37, Springer, 2003 {{ISBN|978-1-85233-532-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Grossman ''[[Net.wars]]'', pp. 74–76, NYU Press, 1997 {{ISBN|978-0-8147-3103-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Scientologist [[Tory Christman]] later asserted that the [[Office of Special Affairs]] had undertaken a concerted effort to destroy alt.religion.scientology through these means; the effort failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nordhausen|first=Frank|title=Scientology: Wie der Sektenkonzern die Welt erobern will|publisher=Links Christoph Verlag|page=518|isbn=978-3-86153-470-9|language=German|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, the Church of Scientology of California was granted tax-exempt status by the United States [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), and so, for a time, were other local churches.&lt;ref name="Melton13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Times tax exempt status"&gt;{{cite news|first=Douglas|last=Frantz|title=Scientology's Puzzling Journey From Tax Rebel to Tax Exempt|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E7DE1639F93AA35750C0A961958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|work=New York Times|date=March 9, 1997|accessdate=October 26, 2008  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321061944/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E7DE1639F93AA35750C0A961958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|archivedate=March 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 however, the IRS started a review of the appropriateness of this status.&lt;ref name="Melton13" /&gt; In 1959, Hubbard moved to England, remaining there until the mid-1960s.&lt;ref name="GA172" /&gt;

In the mid-sixties, the Church of Scientology was banned in several Australian states, starting with [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in 1965.&lt;ref name="Melton14"&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban was based on the [[Anderson Report]], which found that the auditing process involved "command" hypnosis, in which the hypnotist assumes "positive authoritative control" over the patient. On this point the report stated, &lt;blockquote&gt;It is the firm conclusion of this Board that most scientology and dianetic techniques are those of authoritative hypnosis and as such are dangerous ... the scientific evidence which the Board heard from several expert witnesses of the highest repute ... leads to the inescapable conclusion that it is only in name that there is any difference between authoritative hypnosis and most of the techniques of scientology.

In 1967, the IRS removed Scientology's tax-exempt status, asserting that its activities were commercial and operated for the benefit of Hubbard, rather than for charitable or religious purposes.&lt;ref name="NY Times tax exempt status" /&gt; The decision resulted in a process of litigation that was settled in the Church's favor a quarter of a century later, the longest case of litigation in IRS history.&lt;ref name="Melton13" /&gt;

Scientology has been accused of being "a business, often given to criminal acts, and sometimes masquerading as a religion."&lt;ref name="GA170" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BH" /&gt;

In conjunction with the Church of Scientology's request to be officially recognized as a religion in Germany, around 1996 the German state [[Baden-Württemberg]] conducted a thorough investigation of the group's activities within Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030831131002/http://www.im.nrw.de/inn/doks/vs/blagsc.pdf Zur Frage der Beobachtung der Scientology-Organisation durch die Verfassungsschutzbehörden] (in German) (PDF format)&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this investigation indicated that at the time of publication, Scientology's main sources of revenue ("Haupteinnahmequellen der SO") were from course offerings and sales of their various publications. Course offerings ranged from (German Marks) DM 182.50 to about DM 30,000{{spaced ndash}}the equivalent today of approximately $119 to $19,560&amp;nbsp;USD. Revenue from monthly, bi-monthly, and other membership offerings could not be estimated in the report, but was nevertheless placed in the millions. Defending its practices against accusations of [[profiteering (business)|profiteering]], the Church has countered critics by drawing analogies to other religious groups who have established practices such as [[tithing]], or require members to make donations for specific religious services.&lt;ref name="Melton60"&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1997 [[Germany]] has considered Scientology to be in conflict with the principles of the nation's constitution. It is seen as an anticonstitutional sect and a new version of political extremism and because there is "evidence for intentions against the free democratic basic order" it is observed by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verfassungsschutz.de/de/arbeitsfelder/af_scientology|title=Scientology-Organisation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210023427/http://www.verfassungsschutz.de/de/arbeitsfelder/af_scientology/|archivedate=February 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon }}{{cite web|url=http://www.heute.de/ZDF/zdfportal/web/heute-Nachrichten/4672/23818856/5cf9d6/Eskalierende-Gewaltkultur-bei-Scientology.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120921005615/http://www.heute.de/ZDF/zdfportal/web/heute-Nachrichten/4672/23818856/5cf9d6/Eskalierende-Gewaltkultur-bei-Scientology.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 21, 2012 |title="Eskalierende Gewaltkultur" bei Scientology – heute-Nachrichten |publisher=Heute.de |accessdate=September 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, an open letter to then-German Chancellor, [[Helmut Kohl]], published as a newspaper advertisement in the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', drew parallels between the "organized oppression" of [[Scientology in Germany|Scientologists in Germany]] and the treatment of [[Jews]] in 1930s' [[Nazi]] Germany.&lt;ref name="IHT"&gt;Schmid, John (January 15, 1997). {{cite web |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1997/01/15/scient.t.php |title=German Party Replies To Scientology Backers |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228220902/http://iht.com/articles/1997/01/15/scient.t.php |archivedate=February 28, 2009 }}, ''[[International Herald Tribune|Herald Tribune]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wash /&gt; The letter was signed by [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Goldie Hawn]] and a number of other [[Hollywood]] celebrities and executives.&lt;ref name="Wash"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-704081.html |title=Germany, America and Scientology |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610085859/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-704081.html |archivedate=June 10, 2014 }}, ''Washington Post'', February 1, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonfante"&gt;Bonfante, Jordan; van Voorst, Bruce (February 10, 1997).

France and Belgium have not recognized Scientology as a religion, and [[Stephen A.

Scientology maintains strict control over the use of its symbols, icons, and names. It claims [[copyright]] and [[trademark]] over its "Scientology cross", and its lawyers have threatened lawsuits against individuals and organizations who have published the image in books and on Web sites. Because of this, it is very difficult for individual groups to attempt to publicly practice Scientology on their own, independent of the official Church of Scientology. Scientology has filed suit against a number of individuals who have attempted to set up their own auditing practices, using copyright and trademark law to shut these groups down.&lt;ref&gt;Plotkin-Wells &amp; Wimmer ''E-Commerce Law &amp; Business'', Section 8.01[2], Aspen Publishers Online, 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-7355-4148-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, Australian [[Australian Senate|Senator]] [[Nick Xenophon]] used a speech in Federal Parliament to allege that the Church of Scientology is a criminal organization. Based on letters from former followers of the religion, he said that there were "allegations of forced imprisonment, coerced abortions, and embezzlement of church funds, of physical violence and intimidation, blackmail and the widespread and deliberate abuse of information obtained by the organization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rudd's concerns about Scientology (quoted from embedded video, "Xenophon attacks Scientology – Independent Senator Nick Xenophon attacks Scientology as a 'criminal organisation{{Single double}})|date=November 18, 2009|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/senator-attacks--criminal-church-of-scientology-20091118-ikla.html?autostart=1|publisher=[[The Age]]|ref=harv|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientology in religious studies==
Describing the available scholarship on Scientology, [[David G. Bromley]] and [[Douglas E. Cowan]] stated in 2006 that "most scholars have concluded that Scientology falls within the category of religion for the purposes of academic study, and a number have defended the Church in judicial and political proceedings on this basis."&lt;ref name="GA170"/&gt; Hugh B. Urban writes that "Scientology's efforts to get itself defined as a religion make it an ideal case study for thinking about how we understand and define religion."&lt;ref&gt;Urban, Hugh B.: The Church of Scientology: A History of a New Religion
Chapman, Mark. Review of Religious Research. 2013. vol. 55. Issue: 1, pp. 203-204&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the second decade of the 2000s, a new interest for Scientology emerged among scholars, bringing the subject from obscurity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Alternative Spirituality and Religion Review |publisher=University Charles De Gaulle Lille |year=2014 |last=Dericquebourg |first=Regis |volume=4 |issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Encyclopedia of Religious Controversies in the United States'', "even as Scientology raises questions about how and who gets to define religion, most scholars recognize it as a religion, one that emerges from and builds on American individualism and the spiritual marketplace that dominated 1950s America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Neal | first = Lynn S. | editor = Bill J.

Bromley and Cowan noted in 2008 that Scientology's attempts "to gain favor with new religion scholars" had often been problematic.&lt;ref name="BC17" /&gt; According to Religious Studies professor Mary Farrell Benarowski, Scientology describes itself as drawing on science, religion, psychology and philosophy but "had been claimed by none of them and repudiated, for the most part, by all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mary Farrell |last=Bednarowski |chapter=The Church of Scientology: Lightning Rod for Cultural Boundary Conflicts |editor=Timothy Miller |title=America's Alternative Religions|year=1995 |isbn=978-0-7914-2397-4|publisher=SUNY Press|page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regis Dericquesbourg writes about the efficacy of Scientology in imparting knowledge: "Scientology indeed not only brings knowledge, it also brings personal introspection through auditing, and transmission in upper levels is not merely reading texts: what is transmitted is experienced through a solo or duo auditing experience." He compared it to psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Alternative Spirituality and Religion Review |journal=University Charles de Gaulle Lille |year=2014 |last=Dericquebourg |first=Regis |volume=4 |issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank K. Flinn, adjunct professor of religious studies at [[Washington University]] in [[St. Louis]] wrote, "it is abundantly clear that Scientology has both the typical forms of ceremonial and celebratory worship and its own unique form of spiritual life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neuereligion.de/ENG/Flinn/index.htm|first=Frank K.|last=Flinn|title=Scientology: The Marks of Religion|publisher=Church of Scientology|date=September 22, 1994 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914201545/http://www.neuereligion.de/ENG/Flinn/index.htm|archivedate=September 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flinn further states that religion requires "beliefs in something transcendental or ultimate, practices (rites and codes of behavior) that re-inforce those beliefs and, a community that is sustained by both the beliefs and practices", all of which are present within Scientology.&lt;ref name="Flinn-WashingtonPost"/&gt; Similarly, ''World Religions in America'' states that "Scientology contains the same elements of most other religions, including myths, scriptures, doctrines, worship, sacred practices and rituals, moral and ethical expectations, a community of believers, clergy, and ecclesiastic organizations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34vGv_HDGG8C|title=World Religions in America, Fourth Edition: An Introduction|last=DeChant|first=Dell|last2=Jorgensen|first2=Danny L.|date=October 7, 2009|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=9781611640472|editor-last=Neusner|editor-first=Jacob|page=297|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While acknowledging that a number of his colleagues accept Scientology as a religion, sociologist [[Stephen A.

Donna Batten in the ''Gale Encyclopedia of American Law'' writes, "A belief does not need to be stated in traditional terms to fall within [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protection. For example, Scientology—a system of beliefs that a human being is essentially a free and immortal spirit who merely inhabits a body—does not propound the existence of a supreme being, but it qualifies as a religion under the broad definition propounded by the Supreme Court."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Jeffrey Lehman |editor2=Shirelle Phelps |title=West's Encyclopedia of American Law |chapter=Religion |edition= 2nd |year=2005 |publisher=Thomson/Gale |volume=8 |location=Detroit |page=283 |isbn=978-0-7876-6375-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

J. Gordon Melton asserts that while the debate over definitions of religion will continue, "scholars will probably continue in the future to adopt a broad definition, thus including Scientology in a wider religious field."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Melton |first1=J.

Hubbard did not want to found a religion: he discovered that what he was talking about in fact was religion. This mainly happened when he had to deal with apparent memories from former lives. He had to defend himself about this to his friends."&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt; Frenschkowski allows that there were practical concerns in the question of "how to present Scientology to the outside world", but dismisses the notion that the religious format was just an expedient pretense; Frenschkowski points to many passages in Hubbard's works that document his struggle with this question.&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt; Frenschkowski suggests that it was a biographical mistake to suggest that Hubbard only became interested in Scientology as a religion in 1954. He notes that Hubbard discussed religion and the concept of God even in the years leading up to the emergence of Scientology, and that he did not "rush into religion" but rather, "discovered it through the development of his work with pre-clears."&lt;ref name="Frenschkowski 2016"/&gt;

Drawing parallels to similar struggles for identity in other religious movements such as [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and [[Transcendental Meditation]], Frenschkowski sees in Hubbard's lectures "the case of a man whose background was non-religious and who nevertheless discovers that his ideas somehow oscillate between 'science' (in a very popular sense), 'religion' and 'philosophy', and that these ideas somehow fascinate so many people that they start to form a separate movement." Hubbard experiments with traditional religious language in a short piece written in 1953 called "The Factors", "a basic expression of Scientologist cosmology and metaphysics", reprinted in current Scientology literature. Frenschkowski observes that the text is partly biblical in structure and that this development is a component of Scientology's metamorphosis into a religion, written at a point when the nature of the new movement was unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Images of Religions and Religious History in the Works of L.

The Church of Scientology denounces the idea of Hubbard starting a religion for personal gain as an unfounded rumor.&lt;ref&gt;Platvoet &amp; Molendijk ''The Pragmatics of Defining Religion'', pp. 63–64, Brill, 1999 {{ISBN|978-90-04-11544-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church also suggests that the origin of the rumor was a remark by [[George Orwell]] which had been misattributed to Hubbard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jentzsch|first=Heber|title=Church of Scientology FAQ: Did L. Ron Hubbard state that the way to make money was to start a religion?|url=http://faq.scientology.org/page44b.htm|accessdate=June 9, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223234041/http://faq.scientology.org/page44b.htm|archivedate=February 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Vaughn Young]], who left the Church in 1989 after being its spokesman for twenty years, suggested that reports of Hubbard making such a statement could be explained as a misattribution, despite having encountered three of Hubbard's associates from his science fiction days who remembered Hubbard making statements of that sort in person.&lt;ref name="The Church's War" /&gt; It was Young who by a stroke of luck came up with the "Orwell quote": "but I have always thought there might be a lot of cash in starting a new religion, and we'll talk it over some time". It appears in a letter by [[Eric Blair]] (known the world as George Orwell) to his friend, Jack Common, dated 16-February-38 (February 16, 1938), and was published in ''Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell'', vol. 1.&lt;ref&gt;''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell'' (4 volumes), vol. 1, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1968 ASIN: B000GLJ10S&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s Janet Reitman also attributed the statement to Hubbard, as a remark to science fiction writer [[Lloyd Eshbach]] and recorded in Eshbach's autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Reitman ''Inside Scientology'', Rolling Stone, February 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientology as a UFO religion===

Scientology can be seen as a [[UFO religion]] in which the existence of extraterrestrial entities operating unidentified flying objects (UFOs) are an element of belief. In this context, it is discussed in ''UFO Religions'' by Christopher Partridge,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Partridge | first=Christopher Hugh | year=2003 | title=UFO religions | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-0-415-26323-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Aqhdas-u1UgC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Encyclopedic Sourcebook of UFO Religions'' by [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]],&lt;ref name="lewisufo"&gt;{{cite book | last =Lewis | first =James R. (editor) | authorlink =James R. Lewis (scholar) | title =The Encyclopedic Sourcebook of UFO Religions | publisher =Prometheus Books | date =November 2003 | isbn =978-1-57392-964-6 | page =42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Susan Palmer draws several parallels with [[Raelianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Susan J.
''Aliens adored : Raël's UFO religion'', Rutgers University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8135-3475-6}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory Reece, in his book ''UFO Religion: Inside flying saucer cults and culture'', writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;Scientology is unique within the UFO culture because of this secretiveness, as well as because of the capitalist format under which they operate. Scientology is also difficult to categorize. While it bears strong similarities to the [[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)|Ashtar Command]] or the [[Aetherius Society]], its emphasis upon the Xenu event as the central message of the group seems to place them within the [[ancient astronaut]] tradition. Either way, Scientology is perhaps most different from other UFO groups in their attempt to keep all of the space opera stuff under wraps. They really would have preferred the rest of us not to know about [[Xenu]] and the galactic federation. Alas, such secrets are hard to keep&lt;ref&gt;Reece, G.l., ''UFO Religion: Inside Flying Saucer Cults and Culture'', I.B.Tauris &amp; Co Ltd, 2007, pp. 182-186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regardless of such statements by critics, Hubbard wrote and lectured openly about the material he himself called "space opera." In 1952, Hubbard published a book (''[[Scientology: A History of Man|What to Audit / A History of Man]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Scientology: A History of Man {{!}} Bridge Publications, Inc|url = http://www.bridgepub.com/store/catalog/scientology-a-history-of-man-hardcover.html|website = www.bridgepub.com|accessdate = May 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) on space opera and other material that may be encountered when auditing preclears.&lt;ref&gt;Church of Scientology, "[http://www.scientology.org/wis/wiseng/42/52.htm Complete List of Scientology and Dianetics Books and Materials of 1952]".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Scientology|last = Rothstein|first = Mikael|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2009|isbn = 978-0-19-533149-3|location = New York, New York|page = 375|editor-last = Lewis|editor-first = James R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[David G. Bromley]], Scientology is "part therapy, part religion, part UFO group. It's a mix of things unlike any other religious group out there."&lt;ref name="cnn.com"/&gt; Scholar Andreas Grunschlo writes that as a ufogical religion, Scientology "conceives of earthly human beings primarily as extraterrestrial spirits ('Thetans') which have now to put on their 'bridge to freedom' again —a soul conception which is paralleled by the typical ufogical 'star seeds' or 'walk-ins' planted on this earthly 'garden' for spiritual growth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first1=James R. |title=The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements |volume=1 |editor-last=Lewis |editor-first=James R. |publisher=OUP USA |year=2008 |isbn=9780195369649 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&amp;nbsp;

===Influences===
The general orientation of Hubbard's philosophy owes much to [[Will Durant]], author of the popular 1926 classic ''[[The Story of Philosophy]]''; ''Dianetics'' is dedicated to Durant.&lt;ref name=Willms248-9 /&gt; Hubbard's view of a mechanically functioning mind in particular finds close parallels in Durant's work on [[Spinoza]].&lt;ref name="Willms248-9"&gt;{{harvnb|Willms|2009|pp=248–249}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hubbard himself, Scientology is "the Western anglicized continuance of many early forms of wisdom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ankerberg |first1=John |last2=Weldon|first2=John |title=Encyclopedia of New Age Beliefs|publisher=Harvest House Publishers |date=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ankerberg and Weldon mention the sources of Scientology to include "the [[Vedas]], [[Buddhism]], [[Judaism]], [[Gnosticism]], [[Taoism]], early Greek civilization and the teachings of [[Jesus]], [[Nietzsche]] and Freud."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The concept "salvation" in the Church of Scientology | journal = HTS Teologiese Studies / Theological Studies | year = 2006 | first = S.P. | last = Pretorius | volume = 62 | issue = 1 | pages = 313–327| id = | doi=10.4102/hts.v62i1.353}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard asserted that Freudian thought was a "major precursor" to Scientology. W. Vaughn Mccall, Professor and Chairman of the Georgia Regents University writes, "Both Freudian theory and Hubbard assume that there are unconscious mental processes that may be shaped by early life experiences, and that these influence later behavior and thought." Both schools of thought propose a "tripartite structure of the mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Psychiatry and Psychology in the Writings of L. Ron Hubbard |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |year=2007 |last=Mccall |first=W. Vaughn|volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=437–47 |doi=10.1007/s10943-006-9079-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]]'s psychology, popularized in the 1930s and 1940s, was a key contributor to the Dianetics therapy model, and was acknowledged unreservedly as such by Hubbard in his early works.&lt;ref name=Willms2005-54-60 /&gt; Hubbard never forgot, when he was 12 years old, meeting Cmdr. [[Joseph Cheesman Thompson]], a U.S. Navy officer who had studied with Freud&lt;ref&gt;Lewis &amp; Petersen ''Controversial New Religions'', p. 238, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-515682-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and when writing to the [[American Psychological Association]] in 1949, he stated that he was conducting research based on the "early work of Freud".&lt;ref name="GA171"&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|Bromley|2006|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Dianetics'', Hubbard cites [[Hegel]] as a negative influence — an object lesson in "confusing" writing.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L Ron. 'Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health'. Los Angeles, California: Bridge Publications, 2007: 3. {{ISBN|978-1-4031-4484-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mary A. Mann, Scientology is considered nondenominational, accepting all people regardless of their religions background, ethnicity, or educational attainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first1=Mary A. |url=https://books.google.com/?id=m-pit1X2O6UC&amp;dq=scientology |title=Science and Spirituality |year=2004 |accessdate=December 14, 2015 |isbn=9781418492946 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major influence was [[Alfred Korzybski]]'s [[General Semantics]].&lt;ref name=Willms2005-54-60 /&gt; Hubbard was friends with fellow science fiction writer [[A. E. van Vogt]], who explored the implications of Korzybski's [[non-Aristotelian logic]] in works such as ''[[The World of Null-A]]'', and Hubbard's view of the ''reactive mind'' has clear and acknowledged parallels with Korzybski's thought; in fact, Korzybski's "anthropometer" may have been what inspired Hubbard's invention of the [[E-meter]].&lt;ref name=Willms2005-54-60 /&gt;

Beyond that, Hubbard himself named a great many other influences in his own writing&amp;nbsp;– in ''Scientology 8-8008'', for example, these include philosophers from [[Anaxagoras]] and [[Aristotle]] to [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Voltaire]], physicists and mathematicians like [[Euclid]] and [[Isaac Newton]], as well as founders of religions such as [[Buddha]], [[Confucius]], [[Jesus]] and [[Mohammed]]&amp;nbsp;– but there is little evidence in Hubbard's writings that he studied these figures to any great depth.&lt;ref name="Willms2005-54-60"&gt;{{harvnb|Willms|2005|pp=54–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted, elements of the Eastern religions are evident in Scientology,&lt;ref name="GA171" /&gt; in particular the concept of [[karma]] found [[Karma in Hinduism|in Hinduism]] and [[Karma in Jainism|Jainism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Wilson (1995): ''{{cite web |url=http://www.neuereligion.de/ENG/collection/diversity/point33.htm |title=Religious Toleration &amp; Religious Diversity |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031204601/http://www.neuereligion.de/ENG/collection/diversity/point33.htm |archivedate=October 31, 2013 }}'', The Institute for the Study of American Religion.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James R. Lewis ''The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements'', p. 429, Oxford University Press US, 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-19-514986-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the links to Hindu texts, Scientology draws from [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Kent, Stephen A. {{cite web |url=http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/~skent/Linkedfiles/Scientology%27s%20Relationship%20With%20Eastern%20Religious%20Traditions%20.htm |title=Scientology's Relationship With Eastern Religious Traditions |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902204426/http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/~skent/Linkedfiles/Scientology%27s%20Relationship%20With%20Eastern%20Religious%20Traditions%20.htm |archivedate=September 2, 2012 }}, ''[[Journal of Contemporary Religion]]'', Vol. 11, No. 1, 1996, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Encyclopedia of Community'', Scientology "shows affinities with Buddhism and a remarkable similarity to first-century Gnosticism."&lt;ref&gt;Karen Christensen, David Levinson (2003): ''Encyclopedia of Community'', SAGE, p. 1210: "Scientology shows affinities with Buddhism and a remarkable similarity to first-century [[Gnosticism]]."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John A. Saliba]] (1996): ''Signs of the Times'', Médiaspaul, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s, Hubbard was in contact with [[John Whiteside Parsons|Jack Parsons]], a rocket scientist and member of the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] then led by [[Aleister Crowley]], and there have been suggestions that this connection influenced some of the ideas and symbols of Scientology.&lt;ref name="Willms259"&gt;{{harvnb|Willms|2009|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Melton7-67 /&gt; Religious scholars [[Gerald Willms]] and [[J. Gordon Melton]] have stated that Crowley's teachings bear little if any resemblance to Scientology doctrine.&lt;ref name=Willms259 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Melton7-67"&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|pp=7–8, 67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

J. Gordon Melton writes that Scientology has its roots in Esoteric thought. He cited the significance of understanding Scientology's appeal as aligned with Esoteric tradition. The Church is a "significant revision" and "meaningful revitalization" within the esoteric tradition. Melton states that Scientology can also be traced back to Gnosticism, Manicheanism, Freemasonry and Theosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Melton |first=J.

According to [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]], Scientology is in the same lineage of [[supernatural]] religious movements such as [[New Thought]]. Scientology goes beyond this and refers to their religio-therapeutic practices as religious technology. Lewis wrote,  "Scientology sees their psycho-spiritual technology as supplying the missing ingredient in existing technologies—namely, the therapeutic engineering of the human psyche."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Lewis | first1 = James R. | title = Scientology | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = March 2009  | location = Cary, NC | isbn = 978-0-19-533149-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientology and hypnosis===
{{Main|Scientology and hypnosis}}
Hubbard was said to be an accomplished hypnotist, and close acquaintances such as [[Forrest Ackerman]] (Hubbard's literary agent) and [[A. E. van Vogt]] (an early supporter of Dianetics) witnessed repeated demonstrations of his hypnotic skills.&lt;ref name="Bare-faced Messiah"&gt;{{cite book|author=Miller, Russell|title=Bare-faced Messiah, The True Story of L.

Ron Hubbard expertise in [[hypnosis]] led to the discovery of the [[Engram (Dianetics)|Dianetic engram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Is Scientology like hypnotism, meditation, psychotherapy or  other mental therapies?|url = http://www.scientology.org/faq/scientology-and-other-practices/is-scientology-like-hypnotism-meditation-psychotherapy.html|website = www.scientology.org|accessdate = December 29, 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Church of Scientology: A History of a New Religion|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8lgHtauc5R4C|publisher = Princeton University Press|date = August 22, 2011|isbn = 978-0691146089|first = Hugh B.|last = Urban}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hubbard wrote that hypnosis is a "wild variable", and compared parlor hypnosis to an atom bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hubbard|first1=L.

===Etymology of "Scientology" and earlier usage===
The word ''Scientology'' is a pairing of the [[Latin]] word ''scientia'' ("knowledge", "skill"), which comes from the verb ''scīre'' ("to know"), and the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] λόγος ''lógos'' ("word" or "account [of]").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cusack|2009|p=394}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin J. Hubbard/John T. Hatfield/James A. Santucci ''An Educator's Classroom Guide to America's Religious Beliefs and Practices'', p. 89, Libraries Unlimited, 2007 {{ISBN|978-1-59158-409-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Scientology'', as coined by L. Ron Hubbard, comes from the Latin ''scio'', which means "knowing, in the fullest meaning of the word" and the Greek word logos, which means "study of". Scientology is further defined as "the study and handling of the spirit in relationship to itself, universes, and other life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/Library/Scientology/Origins/Beginnings.html |title=Beginnings |publisher=Patheos.com |accessdate=September 20, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140402162755/http://www.patheos.com/Library/Scientology/Origins/Beginnings.html |archivedate=April 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term scientology had been used in published works at least twice before Hubbard. In ''The New Word'' (1901) poet and lawyer [[Allen Upward]] first used scientology to mean blind, unthinking acceptance of scientific doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lc7nNIo-UukC&amp;printsec=frontcover The New Word] original version available for download.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, philosopher [[Anastasius Nordenholz]] published ''Scientology: Science of the Constitution and Usefulness of Knowledge'', which used the term to mean the [[Scientific method|science of science]].&lt;ref&gt;Anastasius Nordenholz ''Scientology: Science of the Constitution and Usefulness of Knowledge'', Freie Zone e. V., 1995 {{ISBN|978-3-9804724-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown whether Hubbard was aware of either prior usage of the word.&lt;ref&gt;The New Word, Publisher: Forgotten Books (February 7, 2008), {{ISBN|978-1-60506-811-4}} {{ISBN|978-1-60506-811-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Christianity, Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey W. Bromiley, page 556&lt;/ref&gt;

===ARC and KRC triangles===
{{See also|Scientology terminology|Scientology beliefs and practices#ARC and KRC triangle}}
[[File:Scientology Symbol Logo.png|thumb|upright|The Scientology symbol is composed of the letter S, which stands for Scientology, and the ARC and KRC triangles, two important concepts in Scientology.]]

The ARC and KRC triangles are [[concept map]]s which show a relationship between three concepts to form another concept. These two triangles are present in the Scientology symbol. The lower triangle, the ARC triangle, is a summary representation of the knowledge the Scientologist strives for.&lt;ref name="Neusner" /&gt; It encompasses '''''A'''ffinity'' (affection, love or liking), '''''R'''eality'' (consensual reality) and '''''C'''ommunication'' (the exchange of ideas).&lt;ref name="Neusner" /&gt; Scientology teaches that improving one of the three aspects of the triangle "increases the level" of the other two, but Communication is held to be the most important.&lt;ref name="GA176"&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|Bromley|2006|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upper triangle is the KRC triangle, the letters KRC positing a similar relationship between '''''K'''nowledge'', '''''R'''esponsibility'' and '''''C'''ontrol''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatisscientology.org/html/Part14/Chp50/pg1022.html |title=Scientology Glossary of Terms – K |publisher=Whatisscientology.org |accessdate=May 30, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Scientologists, the letters ARC are used as an affectionate greeting in personal communication, for example at the end of a letter.&lt;ref name="turmoilcook"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/01/scientology_in_3.php |title=Scientology in Turmoil: Debbie Cook's E-Mail, Annotated |last= Ortega|first=Tony |website=[[The Village Voice]] |date=January 6, 2012 |accessdate=January 14, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214000535/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/01/scientology_in_3.php |archivedate=February 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Social problems are ascribed to breakdowns in ARC&amp;nbsp;– in other words, a lack of agreement on reality, a failure to communicate effectively, or a failure to develop affinity.&lt;ref name="GA177"&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|Bromley|2006|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; These can take the form of ''overts''&amp;nbsp;– harmful acts against another, either intentionally or by omission&amp;nbsp;– which are usually followed by ''withholds''&amp;nbsp;– efforts to conceal the wrongdoing, which further increase the level of tension in the relationship.&lt;ref name="GA177" /&gt;

===Bridge to total freedom===
Scientologists seek to attain spiritual development through study of Scientology materials and auditing. The subject (called ''Technology'' or ''Tech'' in [[Scientology terminology|Scientology jargon]]) is structured in a series of levels (or ''gradients'') of gradually increasing complexity. The sequence of study ("training") and auditing ("processing") levels is termed the "[[Bridge to Total Freedom]]", or simply "the Bridge".&lt;ref name="GA176" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Neusner228" /&gt; Training concerns primarily the principles and techniques of auditing.&lt;ref name="Neusner228" /&gt; Processing is personal development through participation in auditing sessions.&lt;ref name="Neusner228"&gt;{{harvnb|DeChant|Jorgenson|2003|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of Scientology teaches the principle of reciprocity, involving give-and-take in every human transaction.&lt;ref name="Melton59-60"&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|pp = 59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, members are required to make donations for study courses and auditing as they move up the Bridge, the amounts increasing as higher levels are reached.&lt;ref name="Melton59-60" /&gt; Participation in higher-level courses on the Bridge may cost several thousand dollars, and Scientologists usually move up the Bridge at a rate governed by their income.&lt;ref name="Melton59-60" /&gt;

According to [[David G. Bromley]], religious studies professor, working toward being an "Operating Thetan" means moving up the Bridge to Total Freedom, "which at the highest level transcends material law." He further emphasizes this belief of Scientologists: "You occasionally come across people in Scientology who say they can change the material world with their mind."&lt;ref name="cnn.com"/&gt;

In April 2015, following the recent release of ''[[Going Clear (film)|Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief]]'', ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' aired a music video featuring the "Church of Neurotology", a parody of Scientology's 1990 music video "[[We Stand Tall]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ortega|first1=Tony|authorlink1=Tony Ortega (journalist)|title=Saturday Night Live's genius spoof of Scientology: Lyrics and images|url=http://tonyortega.org/2015/04/05/saturday-night-lives-genius-spoof-of-scientology-last-night-lyrics-and-images/|accessdate=November 23, 2015|work=The Underground Bunker|date=April 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carlson|first1=Adam|title=SNL's 'Neurotology' Skit Puts Musical Spin on Scientology|url=http://www.people.com/article/snl-spoofs-scientology-with-neurotology-skit|accessdate=November 23, 2015|work=People|date=April 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, cable network A&amp;E began airing ''[[Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath]]'', a documentary series. Remini, a TV actress and star, was a member of the Church of Scientology for over 30 years and a public proponent of Scientology for years before a public falling out in 2013. She is an executive producer of the series. The series follows Remini as she explores the history and workings of the Church, discusses her experiences and interviews ex-members willing to speak out about alleged abuses of the Church. The initial episode drew 2.1&amp;nbsp;million viewers.&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/leah-remini-scientology-documentary-ratings-1201930528/|author=Oriana Schwindt|publisher=variety.com|title=Leah Remini Scientology Doc Premiere Draws 2.1 Million Viewers for A&amp;amp;E &amp;#124; Variety |date= November 30, 2016 |accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shaib''' or '''Sha‘ib''' ({{lang-ar|شعيب}} ''{{transl|ar|Shu‘ayb}}''), or the '''[[Sheikhdom]] of Shaib''' ({{lang-ar|مشيخة الشعيب}} ''{{transl|ar|Mashyakhat ash-Shu‘ayb}}''), was a state in the [[Aden Protectorate]], [[South Arabia]]. The area is now part of the Republic of [[Yemen]].

==History==
The Sha`ib Sheikhdom was established at an uncertain date in the 18th century. After becoming a [[British Empire|British]] protectorate, it eventually joined the [[Federation of Arab Emirates of the South]] as well as its successor, the [[Federation of South Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Dresch. ''A History of Modern Yemen.'' Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
Its last sheikh, Yahya Mohamed Al-Kholaqi Al-Saqladi, was exiled in 1967 upon the founding of the [[People's Republic of South Yemen]]. He died in [[Jeddah]], [[Saudi Arabia]] in July 2001.

===Rulers===
The rulers of the Sha`ib Sheikhdom had the title of ''Shaykh Sha`ib''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Yemen_protectorate.html States of the Aden Protectorates]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7584">{{nihongo|'''Shinichi Fujimura'''|藤村 新一|Fujimura Shin'ichi|b. 4 May 1950}} is a Japanese [[archaeology|archaeologist]] who claimed he had found a large number of stone artifacts dating back to the [[Lower Paleolithic]] and [[Middle Paleolithic]] periods. These objects were later revealed to be [[archaeological forgery|forgeries]].

==Success==
Fujimura was born in [[Kami, Miyagi]], in 1950. After graduating from a high school in [[Sendai]], he obtained a job in a manufacturing company. He became intrigued by archaeology when he was a child, finding shards of [[Jōmon pottery]] in the backyard of his house.&lt;ref name="netsuzo"&gt;''発掘捏造'', 毎日新聞旧石器遺跡取材班, [[Mainichi Shinbun|毎日新聞社]], 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 Fujimura began to study archaeology and to look for Paleolithic [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s during his holidays. Within the few years to follow, he rose to fame among amateur and academic archaeologists in [[Sendai]] by which he was appointed the head of the [[NGO]] group, ''Sekki Bunka Kenkyukai'' in 1975. Fujimura discovered and excavated many Paleolithic stone artifacts in Miyagi prefecture, such as at ''Zazaragi site'' in 1981, ''Nakamine C site'' in 1983 and ''Babadan A site'' in 1984. From a cross-dating investigation of the [[stratum]] these stone tools were estimated to be about 50,000 years old.

He established his reputation as a leading amateur archaeologist because he found most of the artifacts on his own.&lt;ref name="netsuzo"/&gt; He even became known as the archaeologist with the "divine hands".

After this success, he participated in 180 archaeological digs in northern Japan and almost always found artifacts, their age becoming increasingly older. Based on his discoveries the history of the [[Japanese Paleolithic]] period was extended to about 300,000 years. Most of the archaeologists did not question Fujimura's work and this discovery was written in the history [[textbook]]s. Later he gained a position as a deputy director at the private NGO group ''Tohoku Paleolithic Institute''.

==Criticism==
Despite the acquiescence from the archeologists, some geologists and anthropologists claimed the discovery was dubious and lacked consistency with the geologic analysis of the sites.

Toshiki Takeoka at the [[Kyoritsu Women's University|Kyoritsu Joshi University]] published an article&lt;ref&gt;''『前期旧石器』とはどのような石器群か'', 旧石器考古学56, 石器文化談話会, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Stone artifacts which were recently discovered at Japanese Upper Paleolithic sites, such as ''Kamitakamori site'' are so different from the characteristics of these Upper Paleolithic stones.&amp;nbsp;... Those are the same as the stone shafts of the [[Jōmon period]] in their shape or fabrication method.&amp;nbsp;... This site and their archaeological finds are undoubtedly abnormal, a kind of [[OOPARTS]].}}

Shizuo Oda and Charles T. Keally also mentioned some peculiarities in their article&lt;ref&gt;(1986):''A Critical Look at the Palaeolithic and "Lower Palaeolithic" Research in Miyagi Prefecture.'', 人類学雑誌, vol. 94-3, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|After talking to the principal investigators, Okamura and Kamata, and a thorough study of the relevant publications and the lithics themselves, we have concluded that no proven artifacts of human origin predating 30,000 B. P. exist in Miyagi prefecture. The claims of Okamura, Kamata, and some other Miyagi archaeologists that they have discovered a "Lower Palaeolithic" are based on flawed research and are dubious claims.}}

==Disclosure==
On October 23, 2000, Fujimura and his team announced that they had another finding at the ''Kamitakamori site'' near [[Kurihara, Miyagi|Tsukidate town]]. The finds were estimated to be 570,000 years old.

On November 5, 2000, the newspaper ''[[Mainichi Shimbun]]'' published pictures of Fujimura digging holes and burying the artifacts his team later found. The pictures had been taken one day before the finding was announced. Fujimura admitted his forgery in an interview with the newspaper.

Fujimura confessed and apologized the same day in a press conference. He said that he had been "possessed by an uncontrollable urge".&lt;ref name="netsuzo"/&gt; He had planted the artifacts from his own collection in strata that would have indicated earlier dates. In Kamitakamori he had planted 61 of 65 artifacts, and had earlier planted all of the stonework in the [[Soshin Fudozaka]] site in [[Hokkaidō]]. He claimed that these were the only times he had planted artifacts.

The Japanese Archaeological Association disaffiliated Fujimura from its members. A special investigation team of the Association revealed that almost all the artifacts which he had found were his fabrication.

==Aftermath==
In a series of articles in the Japanese magazine ''[[Shūkan Bunshun]]'' published on January 25,&lt;ref&gt;''「第二の神の手」が大分「聖嶽人」周辺にいる!? '', 週刊文春, 1月25日号&lt;/ref&gt; February 1 and March 15, 2001, the magazine alleged that the stone tools discovered at the Hijiridaki cave site (聖嶽洞窟遺跡) in [[Ōita Prefecture]] had also been forgeries, and indicated that [[Mitsuo Kagawa]], a professor at [[Beppu University]], had been involved in that hoax. Kagawa committed suicide and left a suicide note in which he pleaded his innocence.

His family filed a defamation suit against ''Shūkan Bunshun'' the same year. The Ōita district Court and the Fukuoka High Court decided to order the magazine to pay the damages and issue an apology to the family of Kagawa. The magazine appealed to the [[Supreme Court of Japan]], although the appeal was rejected in September 2004. An apology statement was published in the September 2, 2004, issue.

'''Sojourner Truth''' ({{IPAc-en|s|oʊ-|ˈ|dʒ|ɜːr|n|ər|_|ˈ|t|r|uː|θ}}; born '''Isabella ''' ('''Belle''') '''Baumfree'''; {{circa|1797}} – November 26, 1883) was an [[African-American]] [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] and [[women's rights]] activist. Truth was born into [[slavery]] in [[Swartekill, New York|Swartekill]], [[Ulster County, New York]], but escaped with her infant daughter to freedom in 1826. After going to court to recover her son, in 1828 she became the first black woman to win such a case against a white man.

She gave herself the name Sojourner Truth in 1843 after she became convinced that God had called her to leave the city and go into the countryside "testifying the hope that was in her".&lt;ref&gt;The Norton Anthology of African American Literature, 3rd Edition, Vol 1&lt;/ref&gt; Her best-known speech was delivered extemporaneously, in 1851, at the Ohio Women's Rights Convention in [[Akron, Ohio]]. The speech became widely known during the Civil War by the title "[[Ain't I a Woman?]]," a variation of the original speech re-written by someone else using a stereotypical Southern dialect; whereas Sojourner Truth was from New York and grew up speaking [[Dutch language|Dutch]] as her first language. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Truth helped recruit black troops for the [[Union Army]]; after the war, she tried unsuccessfully to secure [[land grant]]s from the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] for former slaves.

In 2014, Truth was included in [[Smithsonian (magazine)|''Smithsonian'']] magazine's list of the "100 Most Significant Americans of All Time".&lt;ref name=smith&gt;"[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonianmag/meet-100-most-significant-Americans-all-time-180953341/?no-ist Meet the 100 Most Significant Americans of All Time]". The Smithsonian. November 17, 2014. Retrieved September 14, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
[[File:1903 HardenberghHouseBk.jpg|thumb|right|240px|House of Col. Johannes Hardenbergh]]
Truth was one of the ten or twelve&lt;ref&gt;The "ten or twelve" figure is from the section "Her brothers and sisters" in the ''Narrative'' (p. 10 in the 1998 Penguin Classics edition edited by [[Nell Irvin Painter]]); it is also used in Painter's biography, ''Sojourner Truth: A Life, A Symbol'' (Norton, 1996), p. 11; and in Carleton Mabee with Susan Mabee Newhouse's biography, ''Sojourner Truth: Slave, Prophet, Legend'' (New York University Press, 1993), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; children born to James and Elizabeth Baumfree (or Bomefree). Colonel Hardenbergh bought James and Elizabeth Baumfree from slave traders and kept their family at his estate in a big hilly area called by the Dutch name [[Swartekill, New York|Swartekill]] (just north of present-day [[Rifton, New York|Rifton]]), in the town of [[Esopus, New York]], {{convert|95|mi}} north of New York City.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|last= Whalin |first= W. Terry |coauthors= |title= Sojourner Truth |publisher= Barbour Publishing, Inc.|year= 1997 |month= |isbn= 978-1-59310-629-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Hardenbergh inherited his father's estate and continued to enslave people as a part of that estate's property.&lt;ref name="Sojourner TruthInstitute"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sojournertruth.org/History/Biography/NY.htm|title=Amazing Life page|work=Sojourner Truth Institute site |accessdate=December 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Charles Hardenbergh died in 1806, nine-year-old Truth (known as Belle), was sold at an auction with a flock of sheep for $100 to John Neely, near [[Kingston, New York]]. Until that time, Truth spoke only Dutch.&lt;ref name="WiH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womeninhistoryohio.com/sojourner-truth-isabella-baumfree.html|title=WOMEN IN HISTORY – SOJOURNER TRUTH|last=|first=|date=February 27, 2013|work=Women in History Ohio|accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later described Neely as cruel and harsh, relating how he beat her daily and once even with a bundle of rods. Neely sold her in 1808, for $105, to Martinus Schryver of [[Port Ewen, New York|Port Ewen]], a tavern keeper, who owned her for eighteen months. Schryver sold her in 1810 to John Dumont of [[West Park, New York]].&lt;ref name="suny"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newpaltz.edu/sojourner_truth/ |title=State University of New York at New Paltz |work=On the trail of Sojourner Truth in Ulster County, New York by Corinne Nyquist Librarian, Sojourner Truth Library |accessdate=March 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this fourth owner was kindly disposed toward her, considerable tension existed between Truth and Dumont's second wife, Elizabeth Waring Dumont, who harassed her and made her life more difficult.&lt;ref name="Washington"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sojourner Truth's America|last = Washington|first = Margaret|publisher = Illinois |year = 2009|isbn = |location = Urbana|pages = 39–53|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QYf7wggeliAC}}&lt;/ref&gt; (John Dumont's first wife, Sarah "Sally" Waring Dumont (Elizabeth's sister), died around 1805, five years before he bought Truth.)&lt;ref name="Washington"/&gt;

Around 1815, Truth met and fell in love with a slave named Robert from a neighboring farm. Robert's owner ([[Charles Catton the younger|Charles Catton, Jr.]], a landscape painter) forbade their relationship; he did not want the people he enslaved to have children with people he was not enslaving, because he would not own the children. One day Robert snuck over to see Truth. When Catton and his son found him, they savagely beat Robert until Dumont finally intervened, and Truth never saw Robert again. He died some years later, perhaps&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/truth/1850/1850.html |title=The Narrative of Sojourner Truth |publisher=Digital.library.upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of the injuries, and the experience haunted Truth throughout her life. Truth eventually married an older slave named Thomas. She bore five children: James, her firstborn, who died in childhood, Diana (1815), fathered by either Robert or John Dumont, and Peter (1821), Elizabeth (1825), and Sophia (ca. 1826), all born after she and Thomas united.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nell Irvin Painter]], ''Sojourner Truth: A Life, A Symbol'' (Norton, 1996), p. 19 and Margaret Washington, "Sojourner Truth's America" .(Illinois, 2009), 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom==
{{Slavery}}
The state of New York began, in 1799, to legislate the abolition of slavery, although the process of emancipating those people enslaved in New York was not complete until July 4, 1827. Dumont had promised to grant Truth her freedom a year before the state emancipation, "if she would do well and be faithful." However, he changed his mind, claiming a hand injury had made her less productive. She was infuriated but continued working, spinning 100 pounds of wool, to satisfy her sense of obligation to him.

Late in 1826, Truth escaped to freedom with her infant daughter, Sophia. She had to leave her other children behind because they were not legally freed in the emancipation order until they had served as bound servants into their twenties. She later said "I did not run off, for I thought that wicked, but I walked off, believing that to be all right."&lt;ref name="WiH"/&gt;

She found her way to the home of Isaac and Maria Van Wagenen in New Paltz, who took her and her baby in. Isaac offered to buy her services for the remainder of the year (until the state's emancipation took effect), which Dumont accepted for $20.&lt;ref name="WiH"/&gt; She lived there until the New York State Emancipation Act was approved a year later.

Truth learned that her son Peter, then five years old, had been sold illegally by Dumont to an owner in [[Alabama]]. With the help of the Van Wagenens, she took the issue to court and in 1828, after months of legal proceedings, she got back her son, who had been abused by those who were enslaving him.&lt;ref name="Sojourner TruthInstitute"/&gt; Truth became one of the first black women to go to court against a white man and win the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/St-Tr/Truth-Sojourner.html|title=Sojourner Truth Biography|last=|first=|date=|website=Encyclopedia of World Biography|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/awhhtml/awlaw3/slavery.html|title=Slavery and Indentured Servants:Law Library of Congress|work=loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Truth had a life-changing religious experience during her stay with the Van Wagenens, and became a devout Christian. In 1829 she moved with her son Peter to New York City, where she worked as a housekeeper for [[Elijah Pierson]], a Christian Evangelist. While in New York, she befriended [[Mary Simpson (house servant)|Mary Simpson]], a grocer on John Street who claimed she had once been enslaved by George Washington. They shared an interest in charity for the poor and became intimate friends. In 1832, she met [[Robert Matthews (religious impostor)|Robert Matthews]], also known as Prophet Matthias, and went to work for him as a housekeeper at the [[Beechwood (Vanderlip mansion)|Matthias Kingdom communal colony]].&lt;ref name="Sojourner TruthInstitute"/&gt; Elijah Pierson died, and Robert Matthews and Truth were accused of stealing from and poisoning him. Both were acquitted of the murder,&lt;ref name="WiH"/&gt; though Matthews was convicted of lesser crimes, served time, and moved west.

In 1839, Truth's son Peter took a job on a whaling ship called the ''Zone of [[Nantucket]]''. From 1840 to 1841, she received three letters from him, though in his third letter he told her he had sent five. Peter said he also never received any of her letters. When the ship returned to port in 1842, Peter was not on board and Truth never heard from him again.&lt;ref name="Sojourner TruthInstitute"/&gt;

==The Result of Freedom==
1843 was a turning point for Truth. She became a [[Methodism|Methodist]], and on June 1, she changed her name to ''Sojourner Truth.'' She told friends: "The Spirit calls me, and I must go" and left to make her way traveling and preaching about the abolition of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;

However, that did not last since Jesus failed to appear in 1843 and then again in 1844. Like many others [[Great Disappointment|disappointed]], Truth distanced herself from her Millerite friends for a while.&lt;ref name="Cervenak"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/300136947/ | title=Gender, Class, And the Performance of a Black (Anti) Enlightenment- Resistances of David Walker and Sojourner Truth | author=Cervenak, Sarah Jane | journal=Palimpsest: A Journal on Women, Gender, and the Black International | year=2012 | volume=1 | issue=1 | pages=68–86 | doi=10.1353/pal.2012.0010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Painter's Introduction"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://sample-2b258f72266e35a7524e8db86daaeeec.read.overdrive.com/?p=narrative-of-sojourner | title=Introduction: Narrative of Sojourner Truth | author=Painter, Nell Irvin | journal=Narrative of Sojourner Truth | year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1844, she joined the Northampton Association of Education and Industry in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]. Founded by abolitionists, the organization supported [[women's rights]] and [[religious tolerance]] as well as [[pacifism]].

Truth started dictating her memoirs to her friend Olive Gilbert, and in 1850 William Lloyd Garrison privately published her book, ''The Narrative of Sojourner Truth: A Northern Slave''.&lt;ref name="WiH"/&gt; That same year, she purchased a home in what would become the village of Florence in Northampton for $300, and spoke at the first [[National Women's Rights Convention]] in Worcester, Massachusetts.

=="Ain't I a Woman?"==
{{Main|Ain't I a Woman?}}
In 1851, Truth joined [[George Thompson (abolitionist)|George Thompson]], an abolitionist and speaker, on a lecture tour through central and western New York State. In May, she attended the Ohio Women's Rights Convention in [[Akron, Ohio]], where she delivered her famous extemporaneous speech on women's rights, later known as "[[Ain't I a Woman]]." Her speech demanded equal human rights for all women as well as for all blacks. Advocating for women and African Americans was dangerous and challenging enough, but being one and doing so was far more difficult. The pressures and severity of her speech did not get to Truth, however. Truth took to the stage with a demanding and composed presence. Audience members were baffled by the way she carried herself and were hesitant to believe  that she was even a woman, prompting the name of her speech "Ain't I a Woman?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/214733030/|title = The Life of the Legendary Sojourner Truth: A New Biography Explores the Facts and Fictions|date = September 13, 1996|accessdate = |website = |publisher = The Chronicle of Higher Education 43.3|last = Winkler|first = Karen J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The convention was organized by [[Hannah Tracy Cutler|Hannah Tracy]] and [[Frances Dana Barker Gage]], who both were present when Truth spoke. Different versions of Truth's words have been recorded, with the first one published a month later in the ''Anti-Slavery Bugle'' by Rev. Marius Robinson, the newspaper owner and editor who was in the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83035487/1851-06-21/ed-1/seq-4/ |title=Women's Rights Convention.

Nor did any of the other newspapers reporting of her speech at the time. Twelve years later, in May 1863, Gage published another, very different, version. In it, Truth's speech pattern had characteristics of Southern slaves, and the speech was vastly different than the one Robinson had reported. Gage's version of the speech became the historic standard version, and is known as "Ain't I a Woman?" because that question was repeated four times.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Maxine Leeds. ''Ain't I A Beauty Queen: Black Women, Beauty, and the Politics of Race'', Oxford University Press USA, 2002, p. 7. {{ISBN|0-19-515262-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is highly unlikely that Truth's own speech pattern was Southern in nature, as she was born and raised in New York, and she spoke only upper New York State low-Dutch until she was nine years old.&lt;ref name=Mabee/&gt;

In contrast to Robinson's report, Gage's 1863 version included Truth saying her 13 children were sold away from her into slavery. Truth is widely believed to have had five children, with one sold away, and was never known to boast more children.&lt;ref name=Mabee&gt;Mabee, Carleton; Susan Mabee Newhouse. ''Sojourner Truth: Slave, Prophet, Legend'', NYU Press, 1995, pp. 67–82. {{ISBN|0-8147-5525-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gage's 1863 recollection of the convention conflicts with her own report directly after the convention: Gage wrote in 1851 that Akron in general and the press in particular were largely friendly to the woman's rights convention, but in 1863 she wrote that the convention leaders were fearful of the "mobbish" opponents.&lt;ref name=Mabee/&gt; Other eyewitness reports of Truth's speech told a calm story, one where all faces were "beaming with joyous gladness" at the session where Truth spoke; that not "one discordant note" interrupted the harmony of the proceedings.&lt;ref name=Mabee/&gt; In contemporary reports, Truth was warmly received by the convention-goers, the majority of whom were long-standing abolitionists, friendly to progressive ideas of race and civil rights.&lt;ref name=Mabee/&gt; In Gage's 1863 version, Truth was met with hisses, with voices calling to prevent her from speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Stanton|editor-first1=Elizabeth Cady|editorlink1=Elizabeth Cady Stanton|editor-last2=Anthony|editor-first2=Susan B.|editorlink2=Susan B.

According to Frances Gage's recount in 1863, Truth argued, "That man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place everywhere. Nobody helps&amp;nbsp;''me''&amp;nbsp;any best place.&amp;nbsp;''And ain't I a woman?"'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://americanhistory.abc-clio.com/Search/Display/255207?webSiteCode=SLN_AMHIST&amp;returnToPage=%2fSearch%2fDisplay%2f255207&amp;token=01CE12D3C06E488B455F883D9DE91E77&amp;casError=False|title=Sojourner Truth: Ain't I a Woman? speech (1851)|last=|first=|date=|website=ABC-CLIO|accessdate=October 26, 2017|df=mdy-all}}{{dead link|date=June 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Truth's " Ain't I a Woman" showed the lack of recognition that Black women received during this time and whose lack of recognition will continue to be seen long after her time. " Black women, of course, were virtually invisible within the protracted campaign for woman suffrage" as said by Davis supports Truth's argument that nobody gives her "any best place" but not only her but Black women in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women, Race, and Class|last=Davis|first=Angela|publisher=Vintage Books A Division of Random House|year=1981|isbn=|location=|pages=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next 10 years, Truth spoke before dozens, perhaps hundreds, of audiences. From 1851 to 1853, Truth worked with Marius Robinson, the editor of the Ohio ''Anti-Slavery Bugle'', and traveled around that state speaking. In 1853, she spoke at a [[Women's suffrage|suffragist]] "mob convention" at the [[Broadway Tabernacle]] in New York City; that year she also met [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]].&lt;ref name="Sojourner TruthInstitute"/&gt; In 1856, she traveled to [[Battle Creek, Michigan]], to speak to a group called the "Friends of Human Progress." In 1858, someone interrupted a speech and accused her of being a man; Truth opened her blouse and revealed her breasts.&lt;ref name="Sojourner TruthInstitute"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WiH"/&gt;''

==Other notable speeches==
'''Northampton Camp Meeting'''—-1844, Northampton, Massachusetts: At a [[camp meeting]] where she was participating as an itinerant preacher, a band of "wild young men" disrupted the camp meeting, refused to leave, and threatened to burn down the tents.  Truth caught the sense of fear pervading the worshipers and hid behind a trunk in her tent, thinking that since she was the only black person present, the mob would attack her first.  However, she reasoned with herself and resolved to do something: as the noise of the mob increased and a female preacher was "trembling on the preachers' stand," Truth went to a small hill and began to sing "in her most fervid manner, with all the strength of her most powerful voice, the hymn on the resurrection of Christ." Her song, "It was Early in the Morning," gathered the rioters to her and quieted them. They urged her to sing, preach, and pray for their entertainment. After singing songs and preaching for about an hour, Truth bargained with them to leave after one final song. The mob agreed and left the camp meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Sojourner Truth, ''Narrative of Sojourner Truth; A Bondswoman of Olden Time, with a History of Her Labors and Correspondence Drawn from her "Book of Life"'' (New York: Oxford UP, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abolitionist Convention'''—-1840s, Boston, Massachusetts: [[William Lloyd Garrison]] invited Sojourner Truth to give a speech at an annual antislavery convention.  Wendell Phillips was supposed to speak after her, which made her nervous since he was known as such a good orator.  So Truth sang a song, "I am Pleading for My people," which was her own original composition sung to the tune of [[Auld Lang Syne]].&lt;ref&gt;"Sojourner Truth. An Interesting Talk with this Famous Colored Woman," Chicago Daily Inter-Ocean, 13 August 1879.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mob Convention'''—September 7, 1853: At the convention, young men greeted her with "a perfect storm," hissing and groaning. In response, Truth said, "You may hiss as much as you please, but women will get their rights anyway. You can't stop us, neither".&lt;ref name=Mabee/&gt; Sojourner, like other public speakers, often adapted her speeches to how the audience was responding to her. In her speech, Sojourner speaks out for women's rights. She incorporates religious references in her speech, particularly the story of [[Esther]]. She then goes on to say that, just as women in scripture, women today are fighting for their rights. Moreover, Sojourner scolds the crowd for all their hissing and rude behavior, reminding them that God says to "Honor thy father and thy mother."&lt;ref name=Montgomery&gt;{{cite book|last=Montgomery|first=Janey|title=A Comparative Analysis of the Rhetoric of Two Negro Women Orators—Sojourner Truth and Frances E. Watkins Harper|year=1968|publisher=Fort Hays Kansas State College|location=Hays, Kansas|pages=25–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''American Equal Rights Association'''—May 9–10, 1867: Her speech was addressed to the [[American Equal Rights Association]], and divided into three sessions. Sojourner was received with loud cheers instead of hisses, now that she had a better-formed reputation established. ''The Call'' had advertised her name as one of the main convention speakers.&lt;ref name=Montgomery/&gt; For the first part of her speech, she spoke mainly about the rights of black women. Sojourner argued that because the push for equal rights had led to black men winning new rights, now was the best time to give black women the rights they deserve too. Throughout her speech she kept stressing that "we should keep things going while things are stirring" and fears that once the fight for colored rights settles down, it would take a long time to warm people back up to the idea of colored women's having equal rights.&lt;ref name=Montgomery/&gt;

In the second sessions of Sojourner's speech, she utilized a story from the Bible to help strengthen her argument for equal rights for women. She ended her argument by accusing men of being self-centered, saying, "man is so selfish that he has got women's rights and his own too, and yet he won't give women their rights. He keeps them all to himself." For the final session of Sojourner's speech, the center of her attention was mainly on women's right to vote. Sojourner told her audience that she owned her own house, as did other women, and must therefore pay taxes. Nevertheless, they were still unable to vote because they were women. Black women who were enslaved were made to do hard manual work, such as building roads. Sojourner argues that if these women were able to perform such tasks, then they should be allowed to vote because surely voting is easier than building roads.

'''Eighth Anniversary of Negro Freedom'''—New Year's Day, 1871: On this occasion the Boston papers related that "...seldom is there an occasion of more attraction or greater general interest. Every available space of sitting and standing room was crowded".&lt;ref name=Montgomery/&gt; She starts off her speech by giving a little background about her own life. Sojourner recounts how her mother told her to pray to God that she may have good masters and mistresses. She goes on to retell how her masters were not good to her, about how she was whipped for not understanding English, and how she would question God why he had not made her masters be good to her. Sojourner admits to the audience that she had once hated white people, but she says once she met her final master, Jesus, she was filled with love for everyone. Once enslaved folks were emancipated, she tells the crowd she knew her prayers had been answered.
That last part of Sojourner's speech brings in her main focus. Some freed enslaved people were living on government aid at that time, paid for by taxpayers. Sojourner announces that this is not any better for those colored people than it is for the members of her audience. She then proposes that black people are given their own land. Because a portion of the South's population contained rebels that were unhappy with the abolishment of slavery, that region of the United States was not well suited for colored people. She goes on to suggest that colored people be given land out west to build homes and prosper on.

'''Second Annual Convention of the American Woman Suffrage Association'''—Boston, 1871: In a brief speech, Truth argued that women's rights were essential, not only to their own well-being, but "for the benefit of the whole creation, not only the women, but all the men on the face of the earth, for they were the mother of them."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Votes for Women|last=Baker|first=Jean|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York|pages=52|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1856, Truth bought a neighboring lot in Northampton, but she did not keep the new property for long. On September 3, 1857, she sold all her possessions, new and old, to Daniel Ives and moved to [[Battle Creek, Michigan]], where she rejoined former members of the Millerite Movement who had formed the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]. Antislavery movements had begun early in Michigan and Ohio. Here, she also joined the nucleus of the Michigan abolitionists, the Progressive Friends, some who she had already met at national conventions.&lt;ref name="Washington"/&gt; According to the 1860 [[United States Census|census]], her household in Harmonia included her daughter, Elizabeth Banks (age 35), and her grandsons James Caldwell (misspelled as "Colvin"; age 16) and Sammy Banks (age 8).&lt;ref name="Sojourner TruthInstitute"/&gt;

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Truth helped recruit black troops for the [[Union Army]]. Her grandson, James Caldwell, enlisted in the [[54th Massachusetts Regiment]]. In 1864, Truth was employed by the National Freedman's Relief Association in Washington, D.C., where she worked diligently to improve conditions for African-Americans. In October of that year, she met [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref name="Sojourner TruthInstitute"/&gt; In 1865, while working at the [[Freedman's Hospital]] in Washington, Truth rode in the streetcars to help force their [[desegregation]].&lt;ref name="Sojourner TruthInstitute"/&gt;

Truth is credited with writing a song, "[[s:The Valiant Soldiers|The Valiant Soldiers]]", for the [[102nd Regiment United States Colored Troops|1st Michigan Colored Regiment]]; it was said to be composed during the war and sung by her in Detroit and Washington, D.C. It is sung to the tune of "[[John Brown's Body]]" or "[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]".&lt;ref name="DocSouth"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/truth84/truth84.html |title=Documenting the American South |work=Narrative of Sojourner Truth |accessdate=November 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Truth claimed to have written the words, it has been disputed (see "[[Marching Song of the First Arkansas]]").

In 1867, Truth moved from Harmonia to Battle Creek. In 1868, she traveled to western New York and visited with [[Amy Post]], and continued traveling all over the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. At a speaking engagement in [[Florence, Massachusetts]], after she had just returned from a very tiring trip, when Truth was called upon to speak she stood up and said "Children, I have come here like the rest of you, to hear what I have to say."&lt;ref name="SJBIO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Oracle/9840/sojourn.html|title=Sojourner Truth page|work=Sojourner Truth Biography |accessdate=December 28, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051222032347/http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Oracle/9840/sojourn.html|archivedate=December 22, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870, Truth tried to secure [[land grant]]s from the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] to former enslaved people, a project she pursued for seven years without success. While in Washington, D.C., she had a meeting with President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in the [[White House]]. In 1872, she returned to Battle Creek, became active in Grant's presidential re-election campaign, and even tried to vote on Election Day, but was turned away at the polling place.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Truth spoke about abolition, women's rights, prison reform, and preached to the Michigan Legislature against capital punishment. Not everyone welcomed her preaching and lectures, but she had many friends and staunch support among many influential people at the time, including [[Amy Post]], [[Parker Pillsbury]], [[Frances Dana Barker Gage|Frances Gage]], [[Wendell Phillips]], [[William Lloyd Garrison]], [[Laura Smith Haviland]], [[Lucretia Mott]], [[Ellen G. White]], and [[Susan B. Anthony]]."&lt;ref name="SJBIO"/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Several days before Sojourner Truth died, a reporter came from the ''Grand Rapids Eagle'' to interview her. "Her face was drawn and emaciated and she was apparently suffering great pain. Her eyes were very bright and mind alert although it was difficult for her to talk."&lt;ref name="Sojourner TruthInstitute"/&gt; Truth died at her Battle Creek home on November 26, 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Today in History – November 26|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/today-in-history/november-26/|website=The Library of Congress|accessdate=November 25, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 28 her funeral was held at the [[Congregational-Presbyterian Church]] officiated by its pastor, the Reverend Reed Stuart. Some of the prominent citizens of Battle Creek acted as pall-bearers. Truth was buried in the city's Oak Hill Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;Titus, Frances. "In Memoriam".

'''Turks in Poland''' are people of [[Turkish people|Turkish]] ethnicity living in [[Poland]] who form one of the country's smaller minority groups.

== Facts and figures ==

There is little coherent statistical data regarding the numbers of Turks residing in Poland. The majority of Turks live in Warsaw and Łódź but there are also Turkish communities in Gdańsk, Poznań, Krakow and Wroclaw and students in small cities like Lublin or Krosno.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/7322801/Turkish_Community_in_Poland_from_Textile_Vendors_to_Top_Managers Pędziwiatr, K.

== Turkish community ==
Many Turks in Poland are entrepreneurs and investors.&lt;ref name="UnitedNations"&gt;{{Harvnb|United Nations Human Settlements Programme|2004|loc=95}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demographics ===

'''''Untermensch''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʔʊntɐˌmɛnʃ}}, ''underman'', ''sub-man'', ''subhuman''; plural: ''Untermenschen'') is a term that became infamous when the [[Nazism and race|Nazis]] used it to describe non-Aryan "inferior people" often referred to as "the masses from the East", that is [[Jews]], [[Romani people|Roma]], and [[Slavs]] – mainly ethnic [[Poles]], [[Serbs]], and later also [[Russians]].&lt;ref&gt;Revisiting the National Socialist Legacy: Coming to Terms With Forced Labor, Expropriation, Compensation, and Restitution page 84 Oliver Rathkolb&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gumkowski"&gt;{{cite book  |url=http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409034704/http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=9 April 2011 |title=Hitler's Plans for Eastern Europe| first1=Janusz |last1=Gumkowski |first2=Kazimierz |last2=Leszczynski |first3=Edward (translator) |last3=Robert |work=Poland Under Nazi Occupation |format=Paperback |pages=219 |publisher=Polonia Pub.

The Holocaust: A Reader. Malden, Massachusetts, USA; Oxford, England, UK; Carlton, Victoria, Australia: Blackwell Publishing, 2005. p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Generalplan Ost]]'', the Slavic population of [[East-Central Europe]] was to be reduced in part through [[Holocaust victims#Slavs|mass murder in the Holocaust]], with a majority expelled to Asia and used as [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|slave labor]] in the Reich.

== Etymology == 
Although usually incorrectly considered to have been coined by the Nazis, the term "under man" was first used by American author and [[Klansman]] [[Lothrop Stoddard]] in the title of his 1922 book ''The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of the Under-man''.&lt;ref name = "Stoddard"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stoddard uses the term for those he considers unable to function in civilisation, which he generally (but not entirely) attributes on racial grounds. It was later adopted by the Nazis from that book's German version ''Der Kulturumsturz: Die Drohung des Untermenschen'' (1925).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The German word ''Untermensch'' had been used earlier, but not in a racial sense, for example in the 1899 novel ''[[Der Stechlin]]'' by [[Theodor Fontane]]. Since most writers who employed the term did not address the question of when and how the word entered the German language, ''Untermensch'' is usually translated into English as "sub-human." The leading Nazi attributing the concept of the [[East-European]] "under man" to Stoddard is [[Alfred Rosenberg]] who, referring to Russian communists, wrote in his ''[[Der Mythus des 20. Jahrhunderts]]'' (1930) that "this is the kind of human being that Lothrop Stoddard has called the 'under man.'"

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quoting Stoddard: "The Under-Man – the man who measures under the standards of capacity and adaptability imposed by the social order in which he lives".

It is possible that Stoddard constructed his "under man" as an opposite to [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ''[[Übermensch]]'' (superman) concept. Stoddard does not say so explicitly, but he refers critically to the "superman" idea at the end of his book (p.&amp;nbsp;262).&lt;ref name = "Stoddard"/&gt; Wordplays with Nietzsche's term seem to have been used repeatedly as early as the 19th century and, due to the German linguistic trait of being able to combine [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefixes]] and [[root (linguistics)|root]]s almost at will in order to create new words, this development can be considered logical. For instance, German author [[Theodor Fontane]] contrasts the ''Übermensch/Untermensch'' word pair in chapter 33 of his novel ''Der Stechlin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

More than four years ago, on 2006-12-23T06:46:27, an anonymous user with the IP 12.21.214.71 changed the actual name of the book, "Der Stechlin", for "Der Pharrt", probably because it's a homophone of fart. Very funny, yes, but this mistake has remained undetected for years and has also been copied to Wikipedia mirrors. In case you spot this information anywhere, it is complete and utter nonsense.

--&gt; Nietzsche used ''Untermensch'' at least once in contrast to ''Übermensch'' in ''[[Die fröhliche Wissenschaft]]'' (1882); however, he did so in reference to semi-human creatures in [[mythology]], naming them alongside [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarfs]], [[Fairy|fairies]], [[centaur]]s and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Nuremberg laws.jpg|thumb|right|375px|A chart used to illustrate the Nazi [[Nuremberg Laws]] introduced in 1935]]

In a speech in 1927 to the Bavarian regional parliament, the Nazi propagandist [[Julius Streicher]], publisher of ''[[Der Stürmer]],'' used the term ''Untermensch'' referring to the communists of the German [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]]:

: It happened at the time of the [Bavarian] Soviet Republic: When the unleashed subhumans rambled murdering through the streets, the deputies hid behind a chimney in the Bavarian parliament.&lt;ref&gt;"Kampf dem Weltfeind", Stürmer publishing house, Nuremberg, 1938, 05/25/1927, speech in the Bavarian regional parliament, German: "Es war zur Zeit der Räteherrschaft. Als das losgelassene Untermenschentum mordend durch die Straßen zog, da versteckten sich Abgeordnete hinter einem Kamin im bayerischen Landtag."&lt;/ref&gt;

Nazis repeatedly used the term ''Untermensch'' in writings and speeches directed against the Jews, the most notorious example being a 1942 SS publication with the title ''Der Untermensch'', which contains an [[Anti-Semitism|antisemitic]] tirade sometimes considered to be an extract from a speech by [[Heinrich Himmler]]. In the pamphlet "The SS as an Anti-Bolshevist Fighting Organization", published in 1936, Himmler wrote:

In his speech "''Weltgefahr des Bolschewismus''" ("World danger of Bolshevism") in 1936, [[Joseph Goebbels]] said that "subhumans exist in every people as a [[leavening agent]]".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Meier-Benneckenstein, ''Deutsche Hochschule für Politik'' Titel: ''Dokumente der Deutschen Politik,'' Volume 4, Junker und Dünnhaupt Verlag, Berlin, 2. ed., 1937; speech held on 10 September 1936; In German: "... das Untermenschentum, das in jedem Volke als Hefe vorhanden ist ...".&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1935 Nazi party congress rally at Nuremberg, Goebbels also declared that "Bolshevism is the declaration of war by Jewish-led international subhumans against culture itself."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/media_fi.php?MediaId=192 Goebbels speech at the 1935 Nuremberg Rally]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of the use of the term ''Untermensch'', this time in connection with anti-Soviet propaganda, is a brochure entitled "''Der Untermensch''", edited by Himmler and distributed by the [[SS-Rasse- und Siedlungshauptamt|Race and Settlement Head Office]]. SS-Obersturmführer Ludwig Pröscholdt, Jupp Daehler and SS-Hauptamt-Schulungsamt Koenig are associated with its production.&lt;ref name=pamphlet1942&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/holoprelude/deruntermensch.html |title=Der Untermensch "The subhuman" |author=Reichsführer-SS |publisher=SS Office |location=Berlin |year=1942 |accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Published in 1942 after the start of [[Operation Barbarossa]], the German invasion of the Soviet Union, it is around 50 pages long and consists for the most part of photos portraying the enemy in an extremely negative way (see link below for the title page). 3,860,995 copies were printed in the German language. It was translated into Greek, French, Dutch, Danish, Bulgarian, Hungarian, Czech and seven other languages. The pamphlet says the following:

{{quotation|Just as the night rises against the day, the light and dark are in eternal conflict. So too, is the subhuman the greatest enemy of the dominant species on earth, mankind. The subhuman is a biological creature, crafted by nature, which has hands, legs, eyes and mouth, even the semblance of a brain. Nevertheless, this terrible creature is only a partial human being.

Although it has features similar to a human, the subhuman is lower on the spiritual and psychological scale than any animal. Inside of this creature lies wild and unrestrained passions: an incessant need to destroy, filled with the most primitive desires, chaos and coldhearted villainy.

A subhuman and nothing more!

Not all of those who appear human are in fact so. Woe to him who forgets it!

Mulattoes and Finn-Asian barbarians, Gipsies and black skin savages all make up this modern underworld of subhumans that is always headed by the appearance of the eternal Jew.&lt;ref name=pamphlet1942 /&gt;}}

Nazis classified those they called the sub-humans into different types; they placed priority on extermination of the Jews, and exploitation of others as slaves.&lt;ref&gt;''Quality of Life: The New Medical Dilemma'', edited by James J. Walter, Thomas Anthony Shannon, page 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Robert Jan van Pelt]] writes that for the Nazis, "it was only a small step to a rhetoric pitting the European Mensch against the Soviet ''Untermensch'', which had come to mean a Russian in the clutches of [[Judeo-Bolshevism]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The Nazi views on the [[Slavs]] were explicitly contemptuous, as even prior to the World War II, Slavs, particularly the Poles, were deemed as being inferior to Germans. After Adolf Hitler gained political power in Germany, the concept of Non-Aryan "sub-human slave-material" was developed and started to be used also towards other Slavic peoples.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Timm, Annette F. (2010) ''The Politics of Fertility in Twentieth-Century Berlin''. London: Cambridge University Press. p.188 {{isbn|9780521195393}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Poles]] and [[Serbs]] were at the bottom of the Slavic "racial hierarchy" established by the Nazis.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} Soon after [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] expired, also [[Russians]] started to be seen as part of the "subhuman" race. Similarly, also [[Belarusians]], [[Czechs]], [[Slovaks]], and [[Ukrainians]] were considered to be inferior, despite some collaborative groups were found among these nations. Nonetheless, there were Slavs such as [[Bosniaks]], [[Bulgarians]], and [[Croats]] who [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaborated with Nazi Germany]] that were still being perceived as not racially "pure" enough to reach the status of [[Germanic peoples]], yet they were eventually considered ethnically better than all other Slavs, mostly due to pseudoscientific theories about these nations having a minimal amount of Slavic genes and considerable admixtures of Germanic and Turkic blood.&lt;ref name="Gumkowski"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Shirer|Shirer, William L.]] (1960) ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich]]''. New York: Simon and Schuster. pp.937, 939. Quotes: "The Jews and the Slavic people were the ''Untermenschen'' &amp;ndash; subhumans." (937); "[The] obsession of the Germans with the idea that they were the master race and that Slavic people must be their slaves was especially virulent in regard to Russia. [[Erich Koch]], the roughneck Reich Commissar for ''the Ukraine'', expressed it in a speech at Kiev on March 5, 1945.&lt;blockquote&gt;We are the Master Race and must govern hard but just ... I will draw the very last out of this country. I did not come to spread bliss ... The population must work, work, and work again [...] We are a master race, which must remember that the lowliest German worker is racially and biologically a thousand times more valuable than the population [of the Ukraine]. (emphasis added)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

In order to forge a strategic alliance with the [[Independent State of Croatia]] &amp;ndash; a [[puppet state]] created after the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] &amp;ndash; and the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]], the Nazis deviated from a strict interpretation of their racial ideology, and Croats were officially described as "more Germanic than Slav", a notion supported by Croatia's fascist dictator [[Ante Pavelić]] who maintained that the "Croatians were descendants of the ancient [[Goths]]" and "had the [[Pan-Slavism|Panslav idea]] forced upon them as something artificial".&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Norman (1974) ''Hitler's War Aims: the Establishment of the New Order''.

Norton &amp; Company.  p.276-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weinberg"&gt;[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler, Adolf]] and  Weinberg, Gerhard (2007) ''Hitler's Table Talk, 1941-1944: His Private Conversations''. Enigma Books.  p.356. Quoting Hitler: "For example to label the Bulgarians as Slavs is pure nonsense; originally they were Turkomans."&lt;/ref&gt; However the Nazi regime continued to classify Croats as a "subhuman" in spite of the alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Norman (2008) ''[[Europe at War 1939–1945: No Simple Victory]]''. Pan Macmillan. pp.167,209.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hitler also deemed the Bulgarians to be "[[Turkmen people|Turkoman]]" in origin.&lt;ref name="Weinberg" /&gt;

While the Nazis were inconsistent in the implementation of their policy &amp;ndash; for instance, mostly implementing the [[Final Solution]] while also implementing [[Generalplan Ost]] &amp;ndash; the [[Democide|democidal]] death toll was in tens of millions of victims.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, L (1997) ''The Nazis: A Warning from History'', BBC Books, P126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mazower, M (2008) ''Hitler's Empire: How the Nazis Ruled Europe'', Penguin Press P197&lt;/ref&gt; It is related to the concept of "[[life unworthy of life]]", a more specific term which originally referred to the severely disabled who were [[involuntary euthanasia|involuntarily euthanised]] in [[Action T4]], and was eventually applied to the extermination of the Jews.

In the directive No. 1306 by [[w:Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] from October 24th 1939, the term "Untermensch" is used in reference to Polish ethnicity and culture, as follows: {{quotation|It must become clear to everybody in Germany, even to the last milkmaid, that Polishness is equal to subhumanity. Poles, Jews and Gypsies are on the same inferior level. This must be clearly outlined [...] until every citizen of Germany has it encoded in his subconsciousness that every Pole, whether a worker or intellectual, should be treated like vermin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wegner|first=Bernt|title=From Peace to War: Germany, Soviet Russia, and the World, 1939-1941|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aESBIpIm6UcC&amp;pg=PA50|year=1997|origyear=1991|publisher=[[Berghahn Books]]|isbn=978-1-57181-882-9|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Tomasz |last=Ceran|title=The History of a Forgotten German Camp: Nazi Ideology and Genocide at Szmalcówka|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e-EjCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24|year=2015|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-0-85773-553-9|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Biology classes in Nazi Germany schools taught about differences between the race of Nordic German "''Übermenschen''" and "ignoble" Jewish and Slavic "subhumans".&lt;ref&gt;''Hitler Youth, 1922–1945: An Illustrated History'' by Jean-Denis Lepage, page 91&lt;/ref&gt; The view that Slavs were subhuman was widespread among the German masses, and chiefly applied to the Poles. It continued to find support after the war.&lt;ref&gt;''Native Realm: A Search for Self Definition'' by [[Czeslaw Milosz]], page 132&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war, Nazi propaganda instructed Wehrmacht officers told their soldiers to target people described as "Jewish Bolshevik subhumans" and that the war in the Soviet Union was between the Germans and the Jewish, Gypsies and Slavic ''Untermenschen''.&lt;ref&gt; Richard J. Evans, ''In Hitler's Shadow'' (1999), pp. 59–60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Burleigh, ''The Third Reich: A New History'' (2000), p. 512&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Warsaw Uprising]], Himmler ordered the destruction of the [[Warsaw Ghetto|Warsaw ghetto]] because according to him it allowed the "living space" of 500,000 subhumans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Warsaw Ghetto: Himmler Orders the Destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/himmler-orders-the-destruction-of-the-warsaw-ghetto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yits?a?

As a pragmatic way to solve military manpower shortages, the Nazis used soldiers from some Slavic countries, firstly from the Reich's allies [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]] and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]&lt;ref&gt;According to Nazi policy the Croats were classified as more "Germanic than Slavic"; this was supported by Croatia's fascist dictator [[Ante Pavelić]], who maintained that the Croatians were descendants of the ancient [[Goths]] and "had the Pan-Slav idea forced upon them as something artificial".&lt;br /&gt; Rich, Norman (1974).

Pp. 167, 209.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the Slavs in particular being ''Untermenschen'' served the Nazis' political goals; it was used to justify their expansionist policy and especially their aggression against [[Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union]] in order to achieve ''[[Lebensraum]]'', particularly in [[Ukraine]]. Early plans of the German Reich (summarized as ''Generalplan Ost'') envisioned the displacement, enslavement, and elimination of no fewer than 50 million people, who were not considered fit for [[Germanization]], from territories it wanted to conquer in Europe; Ukraine's [[chernozem]] ("black earth") soil was considered a particularly desirable zone for colonization by the ''[[Herrenvolk]]'' ("master race").&lt;ref name="Hitlers_Plans" /&gt;

Involving altercations between [[Filipino American]] farm workers and local residents [[Nativism (politics)|opposed to immigration]], the riots highlighted the racial and socioeconomic tensions in California's agricultural communities.&lt;ref&gt;De Witt 1979, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Internal migration===
{{See also|History of Filipino Americans}}

As [[United States nationality law#Nationals who are not citizens|U.S. nationals]], Filipinos had the legal right to work in the United States, and as early as 1906 they were working on Hawaii's sugar and pineapple plantations as full-time laborers. Assuming the Filipino workers' unfamiliarity with their rights, employers paid ''[[sakadas]]'' the lowest wages among all ethnic laborers; and Filipinos were introduced as [[strikebreakers]] as part of a [[divide and rule]] strategy to prevent cross-ethnic mobilization and thereby ensure smooth production processes .&lt;ref&gt;[http://opmanong.ssc.hawaii.edu/filipino/filmig.html Filipino Migration to the United States, University of Hawaii]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Immigration Acts of [[Immigration Act of 1917|1917]] and [[Immigration Act of 1924|1924]], which targeted non-whites of Asian descent, allowed Filipinos to answer the growing demand for labor on the U.S. mainland. From the 1920s on, "overwhelmingly young, single, and male"&lt;ref&gt;Lee and Yung 2011, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; Filipinos migrated to the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]], joining Mexicans in positions previously filled by Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, and Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Guerin-Gonzales 1994, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In California, Filipinos were the dominant Asian farm labor force during the next two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Lee and Yung 2011, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Farm life===
Filipino laborers' resilience in harsh working conditions made them favorite recruits among farm operators. In California's [[Santa Clara Valley|Santa Clara]] and [[San Joaquin Valley|San Joaquin]] Valleys, Filipinos were often assigned to the backbreaking work of cultivating and harvesting asparagus, celery, and lettuce.  As in Hawaii, the industry and perceived passivity of these [[Little Brown Brother|little brown brothers]] were used to counter the so-called  "laziness" of working-class whites and other ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Baldoz 2011, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to gender bias in immigration policy and hiring practices, of the 30,000 Filipino laborers following the cycle of seasonal farm work, only 1 in 14 were women.&lt;ref&gt;San Juan, Jr. 2000, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to meet Filipinas, Filipino farm workers sought the companionship of women outside their own ethnic community, which further aggravated mounting racial discord.

==Mounting tensions==
In the next few years, white men decrying the takeover of jobs and white women by Filipinos resorted  to vigilantism to deal with the "third Asiatic invasion." Filipino laborers frequenting pool halls or attending street fairs in [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], [[Dinuba]], [[Exeter, California|Exeter]], and [[Fresno]] risked being attacked by [[nativists]] threatened by the swelling labor pool as well as the Filipino's presumed predatory sexual nature.&lt;ref&gt;Lee and Yung 2010, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1929, Filipinos at a street carnival in [[Exeter, California|Exeter]] were shot with rubber bands as they walked with their white female companions. In response to the knifing of a heckler, a mob of 300 white men led by then Chief of Police C. E. Joyner burned the barn of a rancher known to hire Filipinos; and Joyner ordered the shutdown of a nearby labor camp. According to local press, the riot was caused primarily by Filipinos' insistence on equal treatment by white women.&lt;ref&gt;De Witt 1979, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months later, in the morning of December 2, 1929, in Watsonville, a coastal town 189 miles (304&amp;nbsp;km) away, police raided a boardinghouse and found two white girls, aged 16 and 11, sleeping in the same room with Perfecto Bandalan, a 25-year-old lettuce grower. The Watsonville community was outraged and remained so even after learning that Bandalan and 16-year-old Esther Schmick were engaged, and that they were caring for Esther's sister Bertha at her mother's request.&lt;ref&gt;Baldoz 2011, pp. 124-125.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Riots==

Near midnight on January 18, 1930, 500 white men and youths gathered outside a Filipino dance club in the Palm Beach section of Watsonville. The club was owned by a Filipino man and offered dances with the nine white women who lived there. The mob came with clubs and weapons intending to take the women out and burn the place down. The owners threatened to shoot if the rioters persisted, and when the mob refused to leave, the owners opened fire. Police broke up the fight with gas bombs. Two days later, on January 20, a group of Filipino men met with a group of white men near the Pajaro River bridge to settle the score. A group of hispanic men then arrived and took sides with the whites. The riot began and continued for five days.

Hunting parties were organized; the white mob was run like a "military" operation with leaders giving orders to attack or withdraw. They dragged Filipinos from their homes and beat them. They threw Filipinos off the Pajaro River bridge. They ranged up the San Juan road to attack Filipinos at the Storm and Detlefsen ranches; at Riberal's labor camp, twenty-two Filipinos were dragged out and beaten almost to death. A Chinese apple-dryer that employed Filipinos was demolished; shots were fired into a Filipino home on Ford Street; and 22-year-old Fermin Tobera died after being shot in the heart when he was hiding in a closet with 11 others, trying to avoid the rounds of bullets fired at a bunkhouse in Murphy Ranch in San Juan Road on the 23rd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/localnews/ci_18824721 Riots in 1930 revealed Watsonville racism: California apologizes to Filipino Americans]&lt;/ref&gt;

The police in Watsonville, led by Sheriff Nick Sinnott, gathered as many Filipinos as they could rescue and guarded them in the City Council's chamber while Monterey County Sheriff Carl Abbott secured the Pajaro side of the river against further riot.

The mob finally went home on the 25th.

==Aftermath==
The violence spread to Stockton, San Francisco, San Jose, and other cities. A Filipino club was blown up in Stockton, and the blast was blamed on the Filipinos themselves. In [[Gilroy, California|Gilroy]], masked men warned a Japanese farmer to discharge his Filipinos. Fifty unemployed whites and Filipinos were hustled out of town by police, trying to preempt possible fighting.

Many Filipinos fled the country. News of the riots spread to the Philippines, where there were protests in solidarity. The body of Fermin Tobera was sent to [[Manila]], where he is considered a [[martyr]], a symbol of the Filipinos' fight for independence and equality.

The five days of the Watsonville riots had a profound impact on California's attitude toward imported Asian labor. As a result, Filipino immigration plummeted, and while they remained a significant part of the labor in the fields, they began to be replaced by Mexicans.

Yet, seven months after the Watsonville riots, Filipino lettuce pickers carried out a successful strike in Salinas for better treatment. These strikes were repeated again in the [[Salinas Lettuce Strike of 1934]] and in 1936. In addition, although their relationships were frowned upon, white women and Filipino men continued to meet and marry.

In September 4, 2011, California apologized to Filipinos and [[Filipino Americans]] in an Assembly resolution authored by Assemblyman [[Luis Alejo]], [[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Salinas, California|Salinas]]. "Filipino Americans have a proud history of hard work and perseverance," Alejo said in a statement. "California, however, does not have as proud a history regarding its treatment of Filipino Americans. For these past injustices, it's time that we recognize the pain and suffering this community has endured."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/localnews/ci_18824721 Riots in 1930 revealed Watsonville racism: California apologizes to Filipino Americans]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The looting of Polish cultural artifacts during World War II''' was carried out by [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] side by side after the [[invasion of Poland]] of 1939. A significant portion of Poland's cultural heritage, estimated at about half a million art objects, was plundered by the occupying powers. Cataloged pieces are still occasionally recovered elsewhere and returned to Poland.

Priceless pieces of art still considered missing or found in Russian museums include works by [[Bernardo Bellotto|Canaletto]], [[Anna Bilińska-Bohdanowicz]]owa, [[Józef Brandt]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], [[Lucas Cranach the Younger]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Anthony van Dyck]], [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], [[Jacob Jordaens]], [[Frans Luycx]], [[Jacek Malczewski]], [[Raphael]], [[Rembrandt van Rijn]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Henryk Siemiradzki]], [[Veit Stoss]], [[Alfred Wierusz-Kowalski]], [[Leon Wyczółkowski]], [[Jan Matejko]], [[Henri Gervex]], [[Ludwig Buchhorn]], [[Józef Simmler]], [[Henri-Pierre Danloux]], [[Jan Miense Molenaer]] and many others.&lt;ref name="sural"&gt;{{cite journal | author =Agnieszka Sural | year =2013 | month = | title =Najcenniejsze dzieła zaginione podczas II wojny światowej |trans-title=The most precious pieces of art missing since WWII | journal =culture.pl | volume = | issue =2013-08-13 | pages = | issn = | url =http://www.culture.pl/baza-sztuki-pelna-tresc/-/eo_event_asset_publisher/eAN5/content/najcenniejsze-dziela-zaginione-podczas-ii-wojny-swiatowej# | publisher=[[Adam Mickiewicz Institute]] | location=Warsaw | accessdate =2013-08-22 |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the efforts to locate and retrieve the missing pieces of art, the [[Ministry of Culture and National Heritage (Poland)|Ministry of Culture and National Heritage]] founded the Database of War Losses, as of 2013 containing over 63,000 entries.&lt;ref name="muzeum-o"&gt;{{cite web | author=Muzeum Utracone (corporate author) | title=About The Lost Museum | publisher=Muzeum Utracone | year=2013 | work= muzeumutracone.pl| url=http://muzeumutracone.pl/o-muzeum/ | accessdate=2013-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The list is periodically sent to over 100 auction houses around the world, published by the Ministry and also submitted to the National Institute of Museology and Collections Protection, Polish embassies, and the Central Registry of Information on Looted Cultural Property 1933-1945 (lootedart.com).&lt;ref name="muzeum-o"/&gt; In addition, the Ministry also founded the Lost Museum website, a virtual museum containing historic photographs of many pieces of art still missing.&lt;ref name="muzeum-o"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gp/&gt;

==Background==
At the beginning of the [[1939 invasion of Poland]], the Polish interwar government attempted to conceal the nation's most valued cultural heritage such as the royal treasures of the [[Wawel Castle]] in [[Kraków]]. The royal accessories including the [[Jagiellonian tapestries]] were secretly shipped to Western Europe and then to Canada among other places. At the end of the war, two parallel Polish governments, the Western-supported [[Polish government-in-exile]] and the Soviet-backed government in [[Communist Poland]] laid claims to these national treasures. The cultural artifacts were released by Canada to the [[People's Republic of Poland]] in February 1961.&lt;ref name="university"/&gt;&lt;ref name="treasures"/&gt;

==Nazi Germany==
Following the [[German invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 and the [[occupation of Poland]] by German forces, the Nazi regime attempted to [[Polish culture during World War II|suppress Polish culture]].&lt;ref name="JOG_quote"/&gt; As part of that process, the Nazis confiscated Polish national heritage assets and much private property.&lt;ref name="Knuth2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Madajczyk122"/&gt; Acting on the legal decrees of October 19 and December 16 (''Verordnung über die Beschlagnahme Kunstgegeständen im Generalgouvernement''), several German agencies began the process of looting Polish museums and other collections, ostensibly considered necessary for the "securing" of German national interests.&lt;ref name=jasinski/&gt;

Thousands of art objects were plundered, as the Nazis carried out a plan put in place before the start of hostilities.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; The looting was supervised by experts of the ''[[SS]]''-''[[Ahnenerbe]]'', ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' units, who were responsible for art; and, by experts of ''[[Haupttreuhandstelle Ost]]'', who were responsible for confiscating businesses and more mundane objects.&lt;ref name=Madajczyk122/&gt; Nazi officials responsible for carrying-out the plan included [[Hans Posse]], [[Josef Mühlmann]] and his half-brother [[Kajetan Mühlmann|Kajetan]] (a.k.a. Kai, both from the [[SS]]),&lt;ref name=jasinski/&gt;&lt;ref name="miastospoleczne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://miastospoleczne.pl/web/uploads/docs/2c834dc21a2f465b4e247e85ad18e19de4332fc2.pdf |title=Warszawa Oskarża |publisher=Drukarnia Narodowa, M-01526 |work=Przewodnik po wystawie urządzonej przez Biuro Odbudowy Stolicy wespół z Muzeum Narodowym w Warszawie |accessdate=August 4, 2012 |author1=Ministerstwo Kultury i Sztuki |author2=i Ministerstwo Odbudowy Kraju |language=Polish |format=PDF direct download, 91.8 KB |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715001132/http://miastospoleczne.pl/web/uploads/docs/2c834dc21a2f465b4e247e85ad18e19de4332fc2.pdf |archivedate=July 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zab"/&gt; overseen by [[Dagobert Frey]], an SS historian originally also from Austria, selected by Berlin to validate Poland as a "Teutonic land" without Jews.&lt;ref name="dictionaryofarthistorians"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/freyd.htm | title=Frey, Dagobert | publisher=Dictionary of Art Historians | accessdate=August 4, 2012 | author=Department of Art, Art History, and Visual Studies of Duke University}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the official looting by Nazi authorities, some looting was also carried out by individuals acting on their own initiative; in fact Mühlmann complained as early as on October 6, 1939, that many items he was tasked to secure had already been moved or simply stolen.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt;&lt;ref name=zab/&gt; While the Nazis kept extensive documentation of newly acquired looted art pieces, the system was not foolproof, and they lost track of much of the looted goods during the increasingly haphazard evacuation of Polish territories in 1944.&lt;ref name=zab/&gt;

Most of the important art pieces had been "secured" by the Nazis within six months of September 1939; by the end of 1942, German officials estimated that "over 90%" of the art previously in Poland was in their possession.&lt;ref name=Madajczyk122/&gt; Some art was shipped to German museums, such as the planned ''[[Führermuseum]]'' in [[Linz]], while other art became the private property of Nazi officials.&lt;ref name=Madajczyk122/&gt; In 1940, Hitler received a "gift" from [[Hans Frank]], governor of [[General Government|occupied Poland]] - a collection, prepared by Mühlmann, of 521 of the most valuable art pieces.&lt;ref name=zab/&gt; Frank aided by ''Oberführer'' Mühlmann, an art connoisseur, amassed a large collection of Polish art pieces.&lt;ref name=zab/&gt; The total cost of the Nazi theft and destruction of Polish art is estimated at 11.14 billion dollars (value in 2001 dollars).&lt;ref name="Matelski2005-160"/&gt;

Over 516,000 individual art pieces were taken.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; The exact number is uncertain as not all art was registered, and much of that documentation was lost as well.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt;&lt;ref name=zab/&gt; Assessment of losses began during World War II under the auspices of the [[Polish government in exile]] and the [[Polish Underground State]]; in 1944, [[Karol Estreicher (junior)|Karol Estreicher]] published in London the first work on this subject, ''Cultural Losses of Poland''.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; A 2010 estimate gave a figure of 75% for the percentage of cultural heritage lost by Poland during the war&lt;ref name="gp"/&gt; (though that estimate covers both destroyed and lost cultural heritage).&lt;ref name="jasinski"/&gt; The looted art included 11,000 paintings by Polish painters; 2,800 paintings by other European painters; 1,400 sculptures; 75,000 manuscripts; 25,000 maps, 22,000 books printed before 1800 (''starodruki''); 300,000 graphics, and hundreds of thousands of other items of artistic and historical value.&lt;ref name="Matelski2005-160"/&gt; The number of looted or destroyed books is estimated at 1.5 million&lt;ref name="Matelski2005-160"/&gt; to as high as 15&lt;ref name=jasinski/&gt; or 22 million.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; Even exotic animals were taken from the [[zoo]]s.&lt;ref name="Kisling2000"/&gt;

During the genocidal campaign against the [[Polish Jews]] culminating in the ''[[Aktion Reinhard]]'' of 1942, extortion and mass looting became part of German economics, not only Nazi policy towards Poland's heritage.&lt;ref name="arc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?hl=en-CA&amp;q=cache:_OoZLk7G3wAJ:http://www.deathcamps.org/reinhard/areconomics.html%2Bwww.death-camps.org/reinhard/areconomics&amp;gbv=2&amp;&amp;ct=clnk |title=Aktion Reinhard Economics |publisher=Aktion Reinhard |work=Google's cache |year=2006 |accessdate=30 July 2014 |author=ARC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{quote|Robbery of Polish Jews and looting of their property became the norm. In every town and village, Jews were forced to hand over not merely gold, currency and other valuables, but virtually anything consumable, including furniture and clothing. Even items such as birdcages, door handles and hot-water bottles were looted. Any excuse, or none at all, became the pretext for extortion.&lt;ref name="arc"/&gt;}}

==Soviet Union==
[[File:Пл. Ринок, 4.JPG|thumb|upright|Holdings of ''Lwów Historical Museum'' were taken to the basement of Black House and smashed behind closed doors.&lt;ref name="nimoz-2000"/&gt;]]
After the [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet Union invaded Poland]] on September 17, 1939, it similarly engaged in the looting and destruction of the Polish cultural heritage.&lt;ref name=jasinski/&gt;&lt;ref name="nimoz"/&gt; It is estimated that soon after the invasion, about half of Polish museums and similar public institutions were dismantled in the territories occupied by the Soviets. Many items were shipped to Soviet museums such as the [[Moscow Museum of History]] and the [[Central Anti-Religious Museum]] (also in Moscow).&lt;ref name=jasinski/&gt; Other collections were simply done away with. For instance, during the liquidation of the Poland's ''Lwów Historical Museum'' in the early 1940, its holdings were transported to the basement of the Black (''Czarna'') [[Kamienica (architecture)|Kamienica]] ''(pictured)'', away from public eye, and deliberately destroyed there.&lt;ref name="nimoz-2000"/&gt;

Following the Soviet advance across the German-occupied Polish lands, the looting and plunder of anything of value continued&lt;ref name=jasinski/&gt;  up to 1947 even though the looted territories were theoretically assigned to its own ally, the [[Polish People's Republic|communist Poland]] already.&lt;ref name="jasinski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davies2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Raack" /&gt; The Soviet forces engaged in particularly extensive plunder in the [[former eastern territories of Germany]] that were to be transferred to Poland, stripping them of any piece of equipment left behind.&lt;ref name="jasinski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MSZ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IPN-MM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IPN-Ś" /&gt; Even the [[History of Poland (1945–1989)#Stalinist era (1948–1956)|Polish Communists]] felt uneasy about the scope of their crimes. In 1945, the future Chairman of the [[Polish Council of State]], Gen. [[Aleksander Zawadzki]], worried that "raping and looting of the Soviet army would provoke a civil war"&lt;ref name="Davies" /&gt;

{{see also|Rape during the liberation of Poland|Soviet war crimes}}

The operations of these "war trophy brigades" were regulated by detailed orders issued by Soviet vice-minister of defence [[Nikolai Bulganin]] in early 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ВОЕННАЯ ЛИТЕРАТУРА --[ Первоисточники ]-- Приказы народного комиссара обороны СССР (1943-1945)|url = http://militera.lib.ru/docs/da/nko_1943-1945/14.html|website = militera.lib.ru|accessdate = 2015-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1948 these brigades sent at least 239'000 [[Railroad car|freight cars]] to USSR transporting natural resources, complete factories and individual machines. Town of [[Bydgoszcz]] lost 30 complete factories and 250 ships, from [[Grudziądz]] the army confiscated all machinery from factories, regardless of their size. From [[Toruń]] all [[gristmill]]s were taken, causing temporary deficit of bread. Blachownia Śląska lost a large, German-built [[synthetic fuel]] producing installation, transported to USSR on 10,000 train cars. A similar production line in [[Police, West Pomeranian Voivodeship|Police]] was transported using 14,000 cars. [[Gliwice]] lost a pipe factory, [[Bobrek, Cieszyn|Bobrek]] and Łabędy - iron furnaces. Complete power stations were taken from Miechowice, [[Zabrze]], [[Zdzieszowice]], Mikulczyce, Blachownia Śląska i Chełmsk Śląski. Smaller industries were also confiscated in [[Sosnowiec]], [[Dąbrowa Górnicza]], [[Częstochowa]], Zgoda, [[Chorzów]], [[Siemianowice Śląskie|Siemianowice]], [[Poznań]], [[Bydgoszcz]], [[Grudziądz]], [[Toruń]], [[Inowrocław]], [[Włocławek]], [[Chojnice]], [[Łódź]], Dziedzice and [[Oświęcim]].

Farming animals were also significant target of looting: until 1 September 1945 the [[Red Army]] confiscated 506,000 cows, 114,000 sheep and 206,000 horses. In February 1945 alone over 72,000 tons of sugar was taken. In Toruń region alone 14,000 tons of grain, 20,000 of potatoes and 21,000 beetroots were taken during that period. These number represent looting alone, as the Polish government also supplied food to the Red Army officially at that time (150,000 tons of grains, 250,000 tons of potatoes, 25,000 tons of meat and 100,000 tons of straws).

Individual Red Army soldiers were also allowed to send home "war trophies", with the weight depending on their rank, which resulted in widespread looting of private houses of anything valuable, including food, clothes, shoes, radios, jewelry, utensils, clothes, bicycles, and even ceramic toilet bowls. Scale of individual looting can be estimated by the example of Russian town of [[Kursk]], which received only 300 personal parcels from soldiers in January 1945 but till May their number reached 87,000.

After these transports were finished, the Red Army also started looting the train infrastructure itself—repair yards, signalling installations and the rails themselves: around 5,500&amp;nbsp;km of rails were looted.

In 1946 the scale of looting was estimated by Polish authorities at 2.375 billions of 1938 dollars (equivalent of $54 billion in 2015 dollars).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ŁUPY WOJENNE|url = http://www.polska-zbrojna.pl/home/articleinmagazineshow/13006?t=LUPY-WOJENNE|website = www.polska-zbrojna.pl|accessdate = 2015-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Największy rabunek w dziejach Pomorza i Kujaw - Express Bydgoski - Bydgoszcz, Kujawy i Pomorze - aktualności, informacje, artykuły, wydarzenia.|url = http://express.bydgoski.pl/990,Najwiekszy-rabunek-w-dziejach-Pomorza-i-Kujaw.html|website = express.bydgoski.pl|accessdate = 2015-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Znienawidzona Armia Czerwona w Łodzi - Dzienniklodzki.pl|url = http://www.dzienniklodzki.pl/artykul/516739,znienawidzona-armia-czerwona-w-lodzi,id,t.html?cookie=1#!|website = www.dzienniklodzki.pl|accessdate = 2015-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rosja jest nam winna 54 miliardy dolarów.

==Efforts to locate and reclaim the lost art==
After the war, the Polish [[Ministry of Culture and National Heritage (Poland)|Ministry of Culture and Art]] took over efforts to compile a list of lost art, locate it and recover it.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; The Bureau of Revindication and Damages (''Biuro Rewindykacji i Odszkodowań'') operated from 1945 to 1951.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; The realities of the [[Cold War]] made retrieval of looted cultural heritage difficult, and it was only in the 1980s and 1990s that the situation changed.&lt;ref name="MSZ2"/&gt; In 1991, a new body was formed for that purpose, the Bureau of the Government Representative for Polish Cultural Heritage Abroad (''Biuro Pełnomocnika Rządu ds. Polskiego Dziedzictwa Kulturalnego Za Granicą''), operating at the Ministry of Culture and Art.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; In 1999, the initiative received support from the Polish [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Poland)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]].&lt;ref name="MSZ3"/&gt; Once a looted piece of art is located, the Polish government issues a request for its restoration, and as noted on the Ministry website, all requests to date have been successful.&lt;ref name=MSZ3/&gt; {{As of|October 2012}}, the Ministry listed 30 objects which had been retrieved in the years 2001-2012.&lt;ref name="MSZ4"/&gt; Among the recovered art is the [[Aleksander Gierymski]]'s ''Jewish Woman''—found by surprise at the ''Eva Aldag'' auction house in [[Buxtehude]] in November 2010, returned to [[National Museum, Warsaw]] at the end of July 2011 and restored.&lt;ref name="gierymski"/&gt;

[[File:Raphael missing.jpg|thumb|[[Raphael]]'s ''[[Portrait of a Young Man (Raphael)|Portrait of a Young Man]]'' reported hidden in a secret bank vault]]
On 1 August 2012, the [[Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] announced that one of the most famous pieces of Polish art, [[Raphael]]'s painting ''[[Portrait of a Young Man (Raphael)|Portrait of a Young Man]]'', had been found "in a bank vault in an undisclosed location"; a ministry spokesman was confident that the painting would eventually be returned to Poland.&lt;ref name="panarmenian"/&gt; In April 2014, [[Francesco Guardi]]'s ''Palace Stairs'' was recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/45012/germany-returns-stolen-polish-art-from-1939/|title=Germany Returns Stolen Polish Art from 1939|last=Fry|first=Maddy|date=2014-04-01|website=Time.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, Poland is planning to build a [[virtual museum]], the [[Lost Museum]] ({{Interlanguage link multi|Muzeum Utracone|pl}}), which would feature the lost art.&lt;ref name=gp/&gt;

Both Germany and the [[post-Soviet states|countries of the former Soviet Union]] still have much Polish material looted during World War II.&lt;ref name="GW2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rękopis Słowackiego odnaleziony w Rosji"/&gt;&lt;ref name="onet"/&gt; In particular, recovering looted art from the former states of the Soviet Union, such as Russia, is proving difficult.&lt;ref name="wprost"/&gt;&lt;ref name="przeglad-tygodnik"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2002/spring/spoils-of-war-1.html | title=Spoils of War Returned: U.S. Restitution of Nazi-Looted Cultural Treasures to the USSR, 1945 - 1959, Part 1 | author=[[Patricia Kennedy Grimsted]] | journal=[[Prologue (magazine)|Prologue]] | year=Fall 2002 | volume=34 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
