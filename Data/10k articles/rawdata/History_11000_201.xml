{{Martinism}}
'''Augustin Chaboseau''' (17 June 1868 – 2 January 1946) is the original organizer and [[promulgation]] officer of the [[Traditional Martinist Order]] (TMO), [[Occultist]] and [[Historian]].

Notably, his founding was in partnership with Papus in 1888. In his early years, he had the necessary talents, skills and abilities that led him to become a [[medical doctor]] and it was with the knowledge gained from working with the responsibility of saving people's lives that he was able to successful transition into his work with the TMO.

He has contributed to numerous journals and is the author of an essay on [[Buddhist philosophy]] (1891) and a [[History of Brittany]] before the thirteenth century (1926), World War I interior ministry.

'''Biopunk''' (a [[portmanteau]] of "[[biotechnology]]" or "[[biology]]" and "[[punk subculture|punk]]") is a [[subgenre]] of [[science fiction]] that focuses on biotechnology. It is derived from [[cyberpunk]], but focuses on the implications of biotechnology rather than [[information technology]].&lt;ref name="Quinion 1997"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Quinion, Michael| title = World Wide Words: Biopunk| year = 1997 | url = http://www.worldwidewords.org/turnsofphrase/tp-bio3.htm| accessdate=2007-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biopunk is concerned with [[synthetic biology]]. It is derived of cyberpunk involving [[Do-it-yourself biology|bio-hackers]], biotech [[mega-corporation]]s, and oppressive government agencies that [[Genetic engineering in science fiction|manipulate]] [[human DNA]]. Most often keeping with the dark atmosphere of cyberpunk, biopunk generally examines the dark side of [[genetic engineering]] and represents the low side of [[biotechnology]]. 
==Description==
[[Image:Ribofunk cover.gif|thumb|right|175px|Cover of ''Ribofunk'' by [[Paul Di Filippo]], a seminal biopunk story collection.]]

Biopunk is a subgenre of science fiction closely related to cyberpunk that focuses on the near-future (most often [[unintended consequences|unintended) consequences]] of the [[biotechnology revolution]] following the discovery of [[recombinant DNA]]. Biopunk stories explore the struggles of individuals or groups, often the product of [[human subject research|human experimentation]], against a typically [[dystopian]] backdrop of [[totalitarian]] governments and megacorporations which misuse biotechnologies as means of social control and [[profiteering (business)|profiteering]]. Unlike cyberpunk, it builds not on [[information technology]], but on [[synthetic biology]]. Like in [[postcyberpunk]] fiction, individuals are usually [[body modification|modified]] and [[human enhancement|enhanced]] not with [[cyberware]], but by [[human genetic engineering|genetic manipulation]].&lt;ref name="Quinion 1997"/&gt; A common feature of biopunk fiction is the "black clinic", which is a laboratory, clinic, or hospital that performs illegal, unregulated, or ethically-dubious biological modification and [[genetic engineering]] procedures.&lt;ref name="Pulver 1998"&gt;{{cite book| author = Pulver, David L. | title = GURPS Bio-Tech| publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]] | year=1998 | isbn=978-1-55634-336-0| authorlink= David L. Pulver| title-link = GURPS Bio-Tech}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many features of biopunk fiction have their roots in [[William Gibson]]'s ''[[Neuromancer]]'', one of the first cyberpunk novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journal.media-culture.org.au/0006/biopunk.php|title=Fleshing Out the Maelstrom: Biopunk and the Violence of Information|author=Paul Taylor|publisher=Journal of Media and Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the prominent writers in this field is [[Paul Di Filippo]], though he called his collection of such stories '''ribofunk''', a blend of "[[ribosome]]" and "[[funk]]".&lt;ref name="Fisher 1996"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Fisher, Jeffrey| title = Ribofunk| journal = Wired| year = 1996 | url = https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.11/ribopunk_pr.html| accessdate=2007-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''RIBOFUNK: The Manifesto'',&lt;ref name="Di Filippo 1998"&gt;{{cite paper| author = Di Filippo, Paul | title =  RIBOFUNK: The Manifesto | year = 1998 | url = http://www.streettech.com/bcp/BCPtext/Manifestos/Ribofunk.html | accessdate=2011-01-05 | authorlink = Paul Di Filippo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Di Filippo wrote:

{{quotation|Why Ribo?&lt;br/&gt;Cybernetics was a dead science when cyberpunk SF was born, a cul-de-sac without living practitioners. Furthermore, the "cyber" prefix has been irreparably debased by overuse, in vehicles ranging from comic books to bad movies. The tag now stands for nothing in the public mind but computer hacking and fanciful cyborgs such as Robocop. And Weiner's actual texts do not provide enough fruitful metaphors for constructing a systematic worldview.&lt;br/&gt;Why Funk?&lt;br/&gt;Punk was a dead music when cyberpunk SF was born, a cul-de-sac albeit with living practitioners who just hadn't gotten the message yet. The music's nihilistic, chiliastic worldview had already culminated in its only possible end: self-extinction.&lt;br/&gt;What is Ribofunk then?&lt;br/&gt;Ribofunk is speculative fiction which acknowledges, is informed by and illustrates the tenet that the next revolution--the only one that really matters--will be in the field of biology. To paraphrase Pope, ribofunk holds that: "The proper study of mankind is life." Forget physics and chemistry; they are only tools to probe living matter. Computers? Merely simulators and modelers for life. The cell is King!&lt;ref name="Di Filippo 1998"/&gt;}}

Di Filippo suggests that precursors of biopunk fiction include [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The Island of Doctor Moreau]]''; [[Julian Huxley]]'s ''[[The Tissue-Culture King]]''; some of [[David H. Keller]]'s stories, [[Damon Knight]]'s ''Natural State and Other Stories''; [[Frederik Pohl]] and [[Cyril M. Kornbluth]]'s ''[[The Space Merchants|Gravy Planet]]''; novels of [[T. J. Bass]] and [[John Varley (author)|John Varley]]; [[Greg Bear]]'s ''[[Blood Music (novel)|Blood Music]]'' and [[Bruce Sterling]]'s ''[[Schismatrix]]''.&lt;ref name="Di Filippo 1998"/&gt; The stories of [[Cordwainer Smith]], including his first and most famous "[[Scanners Live in Vain]]", also foreshadow biopunk themes.&lt;ref&gt;Gary K. Wolfe and Carol T. Williams, “The Majesty of Kindness: The Dialectic of Cordwainer Smith”, Voices for the Future: Essays on Major Science Fiction Writers, Volume 3, Thomas D.

'''''Buhez Sante Barba''''' ("The Life of Saint Barbara") is a [[mystery play]] in [[Middle Breton]] verse on the life and miracles of the martyr saint [[Saint Barbara|Barbara]], daughter of King Dioscurus of [[Nicomedia]]. It first appeared in print in 1557.

==Synopsis==
Barbara, who has secretly embraced the Christian faith, is carefully guarded by her pagan father, who keeps her shut up in a tower in order to preserve her from the outside world. Barbara convinces the builders of her prison to put in three rather than two windows. When her father finally learns that the three windows are intended to symbolise the Holy Trinity, he realises that Barbara has denounced the old gods and converted to Christianity. Dioscurus is furious and decides to kill her, but God transports her to the mountains, where she meets two shepherds, Gueguen and Rivallen. When her father comes looking for her, Rivallen, though initially known as a villain, claims not to have seen her. The 'good shepherd', however, Gueguen, betrays her and is miraculously transformed into a rock. Dioscurus sends her to his torturers, who do not shrink back from employing a variety of techniques to inflict pain and suffering, including the use of fire, knives and hammers. The blow of mercy comes when Barbara is beheaded by her own father.

'''Carl Fremont Brand''' (October 8, 1892 – March 27, 1981) was an American historian. He was a professor of history at [[Stanford University]] for thirty-four years, and was one of the leading American authorities on the history of the [[British Labour Party]].&lt;ref&gt;"Carl Brand, Stanford Professor; Authority on British Labor Party," ''New York Times'', March 27, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;  His books, ''British Labour's Rise to Power'' (1941) and ''The British Labour Party'' (1964), are regarded as definitive works in this field.&lt;ref name="Mem"&gt;Department of History, Stanford University, "Memorial Resolution," 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;  He built the [[Hoover Institution]]'s collection of Labour Party documents, long recognized as the finest collection outside of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Brand was born in [[Greenfield, Indiana]]. He was the only child of Charles Samuel Brand, a glass worker, and Jessie Fremont Davis, a homemaker, musician and artist, whose name reflected her family's admiration of General [[John C. Fremont]] and his wife, Jessie. The first member of his family to go to college, Carl received a degree from [[Indiana University]] in 1915, where he was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. Although he majored in history, he was a teaching assistant in music during his senior year.&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue, Indiana University, 1915, p. 24. Available in Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  He served as director of the [[Marching Hundred]], the famous [[Big Ten]] marching band, in which he played the [[clarinet]]. In 1914 he became Chief Musician, with the rank of sergeant, when the band was mustered into the [[Indiana National Guard]]. In 1916 the band, including Carl, was sent to the Mexican Border following [[Pancho Villa]]'s raid.&lt;ref&gt;Brand, Carl F. "Autobiography," unpublished manuscript, 1970's.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Brand earned a master's degree in 1916. His thesis, "The [[Know-Nothing]] Party in Indiana," was later published serially in the ''Indiana Magazine of History'' (1922), and is still cited by scholars today.&lt;ref&gt;Google Scholar.&lt;/ref&gt; After teaching high school for a year, he began to study for a Ph.D in English history at [[Harvard University]] under Professor [[C. H. McIlwain]]. He also studied with [[Frederick Jackson Turner]], Sidney B. Wayne, [[Robert Howard Lord]], and [[Harold Laski]]. After teaching at [[Smith College]] he traveled to Europe to research his dissertation, ''The Movement for Parliamentary Reform in England 1832-67'' (1923) at the [[British Museum]] and the [[London School of Economics]]. In London he met and was influenced by [[R. H. Tawney]], and [[Sidney Webb]] and [[Beatrice Webb]], as well as, once again, Harold Laski, who had returned to London after having been dismissed from Harvard for supporting the [[Boston Police Strike]].&lt;ref name="Auto"&gt;"Autobiography."&lt;/ref&gt;

For three years Brand was an instructor in English history at the [[University of Michigan]] at Ann Arbor. In 1924 he became an assistant professor at Stanford teaching English history, then an associate professor in 1930 and a professor in 1940. He retired from Stanford in 1958, after thirty-four years. He was proud that he had taught at Stanford for half of its existence.&lt;ref name="Mem" /&gt;

==Oriental rug collection==
On a month-long visit to Istanbul in 1928, Brand began what was to become a lifelong collection of [[oriental rugs]]. While exploring the bazaar, he made the fortuitous acquaintance of [[Rudolf Riefstahl]], the American pioneer in the appreciation of Turkish and Persian rugs for their artistic value. Also advised by another early American expert, [[Arthur Upham Pope]], Brand concentrated on [[Turkish carpet|Turkish]] and [[Persian carpet|Persian]], as well as [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] and [[Turkmens|Turkmen]] carpets, handmade before the use of [[aniline]] dyes. He eventually acquired a collection of many dozens at its greatest extent. Large bales purchased for relatively small amounts of money would arrive in California still redolent of the camels that had transported them in Persia and Turkey. One noteworthy [[prayer rug]] from [[Dagestan]] had a woven-in date equivalent to 1814/15 AD.  Rare embroidered [[Uzbekistan]] Susanis made by young girls for their bridal chests have appreciated greatly in value.&lt;ref name="Auto" /&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1930 Brand was married to Nan Alwida Surface, the daughter of Dr. Frank M. Surface, a director under [[Herbert Hoover]] in the Department of Commerce, and later an executive with Standard Oil of New Jersey (now part of [[ExxonMobil]]). The Brands had three sons, Charles in 1932, Robert in 1934, and Donald in 1937.&lt;ref name="Mem" /&gt;

During World War II, the family sent some 1,600 bundles of food and clothing, collected from students and friends, to Britain over six years.  Their home near the Stanford campus became known as a center of hospitality for holiday parties.  Great effort was put into the creation of a locally famous garden, noted especially for its roses.  Many years later the property was sold to the physicist [[Edward Teller]].&lt;ref name="Mem" /&gt;

Professor Brand died at Stanford University Hospital in 1981 after a brief illness.  He was 88 years old.&lt;ref name="Mem" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11211">The '''Chanyuan Treaty''' ({{zh|s=澶渊之盟|t=澶淵之盟|p=Chányuān Zhī Méng}}) in 1005 was the pivotal point in the relations between the [[Northern Song]] (960-1127) and the [[Liao dynasty|Liao Dynasties]] (916-1125). The ruling class of the Liao were a people of nomadic origin known as the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] (Qidan in Chinese) who rose in the northeast around present-day [[Heilongjiang]] Province. The [[Song dynasty]], also referred to as the [[Northern Song]], ruled virtually all of China from the late tenth century when it eliminated the last of the kingdoms in the north and the south that stood against Chinese unification.

==Liao–Song relations==
Early on from the succession of the Song dynasty from the [[Five Dynasties]] in 960, relations between the Song and Liao were cordial. The Song had more important matters on their hand, namely the taking of the remaining kingdoms in the south and one in the north to reunify the realm. With that accomplished in 979, the Song turned their eyes on the Liao. The Song destroyed the [[Northern Han]] state in 979. The Northern Han was a [[Shato|Shatuo Turk]] kingdom that considered itself the legitimate successor of the [[Later Han (Five Dynasties)|Later Han]] dynasty that fell in 950. As it was under the protection of the Liao, it engendered some friction between the two. However, what concerned the Song even more was the continued Liao possession of the strategic [[Sixteen Prefectures]], which included present-day [[Beijing]].

After the [[Northern Han]] was destroyed by the Song, the emperor decided to march on Liao holdings in the Sixteen Prefectures.  The Song forces were routed and the emperor had to retreat in ignominy.

The Song once again tried in 986, this time trying to take advantage of a boy emperor on the Liao throne. The Song advanced on the Sixteen Prefectures in three columns. However, the Liao won decisive victories on all three fronts, and diplomatic relations were soon resumed. [[Emperor Zhenzong of Song|Emperor Zhenzong]] succeeded to the Song throne in 997. Throughout the decade, relations between the two worsened. In 999, the Liao [[Emperor Shengzong of Liao|Emperor Shengzong]] commenced annual attacks against the Song. While achieving victories in each, none were noteworthy. In 1004, this changed completely.

==Liao invasion==
Emperor Shengzong decided to launch an imperial expedition against the Song personally in the summer of 1004.  He took Khitan cavalry and encamped about one hundred miles (160 kilometers) north of the Song capital of [[Kaifeng]]. Reluctantly, Emperor Zhenzong marched northward to meet the Liao at [[Chanyuan]]. He to decided upon [[Chanyuan]] because it was the first large city across from the Yellow River. The emperor believed that crossing the Yellow River by an imperial expedition would have large symbolic and psychological value. The Song begun to worry that the expedition was not safe for the emperor because the Kitans were making serious advances in Hebei Circuit. To make it more safe K'ou Chun, the lead planner of the expedition, implemented defensive measures such as digging trenches.  [[Chanyuan]] defense was weakened after heavy fighting, results of as many as the thousands of casualties, including many generals. However, upon the arriving of the emperor, morale was raised amongst Song troops, making the battle ever lasting famous.

A Song giant crossbow killed the Liao Khitan leader Xiao Dalin in battle in January 1005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright |first=David Curtis |editor-last=Ferris |editor-first=John |date=2008 |title=NOMADIC POWER, SEDENTARY SECURITY, AND THE CROSSBOW |url=http://cpmss.synergiesprairies.ca/cpmss/index.php/cpmss/article/download/37/29 |journal=Calgary Papers in Military and Strategic Studies |volume=2 |issue= |series=Military Studies and History |publisher=Centre for Military and Strategic Studies |pages=83, 86 |isbn=978-0-88953-324-0 |doi= |access-date= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141001032037/http://cpmss.synergiesprairies.ca/cpmss/index.php/cpmss/article/download/37/29 |archivedate=2014-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to major depression and despair among the Khitan and crippled the impetus of the Khitan offensive.&lt;ref&gt;WRIGHT, DAVID C. “THE SUNG-KITAN WAR OF A.D. 1004-1005 AND THE TREATY OF SHAN-YÜAN.” Journal of Asian History, vol. 32, no. 1, 1998, pp. 20-21. https://www.jstor.org/stable/41933065?seq=18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peace negotiations===
From January 13 to January 18, 1005, the two sides worked out a peace treaty. Some sources say 1004 as it happened prior to the New Year on the Chinese [[lunar calendar]]. While the Liao initially expected a territorial concession in Kuan-nan, this demand was eventually abandoned. The specific terms of the treaty include: (1) The Song will give the Liao an annual tribute of 200,000 bolts of raw silk and 100,000 taels of silver (2) The State Finance Commission shall deliver these tributes to Hsiung-chou (3) Civilians and the military will abide by the present territorial boundaries (4) If there are robbers or bandits that flee arrest neither side shall give them refuge (5) Neither the north nor the south shall grant licenses to sow or reap furrowed fields (6) All moats and walls already in existence can be kept up but no new ones can be established (7) Neither side shall make requests outside of this treaty.

Though not specifically stated in the treaty, the two imperial families used familiar terms with one another, with the Khitan Liao holding the status of being elder, which was of great symbolic importance in Chinese culture and somewhat humiliating to the Chinese.  However, opposition to this treaty among the Song was considerable, as it was believed by some that the Khitan were overexposed.  However, peace was the prevailing sentiment, and this treaty avoided any further major wars between the two.

==Wang Jizhong==
Wang a native Kaifeng, was captured by the Kitans in 1003 at the battle of Wang-Tu. The Kitan emperor awarded Wang with official rank in the Kitan bureaucracy. Wang made the best of his circumstances and spoke with the Kitans of the advantage of resolving their conflict with the Sung peacefully. The dowager empress Ch'eng-t'ien, who was in actual control of the Kitan state at the time, had grown tired of war, and she listened to Wang's proposals. With the Liao empress dowager’s approval, Wang submitted a memorial to the Sung emperor through the Sung prefect of Mochou, stating that the Liao court wished to restore friendly relations. So, Wang facilitated the first talks of peace between the two empires. He had inside information for both of the empires so he knew exactly what each of them wanted in return for peace so he proposed exactly that to both sides. In the end it was Wang who persuaded the empress to give up on her land claims which ultimately lead to the treaty of Shan-Yuan.

==Significance of the treaty==
The signing of the Chanyuan Treaty was the first time that the Liao forced the Song, who considered themselves the natural heirs to the Central Kingdom (Zhong Yuan), to recognize them as peers. This relationship lasted until 1125, when the Song broke the treaty by inviting the [[Jurchens]] (later known as [[Manchus]]) to attack the Liao. The Jurchen attack in fact brought an end to both the Liao and the Northern Song relationship.

This treaty immediately reduced the strain on Liao finances. Politically speaking, these annual payments were used to facilitate the construction of Liao’s central capital. Peace with the Song allowed the Liao to focus more on their internal affairs and its relations with other people. So, this capital ultimately allowed the Liao to establish an international trade network. Without these annual payments from the Song it would have been highly unlikely that the Liao would have been able to create such a trading network and become the international force that they did. Economically, these payments secured the Liao a steady source of income and even helped facilitate trade with its neighbors because it now had more resources to produce goods in which they specialized in. More importantly, this treaty led to the growth of international trade along the Liao-Song border.

This treaty allowed the Song to secure disputed territory in exchange for a very minimal yearly payment. In addition now that the war was over the Song were able to focus on other matters. For one, they were able to advance their foreign diplomacy. On a different note, the Song were able to stop their military spending which was putting a serious strain on their economy. In the grand scheme of things, the yearly payments were a far less burden than the Song's military spending against the Liao.

==After the Treaty==
This treaty became the basis for relations between the Song and other [[Inner Asia]]n states including [[Western Xia]] and the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]]. Xi Xia incursions in the northwest (at the urging of the Liao) forced the Song to raise their payments to 300,000 bolts of silk and 200,000 ounces of silver.

Along the way there were incidents that jeopardized the peace between the Liao and Sung. Basically, in 1042 the Khitans threatened to launch a military expedition against the Northern Hotung circuit in order to get the Sung to increase their annual tributes to the Khitans. Then in 1076 the Sung ceded the Liao a few parcels of land along the Ho-Tung border. This inevitably created a predicament because the original guidelines of the treaty made sure that the Sung did not cede any territory to the Liao.

The accounts of the treaty in the Liao records and the Song records does not tally with each faction. The altering of some details shows a great deal of political boundary maintenance and an attempt at keeping dignity bias, which is prevalent in the Song dynasty faction. After the treaty was signed, the nature of the relationship between these two states changed from one of purely political rivalry to a supposed fraternal relationship. For the first time in Chinese history there were two Sons of Heaven, recognized by each other.

==Founding==
Policy was a passion for Allan Nevins, and that inspired him to form the Center for Oral History Research, or more specifically the Columbia University Oral History Research Office. Public policy often has an overload of written information and interview would be helpful in directing research.&lt;ref name="American Historical Society"/&gt; Nevis requested funding from Columbia University but barely received any—just enough to pay a few employees. The phrase he received from the University was "You'll never receive any operational funding from Columbia" which proved to be false. The center has had 4 directors including Nevins, including, Ronald J. Grele, and Mary Marshall Clark who is the current director as of June 2001. It wasn't until Clark's time as director that the center gained enough funding to be able to complete extensive projects and partnered with INCITE.&lt;ref name="Mary Marshall Clark Interview"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coe|first1=Natalie|last2=Furl|first2=Jennifer|title=Mary Marshall Clark, Director, Columbia University Oral History Research Office: The Oral History of 9/11|url=http://philanthropynewsdigest.org/newsmakers/mary-marshall-clark-director-columbia-university-oral-history-research-office-the-oral-history-of-9-11|website=Philanthropy News Digest|publisher=Foundation Center|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
Columbia Center for Oral History (CCOH) is made up of two complimentary centers, the [http://www.ccohr.incite.columbia.edu/ Columbia Center for Oral History Research] (CCOHR) and the Columbia Center for Oral History Archives (CCOHA). The archives are housed within Butler Library while the research center is part of [http://www.incite.columbia.edu/ Interdisciplinary Center for Innovative Theory and Empirics] (INCITE). The research center seeks funding for projects (mentioned in ). The results of these projects are sent to the archives to be stored and used as source material for future research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbia Center for Oral History Research|url=http://incite.columbia.edu/ccohr/|website=Interdisciplinary Center for Innovative Theory and Empirics|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creating another source of reliable information like this was a goal of founder Allan Nevins.&lt;ref name="Mary Marshall Clark Interview"/&gt;

==Projects==
Projects put together by the CCOHR are stored in their [[archives]] and consist of as much information as can be found on the subject. Some notable examples are below.

===Completed Projects===

====Apollo Theater Oral History Project====
This project compiled about 70 hours of narrative discussing the [[Apollo Theater]] through the lens of African-American history, the history of music and performance, and the history of New York City.  The primary interviewers are [[Brent Hayes Edwards]] and Steve Rowland who were assisted by Gustavo Azendha, Karald Kisiedu, and Jennella Young. The funding for this project was provided by the Apollo Theater Foundation who receive their support from Edward and Leslye Phillips Family Foundation, [[Rockefeller Foundation]], and [[New York Community Trust]].&lt;ref name="Apollo Theater Oral History Project"&gt;{{cite web|title=Apollo Theater Oral History Project|url=http://library.columbia.edu/locations/ccoh/new_projects/apollo_theatre.html|website=Oral History Archives|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=6 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208233524/http://library.columbia.edu/locations/ccoh/new_projects/apollo_theatre.html|archive-date=2014-12-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Carnegie Corporation Oral History Project====
Most recently running from October 2011 to September 2013, the oral history project focusing on the [[Carnegie Corporation]] has been a lasting effort. The first of three projects began in 1966 and ran until 1974 compiling 479 hours of interviews which translates into 9948 pages of transcript. The second phase beginning in 1996 gathered 216 hours, 52 of which are video. Most recently, the project has been studying how the organization was run under President [[Vartan Gregorian]], however, this global philanthropy organization will have most of its 100-year history documented by this project.&lt;ref name="Carnegie Corporation Oral History Project"&gt;{{cite web|title=Carnegie Corporation Oral History Project|url=http://library.columbia.edu/locations/ccoh/new_projects/carnegie_corp.html|website=Oral History Archives|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=6 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214153806/http://library.columbia.edu/locations/ccoh/new_projects/carnegie_corp.html|archive-date=2014-12-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rule of Law Oral History Project====
Beginning in 2008 the Rule of Law Oral History Project has studied how the events of 9/11 changed human and civil rights. In 2010 the project expanded and explored the treatment of prisoners in [[Guantánamo Bay]]. The project amalgamated 250+ hours of interviews. [[Atlantic Philanthropies]], who helped fund their own oral history project also gave this project necessary funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rule of Law Oral History Project|url=http://library.columbia.edu/locations/ccoh/new_projects/rule_of_law.html|website=Oral History Archives|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=8 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214152717/http://library.columbia.edu/locations/ccoh/new_projects/rule_of_law.html|archive-date=2014-12-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====September 11, 2001 Oral History Project====
Because of the massive scope, and the proximity Columbia Center for Oral History has to the attacks on the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] on [[September 11, 2001]] the oral history project that was inspired has broken into five separate sections. Overall the projects have collected 900 hours of interviews with about 600 individuals. 23 of these hours are on video and 687 are available to the public through the archives.&lt;ref name="September 11, 2001 Oral History Research Projects"&gt;{{cite web|title=September 11, 2001 Oral History Research Projects|url=http://library.columbia.edu/locations/ccoh/new_projects/9-11.html|website=Oral History Archives|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=7 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141123135108/http://library.columbia.edu/locations/ccoh/new_projects/9-11.html|archive-date=2014-11-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====The September 11, 2001 Oral History Narrative and Memory Project=====
This was the first and largest project on [[9/11]] started by Mary Marshall Clark days after the attacks. She worked with [[Columbia University]] history professor Ken Jackson by utilizing his undergraduate class as volunteer interviewers. The project focused on documenting people's reactions before mass media shaped them, as well as reaching many different communities and groups to hear their perspectives. Clark eventually partnered with [[Peter Bearman]], a sociology professor at Columbia University. At this point, still within the same year as the attacks, Columbia became willing to fund operational costs for the center and with the help of Bearman, Clark could apply for grants. Eventually, the project received funding from Rockfeller Foundation, [[National Science Foundation]], New York Times Foundation, and Columbia University. Because of Bearman's involvement, CCOH partnered with ISERP (Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy). Over the first eight weeks following the attacks, 200 interviews were conducted, and 300 more over the next eight months were completed. 150 of the interviews were from people within 5 blocks of the towers, while 50-60 came from those who were in the towers at the time and survived. After the initial reactions, Clark and her research team focused on reaching as many different groups of people as possible. There was a focus on civil liberty violations by the FBI on immigrants from the Middle East and Muslims. When conducting interviews with Spanish speakers, there was a trend to identify and be traumatized by the sheer number of people who jumped from the towers, which was reported by the Spanish-media but not the mainstream media until much later. This project was identified as "longitudinal" because it strove to cover everyone affected by the attacks and gain the insight of as many points of view as possible. 440 interviews had been conducted in the first year and in 2002 and 2003, 202 of those interviewees had done follow-up interviews as well. In 2005 there was a second wave of interviews, but by this time, the project had already splintered and the other projects had taken off.&lt;ref name="Mary Marshall Clark Interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="September 11, 2001 Oral History Research Projects" /&gt;

=====The September 11, 2001 Response and Recovery Oral History Project=====
This project spanned from 2002 to 2005 and focused on the people in power who had to organize response teams and get the city back on track. 112 hours of interview were conducted with 68 people running government agencies who responded to the attacks, and 12 interviews were conducted with heavily traumatized people who were directly affected by the response and outreach programs the project focused on. The funding for this project came from the New York Times Foundation and the 9/11 Neediest Fund.&lt;ref name="September 11, 2001 Oral History Research Projects" /&gt;

=====The September 11, 2001 Public Health Oral History Project=====
After 9/11 there was a lot of fear of [[anthrax attacks]] and public health was a top priority, especially in terms of returning to normalcy. This project focused on the people that facilitated that movement, both in government and as part of a [[not-for-profit organization]]. 30 hours of interview with 34 people were collected over the course of 11 months from January to November 2002. The [[New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene]] was heavily involved as were Dr. David Rosner and Dr. Nancy Van Devanter of Columbia University Public Health.&lt;ref name="September 11, 2001 Oral History Research Projects" /&gt;

=====The Telling Lives Oral History Project=====
This was the first public oral history program because it was run in public schools as an after school program and worked with the Local 40 Ironworkers. The ironworkers were interviewed to talk about the incident, but this project focused on children both as a means to gain their perspective but also to help these children make sense of what happened as it pertains to them. Both the School for International Studies in Brooklyn and the Dr. Sun Yat Sen Middle School 131 participated. The original funding was provided by the New York Times Foundation and the 9/11 Neediest Fund but it wasn't until the [[ChevronTexaco|ChevronTexaco Foundation]] began to fund the project did it become a permanent initiative in 2003. Initially the International School compiled a book of their experiences, and the Chinatown located Dr. Sun Yat Sen school created a museum exhibit for the [[Museum of Chinese in the Americas]]. Once ChevronTexaco got involved, and the permanent school program was introduced, classes were required to make either a book or a documentary to be shown publicly.&lt;ref name="September 11, 2001 Oral History Research Projects" /&gt;

=====The Chinatown Documentation Project=====
This project was a collaborative project between CCOH, the Museum of Chinese in the Americas, [[The City University of New York]], 9/11 Digital Archives, and [[New York University]]'s Asian/Pacific/American Studies Program.

Conscious evolution refers to the ability of the human species to choose what the species [[Homo sapiens|''Homo sapiens'']] will become in the future, based on recent advancements in science, medicine, technology, psychology, sociology, and spirituality. Most leading thinkers in this area have focused on the conscious evolution of how we think, live, organize ourselves, work together, and address issues, rather than on [[evolution|biological evolution]]. 

The idea of conscious evolution is not a specific theory, but it has loose connections to [[Ervin László|integral theory]], [[Spiral Dynamics]], and [[noosphere]] thought.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.consciouslifestylemag.com/conscious-evolution-save-humanity-planet/|title=Eco-Futurist Creates Revolutionary 10 Point Plan To Save Humanity &amp; The Planet|date=2015-11-28|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also sometimes connected to the theory of the [[global brain]] or [[collective consciousness]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some have suggested “conscious cultural-evolution”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2005-04-01|title=Accounting’s contribution to a conscious cultural evolution: an end to sustainable development|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1045235403000236|journal=Critical Perspectives on Accounting|language=en|volume=16|issue=3|pages=185–208|doi=10.1016/S1045-2354(03)00023-6|issn=1045-2354}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a more accurate term, to reduce association with standard [[Evolution|biological evolution]], though this is not widely applied.

Conscious evolution suggests that now that humanity is conscious of its history and of how things evolve (evolutionary consciousness), and given the rapid pace of change in society and culture, humanity can (and should) choose advancement through co-operation, co-creation and sustainable practices over self-destruction through separateness, competition, and ecological devastation.

== Conscious Evolution - A Mechanism ==

At the centre of the concept of conscious evolution are the approximate definitions of the term’s constituent phenomena ('[[consciousness]]' and '[[evolution]]'). However, the term implies more than these phenomena generally encompass, not least as it is often used with strong assumptions of a collective interest/ common good.

Evolution does not exclusively act upon [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] ([[Phenotype|phenotypic]]) variation; it can also work on a cognitive level.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Daniel Dennett]] has suggested that evolution is simply a process which uses [[natural selection]] as a basic [[algorithm]] for progression.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Darwin's Dangerous Idea|last=Dennett|first=Daniel|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=1995|isbn=0-684-82471-X|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could be applied to changes in behaviours, practices, concepts, theories and ideas ([[cultural evolution]]). In these situations the mutating [[The Selfish Gene#"Replicators"|replicators]] of evolution can be considered [[Meme|memes]] (theoretical units of cultural information)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The selfish gene|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1978|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than [[Gene|genes]]. Over the last 10,000 years humanity is increasingly capable of influencing its own environment and cognitively adapting to these environmental changes through the use of evolving [[Meme|memes]]. [[Memetics|Memetic]] (cognitive) innovation (as opposed to morphological variation) has therefore become the primary driver of humanity’s [[Evolution|evolutionary success]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Humans are ‘[[Consciousness|conscious]]’, and are consciously manipulating the [[Meme|memes]] they use. Consciousness itself (in humans’ brains) can therefore be said to have agency over its own evolution, because [[Memetics|memetic]] usage influences evolutionary success. Evolution is also something humans are conscious of. Consciousness (in human brains) can therefore be simultaneously conscious of evolution (working in this case upon [[Meme|memes]]) while consciously manipulating its own [[memetics]], in order to influence its own [[evolution]]. Evolution (in the sense of its impact upon [[memetics]]) is therefore increasingly a subject of knowledge, rather than an unknown pressure operating on the world.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banathy|first=Bela H.|date=2003-01-16|title=Self-guided/conscious evolution|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/sres.506|journal=Systems Research and Behavioral Science|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=309–321|doi=10.1002/sres.506|issn=1092-7026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conscious Evolution - Writers and Thinkers ==

Conscious evolution is largely the output of several luminaries’ personal evolutionary journeys&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://integralleadershipreview.com/11697-integral-conscious-evolution/|title=8/15 – Integral Conscious Evolution - Integral Leadership Review|last=Taborga|first=Jorge|date=|website=integralleadershipreview.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The central objective is to achieve a globally sustainable future by developing the idea that humans can guide evolution, now that we are conscious of it (evolutionary consciousness)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. Owing to the broad definition of the term, numerous writers and thinkers, from a range of fields and backgrounds have contributed ideas to the concept of conscious evolution. These include; [[Erich Jantsch]], [[Teilhard de Chardin]], [[Jonas Salk]], [[Ervin Laszlo]], [[Mihaly Csikszentmihaly]], [[Bela H. Banathy]], [[Barbara Marx Hubbard]], [[Andrew Cohen (spiritual teacher)|Andrew Cohen]], [[David Bohm#Consciousness and thought|David Bohm]], [[Eric Chaisson]], [[Duane Elgin]], [[Brian Swimme]], [[Ken Wilber]], [http://integralleadershipreview.com/11697-integral-conscious-evolution/ Jorge Taborga] and others.

One of the earliest uses of the phrase 'conscious evolution' may be that of [[Mary Parker Follett]] in 1918: ''"Conscious evolution means giving less and less place to herd instinct and more to the group imperative. We are emerging from our gregarious condition and are now to enter on the rational way of living by scanning our relations to one another, instead of bluntly feeling them, and so adjusting them that unimpeded progress on this higher plane is secured''.''"'' (''The New State'', p. 91)

Human evolution, has thus far been the consequence of billions of random events and chance interactions (as opposed to a planned endeavour).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Evolving Self: A Psychology for the New Millenium|last=Csikszentmihalyi|first=M.|publisher=Harper Perennial|year=1993|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that humans have knowledge of this evolutionary process (evolutionary consciousness) it is the task of humanity to take control of these random changes, to avoid the '[[Extinction|disastrous fate]]' (extinction) that has befallen the majority of species that have ever existed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This idea that evolutionary consciousness should be used as a tool, or even an argument for self-guided evolution, is a major central theme of the concept of conscious evolution. [[Béla H. Bánáthy|Bela H. Banathy]] &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; captures this sentiment succinctly in his paper ''Self guided/conscious evolution'': ''“Our consciousness of evolution becomes a springboard for leaping into conscious evolution.”''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The issue then arises of how humanity can be expected to know how it should use its recently acquired evolutionary consciousness to select the best evolutionary path.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anatomy of Reality: Merging Intuition and Reason|last=Salk|first=J.|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1983|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonas Salk|Jonas Salks]]&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; is optimistic that humanity is capable of merging intuition with reason in order to find the path that leads to conscious evolution: ''“It now remains for human beings to decide the ultimate course of human evolution. By imagining ourselves inside the process of evolution and by imagining the process of evolution working inside our minds, we may discover how to deal with the opportunities that might influence the direction of evolutionary choices.”''&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

[[Tom Atlee|Co-intelligence]]; a form of [[group intelligence]] that incorporates group wisdom for the benefit of humanity, is a concept [[Tom Atlee]] has stressed as an essential foundation for conscious evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atlee|first=Tom|date=2008|title=Co-intelligence, Collective Intelligence, and Conscious Evolution|url=https://co-intelligence.org/AtleeInSteeleCI-Bk.doc|journal=Collective Intelligence: Creating a Prosperous World at Peace|volume=Earth Intelligence Network|pages=5-14|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Atlee|Atlee]] suggested that many of the factors of [[Tom Atlee|co-intelligence]] (wisdom, intentionality, choice, awareness) could be used as tools to enhance consciousness and improve shared circumstances. [[Eric Chaisson]] similarly identified ‘knowledge’ and ‘compassion’ as key guiding forces for the future,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life Era|last=Chaisson|first=E.|publisher=The Atlantic Monthy Press|year=1987|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating in 1987 that we must “act wisely, quite beyond intelligently, in order to achieve successful ethical evolution”.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; [[Eric Chaisson|Chaisson’s]] main emphasis, however, was on [[ethics]], which he argued was the most important focus for ensuring effective conscious evolution: ''“if our species is to survive to enjoy the future, then we must make synonymous the words ‘future’ and ‘ethical,’ thus terming our next evolutionary epoch ‘ethical evolution’”''.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Numerous aspects of both [[Tom Atlee|co-intelligence]] and [[ethics]], in our self-guided, conscious evolution are also present in the writings of [[Barbara Marx Hubbard]], one of the most widely published advocates of conscious evolution. [[Barbara Marx Hubbard|Hubbard]] has a positive opinion of humanity and the evolutionary process.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Conscious Evolution|last=Hubbard|first=B.|publisher=New World Library|year=1996|isbn=|location=Novato, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has claimed that: “Every tendency in us leads us toward greater wholeness, unity, and connectedness... Integration is inherent in the process of evolution.”&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; However, Hubbard has been criticised for focusing on the most hopeful evidence that conscious evolution is taking humanity in a positive direction.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scottlondon.com/reviews/hubbard.html|title=Conscious Evolution :: A Book Review by Scott London|last=London|first=Scott|website=www.scottlondon.com|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott London commented in a review of her 1998 book ''Conscious Evolution; Awakening the Power of Our Social Potential'', that much of the evidence provided was ''“soft data”'', ''“highly questionable”'', or ''“anecdotal”''.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Despite these criticisms [[Barbara Marx Hubbard|Hubbard]], and numerous other advocates of conscious evolution, are continuing to promote the concept, with some suggesting it be included in education and government&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

'''Debdou''' is a town in [[Morocco]]. It is known for its multi-ethnic population, including Arabs, Jews and Berbers.

The Banu Urtajjen, a Berber family related to the Moroccan dynasty of the [[Wattasids]], had their own semi-independent state here from 1430 until 1563.

==Jewish centre==

Debdou was a major Jewish centre in Morocco. The town was settled by many Sephardic Jews from [[Seville]], fleeing the wave of anti-Jewish riots in Spain in 1391. The earliest to settle were the clan of Cohen-Scali who reached Debdou in 1465, a family of Jewish priests said to trace their lineage to [[Zadok]], the High Priest.&lt;ref&gt;Shlomo bar Yosef ha-Cohen Atzvan, ''Ma'alot le'Shlomo'', Jerusalem 1985, [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21257&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=56&amp;hilite= p. 56] in PDF (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century the town was briefly renowned as a centre of Jewish learning, exporting rabbis to many cities in Morocco.

At the end of the 19th century the town's population was estimated at 2000 inhabitants, most of them Jews.

At the beginning of the 20th century the number of Jews was estimated at 1600, who formed roughly a third of the population.

Following the establishment of the French protectorate, with the concomitant rise in security, the majority of the Jewish population gradually emigrated to nearby towns in the plains.

[[Image:Ordaz.jpg|thumb|right|Captain Diego de Ordás, of the Kingdom of León]]
'''Diego de Ordaz''' also Diego de Ordás ({{IPA-es|ˈdjeɣo ðe oɾˈðaθ|lang}}; 1480 in [[Castroverde de Campos]], [[Zamora (province)|Zamora]] province, [[Spain]] &amp;ndash; 1532 in [[Venezuela]]) was a Spanish explorer and soldier.

==Early career==
Diego de Ordaz arrived in Cuba at a young age.  Serving under the orders of [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar|Diego Velázquez]], he participated in the earliest exploratory expeditions to [[Colombia]] and [[Panamá]].

==Expedition of Cortés to Mexico==
De Ordaz accompanied [[Hernán Cortés]] on his expedition of conquest to the Mexican mainland.&lt;ref name=Diaz&gt;Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0140441239}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|48,221}}  He was recognized for his contribution to the victory over the [[Aztec civilization|Aztecs]] obtained at the Battle of Centla near [[Río Grijalva]] in [[Tabasco]] on March 25, 1519.

Together with two comrades, he was the first European to climb to the top of the volcano [[Popocatépetl]] - a feat which made a great impression on the indigenous allies accompanying Cortés.  In recognition of De Ordaz's military deeds, the emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] on October 22, 1525 issued a decree permitting him to use a coat-of-arms featuring a view of the volcano.&lt;ref name="Diaz"/&gt;{{rp|182–183}} 
[[Image:Mexico-Popocatepetl.jpg|thumb|left|[[Popocatépetl]]]]

De Ordaz participated in the Spanish conquest of [[Tenochtitlán]], the [[Aztec]] capital.  When prior to the final conquest, the Spaniards were forced to flee from the capital in a nocturnal action known as [[La Noche Triste]] ("the sad night"), De Ordaz was wounded.

Following the conquest of Mexico, De Ordaz explored the areas of [[Oaxaca]] and [[Veracruz]], and navigated the [[Coatzacoalcos River|Río Coatzacoalos]].

In 1521, he was sent back to Spain in order to present the story of the conquest of Mexico to the Spanish court, and in order to obtain for Cortės the title of Governor and General Captain of [[New Spain]].

==Search for El Dorado==
De Ordaz returned to North America in approximately 1525.  In 1529, he was granted the property of El Peñón de los Baños located within the limits of [[Mexico City]].

He returned again to Spain and requested permission to explore the lands of the mythical [[El Dorado]], which was believed to lie inland in the area of what is now [[Venezuela]].  Having obtained permission, he sailed for South America, exploring up the [[Río Orinoco]].  After abandoning the search for El Dorado, he died in 1532 on the Venezuelan [[Paria Peninsula]].

==Legacy==
In 1952, a planned city called [[Puerto Ordaz]] was founded in Venezuela on the banks of the Orinoco River; today it is one of that country's principal cities.

Diego de Ordaz was one of the principal characters in the anonymous historical novel ''Jicoténcal'' published in Philadelphia in 1826 and attributed to several different writers like [[Felix Varela]], [[José María Heredia]], and [[Félix Mejía]].

'''Dominic of Evesham''' was a medieval [[prior]] of [[Evesham Abbey]] in England and historical [[chronicler]].

Little is known of his life.&lt;ref name=Writings298/&gt; He was probably a native [[Englishman]],&lt;ref name=Vita67&gt;Lapidge "Dominic of Evesham" ''Analecta Bollandiana'' pp. 67–68&lt;/ref&gt; and was probably born sometime before 1077, and was probably raised around the abbey.&lt;ref name=Writings298/&gt; He may have entered Evesham before 1077,&lt;ref name=Vita67/&gt; but certainly by 1104, he was a [[monk]] at Evesham, as his name appears in a document as a member of the abbey. Sometime before 1125 he became prior of Evesham, as he was named prior in an account of the consecration of [[Samson (Bishop of Worcester)|Samson]] as [[Bishop of Worcester]] that year. He was still prior after 1130, when he witnessed two [[charter]]s of [[Reginald Foliot]], then the [[abbot]]. By 1145 he had been succeeded by Richard as prior, and no further records mention Dominic.&lt;ref name=Writings298&gt;Jennings "Writings" ''English Historical Review'' p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

Dominic certainly wrote four works: ''Vita Sancti Egwini'', ''Vita Sancti Odulfi'', ''Acta Proborum Virorum'', and a collection of ''Miracles of the Virgin''. The ''Vita Sancti Egwini'', or ''Life of Saint Egwin'', was a history of Evesham's founder, St [[Egwin]],&lt;ref name=Writings298/&gt; and consists of two books.&lt;ref name=Vita70&gt;Lapidge "Dominic of Evesham" ''Analecta Bollandiana'' p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; This work became the standard source for Egwin's life in the later Middle Ages, replacing an earlier ''Life'' written by [[Byrhtferth]] which had been Dominic's source for his first book.&lt;ref name=Vita71&gt;Lapidge "Dominic of Evesham" ''Analecta Bollandiana'' pp. 71–74&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Vita Sancti Odulfi'' gave a hagiography of St [[Evesham Abbey#Burials of saints|Odulf]], a missionary to [[Landgraviate of Brabant|Brabant]] whose relics were enshrined at Evesham. The ''Acta Proborum Virorum'' was a miscellaneous compilation of tales and legends relating to Evesham Abbey.&lt;ref name=Writings298/&gt; The work on the Virgin's miracles is one of the earliest such works.&lt;ref name=Vita67/&gt; The source for his authoring these works is a 13th-century manuscript, which is an early collection of some of the works. However, the compiler, Thomas of Marlborough, admitted that he had altered both by omitting information and adding information.&lt;ref name=Writings299&gt;Jennings "Writings" ''English Historical Review'' pp. 299–300&lt;/ref&gt;

The monastic historian [[David Knowles (scholar)|David Knowles]] felt that the account of Abbot [[Æthelwig]]'s death that is contained in the ''[[Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham]]'' was written by Dominic, not by the main author of the chronicle, [[Thomas of Marlborough]].&lt;ref name=Monastic704&gt;Knowles ''Monastic Order in England'' p. 704–705&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible work was a ''Vita Sancti Wistani'' (or ''Life of Saint Wistan''), about St [[Wistan]], a [[Mercia]]n saint whose [[relic]]s rested at Evesham.&lt;ref name=Writings298/&gt;

The main manuscripts containing Dominic's works are Bodely MS Rawlinson A.287, Hereford Cathedral Chained Library MS P.7.vi, Balliol MS 240.&lt;ref name=Writings304&gt;Jennings "Writings" ''English Historical Review'' p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; The Dublin manuscript only has the first book, while the Hereford manuscript contains both books.&lt;ref name=Vita70/&gt; The account of the death of Æthelwig along with the ''Vitas'' and the ''Acta'' were published in 1863 in the [[Rolls Series]] number 29, edited by [[William Dunn Macray]].&lt;ref name=Writings304/&gt;&lt;ref name=Graves841&gt;Graves ''Bibliography'' p. 841&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Vita Sancti Egwini'', edited by [[Michael Lapidge]], has been published in the journal ''[[Analecta Bollandiana]]'', which is devoted to the study of hagiography.&lt;ref name=Vita&gt;Lapide (ed.) "Dominic of Evesham" ''Analecta Bollandiana'' pp. 77–104&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emil Szántó''' (22 November 1857, in [[Vienna]] &amp;ndash; 14 December 1904, in Vienna) was an Austrian classical historian and [[epigrapher]].

From 1875 he studied [[philology]] and history at the [[University of Vienna]], receiving his doctorate in 1880. As a student, his teachers were [[Otto Hirschfeld]], [[Theodor Gomperz]], [[Otto Benndorf]], [[Alexander Conze]] and [[Wilhelm von Hartel]]. In 1887 he took a study trip to Greece and [[Asia Minor]], and during the same year, obtained his [[habilitation]] for ancient history at the university. In 1893 he became an associate professor, and shortly afterwards, conducted epigraphic research in Asia Minor with [[Eduard Hula]]. In 1901 he attained a full professorship in classical studies at Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rKI6AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA4-PA27&amp;lpg=RA4-PA27&amp;dq=%22Emil+Sz%C3%A1nt%C3%B3%22+1857&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T2PyNNp9dw&amp;sig=8m_igM7Pshso-GC_En4IvaTtP6k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjj97L209HQAhVh7IMKHXSiBLQ4FBDoAQgvMAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Emil%20Sz%C3%A1nt%C3%B3%22%201857&amp;f=false Die feierliche inauguration des rektors der Wiener universität] by Universität Wien&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biographien.ac.at/oebl/oebl_S_43/Szanto_Emil_1857_1904.xml Szanto (Szántó), Emil (1857–1904)] Österreichisches Biographisches Lexikon und biographische Dokumentation&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2828">'''''Eusko Gudariak''''' (originally spelt '''''Euzko Gudariak''''', "Basque Soldiers") was the [[Second Spanish Republic|republican]] [[anthem]] of the [[Euzko Gudarostea|Eusko Gudarostea]], the army of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Government]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The song used to refer to the defense of the Basque country within the Republic of Spain against the [[nationalist Spain]] army.

It is also used as an anthem by [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]]&lt;ref name="chicago"&gt;[[Last use of capital punishment in Spain|Juan Paredes]] allegedly sang Eusko Gudariak before being executed.

The music is a traditional Basque tune from [[Álava|Araba]], named ''Atzo Bilbon nengoan''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/43297 ''«Euzko gudariak»''], Auñamendi Basque Encyclopaedia.&lt;/ref&gt;
The lyrics were composed in 1932 by José María de Gárate, an officer of the [[EAJ-PNV]].
During the war, Captain Alejandro Lizaso Eizmendi added some verses.

'''Foreign domination''' is a term used in the [[historiography]] of multiple countries to characterize successive periods of rule by foreign powers. The term has notably been used to refer to periods of [[Italian history|Italian]], [[History of Israel|Israeli]], [[Eastern Europe|Eastern European]] and [[History of Poland|Polish]] history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/aboutisrael/history/pages/history-%20foreign%20domination.aspx|title=HISTORY: Foreign Domination|last=|first=|date=|website=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jakubek|first=M.|date=2001|title=[Cracow medical press in the time of foreign domination in Poland (1795-1918) in the light of statistic analysis]|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11965649|journal=Archiwum Historii I Filozofii Medycyny|volume=64|issue=2-3|pages=143–158|issn=0860-1844|pmid=11965649}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/East-Central-Europe-During-World/dp/B01H2R1XLI|title=East Central Europe During World War I: From Foreign Domination To National Independence|last=Sukiennicki|first=Wiktor|date=1984|publisher=East European Monographs/Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign domination is commonly used to describe the condition of foreign rule over Italian states at the beginning of the [[Risorgimento]], when the only state left under local Italian rule was [[Piedmont-Sardinia]] ([[predecessor state]] of Italy). The chronology of the development of foreign domination in Italy is the following:

*Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis (1559): [[Mezzogiorno]] and [[Milan]] under [[Habsburg Spain]] control.

*Wars of Successions in Europe (early 18th century): Milan passes to the [[Austrian Habsburgs]], Mezzogiorno passes to the [[Spanish Bourbons]].

*Dissolution of the [[House of Medici]] (1737): Habsburgs rule over Tuscany begins

*[[Treaty of Campo Formio]] (1797): Venice inglobed into Austria

*[[Congress of Vienna]] (1815) declares Italy a "geographic expression"

*French intervention in Rome (1849): French garrison established in the [[Papal states]]

In his book, ''The Fourth Industrial Revolution'', Schwab describes how this fourth revolution is fundamentally different from the previous three, which were characterized mainly by advances in technology. The underlying basis for 4IR lies in advances in communication and connectivity rather than technology. These technologies have great potential to continue to connect billions of more people to the web, drastically improve the efficiency of business and organizations and help regenerate the natural environment through better asset management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2016/04/05/why-everyone-must-get-ready-for-4th-industrial-revolution/#4816522279c9|title=Why Everyone Must Get Ready For The 4th Industrial Revolution|last=Marr|first=Bernard|newspaper=Forbes (blog)|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“Mastering the Fourth Industrial Revolution” was the theme of the [[World Economic Forum#Annual meeting in Davos|World Economic Forum Annual Meeting]] 2016 in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland. On October 10, 2016, the Forum announced the opening of its new Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in San Francisco.

{{The Holocaust sidebar}}

'''Functionalism versus intentionalism''' is a [[Historiography|historiographical]] debate about the origins of [[the Holocaust]] as well as most aspects of the [[Third Reich]], such as foreign policy. The debate on the origins of the Holocaust centres on essentially two questions:

*Was there a master plan on the part of [[Adolf Hitler]] to launch the Holocaust? Intentionalists argue there was such a plan, while functionalists argue there was not.
*Did the initiative for the Holocaust come from above with orders from Adolf Hitler or from below within the ranks of the [[Germany|German]] bureaucracy? Although neither side disputes the reality of the Holocaust, nor is there serious dispute over the premise that Hitler (as [[Führer]]) was personally responsible for encouraging the [[anti-Semitism]] that allowed the Holocaust to take place, intentionalists argue the initiative came from above, while functionalists contend it came from lower ranks within the bureaucracy.

The terms were coined in a 1981 essay by the British [[Marxism|Marxist]] historian [[Timothy Mason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browning|1986|p=343 n1}}: "The terms 'intentionalist' and 'functionalist' were coined by Tim Mason, 'Intention and Explanation: A Current Controversy about the Interpretation of National Socialism,' ''Der Führerstaat: Mythos und Realität'', ed. [[Gerhard Hirschfeld]] and [[Lothar Kettenacker]] (Stuttgart, 1981), 21-40. Prime examples of the two interpretive approaches can be seen in the articles by Klaus Hildebrand and Hans Mommsen in the same volume."&lt;/ref&gt; Notable functionalists have included [[Raul Hilberg]], [[Christopher Browning]], [[Hans Mommsen]], [[Martin Broszat]], and [[Zygmunt Bauman]]. Notable intentionalists have included [[Andreas Hillgruber]], [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], [[Klaus Hildebrand]], [[Eberhard Jäckel]], [[Richard Breitman]], [[Lucy Dawidowicz]] and [[Daniel Jonah Goldhagen]].

==Origins of the debate==
The search for the origins of the Holocaust began almost as soon as [[World War II]] ended. At the [[Nuremberg War Crimes Trials]] of 1945–6, the "Final Solution to the Jewish Question in Europe" was represented by the prosecution as part of the long-term plan on the part of the Nazi leadership going back to the foundations of the [[Nazi Party]] in 1919. Subsequently, most historians subscribed to what would be today{{when|date=April 2017}} considered to be the extreme intentionalist interpretation. Books such as [[Karl Schleunes]]' ''The Twisted Road to Auschwitz'' which was published in 1970 influenced a number of historians to challenge the prevailing interpretation and suggested there was no master plan for the Holocaust. In the 1970s, advocates of the intentionalist school of thought were known as "the straight road to Auschwitz" camp or as the "programmeists", because they insisted that Hitler was fulfilling a programme. Advocates of the functionalist school were known as "the twisted road to Auschwitz" camp or as the "structuralists", because of their insistence that it was the internal power structures of the Third Reich that led to the Holocaust.

In 1981, the British historian [[Timothy Mason]] published an essay entitled "Intention and Explanation" that was in part an attack on the scholarship of [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]] and [[Klaus Hildebrand]], both of whom Mason accused of focusing too much on [[Adolf Hitler]] as an explanation of the Holocaust. In this essay, Mason called the followers of "the twisted road to Auschwitz"/structuralist school "functionalists" because of their belief that the Holocaust arose as part of the functioning of the Nazi state, while the followers of "the straight road to Auschwitz"/programmeist school were called "intentionalists" because of their belief that it was Hitler's intentions alone that explained the Holocaust. The terms "intentionalist" and "functionalist" have largely replaced the previous terms used to signify the conflicting schools of thought.

== Debate ==

Those historians who take an intentionalist line, like [[Andreas Hillgruber]], argue that everything that happened after [[Operation Barbarossa]] was part of a masterplan he credited Hitler with developing in the 1920s. Hillgruber wrote in his 1967 book ''Germany and the Two World Wars'' that for Hitler:
{{quote|The conquest of European Russia, the cornerstone of the continental European phase of his program, was thus for Hitler inextricably linked with the extermination of these "bacilli", the Jews. In his conception they had gained dominance over Russia with the Bolshevik Revolution. Russia thereby became the center from which a global danger radiated, particularly threatening to the Aryan race and its German core. To Hitler, Bolshevism meant the consummate rule of Jewry, while democracy – as it had developed in Western Europe and Weimar Germany – represented a preliminary stage of Bolshevism, since the Jews there won a leading, if not yet a dominant, influence. This racist component of Hitler's thought was so closely interwoven with the central political element of his program, the conquest of European Russia, that Russia's defeat and the extermination of the Jews were – in theory as later in practice – inseparable for him. To the aim of expansion ''per se'', however, Hitler gave not racial, but political, strategic, economic and demographic underpinnings".{{sfn|Hillgruber|1981|p=51}} }}
The German historian [[Helmut Krausnick]] argued that:
{{quote|What is certain is that the nearer Hitler's plan to overthrow Russia as the last possible enemy on the continent of Europe approached maturity, the more he became obsessed with an idea—with which he had been toying as a "final solution" for a long time—of wiping out the Jews in the territories under his control. It cannot have been later than March 1941, when he openly declared his intention of having the political commissars of the Red Army shot, that he issued his secret decree—which never appeared in writing though it was mentioned verbally on several occasions—that the Jews should be eliminated.{{sfn|Marrus|2000|p=39}} }}
Streim wrote in response that Krausnick had been taken in by the line invented after the war to reduce the responsibility of the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' leaders brought to trial.{{sfn|Streim|1989|pp=439–440}} [[Klaus Hildebrand]] wrote that:
{{quote|In qualitative terms, the executions by shooting were no different from the technically more efficient accomplishment of the 'physical final solution' by gassing, of which they were a prelude.{{sfn|Marrus|2000|p=44}} }}

Against the intentionalist interpretation, functionalist historians like [[Martin Broszat]] argued that the lower officials of the Nazi state had started exterminating people on their own initiative.{{sfn|Broszat|1985|p=399–404}} Broszat argued that the Holocaust began “bit by bit” as German officials stumbled into genocide.{{sfn|Marrus|2000|p=41}} Broszat argued that in the fall of 1941 German officials had begun "improvised" killing schemes as the "simplest" solution to the "Jewish Question".{{sfn|Broszat|1985|p=408}} In Broszat's opinion, Hitler subsequently approved of the measures initiated by the lower officials and allowed the expansion of the Holocaust from Eastern Europe to all of Europe.{{sfn|Broszat|1985|pp=408–413}} In this way, Broszat argued that the ''Shoah'' was not begun in response to an order, written or unwritten, from Hitler but was rather “a way out of the blind alley into which the Nazis had manoeuvred themselves”.{{sfn|Marrus|2000|p=41}} The American historian [[Christopher Browning]] has argued that:
{{quote|Before the invasion, the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were not given explicit orders for the total extermination of Jews on Soviet territory. Along with the general incitement to an ideological and racial war, however, they were given the general task of liquidating "potential" enemies. Heydrich's much-debated directive of 2 July 1941 was a minimal list of those who had to be liquidated ''immediately'', including all Jews in state and party positions. It is very likely, moreover, that the ''Einsatzgruppen'' leaders were told of the ''future'' goal of a ''Judenfrei'' [Jew-free] Russia through systematic mass murder.{{sfn|Rees|1997|pp=194–195}} }}
By contrast, the Swiss historian Philippe Burrin argues that such a decision was not made before August 1941 at the earliest, pointing to orders given by Himmler on 30 July 1941 to the 2nd SS Cavalry Regiment and the [[SS Cavalry Brigade]] operating in the [[Pinsk Marshes|Pripet Marshes]] in the [[Pripyat swamps (punitive operation)|Pripyat operation]] calling for the murder of male Jews only while the Jewish women and children were to be driven into the Marshes.{{sfn|Rees|1997|p=195}} Browning argues that sometime in mid-July 1941 Hitler made the decision to begin general genocide owing to his exhilaration over his victories over the Red Army, whereas Burrin contends that the decision was made in late August 1941 owing to Hitler's frustration over the slowing down of the Wehrmacht.{{sfn|Rees|1997|p=195}} Kershaw argues that the dramatic expansion in both the range of victims and the intensity of the killings after mid-August 1941 indicates that Hitler issued an order to that effect, most probably a verbal order conveyed to the ''Einsatzgruppen'' commanders through either Himmler or Heydrich.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=259}} It remains unclear whether that was a decision made on Hitler's own initiative motivated only by his own anti-Semitic prejudices, or (impressed with the willingness and ability of ''Einsatzgruppe'' A to murder Jewish women and children) ordered that the other three ''Einsatzgruppen'' emulate ''Einsatzgruppe'' A's bloody example.

The Canadian historian Erich Haberer has contended that the “Baltic flashpoint of genocide”, as the killings committed by ''Einsatzgruppe'' A between July–October 1941 are known to historians, were the key development in the evolution of Nazi anti-Semitic policy that resulted in the Holocaust.{{sfn|Haberer|2001|p=65}} The Baltic area witnessed both the most extensive and intense killings of all the ''Einsatzgruppen'' with 90,000–100,000 Jews killed between July and October 1941, which led to the almost total destruction of the Jewish communities in that area.{{sfn|Haberer|2001|p=70}} Haberer maintains that the “Baltic flashpoint of genocide” occurred at time when the other Nazi plans for a “territorial final solution” such as the [[Madagascar Plan]] were unlikely to occur, and thus suggested to the Nazi leadership that genocide was indeed “feasible” as a “final solution to the Jewish Question”.{{sfn|Haberer|2001|p=65}}

==Positions==

===Extreme intentionalist interpretation===
Extreme intentionalists believe that Hitler definitely had plans for the Holocaust by 1924, if not earlier. Dawidowicz argued that Hitler already decided upon the Holocaust no later than by 1919. To support her interpretation, Dawidowicz pointed to numerous extreme anti-Semitic statements made by Hitler. Criticism has centered on the fact that none of these statements refer to killing the entire Jewish people; indeed, very few refer to killing Jews at all. Only once in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' does Hitler ever refer to killing Jews when he states that if only 12,000 to 15,000 Jews had been gassed instead of German soldiers in [[World War I]], then "the sacrifice of millions at the front would not have been in vain." Given that ''Mein Kampf'' is 694 pages long, Dawidowicz's critics contend, she makes too much of one sentence. [[Daniel Goldhagen]] went further, suggesting that popular opinion in Germany was already sympathetic to a policy of Jewish extermination before the Nazi party came to power. He asserts in his book ''Hitler's Willing Executioners'' that Germany enthusiastically welcomed the persecution of Jews by the Nazi regime in the period 1933–39.

===Moderate intentionalist interpretation===
Moderate intentionalists such as Richard Breitman believe that Hitler had decided upon the Holocaust sometime in the late 1930s and certainly no later than 1939 or 1941. This school makes much of Hitler's "Prophecy Speech" of January 30, 1939 before the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] where Hitler stated if "Jewish financiers" started another world war, then "...the result would be the annihilation of the entire Jewish race in Europe." The major problem with this thesis, as [[Yehuda Bauer]] points out, is that though this statement clearly commits Hitler to genocide, he made no effort after delivering this speech to have it carried out. Furthermore, [[Ian Kershaw]] has pointed out that there are several diary entries by [[Joseph Goebbels]] in late 1941, in which Goebbels writes that "the Führer's prophecy is coming true in a most terrible way." The general impression one gets is that Goebbels is quite surprised that Hitler was serious about carrying out the threat in the "Prophecy Speech."

===Extreme functionalist interpretation===
Extreme functionalists such as [[Götz Aly]] believe that the Nazi leadership had nothing to do with initiating the Holocaust and that the entire initiative came from the lower ranks of the German bureaucracy. This philosophy is what is known as the [[bottom-up approach of the Holocaust]]. Aly has made much of documents from the bureaucracy of the German Government-General of Poland arguing that the population of [[Poland]] would have to decrease by 25% to allow the Polish economy to grow. Criticism centers on the idea that this explanation does not really show why the Nazis would deport Jews from [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]] to death camps in Poland if it was Poland the Nazis were concerned with, and why the Jews of Poland were targeted instead of the random sample of 25% of the Polish population.  Additional criticism of functionalism points out that Hitler and other Nazi leaders delayed railcars providing supplies to front line troops in the Soviet Union so that Jews could be deported by rail from the USSR to death camps thus demonstrating the pursuit of genocidal policies over pragmatic wartime actions.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source|date=March 2018}}

===Moderate functionalist interpretation===
Moderate functionalists, such as [[Karl Schleunes]] and [[Christopher Browning]], believe that the rivalry within the unstable Nazi power structure provided the major driving force behind the Holocaust. Moderate functionalists believe that the Nazis aimed to expel all of the Jews from Europe, but only after the failure of these schemes did they resort to genocide. This is sometimes referred to as the "twisted road" to genocide, after a book by Schleunes called "the Twisted Road to Auschwitz"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schleunes|first1=Karl|title=The twisted Road to Auschwitz|publisher=University of Illinois Press|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Twisted_Road_to_Auschwitz.html?id=uIfyhjxw6mAC|isbn=9780252061479|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Synthesis===
A number of scholars such as [[Arno J. Mayer]], [[Yehuda Bauer]], [[Ian Kershaw]] and [[Michael Marrus]] have developed a synthesis of the functionalist and intentionalist schools. They have suggested the Holocaust was a result of pressures that came from both above and below and that Hitler lacked a master plan, but was the decisive force behind the Holocaust. The phrase 'cumulative radicalisation' is used in this context to sum up the way extreme rhetoric and competition among different Nazi agencies produced increasingly extreme policies, as fanatical bureaucratic underlings put into practice what they believed Hitler would have approved based on his widely disseminated speeches and propaganda. This phenomenon is referred to more generally in social psychology as [[groupshift]].

Given the fact that scholars have written so much in relation to Nazi Germany, Richard Bessel asserts that, "The result is a much better informed, much more detailed and more nuanced picture of the Nazi regime, and most serious historians of the Nazi regime now are to some extent both ‘intentionalists’ and ‘functionalists’- insofar as those terms still can be used at all."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bessel, "Functionalists vs. Intentionalists: The Debate Twenty Years on or Whatever Happened to Functionalism and Intentionalism?" ''German Studies Review'' 26, no. 1 (2003): p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Galvano Fiamma''' (1283– [[Milan]] 1344) was an Italian [[Order of Preachers|Dominican]] and [[chronicler]] of [[Milan]].

He was chaplain to the Milanese lord [[Giovanni Visconti (Archbishop of Milan)|Giovanni Visconti]].

He wrote several chronicles dealing with the history of Milan and exalting the [[House of Visconti|Visconti]], who by his day had in effect become its ruling dynasty.

His numerous historical writings include the ''Chronica Galvagnana'', the ''Chronicon extravagans de antiquitatibus Mediolani'', the ''Chronicon maius'', and the ''Manipolus florum seu Historia Mediolanensis''; he is also known for a map of Milan c1330.

He died in Milan in 1344.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5621">'''George Benn''' (1 January 1801 – 8 January 1882) was an Irish historian of [[Belfast]].

==Biography==
Benn was born on 1 January 1801, at [[Tanderagee]], [[County Armagh]]. His grandfather, Jonn Benn, came from [[Cumberland]] about 1760 as engineer of the [[Newry canal]]. His father, also John Benn (1767-1853), was proprietor of a brewery in Belfast ; George was his fourth son. He was educated at the [[Belfast Academy]], under Rev. Dr. Bruce; afterwards under Sheridan Knowles, then a teacher of English at Belfast. He entered the collegiate classes of the [[Belfast Academical Institution]] in 1816, being one of the original alumni, and took gold medals in logic (1817) and moral philosophy (1818).&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Benn, George}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1819 the faculty prize was offered for the 'best account of a parish.' Benn was the successful essayist, with the parish of [[Belfast]] as his theme. He gained also in 1821 the faculty prize ('The Crusades'), and Dr. Tennant's gold medal ('Sketch of Irish Authors in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries'), The lad's essay of 1819 attracted the attention of James M'Knight, LL.D., then editor of the ''[[Belfast News-Letter]]'' who offered to print and publish it. It was issued anonymously in an enlarged form in 1823, with three maps and sixteen engravings by J. Thomson. For so young a writer it was a work of uncommon judgment and research, exceedingly well written, with an eye for scenery and a taste for economics as well as for antiquities. It is not superseded by Benn's later and later labours.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Benn, with his brother Edward (1798- 1874), engaged in distilling near Downpatrick; subsequently the brothers spent the prime of their days on an estate they purchased at [[Glenravel]], near [[Ballymena]]. Here, in an unimproved district, they planted the hillsides, ploughed the moors, built good houses, and collected a valuable library. They endeavoured to create a new industry by an experiment in the manufacture of potato spirit, but excise regulations (since repealed) frustrated their object. The cost of the experiment, and the losses from potato disease, induced the brothers to undertake a business in [[Liverpool]] for some years. Returning to Glenravel, a casual circumstance led to a rich discovery of iron ore in the Glenravel hills; the first specimen was smelted in 1851 under Edward Benn's direction ; in 1866 an agreement&lt;ref&gt;see The Mountains of Iron, by K J O'Hagan, Mid-Antrim Part 2, 1991 for the Agreement.&lt;/ref&gt; was made with Mr. James Fisher, of [[Barrow-in-Furness]], to work the mineral beds.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;  Hence came a new and valuable addition to the commercial products of Ulster, which has since attained important proportions.

Meanwhile, Edward Benn was contributing antiquarian articles to various journals (''Journ. Kilkenny Archæol. Soc.'', ''Irish Penny Journal'', &amp;c.), and forming a fine archaeological collection, now in the [[Belfast Museum]]. It had been proposed to George to resume and complete the history of Belfast. He modestly indicated, as more fit for the task, Mr. William Pinkerton, who collected some materials, but died (1871) without having begun the history. Pinkerton's papers were submitted to George Benn for publication, but he found employment of them impracticable, and states in his preface to his history, 'It is all my own work from beginning to end.'&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

He returned to Belfast after his brother's death in 1874, publishing ''A History of the Town of Belfast'' in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;By strange coincidence a volume of the same size and appearance as Mr. Benn's was independently published that year at Portland, Maine: ''History of the City of Belfast in the State of Maine, from its First Settlement in 1770 to 1875'', by John Williamson.&lt;/ref&gt; A second volume appeared in 1880. This supplementary volume, though the proof-sheets were 'corrected by a kind friend,' the late John Carlisle, head of the English department in the Royal Academical Institution, bears evidence of the author's affecting statement: 'Before I had proceeded very far, my sight entirely failed.' Benn died on 8 January 1882.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Edward and George Benn were members of the nonsubscribing presbyterian (unitarian) body, but wide in their sympathies and broad in their charities beyond the limits of their sect. Edward was the founder, and George the benefactor, of three hospitals in Belfast (the 'Eye, Ear, and Throat,' the 'Samaritan,' and the 'Skin Diseases'), and their gifts to educational institutions were munificent. Both were unmarried. They left four sisters.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

'''Gregory Melleuish''' (born 1954) is an [[Australia]]n associate professor of [[history]] and [[politics]] at the [[University of Wollongong]]. Subjects he teaches include [[Australian politics]], [[political theory]], [[world history]] and [[ancient history]]. Previously, he taught [[European history]] at the [[University of Melbourne]] and [[Australian Studies]] at the [[University of Queensland]].&lt;ref name="UOW"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lha.uow.edu.au/hsi/contacts/UOW018770.html | title=Gregory Melleuish | publisher=School of Humanities and Social Inquiry @ UOW | accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He occasionally contributes opinion pieces for ''[[The Australian]]'', ''[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]''&lt;ref name="UOW"/&gt; and [[On Line Opinion]].

'''Heinrich Ritter von Zeissberg''' (8 July 1839, in [[Vienna]] &amp;ndash; 27 May 1899) was an [[Austria]]n [[historian]].

He studied history at the [[university of Vienna]], receiving his PhD in 1862. In 1865 became a professor of history at the [[university of Lemberg]], and in 1871 relocated as a professor to [[University of Innsbruck|Innsbruck]]. In 1872 he was appointed professor at the university of Vienna, and here he was a tutor of history to the [[Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria|crown prince Rudolph]]. In 1892 he was named director of the Vienna institute for historical research, and in 1896 director of the imperial court library at Vienna. He resigned his professorial chair at Vienna in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1NVRfl4gCw0C&amp;pg=PA666&amp;lpg=PA666&amp;dq=%22Zeissberg,+Heinrich%22+1839+Lemberg&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JjwIUwS7Nc&amp;sig=ZlP3lZvgzRtaMNm3pfRfbHmAKA8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj50di7mZHRAhVF7oMKHUt0BhU4ChDoAQghMAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Zeissberg%2C%20Heinrich%22%201839%20Lemberg&amp;f=false Thibaut - Zycha / edited by Walther Killy] Dictionary of German Biography&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Modernization theory}}
This article delineates the '''history of modernisation theory'''. Modernisation refers to a model of a progressive transition from a 'pre-modern' or '[[Traditional society|traditional]]' to a 'modern' [[society]]. The theory looks at the internal factors of a country while assuming that, with assistance, "traditional" countries can be brought to development in the same manner more developed countries have. Modernisation theory attempts to identify the social variables that contribute to [[social progress]] and development of societies, and seeks to explain the process of [[social evolution]]. Modernisation theory is subject to criticism originating among socialist and free-market ideologies, [[World-systems theory|world-systems]] theorists, [[globalisation]] theorists and [[dependency theory|dependency]] theorists among others. Modernisation theory not only stresses the process of change, but also the responses to that change. It also looks at internal dynamics while referring to social and cultural structures and the adaptation of new technologies. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Earliest expressions of the theory ==
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Émile Durkheim]]

The basic principles of Modernisation theory can be derived from the [[Idea of Progress]], which emerged in the 18th century [[Age of Enlightenment]] with the idea that people themselves could develop and change their society. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The French philosopher [[Marquis de Condorcet]] was involved in the origins of the theory with the idea that technological advancements and economic changes can enable changes in moral and cultural values. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Condorcet was the first to make the connection between economic and social development and to suggest that there can be continuous progress and improvement in human affairs.&lt;ref name="Gilman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilman|first1=Nils|title=Modernization theory : its origins and rise in Cold War America|date=2003|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-0-8018-7399-7|edition=Johns Hopkins pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logic of this view implies that new processes and improvements are continually needed to keep pace with a constantly changing world. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Furthermore, Condorcet advocated technological advancement as a means of giving people further control over their environments, arguing that technological progress would eventually spur social progress. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In addition to [[social structure]] and the evolution of societies, the French [[sociologist]] [[Émile Durkheim]] developed the concept of [[Functionalism (sociology)|functionalism]], which stresses the interdependence of the institutions of a society and their interaction in maintaining cultural and social unity. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} His most famous work is ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'', which described mechanisms for the maintenance of [[social order]] and the ways in which primitive societies might make the transition to becoming more economically advanced industrial societies. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Durkheim suggested that in a capitalist society, with a complex division of labour, economic regulation would be needed to maintain order. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} He stressed that the major transition from a primitive social order to a more advanced industrial society could otherwise bring crisis and disorder. Durkheim furthermore developed the idea of [[social evolution]], which was coined by [[Herbert Spencer]], which indicates how societies and cultures develop over time; for Durkheim, social evolution is like biological evolution with reference to the development of its components. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} As with living organisms and species, societies progress through several stages, generally beginning at a simple level and developing toward a more complex level of organisation. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Societies adapt to surrounding environments, but also interact with other societies, which further contributes to progress and development. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}
Modern sociology evolved in part as a reaction to the problems associated with [[modernity]], such as [[industrialisation]] and the process of [[rationalization (sociology)|'rationalisation']]. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Modernisation theory emerged further in the late 19th century and was especially popular among scholars in the mid-20th century. One notable advocate was Harvard sociologist [[Talcott Parsons]] whose ''Mandarins of the Future'' (2003) stressed the importance of societies remaining open to change and saw reactionary forces as restricting development. Maintaining tradition for tradition's sake was thought to be harmful to progress and development.&lt;ref name="khan 162-164"&gt;Khan, p. 162–164.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of modernisation tend to fall into two camps, optimists and pessimists. The former view holds that what some see as a setback for the theory (events such as the [[Iranian Revolution]] or the persistence of instability in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]) are invariably temporary setbacks &lt;ref&gt;Brugger and Hannan, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; on the road to progress. Pessimists argue that certain 'non-modern' areas of the world are incapable of becoming modern.&lt;ref name="Macionis 953"&gt;Macionis, p. 953.&lt;/ref&gt;

The eminent sociologist [[Max Weber]] also made important contributions to development theory. Weber's concept of "rationalisation" was mobilised by those who held that the most important factor behind modernisation was the growth of rationality as a core value. Normally rationality denotes the universally available logic underpinning thought and deliberation in a particular society. Most theorists consider it indispensable for the modernisation process. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Rationality allows people to think in new and innovative ways; innovation is thus coeval with modernisation.

== Contributors ==

Among the academics who contributed much to this theory are [[Walt Whitman Rostow|W. W. Rostow]], who in his ''The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto'' (1960) concentrates on the [[economic system]] side of the modernisation, trying to show factors needed for a country to reach the path to modernisation in his [[Rostovian take-off model]]. [[David Apter]] concentrated on the [[political system]] and [[history of democracy]], researching the connection between [[democracy]], good [[governance]] and efficiency and modernisation. [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] in "Some Social Requisites of Democracy" (1959) argued that economic development sets off a series of profound social changes that together tend to produce democracy. [[David McClelland]] (''The Achieving Society'', 1967) approached this subject from the [[psychology|psychological]] perspective, with his [[motivation]]s theory, arguing that modernisation cannot happen until a given society values innovation, striving for improvement and entrepreneurship. Alex Inkeles (''Becoming Modern'', 1974) similarly creates a model of ''modern personality'', which needs to be independent, active, interested in public policies and cultural matters, open for new experiences, rational and being able to create long-term plans for the future. [[Edward Said]]'s ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' (1978) interprets modernisation from the point of view of societies that are quickly and radically transformed. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===United States===
[[File:American Progress (John Gast painting).jpg|thumb|300px|This painting (circa 1872) by [[John Gast (painter)|John Gast]] called ''American Progress'', is an allegorical representation of the modernisation of the new west. Here [[Historical Columbia|Columbia]], a personification of the United States, leads civilisation westward with American settlers, stringing telegraph wire as she sweeps west; she holds a school book. The different stages of economic activity of the pioneers are highlighted and, especially, the changing forms of transportation. The Native Americans and wild animals flee.]]
The [[Progressive Era|Progressives in the United States in the early 20th century]] were avid modernisers. They believed in [[science]], technology, expertise—and especially education—as the grand solution to society's weaknesses. Characteristics of progressivism included a favorable attitude toward urban-industrial society, belief in mankind's ability to improve the environment and conditions of life, belief in obligation to intervene in economic and social affairs, and a belief in the ability of experts and in efficiency of government intervention.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Buenker, and KABASO.S.MUYA. ''Progressivism'' (1986); Maureen Flanagan, ''America Reformed: Progressives and Progressivisms, 1890s-1920s'' (2007); Modernisation theory exerts a "powerful influence" on historians dealing with the 1896-1916 era, asserts Martin J. Sklar, ''The United States as a developing country'' (1992) p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Monroe, a professor of history at Columbia University, was a member of [[The Inquiry]]—a team of American experts at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. He drew on his experience in the Philippines to assess the educational needs of developing areas such as Albania, Turkey and central Africa. Presenting educational development as instrumental to nation-building and socioeconomic development, Monroe recommended the implementation of a progressive curriculum - with an emphasis on practical, adult, and teacher training - in a national system of education, as a basis for self-development, except in Africa. His approach shaped American cooperation with developing countries in the 1920s and modernisation efforts during the 1920s-1930s.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Ment, "Education, nation‐building and modernisation after World War I: American ideas for the Peace Conference," ''Paedagogica Historica,'' Feb 2005, Vol. 41 Issue 1/2, pp 159-177&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany's "Sonderweg"===
{{main article|Sonderweg}}
[[Jürgen Kocka|Kocka]] (1988) and Sheri Berman are historians who emphasise the central importance of a German ''[[Sonderweg]]'' ("special path") or "exceptionalism" as the root of [[Nazism]] and the German catastrophe in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Sheri Berman, "Modernisation in Historical Perspective: The Case of Imperial Germany," ''World Politics,'' Volume 53, Number 3, April 2001, pp. 431-462 {{doi|10.1353/wp.2001.0007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Fritz Fischer]] and his students emphasised [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|Germany’s primary guilt for causing World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Kocka, "German History before Hitler: The Debate about the German 'Sonderweg.'" ''Journal of Contemporary History,''  Jan 1988, Vol. 23#1, pp 3-16 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/260865 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], a leader of the [[Bielefeld School]] of social history, places the origins of Germany's path to disaster in the 1860s-1870s, when economic modernisation took place, but political modernisation did not happen and the old Prussian rural elite remained in firm control of the army, diplomacy and the civil service.  Traditional, aristocratic, premodern society battled an emerging capitalist, bourgeois, modernising society. Recognising the importance of modernising forces in industry and the economy and in the cultural realm, Wehler argues that reactionary traditionalism dominated the political hierarchy of power in Germany, as well as social mentalities and in class relations (Klassenhabitus).  The catastrophic German politics between 1914 and 1945 are interpreted in terms of a delayed modernisation of its political structures. At the core of Wehler's interpretation is his treatment of "the middle class" and "revolution," each of which was instrumental in shaping the 20th century. Wehler's examination of Nazi rule is shaped by his concept of "charismatic domination," which focuses heavily on [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;Wehler, ''Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte: Vom Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges bis zur Gründung der Beiden Deutschen Staaten 1914-1949'' (2003) is the fourth volume of his monumental history of German society. None of the series has yet been translated into English. A partial summary appears in Hans-Ulrich Wehler, ''The German Empire, 1871-1918'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

The historiographical concept of a German Sonderweg has had a turbulent history. Scholars of the 19th century who emphasised a separate German path to modernity saw it as a positive factor that differentiated Germany from the "western path" typified by Great Britain. The stressed the strong bureaucratic state, reforms initiated by Bismarck and other strong leaders, the Prussian service ethos, the high culture of philosophy and music, and Germany's pioneering of a [[Welfare state|social welfare state]].  In the 1950s, historians in  West Germany argued that the Sonderweg led Germany to the disaster of 1933-1945. The special circumstances of German historical structures and experiences, were interpreted as preconditions that, while not directly causing National Socialism, did hamper the development of a liberal democracy and facilitate the rise of fascism. The Sonderweg paradigm has provided the impetus for at least three strands of research in [[German historiography]]: the [[long 19th century]], the history of the bourgeoisie, and comparisons with the West.  After 1990, increased attention to cultural dimensions and to comparative and relational history moved German historiography to different topics, with much less attention paid to the Sonderweg.  While some historians have abandoned the Sonderweg thesis, they have not provided a generally accepted alternative interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Walser Smith,  "When the Sonderweg Debate Left Us ," ''German Studies Review,''on May 2008, Vol. 31#2  pp 225-240&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th-century France===
In his seminal book ''Peasants Into Frenchmen: The Modernisation of Rural [[France]], 1880–1914'' (1976), historian [[Eugen Weber]] traced the modernisation of French villages and argued that rural France went from backward and isolated to modern and possessing a sense of French nationhood during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Amato, "Eugen Weber's France" ''Journal of Social History,'' Volume 25, 1992 pp 879–882.&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasised the roles of railroads, republican schools, and universal military conscription. He based his findings on school records, migration patterns, military service documents and economic trends. Weber argued that until 1900 or so a sense of French nationhood was weak in the provinces. Weber then looked at how the policies of the Third Republic created a sense of French nationality in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Eugen Weber, "The Second Republic, Politics, and the Peasant," ''French Historical Studies'' Vol. 11, No. 4 (Autumn, 1980), pp. 521-550 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/286349 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; The book was widely praised, but was criticised by some&lt;ref&gt;Ted W. Margadant, "French Rural Society in the Nineteenth Century: A Review Essay," ''Agricultural History,'' Summer 1979, Vol. 53 Issue 3, pp 644-651&lt;/ref&gt; who argued that a sense of Frenchness existed in the provinces before 1870.

====Greece====
The modernising force of the post-civil war Greek society came primarily as a result of the European and US geopolitical strategy for the region of eastern Mediterranean. Greece ought to be a modern capitalistic state to counter the proximity of several eastern and third world bloc countries and the strong [[Communist Party of Greece|national communist movement]]. According to [[Truman doctrine]] and with the support of local elites, a great economical  leap forward took place along with the severe repression that led to the 1967 coup d'état.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore A. Couloumbis, Greece in the Twentieth Century&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kostis Moskof, Isagogika shri istovia ton kinimatos tis evgatis taxis&lt;/ref&gt;
This dramatic change covered the long-standing cultural divide of greek academia, comparing modern and [[neo-greek]] to ancient and traditional identities. Music, art and [[cinema of greece|cinema]], influenced by the pioneers of American and European tendencies thrived,&lt;ref&gt;Lydia Papadimitriou and Yannis Tzioumakis, Greek Cinema&lt;/ref&gt; until the milestone of 1967, in contrast to the [[authoritarian]] and  [[tradition]]alist military and paramilitary structures. This dimension is vital as it reveals the process of modernisation under the western directives in all social levels that came in fact in opposition to the political directives of the same source.&lt;ref&gt;A. Papachelas, The rape of greek democracy: The American Factor, 1947-1967&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
Many studies of modernisation have focused on the [[history of Japan]] in the [[Meiji period|late 19th]] century,&lt;ref&gt;Shuzo Teruoka, ed. ''Agriculture in the Modernization of Japan, 1850-2000'' (2008); Cyril Black, ''The Modernization of Japan and Russia'' (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[China]] and [[India]] in the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Russell H. Jeffries, ''China's Agricultural Modernization'' (2009); June Grasso, Jay Cornin, and Michael Kort, ''Modernization and Revolution in China: From the Opium Wars to the Olympics'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the process of borrowing science and technology from the West has been explored.

====China====
Modernisation theory failed to explain the experience of China. Mao modernised the People's Republic of China with massive industrialisation projects and social transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eberstadt|first=Nick|title=Did Mao Fail?|journal=The Wilson Quarterly|year=1980|volume=4|series=4|pages=120–133|jstor=40256004}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, China did not become a democratic country after its modernisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hu|first=Shaohua|title=Balancing Development and Democracy: DENG'S ROLE IN THE CHINESE DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS|journal=World Affairs|year=1998|volume=161|series=2|pages=69–81|jstor=20672544}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Nowadays, even though the Soviet-style authoritarian regimes have already collapsed worldwide, China did not have any major political reforms after Mao's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garver|first=John W.|title=The Chinese Communist Party and the Collapse of Soviet Communism|journal=The China Quarterly|year=1993|pages=1–26|jstor=654237}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country remained authoritarian, despite the size of its economic sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=He|first=Baogang|author2=Mark E. Warren|title=Authoritarian Deliberation: The Deliberative Turn in Chinese Political Development|journal=Perspectives on Politics|year=2011|volume=9|issue=2|series=2|pages=269–289|jstor=41479652|doi=10.1017/s1537592711000892|citeseerx=10.1.1.724.6483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China has been attempting to modernise ever since the [[Xinhai Revolution|Revolution of 1911]] and the end of the [[Qing Dynasty]], the last dynasty of China. Before the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, it attempted to reform from 1902 to 1908 to save itself and instigated reforms in infrastructure, transportation, and government. These reforms were based on Western models and even included aspects of democracy, which are often associated with the process of modernisation. However, these reforms were largely unsuccessful and resulted in the Revolution of 1911. Following the Revolution of 1911, other movements such as the [[May 4th Movement]] of 1919 advocated for modernisation, [[iconoclasm]], and a rejection of foreign influence and [[imperialism]]. From the beginning of the 20th century until the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, China has been delayed in efforts to modernise due to an era of warlordism, the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], and civil war between the [[Chinese Communist Party|CCP]] and [[KMT]].&lt;ref name="Prentice Hall"&gt;{{cite book|title=Revolution and Its Past: Identities and Change in Modern China|year=2011|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|edition=Third|editor=R. Keith Schoppa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gardels 2011 61–64"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gardels|first=Nathan|title=The West No Longer Owns Modernity|journal=New Perspect|year=2011|volume=28|issue=3|pages=61–64|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5842.2011.01271.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the communist party came to power in 1949, [[Mao Zedong]] used the Soviet Union as China’s example for modernisation. [[The Great Leap Forward]] from 1958-1961 was Mao’s version of the Soviet Union’s [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five year Plan]], and its goals were to create a modern communist society through industrialisation and collectivisation. Mao Zedong aimed to become a world power without foreign, mainly western, involvement, ideas, or capitalism and preached the idea of self-reliance. Mao did contribute to the modernisation of China, however The Great Leap Forward is regarded as a failure and the [[Cultural Revolution]] from 1966 to 1976 was detrimental to China's industrialisation progress.&lt;ref name="Prentice Hall"/&gt; [[File:Shanghai-pudong panorama.jpg|thumb|The Modern Chinese City of [[Shanghai]]]] However, during Mao's era, he transformed China from a predominantly agrarian country to an industrialised power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ebrey|first=Patricia|title=Modern East Asia from 1600, A Cultural, Social, and Political History|year=2013|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Boston|isbn=978-1-133-60647-5|pages=476–489}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, China was able to produce most of commodities and goods by its own industry. Mao laid the foundation for China's economic development in Deng's era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tsui |first1=Anne S. |last2=Schoonhoven |first2=Claudia Bird |last3=Meyer |first3=Marshall W. |last4=Lau |first4=Chung-Ming |last5=Milkovich |first5=George T. |title=Organization and Management in the Midst of Societal Transformation: The People's Republic of China |journal=Organization Science |year=2004 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=133–144 |jstor=30034719 |doi=10.1287/orsc.1040.0063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic reforms of Chinese Supreme Leader [[Deng Xiaoping]] are attributed to China’s economic success in the 21st century. Deng focused on four modernisations: agriculture, industry, national defense, and science and technology. The West was used as an example for several of these modernisations, however their management was completely Chinese. Deng began de-collectivisation and allowed [[Township and Village Enterprise]]s (TVE), [[Special Economic Zone]]s (SEZ), foreign investment, profit incentive, and even privatisation.

While Mao advocated self-reliance, Deng generated foreign exchange to finance modernisation. His famous quote is, "It doesn’t matter whether a cat is white or black, as long as it catches mice." Post Deng Reforms continued on this path, which is acknowledged as a shift from the [[iron rice bowl]] to the porcelain rice bowl, or government owned to privatised. Although China’s economy has shifted towards privatisation and capitalism, the PRC remains an authoritative regime, which is contradictory in comparison to other examples of countries that have modernised. Democracy is the political characteristic that has defined modernised nations in the past and the modernisation theory suggests democracy follows with the development of a modernised state.&lt;ref name="Gardels 2011 61–64"/&gt; China was late in modernisation and has thus had many other countries as examples to base its model of modernisation off of.&lt;ref name="Prentice Hall"/&gt;

The [[One-Child Policy]] has also been a technique to contribute or even force the modernisation of China. Instigated in 1978, the one-child policy has created a generation known as "singletons" or "little emperors" (''xiao huangdi'').&lt;ref name="Little Emperors"&gt;{{cite book|title=Feeding China's Little Emperors:Food Children and Social Change|year=2000|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|editor=Jun Jing}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Chinese state enforced a rapid fertility transition designed to cultivate a generation of "high-quality" people with resources and ambition to join the global elite."&lt;ref name="One-Child Policy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fong|first=Vanessa|title=Only Hope: Coming of Age under China's One-Child Policy|year=2004|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|page=17|isbn=978-0804753302}}&lt;/ref&gt; These little emperors are expected to compete with the first-world countries having no siblings to compete with for parental investment. Normally with modernisation and urbanisation smaller or [[nuclear family|nuclear families]] evolve as the result. China has switched this logic, hoping that creating the culture of the nuclear family with the one-child policy it will produce modernisation.&lt;ref name="One-Child Policy"/&gt;

At the beginning of the 21st century, China is still in the process of modernisation. In 2010 it had the third greatest GDP and GDP (PPP) in the world with the world’s largest labour force, and is acknowledged as the world’s second largest economy.&lt;ref name="Gardels 2011 61–64"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CIA World Fact Book"&gt;{{cite web|title=CIA|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html|work=East and Southeast Asia: China|accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010 its economy was still increasing in growth at 10.3%.&lt;ref name="CIA World Fact Book"/&gt; China has also successfully joined the largely Western international arena with its membership of the [[United Nations|UN]] in 1971, the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] in 2001, and hosted the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] in 2008. China’s goal is to continue modernising until it joins the first-world and becomes the core instead of the semi-periphery or periphery, from the [[core-periphery| core-periphery model]].&lt;ref name="Prentice Hall"/&gt;&lt;ref name="One-Child Policy"/&gt;

The modernisation of China through urbanisation, industrialisation, and economic policy has benefited the country economically as it rises as a world power in the 21st century. However it now is experiencing the problems associated the other modern countries and capitalism. These problems include the growing disparity between the rich and poor, urban vs. rural and migration, and ecological issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowntree|first=Lester|title=Diversity Amid Globalization: World Regions, Environment, Development|year=2008|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=978-0-13-600554-4|edition=Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Korea====
Modernisers in [[South Korea]] in the late 19th century were torn between the American and the Japanese models. Most of the Koreans involved were educated Christians who saw America as their ideal model of civilisation. However, most used Japan as a practical model - as an example of how a fellow East Asian country, which 30 years before was also backward, could succeed in modernising itself. At the same time, reformists' nationalist reaction against the domineering, colonial behaviour of the Japanese in Korea often took the form of an appeal to international (Western) standards of civilisation. The Western-oriented worldview of the early Christian nationalist reformers was complex, multilayered, and often self-contradictory - with 'oppressive' features not easily distinguishable from 'liberational' ones. Their idealised image of the West as the only true, ideal civilisation relegated much of Korea's traditional culture to a position of 'oriental'.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Tikhonov, "The 1890s Korean Reformers' View of Japan - a Menacing Model?" ''International Journal of Asian Studies'' 2005 2(1): 57-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The self-image of Koreans was formed through complex relationships with modernity, colonialism, Christianity, and nationalism. This formation was initiated by a change in the notion of 'civilisation' due to the transformation of 'international society' and thereafter was affected by the trauma of Japanese colonisation. Through the process of transition from a traditional Confucian notion of civilisation to a Western notion of acceptance and resistance, Koreans shaped their civilisation as well as their notions of the racial, cultural, and individual modern self. Western Orientalism, in particular, accompanied the introduction of the Western notion of civilisation, which served as the background for forming the self-identity of Koreans. The fact that the Japanese version of [[Orientalism]] emerged from the domination of Korea by Japan played a critical role in shaping the self-identity of Koreans. Consequently, Korea still maintains an inferiority complex toward Western culture, ambivalent feelings toward Japanese culture, and biased - positive or negative - views of their own cultural traditions. Thus both modernisation and colonisation have shaped the formation or distortion of self-consciousness of non-Western peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Yong-hwa Chung, "The Modern Transformation of Korean Identity: Enlightenment and Orientalism," ''Korea Journal'' 2006 46(1): 109-138&lt;/ref&gt;

The US launched a decades-long intensive development starting in 1945 to modernise South Korea, with the goal of helping it become a model nation-state and an economic success. Agents of modernisation at work in Korea included the US Army, the Economic Cooperation Administration, the UN Korean Reconstruction Agency, and a number of nongovernmental organisations, among them the Presbyterian Church, the [[YMCA]], Boy Scouts and the [[Ford Foundation]].   Many Koreans migrated to California and Hawaii, and brought back firsthand accounts of modern business and governmental practices that they sought to adapt to Korean conditions.&lt;ref&gt;David Ekbladh, "How to Build a Nation," ''Wilson Quarterly'' 2004 28(1): 12-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====
Modernisation theory was not compatible with Japan's experience. After industrialisation and economic modernisation, a democratic society did not appear in Japan. Japan instead became an aggressive authoritarian fascist state, up until the Allied Forces defeated Japan in the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berry|first=Mary Elizabeth|title=Public Life in Authoritarian Japan|journal=Daedalus|year=1998|volume=127|series=3|pages=133–165|jstor=20027510}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were almost no democratic principles or practices in pre-war Japanese politics. Prior to the liberation of Japan by the United States from its military government, Japanese culture always honoured obedience and hierarchy, and Japanese people also despised individualism and liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berger|first=Thomas U.|title=From Sword to Chrysanthemum: Japan's Culture of Anti-militarism|journal=International Security|year=1993|volume=17|issue=4|series=4|pages=119–150|jstor=2539024|doi=10.2307/2539024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan had already modernised and became an industrialised country during its Meiji period, which happened long before Japan's defeat in the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=La Follette|first=Philip F. |author2=Edward M. Coffman |author3=Paul H. Hass|title=With MacArthur in the Pacific: A Memoir by Philip F. La Follette|journal=The Wisconsin Magazine of History|date=1980–1981|volume=64|series=2|pages=82–106|jstor=4635497}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan was probably the first country in East Asia that industrialised successfully. It quickly became one of the imperialist and colonial powers. Japan defeated the Qing dynasty of China in 1894, and subsequently defeated Russia in 1905. Korea and Taiwan were annexed by the Japanese Empire later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Samuels|first=Richard J.|title=Reinventing Security: Japan since Meiji|journal=Daedalus|year=1991|volume=120|series=4|pages=47–68|jstor=20025403}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Japan invaded China in 1931, it had already finished its industrialising process and had enough industrial power to wage a war itself. Japan's navy was among one of the world's most advanced navies, with almost no challenger in the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yamamura|first=Kozo|title=Success Illgotten? The Role of Meiji Militarism in Japan's Technological Progress|journal=The Journal of Economic History|year=1977|volume=37|series=1|pages=113–135|jstor=2119450|doi=10.1017/s0022050700096777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance of Japan after the Second War was simply a result of the military supremacy of the United States. The United States absolutely ruled over Japan after its defeat, with General MacArthur as the de facto emperor of Japan at the time. Japan had no choice but listen to the orders of General MacArthur and his colleagues. In order to be compatible with the foreign policy and national interest of the United States, SCAP and General MacArthur forced Japan to demilitarise and democratise after 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kitahara|first=Michio|title=Douglas MacArthur as a Father Figure in Occupied Japan After World War II|journal=International Social Science  Review|year=1989|volume=64|series=1|pages=20–28|jstor=41881853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan quickly went through a lot of changes concerning modernisation after their defeat. This happened starting with United States quickly intervening with Japan internally. American demilitarisation and democratisation was accepted by the people of Japan without strong resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ebrey|first=Patricia|title=Modern East Asia from 1600, A Cultural, Social, and Political History|year=2013|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Boston|isbn=978-1-133-60647-5|pages=461–464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the occupation of United States, SCAP ([[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers]]) was established, which was an institution in charge of formulating policies. The goal of SCAP was to dissolve the army and navy, and also to punish responsible leaders, and it established the New constitution of 1946.&lt;ref name="Modern Japan"&gt;{{cite book|title=A history of Modern Japan|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; SCAP could not function without the assistance of Japanese government because the language barrier was too high. However, this actually helped make bigger changes in creating demilitarisation and democratisation.  SCAP helped people to gain freedoms of speech, press and the right to organise labour or farmer unions.

As such, the new constitution created by SCAP granted civil and political rights to the people; consequently, leading to modernisation. It also allowed freedom of speech and association, right to organise labour association and movements, or create unions, and implemented grounds for incredible civil right for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ebrey|first=Patricia|title=Modern East Asia from 1600, A Cultural, Social, and Political History|year=2013|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Boston|isbn=978-1-133-60647-5|pages=460–468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government also held an important role in modernising Japan. Japan concentrated on their industry and technology to achieve growth. For that, the state gave assistances to several industries and adopted protectionism policies. Government stepped in as lender, as facilitator of access to foreign exchange, raw materials, or technology licenses, and as rescuer when problems arise.&lt;ref name="Modern Japan"&gt;{{cite book|title=A history of Modern Japan|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate, the most important guiding agency was the [[MITI]] (Ministry of International Trade and Industry). In addition, through the 1960s, Japanese government used economic policies such as tariffs to obstruct imports and protect Japanese firms from foreign competitors in domestic market to become a modernised country.

====Turkey====
[[Turkey]], under [[Kemal Atatürk]] in the 1920s and 1930s, engaged in a systematic modernisation programme [[Atatürk's Reforms|called "Kemalism"]]. Hundreds of European scholars came to help. Together with Turkish intellectuals they developed a successful model of development.&lt;ref&gt;Craig C. Hansen, "Are We Doing Theory Ethnocentrically? A Comparison of Modernization Theory and Kemalism," ''Journal of Developing Societies'' (0169796X), 1989, Vol. 5 Issue 2, pp 175-187&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murat Ergin, "Cultural encounters in the social sciences and humanities: western émigré scholars in Turkey," ''History of the Human Sciences,'' Feb 2009, Vol. 22 Issue 1, pp 105-130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Reisman, ''Turkey's Modernization: Refugees from Nazism and Atatürk's Vision'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Ward and Dankwart Rustow, eds. ''Political Modernization in Japan and Turkey'' (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin America===
Since independence, modernisation has been a driving force for [[Chile]]'s political elites. Ree (2007) analyses projects of modernisation that have been implemented from above since 1964. Despite their ideological differences and very different understandings of what modernity is, these projects shared key characteristics in their construction and implementation, such as the use of developmental theories, their state-orientation, the prominent role of technocrats and state-planning, and the capacity of adaptation in sight of civil unrest. These projects have produced patterns of modernity that have proven particularly stable.&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Van Der Ree, "Modernisation in Chile: from the 'Revolution in Liberty' to 'Growth with Equity'," ''Bicentenario: Revista De Historia De Chile Y America'' 2007 6(2): 39-69&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
Modernisation has been attributed with creating positive development around the world, but in Modern times its ability to promote development, specifically in [[Africa]], has been less than so.  Modernisation that has taken place in Africa can be described as something that has yet to benefit most of the African countries.

Modernisation through development has led to problems in [[Nigeria]] by bringing in private, foreign owned oil companies that have been exploiting the natural resource wealth of the country.  Because the oil companies are generally owned by a different nation, the profits are mostly being exported from Nigeria with only one fifteenth of the wealth produced in the region returning to it.  Shell, the oil company operating in Ogoniland, Nigeria has helped the country develop and industrialise on a small scale, but it has primarily challenged the sovereignty and autonomy of Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogowski|first=edited by Patrick O'Neil, Ronald|title=Essential readings in comparative politics|year=2010|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-93401-4|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lot of scholars view modernisation as a sort of westernisation where western institutions such as national parks and industries are brought into existing cultures where their use does not make as much sense.  Along with modernisation comes a loss of culture and society, and the individual is strengthened. An African tribe known as the Ik was forced to change their habits due to modernisation and the creation of individual countries caused by colonialism. Nationalisation, as a tool of modernisation, was imparted on Africa by colonialists who wanted to westernise and modernise tribal Africa.  The creation of individual countries made life for the tribal Ik more difficult because they were forced out of their nomadic lifestyle into a settlement based around a newly founded national park that practically destroyed their livelihood by restricting their hunting grounds to specific non-park areas.  The creation of national parks have increased cultivation, which can be seen as good development because people no longer depend solely  on livestock.  This creation of a new sort of livelihood has mixed improvements, because the tribal setting is not removed, but is put into a single place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turbull|first=Colin M.|title=The Mountain People|year=1972|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johann Georg Lairitz''' (July 15, 1647 – April 4, 1716) was a German theologian, was born July 15, 1641, at [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]], in [[Bavaria]]. In 1667 he entered the [[University of Jena|university at Jena]]; in 1677 he was graduated [[Master of Arts|M.A.]], and became in 1673 professor of Church and profane history at the gymnasium of [[Bayreuth|Baireuth]]; in 1675, librarian and instructor of the [[margrave]]s Erdmann Philipp and [[Georg Albrecht, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth-Kulmbach|Georg Albrecht]]; in 1685, deacon of the court Church; in 1688, superintendent at Neustadt. In 1697 he accepted the call of the [[William Ernest, Duke of Saxe-Weimar|duke Wilhelm Ernst of Weimar]], and he then became superintendent in general, counselor of the consistory, first preacher of the Petri-Paul Church, and director of the gymnasium. He died April 4, 1716.

He left numerous productions, e.g. ''Diss. de simplici et composito'' (Jenae, 1668, 4to): — ''Auszug der Kirchengeschichte des Neuen Testans.'' (Baireuth und Niremb. 1678, 12mo): ''— Synopsis historiae ecclesiasticae Novi Testam.'' (ibid. 1678, 12mo): — ''Der romische Papst-Thron, d. i. gründliche und ausführliche Beschreibung des papstlichen Ehrund Macht-und Wachsthums'' (ibid, 1685, 4to).

'''John William Jamieson Herivel''' (29 August 1918 – 18 January 2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Smith | first = Michael | author-link = Michael Smith (newspaper reporter) | title = John Herivel obituary: One of Bletchley Park's most brilliant wartime codebreakers | newspaper = The Guardian | date = 13 February 2011 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/13/john-herivel-obituary | accessdate = 20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a British [[science historian]] and former [[World War II]] [[Cryptanalysis|codebreaker]] at [[Bletchley Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Special Forces Obituaries: John Herivel | newspaper = The Telegraph | date = 20 July 2011 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/special-forces-obituaries/8275117/John-Herivel.html | accessdate = 20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a codebreaker concerned with [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma]], Herivel is remembered chiefly for the discovery of what was soon dubbed the '''Herivel tip''' or '''Herivelismus'''. Herivelismus consisted of the idea, the [[John Herivel#The Herivel tip|Herivel tip]] and the method of establishing whether it applied using the [[John Herivel#The Herivel square|Herivel square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Herivel|2008|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on Herivel's insight into the habits of German operators of the [[Enigma machine|Enigma cipher machine]] that allowed Bletchley Park to easily deduce part of the daily [[key (cryptography)|key]]. For a brief but critical period after May 1940, the Herivel tip in conjunction with "[[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Operating shortcomings|cillies]]" (another class of operator error) was the main technique used to solve Enigma.

After the war, Herivel became an academic, studying the [[history and philosophy of science]] at [[Queen's University Belfast]], particularly [[Isaac Newton]], [[Joseph Fourier]], [[Christiaan Huygens]]. In retirement, he wrote an autobiographical account of his work at Bletchley Park entitled ''Herivelismus and the German Military Enigma''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Herivel|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recruitment to Bletchley Park==
John Herivel was born in [[Belfast]], and attended [[Methodist College Belfast]] from 1924 to 1936. In 1937 he was awarded a Kitchener Scholarship to study mathematics at [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]], where his supervisor was [[Gordon Welchman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Herivel|2008|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="methody"&gt;{{Citation | title = Obituary – John Herivel | newspaper = Methodist College Belfast | date = 28 January 2011 | url = http://www.methody.org/Former-Pupils.aspx | accessdate = 20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Welchman recruited Herivel to the [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)|Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)]] at [[Bletchley Park]]. Welchman worked with [[Alan Turing]] in the newly formed [[Hut 6]] section created to solve Army and Air Force Enigma.&lt;ref name="sebag90"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sebag-Montefiore|2000|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herivel, then aged 21, arrived at Bletchley on 29 January 1940,&lt;ref name="welchman220"&gt;{{Harvnb|Welchman|1997|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was briefed on Enigma by Alan Turing and Tony Kendrick.&lt;ref name="smith42"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1998|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enigma==
[[File:EnigmaMachineLabeled.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Military Enigma machine.]]
At the time that Herivel started work at Bletchley Park, Hut 6 was having only limited success with Enigma-enciphered messages, mostly from the [[Luftwaffe]] Enigma network known as "Red".&lt;ref name="sebag90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smith42"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Welchman|1997|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was working alongside [[David Rees (mathematician)|David Rees]], another Cambridge mathematician recruited by Welchman, in nearby Elmers School, testing candidate solutions and working out plugboard settings.&lt;ref name="sebag90"/&gt; The process was slow, however, Herivel was determined to find a method to improve their attack, and he would spend his evenings trying to think up ways to do so.&lt;ref name="smith42"/&gt;

Intercepted [[Morse code]]d messages had been enciphered by the Germans’ [[Enigma machine|Enigma]], an [[Electromechanics|electro-mechanical]] [[rotor machine|rotor cipher machine]] that implemented a [[polyalphabetic cipher]]. The main model in use in 1940 had three [[Enigma rotor details|rotors]] that set an electrical pathway from the keyboard to the lampboard. Pressing a key caused one lamp to light and the right-most rotor to advance by one letter position. This changed the electrical pathway so that pressing the same key again caused a different letter to light up. At one of the 26 positions, a notch on the right-most rotor engaged with the middle rotor so that the two rotors advanced together, and similarly the middle rotor would engage with the left-most rotor, giving a very long period before the sequence repeated (26 &amp;times; 26 &amp;times; 26 = 17,576). The ring on the rotor that contained the notch and so caused the next rotor to advance, could be set to any one of the 26 positions. The three rotors were selected from a set of five, giving 60 different ways of mounting rotors in the machine. However, because the Germans laid down the rule that no rotor should be in the same position on successive days, if the previous days's rotors and their positions were known, this number was reduced to 32.

The Enigma machine worked reciprocally so that an identical machine with identical settings would, if fed the enciphered letters, show the deciphered letters on the lampboard. Hut 6 had Enigma replica machines that were logically identical to the machines that the Germans were using. To decipher the intercepted messages required that the selection of rotors, the ring settings and the plugboard connections were known. At this time, the first three letters of the prelude to the message were used as an [[Enigma machine#Indicator|indicator]] to tell the receiving operator the letters that should appear in the windows for this particular message.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Rijmenants | first = Dirk | title = Enigma Message Procedures | work = Cipher Machines and Cryptology | url = http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/enigmaproc.htm | accessdate = 19 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Herivel tip==
[[File:Enigma rotors and spindle showing contacts rachet and notch.jpg|thumb|Two Enigma rotors showing electrical contacts, stepping ratchet (on the left) and notch (on the right-hand rotor opposite letter '''D''').]]
Herivel had an insight in February 1940 that some lazy German code clerks might give away the Enigma's ring settings (''Ringstellung'') in their first message of the day. If there were several lazy clerks, the first message ''Grundstellung''s would not be random but would have a clustering around the ''Ringstellung''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sebag-Montefiore|2000|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- some reference showed the clustering --&gt; The insight became known as the Herivel tip. It was not needed at the time because the Luftwaffe was doubly-enciphering their message keys so techniques such as [[Zygalski sheets]] could be used. In May 1940, the Germans stopped the doubly-enciphered keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Alan|last=Stripp|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/military/how-enigma-works.html|title=How the Enigma Works|website=NOVA|publisher=PBS Online|date=9 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other methods becoming ineffective, Bletchley Park started using the Herivel tip to break Luftwaffe traffic. It continued to be the main method until the [[bombe]] was delivered in August 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bletchley Park – Remembering Herivel and the Herivel Tip |date=23 January 2011 |url=http://benjaminellis.org/2011/01/23/bletchley-park-remembering-herivel-and-the-herivel-tip/ |accessdate=2016-08-05 |quote=However, on the 1st of May, the Germans changed their methods, rendering the existing techniques inoperable. Alan Turing and his team had already anticipated this change, and were building a machine (the Bombe – in effect a computer) to decode the messages. That left a people [sic] from the 1st of May to the 1st of August, while the Bomb was being built. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sebag-Montefiore|2000|p=81}}&lt;!--Enigma: The Battle for the Code, ISBN 0-471-40738-0 --&gt; states that Bletchley looked for the clusters but did not find any until May 1940. "After the Germans altered their indicator system on 1 May 1940, which meant that no Enigma messages, other than those in Norway, were being read, Herivel's idea became even more important, since it was one of the few leads that the codebreakers had."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hinsley|Thomas|Simkins|Ransom|1988|p=954}} says first British bombe arrived 18 March 1940. Hinsley states that "Welchman's ... explanation of the 'Herivel tip' is incomplete." F. H. Hinsley, E. E. Thomas, C. A. G. Simkins, C. F. G. Ransom, ''British Intelligence in the Second World War: Its Influence on Strategy and Operations'', Vol 3 Part 2, Cambridge University Press, British Crown Copyright, {{ISBN|0-521-351960}} https://books.google.com/books?id=OMsOIZeMPW8C&amp;pg=PA954&amp;lpg=PA954&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enigma enciphering procedure===
The rotors and the positioning of the ring containing the notch were changed daily. The settings were defined in a [[codebook]] that was common to all operators on that network. At the start of each day, before any messages were sent or received, Enigma operators implemented the day's rotor selection and ring settings. Having selected the three rotors, they adjusted the ring settings. That could be done before the rotors were mounted on their axle or after they had been inserted into the machine. It was possible to adjust the ring settings of the loaded rotors by moving the spring-loaded retaining pin to the right and turning the rotor to display the specified letter. Herivel thought it likely that at least some of the operators would adjust the rings after they had mounted the rotors in the machine.&lt;ref name="smith43"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1998|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having set the alphabet rings and closed the lid, the operator should then have moved the rotors well away from the positions that displayed the three letters of the ring setting in the windows, but some operators did not.

[[File:Enigma-rotor-stack-cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Three rotors inside an Enigma machine. In the middle rotor, the ring setting pin can be seen with a small red indicating arrow adjacent to the '''01''' position. To adjust the ring setting, the spring-loaded pin could be moved to the right to allow the ring to be turned until at the desired position.]]
Herivel's great insight came to him one evening in February 1940 while he was relaxing in front of his landlady's fire. Stressed or lazy operators who had set the rings when the rotors were in the machine might then have left ring setting at or near the top and used those three letters for the first message of the day.&lt;ref name="sebag91"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sebag-Montefiore|2000|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For each transmitted message, the sending operator would follow a standard procedure. From September 1938, he would use an initial position to encrypt the [[Enigma machine#Indicator|indicator]] and send it in clear, followed by the message key that had been enciphered at that setting. If the ''ground setting'' ({{lang-de|link=no|Grundstellung}}) was '''GKX''' for example, he would then use Enigma with the rotors set to '''GKX''' to encrypt the ''message setting'', which he might choose to be '''RTQ'''; which might encrypt to '''LLP'''. (Before May 1940, the encrypted message setting was repeated, but that makes no difference to Herivel's insight.) The operator would then turn his rotors to '''RTQ''' and encrypt the actual message. Thus, the preamble to the message would be the unencrypted ground setting ('''GKX'''), followed by the encrypted message setting ('''LLP'''). A receiving Enigma operator could use the information to recover the message setting and then decrypt the message.

The ground setting ('''GKX''' in the above example) should have been chosen at random, but Herivel reasoned that if operators were lazy, in a hurry or otherwise under pressure, they might simply use whatever rotor setting was currently showing on the machine.&lt;ref name="smith43"/&gt; If that was the first message of the day and the operator had set the ring settings with the rotors already inside the machine, the rotor position currently showing on the machine could well be the ring setting itself or be very close to it. (If that situation occurred in the above example, '''GKX''' would be the ring setting or close to it).

Polish cryptographers used the idea at [[PC Bruno]] during the [[Phoney War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Kozaczuk |first=Władysław |editor-last=Kasparek |editor-first=Christopher |title=Enignma: How the German Machine Cipher was Broken, and How it was Read by the Allies in World War Two |publisher=University Publications of America |isbn=0-89093-547-5 |year=1984 |pages=83–84 |quote="... it was found that the German encipherers, after setting their Enigmas in the starting position and closing the metal lid, were selecting as the message key (Spuchschlüssel) the letters visible in the glass windows.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Herivel square===
The day after his insight, Herivel's colleagues agreed that his idea was a possible way into Enigma.&lt;ref name="welchman220"/&gt; Hut 6 began looking for the effect predicted by the Herivel tip and arranged to have the first messages of the day from each transmitting station to be sent to them early.&lt;ref name="smith43"/&gt; They plotted the indicators in a grid termed a "Herivel square",&lt;ref name="welchman100"&gt;{{Harvnb|Welchman|1997|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; an example of which is shown below. The rows and columns of the grid are labelled with the alphabet. The first indicator of the first message of the day received from each station on the network, was entered into the grid. It was done by finding the column corresponding to the first letter, the row corresponding to the second letter, and entering the third letter into the cell where the row and column intersected. For example, '''GKX''' would be recorded by entering a '''X''' in the cell in column '''G''' and row '''K'''.

The Herivel tip suggested that there would be a cluster of entries close together, such as the cluster around '''GKX''' in the above example. That would narrow the options for the ring settings down from 17,576 to a small set of possibilities, perhaps 6 to 30, which could be tested individually.

The effect predicted by Herivel did not immediately show up in the Enigma traffic,&lt;ref name="sebag91"/&gt; however, and Bletchley Park had to continue to rely on a different technique to get into Enigma: the method of "[[perforated sheets]]", which had been passed on by Polish cryptologists. The situation changed on 1 May 1940, when the Germans changed their indicating procedure, rendering the perforated sheet method obsolete. Hut 6 was suddenly unable to decrypt Enigma.

Fortunately for the codebreakers, the pattern predicted by the Herivel tip began to manifest itself soon after on 10 May, when the Germans invaded the Netherlands and Belgium. David Rees spotted a cluster in the [[Enigma machine#Indicator|indicators]],&lt;ref name="smith43"/&gt; and on 22 May an Air Force message sent on 20 May was decoded, the first since the change in procedure.&lt;ref name="sebag92"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sebag-Montefiore|2000|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional key components===
Although the Herivel tip provided the Enigma's ring settings, it did not provide other parts of the Enigma key: the rotor order and the plugboard settings. A Luftwaffe key at the time chose from 5 rotors, so there were 60 possible rotor orders. In addition, there might be 8 to 10 plugboard connections, which means that all but 6 of the 26 letters are permuted by the plugboard. The codebreakers had to use other methods to find the remaining portions of the Enigma key.

The Herivel tip was used in combination with another class of operator mistake, known as "[[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Operating shortcomings|cillies]]", to solve the settings and decipher the messages.&lt;ref name="sebag91"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Welchman|1997|pp=104–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Herivel tip was used for several months until specialised codebreaking machines designed by [[Alan Turing]], the so-called "[[bombe]]s", were ready for use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Welchman|1997|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition===
Gordon Welchman wrote that the Herivel tip was a vital part of breaking Enigma at Bletchley Park. {{quote|If Herivel had not been recruited in January 1940, who would have thought of the Herivel tip, without which we would have been defeated in May 1940 – unable to maintain continuity until the bombes began to arrive many months later? Let there be no misconceptions about this last point. Loss of continuity would, at all stages, have been very serious, if not disastrous."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Welchman|1997|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Because of the importance of his contribution, Herivel was singled out and introduced to [[Winston Churchill]] during a visit to Bletchley Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1998|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also taught Enigma [[cryptanalysis]] to a party of Americans assigned to [[Hut 6]] in an intensive two-week course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = American 6813 Division History | date = October 1945 | url = http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/documents/a6813his/index.htm | accessdate = 20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herivel later worked in administration in the "[[Newmanry]]", the section responsible for solving German teleprinter ciphers by using machine methods such as the [[Colossus computer]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Good|1993|pp=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; as assistant to the head of the section, mathematician [[Max Newman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Newman | first = William | contribution = Max Newman—Mathematician, Codebreaker, and Computer Pioneer | editor-last = Copeland | editor-first = B.

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, researchers studying a set of Enigma-encrypted messages from World War II noted the occurrence of clustering, as predicted by the Herivel tip, in messages from August 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Sullivan |first1=Geoff |last2=Weierud |first2=Frode |year=2005 |title=Breaking German Army Ciphers |periodical=Cryptologia |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=193–232 |doi=10.1080/01611190508951299 |url=http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/pdf/papers/ucry_06.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824135213/http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/pdf/papers/ucry_06.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 August 2006 |accessdate=20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After World War II==
After the end of the war, Herivel taught mathematics in a school for a year,&lt;ref name="methody"/&gt; but he found he could not handle the "rumbustious boys".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Jones | first = Daniel | title = Bletchley Revisited: Modest War Hero Returns to the Scene of his Greatest Code-Cracking Triumph | date = 27 May 2001 | url = http://cipherweb.open.ac.uk/cgi-bin/cipher-demo/mobile/sms_stories_xml.py?phoneno=555&amp;id=52&amp;concepts=() | archive-url = https://archive.is/20121224032119/http://cipherweb.open.ac.uk/cgi-bin/cipher-demo/mobile/sms_stories_xml.py?phoneno=555&amp;id=52&amp;concepts=() | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 24 December 2012 | accessdate = 20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then joined Queen's University Belfast, where he became [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] in the History and Philosophy of Science. One of the students that he supervised was the actor [[Simon Callow]], who said of him: {{quote|“I was absolutely astonished. He was a wonderful teacher, in the old fashioned way. During his tutorials he used to make tea and toast crumpets by the fire.

He is perhaps best known for his theories on [[communicative rationality]] and the [[public sphere]]. In 2014, ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]'' readers chose Habermas as one of their favourites among the "world's leading thinkers".&lt;ref name="prospectmagazine.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/features/world-thinkers-2014-the-results|title=World thinkers 2014: The results|author=Serena Kutchinsky|date=23 April 2014|publisher=Prospect Magazine |quote=12. Jürgen Habermas, philosopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Associated with the [[Frankfurt School]], Habermas's work focuses on the foundations of [[epistemology]] and [[social theory]], the analysis of [[advanced capitalism]] and [[democracy]], the [[rule of law]] in a critical [[Sociocultural evolution|social-evolutionary context]], and contemporary politics, particularly German politics. Habermas's theoretical system is devoted to revealing the possibility of reason, [[Political emancipation|emancipation]], and rational-critical communication latent in modern institutions and in the human capacity to deliberate and pursue rational interests. Habermas is known for his work on the concept of [[modernity]], particularly with respect to the discussions of [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] originally set forth by [[Max Weber]]. He has been influenced by [[American pragmatism]], [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]], and even [[poststructuralism]].

==Biography==
{{Frankfurt School}}

Habermas was born in [[Düsseldorf]], [[Rhine Province]], in 1929. He was born with a [[Cleft lip and cleft palate|cleft palate]] and had corrective surgery twice during childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1451092|title=Disabling Democracy: How Disability Reconfigures Deliberative Democratic Norms|first1=Clifford|last1=Simplican|first2=|last2=Stacy|date=28 October 2017|publisher=|accessdate=28 October 2017|via=papers.ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas argues that his speech disability made him think differently about the importance of deep dependence and of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jurgen. 2008. Between Naturalism and Religion: Philosophical Essays. (First chapter).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young teenager, he was profoundly affected by World War II. Until his graduation from [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], Habermas lived in [[Gummersbach]], near [[Cologne]]. His father, Ernst Habermas, was Executive director of the Cologne Chamber of Industry and Commerce, and was described by Habermas as a Nazi sympathizer. He was brought up in a staunchly Protestant milieu, his grandfather being the director of the seminary in Gummersbach. He studied at the universities of [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] (1949/50), [[University of Zurich|Zurich]] (1950/51), and [[University of Bonn|Bonn]] (1951–54) and earned a doctorate in philosophy from Bonn in 1954 with a dissertation written on the conflict between the absolute and history in Schelling's thought, entitled, ''{{lang|de|Das Absolute und die Geschichte. Von der Zwiespältigkeit in Schellings Denken}}'' ("The Absolute and History: On the Schism in [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling's]] Thought"). His dissertation committee included [[Erich Rothacker]] and [[Oskar Becker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.br/books/about/Das_Absolute_und_die_Geschichte.html?id=IOLWAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Das Absolute und die Geschichte: von der Zwiespältigkeit in Schellings Denken|first=Jurgen|last=Habermas |date=1954|publisher=Gummers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1956 on, he studied philosophy and sociology under the critical theorists [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Theodor Adorno]] at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt]]'s [[Institute for Social Research]], but because of a rift between the two over his [[dissertation]]—Horkheimer had made unacceptable demands for revision—as well as his own belief that the [[Frankfurt School]] had become paralyzed with political skepticism and disdain for modern culture&lt;ref name=cjc352&gt;Craig J. Calhoun, ''Contemporary Sociological Theory'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2002, p. 352. {{ISBN|0-631-21350-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;—he finished his ''[[habilitation]]'' in [[political science]] at the [[University of Marburg]] under the Marxist [[Wolfgang Abendroth]]. His ''habilitation'' work was entitled ''{{lang|de|Strukturwandel der Öffentlichkeit; Untersuchungen zu einer Kategorie der Bürgerlichen Gesellschaft}}'' (published in English translation in 1989 as ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]]: An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society''). It is a detailed social history of the development of the bourgeois public sphere from its origins in the 18th century salons up to its transformation through the influence of capital-driven mass media. In 1961 he became a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' in Marburg, and—in a move that was highly unusual for the German academic scene of that time—he was offered the position of "extraordinary professor" (professor without chair) of philosophy at the [[University of Heidelberg]] (at the instigation of [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] and [[Karl Löwith]]) in 1962, which he accepted. In this same year he gained his first serious public attention, in Germany, with the publication of his habilitation. In 1964, strongly supported by Adorno, Habermas returned to Frankfurt to take over Horkheimer's chair in philosophy and sociology. The philosopher [[Albrecht Wellmer]] was his assistant in Frankfurt from 1966 to 1970.

He accepted the position of Director of the [[Max Planck Institute#Former institutes|Max Planck Institute for the Study of the Scientific-Technical World]] in [[Starnberg]] (near [[Munich]]) in 1971, and worked there until 1983, two years after the publication of his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''[[The Theory of Communicative Action]]''. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1984.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780&amp;ndash;2010: Chapter H|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterH.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Habermas then returned to his chair at Frankfurt and the directorship of the Institute for Social Research. Since retiring from Frankfurt in 1993, Habermas has continued to publish extensively. In 1986, he received the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize]] of the {{lang|de|[[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]]}}, which is the highest honour awarded in German research. He also holds the position of "Permanent Visiting" Professor at [[Northwestern University]] in Evanston, Illinois, and "[[Theodor Heuss]] Professor" at [[The New School]], [[New York City|New York]].

Habermas was awarded The [[Prince of Asturias Award]] in Social Sciences of 2003. Habermas was also the 2004 Kyoto Laureate&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.mac.com/gedavis/JH/Kyoto_lecture_Nov_2004.pdf Public space and political public sphere] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204151440/http://homepage.mac.com/gedavis/JH/Kyoto_lecture_Nov_2004.pdf |date=2012-02-04 }} (pp. 2&amp;ndash;4).&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy|Arts and Philosophy]] section. He traveled to [[San Diego]] and on 5 March 2005, as part of the [[University of San Diego]]'s [[Kyoto Symposium]], gave a speech entitled ''The Public Role of Religion in Secular Context'', regarding the evolution of [[separation of church and state]] from neutrality to intense [[secularism]]. He received the 2005 [[Holberg International Memorial Prize]] (about €520,000). In 2007, Habermas was listed as the seventh most-cited author in the [[humanities]] (including the [[social science]]s) by ''[[The Times Higher Education Guide]]'', ahead of Max Weber and behind [[Erving Goffman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=405956&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=The most cited authors of books in the humanities |publisher=timeshighereducation.co.uk |date=2009-03-26 |accessdate=2009-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jürgen Habermas is the father of [[Rebekka Habermas]], historian of German social and cultural history and professor of modern history at the [[University of Göttingen]].

===Teacher and mentor===
Habermas is a famed teacher and mentor. Among his most prominent students were the pragmatic philosopher Herbert Schnädelbach (theorist of discourse distinction and rationality), the political sociologist [[Claus Offe]] (professor at the [[Hertie School of Governance]] in Berlin), the social philosopher Johann Arnason (professor at [[La Trobe University]] and chief editor of the journal ''[[Thesis Eleven]]''), the social philosopher Hans-Herbert Kögler (Chair of Philosophy at [[University of North Florida]]), the sociological theorist [[Hans Joas]] (professor at the [[University of Erfurt]] and at the [[University of Chicago]]), the theorist of societal [[evolution]] Klaus Eder, the social philosopher [[Axel Honneth]] (the current director of the Institute for Social Research), the political theorist David Rasmussen  (professor at [[Boston College]] and chief editor of the journal "[[Philosophy &amp; Social Criticism]]"), the environmental ethicist [[Konrad Ott]], the anarcho-capitalist philosopher [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]] (who came to reject much of Habermas's thought&lt;ref&gt;[[Lew Rockwell]], introduction to Hoppe's ''A Short History of Man'' (2015), Auburn, Mississippi: Mises Institute, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;), the American philosopher [[Thomas A. McCarthy|Thomas McCarthy]], the co-creator of mindful inquiry in social research [[Jeremy J. Shapiro]], and the assassinated Serbian prime minister [[Zoran Đinđić]].

==Philosophy and sociology==
Habermas has constructed a comprehensive framework of philosophy and social theory drawing on a number of intellectual traditions:&lt;ref name="Habermas, Jurgen 1981"&gt;Habermas, Jurgen (1981), ''Kleine Politische Schrifen I-IV'', pp. 500f.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[German philosophy|German philosophical thought]] of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Friedrich Schelling]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]], [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]]
* the [[Marxist philosophy|Marxian]] tradition—both the theory of [[Karl Marx]] himself as well as the critical [[Neo-Marxism|neo-Marxian]] theory of the [[Frankfurt School]], i.e. [[Max Horkheimer]], [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Herbert Marcuse]].&lt;ref name="Habermas, Jurgen 1981"/&gt;
* the sociological theories of [[Max Weber]], [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[George Herbert Mead]]
* the [[linguistic philosophy]] and [[speech act]] theories of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[J. L. Austin]], [[P. F. Strawson]], [[Stephen Toulmin]] and [[John Searle]]
* the developmental psychology of [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Lawrence Kohlberg]]
* the American pragmatist tradition of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[John Dewey]]
* the sociological [[social system|social systems theory]] of [[Talcott Parsons]] and [[Niklas Luhmann]]
* [[Neo-Kantian]] thought&lt;ref&gt;Müller-Doohm, Stefan. Jürgen Habermas. Frankfurt, Suhrkamp, 2008 (Suhrkamp BasisBiographie, 38).&lt;/ref&gt;

Jürgen Habermas considers his major contribution to be the development of the concept and theory of communicative reason or communicative rationality, which distinguishes itself from the [[rationalism|rationalist tradition]], by locating [[rationality]] in structures of interpersonal linguistic [[communication]] rather than in the structure of the [[cosmos]]. This social theory advances the goals of [[human emancipation]], while maintaining an inclusive [[universalist]] [[morality|moral]] framework. This framework rests on the argument called [[universal pragmatics]]—that all [[speech acts]] have an inherent [[Telos (philosophy)|telos]] (the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "purpose")—the goal of mutual [[understanding]], and that human beings possess the communicative competence to bring about such understanding. Habermas built the framework out of the [[speech-act]] philosophy of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[J. L. Austin]] and [[John Searle]], the sociological theory of the interactional constitution of mind and self of [[George Herbert Mead]], the [[moral development|theories of moral development]] of [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Lawrence Kohlberg]], and the [[discourse ethics]] of his Frankfurt colleague and fellow student [[Karl-Otto Apel]].

Habermas's works resonate within the traditions of Kant and [[the Enlightenment]] and of [[democratic socialism]] through his emphasis on the potential for transforming the world and arriving at a more humane, just, and egalitarian society through the realization of the human potential for reason, in part through discourse ethics. While Habermas has stated that the Enlightenment is an "unfinished project," he argues it should be corrected and complemented, not discarded.&lt;ref name=cjc351&gt;Calhoun (2002), p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt; In this he distances himself from the Frankfurt School, criticizing it, as well as much of [[postmodernist]] thought, for excessive pessimism, [[Political radicalism|radicalism]], and exaggerations.&lt;ref name=cjc351/&gt;

Within sociology, Habermas's major contribution was the development of a comprehensive theory of [[societal evolution]] and [[modernization]] focusing on the difference between communicative rationality and rationalization on one hand and [[strategic rationality|strategic]] / [[instrumental rationality]] and rationalization on the other. This includes a critique from a communicative standpoint of the differentiation-based [[theory]] of [[social system]]s developed by [[Niklas Luhmann]], a student of [[Talcott Parsons]].

His defence of modernity and [[civil society]] has been a source of inspiration to others, and is considered a major philosophical alternative to the varieties of poststructuralism. He has also offered an influential analysis of [[late capitalism]].

Habermas perceives the rationalization, [[humanism|humanization]] and [[democratization]] of society in terms of the [[institutionalization]] of the potential for rationality that is inherent in the [[communicative competence]] that is unique to the [[human species]]. Habermas contends that communicative competence has developed through the course of evolution, but in contemporary society it is often suppressed or weakened by the way in which major domains of social life, such as the [[Market (economics)|market]], the [[State (polity)|state]], and [[organization]]s, have been given over to or taken over by strategic/instrumental rationality, so that the logic of the system supplants that of the [[lifeworld]].

===Reconstructive science===
Habermas introduces the concept of "reconstructive science" with a double purpose: to place the "general theory of society" between philosophy and social science and re-establish the rift between the "great theorization" and the "empirical research".
The model of "[[rational reconstruction]]s" represents the main thread of the surveys about the "structures" of the world of life ("culture", "society" and "personality") and their respective "functions" (cultural reproductions, social integrations and socialization). For this purpose, the dialectics between "symbolic representation" of "the structures subordinated to all worlds of
life" ("internal relationships") and the "material reproduction" of the social systems in their complex ("external relationships" between social systems and environment) has to be considered.

This model finds an application, above all, in the "theory of the social evolution", starting from the reconstruction of the necessary conditions for a [[Phylogenetic tree|phylogeny]] of the socio-cultural life forms (the "hominization") until an analysis of the development of "social formations", which Habermas subdivides into primitive, traditional, modern and contemporary formations.
"This paper is an attempt, primarily, to formalize the model of "reconstruction of the logic of development" of "social formations" summed up by Habermas through the differentiation between vital world and social systems (and, within them, through the "rationalization of the world of life" and the "growth in complexity of the social systems"). Secondly, it tries to offer some methodological clarifications about the "explanation of the dynamics" of "historical processes" and, in particular, about the "theoretical meaning" of the evolutional theory's propositions.  Even if the German sociologist considers that the "ex-post rational reconstructions" and "the models system/environment" cannot have a complete "historiographical application", these certainly act as a general premise in the argumentative structure of the "historical explanation"".&lt;ref name="Corchia"&gt;{{citation | first = Luca | last = Corchia | chapter = Explicative models of complexity.

===The public sphere===
{{details|public sphere}}
In ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]],'' Habermas argues that prior to the 18th century, European culture had been dominated by a "representational" culture, where one party sought to "represent" itself on its audience by overwhelming its subjects.&lt;ref name=Blanning26&gt;Blanning, T. C. W. ''The French Revolution Class War or Culture Clash?'', New York: St. Martin's Press (1987), 2nd edition 1998, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of "representational" culture, Habermas argued that [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s [[Palace of Versailles]] was meant to show the greatness of the French state and its King by overpowering the senses of visitors to the Palace.&lt;ref name=Blanning26 /&gt; Habermas identifies "representational" culture as corresponding to the feudal stage of development according to Marxist theory, arguing that the coming of the capitalist stage of development marked the appearance of ''Öffentlichkeit'' (the public sphere).&lt;ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. pages 26-27"&gt;Blanning (1998), pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; In the culture characterized by ''Öffentlichkeit'', there occurred a public space outside of the control by the state, where individuals exchanged views and knowledge.&lt;ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. page 27"&gt;Blanning (1998), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Habermas's view, the growth in [[newspaper]]s, [[Literary magazine|journals]], reading clubs, [[Masonic lodge]]s, and [[coffeehouses]] in 18th-century Europe, all in different ways, marked the gradual replacement of "representational" culture with ''Öffentlichkeit'' culture.&lt;ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. page 27" /&gt; Habermas argued that the essential characteristic of the ''Öffentlichkeit'' culture was its "critical" nature.&lt;ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. page 27" /&gt; Unlike "representational" culture where only one party was active and the other passive, the ''Öffentlichkeit'' culture was characterized by a dialogue as individuals either met in conversation, or exchanged views via the print media.&lt;ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. page 27" /&gt; Habermas maintains that as Britain was the most liberal country in Europe, the culture of the public sphere emerged there first around 1700, and the growth of ''Öffentlichkeit'' culture took place over most of the 18th century in Continental Europe.&lt;ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. page 27" /&gt; In his view, the [[French Revolution]] was in large part caused by the collapse of "representational" culture, and its replacement by ''Öffentlichkeit'' culture.&lt;ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. page 27" /&gt; Though Habermas' main concern in ''The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere'' was to expose what he regarded as the deceptive nature of free institutions in the West, his book had a major effect on the historiography of the French Revolution.&lt;ref name="Blanning, T.C.W. pages 26-27" /&gt;

According to Habermas, a variety of factors resulted in the eventual decay of the public sphere, including the growth of a [[commerce|commercial]] [[mass media]], which turned the critical public into a passive consumer public; and the welfare state, which merged the state with society so thoroughly that the public sphere was squeezed out. It also turned the "public sphere" into a site of self-interested contestation for the resources of the state rather than a space for the development of a public-minded [[rational consensus]].

His most known work to date, the ''[[Theory of Communicative Action]]'' (1981), is based on an adaptation of Talcott Parsons [[AGIL Paradigm]]. In this work, Habermas voiced criticism of the process of modernization, which he saw as inflexible direction forced through by economic and administrative rationalization.&lt;ref name=cjc353&gt;Calhoun (2002), p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas outlined how our everyday lives are penetrated by formal systems as parallel to development of the [[welfare state]], [[corporate capitalism]] and [[mass consumption]].&lt;ref name=cjc353/&gt; These reinforcing trends rationalize public life.&lt;ref name=cjc353/&gt; Disfranchisement of citizens occurs as political parties and interest groups become rationalized and [[representative democracy]] replaces [[participatory democracy|participatory one]].&lt;ref name=cjc353/&gt; In consequence, boundaries between public and private, the individual and society, the [[Social system|system]] and the lifeworld are deteriorating.&lt;ref name=cjc353/&gt; Democratic public life cannot develop where matters of public importance are not discussed by citizens.&lt;ref name=cjc354&gt;Calhoun (2002), p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; An "[[ideal speech situation]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Democracy, Power and Legitimacy: The Critical Theory of Jürgen Habermas |last=Payrow Shabani |first=Omid A. |year=2003 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn= 0-8020-8761-2 |page=49 |url=https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN0802087612&amp;id=tKDU3l3cq60C&amp;pg=PA49}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires participants to have the same capacities of discourse, social equality and their words are not confused by ideology or other errors.&lt;ref name=cjc354/&gt; In this version of the [[consensus theory of truth]] Habermas maintains that truth is what would be agreed upon in an ideal speech situation.

Habermas has expressed optimism about the possibility of the revival of the public sphere.&lt;ref name=cjc355&gt;Calhoun (2002), p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt; He discerns a hope for the future where the representative democracy-reliant [[nation-state]] is replaced by a [[deliberative democracy]]-reliant political organism based on the equal rights and obligations of citizens.&lt;ref name=cjc355/&gt; In such a direct democracy-driven system, the activist public sphere is needed for debates on matters of public importance and as well as the mechanism for that discussion to affect the [[decision-making process]].

==== Criticism ====
Several noted academics have provided various criticisms of Habermas's notions regarding the public sphere. [[John Thompson (sociologist)|John B. Thompson]], a Professor of Sociology at the [[University of Cambridge]] and a fellow of ''The College of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Saint John the Evangelist and the glorious Virgin Saint Radegund, near Cambridge,'' also known as [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk/contacts/fellows/profiles/thompson.html|title=Jesus College website|author=|date=|website=cam.ac.uk|accessdate=28 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601125221/http://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk/contacts/fellows/profiles/thompson.html|archivedate=1 June 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has claimed that Habermas's notion of the public sphere is antiquated due to the proliferation of mass-media communications.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

[[Michael Schudson]] from the [[University of California, San Diego]] argues more generally that a public sphere as a place of purely rational independent [[debate]] never existed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

[[Nancy Fraser]], the Henry A. and Louise Loeb Professor of Political and Social Science and professor of philosophy at [[The New School]] in [[New York City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newschool.edu/nssr/faculty/?id=4e54-6b31-4d41-3d3d|title=Departments - The New School for Social Research (NSSR)|author=|date=|website=www.newschool.edu|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a noted feminist critic of Habermas' work on the public sphere, arguing for the existence of multiple spheres and counterpublics.

==Habermas versus postmodernists==
Habermas offered some early criticisms in an essay, "Modernity versus Postmodernity" (1981), which has achieved wide recognition. In that essay, Habermas raises the issue of whether, in light of the failures of the twentieth century, we "should try to hold on to the ''intentions of the Enlightenment'', feeble as they may be, or should we declare the entire project of modernity a lost cause?"&lt;ref name="Ritzer, George Pg. 567-568"&gt;Ritzer, George, ''Sociological Theory'', ''From Modern to Postmodern Social Theory (and Beyond)'', McGraw-Hill Higher Education, New York, New York, 2008, pp. 567&amp;ndash;568.&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas refuses to give up on the possibility of a rational, "scientific" understanding of the life-world.

Habermas has several main criticisms of [[postmodernism]]:

# The postmodernists are equivocal about whether they are producing serious theory or literature;
# Habermas feels that the postmodernists are animated by normative sentiments but the nature of those sentiments remains concealed from the reader;
# Habermas accuses postmodernism of a totalizing perspective that fails "to differentiate phenomena and practices that occur within modern society";&lt;ref name="Ritzer, George Pg. 567-568"/&gt;
# Habermas asserts that postmodernists ignore that which Habermas finds absolutely central – namely, everyday life and its practices.

==Key dialogues==

===''Historikerstreit'' (Historians' Quarrel)===
{{Main|Historikerstreit}}
Habermas is famous as a [[public intellectual]] as well as a scholar; most notably, in the 1980s he used the [[popular press]] to attack the German historians [[Ernst Nolte]], [[Michael Stürmer]], [[Klaus Hildebrand]] and [[Andreas Hillgruber]]. Habermas first expressed his views on the above-mentioned historians in the ''[[Die Zeit]]'' on 11 July 1986 in a ''[[feuilleton]]'' (a type of culture and arts opinion essay in German newspapers) entitled "A Kind of Settlement of Damages". Habermas criticized Nolte, Hildebrand, Stürmer and Hillgruber for "apologistic" history writing in regard to the Nazi era, and for seeking to "close Germany's opening to the West" that in Habermas's view had existed since 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen, "A Kind of Settlement of Damages On Apologetic Tendencies In German History Writing", pp. 34&amp;ndash;44 from ''Forever In the Shadow of Hitler?'' ed. Ernst Piper, Humanities Press, Atlantic Highlands, 1993, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Habermas argued that Ernst Nolte, Michael Stürmer, Klaus Hildebrand and Andreas Hillgruber had tried to detach Nazi rule and the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] from the mainstream of [[German history]], explain away Nazism as a reaction to [[Bolshevism]], and partially rehabilitate the reputation of the [[Wehrmacht]] (German Army) during [[World War II]]. Habermas wrote that Stürmer was trying to create a "vicarious religion" in German history which, together with the work of Hillgruber, glorifying the last days of the German Army on the Eastern Front, was intended to serve as a "kind of NATO philosophy colored with German nationalism".&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen "A Kind of Settlement of Damages" pp. 34&amp;ndash;44 from ''Forever In The Shadow of Hitler?'' ed. Piper (1993), pp. 42&amp;ndash;43.&lt;/ref&gt; About Hillgruber's statement that Hitler wanted to exterminate the Jews "because only such a 'racial revolution' could lend permanence to the world-power status of his ''Reich''", Habermas wrote: "Since Hillgruber does not use the verb in the subjunctive, one does not know whether the historian has adopted the perspective of the particulars this time too".&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen "A Kind of Settlement of Damages" pp. 34&amp;ndash;44 from ''Forever In The Shadow of Hitler?'' ed. Piper (1993), pp. 37&amp;ndash;38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Habermas wrote: "The unconditional opening of the Federal Republic to the political culture of the West is the greatest intellectual achievement of our postwar period; my generation should be especially proud of this. This event cannot and should not be stabilized by a kind of NATO philosophy colored with German nationalism. The opening of the Federal Republic has been achieved precisely by overcoming the ideology of Central Europe that our revisionists are trying to warm up for us with their geopolitical drumbeat about "the old geographically central position of the Germans in Europe" (Stürmer) and "the reconstruction of the destroyed European Center" (Hillgruber). The only patriotism that will not estrange us from the West is a constitutional patriotism."&lt;ref&gt;Habermas in Piper (1993) p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called ''Historikerstreit'' ("Historians' Quarrel") was not at all one-sided, because Habermas was himself attacked by scholars like [[Joachim Fest]],&lt;ref&gt;Fest, Joachim, "Encumbered Remembrance: The Controversy about the Incomparability of National-Socialist Mass Crimes", pp. 63&amp;ndash;71 &amp; "Postscript, April 21, 1987", pp. 264&amp;ndash;265 from ''Forever In The Shadow of Hitler?'' ed. Piper (1993), pp. 64&amp;ndash;65.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hagen Schulze]],&lt;ref&gt;Schulze, Hagen, "Questions We Have To Face: No Historical Stance without National Identity" pp. 93&amp;ndash;97 from ''Forever In The Shadow of Hitler?'' ed.

Piper (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, Habermas was supported by historians such as [[Martin Broszat]],&lt;ref&gt;Broszat, Martin, "Where the Roads Part: History Is Not A Suitable Substitute for a Religion of Nationalism", pp. 123&amp;ndash;129, ''Forever In The Shadow of Hitler?'' ed.

===Habermas and Derrida===
Habermas and [[Jacques Derrida]] engaged in a series of disputes beginning in the 1980s and culminating in a mutual understanding and friendship in the late 1990s that lasted until Derrida's death in 2004.&lt;ref name="Derrida, J. Pp. 300-306"&gt;{{Citation |last=Derrida |first=J |author-link=Jacques Derrida |title=Honesty of Thought |work=The Derrida-Habermas Reader |editor=Lasse Thomassen |place=Chicago Ill |publisher=[[The University of Chicago Press]] |year=2006 |page=302 |isbn=9780226796833}}&lt;/ref&gt; They originally came in contact when Habermas invited Derrida to speak at The University of Frankfurt in 1984. The next year Habermas published "Beyond a Temporalized Philosophy of Origins: Derrida" in ''[[The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity]]'' in which he described Derrida's method as being unable to provide a foundation for social critique.&lt;ref&gt;Thomassen, L. "Introduction: Between Deconstruction and Rational Reconstruction" in ''The Derrida-Habermas Reader'', ed. Thomassen (2006), pp. 1&amp;ndash;7. P.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida, citing Habermas as an example, remarked that, "those who have accused me of reducing philosophy to literature or logic to rhetoric ... have visibly and carefully avoided reading me".&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, J., "Is There a Philosophical Language?" in ''The Derrida-Habermas Reader'', ed. Thomassen (2006), pp. 35&amp;ndash;45. P.37.&lt;/ref&gt; After Derrida's final rebuttal in 1989 the two philosophers did not continue, but, as Derrida described it, groups in the academy "conducted a kind of 'war', in which we ourselves never took part, either personally or directly".&lt;ref name="Derrida, J. Pp. 300-306"/&gt;

At the end of the 1990s, Habermas approached Derrida at a party held at an American university where both were lecturing. They then met at Paris over dinner, and participated afterwards in many joint projects. In 2000 they held a joint seminar on problems of philosophy, right, ethics, and politics at the University of Frankfurt.&lt;ref name="Derrida, J. Pp. 300-306"/&gt; In December 2000, in Paris, Habermas gave a lecture entitled "How to answer the ethical question?" at the ''Judeities. Questions for Jacques Derrida'' conference organized by Joseph Cohen and Raphael Zagury-Orly. Following the lecture by Habermas, both thinkers engaged in a very heated debate on Heidegger and the possibility of Ethics. The conference volume was published at the Editions Galilée (Paris) in 2002, and subsequently in English at Fordham University Press (2007).

In the aftermath of [[September 11, 2001 attacks|the September 11 attacks]], Derrida and Habermas laid out their individual opinions on 9/11 and the [[War on Terror]] in [[Giovanna Borradori]]'s ''Philosophy in a Time of Terror: Dialogues with Jürgen Habermas and Jacques Derrida''. In early 2003, both Habermas and Derrida were very active in opposing the coming [[Iraq War]]; in a manifesto that later became the book ''[[Old Europe, New Europe, Core Europe]]'', the two called for a tighter unification of the states of the [[European Union]] in order to create a power capable of opposing American foreign policy. Derrida wrote a foreword expressing his unqualified subscription to Habermas's declaration of February 2003 ("February 15, or, What Binds Europeans Together: Plea for a Common Foreign Policy, Beginning in Core Europe") in the book, which was a reaction to the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]]'s demands upon European nations for support in the coming Iraq War.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, J. and Derrida, J. "February 15, Or What Binds Europeans Together: A Plea for a Common Foreign Policy, beginning in the Core of Europe" in ''The Derrida-Habermas Reader'', ed. Thomassen (2006), pp. 270&amp;ndash;277. P. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas has offered further context for this declaration in an interview.

=== Religious dialogue ===
Habermas' attitudes toward religion have changed throughout the years. Analyst Phillippe Portier identifies three phases in Habermas' attitude towards this social sphere: the first, in the decade of 1980, when the younger Jürgen, in the spirit of Marx, argued against religion seeing it as an "alienating reality" and "control tool"; the second phase, from the mid-1980s to the beginning of the 21st Century, when he stopped discussing it and, as a secular commentator, relegated it to matters of private life; and the third, from then until now, when Habermas has recognized the positive social role of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Sánchez, Rosalía. 2011. ''[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2011/10/07/cultura/1317980044.html 'San' Jürgen Habermas]''. [[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]. Access date: January 10, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview in 1999 Habermas had stated:

{{quote|For the normative self-understanding of modernity, [[Christianity]] has functioned as more than just a precursor or catalyst. Universalistic [[egalitarianism]], from which sprang the ideals of freedom and a collective life in solidarity, the autonomous conduct of life and emancipation, the individual morality of conscience, human rights and democracy, is the direct legacy of the Judaic ethic of justice and the Christian ethic of love. This legacy, substantially unchanged, has been the object of a continual critical reappropriation and reinterpretation. Up to this very day there is no alternative to it. And in light of the current challenges of a post-national constellation, we must draw sustenance now, as in the past, from this substance. Everything else is idle postmodern talk.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jurgen, ''Religion and Rationality: Essays on Reason, God, and Modernity'', ed. Eduardo Mendieta, MIT Press, 2002, p. 149.

The original German (from the Habermas Forum website) of the disputed quotation is, 

{{quote|''as Christentum ist für das normative Selbstverständnis der Moderne nicht nur eine Vorläufergestalt oder ein Katalysator gewesen. Der egalitäre Universalismus, aus dem die Ideen von Freiheit und solidarischem Zusammenleben, von autonomer Lebensführung und Emanzipation, von individueller Gewissensmoral, Menschenrechten und Demokratie entsprungen sind, ist unmittelbar ein Erbe der jüdischen Gerechtigkeits- und der christlichen Liebesethik. In der Substanz unverändert, ist dieses Erbe immer wieder kritisch angeeignet und neu interpretiert worden. Dazu gibt es bis heute keine Alternative. Auch angesichts der aktuellen Herausforderungen einer postnationalen Konstellation zehren wir nach wie vor von dieser Substanz. Alles andere ist postmodernes Gerede.''|From Jürgen Habermas - "Zeit der Übergänge" (Suhrkamp Verlag, 2001) p.&amp;nbsp;174f.}}

This statement has been misquoted in a number of articles and books, where Habermas instead is quoted for saying: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Christianity, and nothing else, is the ultimate foundation of liberty, conscience, human rights, and democracy, the benchmarks of Western civilization. To this day, we have no other options. We continue to nourish ourselves from this source. Everything else is postmodern chatter.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose Ih-Ren Mong. ''Dialogue Derailed: Joseph Ratzinger's War against Pluralist Theology''. Wipf and Stock Publishers. p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his book ''Zwischen Naturalismus und Religion'' (Between Naturalism and Religion, 2005), Habermas stated that the forces of religious strength, as a result of multiculturalism and immigration, are stronger than in previous decades, and, therefore, there is a need of tolerance which must be understood as a two-way street: [[secular]] people need to [[tolerate]] the role of religious people in the public square and vice versa;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.resetdoc.org/EN/Habermas-Istanbul.php A “post-secular” society – what does that mean?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329090452/http://www.resetdoc.org/EN/Habermas-Istanbul.php |date=2009-03-29 }} by Jurgen Habermas, June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Javier |last=Espinosa. |url=http://www.uclm.es/actividades0304/seminarios/spinoza/pdf/cuadernos/22.pdf |title=The religion in the public sphere.

In early 2007, [[Ignatius Press]] published a dialogue between Habermas and the then [[Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] of the [[Holy Office]] [[Joseph Ratzinger]] (elected as [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2005), entitled ''[[The Dialectics of Secularization]]''. The dialogue took place on January 14, 2004 after an invitation to both thinkers by the [[Catholic Academy of Bavaria]] in Munich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ERzoAPsS9usC&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;ots=uxJYtSd7Bi&amp;dq=the+Dialectics+of+Secularization&amp;lr&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=the+Dialectics+of+Secularization&amp;f=false|title=Dialectics of Secularization: On Reason and Religion|first1=Benedikt XVI|last1=(Papst)|first2=Jürgen|last2=Habermas|date=28 October 2017|publisher=Ignatius Press|accessdate=28 October 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; It addressed contemporary questions such as:
* Is a public culture of [[reason]] and ordered [[liberty]] possible in our [[Post-metaphysical philosophy|post-metaphysical]] age?
* Is philosophy permanently cut adrift from its grounding in [[being]] and [[anthropology]]?
* Does this decline of rationality signal an opportunity or a deep crisis for [[religion]] itself?

In this debate a shift of Habermas became evident—in particular, his rethinking of the public role of religion. Habermas stated that he wrote as a "methodological atheist," which means that when doing philosophy or social science, he presumed nothing about particular religious beliefs. Yet while writing from this perspective his evolving position towards the role of religion in society led him to some challenging questions, and as a result conceding some ground in his dialogue with the future Pope, that would seem to have consequences which further complicated the positions he holds about a communicative rational solution to the problems of modernity. Habermas believes that even for self-identified [[Liberalism|liberal]] thinkers, ''"to exclude religious voices from the public square is highly [[illiberal democracy|illiberal]]."&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Rodney. 2014. ''[http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/12/tis_the_season_to_reveal_what_atheists_really_want.html#ixzz3OPTyHKel Tis the Season to Reveal What Atheists Really Want]''. AmericanThinker. Access date: January 10, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Though, in the first period of his career, he began as a skeptic of any social usefulness of religion, he now believes there is a social role and utilitarian [[moral]] strength in religion, and notably, that there is a necessity of [[Judeochristian]] ethics in culture.&lt;ref&gt;ForumLibertas.com. 2006. ''[http://www.forumlibertas.com/frontend/forumlibertas/noticia.php?id_noticia=6908 Jürgen Habermas, pensador icono de la izquierda, reivindica el valor de la religión]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Habermas has popularized the concept of "[[Postsecularism|post-secular]]" society, to refer to current times in which the idea of modernity is perceived as unsuccessful and at times, morally failed, so that, rather than a stratification or separation, a new peaceful dialogue and coexistence between faith and reason must be sought in order to learn mutually.&lt;ref&gt;Buston, Fernando del. 2014. ''El Estado debe proteger a la religión''. El Comercio. Date access: January 10, 2015: ''"Jürgen Habermas ha acuñado el término de postsecularidad. Se da por fallida la idea central de la modernidad de que la religión iba a desaparecer y se establece una nueva relación entre razón y religión. Habermas plantea que es necesario emprender un aprendizaje mutuo entre las sociedades modernas y las creencias, o entre razón secular y fe. Se inicia una nueva época de mutuas tolerancias. La razón no puede echar por la borda el potencial de sentido de las religiones y éstas deben traducir sus contenidos racionalmente."''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socialist dialogue===
Habermas has sided with other 20th century commentators on Marx such as [[Hannah Arendt]] who have indicated concerns with the limits of totalitarian perspectives often associated with Marx's apparent over-estimation of the emancipatory potential of the forces of production. Arendt had presented this in her book ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' and Habermas extends this critique in his writings on functional reductionism in the life-world in his ''[[The Theory of Communicative Action|Lifeworld and System: A Critique of Functionalist Reason]]''. As Habermas states: 

&lt;blockquote&gt; ... traditional Marxist analysis ... today, when we use the means of the critique of political economy ... can no longer make clear predictions: for that, one would still have to assume the autonomy of a self-reproducing economic system. I do not believe in such an autonomy. Precisely for this reason, the laws governing the economic system are no longer identical to the ones Marx analyzed. Of course, this does not mean that it would be wrong to analyze the mechanism which drives the economic system; but in order for the orthodox version of such an analysis to be valid, the influence of the political system would have to be ignored.&lt;ref name="Habermas, Jurgen 1981"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4630">'''Louis René Bréhier''' ({{IPA-fr|bʁeje|lang}}; August 5, 1868, [[Brest, France|Brest]] – October 13, 1951, [[Reims]]) was a French [[historian]] who specialized in [[Byzantine studies]]. The philosopher [[Émile Bréhier]] was his brother.

==Biography==
He studied history and literature in [[Paris]], obtaining his agrégation in history in 1892. Afterwards, he worked as a schoolteacher in [[Montauban]], [[Bourges]], Reims and [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|Saint-Quentin]] (1892–99). In 1899 he received his doctorate at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] with the [[dissertation]] ''Le schisme oriental du XI&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècle'' ("The [[Eastern Schism]] in the 11th Century").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/schisme-oriental-du-xie-siecle/oclc/409452559?referer=di&amp;ht=edition WorldCat Title] Le schisme oriental du XIe siècle&lt;/ref&gt; From 1903 to 1938 he was professor of [[ancient history|ancient]] and [[medieval|medieval history]] in [[Clermont-Ferrand]]. His travels were largely confined to the Mediterranean world that included an archaeological mission to [[Mount Athos]] in 1930. He settled in Reims after World War II and died in this city in 1951.&lt;ref name=SI&gt;[http://www.inha.fr/fr/ressources/publications/dictionnaire-critique-des-historiens-de-l-art/brehier-louis.html Institut national d'histoire de l'art] biography&lt;/ref&gt;

Bréhier's best known work was the three-volume ''Le Monde byzantin'' ("The Byzantine World"). He was a specialist of Byzantine [[iconography]], and in 1924 published an influential treatise on [[Byzantine art]] titled ''L'Art byzantin''. In 1935 he became a member of the [[Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres]].&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;

'''MIDAS Heritage''' ''– the UK Historic Environment Data Standard'' is a British [[cultural heritage]] standard for recording information on buildings, archaeological sites, shipwrecks, parks and gardens, battlefields, areas of interest and artefacts.&lt;ref&gt;Association of Local Government Archaeological Officers UK (ALGAO). Data Standards.  {{cite web|url=http://www.algao.org.uk/Cttees/HERs/HERStandards.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820014333/http://www.algao.org.uk/Cttees/HERs/HERStandards.htm |archivedate=2008-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The data standard suggests the minimum level of information needed for recording heritage assets and covers the procedures involved in understanding, protecting and managing these assets. It also provides guidelines on how to support effective sharing of knowledge, [[data retrieval]] and long-term preservation of data.&lt;ref&gt;English Heritage (2007): MIDAS Heritage – The UK Historic Environment Data Standard. (Best practice guidelines). http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/midas-heritage/midasheritagepartone.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

''MIDAS Heritage'' is freely available to anyone interested in recording historic environment information. It is used by national government organisations, local authorities, heritage sector organisations, amenity groups and societies, the research community and professional contractors.&lt;ref&gt;English Heritage (2007): MIDAS Heritage – The UK Historic Environment Data Standard. (Best practice guidelines). http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/midas-heritage/midasheritagepartone.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first edition of the standard, ''MIDAS – A Manual and Data Standard for Monument Inventories'', was published by the ''[[Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England]]'' &lt;ref&gt;Lee, E., (ed), MIDAS - A Manual and Data Standard for Monument Inventories. The Royal Commission on Historical Monuments of England. Swindon (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; (RCHME) in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;the Data Hub – The easy way to get, use and share data. (MIDAS – Heritage project) http://ckan.net/dataset/midas-heritage&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation merged with ''[[English Heritage]]'' in 1999 and the updated version, ''MIDAS Heritage'', was published in 2007 in collaboration with other UK heritage organisations. The standard was developed by the ''Forum on Information Standards in Heritage'' (FISH), a discussion forum aimed at helping to resolve standards and recording issues for the whole of the heritage sector.&lt;ref&gt;Forum on Information Standards in Heritage http://www.fish-forum.info/{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Forum on Information Standards in Heritage http://www.fish-forum.info/{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A revised version, with more explicit compliance statements, was released in 2012 &lt;https://content.historicengland.org.uk/images-books/publications/midas-heritage/midas-heritage-2012-v1_1.pdf/&gt;

==Coverage==
''MIDAS Heritage'' is a set of closely integrated data standards, rather than one single standard.  It is designed to be used in conjunction with separate standards covering specific types of applications or projects, which will give the necessary [[data element]]s.&lt;ref&gt;English Heritage (2007): MIDAS Heritage – The UK Historic Environment Data Standard. (Best practice guidelines). http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/midas-heritage/midasheritagepartone.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include ''SPECTRUM'' (artefacts), ''UK Gemini Discovery Metadata Standard'' (GIS), ''[[CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model]]'' (concepts and relationships),&lt;ref&gt;International Organization for Standardization. ISO 21127:2006 http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=34424&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Informing the Future of the Past: Guidelines for Historic Environment Records’’.&lt;ref&gt;Gilman, P; Newman, M. (2007): “Informing the Future of the Past: Guidelines for Historic Environment Records”. 2nd edition.  http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/ifp/ &lt;/ref&gt; MIDAS Heritage complies with the UK e-Government Metadata Standard ([[e-GMS]]),&lt;ref&gt;esd standards, e-GMS-e-Government Metadata Standard, Version 3.0, {{cite web|url=http://www.esd.org.uk/standards/egms/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118112837/http://www.esd.org.uk/standards/egms/ |archivedate=2011-11-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on [[Dublin Core]].&lt;ref&gt;English Heritage (2007): MIDAS Heritage – The UK Historic Environment Data Standard.

The standard aims only to provide a common information framework and does not cover: what software or file format to use; what to call fields and tables in a database and how they are designed; what indexing terms to use; how to record archives and museum collections, or how to redesign an existing information system.&lt;ref&gt;English Heritage (2007): MIDAS Heritage – The UK Historic Environment Data Standard.

A '''millennium''' (plural '''millennia''' or '''millenniums''') is a period equal to [[1000 (number)|1000]] [[year]]s,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/millennium millennium]", ''Oxford Dictionaries'' (Oxford University Press, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; also called kiloyears. It derives from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|mille}}'', thousand, and ''{{lang|la|annus}}'', year. It is often, but not always, related to a particular [[calendar|dating system]].

Sometimes, it is used specifically for periods of a thousand years that begin at the starting point (initial reference point) of the calendar in consideration (typically the year "1"), or in later years that are whole number multiples of a thousand years after it. The term can also refer to an interval of time beginning on any date. Frequently in the latter case (and sometimes also in the former) it may have religious or theological implications (see [[millenarianism]]).

==Counting years==
There are two methods of counting years: current years (the count begins at the epoch) and elapsed years (the count is of completed years since the epoch).

The original method of counting years was [[ordinal number|ordinal]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} whether ''1st year [[AD]]'' or [[regnal year|regnal]] ''10th year of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]''. This ordinal numbering is still used in the names of the millennia and centuries, for example the ''1st millennium'' or the ''10th century'', and sometimes in the names of decades, e.g., ''1st decade of the 11th century''.

The main issues arise from the ''content'' of the various year ranges. Similar issues affect the ''contents'' of centuries. Decades are not subject to ambiguity, as they are named according to their leading numbers: the decade called the 1990s by its naming does not include 2000.

Those following ordinal year names naturally choose
* 2001–2100 (inclusive) as the current century
* 2001–3000 (inclusive) as the current millennium
Those who are influenced by the leading digit equally naturally choose
* 2000–2099 (inclusive) as the current century
* 2000–2999 (inclusive) as the current millennium

==Debate over millennium celebrations==
There are two viewpoints about how millennia should be thought of in practice. One viewpoint relies on the formal operation of the calendar, while the other appeals to [[Popular culture|popular culture]]. [[Stephen Jay Gould]] argued that the choice is arbitrary, and since the question revolves around rules made by people, rather than a natural phenomenon that is subject to experimental measurement, the matter cannot be resolved.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Stephen Jay, ''Questioning the Millennium'' (New York: Harmony Books, 1997), part 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ISO 8601]], employed in [[ISO 8601 usage|a number of contexts]], uses the [[Astronomical year numbering|astronomical calendar]], in which year counting starts at 0. Thus, when using this calendar, the millennium starts at x000 and ends at x999. There was a popular debate leading up to the [[Millennium celebrations|celebrations of the year 2000]] as to whether the beginning of that year should be understood (and celebrated) as the beginning of a new millennium. Historically, there has been debate around the turn of previous decades, centuries, and millennia.

The issue is tied to the convention of using [[ordinal number]]s to count millennia (as in "the third millennium"), as opposed to "the two thousands", which is unambiguous as it does not depend on which year counting starts. The first convention is common in English speaking countries, but the latter is favored in for example Sweden (''tvåtusentalet'', which translates literally as the ''two thousands period'').

===Viewpoint 1: X001–Y000===
Those holding that the arrival of the new millennium should be celebrated in the transition from 2000 to 2001 (i.e., December 31, 2000 to January 1, 2001), argued that because the Gregorian calendar has no year zero, the millennia should be counted from 1 AD. Thus the first period of one thousand complete years runs from the beginning of 1 AD to the end of 1000 AD, and the beginning of the second millennium took place at the beginning of 1001.

[[Arthur C. Clarke]] gave this [[analogy]] (from a statement received by [[Reuters]]): "If the scale on your grocer's weighing machine began at 1 instead of 0, would you be happy when he claimed he'd sold you 10 kg of tea?" This statement illustrates the common confusion about the calendar.

If one counts from the beginning of AD 1 to the ending of AD 1000, one would have counted 1000&amp;nbsp;years. The next 1000&amp;nbsp;years (millennium) would begin on the first day of 1001. So the calendar has not 'cheated' anyone out of a year. Clarke made reference to this viewpoint in his book ''[[3001: The Final Odyssey]]'' referring to the Millennium Celebrations on December 31, 2000. In other words, the argument is based on the fact that the last year of the first two thousand years in the Gregorian calendar was 2000, not 1999.

===Viewpoint 2: X000–X999===
The "year 2000" has also been a popular phrase referring to an often [[utopia]]n future, or a year when stories in such a future were set, adding to its cultural significance. There was also media and public interest in the [[Y2K bug]]. People liked to compared their [[Odometer|odometer]] as a reason to celebrate the new millennium which goes from 1999 to 2000. Thus, the populist argument was that the new millennium should begin when the zeroes "rolled over" to 2000, i.e., the day after December 31, 1999. People&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermetic.ch/cal_stud/newmill.htm "When Does the New Millennium Begin?"] January 1, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; felt that the change of the hundreds digit in the year number, and the zeros rolling over, created a sense that a new century had begun.

This is similar to the common demarcation of decades by their most significant digits, e.g., naming the period 1980 to 1989 as the 1980s or "the eighties". Similarly, it would be valid to celebrate the year 2000 as a cultural event in its own right, and name the period 2000 to 2999 would be "the 2000s". In other words, the time period between 1 and 999 (999 years only) would be called the "0s" and the period between 1000 and 1999 would be the "1000s".

===Popular approach===
The popular&lt;ref name=AP&gt;Associated Press, [http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/01/news/mn-7177 "Y2K It Wasn't, but It Was a Party"], ''Los Angeles Times'', January 1, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; approach was to treat the end of 1999 as the end of a millennium and to hold millennium celebrations at midnight between December 31, 1999 and January 1, 2000, as per viewpoint 2. The cultural and psychological significance of the events listed above combined to cause celebrations to be observed one year earlier than the formal Gregorian date.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; This does not establish that insistence on the formal Gregorian date is "incorrect", though some view it as pedantic.

Some event organisers hedged their bets by calling their 1999 celebrations things like "Click" referring to the [[odometer]]-like rolling over of the nines to zeros. A second approach was to adopt two different views on the millennium problem and celebrate the new millennium twice.

[[Stephen Jay Gould]], in his essay ''Dousing Diminutive Dennis' Debate (or DDDD = 2000)'' (''[[Dinosaur in a Haystack]]''), discussed the "high" versus "pop" culture interpretation of the transition. Gould noted that the high culture, strict construction had been the dominant viewpoint at the 20th century's beginning, but that the pop culture viewpoint dominated at its end. Gould also included comments on adjustments to the calendar, such as those by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] (the eponymous "Diminutive Dennis") and the timing of celebrations over different transitional periods. Further of his essays on this topic are collected in ''Questioning the Millennium: A Rationalist's Guide to a Precisely Arbitrary Countdown''.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Adontz was born Nikoghayos Ter-Avetikyan ({{Lang-hy|Նիկողայոս Տեր-Ավետիքյան}}) in the village of [[Brnakot]] in [[Sisian]], which was then part of the Zangezur ''[[uezd]]'' of the [[Elisabethpol Governorate]] (modern [[Syunik Province|Syunik]]). His family traced its roots to an eighteenth-century Armenian military figure and close ally of [[David Bek]] named Ter-Avetik.&lt;ref name="PBH"&gt;{{hy icon}} Yuzbashyan, Karen. "Նիկողայոս Ադոնցի գիտական ժառանգությունը" ("The Intellectual Legacy of Nikoghayos Adonts"). ''[[Patma-Banasirakan Handes]]'', № 4 (19), 1962, pp. 115-128.&lt;/ref&gt;  He graduated from a parochial school in [[Tatev]] and later studied at the [[Gevorkian Theological Seminary]] in [[Echmiadzin]] and the Russian ''[[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]'' in [[Tbilisi]] (1892–1894).&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt;

Adontz was accepted to the [[University of St. Petersburg]] and studied at the Departments of Oriental languages and History and Philology under the general direction of the renowned historian and linguist, [[Nicholas Marr]]. He learned Latin and Greek and graduated with honors in 1899. Following this, Adontz went along with Marr to Europe (Munich, Paris, London and Vienna) and the two worked together in the area of Byzantine studies until 1901.&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt; In 1903, Adontz returned to the Caucasus, learning [[Georgian (language)|Georgian]] and later working at the manuscript repository in Echmiadzin.&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt;

===Graduate studies===
Adontz wrote and defended his [[thesis]] on "Armenia in the Period of Justinian" in 1908. Adontz was appointed as the private-assistant professor at the University of St. Petersburg in 1909. He received his Ph.D and the title of professor after defending his dissertation, which was entitled "Dionysius of Thrace and his Armenian Commentaries," in 1916. In that same year, with archaeologist [[Ashkharbek Kalantar]], he participated in the second [[Van, Turkey|Van]] archaeological expedition organized by [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences]]. One year later, he was appointed honorary trustee and professor at the [[Lazarev Institute of Oriental Languages]] in Moscow.&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt;

===Later life===
In 1920, Adontz left Russia and moved to London and then Paris. Adontz was invited to deliver lectures at the [[University of Brussels]] in 1930 and was appointed to the position of the head of the newly organized Department of Armenian Studies. During the Second World War, Belgium was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] and after Adontz and the other professors refused their orders to work at another institute, the University of Brussels was shut down. Left with no salary, Adontz willed his work to Belgium's small Armenian community and died shortly thereafter in [[Brussels]] on January 27, 1942.&lt;ref name="PBH"/&gt;

==Academic work==
Adontz left more than 80 monographs on the history and literature of Medieval Armenia, Armenian-Byzantine relations, Armenian-Greek philology, mythology, religion, linguistics in the Armenian, Russian and French languages.&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PBH"/&gt; He published his first scholarly article in the journal ''[[Handes Amsorya]]'' in 1901. Some of his other notable works include ''The Peasantry of Ancient Armenia'', ''The Art of Dionysius Grammarian and his Armenian Interpretations'', and ''Political Parties in Ancient Armenia''. His ''Armenia in the Period of Justinian'' (under the full Russian title of ''Армения в эпоху Юстиниана: Политическое состояние на основе Нахарского строя''), based on his dissertation, however, is considered to be one of the "most important achievements in Armenian studies of the 20th century."&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt; In 1970, his work was published in English by Byzantine historian Nina G. Garsoïan. In another notable work, ''[[Mesrob Mashtots|Mashtots]] and his Students According to Foreign Sources'', Adontz placed the date of the creation of the [[Armenian alphabet]] by its founder, [[Mesrob Mashtots]], to the years 382&amp;ndash;392 A.D., approximately 20 years prior to the traditional given date (405).&lt;ref name="SAE"/&gt;

In a stark departure from his studies on ancient and medieval Armenian history, Adontz took a vested interest in the history of the [[Armenian Question]] in the immediate years following the end of the First World War and published a number of works.&lt;ref name="Diloyan"&gt;{{hy icon}} Diloyan, Valter. ''«Ադոնց, Նիկողայոս»'' (Adontz, Nikoghayos). [[Armenian Encyclopedia|Encyclopedia of the Armenian Question]]. Yerevan: Yerevan State University Press, 1996, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; These included two books published in English in 1918, '' Historical Basis of the Armenian Question and the Fall of Turkey'' and ''The Dismemberment of Turkey''; two works published in Russian in the same year, ''Turkey's Note and Western Armenia'' and ''The Armenian Question and German Plans''; and ''The Armenian Question at [[Treaty of Sèvres|Sèvres]]'', which was published in English in 1920.&lt;ref name="Diloyan"/&gt; He charged Western Europe for taking advantage of the Armenians' plight in the Ottoman Empire in order to increase their own influence in the region. Adontz also condemned [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] for signing the [[Treaty of Brest Litovsk]], which effectively left Western Armenia within the borders of the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="Diloyan"/&gt;

'''Nil Alexandrovich Popov''' ({{lang-ru|Нил Александрович Попов}}, 9 April 1844 – 3 January 1892) was a Russian [[historian]], [[slavist]], [[philologist]] and [[archivist]], a major authority on the history of [[West Slavs]]. A professor at [[Moscow University]] (where he was the head of the History and Philology faculty in 1873-1885 and was awarded the title of the Meritorious professor in 1882), and a corresponding member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences]] (1883, onwards), Popov published numerous acclaimed works on the history of [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[Poland]]. His doctorate study, "Russia and Serbia. 1806-1856" earned him the Uvarov Prize. In 1864 Popov became the head of the Moscow Slavic Committee (which later changed its name to the Slavic Charity Organization). He was also the head of the Archive Committee of the Ministry of Justice and the chairman of the ethnography department at the [[Society of Devotees of Natural Science, Anthropology, and Ethnography]]. Professor [[Vasily Klyuchevsky]] described Popov as "one of the last major figures from the Golden age of Moscow University."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rulex.ru/01160478.htm Нил Александрович Попов] at the Russian Biographical Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;И.Г.

'''Ocotlán de Morelos''' is a town and [[Municipalities of Mexico|municipality]] in the state of [[Oaxaca]], about 35&amp;nbsp;km south of the center of the city of [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca]] along Highway 175.

The name Ocotlan is from [[Nahuatl]] and means "among the [[ocote]] trees" with the appendage "de Morelos" added in honor of [[José María Morelos y Pavón]]. During the colonial period the area was known as Santo Domingo Ocotlán due to the Dominican friars who created a monastery here dedicated to [[Saint Dominic]]. The [[Zapotec languages|Zapotec]] name for the area is "Lachiroo" which means "large valley" although some Zapotecs in the [[Tlacolula de Matamoros|Tlacolula]] area called it "Guelache" which means "plaza of the valley".&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:HallOcotlanLibrary.JPG|thumb|left|Hall on upper level of the former monastery]]
The ethnicity of the first populations of this area is not known, but one of the earliest settlements is a site called Tortolita, located two km from the modern town center.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt; When the Spanish arrived, the settlement had about 2,000 inhabitants, which is why the monastery was eventually founded here.&lt;ref name="redes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://redesdelconocimiento.com/foro/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;catid=42:valles-centrales&amp;id=191:ocotlan-de-morelos&amp;Itemid=109&amp;lang=es |title= Ocotlan de Morelos |year=2008  |work= Redes del Conocimiento  |publisher= Redes del Conocimiento y Redes Educativas |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=April 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1538, the bishopric sent Dominicans to found a parish. The monastery was founded in 1555 and called Santo Domingo de Ocotlán. The official founding of the town by Diego Hernandez Domingo Luis and Juan Vazquez also occurred in 1555.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt; The complex was never finished because the local people also worked in the mines established nearby.&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt;
By the 18th century, Octolan has eight small neighborhoods including one called Santa María Tocuela (the oldest) and San Juan Chilatece in which the market was founded.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="puso"/&gt;

During the Mexican War of Independence, Morelos camped here for three days on his way to Acapulco. Ocotlan was officially declared a town in 1875.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;

In 1916, forces loyal to [[Venustiano Carranza]] successfully defended the town from an attack led by General Macario Hernandez.  Ocotlan was officially declared a city in 1926.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;

Since the [[Mexican Revolution]], the city has been mostly quiet but the current construction of a superhighway linking the city of Oaxaca has been bringing changes to the area. The road called Camino Real a San Juan was recently paved, and event that drew the attendance of the governor of Oaxaca. Other newly paved roads include Calle Industria, Calle Francisco Villa and Calle Ayuntamiento. The new paving is meant to relieve traffic congestion on the roads to [[Ejutla de Crespo]] and the city of Oaxaca by providing alternate routes for current and future traffic.&lt;ref name="puso"/&gt;

[[2006 Oaxaca protests|In 2006, the social uprisings that affected much of Oaxaca]] affected Ocotlán. Much of the social unrest centered around the mines that are located in the municipality and consequences continue to this day. A mining labor leader from the area, Napolean Gomez Urrutia, living in Vancouver, is seeking asylum in Canada after the Mexican government asked for his extradition. He is accused of fraud, criminal associated and other offences associated with the social uprisings. Before he left for Canada, Gomez Urrutia was demanding an investigation into the deaths of 65 workers at a coal mine in the area.&lt;ref name="mines"&gt;{{cite news |title= Mexico seeks extradition of exiled labour leader |first=Marina |last=Jimenez |url= http://www.minesandcommunities.org/article.php?a=9061 |newspaper= Toronto Globe and Mail |location=Toronto |date=February 6, 2009 |accessdate=April 8, 2010 |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, protesters from several communities in the municipality blocked a highway to demand the cancellation of an arrest warrant against residents who opposed the operation of a mine and demand talks to close the La Trinidad mine. The mine belongs to a Mexican-Canadian company called Cuxcatlan. Protesters claim the mine is polluting their lands. The protesters were supported by Section 22 of the SNTE and [[APPO]].&lt;ref name="protestan"&gt;{{cite news |title= Protestan pobladores contra instalación de mina en Oaxaca |url= http://www.cminoticiasoaxaca.com/Desarrollo/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=1%3Anoticias&amp;id=3091%3Aprotestan-pobladores-contra-instalacion-de-mina-en-oaxaca&amp;option=com_content |agency=CMI Noticias |newspaper=CMI Noticias |location=Mexico |date=June 18, 2009 |accessdate=April 8, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Residents protest against mine installation in Oaxaca }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cerrar"&gt;{{cite news |title= Demandan cerrar mina en Oaxaca |first= Octavio |last= Vélez Ascencio |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2009/06/18/index.php?section=estados&amp;article=031n2est |newspaper=La Jornada |location=Mexico City |date=June 19, 2009 |page=31 |accessdate=April 8, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Demanding closure of mine in Oaxaca }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unrelated controversy in 2008 involved child pornography charges against the Colegio Guadalupe school. Implicated are several parents and photographer Norberto Dionisio Martinez. The photographs in question involved partially nude women, men and children in a classroom at the school. Angry parents have protested and sued the school although those involved claimed no pornographic acts were involved.&lt;ref name="demandan"&gt;{{cite news |title= Demandan a padres que denunciaron abusos contra sus hijos en escuela católica de Oaxaca |first= Octavio |last= Vélez Ascencio |url= http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2008/08/28/index.php?section=estados&amp;article=036n1est |newspaper=La Jornada |location=Mexico City |date=August 28, 2008 |accessdate=April 8, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Parents demand prosecution of abuses against their children in a Catholic school in Oaxaca }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The city==
[[File:KioskOcotlan.JPG|thumb|left|Kiosk in the main plaza]]
The city can seem like an ordinary and even empty town at first glance.&lt;ref name="rescato"/&gt; However, because of its geographic location on the south end of the Central Valleys region of Oaxaca, the city is a distribution center for local towns and smaller cities such as [[Santa Lucía Miahuatlán]]. It is also a point of transit for those traveling between the state capital and the coast, a role that will be enforced with the completion of the new modern highway.&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt; One reason the area is relatively quiet is that for many years, until recently, its churches, monastery, plazas and gardens lay unkempt against the effects of the sun and time, as well as vandalism. Most of the restoration work was sponsored by artist Rodolfo Morales, a native of Ocotlán.&lt;ref name="rescato"/&gt;

The city's main attraction is the Temple and Ex-convent of Santo Domingo de Guzmán.  The complex was constructed in various stages between the 16th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="MexDesOax"/&gt;  The construction of the monastery was halted on several occasions due the lack of manpower, due to the discovery of mines nearby such as Santa Catarina.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;  The main vault, [[apse]], [[choir (architecture)|choir]] and [[sacristy]] of the church were not finished until 1669. The pillars of the cloister were begun at this time as well, but were never finished.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt;

[[File:CourtyardChurchOcotlan.JPG|thumb|Courtyard of monastery with church behind]]
From then until the early 19th century, much of the complex was poorly maintained and fell into ruins. Starting in 1804, the Dominicans worked to rehabilitate the building, with attempts continuing until the complex was appropriated by the federal government during the [[Reform War|Reform Laws]]. Ocotlan was one of the last towns in Oaxaca to still have friars in residence in the 19th century but by 1855, the last one had left.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;  By 1885, the monastery area was completely abandoned, but the church was still functioning and remaining in relatively good condition.&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt;

[[File:OcotlanJuanEv.jpg|thumb|left|''Santo'' of Saint John, from the Chapel of the Señor de la Sacristia]]After it was no longer used as a monastery, the complex has several uses, including that of a prison, where inmates made crafts. In the latter 20th century, the Rodolfo Morales Foundation restored and converted the monastery space into a museum, which contains one room with works by Morales, one room with Oaxaca crafts and one room with artwork from the colonial period. There are also sound and book libraries. In the courtyard where the old pillory is, are held cultural events and photography shoots.&lt;ref name="MexDesOax"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rescato"/&gt;   The church was also restored by the foundation, but maintains its religious function.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;

The church is fronted by a very large [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] fenced by a stone wall. The main facade has two bodies and a crest with both [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] elements. The first body contains the door arch and the second is marked by the choir window. Both bodies are flanked by columns with [[Ionic order]] capitols. The columns extend up the facade and have profuse vegetative decoration. At the top, there is a shell. In the interior is the Chapel of the Senor de la Sacristia, which is decorated in Neoclassical style.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt; In both the church and the chapel are found a large number of colonial-era ''santos'' (statues of saints), many executed in fine polychrome and well preserved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aug.edu/augusta/santos/ocotlan/index.html Santos in Oaxaca's Ancient Churches: Santo Domingo Ocotlán]. Retrieved 2012-04-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MuniPalExpoOctolan.JPG|thumb|left|Municipal palace]]
The municipal palace has a sober Neoclassic facade built with pink stone, with columns and pediments.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt; The main feature are the arches which rest on columns with rectangular bases, forming portals. It was designed to be a focus point for social interaction.&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt; The main feature of the interior is the mural work done in the council chambers by Rodolfo Morales in the 1950s, when he was a young man. The mural work depicts scenes from the history of Ocotlán as well as landscapes and representative scenes such as the [[Traditional fixed markets in Mexico|municipality markets]], mining and agriculture. Unfortunately, this work does not receive the care it deserves as the chambers have been used for storage as well as meetings.&lt;ref name="rescato"/&gt;&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt; This palace was constructed to commemorate the Centennial of Mexican Independence which occurred in 1910,&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt; and was completed in 1913.&lt;ref name="rescato"/&gt;
[[File:PatioMoralesHouseOcotlan.JPG|thumb|Courtyard of the Morales house]]
The Rodolfo Morales house is a mansion from the 18th century which he rescued and lived in. Today, the building is a cultural center with an open-air theatre, which can seat 200 people, galleries of work by local artists and a computer center. All activities and resources here are offered free of charge.&lt;ref name="rescato"/&gt;&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fundacion"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fcrom.org.mx/es/fundacion/fundacion.html |title= Fundación Cultural Rodolfo Morales A.C.  |publisher= Fundación Cultural Rodolfo Morales A.C.  |location=Ocotlan de Morelos, Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=April 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The house is located just north of the main square and preserves a number of Morales personal effects, including collages.&lt;ref name="MexDesOax"/&gt; The building is also home to the Fundación Cultural Rodolfo Morales, A. C (Rodolfo Morales Cultural Foundation), which  is a private, nonprofit organization which promotes education and culture in the Ocotlan District of the state of Oaxaca. The Foundation realizes restorations, the maintenance and conservation of architectural monuments, paintings and sculptures and trains young people in restoration work. The foundation was created in 1992 by Rodolfo Morales.&lt;ref name="fundacion"/&gt;
The Octolan railroad station was built along the old Ferrocarril San Jerónimo to San Pablo Huixtepec line in 1906. In 1909, a second platform was built.&lt;ref name="ferrocarril"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sic.gob.mx/ficha.php?table=fnme&amp;table_id=132&amp;estado_id=20 |first= |work=Ferrocarril de Mexico |title= Ocotlán |publisher=CONACULTA |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=April 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VirginOcotlan2.JPG|thumb|The Virgin of Ocotlán]]
A number of important traditions are maintained in the community. The feast of the Virgin of Ocotlán is celebrated on 15 May. Most of the festivities take place on the main square of the town with live music and regional food, especially [[tamale]]s and [[atole]]. The feast of the Señor de la Sacristia is celebrated on the third Sunday in May. One old tradition that is still maintained is a dancing procession to bring the bride and groom their wedding gifts to their new home.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;
However, the most important tradition is the weekly Friday market day ([[tianguis]]), which is one of the oldest and largest in the Central Valleys region of Oaxaca. Produce and products from surrounding towns are available as well as manufactured products.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt; Market day is not just buying and selling for rural and indigenous communities, it is a festive ritual which has been held regularly for thousands of years, attracting both locals and families from small outlying villages to both buy and sell. It is an opportunity for many to socialize with distant neighbors. Market day begins very early for both residents and those who travel to the town to sell.&lt;ref name="ipn"/&gt; Many products such as plants, flowers, fruit, [[lime (material)|lime]] for tortillas, live animals, fabric, ceramics, baskets, knives, saddles, hats, rope, [[alebrije]]s, traditional footwear and drinks such as [[mezcal]] and tejate.&lt;ref name="ipn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt; Many of the products are the crafts produced by other towns in the Central Valleys region of Oaxaca, such as  textiles of [[Jalietza]], and [[San Antonino Castillo Velasco]] and the alebrijes of [[San Martín Tilcajete]].&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt; Prepared regional specialties are also offered here and the adjacent permanent municipal market. Some of the traditional foods here include several types of [[mole (sauce)|mole]] (negro, rojo, Amarillo, coloradito and more), chichilo, [[tasajo]], tamales in banana leaves and tacos with [[chapulines]] (fried grasshoppers). Another favorite is ice cream in flavors such as nut, [[opuntia|cactus fruit]], [[guanabana]], [[horchata]] and others. Sweet breads such as "mamones" "rosquitas" "marquezotes" and coconut tortillas are popular as well.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt; Most of the food products are locally made, including chapulines, animal crackers made with piloncillo and ice cream.&lt;ref name="ipn"/&gt; 

The eighth campus of the Nova Universitas University, part of the SUNEO system, was inaugurated by Oaxaca governor [[Ulises Ruiz Ortiz]] in the city. The college focuses on providing educational opportunities to indigenous populations. Professors give classes both in person at the campus and provide distance learning through big screens in remote classrooms with special monitors to allow student-teacher dialogue. The distance learning scheme allows students in Ocotlan to study with professors from other parts of the state and even attend classes offered in foreign countries. The first degrees offered are Computer Science and Agricultural Science. The school also offered adult and remedial education.&lt;ref name="puso"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nova"&gt;{{cite press release |title= Inauguró Ulises Ruiz campus Nova Universitas de Ocotlán de Morelos |publisher=State of Oaxaca |date=February 10, 2010 |url= http://www.oaxacacomunicacionsocial.gob.mx/prensa/1-comunicados/215-inauguro-ulises-ruiz-campus-nova-universitas-de-ocotlan-de-morelos- |language=Spanish |trans-title=Ulises Ruiz inaugurates Nova Universitas campus of Ocotlan de Morelos |accessdate=April 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city has a [[tuna (music)|tuna ensemble]] called the "Tuna Universitaria Santo Domingo de Guzman." This group organizes recitals such as the one in December 2009 for Christmas, inviting other tuna ensembles. The ensemble was founded in 1978 with the objective of preserving the music and traditions associated with the musical style and receives funding from Oaxaca state as well as from private sources.&lt;ref name="tuna"&gt;{{cite news |title= Recital navideño en Ocotlán de Morelos |first= Edgar |last= Leyva |url= http://www.diariodespertar.com.mx/cultura/25389-Recital-navideo-Ocotln-Morelos.html |newspaper= Diario Despertar |location=Oaxaca |date=December 24, 2009 |accessdate=April 8, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Christmas recital in Ocotlan de Morelos }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts and handcrafts==

===Rodolfo Morales===
[[File:MorelosShrineOcotlanMonastery.JPG|thumb|150px|Shrine to Morales at entrance to museum/monastery]]
The town is intimately linked with the life of painter Rodolfo Morales. He has depicted it in his works and has worked to save many of its historic and architectural treasures.&lt;ref name="rescato"/&gt; The artist's work is devoted to images from this hometown, including local churches, indigenous women, religious procession and others.&lt;ref name="inconforme"&gt;{{cite news |title= Grandes Maestros del Siglo 20 / Rodolfo Morales: De mirada inconforme |newspaper=El Norte |location=Monterrey, Mexico |date=May 11, 2003 |page=3 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Great Masters of the 20th Century/Rodolfo Morales:From a non-conformist's perspective }}&lt;/ref&gt; Art critic Julio Cesar Schara states that Ocotlan is a down without grace or major heroes but Morales reinvented the area with his own imagination, painting Neoclassic palaces, angels, fairies to express how he felt about the place.&lt;ref name="reinventa"&gt;{{cite news |title=Evocan 26 artistas el Ocotlan de Morales |first=Omar |last=Garcia |newspaper=Reforma |location= Mexico City |date=May 8, 2002 |page=4 |language=Spanish |trans-title=26 Artists evoke Ocotlan del Morales }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his last works called "Mercados" depicts market scenes from the town painted on columns.&lt;ref name="rescato"/&gt;

Rodolfo Morales’ career as an artist developed in fits and starts.&lt;ref name="inconforme"/&gt; In the 1950s, Morales was commissioned to do the mural work in the municipal palace of Ocotlan, painting it with historical and current scenes related to the municipality. Much of this mural work shows similarities to mural work done by Diego Rivera.&lt;ref name="delcampo"&gt;{{cite news |title= ENTRE PARÉNTESIS / ¿Morelos o Morales? |first=David |last= Martin del Campo |newspaper=Reforma |location= Mexico City |date=April 15, 2008 |page=9 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Between parenthesis/Morelos or Morales? }}&lt;/ref&gt; From that time to the 1970s, Morales remained in obscurity, teaching art privately and for a [[UNAM]] affiliated preparatory school. In the 1970s, his work was discovered by Mexican painter [[Rufino Tamayo]], when Morales was in his 50s.&lt;ref name="inconforme"/&gt; This later work was more surreal than that of the mural he painted when he was younger.&lt;ref name="delcampo"/&gt;  From the time of his discovery by Tamayo until 1986, Morales continued to work at the preparatory school even though his work was being sold in Europe, Mexico and the United States.&lt;ref name="inconforme"/&gt;&lt;ref name="delcampo"/&gt; In 1986, Morales retired from teaching to paint full-time. The production from this time period brought him fame and fortune, allowing him to sponsor civic projects in his hometown.&lt;ref name="delcampo"/&gt; In 1992, he established the Rodolfo Morales Foundation dedicated to fomenting the culture of Oaxaca and supporting the youth of Ocotlan. The artist died in 2001.&lt;ref name="inconforme"/&gt; Much of the restoration work in the monastery and church were done by Morales himself, including feminizing the angels and making the faces more solemn.&lt;ref name="delcampo"/&gt;
While Morales is Ocotlán's best known creative mind, the town has been associated with crafts for generations. Some of the crafts still practiced here include basketry, textiles in the form of [[rebozo]]s and other traditional clothing embroidered in silk thread, blade making, saddlemaking and miniatures in lead. The town is known for its red clay pottery, which is often painted in various colors.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt; Octolan is part of a stretch of road on which are a number of crafts towns such as San Bartolo Coyotepec, San Martin Tilcajete, Santo Tomás Jlietza and Santa Ana Zegache.&lt;ref name="rescato"/&gt;

[[File:MujerNiñoMEAPO.JPG|thumb|150px|"Mujer con Niño" by Guillermina Aguilar Alcantara at [[San Bartolo Coyotepec|the MEAPO Museum]].]]

===Crafts and artisans===
While the men dominate the rug-weaving and woodcarving industries in Oaxaca, the women reign with their pottery. This is true in Ocotlan as well.&lt;ref name="avazquez"&gt;{{cite news |title=Women in Oaxaca, Mexico, Find Strength through Pottery |first=A. |last=Vazquez |author2= Dai Huynh |newspaper=Knight Ridder Tribune Business New |location= Washington, D.C. |date=December 2, 2002 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The best known pottery family in Ocotlan is the Aguilar. The dynasty begins with potter Isaura Alcantara Diaz, a potter. Isaura learned the traditional pottery making techniques of the Oaxaca Valley, which was mostly limited to making utilitarian items. She began to experiment with figures and more decorative pieces, with some of her pieces making their way into the Rockefeller collection, but died prematurely at the age of 44. Before she died, she taught potting to her children Josefina, Guillermina, Irene, Concepción and Jesús. Due to their mother's death, the children began working early, with Josefina being only seven. Poverty prevented the children from attending school. Like their mother, they began and mostly made pots and other kitchen utensils but they also worked to develop clay figures.&lt;ref name="lcastillo"/&gt; Over time, these siblings became renowned for their fanciful painted clay figures that celebrate everyday life.&lt;ref name="avazquez"/&gt; Today, these siblings still work and much of the third generation are craftsmen as well. Some, such as Demetrio Garcia Aguilar, are making a name for themselves as well.&lt;ref name="lcastillo"/&gt;

[[Josefina Aguilar]] has been noted for her ceramic work since 1977 when she won the third Premio Nacional de Arte (National Art Prize) in 1977. Later, she would win statewide and other nationwide honors and would show her work internationally in places such as the United States and Europe, and her work can be found around the world.&lt;ref name="lcastillo"/&gt; Guillermina Aguilar Alcantara is known for her nativity scenes, wedding scenes, candle sticks and other works done in clay. She and her sister Irene have also won a number of awards and has exported her wears to over a dozen countries. Much of this exporting success was due to a grant by Fomento Cultural Banamex which allowed the family operation to purchase shipping equipment.&lt;ref name="cptm"&gt;{{cite news |title=Nombra el CPTM a los embajadores de la Marca México |first=Carlos |last=Velazquez Mayoral |newspaper=Economista |location= Mexico City |date=September 15, 2005 |page= |language=Spanish |trans-title=CPTM names ambassadors for the Mexico Brand }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EtchedBladeAguilar.JPG|thumb|125px|left|[[Apolinar Aguilar Velasco]] and one of his blades]]
Another known craftsman is Angel Aguilar, who is known for making knives, swords, machetes and the like using the same techniques as those used in the 16th century. Aguilar began making blades when he was ten, taught by his father and uncle. He is now teaching the craft to the next generation.&lt;ref name="palehorse"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://palehorsemex.blogspot.com/2006/12/ocotlan-de-morelos-mexico-steel-worked.html |title=Ocotlan de Morelos, Mexico: Steel worked as in 16th century Toledo, Spain |accessdate=April 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The municipality==
As municipal seat, the city of Ocotlán de Morelos is the government authorities for about forty other localities with the most populous outside the seat being Praxedis de Guerrero (1530), San Pedro Guegorexe (813) and Tejas de Morelos (688). However, over seventy percent of the municipality's population of 19,581 lives in the city proper.&lt;ref name="INEGI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/ |title=INEGI Census 2005 |language=Spanish |accessdate=April 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EjXaEdST?url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/ |archivedate=February 27, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The municipality borders the municipalities of [[Santa Ana Zegache]], [[San Martín Tilcajete]], [[San Juan Chilateca]], [[San Antonino Castillo Velasco]], [[Santiago Apóstol]], [[Ejutla de Crespo]], [[Santa Catarina Minas]], [[San Dionisio Ocotlán]], [[San Pedro Mártir, Oaxaca|San Pedro Mártir]], [[Asunción Ocotlán]], [[San Pedro Apóstol]], [[Magdalena Ocotlán]], [[Santa Inés Yatzeche]] and [[Santa Gertrudis (municipality)|Santa Gertrudis]].&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;

The territory's geography varies from mountains to flat valley area with some rolling hills. Principle elevations include Yavitise, and Guevexco which are part of the mountain region located to the east and Santa Catarina Minas and San Miguel Tilquiapam to the west. The main surface water is the Ocotlan River, which is a tributary of the [[Atoyac River (Oaxaca)|Atoyac.]] Other rivers include the Chilana, Santa Rosa, Rio Grande, Riod Chichicapan, San Pablo, Taviche, Atoyac, Guanibay, Rio Bravo, La Garzona, Del Panteon and Paraiso. In addition there are intermittent streams that principally flow during the rainy season. The climate is temperate with some variation in temperature during the year and a moderate rainy season in the summer and early autumn. Most of the municipality's flora and fauna has been disturbed by man, with flat areas converted into farmland or settlements. Forests of pine and ocote still exist in the higher elevations.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;

There are deposits of gold, silver, iron, coal, lead, copper, zinc, [[antimony]], [[titanium]], [[asbestos]] and other minerals.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;

Most of the population is involved in agriculture (23%), crafts and manufacturing (28%) and commerce (45%). One major crop is the [[castor oil plant]], along with corn, beans and various fruit trees. Livestock includes cattle, pigs, goats and domestic fowl. There is a processing plant which makes vegetable oil, with mezcal and dairy products produced in small workshops. Crafts include textiles and ceramics. Most working in commerce has small family businesses.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;

The municipality of Ocotlan de Morelos has 8 municipal agencies of Buenavista, Praxedis de Guerrero, [[Texas De Morelos]], San Cristóbal Ixcatlán, San Felipe Apóstol, [[San Jacinto Chilateca]], San Jacinto Ocotlán, and San Pedro Guegorexe. also has 5 Police Agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/enciclopedia/EMM20oaxaca/municipios/20068a.html|title=OAXACA - Ocotlán de Morelos|website=www.inafed.gob.mx|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4143">'''Pedro Mariño de Lobera''' (1528–1594) was a [[Galician people|Galician]] soldier and chronicler of the [[Arauco War]] in the [[Captaincy General of Chile]].

==Biography==
A professional soldier who served in the war between [[Spain]] and [[France]], he went to the Americas in 1545.  Mariño joined the forces of [[Pedro de La Gasca]] in [[Havana, Cuba]], when he received the order of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Carlos V]] to end the revolt of [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] in [[Peru]]. He was then transferred to [[Lima]] where he remained until his trip to [[Chile]], in 1551.

In Chile he participated actively next to [[Pedro de Valdivia]] and [[Francisco de Villagra]] in the first campaigns made to the South, as an outstanding soldier. Also, he was present in the campaigns of the governors [[García Hurtado de Mendoza, Marquis of Cañete|García Hurtado de Mendoza]] and [[Rodrigo de Quiroga]].

Later, in payment of his services, an [[encomienda]] in the city of [[Valdivia, Chile|Valdivia]] was granted to him. He was the corregidor of the city, rendering his aid to the victims of the flood caused by the [[1575 Valdivia earthquake]]. Later he was also corregidor of [[Camaná]], in the south coast of Peru, returning later to Lima.

In his last years Mariño de Lobera developed a friendship with the Jesuit Fr. [[Bartolomé de Escobar]], who also had been in Chile, giving him the manuscripts of his ''Chronicle of the Kingdom of Chile'' ({{lang-es|Crónica del Reino de Chile}}) to be corrected and published by the priest. Even though Fr. Escobar edited the manuscript, the text was never printed at the time. Only in 1865 was it published in the Volume VI of the ''Colección de Historiadores de Chile y documentos relativos a la Historia Nacional de ese país''. Mariño de Lobera died in [[Lima, Peru|Lima]] in 1594.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1936">The '''Pyxis of Čierne Kľačany''' (Slovak: ''Čiernokľačianska pyxida'') is an [[Oval|oval-shaped]] [[Gemstone|jewel]] box (i.e. a [[pyxis (vessel)|pyxis]]) made of ivory. Several fragments were found in an intact tomb near the village of [[Čierne Kľačany]] in [[Slovakia]] in 1974 by a group of boys and locals. The artifact was subsequently reconstructed from the fragments.

==History==
The artifact is dated from the end of the 9th century, although it was probably made in the 4th century. There are only a few similar objects in the entire world. It is believed that the box was a gift for the ruler [[Rastislav of Moravia]], brought during the times of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] (late 9th century) from the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref name=Pravda&gt;{{cite news|title=Boys were looking for traces of partisans.

The artifact depicts scenes of daily life, such as people farming on fields and breeding animals. It shows the legend of the [[founding of Rome]]. The artifact was found in pieces, some of which have never been found. Some copies of the box have been made; one of them was donated to [[Pope John Paul II]] in November 2003. The original is conserved in [[Bratislava Castle]]. A memorial stone was laid by [[Matica slovenská]] in 1993 in the area where the artifact had originally been found.

'''Sacred architecture''' (also known as '''religious architecture''') is a [[religion|religious]] [[architecture|architectural]] practice concerned with the design and construction of [[place of worship|places of worship]] or sacred or intentional space, such as [[Church architecture|churches]], [[Mosque#Architecture|mosques]], [[stupa]]s, [[synagogue architecture|synagogues]], and [[temple]]s. Many cultures devoted considerable resources to their sacred architecture and places of worship. Religious and sacred spaces are amongst the most impressive and permanent [[monolithic architecture|monolithic]] [[building]]s created by humanity. Conversely, sacred architecture as a locale for meta-intimacy may also be non-monolithic, ephemeral and intensely private, personal and non-public.

Sacred, religious and holy structures often evolved over centuries and were the largest buildings in the world, prior to the modern skyscraper. While the various styles employed in sacred architecture sometimes reflected trends in other structures, these styles also remained unique from the contemporary architecture used in other structures. With the rise of [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic]] [[monotheism]]s (particularly [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]), religious buildings increasingly became centres of [[worship]], [[prayer]] and [[meditation]].

The Western scholarly discipline of the [[history of architecture]] itself closely follows the history of religious architecture from ancient times until the [[Baroque period]], at least. [[Sacred geometry]], [[iconography]], and the use of sophisticated [[semiotics]] such as signs, symbols and religious motifs are endemic to sacred architecture.

== Spiritual aspects of religious architecture ==

[[File:Orthodox-Church-interior.jpg|left|thumb|An illustrated layout of the traditional interior of a [[Christian]] [[Eastern Orthodox church architecture|Orthodox church]].]]

Sacred or religious architecture is sometimes called sacred space.

Architect Norman L. Koonce has suggested that the goal of sacred architecture is to make "transparent the boundary between matter and mind, flesh and the spirit." In discussing sacred architecture, Protestant minister [[Robert Schuller]] suggested that "to be psychologically healthy, human beings need to experience their natural setting—the setting we were designed for, which is the garden." Meanwhile, [[Richard Kieckhefer]] suggests that entering into a religious building is a metaphor for entering into spiritual relationship. Kieckhefer suggests that sacred space can be analyzed by three factors affecting spiritual process: longitudinal space emphasizes the procession and return of sacramental acts, auditorium space is suggestive of proclamation and response, and new forms of communal space designed for gathering and return depend to a great degree on minimized scale to enhance intimacy and participation in worship.

== Ancient architecture ==

[[File:Karnak Temple Interior.jpg|thumb|right|The interior of the ancient Egyptian [[Karnak|Karnak Temple]].]]

Sacred architecture spans a number of ancient architectural styles including [[Neolithic architecture]], [[ancient Egyptian architecture]] and [[Sumerian architecture]]. Ancient religious buildings, particularly temples, were often viewed as the dwelling place, the ''[[temenos]]'',  of the gods and were used as the site of various kinds of sacrifice. Ancient tombs and burial structures are also examples of architectural structures reflecting religious beliefs of their various societies. The [[Temple of Karnak]] at Thebes, Egypt was constructed across a period of 1300 years and its numerous temples comprise what may be the largest religious structure ever built. Ancient Egyptian religious architecture has fascinated archaeologists and captured the public imagination for millennia.

== Classical architecture ==

{{see also|Classical architecture|Architecture of Ancient Greece|Roman architecture}}

[[File:ac.parthenon5.jpg|thumb|The [[Parthenon]] in [[Athens]], [[Greece]].]]

Around 600 BCE the wooden columns of the Temple of Hera at Olympia were replaced by stone columns. With the spread of this process to other sanctuary structures a few stone buildings have survived through the ages. Greek architecture preceded Hellenistic and Roman periods (Roman architecture heavily copied Greek). Since temples are the only buildings which survive in numbers, most of our concept of classical architecture is based on religious structures. The [[Parthenon]] which served as a treasury building as well as a place for veneration of deity, is widely regarded as the greatest example of classical architecture.

== Indian architecture ==

{{see also|Indian rock-cut architecture|Hoysala architecture|Hindu temple architecture}}
[[Indian architecture]] is related to the history and religions of the time periods as well as to the geography and geology of the Indian subcontinent. India was crisscrossed by trading routes of merchants from as far away as [[Siraf]] and [[China]] as well as weathering invasions by foreigners, resulting in multiple influences of foreign elements on native styles.  The diversity of Indian culture is represented in its architecture. Indian architecture comprises a blend of ancient and varied native traditions, with building types, forms and technologies from [[West Asia|West]], [[Central Asia]], and [[Europe]].

=== Buddhism ===

{{see also|Buddhist architecture|stupa}}

[[Buddhist architecture]] developed in [[South Asia]] beginning in the third century BCE. Two types of structures are associated with early [[Buddhism]]: [[viharas]] and [[stupas]].
Originally, Viharas were temporary shelters used by wandering monks during the rainy season, but these structures later developed to accommodate the growing and increasingly formalized Buddhist [[monasticism]]. An existing example is at [[Nalanda]] ([[Bihar]]).

The initial function of the stupa was the veneration and safe-guarding of the relics of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. The earliest existing example of a stupa is in [[Sanchi]] ([[Madhya Pradesh]]). In accordance with changes in religious practice, stupas were gradually incorporated into [[chaitya]]-grihas (stupa halls). These reached their highpoint in the first century BCE, exemplified by the cave complexes of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] and [[Ellora]] ([[Maharashtra]]).

The [[pagoda]] is an evolution of the Indian stupa that is marked by a tiered [[tower]] with multiple [[eaves]] common in China, Japan, Korea, Nepal and other parts of Asia.
[[Buddhist temple]]s were developed rather later and outside South Asia, where Buddhism gradually declined from the early centuries CE onwards, though an early example is that of the [[Mahabodhi Temple]] at [[Bodh Gaya]] in [[Bihar]]. The architectural structure of the stupa spread across Asia, taking on many diverse forms as details specific to different regions were incorporated into the overall design. It was spread to China and the Asian region by [[Araniko]], a [[Nepal]]i architect in the early 13th century for [[Kublai Khan]].

===Hinduism===
{{main|Hindu temple architecture}}
[[File:Raghunath Temple Jammu.JPG|left|upright|thumb|The [[Shikhara]] of the [[Raghunath Temple]] at [[Jammu]], [[India]] is built in the Nagara style of temple architecture.]]
[[File:Brihadeshwara front right.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Brihadeeswarar Temple]], Tanjavur, built in the Dravida style]] 
[[Hindu temple architecture]] is based on ''[[Sthapatya Veda]]'' and many other ancient religious texts like the ''[[Brihat Samhita]]'', ''[[Vastu Shastra]]'' and ''[[Shilpa Shastras]]'' in accordance to the design principles and guidelines believed to have been laid by the divine architect [[Vishvakarma]]. It evolved over a period of more than 2000 years. The Hindu architecture conforms to strict religious models that incorporate elements of [[astronomy]] and [[sacred geometry]]. In Hindu belief, the [[temple]] represents the [[macrocosm]] of the universe as well as the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] of inner space. While the underlying form of Hindu temple architecture follows strict traditions, considerable variation occurs with the often intense decorative embellishments and ornamentation.

A basic [[Hindu]] [[temple]] consists of an inner sanctum, the ''[[garbhagriha]]'' or womb-chamber, a congregation hall, and possibly an antechamber and porch. The sanctum is crowned by a tower-like ''[[shikhara]]''. The [[Hindu temple]] represents Mount Meru, the axis  of the universe. There are strict rules which describe the themes and sculptures on the outer walls of the temple buildings.

The two primary styles that have developed are the [[Nagara]] style of Northern India and the [[Dravidian architecture|Dravida]] style of Southern India. A prominent difference between the two styles are the elaborate gateways employed in the South. They are also easily distinguishable by the shape and decoration of their shikharas. The Nagara style is beehive-shaped while the Dravida style is pyramid-shaped.

==Byzantine architecture==
{{see also|Byzantine architecture}}
[[File:Aya sofya.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hagia Sophia]], the Church of [[Holy Wisdom]]]] 
[[File:KariyeCamii-Aussenansicht.jpg|thumb|upright|The 6th-century Kariye Camii, Istanbul, is now a museum.]]
[[File:Ani.mosque.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The ruins of Menüçehr Camii near Kars, Turkey, believed to be the oldest [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] mosque in [[Anatolia]]]]
[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] architecture evolved from Roman architecture. Eventually, a style emerged incorporating Near East influences and the Greek cross plan for church design. In addition, brick replaced stone, classical order was less strictly observed, mosaics replaced carved decoration, and complex domes were erected. One of the great breakthroughs in the history of Western architecture occurred when Justinian's architects invented a complex system providing for a smooth transition from a square plan of the church to a circular dome (or domes) by means of squinches or pendentives. The prime example of early Byzantine religious architecture is the [[Hagia Sophia]] in Istanbul.

==Islam==
{{see also|Islamic architecture}}
Byzantine architecture had a great influence on early Islamic architecture with its characteristic round arches, vaults and domes. Many forms of mosques have evolved in different regions of the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]]. Notable mosque types include the early [[Abbasid]] mosques, T-type mosques, and the central-dome mosques of [[Anatolia]].

[[File:Spain Andalusia Cordoba BW 2015-10-27 13-54-14.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of the [[Mezquita]], a hypostyle mosque with columns arranged in grid pattern, in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], [[Spain]]]]
The earliest styles in Islamic architecture produced ''Arab-plan'' or ''hypostyle'' mosques during the [[Umayyad Dynasty]]. These mosques follow a square or rectangular plan with enclosed courtyard and covered prayer hall. Most early hypostyle mosques had flat prayer hall roofs, which required numerous [[column]]s and [[support (structure)|support]]s.&lt;ref name="Masdjid1"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Hillenbrand| first = R | editor = P.J. Bearman |editor2=Th. Bianquis |editor3=[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth|C.E. Bosworth]] |editor4=E. van Donzel |editor5=W.P. Heinrichs | encyclopedia =[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]] Online| title = Masdjid. I. In the central Islamic lands | publisher = Brill Academic Publishers |issn=1573-3912 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mezquita]] in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], [[Spain]] was constructed as a hypostyle mosque supported by over 850 columns.&lt;ref name="mit-handout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/4.614/www/handout02.html |accessdate=2006-04-09 |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |title=Religious Architecture and Islamic Cultures}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arab-plan mosques continued under the [[Abbasid]] dynasty.

The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] introduced ''central dome mosques'' in the 15th century that have a large dome centered over the prayer hall. In addition to having one large dome at the center, there are often smaller domes that exist off-center over the prayer hall or throughout the rest of the mosque, in areas where prayer is not performed.&lt;ref name="mit-vocab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Architecture/4-614Religious-Architecture-and-Islamic-CulturesFall2002/LectureNotes/detail/vocab-islam.htm#islam6 |accessdate=2006-04-09 |title=Vocabulary of Islamic Architecture |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051124083425/http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Architecture/4-614Religious-Architecture-and-Islamic-CulturesFall2002/LectureNotes/detail/vocab-islam.htm#islam6 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2005-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Dome of the Rock]] mosque in Jerusalem is perhaps the best known example of a central dome mosque.

''Iwan mosques'' are most notable for their domed chambers and ''[[iwan]]s'', which are vaulted spaces open out on one end. In ''iwan'' mosques, one or more iwans face a central courtyard that serves as the prayer hall. The style represents a borrowing from pre-Islamic Iranian architecture and has been used almost exclusively for mosques in [[Iran]]. Many ''iwan'' mosques are converted [[Zoroastrism|Zoroastrian]] fire temples where the courtyard was used to house the sacred fire.&lt;ref name="Masdjid1"/&gt; Today, iwan mosques are no longer built.&lt;ref name="mit-vocab"/&gt; The [[Shah Mosque]] in [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], [[Iran]] is a classic example of an ''iwan'' mosque.
[[File:Mosque of Uqba minaret.jpg|right|thumb|View of the square three-tiered minaret of the [[Mosque of Uqba]] (Great Mosque of Kairouan); this mosque, founded in 670, is one of the most impressive mosques in North Africa, situated in [[Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]]]]

A common feature in mosques is the [[minaret]], the tall, slender tower that usually is situated at one of the corners of the mosque structure. The top of the minaret is always the highest point in mosques that have one, and often the highest point in the immediate area. The first mosques had no minarets, and even nowadays the most conservative Islamic movements, like [[Wahhabism|Wahhabis]], avoid building minarets, seeing them as ostentatious and unnecessary. The first minaret was constructed in 665 in [[Basra]] during the reign of the [[Umayyad]] [[caliph]] [[Muawiyah I]]. Muawiyah encouraged the construction of minarets, as they were supposed to bring mosques on par with [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Church (building)|churches]] with their [[bell tower]]s. Consequently, mosque architects borrowed the shape of the bell tower for their minarets, which were used for essentially the same purpose &amp;mdash; calling the faithful to prayer.&lt;ref name="Manara"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Hillenbrand| first = R | editor = P.J. Bearman |editor2=Th. Bianquis |editor3=[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth|C.E. Bosworth]] |editor4=E. van Donzel |editor5=W.P. Heinrichs | encyclopedia =[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]] Online| title = Manara, Manar | publisher = Brill Academic Publishers | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domes have been a hallmark of [[Islamic architecture]] since the 7th century. As time progressed, the sizes of mosque domes grew, from occupying only a small part of the roof near the [[mihrab]] to encompassing all of the roof above the prayer hall. Although domes normally took on the shape of a hemisphere, the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] in India popularized onion-shaped domes in [[South Asia]] and [[Persia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Architecture of Mughal India |last=Asher |first=Catherine B. |date=1992-09-24 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |ISBN=|chapter=Aurangzeb and the Islamization of the Mughal style |page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ablution area inside Eastern wall of Badshahi mosque.JPG|right|thumb|People washing before prayer at the [[Badshahi Masjid|Badshahi mosque]] in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]]]]

The prayer hall, also known as the musalla, has no furniture; chairs and pews are absent from the prayer hall.&lt;ref name="unitulsa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utulsa.edu/iss/Mosque/MosqueFAQ.html |accessdate=2006-04-09 |publisher=The University of Tulsa |title=Mosque FAQ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041230180348/http://www.utulsa.edu/iss/mosque/MosqueFAQ.html |archivedate=December 30, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prayer halls contain no images of people, animals, and spiritual figures although they may be decorated with [[Arabic calligraphy]] and verses from the [[Qur'an]] on the walls.

Usually opposite the entrance to the prayer hall is the ''[[qibla]] wall'', which is the visually emphasized area inside the prayer hall. The ''qibla'' wall is normally set perpendicular to a line leading to [[Mecca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Writing Signs: Fatimid Public Text |date=1998-12-16 |last=Bierman |first=Irene A. |publisher=University of California Press |ISBN=|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congregants pray in rows parallel to the ''qibla'' wall and thus arrange themselves so they face Mecca. In the ''qibla'' wall, usually at its center, is the [[mihrab]], a niche or depression indicating the ''qibla'' wall. Usually the ''mihrab'' is not occupied by furniture either. Sometimes, especially during [[Friday prayer]]s, a raised [[minbar]] or pulpit is located to the side of the ''mihrab'' for a [[khatib]] or some other speaker to offer a sermon ([[khutbah]]). The mihrab serves as the location where the [[imam]] leads the five daily prayers on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ioc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~islamarc/WebPage1/htm_eng/index/keyword1_e.htm |accessdate=2006-04-09 |title=Terms 1: Mosque |publisher=University of Tokyo Institute of Oriental Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mosques often have [[wudu|ablution]] fountains or other facilities for washing in their entryways or courtyards. However, worshippers at much smaller mosques often have to use restrooms to perform their ablutions. In traditional mosques, this function is often elaborated into a freestanding building in the center of a courtyard.&lt;ref name="mit-handout"/&gt; Modern mosques may have a variety of amenities available to their congregants and the community, such as  [[clinic|health clinics]], [[library|libraries]] and [[gym]]nasiums.

The religious architecture of Christian churches in the Middle Ages featured the [[Latin cross]] plan, which takes the Roman [[Basilica]] as its primary model with subsequent developments. It consists of a [[nave]], [[transept]]s, and the [[altar]] stands at the east end (see ''[[Cathedral diagram]]''). Also, [[cathedral]]s influenced or commissioned by [[Justinian I|Justinian]] employed the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine style]] of domes and a [[Greek cross]] (resembling a plus sign), centering attention on the altar at the ''center'' of the church. The [[Church of the Intercession on the Nerl]] is an excellent example of Russian orthodox architecture in the Middle Ages. The [[Urnes stave church]] (Urnes stavkyrkje) in [[Norway]] is a superb example of a medieval stave church.

==Gothic architecture==

{{see also|Gothic architecture}}
[[Gothic architecture]] was particularly associated with cathedrals and other churches, which flourished in Europe during the high and late medieval period. Beginning in 12th century France, it was known as "the French Style" during the period. The style originated at the [[Saint Denis Basilica|abbey church of Saint-Denis]] in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], near [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sHrUQclzjlIC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=gothic+originated+saint+denis&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=dD7aTqOVBs2ZhQedteHPDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=gothic%20originated%20saint%20denis&amp;f=false Andrzej Piotrowski (2011), ''Architecture of Thought'', U of Minnesota Press, p. 23]&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable gothic religious structures include [[Notre Dame de Paris]], the [[Cathedral of Our Lady of Amiens]], and the [[Chartres Cathedral]].

==Renaissance architecture==
[[File:Petersdom von Engelsburg gesehen.jpg|thumb|left|The Basilica of Saint Peter, Rome]]
{{see also|Renaissance architecture}}
The Renaissance brought a return of classical influence and a new emphasis on rational clarity. Renaissance architecture represents a conscious revival of Roman Architecture with its symmetry, mathematical proportions, and geometric order. [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]'s plan for the [[Santa Maria del Fiore]] as the dome of the Florence Cathedral in 1418 was one of the first important religious architectural designs of the Italian renaissance.

==Baroque architecture==
[[File:Santa Susanna (Rome) - facade.jpg|thumb|upright|Baroque façade of Santa Susanna, by [[Carlo Maderno]]]]
{{see also|baroque architecture}}
Evolving from the renaissance style, the [[baroque]] style was most notably experienced in religious art and architecture. Most architectural historians regard [[Michelangelo]]'s design of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]] as a precursor to the Baroque style. Baroque style can be recognized by broader interior spaces (replacing long narrow naves), more playful attention to light and shadow, extensive ornamentation, large frescoes, focus on interior art, and frequently, a dramatic central exterior projection. The most important early example of the baroque period was the [[Santa Susanna]] by [[Carlo Maderno]]. [[Saint Paul's Cathedral]] in [[London]] by [[Christopher Wren]] is regarded as the prime example of the rather late influence of the Baroque style in England.

==Mormon temples==
[[File:Temple Square October 05 (8) c.JPG|thumb|left|[[Salt Lake Temple]]]]
{{main|Temple architecture (Latter-day Saints)}}
[[Temple (LDS Church)|Temples]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] offer a unique look at design as it has changed from the simple church like structure of the [[Kirtland Temple]] built in the 1830s, to the [[castellated]] [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] styles of the early [[Utah]] temples, to the dozens of modern temples built today.  
Early temples, and some modern temples, have a priesthood assembly room with two sets of pulpits at each end of the room, with chairs or benches that can be altered to face either way.  Most, but not all temples have the recognizable statue of the [[Angel Moroni]] atop a spire.  The [[Nauvoo Temple]] and the [[Salt Lake Temple]] are adorned with symbolic stonework, representing various aspects of the faith.

==Modern and post-modern architectures==
[[File:IndependenceTemple2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Community of Christ Temple in Independence, Missouri, USA is postmodern in design.]] 
{{see also|Modern architecture|Postmodern architecture}}
[[Modern architecture]] spans several styles with similar characteristics resulting in simplification of form and the elimination of ornament. The most influential modernist architects in the early to mid 20th century include [[Dominikus Böhm]], [[Rudolf Schwarz (architect)|Rudolf Schwarz]], and [[Auguste Perret]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven J. Schloeder]], ''Architecture in Communion: Implementing the Second Vatican Council through Liturgy and Architecture.'' (Ignatius Press: 1998): 23-24 and 234-38. {{ISBN|0-89870-631-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While secular structures clearly had the greater influence on the development of modern architecture, several excellent examples of modern architecture can be found in religious buildings of the 20th century. For example, [[Unity Temple]] in Chicago is a [[Unitarian Universalist]] congregation designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. The [[United States Air Force Academy Cadet Chapel]], started in 1954 and completed in 1962, was designed by [[Walter Netsch]] and is an excellent example of modern religious architecture. It has been described as a "phalanx of fighters" turned on their tails and pointing heavenward. In 1967, Architect [[Pietro Belluschi]] designed the strikingly modern [[Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption (San Francisco, California)|Cathedral of St. Mary of the Assumption]] (San Francisco), the first Catholic cathedral in the United States intended to conform to [[Vatican II]].

Post-modern architecture may be described by unapologetically diverse aesthetics where styles collide, form exists for its own sake, and new ways of viewing familiar styles and space abound. [[Independence Temple|The Temple]] at Independence, Missouri was conceived by Japanese architect [[Gyo Obata]] after the concept of the chambered nautilus. The Catholic [[Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels]] (Los Angeles) was designed in 1998 by [[Jose Rafael Moneo]] in a post-modern style. The structure evokes the area's Hispanic heritage through the use of adobe coloring while combining stark modern form with some traditional elements. The [[Basilica of Our Lady of Licheń]] on the other hand is a much more traditional edifice. Designed by [[Barbara Bielecka]] and built between 1994 and 2004, its form includes references to a number of Polish structures. The columns possess a slenderness and delicacy inspired by those of the Renaissance court of [[Wawel Castle]] in [[Kraków]], while the huge 420-foot spire that will be erected next to the basilica bears more than an accidental resemblance to the Baroque spire that adorns the [[Jasna Gora]] monastery of [[Czestochowa]], home of the [[Black Madonna]].

The '''''Sharafnama''''' ([[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]: شەرەفنامە Şerefname, "The Book of Honor", [[Persian language|Persian]]: Sharafname, شرفنامه) is the famous book of [[Sharaf al-Din Bitlisi]] (a medieval [[List of Kurdish people|Kurdish]] historian and poet) (1543–1599), which he wrote in 1597, in [[Persian language|Persian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=R.

It deals with the different [[List of Kurdish dynasties and countries|Kurdish dynasties]] such as, [[Saladin|Saladin the Great]] and his [[Ayyubid Dynasty]], [[ancient]] and [[Medieval]] [[Kurdish principalities]] in the [[Middle-East]] and the [[Caucasus]], as well as some mentioning about the pre-Islamic ancestors of the Kurds.

==History==
{{Kurds}}
{{main|Sharaf Khan Bidlisi}}
[[Sharaf Khan Bidlisi]] was born in February 25, 1543, son of ''Shamsaddin Batlisi''{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}, in the Garmrood village. In 1576 [[Tahmasp I|Tahmasb]] of the [[Safavids]] gives him the title the ''[[Mir (title)|Mir]]'' of ''Mirs'' ("[[amir al-umara|commander of commanders]]"); appoints him leader of all [[List of Iranian Kurds|Iranian Kurdish]] tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=R. Izady|first=Mehrdad |title=The Kurds: a concise handbook|year=1991|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I9mr6OgLjBoC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=Sharaf+al-Din+Bitlisi&amp;hl=no&amp;ei=CQc2Tq_HIcPJswaY6JS5Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAg#v=snippet&amp;q=Sharaf%20al-Din%20Bitlisi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1578, ''Sharafkhan'' abandons his previous stand, and supports the [[Ottomans]] in their war against the [[Safavid dynasty|Iranians]], offering them 400 soldiers. Between 1578 and 1588, Sharafkhan virtually led all the Ottoman wars against the [[Persian people|Persians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=N. S. Sellers|first=Mortimer  |title=The New world order: sovereignty, human rights, and the self-determination |year=1996|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bKTsZMoY8XIC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;dq=Sharaf+al-Din+Bitlisi&amp;hl=no&amp;ei=JAo2ToeoH86Rswbc9-G5Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Sharaf%20al-Din%20Bitlisi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murad III|Sultan Murad III]], the Ottoman Sultan, grants Sharafkhan the title of Khan. He becomes the ''Mir'' of the ''Batlisi province''. As he turned 53, Sharafkhan gives the authority of his dynasty to his son ''Shamsaddin Bag Abu Alma'ali''. He begins writing the book ''Sharafnama'' in 1597.

==Translations==
In 1873–1875, ''François Charmoy'', a [[French people|French]] scholar, translated it from [[Persian language|Persian]] into [[French language|French]] and published it in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. At the right, it is a Kurdish–French dictionary, made by ''Alexandre Jaba'', and published in 1879 in Saint Pertersburg, too. Among many other languages, the Sherefname has been translated into [[Arabic languages|Arabic]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]],{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} [[English language|English]], [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] languages. in 1972 the great [[List of Kurdish people|Kurdish scholar]] [[Abdurrahman Sharafkandi]], translated the book from [[Persian language|Persian]] into [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] for the first time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12258">'''Suicide''' was a widespread occurrence '''in antiquity'''.  There were many different forms used and many different reasons for committing [[suicide]].  Because taking one’s own life is morally confrontational, there are many different viewpoints on suicide.  These viewpoints, although some may consider them modern, took root in ancient times.

== History of suicide ==
{{main|History of suicide}}
{{Suicide sidebar}}
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' places the first occurrence of the word in 1651.  However suicide was seen with much disgust, therefore many{{Who|date=August 2011}} did not put the word in their dictionaries, let alone vocabulary.  They used phrases like “self-murder”, “self-killing”, and “self-slaughter” in place of suicide. They felt these phrases more appropriately portrayed how closely it related to [[murder]].&lt;ref name="freedman" /&gt;

Because suicide was believed to be closely related to murder, many worry about the welfare of the soul for one who has committed suicide. This became a major religious question, and there are many different [[religious views of suicide]].

Eventually, many scientists and doctors considered suicide as a possible illness.  The doctors began assuming people committed suicide only when they were mentally ill.  There were advantages to claiming it as a medical problem. Instead of condemning the person and looking down on their families, sympathy became the response.  “The act was eventually decriminalized: the successful suicide could now be buried and his family was no longer disinherited; the unsuccessful suicide was spared execution”.&lt;ref name="freedman" /&gt;

However, with these advantages came some disadvantages as well.  [[Al Alvarez]] in his book The Savage God said, “Despite all the talk of prevention, it may be that the suicide is as rejected by the social scientist as utterly as he was by the most dogmatic Christian”.&lt;ref&gt;Alvarez, Al. The Savage God. New York: Random House, 1972. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  This referred to the fact that the more people began to recognize suicide as a mental illness, the more they turned away from the idea of it being a morally wrong action or a religious question.

== Ancient reasons for committing suicide ==
Today the reasons for suicide are many, and the ways to achieve it are broad. In earlier eras, some found it to be the only way to redeem them from failure.  Elise Garrison said that many ancient suicidal victims, “[were] determined to regain lost honor and restore equilibrium to society”.&lt;ref name="garrison"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Garrison |first= Elise P. |title= Attitudes Towards Suicide in Ancient Greece |journal= Transactions of the American Philological Association (1974-2014) |volume= 121 |date= 1991 |pages= 1-34 |publisher= The Johns Hopkins University Press |jstor= 284440 |doi= 10.2307/284440 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garrison also refers to the works of [[Émile Durkheim]].  She says that Durkheim talks about people being in different types and categories.  Determining what category they are in, could decide the reason they would commit suicide.  “Durkheim’s categories [are] —[[Egotism|egoistic]], [[altruistic]], [[Anomie|anomic]], [[fatalistic]]”.&lt;ref name="garrison" /&gt;

Durkheim explains that egoistic people over think and reflect on everything.  They tend to have high knowledge, and don’t integrate into society well.  Protestants, for example, may default to an egoistic personality.  The altruistic person devalues themselves and treats the opinion of the group very highly.  Those who lead a very strict life-style or are a religion that is very strict on obedience (such as [[Catholicism]] and [[Judaism]]).  [[Self-sacrifice]] is considered part of altruistic suicide.  Anomic suicide can result from someone who does not control or limit their desires.  They satisfy every desire, and have no regulation.  On the other hand, Fatalistic suicide will usually occur in someone who has high regulation and does not satisfy many of their desires.&lt;ref name="garrison" /&gt; While these categories apply to suicide today, it is these types of personalities that made people more susceptible to suicide anciently.

In ancient India, two forms of [[altruistic suicide]] were practiced. One was [[Jauhar]], a [[mass suicide]] by women of a community when their menfolk suffered defeat in battle, the women fearing retribution, rape, enslavement, and worse by the enemy soldiers; the other was [[Sati (practice)|Sati]], the self-immolation of a widow on the [[funeral pyre]] of her husband, or her suicide shortly afterwards, the pretexts varying, whether for emotional, or for religious, or for anticipated economic destitution, especially if elderly, or even [[Sati (practice)#Compulsion|compulsion]], sometimes a family's avaricious means to more expeditiously redistribute the widows property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Altruistic suicide in India |first= Lakshmi |last= Vijayakumar |journal= Archives of Suicide Research |date=2004 |url= https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13811110490243804 |volume= 8 |issue= 1 |pages= 73-80 |doi= 10.1080/13811110490243804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suicide in Ancient Greece ==
Because suicide was a controversial issue, it was discussed in all of the philosophical schools of the [[Greco-Roman]] world.  J.M. Rist says, “From the earliest days of the Stoic school the problem of suicide is…a problem of free will”.&lt;ref name="rist"&gt;Rist, J.M. Stoic Philosophy. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1969. Print&lt;/ref&gt;  Each school formed their own opinion on the consequences and moral meanings of suicide.  Eventually many Greeks came to consider suicide a heroic act.  A.D. Nock said, “there was a certain fascination about self-chosen death”.&lt;ref&gt;Nock, A.D. The Spread of Christianity. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1952. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophers in Ancient Greece ===
[[File:David - The Death of Socrates.jpg|thumb|right|320px|[[Jacques-Louis David]], ''[[The Death of Socrates]]'', 1787.]]
One of the many philosophers who developed an opinion on suicide was [[Socrates]].  He eventually says of suicide, “a man, who is one of the god’s possessions, should not kill himself ‘until the god sends some compulsion upon him, as he sends compulsion on us at present’”.&lt;ref name="rist" /&gt;  Socrates did not agree with suicide, unless as he says, god tells him or her to do it. He felt that it condemned the person who committed suicide even though he did so himself.  The defense of his eventual suicide is detailed in Plato's written account in the [[Apology_(Plato)|Apology]]. Though he was sentenced to death by the state, Socrates had the chance to escape and refused, instead choosing to drink [[Conium|hemlock]].

Another famous philosopher of the Greco-Roman world with strong views on the subject was [[Plato]].  We learn from J.M. Rist that, “in the Phaedo Plato allows a very small loophole in his condemnation of the frequent Greek practice of suicide… What ought a man to suffer, asks Plato, if he kills that which is most truly his own… that is, if he takes his own life?”&lt;ref name="rist" /&gt;  Plato believed that the state and the gods were associated, “Hence crimes against the state are crimes against the gods, and vice versa.  When a man kills himself without good reason… he is committing a crime”.&lt;ref name="rist" /&gt;  This allowed for the state the right to punish.  However, this did not imply that suicide was completely unacceptable.  If anything, Plato believed that suicide was acceptable under some circumstances.

[[Aristotle]] also believed that suicide was agreeable in some circumstances.  He felt that, “taking one’s own life to avoid poverty or desire or pain is unmanly… or rather cowardly”.&lt;ref name="rist" /&gt;  Although he believed this, he also felt that it was allowed if the state ordered it.  The case of Socrates was an illustration of this statement.

=== Stoic approaches ===
[[Stoicism]] encompassed the belief of most of the Greeks when it came to suicide.  The Stoics, like Plato and Aristotle, believed that suicide was wrong except under some circumstances.  Zeno believed that, “god gives the sign for an individual’s departure”.&lt;ref name="freedman"&gt;Freedman, David Noel, ed.  The Anchor Bible Dictionary.  New York: Doubleday, 1992. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is only in this circumstance that suicide is acceptable.  When god has given the sign, then and only then is it morally acceptable to end one's life.  This is the belief because it is after the sign is given that god has allowed life to be ended; this is because the work or duty of that person has been achieved.

== Biblical accounts ==
The Christian Bible, Old and New Testaments, has five accounts of suicide recorded.&lt;ref name="freedman" /&gt;  

=== Examples in the Old Testament ===
One account is that of [[Samson]]. Samson had been blessed by the lord with great strength but had lost this blessing. He was then imprisoned by the [[Philistines]]. Samson was brought before the Philistines to entertain them and leans against the support pillar of the temple they were all in and prayed to [[God]] for strength and God answered his prayer. With his newfound strength Samson knocks down the pillar causing the temple to fall down on himself and 3,000 Philistines.

[[File:Detail of Breughel's Death of Saul.jpg|thumb|320px|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], ''The Death of Saul'' (detail), 1562.]]
Other stories include the one of [[King Saul]] and his armor bearer.  After being fatally injured by some [[Philistines]], King Saul asks his armor bearer to kill him, but when his servant refused, he took the sword and fell on it.  Then his aide, being so distraught at the death of his king; he too took the sword and killed himself (1 Sam. 31:4-5).  In this context King Saul is committing suicide because he believes he will die anyway, so he wants to end the pain sooner.  His servant on the other hand kills himself out of devotion and respect to his king.

The third account is of a servant of [[King David]]’s son [[Absalom]].  His name was [[Ahithophel]].  He hanged himself because Absalom did not take his advice.  The fourth was [[Zimri (king)|Zimri]].  He was treasonous and proclaimed himself king after murdering [[King Elah]].  When the army would not follow him, he locked himself in his quarters and set fire to them.

=== Examples in the New Testament ===
The most widely known recorded suicide in the bible is probably the story of [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] after his betrayal of [[Jesus]]. "And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself" (Matt 27:6). [[St. Augustine]] said of this incident, “He did not deserve mercy; and that is why no light shone in his heart to make him hurry for pardon from the one he had betrayed, as those who crucified him were to do. In that despair, he killed himself”.&lt;ref name="whelan"&gt;Whelan, Caroline F. "Suicide in the Ancient World: A Re-Examination of Matthew 27:3-10" Laval théologique et philosophique vol. 49, iss. 3, 1993, p. 505-522.  Hyperlink "http://www.erudit.org/revue/LTP/1993/v49/n3/400796ar.pdf" http://www.erudit.org/revue/LTP/1993/v49/n3/400796ar.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bible teachings ===
These different accounts of suicide do not have much additional commentary, so it is not clear what teachings come from them.  However, because of the lack of details, many assume that in ancient Israel, suicide may have been considered a natural thing, or even considered heroic.&lt;ref name="freedman" /&gt;

Scholars are constantly involved in debates concerning the doctrine taught in the Bible concerning suicide.  Augustine taught that, “there is no legitimate reason for committing suicide, not even to avoid sinning…. When Judas hanged himself, he increased rather than expiated the crime of that accursed betrayal”.&lt;ref name="whelan" /&gt;  The only problem with Augustine’s claim is that it does not specifically say, in the Old Testament or New Testament, the doctrine relating to suicide.

'''Temperance songs''' are those musical compositions that were sung and performed to promote the [[Temperance Movement]] from the 1840s to the 1920s.  It was a distinct [[genre]] of [[American music]]. In 1830 the US per capita consumption of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] was 9.5 gallons yearly, almost four times the rate of consumption in 2008. In response, many [[List of Temperance organizations|temperance organizations]] formed over the next eighty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Songs of the Temperance Movement and Prohibition | publisher=Library of Congress | url = https://www.loc.gov/item/ihas.200197382#item-article | accessdate = 2015-10-13  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some temperance song lyrics were sung with already well-known songs of the period, for example, "[[Oh! Susanna]]". This [[Stephen Foster]] melody was used with lyrics in support of temperance and the title changed to “There’s A Good Time Coming,” in 1857, ten years after the publication of the [[s:Oh! Susanna|original lyrics of "Oh! Susanna"]].

== Development and genre history ==

[[File:Molly and the baby, Don't you know.ogg|thumb|A recording of "Molly and the Baby", a temperance song from 1916]]
A consistent [[Theme (arts)|theme]] within temperance songs of 19th and 20th century society was that drinking negatively impacted a stable [[family]] life and that it was at the center of much suffering. "Molly and the Baby Don't You Know" is about a father promising not to drink for the sake of his young child and [[suffering]] wife. Some temperance songs were intended to produce [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] about the consequences of alcohol consumption. Themes including [[physical abuse|abuse]] were common, such as "The Drunkard's Child," by [[Susan McFarland Parkhurst|Mrs. Parkhurst]], 1870. In this song, a mother hears her child decry that her father's drinking and their poverty leads to her being ignored by her peers. An archived field-recording of this song, sung by John McCready, relates the song of a dying child of an [[alcoholic intoxication|alcoholic]]. The child fears he or she will not be allowed to enter [[heaven]].&lt;ref name=LIBC!&gt;{{cite web | title = Songs of the Temperance Movement and Prohibition | publisher=Library of Congress
| url = https://www.loc.gov/item/ihas.200197382#item-article | accessdate = 2015-10-13  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Foster was considered to be the best-known of the Temperance songwriters.

== Stephen Foster ==

=== Comrades, Fill No Glass for Me ===

Foster’s Temperance song, “Comrades, Fill No Glass for Me” (1855), is thought to be a narrative of his own drinking struggle. The melody to these lyrics are unknown:
''Oh, comrades, fill no glass for me,

''To drown my soul in liquid flame'',

''For if I drank, the toast should be''&lt;br&gt;
''To blighted fortune, health and fame.''&lt;br&gt;
''Yet, though I long to quell the strife,''&lt;br&gt;
''That passion holds against my life,''

&lt;!-- We cannot include all the lyrics of a song and certainly not several. Song lyrics belong in wikisource or as ogg files that can be referenced here.Note there is a wiki &lt;song&gt;&lt;song/&gt; which saves you from  using all those breaks
''Though boon companions ye may be,&lt;br&gt;
Oh! comrades, fill no glass for me.

I know a breast that once was light&lt;br&gt;
Whose patient sufferings need my care,&lt;br&gt;
I know a hearth that once was bright,&lt;br&gt;
But drooping hopes have gather’d there,&lt;br&gt;
Then while the tear-drops nightly steal&lt;br&gt;
From wounded hearts that I should heal,&lt;br&gt;
Though boon companions ye may be,&lt;br&gt;
Oh! comrades, fill no glass for me.

''When I was young I felt the tide Of aspirations undefiled,''&lt;br&gt;
''But manhood’s years have wronged the pride My parents centered on their child.''&lt;br&gt;
''Then, by a mother’s sacred tear,''&lt;br&gt;
''By all that memory should revere, Though boon companions ye may be'',&lt;br&gt;''

=== A License Party Trick (sung to the tune of Oh! Susanna) ===

::: There was a great election once, (We need not name the date,)
:::: Out in Ohio, and it lost Republicans the State.
::: That party runs the Government With still house revenue,
:::: And boasts much of its temperance, From its “high license” view.

: ''(chorus)''
::: Oh, high license,
:::: How is that for high?
::: You’ll make your party very sick and
:::: It will surely die.
::::::: ''etc, etc''

&lt;!-- We cannot include all the lyrics of a song and certainly not several. Song lyrics belong in wikisource or as ogg files that can be referenced here.

Republicans are anxious, Sir, With two faced policy,&lt;br&gt;
To suit both rum and temperance,&lt;br&gt;
Just as the case may be;&lt;br&gt;
To hoodwink Prohibitionists, This is a cunning trick,&lt;br&gt;
But in the end, ‘twill hurt themselves,&lt;br&gt;
And make them very sick.

How can one trust such party, Sir, With plans so opposite,&lt;br&gt;
That offers either right or wrong, To all who vote for it?&lt;br&gt;
No wonder people in disgust&lt;br&gt;
Upon such morals frown; Like as Ohio, they will put&lt;br&gt;
Such double dealing down.

That party is the wrong one, Sir, To wear a temp’rance name&lt;br&gt;
Yet make high license fallacy&lt;br&gt;
Its highest moral aim!&lt;br&gt;
It cannot carry both at once,&lt;br&gt;
The church and the saloon, As other States will let it know,&lt;br&gt;
Besides Ohio, soon.

Of late, severe rebuke unto Republicans has come,&lt;br&gt;
And yet, deluded people trust The treachery of rum!&lt;br&gt;
They cling to party, though it be The known ally of drink!&lt;br&gt;
But with some more experience,&lt;br&gt; --&gt;

:::: They'll vote with us, we think.

This temperance song was sung to the tune of "Oh! Susanna", and was written in response to [[abolitionist]] and legislative developments of the times. In 1851, the state of [[Maine]] established statewide prohibition. Other states subsequently adopted similar [[legislation]]. "A License Party Trick" specifically refers to legislation passed in 1883 in [[Ohio]] when [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] lost the governorship and the majority in the state [[Ohio House of Representatives|House]] and [[Ohio Senate|senate]]. The ousted legislators and [[Charles Foster (Ohio politician)|Governor Charles Foster]]'s (no relation) attempt to tax and regulate alcohol sales resulted in the loss of support of temperance supporters. Voters found the politician's attempts at legislation as too [[liberalism|liberal]]. The legislative defeat was also attributed to the lack of support of [[Germans|German]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] [[voter]]s who believed the proposed [[liquor]] policies to be overly restrictive.

== Other songwriters ==
[[File:Temperance song hand book.jpg|thumb|350px|This is the songbook used at the Womens Temperance Organization from Wilkinsburg, PA]]
From the 1840s to 1920, the American Temperance Movement produced a large number of songs. Some of the more notable composers were Stephen Foster, [[Susan McFarland Parkhurst|Mrs. E.A. Parkhurst]], M. Evans, [[George Frederick Root|George F. Root]], and [[Henry Clay Work|Henry Work]]. Another specific example of a popular song of the times is "The Drunkard's Child," by Mrs. Parkhurst written in 1870. In the song a child complains to her mother that she is ignored by others because she is poor and her father drinks.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The temperance songwriters tended to write songs sympathetic to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] cause. This is in contrast to Stephen Foster who wrote [[minstrel songs]]. This genre is seen as racist today, and his own family opposed the [[abolition of slavery]]. Foster differed from the other temperance [[composer]]s in that he also wrote [[drinking songs]]. Some [[historian]]s believe that Foster drank heavily.&lt;ref name=SAND/&gt;

[[James Lord Pierpont]], composer of “[[Jingle Bells]],” created temperance songs with the [[melody]] of this still  popular holiday tune.&lt;ref name=SAND/&gt;

== Songs of Temperance organizations ==
Some locally organized temperance organizations printed and published their own temperance songs, some of which were derived from hymns. For example, the [[Old 100th|doxology]] has been modified with the following lyrics:
::::Praise God from Whom all blessings flow,
:::Praise him who saves from deepest woe,
::::Praise him who leads the temperance host,
:::Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''''The Myth of the Eastern Front: The Nazi-Soviet War in American Popular Culture''''' is a 2008 book by the American historians [[Ronald Smelser]] and [[Edward J. Davies]] of the [[University of Utah]]. It discussed perceptions of the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] of World War II in the [[United States]] in the context of [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionism]]. The book traced the foundation of the post-war myth of the [[clean Wehrmacht]], its support by U.S. military officials, and the impact of [[Wehrmacht]] and [[Waffen-SS]] mythology on American [[popular culture]], up to the time of its publication.

The book garnered mixed reviews. The positive reviews commended its thorough analysis on the creation of the myth by German ex-participants and its entry into American culture. One reviewer described the book as a "tour de force of cultural [[historiography]]", and another observed that it "present[s] a discomforting portrait of the American views of the Eastern Front". It was also praised by several reviewers for its compelling analysis of contemporary war-romancing trends. Negative reviews noted its lack of perspective, failure to make its case, and a tendency to whitewash [[Red Army]] crimes on the Eastern Front. Other reviewers criticised the authors' analysis as lacking in important respects, particularly in its discussion on the myth's role in the contemporary culture, and its impact on popular perceptions of the Eastern Front, outside of a few select groups.

==Background==
At the time of the publication of ''The Myth of the Eastern Front'', the authors were colleagues in the history department at the [[University of Utah]]. According to one reviewer, they were "well qualified for the task" of deconstructing the myth in the book's title: "Smelser is a widely published historian of Nazi Germany, while Davies, a self-confessed former adherent to the ''Ostfront'' myth, specializes in U.S. history".{{sfn|White|2008}} In the preface to the book, Davies called the book's writing a "personal journey" and described how his interest in the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Soviet-German war]] has grown out his reading ''Hitler Drives East'' by [[Paul Carell]]. Davies became a devotee, with hundreds of books on the Eastern Front in his library.{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|pp=xi–xii}} His private collection of [[Wargaming|wargames]] was part of the source material in the book.{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|p=316}}

==Structure==
[[File:Poster_russian.jpg|thumb|right|upright|US government material, 1942: Photo of smiling Russian soldier. U.S. media also played a key role in shaping a positive image of the Soviet Union during World War II.{{sfn|McFall|2010}}]]
The first section of the book focused on the prevailing American attitudes towards [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Wehrmacht]], and the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] in the period during [[World War II]] and its immediate aftermath. Their sources were newspapers, magazines, and other American media of the period. The book also discussed the role of the war-time American propaganda in shaping a positive image of the [[Soviet Union in World War II|Soviet Union]] as the [[Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|United Kingdom]]'s and the [[Military history of the United States during World War II|United States]]' ally.{{sfn|McFall|2010}}

The book then covered positive views on the Germans, produced early in the [[Cold War]] era. These arose due to the changing geopolitical climate, the appearance of German military sources which vindicated their side of the conflict, and support of this effort by the American military. Such works "emphasized love of family, professions of Christianity, charity toward the enemy, and heroic self-sacrifice, [while ignoring] mass murder, anti-partisan warfare (deliberately mislabeled by the Nazi regime in 1942 as "combating bandits," or ''[[Bandenbekämpfung]]''), property confiscation, complicity in forced labor roundups, and wanton destruction".{{sfn|White|2008}} A review for [[H-Net]] found that "the authors do a thorough job discrediting the claims made by the German officers in their memoirs, which can no longer be viewed as even minimally respectable".{{sfn|McFall|2010}}

The third section of the book covered the appearance of a new generation of "devotees of the German army and its campaigns in the east".{{sfn|McFall|2010}} They included new authors, [[wargaming]] fans, and [[World War II reenactment]] participants. The review in [[H-Net]] found that this section provided "insightful and exciting research" and that "Smelser and Davies astutely identify a set of sources historians have rarely tapped and survey it thoroughly." They identified the so-called "gurus" of this generation, influential authors and speakers which presented "a heroic, sanitized picture of the German army in the east".{{sfn|McFall|2010}}

==Themes==
[[File:Germans_in_the_Ost.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Nazi propaganda]] poster in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]; the headline reads: "German soldier is fighting for Europe". According to the introduction, the book examines, in part, the "romantic heroicisation of the German army fighting to save Europe from a rapacious Communism".{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|p=191}}]]
In the words of one reviewer, the central myth described in the book boiled down to the following:{{sfn|Wildermuth|2016}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;The German army, or Wehrmacht, fought a "clean" and valiant war against the Soviet Union, devoid of ideology and atrocity. The German officer caste did not share Hitler's ideological precepts and blamed the SS and other Nazi paramilitary organizations for creating the war of racial enslavement and extermination that the conflict became.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The German ''Landser'', or soldier, as far as conditions allowed, was generally paternal and kind to the Soviet citizens and uninterested in Soviet Jewry. That the German military lost this war was due in no way to its battlefield acumen, but to a combination of external factors, first and foremost Hitler's decisions. According to this myth, the defeat of Germany on the Eastern Front constituted a tragedy, not just for Germans, but for Western civilization.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book deconstructed this myth and introduced several themes, which were, in the authors' opinion, important to the understanding of the origins, longevity, and the impact of Eastern Front mythology:
*The role of propaganda in shaping popular perceptions.{{sfn|House|2008}}
*The role of the [[U.S. Army Historical Division]] in providing the German military commanders an opportunity to put down their recollections of Soviet-German conflict.{{sfn|Showalter|2009}}
*Parallels with the "[[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]]" mythology in the post-[[American Civil War]] era.{{sfn|McFall|2010}}
*The romanticisation of the German war effort in contemporary popular culture, especially with regards to the elite units such as the [[Waffen-SS]].{{sfn|Showalter|2009}}

==Reception==
[[Lawrence Freedman]] in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' magazine called the book a "fascinating exercise in historiography", highlighting the book's analysis of how a "number of Hitler's leading generals were given an opportunity to write the history of the Eastern Front to help develop lessons for the Americans on fighting the Russians, and in doing so they provided a sanitized version of events". However, Freedman also noted that the impact of this involvement on U.S. perceptions of the Eastern Front was less clear.{{sfn|Freedman|2008}} The review by Joseph Robert White, titled "A Noble But Sisyphean Effort", concluded by quoting the book's closing sentence: "The 'good German' seems destined for an eternal life". White observed that the book should nonetheless provide food for thought in classroom discussions about the German army, but noted that an assumption of specialised knowledge and the concomitant lack of a chapter about war crimes committed by the Wehrmacht undermined the authors' efforts to challenge the myth.{{sfn|White|2008}}

The military historian [[Jonathan House]], who, together with [[David Glantz]], wrote the 1995 book ''When Titans Clashed'' on the Soviet-German war, reviewed the book for ''[[The Journal of Military History]]'', describing it as a "tour de force of cultural historiography". He noted Smelser's and Davies's analysis of the post-war mythology that presented the [[Wehrmacht]] and even the [[Waffen-SS]] as "above reproach, knights engaged in a crusade to defend Western civilization against the barbaric hordes of Bolshevism. (...) Ronald Smelser and Edward Davies have performed a signal service by tracing the origin and spread of this mythology". House recommended that military historians not only study the book, but "use it to teach students the dangers of bias and propaganda in history". He also noted that in exploring its subject, the book provided a "one-sided view of the historiography" by not taking into account the contemporary, balanced works on the Soviet-German war, such as by Glantz and others.{{sfn|House|2008}}

Benjamin Alpers, in ''[[The American Historical Review]]'', the official publication of the [[American Historical Association]], noted that the book "present[s] a discomforting portrait of the American views of the Eastern Front. The authors are to be commended for exploring sources such as website and war games, that, while usually not studied by historians, are places where Americans encounter and enact World War II memory". However, the review also concluded that the authors' analysis of their material "is not entirely convincing", and also observed that they underplayed key divergences in their analogy between neo-Confederate ideas of the American Civil War and the mythic views of the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Alpers|2008|p=1578}}

Professor Christopher A. Hartwell provided a critical assessment of the book in a review published in ''[[German Studies Review]]''. He described the book as "interesting, but ultimately disappointing" and argued that the authors committed several egregious errors, with the most prominent being the whitewash of [[Red Army]] crimes on the Eastern Front, while denigrating those [authors] who do mention them "as contributing to the exoneration of the Wehrmacht". He noted that the book tends to suffer from a lack of perspective "on the effect the German generals had on the broader American perception of the war [on the Eastern Front]." Furthermore, Hartwell stated that the effect and influence of those "romancers" on American culture was not "impressively support[ed]" in the thesis, and the case that "romancers" were able to "effectively spread the myth of the innocent Wehrmacht" was not made out. Due to the lack of perspective, the book tended to lump together "those with an interest in military history and those who actually subscribe to neo-Nazi beliefs", and Hartwell concluded: "As it stands now, however, this tome has the feel of a dissertation that is trying too hard to find a niche that hasn't seen the light of day".{{sfn|Hartwell|2009}}

Kelly McFall of [[Newman University, Wichita|Newman University]] described the book as a "fascinating immersion into a simple but important question: How did the German soldiers who fought on the eastern front during World War Two become hero figures to so many Americans?" McFall found the discussion on the iconography of the 1970s and 1980s [[wargaming|wargames]] to be "path-breaking" and noted that the authors convinced her of the "existence of a community of 'buffs' who have made a fetish of the German army as super-efficient and super-heroic". However, she added that it was unclear how influential this community is outside of its niche, and what impact the rise of computer gaming may have had on this group.{{sfn|McFall|2010}}

David Wildermuth of [[Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania]] concurred with the author's argument regarding the potential danger of "depoliticizing a conflict which at its core was a war of racial subjugation and conquest". He found the authors' analysis of war-romancing trends to be "deep and compelling", but noted the book's limitations in assuming specialist knowledge, which made it less accessible to the general public. For example, lay readers would have benefited from the context of the differences between Waffen-SS and Wehrmacht, along with an overview of the war crimes committed by the Waffen-SS, "especially in light of the falsehoods appearing daily in Internet website chatrooms". The reviewer also remarked on the occasional sniping which made palpable the authors' frustrations with romantic notions of a "valiant German military". Despite this minor criticism, Wildermuth commended the book for its "fascinating analysis on how, far removed from its time and place, the echoes of this war still reverberate".{{sfn|Wildermuth|2016}}

Martin H. Folly provided a critical assessment of the book in a review published in the journal ''[[History (journal)|History]]''. While he complimented the authors for setting out the main myths concerning the Eastern Front, he argued that they did not provide convincing evidence to support their argument that most Americans accept such an account of the German-Soviet war. Moreover, Folly stated that the book overlooked the influence of prominent and more accurate accounts of the war on the Eastern Front. His summary was that "the book therefore delivers a rather weak conclusion, which dilutes the impact of the useful analysis earlier in the book on the creation of the myth by German ex-participants and its entry into American culture with the help of the US Army".{{sfn|Folly|2010}}

American historian [[Dennis Showalter]], in his review of the book for the journal ''[[Central European History]]'', described the book as "incomplete", noting that "Eastern Front romanticism has cultural as well as intellectual matrices that are a good deal more complex than Smelser and Davis acknowledge", such as the appeal of "individual struggle against overwhelming odds" in the German narratives of the war, vs the Soviet emphasis on the collective. He also described how the Soviet World War II historiography, overly dogmatic and propaganda-driven, remained untranslated in the West, allowing the German view of the conflict to dominate academic and popular perceptions.{{sfn|Showalter|2009}}

Showalter acknowledged that the romanticised views described in the book existed, but argued that they remain limited in their impact on the wider popular culture: "Third Reich military memorabilia thrives—but in a niche market. (...) Eastern Front enthusiasts—who buy a disproportionate number of the books romanticizing the Eastern Front—are a minority within a minority, and, as a rule, are at some pains to deny sympathy with the Third Reich". The reviewer concludes that opening of the Russian archives since the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]] has enabled "balanced analysis at academic levels", leading to a new interest in the [[Red Army]] operations from the popular history writers and the World War II enthusiasts.{{sfn|Showalter|2009}}

==Cover art==
The book's cover art, which spanned the front and the back, featured an image adopted from the 1987 wargame ''The Last Victory: Von Manstein's Backhand Blow, February–March 1943'' from [[Clash of Arms|Clash of Arms Games]]. The game was devoted to the [[Third Battle of Kharkov]], which, under the command of Field Marshal [[Erich von Manstein]], resulted in the recapture of the city and the stabilisation of the front following the Wehrmacht's defeat in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]].{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|pp=191–193}}

The box cover art depicted a German panzer commander with a "stern-looking face". The authors described the image: "He is standing up, in an open hatch. Behind him is a line of Tiger tanks stretching along a city street. In the background, in blue with mist and smoke rising, stands Kharkov. The Nazi swastika sits in a lit circle to the top left of the cover". The book further noted that the accompanying materials "praise Manstein for his brilliance and his ability to recognise the assets of extremely able commanders under him", such as [[Paul Hausser]], who led a Waffen-SS panzer corps during the battle.{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|pp=191–193}}

'''Theorica''' ([[ancient Greek|Gr.]] '''{{lang|grc|Θεωρικά}}''') (also '''Theoric Fund''' and '''Festival Fund''') was in [[ancient Athens]] the name for the fund of monies expended on festivals, sacrifices, and public entertainments of various kinds; and also monies distributed among the people in the shape of largesses from the state.&lt;ref name="DGRA"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Kennedy  | first = Charles Rann  | author-link = Charles Rann Kennedy  | contribution = Theorica  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]  | volume =   | pages = 1126–1127  | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  | place = Boston  | year = 1870  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-dgra/1133.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
There were, according to [[Xenophon]], more festivals at Athens than in all the rest of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''De Rep. Ath.'' iii. 8&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides those open to the whole body of the people, there were many confined to the members of each tribe, [[deme]], and house.  These last were provided for out of the private funds of the community who celebrated them.  At the most important of the public festivals, there were not only [[sacrifice]]s, but [[procession]]s, theatrical exhibitions, gymnastic contests, and games, celebrated with great splendor and at a great expense.

Theorika was created or reinstated&lt;ref&gt;Some ancient sources cite [[Pericles]] as the founder of the theorika (Plutarch’s Pericles 9.1 and Plato’s Gorgias 515E); [[Agyrrhius|Agyrrhios]], an Athenian demagogue, is also mentioned as the first to have initiated this public largesse by Aristotle in ''Athenian Constitution'' 41.3.  See also Buchanan, James ''Theorika''.  New York 1962 (p. 29-53).&lt;/ref&gt; around 350 BCE, after the [[Social War (357-355 BC)|Social War (357-5 BCE)]],&lt;ref&gt;Justin (6.9.1) dates the establishment of the theorika sometime at the end or after the battle of Mantinea in 362 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; by the Athenian statesman [[Eubulus (statesman)|Eubulus]], an administrator to the theorikon treasury sometime after 354/3 until Cephisophon of Aphidna replaced him in 343/2, and Diophantus.  The Social War had plunged Athens into serious military and financial difficulties, thus creating an incentive to help the Athenian people by means of largesse.  It was established to provide enough money for poorer Athenian citizens to be able to purchase tickets for yearly festivals of public worship and theatrical productions, such as the [[Dionysia]], [[Panathenaic Festival|Panathenaea]], [[Eleusinian Mysteries|Eleusinia]] and [[Thargelia]]. A portion of the expense was defrayed by the individuals, upon whom the burden of {{lang|grc|λειτουργία}} devolved; but a considerable, and perhaps the larger, part was defrayed by the public [[treasury]].  The religious embassies to [[Delos]] and other places, and especially those to the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympian]], [[Nemean Games|Nemean]], [[Isthmian Games|Isthmian]], and [[Pythian Games]], drew largely upon public funds, though a part of the cost fell upon the wealthier citizens who conducted them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Friedrich Schömann]], ''Antiquitates juris publici Graecorum'' p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of money contributed to this treasury varied between “15 [http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Money.htm talents] or less and not much under 100 talents”.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, P. J. ''The Athenian Boule''. Oxford 1972: p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;  In an epitome (Dem. 1 hyp. 5) of [[Demosthenes]]’ [[Olynthiacs|''First Olynthiac'']], a scholar named [[Libanius]]&lt;ref&gt;Libanius’ explanation is accepted by some, but the information he provides is often questioned.  Edward M. Harris raises sound arguments for doubt in his book ''Democracy and the Rule of Law in Classical Athens'' (New York 2006):  “The road to historical error is often paved with good intentions.  Certainly no one had better intentions than the scholar Libanius…” (p. 121).&lt;/ref&gt;  explains that in Athens there were no stone seats (only wooden benches) at the [[Theatre of Dionysus]], and also originally no charge for admissions into the festival.  Due to the lack of seating available, fights would break out as everyone rushed to find a bench; the leaders of the community decided to charge an admissions fee of two [[Obolus|obols]] to prevent further violence.&lt;ref name="Blake 1926, p. 282"&gt;Blake, W. E. “New Literary Fragments on Demosthenes” Trans Proc Am Philol Assoc 57 (1926) p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; The fee was paid to the [[lessee]] of the theater (called {{lang|grc|Θεατρώνης}}, {{lang|grc|Θεατροπώλης}}, or {{lang|grc|ἀρχιτέκτων}}) who undertook to keep it in good repair, and constantly ready for use, on condition of being allowed to receive the profits.&lt;ref name="Schömann, p. 219"&gt;[[Georg Friedrich Schömann]], ''Id.'' p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;  But because poorer citizens could not afford to pay for admittance, Athens established a fund that covered the costs of their tickets.  Each citizen was allotted one [[drachma]] to cover the ticket cost of two obols (διωβελία) on each day of the three-day Dionysia.&lt;ref name="Blake 1926, p. 282"/&gt;   The payments would differ depending on the fluctuations of the state treasury and how many days the festivals lasted.

This payment continued to be exacted after the stone theater was built. [[Pericles]], to relieve the poorer classes, passed a law that enabled them to receive the price of admission from the state; after which all those citizens who were too poor to pay for their places applied for the money in the public assembly, which was then frequently held in the theater.&lt;ref name="Schömann, p. 219"/&gt;

In time this donation was extended to other entertainments besides theatrical ones: the sum of two [[Obolus|obols]] being given to each citizen who attended; if the festival lasted two days, four obols; and if three, six obols ; but not beyond that. Hence all theoric largesses received the name of ''diobelia'' ({{lang|grc|διωβελία}}).  The sums thus given varied at different times, and of course depended on the state of the public treasury.  These distributions of money, like those of grain and flour, were called ''dianomai'' ({{lang|grc|διανομαί}}), or ''diadoseis'' ({{lang|grc|διαδόσεις}}).  They were often made at the [[Dionysia]], when the allies were present, and saw the surplus of their tribute distributed from the orchestra.  The appetite of the people for largesses grew by encouragement, stimulated from time to time by designing [[demagogue]]s; and in the time of [[Demosthenes]] they seem not to have been confined to the poorer classes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Demosthenes]], ''Philip.'' iv. 141&lt;/ref&gt;  The German classical scholar [[Philipp August Böckh]] calculated that from 25 to 30 [[Talent (measurement)|talents]] were spent upon them annually.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philipp August Böckh]], ''The Public Economy of Athens'' p. 224, 2d ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Theoric Board ==

In the earlier times there was no person, or board of persons, expressly appointed to manage the Theoric fund.  The money thus appropriated was disbursed by the ''[[Hellenotamiai]]''.  After the anarchy, the largess system having been restored by [[Agyrrhius]], a board of managers was appointed, possibly consisting of ten men, who were called by many names ({{lang|grc|ἀρχὴ ἐπὶ τῷ θεωρικῷ}}, {{lang|grc|οἱ ἐπὶ τῷ θεωρικὸν τεταγμέμοι}} or {{lang|grc|κεχειροτονημένοι}}, {{lang|grc|θεωρικὴ ἀρχὴ}} &amp;c.).  They were elected by show of hands at the period of the great [[Dionysia]], one from each tribe,  and served four-year terms.  In the time of Eubulus many other branches of the administration were placed under the control of this board; as the management of the civil expenditure, the office of the ''[[Apodektai]]'', the building of docks, [[arsenal]]s, streets, &amp;c.  This was dictated by an anxiety on the part of the people that no part of the revenue should be improperly diverted from the Theoric fund, which they thought would be prevented by increasing the powers of its managers.  But these extraordinary powers appear not to have been of long continuance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aeschines]], ''Against Ctesiphon'' 57, ed. Steph.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Philipp August Böckh]], p. 170, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Friedrich Schömann]], ''Id.'' 320&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wachsmuth, ''Hellen. Alt.'' vol. ii. pt. i. pp. 124—127, 1st ed&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] explains:

“''All the officials concerned with civilian administration are appointed by lot, apart from the treasurer of the army fund (ταμίας στρατιωτικόν), the men in charge of the festival fund and the curator of the water supply; these are elected, and hold office from one [[Panathenaic Festival|Panathenaea]] to the next.''”  (Ath. Const. 43.1)

As public revenue greatly increased in the Athenian state, so too did the Theoric administration; according to Demosthenes there was an increase to as much as 400 talents a year from a previous amount of 130 talents (Phil. iv 37-8).  As a result of this growth the Theoric Board began to extend itself into a powerful position over other public works, activities and boards that were supervised by the [[Boule (ancient Greece)|βουλή]] (Council of Five Hundred).  The boule had previously controlled the state revenue and the expenditures, as well as the appropriations of monies to the magistrates, with the help of the different boards: the poletai (Auctions Board) and the apodektai (Board of Receivers).&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, M. H. ''The Athenian Democracy in the Age of Demosthenes''. Oxford 1991: p. 253; see also Arist. ''Ath. Const.'' 47.2-48.1.&lt;/ref&gt;   When the Theoric administration rose in power and worked together with the boule, it put the administration in a position where “it must have had a fair chance of securing for itself the lion’s share of the appropriations and possibly supplementing this share by a surplus”.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, M. H. “The Theoric Fund and the graphe paranomon against Apollodorus” GBS XVII (1976): p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;   The powerful position also enabled its board members to acquire confidential knowledge, information once only shared among those in the boule, on the activities of other departments.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, P. J. “Athenian Democracy After 403 BC” CJ 75.4 (April–May,1980): p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;   This weakened the monopoly of the boule and, as a result, the Theoric officials were able to gain supreme financial insight and replace the boule as the main resource of finances.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes ''Ath. Boule'' p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;   Men seeking popularity in Athens recognized this growth of power and influence as a source of great opportunity, and eventually the Theoric Board eclipsed and absorbed all other financial offices.&lt;ref&gt;Blake 282.&lt;/ref&gt;   Utilizing this power, the Theoric Board proceeded to oversee the leasing of mines, the financing of expensive public works, such as roads and buildings, and money for the Athenian navy. [[Aeschines]] scornfully describes this new monopoly of power in his speech ''Against [[Ctesiphon (orator)|Ctesiphon]]'':

“''…they [the Theoric Board] also controlled the dockyards, had charge of the naval arsenal that was building, and were Superintendents of Streets; almost the whole administration of the state was in their hands.''” (3.25)

== Demosthenes, Philip II, and the Stratiotika ==

Before the theorika was established, the stratiotika (τὰ στρατιωτικά), or Military (Stratiotic) Fund, received any remaining surplus revenue if Athens was at war; this provided financing for military expenditures.  But immediately after the Social War, all surplus revenue was allotted to the theorika until Demosthenes fought to have it redirected back to the stratiotika in 339/8.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes 105.&lt;/ref&gt;   Demosthenes was a strong proponent in the fight against the rising power of [[Philip II of Macedon]] and believed that all surplus monies should be used for military campaigns rather than for domestic public works; Eubulus, on the other hand, was very much against expensive foreign expeditions.  After the Social War Eubulus and his followers, the “peace party”, believed that the Athenian αρχή was no more, so they used the theorika to “restrain the [[Deme|demos]] from rash imperialistic adventures”&lt;ref&gt;Mader, Gottfried “Pax Duello Mixta: Demosthenes and the Rhetoric of War and Peace” CJ 101.1 (2005-6): p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  and to convince the people that peace was beneficial.  The theorika had become, in a sense, a psychological tool for this political party to repress the war mentality by exploiting the selfishness of the Athenians.  It was also a “crucial factor in the process of shaping and distorting perceptions”,&lt;ref&gt;Mader p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; which might explain the denial of Philip as an immediate threat, and also why the Athenians were more thorough in their organizations of festivals than with their own military (Dem. Phil. i 35-6).  In the ''First Olynthiac'', delivered in 349 BCE, Demosthenes complains that Athens has the means to fight Philip but would rather use its money for pleasure:

“''Such are my views on the expeditionary force.  With regard to the supply of money, you have money, men of Athens; you have more than any other nation has for military purposes.  But you appropriate it yourselves, to suit your own pleasure.  Now if you will spend it on the campaign, you have no need of a further supply; if not, you have--or rather, you have no supply at all.  ‘What!’ someone will cry, ‘do you actually move to use this money for military purposes?’  Of course I do not.  Only it is my opinion that we must provide soldiers and that there must be one uniform system of pay in return for service.  Your opinion, however, is that you should, without any trouble, just appropriate the money for your festivals.  Then the only alternative is a war-tax, heavy or light, as circumstances demand.  Only money we must have, and without money nothing can be done that ought to be done.  There are other proposals before you for raising supplies; choose whichever of them you think expedient, and, while there is yet time, grapple with the problem.''” (19-20)

Meanwhile a protective law had been passed in Athens illegalizing proposals on the use of the money in the theorika, especially if the suggestions were contradictory to the purpose of the fund (merismos).  Demosthenes’ caution when approaching the topic of the theorika in the ''First Olynthiac'' proves that such a law was in existence.  Also during this time, in the face of either resisting Philip to retrieve their possessions or betraying their allies and losing them, their [[Cleruchy|cleruchies]] and the [[Thracian Chersonese]], [[Apollodorus of Acharnae]] proposed in the boule (in which he was a member in 348 BCE) that the Athenian people should decide whether the surplus should be used for the theorika or the stratiotika  (Dem. 59.4 Against [[Neaira (hetaera)|Neaera]]).  The vote was unanimous that the money should be used for the stratiotika against Philip, but, because this type of proposition was still illegal, Apollodorus found himself being indicted by Stephanos of Eroiadai, who drew up a [[graphe paranomon]] (γραφή παρανόμων) against him; he was ultimately fined one talent and his decree was made null and void.&lt;ref&gt;Trevett, Jeremy ''Apollodorus the Son of Paison''. Oxford 1992: p. 138-9.&lt;/ref&gt;   Following this vote, Eubulus threatened death to anyone who tried to put the interests of the theorika below that of the stratiotika, making the act a capital offense.  After Apollodorus’ indictment and Eubulus’ new law, Demosthenes openly suggested in his ''Third Olynthiac'', a speech delivered in 349 BCE in lieu of Philip’s hostilities against [[Olynthus]], that the state get rid of the theorika because of its hampering effect upon their current crisis.  He also asked to eliminate military exemptions for those who ran the Dionysian festivals in Athens, as it was demoralizing for the men who wished to serve their country:

“''In plain language I mean the laws for administering the Theoric Fund, and also some of the service regulations.  The former distribute the military funds as theatre-money among those who remain in the city; the latter give impunity to deserters and in consequence discourage those willing to serve.  When you have repealed these laws and made the way safe for wise counsel, then look round for someone who will propose what you all know to be salutary measures.  But until you have done this, do not expect to find a statesman who will propose measures for your benefit, only to be ruined by you for his pains.  You will never find one, especially as the only result would be that the proposer would get into trouble without improving the situation, and his fate would also make good advice more dangerous for the future.  Yes, men of Athens, and you ought to insist that those who made these laws should also repeal them.''”  (3.10-11)

The idea of demoralization is echoed by Libanius.  Instead of being paid wages&lt;ref&gt;Libanius is incorrect here; hoplites did not receive payment for their military services (Harris 121).&lt;/ref&gt; for serving in the army and enduring the dangers of warfare, Athenian citizens preferred to stay home and attend the religious festivals.  Eubulus posed an argument two years after the ''First Olynthiac'' that the Athenians had to accept peace with Philip (the [[Peace of Philocrates]], which Aeschines supported), otherwise they would have to go to the [[Pireus|Piraeus]], pay a war-tax (eisphora) to finance the fleet and transfer the money from the theorika to the stratiotika (Dem. On the False Embassy 19.291).  Eubulus had laid out the different options for the Athenians: they could accept peace with Philip or, if they chose to continue the war, they would have to support it using their own means of financing.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, E. M. ''Democracy and the Rule of Law in Classical Athens''. Cambridge 2006: p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;   Demosthenes’ goal, by criticizing the theorika, was to snap the Athenians out of their denial and mistaken beliefs so that they could recognize the “absurd contradiction between domestic priorities and external exigencies, between the comfortable illusion of peace and the growing crisis in the north.”&lt;ref&gt;Mader p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the ''Fourth Philippic''&lt;ref&gt;Some modern scholars consider the Fourth Philippic to be inauthentic—otherwise it was probably delivered right after the Third Philippic in 341 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; Demosthenes’ attitude towards the theorika was changing:

“''Now there is also another matter, the misrepresentation of which by unfair obloquy and in intemperate language is injuring the State, and furthermore is affording a pretext for those who are unwilling to perform any of their duties as citizens; indeed, you will find that in every case where a man has failed to do his duty, this has been given as the excuse.  I am really afraid to speak on this subject, but I will do so nevertheless; for I think I shall be able, with advantage to the State, to plead the cause both of the poor against the rich and of the property-owners against the necessitous.  If we could banish from our midst both the obloquy which some heap upon the Theoric Fund, and also the fear that the Fund will not be maintained without doing a great deal of harm, we could not perform a greater service nor one more likely to strengthen the whole body politic.''” (4.35-37)

Demosthenes’ political party, the “war party”, had always “traditionally (especially in the great days of the Empire) been interventionist externally but ‘Athens-first’ internally.”&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, J. J. ''Theorika''. New York 1962: p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;   Seeing that the theorika was crucial to preserving social peace in Athens ([[Demades]], in [[Plutarch|Plutarch’s]] ''Mor. 1011b'', referred to it as the “glue of the democracy”), he needed to appeal to both worlds as an impartial arbiter.  In the ''Fourth Philippic'' he speaks on behalf of the poor in Athens, reminding the wealthy, who criticized the theorika at its inception, that when the public revenue did not exceed 130 talents a year they remained dutiful and paid their property taxes.  With the growth of revenue reaching 400 talents a year, the wealthy no longer felt the weight of financial responsibility upon their shoulders and it was of his opinion that the poor should be able to profit from the increase as well (Phil. iv 37-9).

In 339 BCE the situation in Athens became much more alarming than in 348 when Philip had attacked Olynthus and its allies, a matter Athens (excluding Demosthenes) did not consider an immediate threat. In 339 Philip had seized [[Elateia]] in [[Phocis]], which was a closer and more serious danger to Athens.  Demosthenes did not have any trouble persuading the Assembly to allocate all the public funds to the stratiotika and Philochorus, in a fragment preserved by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] (ad Ammaeus 1.11), further illustrates Demosthenes’ success:

“''The people, after listening to the letter [a letter of allegations Philip made against the Athenians] and to the exhortations of Demosthenes, who advocated war and framed the necessary resolutions, passed a resolution to demolish the column erected to record the treaty of peace and alliance with Philip, and further to man a fleet and in every other way to prosecute the war energetically.''”

== The Diminishment of the Theorika ==

The fact that Demosthenes did not face charges for breaking Eubulus’ law suggests that he was able to have the law repealed sometime around 339.  In the year 337/6 Demosthenes became the head of the theorika and donated 10,000 drachmas of his own money (Aesch. 3.24) while revenues were being funneled to the stratiotika; but his donations lasted only one year.  Upon the reinstitution of the theorika he attempted, through private gifts and a large festival, to make up for the privileges the Athenians had lost after adopting his financial policy.&lt;ref&gt;Blake p. 286-7.&lt;/ref&gt;   Shortly after Demosthenes’ promotion the Theoric Board was weakened by the law of Hegemon, which prohibited men from holding offices for more than four years; before this law, Theoric officials could be elected over and over again in successive terms.  Hegemon was a member of the opposition party along with Aeschines and Demades, and it is difficult to determine a political reason behind his law other than it was “an intended slap at Demosthenes”.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan p. 72-3.&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Lycurgus of Athens|Lycurgus]] had also become a rival for the boule’s control over finances and climbed the ladder of power until he assumed jurisdiction over the state’s treasury in 337/6 as the Controller of Finances (ὁ ἐπὶ τῆς διοικήσεως), which the Theoric Board had previously monopolized.  He governed this seat for twelve consecutive years until 326/5 when his and Demosthenes’ rival, [[Menesaechmus|Menesaichmus]], took over the position.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan p. 76-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its diminishment of powers, the Theoric Board existed in some way or another up until Aristotle’s ''Athenian Constitution'' (326-323 BCE).  Lycurgus was using most of the state’s income to pay for its defense, building projects, and religious festivals, which maintained some sense of the theorika’s continuation in Athens.  One of the last references to the theorika involved Demades’ notorious attempt at bribing the Athenians.  In 331 [[Agis III|King Agis III]] of Sparta persuaded Athens to join him in Sparta’s revolt against [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]].  The Athenians begged [[Demades]], who was then a member of the Theoric Board, to grant money to be used towards the deployment of [[trireme]]s to aid in the rebellion.  His response, as recorded in [[Plutarch|Plutarch’s]] ''Morals'' (Praecepta Gerendae Reipublicae 818 E-F), was:

“''You have money, for I have made provision for the Festival of the Pitchers that each of you receive a [http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Money.htm half-mina]; but if you prefer to use the money for this enterprise, use your own money for the Festival.''”&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan p. 80. (His translation)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Demades’ bribery successfully kept the Athenians from taking up arms against Alexander.

'''Thorvald Eiriksson''' ({{lang-non|Þōrvaldr Eirikssonr}}; {{lang-is|Þorvaldur Eiríksson}}) was the son of [[Erik the Red]] and brother of [[Leif Erikson]]. 
The only [[Medieval Period]] source material available regarding Thorvald Eiriksson are the two ''[[Vinland sagas]]''; the ''[[Greenland Saga]]'' and the ''[[Saga of Erik the Red]]''. Although differing in various detail, according to both sagas Thorvald was part of an expedition for the exploration of [[Vinland]] and became the first European to die in [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianmysteries.ca/sites/vinland/whereisvinland/thorvald/indexen.html|title=Thorvald Eiriksson (Þorvaldr Eiríksson)|publisher=Department of Canadian Heritage, Canadian Culture Online Initiative |date=|accessdate=October 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Greenland Saga'' describes a voyage made by [[Bjarni Herjolfsson]], and the subsequent voyages of Leif Eriksson, his brother Thorvald Eiriksson, his sister [[Freydís Eiríksdóttir]], and the Icelandic merchant [[Þorfinnr "Karlsefni" Þórðarson|Thorfinn Karsefni]]. The Saga describes hostilities with [[skraelings]], the Norse term for the native peoples they met in the lands visited south and west of [[Greenland]] which they called Vinland and [[Markland]]. The ''Saga of Erik the Red''  tells the story as a single expedition led by Thorfinn Karsefni. The voyage  of Thorvald Eriksson is told here as part of the Karlsefni expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mnh.si.edu/vikings/voyage/subset/vinland/sagas.html|title=Vinland Sagas|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|date=|accessdate=October 18, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223074433/https://www.mnh.si.edu/vikings/voyage/subset/vinland/sagas.html|archivedate=December 23, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vinča symbols''', sometimes called the '''Danube script''', '''Vinča signs''', '''Vinča script''', '''Vinča–Turdaș script''', '''Old European script''', etc., are a set of symbols found on [[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic era]] (6th to 5th millennia BC) artifacts from the [[Vinča culture]] of [[Central Europe]] and [[Southeastern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt; Haarmann 2010, 10: 5300 - 3200 BC.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
[[File:Vinca vessel.png|frame|A modern drawing of a clay vessel unearthed in [[Vinča]], found at depth of 8.5 meters.]]

In 1875, [[archaeology|archaeological]] excavations led by the Hungarian archeologist [[Zsófia Torma]] (1840–1899) at Tordos (today [[Turdaș]], Romania) unearthed a cache of objects inscribed with previously unknown symbols. In 1908, a similar cache was found during excavations conducted by Serbian archaeologist [[Miloje Vasić]] (1869–1956) in [[Vinča]], a suburb of [[Belgrade]] ([[Serbia]]), some 245&amp;nbsp;km from Turdaș. Later, more such fragments were found in [[Banjica]], another part of Belgrade. Since 1875, over one hundred and fifty Vinča sites have been identified in Serbia alone, but many, including Vinča itself, have not been fully excavated.&lt;ref&gt;Tasić, Nikola, Dragoslav Srejović, and Bratislav Stojanović. "Vinča: Centre of the Neolithic Culture of the Danubian Region". Belgrade: Centar za arheoloska istrazivanja Filozofskog fakulteta, 1990. http://www.rastko.rs/arheologija/vinca/vinca_eng.html (accessed 2009.06.22).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the culture of the whole area is called the [[Vinča culture]], and the symbols are often called{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} the '''Vinča–Turdaș script'''.

The discovery of the [[Tărtăria tablets]] in Romania by a team led by Nicolae Vlassa in 1961 reignited the debate. Vlassa believed the inscriptions to be [[pictograms]] and other items found at the same place were subsequently [[carbon dating|carbon-dated]] to before 4000 BC (the tablets themselves cannot be dated by physical or chemical methods&lt;ref&gt;Merlini, Marco; Lazarovici, Gheorghe: [http://arheologie.ulbsibiu.ro/publicatii/ats/ats8/acta%207.pdf Settling discovery circumstances, dating and utilization of the Tărtăria tablets] (PDF; 10.8&amp;nbsp;MB).

==Analysis==
===Objects incised with symbols===
Most of the inscriptions are on pottery, with the remainder appearing on ceramic [[spindle whorl]]s, [[figurine]]s, and a small collection of other objects.

===Symbols: description===
[[File:Vinca "M".jpg|thumb|right|Fragment of a clay vessel with an M-shaped incision.]]

The symbols themselves consist of a variety of abstract and representative [[pictogram]]s, including [[zoomorphic]] (animal-like) representations, combs or brush patterns and abstract symbols such as [[swastika]]s, crosses and [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]]s.

===Patterns; single and in groups===
Over 85% of the inscriptions consist of a single symbol. Other objects include groups of symbols, of which some are arranged in no particularly obvious pattern, with the result that neither the order nor the direction of the signs in these groups is readily determinable.

The usage of symbols varies significantly between objects: symbols that appear by themselves tend almost exclusively to appear on pots, while symbols that are grouped with other symbols tend to appear on whorls.

==Dating and importance==
The importance of these findings lies in the fact that the bulk of the Vinča symbols were created in the period between 4500 and 4000 BC, with the ones on the Tărtăria clay tablets possibly dating back to around 5300 BC (controversially dated by association).&lt;ref&gt;Haarmann, Harald: "Geschichte der Schrift", C.H. Beck, 2002, {{ISBN|3-406-47998-7}}, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the Vinča finds predate the proto-Sumerian pictographic script from [[Uruk]] (modern [[Iraq]]), which is usually considered to be the oldest known script, by more than a thousand years. Analyses of the symbols showed that they have little similarity with Near Eastern writing, leading to the view that these symbols and the Sumerian script probably arose independently.

===Single symbols, or complete texts?===
Although a large number of symbols are known, most artifacts contain so few symbols that they are very unlikely to represent a complete text. Possibly the only exception is the [[Sitovo inscription]] in [[Bulgaria]], the dating of which is disputed; regardless, even that inscription has only around 50 symbols.

===Language?===
It is unknown which [[language]] used the symbols, or indeed whether they stand for a language at all.

== Inventory ==
A database of Vinca inscriptions, DatDas, has been developed by Marco Merlini:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"DatDas organizes a catalogue of 5,421 actual signs. These are recorded from a corpus of 1,178 inscriptions composed of two or more signs and 971 inscribed artifacts (some finds have two or more inscriptions)."&lt;ref name="Merlini 2009"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.academia.edu/3035626/Introduction_to_the_Danube_script|title = Introduction to the Danube script|year = 2009|accessdate = 5 September 2013|website = Academia.edu|last = Merlini|first = Marco}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Meaning of the symbols ==
[[File:Tartaria amulet.png|frame|Clay tablet, one of the [[Tărtăria tablets]] unearthed near [[Săliştea, Alba|Tărtăria, Romania]], and dated to ca. 5300 BC (authenticity is disputed&lt;ref name="Qasim" /&gt;)]]
The nature and purpose of the symbols is a mystery. Although attempts have been made to interpret the symbols, there is no agreement as to what they might mean. At first it was thought that the symbols were simple property marks, meaning "this belongs to X". A prominent holder of this view is archaeologist [[Peter Biehl]]. This theory is now mostly abandoned, as the same symbols have been repeatedly found throughout the territory of the Vinča culture, in locations hundreds of kilometers and years away from each other. The prevailing theory is that the symbols were used for religious purposes in a traditional agricultural society. If so, the fact that the same symbols were used for centuries with little change suggests that the ritual meaning and culture represented by the symbols likewise remained constant for a very long time, with no need for further development. The use of the symbols appears to have been abandoned (along with the objects on which they appear) at the start of the [[Bronze Age]], suggesting that the new technology brought with it significant changes in social organization and beliefs.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

One argument in favour of the ritual explanation is that the objects on which the symbols appear do not seem to have had much long-term significance to their owners – they are commonly found in pits and other refuse areas.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Certain objects, principally figurines, are most usually found buried under houses. This is consistent with the supposition that they were prepared for household religious ceremonies in which the signs incised on the objects represent expressions: a desire, request, vow, etc. After the ceremony was completed, the object would either have no further significance (hence would be disposed of) or would be buried ritually (which some have interpreted as [[votive offering]]s).{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Some of the "comb" or "brush" symbols, which collectively compose as much as a sixth of all the symbols so far discovered, may represent numbers. Some scholars have pointed out that over a quarter of the inscriptions are located on the bottom of a pot, an ostensibly unlikely place for a religious inscription. The Vinča culture appears to have traded its wares quite widely with other cultures (as demonstrated by the widespread distribution of inscribed pots), so it is possible that the "numerical" symbols conveyed information about the value of the pots or their contents. Other cultures, such as the [[Minoans]] and [[Sumer]]ians, used their scripts primarily as accounting tools; the Vinča symbols may have served a similar purpose.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Other symbols (principally those restricted to the base of pots) are wholly unique. Such signs may denote the contents, provenance/destination or manufacturer/owner of the pot.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== Marija Gimbutas and Vinča as pre-writing ==
The primary advocate of the idea that the markings represent writing, and the person who coined the name "Old European Script", was [[Marija Gimbutas]] (1921–1994),&lt;ref name="Merlini 2009"/&gt; an important 20th century archaeologist and advocate of the hypothesis that the "[[Kurgan culture]]" (actually a cluster of many related cultures and horizons) of the [[Pontic steppe]] was the archaeological expression of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]]. She reconstructed a hypothetical [[Neolithic Europe|pre-Indo-European]] "Old European civilization", which she defines as having occupied the area between the Dniester valley and the Sicily-Crete line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Gimbutas, Marija |title= The Goddesses and Gods of Old Europe: 6500 to 3500 BCE: Myths and Cult Images |year=1974 |edition= 2nd |location= Berkeley |publisher= University of California Press |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gimbutas observed that [[neolithic]] European [[iconography]] was predominantly female—a trend also visible in the inscribed figurines of the Vinča culture—and concluded the existence of a "[[matristic]]" (woman-centered, but not necessarily [[matriarchal]]) culture that worshipped a range of goddesses and gods. (Gimbutas did not posit a single universal [[Mother goddess|Great Goddess]].) She also incorporated the Vinča markings into her model of Old Europe, suggesting that they might either be the writing system for an Old European language, or, more probably, a kind of "pre-writing" symbolic system. However, Vinča logographics themselves have not been found on an area wider than southeastern Hungary, western Romania, and western Bulgaria, as described by Winn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Winn, Shan M |title=Pre-writing in Southeastern Europe: The Sign System of the Vinča Culture ca. 4000 BCE |location= Calgary |publisher= Western Publishers |year=1981 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6079">''' Widukind of Corvey''' (c. 925{{spaced ndash}}after 973) was a medieval [[Saxons|Saxon]] chronicler. His three-volume ''[[Res gestae saxonicae sive annalium libri tres]]'' is an important chronicle of 10th-century [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]] during the rule of the [[Ottonian dynasty]].

==Life==
[[File:Corvey Westwerk.png|thumb|Corvey Abbey Church, westwork]]
In view of his name, he possibly was a descendant of the Saxon leader and national hero [[Widukind]], mentioned in the ''[[Royal Frankish Annals]]'', who had battled [[Charlemagne]] in the [[Saxon Wars]] from 777 to 785. Widukind the Chronicler entered the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] abbey of [[Corvey Abbey|Corvey]] in the [[Westphalia]]n part of [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] around 940/42, probably to become a [[tutor]]. It is widely assumed that he had reached the age of 15 upon his access, though it has been recently suggested that he may have joined the Order as a child. In 936 [[Henry the Fowler]], the first [[East Francia|East Frankish]] king of the Saxon ducal Ottonian dynasty had died and was succeeded by his son [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto the Great]].

Otto's rise as undisputed ruler of a German kingdom against the reluctant [[stem duchy|dukes]] made great impression on the Benedictine monk. By his own admission, Widukind first wrote several Christian [[Hagiography|hagiographies]] before he began his ''Res gestae saxonicae''. He dedicated the chronicles to Abbess [[Matilda, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Matilda of Quedlinburg]] (c. 955{{ndash}}999), daughter of Emperor [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto the Great]], like himself a descendant of the Saxon leader Widukind. The annals were written after Otto's coronation by [[Pope John XII]] on 2 February 962; however, though both Otto and his father Henry the Fowler are named ''[[Imperator]]es'', this incident is not mentioned. After the elevation of Matilda's brother [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]] as co-emperor in 967 and the death of her half-brother Archbishop [[William (Archbishop of Mainz)|William of Mainz]] one year later, the abbess remained the only important member of the Ottonian dynasty in the Saxon lands under regent [[Hermann Billung]]; therefore, Widukind may have begun the writing—or started all over again—to create a kind of [[mirrors for princes|mirror for princes]].

The annals were continued until Otto's death on 7 May 973. Widukind probably died thereafter at Corvey Abbey.

==Work==
{{main|The Deeds of the Saxons}}
The ''Res gestae saxonicae'' are significant historical accounts of the times of Otto the Great and Henry the Fowler, modelled on the works of the Roman historian [[Sallust]] and the deuterocanonical [[Books of the Maccabees]]. Widukind wrote as a Saxon, proud of his people and history, beginning his narration not with the [[Roman Empire]] but with a brief synopsis derived from the orally-transmitted history of the Saxons and their struggles with the [[Franks]], with a terseness that makes his work difficult to interpret.

Widukind of Corvey starts with the wars between [[Theuderich I]], King of [[Austrasia]], and the [[Thuringii]], in which the Saxons played a large part. An allusion to the conversion of the Saxons to Christianity under Charlemagne brings him to the early Saxon dukes and details of the reign of Henry the Fowler. He omitted Italian events in tracing the career of Henry, nor does he ever mention a pope, but one of the three surviving manuscripts of his ''Gesta'' was transcribed in [[Duchy of Benevento|Benevento]], the Lombard duchy south of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evellum.com/ductus/demo/engine/ductus/frames/bibliography/lowe_loew1972a.html Evellum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040526032651/http://www.evellum.com/ductus/demo/engine/ductus/frames/bibliography/lowe_loew1972a.html |date=2004-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second book opens with the election of Otto the Great as German king, treats of the risings against his authority, again omitting events in Italy, and concludes with the death of his first wife [[Eadgyth|Edith of England]] in 946.

A manuscript of ''Res gestae saxonicae sive annalium libri tres''  was first published in Basle in 1532 and is today in the [[British Library]]. There are two other surviving manuscripts. The best edition was published in 1935 by Paul Hirsch and Hans-Eberhard Lohmann in the series ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]: Scriptores rerum Germanicarum in usum scholarum editi''. A German translation appears in the ''Quellen zur Geschichte der sächsischen Kaiserzeit'' published by Albert Bauer and Reinhold Rau in 1971. An English translation is found in an unprinted doctoral dissertation: Raymond F. Wood, ''The three books of the deeds of the Saxons, by Widukind of Corvey, translated with introduction, notes, and bibliography'' (University of California, Los Angeles, 1949).&lt;ref&gt;Raymund F. Wood, The three books of the Deeds of the Saxons, unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of California, Berkeley, 1949, [http://search.proquest.com/docview/301830925 available from ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses]&lt;/ref&gt;

Widukind is also credited with a ''vita'' of St Paul and St Thecla doubtless based on the 2nd century ''[[Acts of Paul and Thecla]]'', but no traces of it now remain.
