      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31714">'''Anthropomorphic wooden cult figurines''', sometimes called '''pole gods''', have been found at many [[Archaeology|archaeological]] sites in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Northern Europe]]. They are generally interpreted as [[cult image]]s, in some cases presumably depicting deities, sometimes with either a [[votive offering|votive]] or an [[apotropaic]] (protective) function. Many have been preserved in [[peat bog]]s. The majority are more or less crudely worked poles or forked sticks; some take the form of carved planks. They have been dated to periods from the [[Mesolithic]] to the Early [[Middle Ages]], including the [[Roman Era]] and the [[Migration Age]]. The majority have been found in areas of [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] settlement, but some are from areas of [[Celts|Celtic]] settlement and from the later part of the date range, [[Slavs|Slavic]] settlement. A typology has been developed based on the large number found at [[Oberdorla]], [[Thuringia]], at a sacrificial bog which is now the [[Opfermoor Vogtei]] [[open-air museum]].

The oldest of the figures is the Mesolithic find from [[Willemstad]] in the Netherlands and the latest is 13th-century, but most date from between c. 500 [[BCE]] and 500 [[Common Era|CE]]. They are found as far west as Ireland (although at least one found in the British Isles, the [[Strata Florida]] figure from Wales, was imported) and as far east as Gorbunovo Moor in Russia. By far the majority were preserved in wetlands of some sort; however, only one figure&amp;mdash;from the late [[Bronze Age]] settlement at [[Wasserburg Buchau]], near [[Bad Buchau]] in [[Baden-Württemberg]], Germany&amp;mdash;has been found in the [[stilt house|lake village]] culture of the Alps.&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Menotti, ''Wetland Archaeology and Beyond: Theory and Practice'', Oxford: Oxford University, 2012, {{ISBN|9780199571017}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9GXUfYTtbfMC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=Broddenbjerg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=K5YDUueZN4TziQLI_4GQDw&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=plank-shaped%20figures%20placed%20along%20trackways%20and%20believed%20to%20have%20had%20protective%20properties&amp;f=false pp. 193&amp;ndash;94].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background and development===
[[File:Nationalmuseet - Cophenaghne - Male figure.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Broddenbjerg idol]], a figure made from a forked stick (Type 2) and dated to approximately 535&amp;ndash;520 [[BCE]]]]
The earliest evidence of anthropomorphic wooden cult figures in areas that would later have Germanic-speaking inhabitants is from the [[Bronze Age]]. The [[Broddenbjerg idol]], an [[ithyphallic]] forked-stick figure found in a peat bog near [[Viborg, Denmark]], is [[Carbon dating|carbon-dated]] to approximately 535&amp;ndash;520 [[BCE]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klaus-ebbesen.dk/fund.htm "Guden fra Broddenbjerg"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215610/http://www.klaus-ebbesen.dk/fund.htm |date=2013-10-04 }}, Nyt fra fortiden {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Braak Bog Figures]], a male and female forked-stick pair found in a peat bog at [[Braak]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], have been dated to the 2nd to 3rd centuries BCE but also as early as the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda J.

One figure has been found on dry land, in a ditch complex on a hillside at [[Bad Doberan]], [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Müller-Wille, ''Opferkulte der Germanen und Slawen'', ''Archäologie in Deutschland'', Sonderheft, Stuttgart: Theiss, 1999, {{ISBN|9783806214437}}, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=lNU4UrHoDoGnigLsyoHADQ&amp;id=zcAoAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Opferkulte+der+Germanen+und+Slaven%2C+Bad+Doberan&amp;q=Bad+Doberan#search_anchor p. 28] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The great majority of the figurines are markedly more abstract than other artistic artefacts of their time. The 5th-6th century seated figure from the Rude-Eskilstrup bog in [[Munke Bjergby parish]], [[Zealand]], Denmark, is unusually detailed: it has a triple neck-ring or collar, a kirtle and a pronounced chin or beard, and resembles a bronze figure found at [[Bregneburg]] on [[Funen]].&lt;ref&gt;Bente Magnus, ''Men, Gods and Masks&amp;mdash;in Nordic Iron Age Art'', Ten thousand years of folk art in the North; Nordic iron age art 1, Cologne: König, 2006, {{ISBN|9783883759852}}, Plate 55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilda Ellis Davidson|H.

[[Tacitus]] states in ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' that the Teutons did not have idols depicting their gods, yet describes the annual parading of an image of the goddess [[Nerthus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' 9.6: ''Ceterum nec cohibere parietibus deos neque in ullam humani oris speciem adsimulare ex magnitudine caelestium arbitrantur'' - "The Germans, however, do not consider it consistent with the grandeur of celestial beings to confine the gods within walls, or to liken them to the form of any human countenance." ''Germania'' 40: ''mox vehiculum et vestis et, si credere velis, numen ipsum secreto lacu abluitur'' - "Afterwards the car, the vestments, and, if you like to believe it, the divinity herself, are purified in a secret lake." Trans. Alfred John Church and William Jackson Brodribb, ''The Agricola and Germany of Tacitus'', London: Macmillan, 1868, {{OCLC|776555615}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably Tacitus did not recognise the simpler cult images made by the Teutons as equivalent to the more fully developed images used by Romans, or was unaware of them.

The [[Old Norse]] term for a god ''[[Æsir|áss]]'' (the singular of ''Æsir''; derived from the [[Common Germanic]] root *ans, *ansuz and also recorded for [[Gothic language|Gothic]] as the Latin plural ''Anses'' by [[Jordanes]]) has a homonym meaning "pole" or "beam". [[Jacob Grimm]] proposed that as the origin of the "god word" and the etymology was accepted by some scholars;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacob Grimm]], ''[[Deutsche Mythologie|Teutonic Mythology]]'', tr. James Steven Stallybrass, 4 vols., Volume 3, London: Bell, 1882, repr. New York: Dover, [1966], {{OCLC|378881}}, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan de Vries (linguist)|Jan de Vries]], ''Altgermanische Religionsgeschichte'', 2 vols., Volume 2 ''Die Götter &amp;ndash; Vorstellungen über den Kosmos &amp;ndash; Der Untergang des Heidentums'', Grundriß der germanischen Philologie 12.2, 2nd ed. Berlin: de Gruyter, 1957, repr. as 3rd ed. 1970, {{OCLC|769214225}} p. 9, note 1 {{de icon}} has a bibliography of that and rival etymologies.&lt;/ref&gt; it would suggest that the word is derived from god-images in pole form, but relating it to the Indian ''[[asuras]]'' as a term of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] origins is equally plausible.&lt;ref&gt;"Æsir", [[Rudolf Simek]], ''Dictionary of Northern Mythology'', tr. Angela Hall, Woodbridge, Suffolk: Brewer, 1993, {{ISBN|9780859915137}}, repr. 2000 p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the wooden figures take the form of a simple pole or post, sometimes set up in a heap of stones.&lt;ref name=Simek&gt;"Pole gods", Simek, ''Dictionary of Northern Mythology'', p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- These have been related to the stone altar or [[Hörgr|hǫrgr]]. --&gt;

The more complex figures made of carved forked sticks recall the "wooden people" or "tree-men" of the [[Eddic poem]] "[[Hávamál]]":

Other more or less contemporary texts also attest to wooden cult figurines in [[Norse religion|Scandinavian paganism]]. Christian missionary writings refer disparagingly to wooden 'idols', such as the figure of the god [[Freyr]] in ''[[Gunnars þáttr helmings]]''.&lt;ref name=Simek/&gt; In [[Ibn Fadlan]]'s early 10th-century account of the [[Volga Vikings]], he writes that as soon as they come into harbour, they leave their ships with food and alcoholic drink and offer them at a tall piece of wood with the face of a man carved in it, which is surrounded by smaller similar figures.&lt;ref&gt;James E. Montgomery, [http://www.uib.no/jais/v003ht/03-001-025Montgom1.htm "Ibn Faḍlān and the Rūsiyyah"], ''Journal of Arabic and Islamic Studies'' 3, 2000: "This piece of wood has a face like the face of a man and is surrounded by small figurines behind which are long pieces of wood set up in the ground."&lt;/ref&gt; Such an arrangement has been found at sites such as the Oberdorla sacrificial bog.

The mentions in [[Icelandic sagas]] of ''[[Öndvegissúlur]]'' carved with the images of gods, in particular [[Thor]] and [[Freyr]], and of other idols, may be related but have been influenced by Christian concepts since the sagas were written down in the 12th to 14th centuries, centuries after the heathen period. More clearly related is the extremely large post hole which forms the focal point of the "grandstand" at the 6th to 7th-century Anglo-Saxon royal hall site of [[Yeavering]]: with a side length of {{convert|56|cm|in}} and a depth of approximately {{convert|1.2|m|ftin}}, it indicates a pillar of considerable size, presumably a cult pillar of some sort.&lt;ref&gt;''RACAR'' 23&amp;ndash;25 (1998) [https://books.google.com/books?ei=R3xMUpjhJ4eliQLmz4HYDg&amp;id=sQvlAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Yeavering+post+hole+56&amp;q=Judging+by+the+evidence+of+the+posthole%2C+the+Yeavering+pillar+was+56-57+cm+square%3B+it+was+probably+of+considerable+height+also%2C+as+the+posthole+measures+1+.2+m+in+depth#search_anchor 4].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisbeth Margaret Thoms, ''Settlements in Scotland 1000 BC&amp;ndash;AD 1000'', Edinburgh: Edinburgh University, 1980, {{ISBN|9780852243633}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vXgDAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Yeavering+post+hole+grandstand&amp;dq=Yeavering+post+hole+grandstand&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XXtMUqeWHuKrigKGi4DABQ&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBA p. 48].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Max Adams, ''The King in the North: The Life and Times of Oswald of Northumbria'', New York: Head of Zeus, 2013, {{ISBN|9781781854174}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TVI-AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT127&amp;dq=Yeavering+post+hole&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=b3lMUrP6DcXNigL004HYAg&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Yeavering%20post%20hole&amp;f=false n.p.] suggests a Frankish ''staffolus''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forms and material===
[[Günter Behm-Blancke]] classified the anthropomorphic figurines into four groups based on the finds at Oberdorla:

* '''Type 1'''. Poles or posts, sometimes equipped with a [[phallus]], as at Oberdorla; a variant form from Possendorf, [[Weimar]], (now lost)&lt;ref&gt;The Possendorf figure was about {{convert|90|cm|in}} tall and probably from the 2nd century BCE. Wijnand van der Sanden, tr. Susan J. Mellor, ''Through Nature to Eternity: The Bog Bodies of Northwest Europe'', Amsterdam: Batavian Lion, 1996, {{ISBN|9789067074186}}, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; has a carved head and attached raised arms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Günter Behm-Blancke]], "Materielle und geistige Kultur. Stammesgebiete im 1. und 2. Jahrhundert: Kult und Ideologie", in Bruno Krüger, ''et al''., ed., ''Die Germanen: Geschichte und Kultur der germanischen Stämme in Mitteleuropa. Ein Handbuch in zwei Bänden'', Volume 1 ''Von den Anfängen bis zum 2. Jahrhundert unserer Zeitrechnung'', Veröffentlichungen des Zentralinstituts für Alte Geschichte und Archäologie der Akademie der Wissenschaften der DDR 4, Berlin: Akademie, 1976, {{OCLC|256529450}}, pp. 351–71, p. 369 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Type 2'''. Formed from a forked stick, with a head carved out at the top. Those found at Oberdorla are all female; in North Germany and Scandinavia, [[ithyphallic]] male figures are also found, such as the [[Broddenbjerg idol]] from near [[Viborg, Denmark]] and the more artistically developed male and female [[Braak Bog Figures]] from [[Schleswig-Holstein]].&lt;ref name=Maringer/&gt; Sizes range from approximately {{convert|1|to|3|m|ftin}}.&lt;ref&gt;Behm-Blancke, pp. 369&amp;ndash;71.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Type 3'''. Carved from a broad plank cut in silhouette with blank faces, males with rectangular bodies, females with breasts or shoulders indicated by a slanted cut, broad hips and [[vulva]]. Found at Oberdorla and at the [[Wittemoor timber trackway]] ([[corduroy road]]) in [[Berne, Germany|Berne]], [[Lower Saxony]], these are thought to have had an [[apotropaic]] (protective) purpose.&lt;ref name=BehmBlancke371&gt;Behm-Blancke, p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Menotti, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Type 4'''. Carved from a squared piece of timber with an inclined head and a base, similar to a [[Herma|herm]]. One of this type was found at Oberdorla, in a late [[La Tène]] context.&lt;ref name=BehmBlancke371/&gt;

Most of the figures which have been preserved are of [[oak]], which was probably preferred for its endurance in the mostly wet locations where they were deposited.

===Interpretations===
[[File:Wittemoor Stelen.jpg|thumb|upright|Female (left) and male (right) plank figures (Type 3) from the [[Wittemoor timber trackway]]]]
It is impossible to determine the exact purpose of the figurines, or their relationship to the named Germanic gods and goddesses, with whose worship they overlap; examples are found dating to as late as the [[Viking Age]]. We cannot determine how typical those which have happened to survive and be found, or their locations, are; and our surviving written sources of information on [[Germanic paganism]] are likewise incomplete.&lt;ref&gt;Torsten Capelle and Bernhard Maier, "Idole, Idolatrie", in ''[[Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde]]'', 2nd ed., Volume 15, Berlin / New York: de Gruyter, 2000, {{ISBN|3-11-016649-6}}, pp. 325&amp;ndash;30, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; They have been interpreted, in particular by Behm-Blancke, as the site of fertility sacrifices, based on the indications of male and female sexual characteristics and the frequent association with potsherds and the bones of animals and, at Oberdorla, of humans. They may originate in a phallus cult, although there are few indications of such a cult in Germanic paganism. Alternatively, since the veneration of pillars extends beyond the Germanic cultural area, they may originate in the belief in the [[world pillar]] (as seen in the Saxon [[Irminsul]] and the Old Norse [[Yggdrasill]]) and thus derive from an archaic tree cult.&lt;ref name=Simek/&gt;

[[Heiko Steuer]] has suggested that in the case of the male and female Wittemoor figures, which stood on either side of a plank causeway through a marsh, there may have been a secular decorative motive in addition to the spiritual luck-bringing and warding (apotropaic) functions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Heiko Steuer]], "Über anthropomorphe Moorpfähle der vorrömischen Eisenzeit", in ''Studien zur Lebenswelt der Eisenzeit: Festschrift für Rosemarie Müller'', ed. Wolf-Rüdiger Teegen, Rosemarie Müller, Rosemarie Cordie, Olaf Dörrer and Heiko Steuer, ''Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde'', Ergänzungsband 53, Berlin / New York: de Gruyter, 2006, {{ISBN|978-3-11-019010-6}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celtic-speaking areas==
Relatively few figurines have been found in areas of [[Celts|Celtic]]-speaking settlement, and because of overlap with Germanic-speaking settlement, particularly in the [[North Sea]] region,&lt;ref&gt;[[Helmut Birkhan]], ''Kelten. Versuch einer Gesamtdarstellung ihrer Kultur'', 2nd ed.

A fragment of an anthropomorphic figurine made of oak dating to the 2nd century BCE was found in a possibly sacrificial shaft inside a [[Viereckschanze]] enclosure in the Schmiden section of [[Fellbach]] in Baden-Württemberg, Germany.

A late [[Bronze Age]] wooden figure found at [[Ralaghan]], [[County Cavan]], Ireland, referred to as [[Ralaghan Man]], has a genital opening containing a piece of white quartz, which may represent a vulva or have been the attachment point for a penis.&lt;ref&gt;Aldhouse Green, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ryWnvqQCFc4C&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=Ralaghan+Bronze&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zWZLUtv1OY3ligK254GYCw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ralaghan%20Bronze&amp;f=false p. 78].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, an almost lifesize female figure carved out of an oak log was found near [[Ballachulish]] in Scotland.

[[Saxo Grammaticus]] describes the [[Temple at Arkona]] as containing a great four-headed idol, far taller than a man.&lt;ref&gt;[[Saxo Grammaticus]], ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' 14.39: Norbert Reiter, ''Das Glaubensgut der Slawen im europäischen Verbund'', Slavistische Studienbücher NF 21, Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2009, {{ISBN|9783447060943}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iJ4wBBzSt-YC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=Saxo+Grammaticus,+Arkona&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zH9LUp2CB8SYiAK7lIH4Ag&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=ein%20sehr%20gro%C3%9Fes%20Standbild&amp;f=false p. 100] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Slavic anthropomorphic figures do not occur until the 10th century, presumably under the influence of neighbouring cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Brather, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YwT1e6S-Yg4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Brather,+Die+Arch%C3%A4ologie+der+westlichen+Slawen&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2HpLUpq9Eq_wiQLCh4DAAg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Anthropomorphe%20G%C3%B6tter%20lassen%20sich%20bei%20den%20Slawen%20insgesamt%20erst%20seit%20dem%2010.%20Jahrhundert&amp;f=false p. 320].&lt;/ref&gt;

Sebastian Brather distinguishes between idols in plank and pole form. He regards the former as primarily [[Votive offering|votive]] in purpose,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} like those described by Saxo and by others including [[Thietmar of Merseburg]], but their identification with specific deities can only be speculation. Also, as with Celtic and Germanic, Slavic paganism was not universally standardised but included decentralisaed, local cult centres and practices, of which the wooden images would have formed a part.&lt;ref&gt;Leszek Słupecki, "The temple in Rhetra-Riedegost: West Slavic pagan ritual as described at the beginning of eleventh century", in ''Old Norse Religion in Long-Term Perspectives'', pp. 224&amp;ndash;28, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gjq6rvoIRpAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Old+Norse+Religion+in+Long-Term+Perspectives&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tY5LUrfwFsKZiQKR84HIAg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=most%20probably%20every%20political%20unit%20had%20its%20own%20cult%20centre&amp;f=false p. 224].&lt;/ref&gt;

Leszek Słupecki considers the figure from Fischerinsel near Neubrandenburg one of the most significant Slavic idols. Dated to the 11th&amp;ndash;12th century, it takes the form of a two-headed male bust mounted on a column of hewn oak, and is {{convert|178|cm|ftin}} high. The beard, eyes, and nose are emphasised.&lt;ref&gt;Photograph, Herbert Schutz, ''Tools, Weapons and Ornaments: Germanic Material Culture in Pre-Carolingian Central Europe, 400&amp;ndash;750'', Northern World 1, Leiden / Boston: Brill, 2001, {{ISBN|9789004122987}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=r-DLX9PPEFoC&amp;pg=PR14&amp;dq=Fischerinsel+two-headed&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BopLUuiSIKmniALbkIG4AQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Fischerinsel%20two-headed&amp;f=false Plate 50, p. 53].&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only multi-headed sculpture extant from a Slavic region, but the location of the find does not indicate any sort of temple or shrine.&lt;ref&gt;Leszek Paweł Słupecki, tr.

'''Azerbaijanis in Russia''' or '''Russian Azerbaijanis''' ({{lang-az|Rusiya azərbaycanlıları}} (Latin), Русија азәрбајҹанлылары (Cyrillic); {{lang-ru|Азербайджанцы в России}}, ''Azerbajdzhanchy v Rossii'') are [[Azerbaijani people]] in the [[Russia|Russian Federation]], and are Russian citizens or permanent residents of ethnic Azerbaijani background.
Aside from the large Azeri community native to Russia's [[Dagestan Republic]], the majority of '''Azeris in Russia''' are fairly recent immigrants. Azeris started settling in Russia (with the exception of Dagestan) around the late nineteenth century, but their migration intensified after [[World War II]], and especially after the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991. According to the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 All-Russian Population Census]], there are 603,070 Azeris residing in Russia, however the actual numbers may be much higher due to the arrival of guest workers in the post-Soviet era. The estimated total Azeri population of Russia as of 2002 might have reached as many as 3,000,000 people,&lt;ref name="eurasianet"&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/rights/articles/eav111102.shtml Azerbaijan Acts to Limit the Discrimination Against Azeris in Russia] by Nailia Sohbetqizi.

===Azerbaijanis in Derbent===
After the disintegration of the [[Caliphate]], the city of Derbent and the surrounding area (currently the [[Derbentsky District|Derbent Rayon]]) became an independent emirate closely allied with the neighbouring state of [[Shirvan]] (present day northeastern [[Azerbaijan]]). During this period, the emirate became destination for the migration of numerous [[Turkic peoples|Turkic tribes]]. This factor, as well as the influence of the [[Seljuq Empire]], ensured the spread of an [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz Turkic idiom]] in Derbent already in the eleventh century.&lt;ref name="mag1"&gt;Magomedkhan Magomedkhanov.

Russian Academy of Sciences, Dagestan Science Centre.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mongol invasions of Chechnya|Mongol invasion]] put an end to the emirate's independence for the next two centuries. In the fifteenth century, [[Ibrahim I of Shirvan|Ibrahim I]], who hailed from Derbent, became the new ruler of Shirvan and incorporated Derbent into Shirvan.&lt;ref&gt;Barthold, W., C.E.

The ethnic make-up of Derbent remained unchanged until the city became part of the [[Safavid Empire]] in the early sixteenth century. The Safavid rule was characterised with active resettlement policies, aimed at securing Shia Muslim dominance in the conquered lands. In 1509, 500 Karamanli Turkic families from [[Tabriz]] settled in Derbent. An unknown number of Turkic-speakers from the Kurchi tribe were resettled her in 1540. Half a century later, 400 more families of the Turkic-speaking [[Bayat (name)|Bayat clan]] were relocated to Derbent on the orders of [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]]. Finally, in 1741, [[Nadir Shah]] relocated Turkic-speakers from the Mikri clan to Derbent. It is noteworthy that by 1870 the settlers were all regarded as speaking a common language, Azeri.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2tI6AQAAIAAJ Notes of the Caucasus Department of the Russian Imperial Geographical Society]; p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their Shia adherence, the new migrants were referred to by contemporary historians as ''Persians'' ({{lang-ru|персияне}}), a term that was erroneously applied to Shia Azeris of Dagestan way into the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Y.

The northern part of the Derbent Rayon was historically populated by the Tarakama, a Turkic-speaking people akin to the [[Karapapak]], who were sometimes classified as a separate ethnic group until the twentieth century. In Dagestan, they are also sometimes referred to as Padars. The Tarakama originated in various parts of Shirvan and were resettled by Khan Muhammad of Kaitag to the north of the city of Derbent around 1600. From then on, the area inhabited by them has been referred to as the Tarakama mahal (district) and constituted an administrative unit until the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Abbasgulu Bakikhanov]].

Such assimilation notably affected not only Turkic-speaking peoples of Dagestan. In the past, southern Dagestan had a large [[Tat people (Caucasus)|Tat]] population which originally spoke an [[Tat language (Caucasus)|Iranian language]] like other Tats. In 1866, they numbered 2,500 people&lt;ref name="mag1"/&gt; and by 1929 lived in seven villages, including Zidyan, Bilgadi, Verkhny Chalgan, and Rukel.&lt;ref name="miller"&gt;Boris Miller.

===Azerbaijanis in Tabasaran===
{{Azerbaijanis}}
In the historical region of [[Tabasaransky District|Tabasaran]], ethnic Azeris populate the left bank of the Rubas river. The growth and establishment of ethnic Azeris in this region has heavily depended on assimilation processes. In 1876, many [[Tabasaran people|Tabasarans]] were already in the process of switching from [[Tabasaran language|Tabasaran]] to Azeri as their first language.&lt;ref&gt;N. Dzhidalaev. ''Trends of Functional Language Development in Pre-Revolution Dagestan''. Makhachkala: RAS DSC, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, from the Middle Ages, the population of a number of villages in Tabasaran, namely Arablyar, Gimeidi, Darvag, Yersi, and Kemakh consisted of [[Arabs in the Caucasus|ethnic Arabs]] who were gradually being absorbed by the neighbouring population, mainly Azeri, such as in Yersi. In 1929, Kemakh was listed among Tat-populated villages, whereas Gimeidi (abandoned in 1976) was described as mixed Tat and Azeri. These Tats, in turn, were assimilated by Azeris in the following decades. Arablyar, which is now part of the [[Kurakhsky District|Kurakh Rayon]], currently has mixed [[Lezgian people|Lezgian]] and Azeri population.&lt;ref name="miller"/&gt; Residents of Darvag retained the knowledge of [[Shirvani Arabic|Arabic]] as a first language until the 1930s, after which they also integrated linguistically and ethnically into the Azeri surrounding.&lt;ref&gt;Zelkina, Anna. Arabic as a Minority Language. Walter de Gruyter, 2000; p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently ethnic Azeris constitute majority in the villages of Maraga, Hili-Pendzhik (including the settlement of Yekrag), Tsanak, Arak, Yersi, Darvag, and Zil. The villages of Arkit and Khurvek, as well the district capital Khuchni are mixed Azeri and Tabasaran. Azeris of Tsanak, Arak, Yersi, and Khuchni are normally bilingual in Azeri and Tabasaran, showing preference for Tabasaran when talking to their Tabasaran neighbours even if the latter know Azeri.&lt;ref name="mag1"/&gt;

===Azerbaijanis in Rutul===
Nizhny Katrukh is the only Azeri village in the [[Rutulsky District|Rutul Rayon]]. Azeris of Nizhny Katrukh consider themselves descendants of the people of Shirvan who were captured by the mountaineers during one of their raids into the plains around 1700, taken to the [[Shamkhalate of Kazi-Kumukh]] (a [[Lak people (Dagestan)|Lak]] state of the time) and made subjects of the Shamkhal. According to a local legend, only two of the original seven settlers were Azeri, though it was the Azeri identity that came to dominate.&lt;ref name="lavrov"&gt;Leonid Lavrov (ed.).

Georgian Academy of Sciences. Metsniereba, 1983; p. 409&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1861, the first secular school in Southern Dagestan opened in the Lezgian village of [[Akhty]], and Azeri was taught there along with Russian.&lt;ref&gt;K. Ramazanov, A. Shikhsaidov. ''Essays on History of Southern Dagestan''. Dagestani Branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences. Makhachkala, 1964; pp. 262-265&lt;/ref&gt; The learned masses preferred to use [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in formal communication, which is why in 1920, Arabic was chosen over the largely unwritten indigenous languages of Dagestan as a means of public education. The atheist policies of the Soviet government, however, attempted to eliminate religion from everyday life. Arabic soon became seen as a link between the Dagestanis and their Islamic heritage. Thus in 1923, Azeri became the language of education in all of Dagestan. According to Alibek Takho-Godi, Dagestani [[People's Commissar]] (minister) of Justice in the 1920s (himself of [[Dargwa people|Dargwa]] origin), local Nakh-Dagestani languages were "not taken seriously as a means of nation-building due to their excessive number."&lt;ref name="mag1"/&gt; Azeri retained its status until 1928, when education in other local languages, as well as in Russian, was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Dalby. [Dictionary of Languages: The Definitive Reference to More Than 400 Languages]. Columbia University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Azeri remained as the most popular second language in Southern Dagestan at least until the 1950s,&lt;ref name="sergeyeva"/&gt; spoken with various degrees of popularity as far north as in the [[Tindi people|Tindi]] villages of [[Tsumadinsky District|Tsumada]].&lt;ref name="tsumada"&gt;[http://www.tsumada.ru/en/text/1086 The Tindi People]. ''Tsumada.ru''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is noteworthy that historically among Tindis&lt;ref name="tsumada"/&gt; and especially Aghuls, who lived relatively far from the Azeri settlements, usually only males spoke Azeri or any second language; and only those who visited the lowlands for seasonal labour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lib7.com/kavkaz/1139-semeinui-agylu.html Social and Family Relationships among Aghuls].&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1950s, the use of Azeri as a common second language and lingua franca has been in decline, as it could no longer compete with [[Russian language|Russian]].&lt;ref name="mag1"/&gt; As of 2010, 13,648 Lezgians (2.93%), 5,665 Tabasarans (3.96%), 3,105 Avars (0.35%), and 1,379 Dargwa (0.24%) living in Russia claimed speaking Azeri, mostly as a second language (the figures in brackets indicate the percentage of the speakers of Azeri in relation to the overall ethnic population that reported language command).&lt;ref name="langcomm"&gt;[http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/perepis2010/croc/Documents/Vol4/pub-04-06.pdf ВЛАДЕНИЕ ЯЗЫКАМИ НАСЕЛЕНИЕМ НАИБОЛЕЕ МНОГОЧИСЛЕННЫХ НАЦИОНАЛЬНОСТЕЙ]&lt;/ref&gt; In Dagestan, the number of non-Azeri speakers of the Azeri language (as either a first or second language) was still in the thousands in 2010.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/perepis2010/croc/results2.html Всероссийская перепись населения 2010 года.

According to the Dagestani constitution, the official languages of Dagestan are Russian and "all local languages", though only 14 of the republic's numerous languages have writing systems, one of them being Azeri.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of the Republic of Dagestan.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rest of Russia==
[[File:Azerbaijanis by federal subject 2010.svg|thumb|right|450 px|Distribution of Azerbaijanis in Russia, 2010]]
Diplomatic missions and merchants from [[Shirvan]] and the [[Safavid Empire]] first appeared in Russia in the fourteenth and fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazeta.islamnn.ru/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=132 Azerbaijani Merchants in Nizhny Novgorod]. ''Al Hayat''. November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the [[Russian Empire]] conquering what is now Azerbaijan in the early nineteenth century and its incorporation into the [[Soviet Union]] in 1920, the Azeri population did not tend to leave its traditional areas of settlement until the second half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vestikavkaza.ru/articles/Istoriya-rossiysko-azerbaydzhanskikh-otnosheniy-MIGRATSIONNYE-VOPROSY.html History of Russian–Azerbaijani Relations - Migration Issues]. ''Vestnik Kavkaza''. 6 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, isolated communities of Azeris in Russia can trace their existence to the mid-nineteenth century.

The population of maritime [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] regions has historically had strong economic ties with the city of [[Astrakhan]] on the northern Caspian shore. Starting in the 1830, Azeri merchants began settling in this city, with three of them controlling up to 80% of commercial navy later in the century.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;[http://vesti.az/news/265909 It Is Surprising that Even Russian Girls Speak Azeri in Astrakhan]. ''Vesti.az''. 3 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Azeris, known to the local population as ''Persians'' or ''Shamakhy Tatars'', numbered around one thousand persons in 1879.&lt;ref name="etnokonf"&gt;[http://etnokonf.astrobl.ru/document/582 Azerbaijanis]. Ethnoreligious Council of the Governor of the Astrakhan Oblast.&lt;/ref&gt; Azeri oil industrialist, first-guild merchant [[Shamsi Asadullayev]], founder of the Asadullayev Trade Affairs, built an oil base not far from Astrakhan, in a settlement presently known as Asadullayevo.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt; The Azeri community of Astrakhan grew in the Soviet times and in 2010 consisted of 5,737 people, making Azeris the fourth largest ethnicity in the oblast and 1,31% of its total population.&lt;ref name="etnicheski"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://astrastat.gks.ru/wps/wcm/connect/rosstat_ts/astrastat/ru/census_and_researching/census/national_census_2010/score_2010/ |title=Итоги::Астраханьстат |accessdate=2013-03-16 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FHBWW5Pf?url=http://astrastat.gks.ru/wps/wcm/connect/rosstat_ts/astrastat/ru/census_and_researching/census/national_census_2010/score_2010/ |archivedate=2013-03-21 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The religious life of the Azeris in Astrakhan is centred around the 1909 Kriushi Mosque, which was closed down in 1932, and recently reopened and renovated as a Shiite mosque and named the Baku Mosque (by virtue of being located on Baku Street).&lt;ref name="etnokonf"/&gt; The Azeri language is taught as a subject at the [[Astrakhan State University]].&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;

Shamsi Asadullayev was based in [[Moscow]] from 1903 until his death in 1913. He allocated money for the construction of a secular school for Muslim boys and girls and a Muslim community centre in Moscow. The four-story building erected after his death on Maly Tatarsky Lane came to be known as the Asadullayev House. It is currently owned by the Tatar National Cultural Autonomy of Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://islamrf.ru/news/c-news/culture/27414/ A Tatar House in Zamoskvorechye: the Asadullayev House Is Turning 100]. IslamRf.ru. 8 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly to all Muslims of the [[Caucasus]] and [[Central Asia]], Azeris were exempt from compulsory military service in the Russian Imperial army, but were required to pay a special tax. Those willing to serve were allowed to enlist in irregular units, such as the [[Savage Division]].&lt;ref name="rigvr"&gt;Революция и гражданская война в России: 1917—1923 гг.

In 1805, [[Mammad Hasan agha Javanshir]] became one of the first Russian [[major general]]s of Azeri origin.&lt;ref&gt;Исмаилов Э.Э. Ханы Карабахские и их потомки. // Генеалогический вестник. Выпуск 12. — СПб., 2002, pg. 40–55&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic Azeri officers commanded Russian troops in a series of wars, including the Russo-Persian wars of [[Russo-Persian War (1804–13)|1804–1813]] and [[Russo-Persian War (1826–28)|1826–1828]], Russo-Turkish wars of [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–29)|1828–1829]] and [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|1877–1878]], the suppression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]], the [[Crimean War]], the [[Caucasian War]], and the Russian conquest of Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Shamistan Nazirli. Azeri Generals. Baku: Ganjlik, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, Azeri political figures were among those who established the first Islamic party of Russia, [[Ittifaq al-Muslimin]], in the city of [[Nizhny Novgorod]]. An Azeri member, lawyer [[Alimardan Topchubashov]], was elected its leader. The party was officially registered in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazeta.islamnn.ru/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=132 Alimardan Topchubashov: Leader of Muslims in Nizhny Novgorod]. ''Al Hayat''. November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; There were six ethnic Azeris elected in the [[State Duma of the Russian Empire]] in the [[Russian legislative election, 1906|1906 Russian legislative election]], six more in the February 1907 election and one in each of the following elections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azerbaijan.az/portal/StatePower/LegistativePower/legislativePower_01_r.html Our Independent State and Parliament: 87 Years Ago and Now].&lt;/ref&gt;

For the past decade, Azeris have played significant roles in developing Russian economy. Azerbaijani geologist [[Farman Salmanov]], who later established himself in Moscow, discovered rich oil reserves in [[Siberia]] which had previously been considered as an unlikely oil-bearing region. With many of them involved in [[entrepreneurship]], they have been employed in major economical areas, such as trade and oil industry. Among Russia's 100 richest people ranked by ''[[Forbes]]'' in 2004, three ethnic Azeris were ranked 10, 66 and 74.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/lists/results.jhtml?passListId=75&amp;passYear=2004&amp;passListType=Person&amp;searchParameter1=unset&amp;searchParameter2=unset&amp;resultsStart=1&amp;resultsHowMany=25&amp;resultsSortProperties=%2Bnumberfield1%2C%2Bstringfield2&amp;resultsSortCategoryName=Rank&amp;passKeyword=&amp;category1=category&amp;category2=category The 100 Richest Russians] by Paul Khlebnikov (ed.). ''Forbes''. 23 July 2004. Retrieved 15 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Azeris have established numerous cultural communities, the largest one being the All-Russian Azeri Congress and the Azeri Federal National Culture Autonomy, which control smaller communities across Russia. In addition, the Moscow Public Secondary School #157 is set up for students with keen interest in the Azeri language and culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azeri.ru/Diaspora/organization/mekteb/mekteb.html The Moscow Public Secondary School #157 with the Ethnocultural Azeri Element] by Aida Quliyeva. Azeri.ru. Retrieved 15 September 2006 (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 study indicated noticeable social differences between two groups of Azeris: those who are native to or have lived considerable parts of their lives in Moscow and those who are recent immigrants. About half of the people in the first group have a post-secondary degree, whereas among immigrant Azeris only 25% do. Fluency in the Russian language is characteristic of virtually all of those in the first group (moreover, 24% of Azeris from this group reported it as their first language), while almost one-third of those in the second group speak very limited Russian. About half of Azeri newcomers are engaged in commerce and service sector, compared to the native and earlier immigrant Azeris who tend to pursue careers in sciences, health care, education and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} Yurik Harutyunyan.

In general, among ethnic Caucasus diasporas in Moscow, Azeris stand out as the least integrated into Russian society. They have been described as the strongest adherents to their traditions and marriages within their own ethnic community compared to local Armenians, Georgians, Ukrainians, and Tatars. According to a 2006 survey, 71% of Moscow Azeris described themselves as being religious. A great number of them have retained Azerbaijani citizenship and is willing to relocate back to Azerbaijan at some point.&lt;ref&gt;[http://regnum.ru/news/766235.html/  Азербайджанцы, армяне, грузины в Москве: этносоциальные общности и различия]. Regnum. 13 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Russian census]] saw a decrease in the number of Azeris in Russia compared to the previous census, with 603,070 Azeris (with 21.7% of them in Dagestan) compared to 621,840 in 2002 (with 18% in Dagestan). Over 97% of Azeris living in Russia know the [[Russian language]].&lt;ref name="langcomm"/&gt; Close to 84% considers Azeri their first language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/perepis2010/croc/Documents/Vol4/pub-04-08.pdf НАСЕЛЕНИЕ НАИБОЛЕЕ МНОГОЧИСЛЕННЫХ НАЦИОНАЛЬНОСТЕЙ ПО РОДНОМУ ЯЗЫКУ]&lt;/ref&gt; Among Azeris of Dagestan, the number of speakers of Azeri as a first language is over 99%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/perepis2010/croc/Documents/Vol4/pub-04-09.pdf НАСЕЛЕНИЕ НАИБОЛЕЕ МНОГОЧИСЛЕННЫХ НАЦИОНАЛЬНОСТЕЙ ПО РОДНОМУ ЯЗЫКУ ПО СУБЪЕКТАМ РОССИЙСКОЙ ФЕДЕРАЦИИ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrimination==
{{main article|Racism in Russia}}
Like many other people, who originated in the [[Caucasus]] (commonly referred to as Caucasians (''кавказцы''), despite the fact that the term has a different dominant meaning in [[English language|English]]), Azeris often face ''Caucasophobia'', which might result in severe discrimination and violence.

== History ==
Although independent statistical programs had existed in the country before, they were often incomplete or produced inaccurate results, which led the [[Government of Bangladesh]] establishing an official bureau in August 1974, by merging four of the previous larger statistical agencies, the Bureau of Statistics, the Bureau of Agriculture Statistics, the Agriculture Census Commission and the Population Census Commission. In July 1975, the Statistics Division was created and placed under the Ministry of Planning in order to control it administratively  In 2002, the Statistics Division merged with Planning Commission and the bureau is now controlled by the Ministry of Planning and office. It is headquarters in [[Dhaka]], the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, as of 2008, has 23 regional statistical offices and 489 Upazila/Thana offices located in the 23 [[districts of Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name="bangla" /&gt;

The Gymkhana Grounds lie in the southern end of the [[Azad Maidan]]. The ground itself is on leased property. It has a [[triangle|triangular]] area, with the southern end facing the [[VSNL]] building. MG Road and H Somal Marg are the two roads on either end that begin from the southern end. It is boxed in by a shortcut lane which connects [[Churchgate]] to [[Victoria Terminus]].

==Sports==
A long building which serves as the lobby, [[table tennis]] area, [[badminton]] court, restaurant and lounge connects the two roads. The region between the building and the lane is a large ground. It is very difficult to get membership into this exclusive club.&lt;ref name="DNA"&gt;

[[Cricket]] is played here in the winter months, and [[rugby football|rugby]] and [[Association football|football]] in the [[monsoon]] months. This used to be major centre for the erstwhile [[Bombay Pentangular]] cricket matches. The ground had the distinction of hosting India's first [[Test cricket]] match on 15 December 1933,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gymkhana Ground: Test Matches |url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/ground/58319.html?class=1;template=results;type=aggregate |work=ESPN Cricinfo |date=17 June 2011 |accessdate=17 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216121104/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/ground/58319.html?class=1%3Btemplate%3Dresults%3Btype%3Daggregate |archivedate=16 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; captained by [[CK Nayudu]].

The ground also has the distinction for hosting the first ever International Test Cricket match played by the disabled on 10 December 2002. This first ever Test cricket match of disabled was played between India and England. The match was of one day duration and India had won the match.

The [[Australian cricket team]] used the grounds to practice prior to their clash with India in the [[1996 Cricket World Cup]].

The ground also hosts a national [[rugby football|rugby]] competition, and has recently hosted matches against [[Sri Lanka]] and a few other [[South Asian]] teams. It has also hosted national and international [[squash (sport)|squash]] tournaments.

Bombay Gymkhana houses three badminton courts, five squash courts, six tennis courts, six tables for billiards and snooker, one swimming pool and a fitness centre.&lt;ref name=IX1 /&gt;

Until a few years ago, only men could gain membership to the club.  Women were able to join from the early 2000s.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

[[Image:Police call box Wash DC 1912.jpg|thumb|Police callbox, Washington, D.C., 1912]]
A '''call box''' or '''callbox''' is a (usually metal) box containing a special-purpose [[Dedicated line|direct line]] telephone or other [[telecommunication]]s [[Information appliance|device]], which has been used by various industries and institutions as a way for employees or clients at a remote location to contact a central [[Dispatch (logistics)|dispatch]] office.

== Uses ==

=== Police and taxicab dispatching ===
Some [[taxicab|taxi]] companies used callboxes before the introduction of [[radiotelephone|two-way radio]] dispatching, as a way for drivers to report to the dispatch office and receive customer requests for service.  Taxi callboxes would be located at [[taxicab stand]]s, where taxis would [[Queue area|queue]] for trips.

Also, before the introduction of two-way radios, some [[police]] agencies installed callboxes or "[[police box]]es" at street locations as a way for [[Police|beat officer]]s to report to their dispatch office.  Before the development of [[emergency telephone number]]s and the proliferation of [[mobile phone]]s, some [[firefighting]] agencies installed callboxes at various street locations, so that a [[pedestrian]] or driver spotting a [[fire]] could quickly report it.

=== Retail ===
A growing number of retailers use call boxes in their stores as a way for shoppers to summon service (''Shopper Call Box'') as well as for store employees to summon assistance (''Director Call Box'').  Retail call boxes are generally wireless devices that communicate to in-store communication devices via radio frequency (303&amp;nbsp;MHz) or through 802.11 networks.

[[Image:Californiacallbox.jpg|thumb|left|90px|Call box in California.]]

=== Motorist aid ===
{{see also|Emergency telephone}}
Call boxes also exist at regular intervals along the sides of many [[highway]]s and [[rapid transit]] lines around the world, where drivers or passengers can use them to contact a control centre in case of an [[accident]] or other emergency.  Such call boxes are often marked by a blue [[strobe light]] which flashes briefly every few seconds.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Boxes in remote areas often now have [[solar cell]]s to power them.

[[United States|U.S.]] highways with callboxes include most of the major highways in California, [[Florida's Turnpike]] and [[Interstate 185 (Georgia)|Interstate 185]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  Rather than a telephone, these devices simply have four buttons to push: blue for accident or other emergency (send police/fire/medical), green for major service (mechanical breakdown, send a [[tow truck]]), black for minor service (out-of-[[gasoline|gas]] or flat [[tire]]), and yellow for cancel.{{Clarify|reason=Which highway(s)?|date=June 2016}}  Roads in other places may have voice call boxes, though these are more expensive, and must either be wired long distances, or rely on spotty rural [[mobile phone]] service.

Many [[mobile phone|cellular]] callboxes in California now include a [[Telecommunications device for the deaf|TTY]] interface for hearing-impaired users.

[[Image:NYU call box @ Wash Sq Village jeh.jpg|thumb|96px|[[New York University]] callbox]]

Call boxes have the advantage that their location is immediately known, while mobile phone users in trouble do not necessarily know where they are.  For example, in California a cellular call to 911 connects to the California Highway Patrol, whereas a callbox will connect to a dedicated regional answer center. The [[Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling|DTMF]] [[automatic number identification]] (ANI) or caller ID from the callbox will be used to display the callbox sign number and its location on the [[computer-aided dispatch]] (CAD) system.

An emergency callbox can also have a secondary function as a [[remote terminal unit]] (RTU).  Experimental systems deployed around Sacramento, California, were used to connect fog sensors and [[closed-circuit television]] using the cellular transceiver within the callbox.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itsdocs.fhwa.dot.gov/jpodocs/repts_te/13609_files/4_2_4.htm  Sutter County Smart Call Boxes&lt;/ref&gt;

====Decline in usage====
In California, freeway callboxes were used about 98,000 times in 2001. That number dropped by 80% to 20,100 times in 2010, or about 1 call per box per month. The cost of callboxes for the Service Authority for Freeways and Expressways (SAFE) program in the San Francisco Bay area is $1.7 million annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Highway-call-boxes-becoming-obsolete-2373660.php|title=Highway call boxes becoming obsolete|date=May 1, 2011|last=Cabanatuan|first=Michael|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=March 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, since 2009 approximately half of the callboxes have been removed from certain California highways, preferentially leaving them only in places where cell phone coverage is poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.ocregister.com/2015/06/05/in-the-age-of-cellphones-how-much-do-we-need-highway-call-boxes/ | title=In the age of cellphones, how much do we need highway call boxes? | date=2015-06-05 | work=[[Orange County Register]] | last=Shine | first=Nicole Knight | access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The State of [[Florida]] previously had callboxes installed at one-mile intervals along all its [[Interstate Highway System|interstate highways]] as well as the [[Florida's Turnpike]]. These boxes were all removed by 2014 after a 65-percent decrease in usage over an eight-year period, in line with increased mobile phone usage. The boxes were costing the state roughly $1 million per year to keep operational.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Morelli|first=Keith|title=Florida dismantling call boxes along interstates|url=http://www.tbo.com/news/florida/communication-dinosaurs-are-disappearing-20131017/|access-date=March 10, 2016|newspaper=The Tampa Tribune|date=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Safety ===
On many [[North America]]n [[college]] and [[university]] [[campus]]es today, callboxes are installed at various locations around campus so that students, staff, or visitors can contact campus [[security]] in case of an emergency.  Often, these are voice call boxes using a mobile phone service, and are solar-powered, so no wiring need be extended to the middle of a [[parking lot]] or other remote location.  Thus, they can function during a [[power outage]] if the [[cell site]] is still powered.

[[New York City]] has a large system of call boxes intended to summon a police or fire department response, where calls are routed to local dispatchers, instead of the general [[9-1-1]] queue. The [[New York City Fire Department]] reports that 2.6% of emergency calls they receive originate from call boxes, 88% of which are false alarms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://untappedcities.com/2013/10/16/cities-101-red-fire-alarm-boxes-nyc-do-they-work/|last=Chatelain|first=Phileppe|publisher=unTapped Cities|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; City officials have attempted to remove the callboxes, however federal Judge [[Robert W. Sweet]] denied the City's request to lift an injunction preventing their removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/16/nyregion/city-is-ordered-to-keep-emergency-help-boxes.html|title=City Loses Bid to Remove Call Boxes|last=Weiser|first=Ben|date=15 August 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=9 January 2018|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wireless call boxes ==
Call boxes may be wired or wireless.  Wireless systems use radio frequencies in the [[Very high frequency|VHF]] or [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] business band radio spectrum. Many callboxes can be programmed to be compatible with virtually any brand of VHF or UHF [[business band]] portable or fixed-base radio. Many in the United States require an FCC license, but some are certified for use on special FCC license-free business frequencies.

If the required distance is greater than the range of the wireless call box, an external antenna can extend the range. In the FCC-licensed frequency range, radio [[repeater]]s can extend this range even more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intercomsonline.com/Wireless-Call-Box_a/172.htm "Wireless Call Box System Facts"]&lt;/ref&gt;

A wireless call box that runs on solar power can be truly wireless, since no power lines need be run to it.

== History ==
In the United States, the Gamewell Company of Newton, Massachusetts manufactured [[fire alarm call box]]es, beginning in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamewell-fci.com/history.html "Gamewell FCI"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512201708/http://www.gamewell-fci.com/history.html |date=2008-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These would telegraph a location code to the central fire station when a lever was pulled in the box.&lt;ref name=Globe&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/01/27/no_cause_for_alarm/ |title=No cause for alarm |first=Emily |last=Sweeney |publisher=Boston Globe |date=January 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is difficult to determine when and where the earliest highway emergency phones were developed, undoubtedly one of the earliest examples were the freeway phones developed in Western Australia in 1966. This system was developed by Alan Harman, an employee of a Western Australian security firm, Central Station Security Company, Electronic Signals Pty Ltd, who came up with the idea after reading of a pile-up on the Kwinana Freeway. The newspaper article mentioned that assistance had been difficult to provide to those involved in the pile-up. The system Harman envisaged was a series of telephone units in a box on a short post, spaced at 160 metre intervals along Perth's freeways. Picking up the handset would trigger an alarm in the Main Roads control centre and police, fire or ambulance could then be determined by the caller. Harman developed the system with the approval of the Main Roads Commissioner and Chief Engineer, by adapting the existing design of communication facilities used at the security firm in which he worked.&lt;ref&gt;Humble beginnings for freeway phones (July 1998).

The '''Changos''', also known as '''Camanchacos''' or '''Camanchangos''',&lt;ref&gt;["Chile – Travels in a Thin Country", Sara Wheeler, 1994]retrieved on June 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  were an indigenous people who inhabited a long stretch of the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast from the [[Atacama desert]] to the [[Coquimbo Region|Coquimbo]] [[Regions of Chile|Region]] in what is now southern [[Peru]] and northern [[Chile]].

==History==

===Definition and context of the Changos===
The culture originated in the 8,000-year-old [[Chinchorro mummies|Chinchorro tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educarchile.cl/ech/pro/app/detalle?id=205521 Pueblos Originarios de Chile - Changos] educarchile.cl 2012, retrieved on June 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a combination of conquest and [[Acculturation|integration]] into other cultures and ethnicities, the Chango culture is now considered extinct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memoriachilena.cl/archivos2/pdfs/mc0012713.pdf Los Changos de las costas de Chile] Memoria Chilena, BND Biblioteca Nacional Digital, Ricardo E. Latcham Santiago, Chile 1910, retrieved on June 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pueblos indigenas de Chile.svg|thumb|right|350px|Distribution of the pre-Hispanic people of Chile. Click to enlarge.]]
The Changos were not a distinct [[tribe]] or [[ethnic group]]; rather, the term is used to refer to many disparate communities of indigenous people living along the northern Chilean and southern Peruvian coast in the [[Pre-Columbian era]]. The term "chango" was first documented in the 17th century by [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] conquistadors who perceived little in the way of cultural difference between the local native communities. Therefore, "chango" describes a loose grouping of maritime peoples who shared a similar way of life rather than a common history or ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2014.serindigena.org/index.php/es/norte/changos Changos - Ser indigena] serindigena.org Portal de las Culturas Originarias de Chile retrieved on June 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Chango culture is considered more [[Primitive culture|primitive]] than neighbouring cultures such as the [[Atacama people|Atacameño]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-93787.html Pueblos Originarios de Chile - Changos] Memoria Chilena, BND Biblioteca Nacional Digital, retrieved on June 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
Chango culture is part of the [[Chinchorro mummies|Chinchorro tradition]]. The Chinchorro were [[Hunter-gatherer|hunter-fisher-gatherers]] with a particular reliance on the sea, who lived along the [[Atacama desert|Atacama]] coast from at least the 8th century BC. They are of special interest to modern anthropologists due to their practice of mummifying the dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archaeology.about.com/od/cterms/g/chinchorro.htm Chinchorro Culture] about.com By K. Kris Hirst, archaeology expert, retrieved on June 23, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Changos around [[Paposo]] appear by 1870 to have spoken a dialect of [[Mapudungun]], the language of the [[Mapuche]]'s of south-central Chile.&lt;ref name=DAns1976&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.estudios-atacamenos.ucn.cl/web%20est%20atac%2037/pdf/numero04/10Dans.pdf |title=Chilueno o arauco, idioma de los changos del norte de Chile, dialecto mapuche septentrional |journal=Estudios Atacameños |year=1976 |pages=113–118 |issue=4 |accessdate=February 22, 2014 |last=D'Ans |first=André-Marcel |language=Spanish |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304021124/http://www.estudios-atacamenos.ucn.cl/web%20est%20atac%2037/pdf/numero04/10Dans.pdf |archive-date=March 4, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chango economy===
[[File:Puerto del Huasco.jpg|thumb|Chango [[raft]]s in the Chilean port of [[Huasco]] in the 1850s]]
Chango communities were organised into either [[nomadic]] or [[sedentary]] groups based on nuclear family units. Each group was independent of the others, providing food and other resources for itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.precolombino.cl/culturas-americanas/pueblos-originarios-de-chile/changos/Presentation for the Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino – ‘Pueblos originarios’ retrieved on June  23, 2015]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Changos were experts at exploiting the resources of the sea. Each group specialised in a particular type of fish, including [[tuna]], [[Genypterus chilensis|conger eels]], [[Mullet (fish)|mullet]], [[Darter (fish)|dart fish]], [[Chilean jack mackerel|mackerel]] and [[octopus]]. Rafts used for fishing developed from primitive reed constructions to craft made from three wooden planks, and later to [[Pinniped|seal skins]] fastened to wooden frames. Fish were caught using nets, hooks and [[harpoon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[Manual de Historia de Chile desde la prehistoria hasta el 2000, Francisco Frías Valenzuela, 1986] Santiago Chile: Zig-Zag, 2000. retrieved on June 23, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
The capture of seals was of crucial importance to the Chango way of life, with every part of the animal having its uses. The meat, fat and bones were used for food and tools, the skins were used to make rafts and the intestines to make fishing equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[Documental de Chile, Anselmo J. Garcia Curado, 2013, retrieved on June 23, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
As well as seal skins, the Changos used [[vicuña]] wool, feathers, bird skins, shells and the bones and teeth of sea creatures as materials to make practical and decorative items such as clothing, blankets, tools, cutlery and jewellery. They also made and painted ceramic utensils.
Despite their geographical isolation, the Changos traded with inland tribes, exchanging shellfish, dried fish, animal hide, guano, fat and shells for wool, fruit, maize and coca.
Chango cave paintings include images of men hunting and fishing and sea creatures such as seals, turtles and whales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educarchile.cl/ech/pro/app/detalle?id=205521 Pueblos Originarios de Chile - Changos] educarchile.cl 2012, retrieved on June 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7215">[[Image:Les enfants de Yanfolila.jpg|thumb|right|Children gathered in the town of [[Yanfolila]].]]
'''[[Children's rights]] in Mali''' are secured by several laws designed to protect children and provide for their welfare, including an ordinance that provides for regional positions as "child delegates" to safeguard the rights and interests of children.&lt;ref name=report&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78745.htm Report on Human Rights Practices 2006: Mali]. [[United States]] [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] (March 6, 2007). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; However, as with most legal issues, this is the official account, based on laws that have only a status on paper. There are no provisions for the execution of the laws, and as any visit to any medium-sized town in [[Mali]] will show, there are scores of children in the street who live on the verge of starvation and who are often maltreated. Especially the [[talibe]], young boys 'given' to a '[[marabout]]', are subject to all sorts of negligence if not inhuman treatment by their masters. Such 'marabouts' are also in practice above the law—in spite of widespread maltreatment of children by them not a single complaint against them has been made. There is a serious problem here, because hardly any research in this area has been carried out. However, a qualitative study by Jelle Hilven, of the [[Free University of Brussels]], revealed acute deviations from official politics in daily life.

== Background ==
For many years [[education in Mali]] was tuition free and, in principle, open to all; however, students were required to provide their own uniforms and supplies. Primary school was compulsory up to the age of 12, but only 56.6 percent of children from seven to 12 years old (49.3 percent of girls and 64.1 percent of boys) attended primary school during the 2005-6 school year. Girls' enrollment in school was lower than boys' at all levels due to poverty, cultural tendencies to emphasize boys' education, and early marriages for girls. Other factors affecting school enrollment included distance to the nearest school, lack of transportation, and shortages of teachers and instructional materials.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; Members of the black Tamachek, or Bellah, community reported that some Tamachek children were denied educational opportunities because their traditional masters would not allow them to attend school.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

Approximately 11 percent of students attended private Arabic-language schools, or medersas (from {{lang-ar|مدرسة‎}})." Medersas were encouraged to follow the government curriculum, and most taught core subjects including math, science, and foreign languages; however, few medersas fully adhered to the government's curriculum due to a lack of teacher training and instructional materials.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; An unknown number of primary school-aged children throughout the country attended part-time Koranic schools. Most Koranic school students were under the age of 10. Koranic schools taught only the Koran and were partially funded by students, known as "garibouts," who were required by schoolmasters to beg for money on the streets as part of their religious instruction. A 2005 UNICEF study of Koranic schools in Mopti found that children who attended these schools spent the majority of their time begging on the streets or working in fields.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; The government provided subsidized medical care to children as well as adults, but the care was limited in quality and availability. Boys and girls had equal access to medical care.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

Statistics on child abuse were unreliable, and reported cases of abuse were rare, according to local human rights organizations. The social services department investigated and intervened in cases of child abuse or neglect.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; As one of the few pieces of empirical research carried out, Hilven (2011) reports widespread neglect and deep fear to report maltreatment, both by the local population as by non-Malian residents and organisations. 

A 2004 governmental study, which involved 450 interviews, found that the children most at risk for sexual exploitation were girls between the ages of 12 and 18 who worked as street vendors or domestic servants, or who were homeless children or the victims of child trafficking. Such exploitation was most prevalent in areas in which the population and economy were in flux, such as border zones or towns on transportation routes or in mining areas. The study noted that most cases of sexual exploitation went unreported and recommended that the country strengthen its laws to protect children.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

[[Female genital mutilation]], or FGM, was common, particularly in rural areas, and was performed on girls between the ages of six months to six years. According to domestic NGOs, approximately 95 percent of adult women had undergone FGM. The practice was widespread in most regions and among most ethnic groups, was not subject to class boundaries, and was not religiously based. There are no laws against FGM, but a government decree prohibits FGM in government-funded health centers.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; The government continued its two-phase plan to eliminate FGM by 2008. According to the local human rights organizations fighting FGM, the educational phase (workshops, videos, and theater) continued in cities, and FGM reportedly decreased substantially among children of educated parents. In many instances, FGM practitioners agreed to stop the practice in exchange for other income-generating activity. The National Committee Against Violence Towards Women linked all the NGOs combating FGM.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

Women may legally marry at age 18 and men at age 21. The marriage code allows girls under age 15 to marry with parental consent or special permission from a judge. Women's rights organizations opposed this provision as contradicting international conventions that protect children through the age of 18. Underage marriage was a problem throughout the country with parents in some cases arranging marriages for girls as young as nine. A local NGO reported that at least 10 girls-—some below the age of 13—-lost their lives between 2005 and May 2007 because of medical complications resulting from early marriage. Medical specialists noted that child brides were often the victims of FGM, which exacerbates the possibility of complications from infection and childbirth.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

== Movement ==
Local women's rights NGOs, such as Action for the Promotion and Development of Women, the Committee for the Defense of Women's Rights, and the Women's and Children's Rights Watch, educated local populations about the negative consequences of underage marriage. The government also helped to enable girls married at an early age to continue in school.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

'''Cognitive psychology''' is the study of [[mental process]]es such as "[[attention]], language use, [[memory]], [[perception]], problem solving, [[creativity]], and [[thinking]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/research/action/glossary.aspx |title=American Psychological Association (2013). Glossary of psychological terms |publisher=Apa.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the work derived from cognitive psychology has been integrated into various other modern disciplines such as Cognitive Science and of psychological study, including [[educational psychology]], [[social psychology]], [[personality psychology]], [[abnormal psychology]], [[developmental psychology]], and [[economics]].

==History==
Philosophically, ruminations of the human mind and its processes have been around since the times of the ancient Greeks. In 387 BCE, [[Plato]] is known to have suggested that the brain was the seat of the mental processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/courses/1010/mangels/neuro/history/history.html |title=Mangels, J. History of neuroscience |publisher=Columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1637, [[René Descartes]] posited that humans are born with innate ideas, and forwarded the idea of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|mind-body dualism]], which would come to be known as substance dualism (essentially the idea that the mind and the body are two separate substances).&lt;ref name="Malone"&gt;Malone, J.C. (2009). ''Psychology: Pythagoras to Present''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press. (a pp. 143, b pp. 293, c pp. 491)&lt;/ref&gt; From that time, major debates ensued through the 19th century regarding whether human thought was solely experiential ([[empiricism]]), or included innate knowledge ([[Psychological nativism|nativism]]). Some of those involved in this debate included [[George Berkeley]] and [[John Locke]] on the side of empiricism, and [[Immanuel Kant]] on the side of nativism.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Anderson, J.R. (2010). ''Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications''. New York, NY: Worth Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the philosophical debate continuing, the mid to late 19th century was a critical time in the development of psychology as a scientific discipline. Two discoveries that would later play substantial roles in cognitive psychology were [[Paul Broca]]'s discovery of the area of the brain largely responsible for language production,&lt;ref name="Malone" /&gt; and [[Carl Wernicke]]'s discovery of an area thought to be mostly responsible for comprehension of language.&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck, M.W. (1990). ''Cognitive Psychology: An International Review''. West Sussex, England: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. (pp. 111)&lt;/ref&gt; Both areas were subsequently formally named for their founders and disruptions of an individual's language production or comprehension due to trauma or malformation in these areas have come to commonly be known as [[Expressive aphasia|Broca's aphasia]] and [[Receptive aphasia|Wernicke's aphasia]].

From the 1920s to the 1950s, the main approach to psychology was [[behaviorism]]. Initially, its adherents viewed mental events such as thoughts, ideas, attention, and consciousness as unobservables, hence outside the realm of a science of psychology. One pioneer of cognitive psychology, who worked outside the boundaries (both intellectual and geographical) of behaviorism was [[Jean Piaget]]. From 1926 to the 1950s and into the 1980s, he studied the thoughts, language, and intelligence of children and adults.&lt;ref name="AboutPiaget"&gt;Smith, L. (2000). About Piaget. Retrieved from http://piaget.org/aboutPiaget.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-20th century, three main influences arose that would inspire and shape cognitive psychology as a formal school of thought:
* With the development of new warfare technology during [[World War II|WWII]], the need for a greater understanding of human performance came to prominence. Problems such as how to best train soldiers to use new technology and how to deal with matters of attention while under duress became areas of need for military personnel. [[Behaviorism]] provided little if any insight into these matters and it was the work of [[Donald Broadbent]], integrating concepts from human performance research and the recently developed [[information theory]], that forged the way in this area.&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt;
* Developments in computer science would lead to parallels being drawn between human thought and the computational functionality of computers, opening entirely new areas of [[Computationalism|psychological thought]]. Allen Newell and Herbert Simon spent years developing the concept of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) and later worked with cognitive psychologists regarding the implications of AI. This encouraged a conceptualization of mental functions patterned on the way that computers handled such things as memory storage and retrieval,&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt; and it opened an important doorway for [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]].
* [[Noam Chomsky]]'s 1959 critique&lt;ref name="Chomsky 1959"&gt;Chomsky, N. A. (1959), ''A Review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior''&lt;/ref&gt; of behaviorism, and empiricism more generally, initiated what would come to be known as the "[[cognitive revolution]]". Inside psychology, in criticism of behaviorism, J. S. Bruner, J. J. Goodnow &amp; G. A. Austin wrote "a study of thinking" in 1956. In 1960, G. A. Miller, E. Galanter and K. Pribram wrote their famous "Plans and the Structure of Behavior". The same year, Bruner and Miller founded the Harvard Center for Cognitive Studies, which institutionalized the revolution and launched the field of cognitive science.
* Formal recognition of the field involved the establishment of research institutions such as [[George Mandler]]'s Center for Human Information Processing in 1964. Mandler described the origins of cognitive psychology in a 2002 article in the Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences&lt;ref name=Mandler&gt;Mandler, G. (2002). Origins of the cognitive (r)evolution. Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences, 38, 339–353.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Neisser}}[[Ulric Neisser]] put the term "cognitive psychology" into common use through his book ''Cognitive Psychology'', published in 1967.&lt;ref name=Neisser&gt;Neisser, U. (1967). ''Cognitive Psychology''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall. Neisser's definition on page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Neisser's definition of "cognition" illustrates the then-progressive concept of cognitive processes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The term "cognition" refers to all processes by which the sensory input is transformed, reduced, elaborated, stored, recovered, and used. It is concerned with these processes even when they operate in the absence of relevant stimulation, as in images and [[hallucinations]]. ... Given such a sweeping definition, it is apparent that cognition is involved in everything a human being might possibly do; that every psychological phenomenon is a cognitive phenomenon. But although cognitive psychology is concerned with all human activity rather than some fraction of it, the concern is from a particular point of view. Other viewpoints are equally legitimate and necessary. [[Psychodynamics|Dynamic psychology]], which begins with motives rather than with sensory input, is a case in point. Instead of asking how a man's actions and experiences result from what he saw, remembered, or believed, the dynamic psychologist asks how they follow from the subject's goals, needs, or instincts.&lt;ref name=Neisser/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Mental processes==
{{see also|Cognitive control}}
The main focus of cognitive psychologists is on the [[mental processes]] that affect behavior. Those processes include, but are not limited to, the following:

===Attention===
{{main|Attention}}
The psychological definition of [[attention]] is "a state of focused awareness on a subset of the available perceptual information".&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite web|title=How does the APA define "psychology"? |url=http://www.apa.org/support/about/apa/psychology.aspx#answer |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key function of [[attention]] is to identify irrelevant data and filter it out, enabling significant data to be distributed to the other [[mental processes]].&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt; For example, the human brain may simultaneously receive [[Auditory system|auditory]], [[visual]], [[olfactory]], [[taste]], and [[Touch|tactile]] information. The brain is able to handle only a small subset of this information, and this is accomplished through the attentional processes.&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt;

Attention can be divided into two major attentional systems: exogenous control and endogenous control&lt;ref name="Chicaetal2013"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2012.09.027|pmid=23000534|title=Two cognitive and neural systems for endogenous and exogenous spatial attention|journal=Behavioural Brain Research|volume=237|pages=107–123|year=2013|last1=Chica|first1=Ana B.|last2=Bartolomeo|first2=Paolo|last3=Lupiáñez|first3=Juan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exogenous control works from bottom-up and is responsible for [[orienting reflex]], and pop-out effects.&lt;ref name="Chicaetal2013" /&gt; Endogenous control works top-down and is the more deliberate attentional system, responsible for divided attention and conscious processing.&lt;ref name="Chicaetal2013" /&gt;

One major focal point relating to [[attention]] within the field of cognitive psychology is the concept of divided [[attention]]. A number of early studies dealt with the ability of a person wearing headphones to discern meaningful conversation when presented with different messages into each ear; this is known as the dichotic listening task.&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt; Key findings involved an increased understanding of the mind's ability to both focus on one message, while still being somewhat aware of information being taken in from the ear not being consciously attended to. E.g., participants (wearing earphones) may be told that they will be hearing separate messages in each ear and that they are expected to attend only to information related to basketball. When the experiment starts, the message about basketball will be presented to the left ear and non-relevant information will be presented to the right ear. At some point the message related to basketball will switch to the right ear and the non-relevant information to the left ear. When this happens, the listener is usually able to repeat the entire message at the end, having attended to the left or right ear only when it was appropriate.&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt; The ability to attend to one conversation in the face of many is known as the [[cocktail party effect]].

Other major findings include that participants can't comprehend both passages, when shadowing one passage, they can't report content of the unattended message, they can shadow a message better if the pitches in each ear are different.&lt;ref name="Cherry"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1121/1.1907229|title=Some Experiments on the Recognition of Speech, with One and with Two Ears|journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|volume=25|issue=5|pages=975–979|year=1953|last1=Cherry|first1=E. Colin}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while deep processing doesn't occur, early sensory processing does. Subjects did notice if the pitch of the unattended message changed or if it ceased altogether, and some even oriented to the unattended message if their name was mentioned.&lt;ref name="Cherry" /&gt;

===Memory===
The two main types of memory are short-term memory and long-term memory; however, short-term memory has become better understood to be working memory. Cognitive psychologists often study memory in terms of [[working memory]].

====[[Working memory]]====
Though working memory is often thought of as just short-term memory, it is more clearly defined as the ability to remember information in the face of distraction. The famously known capacity of memory of [[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|7 plus or minus 2]] is a combination of both memory in working memory and long term memory.

One of the classic experiments is by Ebbinghaus, who found the [[serial position effect]] where information from the beginning and end of list of random words were better recalled than those in the center.&lt;ref name="Eb"&gt;Ebbinghaus, Hermann (1913). On memory: A contribution to experimental psychology. New York: Teachers College.&lt;/ref&gt; This primacy and recency effect varies in intensity based on list length.&lt;ref name="Eb" /&gt; Its typical U-shaped curve can be disrupted by an attention-grabbing word; this is known as the [[Von Restorff effect]].
[[File:Working-memory-en.svg|thumbnail|The Baddeley &amp; Hitch Model of Working Memory]]
Many models of working memory have been made. One of the most regarded is the [[Baddeley's model of working memory|Baddeley and Hitch model of working memory]]. It takes into account both visual and auditory stimuli, long-term memory to use as a reference, and a central processor to combine and understand it all.

A large part of memory is forgetting, and there is a large debate among psychologists of [[decay theory]] versus [[interference theory]].

====[[Long-term memory]]====
Modern conceptions of [[memory]] are usually about long-term memory and break it down into three main sub-classes. These three classes are somewhat [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] in nature, in terms of the level of [[conscious]] thought related to their use.&lt;ref name="Balota"&gt;Balota, D.A. &amp; Marsh, E.J. (2004). ''Cognitive Psychology: Key Readings''. New York, NY: Psychology Press. (pp. 364–365)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Procedural memory]] is memory for the performance of particular types of action. It is often activated on a [[subconscious]] level, or at most requires a minimal amount of [[conscious]] effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.livescience.com/43595-procedural-memory.html|title=Procedural Memory: Definition and Examples|work=Live Science|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Procedural memory]] includes [[Stimulus-response model|stimulus-response]]-type information, which is activated through association with particular tasks, routines, etc. A person is using [[procedural knowledge]] when they seemingly "automatically" respond in a particular manner to a particular situation or process.&lt;ref name=Balota /&gt; An example is driving a car.
* [[Semantic memory]] is the encyclopedic knowledge that a person possesses. Knowledge like what the [[Eiffel Tower]] looks like, or the name of a friend from sixth grade, represent [[semantic memory]]. Access of [[semantic memory]] ranges from slightly to extremely effortful, depending on a number of variables including but not limited to recency of encoding of the information, number of associations it has to other information, frequency of access, and levels of meaning (how deeply it was processed when it was encoded).&lt;ref name=Balota /&gt;
* [[Episodic memory]] is the memory of autobiographical events that can be explicitly stated. It contains all memories that are temporal in nature, such as when one last brushed one's teeth or where one was when one heard about a major news event. [[Episodic memory]] typically requires the deepest level of [[consciousness|conscious]] thought, as it often pulls together [[semantic memory]] and temporal information to formulate the entire [[memory]].&lt;ref name=Balota /&gt;

===Perception===
[[Perception]] involves both the physical senses (sight, smell, hearing, taste, touch, and [[proprioception]]) as well as the [[Cognition|cognitive processes]] involved in interpreting those senses. Essentially, it is how people come to understand the world around them through interpretation of stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychology.about.com/od/sensationandperception/ss/perceptproc.htm Cherry, K. (2013). [[Perception] and the perceptual process]&lt;/ref&gt; Early psychologists like [[Edward Titchener|Edward B. Titchener]] began to work with perception in their [[Structuralism (psychology)|structuralist]] approach to psychology. [[Structuralism (psychology)|Structuralism]] dealt heavily with trying to reduce human thought (or "consciousness," as Titchener would have called it) into its most basic elements by gaining understanding of how an individual perceives particular stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/titchener.shtml |title=Plucker, J. (2012). Edward Bradford Titchener |publisher=Indiana.edu |date=2013-11-14 |accessdate=2014-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717212235/http://www.indiana.edu/%7Eintell/titchener.shtml# |archive-date=2014-07-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current perspectives on [[perception]] within cognitive psychology tend to focus on particular ways in which the human mind interprets stimuli from the senses and how these interpretations affect behavior. An example of the way in which modern psychologists approach the study of [[perception]] is the research being done at the Center for Ecological Study of Perception and Action at the University of Connecticut (CESPA). One study at CESPA concerns ways in which individuals perceive their physical environment and how that influences their navigation through that environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ione.psy.uconn.edu/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970412101520/http://ione.psy.uconn.edu/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1997-04-12 |title=University of Connecticut (N.D.). Center for the ecological study of perception |publisher=Ione.psy.uconn.edu |date=2012-11-30 |accessdate=2014-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
Psychologists have had an interest in the cognitive processes involved with [[language]] that dates back to the 1870s, when [[Carl Wernicke]] proposed a model for the mental processing of language.&lt;ref&gt;Temple, Christine M. (1990). "Developments and applications of cognitive neuropsychology." In M. W. Eysenck (Ed.)''Cognitive Psychology: An International Review''. West Sussex, England: John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd. p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Current work on [[language]] within the field of cognitive psychology varies widely. Cognitive psychologists may study [[language acquisition]],&lt;ref name="Ramsden"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11065-012-9208-z|pmid=22707315|title=Language Development and Assessment in the Preschool Period|journal=Neuropsychology Review|volume=22|issue=4|pages=384–401|year=2012|last1=Conti-Ramsden|first1=Gina|last2=Durkin|first2=Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt; individual components of [[language]] formation (like [[phoneme]]s),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.4000/cognitextes.211|title=The phoneme in cognitive phonology: Episodic memories of both meaningful and meaningless units?|journal=Cognitextes|issue=2|year=2009|last1=Välimaa-Blum|first1=Riitta}}&lt;/ref&gt; how language use is involved in [[Mood (psychology)|mood]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpi.nl/departments/other-research/research-projects/language-in-action/subprojects/Mood-and-language-comprehension |title=Berkum, J. Language in action - Mood and language comprehension |publisher=Mpi.nl |date=2010-12-06 |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; or numerous other related areas.
[[File:BrocasAreaSmall.png|thumbnail|Broca's and Wernicke's areas of the brain, which are critical in language]]

Significant work has been done recently with regard to understanding the timing of [[language acquisition]] and how it can be used to determine if a child has, or is at risk of, developing a [[learning disability]]. A study from 2012, showed that while this can be an effective strategy, it is important that those making evaluations include all relevant information when making their assessments. Factors such as individual variability, [[socioeconomic status]], [[Short-term memory|short-term]] and [[long-term memory]] capacity, and others must be included in order to make valid assessments.&lt;ref name="Ramsden" /&gt;

===Metacognition===
[[Metacognition]], in a broad sense, is the thoughts that a person has about their own thoughts. More specifically, metacognition includes things like:
* How effective a person is at monitoring their own performance on a given task (self-regulation).
* A person's understanding of their capabilities on particular mental tasks.
* The ability to apply [[Cognitive style|cognitive strategies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Martinez |first=M. E. |year=2006 |title=What is metacognition |journal=The Phi Delta Kappan |volume=87 |issue=9 |pages=696–699 |jstor=20442131}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Much of the current study regarding metacognition within the field of cognitive psychology deals with its application within the area of education. Being able to increase a student's metacognitive abilities has been shown to have a significant impact on their learning and study habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.brainscape.com/2010/04/learning-study-less/ |title=Cohen, A. (2010). The secret to learning more while studying |publisher=Blog.brainscape.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; One key aspect of this concept is the improvement of students' ability to set goals and self-regulate effectively to meet those goals. As a part of this process, it is also important to ensure that students are realistically evaluating their personal degree of knowledge and setting realistic goals (another metacognitive task).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/NAGTWorkshops/metacognition/teaching_metacognition.html |title=Lovett, M. (2008). Teaching metacognition |publisher=Serc.carleton.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common phenomena related to metacognition include:
*'''[[Déjà Vu]]:''' feeling of a repeated experience
*'''Cryptomnesia:''' generating thought believing it is unique but it is actually a memory of a past experience, aka unconscious plagiarism.
*'''False Fame Effect:''' non-famous names can be made to be famous
*'''[[illusory truth effect|Validity effect]]:''' statements seem more valid upon repeated exposure
*'''[[Imagination inflation]]:''' imagining an event that did not occur and having increased confidence that it did occur

==Modern==
Modern perspectives on cognitive psychology generally address cognition as a [[dual process theory]], expounded upon by [[Daniel Kahneman]] in 2011.&lt;ref name=Kahneman&gt;Kahneman D. (2003) "A perspective on judgement and choice." ''American Psychologist''. ''58'', 697–720.&lt;/ref&gt; Kahneman differentiated the two styles of processing more, calling them intuition and reasoning. Intuition (or system 1), similar to associative reasoning, was determined to be fast and automatic, usually with strong emotional bonds included in the reasoning process. Kahneman said that this kind of reasoning was based on formed habits and very difficult to change or manipulate. Reasoning (or system 2) was slower and much more volatile, being subject to conscious judgments and attitudes.&lt;ref name=Kahneman /&gt;

==Applications==

===Abnormal psychology===
Following the cognitive revolution, and as a result of many of the principle discoveries to come out of the field of cognitive psychology, the discipline of cognitive therapy evolved. [[Aaron T. Beck]] is generally regarded as the father of cognitive therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.med.upenn.edu/suicide/beck/index.html |title=University of Pennsylvania (N.D). Aaron T. Beck, M.D |publisher=Med.upenn.edu |date=2013-10-23 |accessdate=2014-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914094322/http://www.med.upenn.edu/suicide/beck/index.html |archive-date=2017-09-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His work in the areas of recognition and treatment of depression has gained worldwide recognition. In his 1987 book titled ''Cognitive Therapy of Depression'', Beck puts forth three salient points with regard to his reasoning for the treatment of depression by means of therapy or therapy and antidepressants versus using a pharmacological-only approach:
&lt;blockquote&gt;1. Despite the prevalent use of antidepressants, the fact remains that not all patients respond to them. Beck cites (in 1987) that only 60 to 65% of patients respond to antidepressants, and recent [[Meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] (a statistical breakdown of multiple studies) show very similar numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grohol |first=John M. |url=http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2009/02/03/efficacy-of-antidepressants/ |title=Grohol, J. (2009). Efficacy of Antidepressants |publisher=Psychcentral.com |date=2009-02-03 |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Many of those who do respond to antidepressants end up not taking their medications, for various reasons. They may develop side-effects or have some form of personal objection to taking the drugs.&lt;br&gt;3. Beck posits that the use of [[Psychotropic|psychotropic drugs]] may lead to an eventual breakdown in the individual's [[Coping (psychology)|coping mechanisms]]. His theory is that the person essentially becomes reliant on the medication as a means of improving mood and fails to practice those coping techniques typically practiced by healthy individuals to alleviate the effects of depressive symptoms. By failing to do so, once the patient is weaned off of the antidepressants, they often are unable to cope with normal levels of depressed mood and feel driven to reinstate use of the antidepressants.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, A.T. (1987). ''Cognitive Therapy of Depression''. New York, NY: Guilford Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Social psychology===
Many facets of modern social psychology have roots in research done within the field of cognitive psychology.{{Citation needed|reason=The reverse is also true, and the page linked in the next sentence also has a citation needed tag related to the link between social cognition and cognitive psychology.|date=November 2017}} [[Social cognition]] is a specific sub-set of social psychology that concentrates on processes that have been of particular focus within cognitive psychology, specifically applied to human interactions. [[Gordon Moskowitz|Gordon B. Moskowitz]] defines social cognition as "... the study of the mental processes involved in perceiving, attending to, remembering, thinking about, and making sense of the people in our social world".&lt;ref&gt;Moskowitz, G.B. (2004). ''Social Cognition: Understanding Self and Others''. New York, NY: The Guilford Press. (pp. 3)&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of multiple [[social information processing (theory)|social information processing]] (SIP) models  has been influential in studies involving aggressive and anti-social behavior. Kenneth Dodge's SIP model is one of, if not the most, empirically supported models relating to aggression. Among his research, Dodge posits that children who possess a greater ability to process social information more often display higher levels of socially acceptable behavior. His model asserts that there are five steps that an individual proceeds through when evaluating interactions with other individuals and that how the person interprets cues is key to their reactionary process.&lt;ref&gt;Fontaine, R.G. (2012). ''The Mind of the Criminal: The Role of Developmental Social Cognition in Criminal Defense Law''. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press. (p. 41)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental psychology===
Many of the prominent names in the field of developmental psychology base their understanding of development on cognitive models. One of the major paradigms of developmental psychology, the [[Theory of Mind]] (ToM), deals specifically with the ability of an individual to effectively understand and attribute cognition to those around them. This concept typically becomes fully apparent in children between the ages of 4 and 6. Essentially, before the child develops ToM, they are unable to understand that those around them can have different thoughts, ideas, or feelings than themselves. The development of ToM is a matter of [[metacognition]], or thinking about one's thoughts. The child must be able to recognize that they have their own thoughts and in turn, that others possess thoughts of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.child-encyclopedia.com/documents/Astington-EdwardANGxp.pdf |title=Astington, J.W. &amp; Edward, M.J. (2010). The development of theory of mind in early childhood. Encyclopedia on Early Childhood Development, 2010:1–6 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

One of the foremost minds with regard to developmental psychology, Jean Piaget, focused much of his attention on cognitive development from birth through adulthood. Though there have been considerable challenges to parts of his [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|stages of cognitive development]], they remain a staple in the realm of education. Piaget's concepts and ideas predated the cognitive revolution but inspired a wealth of research in the field of cognitive psychology and many of his principles have been blended with modern theory to synthesize the predominant views of today.&lt;ref&gt;Brainerd, C.J. (1996). "Piaget: A centennial celebration." ''Psychological Science'', 7(4), 191–194.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational psychology===
Modern theories of education have applied many concepts that are focal points of cognitive psychology. Some of the most prominent concepts include:
* Metacognition: Metacognition is a broad concept encompassing all manners of one's thoughts and knowledge about their own thinking. A key area of educational focus in this realm is related to self-monitoring, which relates highly to how well students are able to evaluate their personal knowledge and apply strategies to improve knowledge in areas in which they are lacking.&lt;ref name="Reif"&gt;Reif, F. (2008). ''Applying Cognitive Science to Education: Thinking and Learning in Scientific and Other Complex Domains''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press. (a pp. 283–84, b pp. 38)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Declarative knowledge]] and [[procedural knowledge]]: Declarative knowledge is a persons 'encyclopedic' knowledge base, whereas procedural knowledge is specific knowledge relating to performing particular tasks. The application of these cognitive paradigms to education attempts to augment a student's ability to integrate declarative knowledge into newly learned procedures in an effort to facilitate accelerated learning.&lt;ref name="Reif" /&gt;
* [[Knowledge organization]]: Applications of cognitive psychology's understanding of how knowledge is organized in the brain has been a major focus within the field of education in recent years. The hierarchical method of organizing information and how that maps well onto the brain's memory are concepts that have proven extremely beneficial in classrooms.&lt;ref name="Reif" /&gt;

===Personality psychology===
Cognitive therapeutic approaches have received considerable attention in the treatment of personality disorders in recent years. The approach focuses on the formation of what it believes to be faulty schemata, centralized on judgmental biases and general cognitive errors.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, A.T., Freeman, A., &amp; Davis, D.D. (2004). ''Cognitive Therapy of Personality Disorders'' (2nd ed.). New York: Guilford Press. (pp. 300).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive psychology vs. cognitive science==
The line between cognitive psychology and [[cognitive science]] can be blurry. The differentiation between the two is best understood in terms of cognitive psychology's relationship to [[applied psychology]], and the understanding of psychological phenomena. Cognitive psychologists are often heavily involved in running psychological experiments involving human participants, with the goal of gathering information related to how the human mind takes in, processes, and acts upon inputs received from the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;Baddeley, A. &amp; Bernses, O.A. (1989). ''Cognitive Psychology: Research Directions In Cognitive Science: European Perspectives'', Vol 1 (pp. 7). East Sussex, UK: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Ltd. (pg. 7)&lt;/ref&gt; The information gained in this area is then often used in the applied field of clinical psychology.

Cognitive science is better understood as predominantly concerned with gathering data through research. Cognitive science envelopes a much broader scope, which has links to philosophy, linguistics, anthropology, neuroscience, and particularly with artificial intelligence. It could be said that cognitive science provides the database of information that fuels the theory from which cognitive psychologists operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cognitive-science/ |title=Thagard, P. (2010). Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive scientists' research sometimes involves non-human subjects, allowing them to delve into areas which would come under ethical scrutiny if performed on human participants. I.e., they may do research implanting devices in the brains of rats to track the firing of neurons while the rat performs a particular task. Cognitive science is highly involved in the area of artificial intelligence and its application to the understanding of mental processes.

==Criticisms==
In the early years of cognitive psychology, [[Behaviorism|behaviorist]] critics held that the empiricism it pursued was incompatible with the concept of internal mental states. [[Cognitive neuroscience]], however, continues to gather evidence of direct correlations between physiological brain activity and putative mental states, endorsing the basis for cognitive psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gardner |first=Howard |title=Changing Minds |year=2006 |publisher=Harvard Business School Publishing |location=Boston, Massachusetts |isbn=978-1-4221-0329-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some observers have suggested that as cognitive psychology became a movement during the 1970s, the intricacies of the phenomena and processes it examined meant it also began to lose cohesion as a field of study. In ''Psychology: Pythagoras to Present'', for example, John Malone writes: "Examinations of late twentieth-century textbooks dealing with "cognitive psychology", "human cognition", "cognitive science" and the like quickly reveal that there are many, many varieties of cognitive psychology and very little agreement about exactly what may be its domain."&amp;#8201;&lt;ref name="Malone"/&gt;  This misfortune produced competing models that questioned information-processing approaches to cognitive functioning such as [[Naturalistic decision-making|Decision Making]] and [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences|Behavioral Science]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2813">The '''Ctistae''' or '''Ktistai''' ({{lang-el|κτίσται}}) were a group/class among the [[Mysians]] of ancient [[Thracians|Thracian]] culture.

The Mysians avoided consuming any living thing, and therefore lived on such foodstuffs as milk and honey. For this reason, they were referred to as "god-fearing"&lt;!--θεοσεβεῖς ''theosebeis''--&gt; and "capnobatae" ([[kapnobatai]]&lt;!--καπνοβάτας--&gt;) or "smoke-treading".

The Ctistae were a class of Mysians who not only observed these dietary restrictions, but abstained from cohabitating with women. They led [[celibacy|celibate]] lives, never marrying. They were held in a place of honor by the Thracians, with their lives being dedicated to the gods. They are described by [[Strabo]], sourcing [[Poseidonius]].
&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''{{plain link|url=http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-eng1:7.3 |name=Geography}}'' VII.3.3: and there are some of the Thracians who live apart from woman-kind; these are called "Ctistae," and because of the honour in which they are held, have been dedicated to the gods and live with freedom from every fear;&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Strabo, whether they took up celibacy or not they were collectively called Hippemolgi ("mare-milkers"), Galactophagi ("[[Lactarian|living on milk]]") or Abii ("not living (with women)").&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''{{plain link|url=http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-eng1:7.3 |name=Geography}}'' VII.3.3: , men most just," but he calls them "Abii" more especially for this reason, that they live apart from women, since he thinks that a life which is bereft of woman is only half-complete ;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparative analysis==
Strabo, in the same section notes that the Greeks confounded the Mysians with the Getae (or [[Geto-Dacians]]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''{{plain link|url=http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-eng1:7.3 |name=Geography}}'' VII.3.3&lt;/ref&gt;

That the Ctistae described by Strabo might be equivalent to the ''Polistai'' among the [[Dacians]] mentioned by [[Josephus]] in the [[Antiquities of the Jews]] Book 18, Chapter 1 paragraph 5 has been noted  early on by [[Joseph Justus Scaliger|Scaliger]] (d. 1609). He conjectured that some of the ascetics lived in groups and lived in  buildings, hence the distinction of being called ''Polistai'' "City-Dwellers" .&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor-last=Whiston |editor-first=William |author=Josephus Flavius|title=The Works of Flavius Josephus, the Learned and Authentic Jewish Historian and Celebrated Warrior |volume=3|place=Edinburgh |publisher=T. &amp; J.

This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Niger]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

The largest ethnic groups in [[Niger]] are the [[Hausa people|Hausa]], who also constitute the major ethnic group in northern [[Nigeria]], and the [[Zarma people|Zarma]] [[Songhai people|Songhay]] (also spelled Djerma-Songhai), who also are found in parts of [[Mali]]. Both groups are sedentary farmers who live in the arable, southern tier. The [[Kanouri]] (including ''Beri Beri'', ''Manga'') make up the majority of sedentary population in the far southeast of the nation. The remainder of the Nigerien people are nomadic or seminomadic livestock-raising peoples—[[Tuareg people|Tuareg]], [[Fula people|Fulani]],&lt;ref&gt;In {{lang-ff|Fulɓe}}; in {{lang-fr|Peul}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Toubou]] and [[Diffa Arabs]]. With rapidly growing populations and the consequent competition for meager natural resources, lifestyles of these two types of peoples have come increasingly into conflict in Niger in recent years.

Niger's high [[infant mortality]] rate is comparable to levels recorded in neighboring countries. However, the child mortality rate (deaths among children between the ages of 1 and 4) is exceptionally high (274 per 1,000) due to generally poor health conditions and inadequate nutrition for most of the country's children. Niger's very high [[total fertility rate]] (6.89 children born per woman, which is the highest in the world&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html&lt;/ref&gt;), nonetheless, means that nearly half (49%) of the Nigerien population is under age 15. School attendance is low (34%), including 38% of males and 27% of females. Additional education occurs through Koranic schools.

===UN estimates===
According to {{UN_Population|source}} the total population was {{UN_Population|Niger}} in {{UN_Population|Year}}, compared to only 2 462 000 in 1950. The proportion of children and teenagers below the age of 15 in 2010 was 49%, 48.8% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while only 2.2% was 65 years or older.&lt;ref name="WPP 2010"&gt;[http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat, World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506000000/http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm |date=May 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Philippines, disability is one of the social issues affecting a portion of the Philippines' population. To ensure the equality and rights of disabled persons, there are Philippine laws and policies that were passed regarding persons with disabilities (PWDs). There are also numerous non-government associations that seeks to encourage and help improve the wellbeing of people with disabilities.

The [[National Council on Disability Affairs (Philippines)|National Council on Disability Affairs (NCDA)]], formerly National Council for the Welfare of Disabled Persons or NCWDP, is the government body which focuses on the activities, issues, and concerns that are related to PWDs in the country. Their priority is to track and perform laws to ensure the protection of PWDs' political and civil rights. They also handle the annual "International Day of Persons with Disabilities in the Philippines" held on December 3 to advocate the rights and privileges of PWDs.

==Legal definition==
Section 4 of the Republic Act No. 7277 or the Magna Carta for Disabled Person lists the definition of Disability in the Philippines.

===Disabled person===
Disabled people in the Philippines are defined as people "suffering from restriction or different abilities, as a result of a mental, physical or sensory impairment, to perform an activity in the manner or within the range considered normal for a human being".&lt;ref name="magnacarta"&gt;{{cite web|title=Republic Act No. 7277|url=http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/research/Philippines/RA%207277%20-%20Magna%20Carta%20of%20Disabled%20Persons.pdf|website=University of Minnesota Human Rights Library|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impairment===
Impairment is defined as "any loss, diminution or aberration of psychological, physiological, or anatomical structure of function."&lt;ref name="magnacarta"&gt;{{cite web|title=Republic Act No. 7277|url=http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/research/Philippines/RA%207277%20-%20Magna%20Carta%20of%20Disabled%20Persons.pdf|website=University of Minnesota Human Rights Library|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disability===
Disability is defined as "(1) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more psychological, physiological or anatomical function of an individual or activities of such individual; (2) a record of such an impairment; or (3) being regarded as having such an impairment."&lt;ref name="magnacarta"&gt;{{cite web|title=Republic Act No. 7277|url=http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/research/Philippines/RA%207277%20-%20Magna%20Carta%20of%20Disabled%20Persons.pdf|website=University of Minnesota Human Rights Library|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Handicap===
Handicap is defined as "a disadvantage for a given individual resulting from an impairment or a disability, that limits or prevents the functions or activity, that is considered normal given the age and sex of the individual."&lt;ref name="magnacarta"&gt;{{cite web|title=Republic Act No. 7277|url=http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/research/Philippines/RA%207277%20-%20Magna%20Carta%20of%20Disabled%20Persons.pdf|website=University of Minnesota Human Rights Library|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
The [[Philippine Statistics Authority]] recorded a total of 1.443 million people in the Philippines (1.57% of the total population) has disability as of 2010 and categorized them according to age group, gender, and region.&lt;ref name="battlecry"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mawis|first1=Sara Mae|title=Addressing the battle cry of disabled persons|url=https://business.inquirer.net/239927/addressing-battle-cry-disabled-persons|accessdate=9 November 2017|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the [[Department of Social Welfare and Development]] made and published the results of the survey about Philippine households with PWDs with respect to their types of disability&lt;ref name="web.nlp.gov.ph"&gt;http://web.nlp.gov.ph/nlp/sites/default/files/20Mar2014/Persons%20with%20Disabilities%20by%20Edgardo%20garcia.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-government organizations==
The National Council on Disability Affairs regulates a list of non-government organizations officially partnered with the government. There are 8 NGOs recognized by the NCDA that cater to Filipino PWDs on a national level. Local government units also keep track of local non-government agencies or associations that cater to PWDs. Every city or municipality maintains a PWD Affairs Office under the office of the City Mayor that facilitates the needs of its constituents in the area. Some cities like Baguio City have required all their barangays to maintain a PWD Desk or Committee in order to efficiently reach out to their PWD constituents.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncda.gov.ph/organizations-directory/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://twh.org.ph/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government policies==
	The recognition of PWDs is stated in the 1987 Philippine Constitution. Article XIII, Section 13 states that “[t]he State shall establish a special agency for disabled person for their rehabilitation, self-development, and self-reliance, and their integration into the mainstream of society.” The established agency was named the National Council on Disability Affairs or NCDA.
	Some of the laws concerning PWDs include Republic Act No 7277 (Magna Carta for Disabled Persons), Batas Pambansa Blg. 344 (Accessibility Law), Republic Act 6759 (White Cane Act) and ILO Convention No. 159 (Vocational Rehabilitation of Persons With Disability).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncda.gov.ph/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic Act No. 7277===
	The Magna Carta for Disabled Persons is “an act providing for the rehabilitation, self-development and self-reliance of disabled persons and their integration into the mainstream of society and for other purposes.” It outlines the rights and privileges of disabled persons and the prohibition on discrimination of PWDs. It was ratified on March 24, 1992.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncda.gov.ph/disability-laws/republic-acts/republic-act-7277/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Batas Pambansa Blg. 344===
	The Accessibility Law is an act enhancing the mobility of disabled persons that requires buildings, institutions, establishments and public utilities to install some facilities and other devices. This law required the installation of sidewalks, ramps and railings for the PWDs in public spaces. It was ratified on December 7, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncda.gov.ph/disability-laws/batas-pambansa/batas-pambansa-blg-344/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic Act 6759===
	The White Cane Act declares August 1 of every year as White Cane Safety Day in recognition of the visually impaired PWDs’ need for assistance and as a reminder for the public of their duty to care for respect their brethren. The act was ratified on September 18, 1989.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncda.gov.ph/disability-laws/republic-acts/republic-act-6759/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 10754===
	This act is an expansion of the benefits and privileges of PWDs in the Philippines as an amendment to the Magna Carta for Disabled Persons. It highlights the basic and societal benefits and privileges of PWDs. It was signed on December 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncda.gov.ph/disability-laws/republic-acts/republic-act-no-10754-an-act-expanding-the-benefits-and-privileges-of-persons-with-disability-pwd/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qualifications=== 
	Persons with Disability (PWD) are those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others. 
	Identification Cards shall be issued to any PWD with permanent disabilities due to any one or more of the following conditions: psychosocial, chronic illness, learning, mental, visual, orthopedic, speech and hearing conditions. This includes persons suffering from disabling diseases resulting to the person’s limitations to do day to day activities as normally as possible such as but not limited to those undergoing dialysis, heart disorders, severe cancer cases and such other similar cases resulting to temporary or permanent disability.

===Benefits===
	Under R.A. 10754, the benefits of persons with disabilities (PWDs) are the following:

# 20% Discount and Value Added Tax Exemption on the purchase of certain goods and services such as Lodging Establishments, Restaurants, Recreation Centers, Purchase of Medicines and Foods for Special Medical Purposes, Medical and Dental Services, Diagnostic and Laboratory Fees and Professional Fees of Attending Doctors, Domestic Air and Sea Travel, Land Transportation Travel, Funeral and Burial Services for the Death of a PWD
# Educational Assistance
# Benefits from GSIS, SSS and Pag-Ibig based on their respective charters
# Special Discounts in Special Programs
# Express Lanes

===Tax benefits===
&lt;!---WP:NOTGUIDE, not meant to be a comprehensive directory of eligible goods and services---&gt;
The [[Bureau of Internal Revenue (Philippines)|Bureau of Internal Revenue]] provides tax benefits and privileges to qualified persons with disability (PWD) as well as their benefactor or someone who cares and lives with the PWD under Revenue Regulations 5-2017. The BIR already provides tax benefits as early as 2009 through RR 1-2009.

The beneficiaries of BIR's regulation entitles PWD and their benefactors to at least 20 percent [[Discounts and allowances|discount]] on the sale of select goods and services. RR 5-2017 specifically stated that benefactors regardless of citizenship must have [[Consanguinity|fourth civil degree of consanguinity]] or affinity with the PWD while the previous regulation, RR 1-2009 did not have this restriction.

== Education ==
The RA 7277 ensures that Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) have adequate access and opportunities to quality education. Under this Magna Carta for Disabled Persons, it is unlawful for any learning institution "to deny a disabled person admission to any course it offers by reason of handicap or disability."&lt;ref name="magnacarta" /&gt; In formulating educational policies and programs, the State should take into consideration special needs or requirements for PWDs, and it shall also encourage learning institutions to do the same. Financial assistance such as scholarships, student loan programs, subsidies, and other incentives are also granted by the State to "economically marginalized but deserving disabled students pursuing post secondary or tertiary education" in both public and private schools. At least five percent of the allocation of the Private Education Student Financial Assistance Program is set aside for students studying vocational and technical degree courses.&lt;ref name="magnacarta" /&gt;

Implementation of the Special Education program is also funded by the National Government, which shall ensure a complete, adequate, and integrated system of the program for disabled persons.

=== Special education ===
The [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education (DepEd)]] currently recognizes 648 [[Special education|Special Education]] (SPED) centers and regular schools in the Philippines offering the SPED program.  Out of the 648, 471 cater to elementary students while 177 cater to High School students.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/philippines/manila-bulletin/20170226/281947427625555|title=DepEd assures adequate for special kids|last=Hernando-Malipot|first=Merlina|date=February 26, 2017|website=pressreader|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the government or public special schools are [[Jose Fabella Memorial School]], NOH – School for Crippled Children, Philippine National School for the Blind, and Philippine School for the Deaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncda.gov.ph/list-of-sped-centers/government-special-schools/|title=Government Special Schools|last=|first=|date=|website=National Council on Disability Affairs|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SPED program offered by DepEd caters to learners with visual impairment, intellectual disability, learning disability, autism spectrum disorder, communication disorder, physical disability, emotional and behavioral disorder, multiple disability with visual impairment, and those who are orthopedically handicapped, chronically ill, and gifted and talented.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

A SPED program may include a [[Self-contained classroom|Self-contained/Special Class]] which is a separate class for one type of exceptionality, Itinerant Teaching or where a teacher provides direct consultations with the student at home or at school, or Inclusion wherein all children with different types of disabilities are taught together in one classroom. Enrolling a child with disability into a regular class may also be done through what is called [[Mainstreaming (education)|Mainstreaming]] or Integration. Under Partial Integration, a student in a special needs class joins regular students in non-academic activities such as physical education, arts programs, and work education. If qualified, the student can eventually join in regular academic subjects. On the other hand, a child with special needs going through Full Integration takes part in both regular academic and non-academic classes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

For universities and colleges, the [[National Council on Disability Affairs (Philippines)|National Council on Disability Affairs]] lists the following as those that accept students with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncda.gov.ph/universitiescolleges/|title=Universities/Colleges|last=|first=|date=|website=National Council on Disability Affairs|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equal employment ==
There are government policies that aims to promote the equal opportunity for employment of PWDs. Republic Act (RA) No. 10524 and Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 10524 ensures that a qualified employee with disability shall have the same terms and conditions of employment and the same compensation, privileges, benefits, fringe benefits, incentives or allowances as a qualified able-bodied person.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncda.gov.ph/disability-laws/republic-acts/republic-act-no-10524-an-act-expanding-the-positions-reserved-for-persons-with-disability-amending-for-the-purpose-republic-act-no-7277-as-amended-otherwise-known-as-the-magna-carta-for-persons/|title=Republic Act No. 10524 – An Act Expanding the Positions Reserved for Persons with Disability, Amending for the Purpose Republic Act No. 7277, as Amended, Otherwise Known as the Magna Carta for Persons with Disability|website=National Council on Disability Affairs|language=en|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, person with disability shall not be discriminated on the basis of disability that involves matters concerning all forms of employment, including conditions of recruitment, hiring and employment, continuance of employment, career advancement, and safe and healthy working conditions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncda.gov.ph/disability-laws/implementing-rules-and-regulations-irr/irr-of-ra-10524/|title=IRR OF RA 10524|website=National Council on Disability Affairs|language=en|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure that PWDs also get an opportunity in government agencies, offices, or corporal ions, one percent (1%) of all positions are reserved for persons with persons with disability and private corporations with more than a hundred (100) employees are encouraged to reserve at least one percent (1%) of all positions for PWDs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In accordance to this, the welfare of the PWDs must also be upheld and must not create or impose any burden on the PWD being employed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Republic Act No. 1179 is an act that that aims to help the blind and other PWDs in terms of employment. Through the establishment of the Vocational Rehabilitation Office, provides vocational rehabilitation services to PWDs to prepare them for suitable employment by adopting and maintaining the Vocational Rehabilitation Plan to facilitate the rehabilitation of disable individuals including the census and placement of employment opportunities.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ilsdole.gov.ph/a-study-on-employment-profile-of-persons-with-disabilities-pwds-in-selected-regions-in-the-philippines/|title=A Study on Employment Profile of Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) in Selected Regions in the Philippines {{!}} Institute for Labor Studies|website=ilsdole.gov.ph|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also studies about the employment of PWDs. In one study on the employment of PWDs in selected regions of the Philippines, most PWDs are being employed by private institutions, particularly PWD institutions that provide training and equip PWDs with necessary skills for jobs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Among these institutions are Vibes massage clinics, owned and managed by blind massage therapists and Tahanang Walang Hagdan, a rehabilitation center for physically-impaired individuals. Tahanang Walang Hagdan provides projects wherein they have a metal craft workshop and manufactures wheelchairs, educational toys, bags, and other novelty items. However, there are also companies that include hiring PWDs in their Corporate Social Responsibilities (CSR) like the Lamoiyan Corporation in Parañaque and economic zones like the [[Clark Development Corporation]] (CDC).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Asia Foundation's Fully Abled Nation (FAN) program through the partnership of The Australian Embassy and The [[The Asia Foundation|Asia Foundation]] in the Philippines also created a campaign, "May 1% Ka Ba" whose goal is to improve the employment percentage of PWDs through the promotion of inclusive employment in accordance to RA 10524.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://asiafoundation.org/2018/05/04/new-campaign-launches-to-increase-employment-for-persons-with-disabilities-in-the-philippines/|title=New Campaign Launches to Increase Employment for Persons with Disabilities in the Philippines - The Asia Foundation|date=2018-05-04|work=The Asia Foundation|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, [[United Nations]] (UN) set the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDG) as a set of goals to be accomplished by the year 2030 and Philippines is one among the 149 countries that are participating in this global call of action. The SDGs aim to build on the work of the previous [[Millennium Development Goals|Millenium Development Goals]] (MDG) in order to address poverty, inequality and climate change. SDG Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth aims to promote the equal employment for all. The goal is by 2030, everyone including young people and persons with disabilities achieve full and productive employment as well as an equal pay for work of equal value.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Employment incentives ===
RA 10524 and its IRR aims to provide equal work opportunities to PWDs, promote rehabilitation, self-development, self-reliance and affirmation of PWDs as productive members of society while providing benefits for the private sector. Private corporations that employ PWDs receive an additional deduction of 25% from the private corporation’s gross income of the total amount paid as salaries and wages to PWDs.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pwc.com/ph/en/taxwise-or-otherwise/2017/employment-of-pwds.html|title=Employment of PWDs|last=PricewaterhouseCoopers|work=PwC|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to receive this deduction they must submit a proof of employing PWDs registered in the [[Department of Labor and Employment (Philippines)|Department of Labor and Employment]] (DOLE) and [[Department of Health (Philippines)|Department of Health]] (DOH). There is also an additional deduction from their net income if their modified facilities cater to PWDs given that these modifications are separate from the requirement of Batas Pambansa (BP) Blg, 344, or the Act to Enhance the Mobility of Disabled Persons.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''''Eaton vs. Boston, Concord &amp; Montreal Railroad''''' (B., C. &amp; M.R.R.) was a [[New Hampshire Supreme Court]] case decided in 1872 between farmer Ezra B. Eaton and the railroad company.&lt;ref name=eaton&gt;Eaton v. Boston, C. &amp; M.R.R., 51 N.H. 504 (1872)&lt;/ref&gt; Eaton asked the court to decide if B., C. &amp; M.R.R. flooding of his farm was considered a "taking" under the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment's]] [[eminent domain]] clause, and if the railroad was responsible for compensation to the farmer for the taking.&lt;ref name=eaton /&gt; The court asked if "a release of all damages on account of the laying out or construction of a railroad through and over the land of the releasor, does not cover damages occasioned to the remaining land of the releasor by the construction of the railroad over the land of other persons".&lt;ref name=eaton1&gt;Eaton v. Boston, C. &amp; M.R.R., 51 N.H. 504 (1872), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; In 1851, after construction of the railroad, Eaton gave the defendants a [[warranty deed]] for the part of his farm where the railroad was located and signed the following release: "I, the subscriber, do hereby acknowledge that I have received of the Boston, Concord, &amp; Montreal Railroad the sum of two hundred and seventy-five dollars, in full for the amount of damages assessed to me by the railroad commissioners of the State of New Hampshire, in conjunction with the selectmen of Wentworth, on account of the laying out of the said Boston, Concord, &amp; Montreal Railroad through and over my land; and I do hereby release and discharge the said corporation from said damages".&lt;ref name=eaton1 /&gt;

The case deals with the legal concepts of eminent domain and [[strict liability]] (which received attention as a result of the need to address new and expanding issues created by the emergence and growth of railroads in the United States during the nineteenth century),&lt;ref name=ely /&gt; and occupies a significant place in the historical background of eminent-domain and property-rights cases which emerged with the development of the railroads.

=={{anchor|Background}}Background and related cases==
===Facts of the case===
Eaton, a [[Wentworth, New Hampshire]] farmer, brought a civil action for damages (the flooding of his farm) against the B., C. &amp; M.R.R.&lt;ref name=eaton /&gt; During construction of a road needed to build the railroad the company cut deeply into a ridge bordering Eaton's farm, removing a natural barrier to floods on surrounding farms (including Eaton's).&lt;ref name=eaton /&gt; As a result of the cut into the ridge several farms (including Eaton's) were damaged by flooding, which deposited sand and stone and prevented cultivation: "In consequence of this removal [natural barrier], the waters of the river, in times of floods and freshets, sometimes flowed on to E.'s land, carrying sand, gravel, and stones thereon".&lt;ref name=eaton1 /&gt; Eaton had signed a [[waiver of damages]] releasing the company from liability for the "laying out of railroad over his land," for which he was compensated.&lt;ref name=eaton /&gt; The defendants argued that Eaton's 1851 release waived their liability for the damage caused by the flooding of his property. The court ruled that the waiver only protected the railroad from liability resulting from the taking of Eaton's property "for the laying out of road" and not for damages resulting from the "construction" of the railroad (which caused the flooding of Eaton's land), noting that "&amp;nbsp;... this was a taking of E.'s property, within the meaning of the constitutional prohibition; and that the legislature could not authorize the infliction of such an injury without making provision for compensation".&lt;ref name=eaton1 /&gt;

The case, like similar ones involving railroads during the late 19th century, dealt with new legal issues and created precedents for law emerging from the development of the railroad system.&lt;ref name=ely /&gt; Because the railroad was a new technology, courts in the past had not been faced with these issues. ''Eaton'' addressed legal and regulatory issues which emerged during the years after the 1872 decision: the exercise of power conferred by charter and eminent-domain questions (what constitutes a taking, what is considered public good and what is just compensation).&lt;ref name=ely71&gt;Ely, James, W. Railroads and American law. Lawrence, Kansas: University Press of Kansas, 2001. p.71&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1870 much railroad law favored the industry, but Ely notes that after 1870 "&amp;nbsp;... lawmakers gradually shifted their focus toward controlling the behavior of the iron horse".&lt;ref name=ely71 /&gt;

===''Northern Transportation Company of Ohio v. Chicago'' (1878)===
====Introduction====
This is a notable late-19th-century eminent-domain case because it makes a distinction between what is (and is not) eminent domain. In this case, unlike '' Eaton '', no invasion was made to the property holder during the construction of a tunnel as part of a public-works project. The plaintiff was inconvenienced by construction, which included a [[cofferdam]] blocking its riverside access. Earlier in the century, mill cases involving private property owners raised questions about dominion rights over one's land (for example, the right of an owner to obstruct the flow of water from an adjacent steam shared by another landowner.&lt;ref name=hor /&gt; These early cases usually sided with [[common law]], which forbade the obstruction or manipulation of water flow from an adjacent stream to deprive another landowner of the right to fully enjoy his land.&lt;ref name= hor /&gt;

====Facts====
The Northern Transportation Company, in [[Ohio]], owned and operated a line of steamers running from [[Ogdensburgh]] along the [[Chicago River]] to Chicago.&lt;ref name=ntrans&gt;N. Transp. Co. v. City of Chicago, 99 U.S. 635, 25 L. Ed. 336 (1878), pp. 1&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to a dock and wharf rights, the company owned a lot in Chicago housing its offices and a shed where the steamers were stored and maintained. The east portion of the lot faced [[LaSalle Street]], and the south portion faced the [[Chicago River]].&lt;ref name=ntrans /&gt; The city began construction of a tunnel under the Chicago River and along LaSalle Street in 1869.&lt;ref name=ntrans /&gt; Part of the construction involved excavating a portion of LaSalle street around the southeast portion of the Northern Transportation Company lot.  The excavation allegedly caused the walls on the southeast portion of the plaintiff's lot to sink and crack.&lt;ref name=ntrans /&gt; In addition to the damages caused by the excavation of a portion of LaSalle Street, the plaintiff alleged that during construction a cofferdam was built in front of its dock which prevented "the enjoyment of their land" by blocking its warehouse doors. This left its sole access an entrance on Water Street, leaving its storage and maintenance inaccessible and requiring the plaintiff to rent an adjacent space.&lt;ref name=ntrans /&gt; The plaintiff also argued that as a result of the cofferdam construction, it could not bring boats to the dock to land freight or passengers;&lt;ref name=ntrans /&gt; the LaSalle Street excavation was [[negligent]] and improper for the type of work performed. The plaintiff alleged damages to its warehouse, including the cracking and falling of walls.&lt;ref name=ntrans /&gt; Although access to the lot from the river and street was obstructed from time to time, the court held that these were "incidental inconveniences" to which the plaintiff must submit to allow the public to benefit from the tunnel.&lt;ref name=ntrans /&gt; According to the court, the only question remaining for a jury to decide was whether the LaSalle Street excavation was conducted in an "unskillful" or "negligent" way (causing part of the building's walls to fall). A judgement was decided in favor of the defendant. The court noted that unlike ''Eaton'', where there was a physical invasion of the real estate, the construction merely inconvenienced the plaintiffs and did not amount to eminent domain.&lt;ref name=ntrans /&gt;

===''Gibson v. United States'' (1897)===
====Introduction====
''Gibson'' is also important in the history of eminent-domain cases such as ''Eaton''. Both cases, dealing with the Fifth Amendment's eminent-domain clause, focus on its meaning in relation to the construction of an entity which damages private property. In ''Eaton'', the damage is a subsidiary effect of the removal of a natural land barrier by a railroad during the construction of a road required to continue construction of a railroad line. In ''Gibson'', under the [[Rivers and Harbors Act#List of later acts|River and Harbor Acts of 1884 and 1886]] Congress authorized the construction of a [[levee]] about {{convert|2200|ft}} long along a portion of the [[Ohio River]] near [[Neville Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Neville Island]]. As a result of the levee's construction, the Gibson farm landing (occupying part of the levee's location and necessary to navigate to the channel to deliver farm produce to buyers) was partially blocked. In ''Gibson'' (unlike ''Eaton'') the court decided in favor of the government, noting that it was not responsible for the damage to Gibson's farm (the alleged devaluation of the acreage).

====Facts====
Gibson owned a farm along the Ohio River near Neville Island, {{convert|9|mi}} west of [[Pittsburgh]],&lt;ref name=gib&gt;Gibson v. United States, 166 U.S. 269, 17 S. Ct. 578, 41 L. Ed. 996 (1897)&lt;/ref&gt; The farm provided strawberries, raspberries, potatoes, melons, apples and peaches to Pittsburgh via the [[Allegheny River]].&lt;ref name=gib /&gt; The River and Harbor Acts of July 5, 1884 (23 Stat. 133, 147) and August 5, 1886 (24 Stat. 310, 327) authorized construction of a levee "to concentrate the water-flow in the main channel of the Ohio river, beginning at a point on said Neville island 400 feet east of the claimant's farm, and running in a northwesterly direction with the main or navigable channel of the said Ohio river to the outer point of a bar in said river known as 'Merriman's Bar'&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref name=gib1&gt;Gibson v. United States, 166 U.S. 269, 17 S. Ct. 578, 41 L. Ed. 996 (1897), pp. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The levee's construction "substantially destroyed the landing of the claimant, by preventing the free egress and ingress to and from said landing on and in front of the claimant's farm, to the main or navigable channel of said river".&lt;ref name=gib1 /&gt; As a result, the claimant was unable to use her land for the shipment of farm products to buyers.&lt;ref name=gib /&gt;  It was also claimed that as a result of the levee's construction, Gibson's land (which "was worth $600 per acre before the construction") had depreciated to "$150 to $200 per acre" and Gibson claimed that the total loss of land value "exceed[ed] the sum of $3,000".&lt;ref name=gib /&gt; The farm, with hindered access to a navigable channel of the Ohio River (necessary for the transportation of produce), was damaged and devalued. This category of eminent domain, known as [[regulatory taking]], predominated during the early 19th century during early mill cases in which adjacent [[Riparian zone|riparian]] landowners were prevented from obstructing streams relied on by other properties.&lt;ref name=hor&gt;Horwitz, Morton, J. The Transformation of American Law: 1780–1860. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Gibson'', the court ruled that the claimant was not entitled to the recovery of damages and the United States was not responsible for the presumptive regulatory taking of Gibson's land by the construction of a levee obstructing the farmer's landing and reducing shipping from the farm.&lt;ref name=gib /&gt;

The railroad's development, connecting the U.S. during the late 19th century, did what the steamboat had done to colonize the [[Louisiana Territory]] and much of the South at the beginning of the century.&lt;ref name=ely /&gt; Through an intricate canal system funded by local governments, steamboat travel was made possible to much of the southern United States during the 19th century. While the railroad developed its infrastructure, canals continued to be expanded.&lt;ref name=ely /&gt;

The first industry in U.S. history to be extensively regulated, the railroad's impact was widespread;&lt;ref name=ely /&gt; the nation's legal system developed as a reaction to policies attempting to regulate the railroads. From 1891 to 1906, nearly 25 percent of cases heard by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] were railroad-related.&lt;ref name=ely&gt;Ely, James, W. Railroads and American law. Lawrence, Kansas: University Press of Kansas, 2001.)&lt;/ref&gt; According to James W. Ely, "The law of railroads reflected the goals and concerns of American society".&lt;ref name=ely /&gt;

==={{anchor|Property rights: a shift in the classical legal orthodoxy}}Property rights: a shift in legal orthodoxy===
The change in a judicial ideology about property rights during the early 19th century had far-reaching effects on the later development of the railroad.&lt;ref name=hor /&gt; Beginning with mill cases during the late 18th century, courts began to change the application of common-law property rights.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Horwitz, Morton, J. The Transformation of American Law: 1780–1860. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1977. p.35)&lt;/ref&gt; Two major common-law assumptions existed which would later be challenged in emerging disputes involving the rights of mill owners to obstruct the natural flow of streams adjacent to their property. Eighteenth-century English common law considered artificial influence to streams impermissible.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; A judge deciding a case in the New Jersey Supreme Court wrote, "The right to enjoyment of land is a basic attribute of dominion over property".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Horwitz, Morton, J. The Transformation of American Law: 1780–1860. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1977. p.36)&lt;/ref&gt; This premise was based on the belief that the diversion or obstruction of streams adjacent to multiple property owners, without the consent of all interested parties, was an infringement of the natural right of enjoyment of one's land. Courts favored anti-developmental claims over economic development.&lt;ref name=hor /&gt; "Conflicts over the use of land were invariably resolved in favor of economic inactivity".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In 1783, courts began upholding the rights of new property owners to develop their land for economic purposes.&lt;ref name=hor /&gt; In ''Shorey v. Gorrell'' (a case decided by the Massachusetts Supreme Court in 1783), "without long usage sufficient to confer a prescriptive right, there is no legal basis for preventing newcomers from obstructing a stream."&lt;ref name=hor /&gt; The mill cases highlighted the pro-economic favoritism of the judiciary, an initiative contradicting 18th-century common-law orthodoxy.&lt;ref name=hor /&gt; As the railroads emerged, many cases between private landowners such as Ezra B. Eaton and railroads accused of violating property rights would encounter pro-economic judicial forces (often deciding in favor of enterprises yielding the greatest economic benefit for the community or state) and overshadowing the preceding century's common-law principles.&lt;ref name=hor /&gt; Horwitz wrote about some of the insights of the new judiciary, "Some attempted the modification of common-law definition of injury to permit extensive, uncompensated use of water for business purposes".&lt;ref&gt;Horwitz, Morton, J. The Transformation of American Law: 1780–1860. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1977. p.36-37)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1805 ''Palmer v. Mulligan'', the New York Supreme Court asserted for the first time that upstream land owners could obstruct the flow of water for mill use.&lt;ref name=hor /&gt; The court reasoned that to prevent a newcomer from obstructing part of a stream would inherently confer exclusive rights to "whomever first built a dam," and resolved that "competition and rivalry is always good for [the] public".&lt;ref&gt;Horwitz, Morton, J. The Transformation of American Law: 1780–1860. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1977. p.37)&lt;/ref&gt;  The outcome of this case set a legal precedent, used by pro-economic judges tasked with determining injury related to water and property rights. The reasonable-use test, or [[balancing test]], became the threshold in determining the merits of an injury caused to a property owner by the obstruction of naturally-flowing water by another. As its name implies, the reasonable-use test gave precedence for the first time to a property owner's right to use their land for economic development (regardless of the development's detriment to another property owner).&lt;ref name=hor /&gt; In 1818, following Mulligan, ''Platt v. Johnson'' upheld  upstream mill owners' right to obstruct streams adjacent to downstream property owners. This case exemplified a shift in the judiciary favoring pro-economic-development land rights, citing the common-law maximum ''sic utere'' ("use it thus")—the shortened version of ''sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas'' ("use [what is] yours so as not to harm [what is] of others")—to justify property owners' use of land for economic interests (contradicting the maxim's original meaning).&lt;ref name=hor /&gt; In ''Shorey'', ''Mulligan'' and ''Johnson'', the  early 19th-century courts introduced the view that injury was determined by "relative efficiencies of conflicting property uses" (as opposed to the English common-law tradition ensuring a natural right of enjoyment).&lt;ref name=hor /&gt;

===Canals and exclusive franchise rights===
With a system of interconnected canals and rivers, a new form of transportation connected the colonies and encouraged westward development. The early 19th century's steam-powered boats  did for the transportation infrastructure what the railroads would do in the second half of the century.&lt;ref name=ely /&gt; Railroads were expensive, and obtaining funding for a system of interconnected track crossing municipalities and states was challenging. Much investment had developed a canal system in the U.S., which was threatened by more cost-effective transport.&lt;ref name=ely /&gt; As a result, canal companies resisted railroad agreements allowing the construction of rail lines along existing canals.&lt;ref name=ely /&gt; Receiving earlier charters, canals used this as an argument for exclusivity.&lt;ref name=ely /&gt; From the 1820s through the 1830s, canal attacks on the legitimacy of railroad charters were successful. In 1832, ''Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company v. Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road Company'' involved a dispute over the [[Potomac River]] valley and proprietary rights to land selection.&lt;ref name=ely /&gt; Although both parties had rights to purchase the land, the court upheld the exclusive privilege of the canal company.&lt;ref&gt;Ely, James, W. Railroads and American law. Lawrence, Kansas: University Press of Kansas, 2001. p.4)&lt;/ref&gt; This threatened new railroad ventures, since the court’s decision protected the canal company’s right to purchase land (excluding potentially-viable rail companies from doing so).&lt;ref name=ely /&gt; However, in 1837 the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] rejected the premise of exclusive privilege in purchasing rights in ''Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge''.&lt;ref name=ely /&gt; Citing jeopardy to the development of modern transportation that allowing a proprietary right to purchase land through the conferred exclusivity of a charter would create, the court struck down any assumed exclusive purchasing rights by canal companies.&lt;ref&gt;Ely, James, W. Railroads and American law. Lawrence, Kansas: University Press of Kansas, 2001. p.5)&lt;/ref&gt; This decision benefited the railroads, allowing rail companies equal opportunity to purchase land for development and stimulating growth in railroad infrastructure.

==={{anchor|Monopoly model of development}}Monopoly development model===
The conflict between local economic interests and the need for a national transportation network was demonstrated in the [[Erie War]].&lt;ref&gt;Ely, James, W. Railroads and American law. Lawrence, Kansas: University Press of Kansas, 2001. p.12)&lt;/ref&gt; Railroad development primarily followed a monopoly development model during the first half of the 19th century. Building railroads required a large capital investment. While many canals and turnpikes remained in operation, it was becoming clearer that railroad flexibility and efficiency would eclipse contemporary transportation and freight networks. Local and state governments with a vested economic interest in canals and turnpikes, who would hold heavier interests in railroads, desired to protect their investment. Although early railroads were funded by local investors, state and local economic interests relied on their performance.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Ely, James, W. Railroads and American law. Lawrence, Kansas: University Press of Kansas, 2001. p.13)&lt;/ref&gt; Local governments were eager to invest in railroads through bonds, since local development promised to benefit the local economy.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; In 1832 the New Jersey state legislature issued exclusive charter rights to the Camden and Amboy Railroad Company, exclusively authorizing it to carry passengers and goods across New Jersey and between New York City and Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; "The Camden and Amboy was immediately a financial success, and the payment of dividends and transit duties constituted the principal source of revenue in the state budget."&lt;ref&gt;Ely, James, W. Railroads and American law. Lawrence, Kansas: University Press of Kansas, 2001. p.11-12)&lt;/ref&gt; The monopoly model was advantageous as a first step in railroad development, allowing secured private investments in doubtful ventures.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;  As railroads became a promising source of revenue for local and state governments, legislative precautions were taken to sustain the exchange. Mandated track-gauge differences were a primary way for state and local governments to ensure that rival out-of-state railroads could not interconnect and bypass local lines.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2507">'''Engsh''' is a [[Cant (language)|cant]] that originated in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Nortier, Jacomine |editor2=Svendsen, Bente A.|title=Language, Youth and Identity in the 21st Century|date=March 2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107016989}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Sheng slang|Sheng]] developed in the poorer parts of Nairobi, Engsh evolved among the youth of the richer, more affluent neighbourhoods. Engsh is English based, but mixes Swahili, and other ethnic languages such as [[Gikuyu language|Kikuyu]] and [[Luo languages|Luo]]. However, just like Sheng, it is a code, and therefore cannot be understood, for the most part, by standard English speakers. Both Engsh and Sheng originated as  secret codes against adults, to enable Nairobi youth to communicate with each other in a language the adults could not understand. The original speakers have since become adults, and parents. Both Engsh and Sheng evolve very fast, and the ability to keep up with the "in" words of the moment becomes harder the older a person gets, therefore they are still considered languages of the youth.

In the past, there was no distinction made between Sheng and Engsh, but the youth speakers of both languages noticed their inability to understand each other properly, as the languages had evolved differently primarily due to the different economic backgrounds. Nevertheless, there are still many similarities between Sheng and Engsh, but Engsh is unique enough to stand as a cant of its own.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1729">The '''Environmental Benefits Index''' is an index that has been used by the [http://www.fsa.usda.gov/FSA/webapp?area=home&amp;subject=landing&amp;topic=landing FSA] [[Farm Service Agency]] of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] since 1990 to rank farmers’ requests to enroll land into the [[Conservation Reserve Program]] during each general sign-up period.  The only enrollment mechanisms that do not use the index are the [[Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program]] and continuous enrollment, for which a total of {{convert|4|e6acre|km2}} has been reserved.

The index, as currently structured, assigns points for cost to the government and 6 other factors; 1) wildlife benefits, up to 100 points; 2) water quality benefits, up to 100 points; 3) on-farm [[erosion control]], up to 100 points; 4) enduring benefits, up to 50 points; 5) air quality benefits, up to 35 points; and 6) in a state or national priority area, 25 points.  Bids only are accepted if they exceed a threshold level that is determined after the total value of the benefits that each bid would provide are compared.

The index continues to be adjusted from general signup to general signup.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2701">'''German Haitians''' are [[Haiti]]an&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of [[Germany|German]] descent or Germans with Haitian citizenship.

==History==
The earliest known German settlement in [[Saint-Domingue]] was in [[Bombardopolis]], south of the [[Môle-Saint-Nicolas]]. About a thousand Germans came to Bombardopolis in the eighteenth century and managed to make a living with growing coffee. They received Haitian citizenship from [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] after 1804, and gradually mixed with the rest of the population. [[Henri Christophe]] had German military engineers designed the [[Citadelle Laferrière]] and supervised its construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prevalhaiti.com/messages/7983 |title=Haiti And The German Connection |accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, Haitian Germans controlled 80% of Haiti’s International Commerce. Though German Haitians only numbered about 200, they wielded a disproportionate amount of economic power. For example, they owned and operated utilities in [[Port-au-Prince]] and [[Cap-Haïtien]] but also controlled the Port-au-Prince main wharf. These Germans competed with the [[French people|French]] merchants over the customs receipts that represented Haiti’s flagrant debts to European creditors as well as control over Haiti’s vulnerable National Bank.&lt;ref name="FRG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northeastern.edu/haitinet/foreign-relations/#Germany |title=Haiti Net Foreign Relations |accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the US declared war on Germany in 1917, the Haitian government protested against the heavy German submarine activity in the area. Haiti expelled Germans from the country and Germany severed diplomatic ties with Haiti. This gave Haitians the excuse to officially declare war on July 14, 1918. German property was confiscated by the Haitian government and placed in liquidation. In 1918, Germans return to the island after the war, and resumed their old business, and re-acquired their possessions.&lt;ref name="FRG"/&gt;

[[File:Spiral Goddess symbol neo-pagan.svg|thumb|One version of the Spiral Goddess symbol of modern neopaganism]]

The '''Goddess movement''' includes spiritual beliefs or practices (chiefly [[Modern paganism|neopagan]]) which has emerged predominantly in North America, [[Western Europe]], Australia, and New Zealand in the 1970s. The movement grew as a reaction to perceptions of predominant organized religion as [[patriarchy|male-dominated]], and makes use of [[goddess]] worship and a focus on gender and [[femininity]].

The Goddess movement is a widespread, non-centralized trend in [[neopaganism]], and therefore has no centralized tenets of belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Goddess as Nature: Towards a Philosophical Thealogy|last=Reid-Bowen|first=Paul|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9780754656272|location=Oxon|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practices vary widely, from the name and number of goddesses worshipped to the specific rituals and rites used to do so. Some, such as [[Dianic Wicca]], exclusively worship female deities, while others do not. Belief systems range from [[monotheism|monotheistic]] to [[polytheism]] to [[pantheism|pantheistic]], encompassing a range of theological variety similar to that in the broader neopagan community. Common pluralistic belief means that a self-identified Goddess worshiper could theoretically worship any number of different goddesses from cultures all over the world.&lt;ref name="christ1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Christ |first=Carol P. |title=Rebirth of the Goddess: Finding Meaning in Feminist Spirituality |publisher=Routledge |date=1997 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a8Z2hPdEn1gC&amp;printsec=frontcover |isbn=978-1-1367-6384-7 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="christ2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Christ |first=Carol P. |title=She Who Changes: Re-imagining the Divine in the World |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan, |date=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kfiMP5nS3GEC&amp;printsec=frontcover |isbn=978-1-4039-6083-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on its characteristics, the Goddess movement is also referred to as a form of cultural religiosity that is increasingly diverse, geographically widespread, eclectic, and more dynamic in process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Daughters of the Goddess: Studies of Identity, Healing, and Empowerment|last=Griffin|first=Wendy|publisher=AltaMira Presss|year=1999|isbn=074250347X|location=Walnut Creek, CA|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
[[File:Ancient Akkadian Cylindrical Seal Depicting Inanna and Ninshubur.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Ancient [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] [[cylinder seal]] depicting the goddess [[Inanna]] resting her foot on the back of a lion while [[Ninshubur]] stands in front of her paying obeisance, c. 2334–2154 BC]]

Capitalization of terms such as "Goddess" and "Goddesses" usually vary with author or with the style guides of publications or publishers. Within the Goddess community, members generally consider it proper to capitalize the word "Goddess", but not necessary when generic references are made, as in the word "goddesses".

*'''Goddesses''' refers to a local or specific deities linked clearly to a particular culture and often to particular aspects, attributes and powers (for example: the [[Mesopotamia]]n goddess [[Inanna]]/[[Ishtar]]; [[Athena]]; or [[Hindu]] goddesses like [[Sarasvati]], the goddess of [[learning]], [[poetry]], music, [[artistic inspiration|inspiration]] and [[wisdom]]; and [[Lakshmi]] goddess of wealth and [[sovereignty]]).

One can regard a goddess (in this sense) as an aspect of the Great Goddess as well as a specific goddess with a particular role within a [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Pagan Book of Living and Dying: T/K|last=Starhawk|first=|last2=NightMare|first2=M. Macha|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|year=2013|isbn=0062515160|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindu goddess, [[Durga]], is a case in point. The name Durga can refer to a specific aspect of the Goddess but in the Shakti forms of Hinduism generally refers to the Great Goddess as AdyaShakti: ''the primordial Shakti'' who incorporates all aspects. [[anthropology|Anthropologists]] in their studies of goddesses have noted that adherents of goddesses often view their own goddess as a personal [[wiktionary:Guardian|guardian]] or teacher.

*'''The Goddess''' or '''the Great Goddess''' is a female deity that is regarded as primary. Such a religious system existed historically in many cultures, though not under the same names and not necessarily with the same traits. If there is a male god, his powers may be seen as deriving from her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Heide Göttner-Abendroth |last=Göttner-Abendroth |first=Heide |title=Matriarchal Mythology in Former Times and Today (pamphlet), |publisher=Crossing Press |date=1987 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; These terms are ''not'' usually understood to refer a single deity that is identical across cultures but rather a concept common in many ancient cultures, which those in the Goddess movement want to restore.&lt;ref name=christ1997/&gt; When Goddess is spoken of as a personal guardian, as in 'my Goddess' it means 'my worldview in Goddess spirituality.'
*'''Goddess Spirituality''' is sometimes used as a synonym for Goddess Movement and sometimes as the spiritual practice that is part of the Goddess movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Embracing the Witch and the Goddess: Feminist Ritual-makers in New Zealand|last=Rountree|first=Kathryn|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2004|isbn=0415303583|location=London|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It could also refer to the Goddess Movement's ethos, particularly when used to construct Christianity as the diametrical opposite of the Goddess.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Christian Goddess Spirituality: Enchanting Christianity|last=Beavis|first=Mary Ann|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781138936881|location=New York|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the term becomes a distinguishing concept that sets the movement apart from Christianity with little room for overlap.
*'''Goddessing''' is a recent contribution to Goddess vocabulary, possibly derived from the British journal of the same name, following from [[Mary Daly]]'s linguistically suspect suggestion that deity is too dynamic, too much in process and changing continually, to be a noun, and should better be spoken as a verb (Daly 1973). Goddessing may also mean Goddess culture, Goddess way of life, Goddess practice, or 'my goddessing' as in my individual interpretation and experience of Goddess.
*'''Priestess''' refers to women who dedicate themselves to one or more goddesses. It may or may not include leadership of a group, and it may or may not include legal ordination. The analogous term for men is "priest." However, not everyone who dedicates themselves to the Goddess or goddesses calls themselves a priestess (or priest).
*'''[[Thealogy]]''' is a term whose first use in the context of feminist analysis of religion and discussion of Goddess is usually credited to Naomi Goldenberg, who used the term in her book ''Changing of the Gods''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Changing of the Gods: Feminism &amp; the End of Traditional Religions |first=Naomi |last=Goldenberg |location=Boston |publisher=Beacon Press |date=1979 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YF4tONp6Q_cC&amp;printsec=frontcover |ISBN=0-8070-1111-8 |pp=96–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; It substitutes the Greek feminine prefix "thea-" for the supposedly generic use of the Greek masculine prefix "theo-". Frequently used to mean analysis of Goddess thought and mysticism, it can also be used more liberally to mean any kind of divine, not just deity divine, as in meditation, ethics, ritual pragmatics.

== Background ==
In the 19th century, some [[first-wave feminism|first-wave feminists]] such as [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] published their ideas describing a female deity, whilst anthropologists such as [[Johann Jakob Bachofen]] examined the ideas of prehistoric matriarchal Goddess cultures. However, these ideas were largely ignored in the North America and much of Europe until [[second-wave feminism]]. In the 1960s and 1970s, feminists who became interested in the history of religion also refer to the work of [[Bertha Eckstein-Diener|Helen Diner]] (1965),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Bertha Diener |last=Diner |first=Helen |title=Mothers and Amazons |publisher=Julian Press |date=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose book ''Mothers and Amazons: An Outline of Female Empires'' was first published in German in 1932; [[Mary Esther Harding]] (1935),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harding |first=M. Esther, MD, |title=Woman's Mysteries: Ancient and Modern |publisher=Longmans, Green and Co |date=1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first significant Jungian psychoanalyst in the United States; [[Elizabeth Gould Davis]] (1971); and [[Merlin Stone]] (1976).
{{Women and Spirituality Trilogy}}
Since the 1970s, Goddess Spirituality has emerged as a recognizable international cultural movement. In 1978 [[Carol P. Christ]]'s widely reprinted essay "Why Women Need the Goddess,"&lt;ref name="Why Women"&gt;{{cite web |title=Why Women Need the Goddess |first=Carol P. |last=Christ |website=GoddessAriadne.org |publisher=Ariadne Institute |url=http://www.goddessariadne.org/#!why-women-need-the-goddess-part-1/cufo}}&lt;/ref&gt; which argues in favor of the concept of there having been an ancient religion of a supreme goddess, was presented as the [[keynote]] address to an audience of over 500 at the "Great Goddess Re-emerging" conference at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Carol Christ -- interviewed for the Signs out of Time project |website=Belili Productions |url=http://www.belili.org/marija/bios/carol_christ.html |access-date=October 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was first published in the ''The Great Goddess Issue'' of ''[[Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics]]'' (1978).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Christ |first=Carol P. |title=Why Women Need the Goddess |work=Heresies Magazine Issue #5: The Great Goddess |volume=2 |issue=1 |url=https://archive.org/stream/heresies_05#page/n9/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carol P. Christ also co-edited the classic feminist religion anthologies ''Weaving the Visions: New Patterns in Feminist Spirituality'' (1989) and ''Womanspirit Rising'' (1979/1989); the latter included her essay "Why Women Need the Goddess."&lt;ref name="Why Women"/&gt;

From 1974 to 1984, ''WomanSpirit'', a journal edited in Oregon by Jean and [[Ruth Mountaingrove]], published articles, poetry, and rituals by women, exploring ideas and feelings about female deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Circle of Power: Shifting Dynamics in a Lesbian-Centerd Community |first1=La Verne |last1=Gagehabib |first2=Barbara |last2=Summerhawk |publisher=New Vitroia Publisher |date=2000 |ISBN=1-892281-13-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zao3wTyYE6MC&amp;pg=PA61 |page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal ''The Beltane Papers'', which started publication at about the same time until mid-2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=I am sorry to announce that TBP is no longer in print. |website=THe Beltane Papers |url=http://thebeltanepapers.net/ |access-date=October 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, Jade River and Lynnie Levy founded the Re-formed Congregation of the Goddess, International (RCG-I) in Madison, Wisconsin. RCG-I continues today with groups called "Circles" in many U. S. localities, as well as an educational program, priestess training, and ordination. The Goddess movement has found voice in various films and self-published media, such as the [[Women and Spirituality: The Goddess Trilogy|''Women and Spirituality'']] trilogy made by Donna Read for the [[National Film Board of Canada]].

== Use of mythological materials ==
Participants in the Goddess movement often invoke myths. However skeptics claim that these have been reconstructed from ancient sources and others are modern inventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Charlotte |last=Allen |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2001/01/the-scholars-and-the-goddess/5910/ |title=The Scholars and the Goddess: Historically speaking, the 'ancient' rituals of the Goddess movement are almost certainly bunk |work=[[The Atlantic Monthly]] |date=January 1, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, these myths are not interpreted literally, but rather figuratively or metaphorically as reflecting ancient understandings and worldviews. For instance, creation myths are not seen as conflicting with scientific understanding but rather as being poetic, metaphoric statements that are compatible with, for example, the theory of evolution, modern cosmology, and physics.&lt;ref name=Starhawk1999&gt;{{cite book |last=Starhawk |title=The Spiral Dance: A Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Goddess |publisher=Harper |date=1999 |orig-year=1979 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XGzxpDzbqG8C |isbn=978-0-0621-2522-4 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Budapest1980&gt;{{cite book |last=Budapest |first=Zsuzsanna |title=The Holy Book of Women's Mysteries, Part II |publisher=Susan B. Anthony Books |date=1980 |isbn=978-0-9370-8103-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the bulk of mythological sources of the Goddess movement are ancient myths that predated the [[Patriarchal age|patriarchal period]] and, therefore, very little was written about them.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Robert Graves and the Classical Tradition|last=Gibson|first=A.G.G.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780198738053|location=Oxford|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the reflection of ancient understanding of these, there are adherents who also turn to contemporary scholarship and literature such as [[Robert Graves]]' ''[[The White Goddess]]''. Some of this work's interpretation of the Greek mythology such as the ritual year and annual sacrifice of the king were adopted as the basis to describe the goddess' aging and rejuvenation with the seasons.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Myths from ancient cultures are often reinterpreted as new evidence comes to light. Reinterpretation becomes necessary because myths from religions that included goddesses, those after the [[Bronze Age]], including Greek and Roman mythology, are believed to have a patriarchal bias. These new interpretations by Goddess movement authors and women scholars help to provide a truer mirror of the social set up of the period in which the story was written. The myth of Demeter and Persephone is one that has been reinterpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Christ |first=Carol P. |title=The Laughter of Aphrodite: Reflections on a Journey to the Goddess |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |date=1987
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qvwbAAAAMAAJ |p=109 |isbn=978-0-0625-0146-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Spretnak |first=Charlene |title=Lost Goddesses of Ancient Greece: A Collection of Pre-Hellenic Myths |publisher=Beacon |date=1978 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FFU-80jbkH4C&amp;pg=PA106 |pp=106–107 |isbn=978-0-8070-1343-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pollack1997&gt;{{cite book |last=Pollack |first=Rachel |title=The Body of the Goddess: Sacred Wisdom in Myth, Landscape and Culture |publisher=Element |date=1997 |isbn=978-1-8523-0871-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the Goddess movement highlights the legitimacy of the mythological sources from ancient matriarchal societies by citing that these were also behind key elements in [[Christianity]], particularly in the beliefs that "matriarchies fostering goddess worship influenced the attitudes of early Christians toward Mary" and that "the Catholic Church was originally matriarchal with [[Mary Magdalene]], not [[Saint Peter|Peter]], as its head."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What Every Catholic Should Know About Mary|last=McNally|first=Terrence|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|year=2009|isbn=9781441510525|location=|pages=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can also be demonstrated in the devotion to female Christian figures such as the female [[saint]]s, which the Goddess movement views as Christian continuities  of the ancient Goddess worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Bloomsbury Companion to New Religious Movements|last=Chryssides|first=George|last2=Zeller|first2=Benjamin|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|year=2014|isbn=9781441190055|location=London|pages=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theology ==
[[File:Rene Antoine Houasse - Minerva and the Triumph of Jupiter, 1706.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|''[[Minerva]] and the Triumph of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]'' by [[René-Antoine Houasse]] (1706), showing the goddess [[Athena]] sitting at the right hand of her father [[Zeus]] while the goddess [[Demeter]] sits in the background holding a [[scythe]]]]

Goddess Spirituality characteristically shows diversity: no central body defines its dogma. Yet there is evolving consensus on some issues including: the Goddess in relation to [[polytheism]] and [[monotheism]]; immanence, transcendence and other ways to understand the nature of the Goddess. There is also the emerging agreement that the Goddess fulfills the basic functions of empowering women and fostering ethical and harmonious relationships among different peoples as well as between humans, animals, and nature.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of Feminist Theology|last=Russell|first=David|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|year=1996|isbn=0664220584|location=Louisville|pages=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One question often asked is whether Goddess adherents believe in one Goddess or many goddesses: Is Goddess spirituality monotheistic or polytheistic?&lt;ref name=Eller&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Cynthia Eller |last=Eller |first=Cynthia |title=The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory: Why an Invented Past Won't Give Women a Future |publisher=Beacon Press |date=2000 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E0mvTyM6GVUC |isbn=978-0-8070-6793-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not an issue for many of those in the Goddess movement, whose conceptualization of divinity is more all-encompassing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Starhawk |title=Starhawk's Response to Charlotte Allen's Article Letter to the Editor of the ''Atlantic Monthly'' |date=January 5, 2001 |url=http://www.belili.org/marija/allen_response.html |access-date=January 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms "the Goddess", or "Great Goddess" may appear monotheistic because the singular noun is used. However, these terms are most commonly used as code or shorthand for one or all of the following: to refer to certain types of prehistoric goddesses; to encompass all goddesses (a form of [[henotheism]] ); to refer to a modern metaphoric concept of female deity; to describe a form of energy, or a process.&lt;ref name=christ1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=christ2003/&gt;&lt;ref name="Long1996"&gt;{{cite book |last=Long |first=Asphodel P. |title=In A Chariot Drawn By Lions: The Search for the Female in Deity |publisher=Crossing Press |date=1993 |isbn=978-0-8959-4576-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a singular divine being with many expressions is not a new development in thought: it has been a major theme in India for many centuries, at the very least as far back as the 5th century, though hymns in the early [[Veda]]s too speak of a one-Goddess-many-goddesses concept.&lt;ref name=Jayran2000&gt;{{cite web |last=Jayran |first=Shan |title=Presentation at Goddess Studies Colloquium |location=Bristol, U.K. |date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Within or without? ===
Another point of discussion is whether the Goddess is immanent, or transcendent, or both, or something else. Starhawk speaks of the Goddess as immanent (infusing all of nature) but sometimes also simultaneously transcendent (existing independently of the material world).&lt;ref name=Starhawk1987/&gt; Many Goddess authors agree and also describe Goddess as, at one and the same time, immanently pantheistic and panentheistic. The former means that Goddess flows into and through each individual aspect of nature—each tree, blade of grass, human, animal, planet; the latter means that all exist within the Goddess.&lt;ref name=christ1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=Starhawk1999/&gt;

Starhawk also speaks of the Goddess as both a psychological symbol and "manifest reality. She exists ''and'' we create Her" (italics hers).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Starhawk|1999|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Carol P. Christ (2003), describes what she sees as similarities between Goddess theology and [[process theology]], and suggests that Goddess theologians adopt more of the process viewpoint.

=== Deity vs metaphor ===
The theological variations that characterize the Goddess movement can also be classified into two: the views that describe the Goddess as a metaphor and those that consider the Goddess as a deity. The former emerged from among Jewish and Christian adherents and maintains that the Goddess serves as the means of talking about, imagining, or relating to the divine and this is demonstrated in the push to recover the feminine face of God based on scriptural and historical sources.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; On the other hand, the theology that the Goddess is a deity, with importantly and unchangeably female persona, emerged out of the feminists who came from polytheistic faiths such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Native American, and traditional African religions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The goddesses in this theology are rarely understood as metaphors or images since they have distinct individual features and that worshippers can interact with their suprahuman personages or symbols.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

== Ethics ==
[[File:Kaliposter1940s.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Modern, western depiction of the Hindu goddess [[Kali]], shown standing atop [[Shiva]], wearing a necklace of severed heads, in front of a fiery background]]

Although the Goddess movement has no specific code of behavior, there are commonly held tenets and concepts within the movement that form a basis for ethical behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Christ, |first=Carol P. |title=Musings on the Goddess and Her Cultural Despisers--Provoked by Naomi Goldenberg |date=2005 |url=http://www.belili.org/marija/carol_christ.html |access-date=January 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those participants in Goddess spirituality who define themselves as Wiccan, usually follow what is known as the [[Wiccan Rede]]: " 'An it harm none, do what ye will", ("an" being an archaic English word understood to mean "if", or "as long as"). Many also believe in the [[Threefold Law]], which states that "what you send (or do), returns three times over".&lt;ref name=Starhawk1999/&gt; Some traditions believe that this means it will be returned to the sender three times, or in a portion three times in volume, while others say it will instead be returned to the sender on three levels of being- physical, mental, and spiritual. Still others postulate that the number "three" is symbolic, meant to indicate a magnified karmic result for one's actions.

Some people in the Goddess movement honor the [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]] of Maiden, Mother, and Crone. The Maiden aspect of the Goddess shows women how to be independent and strong; the Mother aspect shows women how to be nurturing; and the Crone aspect shows that respecting elders is important and focuses on wisdom, change, and transformation.&lt;ref name=Starhawk1999/&gt;

Because the Crone aspect of the Goddess is understood by some to be destructive at times, some consider it to contain both positive and negative imagery and to present an ethical quandary. The Hindu Goddess [[Kali]], or Kali Ma, is often seen as an example of the Crone aspect. The concept is that the corrective force in a Dark Age must be a righteously directed dark force. Thus, to combat the demons of ignorance, ego, anger, etc., the darker aspect manifests. Later on, even her fierce image softens in the love of her devotees. Her duality is easily reconciled with the monism of Hinduism, which claims to understand the fundamental unity of truth as being impersonal and stratified in an ego-knotted existence (such as the human condition), and thus to the evil or unrighteous she is destruction personified and to the loving and moral devotee she is nothing but the love of the mother.&lt;ref name=Jayran2000/&gt;

Other Goddess ethical beliefs are that one should not harm the interconnected web of life, and that peace and partnership should be the goals, rather than war and domination. According to Goddess theologian [[Carol P. Christ]] the following are ethical touchstones:

{{quote|"Nurture life; Walk in love and beauty; Trust the knowledge that comes through the body; Speak the truth about conflict, pain, and suffering; Take only what you need; Think about the consequences of your actions for seven generations; Approach the taking of life with great restraint; Practice great generosity; Repair the web."&lt;ref name=christ1997/&gt;}}

The Goddess movement draws some of its inspiration from the work of archaeologists such as [[Marija Gimbutas]],{{cite book |last=Gimbutas |first=Marija |title=The Gods and Goddesses of Old Europe, 6500-3500 B.C.: Myths and Cult Images |publisher=University of California Press |date=1982 |orig-year=1974 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zKFFOoPlyjIC |isbn=978-0-5202-5398-8 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gimbutas2001&gt;{{cite book |last=Gimbutas |first=Marija |title=The Language of the Goddess: Unearthing the Hidden Symbols of Western Civilization |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |date=2001 |orig-year=1989 |isbn=978-0-5002-8249-6 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mellaart&gt;{{cite book |title=Catal-huyuk.

[[Heide Göttner-Abendroth]], working in the 1970s to mid 1980s, called these cultures "matriarchies", introducing a feminist field of "[[Modern Matriarchal Studies]]". She presented a theory of the transformation of prehistoric cultures in which the local goddess was primary and the male god, if any, derived his power from the goddess. In what she terms the "Downfall", which occurred at varying times throughout a multitude of cultures, the gods overcame the goddesses and made them subservient.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Göttner-Abendroth|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Göttner-Abendroth's terminology is [idiosyncratic]. The term "[[matriarchy]]" to describe these cultures has been rejected by many Goddess-movement scholars, especially those in North America, because it implies female domination as the reverse of the male domination present in patriarchy. These scholars make the point that such a reversal was not the case; rather these prehistoric cultures were egalitarian and had a social structure that included [[matrilineality]] - inheritance of assets and parentage traced through the maternal line.&lt;ref name=christ1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gimbutas2001/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dashu |first=Max |title=Knocking Down Straw Dolls: A critique of Cynthia Eller's 'The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory' |website=Suppressed Histories |url=http://www.suppressedhistories.net/articles/eller.html |access-date=December 30, 2005 |date=2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051203215431/http://www.suppressedhistories.net/articles/eller.html |archivedate=December 3, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eisler&gt;{{cite book |last=Eisler |first=Riane |title=The Chalice and the Blade: Our History, Our Future |publisher=HarperSanFrancisco |date=2011 |orig-year=1987 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-nWXwQzH3cC |isbn=978-0-0620-4630-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lerner |first=Gerda |title=The Creation of Patriarchy |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1986 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=szm-8WgGjWgC |isbn=978-0-1950-5185-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Riane Eisler]], cultures in which women and men shared power, and which worshipped female deities, were more peaceful than the patriarchal societies that followed.

{{cleanup|section|date=June 2009}}
[[File:AN00969955 001 l.jpg|thumb|Early nineteenth-century drawing depicting a [[statuette]] of a triple-bodied [[Hecate]]]]

[[Wicca]] regards "the Goddess", along with her consort the [[Horned God]], as a deity of prime importance. The earliest Wiccan publications described Wicca as a tribal goddess of the witch community, neither omnipotent nor universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gerald |last=Gardner |authorlink=Gerald Gardner (Wiccan) |title=The Meaning of Witchcraft |pages=26–27 |year=2004 |orig-year=1959 |edition=illustrated, reprint |publisher=Weiser Books |location=Boston |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=76Q9i-DzIY0C&amp;pg=PA26 |isbn=978-1-5786-3309-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many forms of Wicca have come to regard the Goddess as a universal deity, more in line with her description in the ''[[Charge of the Goddess]]'', a key Wiccan text. In this guise she is the "Queen of Heaven", similar to Egyptian goddess [[Isis]]; she also encompasses and conceives all life, much like the Greek goddess [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]. Much like Isis, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Betz |editor-first=Hans Dieter |editor-link=Hans Dieter Betz |title=The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation: Including the Demotic Spells |edition=second |volume=Volume 1: Texts |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-2260-4447-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; she is held to be the summation of all other goddesses, who represent her different names and aspects across the different cultures. The Goddess is often portrayed with strong lunar symbolism, drawing on various deities such as [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], [[Hecate]] and [[Isis]], and is often depicted as the Maiden, Mother and Crone triad popularized by [[Robert Graves]] (see [[#Triple Goddess|Triple Goddess]] below). Many depictions of her also draw strongly on [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]] goddesses. Some Wiccans believe there are many goddesses, and in some forms of Wicca, notably [[Dianic Wicca]], the Goddess alone is worshipped.

[[Image:Triple-Goddess-Waxing-Full-Waning-Symbol.svg|thumb|right|212px|The lunar [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]] symbol]]

Some, but not all, participants in the Goddess movement self-identify as [[witchcraft|witches]], [[Wicca]]ns or Wiccens. Other participants of the Goddess movement call themselves goddessians [https://web.archive.org/web/20051218212914/http://goddessmystic.com/Miscellaneous/about.shtml Goddessians] while others identify as the more generic "pagans".

Some witches, especially [[Dianic]]s, attempt to trace the historical origins of their beliefs to Neolithic pre-Christian cultures, seeing [[Wicca]]nism as a distillation of a religion found at the beginning of most, if not all, cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Zsuzsanna |last=Budapest |title=The Holy Book of Women's Mysteries |publisher=Red Wheel Weiser |date=2007 |orig-year=1989 |isbn=978-1-5786-3413-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They regard wise women and midwives as the first [[witch]]es. Dianic witchcraft first became visible in the 1970s, alongside the writings of [[Zsuzsanna Budapest]]. Her feminist interpretation of witchcraft followed a few decades after the acknowledgment of Wiccan culture by [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] in the 1940s. Today, there are at least 800,000 individuals who consider themselves Wiccan followers or witches in North America.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pieties and Gender|last=Sjrup|first=L.E.|last2=Christensen|first2=Hilda|publisher=BRILL|year=2009|isbn=9789004178267|location=Leiden|pages=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Gardner and Valiente advocated a proto-feminist ideal of priestess authority in service to the Wiccan God and Goddess. Covens in "traditional" Wicca (i.e., those run along the lines described by Gardner and Valiente) had and have pretty much equal [[leadership]] both of a priest and of a priestess; but often consider the priestess "[[prima inter pares]]" (first among equals) - according to the book ''A Witches' Bible'',&lt;ref&gt;

Doreen Valiente became known in Britain as the 'Mother of the Craft' and contributed extensively to Wicca's written tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heselton |first=Philip |author-link=Philip Heselton |date=2003 |title=Gerald Gardner and the Cauldron of Inspiration: An Investigation Into the Sources of Gardnerian Witchcraft |publisher=Capall Bann Publishing |isbn=978-1-8616-3164-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Leo Ruickbie |last=Ruickbie |first=Leo |title=Witchcraft Out of the Shadows:A Complete History |publisher=Robert Hale |date=2004 |isbn=978-0-7090-7567-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the author of The Witches' Creed, which lays out the basics of Wiccan religious belief and philosophy; including the polarity of the God and the Goddess as the two great "powers of Nature" and the two "mystical pillars" of the religion. One way to characterize the central male-female divine dyad in Wicca is to say that it's a duotheistic religion with a theology based on the divine gender polarity of male and female. 

The existence of witchcraft as the remnants of an old pagan religion as late as the [[early Modern Age]] was first suggested to a wide readership by [[Margaret Murray]]'s books, ''The Witch Cult in Western Europe'', ''The God of the Witches'' (1933) and ''The Divine King in England''. Her works have since been largely discredited by other scholars but have left a feminist legacy upon Wiccan culture.

[[File:Diane de Versailles Leochares.jpg|thumb|Roman copy of a Greek statue by [[Leochares]] of the goddess [[Artemis]], who was known to the Romans as [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]]]

Wicca and [[Neopaganism]], and to some extent the Goddess movement, were influenced by 19th-century occultism, such as the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Greer |first=Mary K. |title=Women of the Golden Dawn |publisher=Park Street Press |date=1995 |isbn=978-0-8928-1516-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and romantic nature movements in which both male and female were valued and honored as sacred, in contrast to and perhaps in reaction to mainstream Christian spirituality. Such views are described, for example, in the work of [[Robert Graves]], especially ''[[The White Goddess]]'' (the origin of the neopagan 'Triple Goddess' concept) and ''Mammon and the Black Goddess''.

Wicca was also heavily influenced by the ideas of alchemic symbolism, which emphasized the essential complementary polarity of male and female, and that characterized that basic duality or gender polarity as a partnership of the solar (male) and the lunar (female). In Wicca the moon is the symbol of the Goddess and the sun is the symbol of the God; and the central liturgical mystery and ritual act is "The Great Rite" or Hieros Gamos, which is a symbolic union of the God and the Goddess, as the primal male and female powers of the cosmos. In alchemy this was known as "the alchemical wedding" of the sun and the moon. In a parallel vein, traditional Wicca also draws heavily upon the Western Hermetic Tradition and its roots in the kabbalistic Tree of Life; where the twin pillars of masculine and feminine divine forces are joined by a Middle Pillar that encompasses and transcends both male and female. These "twin pillars" as they are shown in tarot decks are analogous to Valiente's depiction of the God and the Goddess as the two "mystical pillars." In this emphasis on the feminine as the equal and complementary polar opposite of the masculine, Wicca echoes not only kabalistic sources but also the polarity of yin and yang—feminine and masculine—in Taoism.

{{quote|The Dianic view is that separatism, in a world where gender roles were once strictly defined, is sometimes considered dangerous because it challenges what they see as patriarchal assumptions of Western culture.&lt;ref name=Budapest1980/&gt;}}

There are, however, Wiccan groups that do not subscribe to the male-female dualism of the divine. For instance, there is the case of the Budapest Dianics. Although these retained many Wiccan rituals and symbols, they only used female imagery and created a creation myth that eliminated the need for the male.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religion and American Cultures: An Encyclopedia of Traditions|last=Laderman|first=Gary|last2=Leon|first2=Luis|publisher=ABC_CLIO|year=2003|isbn=157607238X|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Wiccans also accept male members,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The SAGE Handbook of the Sociology of Religion|last=Beckford|first=James|last2=Demarath|publisher=Jay|year=2007|isbn=9781412911955|location=London|pages=576}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Dianics called themselves a "wimmin's religion" and, thus, rejected males from their ranks.

Later, in America came [[Starhawk]], activist and author of numerous books, as an influential author/priestess in the American Goddess movement. Her 1979 book, ''The Spiral Dance'', played a large role in popularizing the Goddess movement as well as modern Witchcraft among committed feminists, and is considered a classic of modern Paganism.&lt;ref name="Starhawk1999" /&gt;

Many non-Dianics, as well as Starhawk (herself considered to be one of Budapest's students), who also reject monotheistic patriarchal culture, do not agree with Z's justification for separatism. Starhawk's paganism was more broadly based and also drew on the [[Feri]] tradition of Witchcraft which, itself, incorporated Hawaiian, European, and Middle Eastern elements. She was initiated into the Feri tradition in California by [https://web.archive.org/web/20051227050038/http://www.lilithslantern.com/victor.htm Victor and Cora Anderson]. Starhawk is one of the founders of the [http://www.reclaiming.org Reclaiming Tradition] of Witchcraft, which includes both women and men, and which honors both the God and the Goddess.

First broadcast on [[PBS]] in 1988 as a documentary interview with [[Bill Moyers]], ''[[The Power of Myth]]'', written by [[Joseph Campbell]], was also released in the same year as a book created under the direction of the late [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Campbell |title=[[The Power of Myth]] |date=1988 |edition=first |publisher=Knopf Doubleday |pp=166–167 |isbn=978-0-3077-9472-7 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Power of Myth'' links the image of the Earth or Mother Goddess to symbols of fertility and reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|1988|loc=Chapter 6, "The Gift of the Goddess"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Love and the Goddess |series=Joseph Campbell and The Power of Myth |season=1 |number=5 |network=PBS |date=June 25, 1988 |url=http://www.tv.com/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth/love-and-the-goddess/episode/459330/summary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Campbell states that, "There have been systems of religion where the mother is the prime parent, the source... We talk of Mother Earth. And in Egypt you have the Mother Heavens, the Goddess [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], who is represented as the whole heavenly sphere".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|1988|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell continues by stating that the correlation between fertility and the Goddess found its roots in agriculture:

{{quote|'''Bill Moyers''': But what happened along the way to this reverence that in primitive societies was directed to the Goddess figure, the Great Goddess, the mother earth- what happened to that?}}
{{quote|'''Joseph Campbell''': Well that was associated primarily with [[agriculture]] and the agricultural societies. It has to do with the earth. The human woman gives birth just as the earth gives birth to the plants...so woman magic and earth magic are the same. They are related. And the personification of the energy that gives birth to forms and nourishes forms is properly female. It is in the agricultural world of ancient [[Mesopotamia]], the Egyptian [[Nile]], and in the earlier planting-culture systems that the Goddess is the dominant mythic form.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|1988|pp=166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Campbell also argues that the image of the [[Virgin Mary]] was derived from the image of [[Isis#Mother/Sister of Horus|Isis and her child Horus]]: "The antique model for the [[The Madonna|Madonna]], actually, is Isis with Horus at her breast".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|1988|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Joseph Campbell,

{{quote|...half the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Joseph |title=Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor |year=2012 |orig-year=2001 |publisher=ReadHowYouWant |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1Kw5OWibZ0oC&amp;pg=PA3 |isbn=978-1-4587-5773-9 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One of these metaphors is ''Eve''. Campbell argues that Christianity, originally a denomination of Judaism, embraced part of the Jewish pagan culture and the ''rib metaphor'' is an example of how distant the Jewish religion was from the prehistoric religion—the [[worship]] of the [[Mother Goddess]] or the [[Goddess]].

== Earth as Goddess ==
{{Further|Earth goddess}}
[[File:Aion mosaic Glyptothek Munich W504.jpg|thumb|Ancient Roman mosaic depicting the Greek goddess [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], lying on the ground with her four children, the personifications of the four seasons]]

Many people involved in the Goddess movement regard the Earth as a living Goddess. For some this may be figurative, for others literal. This literal belief is similar to that proposed by [[Gaia hypothesis]], and the Goddess-name [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] is sometimes used as a synonym for the Earth.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Women in World Religions: Faith and Culture across History [2 volumes]|last=de-Gaia|first=Susan|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2018|isbn=9781440848506|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Goddess-movement practitioners, Gaia personifies the entire earthly ecosystem and is the means to achieve harmonic symbiosis or the wholeness and balance within the natural worlds and physical environment.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Many of those in the Goddess movement become involved in [[ecofeminism]], and are concerned with environmental and ecological issues.&lt;ref name=Starhawk1987&gt;{{cite book |last=Starhawk |title=Truth or Dare: Encounters with Power, Authority, and Mystery |publisher=HarperSanFrancisco |date=1989 |orig-year=1987 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oDCjC1Tr0pgC |isbn=978-0-0625-0816-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goddess-movement adherents claim the hierarchical scheme giving humans dominion over the Earth (and nature) has led to lack of respect and concern for the Earth, and thus to what environmentalists identify as environmental crises,&lt;ref name=Eisler/&gt; such as [[global warming]]. Rather than having dominion over the Earth, Goddess-movement theorists see humans living as part of the Earth environment, and also refer to Earth as "Mother".&lt;ref name=Starhawk1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Budapest1980/&gt; Here, humans are considered on equal level with non-human inhabitants since all must be accorded the same moral and religious consideration, respect, and reverence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are sources who cite that this focus on the environment is one of the aspects that distinguishes the goddess movement with the [[New Age]] movement. This emerges as the former is sometimes mistaken as a subcategory of the latter due to the way the goddess movement draw from many resources that are New Age in character such as [[Western esotericism|esoterica]], [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery traditions]], [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]], [[astrology]], [[Divination|divinatory techniques]], and [[shamanism]], among others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Goddess as Nature: Towards a Philosophical Thealogy|last=Reid-Bowen|first=Paul|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|isbn=9780754656272|location=London|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both are also concerned with valuing one's self as inherently sacred. The goddess movement, on the other hand, is equally concerned with valuing the environment, including its human and non-human inhabitants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This attitude towards the environment is reflected in the way the movement view the concepts of [[female]]ness, the [[deity]], and [[politics]]. In comparison with the traditional theology where God is placed at the top of the hierarchical system, ruling over man and nature, the movement maintains that humanity and divinity must not be distinguished from nature or that earth is the body of the goddess and all beings are interconnected in the web of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Feminist Theology|last=Parsons|first=Susan|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0521663806|location=Cambridge|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reclaiming ==
{{Main|Reclaiming (Neopaganism)}}

[[Reclaiming (Neopaganism)|Reclaiming Witchcraft]] is an organization of [[feminist]] [[Witchcraft (contemporary)|modern Witchcraft]], aiming to combine the Goddess movement with [[political activism]] (in the [[Peace movement|peace]] and [[anti-nuclear movement]]s). "Reclaiming" was founded in 1979, in the context of the ''Reclaiming Collective'' (1978–1997), by two [[Modern paganism|Neopagan]] women of [[Jews|Jewish]] descent, [[Starhawk]] (Miriam Simos) and Diane Baker, in order to explore and develop feminist Neopagan emancipatory rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Salomonsen (2002:1)&lt;/ref&gt; The specific period of its founding can be traced back to the civil action during the 1970s called Diablo Canyon protest, which opposed the construction of a nuclear plant. 

The reclaiming is guided by a shared, "Principles of Unity, a document that lists the core values of the tradition: personal authority, inclusivity, social and environmental justice and a recognition of intersectionality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultural Appropriation in Spirituality: How deepening our understandings of settler-colonialism, race and privilege can help us reland our practices with humility, accountability, and reciprocity.|last=Witch's of East Van|first=|publisher=Witch's Union Hall|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly, Starhawk contributed a strong feminist stance drawn from the influences of the Dianic Wicca and [[Feri Tradition]], which is an eclectic kind of witchcraft taught by [[Victor Henry Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements, Volume 2|last=Lewis|first=James|last2=Tollefsen|first2=Inga|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780190466176|location=New York|pages=486}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starhawk maintained that [[Western world|Western societies]] suffer from a spiritual disease caused by the value systems of [[Abrahamic religions|patriarchal religion]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, which deny the nature of reality such as the way human habitation is conditioned on [[Ecology|ecological]] interrelation and [[Anthropology|anthropological]] interdependence; and the sexed, embodied nature of the elemental birthing power is female.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Halimzai is Sub-tribe of [[Mohmand]]. The '''Halimzai''' are the largest sub-tribe or clan of the [[Mohmand]]  [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] tribe.  

They live primarily in the [[Mohmand Agency]] of the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] (FATA) and also in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]] province of [[Pakistan]]. Part of their territory includes the historic Gandab valley that runs north west from Pir Killa (charsadda), a village on the Michni Shabqadar road, 32&amp;nbsp;km north of Peshawar.&lt;ref name=gso-mohmand&gt;[http://www.fata.gov.pk/subpages/mohmand.php FATA: Historical and Administrative Profile of the Mohmand Agency] retrieved 27 April 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310144210/http://www.fata.gov.pk/subpages/mohmand.php |date=10 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Along with the rest of the Mohmand, the Halimzai migrated to their current territory from central Afghanistan between the 13th and 15th centuries.&lt;ref name=gso-mohmand /&gt;

During the period of British rule they were self-governing.&lt;ref name=gso-mohmand /&gt;

==Political Importance==
This tribe is one of the strongest among other sub-tribe due its central location as Ghalanai is the capital of [[Mohmand Agency]] and Gandhab is the biggest Bazzar of Mohmand agency. Government mainly depends upon Halimzai tribe. Gandhab is divided into Upper and Lower Gandhab. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Halimzai subsections==

Halimzai is sub divided into the following three sub tribes.
 

1) Hamza Khel 2) Wali Baig 3) Kadi Khel .

== Governance ==
On 2 February 2009, a fifty-member [[Jirga]] of the Mohmand assured the government of its support against militancy and pledged to fulfil their consequent territorial responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=160459 The News International Pakistan] 3 February 2009, Halimzai tribe assures govt of support against militancy&lt;/ref&gt; In the past they have: handed over heavy weapons originating in Afghanistan, agreed to not to afford sanctuary to foreigners&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2007\08\28\story_28-8-2007_pg7_9 Daily Times], 28 August 2007, Tribes ink peace deal in Mohmand&lt;/ref&gt; and agreed to co-operate with the government in acting against those who damage public property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006\06\27\story_27-6-2006_pg7_14 Daily Times] 27 June 2006, Govt’s enemies are our enemies: Halimzai jirga&lt;/ref&gt; These agreements are enforced within their territory by taking internal action, with punishments that include fines, demolition of property and expulsions from the Agency.

Tribal elders from both the Halimzai and the [[Safi Clan|Safi]] have co-operated to avoid tensions between their respective communities and to control activities seen as objectionable to Pashtun society.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5219">[[File:Harrijasotzaile.jpg|thumb|260|An ''harri-jasotzailea'' lifting a stone.]]
'''Harri-jasotze''' refers to a popular [[Basque rural sports|rural sport]] in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] in which stones of various shapes and sizes [[Stone lifting|must be lifted off the ground]] and onto the shoulder.

The name is built on the [[Basque language|Basque]] [[Root (linguistics)|root]] ''harri'' "stone", the [[verb]] ''jaso'' "to lift", the [[Agent noun|agentive]] [[suffix]] ''-tzaile'' and the [[plural]] ending ''-ak'', so literally "stone lifters". It is also known as ''harri-jasotzea'' "stone lifting". In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] it is called ''levantamiento de piedra '' (stone lifting) and in [[French language|French]] the sport is called ''leveurs de pierres''.

==Rules==
[[File:Inaki Perurena Leioan.jpg|120px|thumb|Iñaki Perurena in 2008. In the background, cubic and round stones can be seen.]]
There are four main categories of stone in use today, all of which come with different weights. The weight of the stones is traditionally measured ''arroba'' (12.5&amp;nbsp;kg) but normally given in kg today.

* the ''zilindroa'' ([[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]), usually weighing 8, 9 or 10 ''arroba'' (100, 112.5 or 125&amp;nbsp;kg)
* the ''laukizuzena'' ([[rectangular]]), usually weighing between 10 and 17 ''arroba'' (125-212.5&amp;nbsp;kg)
* the ''kuboa'' ([[cube]]), usually weighing between 10 and 17 ''arroba'' (125-212.5&amp;nbsp;kg)
* the ''biribila'' (round), usually weighing 9 or 10 ''arroba'' (112.5 or 125&amp;nbsp;kg)

On occasion natural stones are also still used. This can be problematic for lifters of a smaller stature who may not be able to handle the larger, irregular shaped stones.

The rules are fairly simple, the stone has to be handled so it ends up on the competitors shoulder, at which point it can be dropped onto the pad in front of the ''harri-jasotzaile''. They never lift simultaneously but in sequence and facing each other, not side by side. There are two judges next to him, one to mark the time limit and another to ensure that the stone has been properly lifted. The crowd normally shouts out the number of times the stone has been lifted and the person who lifts the stone most often in the allocated time wins.

Alternatively, the competition may involving trying to lift a heavier stone that your opponents or to break a record.

The preferred material for the stones is the so-called ''harri beltza'' or black stone, a dark [[granite]] quarried near the towns of [[Zumarraga, Spain|Zumarraga]] and [[Lastur]] in [[Gipuzkoa]].

==Famous events==
Several lifting events are remembered widely:
* [[Mieltxo Saralegi]] for lifting the heaviest stone to date, weighing 329&amp;nbsp;kg.
* [[Iñaki Perurena]] who held the record before Saralegi for lifting a 322&amp;nbsp;kg stone, being a popular figure in the Basque [[Soap opera|soap]] ''[[Goenkale]]'' and a ''[[bertso]]lari''.

It is not uncommon for stone lifters to lift into considerably high age. In 1960 for example Justo Gallastegi lifted a 150&amp;nbsp;kg stone 5 times in 5 minutes in [[Tolosa, Spain|Tolosa]].

Memorable competitions or competitors often lead to the composition of ''[[bertso]]s''.

==History==
[[File:ArteondoLifting.jpg|thumb|right|Arteondo lifting a 15 ''arro'' stone in [[Deba, Guipúzcoa|Deba]] in 1924.]]
Although it is likely that this is an old sport, closely linked to rural farming activities, there are no documents of any significant age which mention this either as a sport or an activity. This has led to the wry saying that ''harri-jasotzea'' is "the oldest sport with the shortest history".

In the early days of ''harri-jasotzea'' every lifter was able to choose their own stone. This lasted well into the 20th century until Bittor Zabala, more commonly known as ''Arteondo'', whose own career as a stone lifter lasted from 1910 to 1945, initiated the process of standardising the shapes and weights of the stones. He was also instrumental in popularising the sport from an activity practised at the family farm into a sport practised in public.

==Women and harri-jasotzea==
[[Image:DamasaAgirregabiriaandErrekartetxo.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The female ''harri-jasotzaile'' Damasa Agirregabiria lifting an 8 ''arro'' stone on the left, Errekartetxo (Santos Iriarte) lifting a round stone on the right.]]
Although a male dominated sport, women have taken - and are taking - part in stone lifting competitions, as they have in other traditional Basque sports.

==Similar traditions==
Very similar sports or challenges like this occur in a number of cultures:
*the [[clach-ultaich|clachan-ultaich]] of the Scottish [[Gael]]
*the lifting of stones such as the [[Hálfdrættingur]] in [[Iceland]]
*the [[Bavaria]]n ''[[Stoalupfn]]''
*the [[Gŵyl Mabsant]] (Saint's Day) tradition of [[Y Garreg Orchest]] in [[Wales]]
*[[Dash kodirer|Dash kodirer (Даш кодурер)]] in [[Tuva]]
*[[Chikaraishi]] in Japan

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1613">'''Indecent assault''' is an offence of [[aggravated assault]] in some common law-based [[jurisdiction]]s. It is characterised as a [[sex crime]] and has significant overlap with offences referred to as [[sexual assault]].

==England and Wales==
Indecent assault was a broadly defined offence under sections 14 and 15 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 1956]]. It was superseded by the new offence of [[sexual assault#England and Wales|sexual assault]] under section 3 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]]. Other aspects of the [[actus reus]] were merged into other offences, including [[rape]] (section 1), whose scope was expanded. Individuals may still be prosecuted for indecent assault under the 1956 Act for offences committed before the new law came into force. 

The [[mens rea]] and actus reus of indecent assault were similar to that for [[Common assault|common law assault and/or battery]]. However, there was an additional element of "indecent circumstances". "Indecent circumstances" were present if a "reasonable person" would believe it indecent, whatever the belief of the accused.

==India==
In India it is punishable under section 354 of the [[Indian Penal Code]].

==Australia==

In [[New South Wales]], the offence of indecent assault is punishable under Section 61L of the [[Crimes Act 1900]].

The [[mens rea]] and [[actus reus]] are the same for the common law offence of assault, the only distinction being that the act committed must have a sexual connotation.

'''Israeli Sign Language''', or ISL, is the most commonly used [[sign language]] in the [[deaf]] [[community]] of [[Israel]]. Some other sign languages are also used in Israel, among them [[Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language]].

The history of ISL goes back to 1873 in [[Germany]], where [[Marcus Reich]], a [[History of the Jews in Germany|German Jew]], opened a special school for Jewish deaf children. At the time, it was considered one of the best of its kind, which made it popular with Jewish deaf children from all over the world as well as non-Jews. In 1932 several teachers from this school opened the first school for Jewish deaf children in [[Jerusalem]]. The sign language used in the Jerusalemite school was influenced by the [[German Sign Language]] (DGS), but other sign languages or signing systems brought by immigrants also contributed to the emerging language, which started out as a [[pidgin]]. A local [[creole language|creole]] gradually emerged, which became ISL.&lt;ref name=MSPA&gt;{{cite book|last1= Meir |first1= Irit |last2= Sandler |first2= Wendy |last3= Padden |first3= Carol |author-link3= Carol Padden |last4= Aronoff |first4= Mark |author-link4= Mark Aronoff |year= 2010 |chapter= Chapter 18: Emerging sign languages |chapter-url= http://sandlersignlab.haifa.ac.il/html/html_eng/pdf/EMERGING_SIGN_LANGUAGES.pdf |chapter-format=

ISL still shares many features and vocabulary items with DGS, although it is too far apart today to be considered a dialect of the latter.

During the 1940s ISL became the language of a well-established community of Jewish deaf people in [[Jerusalem]] and [[Tel Aviv]]. Today ISL is the most used and taught sign language in Israel, and serves as the main mode of communication for most deaf people in Israel, including Jewish, [[Arab citizens of Israel|Muslim and Christian Arabs]], [[Druze]], and [[Bedouin]]s. Some Arab, Druze, and Bedouin towns and villages have sign languages of their own.

In addition to ISL, there is also [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[manually coded language]] used as a tool to teaching deaf children the Hebrew language, and for communication between deaf and hearing people.

'''''It's Perfectly Normal: Changing Bodies, Growing Up, Sex, and Sexual Health''''' is a children's book about going through [[puberty]]. It is written by [[Robie Harris]] and illustrated by [[Michael Emberley]]. Harris was prompted to write it when an editor asked her to write a children's book about [[HIV/AIDS]], and she felt the subject needed to be treated more generally.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Julia A. Ames''' (October 14, 1861 - December 12, 1891) was an American journalist, editor and [[Temperance movement|temperance]] reformer.{{sfn|Tyrrell|2014|p=118}} She served as associate editor of the [[Woman's Temperance Publishing Association]]'s ''Union Signal''. Ames died in 1891 at the age of 30. The year after her death, the journalist and spiritualist [[W. T. Stead]] published [[automatic writing]] which was said to have been sent by Ames to her friend. Stead also created "Julie's Bureau" to allow others to communicate with the dead.

==Early years and education==
Julia A. (nickname, "Yolande") Ames was born near [[Odell, Illinois]], 14 October 1861. She was the daughter of Isaac Ames (1824-1894), a well-known, wealthy citizen of [[Streator, Illinois]], and Aurelia Ann Mooar Ames (1823-1898). Her siblings were John C Ames, Fannie Ophelia Ames, and Elmer Elsworth Ames.&lt;ref name="findagrave.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Julia A. "Yolande" Ames (1860 - 1891) - Find A Grave Memorial|url=https://findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=34364847|website=findagrave.com|accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In her childhood, she was always very small and delicate, but as she grew older, her health became vigorous. Ames began attending school at the age of three, as it was lonely for her to be left at home when the older children left. She attended every day that summer and learned to read. The schoolhouse was one of the first to be built in that part of the country. Her father helped to b construct it and taught the first school lesson ever, becoming the headmaster later in his life. The name of the Ames schoolhouse stayed with it and made it a sort of monument to the first schoolmaster, who was, like his youngest daughter, a devoted lover of learning. Ames' brother Elmer was two years younger than she, was always her companion and a playmate. As they grew up they lost none of their devotion to each other. Her elder and only sister accompanied Ames on Sunday mornings along with their grandfather to the little schoolhouse where religious services were held, in which they always participated. {{sfn|Willard|1892|p=5-}}

Like that, she grew until she was seven years old, when the family moved to Streator, Illinois. She was 12 years old, when she was converted, having attended six weeks of revival meeting in the old church in Streator. The Methodist Church is not particularly rigid, so that her breezy spirit lost none of its elasticity from being developed in a religious atmosphere so highly charged. 

She entered [[Streator Township High School]] in 1873, where she took a four year course, and soon distinguished herself by her fondness for English literature and history. She was an excellent reader. Her quaint humor and remarkable good-nature made her a fine entertainer at the public exhibitions, where the literary society frequently gave presentations. Beginning in September 1879, she attended [[Illinois Wesleyan University|Wesleyan University]], at [[Bloomington, Illinois]], studying literature, history, art and aesthetics, as well as some of the languages and natural sciences. She was a member of the Munsellian literary society, and Kappa Gamma Greek sorority. At Wesleyan, she met Professor [[Susan M. D. Fry]], an accomplished teacher, whom she always loved not only as an instructor, but as a most helpful and intimate friend.{{sfn|Willard|1892|p=5-}} She left Wesleyan in June, 1881. She later graduated from the Chicago School of Oratory (now [[Columbia College Chicago]]).{{sfn|Willard|1893|p=23}}

==Career==
For years, it was her thought that she would become a missionary, and when she decided to go into the temperance work one of her friends told her: "Julia, you have then relinquished the old idea of being a missionary?" whereupon she responded in her quick, bright way, "No, indeed, I am still thinking of it very strongly;" but she speedily found that temperance was really practical missionary work.{{sfn|Willard|1893|p=23}}

[[Helen Louise Hood]] first became acquainted with Ames in the summer of 1885 at the Lake Bluff (Illinois) Training School, but their real acquaintance did not begin until the  Women's Christian Temperance Union's(WCTU) National Convention which was held a few months later at [[Philadelphia]]. On their way to the Convention, Ames was made a delegate by the [[Illinois]] white-ribboners. On the way back home, they talked long and earnestly about her future, Hood urging Ames to come and cast in her lot with the "white-ribboners".  During this homeward ride, [[Matilda Carse]] was in the car reading a novel ''Yolande'', by William Black. Seeing a resemblance in the character of the heroine of this book to Ames, Carse called her, requested to kneel and touched her head, then she kissed her lovingly on the forehead and said: "Arise! I dub thee, Yolande" - a name by which she was known afterwards by all of her associates.{{sfn|Willard|1892|p=5-}}

On her return, Yolande became actively engaged in the work of the Chicago Central Union, one of the oldest and most influential unions in the city. She instituted the work which would be presented to the papers of that city and featured in weekly items of temperance news, which made her the Press Superintendent for ''The Union''. Later, she became very much interested in the Bethesda Mission, which was conducted by the Chicago Union, and situated on Clark Street, one of the worst streets of the city. Here every Sunday, Ames could be found teaching in the [[Sunday school]]. This mission, as well as the one for the homeless and friendless women, which the WCTU cared for, had an active worker in Ames. The mission for women was named by her "The Anchorage," and for a long time, she kept a white lily on the windows of its reading room, so that the outcast women who passed its windows might see this pure flower, and, being attracted, might come in and learn of a better life.{{sfn|Willard|1892|p=5-}}

In the spring of 1886, Ames' family moved from Chicago, her brother, Elmer, having finished law school, has gone west. As for Ames, she came to live at [[Frances Willard House (Evanston, Illinois)|Rest Cottage]].{{sfn|Willard|1892|p=5-}} The first of the [[Chicago]]'s daily published newspapers was a WCTU department's the ''[[Chicago Inter Ocean]]''. In her first interviews with the editors, Ames' work was often disregarded and not published, cut. At first, only a few inches of space were provided for her texts. This space however, was gradually increased as editors learned that she was trustworthy. However, she began to occupy nearly a column, and editors ceased to cut her manuscript, again. But soon, more important work got her attention. When the national superintendent of press-work, [[Esther Housh]], needed an assistant, Ames received the appointment.{{sfn|Willard|1893|p=23}} 

Her connection with the central union brought her into intimate contact with other women, among whom, in addition to Hood and Carse, were Elizabeth Wheeler Andrew, and [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]], these women and conversations with them moulded Ames' views. When Andrew felt that her health was deteriorating, she decided to give up her work on the ''Union Signal'', the question of her successor was earnestly discussed. The thoughts of the leaders at once turned to Ames, and despite her youth, she justified the choice of those who urged her to succeed Andrew. Up to 1889, her specialities were the news from the field and children's department. She founded the department of illustrated biography and the queen's garden. Her forte was not so much writing, though she was ready with her pen, as it was the ability to choose or reject others' writing, and the winning power to draw from them their best thoughts. In 1889, she had sole charge of the ''Union Signal'' in the absence of the editor.{{sfn|Willard|1893|p=23}} 
[[File:Julia Ames.jpg|thumb|Julia Ames (1890)]]
She visited Europe in 1890, being gone for months, and satisfied some of her longings for the beautiful, in the scenes she visited, the paintings and statues she saw. While in England, she became acquainted with [[Lady Henry Somerset]] at [[Eastnor Castle]], who afterwards became another strong factor in her life, giving her love and trust which lasted up until her death. In her letters, and on her return, Ames was full of praise for Lady Somerset — recognizing the fact that she was a great leader.{{sfn|Willard|1892|p=5-}} Ames was received with honour by the British Woman's Temperance Association. While in London, she organized the press department of that society on lines similar to those of the American organization. She travelled through Europe with a party accompanied by Sarah E. Morgan, under the auspices of Mrs. M. B. Willard's school for girls. She witnessed the [[Passion Play]] at [[Oberammergau]], visited [[Rome]] and other cities, and finally returned to the U.S. to resume her editorial duties at "Union Signal". She attended the [[Boston]] convention in November, 1891, in her editorial capacity. She assisted in editing of daily ''Union Signal'', prepared the [[Associated Press]] dispatches each night, and was the chairman of one or two committees. Ames was a member of the [[Woman's Temperance Publishing Association]], Circle of King's Daughters, and was president of that organization when she left Chicago for her European tour. The silver cross and the white ribbon were the symbols of her life. {{sfn|Willard|1893|p=23}}

==Death and ''Letters from Julia''==
Ames met [[William Thomas Stead]] in 1890. She was not well when she left Chicago, and she contracted a severe cold, which through the pressure of her work developed into [[typhoid]] [[pneumonia]], of which she died December 12, 1891, in Boston, and was buried at Riverview Cemetery, in Streator.&lt;ref name="findagrave.com" /&gt;{{sfn|Willard|1893|p=23}} In 1897, Stead published a collection of communications he states were received from Ames to her friend, Miss E., entitled ''Letters from Julie''.{{sfn|Stead|1913|p=177}} In 1909, he established "Julia's Bureau", an organization founded "to enable those who had lost their dead, who were sorrowing over friends and relatives, to get in touch with them again".{{sfn|Oppenheim|1988|p=34}}

In the preface to ''After Death, Or, Letters from Julia: A Personal Narrative'' (1910), Stead went on to say, 
{{quote|text=Eight years ago I collected together and published the series of messages contained in this volume under the title, "Letters from Julia, or Light from the Borderland, received by automatic writing from one who has gone before." Since then the little volume has been six times reprinted in England, and at least one translation has appeared abroad. I have received so many grateful letters from persons in all parts of the world, who, after sorrowing for their dead as those that have no hope, felt on reading this book as if their lost ones were in very truth restored to life, that I can no longer refuse to issue it to a wider public. I have not changed a word or syllable in the letters themselves. They stand exactly as they were printed in the original edition where they were reproduced from the automatic manuscript of the invisible author who used my passive hand as her amanuensis. I have also left unaltered the introduction explaining how these letters were written. But I have changed the title to one which is more challenging than "Letters from Julia," and which also indicates more explicitly the subject of the book.|author=W. T.

The '''Kashmiris''' ({{lang-ks|کٲشُر لُکھ / कॉशुर लुख}}) are an ethnic group native to the [[Kashmir Valley]], in the Indian state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], who speak [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], an Indo-Aryan [[Dardic language]].&lt;ref name="Munshi 2010"/&gt; The bulk of Kashmiri people predominantly live in the [[Kashmir Valley]]–which is the 'actual' Kashmir and does not include the other territories of the former [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|princely state of Jammu and Kashmir]] (i.e. [[Jammu Division|Jammu]], [[Gilgit-Baltistan]], [[Azad Kashmir]] and [[Ladakh]]).{{Efn-ua|{{harvtxt|Snedden, Understanding Kashmir and Kashmiris|2015|pp=20–21}} "...the 'real' Kashmir—that is, the Kashmir Valley...Historically, Kashmir equates to the Kashmir Valley."}} Other ethnic groups living in the [[Jammu and Kashmir]] state include [[Gujjars]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/ag/agp/AGPC/doc/Publicat/TAPAFON/TAP_10.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dogra]]s&lt;ref&gt;Minahan.J.B., (2012), Dogras, Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific: An Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pahari people|Paharis]], [[Balti people|Baltis]] and Ladakhis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jktourism.org/index.php/cultural/ethnic-groups |title=Department of Tourism, Jammu and Kashmir - Ethnic Groups |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=Jktourism.org |accessdate=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Kashmiris are native to the Kashmir Valley, smaller populations of Kashmiris also live in the remaining districts of [[Jammu and Kashmir]].

== Origins ==
Scholars have proposed various theories concerning the origins of Kashmiris. According to scholar Pandit Anand Koul, Kashmiris descend from Indo-Aryan people from Central Asia, and he sees their fair complexions as an indication of that.{{sfn|Bhat|2017|p=55}} Some believe they were immigrants from "India proper,"{{sfn|Bhat|2017|p=55}} c.q. "the more southern regions of India."{{sfn|West|2010|p=372}} Other scholars reject the Aryan origin theory of Kashmiris and believe them to belong to the race of Pishachas and Nagas.{{sfn|Bhat|2017|p=55}} The presence of Nagas in ancient Kashmir has been contested in historical scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Gulshan Majeed., “No Naga Presence in Ancient Kashmir The Past Never Is”, in Approaches to Kashmir Studies, eds G.M. Khawaja, Gulshan Majeed, 2011, Gulshan Books, Srinagar, pp 16-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars and Kashmiri historians, such as R.K. Parmu, believe that the Kashmiri people have a Jewish origin, due to several similarities between Kashmiris and Israelites. This theory holds that Kashmiris descend from one of the [[Lost Tribes of Israel]] which settled in Kashmir after the dispersal of the Jews, and were "forcibly converted to Islam prior to the 12th century."{{sfn|West|2010|p=372}}{{sfn|Bhat|2017|p=55}} According to Bhat, this theory has been refuted by most scholars.{{sfn|Bhat|2017|p=56}}

According to Dar, Kashmir being at crossroads of India, China, Afghanistan and central Asia, was settled by several waves of migrants. Central Asians and Brahmins from India pursuing studies who either mixed with or removed the earlier Nagas. Dar also includes the arrival of Sufis from Iran and Iraq among these migratory waves.{{sfn|Bhat|2017|p=54, 56}} Several historians have argued that the Kashmiris migrated directly from central Asia, citing similar customs, lifestyle and complexion as evidence for their stance.{{sfn|Bhat|2017|p=56}}

== History ==
===Hindu and Buddhist rule===
{{Main|Kashmiri Pandits}}
The Hindu [[caste system]] of the Kashmir region was influenced by the influx of Buddhism from the time of [[Asoka]], around the third century BCE, and a consequence of this was that the traditional lines of [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]] were blurred, with the exception of that for the Brahmins, who remained aloof from the changes.{{sfn|Bamzai, Ancient Kashmir|1994|pp=191–192}}{{sfn|Kaw, Kashmir and its People|2004|p=90}} Another notable feature of early Kashmiri society was the relative high regard in which women were held when compared to their position in other communities of the period.{{sfn|Kaw, Kashmir and its People|2004|p=91}}

A historically contested region, Northern India was subject to attack from [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and Arab regimes from the eighth century onwards, but they generally ignored the mountain-circled Kashmir Valley in favour of easier pickings elsewhere. It was not until the fourteenth century that Muslim rule was finally established in the Valley and when this happened it did not occur primarily as a consequence of invasion so much as because of internal problems resulting from the weak rule and corruption endemic in the Hindu [[Lohara dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Mark Aurel |last=Stein |authorlink=Mark Aurel Stein |title=Kalhana's Rajatarangini: a chronicle of the kings of Kashmir, Volume 1 |pages=106–108 |edition=Reprinted |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |year=1989 |origyear=1900 |isbn=978-81-208-0369-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-dfT2D8mnukC |accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hasanpp29-32&gt;{{citation |first=Mohibbul |last=Hasan |title=Kashmir Under the Sultans |location=Delhi |publisher=Aakar Books |edition=Reprinted |year=2005 |origyear=1959 |pages=29–32 |isbn=978-81-87879-49-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EUlwmXjE9DQC |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mohibbul Hasan describes this collapse as {{quote|The [[Damara (feudal landlord)|Dãmaras]] (feudal chiefs) grew powerful, defied royal authority, and by their constant revolts plunged the country into confusion. Life and property were not safe, agriculture declined, and there were periods when trade came to a standstill. Socially and morally too the court and the country had sunk to the depths of degradation.&lt;ref name=Hasanpp29-32/&gt;}}

The Brahmins had something to be particularly unhappy about during the reign of the last Lohara king, for Sūhadeva chose to include them in his system of onerous taxation, whereas previously they appear to have been exempted.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Mohibbul |last=Hasan |title=Kashmir Under the Sultans |location=Delhi |publisher=Aakar Books |edition=Reprinted |year=2005 |origyear=1959 |page=34 |isbn=978-81-87879-49-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EUlwmXjE9DQC |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arrival of Islam and Shah Mir Dynasty  (1320–1580s) ===

[[Islam]] arrived in Kashmir starting with the conversion in 1320 of Kashmir's Buddhist ruler, [[Rinchan]], at the hands of the saint, Sayyid Bilal Shah (also known as Bulbul Shah). After conversion to Islam he called himself Malik Sadur-ud-Din and became the first Muslim ruler of Kashmir. In 1339, [[Shah Mir]] established the [[Shah Mir dynasty]] in Kashmir. Islam grew in the 14th century under the Shah Mir dynasty and numerous Muslim [[ulama]] from Central Asia came to preach in Kashmir. Some of the famous [[ulama]] who propagated Islam in Kashmir included Sayyid Jalaluddin, Sayyid Tajuddin, Sayyid Ḥusayn Simani, Sayyid Ali Ḥamadani, Mir Muḥammad Hamadani, and Shaykh Nuruddin.{{Efn-ua |{{harvtxt|Amin &amp; Schofield, Kashmir|2009}}:  "Rinchan, a Buddhist ruler of Kashmir, embraced Islam in 1320 under the guidance of Sayyid Bilāl Shāh (also known as Bulbūl Shāh), a widely travelled Musavī sayyid from Turkistan. Islam consolidated its hold during Shāh Mir's reign (1339–1344). A large number of Muslim ʿulamāʿ came from Central Asia to Kashmir to preach; Sayyid Bilāl Shāh, Sayyid Jalāluddīn of Bukhara, Sayyid Tajuddīn, his brother Sayyid Ḥusayn Sīmānī, Sayyid ʿAlī Ḥamadānī, his son Mir Muḥammad Hamadānī, and Shaykh Nūruddīn are some of the well-known ʿulamāʿ who played a significant role in spreading Islam."}}
[[Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani|Sayyid Ali Hamadani]] (also known as Shah-yi Hamadan), alongside hundreds of his followers, converted thousands of Kashmiris to Islam and also imparted Persian influences on the local [[Culture of Kashmir|Kashmiri culture]].{{Sfn|Rafiabadi, Saints and Saviours|2005|p=259}} His son, Sayyid Muḥammad Hamadani, encouraged Kashmir's Muslim ruler [[Sikandar Butshikan]] (who reigned from 1389–1413) to enforce [[Islamic Law|Islamic law]] and establish the office of ''Shaykh al-Islam'' i.e. the chief religious authority. By the late 1400s the majority of the population had embraced Islam.{{Efn-ua |{{harvtxt|Amin &amp; Schofield, Kashmir|2009}}: "The contribution of Sayyid ʿAlī Hamadānī, popularly known as Shah-yi Hamadān, is legendary. Born at Hamadān (Iran) in 1314 and belonging to the Kubrawīyah order of Ṣūfīs, a branch of the Suhrawardīyah, he paid three visits to Kashmir in 1372, 1379, and 1383; together with several hundred followers, he converted thousands of Kashmiris to Islam. His son Sayyid Muḥammad Hamadānī continued his work, vigorously propagating Islam as well as influencing the Muslim ruler Sikander (1389–1413) to enforce Islamic law and to establish the office of the Shaykh al-Islām (chief religious authority). By the end of the fifteenth century, the majority of the people had embraced Islam."}} During the rule of Sultan Sikandar Butshikan (1389–1413), who has been referred as an [[iconoclast]], there were mass migrations of [[Kashmiri Pandit]]s to other parts of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Mīr ʻAbdulʻazīz |title=Freedom Struggle in Kashmir |publisher=Research Society of Pakistan |year=2000 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dS9uAAAAMAAJ |quote=There is no doubt that many Kashmiri pandits migrated to the plains during the rule of Sikandar the iconoclast|isbn=9789694250908 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Rai, Hindu Rulers, Muslim Subjects|2004|p=286}}

==== Chak Rule ====
In 1540, the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] governor of [[Kashgar]] and a cousin of Emperor [[Babur]] by the name of [[Mirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlat]] conquered Kashmir. He ruled until 1551, when he was killed in an outbreak of revolt by Chaks, who became the main force by this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Dames |first=M.

Some disenchanted Sunnis, such as notable Sunni scholar, Sheikh Yaqub Sarfi, went to the court of [[Akbar]] and invited the Mughals to conquer Kashmir and overthrow Chak rule on certain conditions. These conditions included a guarantee of Kashmiri rights such as freedom of religion for all of Kashmir's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.242526/2015.242526.The-Wounded#page/n77/mode/2up |title=The Wounded Paradise |author=Altaf Hussain |publisher=s.p. |year=1991 |pages=58–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaikh Yaqub Sarfi also forbade Sunnis from carrying out any reprisal against Shias and he devoted his life to restoring peace and communal harmony between the Sunnis and Shias of Kashmir.

=== Mughal rule (1580s–1750s) ===
Kashmiri historians see [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rule as the beginning of the end of Kashmiri independence.{{Sfn|Zutshi, Languages of Belonging|2004|p=35}} The Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]] succeeded in invading the [[Kashmir Valley]], despite tough Kashmiri resistance,{{efn-ua|{{harvtxt|Snedden, Understanding Kashmir and Kashmiris|2015|p=32}}: "Kashmiris united and fought the intruder. Tough and capable fighters defended the entrances to the Kashmir Valley..."}} due to internal [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]]–[[Shia]] divisions amongst Kashmiris.{{sfn|Snedden, Understanding Kashmir and Kashmiris|2015|p=29}}

The anti-Shia policies of Mirza Haidar Dughlat and the anti-Sunni policies of the Chaks had broken Kashmiri unity, thus paving the way for the Mughal occupation of Kashmir.{{Sfn|Chen &amp; Shih, Borderland Politics in Northern India|2016|p=43}} [[Akbar]]'s victory brought an end to indigenous Kashmiri Muslim rule.{{Efn-ua|{{citation |last=Puri |first=Balraj |authorlink=Balraj Puri |title=5000 Years of Kashmir |newspaper=Epilogue |volume=3 |number=6 |date=June 2009 |pp=43–45 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5EWo7eszcbgC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq|access-date=31 December 2016}}: "It was emperor Akbar who brought an end to indigenous Kashmiri Muslim rule that had lasted 250 years. The watershed in Kashmiri history is not the beginning of the Muslim rule as is regarded in the rest of the subcontinent but the changeover from Kashmiri rule to a non-Kashmiri rule."}} [[Christopher Snedden]] states that the [[Mughals]] began a process of psychological warfare against Kashmiris to strip them of their martial capabilities. After this, neighbouring ethnic groups started stereotyping Kashmiris as a 'cowardly' and 'non-martial' race.{{sfn|Snedden, Understanding Kashmir and Kashmiris|2015|p=33}}

Conversely, Akbar also reduced the land revenue demand from two-thirds, as it was earlier, to one-half of the produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hangloo |first=Ratan Lal |title=The Magnitude of Land Revenue Demand in Kashmir-1846 to 1900 A.D |journal=Social Scientist |volume=12 |number=6 |date=June 1984 |pp=52–59 |jstor=3517003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kashmiri Hindus also felt a respite from the severe persecution they faced under the earlier Kashmiri Muslim rule.{{Sfn|Kaw, Kashmir and its People|2004|p=115}}

The Mughals maintained a large military presence in the valley and were not interested in developing the productive sectors although they patronised art and constructed some pleasure gardens and a few mosques. While many histories of Kashmir consider the Kashmir Valley's incorporation into Mughal India as a decline of Kashmiri independence and cultural identity, Chitralekha Zutshi argues that Kashmiri poets began to consciously articulate their sense of regional belonging during the Mughal rule. According to M.J. Akbar, the clash of cultures between Delhi and Kashmir resulted in Kashmiris wishing for nothing more than to be left alone.{{efn-ua|{{harvtxt|Chen &amp; Shih, Borderland Politics in Northern India|2016|p=43}}: "According to M. J. Akbar, the first clash of cultures between Delhi and Kashmir only resulted in the former sneering at the latter and the Kashmiri wishing nothing more than to be left alone...It is significant to note that except for constructing some pleasure gardens for their own personal purposes and constructing a few mosques and a military cantonment by the name of Naagar Nagar and patronising a few artists and poets of repute, the Mughals did not show any interest in developing the productive sectors. While, on the one hand, almost all the works on the history of Kashmir consistently portray the incorporation of the Kashmir valley into the Mughal India after Chak rule as the beginning of the end of Kashmiri independence and decline of Kashmiri cultural identity, Chitralekha Zutshi, on the other hand, argues that it was precisely in the Mughal period that Kashmiri poets first began to self consciously articulate a sense of regional belongings."}}

=== Afghan Rule (1750s–1819) ===
In 1751, the [[Afghans]], ruled by [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]], absorbed Kashmir into the [[Durrani Empire]]. The [[Afghans]] were cruel, especially to Kashmir's Hindus. However, Kashmiri historians state that the [[Afghans]] were brutally repressive to all Kashmiris, regardless of religion.{{efn-ua|{{harvtxt|Zutshi, Languages of Belonging|2004|p=35}}: "Most historians of Kashmir agree on the rapacity of the Afghan governors, a period unrelieved by even brief respite devoted to good work and welfare for the people of Kashmir.

The [[Afghans]] sent many Kashmiris as slaves to [[Afghanistan]]. During Afghan dominance, the shawl industry declined, probably due to heavy taxes.

[[Kashmiri Pandits]] were not prevented from entering into government service. George Foster, who visited Kashmir during the Afghan rule, documented the oppression of Kashmiris by Afghans. He writes:{{Sfn|Chen|Shih|2015|p=43}}&lt;blockquote&gt;The Afghans would never issue an order without a blow of the side of hatchet (battle axe). Karim Dad Khan in a mood of enjoyment would tie up the inhabitants by back in pairs and drop them in the river.&lt;/blockquote&gt;By 1819 the [[Sikh Empire]]'s [[Ranjit Singh|Maharajah Ranjit Singh]] finally succeeded in taking [[Kashmir Valley|Kashmir]].

=== Sikh Empire (1820–1846) ===
In 1819 Kashmir came under [[Maharajah Ranjit Singh (Punjab)|Maharajah Ranjit Singh]]'s Sikh Empire and [[Sikh Empire|Sikh rule]] over Kashmir lasted for 27 years till 1846. These 27 years of Sikh rule saw 10 Governors in Kashmir.

During the Sikh rule the mostly illiterate Muslim population suffered under heavy taxation, rural indebtedness and discrimination.{{efn-ua|{{harvtxt|Amin &amp; Schofield, Kashmir|2009}}: "During both Sikh and Dogra rule, heavy taxation, forced work without wages (begār), discriminatory laws, and rural indebtedness were widespread among the largely illiterate Muslim population."}} The Sikhs had enacted a number of anti-Muslim policies, thus subjecting the Muslim majority population of the Valley to a number of hardships in the practice of their religion. The central mosque, [[Jama Masjid, Srinagar|Jama Masjid]], was closed for 20 years and Muslims were prohibited from issuing the ''azan'' (call to prayer). If a Sikh murdered a Hindu the compensation amount allowed was four rupees. However, if a Sikh murdered a Muslim the compensation amount allowed was only two rupees. According to Prem Nath Bazaz the effect of the Sikh rule was that the people of the valley came to be known as 'zulum parast' (worshippers of tyranny), forgot their glorious martial traditions and became timid and cowardly.{{efn-ua|{{harvtxt|Fahim, Centuries' Subjugation Kicks off a Bitter Struggle|2011|p=259}}: "Sikh army entered Kashmir on 4th July, 1819, starting a new phase of tyranny and oppression...Describing the Sikh rule, Moorcraft, an English traveller reflected, 'Sikhs looked at Kashmiris 'a little better than the cattle. The murder of a native Sikh was punished with a fine to the government ranging from 16 to 20 rupees, of which four were paid to the family of the deceased if a Hindu, and two if he was a Mohammedan;. During this dark phase in Kashmir's history, people were in a most abject condition 'subjected to every kind of extortion and oppression'. Under Sikh rule Kashmir was ruled by 10 governors. Out of these, five were Hindus, three Sikhs, and two Muslims. Sikhs consistently followed anti-Muslim policies in Kashmir, subjecting the majority population of the Kashmir valley to severe hardship in relation to the practice of religion. It was also during this phase that the central mosque of Srinagar, the Jama Masjid was ordered to be closed and Muslims of Kashmir were not allowed to say azan (call to prayer). Sikhs tried to establish a 'Hindu' state where cow slaughter was declared a crime and a complete ban was passed against cow slaughter, lands attached to several shrines were also resumed on state orders...The effect of the Sikh rule, according to Prem Nath Bazaz, dealt a severe blow to the pride of the local people. 'The people of the valley came to be known as zulum parast (the worshippers of tyranny) as they gradually forgot their glorious martial traditions and became timid and cowardly.' With the battle of Subraon, the Sikhs lost their independence. The treaty of Amritsar between British and Dogras signed on 16th of March 1846, gave way to Dogra rule in Kashmir."}}

During the Sikh rule, Europeans who visited the Valley documented the deprivation and starvation and also wrote of the abject poverty of the peasantry and the exorbitant taxes under the Sikhs. According to European traveller Moorcraft, no more than one-sixteenth of the cultivable land surface was under cultivation and due to starvation many people had fled to India.{{efn-ua|{{harvtxt|Schofield, Kashmir in Conflict|2010|p=118}}: "The picture painted by the Europeans who began to visit the valley more frequently was one of deprivation and starvation...Everywhere the people were in the most abject condition, exorbitantly taxed by the Sikh Government and subjected to every kind of extortion and oppression by its officers...Moorcroft estimated that no more than one-sixteenth of the cultivable land surface was under cultivation; as a result, the starving people had fled in great numbers to India."}} Kashmiri histories also emphasise the wretchedness of life for common Kashmiris during the Sikh rule.

==== 1833 Famine ====
The 1833 famine caused many people to leave the [[Kashmir Valley]] and migrate to the [[Punjab (region)|Punjab]], with the majority of weavers leaving Kashmir.

The great famine conditions and starvation three years earlier, have forced a considerable number of people to move out of the valley and the greater security of their possessions and property in Punjab has also facilitated this outward migration...The distress and misery experienced by the population during the years 1833 and 1834, must not be forgotten by the current generation living there."}} Due to the famine, the Punjabi city of [[Amritsar]] witnessed a large influx of Kashmiris.{{Efn-ua|{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FkBuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q= |title=Punjab revisited: an anthology of 70 research documents on the history and culture of undivided Punjab |last= |first= |publisher=Gautam Publishers |year=1995 |page=576}}: "Owing to a large influx of Kashmiris into Amritsar during the great famine which occurred in Kashmir in the year 1833 A.D., the number of shops increased in Amritsar to 2,000 and the yearly out-turn of pashmina work to four lacs of rupees."}}{{efn-ua|{{harvtxt|Watt|2014|p=648}}: "In the year 1833 A.D. owing to a great famine in Kashmir, there was a large influx of Kashmiris into Amritsar."}} Thousands of people died during the famine of 1833 and both the famine and emigration reduced the population to one-fourth by 1836.

=== Dogra Regime (1846–1947) ===

They had been taught for many years that they were serfs without any rights....Pages might be written by me on facts which have come under my personal observation, but it will suffice to say that the system of administration had degraded the people and taken all heart out of them.'' Lawrence...was careful to absolve the ruler of personal culpability: ''the peasants, one and all, attributed their miseries to the deputies through which the Maharajas ruled, and they have always recognised that their rulers were sympathetic and anxious to ensure their prosperity. But the officials of Kashmir would never allow their master to know the real condition of the people.'' Who were these venal officials? Lawrence was particularly critical of princely state officials belonging to the Kashmiri Pandit community..."}} [[Walter Roper Lawrence|Walter Lawrence]] described the conditions of the [[Kashmir Valley|Valley's]] peasantry as being 'desperate' and noted that the [[Kashmir Valley|Valley's]] peasantry attributed their miseries to the Maharajah's deputies rather than the rulers themselves.

==== 1878 Famine ====
There was a famine in Kashmir between 1877-9 and the death toll from this famine was overwhelming by any standards.

=== Religious traditions ===
[[File:Kashmiri girls from northern Kashmir Valley..jpg|right|thumb|261x261px|Ethnic Kashmiri women from [[Neelam District|North Kashmir]].]]

The [[Kashmir Valley]] has a 700-year-old tradition of [[Sufism]]. The [[Kashmir Valley]] is known as the ‘''Pir Waer''’, meaning the ‘''Alcove of Sufis and Saints''’''.''&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1029975|title=Kashmir: The Alcove of Sufis and Saints|date=2013-07-18|newspaper=DAWN.COM|access-date=2017-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sufism was introduced to Kashmir almost simultaneously with the foundation of Muslim rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xeK9w9P0sBQC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq |title=World Religions and Islam: A Critical Study, Part 2 |last=Rafiabadi |first=Hamid Naseem |publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons |year=2003 |isbn=9788176254144 |location= |page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kashmiris take pride in inhabiting a cultural space between Sufi Islam and Vedic Hinduism. Both the [[Kashmiri Pandit|Pandits]] and Muslims of Kashmir respect the [[Shaivism|Shaivite]] mystic [[Lala Ded]], who symbolises Kashmir's syncretic culture{{Efn-ua |{{citation |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t355/e0016?_hi=3&amp;_pos=47 |title=Kashmir |last=Khan |first=Nyla Ali |work=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Women |publisher=Oxford University Press}}: "Kashmiris have long taken pride in inhabiting a cultural space between Vedic Hinduism and Ṣūfī Islam. Lalla-Ded (fourteenth century), revered by both the Pandits and Muslims of Kashmir, is the finest symbol of their essentially syncretic culture."}} and both [[Kashmiri Muslims]] and [[Kashmiri Pandit|Kashmiri Hindus]] also hold the shrine of [[Dastgeer Sahib]] in high esteem. People in Kashmir pay regular visits to the shrines of [[Sufi saints]] for peace of mind. It has also been a centuries-old tradition in [[Kashmir Valley|Kashmir]] for [[Sufism|Sufi]] disciples to recite special 'Wazaif'.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

In contrast, the introduction of [[Salafism]] to Kashmir only goes back to a hundred years. [[Salafi movement|Salafis]] remained on the fringes of Kashmir's religious and cultural life since belief in the local traditions of [[Sufism|Sufi Islam]] was very strong in the [[Kashmir Valley|Valley]]. But this has begun to change since the insurgency in Kashmir since the late 1980s. Pakistani-trained jihadi groups hijacked the local sentiment for freedom and transformed the Kashmiri struggle into a continuation of their holy war for an Islamic caliphate, by playing on the fears of the people that Kashmir's Muslim identity was under threat of erasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pulitzercenter.org/projects/kashmir-sufi-resurgence-salafi-islam-belief-conflict-rising-salafism-muslim-islam |title=Kashmir: From Sufi to Salafi |last=Mir |first=Tariq |date=5 November 2012 |website=Pulitzer Center |publisher= |access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there has also been a proliferation in the number of [[Barelvi]] groups, claiming to be custodians of the [[Kashmir Valley|Valley]]'s [[Sufism|Sufi]] moorings, which have sprung up to challenge the growing power of the [[Wahhabism|Wahhabi]] faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://archive.tehelka.com/story_main52.asp?filename=Ne310312Fight.asp |title=The Fight for Kashmir’s Soul |last=Wani |first=Riyaz |date=31 March 2012 |work=Tehelka Magazine |access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Salafi movement|Salafis]] say that those who frequent shrines indulge in 'grave worship' (which is forbidden in Islam). But [[Sufism|Sufis]] state that it is incorrect to assume that shrine-goers indulge in grave worship. They say they visit shrines only to seek the blessings of Allah as these places are said to be sacred as great scholars are buried there.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

=== Arts and crafts ===
[[File:Ethnic Kashmiri children in traditional pheran.jpg|thumb|320x320px|Kashmiri children in traditional [[Phiran|Pheran]].]]

The missionary saint Shah Hamadan brought [[Pashm]] wool to Kashmir from Ladakh and started various pashmina works. Since then pashmina has been used in several textiles in Kashmir and the Valley became a stronghold of pashmina. According to Moti Lal Saqi the shawl industry in Kashmir was made prominent by Mir Syed Ali Hamadani who was accompanied by both religious scholars and expert craftsmen and artists from Central Asia. Hamadani encouraged the practice of shawl weaving and cultural relations were thus established between Kashmir and Central Asia. There is a consensus among researchers that Shah Hamadan's arrival heralded the great advancement in the arts and crafts of Kashmir since 713 people of various professions had entered the Valley, accompanying Shah Hamadan. At the time it is said there were about twelve thousand idol-makers in the valley who had been rendered jobless since Islam does not approve idol-carving. Syed Ali Hamadani assisted them to find earnings by encouraging them to take to stone-carving and other arts and crafts practised by his associates who had accompanied him to Kashmir.{{Sfn|Rafiabadi, Saints and Saviours|2005|p=259-260}}

Fair skin and prominent noses are the hallmarks of Kashmiris.{{Sfn|Kaw, Kashmiri Pandits|2001|p=32}}&lt;ref name="Singh19952"&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7FpuAAAAMAAJ |title=Kashmir: a tragedy of errors |publisher=Viking |year=1995 |author=Tavleen Singh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kashmiris have been considered a good-looking race and British memoirs have commented positively on their physique and beauty.{{Sfn|Kwarteng|2011|p=114}} According to the 17th century French traveller, [[Francois Bernier]], the Kashmiris were celebrated for beauty and considered 'well-made' like the Europeans. He records that the Mughals would select wives and concubines from Kashmir so that their children could be whiter than Indians and pass for genuine Mughals.{{Efn-ua| :{{Sfn|Drace-Francis|2013|p=57}} "The people of Kashmir, says Bernier, are celebrated for beauty; they are as well-made as the Europeans...The women are particularly handsome; and it is very common for strangers on their first appearance at the court of Mogul to provide themselves with wives from Kashmir, in order to have children that may be more fair than the Indians, and that may pass for true Moguls."}}{{efn-ua|{{harvtxt|Bakshi, Kashmir Through Ages, Volume 2|1997|p=238}}: "While paying his compliments to their physical beauty, Bernier writes: 'Nearly every individual when first admitted to the court of the Great Mogul selects wives and concubines (from Kashmir) so that his children may be whiter than the Indians and pass for genuine Moguls.'"}} [[Marco Polo]] observed that the beauty of Kashmiri women was superb.{{Sfn|Bakshi, Kashmir Through Ages, Volume 2|1997|p=102}} According to Alex Drace-Francis the resemblance between the natives of Kashmir and those of France and Circassia is 'striking'.{{Sfn|Drace-Francis|2013|p=57}} Bhandari remarks that one is usually struck by the marked ethnic differences between Kashmiris from other races in India and Pakistan.{{efn-ua|{{harvtxt|Bhandari|2006|p=107}}: "One is usually struck by the marked ethnic differences of the Kashmiris from other Indian and Pakistani races. Fair skin and prominent noses suggest a Semitic origin. Historians write that there are no actual records based on facts, only speculations. The most interesting speculation is that the Kashmiris are descendants of one of the lost tribes of Israel."}}

In 2011 a survey by Gilani Research Foundation/Gallup Pakistan found that 55 percent of Pakistanis considered Kashmiris and Pashtuns to be the best looking people in the country. 29 percent rated Kashmiris as the best looking people while 26 percent rated Pashtuns as the best looking people.{{Efn-ua|{{Cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/136695/55-pakistanis-believe-kashmiris-pathans-best-looking/|title=55% Pakistanis believe Pathans, Kashmiris best looking|last=Ali|first=Zunair|date=23 March 2011|work=Express Tribune|access-date=29 December 2016}}: "A total of 55% of Pakistanis believe Kashmiris and Pathans have the best looks in the country, according to a recently released survey by Gilani Research Foundation/Gallup Pakistan.

In the early twentieth century, the policies of the Dogra rulers drove many [[Kashmiri Muslims]] to flee their native land to [[Punjab (region)|Punjab]].{{Sfn|Sevea, The Political Philosophy of Muhammad Iqbal|2012|p=16}} Earlier, Afghan brutality and the oppression and poverty during the Sikh rule had also caused Kashmiri migrations to the Punjab.{{Sfn|Zutshi, Languages of Belonging|2004|p=40}}{{Sfn|Zutshi, Languages of Belonging|2004|p=84}} [[Kashmiri Muslims]] came to constitute an important segment of several Punjabi cities such as [[Sialkot]], [[Lahore]], [[Amritsar]] and [[Ludhiana]].{{efn-ua|{{harvtxt|Sevea, The Political Philosophy of Muhammad Iqbal|2012|p=16}}: "In the early twentieth century, famine and the policies of the Dogra rulers drove many Kashmiri Muslims to flee their native land and further augment the number of their brethren already resident in the Punjab. Kashmiri Muslims constituted an important segment of the populace in a number of Punjabi cities, especially Sialkot, Lahore, Amritsar and Ludhiana."}} Kashmiri Muslim immigrants from the Valley were a fifth of Amritsar's Muslim population in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20060126/aplus.htm#1|title=From the Land of Paradise to the Holy City|last=|first=|date=|website=The Tribune|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the integration of the Valley and British India, increasing numbers of Muslims had begun travelling to the Punjab. It is noted in the Census of 1921 that, 'the Kashmiri not only contributes to the growth of population in the state, but he adds considerably to the population of all important towns in the Punjab, which are situated along the State border or the main railway line.'{{Sfn|Zutshi, Languages of Belonging|2004|p=157}} Notable Kashmiri leader [[Sheikh Abdullah]] said of Kashmiris in Punjab;&lt;ref name="Abdullah1985"&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nYszygAACAAJ |title=Atish-e-Chinar |author=Shaikh Mohammad Abdullah |publisher=Ali Mohammad and Sons |year=1985 |pages=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;My stay at Lahore, for other reasons, awakened me from the slumber and made me familiar with new spirits. I saw Kashmiri Muslims in big bands leaving their beautiful land for the hard plains of Punjab in search of livelihood. These labourers had to cross on foot the snowy mountains of Mari and Banihall and had to face thousands of odds in their way. Sometimes, while crossing the mountains, these people were perishing as a result of difficult passes, snowstorms, etc. these unfortunate people were dying unwept and unsung. It was not easy once reaching the plains; there they had to face numerous odds and worries. During the day they wandered through the streets in search of work. Some worked as wood cutters, some as helpers to the shopkeepers, some carried heavy loads on their backs while some of them did grinding. After doing hard work during the day, they earned very little money of which maximum was spent on their meals. They passed their nights either in any inn or mosque, where they were harassed like dumb driven cattle.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scholar [[Ayesha Jalal]] states that Kashmiris faced discrimination in the Punjab as well.{{Sfn|Jalal, Self and Sovereignty|2002|p=352}} Kashmiris settled for generations in the [[Punjab (region)|Punjab]] were disqualified from taking advantage of the Punjab Land Alienation Act,{{efn-ua|{{harvtxt|Jalal, Self and Sovereignty|2002|p=352}}: "...Kashmiris engaged in agriculture were disqualified from taking advantage of the Punjab Land Alienation Act...Yet Kashmiris settled in the Punjab for centuries faced discrimination."}} and most Kashmiri families in Punjab did not own land.{{efn-ua|{{harvtxt|Sevea, The Political Philosophy of Muhammad Iqbal|2012|p=16}}: "Like most Kashmiri families in Punjab, Iqbal's family did not own land."}} Historian Zutshi states that Kashmiri Muslims settled in the Punjab retained emotional and familial links to Kashmir and felt obliged to struggle for the freedom of their brethren in the [[Kashmir Valley|Valley]].{{efn-ua|{{harvtxt|Zutshi, Languages of Belonging|2004|pp=191–192}}: "Kashmiri Muslim expatriates in the Punjab had retained emotional and familial ties to their soil and felt compelled to raise the banner of freedom for Kashmir and their brethren in the Valley, thus launching bitter critiques of the Dogra administration."}}

Notable members of the [[Kashmiri Muslim]] diaspora in Punjab include Pakistan's current Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] (paternal and maternal ancestries from Anantnag and Pulwama respectively), Finance Minister [[Ishaq Dar]] and politicians Sheikh [[Sheikh Rasheed Ahmad|Rasheed]] &amp;  [[Khawaja Muhammad Asif|Khawaja Asif]].{{Efn-ua|{{Cite news |url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/as-nawaz-sharif-becomes-pm-kashmir-gets-voice-in-pakistan-power-circuit/1125778/ |title=As Nawaz Sharif becomes PM, Kashmir gets voice in Pakistan power circuit |last=Jaleel |first=Muzamil |date=2013 |work=The Indian Express |access-date=29 December 2016}}: "Kashmir may have been missing from the agenda of the elections in Pakistan, but the country's new government will have Kashmiris in vital positions — beginning with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif himself. Sharif, 63, who was sworn in for a historic third term on Wednesday, belongs to a family that migrated to Amritsar from South Kashmir's Anantnag district in the beginning of the last century. Sharif's close confidant Ishaq Dar, and influential PML (N) leader Khawaja Asif — both of whom are likely to get important positions in the new government — too have roots in Kashmir. 'My father would always tell me that we are from Anantnag. We had migrated to Amritsar from there for business', Sharif told this correspondent in his office in Lahore's Model Town last month where he sat with his key associates tracking the results of the election. 'And my mother's family came from Pulwama'."}} Other famous members of the [[Kashmiri Muslim]] diaspora in [[Punjab (region)|Punjab]] included [[Muhammad Iqbal]] (who was attached to his Brahmin ancestry{{efn-ua|{{harvtxt|Sevea, The Political Philosophy of Muhammad Iqbal|2012|p=16}}: "Iqbal's attachment to his Kashmiri lineage is evident from his poetic references to himself as a descendant of Kashmiri Brahmins."}} and whose poetry displayed a keen sense of belonging to the [[Kashmir Valley]]){{efn-ua|{{harvtxt|Jalal, Self and Sovereignty|2002|p=352}}: "As one of the most highly educated Kashmiris in the Punjab, Muhammad Iqbal supported the Kashmiri cause through the Anjuman-i-Himayat-i-Islam and the lesser known Anjuman-i-Kashmiri Musalman.

It's from this baseline that demographers have sought to work out the number of Kashmir Pandits in the valley in 1990. Using the rough measure of the average decennial growth rate in the state as a whole, available through the censuses up to 1941 and then the 2001 census, the number of Kashmiri Pandits living in the valley before 1990 that they arrive at is about 160,000 to 170,000. So the number of 700,000 as representing the number of Kashmiri Pandit departures after 1989-1990 is not credible because that exceeds by many hundreds of thousands the total of the Kashmiri Pandit population at the time."}} [[Kashmiri Pandit]]s have also fled to India and to other parts of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] since 1989. A number of Kashmiri organisations have been existence for over half a century in Delhi, including Kashmiri Pandit Sabha, Panun Kashmir, Vyeth Television, and N. S. Kashmir Research Institute.{{citation needed |date=March 2017}} Notable members of the [[Kashmiri Pandit]] diaspora in India include former Indian Prime Ministers [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Indira Gandhi]].

'''Kurds in Kazakhstan''' refers to the people born in or residing in Kazakhstan who are of Kurdish origin. According to the most recent Kazakh census in 2011, the Kurdish population is 38,325 or 0.2% of the population,&lt;ref name="kazakhstan"/&gt; but Vice President of the Kurdish Association of Kazakhstan, Malikshah Gasanov numbers the population up to 46,000,&lt;ref name="paradise"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kazakhstan: A paradise for ethnic minorities|url=http://www.kurdmedia.com/article.aspx?id=7861|publisher=Kurdish Media|accessdate=2 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325002104/http://www.kurdmedia.com/article.aspx?id=7861|archivedate=25 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; because many Kurds list themselves as [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Azeris]].&lt;ref name="historicaldictionary"/&gt;
During Soviet rule, most of the Kurdish population in [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakhstan]] were deported by [[Joseph Stalin]] from [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijan]] and [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgia]]. Years later, Kurds immigrated to Kazakhstan from the neighbouring countries, [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]].&lt;ref name="paradise"/&gt;

In cities with a substantial Kurdish population, [[Kurdish literature]] and Kurdish language is taught in the primary and secondary schools. In the village of Kashkabulak, Kurdish students can study Kurdish through 12th grade.&lt;ref name="paradise"/&gt; And since 1990, Kurds also have had their own newspaper, the ''Kurdistan'' newspaper.&lt;ref name="paradise"/&gt;

==Deportation and immigration==
Kurds were deported twice to Central Asia from [[Caucasus|Caucasia]]. The first deportation occurred in 1937 where Stalin deported Kurds from [[Nakhichivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]] and the second deportation occurred in 1944 in Georgia. Stalin feared a Turkish invasion and he saw Kurds as unreliable, even though many Kurds served in the Soviet military. Many of them died during the deportations.&lt;ref name="historicaldictionary"/&gt;

After the [[Osh riots (1990)|Osh riots]] and the riots in [[Fergana Valley]] between [[Kyrgyzs]] and [[Uzbeks]], many Kurds moved to Kazakhstan.&lt;ref name="historicaldictionary"/&gt;

'''Latgalian''' is spoken in [[Latgale]], the eastern part of [[Latvia]]. It is debated whether it is a separate language or a distinct [[dialect]] of [[Latvian language|Latvian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politika.lv/article/recenzija-par-petijumu-valodas-loma-regiona-attistiba|title=Recenzija par pētījumu "Valodas loma reģiona attīstībā"|last=Druviete|first=Ina|date=22 July 2001|publisher=Politika.lv|language=Latvian|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, its [[standard language|standardized]] form is recognized and protected as a "historical variety of the [[Latvian language]]" ''(vēsturisks latviešu valodas paveids)'' by Latvian law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://likumi.lv/doc.php?id=14740|title=Valsts valodas likums|language=Latvian|accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 Latvian census established that 8.8% of Latvia's inhabitants, or 164,500 people, speak Latgalian daily. 97,600 of them live in Latgale, 29,400 in [[Riga]] and 14,400 in the Riga region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsm.lv/lv/raksts/latvija/zinas/tautas-skaitiishana-latgale-tresha-dalja-iedziivotaju-ikdiena-li.a6091/ Tautas skaitīšana: Latgalē trešā daļa iedzīvotāju ikdienā lieto latgaliešu valodu]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:Baltic Tribes c 1200.svg|thumb|Distribution of the Baltic tribes, circa AD 1200 (boundaries are approximate).]]
Originally [[Latgalians]] were a tribe living in modern [[Vidzeme]] and [[Latgale]]. It is thought that they spoke the [[Latvian language]], which later spread through the rest of modern [[Latvia]], absorbing features of the [[Curonian language|Old Curonian]], [[Semigallian language|Semigallian]], [[Selonian language|Selonian]] and [[Livonian language|Livonian]] languages. The Latgale area became politically separated during the [[Polish–Swedish wars]], remaining part of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] as the [[Inflanty Voivodeship]], while the rest of Latvians lived in lands dominated by [[Baltic German]] nobility. Both centuries of separate development and the influence of different [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige languages]] likely contributed to the development of modern Latgalian as distinct from the language spoken in [[Vidzeme]] and other parts of Latvia.

The modern Latgalian literary tradition started to develop in the 18th century from vernaculars spoken by Latvians in the eastern part of [[Latvia]]. The first surviving book published in Latgalian is "Evangelia toto anno" (''Gospels for the whole year'') in 1753. The first systems of orthography were borrowed from [[Polish language|Polish]] and used [[Antiqua (typeface class)|Antiqua]] letters. It was very different from the German-influenced orthography, usually written in [[Blackletter]] or Gothic script, used for the [[Latvian language]] in the rest of [[Latvia]]. Many Latgalian books in late 18th and early 19th century were authored by [[Jesuit]] priests, who came from various European countries to [[Latgale]] as the north-eastern outpost of the [[Roman Catholic]] religion; their writings included religious literature, calendars and poetry.

Publishing books in the Latgalian language along with the [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] was forbidden from 1865 to 1904. The ban on using Latin letters in this part of the [[Russian Empire]] followed immediately after the [[January Uprising]], where Polish insurgents in [[Poland]], and also in [[Lithuania]] and [[Latgale]], challenged the czarist rule. During the ban, only a limited number of smuggled Catholic religious texts and some hand-written literature was available, e.g. calendars written by the self-educated peasant [[Andryvs Jūrdžys]].

After the repeal of the ban in 1904 there was a quick rebirth of the Latgalian literary tradition; first newspapers, textbooks and grammars appeared. In 1918 [[Latgale]] became part of the newly created Latvian state. From 1920 to 1934 the two literary traditions of Latvians developed in parallel. A notable achievement during this period was the original translation of the [[New Testament]] into Latgalian by the priest and scholar [[Aloizijs Broks]], published in [[Aglona]] in 1933. After the coup staged by [[Kārlis Ulmanis]] in 1934, the subject of the Latgalian dialect was removed from the school curriculum and was invalidated for use in state institutions; this was as part of an effort to standardize Latvian language usage. Latgalian survived as a spoken language during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] annexation of Latvia (1940–1991) while printed literature in Latgalian virtually ceased between 1959 and 1989. Some Latgalian intellectuals in emigration continued to publish books and studies of the Latgalian language, most notably [[Mikeļs Bukšs]], see [http://www.immi.se/kultur/authors/letter/bukss.htm bibliography].

Since the restoration of [[Latvia]]n independence there has been a noticeable increase of interest in the Latgalian language and cultural heritage. It is taught as an optional subject in some universities; in [[Rēzekne]] the [http://www.lkcizdevnieciba.lv "Latgales kultūras centra izdevniecība"] (Publishing House of Latgalian Culture Centre) led by [http://www.gramata21.lv/users/elksnis_janis/ Jānis Elksnis], prints both old and new books in Latgalian.

In 1992, [[Juris Cibuļs]] together with Lideja Leikuma published one of the first Latgalian [[Alphabet books]] after the restoration of the language.

In the [[21st century]] the Latgalian language has become more visible in Latvia's cultural life. Apart from its preservation movements, Latgalian can be more often heard in different interviews on the national TV channels, and there are modern rockgroups such as [[Borowa MC]] and [[Dabasu Durovys]] singing in Latgalian who have had moderate success also throughout the country. Today, Latgalian is also found in written form in public signs, such as some street names and shop signs,&lt;ref&gt;Sanita Lazdina. 2013. A transitions from spontaneity to planning? Economic values and educational policies in the process of revitalizing the regional language of Latgalian (Latvia). ''Current Issues in Language Planning'' 14:382-402.&lt;/ref&gt; evidences of growing use in the [[linguistic landscape]].

== Classification ==
Latgalian is a member of the [[Eastern Baltic languages|Eastern Baltic]] branch of the [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] group of languages included in the family of [[Indo-European languages]]. The branch also includes [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Samogitian language|Samogitian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]. Latgalian is a moderately [[Inflection|inflected]] language; the number of [[verb]] and [[noun]] forms is characteristic of many other [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] and [[Slavic languages]] (see [[Inflection#Baltic languages|Inflection in Baltic Languages]]).

== Geographic distribution ==
[[File:Everyday use of Latgalian (2011).svg|thumbnail|300px|Use of Latgalian in everyday communication in Latvia (2011)]]
Latgalian is spoken by about 150,000 people,{{Atlas UNESCO|Latvia}} mainly in [[Latgale|Latgale, Latvia]]; there are small Latgalian-speaking communities in [[Russia]], [[Siberia]].

== Official status ==
Between 1920 and 1934 Latgalian was used in local government and education in [[Latgale]]. Now Latgalian is not used as an official language anywhere in Latvia. It is formally protected by the Latvian Language Law stating that "The Latvian State ensures the preservation, protection and development of the Latgalian literary language as a historical variant of the Latvian language" (§3.4).&lt;ref&gt;[http://isec.gov.lv/normdok/vvallik.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050307003315/http://isec.gov.lv/normdok/vvallik.htm |date=March 7, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a state-supported orthography commission of the Latgalian language. Whether the Latgalian language is a separate language or a [[dialect]] of [[Latvian language|Latvian]] has been a matter of heated debate throughout the 20th century. Proponents of Latgalian such as linguists Antons Breidaks and Lidija Leikuma have suggested Latgalian has the characteristics of an independent language. Officially Latgalian is considered a variety of Latvian, meaning that Latvian language has two different written standards - Latvian and Latgalian.

== Dialects ==
Latgalian speakers can be classified into three main groups – Northern, Central and Southern. These three groups of local accents are entirely [[mutually intelligible]] and characterized only by minor changes in vowels, diphthongs and some inflexion endings. The regional accents of central Latgale (such as those spoken in the towns and rural municipalities of Juosmuiža, Vuorkova, Vydsmuiža, Viļāni, Sakstygols, Ūzulaine, Makašāni, Drycāni, Gaigalova, Bierži, Tiļža and Nautrāni) form the phonetical basis of the modern standard Latgalian language. The literature of the 18th century was more influenced by the Southern accents of Latgalian.

== Alphabet ==
The Latgalian language uses an alphabet with 35 letters. Its orthography is similar to [[Latvian orthography]], but has two additional letters: {{angbr|y}} represents {{IPA|[ɨ]}}), an allophone of {{IPA|/i/}} which is absent in standard Latvian. The letter {{angbr|ō}} survives from the pre-1957 Latvian orthography.

===Poem of Armands Kūceņš===
Tik skrytuļam ruodīs: iz vītys jis grīžās,&lt;br&gt;
A brauciejam breinums, kai tuoli ceļš aizvess,&lt;br&gt;
Tai vuorpsteite cīši pret sprāduoju paušās,&lt;br&gt;
Jei naatteik – vacei gi dzejis gols zvaigznēs.

Pruots naguorbej ramu, juos lepneibu grūžoj,&lt;br&gt;
Vys jamās pa sovam ļauds pasauli puormeit,&lt;br&gt;
Bet nak jau sevkuram vīns kuorsynoj myužu&lt;br&gt;
I ramaņu jumtus līk īguodu kuormim.

Na vysim tai sadar kai kuošam ar speini,&lt;br&gt;
Sirds narymst i nabeidz par sātmalim tēmēt,&lt;br&gt;
A pruots rauga skaitejs pa rokstaudža zeimem,&lt;br&gt;
Kai riedeits, kod saulei vēļ vaiņuku jēme.

=== [[Lord's Prayer]]===
Tāvs myusu, kas esi debesīs,&lt;br&gt;
svēteits lai tūp Tovs vōrds.&lt;br&gt;
Lai atnōk Tova vaļsteiba.&lt;br&gt;
Tova vaļa lai nūteik, kai debesīs,&lt;br&gt; 
tai ari vērs zemes.&lt;br&gt;
Myusu ikdīneiškū maizi dūd mums šudiņ.&lt;br&gt;
Un atlaid mums myusu porōdus,&lt;br&gt;
kai ari mes atlaižam sovim porōdnīkim.&lt;br&gt;
Un naīved myusu kārdynōšonā,&lt;br&gt; 
bet izglōb myusus nu ļauna Amen.

{{Lebanese people}}

There is a significant community of '''Lebanese people in Senegal'''.&lt;ref name="VOA"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2007-07-10-voa46.html|title=Lebanese Immigrants Boost West African Commerce|first=Naomi|last=Schwarz|periodical=Voice of America|date=2007-07-10|accessdate=2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration history==
The first trader from [[Lebanon]] arrived in [[Senegal]] in the 1860s. However, early migration was slow; by 1900, there were only about one hundred Lebanese living in the country, mostly from the vicinity of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]. They worked as street vendors in [[Dakar]], [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]], and [[Rufisque]]. After [[World War I]], they began to move into the peanut trade. With the establishment of the [[French Mandate of Lebanon]], Lebanese immigration expanded sharply.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Brien|1975|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the [[Great Depression]] and again after [[World War II]], French traders lobbied the government to [[immigration reduction|restrict]] Lebanese immigration; however, the government generally ignored such lobbying.&lt;ref name="Boumedouha 1990 538"&gt;{{harvnb|Boumedouha|1990|p=538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interethnic relations==
During the colonial period, the Lebanese tended to support independence movements.&lt;ref name="Boumedouha 1990 538"/&gt; Their social position outside of the colonial relationship, as neither colonist nor colonised, enabled them to maintain good relations with both Senegalese consumers as well as the large French businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Brien|1975|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[History of Senegal#Independence|Senegal gained independence]] in 1960, most French small traders left the country; however, indigenous Senegalese people began to compete increasingly with the Lebanese in the peanut sector, and soon after, the whole peanut marketing sector was [[nationalization|nationalised]].&lt;ref name="Boumedouha 1990 538"/&gt;

Lebanese migrants and their descendants have tended to maintain [[multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]] of both [[Lebanese nationality law|Lebanon]] and Senegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leichtman|2005|p=663}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most speak Arabic, Wolof and French, and some have become involved in [[Politics of Senegal|Senegalese politics]]. However, they are a fairly [[endogamy|endogamous]] community.&lt;ref name="VOA"/&gt;

In the early 2000s, the Lebanese began to be displaced from their position as a market-dominant minority by the [[Chinese people in Senegal|influx of Chinese traders]] and the cheap goods they brought from China; as a result, the Lebanese began to shift to a pattern of buying goods from the Chinese and reselling them in remote areas of the country where no Chinese migrants lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gaye|2008|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15709">{{short description|A list of names}}
The following '''list of Americans in the Venona papers''' is a list of names deciphered from codenames contained in the [[Venona project]], an American government effort from 1943-1980 to decrypt coded messages by intelligence forces of the [[Soviet Union]]. To what extent some of the individuals named in the Venona papers were actually involved with [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|Soviet intelligence]] is a topic of [[Venona project#Critical views|dispute]].

The following list of individuals is extracted in large part from the work of historians [[John Earl Haynes]] and [[Harvey Klehr]] and reflects their previous points of view.&lt;ref name="r5"&gt;John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr (1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=M8p00bTFvRkC&amp;lpg=PR5&amp;pg=PR6#v=onepage&amp;q ''Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America''], Yale University Press, {{ISBN|0300077718}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Haynes' positions on the meaning and correct identification of names on the list continues to evolve.

Non-Americans may also be mentioned in passing.

==Notes and disclaimers on the list==

Names marked with a double asterisk (**) do not appear in the Venona documents. Inclusion has been inferred to correlate with codenames or similarly spelled names found in the documents.

Similarly, identities that have been inferred by researchers (i.e., the name appears in the Venona documents, but positive identification of the individual bearing that name does not), are also marked with a double asterisk (**).

[[File:Kuala-Lumpur Malaysia Warrior-Square-at-Police-Museum-01.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Warrior Square ({{lang-ms|Dataran Perwira}}) is the monument for the Malaysian police officers who were killed in the line of duty. The memorial was set aside on the compound in the RMP Museum.]]
[[File:Malaysian Police Museum Centre (outside).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Outside the Police Museum Centre, are the names of all Malaysian police officers killed in the line of duty since the 1940s mounted on a board on the wall known as Warrior Square ({{lang-ms|Dataran Perwira}}).]]

This is a '''list of police officers from the [[Royal Malaysia Police]] who were killed in the line of duty''', based on official records from the year 1915 to date. Line of duty deaths refers to any police officer who has died while carrying out duty which he is obligated and/or authorised to carry out. This would include officers who respond to incidents while off-duty as obligated by the [[Police (Malaysia) Act 1967|Police Force Act 1967]], as well as those commuting to and from their place of duty or training.

Police records show a total of 1,346 policemen were killed in the line of duty while 10,698 communist members were killed, of which 5,972 were killed by the police force. The police, being the main law enforcement agency in the country were tasked during the Emergency period to combat and foil attempts by the communist party wanting to set up a communist state via the use of force and firearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title='Royal' day for police force|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/7/24/nation/21906549&amp;sec=nation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080801192535/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F7%2F24%2Fnation%2F21906549&amp;sec=nation|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 August 2008|newspaper=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|date=24 July 2008|accessdate=6 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethnic profile of police officers has been traditionally disproportionate compared to the national ethnic profile, with a significantly higher proportion of ethnic Malays especially in the earlier decades. However, the number of casualties involving ethnic Malay police officers are statistically higher overall due in part to the high mortality rates involving the ethnic Malay community during the [[Malayan Emergency]] in the 1950-1970s, and in part to the ethnic composition of the police force.

"Eight Policemen are killed in Bandit Ambush" i.e. 'half the strength of a jungle squad - were killed when they fought back against a force of bandits which outnumbered them by about seven to one a few miles north of Rawang.  Inspector Kartar Singh was leading his squad up a hill on the west of the Estate when the communists opened fire from very close range' 'Eight dead included the Inspector, a Sergeant, and six other policemen. Two policemen were wounded'.

Despite the odds, the policemen led by Sgt 3493, refused to surrender, although numerous calls by the communists for them to lay down arms were made. In the final hours of the fierce battle, the Communists set fire to the officer's barracks and station. Only about five hours after the first shot was fired did the communists manage to break their defences and set the place ablaze. They then retreated into the jungle, leaving a trail of destruction and bloodshed. Only 14 police officers, 5 auxiliary police and their families were killed in the incident while 4 officers such as MPC 37, PC 7645, PC 10533 and EPC 3472 wounded in the battle.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/jazlany/hh_bukitkepong.htm&amp;date=2009-10-26+00:42:19 Bukit Kepong]''&lt;/ref&gt; Few years after the incident, the Malay Communist leader who responsible about the incident was arrested by Batu Pahat Police Special Branch detectives and hanged to death at [[Perak]].

Besides him, 12 crews including three Dakota crews, four air despatchers and other passengers also perished in the incident. A platoon of British troops went to the rescue and they reached the crash site, but due to the communist threats, they hastily buried the deads in makeshift graves. 58 years later, on 3 October 2008, the British and Malaysian government set a biggest recovery operation project so far to visit the wreckage site and recovered the remains.

__NOTOC__
The '''Mandara people''', also known as '''Wandala''' or '''Mandwara''', are a [[Central Africa]]n Muslim ethnic group found in north [[Cameroon]] northeastern [[Nigeria]], and southeastern [[Chad]].&lt;ref name=mandarassum&gt;[http://www.mandaras.info/WandalaMandara.html Mandara/Wandala] Muller-Kosack Ethnic Handbook (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; They speak the Wandala language, which is Chadic branch of Afro-Asiatic languages found in northeastern Africa.&lt;ref name=ethnomand/&gt;

Their origins are unclear. They live in the mountainous region and valleys north of the Benue River in Cameroon, and have long been a part of the Mandara Sultanate.&lt;ref name="FageGray1975p129"/&gt; Their region witnessed slave trading and sub-Saharan caravans till the 19th century.&lt;ref name=jdfage131/&gt; The Mandara people were known for their horse raising and iron working skills,&lt;ref&gt;David Nicholas (2012, Editor), Metals in Mandara mountains' society and culture, Africa World Press, {{ISBN|978-1592218905}}, see Cameroon and Nigeria-related chapters: ''The development of endogamy among smiths of the Mandara mountains eastern piedmont: myths, history and material evidence'' by Olivier Langlois; and ''The wife of the village: understanding caste in the Mandara mountains'' by James H. Wade&lt;/ref&gt; and featured a society that was socially stratified.&lt;ref name=sterner355/&gt;&lt;ref name="BissonChilds2000p160"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DavidKramer2001p75"/&gt;

==History==
The origins of the Mandara people are in the [[Mandara Kingdom]], once found in the Mandara Mountains, along the northern Cameroon at its border with northeastern Nigeria between the [[Benue River]] and [[Mora, Cameroon]].&lt;ref name=mandarassum/&gt;&lt;ref name=mohammadou7/&gt;

[[File:Mandara people with caste system Sahel Africa.png|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Mandara people distribution in [[Sahel]] (approx).]]
Their prehistory is unclear. One oral traditions trace their start to a king Agamakiya in the 13th century, who led them as invasions came from the [[Sahel]]. They converted to [[Sunni]] Islam under Sultan Bukar Aaji in the 1720s.&lt;ref name=mandarassum/&gt; Another tradition states Wandala Mbra was one of the sons of Mbra of Turu and Katala, the daughter of Vaya, he adopted Islam and it is his lineage that formed this patrilineal Muslim ethnic group.&lt;ref name=mohammadou7&gt;E Mohammadou (1982), Le royaume du Wandala ou Mandara au XIXe siecle, African Languages and Ethnography 14, Tokyo, pages 7-9&lt;/ref&gt; These oral traditions may have been reconstructed later, when Mandara came under the influence of and cooperated in Fulani jihads, slave raids on other ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="FageGray1975p129"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J.

Islamic historians mention the Mandara people, but also provide inconsistent accounts of their history. One account by Ibn Fartuwa states that they were unbelievers, but they converted to Islam in the 16th century. Another account states that It is their ruler who invited two Moroccans from [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]] returning from Mecca, to stay with him. They converted him, and he then mandated the Islamic traditions of circumcision, prayer, zakat and fasting among his Mandara people in early 18th-century.&lt;ref name="FageGray1975p129"/&gt; Between the 18th and 19th centuries, the Mandara people's region was surrounded by pagan people, and these were a source of slaves through raiding, and for trade to the African slave caravans.&lt;ref name=jdfage131&gt;{{cite book|author1=J.

==Society and culture==
Their historic lands have been midst a densely populated river valley surrounded by volcanic mountains rich in iron ore, famed as a horse breeding area.&lt;ref name="FageGray1975p129"/&gt; Their Sultans have had Mora in Cameroon as their capital. The Mandara people have lived in dispersed villages, each with a mosque, growing [[sorghum]] as their principal crop and producing iron tools that were sought by traders and other ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=mandarassum/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/place/Mandara-Mountains Mandara Mountains], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sterner355&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sterner | first=Judy | last2=David | first2=Nicholas | title=Gender and Caste in the Mandara Highlands: Northeastern Nigeria and Northern Cameroon | journal=Ethnology | publisher=University of Pttsburgh Press | volume=30 | issue=4 | year=1991 | pages=355–369 | doi=10.2307/3773690 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mandara people wear Muslim dress typically of northern Africa, and they carry leather amulets around their neck that contains verses from the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Mukum Mbaku|title=Culture and Customs of Cameroon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJbTfGbk-LEC&amp;pg=PA7|year=2005|publisher=Greenwood |isbn=978-0-313-33231-9|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Marwat''' ({{lang-ps|مروت}}) is a [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] tribe, a branch of the [[Lohani]]&lt;ref name=pakistanreview1971&gt;{{cite journal |year=1971 |title=War Ballads of West Pakistan |journal=The Pakistan Review |publisher=[[Ferozsons]] |volume=19 |pages=10–11 |issn=0031-0077 }}&lt;/ref&gt; tribe and belong to [[Lodi (Pashtun tribe)|Lodi]] section of the Mati Afghans, located primarily in [[Lakki Marwat District]], parts of [[Dera Ismail Khan District]], some villages of [[Tank District|Tank]] district and in the Katawaz area of Afghanistan. The Marwats are also known as ''Spin Lohani'' (White faction of Lohanis), and their most closely related kin are other Lohani tribes like Miya Khel, Daulat Khel and Tatur. In the Afghan dynasty of Hind (1451-1526), Lohanis were the most powerful among the Lodi Afghans and were in possession of one quarter of jagirs in India. The Marwats were named for their ancestor Marwat Khan Lodi.&lt;ref name=sher&gt;Mohmand, Sher Muhammad, ''The Marwats''. p. 50-53&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
:''See also [[Bannu]]''

Marwats, as well as other branches of Lohanis, lived in [[Katawaz]] (located in the [[Paktika]] province) as well as Wana valley of South Waziristan. They had a long-standing dispute with [[Sulaiman Khel]]s and other [[Ghilzais]], who had already forced other Lodi tribes to migrate en masse to India. In one of the decisive battles, in the mid-15th century, Lohanis were thoroughly defeated by the Ghilzais, and had to leave Katawaz to the latter. Lohanis and their [[Dotani]] cousins had to be content with just [[Wana, Pakistan|Wana]] valley and surroundings.

The Marwat and other Lohanis expanded from [[Waziristan]] further east, occupying large tracts of present-day Dera Ismail Khan and Tank, by defeating Prangi, Suri and Sarwani tribes. Marwats stayed in Waziristan while Daulat Khels and Taturs migrated to newly conquered Daman. The headman of Kati Khel (branch of Daulat Khel), then the chief of all Lohanis, agreed to give shares in the income from the lands of Daman to Marwats and Miya Khels. In the late 16th century, or in the beginning of the 17th century, Wazirs issued from their homeland [[Birmal]] and encroached upon the territories of Marwats in the nowadays South [[aziristan|Waziristan]] (present day abodes of Ahmadzai Wazirs). Wazirs, with the aid of Mehsuds, defeated Marwats and Dotanis, the former were expelled while the latter was allowed to retain some lands in Wana. When the Marwats arrived in Daman to take possession of their lands, the Daulat Khel Lohanis opposed that. In the subsequent battle, the Daulat Khels were defeated by Marwats, and were expelled from Daman. The Daulat Khels sought the help of [[Gandapurs]], Babars and [[Bhittanis]], and this alliance was able to defeat the Marwats.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"The Marwats" by Sher Muhammad Mohmand&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bannu Gazetterr"&gt;Bannu Gazetterr&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeated Marwats stayed in Dara Pezu and surroundings for some time, until they got the invitation from a section of Niazis, who were settled in present-day [[Lakki Marwat]], to assist them in defeating the rival clan. Marwats turned against the Niazis. The [[Niazi]] clan first defeated the Marwat clan against whom they were hired and slaughtered them in great numbers. After the friendship with their brothers Marwats, Niazis fled towards [[Mianwali]]. Some where between 1601 and 1607, Marwats had taken possession of all the 'Tal' tract.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Marwats were nominally part of Mughal empire. After decline of Mughals, the area came under Durranis. Ahmad Shah Abdali didn't enforce taxes on Marwats but put the condition of providing contingents of Marwat warriors for his military campaigns. In the most important military campaign of Abdali, 120 Marwat horsemen accompanied him under their chief Begu Khan to India. Ahmad Shah's successor, Timur Shah Durrani, enforced Tax on Marwats.&lt;ref name="Bannu Gazetterr"/&gt;

After the [[Third Battle of Panipat|battle of Panipat]], Marwats split into two factions, White and Black and fought each other for next 60 years. Taking advantage of their internal rift, Wazirs conquered some area from Marwats in the sandy tracts of the present day Bannu district. In 1819, Nawab of Mankera interested in the civil war of Marwats on the invitation of one party and later occupied the area for themselves. The weakened Marwats were unable to resist the occupation and thus Marwats lost the independence. Soon after, [[Sikhs]] conquered Lakki Marwat and built a fort on the bank of river Gambila near Present day Lakki city. In 1847 Marwats rose in rebellion against the Sikhs but it was successfully suppressed by the latter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barmazid.com/2014/11/when-beat-of-battle-drums-of-marwats.html Marwat uprising against the Sikh]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Anglo-Sikh Wars]], Marwats provided great deal of help to British against the Sikhs. The relationship of Marwats and British remained friendly for the most part, though some of Marwats joined faqir of ipi's movement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Haymarket Square, Chicago==

[[File:Haymarket Square, Chicago Circa 1905 (front) (cropped).png|thumb|right|300px|The original monument as seen in the busy Haymarket Square, circa 1905]]
In 1889, a commemorative nine-foot (2.7 meter) bronze statue of a Chicago policeman by sculptor [[Johannes Gelert]] was erected in the middle of Haymarket Square with private funds raised by the [[Union League Club of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, ''Haymarket Revisited'', pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; The statue was unveiled on May 30, 1889, by Frank Degan, the son of Officer Mathias Degan.&lt;ref name="CPDweblog"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpdweblog.typepad.com/chicago_police_department/2007/05/haymarket_statu.html |title=Haymarket Statue Rededication Ceremony at Police Headquarters |accessdate=January 23, 2008 |date=May 31, 2007 |work=Chicago Police Department weblog |publisher=Chicago Police Department |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071218051754/http://cpdweblog.typepad.com/chicago_police_department/2007/05/haymarket_statu.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = December 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 4, 1927, the 41st anniversary of the Haymarket affair, a [[Tram|streetcar]] jumped its tracks and crashed into the monument.&lt;ref name=AdelmanTrueStory&gt;Adelman, William J., "The True Story Behind the Haymarket Police Statue", in [[David Roediger|Roediger]] and Rosemont, eds., ''Haymarket Scrapbook'', pp. 167–168.&lt;/ref&gt;  The motorman said he was "sick of seeing that policeman with his arm raised".&lt;ref name=AdelmanTrueStory/&gt; The city restored the statue in 1928 and moved it to Union Park.&lt;ref name=Adelman39&gt;Adelman, ''Haymarket Revisited'', p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s, construction of the [[Kennedy Expressway]] erased about half of the old, run-down market square, and in 1956, the statue was moved to a special platform built for it overlooking the freeway, near its original location.&lt;ref name=Adelman39/&gt;

The Haymarket statue was vandalized with black paint on May 4, 1968, the 82nd anniversary of the Haymarket affair, following a confrontation between police and demonstrators at a protest against the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=Adelman40&gt;Adelman, ''Haymarket Revisited'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 6, 1969, shortly before the "[[Days of Rage]]" protests, the statue was destroyed when a bomb was placed between its legs.

"Struggles at Haymarket: An Embattled History of Static Monuments and Public Interventions," 261&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, it was moved to the lobby of the Central Police Headquarters, and in 1976 to the enclosed courtyard of the Chicago police academy.&lt;ref name=Adelman40/&gt; For another three decades the statue's empty, graffiti-marked [[pedestal]] stood on its platform in the run-down remains of Haymarket Square where it was known as an [[anarchist]] landmark.&lt;ref name=Adelman40/&gt; On June 1, 2007, the statue was rededicated at Chicago Police Headquarters with a new pedestal, unveiled by Geraldine Doceka, Officer Mathias Degan's great-granddaughter.&lt;ref name="CPDweblog"/&gt;

In 1992, the site of the speakers' wagon was marked by a bronze plaque set into the sidewalk, reading:

{{quote|A decade of strife between labor and industry culminated here in a confrontation that resulted in the tragic death of both workers and policemen. On May 4, 1886, spectators at a labor rally had gathered around the mouth of Crane's Alley. A contingent of police approaching on Des Plaines Street were met by a bomb thrown from just south of the alley. The resultant trial of eight activists gained worldwide attention for the labor movement, and initiated the tradition of 'May Day' labor rallies in many cities.

==''Haymarket Martyrs' Monument''==
{{main|Haymarket Martyrs' Monument}}
[[File:Haymarket Martyr's Memorial.jpg|thumb|right|''Haymarket Martyrs Monument'' in Forest Home Cemetery]]
Following the Haymarket affair, trial and executions, the five dead defendants—[[George Engel]], [[Adolph Fischer]], [[Louis Lingg]], [[Albert Parsons]], and [[August Spies]]—were buried at the [[German Waldheim Cemetery]] (later merged with Forest Home Cemetery) in [[Forest Park, Illinois]], a suburb of Chicago. When they died, defendants [[Oscar Neebe]] and [[Michael Schwab]] were also buried at Waldheim.

The Pioneer Aid and Support Association organized a subscription for a funeral monument. In 1893, the ''[[Haymarket Martyrs' Monument]]'' by sculptor [[Albert Weinert]] was raised at Waldheim. It consists of a 16-foot-high granite shaft capped by a carved triangular stone. There is a two step base, which also supports a monumental figure of a woman standing over the body of a fallen worker, both in bronze. It was dedicated on June 25, 1893, after a march from Chicago. The inscription on the steps read, "1887", the year of the executions. Also, there is a quote attributed to Spies, recorded just before his execution by hanging: "The day will come when our silence will be more powerful than the voice you are throttling today."

On the back of the monument are listed the names of the men. On the top of the monument, a bronze plaque contains text of the pardon later issued by Illinois governor [[John Peter Altgeld]].&lt;ref name=Landmark&gt;National Historic Landmark Nomination form, 1997 {{NHLS url|id=97000343|title=}}, Robin Bachin, [[Newberry Library]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The dedication ceremony was attended by 8,000, with union flags and the American flag draped on the monument. European unions and American organizations sent flowers to be placed.&lt;ref name=Landmark/&gt;

The ''Haymarket Martyrs' Monument'' was designated a [[National Register of Historic Places|National Historic Landmark]] by the [[United States Department of the Interior]] in 1997.&lt;ref name=Landmark/&gt;

On September 14, 2004, Daley and union leaders—including the president of Chicago's police union—unveiled a monument by Chicago artist Mary Brogger, a fifteen-foot speakers' wagon sculpture echoing the wagon on which the labor leaders stood in Haymarket Square to champion the eight-hour day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kinzer |first=Stephen |title=In Chicago, an Ambiguous Memorial to the Haymarket Attack |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/15/national/15memorial.html |work=New York Times |date=September 15, 2004 |accessdate=January 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bronze sculpture, intended to be the centerpiece of a proposed "Labor Park", is meant to symbolize both the rally at Haymarket and [[free speech]]. The planned site was to include an international commemoration wall, sidewalk plaques, a cultural pylon, a seating area, and banners, but construction has not yet begun.

The State Award System of the [[Russian Federation]] has varied and distinct origins. The first being pre-1917 orders of the [[Russian Empire]] re-established after the 1991 dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]], the second is from former Soviet orders that were slightly modified and retained post 1991, we also find many completely new awards resembling Imperial awards in basic design since the reintroduction of Russian heraldry.

Originally set up following the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]] by Decision of the [[Supreme Soviet]] of the Russian Federation № 2557-I of March 20, 1992, the statutes of all state awards was later ratified in [[Decree of the President of Russia|Presidential Decree]] № 442 of March 2, 1994.&lt;ref name="pres 442 1994"/&gt;  The entire state awards' system of the Russian Federation was amended on September 7, 2010 by presidential decree № 1099,&lt;ref name="decree1099"&gt;{{cite web  | authorlink = Russian Government | title = Decree of the President of the Russian Federation of September 7, 2010 No 1099 | publisher = Russian Gazette | date = 2010-09-07 | url = http://www.rg.ru/2010/09/15/nagrady-dok.html | language = Russian | accessdate =2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; this all encompassing decree distanced modern Russian awards from their Soviet roots.  Presidential Decree № 1631 of December 16, 2011&lt;ref name="1631-2011"/&gt; amended and finalized the order of precedence of all modern Russian awards. Awards can be revoked by the State Duma if the recipient is not deemed fit to receive the award.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10283">{{Pashtuns}}
'''Pashtun culture''' ({{lang-ps|پښتني هڅوب}}) is based on [[Islam]] and [[Pashtunwali]], which is an ancient way of life, as well as speaking of the [[Pashto language]] and wearing [[Pashtun dress]]. The culture of the [[Pashtun people]] is highlighted since at least the time of [[Herodotus]] (484–425 BC) or [[Alexander the Great]], when he explored the [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]] region in 330 BC. The Pashtun culture has little outside influence, and, over the ages, has retained a great degree of purity.

==Holidays and special events==
The biggest holidays for Pashtuns are the Islamic [[Eid al-Fitr]] and [[Eid al-Adha]], followed by [[Afghan Independence Day]] (August 19) and [[Pakistan Independence Day]] (August 14). The arrival of Sparlay or spring, known as [[Nowruz|Naw-Wraz]] (New Day), is also celebrated by some Pashtuns. It is an ancient annual Pashtun [[festival]] which celebrates both the beginning of spring and the New Year. Amongst some [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]]s, Sheshbeeyeh, a prelude festival to [[Nowruz|Nava Wroz]], is also celebrated. This tradition still survives, mainly amongst the southerners, in [[Bannu]] and [[Waziristan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Key Afghan, US leadership plant trees for Farmer’s Day |author=Lt. j.g. Keith Goodsell |url=http://www.centcom.mil/news/key-afghan-us-leadership-plant-trees-for-farmer-s-day |publisher=[[United States Central Command]] |date=March 7, 2011 |accessdate=2012-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; During holidays, Pashtuns set up festivals in which they usually attend mosques to make special prayers, have [[Barbecue#Events and gatherings|cookouts]] in parks, and go to [[fair]]s.

===Pashto poetry===
{{Main|Pashto literature and poetry}}
Afghanistan and K.P.K. were noted for its poetic language even before the [[Islamic conquest of Afghanistan]]. The [[Pata Khazana]] contains [[Pashto literature and poetry|Pashto poetry]] written as far back as the 8th century. Some notable poets from the region of Afghanistan-Pakistan include [[Amir Kror Suri]], [[Khushal Khan Khattak]], [[Rahman Baba]], [[Nazo Tokhi]], [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]], [[Timur Shah Durrani]], [[Shuja Shah Durrani]], [[Ghulam Muhammad Tarzi]], and [[Khan Abdul Ghani Khan]].&lt;ref&gt;Afghanistan Online, [http://www.afghan-web.com/culture/poetry/cpoets.html Classical Dari and Pashto Poets]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pashtun men usually gather at special events and listen to Pashto poetry. There are TV programs which broadcast such events to the wider Pashtun audiences. One such program is on [[AVT Khyber]] channel in Pakistan, with Amanullah Kakar as the presenter.

==Music and dances==
{{Main|Pashto music}}
[[File:Afghan rubab.jpg|thumb|left|A man playing a rubab in [[Farah, Afghanistan]]]]
Traditional Pashto music is mostly [[klasik]] [[ghazal]]s, using [[rubab (instrument)|rubab]] or [[sitar]], [[tabla]], portable [[Pump organ|harmonium]], [[flute]] and several other musical instruments. 

Below is a list of the main known styles of Attan in Pakistan and Afghanistan. All of these may be practiced and mixed by Pashtuns in other valleys, and it's not uncommon to see Pashtuns of one province being better at a different region's style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtualafghans.com/attan/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://khyber.org/culture/atan/atan.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925232856/http://www.khyber.org/culture/atan/atan.shtml |archivedate=2006-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ps|'''اتڼ'''}}; [[ALA-LC Romanization]]: Ataṇ, also referred to as Atan or Attan, are the following:

===Attan dance===
In this dance, the dancers perform to the beat of the music. It is typically performed by men and women. It involves 2–5 steps, ending with a clap given while facing the center, after which the process is repeated. The hips and arms are put in a sequential movement including left and right tilts, with the wrists twisting in sequence. Ultimately a hand is projected outward and brought in a 'scoop-like' fashion towards the center where the other hand meets it for a clap. This dance is typically performed with the musician dictating the duration and speed.

===Khattak dance===
{{Main|Khattak dance}}
[[File:Khattak dance.jpg|thumb|A group of dancers performing Khattak dance in Pakistan]]
The [[Khattak dance]] is performed by the [[Khattak]] tribe, mainly in Pakistan but also in some eastern parts of Afghanistan.

===Mahsud Attan (sance)===
This is a unique dance routine using rifles performed by the [[Mahsud]] tribe of [[Pashtuns]] in South Waziristan. Originally it was performed at times of war, but later became a cultural dance. The dancers dance empty handed and require only large drums. Nowadays it is performed with guns in the dancers' hands; loaded guns are taken in one hand, and to the beat of the drum the dancers move forward in a circle. After taking two and a half steps, each dancer turns about and cocks the gun. All the dancers do this in a uniform manner, and by completing the turning steps they fire in the air simultaneously. The sound of the guns seems to be a single big bang.

===Waziri dance===
[[Waziristan]], a region of [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] of Pakistan, is a large area and has a particular Pashtun culture. Two drummers and a flute player play a particular tune. All the Wazirs stand around them. Two people leave the circle, go dancing towards the drummers, and come back dancing in the same manner. While performing, both people turn around twice, once facing each other, and once facing the opposite direction. After doing this separately, they march while dancing to the assembled crowd. As they reach the circle, another pair of performers move forward in the same fashion.

==Clothing==
{{Main|Pashtun dress}}
[[File:Clothing worn by most Pashtun males.jpg|thumb|upright|Pashtun dress of Pakistan and Afghanistan]]
Pashtun men usually wear a Partūg-Kamees in [[Pashto language|Pashto]] (sometimes worn with a [[pakul]] or paṭkay). In the [[Kandahar]] region young men usually wear different type of hat similar to a [[Sindhi topi|topi]] and in the [[Peshawar]] region they wear white [[kufi]]s instead. Leaders or tribal chiefs sometimes wear a [[Karakul (hat)|karakul]] hat, like [[Hamid Karzai]] and others. The Pashtun Lūngai (or Paṭkay) is the most worn headpiece in Afghanistan, with different tribes having different styles and colours to indicate what tribe or region they come from.

Women and girls wear traditional long dresses and cover their hair with a light piece of cloth.

==Cuisine==
Pashtun cuisine varies among districts in Afghanistan. Pashtuns are known for their large varieties of dried fruit and [[yogurt]] based dishes. Yogurt called maste is usually made by the Pashtuns themselves in their own homes. The national dish of Afghanistan is "Qabili Pilav" and is served in the Pashtun areas of Pakistan as well. Chai (tea) plays a big role in Pashtun gatherings and is served with dried fruits and kulcha (biscuit). Desserts such as firni (custard) are also very popular.

==Sport==

===Cricket===

===Football===

===Buzkashi and polo===
{{Further|Buzkashi}}
{{Also|Culture of Afghanistan}}
Some Pashtuns in [[Central Asia]] participate in [[buzkashi]], which is a sport introduced in the region during the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] period from the 13th century onward. The word ''buz'' means "[[goat]]" and ''kashi'' means "dragging" or "pulling" in the [[Persian language]]. The basic objective is to carry the headless carcass of a calf or goat around a flag and back to the starting point while on horseback with other riders trying to do the same thing by taking the carcass away. This is not a team sport, it is every man for himself, which becomes apparent as soon as the game starts. It is played on a large open dusty field which does not appear to have many boundaries. The game is a microcosm of power politics in Afghanistan. Although buskashi is primarily an individual sport, alliances are built up between various players. Between the alliances, the strongest players finally take control (or in this case the remnants of a headless calf) and ride off to victory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19046">'''Philip Olin Keeney''' (1891–1962), and his wife, [[Mary Jane Keeney]], were librarians who became part of the [[Silvermaster spy ring]] in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="greenwood.com"&gt;Rosalee McReynolds, Louise S. Robbins: ''The Librarian Spies: Philip and Mary Jane Keeney and Cold War Espionage'', Greenwood Publishing Group, {{ISBN|978-0-275-99448-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Keeney met Mary Jane when both were working as librarians at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1929. In 1931, he became head librarian and professor of library economy at Montana State University (now known as the [[University of Montana]]) at Missoula, where he made several improvements.&lt;ref&gt;Tauber, Maurice F. &amp; Eugene Holt Wilson. Report on a Survey of the Library of Montana State University for Montana State University, January–May 1951. Chicago: American Library Association. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1930s, both Keeney and his wife were involved with left-wing political movements. In 1937, Keeney, although tenured, was summarily terminated after questioning book censorship by a local politician and supporting a proposal to revive a local chapter of the American Federation of Teachers. Supported by the American Civil Liberties Union and the American Association of University Professors, among others, Keeney brought a wrongful dismissal suit and, in 1939, the Montana Supreme Court ruled in his favor and mandated reinstatement. But, made ill by the stress, he soon resigned.&lt;ref name="greenwood.com"/&gt;

==Progressive Librarians Council==
The Keeneys moved to Berkeley, California, where they became members of the Marin County [[CPUSA]] Club, according to Mary Jane's diaries.&lt;ref name="Haynes 2000 178"&gt;{{cite book |title=Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America |last=Haynes |first=John Earl |authorlink=John Earl Haynes |author2=Harvey Klehr |year=2000 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0-300-08462-5 |page=178 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dIsmm_ZLHcIC |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, the Keeneys founded the Progressive Librarians' Council (PLC). That year, the PLC endorsed for Librarian of Congress [[Archibald MacLeish]],&lt;ref name="McReynolds Winter 1990/91"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McReynolds |first=Rosalee |year=Winter 1990–1991 |title=The Progressive Librarians Council and Its Founders |journal=Progressive Librarian |publisher=Progressive Librarians Guild |issue=2 |url=http://www.libr.org/pl/2_McReynolds.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821215531/http://libr.org/pl/2_McReynolds.html |archivedate=2006-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; chairman in 1937 of the first open meeting of the Second Congress of the [[League of American Writers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=June 21, 1937 |title=Books: Creators' Congress |journal=Time |publisher=Time Life |url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,758006,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was "founded under [[Communist]] auspices in 1935," according to a 1942 report by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin Roosevelt|Roosevelt]]'s [[Attorney General]] [[Francis Biddle]].&lt;ref&gt;During the [[Nazi-Soviet pact]], said Biddle, the League "began openly to follow the Communist Party line as dictated by the foreign policy of the Soviet Union." The League's sudden pacifism during the pact, and equally sudden reversion to pro-war militancy upon its breakdown, observed Biddle, left "little doubt of its Communist control." {{cite journal |date=September 2, 1942 |journal=Congressional Record |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |pages=7685–7686}} cited in {{cite book |title=Third Report: Un-American Activities in California |last=Joint Fact-Finding Committee |first=California Legislature |year=1947 |publisher=California Senate |location=Sacramento |pages=67–69 (PDF pp. 77–79) |url=https://archive.org/details/jointfactunamer00calirich |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he was not a librarian, the American Library Association (ALA) opposed MacLeish's candidacy, but when FDR made his appointment, the PLC candidate got the nod.&lt;ref&gt;In 1948, following the [http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,799590,00.html death] of [http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/venona/1944/18nov_lawrence_duggan.pdf Soviet agent] [[Laurence Duggan]]&amp;mdash;ten days after Duggan implicated [[Henry Collins (official)|Henry Collins]] and [[Frederick Vanderbilt Field]] in espionage, and five days after [[Alger Hiss]]'s indictment by a grand jury (Christopher D. O'Sullivan, "[http://www.gutenberg-e.org/osc01/frames/fosc08.html 8. Resignation]," ''Sumner Welles, Postwar Planning, and the Quest for a New World Order, 1937-1943'' [Columbia University Press, 2007] {{ISBN|978-0-231-14258-8}})&amp;mdash;MacLeish would dedicate a poem to Duggan, denouncing "informers" for their "slanders" and "lies." (Archibald MacLeish, "The Black Day," ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KI0ESFOvi5QC Collected Poems, 1917-1982]'' [Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1985] {{ISBN|0-395-39569-0}}, p. 403) His apparent targets were [[Hede Massing]] and [[Whittaker Chambers]], each of whom had identified Duggan.

The PLC also smuggled money to Emilio Andrés,&lt;ref name="McReynolds Winter 1990/91"/&gt; commissar of an army corps of the [[USSR|Soviet]]-backed Spanish Republican Army,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Spaniards in the Holocaust: Mauthausen, the Horror on the Danube |last=Wingeate |first=David |year=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0-415-22780-1 |pages=110–111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-9uRoGlfSM8C |accessdate=2010-07-25}} Wingeate claims that Andrés was killed during World War II, but McReynolds claims that "Following World War II, Keeney's wife Mary Jane... met [Andrés' wife]... who... died shortly after this meeting. The Keeney's, along with other members of the PLC, continued to send money and clothing to Emilio..."&lt;/ref&gt; in exile in [[France]] after the [[Spanish Civil War]]. During the [[Hitler-Stalin pact]], the PLC sent a letter to FDR urging him not to aid [[Poland]], [[France]] or the [[United Kingdom]], all fighting for their lives under the [[Nazi]] onslaught. (The letter had been phrased in such a way that it appeared to be from the ALA, but that group sent the President its own missive clarifying that the PLC did not speak for the ALA.) Once the pact broke down, and [[Germany]] invaded the [[Soviet Union]], the PLC altered its position, advocating American participation in the war.&lt;ref name="McReynolds Winter 1990/91"/&gt;

==Allegations: Communist fronts and Soviet espionage==
The Keeneys had a long list of political affiliations with alleged "[[Communist front]]s" such as the Washington Book Shop,&lt;ref name="Robert Justin Goldstein"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/116504.html |title=Review of The Librarian Spies: Philip and Mary Jane Keeney and Cold War Espionage -- By Rosalee McReynolds and Louise S.

In 1940, "Keeney and his wife were signed on apparently by the Neighbors,"&amp;mdash;code name for [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military intelligence ([[GRU]])&amp;mdash;according to a 1944 report by [[NKVD]] agent Sergey Kurnikov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America |last=Haynes |first=John Earl |authorlink=John Earl Haynes |author2=Harvey Klehr |year=2000 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0-300-08462-5 |page=179 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dIsmm_ZLHcIC |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government work==
Despite Keeney's radical political views, activities in several "popular front" groups and socialization with numerous people involved in [[USSR|Soviet]] [[espionage]] activities, both he and his wife were able to obtain a variety of federal jobs between 1940 and 1947. Within months of the PLC's endorsement of MacLeish for Librarian of Congress, Keeney was working at the [[Library of Congress]] in [[Washington D.C.]],&lt;ref name="McReynolds Winter 1990/91"/&gt; where he handled classified material.&lt;ref name="United States House of Representatives 3–4 PDF pp. 9–10"&gt;{{cite book |title=Annual Report, 1949 |last=United States House of Representatives |first=Committee on Un-American Activities |authorlink=Committee on Un-American Activities |date=March 15, 1950 |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington |pages=3–4 (PDF pp. 9–10) |url=https://archive.org/details/annualreportfory1949unit |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NKVD]] agent [[Jacob Golos]] allegedly met with him there.

After the United States became involved in [[World War II]], Keeney transferred to the [[Office of the Coordinator of Information]], which was later transferred to the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS),&lt;ref name="Haynes 2000 178"/&gt; precursor of the [[CIA]]. In a 1942 Venona cable discussing infiltration of OSS, "Maksim" (''Rezident'' Vasily Zarubin, under cover as "Vasily Zubilin") in New York wrote to "Victor" (General [[Pavel Fitin]], head of [[NKVD]] foreign intelligence) in [[Moscow]], "KINI is being entrusted to our agentura,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/venona/1942/22may_european_assets.pdf KGB 726-729 New York to Moscow 22 May 1942], p. 5 (National Security Agency)&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that recruitment was being undertaken.&lt;ref name="Haynes 2000 178–179"&gt;{{cite book |title=Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America |last=Haynes |first=John Earl |authorlink=John Earl Haynes |author2=Harvey Klehr |year=2000 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0-300-08462-5 |pages=178–179 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dIsmm_ZLHcIC |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A note from U.S. cryptographers states "KINI: If correct, probably Philip Olin KEENEY."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/venona/1942/22may_european_assets.pdf KGB 726-729 New York to Moscow 22 May 1942], p. 7 (National Security Agency)&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1943 to 1945, Keeney was Chief of the Document Security Section in the [[Foreign Economic Administration]]. His wife, meanwhile, worked in the Bureau of Economic Warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Annual Report, 1949 |last=United States House of Representatives |first=Committee on Un-American Activities |authorlink=Committee on Un-American Activities |date=March 15, 1950 |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington |page=4 (PDF p. 10) |url=https://archive.org/details/annualreportfory1949unit |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, Keeney was allegedly transferred from the GRU to the [[NKVD]].&lt;ref name="Haynes 2000 178–179"/&gt;

In late 1945 he was hired as a social science researcher in the Supreme Command for the Allied Powers (SCAP) in Tokyo in occupied [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Interlocking subversion in government departments
 |last=United States Senate |first=Committee on the Judiciary |authorlink=United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary |year=1953 |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |page=37 |url=https://archive.org/download/interlockingsubv1953unit/interlockingsubv1953unit_bw.pdf |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, designated "Libraries Officer" in the SCAP Civil Information and Education Section, he played an important role in promoting the revival and reform of library services in Japan. He negotiated the return of library buildings requisitioned by the Military Government and fostered the renewal of the Japan Library Association. His memorandum "Unified Library Services for Japan" of 8 April 1946 (aka The Keeney Plan) &lt;ref&gt;[http://editorsnotes.org/projects/japanese_librarianship/documents/18191/]&lt;/ref&gt; was a set of recommendations based on the California County Library System and stimulated discussion of new library legislation but was very incompletely reflected in the eventual Library Law of 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://editorsnotes.org/projects/japanese_librarianship/documents/18190/]&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife worked in France for the Allied Staff on Reparations.&lt;ref name="Haynes 2000 178"/&gt; Both Keeneys had numerous contacts with [[Russians|Russian]] agents and sought to provide them with information, exerting "considerable effort" seeking to "contribute something of value to the Soviet cause in which they believed..."&lt;ref name="Robert Justin Goldstein"/&gt;

==Investigations==
In 1942 J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, demanded that Keeney be fired from the Library of Congress as a subversive. After investigating the Librarian, Archibald MacLeish, concluded that there was no evidence to support the charge and, when challenged, Hoover did not provide any and Keeney was retained.&lt;ref&gt;Verner W. Clapp letter to P. O. Keeney, Dec 7, 1942. In Philip Olin Keeney Papers.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, the [[State Department]] prepared a Top Secret chart identifying 124 loyalty or security cases on the department payroll. Later that year, State Department official Samuel Klaus prepared a 106-page confidential memo summarizing security data on each of the cases listed on the chart. One of these was Mary Jane Keeney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Blacklisted by History: The Untold Story of Senator Joe McCarthy and His Fight Against America's Enemies |last=Evans |first=M. Stanton |authorlink=M. Stanton Evans |year=2007 |publisher=Crown Forum |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4000-8105-9 |pages=45–46, 152–154 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vz42rDYmf3wC |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1946 congressional report named Keeney's wife, and in 1947 both lost their federal jobs and were denied passports. Within three months, Keeney attempted to leave the country without a valid passport, on the same Polish ship on which [[Comintern]] agent [[Gerhart Eisler|Gerhardt Eisler]] had escaped to the [[East bloc]]; the lawyer who encouraged him in this unsuccessful attempt to leave the country was Eisler's attorney.&lt;ref name="United States House of Representatives 3–4 PDF pp. 9–10"/&gt;

During the [[Judith Coplon]] spy trial that year, FBI surveillance records were published that implicated Keeney's wife as a courier for the [[CPUSA|Communist Party]], observed upon her return from France in 1946 delivering a manila envelope to [[Joseph Milton Bernstein|Bernstein]], which he in turn delivered to [[Alexander Trachtenberg]]. Mary Jane herself admitted associating with [[Nathan Gregory Silvermaster]] and [[William Ludwig Ullmann]]. In 1949, Keeney was a sponsor of the National Conference on American Policy in China and the Far East and the Scientific and Cultural Conference for World Peace, both arranged by the National Council of the Arts, Sciences, and Professions, cited as subversive by the California Committee on Un-American Activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Review of the Scientific and Cultural Conference for World Peace |last=Committee on Un-American Activities |first=U.S. House of Representatives |authorlink=Committee on Un-American Activities |year=1948 |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington |pages=24, 58 (PDF 26, 60) |url=http://keywiki.org/files/sccwp-cuaa-1949.pdf |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite all this, by the following year, Mary Jane was working in the Document Control Section of the United Nations secretariat.&lt;ref name="United States House of Representatives 3–4 PDF pp. 9–10"/&gt;

After Sen. [[Joseph McCarthy]] publicized this in his 1950 speech in [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]], [[West Virginia]], she was dismissed.&lt;ref name="Robert Justin Goldstein"/&gt; The Keeneys refused to answer questions regarding membership in the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="United States House of Representatives 3–4 PDF pp. 9–10"/&gt; In 1952, they were convicted on contempt of [[United States Congress|Congress]] for refusing to answer questions before a [[United States Senate|Senate]] committee, though their convictions were later reversed on appeal.&lt;ref name="Haynes 2000 178"/&gt;

==Later life==
In their later years, the Keeneys are variously reported to have founded and run a cinema club in Washington, D.C. between 1952 and 1958, showing art films, and reportedly opened a beatnik theatre in [[Greenwich Village]] called Club Cinema to air mostly foreign-language films with subtitles, with occasional folksingers or poetry readings.&lt;ref name="McReynolds Winter 1990/91"/&gt; Keeney died in 1962 at the age of 71. He was survived by his wife.

==Venona==
After the [[National Security Agency]] declassified the [[Venona project]] in 1995, John Earl Haynes, [[Cold War]] historian in the Manuscript Division of the [[Library of Congress]], identified Philip Keeney with the code name "Bredan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.johnearlhaynes.org/page66.html |title=Cover Name, Cryptonym, Pseudonym, and Real Name Index: A Research Historian's Working Reference |author=John Earl Haynes |date=April 2009 |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rosalind Mary Mitchison''' [[FRSE]] (11 April 1919 &amp;ndash; 19 September 2002) was a 20th-century British [[historian]] who specialised in Scottish [[social history]]. She was affectionately known as "Rowy" Mitchison.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/oct/04/guardianobituaries.obituaries&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Rosalind Mary Wrong was born in [[Manchester]]. Her father, [[Edward Murray Wrong]], and his father, [[George MacKinnon Wrong]], were both historians.  Her brother was [[Oliver Wrong]].  

She was educated at [[Dragon School]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/oct/04/guardianobituaries.obituaries&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Oxford]] then studied history at [[Lady Margaret Hall]] and went to [[Manchester University]] as an assistant lecturer, working under Sir [[Lewis Namier]], in 1943. 

In 1953 her husband was appointed to a professorship at [[Edinburgh University]] and the Mitchisons moved to Scotland. Rosalind Mitchison taught history, initially part-time, at Edinburgh until 1957. In 1962 she began teaching at [[Glasgow University]] where she remained until 1967, latterly as a full-time lecturer. Her first work, ''Agricultural Sir John'' (1962), broke new ground in the history of 18th century Scotland, hitherto mainly studied, when studied at all, from the perspective of the [[Acts of Union 1707]] or the [[Scottish Enlightenment]].

She returned to Edinburgh in 1967 as a [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]], and was by 1981 ''[[Emeritus Professor]] of Social History'', a post she held until 1986.

In 1994 she was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. Her proposers were [[T. C. Smout]], D Stevenson, [[T. M. Devine]], [[Michael Francis Oliver]], [[Charles Kemball]] and [[D. E. R. Watt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She died in hospital in [[Edinburgh]] on 20 September 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/prof-rosalind-mitchison-1-622741&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

In 1947, while Tutor at [[Lady Margaret Hall]], she married [[zoologist]] [[John Murdoch Mitchison]], son of [[Naomi Mitchison]] and [[Gilbert Mitchison, Baron Mitchison|Dick Mitchison]]. They had four children, one son and three daughters.

A work [[slowdown]], characterized by some writers as the Skylab strike, was instigated by the crew of [[Skylab 4]] during some or all of December 28, 1973—the last of the U.S. [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]'s [[Skylab]] missions.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Broad|first=William J.|title=On Edge in Outer Space?

Man-hours in space was, and continued to be into the 21st century, a profoundly expensive undertaking; a single day on Skylab was worth about $22.4 million in 2017 dollars, and thus any work stoppage was considered inappropriate due to the expense.&lt;ref name="lafleur20100308"/&gt; The incident affected the planning of future space missions, especially long-term missions.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Background and causes==
Behavioral problems during a spaceflight are of concern to mission planners because they can cause a mission to fail.&lt;ref name="AutoFP-2"/&gt; NASA has studied matters that affect crew social dynamics such as [[morale]], [[stress management]], and how the crew solves problems as a group with missions like [[HI-SEAS]].&lt;ref name="AutoFP-3"/&gt; Each Skylab pushed farther into the unknown of space medicine, and it was difficult to make predictions about the reaction of the human body to prolonged weightlessness.&lt;ref name="sen.com"/&gt; The first manned Skylab mission set a spaceflight record with its 28-day mission, and Skylab 3 roughly doubled that to 59 days; no one had spent this long in orbit.&lt;ref name="sen.com"/&gt;

Possible contributing factors to the incident include:
* Twelve-week length of stay (the longest stay yet attempted by astronauts up to that time)
* Isolated environment
* Design of the spacecraft
* Microgravity environment
* Workload expectations of Skylab team
* Workload expectations of mission control
* Crew inexperience (all first-time astronauts)
* No transition period

Three three-man crews spent progressively longer amounts of time (28, 60, and then 84 days), launched to orbit by the [[Saturn IB]] and flying the [[Apollo CSM]] spacecraft to the station.&lt;ref name="motherboard.vice.com"/&gt; It was visited by three three-man crews, and the incident occurred on this last all-rookie mission, which was also the longest.&lt;ref name="armaghplanet.com"/&gt;

[[Skylab 3]] had finished all their work and asked for more work{{mdash}}this may have led NASA to have a higher expectation for the next crew.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; However, the next crew were all "rookies" (they had not been in space before) and may not have had the same concept of workload as the previous crew.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Both previous crews had veteran members and both previous crews had one member that had been to the Moon and back.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Another factor was that the rookie astronauts were in denial about their problems and hid the issues they were having with mission control, leading to even higher mental strain.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; The crew increasingly became bothered by having every hour of their trip duration scheduled.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hollingham|first=Richard|title=How the Most Expensive Structure in the World was Built|publisher=[[BBC]]|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20151221-how-the-most-expensive-structure-in-the-world-was-built|date=December 21, 2015|accessdate=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event==
NASA had continued with a workload similar to that on the shorter Skylab 3,&lt;ref name="Clément"/&gt; and the crew gradually fell behind on their workload. According to some, after six weeks the crew announced a "strike" and turned off all communication with ground control for December 28, 1973.&lt;ref name="Hiltzik"/&gt;{{rs?|date=November 2018}} To date, no evidence of this announcement has been located in mission transcripts or audio recordings of the flight.

The three men are alleged to have stopped work; Gibson spent the day on Skylab's solar console, and Carr and Pogue spent the time in the wardroom looking out of the window.&lt;ref name="NYer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cooper|first=Henry S. F.|authorlink=Henry S. F. Cooper Jr.|title=Life in a Space Station|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1976/09/06/life-in-a-space-station-ii|date=August 30, 1976|accessdate=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rs?|date=November 2018}}

Spaceflight history author [[David Hitt]] disputed that the crew purposefully ended contact with mission control in a book written along with former astronauts [[Owen K. Garriott]] and [[Joseph P. Kerwin]].&lt;ref name="HS"/&gt;

==Effects==
At a time when nobody had spent six weeks in space, it was not known what had happened psychologically. NASA carefully worked with crew's requests, reducing their workload for the next six weeks. The incident took NASA into an unknown realm of concern in the selection of astronauts, still a question as humanity considers human missions to Mars or returning to the Moon.&lt;ref name="AutoFP-4"/&gt;

After the incident, there were many attempts to either determine the cause or downplay what happened.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Nevertheless, lessons learned focused on balancing workload with crew psychology and stress level.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; One factor that affects disaster planning is the process of lessons learned from past incidents.&lt;ref name="James Oberg's Pioneering Space"/&gt; Two contrasting pressures are the desire to hide a problem to avoid issues such as reprimands versus the honest evaluation of the issue to prevent future occurrences.&lt;ref name="James Oberg's Pioneering Space"/&gt;

Among the complicating factors was the interplay between management and subordinates (see also [[Apollo 1]] fire and [[Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' disaster]]). On Skylab 4, one problem was that the crew was pushed even harder as they fell behind on their workload, creating an increasing level of stress.&lt;ref name="AutoFP-5"/&gt; Even though none of the astronauts returned to space, there was only one more NASA spaceflight in the decade and Skylab was the first and last all-American space station.&lt;ref name="armaghplanet.com"/&gt; NASA was planning larger space stations but its budget shrank considerably after the Moon landings, and the Skylab orbital workshop was the only major execution of Apollo application projects.&lt;ref name="armaghplanet.com"/&gt;

Though the final Skylab mission became known for the incident, it was also known for the large amount of work that was accomplished in the long mission.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Skylab orbited for six more years before decaying in 1979 due to higher-than-anticipated solar activity.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; The next U.S. spaceflight was the [[Apollo–Soyuz Test Project]] conducted in July 1975, and after a human spaceflight gap, the first Space Shuttle orbital flight [[STS-1]].

The described events were considered a significant example of "us" versus "them" syndrome in space medicine.&lt;ref name="Clément"/&gt; Crew psychology has been a point of study for Mars analog missions such as [[Mars-500]], with a particular focus on crew behavior triggering a mission failure or other issues.&lt;ref name="Clément"/&gt; One of the impacts of the incident is the requirement that at least one member of the International Space Station crew be a space veteran (not be on a first flight).&lt;ref name="AutoFP-6"/&gt;

The 84-day stay of the Skylab 4 mission was a human spaceflight record that was not exceeded for over two decades by a NASA astronaut;&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; the 96-day Soviet [[Salyut 6 EO-1]] mission broke Skylab 4's record in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/world/russia/soyuz_26_27_series.htm|title=Soyuz 26 and Soyuz 27|last=Pike|first=John|website=www.globalsecurity.org|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- quotes

{{quote|The Skylab 4 experience raises a number of issues. The first is identifying an optimal balance between work and nonwork activities for missions of varying lengths. To reduce the threat of overprogramming, mission planners and managers, first, might maintain a high degree of sensitivity to the socioemotional requirements of prolonged space flights. Second, planners and managers might incorporate principles or organizational self-design by further involving experienced astronauts in the planning of tasks and activities and by incorporating scheduling flexibility so that crews can readily modify their timetables on the basis of conditions encountered in space. Third, it might prove useful to conduct a path analysis of attitudes toward supplies, equipment, and living conditions on the one hand, and attitudes toward mission planners and managers on the other. It is not clear whether opinions regarding supplies and equipment are causes of, or symptoms of, spacecrew/mission-control conflicts. | Excerpt from NASA book SP-483 ''LIVING ALOFT: Human Requirements for Extended Spaceflight''&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-483/ch8-4.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A '''social movement''' is a type of [[Group action (sociology)|group action]]&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, A., 2016. Processual sociology. Chicago,IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Social movements can be defined as "organizational structures and strategies that may empower oppressed populations to mount effective challenges and resist the more powerful and advantaged elites".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political sociology : oppression, resistance, and the state|last=Deric.|first=Shannon|date=2011-01-01|publisher=Pine Forge Press|isbn=9781412980401|oclc=746832550|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are large, sometimes informal, groupings of [[individual]]s or [[organization]]s which focus on specific [[politics|political]] or [[social issue]]s&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018.

In other words, they carry out, resist, or undo a [[social change]]. They provide a way of social change from the bottom within nations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Modern Western social movements became possible through education (the wider dissemination of [[literature]]) and increased mobility of labor due to the [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]] of 19th-century societies.&lt;ref name=w2013&gt;Weinberg, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes argued that the freedom of expression, education and relative economic independence prevalent in the modern [[Western culture]] are responsible for the unprecedented number and scope of various contemporary social movements. However, others point out that many of the social movements of the last hundred years grew up, like the [[Mau Mau]] in Kenya, to oppose Western colonialism. Either way, social movements have been and continued to be closely connected with [[democracy|democratic]] [[political system]]s. Occasionally, social movements have been involved in [[democratization|democratizing]] nations, but more often they have flourished after democratization. Over the past 200 years, they have become part of a popular and global expression of [[dissent]].&lt;ref name=t2004&gt;Tilly, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern movements often utilize technology and the internet to mobilize people globally. Adapting to communication trends is a common theme among successful movements.&lt;ref name="Advocacy 2.0" /&gt; Research is beginning to explore how advocacy organizations linked to social movements in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Advocacy 2.0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Obar|first=Jonathan|title=Advocacy 2.0: An Analysis of How Advocacy Groups in the United States Perceive and Use Social Media as Tools for Facilitating Civic Engagement and Collective Action|journal=Journal of Information Policy|year=2012|ssrn=1956352|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Canada&lt;ref name="Obar"&gt;{{cite web|last=Obar|first=Jonathan|title=Canadian Advocacy 2.0: A Study of Social Media Use by Social Movement Groups and Activists in Canada|ssrn=2254742|date=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; use [[social media]] to facilitate civic engagement and collective action.

[[Political science]] and [[sociology]] have developed a variety of theories and empirical research on social movements. For example, some research in political science highlights the relation between popular movements and the formation of new [[political party|political parties]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pugh|first=Jeff|date=2008|title=Vectors of Contestation: Social Movements and Party Systems in Ecuador and Colombia|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270512275|journal=Latin American Essays|volume=XXI|pages=46–65|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as discussing the function of social movements in relation to [[Agenda-setting theory|agenda setting]] and influence on politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Party &amp; society : reconstructing a sociology of democratic party politics|last=de|first=Leon, Cedric|isbn=9780745653686|oclc=856053908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
There is no single consensus definition of a social movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Opp|first1=Karl-Dieter|title=. Theories of political protest and social movements: A multidisciplinary introduction, critique, and synthesis|date=2009|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mario Diani argues that nearly all definitions share three criteria: "a network of informal interactions between a plurality of individuals, groups and/or organizations, engaged in a political or cultural conflict, on the basis of a shared collective identity" &lt;ref name="Diani1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diani|first1=Mario|title=The concept of social movement|journal=The Sociological Review|volume=40|issue=1|year=1992|pages=1–25|issn=0038-0261|doi=10.1111/j.1467-954X.1992.tb02943.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Charles Tilly]] defines social movements as a series of contentious performances, displays and campaigns by which ordinary people make collective claims on others.&lt;ref name=t2004/&gt; For Tilly, social movements are a major vehicle for ordinary people's participation in public politics.&lt;ref name=t2004-3&gt;Tilly, 2004, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that there are three major elements to a social movement:&lt;ref name=t2004/&gt;

# '''Campaigns''': a sustained, organized public effort making collective claims of target authorities;
# '''Repertoire''' ([[repertoire of contention]]): employment of combinations from among the following forms of [[political action]]: creation of special-purpose associations and coalitions, public meetings, solemn processions, vigils, rallies, demonstrations, petition drives, statements to and in public media, and pamphleteering; and
# '''WUNC displays''': participants' concerted public representation of '''w'''orthiness, '''u'''nity, '''n'''umbers, and '''c'''ommitments on the part of themselves and/or their constituencies.

[[Sidney Tarrow]] defines a social movement as "collective challenges [to elites, authorities, other groups or cultural codes] by people with common purposes and solidarity in sustained interactions with elites, opponents and authorities." He specifically distinguishes social movements from political parties and [[advocacy group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tarrow, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The sociologists John McCarthy and Mayer Zald define as a social movement as "a set of opinions and beliefs in a population which represents preferences for changing some elements of the social structure and/or reward distribution of a society." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCarthy|first1=John|last2=Zald|first2=Mayer N.|title=Resource Mobilization and Social Movements: A Partial Theory|journal=The American Journal of Sociology|date=May 1977|volume=82|issue=6|pages=1217–1218|doi=10.1086/226464|jstor=2777934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Paul van Seeters and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] defining a social movement entails a few minimal conditions of ‘coming together’: 
{{quote|(1.) the formation of some kind of collective identity; (2.) the development of a shared normative orientation; (3.) the sharing of a concern for change of the status quo and (4.) the occurrence of moments of practical action that are at least subjectively connected together across time addressing this concern for change. Thus we define a social movement as a form of political association between persons who have at least a minimal sense of themselves as connected to others in common purpose and who come together across an extended period of time to effect social change in the name of that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2014 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= van Seeters | first2= Paul | title= Globalization and Politics, Vol. 2: Global Social Movements and Global Civil Society | url= https://www.academia.edu/7305007 | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London |page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The early growth of social movements was connected to broad economic and political changes in England in the mid-18th century, including [[political representation]], [[market capitalization]], and [[proletarianization]].&lt;ref name=t2004/&gt; The first mass social movement catalyzed around the controversial political figure, [[John Wilkes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/51006/232.pdf?...1|title=BRITAIN CREATES THE SOCIAL MOVEMENT|author=Charles Tilly}}&lt;/ref&gt; As editor of the paper ''[[The North Briton]]'', Wilkes vigorously attacked the new administration of [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]] and the peace terms that the new government accepted at the 1763 [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] at the end of the [[Seven Years' War]]. Charged with [[seditious libel]], Wilkes was arrested after the issue of a [[general warrant]], a move that Wilkes denounced as unlawful - the [[Lord Chief Justice]] eventually ruled in Wilkes favour. As a result of this episode, Wilkes became a figurehead to the growing movement for popular sovereignty among the middle classes - people began chanting, "Wilkes and Liberty" in the streets.

After a later period of exile, brought about by further charges of libel and [[obscenity]], Wilkes stood for the Parliamentary seat at [[Middlesex (UK Parliament constituency)|Middlesex]], where most of his support was located.{{Sfn|Cash|2006|pp=204–26}} When Wilkes was imprisoned in the [[King's Bench Prison]] on 10 May 1768, a mass movement of support emerged, with large demonstrations in the streets under the slogan "No liberty, no King."{{Sfn|Cash|2006|pp=216–26}} Stripped of the right to sit in Parliament, Wilkes became an [[Alderman]] of [[City of London|London]] in 1769, and an activist group called the ''Society for the Supporters of the Bill of Rights'' began aggressively promoting his policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyhome.co.uk/c-eight/18reform/ssbr.htm|title=The Society for the Supporters of the Bill of Rights (SSBR)|website=www.historyhome.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first ever sustained social movement; -it involved public meetings, demonstrations, the distribution of pamphlets on an unprecedented scale and the mass petition march. However, the movement was careful not to cross the line into open rebellion; - it tried to rectify the faults in governance through appeals to existing legal precedents and was conceived of as an extra-Parliamentary form of agitation to arrive at a consensual and constitutional arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Popular sovereignty and the historical origin of the social movement | doi=10.1007/s11186-012-9180-x | volume=41|issue=6 |journal=Theory and Society|pages=581–601 | last1 = Rudbeck | first1 = Jens|year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The force and influence of this social movement on the streets of London compelled the authorities to concede to the movement's demands. Wilkes was returned to Parliament, [[general warrant]]s were declared as unconstitutional and press freedom was extended to the coverage of [[Parliamentary debate]]s.

[[File:The Gordon Riots by John Seymour Lucas.jpg|left|thumb|230px|The Gordon Riots, depicted in a painting by [[John Seymour Lucas]]]]
A much larger movement of [[anti-Catholic]] protest was triggered by the [[Papists Act 1778]], which eliminated a number of the penalties and disabilities endured by [[Roman Catholicism in England and Wales|Roman Catholics in England]], and formed around [[Lord George Gordon]], who became the President of the [[Protestant Association]] in 1779.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=Printed by W.

The situation deteriorated rapidly, and in 1780, after a meeting of the Protestant Association, its members subsequently marched on the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]] to deliver a petition demanding the repeal of the Act, which the government refused to do. Soon, [[Gordon riots|large riots]] broke out across London and embassies and Catholic owned businesses were attacked by angry mobs.

Other [[political movement]]s that emerged in the late 18th century included the British [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]] movement against [[slavery]] (becoming one between the sugar boycott of 1791 and the second great petition drive of 1806), and possibly the upheaval surrounding the [[French Revolution|French]] and [[American Revolution]]s. In the opinion of Eugene Black (1963), "...association made possible the extension of the politically effective public. Modern extra parliamentary political organization is a product of the late eighteenth century [and] the history of the age of reform cannot be written without it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0674050002|title=The Association British Extra Parliamentary Political Organization, 1769-1793|author=Eugene Charlton Black|year=1963|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth and spread===
[[File:Chartist meeting on Kennington Common by William Edward Kilburn 1848 - restoration1.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Great Chartist Meeting on [[Kennington Common]], London in 1848.]]
From 1815, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] after victory in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] entered a period of social upheaval characterised by the growing maturity of the use of social movements and special-interest associations. [[Chartism]] was the first mass movement of the growing working-class in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.counterfire.org/index.php/articles/75-our-history/12331-chartism-the-birth-of-mass-working-class-resistance|title=Chartism: the birth of mass working class resistance |accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It campaigned for political reform between 1838 and 1848 with the [[Chartism#People's Charter of 1838|People's Charter of 1838]] as its manifesto – this called for [[universal suffrage]] and the implementation of the [[secret ballot]], amongst other things. The term "social movements" was introduced in 1848 by the German Sociologist [[Lorenz von Stein]] in his book ''Socialist and Communist Movements since the Third French Revolution (1848)'' in which he introduced the term "social movement" into scholarly discussions&lt;ref&gt;Tilly, 2004, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; - actually depicting in this way [[political movement]]s fighting for the social rights understood as [[welfare rights]].

[[Image:Martin Luther King - March on Washington.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Martin Luther King Jr.]] was a leader in the [[Civil Rights Movement]], one of the most famous social movements of the 20th century.]]
The [[labor movement]] and [[socialist movement]] of the late 19th century are seen as the prototypical social movements, leading to the formation of [[communism|communist]] and [[social democracy|social democratic]] parties and organisations. These tendencies were seen in poorer countries as pressure for reform continued, for example in Russia with the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] and [[Russian Revolution of 1917|of 1917]], resulting in the collapse of the Czarist regime around the end of the [[World War I|First World War]].

In 1945, Britain after victory in the [[World War II|Second World War]] entered a period of radical reform and change. In the post-war period, [[Feminism]], [[gay rights movement]], [[peace movement]], [[Civil Rights Movement]], [[anti-nuclear movement]] and [[environmental movement]] emerged, often dubbed the [[New Social Movements]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Westd|first1=David|title=New Social Movements|journal=Handbook of Political Theory|date=2004|url=http://www.omnilogos.com/2015/02/new-social-movements.html|access-date=2015-02-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215161004/http://www.omnilogos.com/2015/02/new-social-movements.html|archive-date=2015-02-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They led, among other things, to the formation of [[green parties]] and organisations influenced by the [[new left]]. Some find in the end of the 1990s the emergence of a new global social movement, the [[anti-globalization movement]]. Some social movement scholars posit that with the rapid pace of globalization, the potential for the emergence of new ''type'' of social movement is latent—they make the analogy to national movements of the past to describe what has been termed a [[global citizens movement]].

===Key processes===
Several key processes lie behind the history of social movements. [[Urbanization]] led to larger settlements, where people of similar goals could find each other, gather and organize. This facilitated [[social interaction]] between scores of people, and it was in urban areas that those early social movements first appeared. Similarly, the process of industrialization which gathered large masses of workers in the same region explains why many of those early social movements addressed matters such as economic wellbeing, important to the [[worker class]]. Many other social movements were created at [[university|universities]], where the process of [[mass education]] brought many people together. With the development of [[communication]] technologies, creation and activities of social movements became easier – from printed pamphlets circulating in the 18th century [[coffeehouse]]s to [[newspaper]]s and [[Internet]], all those tools became important factors in the growth of the social movements. Finally, the spread of [[democracy]] and [[political rights]] like the [[freedom of speech]] made the creation and functioning of social movements much easier.

== Mass Mobilization ==
Nascent social movements often fail to achieve their objectives because they fail to mobilize sufficient numbers of people. Srdja Popovic, author of Blueprint for Revolution,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Blueprint for revolution : how to use rice pudding, Lego men, and other nonviolent techniques to galvanize communities, overthrow dictators, or simply change the world|last=1973-|first=Popovic, Srdja|others=Miller, Matthew I., 1979-|isbn=9780812995305|edition=First|location=New York|oclc=878500820|year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spokesperson for [[Otpor!|OTPOR!]], says that movements succeed when they address issues that people actually care about. “It’s unrealistic to expect people to care about more than what they already care about, and any attempt to make them do so is bound to fail.” Activists too often make the mistake of trying to convince people to address their issues. A mobilization strategy aimed at large-scale change often begins with action a small issue that concerns many people. For instance, [[Mahatma Gandhi]]’s successful overthrow of British rule in India began as a small protest focused on the British tax on salt.

Popovic also argues that a social movement has little chance of growing if it relies on boring speeches and the usual placard waving marches. He argues for creating movements that people actually want to join. OTPOR! succeeded because it was fun, funny, and invented graphic ways of ridiculing dictator [[Slobodan Milošević|Slobodan Milosevic]]. It turned fatalism and passivity into action by making it easy, even cool, to become a revolutionary; branding itself within hip slogans, rock music and street theatre. [[Tina Rosenberg]], in Join the Club, How Peer Pressure can Transform the World,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Join the club : how peer pressure can transform the world|last=Tina.|first=Rosenberg|date=2011|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co|isbn=9780393068580|edition=1st|location=New York|oclc=601108086}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows how movements grow when there is a core of enthusiastic players who encourage others to join them.

== Types of social movement ==
[[Image:Types of social movements.svg|right|thumb|400px|Types of social movements.&lt;ref&gt;Aberle, David F. 1966. ''The Peyote Religion among the Navaho''. Chicago: Aldine. {{ISBN|0-8061-2382-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Sociologists distinguish between several types of social movement:
* Scope:
** [[reform movement]] - movements advocating changing some [[norm (sociology)|norms]] or [[law]]s. Examples of such a movement would include a [[trade union]] with a goal of increasing [[workers rights]], a [[green movement]] advocating a set of [[ecology|ecological]] laws, or a movement supporting introduction of a [[capital punishment]] or the right to [[abortion]]. Some reform movements may aim for a change in custom and moral norms, such as condemnation of [[pornography]] or proliferation of some [[religion]].
** radical movement - movements dedicated to changing [[value system]]s in a fundamental way. Examples would include the [[Civil Rights Movement]] which demanded full [[civil rights]] and equality under the law to all Americans, regardless of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]; the [[Poland|Polish]] [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] (''Solidarność'') movement which demanded the transformation of a [[Stalinist]] political and [[economic system]] into a [[democracy]]; or the [[South Africa]]n [[shack dweller]]s' movement [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] which demands the full inclusion of shack dwellers into the life of cities.
* Type of change:
** innovation movement - movements which want to introduce or change particular norms, values, etc. The [[singularitarianism]] movement advocating deliberate action to effect and ensure the safety of the [[technological singularity]] is an example of an innovation movement.
** conservative movement - movements which want to preserve existing norms, values, etc. For example, the anti-technology 19th century [[Luddite]]s movement or the modern movement opposing the spread of the [[genetically modified food]] could be seen as conservative movements in that they aimed to fight specific technological changes.
* Targets:
** group-focus movements - focused on affecting groups or society in general, for example, advocating the change of the political system. Some of these groups transform into or join a [[political party]], but many remain outside the reformist party political system.
** individual-focused movements - focused on affecting individuals. Most [[religious movement]]s would fall under this category.
* Methods of work:
** peaceful movements - various movements which use [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] means of protest as part of a campaign of [[nonviolent resistance]], also often called [[civil resistance]]. The American Civil Rights movement, Polish Solidarity movement or the [[nonviolent]], [[civil disobedience]]-orientated wing of the [[Indian independence movement]] would fall into this category.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Roberts, Adam]] and [[Timothy Garton Ash]] (eds.), [http://www.oup.com/uk/catalogue/?ci=9780199552016 ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present''] {{webarchive|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20141115183530/http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199552016.do |date=2014-11-15 }}, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-19-955201-6}}, contains chapters on these and many other social movements using non-violent methods.[https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s]&lt;/ref&gt;
** violent movements - various movements which resort to violence; they are usually armed and in extreme cases can take a form of a [[paramilitary]] or [[terrorist]] organization. Examples: the [[Rote Armee Fraktion]], [[Al-Qaida]].
* Old and new:
** old movements - movements for change have existed for many centuries. Most of the oldest recognized movements, dating to late 18th and 19th centuries, fought for specific social groups, such as the working class, peasants, whites, aristocrats, Protestants, men. They were usually centered around some [[materialism|materialistic]] goals like improving the [[standard of living]] or, for example, the political autonomy of the working class.
** [[new social movements|new movements]] - movements which became dominant from the second half of the 20th century. Notable examples include the [[civil rights movement|American civil rights movement]], [[second-wave feminism]], [[gay rights movement]], [[environmental movement|environmentalism and conservation efforts]], [[Mass surveillance|opposition to mass surveillance]], etc. They are usually centered around issues that go beyond but are not separate from class.
* Range:
** global movements - social movements with global ([[International|transnational]]) objectives and goals. Movements such as the [[International Workingmen's Association|first]] (where Marx and Bakunin met), [[Second International|second]], [[Comintern|third]] and [[fourth international]]s, the [[World Social Forum]], the [[Peoples' Global Action]] and the [[anarchism|anarchist movement]] seek to change society at a global level.
** local movements - most of the social movements have a local scope.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, David A., Sarah Anne Soule, Hanspeter Kriesi. ''The Blackwell companion to social movements''. Wiley-Blackwell. 2004. {{ISBN|0-631-22669-9}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=6ACcrTbUuEUC&amp;pg=PA4 Google Print, p.4]&lt;/ref&gt; They are focused on local or regional objectives, such as protecting a specific natural area, lobbying for the lowering of tolls in a certain motorway, or preserving a building about to be demolished for gentrification and turning it into a [[social center]].

==Identification of supporters==
A difficulty for scholarship of movements is that for most of them, neither insiders to a movement nor outsiders apply consistent labels or even descriptive phrases. Unless there is a single leader who does that, or a formal system of membership agreements, activists will typically use diverse labels and descriptive phrases that require scholars to discern when they are referring to the same or similar ideas, declare similar goals, adopt similar programs of action, and use similar methods. There can be great differences in the way that is done, to recognize who is and who is not a member or an allied group:
* Insiders: Often exaggerate the level of support by considering people supporters whose level of activity or support is weak, but also reject those that outsiders might consider supporters because they discredit the cause, or are even seen as adversaries.
* Outsiders: Those not supporters who may tend to either underestimate or overestimate the level or support or activity of elements of a movement, by including or excluding those that insiders would exclude or include.

It is often outsiders rather than insiders that apply the identifying labels for a movement, which the insiders then may or may not adopt and use to self-identify. For example, the label for the [[levellers]] [[political movement]] in 17th-century England was applied to them by their antagonists, as a [[term of disparagement]]. Yet admirers of the movement and its aims later came to use the term, and it is the term by which they are known to history.

Caution must always be exercised in any discussion of amorphous phenomena such as movements to distinguish between the views of insiders and outsiders, supporters and antagonists, each of whom may have their own purposes and agendas in [[characterization]] or mischaracterization of it.

==Dynamics of social movements==
[[Image:Stages of social movements.svg|right|thumb|400px|Stages of social movements.&lt;ref&gt;Graph based on Blumer, Herbert G. 1969. "Collective Behavior." In Alfred McClung Lee, ed., ''Principles of Sociology''. Third Edition. New York: Barnes &amp; Noble Books, pp. 65-121; Mauss, Armand L. 1975. ''Social Problems as Social Movements''. Philadelphia: Lippincott; and Tilly, Charles. 1978. ''From Mobilization to Revolution''. Reading, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Social movements are not eternal. They have a life cycle: they are created, they grow, they achieve successes or failures and eventually, they dissolve and cease to exist.

They are more likely to evolve in the time and place which is friendly to the social movements: hence their evident symbiosis with the 19th century proliferation of ideas like individual rights, freedom of speech and civil disobedience. Social movements occur in liberal and authoritarian societies but in different forms. However, there must always be polarizing differences between groups of people: in case of 'old movements', they were the [[poverty]] and [[Economic inequality|wealth gaps]]. In case of the 'new movements', they are more likely to be the differences in customs, ethics and values. Finally, the birth of a social movement needs what sociologist [[Neil Smelser]] calls an ''initiating event'': a particular, individual event that will begin a [[chain reaction]] of events in the given society leading to the creation of a social movement. For example, the Civil Rights Movement grew on the reaction to black woman, [[Rosa Parks]], riding in the whites-only section of the bus (although she was not acting alone or spontaneously—typically activist leaders lay the groundwork behind the scenes of interventions designed to spark a movement). The Polish Solidarity movement, which eventually [[Revolutions of 1989|toppled the communist regimes of Eastern Europe]], developed after trade union activist [[Anna Walentynowicz]] was fired from work. The South African shack dwellers' movement [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] grew out of a road blockade in response to the sudden selling off of a small piece of land promised for housing to a developer. Such an event is also described as a ''volcanic model'' – a social movement is often created after a large number of people realize that there are others sharing the same value and desire for a particular social change.

One of the main difficulties facing the emerging social movement is spreading the very knowledge that it exists. Second is overcoming the [[free rider problem]] – convincing people to join it, instead of following the mentality 'why should I trouble myself when others can do it and I can just reap the benefits after their hard work'.

Many social movements are created around some [[charismatic leader]], i.e. one possessing [[charismatic authority]]. After the social movement is created, there are two likely phases of recruitment. The first phase will gather the people deeply interested in the primary goal and ideal of the movement. The second phase, which will usually come after the given movement had some successes and is trendy; it would look good on a [[résumé]]. People who join in this second phase will likely be the first to leave when the movement suffers any setbacks and failures.

Eventually, the social crisis can be encouraged by outside elements, like opposition from government or other movements. However, many movements had survived a failure crisis, being revived by some hardcore [[activist]]s even after several decades later.

==Social movement theories==
{{Main|Social movement theory}}
Sociologists have developed several [[Social movement theory|theories]] related to social movements [Kendall, 2005]. Some of the better-known approaches are outlined below. Chronologically they include:
* [[collective behavior]]/[[collective action]] theories (1950s)
* [[relative deprivation theory]] (1960s)
* [[marxist theory]] (1880s)
* [[value-added theory]] (1960s)
* [[resource mobilization]] (1970s)
* [[political process theory]] (1980s)
* [[Framing (social sciences)|framing theory]] (1980s) (closely related to [[social constructionist theory]])
* [[new social movement theory]] (1980s)

===Deprivation theory===
[[relative deprivation theory|Deprivation theory]] argues that social movements have their foundations among people who feel deprived of some good(s) or resource(s). According to this approach, individuals who are lacking some good, service, or comfort are more likely to organize a social movement to improve (or defend) their conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two significant problems with this theory. First, since most people feel deprived at one level or another almost all the time, the theory has a hard time explaining why the groups that form social movements do when other people are also deprived. Second, the reasoning behind this theory is circular – often the only evidence for deprivation is the social movement. If deprivation is claimed to be the cause but the only evidence for such is the movement, the reasoning is circular.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins and Perrow 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass society theory===
[[Mass society theory]] argues that social movements are made up of individuals in large societies who feel insignificant or socially detached. Social movements, according to this theory, provide a sense of empowerment and belonging that the movement members would otherwise not have.&lt;ref&gt;Kornhauser 1959&lt;/ref&gt;

Very little support has been found for this theory. Aho (1990), in his study of Idaho Christian Patriotism, did not find that members of that movement were more likely to have been socially detached. In fact, the key to joining the movement was having a friend or associate who was a member of the movement.

===Structural strain theory===
[[Strain theory (sociology)|Social strain theory]], also known as value-added theory, proposes six factors that encourage social movement development:&lt;ref&gt;Smelser 1962&lt;/ref&gt;
# structural conduciveness - people come to believe their society has problems
# [[structural strain]] - people experience deprivation
# growth and spread of a solution - a solution to the problems people are experiencing is proposed and spreads
# precipitating factors - discontent usually requires a catalyst (often a specific event) to turn it into a social movement
# lack of social control - the entity that is to be changed must be at least somewhat open to the change; if the social movement is quickly and powerfully repressed, it may never materialize
# mobilization - this is the actual organizing and active component of the movement; people do what needs to be done

This theory is also subject to circular reasoning as it incorporates, at least in part, deprivation theory and relies upon it, and social/structural strain for the underlying motivation of social movement activism. However, social movement activism is, like in the case of deprivation theory, often the only indication that there was strain or deprivation.

===Resource mobilization theory===
[[Resource mobilization theory]] emphasizes the importance of resources in social movement development and success. Resources are understood here to include: knowledge, money, media, labor, solidarity, legitimacy, and internal and external support from power elite. The theory argues that social movements develop when individuals with grievances are able to mobilize sufficient resources to take action.The emphasis on resources offers an explanation why some discontented/deprived individuals are able to organize while others are not.&lt;ref name=mccarthyzald&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCarthy|first1=John|last2=Zald|first2=Mayer N.|title=Resource Mobilization and Social Movements: a Partial Theory|journal=American Journal of Sociology|date=May 1977|volume=82|issue=6|pages=1212–1241|doi=10.1086/226464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to earlier [[collective behavior]] perspectives on social movements—which emphasized the role of exceptional levels of deprivation, grievance, or social strain in motivating mass protest—Resource Mobilization perspectives hold "that there is always enough discontent in any society to supply the grass-roots support for a movement if the movement is effectively organized and has at its disposal the power and resources of some established elite group" &lt;ref name=TurnerKillian&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=L.|last2=Killian|first2=R. N.|title=Collective Behavior|date=1972|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J|page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Movement emergence is contingent upon the aggregation of resources by social movement entrepreneurs and movement organizations, who use these resources to turn collective dissent in to political pressure.&lt;ref name=mccarthyzald/&gt;  Members are recruited through networks; commitment is maintained by building a collective identity, and through interpersonal relationships. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Resource Mobilization Theory views social movement activity as "politics by other means": a rational and strategic effort by ordinary people to change society or politics.&lt;ref name=gamson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gamson|first1=William A.|title=The Limits of Pluralism|journal=CRSO Working Papers|date=June 1974|issue=102|page=12|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/50879/102.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form of the resources shapes the activities of the movement (e.g., access to a TV station will result in the extensive use TV media). Movements develop in contingent ''opportunity structures'' that influence their efforts to mobilize; and each movement's response to the opportunity structures depends on the movement's organization and resources {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Critics of this theory argue that there is too much of an emphasis on resources, especially financial resources. Some movements are effective without an influx of money and are more dependent upon the movement members for time and labor (e.g., the civil rights movement in the U.S.). {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Political process theory===
[[Political process theory]] is similar to resource mobilization in many regards, but tends to emphasize a different component of [[social structure]] that is important for social movement development: [[political opportunities]]. Political process theory argues that there are three vital components for movement formation: insurgent consciousness, organizational strength, and political opportunities.

Insurgent consciousness refers back to the ideas of deprivation and grievances. The idea is that certain members of society feel like they are being mistreated or that somehow the system is unjust. The insurgent consciousness is the collective sense of injustice that movement members (or potential movement members) feel and serves as the motivation for movement organization.

[[Image:J20 democracy dc.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Photo taken at the 2005 U.S. Presidential inauguration protest.]]

Organizational strength falls inline with resource-mobilization theory, arguing that in order for a social movement to organize it must have strong leadership and sufficient resources.

Political opportunity refers to the receptivity or vulnerability of the existing political system to challenge. This vulnerability can be the result of any of the following (or a combination thereof):
* growth of political pluralism
* decline in effectiveness of repression
* elite disunity; the leading factions are internally fragmented
* a broadening of access to institutional participation in political processes
* support of organized opposition by elites

One of the advantages of the political process theory is that it addresses the issue of timing or emergence of social movements. Some groups may have the insurgent consciousness and resources to mobilize, but because political opportunities are closed, they will not have any success. The theory, then, argues that all three of these components are important.

Critics of the political process theory and resource-mobilization theory point out that neither theory discusses movement culture to any great degree. This has presented culture theorists an opportunity to expound on the importance of culture.

One advance on the political process theory is the ''political mediation model,'' which outlines the way in which the political context facing movement actors intersects with the strategic choices that movements make. An additional strength of this model is that it can look at the outcomes of social movements not only in terms of success or failure but also in terms of consequences (whether intentional or unintentional, positive or negative) and in terms of [[collective benefits]].

===Framing perspective===
Reflecting the [[cultural turn]] in the social sciences and humanities more broadly, recent strains of social movement theory and research add to the largely structural concerns seen in the resource mobilization and political process theories by emphasizing the cultural and psychological aspects of social movement processes, such as collectively shared interpretations and beliefs, ideologies, values and other meanings about the world. In doing so, this general cultural approach also attempts to address the [[Free rider problem|free-rider problem]]. One particularly successful take on some such cultural dimensions is manifested in the [[Framing (social sciences)|framing perspective]] on social movements.

While both resource mobilization theory and political process theory include, or at least accept, the idea that certain shared understandings of, for example, perceived unjust societal conditions must exist for mobilization to occur at all, this is not explicitly problematized within those approaches. The framing perspective has brought such shared understandings to the forefront of the attempt to understand movement creation and existence by, e.g., arguing that, in order for social movements to successfully mobilize individuals, they must develop an ''injustice frame''. An injustice frame is a collection of ideas and symbols that illustrate both how significant the problem is as well as what the movement can do to alleviate it,

:"Like a picture frame, an issue frame marks off some part of the world. Like a building frame, it holds things together. It provides coherence to an array of symbols, images, and arguments, linking them through an underlying organizing idea that suggests what is essential - what consequences and values are at stake. We do not see the frame directly, but infer its presence by its characteristic expressions and language. Each frame gives the advantage to certain ways of talking and thinking, while it places others out of the picture."&lt;ref&gt;Ryan and Gamson 2006, p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

Important characteristics of the injustice frames include:&lt;ref&gt;Ryan and Gamson 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* Facts take on their meaning by being embedded in frames, which render them relevant and significant or irrelevant and trivial.
* People carry around multiple frames in their heads.
* Successful reframing involves the ability to enter into the worldview of our adversaries.
* All frames contain implicit or explicit appeals to moral principles.
In emphasizing the injustice frame, culture theory also addresses the free-rider problem. The free-rider problem refers to the idea that people will not be motivated to participate in a social movement that will use up their personal resources (e.g., time, money, etc.) if they can still receive the benefits without participating. In other words, if person X knows that movement Y is working to improve environmental conditions in his neighborhood, he is presented with a choice: join or not join the movement. If he believes the movement will succeed without him, he can avoid participation in the movement, save his resources, and still reap the benefits - this is ''free-riding''. A significant problem for social movement theory has been to explain why people join movements if they believe the movement can/will succeed without their contribution. Culture theory argues that, in conjunction with social networks being an important contact tool, the injustice frame will provide the motivation for people to contribute to the movement.

Framing processes includes three separate components:
* Diagnostic frame: the movement organization frames what is the problem or what they are critiquing
* Prognostic frame: the movement organization frames what is the desirable solution to the problem
* Motivational frame: the movement organization frames a "call to arms" by suggesting and encouraging that people take action to solve the problem

==Social movement and social networking==
For more than ten years, social movement groups have been using the Internet to accomplish organizational goals. It has been argued that the Internet helps to increase the speed, reach and effectiveness of social movement-related communication as well as mobilization efforts, and as a result, it has been suggested that the Internet has had a positive impact on the social movements in general.&lt;ref name="Obar"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ope;|first=J.A.M.|title=From the Streets to the Internet: The Cyber-Diffusion of Contention|journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|year=1999|volume=566|pages=132–143|doi=10.1177/0002716299566001011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eaton|first=M.|title=Manufacturing Community in an Online Activity Organization: The Rhetoric of MoveOn.org's E-mails|journal=Information, Communication and Society|year=2010|volume=13|issue=2|pages=174–192|doi=10.1080/13691180902890125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Obar|first=J.A. |author2=Zube, P. |author3=Lampe, C.|title=Advocacy 2.0: An analysis of how advocacy groups in the United States perceive and use social media as tools for facilitating civic engagement and collective action|journal=Journal of Information Policy|year=2012|volume=2|pages=1–25|ssrn=1956352|doi=10.2139/ssrn.1956352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many discussions have been generated recently on the topic of social networking and the effect it may play on the formation and mobilization of social movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clay Shirky|Shirky, Clay]]. ''[[Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing Without Organizations]]''. Penguin Press HC, The, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the emergence of the [[Coffee Party]] first appeared on the social networking site, [[Facebook]]. The party has continued to gather membership and support through that site and file sharing sites, such as [[Flickr]]. The [[2009–2010 Iranian election protests]] also demonstrated how social networking sites are making the mobilization of large numbers of people quicker and easier. Iranians were able to organize and speak out against the election of [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] by using sites such as [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]]. This in turn prompted widespread government censorship of the web and social networking sites.

The sociological study of social movements is quite new. The traditional view of movements often perceived them as chaotic and disorganized, treating activism as a threat to the [[social order]]. The activism experienced in the 1960s and 1970s shuffled in a new world opinion about the subject. Models were now introduced to understand the organizational and structural powers embedded in social movements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15632">The [[ethno-linguistic]] composition of the population of [[South Asia]], that is the nations of [[India]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]], [[Maldives]] and [[Sri Lanka]] is highly diverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Geoscheme|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the population fall within two large [[language family|linguistic groups]], [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] and [[Dravidian people|Dravidian]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Indian society is traditionally divided into [[Caste system in India|castes]] or clans, not ethnicities, and these categories have had no official status since independence in 1947, except for the [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|scheduled castes and tribes]] which remain registered for the purpose of [[affirmative action]]. In today's [[India]], the population is categorized in terms of the 1,652 [[Languages of India|mother tongues spoken]].

These groups are further subdivided into numerous sub-groups, castes and tribes. Indo-Aryans form the predominant ethno-linguistic group in [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]] ([[North India]], [[East India]], [[West India]], [[Central India]]), [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Nepal]], [[Sri Lanka]] and the [[Maldives]]. Dravidians form the predominant ethno-linguistic group in [[South India|southern India]] and the northern and eastern regions of Sri Lanka, and a small pocket in Pakistan. Certain [[Iranian peoples|Iranian speaking peoples]] also have a significant presence in South Asia, the large majority of whom are located in Pakistan, with heavy concentrations in [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]] and [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]]. [[Dards|Dardic people]]s form a minority among the Indo-Aryans. They are classified as belonging to the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan language]] group,&lt;ref&gt;G. Morgenstierne Irano-Dardica. Wiesbaden 1973; Morgenstierne, G. Indo-Iranian frontier languages. ([[Institute for Comparative Research in Human Culture|Instituttet for Sammenlignende Kulturforskning]]. Publ. ser. B: Skrifter, no. 11, 35, 40) Oslo: H. Aschehoug, 1929 sqq, reprint  Oslo 1973, C. Masica The Indo-Aryan languages, New York 1991, p. 21; R.L. Trail and G.R. Cooper, Kalasha Dictionary, Islamabad &amp; High Wycombe 1999 p. xi; The Indo-Aryan languages, edited by George Cardona and Dhanesh Jain. London, New York : Routledge, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; though sometimes they are also classified as external to the Indo-Aryan branch.&lt;ref&gt;G.A. Grierson, The Pisaca Languages of North-Western India, Asiatic Society, London, 1906, repr. Delhi 1969, p. 4-6; still repeated in:  History of Civilizations of Central Asia, Ahmad Hasan Dani, Vadim Mikhaĭlovich Masson, János Harmatta, Boris Abramovich Litvinovskiĭ, Clifford, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; They are found in northern Pakistan ([[Gilgit-Baltistan|Northern Areas]] and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa) and in [[Jammu and Kashmir]], India.

Minority groups not falling within either large group mostly speak languages belonging to the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] and [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] language families, and mostly live around [[Ladakh]] and [[Northeast India]], Nepal, Propan-Bhutan, and the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] of Bangladesh. The [[Andamanese]] (Sentinel, Onge, Jarawa, Great Andamanese) live on some of the Andaman Islands and speak a language isolate, as do the [[Kusunda people|Kusunda]] in central Nepal,&lt;ref&gt;D.E. Watters, ''Notes on Kusunda (a language isolate of Nepal)'', Kathmandu 2005&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Vedda people|Vedda]] in Sri Lanka, and the [[Nihali]] of central India, who number about 5000 people. The people of the [[Hunza valley]] in Pakistan are another distinct population. They speak [[Burushaski]], a language isolate.

The traditions of different ethnic groups in South Asia have diverged, influenced by external cultures, especially in the northwestern parts of South Asia and in the border regions and busy ports, where there are greater levels of contact with external cultures. This is particularly true for many ethnic groups in the [[North-East India|northeastern parts]] of South Asia who are ethnically related to peoples of the [[Far East]]. The largest ethno-linguistic group in South Asia are the Indo-Aryans, numbering around 1 billion, and the largest sub-group are the native speakers of [[Hindi languages]], numbering more than 470 million.

These groups are based solely on a linguistic basis and not on a genetic basis.

'''''Such A Pretty Girl''''' is a 2007 young adult novel by [[American people|American]] author Laura Wiess. The book was first published on January 2, 2007 through MTV Books and deals with the subject matter of a teenage girl that must deal with the reality that the father that [[child molestation|molested]] and [[sexual abuse|sexually abused]] her and several others is getting an early release from jail.

After ''Such A Pretty Girl's'' release in 2007, Weiss has received several letters from people of various ages relating their experiences with sexual abuse.&lt;ref name="Sentinel"&gt;{{cite web|title='Pretty girl' provokes emotional responses|url=http://eb.gmnews.com/news/2007-01-18/Front_Page/052.html|publisher=Sentinel|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weiss stated that she was inspired to write the novel after viewing a news program about sexual abuse that used the term "offenders", which she felt "minimized the abuse perpetrated".&lt;ref name="Sentinel" /&gt;

==Synopsis==
The story takes place over a time span of 3 days, and set in Estertown, a fictional town in New Jersey. The story begins with Charles, Merideth's father in jail for molesting children. Though he was sentenced to nine years, he is released after only three. Though her mother, Sharon is thrilled, Meredith is horrified because she knows he will molest her again. Meredith's mother, Sharon, pretends that Charles simply made a mistake and arranges for them to live near him. The whole town avoids Merideth's family because they know Charles may try to hurt their children, with some businesses even refusing them service. In order to escape Charles, Merideth attempts to run away several times. The first time, she ran away to her boyfriend Andy's house. Andy is 19 and is paralyzed since the night he graduated High School. He and his religious mother are planning to go to Iowa to meet the victim's soul to cleanse him in the next couple of days. The second time, she went to her Mothers mom's house, who is Mayor. Later in the book, Meredith and Nigel, one of her friends who is a police officer, plan to catch her father . They set cameras all around the house, especially in her room. This is a very big help because Meredith's father tried to hurt her while her mother left them alone together. To save herself, Meredith takes a Virgin Mary statue and hits her father with it. Her father becomes unconscious.

The {{nihongo|'''United Red Army'''|連合赤軍|''Rengō Sekigun''}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[terrorist]] organization, established on 15 July 1971. It united the Marxist–Leninist-Maoist {{nihongo|'''Red Army Faction'''|赤軍派|''Sekigunha''}}, led in 1971 by [[Tsuneo Mori]], and the Reformed Marxist Revolutionary Left Wing group, [[Japanese Communist Party]] [[Kanagawa Prefecture]] Committee, aka {{nihongo|'''Keihin Anti-Security Treaty Joint Struggle Group'''|京浜安保共闘|''Keihin Anbo Kyoutou''}} led by [[Hiroko Nagata]]. The United Red Army had 29 members and lost 14 by killing them in less than a year. Most were members of the [[Japanese New Left|New Left]].

Early in August, two [[defectors]] were [[lynched]] and their bodies buried in Inba numa [[marsh]], [[Chiba Prefecture]]. In the winter of 1971–1972 the United Red Army was hiding in the [[mountains]] in [[Gunma Prefecture]]. They established camps and trained for [[military]] purposes. The leaders of the United Red Army encouraged their fighters to examine their weaknesses in criticism and self-criticism, and these sessions turned into lynchings. The group purged itself one by one of members deemed not sufficiently revolutionary. Many of the twelve victims died tied to posts in the open, exposed to the elements, but others were beaten to death or slaughtered with knives. The first died on 31 December and the last on 12 February. The United Red Army leaders later did not admit that they had killed, but called it {{nihongo|''death by defeatism''|敗北死|''Haiboku shi''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_aKFCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT46|p=46|title=The United Red Army on Screen: Cinema, Aesthetics and The Politics of Memory|first=Christopher|last=Perkins|publisher=[[Springer Publishing|Springer]]|year=2015|isbn=9781137480354}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-February two men escaped, and the remaining paramilitaries decided to abandon their mountain base, but the police had already closed in on them. Tsuneo Mori and Hiroko Nagata were caught, and then the others, but five militants escaped, took a woman hostage, and held out for nine days in a holiday lodge in the [[Asama-Sanso incident]]. By the end of the siege they had shot and killed two policemen and a civilian.

United Red Army leader Tsuneo Mori killed himself in prison on 1 January 1973. The second-in-commands, Hiroko Nagata and Hiroshi Sakaguchi, were sentenced to death. Nagata died on 5 February 2011 from brain cancer while still being held in a detention facility. {{As of|2013}}, Sakaguchi is still alive in prison.

[[Fusako Shigenobu]], the leader of the Lebanon-based [[Japanese Red Army]], was a member of the [[Red Army Faction]]. She left Japan to train with the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] at the end of February, 1971. Her group conducted its most deadly assault, the [[Lod Airport massacre|Lod airport massacre]] on 30 May 1972.

The group is the subject of the 2007 film ''[[United Red Army (film)|United Red Army]]'', directed by [[Kōji Wakamatsu]].

{{Women in society sidebar}}
Throughout history, '''women in Jordan'''{{'}}s political, social and economic status has varied based on the legal, traditional, cultural and religious values at the time. The current legal framework which is based on European civil code is coupled with Islamic tradition and Shari'a Law has determined the rights and liberties legally granted to women while traditional ideas about masculinity and femininity seem to determine women's access to education, the workplace and the general public sphere.

== Political representation==
===Operative legal framework===
The current operating framework for women’s rights in [[Jordan]] includes the Jordanian Constitution, a civil status code, the Personal Status Law and international law regarding [[human rights]]. Traditional and cultural ideals of [[femininity]] also effect how women are viewed and treated in Jordan.&lt;ref name="WB40"&gt;The Economic Advancement of Women in Jordan: A Country Gender Assessment. World Bank, May 2005. PDF file. Page 40&lt;/ref&gt;  '''Women in Jordan''', however, did not receive the right to [[vote]] until 1974. This was fairly late for the region, as [[Israel]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Egypt]], [[Yemen]], [[Turkey]] and [[Iran]] had all granted women [[suffrage]] by 1967.&lt;ref name="IPU"&gt;Women's Suffrage: A Chronology of the Recognition of Women's Rights to Vote and Stand for Election." Women in Politics. N.p., n.d. Web. 16 Apr. 2012. &lt;http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/suffrage.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jordanian Constitution was written in 1952 and states that all “Jordanians shall be equal before the law. There shall be no discrimination between them as regards their rights and duties on grounds of race, language or religion.” &lt;ref name="WB40" /&gt;  There are many constitutional provisions that affirm basic rights and political [[representation (politics)|representation]] for all.  For example, Article 22 states that each Jordanian has [[equal opportunity]] to be appointed to and serve in public office as such appointments “shall be made on the basis of merit and qualifications.” &lt;ref name="WB41"&gt;The Economic Advancement of Women in Jordan: A Country Gender Assessment. World Bank, May 2005. PDF file. Page 41&lt;/ref&gt; An amendment on January 28, 2003 implemented the [[Election threshold|quota]] system in Jordanian parliament, and while a religious precedent exists for parliamentary seats in the constitution, allocating seats for women is new and shows that the government recognizes and is trying to break down the various barriers women face running for office.&lt;ref name="WB41" /&gt; The Provisional Penal Code reduces sentencing for men who commit violent acts against women in the “honor” context.  In the last decade, however, it has been amended. While the original code allowed men to implement the law themselves, the new amendment leaves punishment and sentencing to the judicial system of the state.&lt;ref name="WB41" /&gt; In addition, there are no provisions under the Labor or Penal Codes to protect women against [[sexual harassment]]. This lack of legislation explicitly protecting women exposes them to harassment both at home and in the workplace.  Jordan is a member of many [[international organizations]] that guarantee basic [[human rights]] to women.&lt;ref name="WB47"&gt;The Economic Advancement of Women in Jordan: A Country Gender Assessment. World Bank, May 2005. PDF file. Page 47&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many legal documents that support women's equality in Jordan. While the [[Quran]] demands "equality of the sexes," it provides a religious framework that separates men and women.&lt;ref name="Sonbol WFD29"&gt;Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women, the Family, and Divorce Laws in Islamic History. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1996. Print. Page 29&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran gives men extensive power in the [[divorce]] process and a certain "economic responsibility." &lt;ref name="Sonbol WFD34"&gt;Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women, the Family, and Divorce Laws in Islamic History. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1996. Print. Page 34&lt;/ref&gt; Men are "by nature not equal because God created them different in nature, talent, and ability," as they are "created and fashioned for different tasks," the man is expected to protect and provide for his family while the women is expected support her husband, raise children and take care of the house.&lt;ref name="Sonbol WFD37"&gt;Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women, the Family, and Divorce Laws in Islamic History. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1996. Print. Page 37&lt;/ref&gt; The Personal Status Law in Jordan was enacted on September 5, 1976 and replaced the Jordanian Law of Family Rights No.92 &lt;ref name="Nasir 34"&gt;Nasir, Jamal J. The Islamic Law of Personal Status. 1986. Norwell, MA: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1990. Arab and Islamic Law Series. Page 34. Google Books. Web. 17 Apr. 2012. &lt;https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=N4WmwikqudIC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=Jordanian+personal+status+law&amp;ots=stgYGulzM&amp;sig=Jntu0uJVUE2uyyMjraqmYIpaw5I#v=onepage&amp;q=Jordanian%20personal%20status%20law&amp;f=false&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Personal Status Law in Jordan determines an individual's status and rights regarding [[marriage]], [[parentage]], [[Legal custody|custody]], [[property]], maintenance for kin, [[missing persons]] and wills.&lt;ref name="Nasir 34" /&gt;

===Representation in elected office===
[[File:Women protest in downtown Amman, Jordan, 1968.jpg|thumb|left|Women protest in [[downtown Amman]], 1968]]
While female participation in Jordanian parliament has increased over the past decade, it still remains low. Notwithstanding the 1974 law giving women the right to campaign and serve in office, few Jordanian women today are motivated to or feel comfortable running for political office, while even fewer are elected and ultimately serve. Current King of Jordan, His Majesty [[King Abdullah II]], passed legislation requiring a quota for the number of women in parliament. Since the quota was established, 15 of the 130 seats in the Lower House of Parliament have consistently and successfully been reserved for women. However, women won 19 seats in the 2013 elections.&lt;ref name="WB50"&gt;The Economic Advancement of Women in Jordan: A Country Gender Assessment. World Bank, May 2005. PDF file. Page 50&lt;/ref&gt;

On average, 16% of parliamentary seats are held by women globally.&lt;ref name="WB50" /&gt; In Jordan, however, women only hold around six percent in the two parliamentary houses combined.&lt;ref name="WB51"&gt;The Economic Advancement of Women in Jordan: A Country Gender Assessment. World Bank, May 2005. PDF file. Page 51&lt;/ref&gt;  Jordan is still working on women's representation in elected office, but as progressive policies continue to be proposed and adopted under King Abdallah, traditional gender roles and customary ideals of femininity and [[masculinity]] in Jordan will be challenged, decreasing inequalities between men and women.

While only 6% of parliamentary seats are held by women, the [[Queen of Jordan]] has used her position and subsequent power to actively support the [[women's rights]].&lt;ref name="EB Rania"&gt;"Rania al-ʿAbdullah." Encyclopædia Britannica: Academic Edition . N.p., n.d. Web. 11 Apr. 2012.&lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1010290/Rania-al-Abdullah&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Rania has been Queen since 1999 and is married to King ʿAbdullah II.&lt;ref name="EB Rania"/&gt; Her family is of Palestinian descent (her father was from Ṭūlkarm, her mother from Nablus) and was born and raised in [[Kuwait]].&lt;ref name="EB Rania"/&gt; Rania is highly educated; she  has a business administration degree from the [[American University in Cairo]] (1991) and before marrying King Abdullah II in January 1993, she worked as a banker.&lt;ref name="EB Rania"/&gt; As Queen of Jordan, Rania has fought for a wide range of causes, including women’s rights, access to education, environmental concerns, and the development of strong Jordanian communities. She is still incredibly active today. In March 2008, Rania launched a video blog as part of her efforts to deconstruct stereotypes about Arabs and promote dialogue with the West.&lt;ref name="EB Rania"/&gt;

===Jordanian National Commission for Women===
The Jordanian National Commission for Women's (JNCW) mission is to “support mainstreaming of a gender-equality perspective in all policy areas and to narrow the gap between formal acknowledgement of women's rights as detailed by legislation and actual societal attitudes towards women through improving the status of women and enhancing their role in national development.”  &lt;ref name="JNCW"&gt;Mission." Jordanian National Commission for Women. N.p., 18 Apr. 2012. Web. 15 Apr. 2012. &lt;http://www.women.jo/en/about.php?cat_id=10&amp;type=0&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; They work to equalize women’s status – socially, politically and economically – in Jordan by proposing legislation and studying the existing policies regarding women’s rights.&lt;ref name="EB Rania"/&gt; The JNCW also works closely with various public institutions and NGO’s in hopes of branching out and developing their organization. In 1996, the Jordanian cabinet made the JNCW the official government “reference point” on all issues pertaining to women and now reports directly to the [[Prime Minister]]. The JNCW has become a quasi-governmental institution accountable in large part for drafting national policies regarding women’s rights and economic advancement.&lt;ref name="WB48"&gt;The Economic Advancement of Women in Jordan: A Country Gender Assessment. World Bank, May 2005. PDF file. Page 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social representation==
===Education===
[[File:Young girls reading - Government primary school in Amman, Jordan.jpg|thumbnail|Jordan has the highest literacy rate in the [[Middle East]].]]
There are constitutional provisions that affirm Jordanian citizens’ basic rights to [[education]]. Article 20, in fact, makes elementary education required for all Jordanians and free of charge in public, government schools.&lt;ref name="WB41" /&gt; This provision is elaborated on and reinforced in the [[Education Act]]. The Jordanian government spends more than 5% on education  every year and has had positive results.  Since 1980, the [[literacy rate]] in Jordan has increased from 69.2% to 91% in 2002. With a female literacy rate of 85.9%, Jordan has the highest female literacy rate in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref name="Sonbol WoJ3"&gt;Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women of Jordan: Islam, Labor, &amp; the Law. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2003. Print. Page 3&lt;/ref&gt; So, while the majority of Jordanian women are both literate and well educated, the differences in career expectations based on gender stem from cultural practices and not the fact that women are not as capable as men.&lt;ref name="Sonbol WoJ3"/&gt;

Female enrollment at all levels of school is high and Jordanian women have the highest average number of years of schooling in comparison with women in both Kuwait and [[Bahrain]]. While men in Jordan receive 1.7 years more schooling that women in Jordan receive, the difference is considered very low for the region.&lt;ref name="WB27"&gt;The Economic Advancement of Women in Jordan: A Country Gender Assessment. World Bank, May 2005. PDF file. Page 27&lt;/ref&gt;  The drop out rate is not excessive, but women claim their primary reason for dropping out of school (at various levels) is [[marriage]] and their responsibilities in the home while men claim they drop out primarily to get jobs and help their families make money.&lt;ref name="WB27" /&gt;

Family approval of a woman’s education is crucial. When a poorer family is unable to put more than one child through school, the boy gets the education and the girl is expected to focus on homemaking skills. While women have access to basic schooling, access to technological training is limited as women are expected to study topics that directly relate to their dominant roles as wives and mothers – such as art, humanities, and teaching.&lt;ref name="WB28"&gt;The Economic Advancement of Women in Jordan: A Country Gender Assessment. World Bank, May 2005. PDF file. Page 28&lt;/ref&gt;  Though females are fairly equally represented in school, there is excessive gender stereotyping in Jordanian textbooks.&lt;ref name="WB27" /&gt;

===Employment===
There are constitutional provisions that affirm Jordanian citizens’ basic rights to work and there is nothing in [[Islam]] that forbids women from doing so.&lt;ref name="Sonbol WoJ54"&gt;Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women of Jordan: Islam, Labor, &amp; the Law. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2003. Print. Page 54&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution states, "Work is the right of all citizens," "Jobs are based on capability," and "All Jordanians are equal before the law.&lt;ref name="Sonbol WoJ87"&gt;Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women of Jordan: Islam, Labor, &amp; the Law. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2003. Print. Page 87&lt;/ref&gt; There will be no discrimination between Jordanians regarding rights and duties based on [[race (human classification)|race]], [[language]] or [[religion]]." &lt;ref name="Sonbol WoJ87" /&gt; The [[Labor Laws]] clarify the Constitution further: "By Jordanians are meant both men and women." &lt;ref name="Sonbol WoJ87" /&gt; The Labor Code defines a worker/laborer/employee as “each person, male or female, who performs a job in return for wages.” The Constitution asserts that the government “shall ensure work and education within the limits of its possibilities, and it shall ensure a state of tranquility and [[equal opportunities]] to all Jordanians.” &lt;ref name="Sonbol WoJ87" /&gt; Work is “the right of every citizen,” and “the State shall provide opportunities for work to all citizens by directing the national economy and raising its standards.”  Jordanian labor laws protect women from losing their jobs during [[pregnancy]] and give them assistance with [[childcare]].&lt;ref name="WB40" /&gt; While the laws themselves promote justice and equality, the traditional ideals of masculinity and femininity and the "[[patriarchal]] nature of the [[legal system]]" contribute to women's noticeable absence from the workplace and the inequalities they face once there.&lt;ref name="Sonbol WoJ87" /&gt;

Gender inequalities in Jordan today also stem from traditional gender roles that have embedded themselves in Jordanian culture. “At the root of the barriers to women’s labor force participation are traditional attitudes that place a high value on women’s roles in the private sphere and within the family that is important in Jordanian society.” &lt;ref name="WB40" /&gt; These stereotypes are based on the notions that: “(a) men and women differ biologically and that these biological differences determine their social function; (b) men and women carry different and complementary responsibilities within the family; and (c) they have different but equitable rights associated with those responsibilities.” &lt;ref name="WB40" /&gt;

The "traditional paradigm" of Jordanian gender expects women to marry early and contribute to the family as a homemaker, wife and mother.&lt;ref name="WB40" /&gt; It assumes that the man will be in charge of the household and that he will provide for his family financially. Women, as wives and mothers, are perceived as vulnerable and in need of protection that should be provided by the husband. Men’s responsibility to protect their wives and children is considered sufficient justification for their exercise of authority over women in all areas of decision-making regarding both the public and private spheres. Due to this traditional paradigm, women’s interaction with and representation in politics and society are mediated by her husband.&lt;ref name="WB40" /&gt; While this paradigm exists to some extent all over the world, it is particularly prominent in Jordan as it has become institutionalized and pervades the legal framework.
[[File:Women doing beadwork in Jordan.jpg|thumb|left|Women assembling mosaics in a government-sponsored program|alt=Four women, one in a wheelchair and two wearing headscarves, sitting around a table assembling mosaics with tools and materials]]
[[Unemployment]], [[underemployment]], differences in wages and [[occupational segregation]] are the four main factors in the economy that impact women’s level of labor.&lt;ref name="WB10"&gt;The Economic Advancement of Women in Jordan: A Country Gender Assessment. World Bank, May 2005. PDF file. Page 10&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of unemployment, 15% of men are unemployed while 25% of women are unemployed and 82% of young women ages 15–29 are unemployed.  Women are underemployed as they tend to be hired less than men with lesser education because large sections of the Jordanian economy are and have traditionally been closed off to women.&lt;ref name="Sonbol WoJ3"/&gt; Less educated men often hold more jobs while women are often better educated, leading to many women settling for jobs requiring lesser education than they have. [[Wage discrimination]] in Jordan is no different from anywhere else in the world, but in combination with traditional and cultural factors – like being responsible for the private sphere (the family and the home) – women are driven away from the workforce. Jordanian law suggests that wives should be obedient to their husbands because the men financially support the family, and if she is disobedient her husband can discontinue financial support.&lt;ref name="Sonbol WoJ15"&gt;Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women of Jordan: Islam, Labor, &amp; the Law. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2003. Print. Page 15&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, men have assumed the power to forbid their wives from working, and the Jordanian courts have upheld these laws.&lt;ref name="Sonbol WoJ15"/&gt; Furthermore, as [[honor killings]] consistently occur and are currently on the rise, women are less motivated to leave the safety of their homes.&lt;ref name="Sonbol WoJ16"&gt;Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women of Jordan: Islam, Labor, &amp; the Law. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2003. Print. Page 16&lt;/ref&gt; Laws in Jordan regarding honor killings continue to make it possible for courts to deal with perpetrators leniently.&lt;ref name="Sonbol WoJ16"/&gt;

Occupational segregation exists in all aspect of the Jordanian workforce as both vertical and horizontal segregation is present.&lt;ref name="WB22"&gt;The Economic Advancement of Women in Jordan: A Country Gender Assessment. World Bank, May 2005. PDF file. Page 22&lt;/ref&gt; Vertical segregation refers to the concept of the [[glass ceiling]], where women are concentrated in lower paying, lower-ranking jobs and cannot break through to the higher levels. Horizontal segregation occurs when certain occupations are more female intensive. For example, more Jordanian men are civil servants and fill high-ranking positions while Jordanian women are concentrated in middle-ranking jobs. The consequences of women’s limited economic advancement and low female participation in the workforce leads to low utilization of national production capacity (World Bank estimates it is currently at half its potential), lower average household income and lower per capita [[GDP]].&lt;ref name="WB22"/&gt; The greatest challenge to incorporating women equally into the workplace is overcoming traditional attitudes towards women and their expected duties as mothers and wives.&lt;ref name="Sonbol WoJ3"/&gt; A change in attitude will inevitably lead to the changing of "gendered laws" and the role of women as homemakers.&lt;ref name="Sonbol WoJ7"&gt;Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women of Jordan: Islam, Labor, &amp; the Law. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2003. Print. Page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Networking===
The Islamic Center Charity Society in Jordan is an example of one way middle class Jordanian women are able to network and connect over mutual experiences. Instead of functioning like a traditional “charity,” these Islamic charity institutions are founded on a more social basis.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Clark, Janine A. Islam, Charity, and Activism. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 2004. Print&lt;/ref&gt; While these they are not officially connected to the state, they impact the country both socially and politically. Other community groups in Jordan, like the [[The Jordanian Hashemite Fund for Human Development|Jordanian Hashemite Fund]], encourage women to form their own committees, run for local elections, and form small female-only cooperatives. When many of these initiatives began in the 1980s, they received marked opposition from community leaders, with some threatening to shut down women's committees in their area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Rethinking an NGO: Development, Donors and Civil Society in Jordan|last = bint Talal|first = Basma|publisher = IB Tauris|year = 2004|isbn = 1 86064 925 4|location = London|pages = 135–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current political landscape is comparatively more amenable to female political participation and networking, although challenges remain.

==Family rights==
===Marriage===
Jordanian husbands determine their wives’ abilities to employ their constitutionally guaranteed rights to work and other public activities. Jordanian legislation and culture suggests that men have a certain control over their wives to mediate their interaction with the public. Men expect their wives to be obedient because they work in order to support the family financially.&lt;ref name="Sonbol WoJ15"/&gt; Some amendments postpone this “ownership” for young girls. For example, the Jordanian Parliament increased the legal age of marriage to 18 for both boys and girls, as the previous law set the legal age for marriage at 16 for boys and 15 for girls, which promoted early marriages and subsequent school drop out for married girls.&lt;ref name="WB47"/&gt;

===Divorce===
Divorce law is based almost entirely on Islamic Shari'a law, which is considered "unquestionable authority." &lt;ref name="Sonbol WFD10"&gt;Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women, the Family, and Divorce Laws in Islamic History. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1996. Print. Page 10&lt;/ref&gt; Variations in interpretation and application, however, do exist among [[Sharia|Islamic courts]] across the Middle East. Divorces in Jordan, in particular, often ignore women’s rights and leave women with nothing if they are not supported by their families. In recent years, the government has worked to fix this problem by altering the [[judicial system]]. For example, "a new law has been drafted to force men to pay [[alimony]] for three years instead of six months, which was previously the case.” &lt;ref name="Sonbol WFD10"/&gt; Because men are free to divorce and stop supporting their wives if they are "disobedient," another law created an obligatory fund for divorced women, guaranteeing them a settlement from their ex-husband.&lt;ref name="Alami"&gt;Alami, Mona. "Women Make Progress But Honour Killings Persist." IPS. N.p., 22 Apr. 2010. Web. 15 Apr. 2012. &lt;http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=51150&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===
The father was technically responsible for the children's [[property]], maintenance and education while the mother was responsible for the "physical care and nurturing" of the children.&lt;ref name="Sonbol WFD225"&gt;Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women, the Family, and Divorce Laws in Islamic History. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1996. Print. Page 225&lt;/ref&gt; While the father was considered the "natural [[Legal guardian|guardian]]", if the parents were divorced the mother would take custody.&lt;ref name="Sonbol WFD226"&gt;Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women, the Family, and Divorce Laws in Islamic History. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1996. Print. Page 226&lt;/ref&gt; Today, however, children "belong" to both parents but the mother generally stays home to raise the children.

===Property===
While studies of women and their [[property rights]] evidence that Islamic courts have "upheld women's rights to property," women in Jordan legally own and [[Inheritance|inherit]] less than their male relatives do.&lt;ref name="Sonbol WFD220"&gt;Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women, the Family, and Divorce Laws in Islamic History. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1996. Print. Page 220&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout history and still today, when women have owned and inherited property, they have been frequently and intensely pressured to give up their land to male family members.&lt;ref name="Alami"/&gt; As a result, less than four percent of all property in Jordan is owned by women.&lt;ref name="Sonbol WFD220"/&gt;

===Honor killings===
Honor crimes are acts of violence committed by family members against women who are perceived to have shamed the family in some way. Women can "shame" their family by engaging in "[[marital infidelity]], [[pre-marital sex]] and [[flirting]]", or getting raped &lt;ref name="Mayell1"&gt;Mayell, Hillary. Thousands of Women Killed for Family "Honor." N.p.: National Geographic Society, February 12, 2002. National Geographic Society. Web. 17 Apr. 2012. Page 1. &lt;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/pf/15061734.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Jordanian Penal Code today still includes provisions that excuse honor crimes by granting the perpetrator leniency in punishment. Many of these killings go unreported, but each year tens of women are killed by family members in order to "restore honor." &lt;ref name="Mayell1"/&gt; Honor killings occur across the Middle East and around the world. The [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] reports of honor killings in [[Bangladesh]], [[Great Britain]], [[Brazil]], [[Ecuador]], [[Egypt]], [[India]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Jordan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Morocco]], [[Sweden]], [[Turkey]], and [[Uganda]] expose that this practice "goes across cultures and across religions." &lt;ref name="Mayell1"/&gt;

It has been difficult to change legislation (particularly Article 340 of the Jordanian Penal Code) because violence against women has traditionally been considered a "private matter" rather than the "responsibility of the state." &lt;ref name="Ruane1529"&gt;Ruane, Rachel A. Murder in the Name of Honor: Violence against Women in Jordan and Pakistan. 14 Emory International Law Review (2000). Page 1529. http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/emint14&amp;div=43&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, there has been a nationwide women's human rights campaign, supported by King Abullah and Queen Rania, to modify Article 340, which grants perpetrators of honor killings leniency in Jordanian courts &lt;ref name="Ruane1528"&gt;Ruane, Rachel A. Murder in the Name of Honor: Violence against Women in Jordan and Pakistan. 14 Emory International Law Review (2000). Page 1528. http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/emint14&amp;div=43&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, a 33-year-old man was charged with "hammering his wife to death and dumping her body on the highway leading to the [[Queen Alia International Airport]]". The husband easily confessed to murdering his wife in order to defend his honor, as she had been out meeting a male friend without his permission. "There are about 12 honor crime cases every year in Jordan," said Diana Shalabi, director of the complaint office at the Jordanian National Commission for Women. "However," she said, "many crimes involving women are seen as honor killings and should be called regular crimes instead." &lt;ref name="Alami"/&gt;
