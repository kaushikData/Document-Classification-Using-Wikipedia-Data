'''Anti-Turkism''', also known as '''Turkophobia''' or '''anti-Turkish sentiment''', is hostility, intolerance, or racism against [[Turkish people|Turkish]] or [[Turkic peoples|Turkic people]], [[Culture of Turkey|Turkish culture]], [[Turkic countries]], or [[Turkey]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Armenia: people, nation, state |last=Libaridian |first=Gerard J. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2004 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |location= |isbn=978-0-7658-0205-7 |page=193 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NDZ8sJVL_uUC&amp;pg=PA193 |quote=''One consequence of the shift from anti-communism to anti-Turkism was that an important segment of the Diaspora lived through moments&amp;nbsp;...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The origins of Arab nationalism |last=Khalidi |first=Rashid |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1991 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-231-07435-3 |page=18 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=21v9mTP_jsUC&amp;pg=PA18 |quote=''In the first place, Arabist ideology, including a bitter anti-Turkism, was fully formulated long before the Young Turk revolution''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
{{Discrimination sidebar}}
The roots of anti-Turkism can be traced back to the arrival of the [[Huns]] in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=E5t0T-fyLYrJtAaHmJyDDg&amp;id=NAdSh00srnkC&amp;dq=Huns+Turk+invasion&amp;q=Huns+Turk+invasion+ruthless#v=snippet&amp;q=Huns%20Turk%20invasion%20ruthless&amp;f=false |title=The Greatest Story Ever Forged: Curse of the Christ Myth - David Hernandez |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the ethnic background of the Huns is a matter of dispute among historians, they are widely believed to have been of Turkic origin,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/FeaturesEurope/BarbarianHuns.htm|title=The Origins of the Huns|last=Kessler|first=P L|website=www.historyfiles.co.uk|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their invasion inspired fear among Europeans.

In the [[Late Middle Ages]], the [[fall of Constantinople]] and the [[Ottoman wars in Europe]]—part of [[Christianity in Europe|European Christians]]' effort to stem the expansion of the [[Ottoman Empire]], the predecessor to Turkey—helped fuel the development of anti-Turkism. By the middle of the 15th century, special [[Mass (liturgy)|masses]] called ''missa contra Turcos'' ([[Latin]] for "mass against Turks") were held in various places in Europe&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6mWY_r7C2VsC&amp;pg=PA117|title=Denmark and the Crusades|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sieps"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sieps.se/publ/rapporter/bilagor/2006_turkiet.pdf |format=PDF |title="Turkey, Sweden and the EU Experiences and Expectations", Report by the Swedish Institute for European Policy Studies |date=April 2006 |page=6 |publisher=Sieps.se |accessdate=2015-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306021813/http://www.sieps.se/publ/rapporter/bilagor/2006_turkiet.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to spread the message that victory over the Ottomans was only possible with the help of God and that a Christian community was therefore necessary to withstand the cruelty of the Turks.&lt;ref name="books.google.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=skIG-CEe24cC&amp;pg=PA121|title=The Cultural Life of the Early Polyphonic Mass|work=Google.com|accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a3NcAAAAMAAJ|title=La Croisade|work=Google.com|accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===16th century===
[[File:Die Osmanen in Europa.JPG|thumb|Original prints from the 16th century at the [[Hungarian National Museum]] depict a Turkish warrior butchering infants.]]
As the Ottomans expanded their empire west, [[Western Europe]] came into more frequent contact with the Turks, often militarily.

During the [[Ottoman–Venetian War (1570–1573)|Fourth Ottoman–Venetian War]], the Ottomans conquered [[Ottoman conquest of Cyprus|Cyprus]].

In the 16th century, around 2,500 publications about the Turks—including more than 1,000 in [[German language|German]]—were released in Europe, spreading the image of the "bloodthirsty Turk". From 1480 to 1610, twice as many books were published about the Turkish threat to Europe than about the discovery of the [[New World]].Bishop [[Johann Faber]] of [[Vienna]] claimed, "There are no crueler and more audacious villains under the heavens than the Turks, who spare no age or sex and mercilessly cut down young and old alike and pluck unripe fruit from the wombs of mothers."&lt;ref name="sieps" /&gt;

During this time, the Ottoman Empire also invaded the [[Balkans]] and [[Siege of Vienna|besieged Vienna]], sparking widespread fear in Europe, and especially in [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zIR7U1a_6A0C&amp;pg=PA185&amp;hl=tr&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=8#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Harvesting Martin Luther's Reflections on Theology, Ethics, and the Church - Timothy J. Wengert |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther]], the German leader of the [[Reformation|Protestant Reformation]], took advantage of these fears by asserting that the Turks were "the agents of the Devil who, along with the Antichrist located in the heart of the Catholic Church, Rome, would usher in the Last Days and the Apocalypse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_world_history/v020/20.3.foley.html |title=Project MUSE - Muslims and Social Change in the Atlantic Basin |doi=10.1353/jwh.0.0064 |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luther believed that the Ottoman invasion was God's punishment of Christians for allowing corruption in the [[Holy See]] and the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0MDO/is_5_34/ai_n21053788/?tag=content;col1 Smith, R. O. (2007). Luther, the Turks, and Islam. Currents in Theology and Mission, 34(5), 351-365]: "Luther's statement of explanation created yet more contention. Indeed, it was singled out for condemnation in Exsurge Domine, the papal bull of excommunication directed at Luther by Pope Leo X on 15 June 1520. Among the "destructive, pernicious, scandalous, and seductive" errors enumerated in the bull is an essentialized version of Luther's position: "To go to war against the Turks is to resist God who punishes our iniquities through them." (11) But even before Exsurge Domine, Luther tied his struggles with Rome to the war against the Turk. Prior to the beginning of the Leipzig Debate with Johannes Eck in June 1519, Luther wrote to his friend Wencenlaus Linck, "I think I can demonstrate that today Rome is worse than the Turk."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1518, when he defended his [[Ninety-five Theses|95 Theses]], Luther claimed that God had sent the Turks to punish Christians just as he had sent war, [[Plague (disease)|plague]], and [[earthquake]]s. (In response, [[Pope Leo X]] issued [[Exsurge Domine|a papal bull]] in which he threatened Luther with [[excommunication]] and portrayed him as a troublemaker who advocated capitulation to the Turks.)&lt;ref name="sieps" /&gt; In his writings ''On War Against the Turk'' and ''Military Sermon Against the Turks'', Luther was "consistent in his theological conception of the Turks as a manifestation of God's chastising rod". He and his followers also espoused the view that the [[Ottoman–Habsburg wars|Ottoman–Habsburg Wars]] were a conflict "between Christ and Antichrist" or "between God and the devil".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zIR7U1a_6A0C&amp;pg=PA185&amp;hl=tr&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=8#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Harvesting Martin Luther's Reflections on Theology, Ethics, and the Church - Timothy J. Wengert |page=185 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spurred by this argument, the [[Portuguese Empire]], seeking to capture more land in [[East Africa]] and other parts of the world, used any encounter with the "Terrible Turk" as "a prime opportunity to establish credentials as champions of the faith on par with other Europeans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_world_history/v018/18.3casale.html |title=Project MUSE - Global Politics in the 1580s: One Canal, Twenty Thousand Cannibals, and an Ottoman Plot to Rule the World |doi=10.1353/jwh.2007.0020 |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stories of the "Wolf-Turk" reinforced the negative image. The Wolf-Turk was claimed to be a man-eating being, half animal and half human, with a [[Gray wolf|wolf]]'s head and tail. Military power and cruelty were the recurring attributes in each portrayal of the Turks.&lt;ref name="sieps" /&gt;

===17th–18th centuries===
According to some sympathetic [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] authors, negative accounts of Turkish customs and people written during the 17th and 18th centuries "served as an 'ideological weapon' during the Enlightenment's arguments about the nature of government",&lt;ref&gt;Grosrichard, A. (1998). The sultan's court: European fantasies of the East. (p. 125).

In [[Sweden]], the Turks were portrayed as the archenemies of Christianity. A book by the parish priest [[Erland Dryselius]] of [[Jönköping]], published in 1694, was titled ''Luna Turcica eller Turkeske måne, anwissjandes lika som uti en spegel det mahometiske vanskelige regementet, fördelter uti fyra qvarter eller böcker'' ("Turkish moon showing as in a mirror the dangerous Mohammedan rule, divided into four quarters or books"). In sermons, the Swedish clergy preached about the Turks' cruelty and bloodthirstiness, and how they systematically burned and plundered the areas they conquered. In a Swedish schoolbook published in 1795, [[Islam]] was described as "the false religion that had been fabricated by the great deceiver Muhammad, to which the Turks to this day universally confess"''.''&lt;ref name="sieps" /&gt;

In 1718, [[James Puckle]] demonstrated two version of his new invention, the [[Puckle gun]]: a tripod-mounted, single-barreled [[flintlock]] weapon fitted with a revolving cylinder, designed to prevent intruders from boarding a ship. The first version, intended for use against Christian enemies, fired conventional round bullets. The second, intended for use against the Muslim Turks, fired square bullets, designed by Kyle Tunis, which were believed to be more damaging and would, according to Puckle's [[patent]], convince the Turks of the "benefits of Christian civilization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A876855|title=h2g2 - The Machine Gun 1718 - 1914 - Edited Entry|date=2003-01-27|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Voltaire]] and other European writers described the Turks as tyrants who destroyed Europe's heritage.&lt;ref name="Karlsson"&gt;[http://www.nurope.eu/istanbul/The%20Turk%20as%20a%20Threat.pdf]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001194404/http://www.nurope.eu/istanbul/The%20Turk%20as%20a%20Threat.pdf|date=October 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'', [[Edward Said]] noted, "Until the end of the seventeenth century the 'Ottoman peril' lurked alongside Europe to represent for the whole of Christian civilization a constant danger, and in time European civilization incorporated that peril and its lore, its great events, figures, virtues, and vices, as something woven into the fabric of life."&lt;ref&gt;Edward Said. "[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]", (1978), p.&amp;nbsp;59–60&lt;/ref&gt;

Even within the Ottoman Empire, the term "Turk" was sometimes used to denote the [[Yörüks|Yörük]]''' '''backwoodsmen, bumpkins, or illiterate peasants in [[Anatolia]]. "Etrak-i bi-idrak", an Ottoman play on words, meant "the ignorant Turk".&lt;ref&gt;Alfred J. Rieber, Alexei Miller. Imperial Rule, Central European University Press, 2005. pg 33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Özay Mehmet]] wrote in his book ''Islamic Identity and Development: Studies of the Islamic Periphery'':&lt;ref&gt;Ozay Mehmet, Islamic Identity and Development: Studies of the Islamic Periphery, Routledge, 1990. pg 115&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote
|The ordinary Turks [Turkmen, or Yörüks] did not have a sense of belonging to a ruling ethnic group. In particular, they had a confused sense of self-image. Who were they: Turks, Muslims or Ottomans? Their literature was sometimes Persian, sometimes Arabic, but always courtly and elitist. There was always a huge social and cultural distance between the Imperial centre and the Anatolian periphery. As Bernard Lewis expressed it: "In the Imperial society of the Ottomans the ethnic term Turk was little used, and then chiefly in a rather derogatory sense, to designate the Turcoman nomads or, later, the ignorant and uncouth Turkish-speaking peasants of the Anatolian villages." (Lewis 1968: 1)

In the words of a British observer of the Ottoman values and institutions at the start of the twentieth century: "The surest way to insult an Ottoman gentleman is to call him a 'Turk'. His face will straightway wear the expression a Londoner's assumes, when he hears himself frankly styled a Cockney. He is no Turk, no savage, he will assure you, but an Ottoman subject of the Sultan, by no means to be confounded with certain barbarians styled Turcomans, and from whom indeed, on the male side, he may possibly be descended." (Davey 1907: 209)}}

Before 1878, Turks accounted for an estimated one-third of the population of Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ylz4fe7757cC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=crampton+one+third+turks&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=b0o_TZa6LJqK4gboo6zxAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAg#v=snippet&amp;q=%22a%20third%22&amp;f=false |title=A Concise History of Bulgaria - R.

This number declined from 1923–49, when an estimated 220,000 Turks moved from Bulgaria to Turkey, a migration encouraged by the Turkish government. Another wave of about 155,000 left Bulgaria from 1949–51, many of them forcibly expelled.&lt;ref name="Minahan 2002 loc=1613"&gt;{{Harvnb|Minahan|2002|loc=1613}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Crampton, 2007, Bulgaria, pp.&amp;nbsp;431–433&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the government implemented [[Bulgarisation]] policies to limit the cultural and ethnic influence of Bulgarian Turks. Approximately 800,000 Turks were forced to adopt Bulgarian names. Furthermore, Turks were not allowed to attend Muslim ceremonies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Muslims and others: relations in context |last=Waardenburg |first=Jacques |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2003 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |location= |isbn=978-3-11-017627-8 |page=266 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nZaTKpS-9DoC&amp;pg=PA266 |quote=''Anti-Islamic campaigns arose in the nationalist anti-Turkish measures implemented in Bulgaria in the 1980s.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; speak [[Turkish language|Turkish]] in public places, or wear traditional Turkish clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Katsikas|2010|loc=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This led, a few years later, to the biggest exodus in Europe since [[World War II]]: After the Bulgaria–Turkey border was opened in June 1989, approximately 350,000 Turks left Bulgaria on tourist visas in the span of three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Neuburger|2004|loc=82}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, more than 150,000 Turks returned to Bulgaria—especially after the removal of [[Todor Zhivkov]] from power—but more than 200,000 chose to remain in Turkey permanently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eminov|1997|loc=97}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Empire fell]] in the early 20th century, many Turks fled as [[Muhacir]]s (refugees). Others intermarried or simply identified themselves as [[Yugoslavs]] or [[Albanians]] to avoid stigma and persecution.&lt;ref name="Knowlton 2005 loc=66"&gt;{{Harvnb|Knowlton|2005|loc=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, from the Ottoman conquest through the 19th century, many ethnically non-Turkish groups—especially the [[Slavic Muslims]] of the Balkans—were referred to in local languages as Turks. This usage is common in literature, including in the works of [[Ivan Mažuranić]] and [[Petar II Petrović-Njegoš]]. The religious ideology of Christoslavism, coined by [[Michael Sells]], holds that "Slavs are Christian by nature and that any conversion from Christianity is a betrayal of the Slavic race".&lt;ref name="Jacobs2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven L.

====Greece====
{{See also|Turks of the Dodecanese|Cretan Turks|Turks in Western Thrace}}
A long series of events—the [[fall of Constantinople]], Ottoman practices such as the [[Devşirme]], the [[Greek genocide]], the 1955 [[Istanbul pogrom]], the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]], and the [[Aegean dispute]]—contributed to the rise of anti-Turkism in [[Greece]].

Turks have lived in [[Western Thrace]], an area of northeastern Greece, since the Ottoman conquest of the region in the 15th century. In 1922, Turks owned 84% of the land in Western Thrace. Today, however, estimates range from 20–40%, largely because of policies under which ethnic [[Greeks]] were encouraged to purchase Turkish land with [[soft loan]]s granted by the state.&lt;ref name="Whitman 1990 loc=2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Whitman|1990|loc=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hirschon|2003|loc=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turkish government estimates that the Turks of Western Thrace number between 120,000 and 130,000.&lt;ref name="Whitman 1990 loc=i"&gt;{{Harvnb|Whitman|1990|loc=i}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Levinson|1998|loc=41}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Greeks claim that the Muslim population there includes people of various ethnic and religious backgrounds—primarily the [[Pomaks]] (a Slavic people) and the [[Muslim Roma]]—and that [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]] who identify ethnically as Turks are the minority. Thus, the Greek government refers to the Muslims of Western Thrace—whom Turkey sees as the "Turkish community"—as [[Muslim minority of Greece|Greek Muslims]] or Hellenic Muslims, and does not recognise any specific Turkish minority.&lt;ref name="Whitman 1990 loc=i" /&gt; Greek courts have outlawed the use of the word "Turkish" to describe the community. In 1987, the [[Supreme Civil and Criminal Court of Greece|Supreme Court of Greece]] affirmed a 1986 decision in which the Union of Turkish Associations of Western Thrace was ordered closed for illegally using it.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/greece/Greec991-06.htm|title=The Turks of Western Thrace|last=|first=|date=1999|website=|publisher=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court held that the word "Turkish" referred specifically to citizens of Turkey and could not be used to describe citizens of Greece.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Indiana: Indiana University Turkish Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of violent acts by [[Far-right politics|right-wing extremists]] in Germany increased dramatically between 1990 and 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramet|1999|loc=72}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 25, 1992, three Turkish residents were killed in a [[firebombing]] in [[Mölln]], a town in northern Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Solsten|1999|loc=406}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Staab|1998|loc=144}}.&lt;/ref&gt; And on May 29, 1993, in an [[1993 Solingen arson attack|arson attack in Solingen]], five members of a Turkish family that had resided in Germany for 23 years were burnt to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dummett|2001|loc=142}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Several neighbours heard someone shout "[[Heil Hitler]]!" before dousing the front porch and door with gasoline and setting fire to the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1999|loc=331}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Germans condemned these attacks, and many marched in candlelight processions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cornelius|Martin|Hollifield|1994|loc=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Greg Nees, "because Turks are both darker-skinned and Muslim, conservative Germans are largely against granting them citizenship".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nees|2000|loc=155}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malta===
The [[Malta|Maltese]] have a colourful vocabulary stemming from their fight against the Ottoman Empire during the [[Great Siege of Malta]] in 1565. For example, the expression ''tghammed tork'' is used when the sun is visible during rainfall; it means "a Turk has been baptised", which was considered a rare event. The phrase ''twieled tork'' ("a Turk was born") is also used. Another expression is ''haqq ghat-torok'' ("curse on the Turks"), used when something goes wrong.&lt;ref name="Maltaturks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinksite.eu/userfiles/file/Content%20-%20PDFs/Introduction.pdf |format=PDF |title=Introduction |publisher=Thinksite.eu |accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turks are the second-largest ethnic minority group in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Hagendoorn, L., &amp; Hraba, J. (1989). Foreign, different, deviant, seclusive and working class: Anchors to an ethnic hierarchy in the Netherlands. ''Ethnic and Racial Studies'', (12), 441-468.&lt;/ref&gt; Although policies toward Turks in the Netherlands are more progressive than those in many other European countries, such as Germany,&lt;ref&gt;Mendes, H. F. (1994). ''Managing the multicultural society: The policy making process''. Paper presented at the Conference on Today's Youth and Xenophobia: Breaking the Cycle. Wassenaar, Netherlands: Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] criticized Dutch legislation that it said violated Turks' rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Rights Watch|date=2009|quote=''Human Rights Watch world report 2009: Events of 2008''|url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/wr2009_web.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Hrw.org|accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a report on the Netherlands in 2008, the [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]] wrote that the Turkish minority had been particularly affected by "stigmatisation of and discrimination against members of minority groups".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=ECRI|date=2008|title=''Third report on the Netherlands''. Strasbourg, FRANCE : The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance|url=http://hudoc.ecri.coe.int/XMLEcri/ENGLISH/Cycle_03/03_CbC_eng/NLD-CbC-III-2008-3-ENG.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2015-09-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214011219/http://hudoc.ecri.coe.int/XMLEcri/ENGLISH/Cycle_03/03_CbC_eng/NLD-CbC-III-2008-3-ENG.pdf|archive-date=2009-02-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also noted that "the tone of Dutch political and public debate around integration and other issues relevant to ethnic minorities has experienced a dramatic deterioration".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to the [[European Network Against Racism]], an international organisation supported by the [[European Commission]], half of all Turks in the Netherlands report having experienced racial discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Dinsbach, W.|author2=Walz, G.|author3=Boog, I.|date=2009|title=''ENAR shadow report 2008: Racism in the Netherlands''. Brussels, Netherlands: ENAR Netherlands|url=http://cms.horus.be/files/99935/MediaArchive/national/Netherlands%20-%20SR%202008.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Cms.horus.be|accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network also noted "dramatic growth" of [[Islamophobia]] and [[antisemitism]]. In 2001, another international organisation, the [[Fundamental Rights Agency|European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia]], highlighted a negative trend in Dutch attitudes towards minorities, compared with average [[European Union]] results.&lt;ref&gt;Thalhammer, E., Zucha, V., Enzenhofer, E., Salfinger, B., &amp; Ogris, G. (2001). ''Attitudes towards minority groups in the European Union: A special analysis of the Eurobarometer 2000 survey on behalf of the European Monitoring Centre on racism and xenophobia''. Vienna, Austria: EUMC Sora. {{cite web|url=http://www3.northamptonshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/B83E8576-C738-4B93-8191-F36EF740A051/0/europeanunion.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110071706/http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/B83E8576-C738-4B93-8191-F36EF740A051/0/europeanunion.pdf |archivedate=2007-11-10 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; That analysis also noted that, compared to other Europeans, the Dutch were "more in favour of cultural assimilation of minorities" rather than "cultural enrichment by minority groups".

===Russia and former Soviet Union===
{{See also|Turks in the former Soviet Union}}
[[File:Russian poster.JPG|thumb|300px|A [[World War I]] Russian [[propaganda]] poster depicting an imagined Turk running away from a Russian.]]

In the [[Soviet Union]], the [[NKVD]] and the [[Red Army]] carried out [[ethnic cleansing]] during World War II through [[Deportation|mass deportations]] of Turks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ther|Siljak|2001|loc=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1945, [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], the Soviet minister of foreign affairs, formally demanded that Turkey surrender three Armenian provinces ([[Kars Province|Kars]], [[Ardahan]], and [[Artvin Province|Artvin]]), and Moscow was also preparing to support Armenian claims to several other provinces. War against Turkey seemed possible, and [[Joseph Stalin]] wanted to drive out Turks (especially in [[Meskheti]], near the Turkish–Georgian border) who were likely to be hostile to Soviet intentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennigsen|Broxup|1983|loc=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign is relatively poorly documented, but Soviet sources suggest that 115,000 Turks were deported, mainly to [[Central Asia]]. Most of them settled in [[Uzbekistan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cohen|Deng|1998|loc=263}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but many others died along the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topix.com/forum/world/russia/TCPIR4NKRT7T1ADGF|title=Meskhetian Genocide by Russia|work=Topix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, 103 people died and more than 1,000 were wounded in ethnic clashes between Turks and [[Uzbeks]]. Some 700 houses were destroyed, and more than 90,000 Meskhetian Turks were driven out of Uzbekistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schnabel|Carment|2004|loc=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Turks see these events as their "second deportation". Those who remained in Uzbekistan complained of ethnic discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Drobizheva|Gottemoeller|Kelleher|1998|loc=296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some Turks have since come back to Meskheti, the [[Georgians]] and [[Armenians]] who settled in their homes have vowed to take up arms against any who return. Many Georgians have also argued that the Meskhetian Turks should be sent to Turkey, "where they belong".&lt;ref name="Cornell 2001 loc=183"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cornell|2001|loc=183}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, some Turks in Russia, especially Meskhetian Turks in [[Krasnodar Krai|Krasnodar]], have faced human rights violations, including deprivation of citizenship and prohibitions on employment and owning property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barton|Heffernan|Armstrong|2002|loc=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2004, many Turks have left the Krasnodar region for the United States as refugees. They are still barred from full repatriation to Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Coşkun|2009|loc=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arhuaco''', commonly known as '''Ikʉ''', is an [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American]] [[language]] of the [[Chibchan languages|Chibchan language family]], spoken in [[South America]] by the [[Arhuaco people]].&lt;ref name="eth"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=arh Arhuaco], by Arango and Sánchez, Ethnologue, 1998, access date 04-16-08&lt;/ref&gt;

It has 14,800 speakers, all in the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] region of [[Colombia]], 90% of whom are monolingual.&lt;ref name="eth"/&gt; Literacy is 1 to 5% in their native language. Some speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and 15 to 25% are literate in that auxiliary language.&lt;ref name="eth"/&gt; The users have a very strong traditional culture and have vibrant use of their tongue.&lt;ref name="eth"/&gt;

It is also known as: ''Aruaco, Bintuk, Bíntukua, Bintucua, Ica, Ijca, Ijka, Ika, and Ike.''&lt;ref name="eth"/&gt;

[[Russian Census (2002)|2002 census]] recorded population of the federal subject 4,661,219, or 3.21% of the total population of Russia. The city with its vicinity has an estimated population of about 6 million people.

[[File:Spb tram.jpg|thumb|right|Soviet period borough and [[Tramways in Saint Petersburg|tram]]]]
The 2002 census recorded twenty-two ethnic groups of more than two thousand persons each.

Saint Petersburg has always been populated mostly by [[Russians]], albeit with several sizeable ethnic minorities, such as Germans, Ukrainians, Finns, and people from Eastern Europe, among others. In 1800 an estimated 200 to 300 thousand lived in the city.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} After the [[Emancipation reform of 1861|emancipation of serfs]] in 1861, former serfs started arriving to the capital as workers, boosting population from half a million to 1439.6 thousand recorded in the census of 1900.

==Population==
[[File:Saint Petersburg population history.svg|thumb|left]]
Throughout the three centuries the growth of St.&amp;nbsp;Petersburg was accompanied by an increase in population of its surroundings, while the latter to the city were gradually incorporated into the city limits. From an administrative point of view these suburbs ({{lang-ru|пригороды}}, literally ''by the city'') comprised a few [[uezd]]s adjacent to the city, holding an intermediate position between the [[gubernia]] (presently [[oblast]]) as the largest unit in Russia and the city of Petersburg as its center. A known confusion between the ''St.&amp;nbsp;Petersburg / Petrograd / Leningrad Uezd'' (1727—1914—1924–1927; with a rural population of 56002 according to the [[Russian Empire Census|census of 1897]]&lt;ref name="BE_SPb"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

In 1890–1891 the population figures for Petersburg crossed the boundary of 1 million. By 1900 the 38 'plots' comprising the 'city itself' had a population of 1,248,122 while the four abovenamed suburban districts counted 191,491 people.&lt;ref name="BE_SPb" /&gt;

In the 20th century the city experienced three major depopulation trends. The first one began in 1916 (estimates for this year show 2.4 million; this level was surpassed again in 1930–31). In addition to the [[February Revolution]], the sharp deterioration in food supplies in the first months of 1917 caused the flood of certain segments of population to the rural areas of Russia. In 1918 Petrograd without suburbs counted 1,179,256 persons (a 40% decline to 1917), and in 1920 about 740&amp;nbsp;thousand (without troops garrisoned in the city). By that time mobilisations brought the remarkable preponderance of women over men: 100 to 72, not counting the troops.&lt;ref name="RIR1922"&gt;{{cite book

The demobilisation after the end of the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] (1921), the industrial revival which followed the promulgation of [[New Economic Policy]] (March 21, 1921), resumption of the old and opening a lots of new universities and especially colleges led to the increasing influx of population since 1921,&lt;ref name="JSY"&gt;{{cite book

The first [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plans]] (1928–1930, 1931–1935 and 1936–1940) put the [[population growth]] upon the planned basis supported by a '[[propiska in the Soviet Union|propiska]]' residencial quotas introduced at the beginning of the 1930s. It should be noted that in the years of [[industrialization in the USSR]] the influx of population was at the same time accompanied by the annual outflow of tens of thousands of college graduates and workers assigned to another locations of the country on the construction sites and in rural areas from where they came to study in Leningrad.

The German minority in Petersburg began to extinguish at the end of the 19th century (1890 – 4.6%, 1900 – 3.5%); this process accelerated in 1914 with the beginning of the [[First World War]]. The disintegration of the [[Russian Empire]] in 1917–1920 with the secession of [[Finland]], [[Poland]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]] was followed by an outflow of Finns (in 1900 they counted 15638, or 1.3% of citizen), Poles (38314, or 3.1%), Estonians (13401, or 1.1%), Latvians (7097, or 0.6%) and Lithuanians (5666, or 0.4%).&lt;ref name="BE_SPb" /&gt; In 1939 the city has surpassed a 3-million mark,&lt;ref name="JSY" /&gt; however the subsequent mobilisation to the [[Winter War]] (1939–40), the assignments of some part of both military and civilians onto the western territories of the USSR and to a certain extent, the [[population transfer in the Soviet Union|Transfer]] of some Finns still remaining in Leningrad out of the [[Border Security Zone of Russia|border zone of the USSR]] stagnated the 3&amp;nbsp;million population level through the beginning of the [[Great Patriotic War]] in June 1941.&lt;ref name="JSY" /&gt;

The [[Effect of the Siege of Leningrad on the city|impact of the siege]] of Leningrad is estimated as one of the longest, most destructive and [[List of battles by casualties#Sieges and urban combat|costly in terms of casualties]] in human history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/leningrad.htm The Siege of Leningrad, 1941 - 1944]&lt;/ref&gt; Before September 8, 1941 when the city was encircled 336,000 civilians were evacuated with the 86 city industrial enterprises that were dismantled and moved to Northern Russia and Siberia. From September 1941 through April 1942 659,000 civilians were evacuated mainly by watercraft and [[Road of Life|ice road]] over the [[Lake Ladoga|Ladoga]] lake. From May through October 1942 another 403,000 people were evacuated mainly through the waterways of this lake.&lt;ref name="ROL"&gt;{{cite web | title = Road of Life (Russian commemoration of 65th Anniversary of the siege of Leningrad | url = http://www.rian.ru/spravka/20060908/53650404.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080228204938/http://www.rian.ru/spravka/20060908/53650404.html | archivedate = 2008-02-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Not everybody from those 1,298,000 were Leningradians, for some of them fled to the city from surrounding territory seeking a rescue from the German troops. But the worst thing is that many of them died soon after evacuation due to the previous months of starvation within the [[Siege of Leningrad]]. From September, 1941 to January, 1944 670,000 deaths were registered officially, resulting mostly from starvation, stress and exposure. In addition, German shelling and bombings killed 5,723 and wounded 20,507 civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glantz|2001|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistics for 1944 show between 546,000&lt;ref name="JSY" /&gt; and 700,000 Leningradians who managed to undergo the hardships of the blockade. After the siege was lifted, the evacuees were allowed to return, but the main source of renewal of the population of Leningrad in the post-war years was the influx from another parts of the Soviet Union. Only in 1957–1958,&lt;ref name="JSY" /&gt; or 18–19 years after 1939 when the 3-million citizen was born, the city managed to surpass this population mark again. 12 years later, in 1969–1970 the population reached 4&amp;nbsp;million, and in 1988–1989 — 5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="JSY" /&gt;

When the historical maximum was reached in 1990 (less than 5,1&amp;nbsp;million) the whole country has already teetered on the brink of political and economic collapse. The first year when the city has restored its original name, St.&amp;nbsp;Petersburg (1991) was the first in the most lengthy period of the steady population reduction in the city history. By 2003 the city population was less than 4,5&amp;nbsp;million, or at a level of 1977. Among the reasons of this demographic degradation were the increase of [[death rate]] and decrease of [[birth rate]]; halting of inflow of workers due to shutdowns of many of the city’s industries; increased emigration out of the country; closure of many military educational institutions. At the same time a certain inflow to the [[Leningrad Oblast]] (a region surrounding the city) in the 2000s was influenced with the migration from Russia and other ex [[Soviet Republics]], the relocation of officers and their families from places of the overseas deployment of the [[Soviet Army]]. The relevant suburban housing construction was supported both with private and state funding.&lt;ref&gt;Чистякова Н. [http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2004/0163/tema01.php Третье сокращение численности населения… и последнее?] ''Демоскоп Weekly'' 163 – 164, August 1–15, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Чистяков А. Ю. [http://www.encspb.ru/ru/article.php?kod=2804035787 Население (обзорная статья)]. ''Энциклопедия Санкт-Петербурга''&lt;/ref&gt; The long-term excess of [[death]]s over [[birth]]s has brought a noticeable [[population ageing]]. The average age is about 40 years, and people of 65 years and older comprise more than 20% of the population, while the life expectancy in Russia has fallen under 60 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gov.spb.ru/gov/admin/otrasl/trud/demogr/pokazately Основные показатели социально-демографической ситуации в Санкт-Петербурге] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010155112/http://gov.spb.ru/gov/admin/otrasl/trud/demogr/pokazately |date=October 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Periods of temporary economic recovery accompanied by an increase in demand for unskilled labor (road and construction workers, janitors, porters, drivers etc.) pose a problem of migrant workers under a new, unexpected angle. In the Soviet planned economy this demand was covered by the stable inflow of labourers from the central regions of Russia and the European Republics of the USSR. They were favored with both job and dwelling guarantees (initially housed in the dorms, after a certain period they received a new living space from the state). Now the labour sourcing geographical [[azimuth]] has changed to the ex republics of Caucasus, Middle Asia and Moldavia known by the lesser professional skill of newcomers. Apart from that, more and more labourers now migrate to St.&amp;nbsp;Petersburg from the Far East and Turkey. It changes the labour market conditions for people from Russia and other ex-Soviet Republics, despite the fact that the latter were taught [[Russian language]] from their childhood.

==Housing==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2008}}
People in urban Saint Petersburg mostly live in apartment blocks. Between 1918 and 1990s, the Soviets [[nationalised]] housing and many were forced to share their apartments as communal apartments (''[[Communal apartment|kommunalkas]]'') with other residents of the city. In the 1930s some 68 percent of the Leningrad population lived in shared apartments. Leningrad was the largest city of the Soviet Union by the number of ''kommunalkas''. As new boroughs were built on the outskirts in the 1950s-1980s, over half a million low-income families eventually received free apartments, and additional hundred thousand condos were purchased by the middle class. Today, economic and social activity remains concentrated in and around the [[Central Saint Petersburg|city centre]], which is the richest part of the city; the new boroughs have mostly served a [[commuter area]] function, with people living in large multi-storied apartment blocks and travelling to and from the city centre for work. Their [[gentrification]] has yet to begin. Although progress has been made in resettling residents of ''kommunalkas'' in the 1990s, shared apartments are still not uncommon. In the last 15 years of de-nationalisation, most of the residential property has been transferred free of charge, or at a small fraction of its value, to millions of legal residents of St. Petersburg.

'''Digital journalism'''  also known as '''online journalism''' is a contemporary form of journalism where editorial content is distributed via the [[Internet]] as opposed to publishing via [[Printing|print]] or [[broadcast]]. What constitutes 'digital journalism' is debated by scholars. However the primary product of journalism, which is news and features on current affairs, is presented solely or in combination as [[Text (literary theory)|text]], [[Digital audio|audio]], [[video]], or some [[Interactive media|interactive forms]] like [[newsgame]]s, and disseminated through [[digital media]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Franklin|first= Bob |year=2013 |title=Digital Journalism", 1:1, p. 1. DOI: 10.1080/21670811.2012.740264 |accessdate=February 2, 2014 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21670811.2012.740264#.UvhjORYhzzI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kawamoto 2003, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fewer [[barriers to entry]], lowered distribution costs, and diverse [[computer networking]] technologies have led to the widespread practice of digital journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=John |year=2000 |title= Journalism in the Digital Age: Theory and Practice for Broadcast, Print and On-line Media |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis |page= 9 |accessdate=February 10, 2014 |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=FqBEv0bwBzoC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=widespread+practice+of+digital+journalism&amp;ots=BmB2Yb90gs&amp;sig=r6EYA2rTynjKqXQsHKHQwVOgjRI#v=onepage&amp;q=widespread%20practice%20of%20digital%20journalism&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has democratized the flow of information that was previously controlled by traditional media including newspapers, magazines, radio, and television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boler|first= Megan |year=2010|title=Digital Media and Democracy: Tactics in Hard Times |publisher= MIT Press |page= 385|accessdate= February 10, 2014 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4bv-eeLkG6YC&amp;dq=democratization+digital+journalism&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have asserted that a greater degree of creativity can be exercised with digital journalism when compared to traditional journalism and traditional media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kawamoto|first= Kevin  |year=2003|title= Digital Journalism: Emerging Media and the Changing Horizons of Journalism|publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=2|accessdate=February 9, 2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dG9vHwHyDFUC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The digital aspect may be central to the journalistic message and remains, to some extent, within the creative control of the writer, editor, and/or publisher.&lt;ref&gt;Kawamoto 2003, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

There is no absolute agreement as to what constitutes digital journalism. Mu Lin argues that "Web and mobile platforms demand us to adopt a platform-free mindset for an all-inclusive production approach – create the (digital) contents first, then distribute via appropriate platforms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mulinblog.com/what-is-digital-first-media-a-primer-for-journalism-students/|title=A primer for journalism students: What is digital-first strategy?|work=MulinBlog: A digital journalism blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; The repurposing of print content for an online audience is sufficient for some, while others require content created with the digital medium's unique features like [[hypertext]]uality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Fondevila |last1=Gascón|first2= Joan |last2=Francesc |first3= Segura|last3= Herlaynne |year=2012|title=Hipertextuality in digital journalism in Colombia |work=Hipertext.net.

"Multimedia, digital press and journalistic genres in Catalonia and in Spain: an empirical analysis". Communication Studies Journal, n. 7, May 2010, pp. 81-95.&lt;/ref&gt; For Deuze, online journalism can be functionally differentiated from other kinds of journalism by its technological component which journalists have to consider when creating or displaying content.&lt;ref name="auto8"&gt;Deuze 2003, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; Digital journalistic work may range from purely editorial content like CNN (produced by professional journalists) online to public-connectivity websites like Slashdot (communication lacking formal barriers of entry).&lt;ref&gt;Deuze 2003, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; The difference of digital journalism from traditional journalism may be in its reconceptualised role of the reporter in relation to audiences and news organizations.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Wall 2005, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; The expectations of society for instant information was important for the evolution of digital journalism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

. However, it is likely that the exact nature and roles of digital journalism will not be fully known for some time.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

==History==
The first type of digital journalism, called [[teletext]], was invented in the UK in 1970. Teletext is a system allowing viewers to choose which stories they wish to read and see it immediately. The information provided through teletext is brief and instant, similar to the information seen in digital journalism today.  {{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The information was broadcast between the frames of a television signal in what was called the Vertical Blanking Interval or VBI.

American journalist, Hunter S. Thompson relied on early digital communication technology beginning by using a fax machine to report from the 1971 US presidential campaign trail as documented in his book [[Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail]].

After the invention of teletext was the invention of [[videotex]], of which [[Prestel]] was the world's first system, launching commercially in 1979&lt;ref&gt;Kawamoto 2005, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; with various British newspapers such as the [[Financial Times]] lining up to deliver newspaper stories online through it. Videotex closed down in 1986 due to failing to meet end-user demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Third Wave of Online Journalism|url= http://www.ojr.org/ojr/future/1019174689.php|publisher=ojr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American newspaper companies took notice of the new technology and created their own videotex systems, the largest and most ambitious being Viewtron, a service of Knight-Ridder launched in 1981. Others were Keycom in Chicago and Gateway in Los Angeles. All of them had closed by 1986.

Next came computer Bulletin Board Systems. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, several smaller newspapers started online news services using BBS software and telephone modems. The first of these was the Albuquerque Tribune in 1989.

''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in September 1992 [[breaking news|broke the news]] of [[Electronic Arts]]' acquisition of [[Origin Systems]] on [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]], before its next issue went to press.&lt;ref name="wilson199212"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&amp;pub=2&amp;id=101 | title=Anatomy of a Rumor | work=Computer Gaming World | date=1992&lt;!-- -12 --&gt; | accessdate=5 July 2014 | author=Wilson, Johnny L. | pages=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online news websites began to proliferate in the 1990s.  An early adopter was ''[[The News &amp; Observer]]'' in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] which offered online news as [[Nando]]. Steve Yelvington wrote on the [[Poynter Institute]] website about [[Nando]], owned by The N&amp;O, by saying "Nando evolved into the first serious, professional [[news site]] on the World Wide Web".{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} It originated in the early 1990s as "NandO Land".  It is believed that a major increase in digital online journalism occurred around this time when the first commercial web browsers, [[Netscape Navigator]] (1994), and [[Internet Explorer]] (1995).&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Scott 2005, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1996, most news outlets had an online presence. Although journalistic content was repurposed from original text/video/audio sources without change in substance, it could be consumed in different ways because of its online form through toolbars, topically grouped content, and intertextual links. A twenty-four-hour news cycle and new ways of user-journalist interaction web boards were among the features unique to the digital format. Later, portals such as AOL and Yahoo! and their [[news aggregator]]s (sites that collect and categorize links from news sources) led to news agencies such as The Associated Press to supplying digitally suited content for aggregation beyond the limit of what client news providers could use in the past.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

Also, ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', was founded in 1995. In 2001 the ''[[American Journalism Review]]'' called ''Salon'' the Internet's "preeminent independent venue for journalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ajr.org/article.asp?id=314 |title=Can Salon Make It? |first= Paul |last=Fahri |publisher=American Journalism Review|volume= March 2001 |accessdate= July 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, for the first time, more Americans reported getting their national and international news from the internet, rather than newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tossed By A Gale|work=The Economist|date=May 14, 2009|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13642689}}{{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young people aged 18 to 29 now primarily get their news via the Internet, according to a Pew Research Center report.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;{{cite web|last=Peters|first=Meghan|title=Internet Surpasses Television as Main News Source for Young Adults [STUDY].|url=http://mashable.com/2011/01/04/internet-surpasses-television-as-main-news-source-for-young-adults-study/|publisher=Mashable|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences to news sites continued to grow due to the launch of new news sites, continued investment in news online by conventional news organizations, and the continued growth in internet audiences overall.&lt;ref name="Pew09-5"&gt;{{cite web |title=The State of the Online News Media 2009 |work=Pew Project For Excellence in Journalism. |url=http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2009/narrative_online_intro.php?media=5 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316185250/http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2009/narrative_online_intro.php?media=5 |archivedate=2010-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty-five percent of youth now primarily access the news online.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;

Mainstream news sites are the most widespread form of online newsmedia production.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt; As of 2000, the vast majority of journalists in the Western world now use the internet regularly in their daily work.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt; In addition to mainstream news sites, digital journalism is found in index and category sites (sites without much original content but many links to existing news sites), meta- and comment sites (sites about newsmedia issues like media watchdogs), and [[Virtual community|share and discussion sites]] (sites that facilitate the connection of people, like [[Slashdot]]).&lt;ref&gt;Deuze 2003, p. 208-211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kawamoto 2005, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Blogs are also another digital journalism phenomenon capable of fresh information, ranging from personal sites to those with audiences of hundreds of thousands.&lt;ref&gt;Kawamoto 2005, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Digital journalism is involved in the cloud journalism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Fondevila |last1=Gascón|first2= Joan |last2=Francesc |year=2010 |title=El cloud journalism: un nuevo concepto de producción para el periodismo del siglo XXI |journal= Observatorio (OBS*) |volume= 4, Núm. 1 (2010) |pages= 19–35 |issn= 1646-5954 |url=http://obs.obercom.pt/index.php/obs/article/view/315/321}}&lt;/ref&gt; phenomenon, a constant flow of contents in the Broadband Society.&lt;ref&gt;Fondevila Gascón, Joan Francesc (2009).

Portafolio CTS. {{ISSN|1850-0013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 2008, the industry had hoped that publishing news online would prove lucrative enough to fund the costs of conventional newsgathering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Newspapers And Thinking the Unthinkable|author=Clay Shirky|date=March 13, 2009|url=http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2009/03/newspapers-and-thinking-the-unthinkable/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, however, [[online advertising]] began to slow down, and little progress was made towards development of new business models.&lt;ref name="Pew09-5"/&gt;  The Pew [[Project for Excellence in Journalism]] describes its 2008 report on the State of the News Media, its sixth, as its bleakest ever.&lt;ref&gt;"The State of the News Media" Pew Project For Excellence in Journalism. [http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2009/narrative_overview_intro.php?media=1 Stateofthemedia.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the uncertainty, online journalists report expanding newsrooms. They believe advertising is likely to be the best revenue model supporting the production of online news.&lt;ref&gt;"Online Journalists Optimistic About Revenue and Technology, Concerned About Changing Values" Pew Project For Excellence in Journalism. [http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2009/narrative_survey_intro.php?media=3 Stateofthemedia.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many news organizations based in other media also distribute news online, but the amount they use of the new medium varies.  Some news organizations use the Web exclusively or as a secondary outlet for their content. The [[Online News Association]], founded in 1999, is the largest organization representing online journalists, with more than 1,700 members whose principal livelihood involves gathering or producing news for digital presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journalists.org/?page=onamission|title=Online News Association|author=Online News Association|work=journalists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet challenges traditional news organizations in several ways. Newspapers may lose [[classified advertising]] to websites, which are often targeted by interest instead of geography. These organizations are concerned about real and perceived loss of viewers and circulation to the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pew Research Journalism Project|url=http://www.journalism.org/2014/03/26/state-of-the-news-media-2014-key-indicators-in-media-and-news/|website=Journalism.org|accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyperlocal journalism is journalism within a very small community. Hyperlocal journalism, like other types of digital journalism, is very convenient for the reader and offers more information than former types of journalism. It is free or inexpensive.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on readers==
Digital journalism allows for connection and discussion at levels that print does not offer on its own.  People can comment on articles and start discussion boards to discuss articles. Before the Internet, spontaneous discussion between readers who had never met was impossible. The process of discussing a news item is a big portion of what makes for digital journalism.  People add to the story and connect with other people who want to discuss the topic.

Digital journalism creates an opportunity for [[niche audience]]s, allowing people to have more options as to what to view and read.

Digital journalism opens up new ways of storytelling; through the technical components of the new medium, digital journalists can provide a variety of media, such as [[sound|audio]], [[video]], and [[digital photography]].

Digital journalism represents a revolution of how news is consumed by society. Online sources are able to provide quick, efficient, and accurate [[Reporter|reporting]] of breaking news in a matter of seconds, providing society with a synopsis of events as they occur. Throughout the development of the event, journalists are able to feed online sources the information keeping readers up-to-date in mere seconds. The speed in which a story can be posted can affect the accuracy of the reporting in a way that doesn't usually happen in print journalism. Before the emergence of digital journalism the printing process took much more time, allowing for the discovery and correction of errors.

News consumers must become Web literate and use [[critical thinking]] to evaluate the credibility of sources.  Because it is possible for anyone to write articles and post them on the Internet, the definition of journalism is changing. Because it is becoming increasingly simple for the average person to have an impact in the news world through tools like blogs and even comments on news stories on reputable [[Online newspaper|news websites]], it becomes increasingly difficult to sift through the [[Information overload|massive amount of information]] coming in from the digital area of journalism.

There are great advantages with digital journalism and the new [[blogging]] evolution that people are becoming accustomed to, but there are disadvantages. For instance, people are used to what they already know and can't always catch up quickly with the new technologies in the 21st century. The goals of print and digital journalism are the same, although different tools are needed to function.

The interaction between the writer and consumer is new, and this can be credited to digital journalism. There are many ways to get personal thoughts on the Web. There are some disadvantages to this, however, the main one being [[Formal verification|factual information]]. There is a pressing need for accuracy in digital journalism, and until they find a way to press accuracy, they will still face some criticism.

One major dispute regards the credibility of these online news websites. A digital journalism credibility study performed by the [[Online News Association]] compares the online public credibility ratings to actual media respondent credibility ratings. Looking at a variety of online media sources, the study found that overall the public saw online media as more credible than it actually is.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mjbear.com/presentations/AUSTIN.ppt&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of digital journalism are evident worldwide. This form of journalism has pushed journalists to reform and evolve. Older journalists who are not tech savvy have felt the blunt force of this. In recent months, a number of older journalists have been pushed out and younger journalists brought in because of their lower cost and ability to work in advanced technology settings.

==Impact on publishers==
Many newspapers, such as ''[[The New York Times]]'', have created [[Online newspaper|online sites]] to remain competitive and have taken advantage of audio, video, and text linking to remain at the top of news consumers' lists as most of the news enthusiasm now reach their base through hand held devices such as smart phones, tables etc. Hence audio or video backing is definite advantage. 

Newspapers rarely break news stories any more, with most websites reporting on breaking news before the cable news channels.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} Digital journalism allows for reports to start out vague and generalized, and progress to a better story. Newspapers and TV cable are at a disadvantage because they generally can only put together stories when an ample amount of detail and information are available.  Often, newspapers have to wait for the next day, or even two days later if it is a late-breaking story, before being able to publish it. Newspapers lose a lot of ground to their online counterparts, with [[advertising|ad revenue]] shifting to the Internet, and subscription to the printed paper decreasing. People are now able to find the news they want, when they want, without having to leave their homes or pay to receive the news {{citation needed|date=September 2011}}, even though there are still people who are willing to pay for online journalistic content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Himma-Kadakas |first1=Marju |last2=Kõuts |first2=Ragne |title=Who Is Willing to Pay for Online Journalistic Content? |journal=Media and Communication |volume=3 |issue=4 |doi=10.17645/mac.v3i4.345 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/article/view/345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of this, many people have viewed digital journalism as the death of journalism.{{who|date=February 2011}} According to communication scholar Nicole Cohen, "four practices stand out as putting pressure on traditional journalism production: outsourcing, unpaid labour, metrics and measurement, and automation".&lt;ref name="Cohen 98–122"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Nicole S.|date=2015-04-03|title=From Pink Slips to Pink Slime: Transforming Media Labor in a Digital Age|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10714421.2015.1031996|journal=The Communication Review|volume=18|issue=2|pages=98–122|doi=10.1080/10714421.2015.1031996|issn=1071-4421}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free advertising on websites such as [[Craigslist]] has transformed how people publicize; the Internet has created a faster, cheaper way for people to get news out, thus creating the shift in ad sales from standard newspapers to the Internet. There has been a substantial effect of digital journalism and media on the newspaper industry, with the creation of new business models.&lt;ref&gt;Fondevila Gascón, Joan Francesc; Del Olmo Arriaga, Josep Lluís and Sierra Sánchez, Javier (2011). "New communicative markets, new business models in the digital press". Trípodos (Extra 2011-VI International Conference on Communication and Reality-Life without Media, Universitat Ramon Llull), pp. 301-310.&lt;/ref&gt; It is now possible to contemplate a time in the near future when major towns will no longer have a newspaper and when magazines and network news operations will employ no more than a handful of reporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zcommunications.org/the-death-and-life-of-great-american-newspapers-by-john-nichols|title=zcommunications.org Is For Sale|author=|date=|website=www.zcommunications.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many newspapers and individual print journalists have been forced out of business because of the popularity of digital journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=6973782&amp;page=1|title=Extra, Extra: Is It the End for Newspapers?|author=ABC News|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspapers that have not been willing to be forced out of business have attempted to survive by saving money, laying off staff, shrinking the size of the publications, eliminating editions, as well as partnering with other businesses to share coverage and content.&lt;ref&gt;http://multimedia.journalism.berkeley.edu/tutorials/digital-transform/print-editions-decline/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, one study concluded that most journalists are ready to compete in a digital world and that these journalists believe the transition from print to digital journalism in their newsroom is moving too slowly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mediamanagementcenter.org/research/lifebeyondprint.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Some highly specialized positions in the publishing industry have become obsolete. The growth in digital journalism and the [[Financial crisis (2007–present)|near collapse of the economy]] has also led to [[Layoff|downsizing]] for those in the industry.

Students wishing to become journalists now need to be familiar with digital journalism in order to be able to contribute and develop journalism skills. Not only must a journalist analyze their audience and focus on effective communication with them, they have to be quick; news websites are able to update their stories within minutes of the news event. Other skills may include creating a website and uploading informaiton using basic programming skills. 

Critics believe digital journalism has made it easier for individuals who are not qualified journalists to misinform the general public. Many believe that this form of journalism has created a number of sites that do not have credible information. Sites such as [[Perez Hilton|PerezHilton.com]] have been criticized for blurring the lines between journalism and opinionated writing.

Some critics believe that newspapers should not switch to a solely Internet-based format, but instead keep a component of print as well as digital.

Digital journalism allows citizens and readers the opportunity to join in on [[threaded discussion]]s relating to a news article that has been read by the public. This offers an excellent source for writers and reporters to decide what is important and what should be omitted in the future. These threads can provide useful information to writers of digital journalism so that future articles can be pruned and improved to possibly create a better article the next time around.

== Implications on traditional Journalism ==
[[Digitizing|Digitization]] is currently causing many changes to traditional journalistic practice. The labour of journalists in general is becoming increasingly dependant on digital journalism. Scholars outline that this is actually a change to the execution of journalism and not the conception part of the [[Labor process theory|labour process]].&lt;ref name="Örnebring 57–74"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Örnebring|first=Henrik|date=2010-02-03|title=Technology and journalism-as-labour: Historical perspectives|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1464884909350644|journal=Journalism|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=57–74|doi=10.1177/1464884909350644}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also contend that this is simply the de-skilling of some skills and the up-skilling of others.&lt;ref name="Örnebring 57–74"/&gt; This theory is in contention to the notion that [[technological determinism]] is negatively effecting [[journalism]], as it should be understood that it is just changing the traditional skill set.&lt;ref name="Örnebring 57–74"/&gt; Communication scholar Nicole Cohen believes there are several trends putting pressure on this traditional skill set. Some of which being [[outsourcing]], [[algorithm]]s, and [[automation]].&lt;ref name="Cohen 98–122"/&gt; Although she believes that technology could be used to improve Journalism, she feels the current trends in digital journalism are so far affecting the practice in a negative way.&lt;ref name="Cohen 98–122"/&gt;

There is also the impact that digital journalism is facing due to citizen journalism. Because digital journalism takes place online and is contributed mostly by citizens on user generated content sites, there is competition growing between the two. Citizen journalism allows anyone to post anything, and because of that, journalists are being forced by their employers to publish more news content than before, which often means rushing news stories and failing to confirm information.

==Work outside traditional press==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
The Internet has also given rise to more participation by people who are not normally journalists, such as with Indy Media (Max Perez).

[[Bloggers]] write on [[web logs]] or [[blogs]]. Traditional journalists often do not consider bloggers to automatically be journalists. This has more to do with standards and professional practices than the medium. For instance, crowdsourcing and crowdfunding journalism attracts amateur journalists, as well as ambitious professionals that are restrained by the boundaries set by traditional press. However, the implication of these types of journalism is that it disregards the professional norms of journalistic practices that ensures accuracy and impartiality of the content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Andrea|date=2014-11-24|title=Crowdfunding independent and freelance journalism: Negotiating journalistic norms of autonomy and objectivity|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1461444814558915|journal=New Media &amp; Society|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=272–288|doi=10.1177/1461444814558915}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But, {{As of|2005|lc=on}}, blogging has generally gained at least more attention and has led to some effects on mainstream journalism, such as exposing problems related to a television piece about President [[George W. Bush]]'s National Guard Service.

Recent legal judgements have determined that bloggers are entitled to the same protections as other journalists subject to the same responsibilities. In the United States, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] [https://www.eff.org/cases/apple-v-does/ has been instrumental] in advocating for the [https://www.eff.org/cases/apple-v-does/ rights of journalist bloggers].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/dockets.cfm?dist=6&amp;doc_id=285455&amp;doc_no=H028579|title=California Courts - Appellate Court Case Information|publisher=ca.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]], the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled that:"[96] A second preliminary question is what the new defence should be called. In arguments before us, the defence was referred to as the responsible journalism test. This has the value of capturing the essence of the defence in succinct style. However, the traditional media are rapidly being complemented by new ways of communicating on matters of public interest, many of them online, which do not involve journalists. These new disseminators of news and information should, absent good reasons for exclusion, be subject to the same laws as established media outlets. I agree with Lord Hoffmann that the new defence is "available to anyone who publishes material of public interest in any medium": Jameel, at para. 54."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/7837/index.do|title=Grant v. Torstar Corp. - SCC Cases (Lexum)|author=|date=|website=scc-csc.lexum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other significant tools of on-line journalism are Internet [[Internet forum|forums]], [[discussion boards]] and [[online chat|chat]]s, especially those representing the Internet version of official media. The widespread use of the Internet all over the world created a unique opportunity to create a meeting place for both sides in many conflicts, such as the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] and the [[First Chechen War|First]] and [[Second Chechen War]]s. Often this gives a unique chance to find new, alternative solutions to the conflict, but often the Internet is turned into the battlefield by contradicting parties creating endless "online battles."

[[Internet radio]] and [[podcast]]s are other growing independent media based on the Internet.

==Blogs==
With the rise of digital media, there is a move from the traditional journalist to the blogger or amateur journalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theendofjournalism.wdfiles.com/local--files/lydiamiljan/lydia+miljan.pdf|title=The file does not exist|author=|date=|website=theendofjournalism.wdfiles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blogs can be seen as a new genre of journalism because of their "narrative style of news characterized by personalization" that moves away from traditional journalism's approach,&lt;ref&gt;Wall 2005, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; changing journalism into a more conversational and decentralized type of news.&lt;ref name="auto10"&gt;Wall 2005, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Blogging has become a large part of the transmitting of news and ideas across cites, states, and countries, and bloggers argue that blogs themselves are now breaking stories.&lt;ref name="auto10"/&gt; Even online news publications have blogs that are written by their affiliated journalists or other respected writers.  Blogging allows readers and journalists to be opinionated about the news and talk about it in an open environment.  Blogs allow comments where some news outlets do not, due to the need to [[Moderation system|constantly monitor]] what is posted.  By allowing comments, the reader can interact with a story instead of just absorbing the words on the screen. According to one 2007 study, 15% of those who read blogs read them for news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Synovate survey: New study shows Americans' blogging behaviour |url=http://www.synovate.com/news/article/2007/08/new-study-shows-americans-blogging-behaviour.html |publisher=synovate.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815015005/http://www.synovate.com/news/article/2007/08/new-study-shows-americans-blogging-behaviour.html |archivedate=2011-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many blogs are highly opinionated and have a [[bias]]. Some are not verified to be true. The [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) established guidelines mandating that bloggers disclose any free goods or services they receive from third parties in 2009 in response to a question of the integrity of product and service reviews in the online community.&lt;ref&gt;http://ftc.gov/os/2009/10/091005revisedendorsementguides.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2009/10/endortest.shtm|title=FTC Publishes Final Guides Governing Endorsements, Testimonials|work=ftc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Citizen journalism==
Digital journalism's lack of a traditional "editor" has given rise to [[citizen journalism]]. The early advances that the digital age offered journalism were faster research, easier editing, conveniences, and a faster delivery time for articles. The Internet has broadened the effect that the digital age has on journalism. Because of the popularity of the Internet, most people have access, and can add their forms of journalism to the information network. This allows anyone who wants to share something they deem important that has happened in their community. Individuals who are not professional journalists who present news through their blogs or websites are often referred to as citizen journalists. One does not need a &lt;!-- college? --&gt;[[Academic degree|degree]] to be a citizen journalist. Citizen journalists are able to publish information that may not be reported otherwise, and the public has a greater opportunity to be informed. Some companies use the information that a citizen journalist relays when they themselves can not access certain situations, for example, in countries where [[freedom of the press]] is limited. Anyone can [[Internet video|record]] events happening and send it anywhere they wish, or put it on their website. Non-profit and grass roots digital journalism sites may have far fewer resources than their corporate counterparts, yet due to digital media are able to have websites that are technically comparable.&lt;ref&gt;Kawamoto 2003, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Other media outlets can then pick up their story and run with it as they please, thus allowing information to reach wider audiences.

For citizen journalism to be effective and successful, there needs to be citizen editors, their role being to solicit other people to provide accurate information and to mediate interactivity among users. An example can be found in the start up of the South Korean online daily newspaper, [[OhMyNews]], where the founder recruited several hundred volunteer "citizen reporters" to write news articles which were edited and processed by four professional journalists.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2011, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
One emerging problem with online journalism in the United States is that, in many states, individuals who publish only on the Web do not enjoy the same [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights as reporters who work for traditional print or broadcast media. As a result, unlike a [[newspaper]], they are much more liable for such things as [[libel]]. In California, however, protection of [[anonymous blog]] sources was ruled to be the same for both kinds of journalism. ''O'Grady v. Superior Court'', 44 Cal. Rptr. 3d 72 (Cal. Ct. App. 2006); ''O'Grady v. Superior Court'', 44 Cal. Rptr. 3d 72, 139 Cal.App. 4th 1423, modified by ''O'Grady v. Superior Court'', 140 Cal.App. 4th 675b, 2006.

=== Extra-jurisdictional enforcement ===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
In [[Canada]] there are more ambiguities, as Canadian libel law permits suits to succeed even if no false statements of fact are involved, and even if matters of public controversy are being discussed. In [[British Columbia]], as part of "a spate of lawsuits" against online news sites, according to legal columnist [[Michael Geist]], several cases have put key issues in online journalism up for rulings. Geist mentioned that [[Green Party of Canada]] financier Wayne Crookes filed a suit in which he alleged damages for an online news service that republished resignation letters from that party and let users summarize claims they contained. He had demanded access to all the anonymous sources confirming the insider information, which Geist believed would be extremely prejudicial to online journalism. The lawsuit, "Crookes versus openpolitics", attracted attention from the BBC and major newspapers, perhaps because of its humorous name. Crookes had also objected to satire published on the site, including use of the name "gang of Crookes" for his allies. Subsequently, Crookes sued Geist, expanding the circle of liability. Crookes also sued [[Google]], Wikipedia, [[Yahoo]], [[PBwiki]], domain registrars and Green bloggers who he felt were associated with his political opponents. Crookes' attempt to enforce BC's plaintiff-friendly libel laws on California, Ontario and other jurisdictions led to an immediate backlash in bad publicity but the legal issues remain somewhat unresolved as of November 2009. Crookes lost four times on the grounds that he had not shown anyone in BC had actually read the materials on the minor websites, but this left the major question unresolved: How to deal with commentary deemed fair in one jurisdiction but actionable in another, and how to ensure that universal rights to free speech and reputation are balanced in a way that does not lead to radically different outcomes for two people who might for instance participate in a conversation on the Internet.

=== Right to reply or refactor ===
{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}

=== International issues ===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
Non-democratic regimes that do not respect international human rights law present special challenges for online journalism:
* Persons reporting from those regimes or with relatives under those regimes may be intimidated, harassed, tortured or killed and the risk of their exposure generally rises if they become involved in a private dispute and are subjected to civil discovery, or if a plaintiff or police officer or government official pressures an international service provider to disclose their identity.
* If print and broadcast journalists are excluded, unverifiable reports from persons on the spot (as during the Iran election crisis of 2009) may be the only way to relay news at all—each individual incident may be unverifiable though statistically a much more representative sample of events might be gathered this way if enough citizens are participating in gathering the news.
* Court processes that do not explicitly respect the rights of fair comment on public issues, political expression in general, religious freedoms, the right to dissent government decisions or oppose power figures, could be imposed on persons who merely comment on a blog or wiki. If judgments can be enforced at a distance, this may require expensive legal responses or chill on comment while cases move through a remote court, with the proceedings possibly even being heard in a foreign language under rules the commentator never heard of before. If people from relatively free countries engage in conversations with those from oppressive countries, for instance on homosexuality, they may actually contribute to exposing and loss of human rights by their correspondents.

==News collections==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
The Internet also offers options such as personalized news feeds and [[News aggregator|aggregators]], which compile news from different websites into one site. One of the most popular news aggregators is [[Google News]]. Others include  [[Topix.net]], and [[TheFreeLibrary.com]].

But, some people see too much personalization as detrimental. For example, some fear that people will have narrower exposure to news, seeking out only those commentators who already agree with them.

As of March 2005, [[Wikinews]] rewrites articles from other news organizations. Original reporting remains a challenge on the Internet as the burdens of verification and legal risks (especially from plaintiff-friendly jurisdictions like BC) remain high in the absence of any net-wide approach to defamation.&lt;ref&gt;O'Grady v. Superior Court, 44 Cal. Rptr. 3d 72, 139 Cal.App. 4th 1423, modified by O'Grady v. Superior Court, 140 Cal.App. 4th 675b, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Sagarin''' (September 18, 1913 – June 10, 1986), also known by his pen name '''Donald Webster Cory''', was an American professor of sociology and [[criminology]] at the [[City University of New York]], and a writer. His book ''The Homosexual in America: A Subjective Approach'', published in 1951, was considered "one of the most influential works in the history of the [[gay rights movement]]," and inspired compassion in others by highlighting the difficulties faced by homosexuals.&lt;ref name="glbtq"&gt;Summers, Claude J. [http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/sagarin_e.html Encyclopedia of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and queer culture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606151656/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/sagarin_e.html |date=June 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stonewall"/&gt;

He was titled "father of the homophile movement" for asserting that gay men and lesbians deserved [[civil rights]] as members of a large, unrecognised [[minority group|minority]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, David K. (2005) [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_km4448/is_200510/ai_n16260907 Encyclopedia of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender History in America]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Vern L. Bullough believes the title is undeserved as Sagarin did not actively participate in resistance and did not join any homophile organisations until 1962, a time when he was seeking a topic to analyse in his thesis.&lt;ref name="stonewall"&gt;Bullough, Vern L. (2002) New York: Harrington Park Press. &lt;!-- Page 342 --&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=A7x_VnES2esC&amp;pg=PA342&amp;lpg=PA342&amp;dq=edward+sagarin+biography&amp;source=web&amp;ots=HE3TL_P79_&amp;sig=3_uNpfStX71s0OsblJGAXn4iUKU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result#PPA342,M1 ''Before Stonewall: Activists for Gay and Lesbian Rights in Historical Context''] {{ISBN|1-56023-192-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Sagarin was born in [[Schenectady, New York]] to [[History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union|Russian Jewish]] parents. Sagarin was born with [[scoliosis]], which produced a hump on his back. He attended high school, and after graduating, spent a year in France where he met [[André Gide]]. Upon his return to New York, he enrolled at [[City College of New York]], but was forced to drop out of college due to the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name="glbtq"/&gt;

In 1934, Sagarin met Gertrude Liphshitz, a woman who shared his left-wing political interests. They married in 1936 and soon after, Gertrude gave birth to a boy. Sagarin established himself in the perfume and cosmetics industry, becoming knowledgeable about the chemistry of perfumes, and publishing ''The Science and Art of Perfumery'' in 1945.&lt;ref name="glbtq"/&gt;

===Donald Webster Cory===
Sagarin began a dual life, publishing ''The Homosexual in America: A Subjective Approach'' in 1951, which was deemed an "act of heroism", under the pseudonym of Donald Webster Cory.&lt;ref name="politics"/&gt; The use of the [[nom de plume]], and the attitudes that differed when Sagarin used either of his identities, led to the comparison of Sagarin/Cory to the [[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Dr. Jekyll/Mr Hyde]] character. Mr. Cory, who presented homosexuals as a despised minority, was seen as a "mythic hero", where Dr. Sagarin (as he would later be known) was a "hunchback deviant".&lt;ref name="mask"&gt;Sears, James T. (2006) New York: Harrington Park Press. &lt;!-- Page 529 --&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=7cJgYcce7SgC&amp;pg=PA529&amp;lpg=PA529&amp;dq=edward+sagarin+biography&amp;source=web&amp;ots=eZ5qOJvYqS&amp;sig=92GkE_Wg20F-WsyK_Q4Cw4y_ULc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPA529,M1 ''Behind the Mask of the Mattachine''] {{ISBN|1-56023-186-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of the book was considered a "radical step", as it was the first publication in the United States that discussed homosexual politics and sympathetically presented the plight of homosexuals.&lt;ref name="politics"&gt;Mark Blasius &amp; Shane Phelan (1997) New York: Routledge. &lt;!-- Page 275 --&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hsw22TEOS80C&amp;pg=PA275&amp;lpg=PA275&amp;dq=Donald+Webster+Cory&amp;source=web&amp;ots=D5UvwRlmN_&amp;sig=m7s6YpantdbRx3mY_eDeFuyn3ZE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result#PPA275,M1 ''We are Everywhere: A Historical Sourcebook of Gay and Lesbian Politics''] {{ISBN|0-415-90859-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sagarin described how homosexuals were discriminated against in almost all aspects of their lives and called for a [[repeal]] of anti-homosexuality laws;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
One great gap separates the homosexual minority from all others, and that is its lack of recognition, its lack of respectability in the eyes of the public, and even in the most advanced circles.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A research report by [[Alfred Kinsey]] ''et al.'', ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Male]]'' (1948), had a beneficial effect on the reception of Sagarin's publication. In 1952, due to the success of ''The Homosexual in America: A Subjective Approach'', Sagarin established a subscription book service called "Cory Book Service", which chose a gay-themed literary work each month.&lt;ref name="glbtq"/&gt;

Sagarin continued using his pseudonym, and released a second publication in 1953 called ''Twenty-One Variations on a Theme'', an anthology of short stories dealing with homosexuality to which included pieces by [[Sherwood Anderson]], [[Paul Bowles]], [[Christopher Isherwood]], [[Denton Welch]], [[Charles R. Jackson|Charles Jackson]], and [[Stefan Zweig]].&lt;ref name="glbtq"/&gt;

===1960s===
In 1958 Sagarin joined [[Brooklyn College]], completing his BA in an accelerated program, and in 1961 he entered an MA program in sociology, where he wrote a thesis on ''The Anatomy of Dirty Words''. Throughout the 1960s, Cory remained one of the most conservative members of the [[Mattachine Society]], and opposed the rejection of the "sickness theory" of homosexuality by some homophile leaders. His belief was that homosexuality was "a disturbance" that probably arose as a result of a pathological family situation. In 1963, he co-authored a book called ''The Homosexual and His Society'' with John LeRoy (pseudonym of Barry Sheer), which claimed that there was no such thing as a "well adjusted homosexual". In 1965 as Cory, he failed in his bid for presidency of the Mattachine Society. The loss of the presidency, and his difference in beliefs from other members of the Society, resulted in a disparity that directly influenced his education. Sagarin entered [[New York University]]'s PhD program in sociology, graduating in 1966, submitting a dissertation titled "Structure and Ideology in an Association of Deviants", which was a study of the Mattachine Society. He did not, however, reveal his involvement in the society as Cory. His acceptance of the position of assistant professor at [[Baruch College]], a campus of City University of New York, led some to characterise it as the beginning of his rise to "giant in the field of sociological deviance" and the recession of his part in the homophile movement.&lt;ref name="mask"/&gt;

===1970s===
In the 1970s, Sagarin pursued an active homosexual life, though he continued to characterise homosexuals as disturbed, and frequently urged them to seek therapy. He rejected the idea that homosexuality was a natural sexual variant, and criticised the new psychological and sociological studies of [[Evelyn Hooker]] and [[John Gagnon]]. However, he argued that homosexuality should be decriminalized.&lt;ref name="glbtq"/&gt;

The real identity of Sagarin's persona, Donald Webster Cory, remained unknown until a 1974 convention of the [[American Sociological Society]] in Montreal. On a panel entitled "Theoretical Perspectives on Homosexuality", Sagarin levelled criticism at the liberationist scholarship, and in response, [[Laud Humphreys]] exposed Sagarin by calling him "Mr. Cory". After the convention, Sagarin withdrew from issues concerning homosexuality.&lt;ref name="glbtq"/&gt;

On June 10, 1986, he died of a heart attack. At the time, he was serving as Dean Of The Graduate School Of The John Jay College Of Criminal Justice
in NYC.

'''Elizabeth Fry''' (née '''Gurney''', often referred to as ''Betsy''; 21 May 1780 – 12 October 1845) was an [[England|English]] [[prison reform]]er, [[social reform]]er and, as a [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]], a [[Christian]] [[philanthropist]]. She has sometimes been referred to as the "angel of prisons".

Fry was a major driving force behind new legislation to make the treatment of prisoners more humane, and she was supported in her efforts by [[Queen Victoria]]. She was depicted on the [[Bank of England £5 note]] from 2001–2016. Fry kept extensive and revealing diaries.

==Birth and family background==
Elizabeth Fry was born in Gurney Court, off Magdalen Street, [[Norwich]], [[Norfolk, England|Norfolk]], England into a prominent [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] family, the [[Gurney family (Norwich)|Gurneys]]. Her childhood family home was [[Earlham Hall]], which is now part of the [[University of East Anglia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.uea.ac.uk/cm/home/schools/ssf/law/EHall Earlham Hall, UEA]&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, [[John Gurney (1749–1809)]], was a partner in [[Gurney's Bank]]. Her mother, Catherine, was a member of the Barclay family who were among the founders of [[Barclays Bank]]. Her mother died when Elizabeth was twelve years old. As one of the oldest girls in the family, Elizabeth was partly responsible for the care and education of the younger children, including her brother [[Joseph John Gurney]], a philanthropist. One of her sisters was [[Louisa Gurney Hoare]] (1784–1836), a writer on education.

==Awakening of social concern==
[[File:Elizabeth Fry - Project Gutenberg etext 13103.jpg|thumb|Elizabeth Fry]]
According to her diary Elizabeth was moved by the preaching of [[Priscilla Buxton|Priscilla Hannah Gurney]], Deborah Darby and [[William Savery]]. Unlike her direct family she recognised the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;Francisca de Haan, ‘Fry , Elizabeth (1780–1845)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2007 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10208, accessed 18 Sept 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
She met [[Joseph Fry (tea merchant)|Joseph Fry]] (1777–1861), a banker and part of the Fry's chocolate-making family, who was also a Quaker, when she was 20 years old. They married on 19 August 1800 at the Norwich Goat Lane Friends Meeting House and moved to St Mildred's Court in the [[City of London]]. Elizabeth Fry was recorded as a [[Recorded Minister|minister]] of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] in 1811.

Joseph and Elizabeth Fry lived in Plashet House in [[East Ham]] between 1809 and 1829, then moved to The Cedars on Portway in [[Forest Gate]], where they lived until 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Stratford, West Ham &amp; The Royal Docks| last=Pewsey| first=Stephen| year=1996| publisher=Sutton Publishing| isbn=0-7509-1417-3| page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = WEST HAM PARK, Newham - 1001685 | publisher = Historic England | accessdate = 22 March 2018 | url = https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1001685}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had eleven children, five sons and six daughters:

==Prison work==
[[File:Mrs. Fry reading to the prisoners in Newgate John Johnson.jpg|thumbnail|right|Fry reading to inmates in Newgate prison]]
Prompted by a family friend, [[Stephen Grellet]], Fry visited [[Newgate Prison]] in 1813. The conditions she saw there horrified her.&lt;ref name=quakers&gt;[http://www.quakersintheworld.org/quakers-in-action/13/Elizabeth-Fry "Elizabeth Fry", Quakers in the World]&lt;/ref&gt; The women's section was overcrowded with women and children, some of whom had not even received a trial. The prisoners did their own cooking and washing in the small cells in which they slept on straw.

She returned the following day with food and clothes for some prisoners. She was unable to personally further her work for nearly four years because of difficulties within the Fry family, including financial difficulties in the Fry bank{{clarify|date=June 2016}}. 
Fry returned in 1816 and was eventually able to fund a prison school for the children who were imprisoned with their mothers. Rather than attempt to impose discipline on the women, she suggested rules and then asked the prisoners to vote on them. In 1817 she helped found the ''Association for the Reformation of the Female Prisoners in Newgate''. This association provided materials for women so that they could learn to sew and knit and once they were out of prison and then could earn money for themselves.&lt;ref name=howard&gt;[http://www.howardleague.org/elizabethfry/ "Elizabeth Fry", The Howard League for Penal Reform] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327215033/http://www.howardleague.org/elizabethfry/ |date=27 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the eventual creation of the ''British Ladies' Society for Promoting the Reformation of Female Prisoners'' in 1821.&lt;ref name=lyd/&gt; She also promoted the idea of rehabilitation instead of harsh punishment which was taken on by the city authorities in London as well as many other authorities and prisons.

In 1827, Fry visited women prisoners in Ireland (see ''Memoirs of Mrs. Elizabeth Fry'', Thomas Timpson, NY: Stanford &amp; Swords, 1847, pp. 82-99).

Elizabeth Fry also campaigned for the rights and welfare of prisoners who were being [[Penal transportation to Australia|transported]]. The women of Newgate Prison were taken through the streets of London in open carts, often in chains, huddled together with their few possessions. They were pelted with rotten food and filth by the people of the city. The fear was often enough to make women condemned to transportation riot on the evening before. Fry's first action was to persuade the Governor of Newgate prison to send the women in closed carriages and spare them this last indignity before transportation. She visited prison ships and persuaded captains to implement systems to ensure each woman and child would at least get a share of food and water on the long journey. Later she arranged each woman to be given scraps of material and sewing tools so that they could use the long journey to make quilts and have something to sell as well as useful skills when they reached their destination. She also included a bible and useful items such as string and knives and forks in this vital care package.
Elizabeth Fry visited 106 transport ships and saw 12,000 convicts. Her work helped to start a movement for the abolition of transportation. Transportation was officially abolished in 1837, however Elizabeth Fry was still visiting transportation ships until 1843.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Elizabeth Fry: Britain's Second Lady on the Five-Pound Note, Dennis Bardens, {{ISBN|0954197356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth Fry wrote in her book ''Prisons in Scotland and the North of England'' that she stayed the night in some of the prisons and invited nobility to come and stay and see for themselves the conditions prisoners lived in. Her kindness helped her gain the friendship of the prisoners and they began to try to improve their conditions for themselves. [[Thomas Fowell Buxton]], Fry's brother-in-law, was elected to Parliament for [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] and began to promote her work among his fellow MPs. In 1818 Fry gave evidence to a [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] committee on the conditions prevalent in British prisons, becoming the first woman to present evidence in Parliament.

==Humanitarian work==
Elizabeth Fry also helped the [[homeless]], establishing a "nightly shelter" in [[London]] after seeing the body of a young boy in the winter of 1819/1820. In 1824, during a visit to [[Brighton]], she instituted the Brighton District Visiting Society.&lt;ref name=quakers/&gt; The society arranged for volunteers to visit the homes of the poor and provide help and comfort to them. The plan was successful and was duplicated in other districts and towns across Britain.

Elizabeth Fry used her influential network and worked with other prominent Quakers to campaign for the abolition of the slave trade.

After her husband went bankrupt in 1828, Fry's brother became her business manager and benefactor. Thanks to him, her work went on and expanded.

In 1838 the Friends sent a party to France. Fry and her husband, [[Lydia Irving]], and abolitionists [[Josiah Forster]] and [[William Allen (Quaker)|William Allen]]. They were there on other business but despite the language barrier Fry and Lydia Irving visited French prisons.&lt;ref name=lyd&gt;Amanda Phillips, ‘Irving, Lydia (1797–1893)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/58591, accessed 20 June 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1840 Fry opened a training school for nurses. Her programme inspired [[Florence Nightingale]], who took a team of Fry's nurses to assist wounded soldiers in the [[Crimean War]].

In 1842, [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] went to see Fry in [[Newgate Prison]] during an official visit to Great Britain. The [[King of Prussia]], who had met the social reformer during her previous tours of the continent promoting welfare change and humanitarianism, was so impressed by her work that he told his reluctant courtiers that he would personally visit the gaol when he was in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Kelly|last=Grovier|title=The Gaol|publisher=[[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]]|page=278|ISBN=978-0-7195-6133-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation==
One admirer was [[Queen Victoria]], who granted her an audience a few times before she was Queen and contributed money to her cause after she ascended to the throne.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Another admirer was [[Robert Peel]] who passed several acts to further her cause including the Gaols Act 1823. The act was largely ineffective, because there were no inspectors to make sure that it was being followed.

Following her death in 1845, a meeting chaired by the Lord Mayor of London, resolved that it would be fitting "to found an [[Poorhouse|asylum]] to perpetuate the memory of Mrs Fry and further the benevolent objects to which her life had been devoted."{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} A fine 18th-century town house was purchased at 195 Mare Street, in the London Borough of Hackney and the first Elizabeth Fry refuge opened its doors in 1849. Funding came via subscriptions from various city companies and private individuals, supplemented by income from the inmates' laundry and needlework. Such training was an important part of the refuge's work. In 1924, the refuge merged with the Manor House Refuge for the Destitute, in Dalston in Hackney, becoming a hostel for girls on probation for minor offences {{Citation needed|reason=no source cited on whether any crimes were "minor"|date=August 2016}}. The hostel soon moved to larger premises in Highbury, Islington and then, in 1958, to Reading, where it remains today. The original building in Hackney became the CIU New Lansdowne Club but became vacant in 2000 and has fallen into disrepair. [[Hackney Council]], in 2009, was leading efforts to restore the building and bring it back into use. The building did undergo substantial refurbishment work in 2012 but as of July 2013, the entire building is for sale. The building and Elizabeth Fry are commemorated by a plaque at the entrance gateway.

==Death==
Fry died from a [[stroke]] in Ramsgate, England, on 12 October 1845. Her remains were buried in the [[Religious Society of Friends|Friends]]' burial ground at [[Barking, London|Barking]].&lt;ref name=quakers/&gt; Seamen of the Ramsgate Coast Guard flew their flag at half mast in respect of Mrs Fry; a practice that until this occasion had been officially reserved for the death of a ruling monarch.&lt;ref&gt;'Memoirs of Mrs. Elizabeth Fry' (second edition) by Rev. Thomas Timpson. London : Aylott and Jones, 1847&lt;/ref&gt;
More than a thousand people stood in silence during the burial at the Ramsgate memorial

==Memorials==
[[File:Reformers Monument, Kensal Green Cemetery (detail).JPG|thumb|Elizabeth Fry's name on the Reformers Monument, [[Kensal Green Cemetery]]]]
[[File:Fry.JPG|thumb|Fry's statue in the [[Old Bailey]]]]
There are a number of memorials which commemorate places where Fry lived. There are plaques located at her birthplace of Gurney Court in [[Norwich]]; her childhood home of Earlham Hall; St. Mildred's Court, [[City of London]], where she lived when she was first married; and Arklow House, her final home and place of death in [[Ramsgate]]. Her name heads the list on the southern face of the Reformers Monument in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]], [[London]]. She is depicted in stained glass at [[All Saints' Church, Cambridge|All Saints Church, Cambridge]] alongside [[Edith Cavell]] and [[Josephine Butler]].

Due to her work as a prison reformer, there are several memorials to Elizabeth Fry. One of the buildings which make up the Home Office headquarters, [[2 Marsham Street|2 Marsham St]], is named after her. She is also commemorated in prisons and courthouses, including a terracotta bust in the gatehouse of [[HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs]] and a stone statue in the [[Old Bailey]]. The [[Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry Societies]] honours her memory by advocating for women who are in the criminal justice system. They also celebrate and promote a National Elizabeth Fry Week in [[Canada]] each May.

Elizabeth Fry is also commemorated in a number of educational and care-based settings. The [[University of East Anglia]]'s School of Social Work and Psychology is housed in a building named after her. There is an Elizabeth Fry Ward at [[Scarborough General Hospital]] in [[North Yorkshire]], [[United Kingdom]]. A road is named for Fry at [[Guilford College]], a school in Greensboro, North Carolina, which was founded by Quakers. There is a bust of Elizabeth Fry located in East Ham Library, Newham Borough of London.

Quakers also acknowledge Elizabeth Fry as a prominent member. Her grave at the former [[Society of Friends]] Burial Ground, located off Whiting Avenue in [[Barking, London|Barking]], Essex, was restored and received a new commemorative marble plinth in October 2003. In February 2007, a plaque was erected in her honour at the Friends Meeting House in Upper Goat Lane, Norwich. Fry is also depicted in the [[Quaker Tapestry]], on panels E5 and E6. She is also honoured by other Christian denominations. In the Lady Chapel of Manchester's Anglican Cathedral, one of the portrait windows of Noble Women on the west wall of the Chapel features Elizabeth Fry. The Church of England includes her on its [https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts/the-calendar/holydays.aspx liturgical calendar] on Oct. 12.

Since 2001, Fry has been depicted on the reverse of [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|£5 notes]] issued by the [[Bank of England note issues|Bank of England]]. She is shown reading to prisoners at Newgate Prison. The design also incorporates a key, representing the key to the prison which was awarded to Fry in recognition of her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/current/current_5.htm|title=Current Banknotes £5 Note (Elizabeth Fry)|publisher=Bank of England|accessdate=2008-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of 2016, Fry's image on these notes was replaced by that of [[Winston Churchill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Katie|journal=The Guardian|date=26 April 2013 |title=New £5 note replaces Elizabeth Fry with Sir Winston Churchill|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/26/winston-churchill-new-five-pound-note|accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was one of the social reformers honoured on an issue of UK commemorative stamps in 1976.

Fry kept extensive diaries which give unique insight into her work, life and personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2005|title=The transcription and notation of Elizabeth Fry's journal 1780-1845|url=http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/6298|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She died in [[Philadelphia]] in 1908.

==Early years and education==
Esther Pugh, daughter of Achilles and Anna Maria Pugh, was born in [[Cincinnati]], Ohio, August 31, 1834. Her parents were [[Quakers]]. For many years, the father was a journalist in Cincinnati, and publisher of the "Chronicle". Pugh received a good education.{{sfn|Indiana Yearly Meeting of Friends|1905|p=171}}

==Career==
[[File:EstherPugh.png|thumb|left|Esther Pugh]]
Early on, Pugh became interested in moral reforms, and soon became prominent in the [[Temperance movement in the United States|temperance movement]]. She was one of the leaders in the movement, joining the WCTU during its first meetings.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=591}} She served as Treasurer of the National WCTU for 15 years, and her management style repeatedly aided the national order in passing through financial difficulties. Considered to be a clear and forcible orator, she traveled for temperance work throughout the United States and Canada, lecturing and organizing unions. Pugh's association with [[Frances E. Willard]] was enduring.{{sfn|Indiana Yearly Meeting of Friends|1905|p=171}} 

Succeeding [[Mary Towne Burt]],{{sfn|Hanaford|1883|p=407}} Pugh served as publisher and editor of the monthly temperance journal, ''Our Union'', for years.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=591}}{{sfn|Rowell|1882|p=278}} According to Gifford (1995), Pugh, Frances H. Rastall and [[Caroline Buell]] used the ''Union Signal'' (the paper's name after its merger with ''The Signal'') to promote their private businesses.{{sfn|Willard|1995|p=385}} Because of her journalistic experience, Pugh was called upon to provide guidance for the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]]'s periodical, ''Woman's Home Missions'', regarding [[typeset]] and how to make up a "dummy".{{sfn|Board of Managers of the Woman's Home Missionary Society|1882|p=99}}

Pugh's work in the WCTU, beginning in Cincinnati, caused her residence at different times to be in [[Columbus, Ohio]], [[Cleveland, Ohio]], [[Brooklyn, New York]], and [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], though made her home is in [[Evanston, Illinois]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=591}} She served an Elder in the [[Religious Society of Friends|Friends church]].

During the [[French Algeria|French colonial period]] (1830–1962), [[Algeria]] contained a large [[European ethnic groups|European]] population of 1.6 million who constituted 15.2% of the total population in 1962. Consisting primarily of [[French people]], other populations included [[Spaniards]] in the west of the country, [[Italians]] and [[Maltese people|Maltese]] in the east, and other Europeans in smaller numbers. Known as ''[[Pied-noir|Pieds-Noirs]]'', European colonists were concentrated on the coast and formed a majority of the population of [[Oran]] (60%) and important proportions in other large cities like in the capital [[Algiers]] and [[Bône]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Cook, Bernard A. | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=Europe since 1945: an encyclopedia | year=2001 | publisher=Garland | location=New York  | isbn=0-8153-4057-5 | pages=398}}&lt;/ref&gt; In religion, they were mostly [[Roman Catholic]] [[Christians]].&lt;ref name="Naylor"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = University Press of Florida| isbn = 0-8130-3096-X| pages =9–23,&amp;nbsp;14|last = Naylor| first = Phillip Chiviges| title = France and Algeria: A History of Decolonization and Transformation | year = 2000|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZMUb8R3Cs-MC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=pied+noir+alienation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871, [[Algerian Jews|the indigenous Jews]] obtained the French nationality, and they were also considered as pieds noirs.{{cn|date=February 2014}}

However, the indigenous [[Algerian people|Algerian]] [[Muslim]]s remained a large majority of the territory's population throughout its history, and before the invasion and colonization of Algeria by France, Europeans were practically absent.
Gradually, dissatisfaction among the Muslim population with its lack of political rights (Muslims were denied French citizenship and the right to vote or to be elected) and economic status fueled calls for greater political autonomy and eventually independence from France. Tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954, when the first violent events of what was later called the [[Algerian War]] began. The very bloody and bitter war concluded in 1962 when Algeria gained complete independence following the March 1962 [[Evian agreements]] on July 3, 1962. This was the exodus for the ''pieds noirs''.

On the eve and during Algerian independence in 1962, more than one million ''Pied-Noir'' settlers of French nationality immediately fled or were evacuated to mainland France. However, with continuing violence and discrimination by the Algerian state and people against the remaining settlers, most of the remainder of the population of 100,000 people (less than 1% of the population) who stayed after 1962, also fled during the 1960s. The ''Pieds-Noirs'' felt unable to return to their birthplace, Algeria, because of the independence movement's violence and resentment felt against the former ''Pied-Noir'' settlers by the FLN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Grappling with ghosts:In its post-colonial era, France rethinks its identity.|accessdate=2007-12-25 |work=Monday, 6 March 2006  |publisher=In the Fray, Identity Magazine Group|url=http://www.inthefray.com/html/article.php?sid=1564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fang''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɒ|ŋ}} is a Central African language spoken by around 1 million people in Cameroon, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, São Tomé and Príncipe, and the Congo Republic. It is the dominant [[Bantu language]] of [[Gabon]] and [[Equatorial Guinea]]. It is related to the [[Bulu language|Bulu]] and [[Ewondo language|Ewondo]] languages of southern [[Cameroon]]. Fang is spoken in northern Gabon, southern Cameroon, throughout Equatorial Guinea, in the Republic of the Congo, and small fractions of the islands of São Tomé and Príncipe. Under President [[Francisco Macías Nguema|Macías Nguema]], Fang was the official language of Equatorial Guinea.

There are many different variants of Fang in Gabon and Cameroon. Maho (2009) lists Southwest Fang as a distinct language. The other dialects are Ntoumou, Okak, Mekê, Atsi (Batsi), Nzaman (Zaman), Mveni, and Mvaïe.

==Corpus and lexicology==

Despite lacking any truly certain corpus of Fang's literary body, it is of note that linguists have, in the past, made attempts to compile dictionaries and lexicons for the Fang language. The two most notable ones to be either proposed or fully compiled were made by Maillard (2007){{refn|Ella, Edgar Maillard (2007-03). A Theoretical Model For a Fang-French-English Specialized Multi-Volume School Dictionary.}} and Bibang (2014). Neither created a direct Fang-English dictionary, but opted instead to separate the two languages via a third European language as a bridge for various loanwords.

The translation efforts to English have been done through Romance languages: specifically, Spanish and French. The latter of the two languages would likely have had the most impact on the language, given the occupation of Gabon by the French during the existence of French Equatorial Africa (itself part of French West Africa), which lasted 75 years from 1885 to 1960. To a lesser extent, in São Tomé and Príncipe, Portuguese also likely has influenced the dialects of Fang present there, due to the country being occupied by Portugal for most of the islands' history of habitation.

==Phonology{{refn|Bibang Oyee, Julián-Bibang (2014). Diccionario Español-Fang/Fang-Español. Akal.}}==

===Vowels===

Fang has 7 vowels, each of which can have short or long realizations.

{|class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"

! [[Front vowel|Front]] ([[Vowel length|short/long]])!! [[Back vowel|Back]] (short/long)

[[Nasal vowel|Nasal vowels]] are allophones of the respective oral vowels, when followed by a nasal consonant {{IPA|[ŋ]}} or {{IPA|[ɲ]}}. Words can not start with {{IPA|[ɛ]}}, {{IPA|[i]}}, {{IPA|[ɔ]}} nor {{IPA|[u]}}.

====Diphthongs====
Diphthongs can be a combination of any vowel with {{IPA|[j]}} or {{IPA|[w]}}, as well as {{IPA|[ea]}}, {{IPA|[oe]}}, {{IPA|[oa]}}, {{IPA|[ua]}}.

===Tone===

Fang distinguishes between 4 different tones, conventionally called: high, low, rising and falling. The former two are simple tones, while the latter are compound tones. One vowel in a sequences of vowels can be elided in casual speech, though its tone remains and attaches to the remaining vowel. {{refn|Bibang Oyee, Julián (1990). Curso de lengua fang. Centro Cultural Hispano-Guineano}}

===Consonants===
In Fang, there are 24 plain consonants. The majority of them can become [[Prenasalized consonant|prenasalized]]:

{{IPA|/h/}} is only used in interjections and loanwords.
Words can not start with {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, except when followed by a velar consonant. {{IPA|/ɾ/}} and {{IPA|/z/}} also are restricted from word-initial position. {{IPA|/g/}} and {{IPA|/p/}} can only come in word-initial position in words of foreign origin, although in many of these cases, {{IPA|/g/}} becomes realized as {{IPA|[ŋg]}}.

The morpheme "gh" is pronounced as {{IPA|ɾ}} in the case of the word "Beyoghe" (the Fang term for Libreville); one of several changes to pronunciation by morphology.

It is also important to note that in Fang, at every "hiatus" (shock of two vowels), such as in "Ma adzi", it is required for one to make the second word an aphetism, dropping the pronunciation of the {{IPA|aː}} sound at the start of the second word (e.g. "Ma dzi") in order to make grammatically correct sentences.

==Phrases==

Although the Fang language does not have an official orthography, native speakers happen to use the extended Latin alphabet with specific accents. Due to the enormous geographic region it covers, and the large amount of Fang dialects, the following list may not be entirely accurate; one issue of note is the lack of marking for tones. Regardless, common phrases for the [[Oyem]] area of northern Gabon include:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! English
! Fang
|-
| Hello (to one person)
|M'bolo/Mbolo
|-
| Hello (to several people)

A '''Faroese Dane''' is a resident of [[Denmark]] with a [[Faroese Islanders|Faroese]] ethnic background.

==Statistics==
In 2006, 21,687 people of Faroese descent were recorded in Denmark, a figure almost half the population of the [[Faroe Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://politiken.dk/indland/article166953.ece | title=Færøske unge flygter til Danmark | publisher=Politiken | date=30 August 2006 | accessdate=7 November 2015 | language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On average each year, not fewer than 240 Faroese move to Denmark from Faroe Islands, which is about 0.5% of the Faroese population.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Numerous ''Feldgeister'' are known in German folklore, some shaped as animals, some in human form. The last grain heads and tree fruits are often left at their place as a sacrifice for the agricultural spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Felix Dahn, Therese Dahn: ''Germanische Götter- und Heldensagen'', p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; During harvest season ''Feldgeister'' flee deeper into the fields to escape the mowers. With the last cornstalks the corn spirit becomes trapped. Either it is killed by cutting the grain heads, threshing the corn or it is brought to the village in a ceremonial manner, shaped as a corn doll.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Golther, ''Germanische Mythologie'', pp. 200f.&lt;/ref&gt; Direct contact to the ''Feldgeist'' causes illness.&lt;ref name=Mannhardt-2&gt;Mannhardt, ''Die Korndämonen'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another cattle-shaped spirit present in the fields in springtime is the ''Märzenkalb'' or ''Märzkalb'' (both "march calf").&lt;ref name=Mannhardt-9/&gt;

==== ''Haferbock '' and ''Habergeiß'' ====

The ''Haferbock'' ("oat buck")&lt;ref name=Golther-200/&gt; or ''Erntebock'' ("harvest buck")&lt;ref&gt;Grimm, ''Deutsche Mythologie'', p. 1209.&lt;/ref&gt; is a he-[[goat]] spirit. This ''Feldgeist'' is also known as ''Austbock'' ("harvest buck"),&lt;ref name=Mannhardt-2/&gt; ''Halmbock'' ("haulm buck"),&lt;ref name=Mannhardt-3/&gt; ''Erbsenbock'' ("pea buck"), ''Kornbock'' ("corn buck"),&lt;ref name=Mannhardt-4/&gt; ''Roggenbock'' ("rye buck"), ''Arftenbuck'' ("pea buck"), ''Bohnenbock'' ("bean buck"),&lt;ref&gt;Mannhardt, ''Wald- und Feldkulte: Band II'', p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nickelbock''&lt;ref name=Mannhardt-158&gt;Mannhardt, ''Wald- und Feldkulte: Band II'', p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Haberbock'' ("oat buck"),&lt;ref name=Mannhardt-165&gt;Mannhardt, ''Wald- und Feldkulte: Band II'', p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Grasbock'' ("grass buck"), ''Heubock'' ("hay buck") or ''Baumbock'' ("tree buck").&lt;ref name=Mannhardt-171&gt;Mannhardt, ''Wald- und Feldkulte: Band II'', p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; At Christmas the buck fertilizes the fruit tree.&lt;ref name=Mannhardt-4/&gt;

The cry of the ''Habergeiß'' pronounces springtime as well as bad luck. Someone who imitates the cry of the ''Habergeiß'' will get punishment. The ''Habergeiß'' hunts, scratches or even eats the meddlesome one. If not, it wil hang itself as a bloody coat at the crier's door. This corn demon also slaps people looking out of the window at night or takes part in the [[wild hunt]], is also the mount of the devil. In heavy thunderstorm the ''Habergeiß'' bring cut grain from one field to another foreign field. The appearance of the ''Habergeiß'' causes bad luck. The corn will spoil, the cows will lose weight, give no milk and felt. When the cry of the ''Habergeiß'' is heard in autumn this means a long winter and lack of hay.&lt;ref&gt;Mannhardt,''Wald- und Feldkulte: Band II'', p. 181f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both ''Haferbock'' and ''Habergeiß'' steal, hit or kill children.&lt;ref name=Mannhardt-158/&gt;

The ''Roggenmuhme'' also chases children at speeds simultaneous to a running horse. She blows the eyelight of children out, and pounds children in her iron butter churn. The ''Roggenmuhme'' is said to be the mother of the ''Roggenwölfe'' ("rye wolves") and can, herself, also be in the form of a wolf. Sometimes the ''Roggenmuhme'' is accompanied by little dogs who lead children into her iron hug.&lt;ref name=Mannhardt-20/&gt;

The ''Roggenmuhme'' walks through the corn field looking for food. She eats the grain, either all or just the very towering spikes. When the corn is bad or dried up, the ''Roggenmuhme'' punishes the farmer. A ''Roggenmuhme'' striding the fields is an indicator of a good harvest.&lt;ref name=Mannhardt-21&gt;Mannhardt, ''Die Korndämonen'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Roggenmuhme'' is also known to pester the maidservants who were not fully spinning their [[distaff]]s until [[Twelfth Night]].&lt;ref name=Grimm-370&gt;Grimm, ''Deutsche Mythologie'', p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Hafermann'' ===

The ''Hafermann'' ("oat man")&lt;ref name=Golther-200/&gt; is a male corn demon who steals children. He throws an iron [[Shillelagh (club)|shillelagh]]. Wearing a big black hat and having a giant stick in his hand, the ''Hafermann'' waits for passants to kidnap them through the air.&lt;ref&gt;Mannhardt, ''Die Korndämonen'', p. 23f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other names for the ''Hafermann'' are ''Getreidemann'' ("grain man"),  ''der Alte'' ("the old one"),&lt;ref name=Golther-200/&gt; ''Heidemann'' ("heath man"), ''Heidemänneken'' ("little heath man"),&lt;ref name="Felix Dahn p. 593"&gt;Felix Dahn, Therese Dahn, ''Germanische Götter- und Heldensagen'', p. 593.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kornjude'' ("corn [[Jew]]"), who is said to be Jewish,&lt;ref&gt;Otto Holzapfel, ''Lexikon der abendländischen Mythologie'', p.&amp;nbsp;239.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kornmann'' ("corn man"), ''der schwarze Mann'' ("the black man"), ''der wilde Mann'' ("the wild man"), ''Grummetkerl'' ("hay guy"), ''Getreidemännchen'' ("little grain man"), ''Kleemännchen'' ("little clover man"), ''Grasteufel'' ("grass devil"),&lt;ref name=Mannhardt-23/&gt; ''Roggenmann'' ("rye man"), ''Weizenmann'' ("wheat man"), ''Gerstenmann''("barley man"), ''Erntemann'' ("harvest man"), ''Schewekerl'', ''de grîse mann'' ("the grey man")&lt;ref&gt;Mannhardt, ''Die Korndämonen'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Erdäpfelmann'' ("potato man").&lt;ref&gt;Mannhardt, ''Die Korndämonen'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

A creature of similar name if not identical is the ''Heidmann'' ("heath man"). This [[ghost]] looks at night through the windows of a house and the person he looks at must die in year and day.&lt;ref&gt;Grimm, ''Deutsche Mythologie'', p. 870.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Der böse Sämann'' ("the evil sower"), another male corn demon, can be cast out by going over the fields with burning wisps of straw at the first day of fasting period.&lt;ref&gt;Grimm, ''Deutsche Mythologie'', p. 1321.&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that the ''Säemann'' ("sower") is the owner of the ''Saathahn'' ("seed rooster"), a bird which is associated with seed. The ''Saathahn'' is to be gathered by going out on the fields with a bag full of green shrubbery.&lt;ref name=Mannhardt-18/&gt;

The ''Haferbräutigam''  ("oat bridegroom") is a younger ''Hafermann''.&lt;ref name=Mannhardt-30/&gt;

=== ''Kornkind'' ===

The ''Kornkind'' ("corn child") or ''Ährenkind'' ("grain head child") is a corn spirit shaped as a child.&lt;ref name=Golther-200/&gt; It is identical with the fruit of the field which is "born" by harvest. Other names for the ''Kornkind'' are ''das Kind'' ("the child"), ''Erntekind'' ("harvest child"), ''Hôrputtel'', ''Hôrkind'' and ''Hurenbalg'' (all "prostitute's child") and ''Reppekindchen''.

=== ''Haferkönig'' and ''Haferkönigin'' ===

The ''Haferkönig'' ("oat king") and ''Haferkönigin'' ("oat queen") are the rulers of all field spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Mannhardt, ''Die Korndämonen'', p. 27f.&lt;/ref&gt; Other names are ''Kong'' ("king"),&lt;ref&gt;Mannhardt, ''Die Korndämonen'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lattichkönig'' ("lettuce king") and ''Maigraf'' ("may earl").&lt;ref name=Mannhardt-30/&gt;

The ''Bilwis'' is a male or female&lt;ref name=Golther-201&gt;Golther, ''Germanische Mythologie'', p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; corn spirit of sometimes demonic or sometimes human origin. It has flying hair, is wrapped in white [[linen]] and wears a little triangular hat. The ''Bilwis'' rolls through the corn shaped as a destructive giant ball or appears as a [[whirlwind]] to steal grain during harvest season. Both can be repelled by throwing a knife with three crosses on its blade on the ''Bilwis'', shouting: ''"Da hast du es, Bilbze!"'' ("There you have it, ''Bilwis''!").&lt;ref name=Bechstein-381&gt;Bechstein, ''Deutsches Sagenbuch'', p. 381f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sorcerers acting as ''Bilwis'' and helpful methods against them are described by [[Ludwig Bechstein]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Even today, and this is popular belief, there are also such ''Bilsenschnitter'' (''Bilwisse''), that are people, going out to the fields very early at the days of ''Himmelfahrt'' (either [[Ascension of Jesus]] or [[Assumption of Mary|Mary]]), [[St John's Eve]] or [[Trinity Sunday]], barefooted, a little sickle-shaped knife bond to the big toe of the right foot. They step through the seed and cut a line with the knife through it. At the time of harvest and threshing the tenth part of the fruit of such a field must bestow on the ''Bilsenschnitter''. However, the business is associated with great danger. Will the ''Bilsenschnitter'' be called by someone or will be shot over him with a shotgun, then he has to die in the same year. When he notices and addresses the arrival earlier, the fate of death comes upon the other. Most farmers try to save themselves against the damage threatening their fields in such a way by plowing and sowing the field from outside first, because in grain cultivated in such a way no ''Bilsenschnitter'' can break in. When threshing the grain which was cut, the ''Bilsenschnitter'' comes, giving good words, that something in the farmstead may be borrowed him, which must not happen. For revenge at the ''Bilsenschnitter'', twigs of [[juniper]] are added during threshing of the tithed grain. Every beat with the flair then strikes the ''Bilsenschnitter'' until he comes running at the end and requests, for all in the world, threshing may be created in another manner." (Translated from the German text)&lt;ref name=Bechstein-381/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Additionally, ''Bilwisse'' also can be punished by hanging some of the grain heads, which are cut by a ''Bilwis'',into the chimney. The ''Bilwis'' will dry out as the grain heads will do, becoming a [[mummy]] alive, finally dying woefully.&lt;ref&gt;Bechstein, ''Deutsches Sagenbuch'', p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''Bilwisschnitt'' ("''Bilwis'' cut") can also be done by riding on a billy goat, then called a ''Bocksschnitt'' ("buck cut").&lt;ref&gt;Golther, ''Germanische Mythologie'', p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Bilwis'' also muddles hair and beard, causes illness and nightmares.&lt;ref&gt;Golther, ''Germanische Mythologie'', p. 201f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-human ''Bilwisse'' live in mountains and trees.&lt;ref&gt;Grimm, ''Deutsche Mythologie'', p. 367f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other names for the ''Bilwis'' are ''Bil-wiss'',&lt;ref name="Felix Dahn p. 593"/&gt; ''Bilbze'', ''Bilbsenschnitter'' (''Schnitter'' = mower), ''Bilsenschnitter'', ''Binsenschnitter'',&lt;ref name="Bechstein-381"/&gt; ''Belwit'',&lt;ref name=Golther-201/&gt; ''Belewitte'', ''Pilwis'', ''Pilbis'', ''Bilverschnitter'', ''Bilmes'', ''Bilgenschneider'' (''Schneider'' = cutter) and ''Bilwiss''.&lt;ref&gt;Grimm, ''Deutsche Mythologie'', p. 367ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Windsbraut'' ===

The ''Windsbraut'' ("wind's bride") is an (originally female, but occasionally also male) spirit of the whirlwind.&lt;ref name=Grimm-479&gt;Grimm, ''Deutsche Mythologie'', p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Windsbräute'' are stealing the earnings of fieldwork. They can be disarmed by throwing a knife into the whirlwind. A ''Windsbraut'' is unable to remove the knife by own power and therefore needs the help of the knife's owner.&lt;ref name=Mudrak-214&gt;Edmund Mudrak, ''Das große Buch der Sagen'', p.&amp;nbsp;214f.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Windsbraut'' is not always a demon but also can be a [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerer or sorceress]].&lt;ref name=Mudrak-214/&gt;

Other names for ''Windsbraut'' are ''Windschbrauß'',&lt;ref name=Mudrak-214/&gt; ''Windbrauss'', ''Windsprauch'',&lt;ref name=Grimm-479/&gt; ''Windgelle'', ''Windschbrach'', ''Windgäsperl'' ("wind [[Kasperle]]") and ''Windgäspele'' ("wind Kasperle").&lt;ref&gt;Grimm, ''Deutsche Mythologie'', p. 1077.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''glass ceiling''' is a metaphor used to represent an invisible barrier that keeps a given demographic (typically applied to minorities) from rising beyond a certain level in a hierarchy.&lt;ref name="DOL2"&gt;Federal Glass Ceiling Commission.

Within the same concepts of the other terms surrounding the workplace, there are similar terms for restrictions and barriers concerning women and their roles within organizations and how they coincide with their maternal duties. These "Invisible Barriers" function as metaphors to describe the extra circumstances that women undergo, usually when trying to advance within areas of their careers and often while trying to advance within their lives outside their work spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Paul|last2=Caputi|first2=Peter|year=2012|title=A Maze of Metaphors|url=|journal=Faculty of Health and Behavioral Sciences|volume=27|pages=436–448|via=University of Wollongong Research Online|doi=10.1108/17542411211273432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
The United States Federal Glass Ceiling Commission defines the glass ceiling as "the unseen, yet unbreachable barrier that keeps minorities and women from rising to the upper rungs of the corporate ladder, regardless of their qualifications or achievements."&lt;ref name="DOL2" /&gt;

David Cotter and colleagues defined four distinctive characteristics that must be met to conclude that a ''glass ceiling'' exists. A glass ceiling inequality represents:
# "A gender or racial difference that is not explained by other job-relevant characteristics of the employee."
# "A gender or racial difference that is greater at higher levels of an outcome than at lower levels of an outcome."
# "A gender or racial inequality in the chances of advancement into higher levels, not merely the proportions of each gender or race currently at those higher levels."
# "A gender or racial inequality that increases over the course of a career."
Cotter and his colleagues found that glass ceilings are correlated strongly with gender. Both white and minority women face a glass ceiling in the course of their careers. In contrast, the researchers did not find evidence of a glass ceiling for African-American men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cotter | first1 = David A. | last2 = Hermsen | first2 = Joan M. | last3 = Ovadia | first3 = Seth | last4 = Vanneman | first4 = Reece | year = 2001 | title = The glass ceiling effect | url = http://www.bsos.umd.edu/socy/vanneman/papers/CotterHOV01.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Social Forces | volume = 80 | issue = 2| pages = 655–81 | doi=10.1353/sof.2001.0091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The glass ceiling metaphor has often been used to describe invisible barriers ("glass") through which women can see elite positions but cannot reach them ("ceiling").&lt;ref&gt;*Davies-Netzley, Sally A.

== History ==
In 1839, French feminist and author [[George Sand]] used a similar phrase, ''une voûte de cristal impénétrable'', in a passage of ''Gabriel'', a never-performed play: "I was a woman; for suddenly my wings collapsed, ether closed in around my head like ''an impenetrable crystal vault'', and I fell...." [emphasis added]. The statement, a description of the heroine's dream of soaring with wings, has been interpreted as a feminine [[Icarus]] tale of a woman who attempts to ascend above her accepted role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harlan|first=Elizabeth|title=George Sand|year=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-13056-0|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first person said to use the term ''Glass ceiling'' was [[Marilyn Loden]] during a 1978 speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Summary: Full Frontal PR: Review and Analysis of Laermer and Prichinello's Book |page=6 |author=BusinessNews Publishing |publisher=Primento |date=2013 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YRO0uZLlAosC&amp;pg=PT6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.ecatalognow.com/article/Marilyn+Loden+On+Feminine+Leadership/766271/73810/article.html |publisher=Pelican Bay Post |title=Marilyn Loden On Feminine Leadership |date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Glass ceiling originator"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-42026266 |title=100 Women: 'Why I invented the glass ceiling phrase' |date=2017-12-12 |website=BBC News |access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, according to the April 3, 2015, Wall Street Journal, completely independent of Loden, the term glass ceiling was coined in the spring of 1978 by Marianne Schriber and Katherine Lawrence at Hewlett-Packard. The ceiling was defined as discriminatory promotion patterns where the written promotional policy is non-discriminatory, but in practice denies promotion to qualified females. Lawrence presented this at the annual Conference of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press at meeting the National Press.

The term was later used in March 1984 by [[Gay Bryant]]. She was the former editor of ''Working Woman'' magazine and was changing jobs to be the editor of ''[[Family Circle]].'' In an ''[[Adweek]]'' article written by Nora Frenkel, Bryant was reported as saying, "Women have reached a certain point—I call it the glass ceiling. They're in the top of middle management and they're stopping and getting stuck. There isn't enough room for all those women at the top. Some are going into business for themselves. Others are going out and raising families."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Up-and-Comers; Bryant Takes Aim At the Settlers-In |last=Frenkiel |first=Nora |journal=Adweek |volume=Special Report |date=March 1984 |publisher=Magazine World}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cornell&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/library/research/questionofthemonth/jan05.html |title=Question of the Month: Where did the term 'glass ceiling' originate? |date=January 2005 |author=Catherwood Library reference librarians |publisher=Cornell University, ILR School |accessdate=June 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Success&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y71-YCYv-48C&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9 |pages=9–10 |title=Women in Media Careers: Success Despite the Odds |first1=Lee |last1=Bollinger |first2=Carole |last2=O'Neill |publisher=University Press of America |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7618-4133-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1984, Bryant used the term in a chapter of the book ''The Working Woman Report: Succeeding in Business in the 1980s.'' In the same book, Basia Hellwig used the term in another chapter.&lt;ref name=Cornell /&gt;

In a widely cited article in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' in March 1986 the term was used in the
article's title: "The Glass Ceiling: Why Women Can't Seem to Break The Invisible Barrier That Blocks Them From the Top Jobs". The article was written by Carol Hymowitz and Timothy D. Schellhardt. Hymowitz and Schellhardt introduced glass ceiling was "not something that could be found in any corporate manual or even discussed at a business meeting; it was originally introduced as an invisible, covert, and unspoken phenomenon that existed to keep executive level leadership positions in the hands of Caucasian males."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

As the term "Glass Ceiling" got more issued within society, public responded with differing ideas and opinions. Some argued that glass ceiling is a myth rather than a reality because women chose to stay home and showed less dedication to advance into executive suite.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Eleanor|date=September 4, 2014|title=Diversity, Culture and the Glass Ceiling|journal=Journal of Cultural Diversity|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of continuing public debate, the [[United States Department of Labor|US Labor Department]]'s chief, [[Lynn Morley Martin]], reported the results of a research project called "The Glass Ceiling Initiative" formed to investigate the low numbers of women and minorities in executive positions. This report defined the new term as "those artificial barriers based on attitudinal or organizational bias that prevent qualified individuals from advancing upward in their organization into management-level positions."&lt;ref name="Cornell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Success" /&gt;

In 1991, as a part of Title II of the Civil Right Act of 1991,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Redwood|first=Rene A.|date=October 13, 1995|title=Breaking The Glass Ceiling: Good for Business, Good for America|url=http://search.proquest.com/openview/720eed4717a4012eb80aeb984880623c/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=27059|journal=National Council of Jewish Women|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress created the Glass Ceiling Commission. This 21 member Presidential Commission was chaired by Secretary of Labor Robert Reich,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and was created to study the "barriers to the advancement of minorities and women within corporate hierarchies (the problem known as the glass ceiling), to issue a report on its findings and conclusions, and to make recommendations on ways to dis- mantle the glass ceiling."&lt;ref name="DOL2" /&gt; The commission conducted extensive research including, surveys, public hearings and interviews, and released their findings in a report in 1995.&lt;ref name="DOL1" /&gt; The report, "Good for Business", offered "tangible guidelines and solutions on how these barriers can be overcome and eliminated".&lt;ref name="DOL2" /&gt; The goal of the commission was to provide recommendations on how to shatter the glass ceiling, specifically in the world of business.

Number of women CEOs from the [[Fortune 500|Fortune Lists]] has been increasing from 2012–2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catalyst.org/knowledge/fortune-500-ceo-positions-held-women|title=Fortune 500 CEO Positions Held By Women|last=jcombopiano|date=2012-11-27|website=Catalyst|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; but ironically women's labor force participation rate decreased from 52.4% to 49.6% between 1995 and 2015 globally. However, it is evident that some countries like Australia has increased the labor force participation of women over 27% since 1978.  Furthermore, only 19.2% of [[S&amp;P 500 Index|S&amp;P 500 Board Seats]] were held by women in 2014, of whom 80.2% were considered white.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catalyst.org/knowledge/statistical-overview-women-workforce|title=Statistical Overview of Women in the Workforce|last=acostigan|date=2012-10-17|website=Catalyst|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender pay gap ==
{{See also|Gender pay gap|Gender pay gap in the United States}}

The gender pay gap is the difference between male and female earnings. In 2008 the [[OECD]] suggested that the median earnings of female full-time workers were 17% lower than the earnings of their male counterparts and that "30% of the variation in gender wage gaps across OECD countries can be explained by discriminatory practices in the [[Labour economics|labour market]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[OECD]]. [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/8/19/40937574.pdf ''OECD Employment Outlook – 2008 Edition Summary in English''.] OECD, Paris, 2008, p. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oecd2"&gt;[[OECD]].

Chapter 3: The Price of Prejudice: Labour Market Discrimination on the Grounds of Gender and Ethnicity''.] OECD, Paris, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Commission]] suggested that women's hourly earnings were 17.5% lower on average in the 27 [[Member state of the European Union|EU Member States]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[[European Commission]]. [http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=685&amp;langId=en ''The situation in the EU''.] Retrieved on July 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A paper by political activist website "nationalpartnership.org" suggests that as of April 2017, women in the United States were on average paid "80 cents for every dollar paid to men, amounting to an annual gender wage gap of $10,470".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=National Partnership for Women and Families, comp.|first=|date=April 2017|title=America's Women and The Wage Gap|url=http://www.nationalpartnership.org/research-library/workplace-fairness/fair-pay/americas-women-and-the-wage-gap.pdf|journal=Trade, Jobs and Wages|doi=|pmid=|access-date=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may help from a research perspective to note that there are many disagreeing viewpoints on this issue, and the research cited here is presented in favor of the side that asserts society's view on minorities is the cause of the pay gap. Moreover, "based on the human capital theory, not only the general gender-specific pay differentials, but
also the different proportions of women and men in certain occupations and fields of work
and thus the gender-specific labor market segregation is explained with the so-called self selection".[https://www.binghamton.edu/economics/research/old-working-papers/docs/WP0413.pdf ''Occupational Self-Selection and the Gender Wage Gap:
Evidence From Korea and United States''.] In economics, there are various essential theories that describe the illegitimate part of the gender pay
gap. Gary S. Becker’s theory of “tastes of discrimination” indicates that there are some personal
prejudices which concern cooperation with a certain group of people. [ Becker, G. S. (1971): The Economics of Discrimination. Chicago/London: Univ. of Chicago
Press.]

== Glass escalator ==
{{main|Glass escalator}}
In addition to the glass ceiling, which already is stopping women from climbing higher in success in the workplace, a parallel phenomenon called the "[[The Glass Escalator|glass escalator]]" is occurring. This can be defined as how more men are joining fields that were previously occupied mainly by women, such as nursing and teaching, and within these job fields, the men are riding right past women and going straight to the top, similarly to if they were on an escalator and a woman was taking stairs. Men are being offered more promotions than women and even though women have worked just as hard, they are still not being offered the same chances as men are in some circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A New Obstacle For Professional Women: The Glass Escalator|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennagoudreau/2012/05/21/a-new-obstacle-for-professional-women-the-glass-escalator/|website = Forbes|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chart from Carolyn K. Broner shows an example of the glass escalator in favor of men for female-dominant occupations in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MEN, WOMEN, &amp; THE GLASS ESCALATOR|url = http://www.womenonbusiness.com/men-women-the-glass-escalator/|website = Women on Business|accessdate = 2015-10-23|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; While women have mostly occupied the position of teachers, men are taking the higher positions in school systems as deans or principals.

Research on the career paths of men who have occupations in female-dominated fields, such as nursing or teaching, come to a conclusion that men benefit financially from their gender status. This can be extended to say that men are able to abuse their gender advantages in such contexts, often "reaping the benefits of their token status to reach higher levels in female-dominated work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~wright/ContemporaryAmericanSociety/Chapter%2015%20--%20Gender%20inequality%20--%20Norton%20August.pdf|title=Gender Inequality|last=Arnesen|first=Eric|date=2009|website=University Of Wisconsin Madison|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;"{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}  Not only are males taking power from women in more female oriented jobs, but they are rising to the top more steadily than females.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

A 2008 study published in ''[[Social Problems]]'' found that sex segregation in nursing did not follow the "glass escalator" pattern of disproportional vertical distribution; rather, men and women gravitated towards different areas within the field, with male nurses tending to specialize in areas of work perceived as "masculine".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://socpro.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/2/271|title=Revisiting the Glass Escalator: The Case of Gender Segregation in a Female Dominated Occupation|first1=Karrie Ann|last1=Snyder|first2=Adam Isaiah|last2=Green|date=1 May 2008|publisher=|volume=55|issue=2|pages=271–299|via=socpro.oxfordjournals.org|doi=10.1525/sp.2008.55.2.271|journal=Social Problems}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article noted that "men encounter powerful social pressures that direct them away from entering female-dominated occupations (Jacobs 1989, 1993)". Since female-dominated occupations are usually characterized with more feminine activities, men who enter these jobs can be perceived socially as "effeminate, homosexual, or sexual predators".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Sticky floor ==
In the literature on gender discrimination, the concept of "sticky floors" complements the concept of a glass ceiling. Sticky floors can be described as the pattern that women are, compared to men, less likely to start to climb the job ladder. Thereby, this phenomenon is related to gender differentials at the bottom of the wage distribution. Building on the seminal study by Booth and co-authors in European Economic Review,&lt;ref&gt;Booth, A. L., Francesconi, M., Frank, J. (2003)   A sticky floors model of promotion, pay, and gender, European Economic Review, 47, 295-322 {{DOI|10.1016/S0014-2921(01)00197-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; during the last decade economists have attempted to identify sticky floors in the labour market.  They found empirical evidence for the existence of sticky floors in countries such as Australia, Belgium, Italy, Thailand and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Baert, S., De Pauw, A.-S., Deschacht, N. (2016)  Do Employer Preferences Contribute to Sticky Floors? ILR Review, {{DOI|10.1177/0019793915625213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The frozen middle ==
Similar to the sticky floor, the frozen middle describes the phenomenon of women's progress up the corporate ladder slowing, if not halting, in the ranks of middle management.&lt;ref&gt;Martell, Richard F., et al. "Sex Stereotyping In The Executive Suite: `Much Ado About Something'." Journal of Social Behavior &amp; Personality (1998) 127-138. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the term referred to the resistance corporate upper management faced from middle management when issuing directives. Due to a lack of ability or lack of drive in the ranks of middle management these directives do not come into fruition and as a result the company's bottom line suffers.The term was popularized by a ''Harvard Business Review'' article titled "Middle Management Excellence".&lt;ref&gt;Byrnes, Jonathan. "Middle Management Excellence." Harvard Business Review 5 Dec. 2005 pag. print&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the growing proportion of women to men in the workforce, however, the term "frozen middle" has become more commonly ascribed to the aforementioned slowing of the careers of women in middle management.&lt;ref&gt;Lyness, Karen S., and Donna E. Thompson. "Climbing The Corporate Ladder: Do Female And Male Executives Follow The Same Route?." Journal of Applied Psychology (2000) 86-101. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1996 study "A Study of the Career Development and Aspirations of Women in Middle Management" posits that social structures and networks within businesses that favor "good old boys" and norms of masculinity exist based on the experiences of women surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;Wentling, Rose Mary. "Women In Middle Management: Their Career Development And Aspirations." Business Horizon (1992) 47. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the study, women who did not exhibit stereotypical masculine traits, (e.g. aggressiveness, thick skin, lack of emotional expression) and interpersonal communication tendencies are at an inherent disadvantage compared to their male peers.&lt;ref&gt;Wentling, Rose Mary. "Women In Middle Management: Their Career Development And Aspirations." Business Horizon, p. 252 (1992) 47. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; As the ratio of men to women increases in the upper levels of management,&lt;ref&gt;Helfat, Constance E., Dawn Harris, and Paul J. Wolfson. "The Pipeline To The Top: Women And Men In The Top Executive Ranks Of U.S. Corporations." Academy Of Management Perspectives (2006) 42-64. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; women's access to female mentors who could advise them on ways to navigate office politics is limited, further inhibiting upward mobility within a corporation or firm.&lt;ref&gt;Dezso, Cristian L., David Gaddis Ross, and Jose Uribe. "Is There An Implicit Quota On Women In Top Management? A Large-Sample Statistical Analysis." Strategic Management Journal (2016) 98-115. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the frozen middle affects female professionals in western and eastern countries such as the United States and Malaysia, respectively,&lt;ref&gt;Mandy Mok Kim, Man, Miha Skerlavaj, and Vlado Dimovski. "Is There A 'Glass Ceiling' For Mid-Level Female Managers?." International Journal of Management &amp; Innovation (2009) 1-13. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as women in a variety of fields ranging from the aforementioned corporations to STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;Cundiff, Jessica, and Theresa Vescio. "Gender Stereotypes Influence How People Explain Gender Disparities In The Workplace." Sex Roles (2016): 126-138. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Glass Ceiling Index ==
In 2017, the ''Economist'' updated their glass-ceiling index. It combines data on higher education, labour-force participation, pay, child-care costs, maternity and paternity rights, business-school applications and representation in senior jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/03/daily-chart-0|title=Daily chart: The best and worst places to be a working woman|newspaper=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The countries where inequality was the lowest were, in order of most equality, Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Poland.

== Gender Stereotypes ==
[[File:Gallup Poll Results.png|thumb|Gallup Poll: Men are more Aggressive, Women are more Emotional &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;]]

In a 1993 report released through the U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences, researchers noted that women have the same educational opportunities as their male counterparts, the Glass Ceiling persist due to systematic barriers, low representation and mobility, and [[stereotype]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4d7c/b2f387917506b08a781b9ea77ce8bfaeefdd.pdf|title=The Glass Ceiling: Potential Causes and Possible Solutions|last=|first=|date=1993|publisher=U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminine stereotypes attributed to women is one widely-recognized reason as to why female employees are systematically inhibited from receiving advantageous opportunities in their career field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aauw.org/research/barriers-and-bias/|title=Barriers and Bias: The Status of Women in Leadership|last=Hill|first=Catherine|date=|website=AAUW|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Majority of Americans perceive women to be more emotional and men to be more aggressive than their opposite sex.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/1978/americans-see-women-emotional-affectionate-men-more-aggressive.aspx|title=Americans See Women as Emotional and Affectionate, Men As More Aggressive|last=Newport|first=Frank|date=February 21, 2001|website=Gallup|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender stereotypes influence how leaders are chosen by employers and how workers of different sex are treated. Glass ceilings can be observed in the typical American supermarket in which women are assigned to be cashiers due to the belief that women are better than their male co-workers at emotional management with customers. Journeyman clerks whom are mostly assigned cashier shifts experience a low quality of work and significantly less promotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tolich and Briar|first=|date=1999|title=Just Checking It Out: Exploring the Significance of Informal Gender Divisions Amongst American Supermarket Employees|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A class action law suit was filed against Lucky Stores for the unjust assignment of tasks to employees of different race and sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/803/259/2133110/|title=Stender v. Lucky Stores, Inc.,803 F. Supp 259 (N.D. Cal. 1992)|last=|first=|date=|website=Justia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, one of the stereotypes towards women in workplaces is "gender status belief" which claims that men are more competent and intelligent than women, thus they have much higher positions in the career hierarchy. Ultimately, this factor leads to perception of gender-based jobs on the labor market, so men are expected to have more work-related qualifications and hired for top positions.[https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/29811/1/605208190.pdf ''Glass Ceiling Effect and Earnings - The Gender Pay Gap in
Managerial Positions in Germany''.]   Perceived feminine stereotypes contribute to the glass ceiling faced by women in the workforce.

== Second shift ==
The second shift focuses on the idea that women theoretically work a second shift in the manner of having a greater workload, not just doing a greater share of domestic work. All of the tasks that are engaged in outside the workplace are mainly tied to motherhood. Depending on location, household income, educational attainment, ethnicity and location. Data shows that women do work a second shift in the sense of having a greater workload, not just doing a greater share of domestic work, but this is not apparent if simultaneous activity is overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Craig|first=Lyn|year=2007|title=is herre really a second shift, and if so, who does it? a time-diary investigation|url=|journal=Feminist Review|volume=86|pages=149–170|jstor=30140855|doi=10.1057/palgrave.fr.9400339}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alva Myrdal]] and [[Viola Klein]] as early as 1956 focused on the potential of both men and women working in settings that included paid and unpaid types of work environments. Research indicated that men and women could have equal time for activities outside the work environment for family and extra activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Myrdal|first=Alva|last2=Klein|first2=Viola|year=1957|title=Women's Two Roles: Home and Work|url=|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=20|issue=2|pages=|via=|doi=10.2307/2088886}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "second shift" has also been found to have physical effects as well, especially for women. Women whom engage in longer hours in pursuit of family balance, often suffer more mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and other problems. Irritability, low motivation and energy, and other emotional issues have been found as well. The overall happiness of women can be improved if the balance of career and home responsibilities are met.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahmad|first=Muhammad|year=2011|title=Working women work-life conﬂict|url=|journal=Business Strategy Series|volume=12|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mommy Track ==
"Mommy Track" is a term used to describe women who simply disregard their career and professional duties in order to satisfy the needs of their families. Women are often subject to long work hours that creates an imbalance within the work-family schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=E. Jeffery|last2=Martinson|first2=Vjkollca K.|last3=Baker|first3=Robin Zenger|last4=Ferris|first4=Maria|year=2004|title=Beyond The Mommy Track: The Influence of New Concept Part-Time Work for Professional Women on Work and Family|url=|journal=Journal of Family and economic Issues|volume=25|pages=|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is research suggesting that women were able to function on a part-time professional schedule compared to others who worked full-time while still engaged in external family activities. The research also suggests, flexible work arrangements allow for the achievement of a healthy work and family balance. A difference has also been discovered in the cost and amount of effort in childbearing amongst women in higher skilled positions and roles, as opposed to women in lower-skilled jobs. This difference leads to women delaying and postponing goals and career aspirations over a number of years. A large number of women across the country who have vocational/professional certifications and degrees have been found to be not a part of the working force at the estimated rate more than twice times as male counterparts. Also, the ''Deloitte Touche'', a professional hiring service firm, confirmed that they had recorded dropout rates in each entering class of hires and reported that indeed women's rates were very high compared to males due to mother- and family-related responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stone|first=Pamela|last2=Lovejoyy|first2=Meg|year=2004|title=Fast-Track Women &amp; The Choice To Stay Home|url=|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=596|issue=62|pages=|via=|doi=10.1177/0002716204268552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maternal brain is a term that is also associated with the glass ceiling.  Maternal brain is a hormonal and brain change that occurs during pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schulpen|first1=Tom W.J.|title=The glass ceiling: A biological phenomenon|journal=Medical Hypotheses|date=September 2017|volume=106|pages=41–43|doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2017.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concrete floor==
The term ''concrete floor'' has been used to refer to the minimum number or the proportion of women necessary for a cabinet or board of directors to be perceived as legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=There are three rules of Cabinet appointments |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/11/25/there-are-three-rules-of-cabinet-appointments-will-donald-trump-break-them/ |quote= |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=November 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Argentina}} 

The history of '''human rights in Argentina''' is affected by the [[Dirty War]] and its aftermath. The Dirty War, a state-sponsored violence against [[Argentina|Argentine]] citizenry from roughly 1976 to 1983, was carried out primarily by [[Jorge Rafael Videla]]'s military government, ended years ago, and the human rights situation in Argentina has improved since.

==History==
According to the ''Nunca Más'' report issued by the [[National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons]] (CONADEP) in 1984, about 9,000 people had "disappeared" between 1976 and 1983. According to a secret cable from [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|DINA]] (Chilean secret police) in Buenos Aires, an estimate by the Argentine 601st Intelligence Battalion in mid-July 1978, which started counting victims in 1975, gave the figure of 22,000 persons.

The fact that these statements recognize the application of this concept of [[international law]] in ordinary courts is a milestone in the history of [[international human rights]]. This situation led to the opening of some trials in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Cordoba]], [[Corrientes]], [[San Miguel de Tucumán|Tucumán]] and [[Buenos Aires]] and there are several on the procedural schedule. Sentences confirmed the implementation of the concept of "crimes against humanity", but investigations were not adequate to international law, or have joined the investigation and prosecution procedures as consistent with the types of crimes arising from [[international criminal law]]. This affects, using ordinary [[criminal law]] standards, the type of testing needed and who may be charged. There procedural certainty is impossible to substantiate the thousands of lawsuits pending across the country and to keep the current procedure.{{Clarify|date=June 2014}}

== Respect for the integrity of the person==
=== Arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of life===
While the government or its agents did not commit any politically motivated killings, there are reports that police committed killings involving unwarranted or excessive force. Generally, officers accused of wrongdoing are administratively suspended until completion of an investigation. Authorities investigated and in some cases detained, prosecuted, and convicted the officers involved.

The nongovernmental organization (NGO) Coordinator Against Police Repression (CORREPI) reported that security forces using excessive force killed more than 200 persons each year.

In January 2008 local victim advocacy organization Madres del Dolor filed a court case accusing two policemen of killing 21-year-old Sergio Enciso in Buenos Aires Province. The case remained pending at year's end.

According to Madres del Dolor, a judge detained five police officers and the police chief of Ramos Mejia in [[Buenos Aires Province]] for the February death of 35-year-old Gaston Duffau after an official autopsy confirmed that the victim died from multiple blows to the body and asphyxia. The police officials involved remained in pretrial detention at year's end.

There are no known developments in the case of Carlos Madrid, an off duty Buenos Aires police sergeant, who was in pretrial detention for the November 2007 killing of Daniel Ezequiel Cespedes.

In July 2008 a court sentenced police officer Dario Poblete to life imprisonment for the April 2007 killing of school teacher Carlos Fuentealba during a teachers' strike in Neuquen.

In September a Jujuy provincial court sentenced one police officer to life imprisonment and another to four years in prison for the 2006 death of Saul Mendoza. The court acquitted a third officer and continued to investigate a fourth.

There were no known developments in the trial of two former police officers and a civilian charged with homicide in the 2006 beating and shooting death of 15-year-old Miguel Eduardo Cardozo.

Human rights groups stated to the press that ex-police officer Marta Jorgelina Oviedo was serving her life imprisonment sentence for the 2002 killing of Andrea Viera under house arrest.

In August 2008 the government, as recommended by the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] in 2003, reopened an investigation into the 1991 killing by police forces of Walter Bulacio. The trial remained pending at year's end.&lt;ref name=report&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/wha/119145.htm Report on Human Rights Practices 2008: Argentina].

=== Disappearance===
In contrast with the systematic forced disappearance of persons under the military dictatorship, the situation has greatly improved and there were no reports of politically motivated disappearances in 2008.

Judicial proceedings related to killings, disappearances, and torture committed by the 1976-83 military dictatorship continue to this day. According to a human rights organization, the Center for Legal and Social Studies (CELS), by the end of 2008, there were 255 ongoing judicial investigations and an estimated 508 persons indicted for crimes against humanity committed during the Dirty War era. Of those indicted, 358 remained in pretrial detention. At least 14 former state security agents and their civilian allies were convicted of human rights crimes, including forced disappearances and kidnappings. A November 2008 Noticias Argentinas press report, compiling information provided by the National Prosecutor General's Office, stated that 32 individuals had been convicted for crimes against humanity since 2003, 371 suspects remained in pretrial detention, and 61 persons remained fugitives from justice. In March 2008 a federal court decided that crimes committed by the Argentine Anti Communism Alliance before and during the military dictatorship were [[crimes against humanity]] and therefore not subject to the [[statute of limitations]].

The press, civil society, and legal scholars express concern that the government's efforts to pursue justice for human rights crimes committed during the military dictatorship does not include armed guerrilla groups that also were accused of committing abuses during the same time period.
In January 2008 a court released the wife and two children of former naval official Hector Febres, who died of cyanide poisoning in prison while facing charges of torture. They still faced charges on suspicion that they helped Febres commit suicide. In March a federal court released two Coast Guard constables who were arrested in connection with the case.

In March 2008 the National Human Rights Secretariat pressed homicide charges against former economy minister Jose Martinez de Hoz, who served under the military dictatorship, for the death of economist Juan Carlos Casariego Del Bel.

In March 2008 former navy lieutenant commander Ricardo Cavallo was extradited from Spain to Argentina to face charges of crimes against humanity committed during the military dictatorship. Cavallo was indicted in July and remained in pretrial detention at year's end.

In May 2008 federal authorities indicted Ernesto Barreiro for his role in committing human rights abuses during the military dictatorship, when he served as an army officer and chief interrogator at the La Perla clandestine torture center. He remained in pretrial detention at year's end.

In April 2008 former police officers Fernando Esvedes and Carlos Vercellone were arrested for their alleged role in political kidnappings and torture in the clandestine detention center Pozo de Arana during the military dictatorship, and their trial remained pending at year's end.

In July former army chief Luciano Benjamin Menendez and former army officials Oreste Valentin Padovan, Ricardo Alberto Ramon Lardone, Carlos Alberto Diaz, and Luis Alberto Manzanelli were sentenced to life imprisonment for human rights violations committed during the military dictatorship. Former army officials Hermes Oscar Rodriguez, Jorge Exequiel Acosta, and Carlos Alberto Vega received sentences ranging from 18 to 22 years' imprisonment.

In August 2008 former army lieutenant colonel Julio Rafael Barreiro was sentenced to life imprisonment, while former captain Juan Carlos de Marchi and former colonel Horacio Losito were sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment for their role in human rights violations during the military dictatorship. Former gendarmerie commander Raul Alfredo Reynoso was sentenced to 18 years.

In August 2008 a human rights trial against former brigadier general Enrique Braulio Olea, former colonels Oscar Lorenzo Reinhold and Mario Alberto Gomez Arenas, former major Luis Alberto Farias Barrera, former military officers Jorge Eduardo Molina Ezcurra and Sergio Adolfo San Martin, and doctor Hilarion de la Paz Sosa began in Neuquen Province. The former military officials were accused of 17 counts of crimes against humanity committed during the military dictatorship.

In September 2008 a federal judge resumed an investigation into the 1973 killing of General Labor Confederation leader Jose Ignacio Rucci, in which the armed guerrilla group, the Montoneros, was believed to have been involved.

In October 2008 federal authorities indicted former National University Concentration chief Eduardo Cincotta, former member Nicolas Cafarello, three former air force officials, and former army colonel Roberto Atilio Bocalandro for human rights crimes committed in the clandestine detention center La Cueva in Mar del Plata. They remained in pretrial detention at year's end.

In October 2008 former army officials Alberto Barda, Hipolito Mariani, and Cesar Comes received sentences ranging from 25 years' to life imprisonment for human rights violations committed in the clandestine detention centers of Mansion Sere and La Cueva.
In December the Court of Criminal Appeals ordered that 21 military officials accused of human rights violations during the military dictatorship be freed on bail, including two of the most notorious suspects, ex-naval captains Alfredo Astiz and Jorge Acosta. The three-judge panel noted that the men had spent more than five years in detention without a trial, far in excess of the two-year legal limit for pretrial detention. The prosecutors, CELS, and the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo subsequently appealed the decision, and the officers remained in detention pending a Supreme Court decision. The government sought to impeach the judges who ordered the release.

There were no developments in the 2006 missing persons case of Jorge Julio Lopez, a key witness in the case against Miguel Etchecolatz, former commissioner general of the Buenos Aires Province police.

Judicial authorities continued to investigate cases of kidnapping and illegal adoption by members of the former military dictatorship of children born to detained dissidents. At year's end, 96 of an estimated 500 persons born to detained and disappeared dissidents and illegally adopted had been identified and made aware of their true backgrounds.

In April 2008 a court sentenced a military official to 10 years in prison for his role in facilitating the illegal adoption of Maria Eugenia Sampallo Barragan, the daughter of political dissidents killed during the military dictatorship. This was the first case of its kind, and Sampallo's adoptive parents were sentenced to seven and eight years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

=== Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment===
Although the law prohibits such practices and provides penalties for torture similar to those for homicide, there are reports that some police and prison guards continue to employ torture and brutality. CELS reported police brutality and occasional alleged torture of suspects, particularly during prison transfers. While the government has investigated such reports, there were few convictions.

In 2008, according to CELS, a prison detainee in the Olmos, Buenos Aires, provincial prison asserted he had received knife injuries from a senior prison official in the presence of another prison official. A detainee in the Sierra Chica Prison in Buenos Aires Province filed a complaint for being subjected to solitary confinement for 45 days with no clothes or food. A 17-year-old minor also filed a complaint alleging that police agents in a police station in Hurlingham, Buenos Aires Province, subjected him to electrical shocks. Two lower ranking navy officials and a civilian remained in pretrial detention for the 2006 kidnapping, beating, torture, and killing of 15-year-old Lucas Ivarrola, were accused of stealing a television set. A trial date had not been set by year's end.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

===Prison and detention center conditions===
The country's [[prisons]] remain in inhumane conditions, and prisoners often spend years in jail before trial. Police are still abusing this power, hitting and sometimes torturing people in police stations, and even been some instances of new ''desaparecidos'' ("disappeared").&lt;ref&gt;Marcela Valente, [http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=31167 Argentina: 'Cruel, Inhumane' Prison Conditions in Mendoza] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614022858/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=31167 |date=2010-06-14 }}, [[Inter Press Service]], 24-11-2006, accessed 01-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prison conditions often are poor and life-threatening; in many facilities, extreme overcrowding, poor nutrition, inadequate medical and psychological treatment, inadequate sanitation, limited family visits, and frequent inhuman and degrading treatment are common, according to various reports by human rights organizations and research centers. The research center Unidos por la Justicia estimated [[prison overcrowding]] at 20 percent nationwide, while credible press reports estimated prison overcrowding in Buenos Aires Province exceeded 25 percent.

The Buenos Aires Provincial Memory Commission's Committee Against Torture reported that, during the first 11 months of the year in Buenos Aires provincial prisons, there were 86 prisoner deaths and 5,169 violent incidents, resulting in injuries to 4,800 prisoners. According to an earlier report from the committee covering the first half of the year, authorities repressed violent incidents with rubber bullets and sticks on 564 occasions. The committee attributed the violence to inmate attacks on fellow prisoners and on prison officials. The committee also criticized the provincial prison health-care system.

In April 2008 federal criminal prosecutor Francisco Mugnolo filed a case with the Supreme Court arguing that inadequate federal control over federal prisons resulted in human rights violations and torture of some prisoners. He also released a report claiming that 63 percent of federal prisoners in the second half of 2007 had experienced physical aggression.

Also in April, Alfredo Emiliano Fleitas, a prisoner in Villa Devoto Prison, petitioned the courts for a writ of habeas corpus after having been beaten by prison guards in February during a transfer to Ezeiza Prison. Fleitas was hospitalized as a result of his injuries and underwent surgery to restore his vision. In August 2008 the Buenos Aires Provincial Supreme Court ordered the Provincial Criminal Court of Appeals to decide a collective habeas corpus case filed by CELS on behalf of provincial prisoners who were subject to mistreatment and violence during prison transfers.

While women were held separately from men, the law permits children to stay in prison with their mothers until age four. Press reports estimated that 86 children under the age of four lived with their mothers in federal prisons, with an additional 75 in Buenos Aires provincial prisons. In general men's prisons were more violent, dangerous, and crowded than the women's prisons.

Overcrowding in juvenile facilities often resulted in minors being held in police station facilities, although separate from adult detainees. According to a 2007 UN Children's Fund and National Secretariat for Human Rights report, these institutions held approximately 20,000 children, 20 percent of whom were under age 16. The overwhelming majority had not committed a crime; rather, they were abandoned by their families or considered "at risk" for other reasons.

Pretrial detainees often were held with convicted prisoners. CELS estimated that 53 percent of those in federal prison were awaiting trial.
In November 2008 the Buenos Aires Provincial Court initiated trial proceedings in the case against Buenos Aires Magdalena Provincial Prison Director Carlos Tejeda and 15 prison guards and officials accused of abandoning prisoners in a 2005 fire that killed 33 prisoners.

The government permitted prison visits by local and international human rights observers, and such visits have been taking place.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

=== Arbitrary arrest or detention===
The law prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention, and the government generally observes these prohibitions; however, police reportedly arrests and detains citizens arbitrarily on occasion. The federal police have jurisdiction for maintaining law and order in the federal capital and for federal crimes in the provinces. Other federal police authorities include the Airport Security Police, the Gendarmerie, the Coast Guard, and the Bureau of Prisons. Additionally, each province has its own police force that responds to a provincial security ministry or secretariat. Individual forces vary considerably in their effectiveness and respect for human rights. Corruption is widespread in some forces, and internal controls to counter police abuses are often weak.

The most frequent abuses include extortion of, and protection for, those involved in drug trafficking, prostitution, and trafficking in persons.

The federal security forces have the authority to conduct internal investigations into alleged abuses and to fire individuals who have allegedly committed a human rights violation. The federal government can also file complaints with the federal courts; provincial governments may do the same for provincial security forces. Members of security forces convicted of a crime were subject to stiff penalties. In 2008, authorities in Buenos Aires Province removed more than 700 police officers for corruption and other offenses.

Police may detain suspects for up to 10 hours without an arrest warrant if the authorities have a well-founded belief that the suspects have committed, or are about to commit, a crime or are unable to determine the suspected person's identity. Human rights groups report that the police often detains suspects longer than 10 hours.

The law provides a person in detention with the right to a prompt determination of the legality of the detention, which entails appearance before a criminal lower court judge, who determines whether to proceed with an investigation. There are frequent delays in this process and in informing detainees of the charges against them.

The law provides for the right to bail, except in cases involving narcotics, violent crimes, and firearms violations. Although the bail system was used, civil rights groups claimed that judges were more likely to order the holding of indicted suspects in preventive or pretrial detention than to allow suspects to remain free pending their trial. In November 2008 the highest penal court broadly ruled that pretrial detention should be the exception to the rule, except in cases where a suspect represents a flight risk or may act to obstruct justice. Detainees are allowed prompt access to counsel, and public defenders were provided for detainees unable to afford counsel, although such access sometimes was delayed due to an overburdened system. Strong demand and a lack of resources for the Public Defender's Office results in an excessive caseload for public defense attorneys.

Although there are no official statistics on the percentage of detainees requesting public defense attorneys, human rights organizations estimated that 80 percent requested public defense attorneys. Detainees also were allowed access to family members, although not always promptly.

The law provides for investigative detention of up to two years for indicted persons awaiting or undergoing trial; the period may be extended for one year in limited situations. The slow pace of the justice system often resulted in lengthy detentions beyond the period stipulated by law. CELS reported that prisoners waited an average of three years to be tried, with some cases taking as long as six years to go to trial. A convicted prisoner usually received credit for time already served. In 2008, in Buenos Aires Province, provisional statistics from CELS indicated that nearly 75 percent of detainees were in pretrial detention, while the Buenos Aires Provincial Memory Commission Committee Against Torture reported that 78 percent of the approximately 26,000 detainees in provincial prisons were awaiting trial.

According to several human rights organizations, 30 percent of pretrial detainees were eventually acquitted. According to the Memory Commission's committee, there were approximately 6,500 complaints of human rights violations against juvenile detainees in provincial prisons and juvenile detention facilities, the majority of which were pending investigation. In July 2008 the Buenos Aires Provincial Supreme Court inaugurated an ad hoc juvenile justice system, which operated in eight out of 18 provincial districts. It provides minors age 16 to 18 the same procedural rights as adults and limits sentences to 180 days in prison. In August 2008 the minister of justice announced that he had instructed police forces to conform standard operating procedures for arresting minors to international standards; however, by year's end, there was no information on application of procedures.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

===Denial of fair public trial===
The law provides for the right to a fair trial, and the judiciary generally enforced this right. However, there are complaints that some lower court federal judges, provincial judges, and judicial personnel were inefficient and at times subject to political manipulation. Justice organizations are particularly critical of the lack of independence of lower court judges with federal jurisdiction in many provinces. The judicial system is hampered by inordinate delays, procedural logjams, changes of judges, inadequate administrative support, and general inefficiency caused by remnants of the inquisitorial criminal justice system used in federal and many provincial courts. Judges have broad discretion as to whether and how to pursue investigations, contributing to a public perception that many decisions were arbitrary. Allegations of corruption in provincial courts as well as federal courts located in the provinces were more frequent than federal courts with jurisdiction over the city and province of Buenos Aires, reflecting strong connections between the executive and judicial branches at the provincial level. In May 2008 the Congress passed a law establishing a process to appoint temporary judges in response to a 2007 Supreme Court order. However, legal scholars expressed concern that the law encourages delays in the selection of permanent judges and increases the executive branch's authority to appoint temporary judges without public vetting. At year's end, there were 160 vacant judgeships nationwide. There were some criticisms in the press that interim judges were subject to political manipulation due to the temporary nature of their position.

The judicial system is divided into federal and provincial courts, both headed by a supreme court with appellate courts and district courts below it. The federal courts are divided between the criminal and civil courts. In August 2008 the Congress voted to abolish the military justice system, thus making members of the military subject to civil proceedings for crimes committed during peacetime and to a new military disciplinary code for infractions of military rules.

Trials are public, and defendants have the right to legal counsel and to call defense witnesses in the federal and some provincial courts that have an accusatory system of criminal justice. If needed, a public defender is provided at public expense when defendants face serious criminal charges. During the investigative stage, defendants can submit questions in writing to the investigating judge. A panel of judges decides guilt or innocence. Federal and provincial courts continued the transition to trials with oral arguments in criminal cases, replacing the old system of written submissions. Although the 1994 constitution provides for trial by jury, implementing legislation had not been passed by year's end. In Cordoba Province, however, defendants accused of certain serious crimes have the right to a trial by jury. Lengthy delays in trials are a nationwide problem, with many cases taking five or more years to resolve. Defendants are presumed innocent and have the right to appeal, as do prosecutors. Minors under age 16 cannot be criminally prosecuted. By law defendants and attorneys have access to government held evidence, but they may experience significant obstacles or delays in obtaining such evidence. In 2008, the human rights organization Fundacion Sur noted that the country lacked a separate juvenile justice system that affords adolescents due process protections and the right to a legal defense in criminal cases and expressed concern that the broad discretion judges have in such cases increased the possibility of arbitrary rulings. The age of legal liability is 16, and Fundacion Sur asserted that 16- and 17-year-old offenders frequently were transferred to adult criminal courts or held in juvenile detention centers for longer periods than warranted by their offenses. A December 2008 Supreme Court decision found that the country's juvenile justice system did not comply with international conventions and highlighted the need for the legislative branch to remedy the situation.

There were no reports of political prisoners or detainees.

There is an independent and impartial judiciary in civil matters, and anyone may bring lawsuits seeking damages or the protection of rights provided by the constitution. Government agencies, professional bar associations, universities, and NGOs provide free legal counseling and may represent indigent persons before civil courts as well as assist them in alternative dispute resolution proceedings.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

===Arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence===
The constitution prohibits such actions, and the government generally respected these prohibitions in practice.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

== Civil liberties==
=== Freedom of speech and press===
The constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the press, and the government generally respected these rights in practice.
Individuals can criticize the government publicly or privately, but there are criminal penalties, including prison sentences, for libel and slander, and government officials have sought to use these against the political opposition and other critics. The government pressed criminal libel and slander charges against Elisa Carrio, head of the opposition Civic Coalition party, for accusing officials in 2004 of corruption. In September 2008 Carrio won a civil case brought by the son of a deceased Peronist leader whom she accused of being involved in official corruption, murder, and drug trafficking; it was the second such case she had won.
In December 2008 security forces arrested 26 "neo-Nazis," including four minors, on discrimination charges for conducting a ceremony to commemorate the death of World War II German naval captain Hans Langsdorff. All individuals subsequently were released but still faced discrimination charges.

The independent media are numerous and active and express a wide variety of views without restriction.

Numerous FM radio stations continue to broadcast with temporary licenses pending conclusion of a licensing normalization process.
In August 2008 AM radio signal Radio Continental, which had been critical of the government, filed a complaint before the Federal Broadcasting Committee (COMFER) for its decision to suspend its FM broadcast. Although the complaint was not resolved by year's end, COMFER did not enforce its decision, and the station continued to broadcast on the FM frequency.

In August 2008 the Association for Civil Rights and the [[Open Society Justice Initiative]] published a report alleging that the government's allocation of state advertising funds affected press freedom. The report claimed that the government abused the distribution of state advertising to benefit or punish the press according to the tone of their coverage of the administration. This assessment coincided with press reports and comments made in private by media organization leaders.

According to the Association for Civil Rights, the Neuquen provincial government had not complied by the end of 2008 with a 2007 Supreme Court order to present an official advertising distribution plan that would not indirectly curtail freedom of speech. The 2006 lawsuit lodged by the country's second largest media company, Grupo Editorial Perfil, against the federal government's use of government advertising as a means of indirect censorship remained pending at year's end.

Journalist Sergio Poma died in January 2008 while awaiting appeal of a September 2007 Salta provincial court decision that sentenced him to a one-year suspended prison term and barred him from practicing journalism for one year for slandering the former governor of Salta.

In November 2008 labor activists from the teamsters union, led by Hugo Moyano, vice president of the ruling Peronist Party and leader of the General Labor Confederation (CGT), blocked a newspaper distribution center jointly run by the country's two leading newspapers, Clarin and La Nacion. The union maintained that the protest was technically for better wage and working conditions for the teamsters that drive newspaper distribution trucks. However, media organizations and the opposition criticized the government failure to break up the blockade and called it a direct attack on press freedom; the two newspapers filed criminal charges against the perpetrators.

There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet or reports that the government monitored e mail or Internet chat rooms. Individuals and groups can engage in the peaceful expression of views via the Internet, including by e mail. According to the government's National Statistics and Census Institute, there are more than three million residential Internet users.

There are no government restrictions on academic freedom or cultural events.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

=== Freedom of peaceful Assembly and Association===
The constitution provides for [[freedom of assembly]] and association, and the government generally respects these rights in practice.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

=== Freedom of religion===
The constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the government generally respected this right in practice. The constitution also states that the federal government "sustains the apostolic Roman Catholic faith," and the government provided the Catholic Church with a variety of subsidies not available to other religious groups. Other religious faiths were practiced freely.

In order to hold public worship services, obtain visas for foreign missionaries, and obtain tax exempt status, religious organizations must register with the Secretariat of Worship in the Ministry of Foreign Relations, International Trade, and Worship and report periodically to maintain their status.

Acts of discrimination and vandalism against religious minorities, particularly the 300,000 member Jewish community, continued. During the year, the Delegation of Israeli Argentine Associations (DAIA) received approximately 202 complaints of anti Semitic acts. The most commonly reported incidents were desecration of Jewish cemeteries, anti Semitic graffiti, verbal slurs, and other forms of harassment.

In August 2008 Raul Arenas Vega was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment for the 2006 beating of an Orthodox Jewish teenager in Buenos Aires.
The investigation continued into the 1994 bombing of the Argentine Jewish Mutual Aid Association (AMIA) building in Buenos Aires that killed 85 persons. In May 2008 a federal prosecutor called for the indictment of former President Carlos Menem, former federal judge Juan Galeano, and others for their alleged role in covering up and protecting those involved in the attack. Subsequently, the presiding federal judge, following recommendations from the AMIA Special Prosecutor, issued an international request for the seizure of assets belonging to eight Iranians and Hezbollah to cover damages being claimed by the civil suit brought against the perpetrators. In December the judge ordered the seizure of six commercial properties allegedly belonging to a former Iranian cultural attache who was among those accused of aiding in the attack.

There are still no developments in DAIA's case against activists from the left wing group Quebracho that prevented Jewish community groups from demonstrating in front of the Iranian Embassy in 2006.

The government continues to support a public dialogue to highlight past discrimination and to encourage improved religious tolerance.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

=== Freedom of movement within the country, foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation===
The constitution provides for freedom of movement within the country, foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation, and the government generally respected these rights in practice.

The government cooperates with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in providing protection and assistance to refugees, asylum seekers, and other persons of concern.

The law prohibits forced exile, and the government did not exile anyone.

The law provides for the granting of asylum or refugee status in accordance with the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 protocol, and the government has established a system for providing protection to refugees. The government granted refugee status or asylum.

The law allows the government to provide temporary protection for humanitarian reasons, including family reunification, to individuals who may not qualify as refugees under the 1951 convention and the 1967 protocol.

According to the government's Refugee Eligibility Committee, in the first 11 months of 2008, 745 persons sought asylum, and the government granted refugee status to 89 persons. The government continues to cooperate with the UNHCR to resettle at risk Colombian refugees. According to the UNHCR, the country also resettled 39 Colombians in the first six months of the year.

In practice the government provides protection against the expulsion or return of refugees to countries where their lives or freedom would be threatened. The government grants refugee status and temporary protection for humanitarian reasons.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

== Political rights==
=== Elections and political participation===
The law provides citizens the right to change their government peacefully, and citizens exercised this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elections based on universal suffrage.

National presidential and legislative elections took place in October 2007. At the national level, one half of the seats in the Chamber of Deputies and one third of those in the Senate were contested. The media, the Ministry of Justice, and various NGOs observed the elections and judged them free and fair, although several opposition parties filed a complaint alleging that ballots listing opposition candidates were not available at voting stations in some provinces.

Provincial elections in Santiago del Estero Province took place in orderly fashion in November.

Political parties generally operated without restriction.

Decrees provide that one third of the members of both houses of congress must be women, a goal achieved through balanced election slates. There were 28 women in the 72 seat Senate and 103 women in the 256 seat Chamber of Deputies. The president, two of the seven Supreme Court justices, and four cabinet ministers were women. Women constituted approximately 17 percent of top executive-branch positions at the federal level.

One indigenous person served in the Chamber of Deputies. There were no other known ethnic or racial minorities in the national legislature. There were no known indigenous, ethnic, or racial minorities in the cabinet or on the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

=== Government corruption and transparency===
{{see also|Corruption in Argentina}}
The law provides criminal penalties for official corruption; however, there were frequent press reports that executive officials engaged in corrupt practices, suggesting a failure to implement the law effectively.
According to the World Bank's worldwide governance indicators, government corruption is a serious problem. Historically weak institutions and an often ineffective and politicized judicial system make rooting out corruption in any systemic fashion difficult.

Public officials are subject to financial disclosure laws, and the Ministry of Justice's Anti Corruption Office (ACO) is responsible for analyzing and investigating federal executive branch officials based on their financial disclosure forms. The ACO also is responsible for investigating corruption within the federal executive branch or in matters involving federal funds, except for funds transferred to the provinces. Although nominally a part of the judicial branch, the ACO does not have authority to prosecute cases independently, but it can refer cases to other agencies or serve as the plaintiff and request a judge to initiate a case. Individual judges investigated most high-profile corruption cases, but prosecutions were not expected in a number of such cases that began in 2007.

The minister of defense dismissed 31 senior officers and officials in August 2008 and another 13 in September 2008 following investigations into corrupt practices, and in September the army chief of staff resigned following his indictment over the illegal diversion of public funds in 2002 in another command. Judicial authorities were pursuing the investigations with the ministry's support.

According to press reports, the minister of health continued to push for greater transparency in the procurement of pharmaceuticals by the agency responsible for providing medicines to senior citizens following allegations of price fixing and overcharging by suppliers, many of whom were also reportedly prominent campaign contributors in 2007. In November 2008 the agency head resigned at the government's request.

In December 2008 a foreign plea agreement by the German corporation [[Siemens]] identified by their initials and titles several high level officials in former governments as having accepted multimillion-dollar [[bribes]] in the controversial procurement of a national identification card system.
Investigations conducted by the NGO Poder Ciudadano in June and the National Electoral Court in September 2008 cited irregularities in the campaign finance reports of the 2007 presidential candidates. Their findings concluded that some candidates underreported their official campaign expenses, particularly regarding advertising costs; others overreported their expenses; and some received anonymous donations, which is prohibited by law. Poder Ciudadano's report also alleged that public resources were used to promote President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's campaign.

An executive decree provides for public access to government information from executive agencies, which are required to answer requests for public information within 10 working days, with a possible 10-day extension. The capacity to comply with this requirement, however, varies across executive agencies. Poder Ciudadano estimates that executive branch agencies answered such requests within the required timeframe approximately 70 percent of the time. The NGO notes that politically sensitive requests, such as the operational costs of the presidency, often were delayed or went unanswered.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

== Governmental response to investigation of alleged human rights violations==
A wide variety of domestic and international human rights groups generally operates without government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials usually are cooperative and generally responsive to their views.

While the government cooperates with some international and local NGOs, the local chapter of a well-known international organization expressed concern in 2008 that, despite repeated requests, the government did not provide information under a freedom of information decree.
The government has a Human Rights Secretariat and a National Ombudsman's Office.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

== Discrimination, societal abuses, and trafficking in persons==
The law prohibits discrimination based on race, gender, disability, language, or social status, and the government generally enforced these prohibitions in practice.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

=== Women===
{{Main|Women's rights in Argentina}}
[[Image:Fruit jam-2.JPG|Working woman in San Rafael, Mendoza, Argentina|thumb]]

In 1985, Argentina ratified the Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo, Irene. [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Women's+human+rights+in+Argentina:+advances,+setbacks+and+the+tasks...-a0105915332 Women's human rights in Argentina: advances, setbacks and the tasks ahead. (National Contexts).] Women's Health Collection. 01-01-03. Accessed 01-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, women are the constant target of aggressive machism. Domestical violence including marital rape, widespread pornography and teenaged female prostitution as well as political underrepresentation are effects of the Argentinian machist patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;''"Hoy a las mujeres, desde muy niñas, se les envía el mensaje de que es necesario ser joven, bonita y atractiva, así como tener un cuerpo delgado y bien formado: relegándolas a un rol pasivo, en el cual son dependientes de los hombres y buscan tenerlos satisfechos. Por lo general tienen un papel secundario y se las ubica en la casa, en la familia o en trabajos profesionales que dependen de figuras masculinas."'', Buglione, Laura - Kremky, Ma. Eugenia; [http://www.monografias.com/trabajos42/machismo-television/machismo-television.shtml La Televisión Argentina y el machismo], [http://www.monografias.com/ ''Monografias'']. Accessed 01-10-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Domestic violence in Argentina]] against women is a serious problem. Rape, including spousal rape, is a crime, but the need for proof, either in the form of clear physical injury or the testimony of a witness, often presented difficulties in prosecuting such crimes. In August 2008 Amnesty International reported that a woman died every two days as a result of domestic violence. According to press reports quoting the Buenos Aires Provincial Ministry of Security statistics, 52,351 complaints of domestic abuse were filed at the [[Women's Police Stations]] in Buenos Aires Province in the first 10 months of the year.

Trafficking of women to and within the country for prostitution is a problem.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

=== Children===
Although the government voices strong commitment to children's rights and welfare, many programs remain underfunded.
In September 2008 the Congress passed a law that maintained the 40-day timeframe in which parents can register the birth of their children but reduced from six years to 20 days the time thereafter for the state to register the births if parents failed to do so. For a birth occurring without medical assistance or outside a medical center, the government may authorize late registration up until one year after the birth; thereafter, only judges may order birth registrations.

While the law provides for free and compulsory education for 13 years, beginning at age five, it has not been enforced effectively. The governor of Buenos Aires estimates that there were approximately 400,000 children who neither worked nor attended school in Buenos Aires Province alone.
Child abuse continues to occur and is not uncommon; for example, a University of Buenos Aires study released in August 2008 noted that 56 kindergartens and primary schools in Buenos Aires Province had detected 1,590 cases of family violence in the previous year. The government does however take some measures to combat child abuse.

The National Council for Children, Adolescents, and the Family continues to conduct public awareness campaigns and operates a national hot line, which children use to call for advice, make complaints, and report instances of abuse or other rights violations. Prosecutors and police pursue cases of Internet child pornography. In June 2008 the Congress passed a law criminalizing child pornography; however, the law does not penalize possession by individuals for personal use. The press and local NGOs reported that children were involved in sexual exploitation, sex tourism, and drug trafficking. Drawing on police statistics, the press estimates that approximately 5,000 children are recruited every year for pornography activities and sex tourism.

According to credible local press reports, dozens of child victims of violence from poor families are lodged in juvenile detention centers under judicial protection orders. City government observers are barred from visiting the centers. Local NGO Fundacion Sur express concern that the children may be subject to inhumane conditions and submitted a writ of habeas corpus in 2008 asking the courts to release the children and investigate the 2007 cases of two adolescents who allegedly committed suicide in separate incidents after having been raped while in detention. In December 2008 the Supreme Court rejected the petition but acknowledged the need to pass legislation to bring the juvenile justice system into compliance with international norms.

In December 2008 the newspaper La Nacion reported that a local NGO estimated that 3,000 children under five years of age died from malnourishment in 2008, down one-third since 2003.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

===Human trafficking===
{{main|Marita Veron}}
{{see also|Human trafficking in Argentina}}
In April 2008 the Congress passed a law criminalizing trafficking in persons, largely due to the [[Marita Veron]] case. The country is still a source, transit point, and destination for trafficked persons.

Trafficking in persons primarily involves citizens trafficked within the country for the purposes of sexual and labor exploitation. They were trafficked mostly from the northern provinces to the central provinces and Buenos Aires and from Buenos Aires to several southern provinces. To a lesser degree, the country is a destination for victims, principally women and minors from Paraguay, the Dominican Republic, Bolivia, and Brazil.
While there are no official reports on the activities of traffickers, the media reports that traffickers often present themselves as employment agencies or as individual recruiters. Credible sources also identify large organized crime networks, which sometimes consisted of extended families plus their business associates, including recruiters and brothel managers. Traffickers confiscated travel documents to prevent victims from appealing to authorities for protection. Victims, particularly women and girls in prostitution, at times are denied contact with the outside world. Victims often are threatened or beaten.

Traffickers can be prosecuted under the new federal law, which provides penalties for trafficking ranging from three to 15 years in prison, depending on the nature of the violation and the age of the victim. Traffickers have been prosecuted on charges of prostitution through fraud, intimidation, and coercion or, in the case of minors, alien smuggling, indentured servitude, and similar abuses.

Trafficking investigations and arrests increased in 2008. According to Ministry of Justice statistics, internal security agencies conducted 118 raids, arrested 120 persons suspected of human trafficking, and rescued 133 victims in the six-month period after the law took effect in late April. However, only 33 of those arrested remained in detention as of November. Official statistics on the number of prosecutions and convictions for trafficking during the year were unavailable. The Ministry of Justice was the lead agency for coordinating antitrafficking efforts with internal security agencies.

There are no allegations of federal government official involvement in trafficking. However, there are reports of widespread corruption and collusion with traffickers at provincial and local levels, which impeded prosecution. There are some efforts to investigate and prosecute local police and officials suspected of involvement in human trafficking.

There are no developments in the investigation of local police and official involvement in a 2006 case where women were forced into prostitution in Chubut Province. Press reports indicated that the two former police officers, who were charged in 2006, were reassigned without facing disciplinary actions. In March, 14 women were rescued from forced prostitution in brothels that continued to operate in the area.

In December 2008 a federal judge summoned the police commissioner, his deputy, and three other police officials for deposition as part of an investigation into alleged police protection of a ring of brothels suspected of human trafficking in the Mataderos neighborhood of Buenos Aies. In the same case, a woman running the brothel was indicted as an accessory to human trafficking, and her sister was also under investigation at year's end.
Trafficking victims normally are not detained, jailed, or deported. The Ministry of Justice's training seminars for internal security forces included a component emphasizing that they not blame trafficking victims for illegal activities they may have become involved in as a consequence of their exploitation.

Limited victims' assistance is provided by the Ministry of Justice's First Responder Office for the Rescue and Immediate Assistance of Trafficking Victims. It refers minor and adult victims rescued in the city or province of Buenos Aires to the Ministry of Social Development's Secretariat for Children, Adolescents, and the Family, which then may direct victims to existing social and medical assistance programs. Victims in other provinces usually were assisted by the relevant human rights secretariat. The Prosecutor General's Office of Victim's Assistance continues to provide assistance on an as-needed basis.

Although it does not operate victim shelters dedicated to trafficking, the government funds one NGO to operate a victim's shelter. Some victims qualified for federal government assistance, but most provincial officials are not trained to identify or help victims of trafficking specifically. The [[International Organization for Migration]] assists with repatriation and reintegration of foreign victims of trafficking.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

=== Persons with disabilities===
The constitution and laws prohibit discrimination against people with physical or mental disabilities in employment, education, access to health care, or the provision of other state services, but the government does not effectively enforce these laws. A specific law also mandates access to buildings for persons with disabilities; however, the government does not effectively enforce it.

Laws mandating greater access to buses and trains for persons with disabilities also are not enforced fully. In March 2008 a federal court ordered the Buenos Aires subway operator Metrovias to make subway stations handicapped accessible. According to the Association for Civil Rights, only 12 of 73 subway stations were handicapped accessible.

According to the [[National Institute Against Discrimination, Xenophobia and Racism]] (INADI), an estimated 20,000 children with disabilities were unable to attend school in Buenos Aires City in 2008 because the buildings were not handicapped accessible.

In March 2008 the Buenos Aires City Ombudsman pressed charges against eight long distance bus companies for failing to provide free bus tickets to persons with disabilities, as required by decree. Thereafter, INADI established a permanent office at the main bus terminal in Buenos Aires City and maintained a presence at many train and bus stations throughout the city on a rotational basis.

A 2007 study by CELS and international NGO Mental Disability Rights International reported that 25,000 persons were detained in psychiatric institutions, more than 80 percent for more than a year. The report documented egregious cases of abuse and neglect in psychiatric institutions, including patients burned to death in isolation cells, the use of sensory deprivation in long-term isolation, and physical and sexual violence. The report also detailed dangerous and unhygienic conditions, including the lack of running water, nonfunctioning sewer systems, and fire and safety hazards.

The National Advisory Committee for the Integration of People with Disabilities, under the National Council for Coordination of Social Policies, has formal responsibility for actions to accommodate persons with disabilities.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

=== Indigenous people===
The constitution recognizes the ethnic and cultural identities of indigenous people and states that the Congress shall protect their right to bilingual education, recognize their communities and the communal ownership of their ancestral lands, and allow for their participation in the management of their natural resources. In practice indigenous people do not fully participate in the management of their lands or natural resources, in part because responsibility for implementing the law is delegated to the 23 provinces, only 11 of which have constitutions recognizing indigenous rights.

Although there is no formal process to recognize indigenous tribes or determine who is an indigenous person, indigenous communities can register with the provincial or federal government as a civic association.

Estimates of the indigenous population ranged from 700,000 to 1.5 million. Poverty rates are higher than average in areas with large indigenous populations. Indigenous people have greater than average rates of illiteracy, chronic disease, and unemployment. The lack of trained teachers hampers government efforts to offer bilingual education opportunities to indigenous people.

According to indigenous rights experts, 75 percent of disputed territory in Jujuy, which had been the subject of court orders in 2006 and 2007, was either returned to indigenous communities or in the titling process by the end of 2008.

In October 2008 the Supreme Court overruled a Salta provincial court decision to turn down an appeal by the Eben Ezer indigenous community, which asked the provincial court to issue an injunction preventing the sale of provincial land previously considered a natural reserve. The Supreme Court indicated that the provincial court's decision violated the constitution and instructed the provincial court to take into consideration the rights of indigenous people to use the resources found on ancestral lands.

In December 2008, in response to a lawsuit filed by 18 indigenous communities, the Supreme Court ordered Salta Province to suspend plans to cut approximately {{convert|2|e6acre|km2}} of forest, pending the outcome of a further hearing.

According to a Minority Rights Group International report from 2008, many provinces evicted indigenous communities from ancestral lands to sell the land to multinational companies, particularly for petroleum, mining, soy industries, and tourism development.

In December 2008, after protesters from the [[Mapuche]] community staged a roadblock, the Chubut Provincial Supreme Court suspended a lower court order evicting a Mapuche family from land they had occupied since 1940. The protesters expressed concern that Chubut Province would evict more indigenous families to provide concessions to mining companies.

The land dispute between the Mbya Guaraní community and La Plata National University over claims to territory in Misiones Province is still without resolution.

The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) continues to evaluate a petition presented by the Lhaka Honhat indigenous association regarding the national government's failure to implement a titling policy that would return their traditional land. The Lhaka Honhat association sent a letter to the IACHR in September 2008 asking for greater involvement and a timely resolution to the case.

In October 2008 three Mapuche families occupied land in the National Park of Nahuel Huapi in Neuquen Province in an attempt to obtain {{convert|123000|acre|km2}} for other Mapuche communities. Park officials indicated that they already coexisted with five Mapuche communities in the area.

Also in October 2008 the first indigenous radio station, the Indigenous Voice, began broadcasting programs aimed at indigenous communities in Salta Province.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

=== LGBT rights===
{{main|LGBT rights in Argentina|Transgender rights in Argentina}}
During 2008, INADI received 82 complaints of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, 38 of which were resolved rapidly.
In July 2008 authorities arrested Sergio Alfredo Nunez, Silvio Elias Soria, and Cesar Javier Ulivarri in connection with the 2006 killing of transgender activist Pelusa Liendro, who was found stabbed in her car 10 days after the broadcast of an undercover videotape she and other activists made of police harassment and abuse of transgender persons in Salta Province. Nunez and Soria remained in pretrial detention at year's end. The court stayed legal proceedings against Rodolfo Aguilares and two other individuals.

In August 2008 the National Social Security Administration granted widowed homosexual partners the rights to inherit their partner's pension. Eligible partners must demonstrate that they lived with their partner for at least five years.

INADI received 62 discrimination complaints on the basis of HIV positive status, 34 of which were resolved rapidly. The law prohibits termination of employment of HIV positive employees.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

=== Intersex rights ===
{{main|Intersex rights in Argentina}}
[[Intersex]] people in Argentina have no recognition of their rights to physical integrity and bodily autonomy, and no specific protections from discrimination on the basis of sex characteristics. Cases also exist of children being denied access to birth certificates without their parents being pressured into consenting to medical interventions.&lt;ref name="justicia2017"&gt;{{Cite web| last1 = Justicia Intersex| last2 = Zwischengeschlecht.org| author2-link = Zwischengeschlecht | title = NGO Report to the 6th and 7th Periodic Report of Argentina on the Convention Against Torture (CAT)| location = Buenos Aires| date = March 2017 | url = http://intersex.shadowreport.org/public/2017-CAT-Justicia-Intersex-Zwischengeschlecht-IGM.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Labor rights==
===Right of association===
The law provides all workers, with the exception of military personnel, the right to form and join "free and democratic labor unions, recognized by simple inscription in a special register," and workers exercised this right. An estimated 35 to 40 percent of the workforce was organized.

The Argentine Workers Central (CTA) and other labor groups not affiliated with the CGT contends that the Trade Unions Law provision for the legal recognition of only one union per sector conflicts with the International Labor Organization's (ILO) Convention 87 and prevents the CTA from obtaining full legal standing. In November 2008 the Supreme Court declared Article 41 of the Trade Unions Law unconstitutional and upheld the right of a workers' union lacking official legal recognition to elect its own delegates. In addition the ruling asserted that the Ministry of Labor's discretion in awarding official union recognition violates international treaties. The IACHR continues to review the CTA's 2004 petition to this day.

Unions have the right to strike, although those representing civil servants and workers in essential services are subject to the condition that undefined "minimum services" are rendered. In some cases "minimum services" have already been incorporated in union bargaining agreements, but since the law does not define "minimum services," civil servants and workers in essential services have the right to strike only after a compulsory 15-day conciliation process. Once that term expires, civil servants and workers in essential services must give five days' notice to the administrative authority and the public agency that they intend to strike. All parties then negotiate which minimum services will continue to be provided and a schedule for their provision. The public agency, in turn, must provide two days' notice to users about the intended strike. Other workers exercised the right to strike by conducting legal strikes.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

===Right to organize and bargain collectively===
The law provides unions with the right to negotiate collective bargaining agreements and to have recourse to conciliation and arbitration. The Ministry of Labor, Employment, and Social Security ratifies collective bargaining agreements, which covers roughly 75 percent of the formally employed workforce. According to the ILO, the ratification process impedes free collective bargaining because the ministry considered not only whether a collective labor agreement contained clauses violating public order standards but also whether the agreement complied with productivity, investment, technology, and vocational training criteria. However, there are no known cases of government refusal to approve any collective agreements under these criteria.

There are no special laws or exemptions from regular labor laws in the three functioning export processing zones.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

===Prohibition of forced or compulsory labor===
While the law prohibits forced or compulsory labor, including by children, there were isolated reports that such practices occurred.

In April police rescued 30 Bolivians, including children, who were working under exploitative conditions at a poultry farm in Capilla del Senor, Buenos Aires Province. In August 2008 the press reported that children and other workers were working in exploitative conditions at other farms owned by the same company. The provincial ministry of labor fined the company 364,000 pesos ($117,400) and was reviewing additional forced labor complaints, including two deaths, lodged against the company. Press reports indicated the company had not paid the fine by year's end.

In September 2008 an appeals court reversed a lower court decision dismissing a case of forced labor against the owners of a prestigious garment company that employed Bolivians working in sweatshops under exploitative conditions. The lower court had dismissed the case on the basis that the Bolivians were culturally predisposed to working under such conditions. The case remains under investigation.

In September 2008 a federal judge indicted the owner and the manager of a garment sweatshop that employed 50 Bolivians, including 20 minors. The judge froze 900,000 pesos ($290,000) in assets belonging to the owner and seized and transferred sewing machines to a social organization of the employees' choosing so they could continue working. The case remained pending at year's end.

A Buenos Aires city court released four individuals in 2008 on probation in a 2006 case of forced labor. According to a local antislavery NGO, the individuals were charged for their role in operating clothing sweatshops in the Flores Sur neighborhood that left six Bolivian citizens dead and affected potentially hundreds more.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

===Prohibition of child labor and minimum age for employment===
The law protects children from exploitation in the workplace. In 2004 the National Commission for the Eradication of Child Labor (CONAETI) estimated that up to 1.5 million children, or 22 percent of children under the age of 15, worked in some capacity, an estimate still considered valid.
In June 2008 the Congress passed a law raising the minimum age for employment from 14 to 15, which will increase to 16; in rare cases the Ministry of Education may authorize a younger child to work as part of a family unit. Children between the ages of 15 and 18 may work in a limited number of job categories and for limited hours if they have completed compulsory schooling, which normally ends at age 18. Legal penalties for employing underage workers ranged from 1,000 to 5,000 pesos ($303 to $1,515) for each child employed. Provincial governments and the city government of Buenos Aires are responsible for labor law enforcement.

Most illegal child labor takes place in the [[informal sector]], where inspectors have limited ability to enforce the law. Child labor includes such work as small scale garment production, trash recycling, street sales, domestic service, and food preparation and agricultural production.

CONAETI conducts seminars with the 19 provincial commissions for the eradication of child labor to train provincial authorities responsible for enforcing labor laws and raising awareness regarding exploitive child labor. It also provides technical assistance to NGOs addressing child labor in the tobacco and trash-picking sectors, including workshops with tobacco producers to encourage corporate social responsibility on child labor issues. The government works with several NGOs to address the commercial sexual exploitation of children in the triborder area with Brazil and Paraguay, disseminating information on prevention and available assistance for victims. A trinational network involving local government and civil society was established in 2008 to help coordinate the antitrafficking efforts.

The government participates in the MERCOSUR "Nino Sur" ("Southern Child") initiative to defend the rights of children and adolescents in the region. The initiative includes unified public campaigns against commercial sexual exploitation, trafficking and child labor, mutual technical assistance, and the exchange of best practices related to victims protection and assistance.

The Ministry of Education also provides scholarships to reintegrate school dropouts and supported children who work and attend school. The program also provides parents with job search assistance and job training.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

===Acceptable conditions of work===
The government increased the monthly minimum wage in October, bringing the total monthly minimum wage to 1,440 pesos ($387). This exceeded the estimated amount of 1,013 ($272) a month needed by a family of four to maintain a "decent" standard of living. Most workers in the formal sector earned significantly more than the minimum wage. The Ministry of Labor, which is responsible for enforcing legislation related to working conditions, continued inspections to get companies to register their informal workers. In November the Ministry of Labor reported informal urban unemployment at 40 percent. According to a 2007 ILO study, 60 percent of employed citizens ages 15 to 24 were engaged in informal labor.
Federal labor law sets standards in the areas of health, safety, and hours. The maximum workday is eight hours, and the maximum workweek is 48 hours. Overtime pay is required for hours worked in excess of these limits. The law sets minimums for periods of rest, requiring a minimum of 12 hours of rest to start a new workday. Sundays are holidays, and those required to work on Sundays are paid double. However, laws governing acceptable conditions of work were not enforced universally, particularly for workers in the informal sector.
The law requires employers to ensure their employees against accidents at the workplace and when traveling to and from work. Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous or unhealthy work situations without jeopardy to continued employment. However, workers who leave the workplace before it has been proven unsafe risk being fired; in such cases the worker has the right to judicial appeal, but the process can be very lengthy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/wha/136098.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ikeja Bus Terminal''' is located [[Ikeja]], the capital city of [[Lagos State]].

'''Jiaobei blocks''' or '''moon blocks''' ({{zh|t=筊杯 or 珓杯|p=jiǎo bēi|j=gaau2 bui1|l=fortune-telling cups}}) are wooden [[divination]] tools originating from [[China]], which are used in pairs and thrown to answer a [[Yes-no question|yes or no question]]. They are made out of wood or bamboo and carved into a crescent shape. Each block is round on one side (known as the ''[[Yin and yang|yin]]'' side) and flat on the other (known as the ''[[Yin and yang|yang]]'' side). It is one of the more commonly used items found in [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese traditional religion]] and are used in temples and home shrines along with [[kau cim|fortune sticks]], both of which are often used together when requesting an answer from the gods.

==Practice==
Jiaobei blocks can be used separately to receive a straightforward answer, or they are accompanied by fortune sticks to clarify an oracle. When used alone, jiaobei blocks are first purified by revolving the blocks around the incense burner three times. The querent then kneels and says their name, date of birth, residence, and question while cupping the blocks between their hands in prayer. After the querent poses the question to the gods, the blocks are dropped to the floor and land in a specific position. 

There are four possible answers that the jiaobei blocks can produce:

# ''Shèngjiǎo'' (聖筊, divine answer): One block flat and another block round is a 'yes' answer.
# ''Nùjiǎo'' (怒筊, angry answer) also ''kūjiao'' (哭筊, crying answer): Both blocks round is a 'no' answer. It is said that the gods are displeased by the question, and is shown in the way the blocks directly fall flat on the floor.
# ''Xiàojiǎo'' (笑筊, laughing answer): Both blocks flat have different interpretations; either it can be an emphasized 'no' answer and a sign that the gods are laughing at the question, or that they are laughing because the querent should know the answer, or that the answer to the question is obvious. One characteristic of this answer is when the blocks sway back and forth when dropped, a symbolic show of laughter.
# ''Lìjiǎo'' (立筊, standing answer): One or both blocks fall but stand erect on the floor indicate that the deities do not understand the referent's question, therefore the question is nullified and the procedure must be repeated. 

When used alone without the fortune sticks, the blocks are thrown three times in order to maintain accuracy of the deity's answer, a successful answer usually being three consecutive throws showing ''shèngjiǎo'', or best two out of three throws.

==Usages==
[[File:擲筊 (4684775644).jpg|thumb|right|200px|A set of jiaobei]]
[[File:Jiaobei.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jiaobei blocks]]

Aside from questioning the deities on mundane affairs, jiaobei blocks are also used to verify a range of issues, such as proper ritual protocol, spiritual presence of the gods or if they have eaten the offerings presented to them.

'''Kaloeng''' (Kalerng, Kaleung) is a [[Southwestern Tai languages|Southwestern]] [[Tai languages|Tai]] language of [[Thailand]] and [[Laos]].

==Distribution==
In Thailand, Kaloeng is spoken in [[Sakon Nakhon Province]], [[Nakhon Phanom Province]], and [[Mukdahan Province]] (Trongdee 2016). In Laos, it is spoken in [[Khammouan Province]].

==External classification==
Mudjalin Luksanawong (2016:56) classifies the Kaloeng language as part of the [[Sakon Nakhon]] subbranch of the Southwestern Tai.
*Nakhon Phanom
**''[[Nakhon Phanom]]''
*Sakon Nakhon
**Yoy-Yooy-Kalööng
***''[[Yoy language|Yoy]]''
***''Yooy''
***''Kalööng''

In the Sakon Nakhon languages, [[Proto-Tai language|Proto-Tai]] *hw- and *w- (Pittayaporn 2009:134-135) became /ph/- (Trongdee 2016:55). Also, the Sakon Nakhon languages display the uncommon labiovelar initial clusters thw-, cw-, sw-, hw-, ŋw-, lw-, ʔw- (Trongdee 2016:56).

==Internal classification==
Thananan Trongdee (2016:68) classifies the Kaloeng dialects as follows according to the evolution of the Proto-Kaloeng [[diphthong]] *-aɯ.

'''Lhao Vo''', also known as '''Maru''' and '''Langsu''' ({{zh|浪速}}), is a [[Burmish language]] of Burma with a few thousand speakers in China.

==Distribution==
Dai Qingxia (2005:3) reports 5,600 Langsu speakers in China. Many thousands more are dispersed across the eastern edge of [[Kachin State]], Burma.
*[[Luxi City]]: Yingpan Township 营盘乡
*[[Lianghe County]]: Mengyang Township 勐养乡
*[[Longchuan County, Yunnan|Longchuan County]]: Bangwai Township 邦外乡 and Jingkan Township 景坎乡

The Langsu people call themselves ''lɔ̃˧˩ vɔ˧˩'' (Chinese: ''Lang'e'' 浪峨) (Dai 2003:3; Dai 2010:10)&lt;ref&gt;Dai Qingxia [戴庆厦] (2010). ''The Chashan people of Pianma and their language'' [片马茶山人及其语言]. Beijing: The Commercial Press [商务印书馆].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varieties==
The standard Lhaovo dialect is that of the Dagoʔ (''tăkoʔ'') hill area, on the east side of [[N'Mai River]] valley in [[Kachin State]].&lt;ref name="Sawada2017"/&gt;

Sawada (2017) lists the following patois (subvarieties) of Lhaovo.&lt;ref name="Sawada2017"&gt;Sawada, Hideo. 2017. ''Two Undescribed Dialects of Northern Burmish Sub-branch: Gyannoʔ and Thoʔlhang''. Presented at ICSTLL 50, Beijing, China.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Gyannoʔ''' (autonym: ''kjɛn35 noʔ21''): spoken in the west side of the N'Mai River in [[Sawlaw Township]].
*'''Thoʔlhang''' (autonym: ''tʰaʔ21 lo̰22''): spoken in [[Htawlang]] and a few other villages in northern Sawlaw Township.
*'''Lakin''' (autonym: ''lăkɛ̰22''): spoken in [[Lakin, Burma|Lakin]] village, northern Sawlaw Township.
*'''Lhangsu''' (autonym: ''la̰ŋ53 su53''; not the same as Langsu 浪速 of Yunnan): spoken in the area between Hkrang Hka and Sanin Hka, which are two tributaries of the Mali Hka. It is spoken in [[Sumprabum Township]], including in the villages of {{lang|ha|Hting Tsa, N-gawk Hkyet}}, and {{lang|ha|Ma Awng}}.

===Langsong===
The Langsong 浪宋 are found in Zaoyang 早阳&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vdefault.aspx?departmentid=60920&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Yunlong County]] (in the Chinese province of [[Yunnan]]) as well as in Baocun 表村,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=37739&lt;/ref&gt; Laomo 老末, and Sancha 三岔.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=37740&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;中国少数民族社会历史调查资料丛刊修订编辑委员会. 2009. 景颇族社会历史调查, p.57.

This is a '''list of the fastest-selling product''' superlatives. The definition of "fastest-selling" typically refers to sales results in the first week of a product's release, (i.e., which product had the biggest launch). Sometimes, rather than comparing sales figures relative to time, the target to be reached is fixed (e.g. sales at 5 million units), and the comparison is based upon how many weeks it takes to reach it (e.g. 52 weeks vs. 56 weeks).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2955">The '''Luvale''' people, also called (in Angola) the ''Luena'' or ''Lwena'',are an ethnic group in [[Zambia]] and [[Angola]]. In Zambia they are found mainly in the [[North-Western Province (Zambia)|North-Western Province]] of [[Zambia]], centred in the town of [[Zambezi, Zambia|Zambezi]] which was previously called ''Balovale''. Some Zambian Luvale have left their ancestral lands for economic reasons and can be found in other locations in [[Zambia]] such as [[Lukanga Swamp]]. There is also considerable Rural-Urban migration to [[Lusaka]]. In Angola they reside in eastern Moxico Province.

The Lovale people are not united under one paramount chief but are composed of a number of subgroups speaking the [[Lovale language]] or dialects of it. The Luvale language (sometimes called Lwena) is a west central [[Bantu language]], and a [[tonal language]]. The Lovale are closely related to the [[Chokwe people|Chokwe]] who ended the [[Lunda Kingdom]], and Chokwe and [[Lunda people]] also live in the same area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/toc/people/Luvale.html University of Iowa: Art &amp; Life in Africa, Luvale People] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211073641/http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/toc/people/Luvale.html |date=2006-12-11 }} website access 1 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
==The Zambian Makishi Festival==

In Zambia the Luvale people hold the 'Makishi festival' to mark the end of the 'kumukanda' (or 'initiation'). Every 5 years or so, boys from the same age group (young teenagers) are taken into the bush for 1–2 months where they undergo several rites of passage into manhood. These involve learning certain survival skills, learning about women and how to be a good husband, learning about fatherhood, and also they are [[Circumcision surgical procedure|circumcised]]. The Luvale consider uncircumcised men to be dirty or unhygienic. It is said that in some very rural areas where the kumukanda is maintained in its strictest traditional sense that if a woman is to pass by the boy's 'bushcamp' whilst they are undergoing kumukanda then she must be punished.To celebrate the boys' completion of the kumukanda the Makishi festival welcomes them back to the village as men. The masks represent specific characters: Pwebo (a female character... 'pwebo' meaning 'woman' in Luvale) and Chizaluke amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;Anecdotal&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==

In the Swedish 1997 [[murder mystery]] novel "[[Faceless Killers]]", Inspector [[Kurt Wallander]] investigates a murderous racist attack on a refugee center in [[Skane]] and finds it difficult to communicate with a witness who speaks only the Luvale language. The problem is resolved when a 90-year-old former woman missionary is found, who speaks Luvale fluently and acts as the interpreter.

'''Marvin John Heemeyer''' (October 28, 1951 – June 4, 2004) was an American [[welder]] and an [[automobile]] [[muffler]] repair shop owner most known for his rampage with a modified bulldozer. Outraged over zoning disputes, he armored a [[Komatsu Limited|Komatsu]] D355A [[bulldozer]] with layers of steel and concrete and used it on June 4, 2004 to demolish the town hall, the former mayor's house, and other buildings in [[Granby, Colorado]]. The rampage ended when the bulldozer got stuck in the basement of a Gambles store he was in the process of destroying. Heemeyer then committed suicide.

Heemeyer had been feuding with Granby officials, particularly over fines for violating city ordinances and a zoning dispute regarding a concrete batch plant constructed opposite his muffler shop.&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5139598/ |title=Man who bulldozed through Colo. town is dead |publisher=[[Msnbc.com]] |date=June 5, 2004 |accessdate=August 31, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023065604/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5139598/|archivedate=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Heemeyer lived in [[Grand Lake, Colorado]], about {{convert|16|mi|km}} away from Granby.&lt;ref name="cozine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cozine.com/archive/cc2004/01250121.html |title=The Dark Side of Paradise |first=Allen |last=Best |work=Colorado Central Magazine |date=July 2004 |accessdate=June 5, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070311112300/http://www.cozine.com/archive/cc2004/01250121.html |archivedate = March 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a neighbor, Heemeyer moved to town more than 10 years before the incident. Heemeyer's friends stated that he had no relatives in the Granby–Grand Lake area.&lt;ref name="UMDstudents"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umdstudents.com/viewtopic.php?t=6125 |title=Armed man goes on bulldozer rampage |publisher=UMDstudents.com |accessdate=June 5, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070220134042/http://umdstudents.com/viewtopic.php?t=6125 |archivedate = February 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Bauldree, a friend of Heemeyer, said that Heemeyer was a likable person. Ken Heemeyer said his brother "would bend over backwards for anyone". While many people described Heemeyer as an affable person, local resident Christie Baker claimed that her husband was threatened by Heemeyer after refusing to pay for a disputed muffler repair.&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{cite news |title='Something snapped': Suspect called emotional, angry over rezoning fight |last=Ingold |first=John |author2=Brittany Anas |author3=Howard Pankratz  |date=June 6, 2004 |work=[[The Denver Post]] |pages=A01 |quote='He has threatened my husband's life,' resident Christie Baker recalled. 'He threatened my husband over a muffler.' Baker said she and her husband, Doug, had taken a truck to Heemeyer's shop, and he installed the wrong type of muffler on it. They refused to pay, and Christie Baker said they soon heard through word of mouth about Heemeyer's threat. They paid the $124 in cash, using an intermediary to give Heemeyer the money, she said.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baker said her husband later paid Heemeyer $124 via an [[intermediary]].&lt;ref name="Baker"/&gt;

==Zoning dispute==
In 1992, Heemeyer purchased {{convert|2|acre|ha|abbr=off}} of land from the [[Resolution Trust Corporation]], the federal agency organized to handle the assets of failed savings and loan institutions. He purchased the land for $42,000 to build a muffler shop and subsequently agreed to sell the land to Cody Docheff to build a concrete batch plant, [[Mountain Park Concrete]]. The agreed price was $250,000. According to Susan Docheff, Heemeyer changed his mind and increased the price to $375,000 and later demanded a deal worth approximately $1 million. Some believed that this negotiation happened before the rezoning proposal was heard by the town council.&lt;ref name="Durango"/&gt;

In 2001, the zoning commission and the town's trustees approved the construction of a concrete batch plant. Heemeyer attempted to appeal the decision but was unsuccessful. For many years, Heemeyer had used the adjacent property as a way to get to his muffler shop. The plan for the concrete plant blocked that access. In addition to the frustration engendered by this dispute over access, Heemeyer was subsequently fined $2,500 by the Granby town council for various violations, including "junk cars on the property and not being hooked up to the sewer line" that had been disconnected during construction of the concrete plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Common dispute' sparked outburst: Run-of-the-mill fight over land use led down final path|work=[[Rocky Mountain News]]|location=Denver|date=June 8, 2004|last=Brennan|first=Charlie|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-117992939.html|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/3390654/detail.html |publisher=[[KMGH-TV]] |title=Granby Rampage Damage Expected To Exceed several Million |date=June 7, 2004 |accessdate=September 7, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070115225652/http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/3390654/detail.html |archivedate=January 15, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bulldozer modification (Killdozer)==
[[File:Killdozer.jpg|thumb|250px|Heemeyer used this armor-plated [[Komatsu Limited|Komatsu]] D355A bulldozer to destroy 13 buildings in [[Granby, Colorado]].]]
Heemeyer leased his business to a trash company and sold the property several months before the rampage.  He had bought a bulldozer two years before the incident, with the intention of using it to build an alternative route to his muffler shop, but city officials rejected his request to build it.

Notes found by investigators after the incident indicated that the primary motivation for the bulldozer rampage was his plan to stop a concrete plant from being built near his shop. These notes indicated that he held grudges over the zoning approval. "I was always willing to be reasonable until I had to be unreasonable", he wrote. "Sometimes reasonable men must do unreasonable things."&lt;ref name="SmR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/tools/story_pf.asp?ID=9810 |title=Rampager was surprised his plans went unnoticed |work=[[The Spokesman Review]] |date=June 10, 2004 |accessdate=June 6, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311015838/http://www.spokesmanreview.com/tools/story_pf.asp?ID=9810 |archivedate=March 11, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Heemeyer took about a year and a half to prepare; in his notes he wrote: "It is interesting to observe that I was never caught. This was a part-time project over a {{frac|1|1|2}} year time period." Clearly he was surprised that several men, who had visited the shed late the previous year, had not noticed the modified bulldozer "...especially with the 2000-pound [900kg] lift fully exposed... Somehow their vision was clouded."&lt;ref name="SmR"/&gt;

The machine used in the incident was a modified [[Komatsu Limited|Komatsu]] D355A bulldozer,&lt;ref name="denverchannel"/&gt; fitted with makeshift armor plating covering the cabin, [[engine]], and parts of the [[caterpillar track|tracks]]. In places, this armor was over {{convert|1|ft|cm}} thick, consisting of 5000-PSI Quikrete [[concrete]] mix sandwiched between sheets of [[tool steel]] (acquired from an automotive dealer in Denver), to make ad-hoc [[composite armor]]. This made the machine impervious to [[small arms]] fire and resistant to [[explosive]]s: indeed three external explosions and more than 200 rounds of [[ammunition]] fired at the bulldozer had no effect on it.&lt;ref name="msnbc" /&gt;

For visibility, the bulldozer was fitted with several [[video camera]]s linked to two [[computer display|monitors]] mounted on the vehicle's dashboard; the cameras were protected on the outside by {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on}} shields of bulletproof plastic.&lt;ref name="msnbc"/&gt; And compressed-air nozzles were fitted to blow dust away from the video cameras. Onboard fans and an air conditioner were used to keep Heemeyer cool while driving. He had made three gun-ports, fitted for a .50 caliber rifle, a .308 semi-automatic rifle, and a .22LR rifle, all fitted with a {{convert|1/2|in|cm|adj=mid|spell=in|-thick}} steel plate. Heemeyer apparently had no intention of leaving the cabin once he entered it.&lt;ref name="msnbc" /&gt; Authorities speculated that he may have used a homemade crane – found in his garage – to lower the armor hull over the dozer and himself. "Once he tipped that lid shut, he knew he wasn't getting out", Daly said. Investigators searched the garage where they believed that Heemeyer built the vehicle and found cement and armor steel.&lt;ref name="msnbc" /&gt;

Only Heemeyer died in the event (by a self-inflicted gunshot wound), but afterwards, the modified bulldozer came to be known as "Killdozer" (the name of [[Killdozer! (short story)|a short story]] written by [[Theodore Sturgeon]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/minisite.do?content_type=Minisite_Episodes&amp;content_type_id=56913&amp;display_order=2&amp;mini_id=56902 |publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] |title=Shockwave Episode 08 |date=February 1, 2008|accessdate= February 1, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080326153105/http://www.history.com/minisite.do?content_type=Minisite_Episodes&amp;content_type_id=56913&amp;display_order=2&amp;mini_id=56902 |archivedate = March 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attack==
On June 4, 2004, Heemeyer drove his armored bulldozer through the wall of his former business, the concrete plant, the Town Hall, the office of the local newspaper that editorialized against him, the home of a former mayor's widow, and a hardware store owned by another man Heemeyer named in a lawsuit, as well as a few others. Owners of all of the buildings that were damaged had some connection to Heemeyer's disputes.&lt;ref name="boston"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/10/24/after_bulldozer_rampage_town_strives_to_rebuild_trust/ |title=After bulldozer rampage, town strives to rebuild trust |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |first=Julie |last=Poppen |date=2004-10-24|accessdate=2006-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack lasted  for two hours and seven minutes, damaging 13 buildings,&lt;ref name="denverchannel"&gt;{{cite web | title= Crews Begin Dismantling Granby Bulldozer |url= http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/4393800/detail.html | accessdate= June 27, 2006 | publisher= [[KMGH-TV]] | date= April 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; knocking out natural gas service to City Hall and the concrete plant, damaging a truck, and destroying part of a utility service center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.francesfarmersrevenge.com/stuff/archive/oldnews5/rampages.htm |title=Rampages – Tanks, Bulldozers, Whatever You Got! |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017175241/http://www.francesfarmersrevenge.com/stuff/archive/oldnews5/rampages.htm |archivedate=2006-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the great damage to property, no one besides Heemeyer was killed.&lt;ref name="msnbc" /&gt;  The damage was estimated at $7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jason|first=Bellows|title=The Wrath of the Killdozer|url=http://www.damninteresting.com/the-wrath-of-the-killdozer/|work=DamnInteresting.com|accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="skyhigh"&gt;{{cite web |title=Granby: 2004 bulldozer rampage subject of History Channel program |url=http://www.skyhidailynews.com/article/20080106/NEWS/259348922 |work=Sky-Hi Daily News |first=Tonya |last=Bina |accessdate=May 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Grand County commissioner James Newberry, Grand County emergency dispatchers used the [[reverse 911]] emergency system to notify many residents and property owners of the rampage going on in the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Grudge spawns trail of destruction: Granby man kills himself after rampage in armor-plated bulldozer|work=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|The Gazette]]|location=Colorado Springs|date=June 6, 2004 |first=Deedee|last=Correll|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-2755691.html|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defenders of Heemeyer contended that he made a point of not hurting anybody during his bulldozer rampage;&lt;ref name="msnbc" /&gt; Ian Daugherty, a bakery owner, said Heemeyer "went out of his way" not to harm anyone. Others offered different views. The sheriff's department argued the fact that no one was injured was not due to good intent as much as it must have been due to luck. Heemeyer had installed two rifles in firing ports on the inside of the bulldozer,&lt;ref name="denverpost"&gt;{{cite web| title= Interior of Bulldozer |work=[[The Denver Post]]|url= http://extras.denverpost.com/slideshows/dozer_slideshow.html | accessdate= September 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fired 15 bullets from his rifle at power transformers and propane tanks. "Had these tanks ruptured and exploded, anyone within one-half mile (800&amp;nbsp;m) of the explosion could have been endangered", the sheriff's department said; within such a range were 12 police officers and residents of a senior citizens complex.&lt;ref name="Durango"/&gt; The sheriff's department also asserted Heemeyer fired many bullets from his semi-automatic rifle at Cody Docheff when Docheff tried to stop the assault on his concrete batch plant by using a [[wheel tractor-scraper]], which was pushed aside by Heemeyer's bulldozer. Later, Heemeyer fired on two state patrol officers before they had fired at him.&lt;ref name="Durango"/&gt; The sheriff's department also noted that 11 of the 13 buildings Heemeyer bulldozed were occupied until moments before their destruction. At the town library, for example, a children's program was in progress when the incident began.&lt;ref name="cozine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Durango"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.durangotelegraph.com/04-06-24/mountain_exchange.htm|title=Dozer rampage roots run deep|accessdate=March 7, 2008 |work=[[Durango Telegraph]] |date=June 24, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One officer dropped a [[Stun grenade|flash-bang grenade]] down the bulldozer's exhaust pipe, with no immediate apparent effect. Local and state patrol, including a SWAT team, walked behind and beside the bulldozer, occasionally firing, but the armored bulldozer was impervious to their shots. Attempts to disable the bulldozer's cameras with gunfire failed as the bullets were unable to penetrate the 3-inch (7.6 cm) bulletproof plastic. At one point during the rampage, [[Undersheriff]] Glenn Trainor climbed atop the bulldozer and rode the bulldozer "like a bronc-buster, trying to figure out a way to get a bullet inside the dragon".&lt;ref name="cozine"/&gt; However, he was eventually forced to jump off to avoid being hit with debris.&lt;ref name="cozine"/&gt;

At this point, local authorities and the Colorado State Patrol feared they were running out of options in terms of firepower, and that Heemeyer would soon turn against civilians in Granby. Then-governor [[Bill Owens (Colorado politician)|Bill Owens]] allegedly considered authorizing the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] to utilize either an [[AH-64 Apache|Apache]] attack helicopter equipped with a [[AGM-114 Hellfire|Hellfire]] missile or a two-man fire team equipped with a [[FGM-148 Javelin|Javelin]] anti tank missile to destroy the bulldozer, only to deem the option unnecessary due to Heemeyer getting stuck in the Gambles hardware store. As late as 2011, Governor Owens' staff still vehemently denied considering such a course of action, but since then members of the State Patrol revealed that, to the contrary, the governor did consider authorizing an attack but ultimately decided against it due to the potential for collateral damage of a missile strike in the heart of Granby being significantly higher than what Heemeyer could have caused with his bulldozer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Franscell|first1=Ron|title=The Crime Buff's Guide to the Outlaw Rocky Mountains|date=2011-04-05|publisher=Morris Book Publishing LLC|location=Guilford, Connecticut |pages=107–108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two problems arose as Heemeyer destroyed the Gambles hardware store. The radiator of the dozer had been damaged and the engine was leaking various fluids, and Gambles had a small basement. The bulldozer's engine failed, and Heemeyer dropped one tread into the basement, but couldn't get out. About a minute later, one of the SWAT team members, who had swarmed around the machine, reported hearing a single gunshot from inside the sealed cab. It was later determined that Heemeyer had shot himself in the head with a .357-caliber handgun.&lt;ref name="msnbc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Armored dozer was bad to go: Reporters get peek inside Heemeyer's destructive machine|work=[[Rocky Mountain News]]|location=Denver|date=June 25, 2004 |last=Aguilar|first=John|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-120544009.html|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police first used explosives in an attempt to remove the steel plates, but after the third explosion failed, they cut through them with an [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|oxyacetylene cutting torch]]. Grand County Emergency Management Director Jim Holahan stated that authorities were able to access and remove Heemeyer's body at 2:00{{nbsp}}a.m. on June 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Officials: Man who drove bulldozer is dead|work=[[The Oakland Tribune]]|location=San Jose|date=June 6, 2004 |first=P.Solomon|last=Banda|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-6987857.html|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fate of the bulldozer===
On April 19, 2005, the town announced plans to [[Scrap|scrap]] Heemeyer's bulldozer. The plan involved dispersing individual pieces to many separate scrap yards to prevent souvenir-taking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dozer digs its own grave: Used by angry resident to attack Granby, machine to be dismantled as scrap|work=[[Rocky Mountain News]]|location=Denver|date=March 1, 2005|last=Crecente|first=Brian D.|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-129458602.html|accessdate=January 17, 2016|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==
In addition to writings that he left on the wall of his shed, Heemeyer recorded a number of audio tapes explaining his motivation for the attack. He mailed these to his brother in South Dakota shortly before stepping into his bulldozer. Heemeyer's brother turned the tapes over to the FBI, who in turn sent them to the Grand County Sheriff's Department. The tapes were released by the Grand County Sheriff's Office on August 31, 2004. The tapes are about 2.5 hours in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.9news.com/news/article.aspx?storyid=49366 |title=Newly released audiotapes detail reasons for Granby bulldozer rampage |first=Paula |last=Woodward |publisher=[[KUSA-TV]]|accessdate=June 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recording was made on April 13, 2004. The last recording was made 13 days before the rampage.

"God built me for this job," Heemeyer said in the first recording. He also said it was God's plan that he not be married or have a family so that he could be in a position to carry out such an attack. "I think God will bless me to get the machine done, to drive it, to do the stuff that I have to do," he said. "God blessed me in advance for the task that I am about to undertake. It is my duty. God has asked me to do this. It's a cross that I am going to carry and I'm carrying it in God's name."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/3697785/detail.html |title=Man Who Bulldozed Granby Says He Got Idea From God |publisher=[[KMGH-TV]] |accessdate=April 8, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413145608/http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/3697785/detail.html |archivedate=April 13, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigators later found Heemeyer's handwritten list of targets. According to the police, it included the buildings he destroyed, the local Catholic church (which he didn't damage), and the names of various people who had sided against him in past disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/3394824/detail.html |title=7NEWS Looks Inside Granby Work Shed Where 'Dozer Was Outfitted |publisher=[[KMGH-TV]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222044045/http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/3394824/detail.html |archivedate=2008-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Nana Akufo-Addo|Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo]]''' took office as [[Ghana]]'s president on January 7, 2017 after winning the December [[Ghanaian general election, 2016|2016 presidential elections]]. A number of controversies have arisen under his administration.

== Plagiarism of inauguration speech ==
[[Nana Akufo-Addo]] was accused of lifting parts of his inauguration speech from previous addresses given by former [[United States|US]] presidents [[Bill Clinton]] and [[George W. Bush|George W Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/ghana-nana-akufo-addo-caught-plagiarism-row-170108165213500.html|title=Ghana: Nana Akufo-Addo caught up in plagiarism row|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-38555356|title=Ghana's Nana Akufo-Addo and other leaders caught up in plagiarism scandals|date=2017-01-09|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ghana-politics-idUSKBN14S0VD|title=Ghana president faces outcry over plagiarism in inaugural speech|date=2017-01-08|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a public uproar with some deeming it as an embarrassment to the country and calling for the sacking of the speechwriter or for someone to take responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.atinkaonline.com/1.10611907|title=Akufo-Addo’s plagiarized speech depressing, shocking -Minority|last=Yeboah|first=Isaac|newspaper=atinkaonline.com|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pulse.com.gh/politics/npp-govt-speechwriters-of-nana-addo-must-be-sacked-for-plagiarism-gaffe-group-id6016062.html|title=NPP Gov't: Speechwriters of Nana Addo must be sacked for plagiarism gaffe – Group - Politics - Pulse|last=Tornyi|first=Emmanuel|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Director of Communication at the Presidency subsequently issued an apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsghana.com.gh/eugene-arhin-apologizes-for-failing-to-credit-parts-of-nana-addos-speech/|title=Eugene Arhin Apologizes for Failing to Credit Parts of Nana Addo’s Speech|last=Ghana|first=News|date=2017-01-07|newspaper=News Ghana|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some public figures also called for Ghanaians to disregard the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/A-Plus-jabs-Ghanaians-over-Akufo-Addo-s-plagiarized-speech-499313|title=A Plus jabs Ghanaians over Akufo-Addo’s "plagiarized speech"|website=www.ghanaweb.com|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akufo-Addo has since referred to the incident in jest at a thanksgiving service he attended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://starrfmonline.com/2017/01/15/akufo-addo-laughs-off-plagiarism-gaffe/|title=Akufo-Addo laughs off plagiarism gaffe|date=2017-01-15|website=Starr Fm|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Official Residence And Office for former president John Dramani Mahama==
Immediately after Nana Akufo-Addo was sworn in, a letter dated 19 December 2016 signed by [[Julius Debrah]], former chief of staff, became public.

==Boycott of voting process for minister designate Otiko Afisa Djaba==

'''Nanotechnology education''' involves a multidisciplinary [[natural science]] education with courses such as [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[mathematics]] and [[molecular biology]].&lt;ref&gt;Aldrin E. Sweeney (2008) Developing a viable knowledge base in nanoscale science and engineering, ''Nanoscale Science and Engineering Education'' (eds. A. E. Sweeney and S. Seal, American Scientific, Stevenson Ranch CA) pp. 1-35, {{ISBN|978-1588830852}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is being offered by many [[University|universities]] around the world. The first program involving [[nanotechnology]] was offered by the [[University of Toronto]]'s Engineering Science program, where nanotechnology could be taken as an option.

Here is a partial list of universities offering nanotechnology education, and the degrees offered ([[Bachelor of Science]], [[Master of Science]], and/or [[Ph.D]] in Nanotechnology).

==Nanotechnology in Schools==
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in introducing nanoscience and nanotechnology in grade schools, especially at the [[high school]] level. 
In the [[United States]], although very few high schools officially offer a two-semester course in nanotechnology, “nano” concepts are bootstrapped and taught during traditional science classes using a number of educational resources and hands-on activities developed by dedicated non-profit organizations, such as:

* The [[National Science Teachers Association|National Science Teacher Association]], which has published a number of textbooks for nanotechnology in K-12 education, including a teacher’s guide and an activity manual for hands-on experiences. 
* [http://www.nano-link.org Nano-Link], a notable program of the [[Dakota County Technical College]], which has developed a variety of nanotech-related hands-on activities supported by toolkits to teach concepts in nanotechnology throughout direct lab experience.
* [http://www.omninano.org Omni Nano], which is developing comprehensive educational resources specifically designed to support a two-semester high school course, both online and in classrooms. Omni Nano also discusses issues in nanotechnology education on its dedicated blog.
* [http://www.nano4me.org/ Nano4Me], which has a good amount of resources for K-12 education, although their program is intended for higher education. Their K-12 resources include introductory level modules and activities, interactive multimedia, and a collection of experiments and hands-on activities. 
* [[Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network|Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network (NISE)]], which has a website of educational products designed to engage the public in nano science, engineering, and technology. NISE also organizes Nano Days, a nationwide festival of educational programs about nanoscale science and engineering and its potential impact on the future.

In Egypt, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090107041954/http://www.in2nano.sabrycorp.com/ in2nano] is a high school outreach program aiming to increase [[scientific literacy]] and prepare students for the sweeping changes of nanotechnology.

==Nanotechnology education outside of school==
* [[Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network|Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network (NISE)]] has a website of educational products designed to engage the public in nano science, engineering, and technology available at [http://www.nisenet.org www.nisenet.org] and a site for the public at [http://www.whatisnano.org www.whatisnano.org]. The NISE Network also organizes [[Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network#NanoDays|Nano Days]], a nationwide festival of educational programs about nanoscale science and engineering and its potential impact on the future.

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
The novel is set in a world dominated by an international [[theocracy]], the Magisterium (also commonly called "the Church"), which actively suppresses [[heresy]]. In this world, humans' souls naturally exist outside of their bodies in the form of [[sentience|sentient]] "[[dæmon (His Dark Materials)|dæmon]]s", [[Talking animals in fiction|talking animal]] spirits that constantly accompany, aid, and comfort their humans. Children's dæmons can freely and instantaneously [[shapeshifting|change their appearance]] into that of any real or mythical creature; once people reach puberty, however, their dæmons settle into one permanent form.

===Plot===
Twelve-year-old [[Lyra Belacqua]] runs wild with her dæmon Pantalaimon around [[Jordan College, Oxford]], under the guardianship of the college's [[Master (college)|Master]]. One day, she witnesses the Master poison wine intended for [[Lord Asriel]], Lyra's rebellious and adventuring uncle. She warns Asriel not to drink the wine, then spies on his lecture about [[Dust (His Dark Materials)|"Dust"]], mysterious [[elementary particle]]s attracted to adults more than children. Asriel shows the college scholars images of a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] seen through the [[aurora borealis|Northern Lights]] amidst a concentration of Dust. The scholars agree to fund his controversial research, which is considered heretical by the oppressive Church.

Lyra's friend Roger goes missing, presumed kidnapped by mysterious child abductors called "Gobblers". [[Marisa Coulter|Mrs Coulter]], a charming socialite, adopts Lyra. Before Lyra leaves Jordan, the Master secretly entrusts her with an [[His Dark Materials#Terminology|alethiometer]], a strange truth-telling device, which she quickly learns to use intuitively. After several weeks, Lyra discovers that Coulter is the head of the Gobblers, or "General Oblation Board", a secret Church-funded project. Horrified, Lyra flees to the [[Gyptians]], canal-faring [[nomadic|nomads]], many of whose children have also been abducted. They reveal to Lyra that Asriel and Coulter are her parents.

The Gyptians form an expedition to the Arctic with Lyra, where they believe the Gobblers are holding their children. They stop in [[Locations in His Dark Materials#Trollesund|Trollesund]], where Lyra meets [[Characters of His Dark Materials#Iorek Byrnison|Iorek Byrnison]], the dispossessed royal heir of the ''[[panserbjørne]]'' (armoured bears). Lyra uses her alethiometer to locate Iorek's missing armour; in return, he and his human [[aeronaut]] friend, [[Characters of His Dark Materials#Lee Scoresby|Lee Scoresby]], join her group. She also learns that Lord Asriel has been exiled, guarded by the ''panserbjørne'' on [[Svalbard]]. Trollesund's witch [[Consul (representative)|consul]] tells the Gyptians of a prophecy about Lyra which she must not know, and that the witch clans are choosing sides for an upcoming war.

The search party continues towards Bolvangar, the Gobbler research station. Guided by the alethiometer, Lyra detours at a village and discovers an abandoned child who has been cut from his dæmon and who soon dies. She realises the Gobblers are experimenting on children by severing the bond between human and dæmon, a soul-splitting process called [[intercision]]. Lyra and her companions are attacked by [[bounty hunter]]s, and Lyra is captured and taken to Bolvangar, where she is briefly reunited with Roger before being sent to be separated from Pantalaimon. Just before this can occur, Coulter arrives and halts the intercision process. She tells Lyra that intercision prevents the onset of troubling adult emotions, though it has not yet been perfected.

Lyra activates Bolvangar's emergency alarm, sets the station on fire, and evacuates the children, where they are rescued by Scoresby, Iorek, the Gyptians, and the witch clan of [[Characters of His Dark Materials#Serafina Pekkala|Serafina Pekkala]], who battle the station attendants as Lyra, Roger, and Iorek flee in Scoresby's hot air balloon. Lyra directs the witches to tow the balloon towards Asriel in Svalbard, but she falls out and is taken by the ''panserbjørne'' to the castle of their usurping king, [[Characters of His Dark Materials#Iofur Raknison|Iofur Raknison]]. She tricks Iofur into fighting Iorek, who arrives with the others to rescue Lyra. Iorek kills Iofur and regains his place as the rightful king.

Lyra, Iorek, and Roger continue onwards to Svalbard, where Asriel has continued his Dust research in exile. He tells Lyra all he knows of Dust: that it has spawned parallel universes, it is somehow connected to death and misery, and that the Church believes it is the physical basis of [[Original sin|sin]]. He plans to visit the other universes and destroy the source of Dust. Suddenly, he severs Roger from his dæmon, killing Roger but releasing an enormous amount of energy that tears a hole in the Northern Lights to a parallel universe, through which he walks. Because Asriel believes Dust is a force of evil, the devastated Lyra decides that perhaps it is really a force of good. Vowing to stop her father, she and Pantalaimon pass through the opening in the sky.

==Characters==
&lt;!-- Please remember that character information duplicates 1. on main HDM page      2. On HDM character list page       3. On individual character page and       4. This page. Entries in this list should be VERY BRIEF, with fuller exposition elsewhere.! --&gt;
{{main|Characters of His Dark Materials}}

All humans in ''Northern Lights'', as well as witches, have a dæmon ''(pronounced "demon")'', which is the physical manifestation of a person's "inner being", soul, or spirit. It takes the form of a creature ''(moth, bird, dog, monkey, snake, etc.)'' and is usually the opposite sex to its human counterpart. The dæmons of children have the ability to change form - from one creature to another - but towards the end of a child's puberty, their dæmon "settles" into a permanent form, which reflects the person's personality. When a person dies, the dæmon dies too. Armoured bears, cliff ghasts and other creatures do not have dæmons. An armoured bear's armour is his soul.

*'''[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Lyra Belacqua/Silvertongue|Lyra Belacqua]]''' and '''[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Lyra Belacqua/Silvertongue|Pantalaimon]]''': The principal characters. Lyra is described as having blue eyes and blond hair, along with being short for her age and quite thin but is still quite attractive. She is also brave, curious, and crafty. Her dæmon is Pantalaimon, nicknamed Pan. Because Lyra is still a child, Pan is still capable of changing into any shape he wishes ''(often a brown moth, a wildcat, a white ermine, or a mouse)''. Lyra has been prophesied by the witches to help the balance of life, but must do so without being aware of her destiny.
*'''[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Roger Parslow|Roger Parslow]]''': One of Lyra's friends, a boy whose family works at Jordan College. When he is kidnapped and taken north, Lyra pursues him in hopes of rescuing him, meeting up with him again at Bolvangar.
*'''[[List of His Dark Materials characters#Lord Asriel|Lord Asriel]]''': Ostensibly Lyra's uncle, though it is later revealed that he is actually her father. His dæmon is Stelmaria, a Moroccan snow leopard.
*'''[[Marisa Coulter]]''': An agent of the Magisterium, who does not hesitate to manipulate the Church to obtain funds for her projects. She is intelligent and beautiful, but also ruthless and callous. She is revealed to be Lyra's mother; as a result, she is unexpectedly kind to Lyra. Her dæmon is a golden monkey who, unusually, is not named throughout the trilogy.
*'''[[Iorek Byrnison]]''': Rightful king of the [[panserbjørne]], armoured bears with [[sentience#Science fiction|human-level intelligence]], Iorek has been tricked out of his armour and reduced to a [[slavery|slave]] of the human village Trollesund. After Lyra helps him recover his armour, he becomes very protective of her and joins the expedition to find the children seized by Gobblers. He gives her the name "Lyra Silvertongue" after she tricks the [[usurper]] Iofur Raknison into fighting him.
*'''[[Iofur Raknison]]''': A panserbjørn who has usurped Iorek Byrnison's authority as king. Iofur wants a dæmon and Lyra tricks him into fighting the exiled Iorek by pretending to be Iorek's dæmon, and promising that when Iofur wins the fight she will become his.
*'''[[Serafina Pekkala]]''': A witch who closely follows Lyra on her travels. She is aware of Lyra's destiny. Serafina's dæmon is Kaisa, a snow goose, who is capable of physically moving separately from Serafina over long distances, a quality that only witches' dæmons possess innately. She and Farder Coram had a son together, prior to the trilogy.
*'''[[Lee Scoresby]]''': A Texan aeronaut who transports Lyra in his balloon. He and Iorek Byrnison are good friends and Lee comes to see Lyra as a surrogate daughter. His dæmon is Hester, an arctic snow hare.
*'''Ma Costa''': A Gyptian woman whose son, Billy Costa is abducted by the "Gobblers". She rescues Lyra from Mrs Coulter and takes her to John Faa. We later discover that Ma Costa nursed Lyra, when she was a baby.
*'''[[List of His Dark Materials characters#John Faa|John Faa]]''': The King of all Gyptian people. He journeyed with Lyra to the North with his companion [[Farder Coram]].

During [[pre-publication]] of the novel, the prospective trilogy was known in Britain as ''The Golden Compasses'', an allusion to God's poetic delineation of the world. The term is from a line in [[John Milton|Milton's]] ''[[Paradise Lost]]'',&lt;ref name="btts"&gt;Frequently Asked Questions, 1: {{cite web |url= http://www.bridgetothestars.net/index.php?p=FAQ#1 |title=Why is the trilogy called His Dark Materials? Why are there two different titles for the first book? |accessdate=2007-08-20 |publisher= BridgeToTheStars.net: ''His Dark Materials'', Philip Pullman, and other ideas&amp;nbsp;... (fan site)}} Article 1 is a direct quotation of Pullman (no date).&lt;/ref&gt; where it denotes the [[compass (drafting)|drafting compass]] God used to establish and set a circular boundary of all creation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Then staid the fervid wheels, and in his hand
'''He took the golden compasses, prepared'''
'''In God's eternal store, to circumscribe'''
'''This universe, and all created things''':
One foot he centred, and the other turned
Round through the vast profundity obscure
&lt;/poem&gt;
— Book 7, lines 224–229&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the US, publisher Knopf had been calling the first book ''The Golden Compass'' (singular), which it mistakenly understood as a reference to Lyra's [[aletheia|alethiometer]] (depicted on the front cover shown at the head of this article), because of the device's resemblance to a [[compass|navigational compass]]. By the time Pullman had replaced ''The Golden Compasses'' with ''His Dark Materials'' as the name of the trilogy, the US publisher had become so attached to the original title that it insisted on publishing the first book as ''The Golden Compass'' rather than as ''Northern Lights'', the title used in Britain and Australia.&lt;ref name="btts" /&gt;

==Critical reception==

===Awards===
For ''Northern Lights'' Pullman won both the annual [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] for British children's books&lt;ref name="medal1995" /&gt; and the annual [[Guardian Children's Fiction Prize]], a similar award that authors may not win twice.&lt;ref name="relaunch" /&gt; Six books have won both awards in 45 years through 2011.{{efn|name = GCFP}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8957">The '''Ohio Women's Convention at Salem in 1850''' met on April 19–20, 1850 in [[Salem, Ohio]], a center for reform activity. It was the third in a series of women's rights conventions that began with the [[Seneca Falls Convention]] of 1848.  It was the first of these conventions to be organized on a statewide basis. About five hundred people attended. All of the convention's officers were women. Men were not allowed to vote, sit on the platform or speak during the convention. The convention sent a memorial to the convention that was preparing a new Ohio state constitution, asking it to provide for women's right to vote.

==History==

The Ohio Women's Convention at Salem met on April 19–20, 1850 in [[Salem, Ohio]].  About five hundred people attended.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Ann D., ed. (1997).  ''The Selected Papers of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony: In the School of Anti-Slavery, 1840 to 1866'', Vol. 1 of 6, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dBs4CO1DsF4C&amp;pg=PA168 p. 168].  New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press.  {{ISBN|0-8135-2317-6}}.  This citation references historical background material written by Ann Gordon.&lt;/ref&gt;
It met at the Second Baptist Church and the Friends (Quaker) Meeting House. It was the third in a series of women's rights conventions that began with the [[Seneca Falls Convention]] of 1848 and continued with the [[Rochester Women's Rights Convention of 1848|Rochester Convention]] two weeks later. Both of these were regional gatherings in [[western New York]] State. The Salem convention was the first women's rights convention to be organized on a statewide basis.&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, Judith (2008). [https://www.nps.gov/wori/learn/historyculture/upload/_7-HRS-SectionI-10-18-08-printed-1EBA.pdf "The Seneca Falls Women's Rights Convention and the Origin of the Women's Rights Movement"], pp. 15, 84. National Park Service, Women's Rights National Historical Park. Wellman is identified as the author of this document [https://www.nps.gov/wori/learn/historyculture/research.htm here].&lt;/ref&gt;
The first to be organized on a national basis was the [[National Women's Rights Convention#1850 in Worcester|National Women's Rights Convention in Worcester, Massachusetts]] in October, 1850.

Salem was a center for reform activity.  Its inhabitants included a number of anti-slavery activists, many of them [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Buckeye Women: The History of Ohio's Daughters |last=Booth|first=Stephane Elise |year=2001 |publisher=Ohio University Press| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=u1sqAAAAYAAJ|isbn=978-0821413913 |page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[The Anti-Slavery Bugle]], an abolitionist newspaper, was published in Salem beginning in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83035487/ "Anti-Slavery Bugle"], ''Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers." Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt;
A local group of the Progressive Friends, an association of Quakers who separated from the main body partly so they could be freer to work for such causes as [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]] and [[women's rights]], was formed in Salem in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Allen C., (November, 1920).

[https://books.google.com/books?id=GEBHAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA28 p. 28].&lt;/ref&gt;
The local school board was composed of abolitionists from both wings of that movement: the followers of [[William Lloyd Garrison]], who opposed involvement in political activity, and supporters of the [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty Party]], an abolitionist political party. All eight members of the school board had female relatives who participated in the Salem convention.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg (1998), [https://books.google.com/books?id=l3wSH1AcTn8C&amp;pg=PA216 p. 216].&lt;/ref&gt;

The call to the Salem convention declared that its purpose would be, "[T]o secure to all persons the recognition of equal rights, and the extension of the privileges of government without distinction of sex, or color".&lt;ref name=hws-v1-p103&gt;Stanton, Anthony, Gage (1881), [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu01stanuoft#page/102/mode/2up p. 103].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Betsy Mix Cowles]] was elected president of the convention.  Cowles, who had ties to both wings of the abolitionist movement, was a long-time advocate for the rights of African Americans.
She led the campaign against laws that discriminated against black children in public schools in Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg (1998), [https://books.google.com/books?id=l3wSH1AcTn8C&amp;pg=PA19 pp. 19–20].&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1835 she became the leader of the Female Anti-Slavery Society of [[Ashtabula County, Ohio|Ashtabula County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oberlin.edu/archive/resources/women/group30.html#48 |title=[48] Papers of Betsy Mix Cowles, 1835-1868, 2 in.|work=Papers of Other Individuals|publisher=Oberlin College Archives |accessdate=September 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Jane Elizabeth Jones]], an abolitionist lecturer, gave the convention's main address.&lt;ref name=proceedings/&gt;
[[Josephine Sophia White Griffing|Josephine Griffing]], another prominent activist against slavery and for women's rights, served on the business committee.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Anthony, Gage (1881), [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu01stanuoft#page/104/mode/2up p. 104].&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the convention's officers were women. Men were not allowed to vote, sit on the platform or speak during the convention. The male spectators were supportive, however, and when the convention was over, they created an organization of their own and endorsed the actions of the women's convention.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Anthony, Gage (1881), [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu01stanuoft#page/110/mode/2up p. 110].&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention met less than a month prior to the opening of the state convention that revised the Ohio state constitution in 1850–1851.  The Salem convention approved a memorial that was forwarded to the constitutional convention along with 8000 signatures.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg (1998), [https://books.google.com/books?id=l3wSH1AcTn8C&amp;pg=PA15 pp. 15–17].&lt;/ref&gt;
The memorial concluded by saying: 
&lt;blockquote&gt; The law should sustain and protect all who come under its sway, and not create a state of dependence and depression in any human being.  The laws should not make woman a mere pensioner on the bounty of her husband, thus enslaving her will and degrading her to a condition of absolute dependence.  Believing that woman does not suffer alone when subject to oppressive and unequal laws, but that whatever affects injuriously her interests, is subversive of the highest good of the race, we earnestly request that in the New Constitution you are about to form for the state of Ohio, women should be secured, not only the right of suffrage, but all the political and legal rights that are guaranteed to men."&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Anthony, Gage (1881), [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu01stanuoft#page/104/mode/2up p. 105].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Letters were read to the convention from prominent women's rights leaders who were unable to attend, including [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[Lucretia Mott]], and [[Lucy Stone]].&lt;ref name=proceedings&gt;''Proceedings of the Ohio Women's Convention, held at Salem, April 19–20, 1850; with an Address by J.

The presence of '''Paraguayans in Italy''' dates back to the 1980s.

==Numbers==
In 2010 in [[Italy]] there are 1.502 regular immigrants from [[Paraguay]]. In 2006 they were 837. The three cities with most number of Paraguayans are: [[Rome]], [[Verona]] and [[Finale Ligure]].&lt;ref name="int"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.comuni-italiani.it/statistiche/stranieri/py.html|title= Comuni Italiani|date=11 January 2012|work=Comuni|accessdate=9 February 2012|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Italians have contributed significantly to the development of Paraguay. At the time of the war waged 130 years ago from the Triple Alliance formed by Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay against Paraguay, many Italians emigrated to Paraguay recently volunteered in the ranks of Marshal [[Francisco Solano López]], the president of the South American country.

Approximately 9,000 were Europeans as migrants in Paraguay, devastated by the [[Paraguayan War]], in the late 19th century and over a third were Italians, mainly from the provinces of [[Lombardy]] (especially from [[Bergamo]]) and northern Italy. Since the 1980s, the phenomenon of immigration has brought home many grandchildren of Italian immigrants.

Although traditionally the preserve of [[government]]s and [[municipal]] authorities, infrastructure has recently become an [[asset class]] in its own right for private sector investors- most notably [[pension fund]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=PEI |title= Infrastructure Investor : About Us|url= http://www.infrastructureinvestor.com/Pages.aspx?pageID=1759 | work= PEI Infrastructure Investor |date= Mar 2011 |accessdate=Jan 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Iain Jones |title= Infrastructure: An Asset Class in its Own Right|url= http://www. preqin.com/blog/101/4403/infrastructure-asset-class | work= Preqin Alternative Assets|date= Nov 2, 2011 |accessdate=Jan 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, [[pension fund]]s have tended to invest mostly in "core-assets" such as [[money market]] instruments, [[government bond]]s, and large-cap [[Equity (finance)|equity]], and, to a lesser extent, in "alternative assets" such as [[real estate]], [[private equity]] and [[hedge fund]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=George Inderst |title= Pension Fund Investment in Infrastructure|url= http://www.oecd.org/insurance/privatepensions/42052208.pdf| work=OECD Working Paper on Insurance and Private Pensions, volume 32|date= Jan 2009  |accessdate=Nov 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the average allocation to infrastructure representing only 1% of total assets under management by pensions- excluding indirect investment through ownership of stocks of listed utility and infrastructure companies.

==Canadian, Californian and Australian early entrants==
Pension funds- including [[superannuation]] schemes account for approximately 40% of all investors in the infrastructure asset class, excluding projects directly funded and developed by governments, municipalities and public authorities. Large [[Canada|Canadian]] pension funds and sovereign investors have been particularly active in the field of energy assets such as natural gas and natural gas infrastructure, where they have become major players in recent years &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=M.

Until recently, apart from sophisticated jurisdictions such as [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], [[California]] and the [[Netherlands]], most North American, European, and UK  pensions wishing to gain a degree of exposure to infrastructure assets had done so indirectly, through investments made in infrastructure funds managed by specialized Canadian, US and Australian funds &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Mark Cobley |title= Infrastructure Funds Fail to Bridge the Gap|url= http://www.worldpensions.org/uploads/-Infrastructure_Funds...___Dow_Jones_Financial_News__Feb_20_2012.pdf| work=Dow Jones Financial News|date= 20 February 2012  |accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Sinead Cruise and Myles Neligan  |title= British Infrastructure Finance Plan No Silver Bullet|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/28/britain-economy-pensionfunds-idUSL5E7MP21Z20111128| work=Reuters |date= November 28, 2011  |accessdate=28 November 2011| location=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UK Pensions Infrastructure Platform==
On November 29, 2011, the British government unveiled an unprecedented plan to encourage large-scale pension investments in roads, hospitals, airports, etc. across the UK. The plan is aimed at enticing 20 billion pounds ($30.97 billion) of investment in domestic infrastructure projects “over the next decade”. On October 18, 2012, [[HM Treasury]] announced that the [[National Association of Pension Funds]] (NAPF) and the [[Pension Protection Fund]] (PPF) had succeeded in “''securing a critical mass of Founding Investors needed to move to the next stage of development'' [...] [and that] ''several major UK pension funds have signed up to the Pension Infrastructure Platform (PIP). The intention is that the Founding Investors will provide around half of the target £2 billion of investment capital for the fund, before it launches early next year''” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=HM Treasury Newsroom and Speeches |title= Government welcomes first injection into Pensions Infrastructure Platform

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10355">[[File:المعالم الاثرية من بيت السيحيمي 5.jpg|thumb|right|This qa'a in [[Bayt Al-Suhaymi]] Cairo is equipped with a cooling fountain and a lantern.]]
The '''Qa'a''' is a roofed reception room found in the domestic architecture of affluent residences of the Islamic world. It is the most common hall type in the medieval Islamic domestic architecture. The plan of a qa'a may be inspired by the four-[[iwan]], cruciform-shaped plan of religious buildings. They were used to welcome male guests, where they would sit on the raised platform.

==Composition== 
Qa'as are found in domestic houses of wealthy people, e.g. merchants or local political figures. They can be situated on the ground floors or on the first floors. Entrance to the qa'a is usually situated facing the semi-private courtyard of the house. 

The qa'a can be described as a combination of a courtyard and [[iwan]]. The qa'a consists of a depressed central area (''durqa'a'') where guests would first enter the qa'a via an opening; and the raised sitting area (''tazar'') where the guests would take off their footwear and be seated on the ''diwan'', a couch that is placed on the floor against the wall. The ''tazar'' is placed in a kind of [[iwan]], a rectangular hall walled on three sides. Normally there are two iwans facing each other on the main axis of the qa'a, with wall recesses on the two remaining sides.{{sfn|Ragette|2003|p=9}}

The ''durqa'a'' (literally "entry to the qa'a") is the first area where the guests would enter into a qa'a via a main entrance. It is the central space of the qa'a. In a qa'a composition, the ''durqa'a'' is flanked with two ''tazar''s (raised sitting area) on the two sides of the durqa'a, or sometimes just one. The durqa'a is where a cooling fountain (''fasqiya'') may be installed, a typical feature in Islamic architecture which provides sound into the space.{{sfn|Ragette|2003|p=145}} 

The ''tazar'' is the raised sitting platform. They are located in the [[iwan]]. In the complete composition of the qa'a, there are two ''iwan''s flanking the ''durqa'a'' at the sides. The ''tazar'' is where the male guests would be seated, and then served food or coffee by the servants. In a few example, there is additional access that leads directly toward the tazar, usually this is a service access where the servants would enter to provide fruits or drinks. Recessed shelves are located on the wall on the sides of the ''tazar'', this is where ceramic bowls, ewers, carved metal works, or books were displayed.{{sfn|Ragette|2003|p=145}} The walls may also be decorated with Arabic calligraphy, usually of poetry, a dominant form of art in the Islamic world. [[Mashrabiya]]s are sometimes used to cover recesses on the side walls of the two iwans. Sometimes there's also a decorative niche (''masab''), which is treated like a kind of niche found in mosques, with miniature [[muqarnas]] decorating the miniature ceiling of the niche.{{sfn|Harris|Zucker|2013}}{{sfn|Ragette|2003|p=145}}

The ceiling of the iwan is always lower than the ceiling of the durqa'a. In the earliest qa'as, the iwans are usually [[Barrel vault|barrel-vaulted]] (e.g. the qa'a of al-Dardir House in Cairo).&lt;ref name="syl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/4.611/www/L7.html |title=AGA KHAN PROGRAM FOR ISLAMIC ARCHITECTURE - 7-Palaces, Houses, and Halls types between the 9th and 12th Century |series=Aga Khan  |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017 |website=AGA KHAN PROGRAM FOR ISLAMIC ARCHITECTURE |publisher=Department of Architecture, Massachusetts Institute of Technology |access-date=November 12, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Mamluk qa'a, one of the iwan would have a [[windcatcher]] (''malqaf'' or ''badhahanj'') which brings in the breeze into the qa'a.{{sfn|Ragette|2003|p=145}} The ceiling of the durqa'a is normally the tallest in the qa'a, often topped with a wooden hexagonal skylight (''shukhsheikha'') which provides light into the interior or equipped with a lantern.&lt;ref name="syl"/&gt;

==Interior design==
[[File:Damascus Room MET DP240367.jpg|thumb|left|The tazar (sitting platform) of the Damascus Room, a qa'a from a medieval house in Damascus. This qa'a, designed in ajami-style, is now kept in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City|New York]].]] 
The qa'a is heavily decorated with vibrant colors and complex pattern. The design of the room is where the owner of the house can show off to the guests. They can be designed in different styles, depending on where the qa'a is located.{{sfn|Harris|Zucker|2013}}

The wall of the qa'a is normally wooden panels of cypress, poplar, or mulberry. A qa'a in Ajami style would have the wooden walls layered with a gypsum mixture to create a raised patterned surface, decorated with metal leaf (e.g. tin, silver, or gold) and then painted and layered. The entire wall would then be varnished. Today the color of old qa'a walls would be low in saturation, but they were used to be extremely vibrant in color. Many newer domestic houses, e.g. those in Damascus, still have vibrant colors of green, blue, fuchsias and purples.{{sfn|Harris|Zucker|2013}} 

The floor is of cut inlaid stones.{{sfn|Harris|Zucker|2013}}  

==Usage==
The qa'a is one of many reception rooms featured in the domestic architecture found in Egyptian Ottoman and other Islamic worlds e.g. Syria. A qa'a is featured in affluent houses of a merchant or a local political figure. The place is where the owner of the house would have a meeting or greet his guests. The qa'a doesn't have any fixed furniture and that it was seasonal. The qa'a is ideally located to the north side of the courtyard of a house, so that it could have taken advantage of the sun's rays during winter when the sun would is at the lowest. If the qa'a is used for the summer, they would have the [[windcatcher]] to direct breeze into the room during summer time. The qa'a can also be used as a sleeping room. In that case, there will be a larger niche where bedding rolls and carpets would be placed to be used for sleeping.{{sfn|Harris|Zucker|2013}}

''ataba'' is a term to indicate a low zone, a term which is applied to the depressed ''durqa'a''. If the guests of the house owner are not important, they are kept in the ''ataba''. They are only allowed to enter into the ''tazar'' if they are guests of honor, where they would sit on the couches after taking off their footwears.{{sfn|Harris|Zucker|2013}}

The ''tazar'' is a place where important guests would be seated. Here, they would be served fruits depending on the season, or drinks (e.g. coffee) or a hookah. Depending on how important the guests are, they would be seated toward the central part of the rear wall, where they could admire the glory of the qa'a.{{sfn|Harris|Zucker|2013}}

==Examples of qa'a==
[[File:Beit Ghazaleh Alep Dec 2017.jpg|thumb|right|Damaged qa'a of the 17th-century [[Beit Ghazaleh]] in Aleppo. The fine woodwork of the room has been stripped off by looters.]]
The qa'a room is found throughout the Islamic world, especially in Ottoman Egypt and Ottoman Syria. Below are lists of buildings with notable qa'a:
*'''Egypt'''
**[[Bayt Al-Suhaymi]] in [[Cairo]] contains many qa'as facing its inner courtyard.
**The Grand Hall in the Convent of Saint George, just next to the [[Church of St. George (Cairo)]], contains a qa'a which was converted from an early 14th-century merchant's house. A 66-paneled double-door were installed in one of the arms of the qa'a, which leads to the chapel of the convent.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=39}}
**The qa'a of Muhibb al-Din al-Muwaqqi' is one of the best examples of domestic architecture from the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] period. It is a {{convert|16|m|ft}} high room topped with an octagonal dome and equipped with an octagonal fountain. The room is decorated with calligraphic letters on its wooden panels and geometric stone tiles.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=168-9}}

**The Damascus Room is an early 18th-century winter qa'a from a [[Damascus]] house. The interior of the qa'a is currently preserved in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]]. The qa'a features stained-glass windows, a marble octagonal fountain in its durqa'a, and wooden panels decorated with Arabic inscriptions from a poem.{{sfn|Metropolitan Museum of Art|2012|p=142}} 
**[[Beit Ghazaleh|Bayt Ghazaleh]] in [[Aleppo]] contains a qa'a with three [[iwan]]s with an octagonal basin in the center. The qa'a is decorated with painted wooden panels and stone tiles with geometric patterns.{{sfn|Duda|1971|pp=35,90-1,108}} Unfortunately, the 17th-century house, including its qa'a, has been looted and damaged by explosions by the armed conflict in Aleppo.

'''Richard Fran Biegenwald''' (August 24, 1940 &amp;ndash; March 10, 2008) was an [[United States|American]] [[serial killer]] who committed his crimes in [[Monmouth County, New Jersey]]. Between 1958 and 1983, Biegenwald killed at least six people, and he is suspected in at least two other [[murder]]s.

==Early life==

Born in [[Staten Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], Biegenwald was frequently beaten as a child by his [[alcoholic]] father.&lt;ref name="Newton"&gt;{{cite web | last = Newton | first = Michael | authorlink = | title = Hunting Humans: An Encyclopedia of Modern Serial Killers | work = Murderpedia | publisher = Breakout Productions | date = 1990 | isbn = 978-1559500265 | url = http://www.murderpedia.org/male.B/b/biegenwald.htm | accessdate = 29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of five, Biegenwald set fire to their home&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bovsun2010"&gt;{{cite web | last = Bovsun | first = Mara | authorlink = | title = Jersey Shore 'Thrill Killer' Richard Biegenwald accused of killing five in early '80s | work = Murderpedia | publisher = New York Daily News | date = 31 October 2010 | url = http://www.murderpedia.org/male.B/b/biegenwald.htm | accessdate = 29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was sent for observation at a Rockland County Psychiatric Center.&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt;

By the age of eight, Biegenwald was drinking and gambling; at age nine he underwent [[electroshock therapy]] at [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Bellevue Hospital Center|Bellevue Hospital]].&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt; After his therapy, Biegenwald was placed in the State Training School for Boys in [[Warwick, New York]]. During his years there, Biegenwald was accused of theft and inciting other inmates to escape.&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt; During trips to visit his mother in Staten Island, he would steal money from her.&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt; When he was 11 years old, he set himself on fire in his mother's home.&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt; When Biegenwald was 16 years old, he graduated from the eighth grade and was released from the Training School to attend high school.&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt; Biegenwald dropped out of high school after only a few weeks.&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt;

Soon after dropping out of school, Biegenwald went to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where he stayed for two years. Biegenwald stole a car in Nashville, and was arrested in [[Kentucky]] by federal agents for transporting a stolen car across state lines.&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt; He returned to Staten Island in 1958.&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt;

==The first murder==

After his return, Biegenwald stole another car and went to [[Bayonne, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt; There, on December 18, 1958, Biegenwald robbed a grocery store with accomplice Frank Spardoff (possibly "Sparnroft"), shooting and killing the proprietor, Stephen Sladowski, an attorney and prosecutor.&lt;ref name="Bovsun2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AP080310"&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituaries in the news |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |author=The Associated Press |author-link=The Associated Press |date=10 March 2008 |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-03-10-3365001399_x.htm |access-date=29 March 2013 |publisher=[[Gannett Co. Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biegenwald fled the state after the murder, but was captured two days later in [[Salisbury, Maryland]], after a shooting involving police.&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt; Biegenwald was [[extradition|extradited]] to [[New Jersey]], where he was convicted of murder and given a [[life sentence]].&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt; Biegenwald was released in 1975 for good behavior after 17 years imprisonment.&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AP080310" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bovsun2010" /&gt;

==Back on the outside==

Biegenwald worked odd jobs for the next three years&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt; and kept a low profile. In 1977, Biegenwald was suspected in a [[rape]], and was wanted for failing to report to his [[parole]] officer.&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt; Biegenwald was arrested in [[Brooklyn]] in 1980&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt; on the rape charge, but was released after the victim failed to pick him out of a [[police lineup|lineup]].&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt; Biegenwald got married, and he and his wife moved to [[Asbury Park, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt; There, Biegenwald was befriended by Dherran Fitzgerald,&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt; who would play a role in several of his future murders.

Biegenwald struck again when he shot and killed 18-year-old Anna Olesiewicz&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bovsun2010" /&gt; in [[Ocean Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey|Ocean Township, New Jersey]]. Her body was found in January 1983 by children playing in a wooded lot behind a [[Burger King]] on Route 35 and Sunset Avenue, fully clothed with no signs of [[sexual assault]] and with four bullets in her head.&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bovsun2010" /&gt; He had found the young woman walking down the boardwalk in Asbury Park, and lured her into his car. A friend of Biegenwald's wife went to police after Biegenwald showed her another young woman's body that he had hidden inside his Asbury Park home's garage.&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt;

Biegenwald was also suspected, but never charged, in two other killings. One involved the shooting death of John Petrone, an ex–convict and sometime police informer, unearthed—minus his jawbone—on a remote New Jersey wildlife preserve. 
The other case involved Virginia Clayton, 17, abducted and killed on September 8, 1982, her body found three days later, four miles from the site where Petrone was buried.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Newton - An Encyclopedia of Modern Serial Killers - Hunting Humans&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capture==
Police surrounded Biegenwald's home on January 22, 1983, where Dherran Fitzgerald also lived.&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt; Police lured Biegenwald out of his house using a ruse and when he stepped off his back porch, he was grabbed by officers. Fitzgerald saw the commotion and hid himself in a secret room with several weapons. Detectives located the room and after threatening to shoot through the wall, he surrendered. A search of the home revealed a large cache of weapons and illegal drugs. Police confiscated several [[pipe bomb]]s, [[handgun]]s, rifles, shotguns, a [[machine gun]], [[Rohypnol]], chloral hydrate, [[marijuana]], a live [[Bitis arietans|puff adder]], venom collecting apparatus, and floor plans for several area notable residences and businesses.&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt;

During questioning, Fitzgerald told police of a third body, that of a young woman, that Biegenwald had shown him hidden in his garage.&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt; This victim was driven to the rear of Burger King in Ocean Township, and dumped in the wooded area behind. Fitzgerald told police that he helped Biegenwald transport another body to his mother's house in Staten Island and bury it in the basement. Fitzgerald went on to say that while he was digging in the basement, he exhumed a body that Biegenwald had buried there some time before. Fitzgerald led police to three other bodies in addition to the two buried in Staten Island.

As the investigation went on, police located a ninth victim, William Ward, who was buried in a shallow grave in [[Neptune City, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="Bovsun2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AP080310" /&gt; Ward was a prison escapee whom Biegenwald had shot four&lt;ref name="AP080310" /&gt; or five&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt; times in the head and then disposed of the body at a cemetery nearby.

Police only had enough evidence to charge Biegenwald with five counts of [[first degree murder]]. Fitzgerald turned [[state's evidence]].&lt;ref name="Bovsun2010" /&gt;

==Death==
Biegenwald died on March 10, 2008 at St. Francis Medical Center in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], said Corrections Department spokeswoman Deirdre Fedkenheuer in an interview to the [[Associated Press]].&lt;ref name="Bovsun2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AP080310" /&gt;

'''Runaway climate change''' or '''runaway global warming''' is hypothesized to follow a [[tipping point (climatology)|tipping point]] in the [[climate system]], after accumulated [[climate change]] initiates a reinforcing [[positive feedback]]. This rapid acceleration in climate change may lead to potentially irreversible damage to the climate system, making timely mitigation efforts unfeasible. This is thought to cause the climate to rapidly change until it reaches a new stable condition.&lt;ref name=Brown06&gt;{{cite web|title=How close is runaway climate change?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/oct/18/bookextracts.books|first=Paul|last=Brown|date=2006-10-18|accessdate=2009-05-25|publisher=[[Guardian.co.uk]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These phrases may be used with reference to concerns about rapid [[global warming]].&lt;ref name=Brown06 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Monbiot&gt;{{cite web|title=Identity Politics in Climate Change Hell|author=George Monbiot |authorlink=George Monbiot|date=2008-08-22|publisher=Monbiot.com|url=http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2008/08/22/identity-politics-in-climate-change-hell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some astronomers use the expression runaway [[greenhouse effect]] to describe a situation where the climate deviates catastrophically and permanently from the original state—as happened on [[Venus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pages = 1037–1039 | issue = 5250 | volume = 226 | date = Jun 1970 | doi = 10.1038/2261037a0 | pmid = 16057644 | issn = 0028-0836 | journal = Nature | first2 = C. | first1 = I. | title = The Runaway Greenhouse and the Accumulation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the Venus Atmosphere | url = http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/1970/1970_Rasool_DeBergh.pdf | last1 = Rasool | format =  | last2 = De Bergh | bibcode = 1970Natur.226.1037R | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111021110413/http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/1970/1970_Rasool_DeBergh.pdf | archivedate = 2011-10-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first1 = J.

*At a ''point of no return'', climate impacts that are irreversible on a practical time scale occur. An example of such an impact is the disintegration of a large ice sheet.&lt;ref name="hansen_1208" /&gt;

==Runaway greenhouse effect==
{{See also|Runaway greenhouse effect}}
The ''runaway greenhouse effect'' has several meanings. At the least extreme, this implies global warming sufficient to induce out-of-control amplifying feedbacks, such as ice sheet disintegration and melting of [[methane hydrate]]s. At the most extreme, a Venus-like planet with crustal carbon baked into the atmosphere and a surface temperature of several hundred degrees, an irreversible [[climate state]].

Between these two is the ''moist greenhouse'', which occurs if the climate forcing is large enough to make [[water vapour]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) a major [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmospheric constituent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kasting | first = JF | year = 1988 | title = Runaway and moist greenhouse atmospheres and the evolution of Earth and Venus. | journal = Icarus | volume = 74| issue = 3| pages =472–494| bibcode =  1988Icar...74..472K| doi = 10.1016/0019-1035(88)90116-9 | pmid = 11538226| arxiv = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In principle, an extreme moist greenhouse might cause an instability with water vapour preventing radiation to space of all absorbed solar energy, resulting in very high surface temperature and evaporation of the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ingersoll | first = AP | year = 1969 | title = Runaway greenhouse: a history of water on Venus | journal = J. Atmos. Sci. | volume = 26 | pages =1191–1198| bibcode =  1969JAtS...26.1191I| doi = 10.1175/1520-0469(1969)026&lt;1191:TRGAHO&gt;2.0.CO;2 | pmid = | arxiv = | id = | url = http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469(1969)026%3C1191%3ATRGAHO%3E2.0.CO%3B2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, simulations indicate that no plausible human-made [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) forcing can cause an instability and baked-crust runaway greenhouse effect.&lt;ref name="Hansen et al 2013" /&gt;

Conceivable levels of human-made climate forcing could yield the'' low-end'' runaway greenhouse. A forcing of 12–16 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; would require [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) levels to increase 8–16 times. If the forcing were due only to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; change, this would raise the global mean temperature by 16–24&amp;nbsp;°C with much larger polar warming. A warming of 16–24&amp;nbsp;°C produces a moderately moist greenhouse, with water vapour increasing to about 1% of the atmosphere's mass, thus increasing the rate of [[hydrogen]] escape to space. If such a forcing were entirely due to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the weathering process would remove the excess atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on a time scale of 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; years, well before the ocean was significantly depleted. Venus-like conditions on the Earth require a large long-term forcing that is unlikely to occur until the sun brightens by a few tens of percents, which will take a few billion years.&lt;ref name="Hansen et al 2013" /&gt;

===Global habitability===

==Feedback effects==
{{See also|Climate change feedback}}
The core of the concept of runaway climate change is the idea of a large positive feedback within the climate system. When a change in global temperature causes an event to occur which itself changes global temperature, this is referred to as a [[feedback]] effect. If this effect acts in the same direction as the original temperature change, it is a destabilising [[positive feedback]] (e.g. warming causing more warming); and if in the opposite direction, it is a stabilising [[negative feedback]] (e.g. warming causing a cooling effect). If a sufficiently strong net positive feedback occurs, it is said that a [[climate tipping point]] has been passed and the temperature will continue to change until the changed conditions result in negative feedbacks that restabilise the climate on a new, stable equilibrium manifold.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

An example of a negative feedback is that radiation leaving the Earth increases in proportion to the fourth [[Exponentiation|power]] of temperature, in accordance with the [[Stefan-Boltzmann law]]. This feedback is always operational; therefore, while it may be overridden by positive feedbacks for comparatively small temperature changes it will dominate for larger temperature changes. An example of a positive feedback is the [[ice-albedo feedback]], in which increasing temperature causes ice to melt, which increases the amount of heat that Earth absorbs. This feedback only operates in a restricted range of temperatures (those for which ice exists, and does not cover the whole surface; once all the ice has melted, the feedback ceases to operate).

Climate feedback effects can involve positive feedback in a type of forcing, such as the release of methane due to rising [[Atmospheric methane|methane levels]]; other greenhouse gases, as when CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; causes the release of methane; or other variables, such as the [[ice-albedo feedback]].

Without [[climate feedback]]s, a doubling in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration would result in a global average temperature increase of around 1.2&amp;nbsp;°C. [[water vapor feedback|Water vapor]] amount and [[cloud]]s are probably the most important global climate feedbacks. [[Palaeoclimatology|Historical information]] and [[global climate model]]s indicate a [[climate sensitivity]] of 1.5 to 4.5&amp;nbsp;°C, with a best estimate of 3&amp;nbsp;°C. This is an amplification of the carbon dioxide forcing by a factor of 2.5. Some studies suggest a lower climate sensitivity, but other studies indicate a sensitivity above this range. Partly because of the difficulty in modeling the [[cloud feedback]], the true climate sensitivity remains uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Slow===
Slow feedback effects—especially changes in the sizes of ice sheets and levels of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;—amplify the sensitivity of the total Earth system by an amount that depends on the time scale considered.&lt;ref name="Hansen et al 2013" /&gt;

There are known examples of the Earth's climate producing a large response to small forcings. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; feedback effect is believed to be part of the transition between [[glacial]] and [[interglacial]] periods, with [[orbital forcing]] providing the initial trigger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = N.

A 2006 book chapter by Cox et al. considers the possibility of a future runaway climate feedback due to changes in the land [[carbon cycle]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;blockquote&gt;Here we use a simple land carbon balance model to analyse the conditions required for a land sink-to-source transition, and address the question; could the land carbon cycle lead to a runaway climate feedback? [...] The simple land carbon balance model has effective parameters representing the sensitivities of climate and [[photosynthesis]] to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the sensitivities of [[soil respiration]] and photosynthesis to temperature. This model is used to show that (a) a carbon sink-to-source transition is inevitable beyond some finite critical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration provided a few simple conditions are satisfied, (b) the value of the critical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration is poorly known due to uncertainties in land carbon cycle parameters and especially in the climate sensitivity to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and (c) that a true runaway land carbon-climate feedback (or linear instability) in the future is unlikely given that the land masses are currently acting as a carbon sink.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Fast===
In general, fast feedback climate sensitivity depends on the initial climate state. Fast feedback effects include changes in levels of water vapour and aerosols, as well as changes in cloud cover and the extent of sea ice.&lt;ref name="Hansen et al 2013" /&gt;

===Methane deposits and clathrates===
Potentially unstable methane deposits exists in [[permafrost]] regions, which are expected to retreat as a result of global warming,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 32| pages = L24401| year = 2005| doi = 10.1029/2005GL025080| first1=D.

The [[clathrate gun]] runaway effect may be used to describe more rapid methane releases. Methane in the atmosphere has a high [[global warming potential]], but breaks down relatively quickly to form CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is also a greenhouse gas. Therefore, slow methane release will have the long-term effect of adding CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the atmosphere.

In order to model clathrates and other reservoirs of greenhouse gases and their precursors, [[global climate model]]s would have to be 'coupled' to a carbon cycle model. Most current global climate models do not include modelling of methane deposits.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Current risk==
The scientific consensus in the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Summary for Policymakers|title=Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr_spm.pdf|format=PDF|date= November 17, 2007 |publisher=[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; is that "Anthropogenic warming could lead to some effects that are abrupt or irreversible, depending upon the rate and magnitude of the climate change." Note however that this statement is about situations weaker than "runaway change".  Text prepared for the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] states that "a 'runaway greenhouse effect'—analogous to Venus—appears to have virtually no chance of being induced by [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] activities."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipcc.ch/meetings/session31/inf3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates of the size of the total carbon reservoir in Arctic [[permafrost]] and [[clathrates]] vary widely.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14034">'''Science advice''' is the process, structures and institutions through which governments and politicians consider science, technology and innovation information in policy- and decision- making. Across different national governments and international bodies, there are a variety of structures and institutions for scientific advice.  They reflect distinctive cultures and traditions of decision-making, which [[Sheila Jasanoff]] has termed the ‘civic epistemology’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11016-008-9201-6#page-1 |title= Controlling Biotechnology: Science, Democracy and ‘Civic Epistemology’|date=2008-05-07 |accessdate= 2015-05-31 |doi=10.1007/s11016-008-9201-6 |volume= 17 |journal=Metascience |pages= 177–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; through which expert claims are constructed, validated or challenged in a given society.

Science advice can also be called "science for policy," indicating the flow of information from scientific to policy domains with the intention of informing decisions. This is distinct from "policy for science," the institutions, rules and norms governing how science is funded, conducted, and communicated.

At the national level, countries have diverse models for how to connect scientists and policymakers. In some countries, the president of the [[National academy]], an elected organization of distinguished researchers in natural and social sciences, engineering, medicine, and the humanities, serves as a government science advisor, while other countries have an advisory committee or civil servants perform this role.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web | first1 =James | last1 = Wilsdon | first2 = Kristiann | last2 = Allen | first3 = Katsia | last3 = Paulavets |url= https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2014/aug/27/a-rough-guide-to-science-advice |title=A rough guide to science advice &amp;#124; Science | work =The guardian | accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; National academies are often commissioned to write reports advising government on the state of scientific knowledge to inform policy-relevant questions, such as the risk from chemicals or disease.

Other countries, such as the UK, have a wide range of sources of expert scientific advice which draw on several of these sources.&lt;ref name= "globalscienceadvice.org"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.globalscienceadvice.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Science_Advice_to_Governments_Briefing_Paper_25-August.pdf |format=PDF |title=Science Advice to Governments: Diverse systems, common challenges |publisher= Global science advice |accessdate= 2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

At the international level, there is an increasing movement to bring together national science advisors to share best practices and form a network to deal with global challenges (e.g., pandemics, climate change). The first global Science Advice to Governments meeting was held in Auckland, New Zealand on August 27–28, 2014.  This meeting brought together high-level science advisors, scientists, and practitioners to discuss the relationship between science and policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.globalscienceadvice.org/ |title=INGSA |publisher= Global science advice | accessdate= 2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new network of European science academies was established at the European Open Science meeting in Copenhagen in June 2014,&lt;ref name= "guardian" /&gt; which now includes 20 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.slideshare.net/SciAdvice14/1000-days-in-the-life-of-a-science-advisor-38529597 |title=1000 days in the life of a science advisor |publisher=Slideshare | accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU) is a major international organization with a program in science for policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.icsu.org/science-for-policy/ |title= Introduction: Science for Policy |publisher=ICSU |date= 2015-05-25 |accessdate= 2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Science advice structures ==
A briefing paper,&lt;ref name="globalscienceadvice.org" /&gt; described four of the most commonly used science advice structures for jurisdictions: advisory councils, advisory committees, national academies, and chief scientific advisors. These structures are most commonly employed at the national level, but may also be used in sub-national jurisdictions like Quebec, or supra-national bodies like the [[European Commission]], which has an in-house science service, the [[Joint Research Centre]].

Science advice also occurs at sub-national levels, where structures may include departmental scientific advisors (for example, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], and at the international level, where networks such as the [[International Council for Science]] coordinate science for policy, for example through serving as the science voice in the [[United Nations]].

For any of these structures, individual experts may be asked for advice in specific circumstances.

! Science Advice Structure&lt;ref name= "globalscienceadvice.org" /&gt;!! Explanation&lt;ref name= "globalscienceadvice.org" /&gt;
|-
| Advisory councils || Many economies have a high-level council for science (or science and innovation) policy. Members typically include senior scientists, alongside representatives of industry, higher education and civil society. Examples include Japan’s Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (CSTI) and the US President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). Another example is Australia, where chief scientist Ian Chubb recently announced that he plans to establish a new science council to advise government on policy. However, in most systems, the focus of such entities remains on policy advice in relation to the science system, which is distinct from science advice for public policy.

|-
| Advisory committees || Most governments also rely on an array of specialized scientific and expert committees, which can address detailed technical and regulatory issues in areas such as health, environment and food safety. For example, the US and Japan have hundreds of such committees; the UK has over seventy.
|-

|-
| National academies || A growing number of national academies are active in science policy and/or policy for science. In economies such as Canada, China, Germany, Netherlands, South Africa, US and UK, academies are an important source of scientific advice. Furthermore, networks of national academies such as the International Council for Science, with a membership of 121 national bodies, representing 141 economies, and 31 International Scientific Unions, and the Inter-Academy Panel, the global network of science academies from 107 economies are actively involved in science for policy processes at the international level.
|-

|-
| Chief scientific advisors || The first chief scientific advisor was appointed by the US in 1957, followed by the UK in 1964.  The first chief scientific advisor in Quebec, Canada, was appointed in 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2935">'''Scott Davis''' (September 21, 1943, in [[San Francisco, California]]-August 18, 2010 in [[Cerritos, California]]) was perhaps the top [[Track and Field]] announcer in the [[United States]] from the 1980s until his death.  He was the primary public address voice at major meets including championship meets like the [[United States Olympic Trials (track and field)|Olympic Trials]], the [[USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships]], the [[NCAA Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship|NCAA Championships]] and top level professional meets that encompass the currently named [[Visa Championship Series]] like the [[Prefontaine Classic]], the [[Adidas Grand Prix]] and most notably at the [[Mt. SAC Relays]], where he was also the meet director for a decade starting in 1997.  He was also frequently the English language voice of many top level International meets, including the [[1996 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;http://mobile.latimes.com/wap/news/text.jsp?sid=294&amp;nid=19308715&amp;cid=16677&amp;scid=1029&amp;ith=2&amp;title=Obituaries LA Times Obit&lt;/ref&gt;  The last meet he announced was the [[2010 World Junior Championships in Athletics]] in [[Moncton]], [[Canada]].  His voice from that meet can be heard as the English announcer {{YouTube|k9vZ89oWr9E|in this video}}.

A top track statistician, he founded the Federation of American Statisticians of Track (FAST), publishing its annual summation of statistics called the "FAST Annual" which he frequently promoted and sold from the announcer's booth.&lt;ref&gt;http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/sports_globetrotting/2010/08/track-and-field-loses-two-of-its-best-halconnolly-scott-davis.html Bob Hersh, Chicago Tribune&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the editor of [[USATF]]'s media guide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.registerguard.com/cms/index.php/track-and-field/comments/sad-news-veteran-track-and-field-announcer-scott-davis-dies/ Register Guard&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also the secretary of the [[Association of Track and Field Statisticians]], serving from 1994 until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atfs.org/a-t-f-s-honor-board/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925172224/http://atfs.org/a-t-f-s-honor-board/ |archivedate=2015-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis had suffered from various forms of cancer for 13 years.  He was posthumously elected into the Mt. SAC Relays Hall of Fame in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mtsacrelays.com/fame.html&lt;/ref&gt;

When Garr was 11 years old, her father died in Los Angeles of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].&lt;ref name=ct/&gt; She recalled that his death "left us bereft, without any kind of income. And I saw my mother be this incredibly strong, creative woman who put three kids through college—one of my brothers is a surgeon. Any kind of lessons we wanted, we had to have scholarships or sweep the floors. It had to be free. And so we always had to try harder. That was instilled in me very early."&lt;ref name=ct/&gt; During her youth, Garr expressed interest in dancing, and trained extensively in [[ballet]].&lt;ref name=ct/&gt; "I'd go for three, four hours a day; my feet would be bleeding," she recalled. "I'd take buses all over the city just to go to the best dancing schools.

In the early-1980s, Garr was in a four-year relationship with film executive [[Roger Birnbaum]].&lt;ref name=bricker&gt;{{cite web|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|url=https://people.com/archive/teri-garr-is-no-dizzy-blonde-but-acting-like-one-in-tootsie-hasnt-hurt-vol-19-no-7/|title=Teri Garr Is No Dizzy Blonde, but Acting Like One in Tootsie Hasn't Hurt|author=Bricker, Rebecca|date=February 21, 1983|archive-url=https://archive.today/20181022001534/https://people.com/archive/teri-garr-is-no-dizzy-blonde-but-acting-like-one-in-tootsie-hasnt-hurt-vol-19-no-7/|archive-date=October 22, 2018|access-date=October 22, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After separating from Birnbaum, Garr was in a seven-year relationship with David Kipper, a physician, whom she was introduced to by [[Carrie Fisher]].{{sfn|Garr|2006|pages=141, 152–155}}

Garr has one daughter, Molly O'Neil, born in November 1993, who she adopted with her husband, contractor John O'Neil; the two were there on the day their adopted daughter was born. Garr and O'Neil divorced in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Deseret News]]|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/470410/ACTRESS-WANTS-A-DIVORCE---ALONG-WITH-ALL-EARNINGS.html|title=ACTRESS WANTS A DIVORCE - ALONG WITH ALL EARNINGS|date=February 8, 1996|archive-url=https://archive.today/20181021233155/https://www.deseretnews.com/article/470410/ACTRESS-WANTS-A-DIVORCE---ALONG-WITH-ALL-EARNINGS.html|archive-date=October 21, 2018|access-date=October 22, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health issues===
In October 2002, Garr publicly confirmed that she had been diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]].&lt;ref name="multiplesclerosis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/News/10/08/teri.garr.ms|title=Teri Garr reveals she has multiple sclerosis|date=October 9, 2002|accessdate=June 5, 2007|work=CNN|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AGWfZ8xB?url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/News/10/08/teri.garr.ms|archivedate=August 28, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After years of uncertainty and secrecy surrounding her diagnosis, Garr explained her reasons for deciding to go public: "I'm telling my story for the first time so I can help people. I can help people know they aren't alone and tell them there are reasons to be optimistic because, today, treatment options are available."&lt;ref name="multiplesclerosis"/&gt;

In interviews, she has commented that she first started noticing symptoms while in New York filming ''[[Tootsie]]'' around 1982. After disclosing her condition, she became a National Ambassador for the [[National Multiple Sclerosis Society]] and National Chair for the Society's Women Against MS program (WAMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news-medical.net/?id=1021|title=Actress Teri Garr named as multiple sclerosis national chairwoman|accessdate=June 5, 2007|date=April 29, 2004|work=News-Medical.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2005, Garr was honored as the society's Ambassador of the Year.

:The [[Bisbee Deportation]]:&lt;ref name="fillippelli_p025" /&gt; After seizing the local Western Union telegraph office in order to cut off outside communication, several thousand armed vigilantes forced 1,185 men in [[Bisbee, Arizona]] into manure-laden boxcars and "deported" them to the New Mexico desert. The action was precipitated by a strike when workers' demands (including improvements to safety and working conditions at the local copper mines, an end to discrimination against labor organizations and unequal treatment of foreign and minority workers, and the institution of a [[living wage|fair wage]] system) went unmet. The "deportation" was organized by Sheriff Harry Wheeler. The incident was investigated months later by a Federal Mediation Commission set up by President [[Woodrow Wilson]]; the Commission found that no federal law applied, and referred the case to the State of Arizona, which failed to take any action, citing patriotism and support for the war as justification for the vigilantes' action.

In October 2013, the incarceration rate of the United States of America was the highest in the world, at 716 per 100,000 of the national population. While the United States represents about 4.4 percent of the world's population, it houses around 22 percent of the world's prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Walmsley (November 21, 2013).

In 2016, the [[Prison Policy Initiative]] estimated that in the United States, about 2,298,300 people were incarcerated out of a population of 323.1 million. This means that 0.71% of the population was behind bars. Of those who were incarcerated, about 1,351,000 people were in state prison, 646,000 in local jails, 211,000 in federal prisons, 34,000 in youth correctional facilities, 33,000 in immigration detention camps, 14,000 in territorial prisons, 5,500 in civil commitment, 2,400 in Indian country jails, and 1,400 in United States military prisons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2016.html Mass Incarceration: The Whole Pie 2016 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

This number comprises local jails with a nominal capacity of 866,782 inmates occupied at 86.4% (June 6, 2010), state prisons with a nominal capacity of approximately 1,140,500 occupied at approximately 115% (December 31, 2010), and federal prisons with a nominal capacity of 126,863 occupied at 136.0% (December 31, 2010).  Of this number, 21.5% are [[pretrial detainee]]s (December 31, 2010), 8.7% are [[female prisoners]] (December 31, 2010), 0.4% are juveniles (June 6, 2009), and 5.9% are foreign prisoners (June 30, 2007).&lt;ref name="prisonstudies.org"/&gt;

The imprisonment rate varies widely by state; Louisiana surpasses this by about 100%, but Maine incarcerates at about a fifth this rate.  A report released 28 February 2008, indicates that more than 1 in 100 adults in the United States are in prison.&lt;ref name=pewcenterstudy&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewstates.org/uploadedFiles/PCS_Assets/2008/one%20in%20100.pdf |title=One in 100: Behind Bars in America 2008 |date=28 February 2008 |publisher=[[Pew Charitable Trusts|The Pew Center on the States]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a [[U.S. Department of Justice]] report published in 2006, over 7.2 million people were at that time in [[prison]], on [[probation]], or on [[parole]] (released from prison with restrictions). That means roughly 1 in every 32 adult Americans are under some sort of [[criminal justice system]] control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/ppus09.pdf Probation and Parole in the United States, 2006].

The [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]] has released a study which finds that, despite the total number of prisoners incarcerated for drug-related offenses increasing by 57,000 between 1997 and 2004, the proportion of drug offenders to total prisoners in State prison populations stayed steady at 21%. The percentage of Federal prisoners serving time for drug offenses declined from 63% in 1997 to 55% in that same period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090830192737/http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/dudsfp04.pdf Christopher J.

In 2009, the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] announced that the growth rate of the state prison population had fallen to its lowest since 2006, but it still had a 0.2% growth-rate compared to the total U.S. prison population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/py09ac.pdf |title=US DOJ Data Brief: Prisoners at Yearend 2009–Advance Counts}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Prisons in California|California state prison system]] population fell in 2009, the first year that populations had fallen in 38 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.aolnews.com/nation/article/us-state-prison-population-falls-for-first-time-in-38-years/19403469 |title=US State Prison Population Falls for First Time in 38 Years |last=Martelle |first=Scott |year=2010 |publisher=AOL |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322200340/http://www.aolnews.com/nation/article/us-state-prison-population-falls-for-first-time-in-38-years/19403469 |archivedate=2010-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When looking at specific populations within the criminal justice system the growth rates are vastly different. In 1977, there were just slightly more than eleven thousand incarcerated women. By 2004, the number of [[Incarceration of women in the United States|women under state or federal prison]] had increased by 757 percent, to more than 111,000, and the percentage of women in prison has increased every year, at roughly double the rate of men, since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Talvi|first=Silja J.A|title=Women Behind Bars: The Crisis of Women in the U.S Prison System|year=2007|publisher=Seal Press|location=California|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of incarcerated women has expanded at about 4.6% annually between 1995 and 2005 with women now accounting for 7% of the population in state and federal prisons.

Rates per 100,000 were converted to percentages.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A 2014 report by the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] identified two main causes of the increase in the United States' incarceration rate over the previous 40 years: longer prison sentences and increases in the likelihood of imprisonment. The same report found that longer prison sentences were the main driver of increasing incarceration rates since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.nap.edu/read/18613/chapter/5 | title=The Growth of Incarceration in the United States: Exploring Causes and Consequences | publisher=National Research Council| author=Travis, Jeremy | year=2014 | pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Increased sentencing laws ===
{{Further|Three-strikes law}}

Even though there are other countries that commit more inmates to prison annually, the fact that the United States keeps their prisoners longer causes the total rate to become higher. To give an example, the average burglary sentence in the United States is 16 months, compared to 5 months in [[Canada]] and 7 months in England.&lt;ref name=liptak&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/23/us/23prison.html?pagewanted=print | work=The New York Times | title=Inmate Count in U.S. Dwarfs Other Nations' | first=Adam | last=Liptak | date=2008-04-23 | accessdate=2010-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking at reasons for imprisonment will further clarify why the incarceration rate and length of sentences are so high. The practice of imposing longer prison sentences on repeat offenders is common in many countries but the [[three-strikes law]]s in the U.S. with mandatory 25 year imprisonment — implemented in many states in the 1990s — are statutes enacted by state governments in the United States which mandate state courts to impose harsher sentences on habitual offenders who are previously convicted of two prior serious criminal offenses and then commit a third.

=== Economic and age contributions ===
Crime rates in low-income areas are much higher than in middle to high class areas. As a result, Incarceration rates in low-income areas are much higher than in wealthier areas due to these high crime rates.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/ten_economic_facts_about_crime_and_incarceration_in_the_united_states|title=Ten Economic Facts about Crime and Incarceration in the United States {{!}} The Hamilton Project|website=www.hamiltonproject.org|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the incarcerated or criminal is a youth, there is a significant impact on the individual and rippling effects on entire communities.  Social capital is lost when an individual is incarcerated.  How much social capital is lost is hard to accurately estimate, however Aizer and Doyle found a strong positive correlation between lower income as an adult if an individual is incarcerated in their youth in comparison to those who are not incarcerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aizer|first=Anna|last2=Doyle|first2=Joseph J.|date=2015-02-02|title=Juvenile Incarceration, Human Capital, and Future Crime: Evidence from Randomly Assigned Judges*|url=http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/04/11/qje.qjv003|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume=130|issue=2|language=en|pages=759–803|doi=10.1093/qje/qjv003|issn=0033-5533|hdl=1721.1/97380}}&lt;/ref&gt; 63 percent to 66 percent of those involved in crimes are under the age of thirty.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; People incarcerated at a younger age lose the capability to invest in themselves and in their communities.  Their children and families become susceptible to financial burden preventing them from escaping low-income communities.  This contributes to the recurring cycle of poverty that is positively correlated with incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mosley|first=Paul|last2=Verschoor|first2=Arjan|date=2005-03-01|title=Risk Attitudes and the 'Vicious Circle of Poverty'|journal=The European Journal of Development Research|volume=17|issue=1|pages=59–88|doi=10.1080/09578810500066548|issn=0957-8811}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Poverty rates have not been curbed despite steady economic growth.

=== Drug sentencing laws ===
The "[[War on Drugs]]" is a policy that was initiated by [[Richard Nixon]] with the [[Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970]] and vigorously pursued by [[Ronald Reagan]].&lt;ref name=JC&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Michelle|title=The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindess|year=2010|publisher=The New Press|location=New York|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, drug offenders in federal prison had increased to 500,000 per year, up from 41,000 in 1985. According to [[Michelle Alexander]], drug related charges accounted for more than half the rise in state prisoners between 1985 and 2000. 31 million people have been arrested on drug related charges, approximately 1 in 10 Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Michelle|title=The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness|year=2010|publisher=The New Press|location=New York|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Shackles Beyond the Sentence: How Legal Financial Obligations Create a Permanent Underclass|ssrn = 2628977|publisher = Social Science Research Network|date = 2015-07-09|location = Rochester, NY|last = SpearIt}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, John Pfaff of [[Fordham Law School]] has accused Alexander of exaggerating the influence of the War on Drugs on the rise in the United States' incarceration rate: according to him, the percent of state prisoners whose primary offense was drug-related peaked at 22% in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2015/02/mass_incarceration_a_provocative_new_theory_for_why_so_many_americans_are.html | title=Why Are So Many Americans in Prison? | work=Slate | date=6 February 2015 | accessdate=14 February 2016 | author=Neyfakh, Leon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Brookings Institution reconciles the differences between Alexander and Pfaff by explaining two ways to look at the prison population as it relates to drug crimes, concluding "The picture is clear: Drug crimes have been the predominant reason for new admissions into state and federal prisons in recent decades" and "rolling back the war on drugs would not, as Pfaff and Urban Institute scholars maintain, totally solve the problem of mass incarceration, but it could help a great deal, by reducing exposure to prison."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/social-mobility-memos/2015/11/25/drug-offenders-in-american-prisons-the-critical-distinction-between-stock-and-flow/ | title=Drug offenders in American prisons: The critical distinction between stock and flow | work=Brookings | date=25 November 2015 | accessdate=1 September 2016 | author=Rothwell, Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the passage of Reagan's [[Anti-Drug Abuse Act]] in 1986, incarceration for non-violent offenses dramatically increased.  The Act imposed the same five-year mandatory sentence on those with convictions involving crack as on those possessing 100 times as much powder cocaine.&lt;ref name=JC /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lyons"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lyons|first=John|title=War on the Family: Mothers in Prison and the Children They Leave Behind|work=DVD|publisher=Peace Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt; This had a disproportionate effect on low-level street dealers and users of crack, who were more commonly poor blacks, Latinos, the young, and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Golden|first=Renny|title=War on the Family: Mothers in Prison and the Families They Leave Behind|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Courts were given more discretion in sentencing by the ''[[Kimbrough v. United States]]'' (2007) decision, and the disparity was decreased to 18:1 by the [[Fair Sentencing Act of 2010]].&lt;ref name=famm&gt;[http://www.famm.org/FederalSentencing/USCongress/BillsinCongress/TheFairSentencingActof2010.aspx "Fair Sentencing Act of 2010"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303203132/http://www.famm.org/FederalSentencing/USCongress/BillsinCongress/TheFairSentencingActof2010.aspx |date=March 3, 2012 }}, Families Against Mandatory Minimums, famm.org. Retrieved September 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  {{As of|2006}}, 49.3% of state prisoners, or 656,000 individuals, were incarcerated for non-[[violent crime]]s. {{As of|2008}}, 90.7% of federal prisoners, or 165,457 individuals, were incarcerated for non-violent offenses.&lt;ref name=prisoners2008/&gt;

According to the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], "Even when  women have minimal or no involvement in the drug trade, they are increasingly caught in the ever-widening net cast by current drug laws, through provisions of the criminal law such as those involving [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]], [[accomplice liability]], and [[constructive possession]] that expand [[criminal liability]] to reach partners, relatives and bystanders."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.aclu.org/womens-rights/words-prison-did-you-know#_edn13 Words From Prison - Did You Know...?]", [[American Civil Liberties Union]], June 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

These new policies also disproportionately affect African-American women. According to [[Dorothy E. Roberts]], the explanation is that poor women, who are disproportionately black, are more likely to be placed under constant supervision by the State in order to receive social services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Dorothy|title=Killing the Black Body: Race, Reproduction, and the Meaning of Liberty|year=1997|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are then more likely to be caught by officials who are instructed to look specifically for drug offenses. Roberts argues that the criminal justice system's creation of new crimes has a direct effect on the number of women, especially black women, who then become incarcerated.

===Racialization ===

One of the first laws in the U.S. against drugs was the Opium Exclusion Act of 1909. It prohibited the smoking of opium, which was ingested but not smoked by a substantial portion of caucasian housewives in America.  It was smoked mainly by Asian American immigrants coming to build the railroads. These immigrants were targeted with anti-Asian sentiment, as many voters believed they were losing jobs to Asian immigrants.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

This pattern was repeated in the late twentieth century with higher penalties for crack cocaine than powder.  Crack was consumed primarily by African Americans, while powder was consumed more by the white middle-class.  The substantial penalties for crack contributed to the five-fold increase in incarcerations seen in the plot above.{{Citation needed|reason=I'm sure that the difference in penalties between crack and powder have been discussed.  I remember seeing a movie about the 2008 global financial crisis that claimed that Wall Street in the "cocaine consumption capital of the world."

Figures from 2008 offer a better illustration of the situation with 28% of arrests involving African Americans and African American men comprising almost half of the current incarcerated population in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warde|first1=Bryan|title=Black Male Disproportionality in the Criminal Justice Systems of the USA, Canada, and England: a Comparative Analysis of Incarceration|journal=Journal of African American Studies|date=December 2013|volume=17|issue=4|page=461|url=https://www.jstor.org.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/stable/43525522|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prison privatization===
In the 1980s, the rising number of people incarcerated as a result of the War on Drugs and the wave of privatization that occurred under the [[Reagan Administration]] saw the emergence of the for-profit prison industry.

The industry is well aware of what reduced crime rates could mean to their bottom line. This from the CCA's SEC report in 2010:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our growth … depends on a number of factors we cannot control, including crime rates … [R]eductions in crime rates … could lead to reductions in arrests, convictions and sentences requiring incarceration at correctional facilities.&lt;ref name="Shapiro"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Editorial policies of major media===
Gallup polling since 1989 has found that in most years in which there was a decline in the U.S. crime rate, a majority of Americans said that violent crime was getting worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/150464/americans-believe-crime-worsening.aspx|title=Most Americans Believe Crime in U.S. Is Worsening|author=Gallup, Inc.|work=Gallup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/179546/americans-crime-last-year.aspx|title=Most Americans Still See Crime Up Over Last Year|author=Gallup, Inc.|work=Gallup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/165653/crime-americans-seem-noticed.aspx|title=U.S. Crime Is Up, but Americans Don't Seem to Have Noticed|author=Gallup, Inc.|work=Gallup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A substantial body of research claims that incarceration rates are primarily a function of media editorial policies, largely unrelated to the actual crime rate.  ''Constructing Crime:  Perspectives on Making News and Social Problems'' is a book collecting together papers on this theme.&lt;ref&gt;Potter and Kapeller (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers say that the jump in incarceration rate from 0.1% to 0.5% of the United States population from 1975 to 2000 (documented in the figure above) was driven by changes in the editorial policies of the mainstream commercial media and is unrelated to any actual changes in crime.  [[Media consolidation]] reduced competition on content. That allowed media company executives to maintain substantially the same audience while slashing budgets for investigative journalism and filling the space from the police blotter, which tended to increase and stabilize advertising revenue. It is safer, easier and cheaper to write about crimes committed by poor people than the wealthy. Poor people can be libeled with impunity, but major advertisers can materially impact the profitability of a commercial media organization by reducing their purchases of advertising space with that organization.

News media thrive on [[Media feeding frenzy|feeding frenzies]] (such as [[Missing white woman syndrome|missing white women]]) because they tend to reduce production costs while simultaneously building an audience interested in the latest development in a particular story. It takes a long time for a reporter to learn enough to write intelligently about a specific issue. Once a reporter has achieved that level of knowledge, it is easier to write subsequent stories. However, major advertisers have been known to spend their advertising budgets through different channels when they dislike the editorial policies. Therefore, a media feeding frenzy focusing on an issue of concern to an advertiser may reduce revenue and profits.&lt;ref&gt;McCheney (2004, p. 81) wrote, "A five-year study of investigative journalism on TV news completed in 2002 determined that investigative journalism has all but disappeared from the nation's commercial airwaves."&lt;/ref&gt;

Sacco described how "competing news organizations responded to each other's coverage [while] the police, in their role as gatekeepers of crime news, reacted to the increased media interest by making available more stories that reflected and reinforced" a particular theme.  "[T]he dynamics of competitive journalism created a media feeding frenzy that found news workers 'snatching at shocking numbers' and 'smothering reports of stable or decreasing use under more ominous headlines.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The reasons cited above for increased incarcerations (US racial demographics, Increased sentencing laws, and Drug sentencing laws) have been described as consequences of the shift in editorial policies of the mainstream media.&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite book|last1=Sacco|first1=Vincent F|title=When Crime Waves|date=2005|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-0761927839}} and {{cite book|last1=Youngblood|first1=Steven|title=Peace Journalism Principles and Practices|date=2017|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-138-12467-7|pages=115–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, media coverage has been proven to have a profound impact on criminal sentencing. A study conducted found that the more media attention a criminal case is given, the greater the incentive for prosecutors and judges to pursue harsher sentences. This is directly linked to the enormous increase in media coverage of crime over the past two decades. While crime decreased by 8% between 1992 and 2002, news reports on crime increased by 800% and the average prison sentence length increased by 2,000% for all crimes. Less media coverage means a greater chance of a lighter sentence or that the defendant may avoid prison time entirely.

{{Women in society sidebar}}
'''Women in Uruguay''' are women who were born in, who live in, and are from [[Uruguay]]. According to ''Countries and Their Cultures'', there is a "very high proportion" of [[Uruguayan people|Uruguayan]] women participating in the labor force of the [[South America]]n country. The [[Constitution of Uruguay|Uruguayan legislation]] maintains that the women of Uruguay have equal rights to power, authority, and privileges". In reality, however, women are still not occupying "higher economic, [[Education in Uruguay|professional]], [[Politics of Uruguay|political]], [[Demographics of Uruguay|social]], and [[Religion in Uruguay|religious]] positions".&lt;ref name=EC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/To-Z/Uruguay.html#b |title=Culture of Uruguay - history, people, clothing, traditions, women, beliefs, food, customs, family |website=Everyculture.com |date=2010-10-09 |accessdate=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to the [[Politics of Uruguay|political arena]], [[UN Women]] reported that a 2012 study made by the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] (IPU) ranked Uruguay as being "103rd out of 189 countries in terms of [[Women in government|representation of women]] in [[General Assembly of Uruguay|Parliament]]".&lt;ref name=UNW&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.unwomen.org/2013/01/young-uruguayan-women-aim-to-boost-their-role-in-politics/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-07-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510040406/http://www.unwomen.org/2013/01/young-uruguayan-women-aim-to-boost-their-role-in-politics/# |archive-date=2013-05-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Uruguay low ranking is partly due to its low political participation of women: only 16% of members of Parliament are women as of 2014. &lt;ref name="quotaproject.org"/&gt;

==Notable women==
One prominent Uruguayan woman is [[Paulina Luisi]]. Luisi was a leader of the [[feminism|feminist movement]] in the country of [[Uruguay]]. In 1909, she became the first woman in the country to obtain a medical degree and was highly respected. She represented Uruguay in international women's conferences and traveled throughout [[Europe]]. She voiced her opinion on [[women's rights]], and in 1919, Paulina started the force for women's rights in Uruguay. By 1922, the [[Pan-American Conference of Women]] named Paulina Luisi an honorary vice president of the meeting and she continued to be an activist until Uruguay gave women the right to vote.

==Domestic violence==
{{Disputed section|date=September 2017|False asseveration}}
Domestic violence is a very serious problem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/countries/americas/uruguay |title=Uruguay Human Rights &amp;#124; Amnesty International USA |website=Amnestyusa.org |date= |accessdate=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially so-called [[crimes of passion]], which continue to be tolerated under Article 36 of the Penal Code (The passion provoked by adultery) – ''Artículo 36. (La pasión provocada por el adulterio)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/Codigos/CodigoPenal/l1t2.htm# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150730062858/http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/Codigos/CodigoPenal/l1t2.htm# |archive-date=2015-07-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2013, there have been  ongoing  political efforts to remove this provision from the Criminal Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.infobae.com/2013/11/26/1526432-uruguay-no-condena-el-homicidio-adulterio/ |title=Uruguay no condena el homicidio por adulterio |publisher=Infobae |date=2013-11-26 |accessdate=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uypress.net/auc.aspx?46564 |title=Violencia doméstica: proponen derogar artículo 36, sobre “pasión provocada por el adulterio” - uy.press / Agencia uruguaya de noticias |website=Uypress.net |date=2013-11-26 |accessdate=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.republica.com.uy/increible-pero-cierto-nuestro-codigo-exonera-homicidio-por-adulterio/407286/ |title=Nuestro Código exonera homicidio por adulterio - Diario La República |website=Republica.com.uy |date=2013-11-26 |accessdate=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 2006, perpetrators of rape could avoid punishment if, after the assault, they married the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = OECD Publishing | isbn = 978-92-64-07747-8 | title = Atlas of Gender and Development: How Social Norms Affect Gender Equality in non-OECD Countries | date = 2010-02-22 | page = 134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uruguay's law against domestic violence is ''Ley Nº 17.514'', enacted in 2002. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/leyes/AccesoTextoLey.asp?Ley=17514&amp;Anchor=# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201141657/http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/leyes/AccesoTextoLey.asp?Ley=17514&amp;Anchor=# |archive-date=2014-12-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abortion==
{{Main|Abortion in Uruguay}}
The abortion law of Uruguay is very liberal compared to the other Latin American countries.
In 2012, Uruguay  become the second country in Latin America, after Cuba, to legalize abortion on demand (during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-19986107|title=Uruguay legalises abortion|date=17 October 2012|website=Bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women in politics==
Unlike most other Latin American countries, women are not very present in politics. Uruguay has one of the lowest percentage of women in politics in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm |title=Women in Parliaments: World Classification |website=Ipu.org |date= |accessdate=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
