'''Albert Korubo Horsfall''' is a former Nigerian security chief. Albert Horsfall was born on 22 December 1941 at Buguma in present-day [[Rivers State]]. Horsfall was a police man and pioneer member of the [[National Security Organization]] (NSO). He was also the first [[Director general]] of the [[National Intelligence Agency (Nigeria)|National Intelligence Agency]] (NIA), the fifth Director general of the [[State Security Service (Nigeria)|State Security Service]] (SSS) and the pioneer [[Chairman]] of the Oil Minerals Producing Areas Development Commission (OMPADEC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Early life==
Albert Horsfall grew up in [[Degema, Rivers|Degema]], the administrative headquarters of Degema Division, one of the four divisions that made up the then Rivers Province. Horsfall's father was a successful merchant and he fathered 11 children; three of whom died. Albert left home at the age of seven to live with an uncle, Alex Horsfall, a top civil servant who lived at Degema Consulate. In 1947, Albert began his elementary schooling at Saint Batha School, Degema; he remembers walking from Degema Consulate, then an area populated by expatriates and Nigerian civil servants to his school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1951, Horsfall's schooling was disrupted by the death of his uncle Albert in the [[United Kingdom]] while taking in-service training. Albert had to return to his parents in Buguma, where he completed his primary education at Saint Michael's School, Emuohua. In 1959, he graduated from Christ School of Commerce [[Onitsha]], a school owned by his father's friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

At age 17 in 1962, he joined the [[Nigeria Police Force]] (NPF) for cadet training, but had to wait a year before this could begin. In 1965, he completed his training with the rank of [[Assistant Superintendent]] of Police (ASP). After a brief stint in Abakaliki, Horsfall was selected to join the [[Special Branch]]; at the time, the top three cadet graduates were selected for posting in either the A Department Force [[Headquarters]], the [[Criminal Investigation Department]] (CID), or the [[Special Branch]]. Soon after, Horsfall's boss and Special Branch commissioner, J. J. Sullivan, a retired [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Major]] recognized Horsfall's potential and deployed him to the [[Border control]] unit at [[Enugu]]. At the time, most Nigerian officers in the Special Branch were regarded by the expatriate officers as being more loyal than intelligent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

After Sullivan went on retirement leave, his Nigerian successor, T. H. Fagbola, who needed capable Nigerian officers to work with, assigned Horsfall back to headquarters in [[Lagos]]. Soon after, Horsfall attended an intelligence training course in the [[United States]]. While he was there in 1966, the [[Nigerian Civil War]] broke out. Horsfall, from the southern part of the country, returned to Nigeria on the side of the Federal Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2012-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, [[General]] [[Yakubu Gowon]]'s government had dissolved the country's four regions—Northern Region, [[Western Region, Nigeria|Western region]], [[Mid-Western Region, Nigeria|Mid-Western Region]], and the [[Eastern Region, Nigeria|Eastern Region]]—into 12 new states. This was calculated to fragment support for the seceding [[Biafra]]n state, which was mostly made up of the Eastern Region and the Mid-Western State. Horsfall's new [[Rivers State]] was formerly part of the Eastern Region, which now sided with the Federal Government in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2012-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Horsfall returned from the [[United States]], the Special Branch was severely short-staffed because of the exodus of easterners to seceding Biafra. This situation thrust a greater workload on him and might in part also account for his rapid rise in the service. Horsfall claims to have been embedded with the federal troops in [[Opobo]], [[Calabar]], [[Onne]], and [[Port Harcourt]]; he obviously would have held some advantage in this role because he was indigenous to the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1972, Horsfall married Henrietta. She was one of a couple of young women he had helped move to [[Lagos]] to continue their education during the civil war, and he knew her family. They have seven children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Horsfall remained with the Special Branch until 1976, when the department was excised from the NPF due to the creation of the [[National Security Organization]] (NSO). Horsfall, by then an [[Assistant Commissioner]] of Police joined the NSO as an officer under the first [[Director-General]], [[Colonel]] [[Abdullahi Mohammed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==National Security and Public Service==
Albert Horsfall claims he had always wanted to study law but had not been able to because of the demands of his job. His former bosses at the Special Branch and the NSO, M. D. Yussuf and Abdullahi Mohammed, had refused his applications for a study leave on the grounds he was too useful to their organizations to lose. He eventually left the NSO without official leave to study law in 1979. He was able to do this during the handover period between the outgoing director general, Colonel Abdullahi Mohammed, and the incoming director general, Umaru Shinkafi. Horsfall alleged that Shinkafi was sympathetic to his cause because Shinkafi himself, a former commissioner of police, had also taken leave of the Police to study law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Horsfall rose through the ranks of the NSO and eventually became the agency's second deputy director general, replacing Peter Odukwe after he was retired in 1984 during a purge of Shinkafi-era operatives by the new NSO director general, [[Ambassador]] Mohammed Lawal Rafindadi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

During his time as NSO deputy director general under Rafindadi, the agency was at its height of notoriety. Political repression was rife, arrest and detention without trial under the infamous Decree 2 (state security; detention of persons) and Decree 4 (press gag) was common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more notorious actions of the NSO during this period was the "[[Dikko Affair]]." The Dikko Affair was an attempt by the NSO and an Israeli collaborator to kidnap and repatriate second republic [[Transport]] [[Minister (government)|Minister]] [[Alhaji]] [[Umaru Dikko]] from his [[United Kingdom]] exile in 1984. The attempt failed and Nigeria suffered great diplomatic and economic repercussions, Horsfall has denied any involvement in the attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Babangida government launched investigations into NSO activities under Rafindadi, a Commission of Inquiry headed by former NSO Director General Umaru Shinkafi was also instituted. The security services were reorganised under Decree 19 of 1986, which led to the creation of three agencies: the [[State Security Service (Nigeria)|State Security Service]] (SSS), the [[National Intelligence Agency (Nigeria)|National Intelligence Agency]] (NIA), and the [[Defence Intelligence Agency (Nigeria)|Defence Intelligence Agency]] (DIA). The new government appointed Horsfall the first director general of the NIA. The NIA was responsible for Nigeria's foreign intelligence. Horsfall held this position until 1990, when he replace Alhaji Ismaila Gwarzo as the SSS' fifth director general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 10 October 1992, Horsfall left the SSS. From 1993, he was the first chairman of the Oil Mineral Producing Areas Development Commission (OMPADEC), a special purpose vehicle established by the government to bring about rapid development to the oil-producing [[Niger Delta]]; Horsfall is indigenous to the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Horsfall hired [[Goodluck Jonathan]], later a president of Nigeria, for OMPADEC, Jonathan's first public service job. On 22 February 1996, the OMPADEC Board was dissolved. Horsfall and the OMPADEC commissioners were removed based on claims by the Abacha government of widespread non-performance by contractors; the government claimed these contractors received mobilization money but failed to perform satisfactorily. This followed a prolonged campaign of calumny mounted by Dr. Junaid, the fiery advocate of northern supremacy who Horsfall forcefully removed from the OMPADEC Board in 1995.  In defence of his role and integrity, Horsfall claimed with authentic figures and statistics from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) that during his three years of service in OMPADEC, the Commission had received only 11.48 billion naira approximately $133,488,372 from government through monthly disbursements from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and that with this paltry sum he had performed a near miracle by dotting the whole of the nine oil-producing states with several on-going, medium and major projects and actually completed and commissioned 102 such projects and put them in use by the various communities throughout those oil-producing states.

Following the OMPADEC Commission's dissolution and the removal of Horsfall and his Board, five different investigation panels probed the allegations of corruption, uncompleted projects, and debts being owed by contractors to OMPADEC. These included a panel headed by the famous anti-corruption crusader Economics Professor Sam Aluko. None of these panels returned a verdict of corruption or improprieties on Horsfall. He returned to normal life, is enjoying his normal pension, and is a legal consultant. He has been chairman or a member of several federal constitutional review bodies, special adviser to President Obasanjo on Niger Delta Development, rehabilitation of militant and delinquent Rivers State youth, a member of the Nigerian National Constitutional Conference 2014, and a member of its special committee of 50 "wise men."

In 1997, he established his law firm, Horsfall and Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9825">'''Andrew Maguire''' is a British commodities trader and whistleblower. He presented evidence to United States regulators alleging that fraud had been committed, and that prices in the international gold and silver markets had been manipulated.  No regulatory or legal action has been taken as a result of his accusations.

== Background ==
On 29 March 2010 he was interviewed on the radio with [[Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee]] (GATA) board member [[Adrian Douglas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deepcapture.com/tag/commodity-futures-trading-commission/ "Manipulating Gold and Silver: A Criminal Naked Short Position that Could Wreck the Economy"] DeepCapture.com (April 2, 2010). Retrieved May 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He went public in April 2010 with assertions of market manipulation by [[JPMorgan Chase]] and [[HSBC]] of the gold and silver markets,&lt;ref name="nyp-whistle" /&gt; prompting a number of lawsuits,&lt;ref name="zh-amlatest" /&gt; including a [[class action lawsuit]].&lt;ref name="nalvensuit"&gt;[http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/opinion/Informant_Lawsuit.pdf Eric Nalven class action lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase and HSBC] (PDF) ''The New York Times'' (November 2, 2010). Retrieved May 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Maguire said "JPMorgan acts as an agent for the [[Federal Reserve]]; they act to halt the rise of gold and silver against the US dollar. JPMorgan is insulated from potential losses (on their [[Short (finance) | short ]] [[Position (finance)|positions]]) by the Fed and/or the U.S. taxpayer."  "No one at JPMorgan is familiar with Andrew Maguire," said Brian Marchiony, a JPMorgan spokesman. HSBC declined to comment.&lt;ref name="nyp-whistle" /&gt; Maguire was not a former [[Goldman Sachs]] trader as has often been reported although he did work briefly for J. Aron &amp; Co. which was acquired by Goldman Sachs in 1981.&lt;ref name="nyp-whistle"&gt;Michael Gray, [http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/metal_are_in_the_pits_2arTlGNbMK7mb1uJeVHb0O/0#ixzz0nZh8WLBC "Ex-Goldman trader blows whistle on silver and gold manipulation by JPMorgan, HSBC"] ''New York Post'' (April 11, 2010).

== Market Manipulation ==
In an interview with CBC aired in April 2013 Andrew Maguire described how mysterious traders, allegedly working for [[bullion banks]] [[JPMorgan Chase|JPMorgan]] and to a lesser extent [[HSBC]], waited for most of the major markets from Shanghai to London to be closed then concentrated their dealing on [[New York Mercantile Exchange|COMEX]]. He explained how traders were trading virtual or electronic silver anonymously using [[algorithmic trading|algorithmic trading systems]] "moving in and out of the futures markets in the blink of an eye. Four hundred contracts a second, each contract represents 5,000 troy ounces of silver." Maguire described a sudden and massive wave of selling of up to 45,000 contracts which drove the price of silver down. "Investors big and small try to cut their losses and sell as the price drops." People who had invested heavily lost everything. Then the mysterious seller just as suddenly started buying the electronic silver again. The price of silver soared as did profits for the seller. 45,000 contracts with a profit of $80,000 per contract totaled $3,600,000,000 for the mystery seller.&lt;ref name=CBCSecretGold2013&gt;

According to Maguire, the precious metals markets trade "pretty much in tandem", but because the silver market is so much smaller, it is harder to disguise one's activities and therefore easier to figure out who is behind a manipulative event.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;Eric King, [http://www.kingworldnews.com/kingworldnews/Broadcast/Entries/2010/3/30_Andrew_Maguire_%26_Adrian_Douglass.html Interview with Andrew Maguire and GATA board member Adrian Douglas] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615151821/http://www.kingworldnews.com/kingworldnews/Broadcast/Entries/2010/3/30_Andrew_Maguire_%26_Adrian_Douglass.html |date=2011-06-15 }} [[King World News]] (March 30, 2010). Retrieved May 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Bear Stearns]] and their short silver positions were acquired by JPMorgan, manipulative events in the silver market became more frequent. Maguire decided to inform the CFTC. He contacted commissioner [[Bart Chilton]], who had Eliud Ramirez, a senior investigator from the CFTC's enforcement division, get in touch with Maguire.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Williams, [http://www.mineweb.com/mineweb/view/mineweb/en/page72068?oid=101525&amp;sn=Detail "GATA's evidence of silver and gold manipulation at CFTC hearing"] Mineweb (March 26, 2010). Retrieved May 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Maguire explained the manipulations in great detail, both over the phone in an hour-long interview and afterward, in a series of e-mails with [[screen shot]]s.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt;

Maguire then predicted a manipulative event in the silver market and gave detailed information in an e-mail to the CFTC about what to expect, sending it on 3 February 2010, two days prior to the event. The event transpired exactly as Maguire predicted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/20100405/silver-prices-are-easy-manipulate-nia.htm Silver prices are easy to manipulate: NIA] ''International Business Times'' (April 5, 2010).

Retrieved May 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; While the event was taking place, Maguire sent e-mails in [[Real-time business intelligence|real time]], pointing out certain details because the CFTC enforcement seemed not to know what to look for or how to interpret the data.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt;

GATA chairman [[Bill Murphy (GATA chairman)|Bill Murphy]] gave a detailed account of Maguire's allegations to the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (CFTC), stating how "JP Morgan Chase signals to the market its intention to take down the precious metals. Traders recognize these signals and make money [[shorting]] the metals alongside JPMorgan. [He] explained how there are routine [[market manipulation]]s at the time of option expiry, non-farm payroll data releases, and COMEX contract rollover, as well as the ''ad hoc'' events."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestreet.com/story/10753883/2/silver-price-manipulation-investigation-focused-on-jpmorgan-chase.html Silver Price Manipulation Investigation Focused On JPMorgan Chase] TheStreet.com (May 11, 2010). Retrieved May 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ongoing criminal investigation==
The [[United States Department of Justice]]'s Antitrust Division and the CFTC are conducting civil and criminal probes stemming from a ''[[New York Post]]'' article concerning Maguire's allegations.&lt;ref name="nyp-fedprobe"&gt;Michael Gray, [http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/feds_probing_jpmorgan_trades_in_gZzMvWBqOJpB55M7Rh9vwM?sms_ss=email "Feds probing JPMorgan trades in silver pit"] ''New York Post'' (May 9, 2010). Retrieved May 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Following publication of the article, JPMorgan released a statement that they are not under investigation by the Department of Justice or the CFTC.&lt;ref name="nyp-fedprobe" /&gt; The CFTC has interviewed 32 people and reviewed 40,000 documents, but as of May 2011, no action has been taken.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;William D. Cohan, [http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/02/a-conspiracy-with-a-silver-lining/ "A Conspiracy With a Silver Lining"] ''The New York Times'' (March 2, 2011). Retrieved May 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 February 2011, in less than an hour, the price of silver fell $1.50 per ounce before recovering.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; Another London-based trader, Richard Guthrie, wrote to Chilton to complain about the event, asking “How many investors lost money and positions to the financial benefit of an elite few?”&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; Chilton believes violations of the law have taken place and wants to see prosecutions move forward,&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; but the five-member commission has yet to act.

'''Aro''' (known only by that name) was the [[List of most recent executions by jurisdiction|last person executed]] in [[Papua New Guinea]].&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2007/s2087787.htm "PNG urged to abandon death penalty"], Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 12 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, [[History of Papua New Guinea#The Territory of Papua and New Guinea|while Papua New Guinea was an Australian territory]], Aro, then a young man, walked into a hospital "carrying a baby and a blood-stained axe" and stated that he had killed his two wives.&lt;ref name=ABC /&gt;

He was convicted of willful murder, sentenced to death, and executed by [[hanging]] in November 1957.&lt;ref name=ABC /&gt;

There were no further executions. The death penalty was abolished in 1970, five years before Papua New Guinea's independence from Australia. It was reintroduced in 1991, but never applied.&lt;ref name=ABC /&gt;

'''Brahim Hemdani''' (born 15 March 1978 in [[Colombes]], [[Hauts-de-Seine]]) is a retired [[Algeria]]n professional [[football (soccer)|footballer]].

==Club career==
Hemdani started his career with [[AS Cannes|Cannes]], where he spent two seasons. He later transferred to [[RC Strasbourg]], spending three seasons with the club. He then joined [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]], which he helped reach the [[UEFA Cup]] final in [[2004 UEFA Cup Final|2004]].

Hemdani then joined Rangers on 14 June 2005 on a [[Bosman transfer]] and signed a four-year contract.&lt;ref name="Rangers transfer"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/4090958.stm | publisher=BBC Sport website | title=Rangers clinch deal for Hemdani | date=14 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered from injury problems during his first season, waiting until late October to make his debut against [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]].&lt;ref name="Dundee Utd 0-0 Rangers "&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/4338832.stm | publisher=BBC Sport website | title=Dundee Utd 0-0 Rangers | date=16 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemdani was a regular in the side from then on and helped the club reach the last 16 of the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] for the first time in their history. The season ended with the side finishing third in the league and trophyless. The following summer, [[Paul Le Guen]] took over as manager and Hemdani began the [[2006–07 in Scottish football|2006–07]] season in [[midfielder|midfield]] but was moved to the [[defender (football)|centre of defence]].

Hemdani scored his first goal for Rangers midway through that season, a shot from outside the box to equalise in the 88th minute of an [[Old Firm]] game on 17 December 2006.&lt;ref name="Rangers 1-1 Celtic"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/6177705.stm | publisher=BBC Sport| title=Rangers 1-1 Celtic | date=17 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second goal came in similar circumstances in a [[UEFA Cup 2006-07|UEFA Cup]] match in March 2007, against [[CA Osasuna]], scoring to equalise in injury time.&lt;ref name="Rangers 1-1 Osasuna "&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/6415057.stm | publisher=BBC Sport| title=Rangers 1-1 Osasuna | date=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 April 2007, Hemdani was named Rangers Player of the Year at an award ceremony, voted for by the club's fans.&lt;ref name="Player of the Year"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rangers.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Headlines/0,,5~1011888,00.html |title=Hemdani Named Player Of The Year |publisher=Rangers official website |date=16 April 2007 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his 100th appearance for [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] on 13 March 2008 in a [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] match against [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]],&lt;ref name="Hemdani 100"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7285148.stm|title=W Bremen 1-0 Rangers (agg 1-2) |publisher=BBC Sport|date=13 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the club went on to reach [[2008 UEFA Cup Final|the final that season]], which Hemdani played the full 90 minutes of. However, this turned out to be his last match for Rangers as the [[Rangers F.C. season 2008-09|2008-09 season]] saw Hemdani frozen out of the first team. He left on 1 June 2009 having made a total of 108 appearances and scoring twice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/8077300.stm|title=Weir poised for new Rangers deal |date=1 June 2009|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Hemdani declined the chance to be included as part of the Algeria national squad on several occasions in the past.&lt;ref name="Players reject Algeria"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/3570178.stm| title=Players reject Algeria

| publisher=Daily Record| date=8 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemdani made his [[Algeria national football team|Algerian]] debut in a [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification|2010 World Cup qualifier]] against [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] on 31 May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/7429606.stm "Senegal 1-0 Algeria"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419122641/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/7429606.stm |date=19 April 2012 }} BBC Sport website (31 May 200)8&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early activism ==

In 1960, Wittman entered [[Swarthmore College]] where he became a student activist. Wittman spent summers doing civil rights work in the South, and joined the national council of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS).  In 1966, after becoming disillusioned with homophobia in the [[New Left]], Wittman left SDS.  Wittman married Mimi Feingold the same year.&lt;ref name="who?" /&gt;

In 1967, Wittman moved to San Francisco with Feingold where they lived with other activists in an anti-draft commune. Wittman turned in his draft card to the Oakland Induction Center in October 1967 during Stop the Draft Week.

== Gay activism ==

Wittman, while self-identified as gay since the age of 14, remained closeted until coming out in the late 1960s in an article, "Waves of Resistance," published in the November, 1968 issue of the antiwar magazine, ''[[Liberation (magazine)|Liberation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wittman, Carl. [https://books.google.com/books?id=dLYqAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22waves+of+resistance%22+wittman&amp;dq=%22waves+of+resistance%22+wittman&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Hnw4Tu_AA6fX0QG93uzOAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwCA ''Waves of Resistance''] ''Synergy Magazine'' Vol 13-30,  [[San Francisco Public Library]].

|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Wittman wrote Refugees from Amerika: A Gay Manifesto published by The Red Butterfly cell of the [[Gay Liberation Front]] January, 1970.&lt;ref name="A Gay Manifesto" /&gt; It is considered one of the most influential gay liberation writings of the 1970s.

In 1971, Wittman moved to Wolf Creek, Oregon with his then-partner, Stevens McClave. Two years later, he began a long-term relationship with a fellow war resister, Allan Troxler, a conscientious objector.

In the early 1980s, Wittman created the North Carolina Lesbian and Gay Health Project (LGHP) with David Jolly, Timmer McBride, and Aida Wakil to address the health needs of sexual minorities in that state.&lt;ref&gt;Lekus, Ian K.

== Instrumental figure in country dance ==

"Carl Wittman, led the development in the United States of a movement diametrically opposed to Kennedy's couples policy: "gender-free" dance in which there were no gendered dance roles" (page 205, of Walkowitz' City Folk)

Carl Whittman, a certified RSCDS (Royal Scottish Country Dance Society) instructor, started teaching Scottish country dancing in the San Francisco area about 1970. Carl was very involved in the gay political movements of that era. In the early 1970s, Carl left San Francisco and traveled up the coast to the artist's community of Wolf Creek, Oregon and eventually settled in Golden, Oregon with his partner, Allan Troxler. Carl became involved in the newly emerging [[intentional community|intentional communities]] of gay men and lesbians in that area. He started a local community dance in his barn in Golden, Oregon, where he pulled in people from these intentional communities, as well as families and friends from around the area. His dancing community ended up being a mixture of amilies, gay men, lesbians and friends. Carl taught English and Scottish country dancing, at first, in the tradition and style in which he had learned, identifying dancers by their gender role and using gender language. He allowed anyone to dance with whomever they wished and in any role they chose, but he used the conventional gender terminology to identify these roles. Sometime thereafter, Alan challenged Carl to change this convention, and come up with something that was more appropriate for their community. Carl changed his role identification system to "Reds" and "Greens" (Reds identifying the traditional gent's position and Greens to identify the lady's position). He went on to further develop this to a method defined as "Left File" and "Right File" dancers (the left file identifying the traditional gent's role and the right file identifying the traditional ladies position). Over time, Carl started traveling around Oregon, starting other dance communities, teaching this style of English and Scottish Country Dancing. Carl developed another tradition during this time, that being of how to line up for each dance. He advocated that everyone come to the set individually and fill in the next available space. This method ensures that everyone will have someone to dance with and addressed the sometimes-awkward practice of asking someone to dance, particularly with folks new to the dance. This method has also been adopted by the Boston gender-free English country dance community with an additional note that if you desire to dance with a particular partner, wait until all spaces in the set are filled above you before coming to the set. Carl was also the dance leader and principal choreographer for the Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, Oregon in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;http://lcfd.org/Articles/GFManual/GF-Manual.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Jones Soong''' ({{zh|t=宋嘉樹|p=Sòng Jiāshù}}; February 1863 – May 3, 1918), [[courtesy name]] Yaoru (耀如 ''Yàorú'', hence his alternate name: '''Soong Yao-ju'''), was a Chinese businessman who first achieved prominence as a [[Methodist]] missionary in [[Shanghai]]. He was a close friend of [[Sun Yat-sen]] and a key player in the events that led to the [[Xinhai Revolution]] in 1911.  His children became some of the most prominent people in the history of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] and the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]].

==Early life==
Charlie Soong was born as '''Han Jiaozhun''' (韓教準) in the western suburbs of [[Wenchang|Wenchang City]] in Hainan province as the third son of Han Hongyi (韓鴻翼 ''Hán Hóngyì'') on October 17, 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=宋氏家族奠基人宋耀如:曾愤怒庆龄嫁孙中山(图)|url=http://www.chinanews.com/cul/2011/10-17/3394246.shtml#nextpage|website=chinanews.com|publisher=China News Service|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a [[Wenchang]] [[Hainan]] native, whose ancestors were the [[Hakka people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/news.xinhuanet.com/tw/2010-10/17/c_12667798.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231624/http://big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/news.xinhuanet.com/tw/2010-10/17/c_12667798.htm|archive-date=2016-03-03|dead-url=yes|title=Secret History: The Soong Sisters real surname|publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency]]|language=Chinese|date=17 October 2010|accessdate=October 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager, he sailed to Boston, Massachusetts to work for an uncle at his shop in the city's Chinatown district. After working for his uncle for a short time, he acquired a job working for the U.S. Revenue Marine (the forerunner of the U.S. Coast Guard) on board the USS ''Albert Gallatin'' under the command of Captain Eric Gabrielson. After approximately a year of service, Gabrielson was transferred to Wilmington, North Carolina. Soong followed Gabrielson to North Carolina not long afterwards to work on the USS ''Schuyler Colfax''. After arriving in Wilmington, Soong eventually converted to the [[Christian]] faith and was baptized Charles Jones Soon—Charlie Soon was probably an [[anglicized]] version of his given name Jiaozhun (Chiao-Chun), but there is more confusion about  where he got his middle name Jones. It was not until years later that he changed his name to Soong.&lt;ref&gt;Seagrave, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;
'''

Soon after Soong's arrival, the Fifth Street Methodist Church in Wilmington, led by the Rev. Thomas Ricaud, began making preparations to train and educate Soong for the purpose of sending him back to China to work as a Christian missionary. These plans included the Durham, North Carolina philanthropist, fellow Methodist, and tobacco magnate  [[Julian S. Carr]] (of "Bull Durham tobacco" fame), who volunteered to serve as Soong's benefactor and sponsor. Carr had been a great contributor to Trinity College (now [[Duke University]]), and was subsequently able to get his Chinese protégé into the school in 1880, even though he met none of the qualifications for entry to university. The prospect of having a native Chinese as a missionary in China thrilled some of the ministers there. They set him to mastering the English language and studying the [[Bible]]. One year later, Soong transferred to [[Vanderbilt University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85042052/1882-09-02/ed-1/seq-2/#date1=1789&amp;sort=date&amp;rows=20&amp;words=Charlie+Soon&amp;searchType=basic&amp;sequence=0&amp;index=3&amp;state=North+Carolina&amp;date2=1897&amp;proxtext=%22charlie+soon%22&amp;y=8&amp;x=16&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1|title=State News|last=|first=|date=September 2, 1882|work=Orange County Observer|access-date=February 1, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from which he received a degree in [[theology]] in 1885. In 1886, he was sent to Shanghai on a [[Christian mission]] after spending almost half of his life to that point abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Seagrave, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

==From missionary to revolutionary==
Soong's career as a missionary proved to be a short one. In the late 1880s, Charlie had begun to tire of the mission and felt that he could do more for his people if he was not bound to the restrictions and methods that came with working for the church. When he founded his first business—a small printing establishment—he seemingly found it appropriate to resign from preaching. Instead, another society required his time and loyalty. Around this time, Charlie had secretly been initiated into Shanghai's thriving [[Anti-Qing sentiment|anti-Manchu]] resistance movement, more specifically an organization that went by the name of Hung P’ang, or the [[Triad (underground society)#History|Red Gang]]. This organization had its roots in the movements to reinstate the [[Ming dynasty]] in the latter part of the 17th century, but had since transformed into a [[republicanism|republican]] revolutionary force.&lt;ref&gt;Seagrave, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, Charlie Soong made the arguably most important connection in his life when he met [[Sun Yat-Sen]] at a [[Sunday service]] in a Methodist church in Shanghai. The two men were kindred spirits of sorts, sharing their Western education, region of birth, [[dialect]], the Christian faith and a burning ambition and craving for change in China. Perhaps most importantly, they were both members of entwined anti-Manchu [[Triad (underground societies)|triads]]. They quickly became good friends and Charlie started funding Sun's campaigns.  A political body was set up, and the plan was to connect the triads into a network of opposition. When their first attempt at uprising failed in 1895, Sun fled China, and would not come back until sixteen years later. Charlie had remained incognito during the resistance and deemed it safe to remain in Shanghai, as his name had not yet been connected to the failed coup. In the coming years, Charlie Soong funded Sun Yat-Sen's travels in search of support and major financial backing.&lt;ref&gt;Seagrave, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The founding of the Soong family==
In the years leading up to the revolution in 1911, Charlie Soong started a family in Shanghai with his wife [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/116480441 Ni Kwei-Tseng] (倪桂珍 ''Ní Guìzhēn''). The couple had their first child in 1890&amp;mdash;a girl whom they named [[Soong Ai-ling]]. Their next daughter, [[Soong Ching-ling]] was born in 1893, followed by their first son [[T. V. Soong]] (Soong Tse Ven) a year later. Their last daughter, [[Soong Mei-ling]] came in 1897 and was followed by the brothers [https://www.geni.com/people/Tse-Liang-Soong-%E5%AE%8B%E5%AD%90%E8%89%AF/6000000012826793574 T.L. Soong] (Soong Tse Liang, 宋子良 ''Sòng Zǐliáng'') and [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/19075088 T.A. Soong] (Soong Tse An, 宋子安 ''Sòng Zǐ'ān'').&lt;ref&gt;Seagrave, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlie intended all of his children to be educated in the United States. Ai-Ling, at the early age of thirteen, was the first to go, becoming a special student at [[Wesleyan College]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. All three sisters attended Wesleyan, with Ching-Ling and May-Ling moving to Georgia in 1907. Ai-Ling graduated in 1909, and moved back to China. Charlie installed her as Sun Yat-Sen's secretary, in charge of handling his correspondence and of [[Code (cryptography)|decoding]] messages to him from the republicans. A few years later in 1911, Sun Yat-Sen was successful in bringing about the [[Xinhai Revolution]], and the [[Qing Dynasty]] fell to be replaced by the short-lived [[Sun Yat-sen#Republic of China|presidency of Sun Yat-Sen]].&lt;ref&gt;Seagrave, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, Ching-Ling returned to China, just in time to see the republic collapse under the leadership of [[Yuan Shikai]]. The connection between Charlie Soong and [[Sun Yat-Sen]] was now widely known, and Charlie felt that his family would not be safe in China. In 1913, they fled with [[Sun Yat-Sen]] to [[Tokyo]]. They remained there until 1916, when Charlie deemed the situation in Shanghai to be safe enough to return.&lt;ref&gt;Seagrave, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dispute with Sun Yat-Sen==
While in Tokyo, [[Soong Ai-ling]] had married [[H. H. Kung]], a wealthy banker, and it was no longer suitable for her to work as [[Sun Yat-Sen|Sun Yat-Sen's]] secretary. Instead, [[Soong Ching-ling]] took the job in 1914 while in Tokyo. The relationship between Ching-ling and Sun soon turned romantic, and when Charlie Soong moved his family back to Shanghai in 1916, they secretly kept in touch. It was however problematic to pursue this relationship, as Sun was already married. Thus, Charlie was outraged when Ching-ling asked to go back to Japan to join Sun. When she then defied him and escaped on a boat to Tokyo in the middle of the night, it was enough for Charlie to break all ties with Sun and disown his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Seagrave, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Charlie Soong died on May 4, 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Rev. Charles Soong Dies in Shanghai|last=|first=|date=July 3, 1918|work=News and Observer|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cause was Bright's disease, known today as chronic nephritis (a type of kidney disease).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haag|pages=178, 197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither [[Sun Yat-Sen]] nor the rest of the [[Kuomintang]] showed any public mourning, as the clash over Ching-Ling was still fresh in the public memory.&lt;ref&gt;Seagrave, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jesus}}
The '''Christ myth theory''' (also known as the '''Jesus myth theory''', '''Jesus mythicism''', or '''Jesus ahistoricity theory'''){{sfnp|Lataster|2015a|ps=none}} is "the view that the person known as [[Jesus Christ|Jesus of Nazareth]] had no historical existence."{{sfnp|Gullotta|2017|p=310}} Alternatively, in terms given by [[Bart D. Ehrman|Bart Ehrman]] as per his criticism of mythicism,{{sfnp|Lataster|2016|ps=none}} "the historical Jesus did not exist. Or if he did, he had virtually nothing to do with the [[Origins of Christianity|founding of Christianity]]."{{refn|group=q|name="Ehrman_def"}}

According to mythicists, the accounts of Jesus are mostly, or completely, of a mythical nature; and if there was a historical Jesus, close to nothing can be known about him. Most Christ mythicists follow a threefold argument: they question the reliability of the [[Pauline epistles]] and the [[Gospel]]s regarding the historicity of Jesus; they note the lack of information on Jesus in non-Christian sources from the first and early second century; and they argue that early Christianity was [[Religious syncretism|syncretistic]] and mythological from the beginning, as reflected in both the Pauline epistles and the gospels. Therefore, Christianity was not founded on the shared memories of a man, but rather a shared [[mytheme]].

The Christ myth theory is a [[fringe theory]], supported by few [[Academic tenure|tenured]] or [[emeritus]] specialists in [[biblical criticism]] or cognate disciplines.{{sfnp|Van Voorst|2003|pp=658, 660}}{{sfnp|Burridge|Gould|2004|p=34}}&lt;ref name="Ehrman Blog"/&gt;{{refn|group=q|name="Gullotta.2017.fringe"}} It deviates from the [[Historical Jesus|mainstream historical view]], which is that while the gospels include many legendary elements, these are religious elaborations added to the accounts of a historical Jesus who was [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucified]] in the 1st-century Roman province of [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]].{{Sfnp|Ehrman|2012|ps=none}}{{Sfnp|Stanton|2002|pp=143ff}}

== Jesus and the origins of Christianity ==
{{See also|Jesus in Christianity|Historicity of Jesus|Sources for the historicity of Jesus|Historical Jesus|Quest for the historical Jesus|Portraits of the historical Jesus}}

The [[origins of Christianity|origins]] and rapid rise of Christianity, as well as the historical Jesus and the [[historicity of Jesus]], are a matter of longstanding debate in theological and historical research. While Christianity may have started with an early nucleus of followers of Jesus,{{refn|group=q|name="Dunn.2003.174"}} within a few years after the presumed death of Jesus in {{circa|AD 33}}, at the time [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] started preaching, a number of "Jesus-movements" seem to have been in existence, which propagated divergent interpretations of Jesus' teachings.{{sfnp|Mack|1995|ps=none}}{{sfnmp|1a1=King|1y=2008|1p=70|2a1=Behr|2y=2013|2pp=5–6}} A central question is how these communities developed and what their original convictions were,{{sfnp|Mack|1995|ps=none}}{{sfnp|King|2011|ps=none}} as a wide range of beliefs and ideas can be found in [[early Christianity]], including [[adoptionism]] and [[docetism]],{{refn|group=q|name="Ehrman.2015"}} and also [[gnosticism|Gnostic traditions]] which used Christian imagery,{{refn|group=q|name="mix.Pagels.1975.1979.Ehrman.2005"}} which were all deemed [[Heresy in Christianity|heretical]] by [[proto-orthodox Christianity]].{{sfnp|Ehrman|2003|ps=none}}{{refn|group=q|name="Green.2008.239"}}

Mainstream scholarship views Jesus as a real person who was subsequently [[Divinization (Christian)|deified]],{{sfnp|Ehrman|2012|ps=none}}{{sfnp|Stanton|2002|pp=143ff}} whereas traditional Christian theology and dogmas view Jesus as the incarnation of God/Christ on earth. Mythicists take yet another approach, presuming a widespread set of Jewish ideas on personified aspects of God, which were subsequently historicised when proto-Christianity spread among non-Jewish converts.

=== Mainstream historical view ===
{{See also|Textual criticism|Historical criticism|Biblical hermeneutics|Quest for the historical Jesus}}

Jesus is being studied by a number of scholarly disciplines,{{efn-lr|name=Biblical.studies}} using a variety of textual critical methods.{{efn-lr|[[Quest for the historical Jesus|Criteria being used]] to determine whether Biblical passages can be attributed to Jesus include [[criterion of multiple attestation|multiple attestation]], [[criterion of dissimilarity|dissimilarity]], [[criterion of embarrassment|embarrassment]], historical plausibility, rejection and execution, and congruence.}} These critical methods, and the [[quest for the historical Jesus]], have led to a [[demythologization]] of Jesus, and the mainstream historical view is that while the gospels include mythical or legendary elements, these are religious interpretations of the life and death of a historical Jesus who did live in 1st-century Roman Palestine.{{sfnp|Ehrman|2012|ps=none}}{{sfnp|Ehrman|2014|ps=none}}{{sfnp|Stanton|2002|pp=143ff}}{{efn-lr|name="Greater.Judea"}} While scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the Biblical accounts of Jesus,{{sfnp|Powell|2013|p=168}} the baptism and the crucifixion are two events in the life of Jesus which are subject to "almost universal assent".{{efn-lr|name="Jesus.Biography"}} According to historian [[Alanna Nobbs]],
{{quote|While historical and theological debates remain about the actions and significance of this figure, his fame as a teacher, and his crucifixion under the Roman prefect [[Pontius Pilate]], may be described as historically certain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alanna Nobbs]] and Edwin Judge ap. {{cite web|last=Dickson|first=John|authorlink=John Dickson (author)|title=Best of 2012: The irreligious assault on the historicity of Jesus |url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2012/12/24/3660194.htm |website=ABC Religion and Ethics|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2 May 2018|language=en-AU|date=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

New Testament scholar [[Bart D. Ehrman]] states that Jesus "certainly existed, as virtually every competent scholar of antiquity, Christian or non-Christian, agrees,"{{sfnp|Ehrman|1999|p=248}}{{sfnp|Ehrman|2011|p=285}} and also states that the existence of Jesus and his crucifixion by the Romans is attested to by a wide range of sources including [[Josephus]] and [[Tacitus]].{{sfnp|Ehrman|1999|p=248}}

While there is widespread scholarly agreement on the existence of Jesus as a historical figure, the [[Portraits of the historical Jesus|portraits of Jesus]] have often differed from each other and from the image portrayed in the gospel accounts.{{sfnp|Ehrman|2011|p=285}}{{sfnp|Theissen|Winter|2002|p=5}}{{sfnp|Cross|Livingstone|2005|ps=none}}{{efn-lr|According to Lataster, "the only thing New Testament scholars seem to agree on is Jesus' historical existence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lataster|first=Raphael|title=Did historical Jesus really exist? The evidence just doesn't add up.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/12/18/did-historical-jesus-exist-the-traditional-evidence-doesnt-hold-up/|newspaper=The Washington Post|publisher=[[The Washington Post|WP Company LLC]]|accessdate=May 2, 2018|date=December 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Traditional and modern Christian views===
{{See also|Christology|Christian apologetics|Christian fundamentalism|Biblical literalism|Evangelicalism}}

Traditional [[Christian theology]] and [[dogma]]s view Jesus as the incarnation of God/Christ on earth and as the [[Messiah]], whose death was a sacrifice that procured [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] for all who believe Jesus to be the [[Christ]]. According to Christian traditions, the Gospels and the Pauline epistles are inspired writings,{{sfnp|Stout|2011|ps=none}} which tell us in a reliable way about the birth and the life of Jesus, his ministry and sayings, and his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] and resurrection, according to God's plan.{{efn-lr|name=Christian_fundamentalists}}

[[Liberal theology]], following the demythologization of Jesus, emphasises his earthly life as an exemplary model to be followed by Christians.{{efn-lr|name=Christian_Liberalism}}

=== Christ myth theorists ===
Most mythicists, like mainstream scholarship, note that Christianity developed within [[Hellenistic Judaism]], which was influenced by [[Hellenization#Hellenistic period|Hellenism]]. Early Christianity, and the accounts of Jesus are to be understood in this context. Departing from mainstream scholarship,  mythicists argue that the accounts of Jesus are mostly, or completely, of a mythical nature, questioning the mainstream [[paradigm]] of a historical Jesus in the beginning of the 1st century who was deified.

Carrier and other mythicists are critical of the conclusions and presuppositions of historicity proponents, questioning the value of consensus as a criterion for the historicity of Jesus.{{refn|group=q|name="conclusions_presuppositions"}}{{refn|group=q|name="Price.2009.61"}}{{refn|group=q|name="Carrier.2012.21"}}

Some moderate authors, most notably Wells, have argued that there may have been a historical Jesus, but that this historical Jesus was fused with another Jesus-tradition, namely the mythological Christ of Paul.{{sfnp|Price|1999|ps=none}}{{sfnp|Thompson|Verenna|2012|ps=none}}{{refn|group=q|name="Robertson"}} Others, most notably the early Wells and [[Alvar Ellegård]], have argued that Paul's Jesus may have lived far earlier, in a dimly remembered remote past.{{refn|group=q|name="mix.Price.2009.2011.Doherty.2012"}}

The most radical mythicists hold, in terms given by Price, the "Jesus [[atheism]]" viewpoint, that is, there never was a historical Jesus, only a mythological character, and the [[mytheme]] of his incarnation, death, and exaltation. This character developed out of a [[Religious syncretism|syncretistic fusion]] of Jewish, Hellenistic and Middle Eastern religious thought; was put forward by Paul; and historicised in the Gospels, which are also syncretistic. Notable "atheists" are Paul-Louis Couchoud, Earl Doherty, Thomas L. Brodie, and Richard Carrier.{{refn|group=q|name="Carrier 2014 p614–616"}}

Some other authors argue for the Jesus [[agnosticism]] viewpoint. That is, we cannot conclude if there was a historical Jesus. And if there was a historical Jesus, close to nothing can be known about him. Notable "agnosticists" are Robert Price, Thomas L. Thompson, and Raphael Lataster.{{sfnp|Lataster|2014|loc=§.&amp;nbsp;[https://openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au/index.php/LA/article/view/8328/8466 Raphael Lataster’s Jesus Agnosticism]}}{{refn|group=q|name="mix.agnosticism.atheism"}}{{refn|group=q|name="Eddy.Boyd.2007.137"}}

While proponents like [[Earl Doherty]], Price, and Carrier, are concerned with the origins of Christianity and the genesis of the Christ-figure, the perception of and debate about the Christ myth theory has increasingly turned to the simpler question whether Jesus existed or not{{refn|group=q|name="existence.simplification"}} and consequently with some scholars proposing a more moderate position.{{refn|group=q|name="Davies.2012.evidence"}}

== Arguments ==
According to New Testament scholar [[Robert E. Van Voorst|Robert Van Voorst]], most Christ mythicists follow a threefold argument: they question the reliability of the Pauline epistles and the Gospels regarding the historicity of Jesus;{{refn|group=q|name="Voorst.2000.9.new-testament"}} they note the lack of information on Jesus in non-Christian sources from the first and early second century;{{refn|group=q|name="Voorst.2000.9.documentation"}} and they argue that early Christianity was syncretistic and mythological from the beginning.{{refn|group=q|name="Voorst.2000.9.syncretism"}}

===Overview of main arguments===
Most Christ mythicists argue that the evidence for the existence of a historical Jesus Christ is weak at best,{{refn|group=q|name="Evans.2008.25"}} pointing at a series of perceived peculiarities in the sources which they regard as untrustworthy for a historical account.{{refn|group=q|name="mix.Price.2011.36.Doherty.1999.1997"}} Early Christian and other sources lack biographical information on Jesus,{{refn|group=q|name="Bethune.2016"}} the so-called argument from silence.{{sfnp|Doherty|1995a|ps=none}}{{refn|group=q|name="argument.from.silence"}} Instead, the Christ of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]{{sfnp|Doherty|1995a|ps=none}}{{refn|group=q|name="mix.Lataster.2015.Price.2009"}}{{efn-lr|name="Paul.Christology"}} and the Jesus of the Gospels are of a [[Mythology|mythical]] and [[Allegory|allegorical]] nature.{{sfnp|Doherty|1995a|ps=none}}{{refn|group=q|name="Price.2006.66"}}{{efn-lr|name="Positive.argument"}} They further argue that the Gospels are a composite of various strands of thought,{{sfnp|Doherty|1995d|ps=none}}{{sfnp|Price|2000|p=86}} relying on Jewish writings,{{refn|group=q|name="mix.Price.2011.36.Doherty.1999.1997"}} and note the similarities of early Christianity and the Christ figure with the [[mystery religions]] of the [[Greco-Roman world]].{{refn|group=q|name="Eddy.Boyd.2007.34"}}
* &lt;!-- PAUL --&gt; '''Paul's Jesus is a celestial being, not a historical person, or may have lived in a dim past''' – the [[Pauline epistles]] are older than the gospels but, aside from a few passages which may have been [[Christian interpolation|interpolations]], make no reference to a historical Jesus who lived in the flesh on Earth,{{refn|group=q|name="Lataster.2016.191"}} nor do they cite any sayings from Jesus. There is a complete absence of any detailed biographical information such as might be expected if Jesus had been a contemporary of Paul;{{refn|group=q|name="Wells.1982.22"}}{{refn|group=q|name="Eddy2007_p202"}} instead, Paul refers to Jesus as an exalted being. Therefore, Paul is probably writing about either a mythical [[entity]],{{refn|group=q|name="mix.Wells.1999.1999.2009"}} a celestial deity,{{refn|group=q|name="Carrier.2014.53"}} "a savior figure patterned after similar figures within ancient mystery religions"{{refn|group=q|name="Eddy2007_p202"}}{{refn|group=q|name="Price2003_p350"}} named Jesus;{{refn|group=q|name="mix.Couchoud.1939.33.Price.2009.64"}}{{Refn|name="Price.2003.Name"}}{{refn|group=q|name="Carrier.Zechariah.6"}} or a historical person who may have lived in a dim past, long before the beginnings of the [[Common Era]].
* &lt;!-- GOSPELS --&gt; '''The Gospels are not historical records''' – although the Gospels seem to present an historical framework, they are not historical records, but [[Theology|theological]] writings,{{refn|group=q|name="Van.Voorst.2000.13"}}{{refn|group=q|name="Thompson.2009.p3"}} which are based on a variety of sources and influences, including [[Old Testament]] writings,{{Refn|name="Price.scripture"}}{{sfnp|Thompson|2012}} Greek Stoic philosophy and the [[Exegesis|exegetical]] methods of [[Philo]].{{refn|group=q|name="Lataster.2014.19"}}{{efn-lr|name="Philo.exegesis"}} The [[genre]] of the Gospels are myth or legendary fiction{{refn|group=q|name="Eddy_Boyd2007_p314-315"}}{{refn|group=q|name="Eddy_Boyd2007_p137-138"}}{{efn-lr|name="Mythotype"}} which have imposed "a fictitious historical narrative" on a "mythical cosmic savior figure"{{refn|group=q|name="Eddy_Boyd_2007"}}{{refn|group=q|name="Voorst.2000.9.syncretism"}} by weaving together various pseudo-historical Jesus traditions,{{refn|group=q|name="Wells2013_p16"}}{{sfnp|Doherty|1995d|ps=none}}{{efn-lr|name="Jesus.traditions"}} most notably the "[[supernatural]] personage" of Paul's epistles{{sfnp|Doherty|1995d|ps=none}} and "ideas very important in the Jewish [[Wisdom literature]]".{{sfnp|Doherty|1995d|ps=none}}{{refn|group=q|name="Wells2013_p16"}}
* &lt;!-- NO INDEPENDENT EYEWITNESS --&gt; '''No independent eyewitness accounts''' – No independent eyewitness accounts survive, in spite of the fact that many authors were writing at that time.{{refn|group=q|name="Van.Voorst.2000.69"}}{{refn|group=q|name="Eddy.Boyd.2007.163"}} Early second-century Roman accounts contain very little evidence{{refn|group=q|name="Voorst.2000.9.documentation"}}{{refn|group=q|name="Eddy.Boyd.2007.32"}} and may depend on Christian sources.{{refn|group=q|name="Voorst2000_p13"}}{{refn|group=q|name="Lataster2015_p68"}}
* &lt;!-- DIVERSITY AND PARALLELS --&gt; '''Diversity in early Christianity, and parallels with other religions''' – Early Christianity was widely diverse and [[religious syncretism|syncretistic]], sharing common philosophical and religious ideas with other religions of the time.{{sfnp|Doherty|1995c|ps=none}}{{sfnp|Doherty|1995a|ps=none}} Its origins cannot be traced to a single founding group, but must have been rooted in a wider religious movement. It arose in the Greco-Roman world of the first and second century AD, synthesizing [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek]] and [[Jewish philosophy#Ancient Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosophy]] of the [[Second Temple period]].{{refn|group=q|name="Voorst.2000.9.syncretism"}}{{sfnp|Doherty|1995c|ps=none}} Parallels with other religions include the ideas of personified aspects of God,{{efn-lr|name="Personification"}} proto-Gnostic ideas, and [[salvation]] figures featured in [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religions]], which were often (but not always) a [[dying-and-rising god]].{{refn|group=q|name="mix.Bromiley.1982"}}{{refn|group=q|name="Price.2000.86.88.91"}}{{efn-lr|name="Dying.god"}}

{{Main|Pauline epistles|Authorship of the Pauline epistles}}

====Dating====

=====Mainstream view=====
The seven undisputed Pauline epistles considered by scholarly consensus to be [[Authorship of the Pauline epistles|genuine epistles]] are generally dated to AD 50–60 (i.e. approximately twenty to thirty years after the generally accepted time period for the death of Jesus around AD 30–36) and are the earliest surviving Christian texts that may include information about Jesus.{{sfnp|Tuckett|2001|ps=none}}{{refn|group=q|name="Johnson.2010.241"}}{{refn|group=q|name="mix.Miller.2017.1.Carrier.2016"}}

=====Mythicist views=====
Some mythicists have questioned the early dating of the epistles, raising the possibility that they represent a later, more developed strand of early Christian thought.

Theologian [[Willem Christiaan van Manen]] of the Dutch school of [[radical criticism]] noted various anachronisms in the Pauline Epistles. Van Manen claimed that they could not have been written in their final form earlier than the 2nd century. He also noted that the [[Marcionism|Marcionite school]] was the first to publish the epistles, and that [[Marcion]] ({{circa|85}} – {{circa|160}}) used them as justification for his gnostic and docetic views that Jesus' incarnation was not in a physical body. Van Manen also studied Marcion's version of [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] in contrast to the canonical version, and argued that the canonical version was a later revision which de-emphasized the Gnostic aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Detering|first1=Hermann|title=The Dutch Radical Approach to the Pauline Epistles|journal=Journal of Higher Criticism|date=1996|volume=3|issue=2|pages=163–193|url=https://depts.drew.edu/jhc/detering.html|accessdate=September 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Price wrote that "the historical Jesus problem replicates itself in the case of Paul," and that the epistles have the same limitations as the Gospels as historical evidence. Price sees the epistles as a compilation of fragments (possibly with a Gnostic core),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Price|first1=Richard M.|title=The Amazing Colossal Apostle |date=2012 |publisher=Signature Books |location=Salt Lake City |isbn=978-1-56085-216-2|page=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contends that Marcion was responsible for much of the Pauline corpus or even wrote the letters himself, while criticizing the [[Circumstantial ad hominem|circumstantial ''ad hominem'' fallacy]] of fellow Christ myth theorists holding the mid-first-century dating of the epistles (e.g. Galatians is conventionally dated {{circa|AD 53}}){{efn-lr|name=Ludemann}} for their own apologetical reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Price|first=Robert M.|authorlink=Robert M.

Modern biblical scholarship notes that "Paul has relatively little to say on the biographical information of Jesus," viewing Jesus as "a recent contemporary."{{sfnp|Eddy|Boyd|2007|p=202}}{{sfnp|Stout|2011|p=64}} Bishop and historian [[Paul Barnett (bishop)|Paul Barnett]] explains that
{{quote|Paul's relative lack of detailed reference to the historical Christ is usually explained in one of two ways: either Paul knew only that there was such a man but knew (or cared to know) little more (Bultmann), or he knew quite a lot but didn't need to elaborate this in his letters beyond what his readers already knew.&lt;ref name="Martin Hengel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hengel|first=Martin|title=The four Gospels and the one Gospel of Jesus Christ: an investigation of the collection and origin of the Canonical Gospels|isbn=978-1-5633-8300-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnett.2009.184"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnett|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Barnett (bishop)|title=Finding the Historical Christ|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPMIYtpKtDwC|year=2009|publisher=Wm.

=====Mythicist views=====
Wells criticized the infrequency of the reference to Jesus in the Pauline letters and has said there is no information in them about Jesus' parents, place of birth, teachings, trial nor crucifixion.&lt;ref name=WellsT49/&gt; Robert Price says that Paul does not refer to Jesus' earthly life, also not when that life might have provided convenient examples and justifications for Paul's teachings. Instead, revelation seems to have been a prominent source for Paul's knowledge about Jesus.{{sfnp|Price|2003}}

Wells says that the Pauline epistles do not make reference to [[Oral gospel traditions|Jesus' sayings]], or only in a vague and general sense. According to Wells, as referred to by Price in his own words, the writers of the New Testament "must surely have cited them when the same subjects came up in the situations they addressed."{{sfnp|Price|2011}}

=====Brother of the Lord=====
[http://biblehub.com/interlinear/1_corinthians/9-5.htm 1 Corinthians 9:5] and [http://biblehub.com/interlinear/galatians/1-19.htm Galatians 1:19] make reference to "the brothers of the Lord" and "James, the brother of the Lord" respectively. Per Galatians 1:19, mainstream scholarship holds that it attests that Paul met with [[James, brother of Jesus]].{{refn|group=q|name="Gullotta.2017.336"}}

Mythicists argue that 1 Corinthians 9:5 and Galatians 1:19 are references to a [[Fraternity|fraternal]] brotherhood, or that "Brother of the Lord" connotes a meaning other than a male sibling of Jesus.&lt;ref group=q name="mix.Price.2009.2011" /&gt;

=====Jesus’ birth=====
[https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/gal/4/1/t_concf_1095004   Galatians 4:4] and  [https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/rom/1/1/t_concf_1047003 Romans 1:3] make reference to Jesus’ birth, being: "born ({{lang-grc|γενόμενον|genómenon|made}}) of [a] woman" and "born ({{lang-grc|γενομένου|genoménou|was made }}) of [the] seed of David" respectively. Mainstream scholarship holds that Galatians 4:4 attests that Paul knew Jesus was born of a human mother and that per Romans 1:3, Paul says that Jesus was born a descendant of David—a historical ancestor in Paul's view.{{refn|group=q|name="Gullotta.2017.330"}}{{sfnp|Tuckett|2001|ps=none}}&lt;ref name=JRDunn143&gt;''Jesus Remembered: Christianity in the Making'' by James D.

Doherty and Carrier hold that Paul's unique usage of the term "made" in the context of these references is consistent with a "Celestial Jesus" who was born/incarnated when a human body was made for him.{{sfnp|Carrier|2014|p=570}} Wells contends that Paul's reference to Davidic descent "is surely to state an article of faith" and not an assertion of historical fact.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=175}}

=====Eucharist=====
[http://biblehub.com/interlinear/1_corinthians/11-23.htm 1 Corinthians 11:23–26] make reference to "the night" Jesus handled bread and wine, teaching Christians the theological ritual of the Lord's supper. Mainstream scholarship holds that it recalls the earthly life of Jesus "in the context of cultic rites that assumed his divinity."&lt;ref group=q name="Young.2006.14" /&gt;

Mythicists argue that Paul's vision of Jesus inaugurating the Eucharist ritual is an [[Etiology|etiological]] myth.{{sfnp|Carrier|2014|pp=557ff}}

=====Mainstream view=====
Most scholars view the Pauline letters as essential elements in the study of the historical Jesus,{{sfnp|Tuckett|2001|ps=none}}&lt;ref name=JRDunn143/&gt;&lt;ref name=McK38&gt;''Jesus Christ in History and Scripture'' by Edgar V.

According to Dunn, "Paul was told about a Jesus who had died two years earlier or so."&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus Remembered: Christianity in the Making'', Volume 1 by James D. G. Dunn (2003) {{ISBN|0802839312}} pp. 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt; [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#15:11|1 Corinthians 15:11]] also refers to others before Paul who preached the creed.&lt;ref name=RMartin57/&gt;

The Pauline letters incorporate creeds, or confessions of faith, that predate Paul, and give essential information on the faith of the early Jerusalem community around James, 'the brother of Jesus'.&lt;ref name=Kruse41 &gt;''Paul's Letter to the Romans'' by Colin G.

Yet, the development of the early Christian views on Jesus' divinity is a matter of debate within contemporary scholarship. According to a longstanding consensus, the oldest Christology was an "exaltation Christology," according to which Jesus was subsequently "raised to divine status."&lt;ref name=BE_2013.02.14&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ehrman|first1=Bart D.|authorlink1=Bart D.

Scholars have also argued that Paul was a "mythmaker,"{{sfnp|Maccoby|1986}} who gave his own [[Council of Jerusalem|divergent interpretation]] of the meaning of Jesus,{{sfnp|Mack|1995|ps=none}} building a bridge between the Jewish and Hellenistic world,{{sfnp|Mack|1995|ps=none}} thereby creating the faith that became Christianity.{{sfnp|Maccoby|1986}}

=====Mythicist views=====
Christ myth theorists generally reject the idea that Paul's epistles refer to a real person.&lt;ref name=Price62/&gt;&lt;ref name=WellsT49/&gt;

According to Doherty, the Jesus of Paul was a divine Son of God, existing in a spiritual realm{{sfnp|Doherty|1995a|ps=none}} where he was crucified and resurrected.{{sfnp|Doherty|2009}} This mythological Jesus was based on exegesis of the Old Testament and [[Vision (spirituality)|mystical visions]] of a risen Jesus.{{sfnp|Doherty|2009}}{{refn|group=q|name="vridar_Couchoud"}}

Carrier argues that Paul is actually writing about a celestial deity named Jesus: Carrier notes that there is little if any concrete information about Christ's earthly life in the Pauline epistles, even though Jesus is mentioned over three hundred times.&lt;ref name="Carrier2014_location34725"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carrier|first1=Richard|title=On the Historicity of Jesus|date=2014|publisher=Sheffield Phoenix Press|isbn=978-1-909697-70-6|page=location 34725|edition=Kindle}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Carrier, the genuine Pauline epistles show that the [[Saint Peter|Apostle Peter]] and the Apostle Paul believed in a visionary or dream Jesus, based on a [[pesher]] of [[Septuagint]] verses [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] 6 and 3, [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 9 and [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 52–53.{{sfnp|Carrier|2014|loc=Chapter 4 and Chapter 11}} Carrier further argues that according to Paul (Philippians 2.7), Christ "came 'in the likeness of men' (homoiomati anthropon) and was found 'in a form like a man' (schemati euretheis hos anthropos) and (in Rom. 8.3) that he was only sent 'in the likeness of sinful flesh' (en homoiomati sarkos hamartias). This is a doctrine of a preexistent being assuming a human body, but not being fully transformed into a man, just looking like one".{{sfnp|Carrier|2014|p=570}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The non-Pauline [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] is also relevant per [http://biblehub.com/interlinear/hebrews/5-7.htm Hebrews 5:7], "in the days of his flesh" Jesus cried and prayed to God to save him. Mythicists generally contend that this verse is anomalous with supposed traditions underlying the synoptic gospels, however Doherty and Carrier additionally hold that the phrase "in the days of his flesh" is consistent with a celestial Jesus.&lt;ref group=q name="Wells.1982.60" /&gt;{{sfnp|Carrier|2014|p=570}}

====Jesus lived in a dim past====

=====Mythicist views=====
The early Wells, and [[Alvar Ellegård]], have argued that Paul's Jesus may have lived far earlier, in a dimly remembered remote past.{{refn|group=q|name="mix.Price.2009.2011.Doherty.2012"}}

Wells argues that Paul and the other epistle writers—the earliest Christian writers—do not provide any support for the idea that Jesus lived early in the 1st century and that—for Paul—Jesus may have existed many decades, if not centuries, before.&lt;ref name=WellsT49&gt;''Can We Trust the New Testament?'' by George Albert Wells 2003 {{ISBN|0812695674}} pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Michael. ''The Case Against Christianity''. Temple University Press, 1993, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wells, the earliest strata of the New Testament literature presented Jesus as "a basically supernatural personage only obscurely on Earth as a man at some unspecified period in the past".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wells|first=GA|date=September 1999|title=Earliest Christianity|journal=New Humanist|volume=114|issue=3|pages=13–18|url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/g_a_wells/earliest.html|accessdate=January 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Jesus Myth'', Wells argues that two Jesus narratives fused into one: Paul's mythical Jesus and a minimally historical Jesus whose teachings were preserved in the [[Q document]], a hypothetical common source for the [[Gospel of Matthew|Gospels of Matthew]] [[Gospel of Luke|and Luke]].{{sfnp|Wells|1999}}

Some myth proponents assert that the writings of [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] makes reference to a group of [[Jewish Christian]]s who held that Jesus lived during the reign of [[Alexander Jannaeus]]—"placing Jesus about 100 BCE"—and that this was also the view presented in the Jewish writings about [[Jesus in the Talmud]] and the [[Toledot Yeshu]].{{refn|group=q|name="Price.2006.240"}}{{refn|group=q|name="Mead"}}

According to the ''Panarion'' by Epiphanius, the Jewish-Christian sect known as the [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarenes]] (Ναζωραιοι) began as Jewish converts of the [[Apostles]].{{refn|group=q|name="Panarion"}}{{refn|group=q|name="Carrier.2009.p293"}} Richard Carrier contends that "Epiphanius, in ''Panarion'' 29, says there was a sect of still-Torah-observant Christians who taught that Jesus lived and died in the time of Jannaeus, and all the Jewish sources on Christianity that we have (from the [[Talmud]] to the Toledot Yeshu) report no other view than that Jesus lived during the time of Jannaeus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carrier |first1=Richard |authorlink1=Richard Carrier|title=Ehrman on Jesus: A Failure of Facts and Logic|url=http://www.richardcarrier.info/archives/1026|website=Richard Carrier Blog|accessdate=August 27, 2017|date=April 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Carrier|2014|pp=284ff}}

=====Mainstream criticism=====
Theologian [[Gregory A.

In [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#1:19|Galatians 1:19]], Paul says he met with [[James, brother of Jesus|James]], the "Lord's brother";{{refn|group=q|name="Gullotta.2017.336"}} [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#15:3|1 Corinthians 15:3–8]] refers to people to whom Jesus' had appeared, and who were Paul's contemporaries; and in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Thessalonians#2:14|1 Thessalonians 2:14–16]] Paul refers to the Jews "who both killed the Lord Jesus" and "drove out us" as the same people, indicating that the death of Jesus was within the same time frame as the persecution of Paul.{{sfnp|Boyd|Eddy|2007|p=46–47}} Boyd and Eddy doubt that Paul viewed Jesus similar to the savior deities found in ancient mystery religions.{{sfnp|Boyd|Eddy|2007|p=45–47}}

===The Gospels are not historical records===
{{Main|The Gospels}}

==== Dating and authorship ====
The general consensus of modern scholars is that Mark was the first gospel to be written and dates from no earlier than {{circa|AD 65}}, while Matthew and Luke, which use it as a source, were written between AD 80 and 85.{{sfnp|Reddish|2011|pp=73–74, 144}} The composition history of John is complex, but most scholars see it taking place in stages beginning as early as before AD 70 and extending as late as the end of the century.{{sfnp|Reddish|2011|pp=73–74, 144}} None of the authors were eyewitnesses to the life of Jesus,{{sfnp|Baggett|2008|p=7}} "(t)he common wisdom in the academy is that stories and sayings of Jesus circulated for decades, undergoing countless retellings and embellishments before being finally set down in writing."{{sfnp|Review of Bauckham|2006|p=225}} According to scholar in theology [[Richard Bauckham]] the authors may have received their information very close to eyewitness reports.{{sfnp|Bauckham|2017}}{{refn|group=q|name="Review.Bauckham.2006.eyewitness"}}

According to Carrier, "The Gospels cannot really be dated, nor are the real authors known. Their names were assigned early, but not early enough for us to be confident they were accurately known. It is based on speculation that Mark was the first, written between AD 60 and 70, Matthew second, between AD 70 and 80, Luke (and Acts) third, between AD 80 and 90, and John last, between AD 90 and 100".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Richard |last1=Carrier |authorlink1=Richard Carrier|title=The Formation of the New Testament Canon |url=https://www.academia.edu/276996/The_Formation_of_the_New_Testament_Canon|website=Academia |accessdate=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Genre ====
According to [[Richard Burridge (priest)|Richard Burridge]], priest and biblical scholar, any study of the Gospels must first determine the genre under which they fall, in order to interpret them correctly, since genre "is a key convention guiding both the composition and the interpretation of writings".&lt;ref&gt;Burridge, R. A. (2006). Gospels. In J. W. Rogerson &amp; Judith M. Lieu (Eds) ''The Oxford Handbook of Biblical Studies''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 433&lt;/ref&gt; The gospels authors may have intended to write novels, myths, histories, or biographies, which are different genres and have a tremendous impact on how they ought to be interpreted. Among contemporary scholars, there is consensus that the gospels are a type of ancient biography,&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, G. H. (2004). ''Jesus and Gospel.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burridge, R. A. (2006). Gospels. In J. W. Rogerson &amp; Judith M. Lieu (Eds) ''The Oxford Handbook of Biblical Studies''.

Tomson (2001), ''If This be from Heaven... Jesus and the New Testament Authors in Their Relationship to Judaism'', Bloomsbury&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dan Lioy (2007), ''Jesus as Torah in John 1–12'', Wipf and Stock Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Paul Eddy and Gregory Boyd, mythicists argue that in the gospels "a fictitious historical narrative" was imposed on the "mythical cosmic savior figure" created by Paul.{{refn|group=q|name="Eddy_Boyd_2007"}}&lt;!-- * --&gt;

Robert Price notes support for the view that the gospels are a fictional composition,{{refn|group=q|name="Price2009"}} arguing that the Gospels are a type of legendary fiction{{refn|group=q|name="Eddy_Boyd2007_p314-315"}} and that the story of Jesus portrayed in the Gospels fits the [[Rank-Raglan mythotype|mythic hero archetype]].{{refn|group=q|name="Eddy_Boyd2007_p137-138"}}

Some myth proponents suggest that some parts of the New Testament were meant to appeal to [[Gentiles]] as familiar allegories rather than history.{{sfnp|Dawkins|2006|p=97}} According to Richard Carrier, the gospels are "essentially allegory and fiction".{{refn|group=q|name=Doherty2009_pvii–viii}}

==== Hebrew Bible parallels ====
Arguments drawing comparisons between the New and Old Testaments have traditionally been made by Christian theologians in defense of their teachings, but without doubting a historical Jesus.{{efn-lr|name="Comparisons"}}

Some myth proponents note that some stories in the [[New Testament]] seem to try to reinforce [[Bible prophecy|Old Testament prophecies]]{{sfnp|Dawkins|2006|p=97}} and repeat stories about figures like [[Elijah]], [[Elisha]],&lt;ref name="brodie2012"/&gt; [[Moses]] and [[Joshua]] in order to appeal to Jewish converts.{{sfnp|Price|2011|p=381}} Price notes that almost all the Gospel-stories have parallels in Old Testamentical and other traditions, concluding that the Gospels are no independent sources for a historical Jesus, but "legend and myth, fiction and redaction".{{sfnp|Price|2003|p=347}}

==== Greek influences ====
In ''Christ and the Caesars'' (1877), philosopher [[Bruno Bauer]] suggested that Christianity was a [[Religious syncretism|synthesis]] of the [[Stoicism]] of [[Seneca the Younger]], Greek [[Neoplatonism]], and the Jewish theology of Philo as developed by pro-Roman Jews such as [[Josephus]]. This new religion was in need of a founder and created its Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Moggach, Douglas. [https://books.google.com/books?id=mEQd5VP1lBIC&amp;pg=PA184 ''The Philosophy and Politics of Bruno Bauer'']. Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 184. *Also see Engels, Frederick.

==== Weaving together various traditions ====
According to Wells, a minimally historical Jesus existed, whose teachings were preserved in the [[Q document]].{{sfnp|Wells|1999}} According to Wells, the Gospels weave together two Jesus narratives, namely Paul's mythical Jesus and the Galilean preacher of the Q document.{{sfnp|Wells|1999}} Doherty disagrees with Wells regarding this teacher of the Q-document, arguing that he was an allegoral character who [[Wisdom (personification)|personified Wisdom]] and came to be regarded as the founder of the Q-community.{{sfnp|Doherty|1995d|ps=none}}{{sfnp|Doherty|1997}} According to Doherty, Q's Jesus and Paul's Christ were combined in the [[Gospel of Mark]] by a predominantly Gentile community.{{sfnp|Doherty|1995d|ps=none}}

=====Josephus=====
{{Main|Josephus on Jesus}}

Josephus' ''Antiquities of the Jews'', written around 93–94&amp;nbsp;AD, includes two references to the biblical Jesus in Books [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 3|18]] and [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XX#Chapter 9|20]]. The general scholarly view is that while the longer passage in book 18, known as the ''Testimonium Flavianum'', is most likely not authentic in its entirety, it is broadly agreed upon that it originally consisted of an authentic nucleus, which was then subject to Christian interpolation or forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schreckenberg|first=Heinz|title=Jewish Traditions in Early Christian Literature|year=1992|isbn=90-232-2653-4|author2=Kurt Schubert}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kostenberger|first=Andreas J.|title=The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament|year=2009|isbn=0-8054-4365-7|author2=L.

Quarles }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=q|name=Vermeer.2010.p54-55}}&lt;!-- * --&gt; Myth proponents also argue that the ''[[Testimonium Flavianum]]'' may have been a partial [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolation]] or forgery by Christian apologist [[Eusebius]] in the 4th century or by others.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth A. Olson, ''Eusebius and the Testimonium Flavianum''. The Catholic Biblical Quarterly 61 (2): 305, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Eddy|Boyd|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=WgROZMp4zDMC&amp;pg=PA197 197 n. 103]}}{{efn-lr|One reason why Christ mythicists suspect forgery  is because the passage previous to the ''Testimonium Flavianum'' concerns Pontius Pilate setting his soldiers loose to massacre a large crowd of Jews in Jerusalem and—without the ''Testimonium Flavianum''—the following paragraph starts by saying: "[[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 3|About the same time also another sad calamity put the Jews into disorder]]". They deem this suspicious as Josephus supposedly just wrote about Jesus being "the [[Christ (title)|Christ]]" and the rise of "the tribe of Christians", seeing this as not fitting in the context. {{pb}} Other reasons include the passage not being something a devout Jew such as Josephus would write (especially, "if it be lawful to call him a man" and "doer of incredible deeds"), as his writing was usually sophisticated and would have explained anything out of the ordinary to his Gentile audience, such as explaining what the word "Christ" means, why Jesus was called that and further explanations such as how he won over many Jews and Greeks, as he did for every other group (see [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 1|book 18, chapter 1]]), or why he would mention Jesus [[Resurrection of Jesus|"appearing" in the "third day"]]—a Christian creed—without explaining it{{sfnp|Maier|2007|pp=336–337}} and how no one seemed to notice this passage until the 4th century, not even [[Origen]] who quotes Josephus extensively in his works,{{sfnp|Louth|1990|}} thus leading mythicists to think that the ''Testimonium Flavianum'' is a forgery of the 4th century, perhaps written by Eusebius{{sfnp|McGiffert|2007}} in order to provide an outside Jewish authority for the life of Jesus.{{sfnp|Olson|1999}}{{sfnp|Wallace-Hadrill|2011}}}}

The other mention in Josephus is as follows:
{{quote|...the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James}}

According to Josephus scholar [[Louis H. Feldman]], "few have doubted the genuineness" of Josephus' reference to Jesus in [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XX#Chapter 9|Antiquities 20, 9, 1]] and it is only disputed by a small number of scholars.&lt;ref name=JospehusM662&gt;''The new complete works of Josephus'' by Flavius Josephus, William Whiston, Paul L. Maier {{ISBN|0-8254-2924-2}} pp. 662–663&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Josephus XX'' by [[Louis H.

''Josephus, the essential works: a condensation of Jewish antiquities and The Jewish war'' {{ISBN|978-0-8254-3260-6}} pp. 284–285&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Eddy and Gregory Boyd, who are critical of Christ myth theorists, note that Josephus "mentions twenty-one other people with the name Jesus,"{{efn-lr|Josephus mentions several people named Jesus ([[Jesus ben Ananias|Jesus son of Ananias]], [[Jesus son of Damneus]], Jesus son of Onias and Jesus the brother of John) as well as various [[prophet]]s, being avidly against calling any of them [[Messiah]]s, even describing them as "having evil or dishonorable intentions" and sometimes calling them "charlatans" (the [[Egyptian (prophet)|Egyptian]], the [[Samaritan]], [[Theudas]] and an unnamed "impostor"), but providing for each more information and explanations than the Jesus passage.}} and argue that when Josephus called [[James the Just|James]] the "brother" of Jesus "called Christ" in the ''Antiquities'', he did so to distinguish him "from the other persons named 'Jesus' he had already mentioned."{{sfnp|Eddy|Boyd|2007|p=189}}{{efn-lr|More specifically, from  Jesus son of Damneus, who is mentioned at the end of [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XX#Chapter 9|book 20, chapter 9:1]]).{{sfnp|Eddy|Boyd|2007|p=189}}}}

Richard Carrier disagrees, proposing that the original text referred to a brother of the high priest [[Jesus son of Damneus]], named James, who is mentioned in the same narrative, in which James (the brother of Jesus) is executed by [[Ananus ben Ananus]].{{sfnp|Carrier|2012}}{{efn-lr|The Jews get angry at this, therefore complaints and demands are made, the king removes Ananus from being high priest and Jesus is then made high priest.{{sfnp|Carrier|2012}}}} Carrier further argues that the words "the one called Christ" likely resulted from the accidental insertion of a marginal note added by some unknown reader.{{sfnp|Carrier|2012}}

Others speculate that he was referring to a mythic Christ that had already been historicized, or to [[Fraternity|fraternal]] brotherhood rather than a literal sibling.&lt;ref group=q name="mix.Price.2009.2011" /&gt; This is dismissed by some in mainstream academia on the grounds that there is no evidence of a supposed "Jerusalem brotherhood".&lt;ref name="Habermas"&gt;The Historical Jesus: Ancient Evidence for the Life of Christ, by Gary R. Habermas, College Press, 1996. pp. 31–35&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Tacitus=====
{{Main|Tacitus on Christ}}

[[Roman historiography|Roman historian]] Tacitus referred to "Christus" and his execution by Pontius Pilate in his ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' (written {{circa|AD 116}}), [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#44|book 15, chapter 44]]:&lt;ref name="P.E. Easterling, E. J p. 892"&gt;P.E. Easterling, E. J.

J. Church]] and W. J. Brodribb, 1876&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The very negative tone of Tacitus' comments on Christians make most experts believe that the passage is extremely unlikely to have been forged by a Christian scribe.{{sfnp|Van Voorst|2000|pp=39–53}} The Tacitus reference is now widely accepted as an independent confirmation of Christ's crucifixion,{{sfnp|Eddy|Boyd|2007|p=127}} although some scholars question the [[Tacitus on Christ#Authenticity and historical value|historical value of the passage]] on various grounds.{{sfnp|Van Voorst|2000|pp=39–53}}&lt;ref&gt;F.F.

Christ myth theory supporters such as G. A. Wells and Carrier contend that sources such as Tacitus and others, which were written decades after the supposed events, include no independent traditions that relate to Jesus, and hence can provide no confirmation of historical facts about him.{{refn|group=q|name="Voorst2000_p13"}}{{refn|group=q|name="Lataster2015_p68"}}

====Other sources====
In ''Jesus Outside the New Testament'' (2000), mainstream scholar Van Voorst considers references to Jesus in classical writings, Jewish writings, hypothetical sources of the canonical Gospels, and extant Christian writings outside the New Testament. Van Voorst concludes that non-Christian sources provide "a small but certain corroboration of certain New Testament historical traditions on the family background, time of life, ministry, and death of Jesus", as well as "evidence of the content of Christian preaching that is independent of the New Testament", while extra-biblical Christian sources give access to "some important information about the earliest traditions on Jesus". However, New Testament sources remain central for "both the main lines and the details about Jesus' life and teaching".{{sfnp|Van Voorst|2000|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diversity and parallels===
{{See also|Origins of Christianity|Gnosticism}}

====Early Christian diversity points to multiple roots====
{{See also|Diversity in early Christian theology}}
Early Christianity was wildly diverse, with proto-orthodoxy and "[[Heresy|heretical]]" views like gnosticism alongside each other.{{sfnp|Pagels|1979}}{{sfnp|Ehrman|2003|ps=none}} According to Mack, various "Jesus movements" existed, whose ideas converged in an early proto-orthodoxy.{{sfnp|Mack|1995|ps=none}}

According to Doherty, the rapid growth of early Christian communities and the great variety of ideas cannot be explained by a single missionary effort, but points to parallel developments, which arose at various places and competed for support. Paul's arguments against rival apostles also point to this diversity.{{sfnp|Doherty|1995c|ps=none}} Doherty further notes that [[Yeshua]] (Jesus) is a generic name, meaning "Yahweh saves" and refers to the concept of divine salvation, which could apply to any kind of saving entity or Wisdom.{{sfnp|Doherty|1995c|ps=none}}

==== Parallels with other religions ====
{{See also|Religious syncretism|Mytheme}}

Doherty notes that, with the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]], the [[Ancient Greece|Greek culture]] and [[Ancient Greek|language]] spread throughout the eastern Mediterranean world, influencing the already existing cultures there.{{sfnp|Doherty|1995c|ps=none}} The Roman conquest of this area added to the cultural diversity, but also to a sense of alienation and pessimism.{{sfnp|Doherty|1995c|ps=none}} A rich diversity of religious and philosophical ideas was available and [[Judaism]] was held in high regard by non-Jews for its monotheistic ideas and its high moral standards.{{sfnp|Doherty|1995c|ps=none}} Yet [[monotheism]] was also offered by Greek philosophy, especially [[Platonism]], with its high God and the intermediary [[Logos]].{{sfnp|Doherty|1995c|ps=none}} According to Doherty, "Out of this rich soil of ideas arose Christianity, a product of both Jewish and Greek philosophy",{{sfnp|Doherty|1995c|ps=none}} echoing Bruno Bauer, who argued that Christianity was a synthesis of Stoicism, Greek Neoplatonism and Jewish thought.{{refn|group=q|name="Voorst.2000.9.syncretism"}}

===== Jewish belief in a celestial angel called Jesus =====
Mainstream scholars have noted the extent and significance of Jewish belief in a chief angel acting as a heavenly mediator during the [[Second Temple period]],{{refn|group=q| name="Jewish angel"}} as well as the similarities between Jesus and this chief celestial angel.{{refn|group=q|name="Barker.1992.p190-233"}} Ehrman has even gone so far as to argue that Paul regarded Jesus to be an angel, who was incarnated on earth.{{sfnp|Ehrman|2014|ps=none}}{{efn-lr|name=Ehrman_angel|Ehrman-blog, [https://ehrmanblog.org/pauls-christology/ ''Paul’s View of Jesus as an Angel'']: "Paul understood Christ to be an angel who became a human."

According to Carrier, originally "Jesus was the name of a celestial being, subordinate to God".&lt;ref name="Carrier.2012.where.did.he.come.from"/&gt; According to Carrier, "This 'Jesus' would most likely have been the same archangel identified by Philo of Alexandria as already extant in Jewish theology".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Carrier|2014|pp=200–205}}{{bulleted list |Jesus being a preexisting archangel: Phil. 2:5–11 |Jesus was as an angel: Gal. 4:14 |Jesus knew Moses: 1 Cor. 10:4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philo knew this figure by all of the attributes Paul already knew Jesus by: the firstborn son of God ([[Epistle to the Romans]] 8:29), the celestial image of God ([[Second Epistle to the Corinthians]] 4:4) and God's agent of creation ([[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] 8:6). He was also God's celestial high priest (Hebrews 2:17, 4:14, etc.) and God's Logos. Philo says this being was identified as the figure named Jesus in the [[Book of Zechariah]].{{refn|group=q|name="Carrier.Zechariah.6"}}

===== Personification of Logos and Wisdom =====
Separately from mythicism, scholar of ancient religious studies [[Peter Schäfer]] contends that Philo's Logos was likely derived from his understanding of the "postbiblical Wisdom literature, in particular the Wisdom of Solomon".{{refn|group=q|name="Schäfer.2011.p159"}} Professor of New Testament at Loyola University Urban C. von Wahlde notes that the Wisdom literature and the philosophical writings of Philo may furnish "the background to the Logos of the [[Johannine epistles|Johannine]] Prologue".{{refn|group=q|name="Wahlde.2015.p171"}}

According to mythicists, Christianity originated from a Jewish [[sect]]{{refn|group=q|name="mix.Price.2010.103.Price.2002"}} in a [[Social environment|milieu]] where some [[Jews]] practised a form of proto-gnosticism{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}—seeking salvation by revealed [[gnosis]]—via a mediator between God and humans, i.e. an intermediary variously known as "one like a son of man", "the divine Logos", etc. From the cultus of Paul, a divergent form of this salvation theology was later promoted for non-Jews.{{refn|group=q|name="mix.Lataster.2016.Carrier.2016"}}{{refn|group=q|name="mix.Doherty.2009.1996.2012"}}{{refn|group=q|name="mix.Price.2000.79.Doherty.2000"}}{{refn|group=q|name="mix.Wells.1999.97.Doherty.2012"}}

According to Doherty, a somewhat similar idea to the Greek Logos was found in Judaism, where [[Biblical cosmology#Naming: God, Wisdom, Torah and Christ|Wisdom]], a personified part of God, brought knowledge of God and the Law.{{sfnp|Doherty|1995c|ps=none}} Similar ideas were also developed in other cultures and religions.{{sfnp|Doherty|1995c|ps=none}} According to Wells, the historical Jesus was derived from this Wisdom traditions, the personification of an eternal aspect of God, who came to visit human beings.{{sfnp|Ehrman|2012|p=349, n. 20}} Doherty notes that the concept of a spiritual Christ was the result of common philosophical and religious ideas of the first and second century AD, in which the idea of an intermediary force between God and the world were common.{{sfnp|Doherty|1995a|ps=none}} Doherty further notes that [[divine inspiration]] was a common concept.{{sfnp|Doherty|1995a|ps=none}}

===== Jewish-Hellenistic mystery cult =====
According to Doherty, the Christ of Paul shares similarities with the [[Greco-Roman mysteries|Greco-Roman mystery cults]].{{sfnp|Doherty|1995a|ps=none}} Authors Timothy Freke and [[Peter Gandy (author)|Peter Gandy]] explicitly argue that Jesus was a deity, akin to the mystery cults,{{sfnp|Freke|Gandy|1999}} while [[Acharya S|Dorothy Murdock]] argues that the Christ myth draws heavily on the Egyptian story of [[Osiris]] and [[Horus]].&lt;ref name="Christ in Egypt"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Price |first1=Robert M. |title=Book review of D.M.

Mainstream scholarship disagrees with this interpretation. Many mainstream biblical scholars respond that most of these parallels are either coincidences or without historical basis and/or that these parallels do not prove that a Jesus figure did not live.{{sfnp|Ehrman|2012|p=208}}{{efn-lr|In particular, the transformations faced by deities have distinct differences from the resurrection of Jesus.  [[Osiris]] regains consciousness as king of the underworld, rather than being "transformed into an eschatological new creation" as [[Craig S. Keener]] writes.&lt;ref name="Keener"&gt;The Historical Jesus of the Gospels, by Craig S. Keener, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2012. p. 336&lt;/ref&gt;  While Jesus was born from a human woman (traditionally a virgin) and accompanied by shepherds, [[Mitra]] is born (unaccompanied by shepherds) from the goddess [[Aditi]] (to whom the word "virgin" is only rarely, loosely, and indirectly applied in a highly poetic sense), while [[Mithras]] (granted, accompanied by shepherds later) emerges full-grown from a rock.{{sfnp|Casey|2014|p=155}} The rebirth of many of these deities was a clear metaphor for the renewal of spring that repeated the death every year, rather than a historic event meant to proclaim the god's cancellation of death. Some of these parallels appear after Christianity (e.g. the earliest references to [[Adonis]] rising from the dead is in the second century AD, [[Attis]] a century later), and are often only known through later Christian sources. Most other and later parallels were made in the works of [[James George Frazer]],&lt;ref name="Keener" /&gt; or may be guilty of [[parallelomania]]&lt;ref&gt;Jesus and His Contemporaries: Comparative Studies, by Craig A.

According to Van Voorst, "The argument that Jesus never existed, but was invented by the Christian movement around the year 100, goes back to Enlightenment times, when the historical-critical study of the past was born," and may have originated with Lord Bolingbroke, an English deist.{{sfnp|Van Voorst|2000|p=568}}

According to Weaver and Schneider, the beginnings of the formal denial of the existence of Jesus can be traced to late 18th-century France with the works of [[Constantin-François Chassebœuf|Constantin François Chassebœuf de Volney]] and [[Charles-François Dupuis]].{{sfnp|Weaver|1999|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=1CZbuFBdAMUC&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;f=false 45–50]}}{{sfnp|Schweitzer|2001|pp=355ff}} Volney and Dupuis argued that Christianity was an amalgamation of various ancient mythologies and that Jesus was a totally mythical character.{{sfnp|Weaver|1999|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=1CZbuFBdAMUC&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;f=false 45–50]}}{{sfnp|Voorst|2000|p=8}} Dupuis argued that ancient rituals in Syria, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, and India had influenced the Christian story which was [[allegory|allegorized]] as the histories of [[solar deity|solar deities]], such as [[Sol Invictus]].{{sfnp|Wells|1969|p=}} Dupuis also said that the resurrection of Jesus was an allegory for the growth of the sun's strength in the sign of Aries at the spring [[equinox]].{{sfnp|Wells|1969|p=}} Volney argued that [[Abraham]] and [[Sarah]] were derived from [[Brahma]] and his wife [[Saraswati]], whereas Christ was related to [[Krishna]].&lt;ref name=Leask104&gt;''British Romantic Writers and the East'' by Nigel Leask (2004) {{ISBN|0521604443}} Cambridge Univ Press pp. 104–105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Tristram Stuart |first=Tristram |last=Stuart |title=The Bloodless Revolution |publisher=W.

[[File:1908 David-Friedrich-Strauss.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.6|alt=portrait|German Professor [[David Strauss]]]]
In 1835, German theologian [[David Strauss|David Friedrich Strauss]] published his extremely controversial ''The Life of Jesus, Critically Examined'' (''Das Leben Jesu''). While not denying that Jesus existed, he did argue that the miracles in the New Testament were mythical retellings of normal events as supernatural happenings.&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of Jesus, Critically Examined'' by David Friedrich Strauss 2010 {{ISBN|1-61640-309-8}} pp. 39–43, 87–91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Making of the New Spirituality'' by James A.

McClymond (2004) {{ISBN|0802826806}} p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; According to Strauss, the early church developed these miracle stories to present Jesus as a fulfillment of Jewish prophecies of what the Messiah would be like. This [[rationalist]] perspective was in direct opposition to the [[supernaturalism|supernaturalist]] view that the bible was accurate both historically and spiritually. The book caused an uproar across Europe, as [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury]] called it "the most pestilential book ever vomited out of the jaws of hell"&lt;ref name=Dawes77 &gt;''The historical Jesus question'' by Gregory W. Dawes 2001 {{ISBN|0-664-22458-X}} pp. 77–79&lt;/ref&gt; and Strauss' appointment as chair of theology at the [[University of Zürich]] caused such controversy that the authorities offered him a pension before he had a chance to start his duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chora-strangers.org/article/mcgaughey1994 |author=Douglas R McGaughey |date=1994 |title=On D.F.

[[File:Bruno Bauer.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|alt=portrait|German Professor [[Bruno Bauer]]]]
German Bruno Bauer, who taught at the [[University of Bonn]], took Strauss' arguments further and became the first author to systematically argue that Jesus did not exist.{{sfnp|Van Voorst|2000|pp=7–11}}&lt;ref name="BeilbyEddy2009"&gt;Beilby, James K. and Eddy, Paul Rhodes.

Then in his ''Criticism of the Pauline Epistles'' (1850–1852) and in ''A Critique of the Gospels and a History of their Origin'' (1850–1851), Bauer argued that Jesus had not existed.{{sfnp|Schweitzer|2001|pp=124–128, 139–141}} Bauer's work was heavily criticized at the time, as in 1839 he was removed from his position at the University of Bonn and his work did not have much impact on future myth theorists.{{sfnp|Van Voorst|2000|pp=7–11}}{{sfnp|Bennett|2001|p=204}}

In his two-volume, 867-page book ''[[Anacalypsis]]'' (1836), English gentleman [[Godfrey Higgins]] said that "the mythos of the Hindus, the mythos of the Jews and the mythos of the Greeks are all at bottom the same; and are contrivances under the appearance of histories to perpetuate doctrines"{{sfnp|Harpur|2004|p=30}} and that Christian editors “either from roguery or folly, corrupted them all”.{{sfnp|Harpur|2004|p=59}} In his 1875 book ''[[The World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors]]'', American [[Kersey Graves]] said that many demigods from different countries shared similar stories, traits or quotes as Jesus and he used Higgins as the main source for his arguments. The validity of the claims in the book have been greatly criticized by Christ myth proponents like Richard Carrier and largely dismissed by biblical scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/graves.html Kersey Graves and The World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors] by Richard Carrier (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1870s, English poet and author [[Gerald Massey]] became interested in Egyptology and reportedly taught himself Egyptian hieroglyphics at the British Museum.{{sfnp|Harpur|2004}} In 1883, Massey published ''The Natural Genesis'' where he asserted parallels between Jesus and the Egyptian god [[Horus]]. His other major work, ''Ancient Egypt: The Light of the World,'' was published shortly before his death in 1907. His assertions have influenced various later writers such as [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn]] and [[Tom Harpur]].{{sfnp|Harpur|2004|p=200}} Despite criticisms from Stanley Porter and Ward Gasque, Massey's theories regarding Egyptian etymologies for certain scriptures are supported by noted contemporary Egyptologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomharpur.com/documentary-afterword.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513171957/http://www.tomharpur.com/documentary-afterword.asp|archivedate=May 13, 2008|title=Biography – Tom Harpur – The Official Website|date=May 13, 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1870s and 1880s, a group of scholars associated with the [[University of Amsterdam]], known in German scholarship as the Radical Dutch school, rejected the authenticity of the Pauline epistles and took a generally negative view of the Bible's historical value.{{sfnp|Van Voorst|2000|p=10}} [[Abraham Dirk Loman]] argued in 1881 that all New Testament writings belonged to the 2nd century and doubted that Jesus was a historical figure, but later said the core of the gospels was genuine.{{sfnp|Schweitzer|2001|pp=356–361, 527 n. 4}}

== Early-20th-century proponents ==
During the early 20th century, several writers published arguments against Jesus' historicity, often drawing on the work of liberal theologians, who tended to deny any value to sources for Jesus outside the New Testament and limited their attention to Mark and the hypothetical [[Q source]].{{sfnp|Schweitzer|2001|pp=356–361, 527 n. 4}} They also made use of the growing field of [[History of religions|religious history]] which found sources for Christian ideas in Greek and Oriental mystery cults, rather than Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Arvidsson, Stefan. ''Aryan Idols: Indo-European Mythology as Ideology and Science''. University of Chicago Press, 2006, pp. 116–117.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Klausner]] wrote that biblical scholars "tried their hardest to find in the historic Jesus something which is not Judaism; but in his actual history they have found nothing of this whatever, since this history is reduced almost to zero. It is therefore no wonder that at the beginning of this century there has been a revival of the eighteenth and nineteenth century view that Jesus never existed".&lt;ref&gt;Klausner, Joseph. ''Jesus of Nazareth''. Bloch, 1989; first published 1925, pp. 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of social anthropologist [[Sir James George Frazer]] has had an influence on various myth theorists, although Frazer himself believed that Jesus existed.{{sfnp|Bennett|2001|p=205}} In 1890, Frazer published the first edition of ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' which attempted to define the shared elements of religious belief. This work became the basis of many later authors who argued that the story of Jesus was a fiction created by Christians. After a number of people claimed that he was a myth theorist, in the 1913 expanded edition of ''The Golden Bough'' he expressly stated that his theory assumed a historical Jesus.{{sfnp|Price|2000|p=207}}

In 1900, Scottish Member of Parliament [[J. M. Robertson|John Mackinnon Robertson]] argued that Jesus never existed, but was an invention by a first-century messianic cult.{{sfnp|Van Voorst|2000|pp=11–12}}{{sfnp|Wells|1987|pp=162–163}} In Robertson's view, religious groups invent new gods to fit the needs of the society of the time.{{sfnp|Van Voorst|2000|pp=11–12}} Robertson argued that a solar deity symbolized by the lamb and the ram had long been worshiped by an Israelite cult of Joshua and that this cult had then invented a new messianic figure, Jesus of Nazareth.{{sfnp|Van Voorst|2000|pp=11–12}}{{sfnp|Robertson|1900|p=34}}{{sfnp|Robertson|1902|p=72}} Robertson argued that a possible source for the Christian myth may have been the Talmudic story of the executed [[Yeshu|Jesus Pandera]] which dates to 100 BC.{{sfnp|Van Voorst|2000|pp=11–12}}{{sfnp|Robertson|1902|pp=6–12, 14–15}} Robertson considered the letters of Paul the earliest surviving Christian writings, but viewed them as primarily concerned with theology and morality, rather than historical details. Robertson viewed references to the twelve apostles and the institution of the [[Eucharist]] as stories that must have developed later among gentile believers who were converted by Jewish evangelists like Paul.{{sfnp|Van Voorst|2000|pp=11–12}}{{sfnp|Robertson|1902|p=18}}{{sfnp|Wells|1987|p=149}}

The English school master [[G. R. S. Mead|George Robert Stowe Mead]] argued in 1903 that Jesus had existed, but that he had lived in 100 BC.&lt;ref name=MeadQ&gt;''G. R. S. Mead and the Gnostic Quest'' by Clare Goodrick-Clarke (2005) {{ISBN|155643572X}} pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Price|2009|pp=80–81}} Mead based his argument on the Talmud, which pointed to Jesus being crucified {{circa|100 BC}}. In Mead's view, this would mean that the Christian gospels are mythical.&lt;ref&gt;''Did Jesus Live 100 B.C.?'' by [[G. R. S. Mead]] (1903) {{ISBN|1596053763}} (Cosimo Classics 2005) pp. 10–12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Harpur]] has compared Mead's impact on myth theory to that of Bruno Bauer and Arthur Drews.&lt;ref&gt;''Pagan Christ: Is Blind Faith Killing Christianity?'' by Tom Harpur (2006) {{ISBN|0802777414}} p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, school teacher [[John Remsburg|John Eleazer Remsburg]] published ''The Christ'', which made a distinction between a possible historical Jesus (Jesus of Nazareth) and the Jesus of the Gospels (Jesus of Bethlehem). Remsburg thought that there was good reason to believe that the historical Jesus existed, but that the "Christ of Christianity" was a mythological creation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Christ'' by John Remsburg 1909, Chapter 1: "Christ's Real Existence Impossible"&lt;/ref&gt; Remsburg compiled a list of 42 names of "writers who lived and wrote during the time, or within a century after the time" who Remsburg felt should have written about Jesus if the Gospels account was reasonably accurate, but who did not.&lt;ref&gt;''The Christ Myth'' by John Remsburg 1909, Chapter 2: "Silence of Contemporary Writers"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fable"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Free Inquiry | volume = 34 | issue = 5 | year = 2014 | page = 56 | title = The Fable of the Christ | last = Paulkovich | first = Michael | url = http://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php/articles/5656 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paulkovich"&gt;{{cite book |title=Beyond the Crusades|last=Paulkovich |first=Michael |year=2016 |publisher=[[American Atheists|American Atheist Press]] |isbn=978-1-5788-4037-3 |pages=267–2805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arthur Drews.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|alt=portrait|German Professor [[Arthur Drews]]]]
Also in 1909, German philosophy Professor [[Arthur Drews|Christian Heinrich Arthur Drews]] wrote ''[[The Christ Myth]]'' to argue that Christianity had been a Jewish Gnostic cult that spread by appropriating aspects of Greek philosophy and life-death-rebirth deities.&lt;ref&gt;Drews' book was reviewed by A.

In 1927, British philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] stated in his lecture ''[[Why I Am Not a Christian]]'' that "historically it is quite doubtful that Jesus existed, and if he did we do not know anything about him, so that I am not concerned with the historical question, which is a very difficult one", though Russell did nothing to further develop the idea.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand.

== Modern proponents ==

=== Paul-Louis Couchoud ===
The French philosopher Paul-Louis Couchoud,{{sfnp|Weaver|1999|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=1CZbuFBdAMUC&amp;pg=PA300 300–303]}} published in the 1920s and 1930s, but was a predecessor for contemporary mythicists.{{refn|group=q|name="vridar_Couchoud"}} According to Couchoud, Christianity started not with a biography of Jesus but "a collective mystical experience, sustaining a divine history mystically revealed."{{refn|group=q|name="Couchoud1926_p23"}} Couchaud's Jesus is not a "myth", but a "religious conception".&lt;ref name="Hibbert1939"&gt;''Hibbert Journal'' Volume 37 (1938–39), pp. 193–214&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Price mentions Couchoud's comment on the Christ Hymn, one of the relics of the Christ cults to which Paul converted. Couchoud noted that in this hymn the name Jesus was given to the Christ after his torturous death, implying that there cannot have been a ministry by a teacher called Jesus.&lt;ref name="Price.2003.Name" /&gt;

=== George Albert Wells ===
[[George Albert Wells]] (1926–2017), a professor of German, revived the interest in the Christ myth theory. In his early work,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wells|1971}}, {{harvp|Wells|1975}}, {{harvp|Wells|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; including ''[[Did Jesus Exist? (Wells)|Did Jesus Exist?]]'' (1975), Wells argued that because the Gospels were written decades after Jesus's death by Christians who were theologically motivated but had no personal knowledge of him, a rational person should believe the gospels only if they are independently confirmed.&lt;ref name="Martin.1993.p38"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Michael|title=The Case Against Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wWkC4dTmK0AC&amp;pg=PA38 |date=1993 |publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-1-56639-081-1|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells was featured in the controversial UK television programme series, ''[[Jesus: The Evidence]]'' (Channel 4: 1984), which caused a furore, being Channel 4's first major religious programme commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallis|first=Richard|date=January 27, 2016|title=Channel 4 and the declining influence of organized religion on UK television.

Atheist philosopher and scholar [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]] supported his thesis, claiming: "Jesus is not placed in a historical context and the biographical details of his life are left unsuspecte [...] a strong prima facie case challenging the historicity of Jesus can be constructed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Gary R|title=The Historical Jesus: Ancient Evidence for the Life of Christ|date=1996|publisher=College Pr Pub Co; Subsequent edition|isbn=0-8990-0732-5|pages=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin adds in his book ''The Case Against Christianity'' that "Well's argument against the historicity [of Jesus] is sound".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Martin |first1=Michael |title=The Case Against Christianity |date=1993 |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=1566390818 |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Wells concluded that a historical Jesus figure did exist and was a Galilean preacher, whose teachings were preserved in the Q document, a hypothetical common source for the gospels of Matthew and Luke.{{refn|group=q|name="Wells_historicity"}} However, he continued to insist that Biblical Jesus did not exist and argued that stories such as the virgin birth, the crucifixion around A.D. 30 under Pilate and the resurrection should be regarded as legendary.{{sfnp|Wells|1999}}{{refn|group=q|name="Wells.Jesus.Down.Size"}}{{efn-lr|For a more brief statement of his position, Wells refers readers to his article, "Jesus, Historicity of" in Tom Flynn's ''The New Encyclopedia of Unbelief''. Prometheus Books, 2007, pp. 446ff. Per Wells, G. A. ''Cutting Jesus Down to Size''. Open Court, 2009, pp. 327–328.}} Biblical scholar [[Robert E. Van Voorst]] said that with this argument Wells had performed an about-face.{{refn|group=q|name="Voorst.2003.p660"}} However, other scholars continue to note Wells as a mythicist.{{refn|group=q|name=mix.Doherty.Wells}}

In his 2009 book ''Cutting Jesus Down to Size'',{{sfnp|Wells|2009}} Wells clarified that he believes the Gospels represent the fusion of two originally independent streams: a Galilean preaching tradition and the supernatural personage of Paul's early epistles, but he says that both figures owe much of their substance to ideas from the Jewish wisdom literature.{{refn|group=q|name="Wells2013_p16"}}

In 2000 Van Voorst gave an overview of proponents of the "Nonexistence Hypothesis" and their arguments, and eight arguments against this hypothesis as put forward by Wells and his predecessors:{{sfnp|Van Voorst|2000|p=14-15}}{{sfnp|Van Voorst|2003|p=659–660}}
# The "argument of silence" is to be rejected, because "it is wrong to suppose that what is unmentioned or undetailed did not exist." Van Voorst further argues that the early Christian literature was not written for historical purposes.
# Dating the "invention" of Jesus around 100 CE is too late; Mark was written earlier, and contains abundant historical details which are correct.
# The argument that the development of the Gospel traditions shows that there was no historical Jesus is incorrect; "development does not prove wholesale invention, and difficulties do not prove invention."
# Wells cannot explain why "no pagans and Jews who opposed Christianity denied Jesus' historicity or even questioned it."
# The rejection of Tacitus and Josephus ignores the scholarly consensus.
# Proponents of the "Nonexistence Hypothesis" are not driven by scholarly interests, but by anti-Christian sentiments.
# Wells and others do not offer alternative "other, credible hypotheses" for the origins of Christianity.
# Wells himself accepted the existence of a minimal historical Jesus, thereby effectively leaving the "Nonexistence Hypothesis."

According to Graham Stanton, writing in 2002, Wells advanced the most sophisticated version of the Christ myth theory, noting that "[t]his intriguing theory rests on several pillars, each of which is shaky."{{Sfnp|Stanton|2002|pp=143ff}} According to Maurice Casey, Wells' work repeated the main points of the ''Religionsgeschichtliche Schule'', which are deemed outdated by mainstream scholarship. His works were not discussed by New Testament scholars, because it was "not considered to be original, and all his main points were thought to have been refuted long time ago, for reasons which were very well known."{{sfnp|Casey|2014}}

=== Earl Doherty ===
Canadian writer [[Earl Doherty]] (born 1941) was introduced to the Christ myth theme by a lecture by Wells in the 1970s.{{sfnp|Doherty|1995a|ps=none}}{{efn-lr|His subsequential study of the topic was published as ''The Jesus Puzzle'' in a series of articles in the Humanist (1995–1996){{sfnp|Doherty|1995a|ps=none}} and as a book (1999), and republished as ''Jesus: Neither God nor Man – The Case for a Mythical Jesus'' (2009).}} Doherty follows the lead of Wells, but disagrees on the historicity of Jesus, arguing that "everything in Paul points to a belief in an entirely divine Son who "lived" and acted in the spiritual realm, in the same mythical setting in which all the other savior deities of the day were seen to operate".{{sfnp|Doherty|1995a|ps=none}} According to Doherty, Paul's Christ originated as a myth derived from [[middle Platonism]] with some influence from [[Merkabah mysticism|Jewish mysticism]] and belief in a historical Jesus emerged only among Christian communities in the 2nd century.{{sfnp|Doherty|2009|p=vii–viii}}

Paul and other writers of the earliest existing proto-Christian documents did not believe in Jesus as a person who was incarnated on Earth in a historical setting, rather they believed in Jesus as a heavenly being who suffered his sacrificial death in the lower spheres of heaven, where he was crucified by demons and then was subsequently resurrected by God. This mythological Jesus was not based on a historical Jesus, but rather on an [[exegesis]] of the Old Testament in the context of Jewish-Hellenistic religious syncretism and what the early authors believed to be mystical visions of a risen Jesus.{{sfnp|Doherty|2009}}

Doherty agrees with Bauckham that the earliest Christology was already a "high Christology," that is, Jesus was an incarnation of the pre-existent Christ, but deems it "hardly credible" that such a belief could develop in such a short time among Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty (2009). Jesus: Neither God Nor Man – The Case for a Mythical Jesus. Ottawa: Age of Reason Publications. p. 716, n. 12. {{ISBN|978-0-9689259-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Doherty concludes that Christianity started  with the myth of this incarnated Christ, who was subsequently historicised.

According to Doherty, the nucleus of this historicised Jesus of the Gospels can be found in the Jesus-movement which wrote the Q source.{{sfnp|Doherty|1995d|ps=none}} According to Doherty, the Q-authors may have regarded themselves as "spokespersons for the Wisdom of God", with Jesus being the embodiment of this Wisdom,{{sfnp|Doherty|1995d|ps=none}}{{sfnp|Doherty|1997}} who was added in the latest phase of the development of Q.{{sfnp|Doherty|1995d|ps=none}} Q then started to take the form of a "foundation document", in response to a concurring sect who saw John the Baptist as its founder.{{sfnp|Doherty|1995d|ps=none}} Eventually, Q's Jesus and Paul's Christ were combined in the Gospel of Mark by a predominantly gentile community.{{sfnp|Doherty|1995d|ps=none}} In time, the gospel-narrative of this embodiment of Wisdom became interpreted as the literal history of the life of Jesus.{{sfnp|Doherty|1997}}

New Testament scholar Bart Ehrman quotes Doherty from ''The Jesus Puzzle'' as maintaining that it was Paul's view that Jesus' death took place in the spiritual not the earthly realm,&lt;ref name="Bart D. Ehrman 2"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ehrman|first1=Bart D.|title=Did Jesus Exist?: The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth|date=2012|publisher=Harper One|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-20899-46}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|258}} but according to Ehrman, not only is there "no evidence to support Doherty's assertion of what Paul's view of Jesus was", but there are also "a host of reasons for calling Doherty's view into serious question."&lt;ref name="Bart D. Ehrman 2"/&gt;{{rp|254,258}}

In a book criticizing the Christ myth theory, New Testament scholar [[Maurice Casey]] describes Doherty as "perhaps the most influential of all the mythicists",{{sfnp|Casey|2014|p=2}} but one who is unable to understand the ancient texts he uses in his arguments.{{sfnp|Casey|2014|p=16}}

=== Robert M. Price ===
[[File:Robert M. Price 1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|alt=Robert Price at a microphone|American New Testament scholar [[Robert M. Price]]]]
American New Testament scholar and former [[Baptist]] pastor Robert M. Price (born 1954) was a fellow of the [[Jesus Seminar]], a group of writers and scholars who study the historicity of Jesus and who argue that the Christian image of Christ is a theological construct into which traces of Jesus of Nazareth have been woven.&lt;ref&gt;Van Biema, David; Ostling, Richard N.; and Towle, Lisa H. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,984367-1,00.html "The Gospel Truth?"]. ''Time'' magazine. April 8, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a member of the [[Jesus Project]].

Price questioned the historicity of Jesus in a series of books, including ''Deconstructing Jesus'' (2000), ''The Incredible Shrinking Son of Man'' (2003), ''Jesus Is Dead'' (2007) and ''The Christ-Myth Theory and Its Problems'' (2011), as well as in contributions to ''The Historical Jesus: Five Views'' (2009), in which he acknowledges that he stands against the majority view of scholars, but cautions against attempting to settle the issue by appeal to the majority.{{sfnp|Price|2009|pp=61ff}} Price notes that "consensus is no criterion" for the historicity of Jesus.{{refn|group=q|name="Price.2009.61"}}

In ''Deconstructing Jesus'', Price points out that "the Jesus Christ of the New Testament is a composite figure", out of which a broad variety of historical Jesuses can be reconstructed, any one of which may have been the real Jesus, but not all of them together.{{sfnp|Price|2000|pp=15–16}} According to Price, various Jesus images flowed together at the origin of Christianity, some of them possibly based on myth, some of them possibly based on "a historical Jesus the Nazorean".{{sfnp|Price|2000|p=86}} Price admits uncertainty in this regard, writing in conclusion: "There may have been a real figure there, but there is simply no longer any way of being sure".{{sfnp|Price|2000|p=261}}{{refn|group=q|name="Price.Quest"}}

According to Price, the accounts of Jesus are derived from Jewish writings,{{Refn|name="Price.scripture"}} which show Greek influences and similarities with Pagan saviour deities. Christianity is a historicized synthesis of mainly Egyptian, Jewish, and Greek mythologies.{{refn|1={{harvp|Price|2009|pp=55ff}}
* Also see Robert M. Price's review of ''Christ in Egypt: The Horus-Jesus Connection''.&lt;ref name="Christ in Egypt"/&gt;}} Price maintains that there are three key points for the traditional Christ myth theory:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Price|2009}}
# There is no mention of a miracle working Jesus in secular sources. (p. 62)
# The epistles, which were written before the gospels, do not evidence a recent historical Jesus. (p. 63)
# The Jesus story shows strong parallels to other Mediterranean religions that were also based on gods that died and rose again. (p. 75)&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is no mention of a miracle-working Jesus in secular sources.
* The epistles, written earlier than the gospels, provide no evidence of a recent historical Jesus and all that can be taken from the epistles, Price argues, is that a Jesus Christ, son of God, lived in a heavenly realm, there died as a sacrifice for human sin, was raised by God and enthroned in heaven.
* The Jesus narrative is paralleled in Middle Eastern myths about dying and rising gods. Price names [[Baʿal#Deities called Baʿal and Baʿalath|Baal]], [[Osiris]], [[Attis]], [[Adonis]] and [[Tammuz (deity)|Dumuzi/Tammuz]] as examples, all of which, he writes, survived into the Hellenistic and Roman periods and thereby influenced early Christianity. Price alleges that Christian apologists have tried to minimize these parallels.&lt;ref name=Price62&gt;{{harvp|Price|2009}}{{bulleted list|See p. 55 for his argument that it is quite likely Jesus did not exist. |See pp. 62–64, 75 for the three pillars}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BeilbyEddy2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Darrell L.

Price}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing accounts that have Jesus being crucified under [[Alexander Jannaeus]] (83 BC) or in his 50s by [[Herod Agrippa I]] under the rule of [[Claudius]] (AD 41–54). Price argues that these "varying dates are the residue of various attempts to anchor an originally mythic or legendary Jesus in more or less recent history".{{sfnp|Price|2009|pp=80–81}}

=== Thomas L. Thompson ===
[[Thomas L. Thompson]] (born 1939), Professor emeritus of theology at the [[University of Copenhagen]], is a leading [[Biblical minimalism|biblical minimalist]] of the Old Testament.{{refn|group=q|name="Casey2014"}} According to Thompson, the accounts of Jesus are derived from Jewish writings.{{sfnp|Thompson|2012}} In his 2007 book ''The Messiah Myth: The Near Eastern Roots of Jesus and David'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Messiah Myth |publisher= Penguin Books Australia|url=https://penguin.com.au/books/the-messiah-myth-9780712668439|website=penguin.com.au|accessdate=May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson argues that the biblical accounts of both King David and Jesus of Nazareth are mythical in nature and based on Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Babylonian and Greek and Roman literature. For example, he argues that the resurrection of Jesus is taken directly from the story of the dying and rising god, [[Dionysus]].{{refn|group=q|name="Thompson.Messiah.Myth"}}{{refn|group=q|name="Ehrman.2012.p11_15"}} However, Thompson does not draw a final conclusion on the historicity or ahistoricity of Jesus, but argued that any historical person would be very different from the Christ (or Messiah) identified in the Gospel of Mark.{{refn|group=q|name="Thompson.2009.p3"}}

Thompson coedited the contributions from a diverse range of scholars in the 2012 book ''Is This Not the Carpenter?: The Question of the Historicity of the Figure of Jesus''.{{sfnp|Thompson|Verenna|2012|ps=none}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Is This Not the Carpenter?

Neither establishing the historicity of a historical Jesus nor possessing an adequate warrant for dismissing it, our purpose is to clarify our engagement with critical historical and exegetical methods."{{sfnp|Thompson|Verenna|2012|loc=Introduction}}

In a 2012 online article, Thompson defended his qualifications to address New Testament issues and he rejected the label of "mythicist" and reiterated his position that the issue of Jesus' existence cannot be determined one way or the other. Thompson contends that the present state of New Testament scholarship viz. Bart Ehrman "is such that an established scholar should present his Life of Jesus, without considering whether this figure, in fact, lived as a historical person" and that such assumptions "reflect a serious problem regarding the historical quality of scholarship in biblical studies".{{sfnp|Thompson|2012}}

=== Thomas L. Brodie ===
In 2012, the Irish Dominican priest and theologian [[Thomas L. Brodie]] (born 1943), holding a PhD from the [[Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas]] in [[Rome]] and a co-founder and former director of the [[Dominican Biblical Institute]] in [[Limerick]], published ''Beyond the Quest for the Historical Jesus: Memoir of a Discovery''. In this book, Brodie, who previously had published academic works on the Hebrew prophets, argued that the Gospels are essentially a rewriting of the stories of Elijah and Elisha when viewed as a unified account in the [[Books of Kings]]. This view lead Brodie to the conclusion that Jesus is mythical.&lt;ref name="brodie2012"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brodie|first=Thomas L.|year=2012|title=Beyond the Quest for the Historical Jesus: Memoir of a Discovery|publisher=Sheffield Phoenix Press|isbn=978-1-9075-3458-4|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brodie's argument builds on his previous work, in which he stated that rather than being separate and fragmented, the stories of Elijah and Elisha are united and that 1 Kings 16:29–2 Kings 13:25 is a natural extension of 1 Kings 17–2 Kings 8 which have a coherence not generally observed by other biblical scholars.&lt;ref name=brodie2000&gt;{{cite book|last=Brodie|first=Thomas L.|year=2000|title=The crucial bridge: the Elijah-Elisha narrative as an interpretive synthesis of Genesis-Kings and a literary model of the Gospels|location=Collegeville, MN|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=9780814659427|pages=1–3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ittqkiibm0C&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brodie then views the Elijah–Elisha story as the underlying model for the gospel narratives.&lt;ref name="brodie2000" /&gt;

In response to Brodie's publication of his view that Jesus was mythical, the Dominican order banned him from writing and lecturing, although he was allowed to stay on as a brother of the Irish Province, which continued to care for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Beyond the Quest for the Historical Jesus – Official Dominican Response to a Controversial Book|journal=Doctrine and Life|publisher=Dominican Publications|date=May–June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "There is an unjustifiable jump between methodology and conclusion" in Brodie's book—according to Gerard Norton—and "are not soundly based on scholarship". According to Norton, they are "a memoir of a series of significant moments or events" in Brodie's life that reinforced "his core conviction" that neither Jesus nor Paul of Tarsus were historical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barry|first=Cathal|date=April 10, 2014|title=Cleric faces dismissal over claim that Jesus Christ 'did not exist'{{thinsp}} |website= irishcatholic.ie |location=Dublin |publisher=Irish Catholic |url= http://www.irishcatholic.ie/article/cleric-faces-dismissal-over-claim-jesus-christ-did-not-exist |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160412024546/http://www.irishcatholic.ie/article/cleric-faces-dismissal-over-claim-jesus-christ-did-not-exist |archive-date= April 12, 2016 |access-date= April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Richard Carrier ===
[[File:RichardCarrierSM.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Richard Carrier]]]]
American independent scholar{{sfnp|Gullotta|2017}} Richard Carrier (born 1969) reviewed Doherty's work on the origination of Jesus{{sfnp|Carrier|2002}} and eventually concluded that the evidence actually favored the core Doherty thesis.{{refn|group=q|name="Carrier 2014 p614–616"}} According to Carrier, following Couchoud{{refn|group=q|name="Couchoud1926_p23"}} and Doherty, Christianity started with the belief in a new deity called Jesus,{{refn|group=q|name="Carrier.OHJ"}} "a spiritual, mythical figure."{{refn|group=q|name="Doherty.2009.mythical.figure"}} According to Carrier, this new deity was fleshed out in the Gospels, which added a narrative framework and [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]]-like teachings, and eventually came to be perceived as a historical biography.{{refn|group=q|name="Carrier.OHJ"}} According to Carrier, for such a person to be considered "the historical Jesus in any pertinent sense", such a person must comply with his definition of a minimal historical Jesus.{{refn|group=q|name="Carrier.2014.34"}}

According to Carrier, many studies by mainstream scholars have shown that the current consensus of a historical Jesus is based on invalid methods.{{sfnp|Carrier|2014|loc=Chapter 2}}{{efn-lr|name=studies|For example:{{bulleted list |Chris Keith and Anthony LeDonne (eds.), ''Jesus, History and the Demise of Authenticity'' (New York: T. &amp; T.

Carrier argues in his book ''On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt'' that there is insufficient [[Bayesian probability]], that is evidence, to believe in the existence of Jesus. Furthermore, Carrier argues that the Jesus figure was probably originally known only through private revelations and hidden messages in scripture which were then crafted into a historical figure to communicate the claims of the gospels allegorically. These allegories then started to be believed as fact during the struggle for control of the Christian churches of the first century. He argues that the probability of Jesus' existence is somewhere in the range from 1/3 to 1/12000 depending on the estimates used for the computation.{{sfnp|Carrier|2014}}

His methodology was reviewed by Aviezer Tucker, a prior advocate of using [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian techniques]] in history. Tucker expressed some sympathy for Carrier's view of the Gospels, stating: "The problem with the Synoptic Gospels as evidence for a historical Jesus from a Bayesian perspective is that the evidence that coheres does not seem to be independent, whereas the evidence that is independent does not seem to cohere". However, Tucker argued that historians have been able to use theories about the transmission and preservation of information to identify reliable parts of the Gospels. He said that "Carrier is too dismissive of such methods because he is focused on hypotheses about the historical Jesus rather than on the best explanations of the evidence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tucker|first1=Aviezer|title=The Reverend Bayes vs Jesus Christ|journal=History and Theory |date=February 2016 |volume=55:1 |pages=129–140 |doi= 10.1111/hith.10791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the peer-reviewed scholarly [[Journal for the Study of the Historical Jesus]] Daniel N. Gullotta, reviewing Carrier's ''On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt'', says he finds Carrier's arguments "problematic and unpersuasive", his use of Bayesian probabilities "unnecessarily complex" and criticizes Carrier's "lack of evidence, strained readings and troublesome assumptions."  Gullotta also states that there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever, either documentary or archaeological, that there was a period when Christians believed that Jesus only existed in heaven rather than living as a human being on earth, which is Carrier's "foundational" thesis.{{sfnp|Gullotta|2017}}

=== Other modern proponents ===
[[File:John Marco Allegro.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|British academic [[John M. Allegro]]]]
In his books ''[[The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian Myth]]'' (1979), the British archaeologist and philologist [[John M. Allegro]] advanced the theory that stories of early Christianity originated in a [[shamanism|shamanistic]] [[Essene]] clandestine cult centered around the use of [[Psilocybin mushroom|hallucinogenic mushrooms]].&lt;ref&gt;John Allegro, ''The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross'' 1970 {{ISBN|978-0-9825562-7-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Allegro ''The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian Myth'' 1979 {{ISBN|978-0-879-75757-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Meaning323/&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor305&gt;''The Essenes, the Scrolls, and the Dead Sea'' by Joan E.

"Foreword," in Allegro, John M. ''The Dead Sea Scrolls &amp; the Christian Myth''.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=Wv6x5kTHGvsC&amp;pg=PA180 ''Hidden Gospels''].

Using a reverse-translation mechanism, [[Bernard Dubourg]]'s two-volume work in French on the New Testament (1987/1989) argued that the Greek text was originally composed in Hebrew instead of Greek, according to the traditional procedures of midrash. Following Paul Vulliaud, Dubourg emphasized the importance of gematria in showing the coherence of his back-translated text. He concludes that Paul is as mythical as Jesus.

[[Alvar Ellegård]], in ''The Myth of Jesus'' (1992), and ''Jesus: One Hundred Years Before Christ. A Study in Creative Mythology'' (1999), argued that Jesus lived 100 years before the accepted dates, and was a teacher of the Essenes. According to Ellegård, Paul was connected with the Essenes, and had a vision of this Jesus.

Timothy Freke and [[Peter Gandy (author)|Peter Gandy]], in their 1999 publication ''The Jesus Mysteries: Was the "Original Jesus" a Pagan God?'' propose that Jesus did not literally exist as an historically identifiable individual, but was instead a [[Syncretism|syncretic]] re-interpretation of the fundamental pagan "godman" by the [[Gnostic]]s, who were the original sect of Christianity.

Influenced by Massey and Higgins, [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn]] (1880–1963) argued an Egyptian etymology to the Bible that the gospels were symbolic rather than historic and that church leaders started to misinterpret the New Testament in the third century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/~pc93/abbskcth.htm Alvin Boyd Kuhn, Ph.D. A Biographical Sketch of his life and work], by Richard Alvin Sattelberg, B.A., M.S.., 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Author and ordained priest [[Tom Harpur]] dedicated his 2004 book ''[[The Pagan Christ]]'' to Kuhn, suggesting that Kuhn has not received the attention he deserves since many of his works were self-published.{{sfnp|Harpur|2004}} Building on Kuhn's work, Harpur listed similarities among the stories of Jesus, Horus, Mithras, Buddha and others. According to Harpur, in the second or third centuries the early church created the fictional impression of a literal and historic Jesus and then used forgery and violence to cover up the evidence.{{sfnp|Harpur|2004}} Harpur's book received a great deal of [[The Pagan Christ#Criticism and responses|criticism]], including a response book, ''Unmasking the Pagan Christ: An Evangelical Response to the Cosmic Christ Idea''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NwPvu3r6ZzUC |title=Unmasking the Pagan Christ: An Evangelical Response to the Cosmic Christ Idea |last=Porter |first=Stanley E. |last2=Bedard |first2=Stephen J. |date=2006 |publisher=Clements Publishing Group |isbn=978-1-8946-6771-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow mythicist Robert M.

David Fitzgerald has self-published several works in defense of the Christ myth theory, including  ''Nailed: 10 Christian Myths That Show Jesus Never Existed At All'' (2010), and ''Jesus: Mything in Action'', Vols. I–III (2017).

In his 2017 book ''Décadence'', French writer and philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] argued for the Christ myth theory and based his hypothesis on the fact that—other than in the New Testament—Jesus is barely mentioned in accounts of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Waugh |first1=Rob |title=‘Jesus never actually existed at all,’ controversial French author argues |url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/04/12/jesus-never-actually-existed-at-all-controversial-french-author-argues-6571007/ |website=Metro |date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christ myth theory enjoyed brief popularity in the [[Soviet Union]], where it was supported by [[Sergey Kovalev (historian)|Sergey Kovalev]], [[Alexander Kazhdan]], [[Abram Ranovich]], [[Nikolai Rumyantsev (historian)|Nikolai Rumyantsev]] and [[Robert Vipper]].&lt;ref name="Andreev"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://pstgu.ru/download/1430825026.5_andreev_73-88.pdf |title=Дискуссия об историчности Иисуса Христа в советском религиоведении|author=А.

According to Derek Murphy, the documentaries ''[[The God Who Wasn't There]]'' (2005) and ''[[Zeitgeist (film series)#Zeitgeist: The Movie|Zeitgeist]]'' (2007) raised interest for the Christ myth theory with a larger audience and gave the topic a large coverage on the Internet.{{sfnp|Murphy|2011|p=65}} Daniel Gullotta notes the relationship between the organization "Atheists United" and Carrier's work related to Mythicism, which has increased "the attention of the public".{{refn|group=q|name="Gullotta.2015"}}

==== Lack of support for mythicism ====
According to New Testament scholar Bart D. Ehrman, most people who study the historical period of Jesus believe that he did exist and do not write in support of the Christ myth theory.{{sfnp|Ehrman|2012|p=2}}

[[Maurice Casey]], [[theologian]] and scholar of New Testament and early Christianity, stated that the belief among professors that Jesus existed is generally completely certain. According to Casey, the view that Jesus did not exist is "the view of extremists", "demonstrably false" and "professional scholars generally regard it as having been settled in serious scholarship long ago".&lt;ref&gt;Casey, Maurice, ''Jesus of Nazareth: An Independent Historian's Account of His Life and Teaching'' ([[T&amp;T Clark]], 2010), pp. 33, 104, 499.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1977 book ''Jesus: An Historian's Review of the Gospels'', classical historian and popular author [[Michael Grant (author)|Michael Grant]] concluded that "modern critical methods fail to support the Christ-myth theory".&lt;ref name="Grant1977"&gt;Michael Grant (1977), ''Jesus: An Historian's Review of the Gospels''. Charles Scribner's Sons, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; In support of this, Grant quoted [[Roderic Dunkerley]]'s 1957 opinion that the Christ myth theory has "again and again been answered and annihilated by first-rank scholars".&lt;ref&gt;[[Roderic Dunkerley|Dunkerley, Roderic]], ''Beyond the Gospels'' (Penguin Books, 1957) p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he also quoted Otto Betz's 1968 opinion that in recent years "no serious scholar has ventured to postulate the non-historicity of Jesus—or at any rate very few, and they have not succeeded in disposing of the much stronger, indeed very abundant, evidence to the contrary".&lt;ref&gt;Betz, Otto, What Do We Know About Jesus? (SCM-Canterbury Press, 1968) p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same book, he also wrote: {{quote|If we apply to the New Testament, as we should, the same sort of criteria as we should apply to other ancient writings containing historical material, we can no more reject Jesus' existence than we can reject the existence of a mass of pagan personages whose reality as historical figures is never questioned.{{sfnp|Grant19|1995}}}}

R. Joseph Hoffmann, who had created the [[Jesus Project]], which included both mythicists and historicists to investigate the historicity of Jesus, wrote that an adherent to the Christ myth theory asked to set up a separate section of the project for those committed to the theory. Hoffmann felt that to be committed to mythicism signaled a lack of necessary skepticism and he noted that most members of the project did not reach the mythicist conclusion.&lt;ref name=Hoffmann&gt;Hoffmann, R. Joseph. [http://www.bibleinterp.com/opeds/hoffman1044.shtml "Threnody: Rethinking the Thinking behind The Jesus Project"], bibleinterp.com, October 2009, accessed August 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Questioning the competence of proponents ====
Critics of the Christ myth theory question the competence of its supporters.{{refn|group=q|name="Casey2014"}} According to Ehrman: {{quote|Few of these mythicists are actually scholars trained in ancient history, religion, biblical studies or any cognate field, let alone in the ancient languages generally thought to matter for those who want to say something with any degree of authority about a Jewish teacher who (allegedly) lived in first-century Palestine.&lt;ref name="Ehrman_Huffington"/&gt;}}

In a response, Thompson questioned the polemical nature of this qualification, pointing at his own academic standing and expertise. According to Thompson, Ehrman "has attributed to my book arguments and principles which I had never presented, certainly not that Jesus had never existed". Thompson questions Ehrman's qualifications in regard to Old Testamentical writings and research, as well as his competence to recognize the problems involved in "reiterated narrative" and "the historicity of a literary figure", stating that Ehrman had "thoroughly [...] misunderstood [...] the very issue of the historicity of the New Testament figure of Jesus".{{sfnp|Thompson|2012}}

Maurice Casey has criticized the mythicists, pointing out their complete ignorance of how modern critical scholarship actually works. He also criticizes mythicists for their frequent assumption that all modern scholars of religion are Protestant fundamentalists of the American variety, insisting that this assumption is not only totally inaccurate, but also exemplary of the mythicists' misconceptions about the ideas and attitudes of mainstream scholars.{{sfnp|Casey|2014|pp=1–41}}

Questioning the mainstream view appears to have consequences for one's job perspectives.{{efn-lr|See Thomas Verenna, [https://tomverenna.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/goodbye-for-now/ ''Goodbye for now?'']}} According to Casey, Thompson's early work, which "successfully refuted the attempts of Albright and others to defend the historicity of the most ancient parts of biblical literature history", has "negatively affected his future job prospects".{{refn|group=q|name="Casey2014"}} Ehrman also notes that mythicist views would prevent one from getting employment in a religious studies department: {{quote|These views are so extreme and so unconvincing to 99.99 percent of the real experts that anyone holding them is as likely to get a teaching job in an established department of religion as a six-day creationist is likely to land on in a bona fide department of biology.&lt;ref name="Ehrman_Huffington"/&gt;}}

====Opponents====
Few scholars have bothered to criticise Christ myth theories. Robert Van Voorst has written "Contemporary New Testament scholars have typically viewed (Christ myth) arguments as so weak or bizarre that they relegate them to footnotes, or often ignore them completely...The theory of Jesus' nonexistence is now effectively dead as a scholarly question."{{sfnp|Van Voorst|2000|p=6}} [[Paul L. Maier]], former Professor of Ancient History at Western Michigan University and current  professor emeritus in the Department of History there has stated "Anyone who uses the argument that Jesus never existed is simply flaunting his ignorance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Grace |first1=John Patrick |title=Questioning Jesus' existence is sheer madness |url=http://www.herald-dispatch.com/opinion/john-patrick-grace-questioning-jesus-existence-is-sheer-madness/article_2223a091-477e-5f55-a8a8-ee50b372fe9e.html |accessdate=August 7, 2018 |publisher=The Herald-Dispatch |date=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among notable scholars who have directly addressed the Christ myth are Bart Ehrman, Maurice Casey and Philip Jenkins.

=====Bart Ehrman=====
{{Main|Did Jesus Exist? (Ehrman)}}

In this book, [[Bart Ehrman]] surveys the arguments "mythicists" have made against the existence of Jesus since the idea was first mooted at the end of the 18th century. To the objection that there are no contemporary Roman records of Jesus' existence, Ehrman points out that such records exist for almost no one and there are mentions of Christ in several Roman works of history from only decades after the [[death of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=Ehrman&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehrman|first=Bart D,|title=Did Jesus Exist?: The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth|date=2012|publisher=HarperOne|isbn=978-0062206442}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shimron&gt;{{cite news|last=Shimron|first=Yonat|title=In 'Did Jesus Exist?'

=====Maurice Casey=====
In ''Jesus: Evidence and Argument or Mythicist Myths?'' (2014), scholar of New Testament and early Christianity [[Maurice Casey]] treats the historical method, the reliability of the Gospels, the argument from silence from both the Gospels and the Pauline epistles, and the similarities with other religions of the time.{{sfnp|Casey|2014}} According to Casey, many mythicists seem to object to fundamentalist perceptions of Christianity, while ignoring or being ignorant of liberal forms of Christianity.{{sfnp|Casey|2014}}

=====Philip Jenkins=====
[[Philip Jenkins]], Distinguished Professor of History at [[Baylor University]], has written "What you can’t do, though, without venturing into the far swamps of extreme crankery, is to argue that Jesus never existed. The “Christ-Myth Hypothesis” is not scholarship, and is not taken seriously in respectable academic debate. The grounds advanced for the “hypothesis” are worthless. The authors proposing such opinions might be competent, decent, honest individuals, but the views they present are demonstrably wrong....Jesus is better documented and recorded than pretty much any non-elite figure of antiquity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jenkins|first1=Phillip|title=The Myth of the Mythical Jesus|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/anxiousbench/2016/04/the-myth-of-the-mythical-jesus/#IGPQmrQ3pSPteW5M.99|website=patheos.com|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional and Evangelical Christianity===
Alexander Lucie-Smith, Catholic priest and doctor of moral theology, states that "People who think Jesus didn’t exist are seriously confused," but also notes that "the Church needs to reflect on its failure. If 40 per cent believe in the Jesus myth, this is a sign that the Church has failed to communicate with the general public."&lt;ref name=Lucie-Smith&gt;Fr Alexander Lucie-Smith, [http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/commentandblogs/2015/11/02/people-who-think-jesus-didnt-exist-are-seriously-confused/ ''People who think Jesus didn’t exist are seriously confused''], Catholic Herald&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanley E. Porter]], president and dean of [[McMaster Divinity College]] in Hamilton, and Stephen J. Bedard, a Baptist minister and graduate of McMaster Divinity, respond to [[The Pagan Christ|Harpur's ideas]] from an evangelical standpoint in ''Unmasking the Pagan Christ: An Evangelical Response to the Cosmic Christ Idea'', challenging the key ideas lying at the foundation of Harpur's thesis. Porter and Bedard conclude that there is sufficient evidence for the historicity of Jesus and assert that Harpur is motivated to promote "universalistic spirituality".{{sfnp|Porter|Bedard|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NwPvu3r6ZzUC&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 69]}}{{efn-lr|See also Stephen J.

And that furthermore, in early Christian belief this same angel deviates from Philo's account, per Phil 2:5–11; 1 Cor 15 with an incarnation, death, burial and resurrection taking place just below the moon (cf. the same, per the death and resurrection of Osiris), which identifies Christianity as distinct from Judaism.{{sfnp|Carrier|2014|pp=200–205}}

* While others fled cities, Christians stayed in urban areas during plague, ministering and [[Beatitudes|caring for the sick]].
* Christian populations grew faster because of the prohibition of [[abortion]], [[birth control]] and [[infanticide]]. Since infanticide tended to affect female newborn more frequently, early Christians had a more even sex ratio and therefore a higher percentage of childbearing women than pagans.
* To the same effect, women were valued higher and allowed to participate in worship leading to a high rate of female converts.
* In a time of two epidemics (165 and 251) which killed up to a third of the whole population of the [[Roman Empire]] each time, the Christian message of redemption through sacrifice offered a more satisfactory explanation of why bad things happen to innocent people. Further, the tighter social cohesion and mutual help made them able to better cope with the disasters, leaving them with less casualties than the general population. This would also be attractive to outsiders, who would want to convert. Lastly, the epidemics left many non-Christians with a reduced number of interpersonal bonds, making the forming of new one both necessary and easier.
* Christians did not fight against their persecutors by open violence or guerrilla warfare, but willingly went to their [[martyrdom]] while praying for their captors, which added credibility to their [[evangelism]].}}

&lt;ref name="Mythotype"&gt;The concept of the "Mythic Hero" as an archetype was first developed by Lord Raglan in 1936.  It is a set of 22 common traits that he said were shared by many heroes in various cultures, myths and religions throughout history and around the world. Raglan argued that the higher the score, the more likely the figure's biography is mythical. Raglan did not categorically deny the historicity of the Heroes he looked at, rather it was their common biographies he considered as nonhistorical (see [[Rank-Raglan mythotype]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The most extreme legendary-Jesus theorists, however—particularly the Christ myth theorists—deny this. They argue that nothing in Paul’s letters indicates that he believed Jesus was a contemporary of his. Rather, they contend, the Jesus of Paul’s theology is a savior figure patterned after similar figures within ancient mystery religions. According to the theory, Paul believed that Christ entered the world at some point in the distant past—or that he existed only in a transcendent mythical realm—and died to defeat evil powers and redeem humanity. Only later was Jesus remythologized [i.e. historicized] as a Jewish contemporary."&lt;/ref&gt;

From there it could mean a group, school, or sect differentiated from others (Acts 5:17; 15:5; 24:5; 26:5; 28:22). By extension, it could speak of a faction (1 Cor. 11:19; Gal. 5:20) or the distinct doctrine of a factional group (Philo, ''Planting'' 34 §151). In other words, “It thus comes to be the αἵρεσις [''hairesis''] (teaching) of a particular αἵρεσις [''hairesis''] (school)” (H. Schlier, TDNT 1:181). Doctrinal and social aspects were tightly bound. But in 2 Pet. 2:1 the author uses it in a pejorative sense: it points to the heretics’ heterodox doctrine (Herm. ''Sim.'' 9.23.5; Ign. ''Eph.'' 6.2; Ign. ''Trall.'' 6.1; H. Schlier, TDNT 1:180–84; MM 13–14; BDAG 27–28). The presence of heresy, therefore, is a contradiction both to apostolic teaching and Christian community.

Paul complains (1 Cor. 1:11–13) of Christian factions which bore the titles ‘of Paul’, ‘of Apollos’, ‘of Cephas’ and — most significant of all — ‘of Christ’. If there was a group at Corinth called ‘those of the Christ’, there may well have been one at Jerusalem called the brethren of the Lord, who would have had no more personal experience of Jesus than Paul himself."

The Gospel image must therefore be inserted into the historical canvas of Palestine in the first century CE, with the help of the works of Flavius Josephus, the Dead Sea Scrolls and early rabbinic literature. Against this background, what kind of picture of Jesus emerges from the Gospels? That of a rural holy man, initially a follower of the movement of repentance launched by another holy man, John the Baptist. In the hamlets and villages of Lower Galilee and the lakeside, Jesus set out to preach the coming of the Kingdom of God within the lifetime of his generation and outlined the religious duties his simple listeners were to perform to prepare themselves for the great event. [...] The reliability of Josephus’s notice about Jesus was rejected by many in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but it has been judged partly genuine and partly falsified by the majority of more recent critics. The Jesus portrait of Josephus, drawn by an uninvolved witness, stands halfway between the fully sympathetic picture of early Christianity and the wholly antipathetic image of the magician of Talmudic and post-Talmudic Jewish literature."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also wrote a number of classic books about the classic wine regions of France in this time. Despite describing himself as semi retired, he published his latest book, ''The Wines of Burgundy'' in March 2008.&lt;ref name="CC" /&gt;

He lives in [[Saint-Bonnet-de-Vieille-Vigne]], between the [[Côte Chalonnaise]] and the [[Mâconnais]].

== Bibliography ==
He is best known for ''Côte d'Or: A Celebration of the Great Wines of Burgundy'', a survey of the most famous wine producing region of Burgundy covering more than 1000 pages, published in 1997.&lt;ref name=wd-coa&gt;{{Cite web|last= Kissack |first= Chris, thewinedoctor.com|title= Wine Books: Clive Coates |url= http://www.thewinedoctor.com/otherresources/coates.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes technical information about the vineyards of the [[Côte-d'Or]], details about [[wine making]] techniques employed by hundreds of different producers and [[wine ratings]] of thousands of wines. The new book from 2008 is effectively a revision of this one, but expanded to include all major wine districts of Burgundy,&lt;!-- Maconnais is missing --&gt; and without the in-depth profile of a selected number of producers in the 1997 book.

Other recent books include ''The Wines of Bordeaux'' (2004) and ''The Great Wines of France'' (2005).

'''Count Franz Philipp von Lamberg''' ({{lang-hu|Lamberg Ferenc Fülöp}}, November 30, 1791 - September 28, 1848) [[Austria]]n soldier and statesman, was born in [[Mór]] ''(Moor),'' [[Hungary]]. He held the military rank of ''Feldmarschallleutnant''.

He entered the third [[Uhlan]] regiment in 1810. He served in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]] (1813–1814). In 1834 he was promoted to the rank of major. After 32 years of military service, in 1842 he was assigned the rank of ''Feldmarschallleutnant''.

In 1848, the circumstance that, as a member of the upper eschelons of the Hungarian nobility, he had been entrusted with Hungarian relations with Austria brought him the difficult, but also distinguished, assignment as imperial commissioner charged with bringing about a peaceful adjustment between the emperor and the people. But before his arrival in [[Budapest|Pest]], [[Lajos Kossuth|Kossuth]] had incited the legislature to forbid his taking office as [[palatine]] of Hungary, and the army was instructed not to obey him. His assignment was without ministerial countersign. After his arrival in Pest, and a short and fruitless discussion with [[Johann Hrabowsky|General Hrabowsky]], he took a cab to a fortification. While crossing the Danube on the pontoon bridge, a mob which had been advised of his arrival fell upon the cab, murdered Lamberg, mutilated the body, and triumphantly carried it, impaled on [[scythe]]s, to the disabled soldiers' home.

Lamberg's death marked a turning point in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]], as the Imperial Court in Vienna decided to dissolve the Hungarian Parliament and send in the troops of [[Josip Jelačić]] into Hungary.

==Family and children==
With Countess Caroline Hoyos, he had at least two children:
* a son, father of Countess Ladislaja von Lamberg;
* Countess Theresia von Lamberg, who married [[Franz, Count of Meran]], and had issue.

'''Echo''' (stylised as '''ECHO''', {{IPA-de|ˈɛço}}) was an accolade by the {{Interlanguage link multi|Deutsche Phono-Akademie|de}}, an association of recording companies of Germany to recognize outstanding achievement in the [[music industry]]. The first ECHO Awards ceremony was held in 1992, and it was set up to honor musical accomplishments by performers for the year 1991, succeeding the [[Deutscher Schallplattenpreis]], which was awarded since 1963.

==Trophy==
The trophy was designed by Oliver Renelt when he was a student at the [[Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg]]. It is stainless steel, and is {{convert|40|cm|in}} tall and weighs {{convert|2|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref name=BZ /&gt; It depicts half a disc with notes flowing into it from a globe, and the design was the winner of a competition held for that purpose.&lt;ref name=bisschen /&gt;

== Controversy ==
The Echo Award was heavily criticized worldwide when [[Farid Bang]] and [[Kollegah]] received the award for best hip hop/urban album in April 2018. The nominated album, ''[[Jung, brutal, gutaussehend 3|Jung, Brutal, Gutaussehend 3]]'' (English: "Young, brutal, handsome 3"), contains the track "0815", in which the artists refer to their muscles as being more defined than those of [[Auschwitz]] inmates. The duo was even allowed to perform this track during the ceremony, despite heavy protests weeks before the award show. 

[[Campino (singer)|Campino]], singer of German punk band [[Die Toten Hosen]], was the first one to criticize the committee's decision during the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/music/news/german-music-business-slammed-anti-semitic-lyric-echo-awards-kollegah-farid-bang-1202758207/|title=German Music Business Slammed Over Anti-Semitic Lyric Controversy at Echo Awards|last=Aswad|first=Jem|date=2018-04-19|work=Variety|access-date=2018-04-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; His remarks received a standing ovation from the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/rappers-kollegah-farid-bang-stir-controversy-at-germanys-biggest-music-awards/a-43367267|title=Rappers Kollegah, Farid Bang stir controversy at Germany's biggest music awards {{!}} DW {{!}} 12.04.2018|last=|first=|website=[[Deutsche Welle|dw.com]]|language=en|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several artists later returned their Echo awards in protest, such as [[Marius Müller-Westernhagen]], who returned all of his seven Echo awards received over the years. Other artists returning their awards were German conductors [[Christian Thielemann]] and [[Enoch zu Guttenberg]], Russian-German pianist [[Igor Levit]], record producer [[Klaus Voormann]], and the Notos Quartett.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8350353/germany-echo-awards-kollegah-farid-bang-lyrics-controversy|title=Germany's ECHO Awards Under Intense Scrutiny After Allowing Rap Duo With Anti-Semitic Lyrics to Win, Perform|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, criticism did not only come from artists and the German press. Several businesses joined in, with [[Tom Enders]], CEO of [[Airbus]], being one of the most recent high-profile commentators, saying that this would hurt "Germany’s international reputation". He also asked if "antisemitism [was] becoming acceptable in Germany" again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/music/news/german-music-business-slammed-anti-semitic-lyric-echo-awards-kollegah-farid-bang-1202758207/|title=German Music Business Slammed Over Anti-Semitic Lyric Controversy at Echo Awards|last=Aswad|first=Jem|date=2018-04-19|work=Variety|access-date=2018-04-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a consequence, the Echo Award was discontinued.&lt;ref name="Billboard End"/&gt;

'''Eugenia''' was the pseudonym used by an unknown English [[pamphleteer]] of the early 18th century, who wrote a work entitled ''The Female Advocate: Or, a plea for the just liberty of the tender sex, and particularly of married women. Being reflections on a late rude and disingenuous discourse, delivered by Mr. John Sprint, in a sermon at a wedding... at Sherburn... By a Lady of Quality'' (London, 1700).

==Sharp riposte==
''The Female Advocate'' (another edition is entitled ''The Female Preacher'') was a powerful [[Protofeminism|protofeminist]] riposte to a sermon by Rev. John Sprint entitled ''The Bride-Woman's Counsellor'' (1699).&lt;ref name="Feminist" &gt; Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy: ''The Feminist Companion to Literature in English. Women Writers from the Middle Ages to the Present Day'' (London: Batsford, 1990), p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; Sprint, who may have been a descendant of the more famous theologian [[John Sprint]] (died 1623), had preached the offending sermon at a wedding at [[Sherborne]], [[Dorset]] on 11 May 1699.&lt;ref&gt;Title page [https://books.google.hu/books/about/The_Bride_woman_s_Counsellor.html?id=tMLPJ-fANfEC&amp;redir_esc=y Retrieved 25 May 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Female Advocate'' was addressed to "To the Honourable The Lady W—ley" and published in 1700 by the same firm that had issued ''The Bride-Woman's Counsellor'' itself.&lt;ref name="Ezell"&gt; Margaret J. M. Ezell: Introduction to ''The Poems and Prose of Mary, Lady Chudleigh'' (1993), p. xxix [https://books.google.hu/books?id=uGQkAe_YuNAC&amp;pg=PR29&amp;lpg=PR29&amp;dq=Eugenia,+the+Lady+of+Quality&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wLUBWR_a8Y&amp;sig=2-bqrdri75HUKcVseGyZ_gFEdmk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiB7tqKp6HbAhWDDOwKHZO9B94Q6AEIUjAK#v=onepage&amp;q=Eugenia%2C%20the%20Lady%20of%20Quality&amp;f=false Retrieved 25 May 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; She signed herself, "Your Ladiship's most obliged and most humble Servant, Eugenia."&lt;ref&gt;Early English Books [https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A32910.0001.001/1:2?rgn=div1;view=fulltext Retrieved 25 May 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unknown identity==
Some commentators at the time of the publication thought that Eugenia was male. Some readers of [[Mary Chudleigh]], meanwhile, were ascribing the work to her. This seems unlikely, as the Eugenia of ''The Female Advocate'' takes a sharp-edged prose approach unlike the lightheartedness of Chudleigh's own.&lt;ref&gt;''The Ladies Defense: Or, the Bride-woman's Counsellor Answer'd. A Poem written as a Dialogue... Written by a Lady''.[https://books.google.hu/books?id=RK5YAAAAcAAJ&amp;source=gbs_book_similarbooks Retrieved 25 May 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Chudleigh's ''Poems'' (1703) include praise for Eugenia's "ingenious Pen".&lt;ref name="Feminist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ezell"/&gt;

Eugenia declares at the outset of her work, "If you inquire who I am, I shall only tell you in general, that I am one that never yet came within the Clutches of a Husband; and therefore what I write may be the more favourably interpreted as not coming from a Party concern'd." She knows some Latin and Greek, and knows the world a little. She states that not even in Italy and Spain do men demand of their wives "a Slavery so abject as this [Sprint] would fain persuade us to."&lt;ref name="Ezell"/&gt;

===Service with the Prince of Wales===
By July 1921, he was serving with the Indian State Forces of Indore.  Metcalfe first met the future Edward VIII when, as Prince of Wales, he was touring India in 1922. Edward was impressed with Metcalfe's knowledge of horses and made him a member of his personal staff, appointing him an aide de camp and subsequently accompanying the prince on his tour of Japan.&lt;ref name="Time06081925 "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,723219,00.html   |title=Milestones: Jun. 8, 1925 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=8 June 1925 |accessdate=2007-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1922, in the wake of the prince's tour, he was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order, 4th class,&lt;ref&gt;''London Gazette'', 11 July 1922&lt;/ref&gt; and in August 1922 was appointed as temporary [[equerry]] to the Prince of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler Philip (2004) "''Metcalfe, Edward Dudley''", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.

He was appointed an Extra [[Aide de camp]] to His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief in India on 4 September 1926 and retired from the Indian Army on 6 September 1927.

After the king abdicated on 11 December 1936 and became the [[Duke of Windsor]], Metcalfe was best man at his wedding in France to [[Wallis Simpson]] on 3 June 1937.  He was his [[equerry]] from 1939 in Paris and Antibes until the German invasion of France in 1940 prompted the Windsors' evacuation and the Duke's appointment to govern the Bahamas.&lt;ref name=Donaldson&gt;{{cite book|last=Donaldson|first=Frances|title=Edward VIII|year=1976|publisher=Futura Publications|location=London|isbn=0860077357|edition=1st Omega}} Donaldson quotes extensively from Metcalfe's letters written home to his wife Baba in England.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Psalmanazar''' (c. 1679 &amp;ndash; 3 May 1763) was a Frenchman who claimed to be the first native of [[Formosa]] (today [[Taiwan]]) to visit Europe. For some years he convinced many in Britain, but he was later revealed to be an impostor and proved fake. He subsequently became a theological essayist, and a friend and acquaintance of [[Samuel Johnson]] and other noted figures in 18th-century literary London.

==Early life==
Although Psalmanazar intentionally obscured many details of his early life, it is believed that he was born in southern France, perhaps in [[Languedoc]] or [[Provence]], to Catholic parents, some time between 1679 and 1684.&lt;ref name="UnivoDel"&gt;[http://www.lib.udel.edu/ud/spec/exhibits/forgery/psalm.htm George Psalmanazar: the Celebrated Native of Formosa] by the Special Collections Department of University of Delaware Library. Last modified 3 November 2003. Accessed 3 November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NativofFormo"&gt;[http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/formosa.html The Native of Formose] by Alex Boese. Museum of Hoaxes. Last modified 2002. Accessed 3 November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; His birth name is unknown.&lt;ref name="UnivoDel"/&gt; According to his posthumously published autobiography, he was educated in a Franciscan school and then a [[Jesuit]] academy. In both these institutions he claimed to have been celebrated by his teachers for what he called "my uncommon genius for languages".&lt;ref&gt;George Psalmanazar, ''Memoirs,'' London, 1764, pg. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, by his own account Psalmanazar was something of a child prodigy. He claims that he attained fluency in Latin by the age of seven or eight, and excelled in competition with children twice his age. Later encounters with a sophistic philosophy tutor made him disenchanted with academicism, however, and he discontinued his education around the time he was fifteen or sixteen.&lt;ref name="NativofFormo"/&gt;

==Career as an impostor==

===Continental Europe===
In order to travel safely and affordably in France Psalmanazar decided to pretend to be an Irish [[pilgrim]] on his way to Rome. After learning English, forging a passport, and stealing a pilgrim's cloak and staff from the reliquary of a local church he set off, but he soon found that many people he met were familiar with Ireland and were able to discern that he was a fraud.&lt;ref name="Lynch"&gt;[http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Papers/psalm.html Orientalism as Performance Art] by Jack Lynch. Delivered 29 January 1999 at the CUNY Seminar on Eighteenth-Century Literature. Accessed 2007 – 3–11.&lt;/ref&gt;
Deciding that a more exotic disguise was needed, Psalmanazar drew upon the missionary reports about East Asia that he had heard of from his Jesuit tutors and decided to impersonate a [[Christianity in Japan|Japanese convert]]. At some point he further embellished this new persona by pretending to be a "Japanese {{linktext|heathen}}" and exhibiting an array of appropriately bizarre customs, such as eating raw meat spiced with [[cardamom]] and sleeping while sitting upright in a chair.

Having failed to reach Rome, Psalmanazar travelled through various [[Holy Roman Empire|German principalities]] between 1700 and 1702. In the latter year he appeared in the Netherlands, where he served as an occasional mercenary and soldier. By this time he had shifted his supposed homeland from Japan to the even more remote [[Formosa]] ([[Taiwan]]), and had developed more elaborate customs, such as following a foreign calendar, worshipping the Sun and the Moon with complex [[propitiation|propitiatory]] rites of his own invention, and even speaking an invented language.

In late 1702 Psalmanazar met the Scottish priest Alexander Innes, who was the chaplain of a Scottish army unit. Afterwards Innes claimed that he had converted the heathen to Christianity and christened him George Psalmanazar (in reference to the biblical Assyrian king [[Shalmaneser V|Shalmaneser]]). In 1703 they left via [[Rotterdam]] for London, where they planned to meet Anglican clergymen.

===England===
[[Image:Psalmamazar Formosa.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Psalmanazar's book]]
When they reached London news of the exotic foreigner with bizarre habits spread quickly and Psalmanazar achieved a high level of fame. His appeal not only derived from his exotic ways, which tapped into a growing domestic interest in travel narratives describing faraway locales, but also played upon the prevailing anti-Catholic and anti-Jesuit religious sentiment of early 18th century Britain. Central to his narrative was his claim to have been abducted from Formosa by malevolent [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] and taken to France, where he had steadfastly refused to become a Catholic. Psalmanazar declared himself to be a reformed heathen who now practised [[Anglicanism]]. He became a favourite of the [[Bishop of London]] and other esteemed members of London society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=GReat Hoaxes of History |newspaper=[[The Pittsburgh Press]] |date=January 18, 1910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building upon this growing interest in his life, in 1704 Psalmanazar published a book, ''An Historical and Geographical Description of Formosa, an Island subject to the Emperor of Japan'', which purported to be a detailed description of Formosan customs, geography and political economy, but which was in fact a complete invention. The "facts" contained in the book are an amalgam of other travel reports, especially influenced by accounts of the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca]] civilisations in the [[New World]], and by embellished descriptions of Japan. [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' may also have served as an inspiration. Some of his claims about Japanese religion seem to also be derived from a misinterpretation of the Chinese idea of [[three teachings]], as he claims that there were three different forms of "idolatry" practiced in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Josephson |first=Jason |title=The Invention of Religion in Japan|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=14-15|location = Chicago|year=2012|url=https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/I/bo13657764.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Psalmanazar, Formosa was a prosperous country with a capital city called Xternetsa. Men walked naked except for a gold or silver plate to cover their genitals. Their main food was a serpent that they hunted with branches. Formosans were [[polygamy|polygamous]] and husbands had a right to eat their wives for infidelity. They executed murderers by hanging them upside down and shooting them full of arrows. Every year they sacrificed the hearts of 18,000 young boys to gods, and their priests [[cannibalism|ate the bodies]]. They used horses and camels for transport, and dwelled underground in circular houses.

===Pseudo-lexicographer===
[[File:Psalmanazar2.jpg|thumb|The Formosan alphabet.]]
Psalmanazar's book also described the Formosan language, an early example of a [[constructed language]]. His efforts in this regard were so convincing that German grammarians included samples of his so-called "Formosan alphabet" in books about language well into the 19th century, even after his larger imposture had been exposed. Here is his "translation" of the [[Lord's Prayer]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Amy Pornio dan chin Ornio vicy, Gnayjorhe
sai Lory, Eyfodere sai Bagalin, jorhe sai domion
apo chin Ornio, kay chin Badi eyen, Amy khatsada
nadakchion toye ant nadayi, kay Radonaye ant
amy Sochin, apo ant radonern amy Sochiakhin,
bagne ant kau chin malaboski, ali abinaye ant tuen
Broskacy, kens sai vie Bagalin, kay Fary, kay
Barhaniaan chinania sendabey. Amien.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Psalmanazar's book was an unqualified success. It went through two English editions, and French and German editions followed. After its publication Psalmanazar was invited to lecture on Formosan culture and language before several learned societies, and it was even proposed that he be summoned to lecture at the [[University of Oxford]].  In the most famous of these engagements he spoke before the [[Royal Society]], where he was challenged by [[Edmond Halley]].

Psalmanazar was frequently challenged by skeptics, but for the most part he managed to deflect criticism of his core claims. He explained, for instance, that his pale skin was due to the fact that the upper classes of Formosa lived underground. Jesuits who had actually worked as missionaries in Formosa were not believed, probably because of anti-Jesuit prejudice.

==Later life==

===Chaplain and theological essayist===
Innes eventually went to Portugal as chaplain general to the British forces. By then, however, he had developed an opium addiction and had become involved in several misguided business ventures, including a failed effort to market decorated fans purported to be from Formosa. Psalmanazar's claims became increasingly less credible as time went on and knowledge of Formosa from other sources began to contradict his claims. His energetic defence of his imposture began to slacken and in 1706 he confessed, first to friends and then to the general public. By then London society had largely grown tired of the "Formosan craze".

In the following years Psalmanazar worked for a time as a clerk in an army regiment until some clergymen gave him money to study theology. Psalmanazar then participated in the literary milieu of [[Grub Street]], writing pamphlets, editing books and undertaking other low-paid and unglamorous tasks. He learned [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], co-authored [[Samuel Palmer (printer)|Samuel Palmer]]'s ''A General History of Printing'' (1732), and contributed a number of articles to the ''Universal History''. He even contributed to ''A Complete System of Geography'' and wrote about the real conditions in Formosa, pointedly criticising the hoax he himself had perpetrated.&lt;ref&gt;George Psalmanazar, ''Memoirs'', London, 1764, pg. 339&lt;/ref&gt; He appears to have become increasingly religious and disowned his youthful impostures. This newfound religiosity culminated in his anonymous publication of a book of theological essays in 1753.

===Friend of Samuel Johnson and others===
Although this last phase of Psalmanazar's life brought him far less fame than his earlier career as a fraud, it resulted in some remarkable historical coincidences. Perhaps the most famous of these is the elderly Psalmanazar's unlikely friendship with the young [[Samuel Johnson]], who was also a Grub Street hack. In later years Johnson recalled that Psalmanazar had been well-known in his neighbourhood as an eccentric but saintly figure, "whereof he was so well known and esteemed, that scarce any person, even children, passed him without showing him signs of respect".&lt;ref&gt;Foley, Frederic J., ''The Great Formosan Impostor''. New York: Privately printed, 1968, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

Psalmanazar also interacted with a number of other important English literary figures of his age. In the early months of 1741 he appears to have sent the novelist [[Samuel Richardson]] an unsolicited bundle of forty handwritten pages in which he attempted to continue the plotline of Richardson’s immensely popular epistolary novel ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded|Pamela]]''. Richardson called Psalmanazar's attempted sequel "ridiculous and improbable".&lt;ref&gt;Foley 53&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[A Modest Proposal]]" [[Jonathan Swift]] ridicules Psalmanazar in passing, sardonically citing "the famous Salamanaazor, a Native of the island of Formosa, who came from thence to London, above twenty Years ago," as an eminent proponent of cannibalism.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Lennard J. Factual Fictions: The Origins of the English Novel. New York: Columbia University Press, 1983, 113&lt;/ref&gt; A novel by [[Tobias Smollett]] refers mockingly to "Psalmanazar, who, after having drudged half a century in the literary mill in all the simplicity and abstinence of an Asiatic, subsists on the charity of a few booksellers, just sufficient to keep him from the parish".&lt;ref&gt;Foley 59&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and memoirs===
In old age Psalmanazar lived on an annual pension of 30 pounds, paid by an admirer.&lt;ref&gt;The Passing Parade – John Doremus – Radio [[2CH]], 21 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In his last years  he wrote his ''Memoirs of ** ** , Commonly Known by the Name of George Psalmanazar; a Reputed Native of Formosa''. The book, which was published posthumously, withholds his real birth name, which is still unknown, but contains a wealth of detail about his early life and the development of his impostures.

Wakeford and his lawyer [[Alan Young (lawyer)|Alan Young]] challenged the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice|Ontario Court's General Division]] for denying him, and other medical marijuana users, the right to use the drug. The [[Harvard University|Harvard]] paleontologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] assisted Wakeford by testifying in the case, arguing that the illicit substance proved invaluable in treating the side effects of his cancer treatments. On September 7, 1998 Wakeford's suit against the government was dismissed. The judge ruled it was up to [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] to overturn the law. In May 1999 the courts ruled that Wakeford could smoke and grow his own marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;Dana Larsen [http://www.cannabisculture.com/articles/1721.html "Canada's med-pot push"] ''[[Cannabis Culture (magazine)|Cannabis Culture]]'' Nov. 13, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CBC.

'''Kunwar Bai Yadav''' (died 23 February 2018)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kunwar Bai, the 106-year-old icon for Swachh Bharat campaign, dies|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/kunwar-bai-the-106-year-old-icon-for-swachh-bharat-campaign-dies/articleshow/63048609.cms|accessdate=24 February 2018|work=The Economic Times|date=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a supposedly 106-year-old woman who lived in a village in [[Dhamtari district]] in the central [[India]]n state of [[Chhattisgarh]]. Inspired by the [[Swachh Bharat Abhiyan]] (Clean India Campaign), she sold seven of her goats to raise the money to build a toilet at her house. In 2016, the district was declared the first in the state to be free of [[open defecation]], and she was declared a mascot of the campaign and visited by [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Narendra Modi]].

==Life==
Yadav lived in Kotabharri, a village in Dhamtari district, Chhattisgarh. The villagers had always defecated in the open, in the forest. In 2015, she heard about toilets for the first time in a presentation at the local school as part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, a campaign to end open defecation by 2 October 2019, the 150th anniversary of the birth of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. 
She sold seven of her two dozen goats, her only available assets, and with the help of a daughter-in-law who works as a day labourer, raised the {{INR}}22,000 to build a toilet at the house she shared with her family. Others in the village followed suit, and, in late 2016, the district became officially free of open defecation, the first district in the State to achieve this.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{Cite news |author=Geeta Pandey |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-37799425|title=How a 105-year-old ended open defecation in her village |date=2016-11-01 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Meghan Werft |url=https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/105-year-old-woman-india-build-toilets/ |title=Indian Woman, 105, Sold 7 Goats to Build a Toilet, Sparks Massive Change |publisher=Global Citizen |date=2016-11-01 |accessdate=2016-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Remini's early television roles was on ''[[Who's the Boss?]]'' as Charlie Briscoe, which led to a spin-off series entitled ''[[Living Dolls]]'', in which Remini starred with [[Halle Berry]]. The show premiered in late 1989 and ran for 12 episodes before being canceled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenrush.co.uk/features/television/feature-18440035/?page=7 "Throwing a Curveball: Surprising Spin-Offs"].

===''The Talk''===
Remini was a co-host on ''[[The Talk (TV series)|The Talk]]'', a CBS talk show which premiered October 18, 2010. [[Julie Chen]], [[Sara Gilbert]], [[Holly Robinson Peete]], and [[Sharon Osbourne]] were her co-hosts. The show is similar to ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' and seeks to address motherhood and contemporary issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/455932-CBS_The_Talk_to_Premiere_Oct_18.php |title=CBS' ''The Talk'' to Premiere Oct. 18|first=Andrea|last=Domanick|date=August 11, 2010 |publisher=Broadcasting and Cable}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remini drew criticism within the first week of the show's debut, accused of being too loud, brash, and obtrusive. It was stated on one episode that she had received a significant amount of negative Twitter feedback on this subject. Remini addressed the issue, stating she refused to change who she is and asserting that thousands of fans like her for who she is. Her co-hosts supported her response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/thedishrag/2010/10/the-talk-lets-talk-what-did-you-think.html|title='The Talk': Let's talk ... what did you think? – Pop2it&amp;nbsp;– Zap2it|publisher=Blog.zap2it.com|date=October 18, 2010|accessdate=January 17, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021223735/http://blog.zap2it.com/thedishrag/2010/10/the-talk-lets-talk-what-did-you-think.html|archivedate=October 21, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While co-hosting ''The Talk'', Remini turned down various parts on situation comedies, stating that any new role would make her feel as if she were cheating on Doug Heffernan, her character's husband on ''The King of Queens''.

In August 2013, it was disclosed that Remini had filed a missing person report with the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] concerning Shelly Miscavige, the wife of Scientology leader [[David Miscavige]], who had not been seen in public since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/leah-remini-files-missing-person-602723|title=Leah Remini Files Missing Person Report for Scientology Leader David Miscavige's Wife|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=August 8, 2013| accessdate=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the report was filed, the Los Angeles Police Department looked into the matter, met with and spoke with her before closing the investigation and stating Remini's report was "unfounded". The Church said in a statement that the whole affair was simply harassment and a publicity stunt for Remini.&lt;ref&gt;Blankstein, Andrew.

In October 2013, it was reported that Remini had been subpoenaed to testify in a [[Comal County, Texas]], lawsuit against the Church of Scientology and its leader David Miscavige, regarding acts of alleged harassment and surveillance against the wife of a former member, Monique Rathbun (who was married to ex-Scientology executive [[Mark Rathbun]]). Rathbun's attorney, Ray Jeffery, says he wants Remini, a former Scientologist, to give a [[Deposition (law)|deposition]] in the hopes she could testify that Miscavige has vast influence over the operations of the church and had to have known about the alleged harassment.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"/&gt;

Remini released her memoir ''Troublemaker: Surviving Hollywood and Scientology'' on November 3, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Leah Remini Speaks Exclusively to ABC News About Her Experience with the Church of Scientology|url = http://abcnews.go.com/Press_Release/leah-remini-speaks-exclusively-abc-news-experience-church/story?id=34009807|publisher = ABC News|date = September 24, 2015|accessdate = October 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2015 interview with ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine, Remini stated that she was embracing [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and found comfort in the religion's practices, contrasting her experiences with Scientology.&lt;ref name="pmag"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://people.com/books/leah-remini-talks-embracing-catholicism-after-scientology/|title=Leah Remini on embracing Catholicism after Scientology: 'To me it's what religion is supposed to be'|magazine=People|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|date=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6550">There have been many '''[[Falkner Island Light]] keepers''' throughout the history of the lighthouse. The Falkner Island Lighthouse is a [[lighthouse]] in [[Connecticut]], United States, off [[Guilford, Connecticut|Guilford]] Harbor on [[Long Island Sound]]. The [[lighthouse]] was constructed in 1802 and commissioned by President [[Thomas Jefferson]], warning of dangerous shoals and shallows in the area. Falkner Island Light is the second oldest extant lighthouse in Connecticut and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

'''Liu Gang''' (born 30 January 1961) is a Chinese [[scientist]] and [[revolutionary]] who founded the [[Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation]]. He was a prominent student leader at the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tiananmen's Most Wanted |url=http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/03/tiananmens-most-wanted/ |author=Andrew Jacobs |date=June 3, 2014|publisher= New York Times|accessdate=June 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liu holds a M.A. in physics from [[Peking University]] and a M.A. in [[computer science]] from [[Columbia University]]. After his exile to the United States in 1996, Liu studied technology and physics at [[Bell Labs]] in [[New Jersey]]. Liu was employed at [[Morgan Stanley]] as a [[Wall Street]] IT analyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=From China's Prisons To Columbia's Computers |url=http://engineering.columbia.edu/web/newsletterarchive/archive/engnews_s98/liu.html |publisher=Columbia University |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612000554/http://engineering.columbia.edu/web/newsletterarchive/archive/engnews_s98/liu.html |archivedate=June 12, 2010|accessdate=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Student activist ==
As an undergraduate student at [[University of Science and Technology of China]] in [[Hefei]], Liu met [[Fang Lizhi]], a pro-democracy activist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Guilt by Association: More Documents from the Chinese Trials. News from Asia Watch. P.2 |url=https://www.hrw.org/campaigns/china/scholars/t15/China0791.PDF |date=July 25, 1991 |publisher= News from Asia Watch |accessdate=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, at [[Peking University]], Liu organized "Democracy Salons". Wang Dan later held a position there.

Liu was a 28-year-old graduate when the 1989 demonstrations began. He organized the [[Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation]] and joined the movement's organizing body. As a result, he was sixth on a list of twenty-one activists whose arrests were ordered by the government. Liu went into hiding as a fugitive, but on 15 June 1989, Liu was arrested and charged with attempted subversion of the [[Communist Party of China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/21/world/china-arrests-another-student-leader.html?action=click&amp;module=Search&amp;region=searchResults&amp;mabReward=relbias%3As&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes.com%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%23%2FLIU%2BGANG%2F |title=China Arrests Another Student Leader |author=Nicholas D.

== Scientific research ==

=== China ===
In 1982, Liu received a bachelor's degree in modern mechanics from the [[University of Science and Technology of China]]. He was employed by the [[Aviation Industry Corporation of China]] in [[Shenyang]] in the field of [[aerodynamics]]. He worked in partnership with [[Luo Yang (aircraft designer)|Luo Yang]], and was promoted to head of [[aircraft design process|aircraft design]]. Liu's field of research was the theory of [[air resistance]], and he worked on problems of double-sided entry and [[radar]] technology.

In 1984, Liu received a master's degree in [[optics]] from the Department of Physics at [[Peking University]] in [[Beijing]]. While there, he was an assistant teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduce of the China’s 21 "Most Wanted" following Tiananmen Square Massacre|url=http://chinadailymail.com/2013/06/13/chinas-21-most-wanted-following-tiananmen-square-massacre/|date=June 13, 2013|publisher=China Daily Mail|accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liu returned to work at the China Soft Science Research Institute but was also acting assistant director at the University of Science and Technology of China.

In 1988, Liu became an assistant and associate researcher at the Wear-Resistant Materials Development Company of the National Ministry of Higher Education &amp; the [[Dalian Institute of Technology]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} He was then transferred to research in the Department of Physics at the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]].

=== United States ===
In 1996, Liu received a master's degree in computer science from Columbia University. He was invited to speak at the [[New York Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wang Dan Press Conference Statement |url=http://www.hrichina.org/en/content/2773|date=April 23, 1998|publisher=Human Rights in China|accessdate= July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liu gained employment as a member of technical staff (MTS) at the Mathematics of Networks and Systems Research Department at Bell Laboratories in [[Murray Hill, New Jersey|Murray Hill]], New Jersey. There he worked on [[Optical telecommunication]] network design and planning, [[routing]] [[algorithms]], [[optimization]] techniques, and [[economic model]]s and [[strategy]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduce of Gang Liu|url=http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/who/gang/index.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140806081009/http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/who/gang/index.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=August 6, 2014|publisher=Bell's Lab|accessdate=July 10, 2016 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Liu's areas of research included: SPIDER, a design tool for fast-restoration in all-optical networks; VPNStar, a system for provisioning multi-service [[VPNs]] with [[Quality of service]] guarantees over [[Internet Protocol]]; in software design, a management system for Lambda Router in all-optical networks; and analysis of [[Internet]] pricing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Active Research Projects of Gang Liu|url=http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/gang/proj.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140806081005/http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/gang/proj.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-08-06|publisher=Bell's Lab}} &lt;/ref&gt;

During his days at Bell Laboratories, Liu introduced the A*Prune (1999, {{ISSN|0743-166X}}) with K. G. Ramakrishnan, to describe a new class of [[Algorithm]]. This opened a new research direction in [[theoretical science]]. He found that A*Prune is comparable to the current best known-approximate algorithms for most randomly generated [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]]. The algorithm constructs paths, starting at the source and going towards the destination. But, at each iteration, the [[algorithm]] is rid of all paths that are guaranteed to violate the constraints, thereby keeping only those partial paths that have the potential to be turned into feasible paths, from which the [[optimal]] paths are drawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A*Prune: An Algorithm for Finding K Shortest Paths Subject to Multiple Constraints|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2370289_A*Prune_An_Algorithm_for_Finding_K_Shortest_Paths_Subject_to_Multiple_Constraints|date=August 2001|publisher=Research Gate|accessdate=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liu also proposed a special class of Optical devices called SPIDER (2001, {{ISSN|1089-7089}}); optical routers, dense [[wavelength division multiplexing]] (DWDM) systems, and cross-connects of unprecedented capacities. Liu and his colleagues are developing techniques for efficient and reliable [[Optical telecommunication|optical network]] design, covering decentralized dedicated protection to shared path-based mesh restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=R.

Since 2011, Liu had been involved in a bitter divorce with his former wife, the judge presided the case had declared him mentally unstable, and appointed a custodian guardian to represent him against his wish; among Liu's accusations: his wife was a spy sent by Chinese Communist central committee to monitor him, and his ex-employer Morgan Stanley fired him to appease Chinese government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Torment of Tiananmen|url=https://nypost.com/2011/08/07/torment-of-tiananmen/|publisher= New York Post|accessdate=August 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Louisa Nécib Cadamuro''' ({{IPA-fr|luiza neˈsib}}; born 23 January 1987) is a retired [[List of France women's international footballers|French women's international footballer]]. She spent the majority of her career at [[Olympique Lyonnais (ladies)|Lyon]], amassing eighteen titles with the French club over a nine-year span. She played as a [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|central attacking midfielder]] and is described as a "gifted [[playmaker]]" who "possesses superb technique".&lt;ref name="necib_fifa"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=108/edition=10292/news/newsid=105580.html | title = Necib following in famous footsteps | date = 26 August 2006 | work = [[FIFA|Fédération Internationale de Football Association]] | accessdate = 11 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nécib is also known for her "elegant possession, sublime passing skills, and cultured touch on the ball".&lt;ref name="necib_cbc"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/fifawomensworldcup2011/blog/2011/07/more-to-come-from-louisa-necib.html | title = More to come from Louisa Necib | date = 14 July 2011 | work = [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] | accessdate = 11 September 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has been labeled by the French media as "the female [[Zinedine Zidane|Zidane]]" – like Zinedine Zidane, she has Algerian ancestry, grew up in Marseille and possesses immense skill, especially as a playmaker with an eye for goal. As such, she has been nicknamed "Ziza", a variant of Zidane's "Zizou".&lt;ref name="necib_fifa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="necib_marseille"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.lefigaro.fr/sport/2009/03/07/02001-20090307ARTFIG00224-louisa-necib-gracieuse-en-talons-et-en-crampons-.php | title = Louisa Necib, gracieuse en talons et en crampons | date = 16 March 2009 | work = Le Figaro | accessdate = 11 June 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.lesdessousdusport.fr/louisa-necib-la-zidane-du-foot-feminin-3426 | title = Louisa Necib, la "Zidane" du foot féminin | date = 16 February 2009 | work = Les dessous du sport | accessdate = 11 June 2011 | language = French | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120909014539/http://www.lesdessousdusport.fr/louisa-necib-la-zidane-du-foot-feminin-3426 | archivedate = 9 September 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="necib_20minutes"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.20minutes.fr/article/750209/louisa-necib-itineraire-enfant-balle | title = Louisa Necib, itinéraire d'une enfant de la balle | date = 29 June 2011 | work = 20 Minutes | accessdate = 11 September 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with FIFA.com just before the [[2012 Olympics soccer|2012 Olympics]], she alluded to the comparison, saying, "Zidane is a role model for me. He was always the player that I most enjoyed watching. The comparison was made frequently when I was starting out, and now, as the years pass, it happens less and less often. But I wouldn't say I’m tired of it." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.fifa.com/womensolympic/news/newsid=1578093 | title = Nécib: Zidane is my role model | date = 1 February 2012 | work = FIFA.com | accessdate = 28 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She often attempts to downplay the comparison, though, stating "Being compared to Zidane is really nice, but I don’t think it can harm me because I’ve been hearing it since I was very young. It always makes me proud, but as I always say, I don’t think you can compare anyone to him. He's unique".&lt;ref name="necib_ray"/&gt; While training at the Clairefontaine academy in 2004, Nécib met Zidane, who was at the training center in preparation for [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying for the 2006 World Cup]] (the finals would eventually be his last act as a professional). The two players exchanged shirts, and the shirt Nécib acquired from Zidane is currently in the possession of her father.&lt;ref name="necib_federation"/&gt;

Nécib began her football career playing for local youth clubs in her hometown of [[Marseille]], such as Union Sportive Marseille and Celtic de Marseille. With the latter club, she made her senior team debut in 2003 and, in the following season, helped the club win the Division 3 Féminine. In 2004, Nécib was selected to attend [[CNFE Clairefontaine]], the women's section of the Clairefontaine academy. She spent two years at the training center, and in 2006, departed for [[Montpellier HSC (Ladies)|Montpellier]] of the [[Division 1 Féminine]]. In her only season with Montpellier, Nécib helped the team win the 2006–07 edition of the [[Challenge de France]]. After departing Montpellier, she joined [[Olympique Lyonnais (Ladies)|Lyon]]. Since joining the club, Nécib has won a slew of trophies, which include four league titles, one Challenge de France, and one [[UEFA Women's Champions League]] title. For her performances during the [[2008–09 Division 1 Féminine|2008–09 season]], she was named the [[National Union of Professional Footballers]] (UNFP) [[Trophées UNFP du football#Player of the Year 3|Female Player of the Year]].

Nécib is a former French women's youth international having represented her nation at all levels for which she was eligible. At under-19 level, she played on the teams that reached the [[2004 UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship|2004]] and [[2005 UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship|2005]] editions of the [[UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship]]. With the under-20 team, Nécib played at the [[2006 FIFA U-20 Women's World Championship]] scoring a goal in the group stage against [[Argentina women's national football team|Argentina]] as France reached the quarter-finals. Prior to playing in the U-20 Women's World Cup, Nécib made her senior international debut in February 2005 in a friendly match against [[Norway women's national football team|Norway]]. Two years later in March 2007, Nécib scored her first senior international goal in a [[UEFA Women's Euro 2009 qualifying]] victory over [[Greece women's national football team|Greece]]. She has participated in five major international tournaments for her country; the [[UEFA Women's Euro 2005|2005]] and [[UEFA Women's Euro 2009|2009]] editions of [[UEFA Women's Euro]] and the [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup|2011]] and [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup]] and the [[2012 Summer Olympics]]. In the latter competition, Nécib acted as the [[playmaker]] and contributed to the team that finished in fourth place.

==Personal life==
Nécib was born on 23 January 1987 in the city of [[Marseille]] to parents of [[Algeria]]n origin. Her father had emigrated to France from [[Biskra]], while her mother had come from [[Oran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.lebuteur.com/entretien/actualites/louisa-necib-la-zidanette-de-france | title = Louisa Necib la Zidanette de France | date =  | work = Le Buteur | accessdate = 11 June 2011 | language = French | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120321094324/http://www.lebuteur.com/entretien/actualites/louisa-necib-la-zidanette-de-france | archivedate = 21 March 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nécib was raised in Busserine, a quartier located in the northern suburbs of the [[14th arrondissement of Marseille]] and has a brother and sister.&lt;ref name="necib_marseille"/&gt; After signing with Lyon, Nécib enrolled at the [[Claude Bernard University Lyon 1|Université Lyon 1]] with hopes of completing her undergraduate studies in ''Sciences et techniques des activités physiques et sportives'' (STAP) ({{lang-en|Science and Technology of Sport and Physical Activity}}).&lt;ref name="necib_marseille"/&gt; She developed an interest in [[Association football|football]] at a young age, prior to which she trained in [[gymnastics]].&lt;ref name="necib_laprovence2"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.laprovence.com/article/tous-sports-188 | title = Coupe du monde: Louisa Necib, la "Zidane du foot féminin"? | date = 13 July 2011 | work = La Provence | accessdate = 9 September 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; She, initially, did not look at the future prospects of women's football and played mainly for recreation with males stating "I'd always played with the boys in my neighborhood" and "I didn't plan to join a club because, to be honest, I didn't know girls' teams existed. Then, one day I found out there was a club in the 14th arrondissement and I signed up".&lt;ref name="necib_fifa"/&gt;

In June 2016, she married footballer [[Liassine Cadamuro]]-Bentaïba.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Louisa-necib-mon-meilleur-souvenir-c-est-mon-mariage/702981|title=Louisa Necib: "Mon meilleur souvenir, c'est mon mariage"|trans-title=Louisa Necib: "My best memory, my marriage"|work=[[L'Équipe]]|language=French|date=4 July 2016|access-date=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==

===Early career===
{{Quote box | width=30% | align=right | quote= "These comparisons do not bother me. To be compared with ''Zizou'' is a pride. But there is no comparison to make. I am myself." |source= &lt;small&gt; Nécib on the comparisons to [[Zinedine Zidane]].&lt;ref name="necib_laprovence2"/&gt;&lt;/small&gt; }}

Nécib began her career as a youth player for her hometown club Union Sportive de Marseille.&lt;ref name="necib_laprovence1"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.laprovence.com/article/sports-region/football-louisa-necib-la-star-marseillaise-de-lol | title = Football : Louisa Necib, la star marseillaise de l'OL | date = 7 November 2009 | work = La Provence | accessdate = 9 September 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; After spending two years at the club, she signed on with nearby Celtic de Marseille. Nécib spent six months developing in the academy and, in April 2002, she was selected to attend the under-16 female National Cup representing her [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur|region]]. The competition served as a training camp for the Centre National de Formation et d'Entraînement (CNFE) ({{lang-en|National Center for Education and Training}}) located at the [[INF Clairefontaine|Clairefontaine]] academy in [[Clairefontaine-en-Yvelines]]. The initiative to allow women to train at the famous national center came about in the 1990s due to the fact that it had quickly become a high-level training facility for male football players. As a result of allowing female football players to train at the academy, younger women were afforded the same benefits from the facilities offered by Clairefontaine as the men. At the National Cup, Nécib impressed and was given an award by coaches for possessing the best shot of any player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.fff.fr/presentationfff/actualite/22573.shtml | title = Résultats des tests (groupe A) | date = 16 April 2002 | work = [[French Football Federation]] | accessdate = 11 September 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the competition, she returned to Celtic.

At the age of 16, Nécib was promoted to the senior team by coach Yohan Silvy in the latter part of the 2002–03 season.&lt;ref name="necib_laprovence1"/&gt; While at the club, Nécib was teammates with future national teammate [[Caroline Pizzala]]. In the 2003–04 season, Nécib flourished and helped the club reach the Division 3 Féminine league final where they faced the women's team of professional men's club [[Le Mans FC|Le Mans]]. In the tie, Nécib started and played the full match as Celtic cruised to a 4–1 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.statsfootofeminin.fr/journee.php?id=166&amp;numero=0#fiche_match_9899 | title = Finale D3 2003–2004 – 0e journée | date = 13 June 2004 | work = StatsFootoFeminin | accessdate = 9 September 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result promoted the club to the Division 2 Féminine, the second division of French women's football. Nécib's performance that season attracted numerous attention, which resulted in her being nicknamed ''Titou'' as homage to [[Zinedine Zidane]], who is nicknamed ''Zizou''.&lt;ref name="necib_laprovence1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://surfacemagazine.fr/?p=1585 | title = Louisa Necib: Joueuse de l'Olympique Lyonnais et de l'Équipe de France | date = 10 August 2006 | work = Surface Magazine | accessdate = 9 September 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After three years with Celtic, in July 2004, Nécib was selected to attend the CNFE academy at Clairefontaine.&lt;ref name="necib_marseille"/&gt; She initially struggled to adapt at the center admitting "the first year was really hard because I was so far from my family. I almost gave up".&lt;ref name="necib_fifa"/&gt; However, after developing a rapport with future international teammates [[Sarah Bouhaddi]], [[Élodie Thomis]], [[Laure Boulleau]], [[Jessica Houara]], and the aforementioned Pizzala, Nécib quickly returned to the form that got her selected to the center.&lt;ref name="necib_fifa"/&gt; The CNFE academy is allowed participation in the French women's football league system and, from 2002–2007, fielded a team that participated in the Division 1 Féminine. Nécib spent two seasons with the team and made her league debut on 29 August 2004 against [[Olympique Lyonnais (Ladies)|Lyon]]. In the match, she scored the only goal, a 90th-minute winner, in a 1–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.statsfootofeminin.fr/match.php?id=450 | title = 1ère journée – Lyon-CNFE 0–1 | date = 29 August 2004 | work = StatsFootoFeminin | accessdate = 9 September 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nécib finished the campaign with 20 league appearances and six goals. Four of her six goals came in the final four weeks of the season. On 26 March 2005, she scored a double in a 4–2 defeat to [[FCF Juvisy|Juvisy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.statsfootofeminin.fr/match.php?id=554 | title = 19e journée – Juvisy-CNFE 4–2 | date = 26 March 2005 | work = StatsFootoFeminin | accessdate = 9 September 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, she scored the only goal in a win over Olympique Saint-Memmie and, on the final match day of the season, she scored the team's fourth goal in a 5–1 win over Lyon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.statsfootofeminin.fr/match.php?id=560 | title = 20e journée – CNFE-Saint-Memmie 1–0 | date = 3 April 2005 | work = StatsFootoFeminin | accessdate = 9 September 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.statsfootofeminin.fr/match.php?id=576 | title = 22e journée – CNFE-Lyon 5–1 | date = 8 May 2005 | work = StatsFootoFeminin | accessdate = 9 September 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNFE ultimately finished the campaign in 5th-place position. In the following season, Nécib appeared in 18 matches and scored three goals, all of which came in victories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.statsfootofeminin.fr/match.php?id=367 | title = 10e journée – Saint-Memmie-CNFE 0–5 | date = 27 November 2005 | work = StatsFootoFeminin | accessdate = 9 September 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.statsfootofeminin.fr/match.php?id=392 | title = 14e journée – CNFE-Lyon 1–0 | date = 8 January 2006 | work = StatsFootoFeminin | accessdate = 9 September 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Montpellier===
After completing her education and training at Clairefontaine, Nécib returned to the [[Southern France|south of France]] to sign with Division 1 Féminine club [[Montpellier HSC (Ladies)|Montpellier]]. She joined the club alongside former Clairefontaine teammate Thomis and made her debut on 3 September 2006 in a 0–0 league draw with [[Toulouse FC (Ladies)|Toulouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.statsfootofeminin.fr/match.php?id=7 | title = 1ère journée – Montpellier-Toulouse 0–0 | date = 3 September 2006 | work = StatsFootoFeminin | accessdate = 9 September 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; She scored her first goal for the club two weeks later on 17 September converting a double in a 5–0 away win over USCO Compiègne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.statsfootofeminin.fr/match.php?id=17 | title = 3e journée – Compiègne-Montpellier 0–5 | date = 17 September 2006 | work = StatsFootoFeminin | accessdate = 9 September 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 October, Nécib scored the second goal in a 2–0 victory against [[ASJ Soyaux|Soyaux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.statsfootofeminin.fr/match.php?id=23 | title = 4e journée – Montpellier-Soyaux 2–1 | date = 8 October 2006 | work = StatsFootoFeminin | accessdate = 9 September 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, she scored two goals each in wins over FCF Condé-sur-Noireau and [[FCF Hénin-Beaumont|Hénin-Beaumont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.statsfootofeminin.fr/match.php?id=38 | title = 7e journée – Condé-Montpellier 0–4 | date = 12 November 2006 | work = StatsFootoFeminin | accessdate = 9 September 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.statsfootofeminin.fr/match.php?id=47 | title = 8e journée – Montpellier-Hénin-Beaumont 8–0 | date = 19 November 2006 | work = StatsFootoFeminin | accessdate = 9 September 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nécib finished the campaign with 11 league goals, which was third-best on the team behind Thomis and [[Elodie Ramos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.statsfootofeminin.fr/buteuses.php?id=1 | title = Championnat de France de D1 2006–2007 – Classement des buteuses | date =  | work = StatsFootoFeminin | accessdate = 9 September 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Challenge de France]], the women's domestic cup competition in France, Nécib helped Montpellier reach the final where the team faced Lyon.

===Lyon===
Following the season, on 22 June 2007, Lyon officials announced that the club had signed both Nécib and Thomis to contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://nocdn.uefa.com/womenschampionsleague/news/newsid=554631.html | title = Lyon sign 'Zidane' and 'Henry' | date = 22 June 2007 | work = [[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations]] | accessdate = 19 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nécib was handed the number 14 shirt and made her club debut on 2 September 2007 in the team's opening league match of the campaign; a 4–0 win over [[ESOF Vendée La Roche-sur-Yon|La Roche-sur-Yon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.statsfootofeminin.fr/match.php?id=1131 | title = 1ère journée – Lyon-La Roche-sur-Yon 4–0 | date = 2 September 2007 | work = StatsFootoFeminin | accessdate = 9 September 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, she scored her first goal for Lyon converting a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] in a 2–0 win against [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.

During the infancy of the [[2008–09 Division 1 Féminine|2008–09 season]], Nécib was selected to join the new United States-based women's soccer league, [[Women's Professional Soccer]], after her American playing rights were assigned to the [[Washington Freedom]] in the [[2008 WPS International Draft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.potomacsoccerwire.com/news/460/3869 | title = Freedom make trade, chose foreign player targets | date = 24 September 2008 | work = Potomac Soccer Wire | accessdate = 11 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her Lyon teammate [[Sonia Bompastor]] was also assigned to the Freedom.

==Style of play==
{{Quote box | width=30% | align=right | quote= "Louisa is a player that there are few of. What she does, it's not in the textbooks. She is an artist. It's sunny when she touches the ball. She radiates the team." |source= &lt;small&gt;[[France women's national football team|National team]] coach [[Bruno Bini]] on Nécib's style of play.&lt;ref name="necib_20minutes"/&gt;&lt;/small&gt; }}
Nécib primarily plays as an [[attacking midfielder]], but can also be deployed in [[central midfielder|central midfield]] as a [[deep-lying playmaker|deep-lying midfielder]], or as a [[Winger (association football)|winger]]. Domestically, she primarily plays as a [[playmaker]] in the number 10 role, while at international level, she plays as a winger in Bruno Bini's 4–3–3 formation. Two of Nécib's most common exemplary traits are her vision and passing, which have been described as "one-of-a-kind" and "sublime", respectively.&lt;ref name="necib_cbc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.sportsbookgurus.com/news/womens-world-cup-game-preview-germany-a-favorite-over-france | title = Women's World Cup Game Preview: Germany A Favorite Over France | date = 5 July 2011 | work = Sportsbook Gurus | accessdate = 12 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also known for her distinct understanding of the game, which has led to her developing "a great football IQ".&lt;ref name="necib_cbc"/&gt; In addition to her creativity, eye for goal, and tactical awareness, she is known for outstanding control and [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] ability, as well as her elegance on the ball.&lt;ref name="necib_fifa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="necib_cbc"/&gt; Her technical skill and ability to read the game allow her to determine "when to take a defender on one-on-one, how to find a teammate with a slide-rule pass, and how to exploit tight spaces to create scoring chances for herself and her cohorts".&lt;ref name="necib_cbc"/&gt; For these reasons, her playing style has drawn comparisons with compatriot and 1998 World Cup winner Zinedine Zidane.&lt;ref name="necib_laprovence2"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7979">'''Mary Muthoni Nyanjiru''' (died March 16, 1922) was born in Weithaga, Murang'a, although her date or year of birth are not recorded. By 1922, she lived in [[Nairobi]] with her stepdaughter, Elizabeth Waruiru.&lt;ref name="yorku.ca"&gt;[https://cws.journals.yorku.ca/index.php/cws/article/download/6569/5757 "Subsistence Trade Versus World Trade Gendered Class Struggle in Kenya, 1992-2002"], Leigh S. Brownhill and Terisa E. Turner. ''Canadian Woman Studies''/''Les Cahiers de la Femme''. 2002 Spring-Summer; 22(1):169-177. &lt;/ref&gt;  Mary was a Kikuyu woman&lt;ref name="Mamas_Tibbets" /&gt; and a [[Kenya]]n political activist remembered largely for her protest during the Harry Thuku Disturbances that resulted in her death.

== Background ==
Nyanjiru was an associate and supporter of [[Harry Thuku]]. Thuku, secretary and co-founder of the [[Young Kikuyu Association]] (later known as the [[East African Association]])&lt;ref name="Wipper" /&gt; was known throughout Kikuyuland as "chief of women" mainly for his vocal support of women especially around the issue of forced labor. Women recognized him as someone fighting for them to help put an end to the physical and sexual abuse by the colonials and termination of indentured labor.&lt;ref name="Fallon_Book"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fallon |first1=Kathleen M. |title=Democracy and the rise of women's movements in Sub-Saharan Africa |year=2008 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore, MD |isbn=978-0801890086 |http://proxy.library.umkc.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nlebk&amp;AN=308820&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=siteaccess| accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Harry Thuku Disturbances ==
Thuku was arrested on March 14, 1922 over concern for his increasing militancy and the growing number of his supporters.&lt;ref name="Wipper" /&gt;  The day following Thuku's arrest a strike was called by the EAA and thousands peacefully marched to the Nairobi police station, where Thuku was being held. The strikers came to demonstrate and secure his release. After praying for Thuku's safety the crowd dispersed.&lt;ref name="Wipper" /&gt; That evening, women supporters engaged in a practice called oathing, a custom exclusive to men. Oath-taking by women violated Kikuyu tradition as women were considered to be mentally unfit and bodily unable to endure the ordeal of taking oath.&lt;ref name="yorku.ca" /&gt; Elizabeth Waruiru, in her account of the events on the evening of March 15th named James Njorage, a member of the EAA as the oath-giver.&lt;ref name="Wipper" /&gt; Oaths were administered to over 200 women in the crowd, in essence, binding them to execute a specific plan of action.&lt;ref name="yorku.ca" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wipper" /&gt; Historically, tribal oaths were not used by governmental institutions, the EEA was the first to do so. Whether oathing raised their political awareness or a sense of discipline, women acted in unity the following day when it was clear the Thuku would not be freed.&lt;ref name="Wipper" /&gt;
On the morning of March 16th a delegation of six men were chosen from the crowd to meet with Sir Charles Bowring, the Colonial Secretary, who assured them that Thuku was in no danger and was only being detained while waiting for the government to grant him a full hearing. The government hearing would fairly decide Thuku's fate. The delegation was encouraged to return to the crowd to ask them to peacefully disperse. Upon their return, they announced that Thuku was to be tried instead of released, then urged the strikers to go home. As many in the crowd were incensed, this was fruitless.&lt;ref name="Wipper" /&gt; Multiple first-hand accounts tell us it was then that a large group of agitated women were pushing forcefully toward the gate, some shouting at the men that they were cowards and making accusations of bribery to the delegation. Hearing this, the men who had actually started to disperse changed their minds and returned.&lt;ref name="Wipper" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mamas_Tibbets"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tibbetts |first1=Alexandra |title=Mamas Fighting for Freedom in Kenya |journal=Africa Today |date=1994 |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=27–48 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4187015 |accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
“Mary Muthoni Nyanjiru lept to her feet, ran to the front of the crowd, lifted her dress over her head, and cried, "You take my dress and give me your trousers. You men are cowards. What are you waiting for? Our leader is in there. Let's get him."&lt;ref name="Wipper" /&gt; The tactic, called ''guturamira ng’ania'',&lt;ref name="Trouble"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Robertson |first1=Claire C. |title=Trouble Showed the Way: Women, Men, and Trade in the Nairobi Area, 1890-1990 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tNOf1Pg5aGsC&amp;pg=PA244&amp;lpg=PA244&amp;dq=guturamira&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PDJ2IOHR6D&amp;sig=HgvE3O5_ZAHqgA0iXuyGYqmRy-k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwij1K-AnfHeAhXQY98KHc7lBXcQ6AEwAXoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=guturamira&amp;f=false |publisher=Indiana University Press |accessdate=26 November 2018 |language=en |date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; was considered a serious insult among the Kikuyu, who view it as a curse to see a woman the age of one's mother naked; rarely used, it indicates that the authority of men is no longer recognized in the situation, and is considered a powerful symbol of women's defiance.&lt;ref name="owaahh"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Ageless Defiance of Muthoni Nyanjiru - Owaahh |url=https://owaahh.com/ageless-defiance-muthoni-nyanjiru/ |website=Owaahh |accessdate=22 November 2018 |date=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the women present ululated their approval in response, and the crowd surged forward until the police or askaris opened fire.  Nyanjiru was among the first people killed.&lt;ref name="Wipper" /&gt;

== Aftermath ==
The total number of dead is given in various sources as between twenty-eight and over one hundred.&lt;ref name="mau-mau"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Githuku |first1=Nicholas K. |title=Mau Mau Crucible of War: Statehood, National Identity, and Politics of Postcolonial Kenya |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-r9nCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA81|isbn=978-1-4985-0699-1 |publisher=Lexington Books |accessdate=26 November 2018 |language=en |date=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been no evidence that the askaris were ordered to fire by the officers in charge”, though there are accounts stating that the [[askaris]] were on duty for eighteen continuous hours in the heat while being subjected to harassment by the crowd.&lt;ref name="Wipper"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wipper |first1=Audrey |title=Library Login |journal=proxy.library.umkc.edu |date=1989 |volume=59 |url=http://proxy.library.umkc.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=edsjsr&amp;AN=edsjsr.1160230&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site. |accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official number of casualties were given as twenty-one Africans killed, four of whom were women and an additional twenty-eight dead. Thuku's own account of the day, having seen events unfold from his cell, relates that as the police fired from the front, other European settlers who had gathered at the [[Fairmont The Norfolk Hotel|Norfolk Hotel]] began shooting into the crowd from behind.&lt;ref name="Wipper" /&gt;Other accounts concur; settlers were drinking on the veranda of the hotel near the scene and joined in the shooting and were responsible for many of the deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ekechi |first1=Felix K. |title=Perceiving Women as Catalysts |journal=Africa Today |date=1996 |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=235–249 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4187107 |accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael John Kells Fleetwood''' (born 24 June 1947) is a British&lt;!-- as per [[MOS:BIO]] Nationality: the country of which the person was a citizen when the person became notable. Fleetwood, as is noted throughout the article, became notable as a British citizen/musician --&gt; musician and actor, best known for his role as the drummer and co-founder of the [[rock music|rock]] band [[Fleetwood Mac]]. Fleetwood, whose surname was merged with that of the group's [[bass guitar|bassist]] [[John McVie|John "Mac" McVie]] to form the name of the band, was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1998.

Born in [[Redruth]], [[Cornwall]], Fleetwood lived in Egypt and Norway for much of his childhood years as his father travelled with the [[Royal Air Force]]. Choosing to follow his musical interests, Fleetwood travelled to London at the age of 15, eventually combining with [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]], [[Jeremy Spencer]] and [[Bob Brunning]], at Green's behest, to become the first incarnation of Fleetwood Mac. Fleetwood would remain the only member to stay with the band through its ever-changing line-up.

After several album releases and line-up changes, the group moved to the United States in 1974 in an attempt to boost the band's success. Here Fleetwood invited [[Lindsey Buckingham]] and [[Stevie Nicks]] to join. Buckingham and Nicks contributed to much of Fleetwood Mac's later commercial success, including the celebrated album ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'', while Fleetwood's own determination to keep the band together was essential to the band's longevity.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004) p.&amp;nbsp;1–12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brackett (2007) p. xvi–xx.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also enjoyed a solo career, published written works, and flirted briefly with acting and [[vinification]], as well as opened blues-themed restaurants in Alexandria, VA and Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;https://wapo.st/2o6B9Nk&lt;/ref&gt;
{{TOCLimit|3}}

==Early life==
Michael John Kells Fleetwood was born in [[Redruth]], [[Cornwall]], second child to John Joseph Kells Fleetwood and Bridget Maureen (née Brereton) Fleetwood.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;'Susan Fleetwood; Obituary,' ''[[The Times]]'' (2 October 1995), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carroll 14-15"&gt;Carroll (2004) p.&amp;nbsp;14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; His elder sister [[Susan Fleetwood]], who died of cancer in 1995, became an actress.&lt;ref name="carroll 14-15" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/4/Susan-Fleetwood.html | title=Susan Fleetwood Biography (1944–1995) | publisher=Filmreference.com | date=21 September 1944 | accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early childhood Fleetwood and his family followed his father, a [[Royal Air Force]] fighter pilot,&lt;ref name="Evans 21"&gt;Evans (2011) p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; to Egypt. After about six years, they moved to Norway where his father was posted on a [[NATO]] deployment.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He attended school there and became fluent in Norwegian.&lt;ref name="Fleetwood" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fleetwood (1991) p. ?&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographer Cath Carroll describes the young Fleetwood as "a dreamer, an empathetic youth" who, though intelligent, did not excel academically.&lt;ref name="carroll 14-15" /&gt; According to his own autobiography,&lt;ref name="Fleetwood"/&gt; Fleetwood had an extremely difficult and trying time academically at the English boarding schools he attended,&lt;ref name="Evans 21"/&gt; including King's School, Sherborne, Gloucestershire, and [[Wynstones School]], also in Gloucestershire. He performed poorly on exams, which he attributes to his persistent inability to commit facts to memory.&lt;ref name="Fleetwood"/&gt; He nevertheless enjoyed acting during school, often in drag, and was a competent [[fencing|fencer]].&lt;ref name="carroll 14-15" /&gt; At 6'6", he was an imposing figure, and sported a beard and long hair for much of his life. "Mick was very aristocratic," recalls [[Ken Caillat]], a sound engineer on ''Rumours''. "The way he formed sentences was impeccable. When he spoke, everyone stopped and listened. He was quiet and wise, and he had a great sense of humour. He loved to laugh, but he was also a straight shooter."&lt;ref name="Caillat"&gt;Caillat (2012) p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diverting from academic pursuits, Fleetwood took up the drums at a young age, grateful to his parents for their recognition that it was in music that he may find a future and their purchasing for him of a small "Gigster" drum kit when he was thirteen.&lt;ref name="Evans 21"/&gt; His family encouraged his artistic side, his father composed poetry and was an amateur drummer himself.&lt;ref name="Evans 21"/&gt; Fleetwood's early drumming was inspired by [[Cliff Richard]]s' drummer in [[The Shadows]], [[Tony Meehan]], as well as that of the [[Everly Brothers]].&lt;ref name="carroll 14-15" /&gt; With his parents' support, he dropped out of school aged 15; and, in 1963, moved to [[London]] to pursue a career as a drummer.&lt;ref name="Fleetwood"/&gt; At first he stayed with his younger sister Sally in [[Notting Hill]].&lt;ref name="Evans 22-23"&gt;Evans (2011) p.&amp;nbsp;22–23.&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief stint working at [[Liberty (store)|Liberty]] in London, he found his first opportunity in music.&lt;ref name="carroll 14-15" /&gt;

==Career==

===Early efforts in London===
Keyboard player [[Peter Bardens]] lived only a few doors away from Fleetwood's first home in London,&lt;ref name="Evans 22-23"/&gt; and upon hearing of the proximity of an available drummer, Bardens gave Fleetwood his first gig in Bardens' band 'The Cheynes' in July 1963, thus seeding the young drummer's musical career.&lt;ref name="Evans 22-23"/&gt; It would take him from The Cheynes – with whom he supported early gigs by the [[Rolling Stones]] and the [[Yardbirds]] – to stints in [[The Bo Street Runners]], where he replaced original drummer [[Nigel Hutchinson]],&lt;ref name=stuff&gt;{{cite news |first=James|last=Croot |title=Goodbye Pork Pie producer Nigel Hutchinson dies, aged 75 |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/film/90880346/Goodbye-Pork-Pie-producer-Nigel-Hutchinson-passes-away |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |publisher= |date=2017-03-27 |accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had enjoyed brief television fame on ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]''.&lt;ref name="Evans 22-23"/&gt; However, by April 1965, when Fleetwood joined the band, it was fading into obscurity.&lt;ref name="Evans 22-23"/&gt; By February 1966 Bardens, who had left the group, called on Fleetwood to join his new band, the 'Peter Bs', which soon expanded to become '[[Shotgun Express]]' (with [[Rod Stewart]]).

Green became a supportive bandmate who helped Fleetwood in his early experimentation with the drum kit.&lt;ref name="Carroll"&gt;Carroll (2004) p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In his personal life meanwhile, Fleetwood soon became infatuated with model [[Jenny Boyd]], the sister of whom, [[Pattie Boyd]], would be wife to both [[George Harrison]] and [[Eric Clapton]].&lt;ref name="carroll 14-15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thisissurreytoday"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thisissurreytoday.co.uk/Star-interview-Blues-legend-Mick-Fleetwood-comes-Croydon-s-Fairfield-new-band/story-12660331-detail/story.html |title=Star interview: Blues legend Mick Fleetwood comes to Croydon's Fairfield with his new band |publisher=Thisissurreytoday.co.uk |date=15 October 2008 |access-date=20 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927231920/http://www.thisissurreytoday.co.uk/Star-interview-Blues-legend-Mick-Fleetwood-comes-Croydon-s-Fairfield-new-band/story-12660331-detail/story.html |archive-date=27 September 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="contactmusic"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news/fleetwoods-daughter-recovering-after-pool-accident_1074915 |title=Fleetwood Mac – Fleetwood's Daughter Recovering After Pool Accident|publisher=Contactmusic.com |date=21 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was, however, dismissed from the Bluesbreakers for repeated insobriety during gigs.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004) p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Fleetwood and McVie were heavy drinkers, and their combined efforts were too much for Mayall and the band to cope with.&lt;ref name="Evans 22-23"/&gt; Green, feeling trapped within the Bluesbreakers, also left in June 1967. Recalling "his favourite rhythm section, 'Fleetwood Mac'" – Mick Fleetwood and John McVie – Green elected to invite both to join him in his new band, Fleetwood Mac. Though McVie hesitated briefly due to financial reasons, both joined Green by the summer of 1967 with a record contract on the horizon.&lt;ref name="Evans 24"&gt;Evans (2011) p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac===
[[File:Fleetwood mac mick fleetwood 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Fleetwood with Fleetwood Mac, 18 March 1970]]
The initial incarnation of Fleetwood Mac performed its first gig in August 1967 at the seventh annual [[National Jazz and Blues Festival|Windsor Jazz and Blues Festival]], playing a Chicago-style blues.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; McVie, initially hesitant to commit, was later prompted to leave the Bluesbreakers and join Fleetwood Mac full-time when the former adopted a horns section with which he disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004) p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; He replaced the initial bassist, [[Bob Brunning]]. McVie, Fleetwood, Green and guitarist [[Jeremy Spencer]] thus formed the first fixed line-up of Fleetwood Mac.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004) p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The band's first album, ''[[Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac]]'', was released in 1968, and the band toured the United States for the first time, though Green was reluctant to do so for fear of [[gun crime]].&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004) p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon their return, they recorded a second album, ''[[Mr. Wonderful (Fleetwood Mac album)|Mr. Wonderful]]'' under simply "Fleetwood Mac" with Green's name dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004) p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; A guest musician on the album, [[Christine McVie|Christine Perfect]], became close with the group and she and McVie were married in 1968. A third guitarist, [[Danny Kirwan]], was also added to the line-up. Despite the success of their third album, ''[[Then Play On]]'', and a string of hit singles including "[[Albatross (instrumental)|Albatross]]" and "[[Man of the World (song)|Man of the World]]", Green himself drifted away from the band, struggling both creatively and with increasing use of [[LSD]].&lt;ref&gt;Brackett (2007) p.&amp;nbsp;35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; He later joined a Christian religious group.&lt;ref name="Whale-Balanced Career" /&gt;

Fleetwood himself later remarked on the growing stature of Green's difficulties: "I think there is certainly some credence given to the idea that Peter's condition could in some way be blamed on a bad acid trip he had in Germany&amp;nbsp;... I don't think it did him much good."&lt;ref&gt;Brackett (2007) p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; He also recalled in 1995 that "Peter basically ceased to see the light with Fleetwood Mac and had aspirations of playing for nothing in strange places—none of which really happened. He made several interesting albums after he left, then basically took a left turn in terms of his psyche. He pulled out of the mainstream and chose to stay at home. He doesn't play much anymore, which is certainly a shame, because he's my mentor, and he's the reason that Fleetwood Mac became what we became."&lt;ref name="Whale-Balanced Career"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-03-02/entertainment/ca-37910_1_fleetwood-mac | title=Whale-Balanced Career: Though Mick Fleetwood Still Enjoys the Mac, His Blues Band Gives Him Some Freedom | publisher=Los Angeles Times | date=2 March 1995 | accessdate=9 September 2013 | author=Seigal, Buddy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970–1973===
Fleetwood remained a consistent presence in the ever-changing line-up of the group following the departure of Green in May 1970, when Spencer and Kirwan assumed more central roles in the group's song-writing. In June 1970, Fleetwood and Boyd were married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fleetwoodmac.net/penguin/boyd.htm |title=Jenny Boyd |author=Martin Adelson, Lisa Adelson |work=fleetwoodmac.net  |accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=d3hLAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=mick+fleetwood+jenny+remarried+1976&amp;dq=mick+fleetwood+jenny+remarried+1976 |title=Musicians in Tune|author=Jenny Boyd, Holly George-Warren |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|date= 1 May 1992 |accessdate=19 March 2013 |isbn= 978-0-671-73440-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1970 the release of ''[[Kiln House]]'' saw a line-up of Spencer, Kirwan, John McVie and Fleetwood, with Christine McVie providing keyboards and backing vocals.&lt;ref name="kilnhouse"&gt;{{cite AV media notes|others= Fleetwood Mac |title= Kiln House |titlelink= Kiln House |type= CD booklet notes |year= 1970 |publisher= Reprise }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleetwood, "a social creature who prized community and communication", was particularly taken with the group's new living arrangements: they moved into a large [[Victorian era|Victoria-era]] mansion near [[Headley, East Hampshire|Headley, Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004) p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 1971, with Christine Perfect becoming an official member of the band, Fleetwood and the group boarded a plane to [[San Francisco]]. Spencer, fearful following the recent [[1971 San Fernando earthquake]], reluctantly boarded the plane. Having arrived in America, he grew more disillusioned with the group, and unsuccessfully pleaded with Fleetwood to cancel this leg of the tour.&lt;ref name="Fleetwood"&gt;{{cite book | author = Mick Fleetwood | title = Fleetwood–My Life and Adventures with Fleetwood Mac | year = 1990 | publisher = Sidgwick &amp; Jackson Ltd | isbn = 0-283-06126-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the hotel abruptly one evening, and was found later to have joined [[Family International]], then known as Children of God, a [[Religious denomination|religious group]] started in 1968 in [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]], [[California]].&lt;ref name=Beit-Hallahmi&gt;{{Cite book| last =Beit-Hallahmi  | first =Benjamin   | title =The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Active New Religions, Sects, and Cults  | publisher =Rosen Publishing Group  | year =1993 | isbn = 978-0-8239-1505-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once more, Fleetwood attempted to mediate; however Spencer would not return. After Green was asked to return temporarily to help finish the tour, the band met with [[Bob Welch (musician)|Bob Welch]] who would become their next member.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004) p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Their next album, ''[[Future Games]]'', was released later that year. ''[[Bare Trees]]'' came a year later, in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004) p.&amp;nbsp;34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; During the subsequent tours to promote the latter, Fleetwood once more adopted the role of mediator: Kirwan's self-destructive personality and problems with alcohol culminated in a refusal to go on stage before one concert; Fleetwood himself made the decision to fire the band member.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004) p.&amp;nbsp;35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there were early signs of strife in the marriage of John and Christine McVie. Fleetwood again stepped in to mediate between the two members, talking Christine out of a decision to leave the group.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004) p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The band added guitarist [[Bob Weston (guitarist)|Bob Weston]] and vocalist [[Dave Walker]], formerly of [[Savoy Brown]] and [[The Idle Race|Idle Race]]. The resulting turmoil, however, negatively affected their next album, ''[[Penguin (album)|Penguin]]'', released in 1973 to poor reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004) p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Walker was subsequently asked to leave the group, and the next album ''[[Mystery to Me]]'' was received more warmly.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004) p.&amp;nbsp;38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the group's next tour to the United States, Fleetwood discovered that his wife, Boyd, was having an affair with band member Weston. Boyd and Fleetwood had one daughter together at the time. Fleetwood, after wrestling with the idea of leaving the band, was later critical of his own role in "neglecting" his family,"&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004) p.&amp;nbsp;39–40.&lt;/ref&gt; though Caillat described Fleetwood in 2012 as "a womaniser."&lt;ref&gt;Caillat (2012) p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1973 Fleetwood instructed Weston to leave Fleetwood Mac.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004) p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004) p. 109, 121–122.&lt;/ref&gt; Fleetwood and Boyd divorced in late 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Brackett (2007) p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Fleetwood travelled to [[Zambia]] to convalesce, with Christine McVie – who was also suffering marital problems – travelling with him for part of the journey. Meanwhile, manager [[Clifford Davis (music manager)|Clifford Davis]] began to lead a separate group of musicians under the name 'Fleetwood Mac', and his increasing legal assault on the original group pushed Fleetwood and his fellow band members to consider managing themselves. Fleetwood took on more managerial responsibility and leadership over the group.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004) p.&amp;nbsp;40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Davis meanwhile led a 'rebel' tour with a group under the name Fleetwood Mac, which was a failure. While the legal battle raged, Fleetwood applied his skills to a recording project being done in George Harrison's studio; Harrison also contributed to the project. ''[[On the Road to Freedom]]'', a collaboration from [[Alvin Lee]] and [[Mylon LeFevre]] was released in 1973. Also on the project were [[Ron Wood]], [[Steve Winwood]] and [[Jim Capaldi]].

===''Heroes Are Hard to Find'', ''Fleetwood Mac'', ''Rumours''===
[[File:Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham.jpg|right|thumb|Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham on the ''Say You Will'' Tour, 2003]]
By November 1974, despite having survived legal challenges from Davis, Welch departed. His marriage was failing and he felt that he had hit the end of his creative road with the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bob Welch Q&amp;A Session, November 1999|url=http://fleetwoodmac.net/penguin/qa/bobwelch_qa1.htm|publisher=The Penguin: Everything That is Fleetwood Mac|accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleetwood meanwhile was planning a follow-up album to ''[[Heroes Are Hard to Find]]'' – Welch's last with the group – which had charted at 34 in the United States. Fleetwood was shopping with his children when a chance encounter with an old friend led him to visit [[Sound City Studios|Sound City]] and producer [[Keith Olsen]]. While at the studio, Olsen played samples from an album entitled ''[[Buckingham Nicks]]''. Fleetwood immediately "was in awe". Unbeknownst to him, both [[Lindsey Buckingham]] and [[Stevie Nicks]] were working in the studio at the time, though the three did not meet until later.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004) p.&amp;nbsp;64–65.&lt;/ref&gt; On New Year's Eve, 1974, Fleetwood contacted Olsen to advise him that their planned project was on hiatus after Welch's departure, however he then suggested that Nicks and Buckingham join Fleetwood Mac.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004) p.&amp;nbsp;66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; The group ate together at a local restaurant before practising together for the first time in the new studio.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004) p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lindsey Buckingham|url=http://www.fleetwoodmac.net/penguin/lindsey.htm|publisher=Fleetwoodmac.net|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Behind the Music Remastered: Fleetwood Mac|url=http://www.vh1.com/video/behind-the-music-remastered/full-episodes/behind-the-music-remastered-fleetwood-mac/1654105/playlist.jhtml|publisher=VH1|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year the new line-up released ''[[Fleetwood Mac (1975 album)|Fleetwood Mac]]''.

The album proved to be a breakthrough for the band and became a huge hit, reaching No.1 in the US and selling over 5 million copies. Fleetwood and Olsen collaborated on a number of drumming innovations. "It was all about 'plastic puke.' First off, for the kick drum I had Mick use a real skin, not a plastic head. All the bass drum sounds had snap and rack and warmth, but the snare drum on the whole album was a plastic puke."&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004) p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; The album had reached No. 1 come November 1976, and at this time Fleetwood Mac became self-managing, with Fleetwood himself arguing that an external manager would be less apt at holding together such a group of dynamic personalities.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004) p.&amp;nbsp;73–74.&lt;/ref&gt; He put forward an idea of promising to reimburse any losses suffered by promoters should they occur, in an attempt to raise the group's profile and earn more contracts and gigs. "Self-management was the right decision," remembered freelance ''Rolling Stone'' writer John Grissim. "Mick Fleetwood had great leadership skills&amp;nbsp;... had a great deal of experience – nine years. They were business-like, they always delivered the product and had the right lawyers and accountants for the job. They didn't need what Van Morrison called 'pressure mongers,'...&amp;nbsp;they just needed to get on and make a really good album."&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2005) p.&amp;nbsp;79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Ken Caillat, sound engineer on ''Rumours'', concurred that Fleetwood "had superb intuition and a flair for taking risks."&lt;ref&gt;Caillat (2012) p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

As with many musicians during the period in [[Los Angeles]], the band began using copious amounts of [[cocaine]].&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004) p.&amp;nbsp;82–86.&lt;/ref&gt; Fleetwood would go on to recollect in his autobiography that "Until then, Fleetwood Mac hadn't had much experience with this Andean rocket fuel. Now we discovered that a toot now and then relieved the boredom of long hours in the studio with little nourishment."&lt;ref name="FLEETWOOD: My Life and Adventures in Fleetwood Mac - A Review" /&gt; The personal relationships between the band members were becoming frayed. After six months of non-stop touring, the McVies divorced in August 1976, ending nearly eight years of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.closerweekly.com/.../inside-the-complicated-romances-of-fleetwood-mac-...

Fleetwood Mac convened at the Record Plant February 1976 with hired [[audio engineer|engineers]] Ken Caillat and Richard Dashut.&lt;ref name=SOS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/aug07/articles/classictracks_0807.htm|title=Classic Tracks: Fleetwood Mac 'Go Your Own Way'|author=Buskin, Richard|work=[[Sound on Sound]]|date=August 2007|accessdate=30 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most band members complained about the studio and wanted to record at their homes, but Fleetwood did not allow any moves.&lt;ref name=dvd11min&gt;''Classic Albums'', c. 11:50–12:30&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his talent at keeping the group together, the recording of ''Rumours'' was fraught with emotional turmoil due to the collapsing relationships within the line-up. Christine McVie and Nicks decided to live in two condominiums near the city's harbour, while the male contingent stayed at the studio's lodge in the adjacent hills.&lt;ref&gt;''Classic Albums'', c. 31:30–32:55&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Stone (entrepreneur)|Chris Stone]], one of the Record Plant's owners, when the band [[jam (music)|jammed]], recalled that "The band would come in at 7&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;night, have a big feast, party till&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;2 in the morning, and then when they were so whacked-out they couldn't do anything, they'd start recording".&lt;ref name=stone&gt;{{Cite news |title=Bay Area's Plant Marks 25 Years|author=Verna, Paul|work=Billboard|page=45|date=8 November 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleetwood often played his drum kit outside the studio's partition screen to better gauge Caillat's and Dashut's reactions to the music's [[groove (music)|groove]].&lt;ref name=dvda&gt;{{Cite video|people = Fleetwood Mac| title = Making of Rumours| medium = DVD-Audio (''Rumours'')| publisher=[[Warner Bros.

''Rumours'' was a huge commercial success and became Fleetwood Mac's second US number one record, It stayed at the top of the ''Billboard''&amp;nbsp;200 for 31&amp;nbsp;non-consecutive weeks, while also reaching number one in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. The album was certified [[Platinum record|platinum]] in America and the UK within months of release after one&amp;nbsp;million units and 300,000&amp;nbsp;units were shipped respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php |title=RIAA: Gold &amp; Platinum |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] |accessdate=18 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626174049/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php |archivedate=26 June 2007 |df= }} ''Note: User search required.''&lt;/ref&gt; The band and co-producers Caillat and Dashut, would go on to win the 1978 [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]].

===''Tusk'', experimentation===
In November 1977 Fleetwood and Nicks began having an affair.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004) p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nicksfix.com/rs103097.htm |title=Back on the Chain Gang |work=Rolling Stone |author=Fred Schruers |date=30 October 1997 |accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fleetwoodmac-uk.com/timeline/timeline1970s.html |title=Fleetwood Mac Timeline for the 1970s |publisher=fleetwoodmac-uk.com |accessdate=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would continue sporadically for the next two years during the fallout from the end of Fleetwood's relationship with Boyd, until the pair mutually decided to end the affair. "Never in a million years could you have told me that [her affair with Fleetwood] would happen," Nicks later stated. "Everybody was angry, because Mick was married to a wonderful girl and had two wonderful children. I was horrified. I loved these people. I loved his family. So it couldn't possibly work out. And it didn't. I just couldn't."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index_vp.php?id=208&amp;c=18 |title=UnCut Magazine – Five Go Mad|publisher=Bla.fleetwoodmac.net|accessdate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyd and Fleetwood had in fact begun living together once more in 1976, and would remarry temporarily to assist their children with emigration to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004) p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; However they quickly divorced for the second time some months later. In November 1978 Fleetwood moved into a [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]] home with Sara Recor, mutual friend of Fleetwood and Nicks who was at the time married to another music producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/stevie-nicks-love-is-fleeting-for-mein-my-life-as-a-travelling-woman-2302744.html |title=Stevie Nicks: 'Love is fleeting for me&amp;nbsp;... in my life as a travelling woman' |work=The Independent |date=26 June 2011 |accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Fleetwood began working on a charity project to get Fleetwood Mac to tour the [[Soviet Union]], however the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] later made the tour untenable.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004) p.&amp;nbsp;178–179.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Tusk (album)|Tusk]]'', Fleetwood Mac's 12th studio album, was released in 1979. The work represented a more experimental direction taken by Buckingham. Fleetwood, recently diagnosed as having [[diabetes]] after suffering recurring bouts of [[hypoglycemia]] during several live shows,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Martin E. Adelson|url=http://www.fleetwoodmac.net/penguin/mick.htm |title=Mick Fleetwood |publisher=Fleetwoodmac.net |date= |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was again instrumental in maintaining the band's cohesion. He placated Buckingham over feelings of creative claustrophobia and discomfort playing alongside Nicks. On the issue of Buckingham taking creative control away from the other members of the group for the creation of ''Tusk'', Fleetwood recounts that his three-day discussion with Buckingham culminated in him telling the latter that "if it's good, then go ahead."&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004) p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the nature of the album strained relationships again within the band – particularly John McVie, a long-established blues musician who disliked the experimental nature of the album – Fleetwood himself rates the album as his favourite by Fleetwood Mac, and cites the freedom of creative expression allotted to each band member as integral to the survival of the group.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004) p.&amp;nbsp;189–192.&lt;/ref&gt; The album sold four million copies worldwide, a return noticeably poorer than ''Rumours''. Though Buckingham was blamed by the record labels, Fleetwood linked the album's relative failure to the [[RKO General|RKO]] radio chain playing the album in its entirety prior to release, thus allowing mass home taping.&lt;ref&gt;Fleetwood (1991) p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, Fleetwood Mac embarked on a lengthy tour that brought them across America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the UK. The tour lasted from October 1979 to September 1980, consisting of 113 concerts.

===Later career===
[[File:Mick Fleetwood crop.png|thumb|left|Fleetwood in 2009]]
Fleetwood also led a number of side projects. 1981's ''[[The Visitor (Mick Fleetwood album)|The Visitor]]'' produced by [[Richard Dashut]], featured heavy African stylistics and a rerecording of "Rattlesnake Shake" with Peter Green. The song "You weren't in love" was a hit in Brazil because of the Soap-opera Brilliant. In 1983 he formed Mick Fleetwood's Zoo and recorded ''I'm Not Me''. The album featured a minor hit, "I Want You Back", and a cover version of [[the Beach Boys]]' "Angel Come Home". A later version of the group featured [[Bekka Bramlett]] on vocals and recorded 1991's ''Shaking the Cage''. Fleetwood released ''Something Big'' in 2004 with The Mick Fleetwood Band, and his most recent album is ''[[Blue Again!]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanfrancisco.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/prnewswire/press_releases/California/2009/02/12/LA69946 Blue Again press release] ''San Francisco Business Times'', 12 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; appearing in October 2008 with the Mick Fleetwood Blues Band touring to support it, interspersed with the ''Unleashed'' tour of Fleetwood Mac.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102442878 NPR interview] of Mick Fleetwood 28 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

He has played drums on many of his bandmates' solo records, including [[Law and Order (album)|Law and Order]], where he played on the album's biggest hit, [[Trouble (Lindsey Buckingham song)|Trouble]]. Other albums include [[French Kiss (Bob Welch album)|French Kiss]], [[Three Hearts]], [[The Wild Heart (album)|The Wild Heart]], [[Christine McVie (album)|Christine McVie]], Try Me, [[Under the Skin (Lindsey Buckingham album)|Under the Skin]], [[Gift of Screws]], and [[In Your Dreams (album)|In Your Dreams]]. In 2007 he was featured on drums for the song "God" along with [[Jack's Mannequin]] in the Pop album ''[[Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur]]'', a collection of covers of [[John Lennon]] songs.

In literature, Fleetwood co-authored ''Fleetwood – My Life and Adventures with Fleetwood Mac'' with writer Stephen Davis, published by William Morrow &amp; Co. in 1990. In the book he candidly discussed his experiences with other musicians including [[Eric Clapton]], members of [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Led Zeppelin]], as well as the affair with [[Stevie Nicks]] and his [[Substance use disorder|addiction]] to cocaine and his personal bankruptcy.&lt;ref name="Fleetwood"/&gt; Reception was mixed. Robert Waddell of the ''[[New York Times]]'' described the piece as "a blithe, slapdash memoir."&lt;ref name="FLEETWOOD: My Life and Adventures in Fleetwood Mac - A Review"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/18/books/in-short-nonfiction-980490.html | title=FLEETWOOD: My Life and Adventures in Fleetwood Mac – A Review | publisher=The New York Times | accessdate=9 September 2013 | author=Waddell, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/fleetwood-mac/biography | title=Fleetwood Mac | publisher=Rolling Stone | accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''{{'}}s Steve Hochman noted that "Fleetwood tells the story as if he was sitting in your living room, which is good for the intimacy of the tale, but bad for the rambling, sometimes redundant telling."&lt;ref name="la times review"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-12-09/entertainment/ca-8312_1_great-music | title="FLEETWOOD: MY LIFE AND ADVENTURES IN FLEETWOOD MAC" By Mick Fleetwood with Stephen Davis William Morrow &amp; Co | publisher=Los Angeles Times | accessdate=9 September 2013 | author=Hochman, Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hochman did acknowledge that Fleetwood was "one of rock's more colorful characters."&lt;ref name="la times review" /&gt;

Fleetwood has a secondary career as a TV and film actor, usually in minor parts. His roles in this field have included a resistance leader in ''[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]'' and as a guest alien in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[Manhunt (TNG episode)|Manhunt]]". Fleetwood co-hosted the 1989 [[BRIT Awards]], which contained numerous gaffes and flubbed lines. In the wake of this public mishap, the BRIT Awards were pre-recorded for the next 18 years until 2007; the awards are now again broadcast live to the British public. Fleetwood and his third wife, Lynn, had twin daughters (Ruby and Tessa) who were born in 2002.&lt;ref name="thisissurreytoday" /&gt;&lt;ref name="contactmusic" /&gt; He became a U.S. citizen on 22 November 2006.&lt;ref name="Fleetwood"/&gt; Fleetwood filed for divorce from Lynn in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2013/04/10/mick-fleetwood-wife-separate-after-17-years/2070037/|title=Mick Fleetwood, wife separate after 17 years|publisher=Usatoday.com|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing style==
{{quotebox|salign=right|God knows, if the drums aren't right, then the song is not survivable.|source=—Mick Fleetwood&lt;ref&gt;Caillat (2012) p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Fleetwood was a self-taught drummer from his early childhood, after moving from a lacklustre academic performance at school to a love of music encouraged by his family, who bought him his first drum kit.&lt;ref name="carroll 14-15"/&gt; His first years were heavily influenced by [[Tony Meehan]] and the [[Everly Brothers]], and during his formative years in London during the late 1960s, Green helped Fleetwood through bouts of "rhythmic dyslexia" during live performances when Fleetwood panicked and lost the beat.&lt;ref name="Carroll" /&gt; He often sang [[filled pause]]s along to songs to help keep the beat.&lt;ref&gt;Caillat (2012) p.&amp;nbsp;38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Green also instilled in Fleetwood an ability to follow and predict the lead guitarist, enabling him to meet the guitar with the drum rhythm as well as allowing him to know a good guitarist when he saw one – which would in part lead him later in his career to select [[Lindsey Buckingham]].&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004) p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:FleetwoodDrumming1.jpg|thumb|left|Fleetwood drumming in 2013]]

Bob Brunning recalled from his early involvement with Fleetwood Mac that Fleetwood was "very open to playing with different people as long as he didn't have to change his style. He was, and is, a completely straightforward drummer, and it works with a lot of different styles. I don't s'pose [sic] he's played a traditional drum solo in his life!"&lt;ref name="Carroll_a"&gt;Carroll (2004) p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer Carroll highlights this ability as integral to the success of Fleetwood Mac, arguing that Fleetwood was not a virtuoso, but his disciplined and in-distractable manner of play allowed him to hold together a band of strong leading personalities without impinging upon their expression.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004) p.&amp;nbsp;18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caillat, in contrast, cites Fleetwood as "still one of the most amazing drummers I've ever met. He had his rack of tom drums arranged back to front. Most drummers place them from high to low (in pitch) from their left to right, but Mick chose to place his mid, high, low. I think perhaps this helped him develop his unique style. He hit his drums very hard, except for his kick drum. For some reason, when he played his high hat, it distracted him. He would keep perfect beat with his kick, but he played it so softly that we could hear his mouth noises through his kick mic."&lt;ref name="Caillat" /&gt;

==Equipment==
[[File:Fleetwooddrumming2006.jpg|thumb|right|Fleetwood in 2013, surrounded by his extensive drum kit]]
At the age of 15, Fleetwood's parents bought him a [[Rogers Drums|Rogers drum kit]], which helped him land his first gig as a drummer.&lt;ref name="Fleetwood Equipment"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Flans |first1=Robyn |title=Mick Fleetwood - The Power of Fleetwood Mac |url=https://www.moderndrummer.com/article/october-november-1980-mick-fleetwood-power-fleetwood-mac/ |website=Modern Drummer |accessdate=September 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure in Fleetwood Mac, he primarily used [[Ludwig Drums]] for live performances and [[Sonor|Sonor Drums]] in the studio. He specifically sought Ludwig drums for their oversized bass drums and tom-toms.&lt;ref name="Own Way"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fleetwood |first1=Mick |title=Mick Fleetwood Goes His Own Way: Talking Drums: Part One |url=https://www.express.co.uk/comment/expresscomment/477957/Mick-Fleetwood-column-Talking-Drums |website=Express |accessdate=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[Tusk Tour|Tusk tour]], Fleetwood dropped both drum kits from his arsenal in favor of [[Tama Drums]]. He attributed his pivot to Tama to Ludwig's supposed deterioration in quality and Sonar's inability to produce a bass drum suitable for Fleetwood's large frame.&lt;ref name="Fleetwood Equipment"/&gt; From the 90s onwards, Fleetwood has been an endorsee of [[Drum Workshop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwdrums.com/artists/setups.asp |title=Artist Setups – Drum Workshop Inc. – drums, pedals, hardware, dvds, and more! |publisher=Dwdrums.com |date= |accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His drum kit for the [[Say You Will Tour]] was made from wood [[dredging|dredged]] from the bottom of the [[Great Lakes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://gc.guitarcenter.com/interview/mfleetwood/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104012904/http://gc.guitarcenter.com/interview/mfleetwood/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 November 2007|title=Guitar Center Interviews|publisher=Gc.guitarcenter.com|date=|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of his drum shells and hardware are coated in 18 carat gold.&lt;ref name="Own Way"/&gt;

Fleetwood had played [[Paiste]] cymbals from the late 60s to early 90s, favoring their expressiveness and higher frequencies over [[Zildjian]] cymbals.&lt;ref name="Fleetwood Equipment"/&gt; He became dissatisfied with Paiste by 1994 and was added to the Zildjian roster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Artists: Mick Fleetwood |url=https://zildjian.com/artists/mick-fleetwood |website=Zildjian |accessdate=October 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also uses [[Remo]] drumheads, Easton Ahead 5B Light Rock drumsticks and [[Latin Percussion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aln3.albumlinernotes.com/Behind_The_Mask.html |title=Behind The Mask |publisher=Aln3.albumlinernotes.com |date= |accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleetwood has incorporated many percussion instruments into his drum rig, including a 40 inch Zildjian gong, two rows of [[Mark tree|wind chimes]], and congas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Morgenstern |first1=Hans |title=Fleetwood Mac's On With the Show Tour in Miami |url=https://www.miaminewtimes.com/music/fleetwood-macs-on-with-the-show-tour-in-miami-7549342 |website=Miami New Times |accessdate=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Budofsky |first1=Adam |title=Playback:  Mick Fleetwood |url=http://fleetwoodmac-uk.com/articles/FMart139.html |website=FleetwoodMac.uk |publisher=Modern Drummer |accessdate=October 5, 2018 |archivedate=June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Unreferenced|date=July 2008}}
A '''mountain leader''' is a military professional specialising in delivering training for, or leading, operations in high altitude or extremely low temperature environments.

==Mountain leader (UK)==
{{main|Mountain Leader Training Cadre}}

The conduct of warfare in high altitude or arctic environments in the [[British Armed Forces]] is the province of [[3 Commando Brigade]], a formation of the [[Royal Marines]] with a number of attached army elements.  The brigade conducts annual training in the northern regions of [[Norway]] and has been deployed for high altitude operations globally.

Associated with the tasking as the lead force for mountain and Arctic warfare is the existence of the trade specialisation mountain leader (ML).  Each sub-unit within the brigade is complemented with at least one mountain leader who will have undergone training in the Mountain Leader Training Cadre, formerly known as the Mountain and Arctic Training Cadre.

==Mountain leader (US)==
[[File:New Mountain Leader (summer and winter) Logo.jpg|right|thumb|200px|USMC mountain leader]]

Mountain leaders ([[USMC]] and [[US Army]]) have extensive practical experience in a variety of mountain environments in both winter and summer conditions. They have well-developed hazard evaluation and safe route finding skills over all types of mountainous terrain. Mountain leaders are best qualified to advise commanders on all aspects of mountain operations, particularly the preparation and leadership required to move units over technically difficult, hazardous, or exposed terrain. In most cases the mountain leader is the highest level of qualification and is the principle trainer for conducting mountain operations. Mountain warfare instructor experience at a mountain training center or as a member of a special operations forces (SOF) mountain team is critical to the mountain leader development. Below is a list of the additional knowledge and skills expected of mountain leaders. Depending on the specific AO, mountain leaders may need additional over-the-snow mobility skills such as snowshoeing and all-terrain skiing.

*Recognizing and evaluating peculiar terrain, weather, and hazards.
*Preparing route, movement, bivouac, and risk management plans for all conditions and elevation levels.
*Using roped movement techniques on steep snow and ice.
*Performing multi-pitch climbing on mixed terrain (rock, snow, and ice).
*Performing glacier travel and crevice rescue.
*Establishing and operating technical high-angle, multi-pitch rescue and evacuation systems.
*Using winter shelters and survival techniques.
*Leading units over technically difficult, hazardous, or exposed terrain in both winter and summer conditions.

==Other countries==

Some other countries have similar specialists for operating in cold and high altitude environment.

*[[The Netherlands]] - "[[NLMARSOF Mountain leaders]]": The Dutch Royal Marines follow the training with the British Royal Marines.
*[[Germany]] - ''[[heeresbergführer]]''
*[[Italy]] - ''[[guida Alpina militare]]
*[[France]] - ''[[guide de haute montagne militaire]]''

Oba '''Osinlokun''' or '''Eshinlokun''' (died 1829) reigned as [[Oba of Lagos]] from 1821 to 1829 . His father was Oba [[Ologun Kutere]] and his siblings were Obas [[Adele Ajosun|Adele]] and [[Akitoye]], making the Ologun Kutere Obaship line the dominant one in Lagos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mann|first1=Kristin|title=Slavery and the Birth of an African City: Lagos, 1760-1900|publisher=Indiana University Press, 2007|isbn=9780253348845|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Among Osinlokun's children were [[Idewu Ojulari]], [[Kosoko]], and Opo Olu. 

==Ascendancy==
Around 1820 or 1821, Osinlokun seized on the unpopularity of his younger brother Oba Adele, who was frowned upon for the introduction of the [[Egungun|Egun masquerade]], which at the time was seen as unbecoming.&lt;ref name="Smith-dynasty"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Robert|title=The Lagos Consulate, 1851-1861|publisher=University of California Press, 1979|isbn=9780520037465|pages=14–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; by forcibly taking the throne in a violent coup.  Adele was exiled to [[Badagry]] where he assumed headship of the town. While in Badagry, Adele attempted to violently retake the Lagos throne but his efforts were futile.

==Death==
Osinlokun died in 1829 and was succeeded by his son [[Idewu Ojulari]].

{{Unreferenced|date=February 2007}}

[[Image:Pipefitter welder kutzo.jpg|thumb|Welding of steel pipe]]

'''Pipe fitting''' or '''pipefitting''' is the occupation of installing or repairing [[piping]] or [[tube (fluid conveyance)|tubing]] systems that convey liquid, gas, and occasionally solid materials. This work involves selecting and preparing pipe or tubing, joining it together by various means, and the location and repair of leaks.

Pipe fitting work is done in many different settings:
[[HVAC]], [[manufacturing]], [[hydraulics]],  [[refineries]], [[nuclear-powered]] [[supercarrier]]s and [[Virginia class submarine|fast-attack submarines]], [[computer chip]] fabrication plants, [[power plant]] construction, and other [[steam]] systems. Pipe fitters (sometimes called simply "fitters") are represented in the US and Canada by the [[United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry of the United States and Canada]].

[[Pipefitter]]s work with a variety of pipe and tubing materials including several types of steel, copper, iron, aluminium, and plastic.  Pipe fitting is not [[plumbing]]; the two are related but separate trades. Pipe fitters who specialize in fire prevention are called [[Sprinklerfitters]], another related, but separate trade.

Materials, techniques, and usages vary from country to country as different nations have different standards to install pipe.

== Steel pipe ==
[[Steel]] pipe (or '''black iron''' pipe) was once the most popular choice for supply of water and flammable gases. Steel pipe is still used in many homes and businesses to convey [[natural gas]] or [[propane]] fuel, and is a popular choice in fire sprinkler systems due to its high heat resistance.  In commercial buildings, steel pipe is used to convey heating or cooling water to [[heat exchangers]], air handlers, [[variable air volume]] (VAV) devices, or other [[HVAC]] equipment.

Steel pipe is sometimes joined using threaded connections, where tapered threads (see [[National Pipe Thread]]) are cut into the end of the tubing segment, sealant is applied in the form of [[pipe dope|thread sealing compound]] or [[thread seal tape]] (also known as  [[PTFE]] or [[Teflon]] tape), and it is then threaded into a corresponding threaded fitting using two [[pipe wrench]]es.  Beyond domestic or light commercial settings, steel pipe is often joined by [[welding]], or by use of mechanical couplings made by companies such as [[Victaulic]] or Anvil International (formerly Grinnell) that hold the pipe joint together via a groove pressed or cut (a rarely used older practice), into the ends of the pipes.

Other variations of steel pipe include various stainless steel and chrome alloys.  In high-pressure situations these are usually joined by [[Gas tungsten arc welding|TIG]] welding.

In Canada, with respect to natural gas (NG) and propane (LP gas), black iron pipe (BIP) is commonly used to connect an appliance to the supply.  It must however be marked (either painted yellow or yellow banding attached at certain intervals) and certain restrictions apply to which nominal pipe size (NPS) can be put through walls and buildings. With propane in particular, BIP can be run from an exterior tank (or cylinder) provided it is well protected from the weather, and an [[anode]]-type of protection from [[corrosion]] is in place when the pipe is to be installed underground.

== Copper pipe ==
{{main|Copper tubing}}

Copper tubing is most often used for supply of hot and cold water, and as refrigerant line in HVAC systems. There are two basic types of copper tubing, soft copper and rigid copper. Copper tubing is joined using flare connection, compression connection, or solder. Copper offers a high level of resistance to corrosion, but is becoming very costly.

=== Soft copper ===
Soft (or ductile) copper tubing can be bent easily to travel around obstacles in the path of the tubing. While the work hardening of the drawing process used to size the tubing makes the copper hard/rigid, it is carefully [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealed]] to make it soft again; it is therefore more expensive to produce than non-annealed, rigid copper tubing. It can be joined by any of the three methods used for rigid copper, and it is the only type of copper tubing suitable for flare connections. Soft copper is the most popular choice for refrigerant lines in ''split-system'' air conditioners and heat pumps.

==== Flare connections ====
[[Flare fitting|Flare connections]] require that the end of a tubing section be spread outward in a bell shape using a '''flare tool'''. A '''flare nut''' then compresses this bell-shaped end onto a male fitting. Flare connections are a labor-intensive method of making connections, but are quite reliable over the course of many years.

=== Rigid copper ===
Rigid copper is a popular choice for water lines. It is joined using a sweat, compression or crimped/pressed connection. Rigid copper, rigid due to the work hardening of the drawing process, cannot be bent and must use ''elbow fittings'' to go around corners or around obstacles. If heated and allowed to slowly cool, called [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]], then rigid copper will become soft and can be bent/formed without cracking.

==== Soldered connections ====
[[Soldering#Pipe soldering|Solder fittings]] are smooth, and easily slip onto the end of a tubing section. Both the male and female ends of the pipe or pipe connectors are coated with flux to make sure there is no surface oxide and to ensure that the solder will bond properly with the base metal.  The joint is then heated using a [[torch]], and solder is melted into the connection. When the solder cools, it forms a very strong bond which can last for decades. Solder-connected rigid copper is the most popular choice for water supply lines in modern buildings. In situations where many connections must be made at once (such as plumbing of a new building), solder offers much quicker and much less expensive joinery than compression or flare fittings.  The term '''sweating''' is sometimes used to describe the process of soldering pipes.

==== Compression connections ====
[[Compression fittings]] use a soft metal or thermoplastic ring (the compression ring or "ferrule") which is squeezed onto the pipe and into the fitting by a compression nut. The soft metal conforms to the surface of the tubing and the fitting, and creates a seal. Compression connections do not typically have the long life that sweat connections offer, but are advantageous in many cases because they are easy to make using basic tools. A disadvantage in compression connections is that they take longer to make than sweat, and sometimes require retightening over time to stop leaks.

==== Crimped or pressed connections ====
Crimped or pressed connections use special copper fittings which are permanently attached to rigid copper tubing with a powered crimper.  The special fittings, manufactured with sealant already inside, slide over the tubing to be connected.  Thousands of pounds-force per square inch of pressure are used to deform the fitting and compress the sealant against the inner copper tubing, creating a watertight seal.  Advantages of this method are:
*A correctly crimped connection should last as long as the tubing.
*It takes less time to complete than other methods.
*It is cleaner in both appearance and the materials used to make the connection.
*No open flame is used during the connection process.

Disadvantages are: 
*The fittings used are harder to find and cost significantly more than sweat type fittings.
*The fittings are not re-usable. If a design change is required or if a joint is found to be defective or improperly crimped, the already installed fittings must be cut out and discarded. In addition, the cutting required to remove the fitting often will leave insufficient tubing to install the new fitting, So couplers and additional tubing will need to be installed on either side of the replacement fitting. Whereas with a soldered fitting, a defective joint can just be re-soldered, or heated and turned if a minor change is required, or heated and removed without requiring any of the tubing to be cut away. This also allows more expensive fittings like valves to be re-used if they are otherwise in good to new condition, something not possible if the fitting is crimped on.
*The cost of the tooling is very expensive. {{As of |2016}}, a basic toolkit required to sweat solder all the copper pipes of a typical single family residence, including fuel and solder, can be purchased for approximately $200. By contrast, the minimum cost of a basic powered crimping tool starts at around $1800, and can be as high as $4000 for the better brands with a complete set of crimping dies.

== Aluminium pipe ==
[[Aluminium]] is sometimes used due to its low cost, resistance to corrosion and solvents, and its ductility. Aluminium tube is more desirable than steel for the conveyance of flammable solvents, since it cannot create sparks when manipulated. Aluminium tubing can be connected by flare or compression fittings, or it can be welded by the [[Gas tungsten arc welding|TIG]] or [[heliarc]] processes.

==Glass pipe==
Tempered [[glass]] pipes are used for specialized applications, such as [[corrosive]] liquids, medical or laboratory wastes, or [[pharmaceutical]] manufacturing.  Connections are generally made using specialized gasket or O-ring fittings.

==Plastic pipe==

== Occupational hazards ==
Pipe fitters are often exposed to hazardous or dangerous materials, such as [[asbestos]], [[lead]], [[ammonia]], [[steam]], flammable gases, various resins and [[solvent]]s including [[benzene]], and various [[refrigerant]]s. Much progress was made in the 20th century toward eliminating or reducing hazardous materials exposures. Many aspects of hazardous materials are now regulated by law in most countries, including asbestos usage and removal, and refrigerant selection and handling.

Other occupational hazards include exposure to the weather, heavy lifting, crushing hazards, lacerations, and other risks normal to the construction industry.

'''Prince Salvador of Mexico''', also named '''Salvador de Iturbide y Huarte''' (17 July 1820 – 7 June 1856)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalark.net/Mexico/mexico3.htm Royal Ark]&lt;/ref&gt; was the eighth child (and third son) of [[Agustín de Iturbide|Agustín I of Mexico]] and [[Ana María de Huarte y Muñiz|Empress Ana Maria Huarte]]. He was married in 1845 to ''Doña'' María del Rosario de Marzán y Guisasola. His descendants, through his son [[Salvador de Iturbide y de Marzán]], are the current [[First Mexican Empire|pretenders to the Mexican Throne]].

==Biography==
Prince Salvador was two years old when he was created ''Príncipe de México'' (Prince of Mexico) and styled [[Highness]] by the Mexican Congress.

He was educated at [[Collège Sainte-Barbe]], Paris, [[Bourbon Restoration|France]], and in [[Vienna]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]]. 

Salvador was the third in line to the throne, after his brother Ángel de Iturbide y Huarte. When [[Maximilian I of Mexico]] was crowned emperor, he contacted the [[House of Iturbide|Iturbide]] family to ask for the adoption of two boys: His Highness, [[Agustín de Iturbide y Green]], son of Ángel, and His Highness [[Salvador de Iturbide y Marzán]], son of Salvador.

He was drowned in a [[boating]] accident on the [[Tepic River]], [[Nayarit]], on 7 June 1856.

'''Sammy Andre Bossut''' (born 11 August 1985) is a Belgian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[S.V. Zulte Waregem|Zulte Waregem]] in the [[Belgian Pro League]]. 

He was a first team surprise in the [[UEFA Cup 2006–07|2006–07]] [[UEFA Cup]] return against [[Newcastle United]], in [[St James' Park, Newcastle|St James' Park]].

At the end of the [[Belgian First Division 2007–08|2007-08 season]], Zulte Waregem chose not to prolong the contract of [[Geert De Vlieger]], who was until then first choice goalkeeper. Bossut started the last matches of that season to gain more first team experience. Instead of signing a new goalkeeper, Bossut was awarded his spot in the starting eleven for the [[Belgian First Division 2008-09|2008–09 season]].

==International career==
After [[Silvio Proto]] got injured, national manager [[Marc Wilmots]] called up Bossut as potential third goalkeeper for the [[Belgium national football team]] at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref name="Spza180514"&gt;{{cite news | title = Wilmots haalt Bossut bij WK-selectie na blessure Proto | publisher = [[Sporza]] | language = Dutch | date = 18 May 2014 | url = http://www.sporza.be/cm/sporza/voetbal/Rode_Duivels/140518_RD_bossut_opgeroepen | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140518211949/http://www.sporza.be/cm/sporza/voetbal/Rode_Duivels/140518_RD_bossut_opgeroepen | archivedate = 18 May 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bossut played his first game with the national team against [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] on 26 May 2014, but on 4 June FIFA ruled the match unofficial as Wilmots made  7 substitutions while only 6 are allowed in international friendlies.&lt;ref name="HLN040614"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/16076/De-Rode-Duivels/article/detail/1907260/2014/06/04/Debuut-Bossut-en-Januzaj-en-hattrick-Lukaku-zijn-ongeldig.dhtml |title=Debuut Bossut en Januzaj, én hattrick Lukaku zijn ongeldig|language=Dutch |publisher=[[Het Laatste Nieuws]] |date=4 June 2014 |accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Secotans''' were one of several groups of American Indians dominant in the Carolina sound region, between 1584 and 1590, with which English colonizers had varying degrees of contact. Secotan villages included the '''Secotan''', [[Aquascogoc]], [[Dasamongueponke]], [[Pomeiock]] ([[Pamlico]]) and [[Roanoke tribe|Roanoac]].&lt;ref name="Miller2000"&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|2000|pp=265–266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other local groups included the [[Chowanoke]] (including village [[Moratuc]]), [[Weapemeoc]], [[Chesapeake (tribe)|Chesapeake]], [[Pamlico|Ponouike]], [[Neusiok]], and [[Tuscarora people|Mangoak]] (Tuscarora), and all resided along the banks of the [[Albemarle Sound|Albemarle]] and [[Pamlico Sound|Pamlico]] sounds.&lt;ref&gt;Names of geographic features and Native American groups have changed over time. The English knew the Albemarle and Pamlico sounds as the Roanoke Sea. The English knew the location of the Mangoaks, but according to the depositions collected from 1707-1711, the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] initiated the sale of the same lands to the Weapemeoc in 1645. This provides evidence f. Huhyhurfthat the Tuscarora and Mangoak existed as names for the same group of people. Many commonly used tribe names actually refer to individual villages, which existed within tribes. The Secotan tribal area included the villages of both Roanoke and Croatan, though many sources inaccurately refer to theses villages as separate Native American groups. Bernard G. Hoffman, "Ancient Tribes Revisited: A summary of Indian distribution and movement in the North Eastern United States from 1534 to 1779, Parts I-III." ''Ethnohistory'', 14, no. 1 / 2 (1967): 30.&lt;/ref&gt; They spoke [[Carolina Algonquian language]], an Eastern [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language.

== Background ==
In the Carolinas, colonization did not exist as a straight-line transition, from Native American to European rule. A rivalry marked the relationship between the two European powers, the English and the Spanish. Rivalries also existed between the Native American groups. Additionally, the Europeans often found themselves caught in the middle of conflicts, which existed between Native American groups. Each group, European or Native American placed the interest of their group over the interest of all others. The English, the Spanish, and the Native American groups they had contact with each acted against the others, as counter-colonizers of the Carolinas as exhibited through the study of [[Roanoke Island]].

In 1490, prior to England's entry into North American colonialism, the [[Treaty of Medina del Campo (1489)|Treaty of Medina del Campo]] lowered tariffs between England and Spain, and ushered in an era of increased trading between the two countries. The marriage of [[Henry VIII of England]] and [[Catherine of Aragon]] (Spain) sealed the treaty. During this time, many English traders moved to southern Spain, in the area of [[Andalusia]], and trade flourished. In 1533, Spanish officials began to harass the English in Spain, who were required as Englishmen to "swear under oath" that Henry VIII was the head of the church. The requirement of the oath made the Englishmen in Spain subject to persecution, under charges of heresy, by the [[Spanish Inquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul E. Hoffman, ''Spain and the Roanoke Voyages'' (Raleigh: Division of Archives and History; North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources, 1987), 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

To circumvent Spanish officials and the inquisition, English traders devised a system, in which they would travel to Spanish possessions in the [[Caribbean]], to pick up Spanish goods, and take them back to England, with no religious conflicts. By the 1560s, the English faced increasing Spanish hostility. In 1585, the Englishman [[Richard Hakluyt]] published a book, ''Discourse of Western Planting'', which concluded that the English should establish their own colony in the mid-latitudes of North America, to end dependency on Spanish goods, by creating their own supply lines. By April of the same year, [[Sir Richard Grenville]] left England, bound for the Carolina coast, with 100 colonists, which marked the beginning of England's colonial endeavours in America.&lt;ref&gt;Paul E. Hoffman, ''Spain and the Roanoke Voyages'', 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish colonies established the first European colonies in the Carolinas, under the leadership of Spanish captain, [[Juan Pardo (explorer)|Juan Pardo]], in 1567 and 1568. Pardo declared that the [[Catawba people|Catawba]], [[Wateree people|Wateree]], and [[Saxaphaw]] groups were subject to the Spanish crown, and he successfully persuaded the groups to construct housing and make food provisions, which created eleven Spanish settlements in the Carolinas. The Spanish still inhabited the Carolinas when the English arrived.&lt;ref&gt;Marion P. Blackburn, "Spain's Appalachian Outpost". ''Archaeology'' 62, no 4 (2009): 38-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Spanish settled in the interior of the Carolinas, the English arrived on the coast. The placement of a colony at Roanoke marked the first English colonial presence in North America.&lt;ref&gt;David Stick, ''Roanoke Island: The Beginnings of English America'' (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina press, 1983), 30-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Amadas and Barlowe, Secotans and Neiosioke ==

Before the English placed their first settlement on Roanoke Island, Master [[Philip Amadas]] and Master [[Arthur Barlowe]] executed an expedition on ''April 27, 1584'', on behalf of [[Sir Walter Raleigh]], who received an English charter, to establish a colony a month earlier. During their expedition, Barlowe took detailed notes relating to conflicts and rivalries between different groups of Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Paul E. Hoffman, ''Spain and the Roanoke Voyages'', 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; In one such account, [[Wingina]], the ''[[weroance|wereoance]]'' or chief of the Secotans, explained his own tribal history, in relation to a neighboring tribe at the mouth of the [[Neuse River]], the Neusiok, referred to as the Neiosioke by Barlowe. According to Wingina, the Secotans endured years of warfare with the Neiosioke, and "some years earlier," he met with the Neiosioke king, in an effort to ensure a "permanent coexistence." The two leaders arranged a feast between the two groups. An unspecified number of Secotan men and thirty women attended a feast in the town of Neiosioke. The Neiosioke executed an ambush on the Secotans at the feast, and by the time fighting ended, the Neiosioke had "slewn them every one, reserving the women and children only."&lt;ref&gt;Stick, ''Roanoke Island: The Beginnings of English America'', 36, 42, 50-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

In conveying this "inter-tribal" history to Barlowe, Wingina saw an opportunity to advance the interest of the Secotans. Wingina and his people attempted on several occasions to convince the English to join them in devising a surprise attack against the Neiosioke. The Englishmen, uncertain of "whether their perswasion be to the ende they may be revenged of their enemies, or for the love they beare to us," declined to help the Secotans wage war against their rivals. Instead, the English established a trusting relationship with the Secotans, exemplified by the willingness of two Secotan men, Manteo and Wanchese, to accompany Amadas and Barlowe back to England.&lt;ref&gt;Stick, ''Roanoke Island: The Beginnings of English America'', 51-52.&lt;/ref&gt;'''

==Later records==
[[File:North carolina algonkin(2).png|right|thumb|200px|Distribution of [[Carolina Algonquian]] speaking peoples 1657-1795]]
The Secotan remained in the same area until 1644-5, when they were attacked and driven off by colonists from [[Virginia Colony]] during the last of the [[Anglo-Powhatan Wars]]. English settlement in the area began to increase soon afterwards, and it was officially transferred from Virginia Colony to the [[Province of Carolina]] in 1665. In latter years Secotans were recorded under the name [[Machapunga]].&lt;ref&gt;Karen Ordahl Kupperman, Roanoke: The Abandoned Colony&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9042">The '''Sengwer people''' (also known as Cherang'any and previously as Sekker, Siger, Sigerai and Segelai) are an indigenous community who primarily live in the Embobut forest in the western highlands of Kenya&lt;ref&gt;Threats of eviction against indigenous Sengwer people continue in Kenya[[https://redd-monitor.org/2018/02/15/threats-of-eviction-against-indigenous-sengwer-people-continue-in-kenya/#more-29014 online]]&lt;/ref&gt; and in scattered pockets across [[Trans-Nzoia County|Trans Nzoia]], [[West Pokot County|West Pokot]] and [[Elgeyo-Marakwet County|Elgeyo-Marakwet]] counties.&lt;ref&gt;Sengwer Ethnic Minority Peoples[[http://kapolet.tripod.com/id1.html online]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Sengwer are sometimes portrayed as a component of the Marakwet people but are a distinct ethnic grouping. 

==Sirikwa Era==
{{See also|Sirikwa people}}
===Etymology===
{{Quote
|...Once the Cherangany were a powerful race called Sengwer...&lt;ref&gt;Sengwer chief Arap Kamussein at A.C.Hoey’s farm on 2nd October 1932, Sengwer Ethnic Minority Peoples[[http://kapolet.tripod.com/id1.html online]]&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
The Sengwer have in all recorded accounts referred to themselves as such. The Karimajong came to refer to them by the name of the cowrie shell ornament that Sengwer women of the 1700 and 1800's adorned themselves with - a dangling cowrie shell referred to as esigirait, pl. ngisigira in Karimojong. They thus came to be known as Siger, Sigerai, Segelai and Losegelai in some accounts.

===Territory===
At its largest extent, Sengwer territory covered the northern parts of [[Uasin Gishu County|Uasin Gishu]], as well as parts of [[Elgeyo-Marakwet County|Elgeyo-Marakwet]], [[Trans-Nzoia County|Trans Nzoia]] and a southern section of [[West Pokot County|West Pokot]];

{{Quote
|...Commences from Kiporoom River in Uasin Gishu District.  It extends along Kapsumbeywet river through Ziwa (Sirikwa) centre, Moiben Posta and Kose hills in Uasin Gishu.  From Kose hills it goes down to join Moiben river. The boundary goes up river Moiben to the confluence of Ko’ngipsebe and Kimowo streams.  It turns eastwards to cover areas of Maron sub-location in Emboput location in Marakwet District. Turning to the west it then goes to Kamolokon along Marakwet/West Pokot and Marakwet boundary.  From here it drops to Sebit, Somor, then to Kongelai and up along Swom river.  From Swom river to the confluence of Swom and Cheptenden river.  From Cheptenden river to the confluence of Cheptenden river and Moiben river where these two rivers confluence with Kiboorom.
|Sengwer chief Arap Kamussein before the Kenya Land Commission on 2nd October 1932&lt;ref&gt;Sengwer Ethnic Minority Peoples[[http://kapolet.tripod.com/id1.html online]]&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

===Way of Life===
The Sengwer of the Sirikwa era herded a distinctive type of long-horned black cattle, postulated by Lamphear (1994) as being a cervicothoraic-humped Sanga crossbreed.

The most notable element of Siger culture was an adornment of a single cowrie shell attached to the forelock of Siger women, a hairstyle that was also common to the [[Oropom people|Oropom]] who neighbored them to the west and north-west. This dangling cowrie shell was referred to as esigirait, pl. ngisigira and it is from this cultural feature that the Siger are said to have derived their name. 

Divination appears to have played a large role in Siger culture. The confederacy gave rise to the Meturona line of diviners among the Turkana, the Kachepkai diviners of the Pokot and the Talai diviners of the Uas Nkishu Maasai, [[Orkoiyot|the Nandi and Kipsigis]].&lt;ref&gt;Spear, T. and Waller, R. Being Maasai: Ethnicity &amp; Identity in East Africa. James Currey Publishers, 1993, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
Towards the end of the 18th century, a drought captured in folklore as the ''Aoyate'' - the long dry time, struck. It appears that the factors that resulted in famine combined to decimate Siger identity.  

===Famine===
The long-horned cattle that the Sengwer kept did not do very well in the Aoyate drought. The drought decimated the Sengwer herds and the community disintegrated. Many famine refugees who tried to push eastwards died of starvation near Moru Eris though some found refuge with the [[Dassanetch]], [[Pokot people|Pokot]] and [[Karimojong]].&lt;ref&gt;Spear, T. and Waller, R. Being Maasai: Ethnicity &amp; Identity in East Africa. James Currey Publishers, 1993, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Turkana Advances===
To the north; Ateker societies, notably the emerging [[Turkana people|Turkana]], who lived on the borders of Siger territory began encroaching on Siger highland pastures. These societies led a radically different way of life to the Siger, a spartanly pastoral world view based on their early possession of hardy thoraic-humped Zebus that were much more resistant to heat stress, drought and disease. The Turkana had bordered the Siger for some time and their initial interactions had been peaceful though conflict, likely spurred by the drought, developed towards the end of the 18th century.

Large parts of the Siger community, already decimated by the drought, were absorbed into the growing Turkana identity, becoming a territorial section known as ''Siger'' and probably forming several new Turkana clans, including the Siger, Swalika and Ngoleroto clans.&lt;ref&gt;Spear, T. and Waller, R. Being Maasai: Ethnicity &amp; Identity in East Africa. James Currey Publishers, 1993, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Loikop Advances===
{{Main|Loikop people}}

To the East; Rivalry was also developing with the Loikop (also known as 'Kor'), a Maa-speaking alliance that lived in close associations with various Cushitic speakig peoples. Like the Turkana, the Kor kept some of the hardy Zebus which allowed them to withstand the ''Aoyate'' a lot better than the Siger and to absorb members of the community as their society collapsed.

===Segelai Maasai===
South; Some refugees fleeing Turkana advances, raided south into the Uasin Gishu where they were known as Kakesira, and can be associated with the Losegelai (Siger = Sigerai = Segelai) Maasai of the late 19th and early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Spear, T. and Waller, R. Being Maasai: Ethnicity &amp; Identity in East Africa. James Currey Publishers, 1993, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sengwer===
Small numbers of Siger retreated into the forests and into small enclaves among the emerging [[Marakwet people|Marakwet]] society where they retained elements of their identity. The Maasai coined a derogatory term for the Sengwer after they lost their cattle.

}}

==Colonial Period==
By the early 20th century,  

{{Quote

}}

==Recent History==
The Sengwer continues to be a marginalized community that is facing separate and significant threats to both its identity and ancestral lands in the present time.&lt;ref&gt;Forest is our ancestral land, Sengwer community say resisting eviction[[https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2018/01/forest-ancestral-land-sengwer-community-say-resisting-eviction/ online]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sengwer 'hiding in the forest' amid pressure on Kenya to halt evictions, Reuters [[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-landrights-forests/sengwer-hiding-in-the-forest-amid-pressure-on-kenya-to-halt-evictions-idUSKBN1FD2SE online]]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1980, the pressures of population growth of forest dwelling communities in Kenya, among them the Sengwer, came against the governments desire and efforts to conserve the forests. A number of eviction attempts have been carried out since.&lt;ref&gt;Embobut Forest: The only home the Sengwer know, Daily Nation, 6th July 2018 [[https://www.nation.co.ke/lifestyle/travel/Sengwer-community-Embobut-Forest/1950822-4648028-l2n6etz/index.html online]]&lt;/ref&gt;   

On 16 January 2018, Kenya Forest Service officers shot and killed Robert Kirotich Kibor and seriously injured David Kipkosgei Kiptikesi. The Sengwer men were herding their cattle at the time. Both were unarmed.

The following day, the EU suspended funding to its Water Towers Protection and Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Programme.

On 22 January 2018, a court in Eldoret issued an injunction requiring the government to stop the evictions until the Sengwer community's case is heard on 27 February 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Threats of eviction against indigenous Sengwer people continue in Kenya[[https://redd-monitor.org/2018/02/15/threats-of-eviction-against-indigenous-sengwer-people-continue-in-kenya/#more-29014 online]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2830">[[File:Baltic Tribes c 1200.svg|thumb|272px|Map of the Baltic tribes around 1200.]]

'''Skomantas''', or '''Komantas''' (in [[Sudovian language|Yotvingian]] *''Gomants'' or *''Komants'', in [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] ''Komat'', in [[Latin language|Latin]] ''Koommat'', in [[German language|German]] ''Skomand'' and ''Skumand''; ca. 1225(?) – after 1285) was a powerful duke and [[paganism|pagan]] priest of the [[Sudovians]]/[[Yotvingians]], one of the early [[Baltic tribes]] (according to historian S. C. Rowell and some other researchers, this duke of Sudovia seems to be identical to [[Skalmantas (Gediminids)|Skalmantas]], the supposed progenitor of [[Gediminas]]' dynasty, the [[Gediminids]]). He was at the height of his power during the 1260s and 1270s.

Skomantas is first mentioned by [[Peter von Dusburg]] during the [[Great Prussian Uprising]] (1260–1274) as a leader of the 1263 raid on [[Chełmno]], a stronghold of the [[Teutonic Knights]]. He also led campaigns against [[Pinsk]] and other Slavic territories and therefore could not fully support the uprising. After the uprising Skomantas, with help from the [[Lithuanians]], led 4,000 men against the [[Teutonic Knights]]. However, the [[Old Prussians]] and other Balts were losing their power. Skomantas' estate was devastated in 1280–1281 and he escaped with three sons, Rukals, Gedetes and Galms, to [[Black Ruthenia]], controlled at that time by the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. However, he soon returned, was baptized in the [[Roman Catholic]] rite, and acknowledged the superiority of the Knights. Skomantas went on to lead armies on behalf of the Knights and was awarded lands within [[Prussia]]. His tribe lost the fight against the Knights and did not survive as an entity.

'''Tróndur í Gøtu''' ([[Old Icelandic]]: '''Þrándr í Götu''', [[Old Norse]] '''Þrǫ́ndr í Gǫtu''') (ca. 945 &amp;ndash; 1035) was a [[viking]] from the [[Faroe Islands]]. He and  [[Sigmundur Brestisson]] are the central figures in the ''[[Færeyinga saga]]'', which tells the early history of the Faroe Islands and the coming of Christianity to the islands, which Tróndur opposed.

Chapter three of the Saga describes Tróndur as having "a shock head of red hair, and . . . freckled of face and right grim of look", features which were inherent to [[Faroese people|Faroese]], who are said to have descended from Thorstan the Red's daughter.

Tróndur í Gøtu lived on the island of [[Eysturoy]], in his father's home [[Gøta]], which was named for Torbjørn Gøtuskegg's nickname "Gatebeard". Initially Tróndur and his brother Thorlac drew lots to decide who should inherit the estate. After losing, Thorlac went to live in neighbouring islands with his wife. Chapter 35 of the saga tells that all siblings eventually lived together at Gøta, with their respective children. This same chapter explains that Thorlac had two sons, Sigurd (a strong man with blond curly hair) and Thord (also called "The Low" for his stout yet strong figure); Tróndur's sister had a son known as "Geat the Red".

Tróndur opposed [[Christianization]] of the Faroes and pronounced a curse against the religion and Sigmundur, who was promulgating it. This is the subject of a [[Faroese language|Faroese]] poem by [[Janus Djurhuus]], "Gandkvæði Tróndar".

&lt;gallery&gt;

==As the Icelandic saying==
The [[saying]] in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], "vera einhverjum Þrándur í Götu",&lt;ref&gt;http://malfar.arnastofnun.is/?p=9562&lt;/ref&gt; (e. ''being someones'' '''Þrándur í Götu''') or just "að [[wikt:vera þrándur í götu|vera þrándur í götu]]" (e. ''to be a'' '''þrándur í götu'''), means "to be an obstacle to somebody" (the original Þrándur himself probably unknown, to most [[Icelanders]], let alone that Þrándur was viking, explaining why the word/he '''þrándur''' and '''götu''' may be commonly [[lower case]]d as in the latter example) because Þrándur opposed taxation of Olav the King (while Icelanders might think that '''þrándur''' means a literal '''obstacle''', that happens to be '''in the street''' (icel. ''í götu'', note lower case).

'''Uma Narayan''' (born 16 April 1958) is an [[Feminism in India|Indian feminist scholar]], and a Professor of Philosophy at [[Vassar College]]. 

== Career ==
She is the author of ''Dislocating Cultures: Identities, Traditions and Third World Feminism'' in which Narayan disputes feminism as a solely Western notion and intrusion, while challenging assumptions that [[India]]n feminism is based on Western models. Particularly, a notion of homogeneous, total culture is criticized through historical contextualization of nationalist uses and defenses of the Indian practices of ''[[Sati (practice)|sati]]'' and [[Dowry death|dowry murders]], as well as [[Indian cuisine|food]]. The charges of "Westernization" on Indian feminism, based on the a-historical premises contradicted by her historical contextualization, are thus rejected by Narayan. Likewise, this historicization of the condition of Indian women is used to criticize [[Radical feminism|radical feminist]] claims that all women everywhere are constituted by the same concerns and interests. These arguments align her with theorists such as [[Chandra Talpade Mohanty|Chandra Mohanty]] and [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak|Gayatri Spivak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grewal|first=Gurleen|date=2001|title=Dislocating Cultures: Identities, Traditions, and Third-World Feminism (review)|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/14155|journal=Hypatia|language=en|volume=16|issue=1|pages=102–106|doi=10.1353/hyp.2001.0007|issn=1527-2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Related to her work in ''Dislocating Cultures'', Narayan has criticized culture-reductionist forms of postcolonial feminism which "in attempting to take seriously these  cultural differences...risk replacing gender-essentialist analyses with culturally essentialist analyses that replicate problematic colonialist notions about the cultural differences between 'Western culture' and 'non-Western cultures' and the women who inhabit them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Narayan|first=Uma|date=2000|title=Undoing the "Package Picture" of Cultures|url=|journal=Signs|volume=25|pages=1084|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She dubs this view of culture which covers up divisions and differences within 'Western' and 'non-Western' cultures the "Package Picture of Cultures." This false view can be avoided, for instance, through historical analysis of the culture to be evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Narayan|first=Uma|date=2000|title=Undoing the "Package Picture" of Cultures|url=|journal=Signs|volume=25|pages=1083-86|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

She has also worked in field of Indian legal studies. Her published work includes considerations of [[B. N. Rau|Bengal Narsing Rau]]'s influence on the provisions of the [[Constitution of India]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Narayan|first=Uma|date=2016/11|title=The Constituent Assembly of India: Recollecting Contributions of Sir Benegal Narsing Rau, the Constitutional Adviser|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-legal-information/article/constituent-assembly-of-india-recollecting-contributions-of-sir-benegal-narsing-rau-the-constitutional-adviser/7B51C7FADC06B688CD952F1063BACCAC|journal=International Journal of Legal Information|language=en|volume=44|issue=3|pages=225–234|doi=10.1017/jli.2016.40|issn=0731-1265}}&lt;/ref&gt; and writing primers on Indian legal literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Narayan|first=Uma|date=2007/06|title=Sources of Indian Legal Information|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/legal-information-management/article/sources-of-indian-legal-information/5F315AB8FA3B46BEA41EAFA6690C18AD|journal=Legal Information Management|language=en|volume=7|issue=2|pages=133–139|doi=10.1017/S1472669606001204|issn=1741-2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Narayan coedited ''Reconstructing Political Theory: Feminist Perspectives'' with [[Mary L. Shanley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/36438847|title=Reconstructing political theory : feminist perspectives|date=1997|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|others=Shanley, Mary Lyndon, 1944-, Narayan, Uma.|isbn=0271017244|location=University Park, PA|oclc=36438847}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Having and Raising Children'' with Julia Bartkowiak and ''Decentering the Center: Philosophy for a Multicultural, Postcolonial, and Feminist World'' with [[Sandra Harding]]. She currently is a professor at [[Vassar College]] on the Andrew W. Mellon Chair of Humanities.

'''Saint Veronica Giuliani''', [[Capuchin Poor Clares|O.S.C. Cap.]] (also "Veronica de Julianis"; December 27, 1660 – July 9, 1727),&lt;ref name=pope&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/audiences/2010/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20101215.html Pope Benedict XVI, "Saint Veronica Giuliani", General audience, December 15, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Capuchin Poor Clares]] [[nun]] and [[Mysticism|mystic]]. She was [[canonization|canonized]] by [[Pope Gregory XVI]] in 1839.

==Life==

===Early life===
She was born '''Orsola''' ['''Ursula'''] &lt;!-- http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:xat43Tjk6HsJ:www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/audiences/2010/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20101215_en.html+%22She+was%+given+the+name%22+Orsola+%22%5bUrsula%5d%22&amp;hl=en --&gt; '''Giuliani''' at [[Mercatello sul Metauro|Mercatello]] in the [[Duchy of Urbino]] on December 27, 1660. Her parents were Francesco and Benedetta Mancini Giuliani. She was the youngest of seven sisters, three of whom embraced the monastic life.&lt;ref name=pope/&gt;

It is told that at the age of three years Ursula supposedly began to show great compassion for the poor. She would set apart a portion of her food for them, and even part with her clothes when she met a poor child scantily clad.&lt;ref name=newadvent&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15363a.htm Hess, Lawrence. "St. Veronica Giuliani", The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 21 Nov. 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother died when Ursula was seven years of age.

When others did not readily join in her religious practices she was inclined to be dictatorial. At the age of 16, she experienced a vision which corrected this imperfection of character: she saw her own heart as a "heart of steel". In her writings she confesses that she took a certain pleasure in the more stately circumstances which her family adopted when her father was appointed superintendent of finance at [[Piacenza]]. When Veronica came of age, her father believed she should marry, and so he desired her to take part in the social activities of the young people. But she pleaded so earnestly with her father that, after much resistance, he finally permitted her to choose her own state in life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://franciscan-sfo.org/sts/S0710vero.htm Habig, Marion. ofm, ed., The Franciscan Book of Saints (1959) Franciscan Herald Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life in the monastery===
In 1677, at the age of 17, Ursula was received into the monastery of the [[Capuchin Poor Clares]] in [[Città di Castello]] in [[Umbria]], Italy, taking the name of '''Veronica''' in memory of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]]. At the conclusion of the ceremony of her reception, the [[bishop]] said to the [[abbess]]: "I commend this new daughter to your special care, for she will one day be a great saint."&lt;ref name=newadvent/&gt;

Veronica became absolutely submissive to the will of her [[spiritual director]]s, though her [[novitiate]] was marked by extraordinary interior trials and temptations to return to the world. In her first years in the monastery, she worked in the kitchen, infirmary and sacristy and also served as portress. At the age of 34, she was made novice mistress.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020601163709/http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/SaintOfDay/default.asp?id=1440 Foley, Leonard. "St. Veronica Giuliani", Saint of the Day]&lt;/ref&gt;

For fifty years, Ursula Giuliani lived as Sister Veronica in the Capuchin convent. With gritty determination tempered by humility, she led her sisters as novice mistress for thirty-four years and as abbess for eleven. St. Veronica governed the convent with obvious common sense and guided the novices with prudence. She would not allow them to read mystical books, requiring them instead to study books on Christian basics. In 1716, she was elected [[abbess]]. As a practical woman, she improved her sisters’ comfort by enlarging the convent rooms and having water piped inside.&lt;ref name=loyola&gt;[http://www.loyolapress.com/saints-stories-for-kids.htm?cId=403538 Saints Stories for All Ages, Loyola Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiritual trials===
Veronica had a lifelong devotion to Christ crucified that eventually became manifested in physical signs. The marks of the crown of thorns appeared on her forehead in 1694 and the five wounds on her body in 1697. Veronica was humiliated by the [[stigmata]] itself and by her bishop’s rigorous testing of her experience. He removed the saint from ordinary community life and put her under constant observation. When he determined that the phenomena were authentic, he allowed her to return to normal convent life and continue her service to her sisters.&lt;ref name=loyola/&gt;
 
She died on July 9, 1727, at [[Città di Castello]].

==Veneration==
After Veronica's death a figure of the Cross was supposedly found impressed upon her heart, and her body has been noted as being [[incorrupt]]. 
She was [[beatification|beatified]] by [[Pope Pius VII]] on June 17, 1804, and was [[canonized]] by Pope [[Gregory XVI]] on May 26, 1839.&lt;ref name=pope/&gt; She is usually represented in art crowned with thorns and embracing the Cross.

Saint Veronica Giuliani's "rebirth" in Lebanon began with the devotion of a Lebanese religious, Brother Emmanuel, who came upon her writings in 1994 while serving at a monastery in [[Deir ez-Zor|Deir al-Zour, Syria]]. Brother Emmanuel founded a religious order, the [[Little Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]], in 2015 and he believes Saint Veronica "has chosen Lebanon as a country to begin, or to intensify, her mission because Lebanon loves [[Virgin Mary|Our Lady]] a lot and has a very deep relationship with Mary." As of 2016, there are seven nuns and four brothers in the order.

Banners throughout the country proclaimed "A saint rises up in Lebanon!" heralding the first church in the world outside of Italy dedicated to St. Veronica Giuliani. The newly built church, in [[Baabda District|Ksaibe, Lebanon]], was consecrated on July 9, 2016, the saint's feast day.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/a-saints-mission-for-saving-souls-is-reborn-in-lebanon&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yeung Kwong''', [[Grand Bauhinia Medal|GBM]] (1926 – 16 May 2015) was a [[Hong Kong]] communist trade unionist and activist. His daughter studied in Britain and married a British man. He was leader of the [[Hong Kong 1967 Leftist Riots|1967 Leftist Riots]] against [[British Hong Kong|British rule]] in Hong Kong. Yeung organised serious terrorist attacks in Hong Kong, including assassinations and the setting up of bombs, which lead to the death and injury of many people in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="Chan"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=gqI1ynEZ1BAC&amp;q=Yeung+Kwong#v=snippet&amp;q=Yeung%20Kwong&amp;f=false ''Crisis and Transformation in China's Hong Kong''], Ming K. Chan, Alvin Y. So, Lynn T. White III, M.E. Sharpe, 2002, pages 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trade unionist career==
Born in 1926, Yeung became a member of the Hong Kong Tramways Workers Union in 1948 and led strikes by [[Hong Kong Tramway]]'s fare conductors the following year.

He served as chairman of the [[Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions]] (FTU), the largest pro-[[Communist Party of China|CPC]] labour union in Hong Kong, from 1962 to 1980, and then its president between 1980 and 1988. From 1973 to 1987, he was a local deputy to the [[National People's Congress]].&lt;ref name="dies"/&gt;&lt;ref name=20150614hongkongfp/&gt;

==1967 Leftist riots==
During the [[Hong Kong 1967 Leftist riots]], which was inspired by the [[Cultural Revolution]] and escalated from a labour dispute at a plastic-flower factory in [[San Po Kong]], Yeung served as director of the [[Hong Kong and Kowloon Committee for Anti-Hong Kong British Persecution Struggle]]. Thousands were injured and 51 died, 15 of whom were killed in bombings planted by the Leftists.&lt;ref name="dies"/&gt;

==Grand Bauhinia Medal controversy==
Nominated by the FTU, then Chief Executive [[Tung Chee-hwa]] awarded the [[Grand Bauhinia Medal]], the highest honour in Hong Kong, to Yeung for his "outstanding contribution to the labour movement and labour welfare in Hong Kong and for his dedicated community service" in 2001.&lt;ref name="dies"/&gt;

The award ceremony was held on 13 October 2001, and controversy immediately rose after the announcement, with many people believing that Tung, who was seeking [[Hong Kong Chief Executive election, 2002|re-election]] at the time, was [[pandering (politics)|pandering]] to the FTU, which is an important bloc of vote in the unique Chief Executive election system in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="Chan"/&gt; Yeung had in 1996 and 2002 sat on the [[Election Committee]] that elected Tung as Chief Executive. Some critics asserted that Yeung was not suitable for the highest honour of the land. Critics argued the event was a symbolic gesture for approval of the 1967 riot.&lt;ref name="Chan"/&gt; Criticisms also came from victims of the riots and officials responsible for putting down the unrest, but the government declined to say if Yeung's "contributions" included what he did during the protests.&lt;ref name="dies"/&gt;

"It is not a matter of who encouraged this kind of action [bomb attacks]. Oppression will result in popular revolt," Yeung responded, also replying that deaths and injuries were inevitable in the struggle when asked if he felt sorry for the victims.&lt;ref name="dies"/&gt; 

==Death==
In the morning of 16 May 2015, Yeung died at the [[Prince of Wales Hospital]] in [[Sha Tin]] after he underwent a heart operation. Acting Chief Executive [[Carrie Lam]] sent her condolences to Yeung's family and praised the man for his contributions to the labour movement.&lt;ref name="dies"&gt;So, Peter. 2015.

Protesters gathered outside his funeral with banners in the memory of those who died at the hands of the leftists during the riots. Some brought champagne to celebrate his death; others brought pineapples (a metaphor and Cantonese slang for bombs and grenades) and cursed him to go to hell.&lt;ref name=20150614hongkongfp/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbJFyUyAcX4|title=楊光舉殯CY弔唁　百人示威開香檳|date=15 June 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;
