Afterwards, he fired at [[Abdul Aziz (Pakistani cleric)|Abdul Aziz Ghazi]], who barely escaped death. The assassin escaped with the help of an accomplice waiting outside in a car. Maulana Abdullah died of his injuries on the way to the hospital.

Abdul Rashid Ghazi lodged the FIR and the police investigated the case. After a relentless effort, a man was arrested and afterwards, during [[Police lineup|ID Parade]] Several Eye witnesses identified the assassin. However, he was released the next day without reason. Abdul Rashid Ghazi protested against the release and warned the police of legal action if the suspect was not arrested soon. With Ghazi increasing pressure on police, a military officer asked Ghazi to withdraw the case or face the fate of his father.According to his friend, this was turning point in Ghazi's life, and he became disillusioned him with system.

==Relations with Pakistani society==
{{See also|CIA activities in Pakistan}}

Pakistani newspapers claim that American diplomats in Pakistan carried automatic weapons without a license, attacked local citizens, and cursed at local policemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Politics/05-Sep-2009/A-law-unto-themselves/|periodical=The Nation|date=5 September 2009|accessdate=2009-09-20|title=A law unto themselves|first=Sikander|last=Shaheen|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2009/07/05/77897.html|date=5 July 2009|accessdate=2009-09-29|periodical=Al-Arabiya News Channel|title=Americans carry arms in defiance of diplomatic law: US diplomats in Islamabad carry arms for safety|last=Jafar|first=Mansoor|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also allegedly dodged law enforcement personnel and security screenings on motorways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/236756/us-men-dodge-motorway-police-to-enter-peshawar/|title=US men dodge Motorway police to enter Peshawar|date=22 August 2011|work=The Express Tribune|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; airports and elsewhere on multiple occasions. In January 2011, an American national and CIA contractor [[Raymond Allen Davis incident|Raymond Davis]] was involved in a shootout that killed three Pakistanis in [[Lahore]], resulting in a diplomatic rift between Pakistan and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/27/us-embassy-official-kills-pakistan | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Declan | last=Walsh | title=US foreign policy,World news,US news,Pakistan (News) | date=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis was later freed by the Pakistani government and the families of the victims were paid compensation, in spite of large public opposition to his acquittal. In February 2011, American citizen Aaron Mark DeHaven was arrested in Peshawar after he was found allegedly overstaying his visa illegally. He was later deported.

In June 2011, an American citizen living in Pakistan with his Pakistani wife and family, Mathew Craig Barret, was arrested in Islamabad.

'''Cannabis in Nepal''' has been illegal since 1973, but the region has a long history of use of cannabis as an intoxicant, and continues to produce cannabis illicitly.

==History==
[[File:Hashish-shop-Kathmandu-1973.jpg|right|thumb|Legal cannabis shop in Kathmandu in 1973]]
Nepal has used psychoactive cannabis for centuries, and as early as the 1700s Nepalese ''charas'' was recognized as the best available.&lt;ref name="Booth2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Booth|title=Cannabis: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mjn6sCiHoFIC&amp;pg=PA325|date=30 September 2011|publisher=Transworld|isbn=978-1-4090-8489-1|pages=325–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1800s, commentator [[Francis Buchanan-Hamilton]] noted:
{{quote|''In Nepal, the Gangja, Charas, or Cannabis sativa, as I have already mentioned, is a common weed : but in that country it is not cultivated, although much used for the purposes of intoxication''.&lt;ref name="Hamilton1819"&gt;{{cite book|author=Francis Hamilton|title=An Account of the Kingdom of Nepal: And of the Territories Annexed to this Dominion by the House of Gorkha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KmtoAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA231|year=1819|publisher=A. Constable|pages=231–}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The Hippie Trail===
In the 1960s, the [[Hippie Trail]] began to route young Western adventurers through Nepal. The stable traditional cannabis economy was rocked by the influx of demand, and the heavy usage by visitors normalized and made trendy cannabis consumption locally. The increased demand and linkage to outside markets led to an increase in hashish production, and smuggling routes established through India and out to the wider world.&lt;ref name="Rubin1975"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vera Rubin|title=Cannabis and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gCRNRGOhNA4C&amp;pg=PA255|date=1 January 1975|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-081206-0|pages=255–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prohibition===
In 1973, Nepal canceled the licenses of all cannabis shops, dealers, and farmers, under pressure from the United States and the international community. However, personal cultivation and use were unaffected, and cannabis commerce continued illicitly. The loss of $100,000 in government revenues caused disruption, and later in the 1970s attempts were made at crop substitution.&lt;ref name="Booth2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Booth|title=Cannabis: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mjn6sCiHoFIC&amp;pg=PA325|date=30 September 2011|publisher=Transworld|isbn=978-1-4090-8489-1|pages=325–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, it is only legal to smoke [[hashish]] during [[Maha Shivaratri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thelongestwayhome.com/blog/nepal/tourists-buy-sell-hashish-drugs-in-kathmandu-nepal/ |title=For better or worse: tourists, hashish and hard drugs in Kathmandu Nepal |website=thelongestwayhome.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Food==
In Nepal, cannabis seeds are also used in making pickles "bhang ko achar". The dried seeds are ground and then mixed with aalo (potato). This is common in hilly area like Kathmandu, Pokhara of Nepal.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

'''Chinese people in Angola''' are a recent group of residents, having arrived in [[Angola]] in the past few decades.

Thousands of Chinese construction workers, engineers, planners, and support staff that includes doctors and cooks reside in Angola, making the construction sector a large magnet for Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7047127.stm | work=BBC News | first=Lucy | last=Ash | title=Chinese reaching out to Angola | date=4 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Over 500 Chinese companies have operated in Angola, as part of post-war reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chinese firms urged to beef up security in Angola amid worrying crimes - Xinhua {{!}} English.news.cn|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-05/12/c_135354554.htm|accessdate=27 August 2016|work=news.xinhuanet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The height of the wave was around 2012 when Angola's Office of Migration and Foreigners, stated 258,920 Chinese resided in Angola, the vast majority (258,391) on work visas.&lt;ref name="Visao"&gt;{{citation|url=https://visao.sapo.pt/angola-cerca-de-259000-chineses-vivem-atualmente-no-pais=f660830|title=Angola: Cerca de 259.000 chineses vivem atualmente no país|work=Visão|date=2012-04-25|accessdate=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The level of the Chinese population before the crash in oil prices in 2014 has fallen dramatically. In 2017, a Chinese business association leader told Bloomberg that the population was approximately 50,000.&lt;ref name="angoladown"/&gt; Many Chinese have left the country recently because of rising crime against Chinese, including rapes, robberies and murder, the depreciation of Angola currency due to the oil crash, and halting of construction contracts by Chinese companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=INTERVIEW-Rise in violent crime alarms Chinese in Angola{{!}} News by Country{{!}} Reuters|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/angolaNews/idAFLB37077620091111|accessdate=27 August 2016|work=af.reuters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="angoladown"/&gt; 

During [[2016 Angola and DR Congo yellow fever outbreak|a large outbreak of yellow fever in Angola]] in the spring of 2016, eleven Chinese nationals were reported to have traveled home to China with the disease, with the last case in April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yellow Fever – China|url=http://www.who.int/csr/don/22-april-2016-yellow-fever-china/en/|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=1 May 2016|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese strengthened surveillance and sent a medical team to Angola to provide vaccination to Chinese nationals.

Historically, Białystok has been a destination for internal and foreign immigration, especially from [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. In addition to the [[Poles|Polish minority]], there was a significant Jewish majority in Białystok. According to [[Russian Empire Census|Russian census of 1897]], out of the total population of 66,000, [[Jews]] constituted 41,900 (around 63% percent).&lt;ref&gt;Joshua D.

Bialystok also hosts cultural events such as nationwide Festival "Belarusian Song" and Day of Belarusian Culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bialystok.pl/]&lt;/ref&gt; Belarus Radio Right ({{lang|pl|Białoruskie Radio Racja}})&lt;ref name=koncesje&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krrit.gov.pl/bip/Nadawcy/Nadawcykoncesjonowani/Koncesjeradiowe/tabid/216/Default.aspx |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080729021246/http://www.krrit.gov.pl/bip/Nadawcy/Nadawcykoncesjonowani/Koncesjeradiowe/tabid/216/Default.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-07-29 |title=Koncesje na rozpowszechnianie programów radiowych drogą naziemną |publisher=[[Krajowa Rada Radiofonii i Telewizji|KRRiTv]] |language=pl |date=2010-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is based in the city and transmits radio programming to Belarus.

===Russians===
[[Russians]] are a minority, they are scattered around the territory of Poland but mostly reside in eastern Poland. There are 3244 Russians in Poland, living mainly in Białystok and the surrounding region, according to the 2002 census.&lt;ref name="MSWIA"/&gt; The HFHR estimated around 13,000-15,000 [[Russians]] are in Poland. In Białystok, the main organization of work - Russian Cultural and Educational Association, organizing the Days of Russian Culture.

===Tatars===
{{further|Lipka Tatars}}
The Lipka Tatar origins can be traced back to the descendant states of the [[Mongol Empire]] of [[Genghis Khan]] - the [[White Horde]], the [[Golden Horde]], the [[Crimean Khanate]] and [[Kazan Khanate]]. They initially served as a noble military caste but later they became urban-dwellers known for their crafts, horses and gardening skills. Throughout centuries they resisted assimilation and kept their traditional lifestyle. While they remained very attached to their religions, over time however, they lost their original [[Tatar language]] and for the most part adopted [[Polish language|Polish]].&lt;ref name="Harvard"&gt;Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups, "Polish or Lithuanian Tartars", Harvard University Press, pg. 990&lt;/ref&gt;

After the annexation of eastern Poland into the Soviet Union following World War II, Poland was left with only 2 Tatar villages, [[Bohoniki]] and [[Kruszyniany]]. A significant number of the Tartars in the territories annexed to the USSR repatriated to Poland and clustered in or near Białystok.
In Poland, the Tatar population reached approximately 100,000 in 1630 but the 2002 census showed only 447 people declaring this ethnicity.&lt;ref name="MSWIA"/&gt;

In 1925 the Muslim Religion Association (Muzułmański Związek Religijny) was formed in Białystok. In 1992, the ''Organization of Tatars of the Polish Republic'' (Związek Tatarów Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej) with autonomous branches in Białystok and Gdańsk began operating. The Białystok branch issues a magazine called ''Life Tatar''. The plan is to establish in Bialystok an '''Institute for the History of the Tartars''.

===Other nationalities===

In Bialystok there are other minorities: 
* '''[[Romani people|Romani]]'''  -  Emigration of Polish Romani to Germany in the late 1980s reduced Poland's Romani population by as much as 75 percent. In Białystok the ''Central Council of Roma'' work in Poland, and publish a monthly magazine, ''Rromano po Drom''
* '''[[Ukrainians in Poland|Ukrainians]]''' -  According to the census 417 Ukrainians live in Białystok,&lt;ref name="MSWIA"/&gt; There are two civic societies in the city, ''the Association of Ukrainians of Podlasie'' and ''Association of Independent Ukrainian Youth''.

''Dhaka'', the hand-spun cotton inlay-pattern weaving used to make intricately patterned, colourful panels for Dhaka topis, is the most remarkable and visible cotton textile in Nepal.&lt;ref name=Susi&gt;{{cite book |last= Dunsmore|first= Susi |date=1993 |title= Nepalese textiles |url= |location=UK |publisher= British Museum Press |page=90 |isbn=9780714125107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-dyed cotton is imported from India and weaved by master craftspeople into intricate patterns using only a few colours.&lt;ref name=Aparicio/&gt; The fabric is also used for a type of blouse called ''Dhaka ko cholo'', literally meaning a "blouse made of dhaka fabric", and shawls for women.&lt;ref name=Susi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Poudyal, Anubhuti, "[http://ecs.com.np/lifestyle/put-a-cap-on-it Put a cap on it]", ''ECS Nepal'', 12 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Some farmers and weavers have made preliminary trials of a silk Dhaka topi cloth with limited success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Dunsmore |first= Susi |date=1993 |title= Nepalese textiles |url= |location=UK |publisher= British Museum Press |page=117 |isbn=9780714125107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different myths about the origin of Dhaka fabric. One story tells that a minister returned from Dhaka, Bangladesh with idea of such a topi, which eventually replaced the traditional black cap in popularity. Another story tells that name is so because the originally cloths and threads for Dhaka topi used to come from Dhaka, often resembling [[Muslin|Dhakai muslin]] (fine cotton of Dhaka). It is also possible that Hindu weavers settled in Nepal to flee Muslim invasion of [[Bengal]]. The method of pattern weaving practised around Dhaka, called ''[[Jamdani]]'', is considerably different from what is currently practised by Nepalese weavers.&lt;ref name=Susi/&gt; A few fragments of Dhaka fabric in the collection of the [[National Museum of Nepal]] are assumed to be from early 20th century.&lt;ref name=Susi/&gt;

The most popular legend attributes the introduction of Dhaka weaving to Ganesh Man Maharjan, who worked in an Jamdani factory in 1950s. He was inspired to learn it when he noticed Dambar Kumari, Shree Teen Junga Bahadur Rana’s daughter, wearing Dhaka clothes she brought back from Benares. Upon returning to his native Palpa his wife and he established a factory to produce Dhaka cloth in 1957 with one [[Bobbin|spool]] and one hand-operated [[Charkha (spinning wheel)|Charkha]] spinning-wheel bought from Kathmandu and local weavers trained by Mahajan. His operation flourished because of the high price of superior quality imports.&lt;ref name=Pokharel&gt;Amendra Pokharel,"[http://ecs.com.np/features/dented-pride-the-story-of-daura-suruwal-and-dhaka-topi Dented Pride: The Story of Daura Suruwal and Dhaka Topi]", ''ECS Nepal'', 11 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nirmal&gt;Nirmal Shrestha, "[http://ecs.com.np/features/palpali-dhaka Palpali Dhaka]", ''ECS Nepal'', 6 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Shah dynasty]] government showed a preference for Dhaka cloth and topis made out of it, other weavers started following Maharajan. By early 1970, his own factory Swadeshi Vastrakala Palpali Dhaka Udhyog had grown to employ some 350 workers.&lt;ref name=Pokharel/&gt; At that time Jaishanker Textile Industry, Khanal Textile Industry, and Nabin Textile Industry were the major producers of cotton yarn used to make Dhaka cloth.&lt;ref name=Nirmal/&gt;

Despite booming business and government incentives, most weavers were poor. An expert weaver worked 12–16 hours a day for a month to produce 4–5 metres of Dhaka cloth. But, their wage was a measly 10-30 [[Nepalese rupee]]s, one egg and 250 grams of [[Jalebi|Jeri]].&lt;ref name=Pokharel/&gt; In 1970s, the Dhaka weaving industry in Palpa changed significantly as it was introduced to [[Jacquard loom]] and easily available shiny [[acrylic fiber]]. Jacquard looms made it possible to produce several meter a day, instead of the average 9-inches on a hand-loom. Many weavers lost their jobs, Palpa lost its near monopoly and Dhaka caps lost some of the intricacies of its patterns.&lt;ref name=Nirmal/&gt;

Now weavers in capital Kathmandu, [[Palpa District]] in the middle mountains area, especially its headquarters [[Tansen, Nepal|Tansen municipality]], and [[Tehrathum District]] in the East are the main producers of Dhaka cloth.&lt;ref name=Aparicio/&gt;&lt;ref name=Susi/&gt; [[Limbu people|Limbus]] and [[Rai people|Rais]] from the middle mountains are famous for the Dhaka cloth they produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Editorial Board |date=2001 |title= Experience it in Nepal, Mt.

The traditional outfit of Nepali men features ''[[Daura-Suruwal]]'' (Nepalese shirt and trouser suit), ''[[Patuka]]'' (cloth wrapped around the waist instead of a belt), ''[[ista coat]]'' (the Nepalese sleeveless half-jacket) and a topi, while ''Gunyou Cholo'' (a ''[[ghagra]]''-''[[kurta]]'' style women's dress) is the dress for a woman who generally wore no topi.&lt;ref name=Barun/&gt; Various ethnic groups wear their own constituent traditional dresses. For instance, the [[Tamang people|Tamang]] women wear distinctive headgear with an added cotton or woollen wrapper is also worn over the cap. Some Buddhist Tamang women wear ''Bakhus'' which are ethnic to the Tibetan people.&lt;ref name=Barun/&gt;

The once mandatory topi of a Nepali man can be either black (called ''[[bhaad-gaaule]]'' or ''kalo topi'') or multicoloured (called ''Dhaka'' or ''Nepali topi'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reed |first=David |date=2002 |title=The Rough Guide to Nepal |url= |location= |publisher=Rough Guides |page=583 |isbn=9781858288994}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bhaad-gaaule topis'' are similar to Dhaka topi but they are black in colour given the fact that they are not made from Dhaka.&lt;ref name=Barun/&gt; Before the Nepali government started promoting Dhaka topis, Bhaad-gaaule topis largely made in [[Bhaktapur]] were the popular Nepali headgear, especially common to [[Newar people|Newaris]].

Sardar Meer '''Dil Murad Khan Khoso''' was a [[Baloch people|Baloch]] warrior who opposed British invasion in his area by revolting against them in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Biographical encyclopedia of Pakistan |last= |first= |year=1972 |publisher=Biographical Research Institute, Pakistan |isbn= |page=528 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Being a [[sardar]] of the [[Khoso]] tribe&lt;ref name=bep2000&gt;{{cite book |title=Biographical encyclopedia of Pakistan: millennium 2000 |last= |first= |year=2001 |publisher=Research Institute of Historiography, Biography and Philosophy |oclc=50495187 |page=645 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he had a good support of his tribesmen plus that of other sardars of the area, namely Sardar Dariya Khan Jakhrani&lt;ref name=Lambrick/&gt; and Syed Inayat Ali Shah.

On the evening before they were to fight with British troops someone leaked information about the whereabouts of the warriors and their plan.&lt;ref name=Lambrick&gt;{{cite book |title=John Jacob of Jacobabad |last=Lambrick |first=Hugh Trevor |year=1960 |publisher=[[Orion Publishing Group|Cassell]] |oclc=314950185 |page=333 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Who leaked this information to British is not known. All the three sardars were arrested taken to some unknown area and then Dil Murad Khan was sentenced to life imprisonment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inside Baluchistan: a political autobiography of His Highness Baiglar Baigi, Khan-e-Azam-XIII Mir Ahmad Yar Khan Baluch, Khan-e-Baluch, ex-ruler of Kalat State |last=K̲h̲ān |first=Aḥmad Yār |year=1975 |publisher=Royal Book Co. |oclc=2789395 |page=188 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Andaman Islands]]&lt;ref name=bep2000/&gt; while his campanions were sent to [[Aden]].

After his arrest his brother Shahal Khan I was imprisoned at Mach jail and was made to crush glasses that affected his eyesight and became blind and later on released as a blind person.

When all this happened Dil Murad khan and Darya Khan Jakhrani had a vast area of agricultural land under their possession. All the land was confiscated and the Sardar title was taken back. Bahadur Khan [[Mir Bahadur Khan Khoso]], the only son of Dil Murad Khan was a small boy and his mother Seza, a [[Jamali (tribe)|Jamali]] woman by tribe, took her son to General [[John Jacob (East India Company officer)|John Jacob]]'s [[Durbar (court)|Durbar]] and bravely spoke to him saying, "I am just a woman with a blind brother in law. I cannot support this boy so I request you to kindly arrest my son and send him to his father". John Jacob was quite moved by these bold remarks of a tribal woman and ordered a piece of land to be given to the family near [[Dilmurad Wah]] in [[Thul]] Taluka.

[[Mir Bahadur Khan Khoso]] pursued a different life style and he proved himself to be an inventive genius who advised engineers on various irrigation projects. Bahadur Khan had more than forty thousand acres of land in [[Jacobabad District]] all purchased by himself.

== Biography ==

===Career===
[[File:Dolk - 3 (writer).jpg|thumb|left|Dolk - Puppy Love, [[Bergen]], Norway]]

Dolk was born in Bergen, Norway, in 1979 and started with [[stencil art]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graffiti.no/streetart/index.htm|work=Subject: Street Art|title=Dolk and Pøbel|date=10 June 2014|first= Thomas|last= Stønjum |accessdate=25 March 2012|publisher=Graffiti.no|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolk has education from mechanic courses in Bergen, and has studied graphic design in Melbourne. Dolk claims he was inspired by the British street artist [[Banksy]] to start with stencil art. Dolk started with stencil art in Bergen in 2003, where several of his works still are visible on walls in the city. He soon started travelling the world, and in London people have mistaken Dolk's works for being art by Banksy.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrk.no/kultur-og-underholdning/1.3269330|work= Newspaper|title=Dolk does it sharp in London|date=23 August 2007|first= Marthe|last= Solbakken|accessdate=25 March 2012|publisher=NRK.no|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolk has made stencil art in many cities.  After a while Dolk wanted to take his art into more legal forms and he has since 2006 participated in exhibitions and art festivals all over the world. In 2008 Dolk and [[Pøbel]] created the project "Ghetto Spedalsk" in [[Lofoten]], northern Norway. The goal was to move the urban art form into no man's land by painting 20 stencils on abandoned houses.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/nordland/1.6186843|work= Newspaper|title=Urban art in no man's land|date=21 September 2008|first= John Inge|last= Johansen|accessdate=25 March 2012|publisher=NRK.no|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Dolk made three works of art for the opening of [[Halden prison]], the art covers the walls in the exercise yard. [[Daily Mail]] called the prison "the world's poshest prison, with plus £1m Banksy-style art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1277158/Halden-Prison-Inside-Norways-posh-new-jail.html#ixzz1q8u72jpx|work= Newspaper|title=the world's poshest prison (plus £1m Banksy-style art)|date=12 May 2010|first= |last= |accessdate=25 March 2012|publisher=Dailymail.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Dolk and Pøbel were paid by the Norwegian state to put their art up at the main railway stations in [[Oslo]] and [[Trondheim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/nrk_trondelag/1.7101702|work= Newspaper|title=Dolk and Pøbel at the station|date=24 April 2010|first= Torill|last= Aamodt |accessdate=25 March 2012|publisher=NRK.no|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Dolk held his first separate exhibition in Oslo at the OSL Contemporary gallery where he sold out all 9 canvases for £12500 each.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; In 2011 Dolk was one of several street artists that got to decorate the walls at the [[Norwegian School of Economics]] as part of the project "…………CAPITALISM?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.no/bergenpuls/Dolk-pryder-NHH-2566800.html#.T1OHjfEaND1|work=Newspaper art|title=Dolk decorates NHH|date=18 September 2011|first= Kjetil|last= Kopren Ullebø|accessdate=25 March 2012|publisher=Bt.no|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolk sells his works through the Bergen-based website handmadeposters.com, and in 2011, 250 copies of the print "Mushroom Girl" were sold out in 40 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.no/bergenpuls/Popular-Dolk-selger-sa-det-suser-2579379.html#.T1OGAfEaND1|work=Newspaper art|title=Dolk sells out fast|date=21 September 2011|first= Guro H.|last= Bergesen|accessdate=25 March 2012|publisher=Bt.no|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 he sold the prints "TOY" and "Winner" for over £110000 in less than two minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ba.no/puls/article5961065.ece|work=Newspaper art|title=Dolk sells for £110000|date=7 March 2012|first= Ørjan|last= Nilsson|accessdate=25 March 2012|publisher=Ba.no|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Dolkblog.com was established; the unofficial fansite covers news, artwork, information etc. about the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.DolkBlog.com|work=Blogart|title=Dolkblog.com|date=31 August 2012|first= |last= |accessdate=31 August 2012|publisher=Dolkblog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==

===Dolk or Banksy?===
Early in Dolk's career, it was speculated that Dolk was a pseudonym for the well-known British graffiti artist Banksy. The two artists have several stylistic similarities, and especially Banksy's work "Puppy Love" from 2005 has been pointed out as resembling Dolk. Dolk made his own version of this work where both the name and the colors were identical with the original.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

===Famous works===

The work "Che" from 2007 shows a cigar-smoking [[Che Guevara]] proudly pointing at his own t-shirt with the iconic portrait from 1960 taken by [[Alberto Korda]] of himself. Dolk's stencil is distinguished by many as the ultimate copy of this portrait, that after Che Guevara's death was pirate-copied, creating an enormous turnover. The stencil has been sold as the prints "Che" and "Che XL". The well-known street art website "Pictures on Walls" sold Dolk's "Che" as postcards in 2006.

The work "Burger King" from 2006 portrays [[Prince Charles]] in a birthday crown in paper from [[Burger King]].

The work "Spray" is a twist on the iconic picture taken by [[Eddie Adams (photographer)|Eddie Adams]] during the [[Vietnam War]] where general [[Nguyễn Ngọc Loan]] executes the [[Vietcong]] prisoner of war [[Nguyễn Văn Lém]] with a head shot. Dolk has exchanged the head with a flower, and the revolver with a spray bottle. In Bergen, this work was preserved in 2009 by the local government framing it in protective glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ba.no/nyheter/politikk/article4425460.ece|work= Newspaper|title=Defends Dolk preservation |date=26 June 2009|first= Geir |last= Kvile|accessdate=25 March 2012|publisher=Ba.no|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project "Ghetto Spedalsk" in 2008 was a collaboration between Dolk and Pøbel where the goal was to move street art into no man's land. They painted several stencils on 20 abandoned houses in Lofoten, northern Norway. The project got wide international attention.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

[[File:Pompeji Penis Sign.jpg|thumb|150px|Phallus inscribed on a paving stone at [[Pompeii]]]]

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]] and [[Magic in the Graeco-Roman world|magic]], the '''''fascinus''''' or '''''fascinum''''' was the embodiment of the divine [[phallus]]. The word can refer to the deity himself ('''Fascinus'''), to phallus [[effigy|effigies]] and [[amulet]]s, and to the spells used to invoke his divine protection.&lt;ref&gt;The [[grammatical gender|neuter]] form ''fascinum'' is used most often for objects or magic charms, masculine ''fascinus'' for the god.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] calls it a ''medicus invidiae'', a "doctor" or remedy for envy (''[[invidia]]'', a "looking upon") or the [[evil eye]].

==Etymology==
The English word "[[wikt:fascinate|fascinate]]" ultimately derives from Latin ''[[wikt:fascinum|fascinum]]'' and the related verb ''fascinare'', "to use the power of the ''fascinus''", that is, "to practice magic" and hence "to enchant, bewitch"  [[Catullus]] uses the verb at the end of ''Carmen 7'', a [[hendecasyllable|hendecasyllabic]] poem addressing his lover Lesbia; he expresses his infinite desire for kisses that cannot be counted by voyeurs nor "fascinated" (put under a spell) by a malicious tongue; such bliss, as also in ''Carmen'' 5, potentially attracts ''invidia''.&lt;ref&gt;David Wray, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6Qg3kYF-WS4C&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=fascinus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1988&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2010&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=14#v=onepage&amp;q=fascinus&amp;f=false ''Catullus and the Poetics of Roman Manhood''] (Cambridge University Press, 2001), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fescennine Verses]], the satiric and often lewd songs or chants performed on various social occasions, may have been so-named from the ''fascinum''; ancient sources propose this etymology along with an alternative origin from [[Fescennia]], a small town in [[Etruria]].&lt;ref&gt;Gian Biagio Conte, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NJGp_dkXnuUC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=fascinum&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1988&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2010&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=172#v=onepage&amp;q=fascinum&amp;f=false ''Latin Literature: A History''] (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1987, 1994), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public religion==
[[File:Tintinnabulum Pompeii MAN Napoli Inv27839.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|Fascinus from Pompeii showing a phallus]]
The [[Vestal Virgin]]s tended the cult of the ''fascinus [[SPQR|populi Romani]]'', the sacred image of the phallus that was one of the tokens of the safety of the state ''(sacra Romana)''. It was thus associated with the [[Palladium (classical antiquity)|Palladium]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Joy Littlewood, ''A [[Commentary (philology)|Commentary]] on [[Ovid]]:'' Fasti ''Book 6'' (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 73; [[T.P. Wiseman]], ''Remus: A Roman Myth'' (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. 61 [https://books.google.com/books?id=7LPNHRUlWacC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=fascinus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1988&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2010&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=68#v=onepage&amp;q=fascinus&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman mythology|Roman myths]], such as the begetting of [[Servius Tullius]], suggest that this phallus was an embodiment of a masculine generative power located within the hearth, regarded as sacred.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Rykwert, ''The Idea of a Town: The Anthropology of Urban Form in Rome, Italy, and the Ancient World'' (MIT Press, 1988), pp. 101 and 159 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Jq78Ff2TYHAC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=fascinus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1988&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2010&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=fascinus&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; When a general celebrated a [[Roman triumph|triumph]], the Vestals hung an effigy of the ''fascinus'' on the underside of his [[chariot]] to protect him from ''invidia''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Natural History'' 28.4.7 (28.39).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], whose primary source on Roman religion was the lost theological works of [[Marcus Terentius Varro]], notes that a phallic image was carried in procession annually at the festival of [[Liber|Father Liber]], the Roman god [[interpretatio graeca|identified with]] [[Dionysus|Dionysus or Bacchus]], for the purpose of protecting the fields from ''fascinatio'', magic compulsion:&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustine of Hippo]], ''[[City of God (book)|De civitate Dei]]'' 7.21; Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Varro says that certain rites of Liber were celebrated in Italy which were of such unrestrained wickedness that the shameful parts of the male were worshipped at crossroads in his honour. … For, during the days of the [[Liberalia|festival of Liber]], this obscene member, placed on a little trolley, was first exhibited with great honour at the crossroads in the countryside, and then conveyed into the city itself. … In this way, it seems, the god Liber was to be propitiated, in order to secure the growth of seeds and to repel enchantment ''(fascinatio)'' from the fields.&lt;ref&gt;English translation by R.W. Dyson, ''Augustine: The City of God against the Pagans'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998, 2002), p. 292 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ReU2M8cLtGcC&amp;pg=PA292&amp;dq=%2221+Of+the+wickedness+of+the+rites+celebrated+in+honour+of+Liber%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%2221%20Of%20the%20wickedness%20of%20the%20rites%20celebrated%20in%20honour%20of%20Liber%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
As a divinized phallus, Fascinus shared attributes with [[Mutunus Tutunus]], whose shrine was supposed to date from the [[Founding of Rome|founding of the city]], and the imported Greek god [[Priapus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnobius]], ''Adversus nationes'' 4.7, explicitly connects Tutunus to the ''fascinus''; see [[Robert E.A. Palmer]], "Mutinus Titinus: A Study in Etrusco-Roman Religion and Topography," in ''Roman Religion and Roman Empire: Five Essays'' (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1974), pp. 187–206.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a magic symbol==
Phallic charms, often winged, were ubiquitous in Roman culture, appearing as objects of jewellery such as pendants and finger rings, relief carvings, lamps, and wind chimes (''[[Tintinnabulum|tintinnabula]]'').&lt;ref name='CAW'&gt;{{cite book |author1=Williams, C.

The protective function of the phallus is usually related to the virile and regenerative powers of an erected phallus, though in most cases the emotion, shame, or laughter created by obscenity is the power that diverts the evil eye.&lt;ref name='Dasen'&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dasen, V. |date=2015 |chapter=Pobaskania: Amulets and Magic in Antiquity |editor1=Boschung, D. |editor2=Bremmer, J.

There are very few Roman images of people wearing a phallic charm.&lt;ref name='Dasen' /&gt; Varro notes the custom of hanging a phallic charm on a baby's neck,{{efn|Varro, ''On the Latin language'', VII.97}} and examples have been found of phallus-bearing rings too small to be worn except by children.&lt;ref name='Henig'&gt;Martin Henig, ''Religion in Roman Britain'' (London: BT Batsford LTD, 1984), pp. 185–186 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOhxSp8nlPsC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;dq=%22A+child's+gold+ring+with+phallus%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1tOTTIXKG4TfnAenpYCRCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22A%20child's%20gold%20ring%20with%20phallus%22&amp;f=false online], with image of example.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 [[experimental archaeology]] project suggested that some types of phallic pendant were designed to remain pointing outwards, in the direction of travel of the wearer, in order to face towards any potential danger or bad luck and nullify it before it could affect the wearer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Whitmore, A. |date=2017 |chapter=Fascinating ''fascina'': apotropaic magic and how to wear a penis |editor1=Cifarelli, M. |editor2=Gawlinkski, L. |title=What shall I say of clothes?

The victory of the phallus over the power of the evil eye may be represented by the phallus ejaculating towards a disembodied eye. This motif is shown in several examples of Roman art.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Ogden, ''Magic, Witchcraft, and Ghosts in the Greek and Roman Worlds: A Sourcebook'' (Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 225 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ox3QRxWQQtcC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=fascinus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1988&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2010&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=fascinus&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the motif is known from multiple [[relief|relief sculptures]] from [[Leptis Magna]] in present-day [[Libya]],&lt;ref name='SorS' /&gt; as well as several instances on [[Hadrian's Wall]].&lt;ref name='BAR'&gt;{{cite book |author1=Parker, A. |date=2017 |chapter=Protecting the Troops?

The "fist and phallus" amulet was prevalent amongst soldiers. These are phallic pendants with a representation of a (usually) clenched fist at the bottom of the shaft, facing away from the [[glans]].

'''Finnish Canadians''' are [[Canadians|Canadian citizens]] of [[Finns|Finnish]] ancestry or [[Finns]] who emigrated to and reside in [[Canada]]. According to the 2001 census number over 131,040 Canadians claim Finnish ancestry. [[Finns]] started coming to Canada in the early 1880s, and in much larger numbers in the early 20th century and well into the mid-20th century. Finnish [[immigration]] to Canada was often a direct result of [[economic depression]]s and wars, or in the aftermath of major conflicts like the [[Finnish Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Ethnic"&gt;{{Cite web

"Finnish Canadians" pioneered efforts to establish [[co-operatives]] in several Canadian cities.  Canada's largest co-operative, the [[Consumers' Co-operative Society]], was started by Finns.

The [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Census]] recorded 136,215 Canadians who claimed Finnish ancestry,&lt;ref name="Finnish Canadians"/&gt; an increase compared to the 2006 Census.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/hlt/97-562/pages/page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo=PR&amp;Code=01&amp;Table=2&amp;Data=Count&amp;StartRec=1&amp;Sort=3&amp;Display=All&amp;CSDFilter=5000]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The earliest Finnish immigrants to Canada came from the US, possibly as early as 1820's for the construction of the [[Welland Canal]].   The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] recruited immigrants directly from Finland in the late 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lindström-Best|first=Varpu|title=Geographical perspectives on Finnish Canadian immigration and settlement|journal=Polyphony|date=Fall 1981|volume=3|issue=2|page=16|url=http://www.ourfutureourpast.ca/loc_hist/page.aspx?id=3763469|accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadians of Finnish ancestry often formed a large percentage of left-wing organizations during the early 1900s, as Finland had, by 1906 as a part of the Russian empire, already become one of the first nations to adopt [[universal suffrage]].  Up until the early 1940s, the so-called "Red Finns," who held deep socialist convictions, far outnumbered "White Finns," the more religious and conservative Finns.  This was partially due to the number of political refugees escaping persecution after the [[Finnish Civil War]], but also attributable to the response of several, formerly apolitical Finns from rural [[Ostrobothnia (region)|Ostrobothnia]], to  harsh economic conditions.  Finnish Canadians with Marxist political views aligned themselves with the [[Social Democratic Party of Canada]] and later, with the [[Communist Party of Canada]], centered around the newspaper ''[[Vapaus]]'' (Freedom).  Many Finns, however, were distrustful of politicians as a result of the perceived failure and reformism of the Finnish Social Democratic Party during the general strike in November 1917 and the reformist policy the party adopted after the Civil War.  Finns arriving in Canada who had already faced severe class conflict and repression would line-up with the radical union, the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) emphasizing anti-authoritarianism and anti-statism.  The IWW would hold considerable influence in the mines and logging camps of Northern Ontario.

A decline in the Finnish-Canadian population began with the exodus 2000-3000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Karni|first=Michael G|title=Finnish diaspora I : Canada, South America, Africa, Australia and Sweden|year=1981|publisher=Multicultural History Society of Ontario|location=Toronto|isbn=0-919045-08-1|page=203|url=http://www.ourfutureourpast.ca/loc_hist/page.aspx?id=3765510}}&lt;/ref&gt;  skilled workers and loggers to [[Republic of Karelia|Soviet Karelia]] in the 1920s and 30s, and the large number of Finnish-Canadian volunteers in the [[Spanish Civil War]].  Finnish-Canadians, along with Ukrainians, formed the largest section of volunteers in the Canadian contingent of the [[International Brigades]], [[Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion]].  Finns formed the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalions "Ilkka" machine-gun company.  The period after the 1930s marks a decline in Finnish co-operative activity in Canada.

Canada started seeing a drastic increase in immigration from Finland during the late 1920s and forward, as the United States [[Immigration Act of 1924]] did not consider Finland to be among the Western European favourable countries to have immigration from, resulting in a strong restriction of 500 Finnish immigrants per year to the US.&lt;ref&gt;John Powell, "Encyclopedia of North American immigration", p. 99 | When passage of the restrictive Johnson-Reed act in 1924 drastically cut the Finnish quota, Finns increasingly turned their attention to Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite conservative "White" Finnish support for Nazi Germany during World War II, Canadian immigration policy in the 1940s favoured admitting "White Finns" to Canada.  This, combined with a fiercely anti-socialist view in the post-World War II era, led to a shift in the political balance of the Finnish-Canadian community.

[[Central Canada]] (mainly Ontario) has generally been the largest destination for Finns, followed by British Columbia, recording 72,990 (ON) and 29,875 (BC) Finns in 2006. Several small rural Finnish communities were established in [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/finns/ |title=Finns |author=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the communities of [[Thunder Bay]], [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] and [[New Finland, Saskatchewan|New Finland]] form the main centres of Finnish-Canadian activity. Thunder Bay boasts the largest Finnish population outside of [[Fennoscandia]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}, and the only Finnish cultural centre in Canada, housed in the [[Finnish Labour Temple]] along with [[the Hoito]] Restaurant. The Finnish-Canadian weeklies ''[[Canadan Sanomat]]'' and ''[[Vapaa Sana]]'' publish out of Thunder Bay and Toronto respectively. Another significant Finnish-Canadian newspaper, ''[[Vapaus]]'', was published in Sudbury from 1917 to 1974. Other prominent communities are [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]], [[Kirkland Lake]] and [[Timmins]], in Ontario.

In 2010, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) reported that 23.5 million Americans live in a food desert, meaning that they live more than one mile from a supermarket in urban or suburban areas, and more than 10 miles from a supermarket in rural areas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Food deserts lack whole food providers who supply fresh protein sources (such as poultry, fish and meats) along with whole food such as fresh fruits and vegetables, and instead provide processed and sugar- and fat-laden foods in convenience stores. Processed, sugar- and fat-laden foods are known contributors to the United States' [[Obesity in the United States|obesity]] epidemic.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://notes.nap.edu/2011/01/25/living-in-a-food-desert-how-lack-of-access-to-healthy-foods-can-affect-public-health/|title=Living in a Food Desert: How Lack of Access to Healthy Foods Can Affect Public Health {{!}} Notes From NAP|website=notes.nap.edu|access-date=2017-11-17|date=2011-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Convenience store prices are less affordable to regular consumers around the area.

== History ==
By 1973, "desert" was ascribed to suburban areas lacking amenities important for community development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Shaw |first=Hillary John |date=December 2003 |title=The Ecology of Food Deserts |type= |chapter=1.1. Origin of the term `Food Desert'|publisher=The University of Leeds School of Geography |page=11 |url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/1146142.pdf |access-date= August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cummins and Macintyre report that a resident of public housing in western Scotland supposedly coined the more specific phrase "food desert" in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="Cummins2002"/&gt; The phrase was first officially used in a 1995 document from a policy working group on the Low Income Project Team of the UK's Nutrition Task Force.&lt;ref name="Cummins2002"/&gt;

Initial research was narrowed to the impact of retail migration from the urban center.&lt;ref name="ford"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2008.00026.x |pmid=18366535 |title=Disparities in obesity prevalence due to variation in the retail food environment: Three testable hypotheses |journal=Nutrition Reviews |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=216–28 |year=2008 |last1=Ford |first1=Paula B |last2=Dzewaltowski |first2=David A }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies explored the impact of food deserts in other geographic areas (e.g., rural and frontier) and among specific populations, like minorities and the elderly. They address the relationships between the quality (access and availability) of retail food environments, the price of food, and obesity. The findings support that environmental factors contribute to people's eating behaviors. Research conducted with variations in methods draws a more complete perspective of "multilevel influences of the retail food environment on eating behaviors (and risk of obesity)."&lt;ref name="ford" /&gt;

== Definitions ==
Researchers employ a variety of methods to assess food deserts including: directories and census data, focus groups, food store assessments, food use inventories, [[geographic information system]] (GIS) technology, interviews, questionnaires and surveys measuring consumers' food access perceptions.&lt;ref name="Walker, R.E. 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walker|first1=Renee E.|last2=Keane|first2=Christopher R.|last3=Burke|first3=Jessica G.|year=2010|title=Disparities and access to healthy food in the United States: A review of food deserts literature|journal=Health &amp; Place|volume=16|issue=5|pages=876–84|doi=10.1016/j.healthplace.2010.04.013|pmid=20462784}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in the definition of a food desert vary according to the:

The multitude of definitions which vary by country have fueled controversy over the existence of food deserts.&lt;ref name="Walker, R.E. 2010" /&gt;

It should also be noted that because it is too costly to survey the types of foods and prices offered in every store, researchers use the availability of supermarkets and large grocery stores (including discount and supercenter stores) as a proxy for the availability of affordable, nutritious food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2010/march/access-to-affordable-nutritious-food-is-limited-in-food-deserts/|title=USDA ERS - Access to Affordable, Nutritious Food Is Limited in "Food Deserts"|website=www.ers.usda.gov|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distance ===
Distance-based measurements are used to measure food accessibility and identify food deserts.

The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) [[Economic Research Service]] measures distance by dividing the country into multiple 0.5&amp;nbsp;km square grids. The distance from the geographic center of each grid to the nearest grocery store gauges food accessibility for the people living in that grid.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/42711/12716_ap036_1_.pdf?v=41055|title=Access to Affordable and Nutritious Food: Measuring and Understanding Food Deserts and Their Consequences: Report to Congress|last1=Ver Ploeg |first1=M. |last2=Breneman|first2=V. |last3=Farrigan|first3=T. |last4=Hamrick|first4=K.|last5=Hopkins |first5=D.|last6=Kaufman |first6=P.|last7=Lin |first7=B-H.|last8=Nord |first8=M.|last9=Smith |first9=TA.|last10=Williams |first10=R.|last11=Kinnison |first11=K.|last12=Olander |first12=C.|last13=Singh|first13=A.|last14=Tuckermanty|first14=E.|date=Jun 2009|journal= Administrative Publication|number=AP-036|access-date= August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/19320248.2013.873009 |pmid=26294937 |title=Where Are the Food Deserts? An Evaluation of Policy-Relevant Measures of Community Food Access in South Carolina |journal=Journal of Hunger &amp; Environmental Nutrition |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=16–32 |year=2014 |last1=Liese |first1=Angela D. |last2=Hibbert |first2=James D. |last3=Ma |first3=Xiaoguang |last4=Bell |first4=Bethany A. |last5=Battersby |first5=Sarah E. |pmc=4540074 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Health Canada]] divides areas into buffer zones with people's homes, schools or workplaces as the center. The [[Euclidean distance]] is the shortest distance between the two points of interest, which is measured for gaining food access data.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/nutrition/pol/som-ex-sum-environ-eng.php|title=Measuring the Food Environment in Canada|last=|first=|date=11 Oct 2013|website=Food and Nutrition|publisher=Health Canada|access-date=13 Nov 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different factors are excluded or included that affect the scale of distance. The USDA maintains an online interactive mapping tool for the U.S., the "Food Access Research Atlas," which applies four different measurement standards to identify areas of low food access based on distance from the nearest supermarket.&lt;ref name="ers1"&gt;United States Department of Agriculture-Economic Research Service. Food Access Research Atlas (formerly known as the Food desert locator). Available at: http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first standard uses the original USDA food desert mapping tool "Food Desert Locator" and defines food deserts as having at least 33% or 500 people of a census tract's population in an urban area living 1 mile (10 miles for rural area) from a large grocery store or supermarket.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ploeg et al 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/aepp/ppu035 |title=Measuring Food Access and Food Deserts for Policy Purposes |journal=Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=205–25 |year=2014 |last1=Ver Ploeg |first1=M. |last2=Dutko |first2=P. |last3=Breneman |first3=V. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second and third standards adjust the scale of distance and factor income to define a food desert. In the U.S., a food desert consists of a low income census tract residing at least 0.5 miles in urban areas (10 miles in rural areas) or 1 mile away in urban areas (20 miles in rural areas) from the large grocery store.&lt;ref name="ers1"/&gt; The availability of other fresh food sources like community gardens and food banks are not included in mapping and can change the number of communities that should be classified as food deserts.&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt; A 2014 geographical survey found that the average distance from a grocery store was 1.76 kilometers (1.09 miles) in [[Edmonton]], but only 1.44 kilometers (0.89 miles) when [[farmers' markets]] and [[community gardens]] were included, making it 0.11 miles under the latter definition for an urban food desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.apgeog.2014.09.010 |title=Can community gardens and farmers' markets relieve food desert problems?

The fourth standard takes vehicular mobility into account. In the U.S., a food desert exists if 100 households or more with no vehicle access live at least 0.5 miles from the nearest large grocery store. For populations with vehicle access, the standard changes to 500 households or more living at least 20 miles away.&lt;ref name="ers1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/err143/33845_err143.pdf|title=Access to Affordable and Nutritious Food: Updated Estimates of Distance to Supermarkets Using 2010 Data|last=Ploeg|first=Michele|date=|website=A Report from the Economic Research Service|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Travel duration and mode may be other important factors.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2012.300675 |pmid=22897554 |pmc=3490650 |title=How to Identify Food Deserts: Measuring Physical and Economic Access to Supermarkets in King County, Washington |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=102 |issue=10 |pages=e32–9 |year=2012 |last1=Jiao |first1=Junfeng |last2=Moudon |first2=Anne V. |last3=Ulmer |first3=Jared |last4=Hurvitz |first4=Philip M. |last5=Drewnowski |first5=Adam }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, public transport is not included in mapping tools.&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1511/2011.90.209|title=Making Better Maps of Food Deserts: Neighborhoods with little or no access to healthful food can be located and studied using GIS mapping|journal=American Scientist |volume=99|issue=3|pages=209–210|year=2011|last1=Phillips|first1=Anna Lena|jstor=23019314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fresh food availability ===
A food retailer is typically considered to be a healthful food provider if it sells a variety of fresh food, including fruits and vegetables. Types of fresh food retailers include:
* supermarkets
* local grocery stores
* [[warehouse clubs]]
* [[community gardens]]
* farmers' markets
Food retailers like fast food restaurants and [[convenience store]]s are not typically in this category as they usually offer a limited variety of foods that make up a [[healthy diet]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Frequently too, the produce sold at convenience stores is poor quality.&lt;ref name="Bauer"&gt;Bauer, Katherine W. (2004, January 201). Price and Availability Matter. From The New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/01/23/can-wal-mart-make-us-healthier/access-to-healthy-foods-and-lower-prices-matter&lt;/ref&gt; A "healthy" [[Convenience store|bodega]] as defined by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene stocks seven or more varieties of fresh fruits and vegetables and low-fat milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2008 |title= Healthy Bodegas Initiative CEO Internal Program Review Report|publisher= New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene |location=New York, NY|url= http://www.nyc.gov/html/ceo/downloads/pdf/BH_PRR.pdf |page=17|access-date=July 20, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different countries have different dietary models and views on [[nutrition]]. These distinct national [[List of nutrition guides|nutrition guides]] add to the controversy surrounding the definition of food deserts. Since a food desert is defined as an area with limited access to nutritious foods, a universal identification of them cannot be created without a global consensus on nutrition.

=== Income and food prices ===
Other criteria include affordability and income level. According to the USDA, researchers should "consider ... [the] prices of foods faced by individuals and areas" and how "prices affect the shopping and consumption behaviors of consumers."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Access to affordable and nutritious food: Measuring and understanding food deserts and their consequences: Report to Congress. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Economic Research Service. Jun 2009. Web. 10 Nov 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; One study maintains that estimates of how many people live in food deserts must include the cost of food in supermarkets that can be reached in relation to their income.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

For instance, in 2013, Whole Foods opened a store in Detroit, where one third of the population lives below the poverty line. Whole Foods is known for their pricey healthy and organic foods. In order to attract the low income residents, the Detroit store offered lower prices compared to other Whole Foods stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2014/11/whole_foods_detroit_can_a_grocery_store_really_fight_elitism_racism_and.html|title=What Happened When Whole Foods Tried to Challenge Elitism, Racism, and Obesity in Detroit|work=Slate Magazine|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Whole Foods had not lowered the prices, residents would not be willing to shop there and Detroit would still be considered a food desert.

== Rural food deserts ==

The main difference between a rural and an urban food desert is the distance of residents from the nearest supermarket. Twenty percent of rural areas in the U.S. are classified as food deserts.&lt;ref name=policylink&gt;{{cite web |url=http://policylink.org/sites/default/files/FINALGroceryGap.pdf |title=The Grocery Gap |first1=Sarah |last1=Treuhaft |first2=Allison |last2=Karpyn |publisher=PolicyLink |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within these counties, approximately 2.4&amp;nbsp;million individuals have low access to a large supermarket.&lt;ref name="ers1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ers2&gt;United States Department of Agriculture-Economic Research Service. Rural income, poverty, and welfare report. Available at: http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/rural-economy-population/rural-poverty-well-being.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt; This difference in distance translates into pronounced economic and transportation differences between the rural and urban areas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foodispower.org/food-deserts/|title=Food Deserts |publisher= Food Empowerment Project|location=Cotati, CA |access-date=July 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.npc.umich.edu/publications/policy_briefs/brief23/|title=National Poverty Center {{!}} University of Michigan|website=www.npc.umich.edu|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 study of rural food deserts found key differences in overall health, access to food, and social environment of rural residents compared to urban dwellers.&lt;ref name="smithmorton"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jneb.2008.06.008 |pmid=19411051 |title=Rural Food Deserts: Low-income Perspectives on Food Access in Minnesota and Iowa |journal=Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=176–87 |year=2009 |last1=Smith |first1=Chery |last2=Morton |first2=Lois W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rural residents report overall poorer health and more physical limitations, with 12% rating their health as fair or poor compared to 9% of urban residents.&lt;ref name="smithmorton" /&gt; They believed their current health conditions were shaped by their eating behaviors when the future chronic disease risk was affected by the history of dietary intake.&lt;ref name="smithmorton" /&gt; Moreover, the 57 recruited rural residents from Minnesota and Iowa in one study perceived that food quality and variety in their area were poor at times.&lt;ref name="smithmorton" /&gt; The researchers reached the conclusion that, for a community of people, while food choice which bound by family and household socioeconomic status remained as a personal challenge, social and physical environments played a significant role in stressing and shaping their dietary behaviors.&lt;ref name="smithmorton" /&gt;

== Urban food desert ==

Food deserts occur in poor urban areas when there is limited or no access to healthful, affordable food options.&lt;ref name="Caspi 1254–1262"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caspi|first=Caitlin E.|last2=Kawachi|first2=Ichiro|last3=Subramanian|first3=S.

According to research conducted by Tulane University in 2009 2.3&amp;nbsp;million Americans lived more than one mile away from a super market, and did not own a car.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://socialwork.tulane.edu/blog/food-deserts-in-america|title=Food Deserts In America (Infographic)|website=socialwork.tulane.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; For those that live in these urban food deserts often times they do not have access to culturally appropriate foods.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Many people also do not get foods that meet their health restrictions such as allergies or food intolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://socialwork.tulane.edu/blog/food-deserts-in-america|title=Food Deserts In America (Infographic)|website=socialwork.tulane.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time and cost it takes for people to grocery shop makes fast food more desirable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://socialwork.tulane.edu/blog/food-deserts-in-america|title=Food Deserts In America (Infographic)|website=socialwork.tulane.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a price variance when it comes to small grocery stores that affect people in lower income areas from purchasing healthier food options.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Often times urban food deserts are applied to North America and Europe however in recent years it has become an idea that has been applied to Africa. It has taken time for researchers to understand Africa's urban food deserts because the conventional understanding of the term must be reevaluated to fit Africa's unconventional supermarkets.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholars.wlu.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1003&amp;context=hcp|title=Urban Food Deserts and Climate Change in Africa's Hungry Cities|last=Caesar|first=Mary|date=2016|website=Wilfrid Laurier University|archive-url=https://scholars.wlu.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1003&amp;context=hcp|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three categories for food deserts: ability-related, assets-related, and attitude-related.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Ability-related food deserts are “anything that physically prevents access to food which a consumer otherwise has the financial resources to purchase and the mental desire to buy”.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; An asset-related food desert involves the absence of financial assets, thus preventing consumption of desirable food that is otherwise available.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Lastly there are attitude-related food deserts any state of mind that prevents the consumer from accessing foods they can otherwise physically bring into their home and have the necessary assets to procure.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In Cape Town, South Africa  supermarkets take up a large portion of retail space.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; While supermarkets are expanding in poor neighborhoods in Cape Town there  food insecurity is growing at an alarming rate.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This is one of the biggest road blocks when understanding food deserts. Based on the European or American understanding of food deserts the fact that there is access to supermarkets by definition would mean that Cape Town does not suffer from food deserts.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Not only does Africa suffer from food deserts, but there is a direct link between climate change and the rapid growth of food deserts &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. While supermarkets are expanding to areas that once did not have supermarkets there is still a disparity when it comes to physical access.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In the city of Cape Town asset-related urban food deserts are the main reason for the food insecurity.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; People in this area unable to afford the food that they would prefer to eat.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  

Climate change plays an important role in urban food deserts because it directly effects accessibility. The main way that climate change effects food security and food deserts is that it reduces the production of food.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; With limited availability of a product the prices rise making it unavailable to those that cannot the rising prices.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In Cape Town specifically supermarkets rely directly on fresh produce from the nearby farm area.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Not only does climate change effect the production of food, but it can also damage capital assets that affect accessibility and utilization &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. Specifically in Cape Town the access to food deserts does not change the severity of food deserts.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; With limited diversity in their diets those that live in Cape Town are highly dependent on foods of low nutritional value and high calorific value.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Utilizing the European or American definition of food deserts does not take into account the dynamic market of other cultures and countries.   

== Beyond physical access ==
The primary criterion for a food desert is its proximity to a healthy food market. When such a market is in reach for its residents, a food desert ceases to exist. But this does not mean that residents will now eat healthy. A longitudinal study of food deserts in ''JAMA Internal Medicine'' shows that supermarket availability is generally unrelated to fruit and vegetable recommendations and over diet quality.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The availability of unhealthy foods at supermarkets may affect this relation because they tempt customers to overspend and indulge in luxury, pre-cooked foods. Supermarkets may have such an adverse effect because they put independently owned grocery stores out of business. Independently owned grocery stores have their benefits because they are more responsive to customer needs and provide food that adequately serves community members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Caruso|first1=Christine|title=Searching for Food (Justice): Understanding Access in an Under-served Food Environment in New York City|journal=Journal of Critical Thought and Praxis|date=2014|volume=3|issue=1|pages=2–3|url=http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/jctp/vol3/iss1/8/|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, simply providing healthier food access, according to Janne Boone-Heinonen et al., cannot completely eliminate food deserts, this access must be paired with education.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2014/02/food_deserts_and_fresh_food_access_aren_t_the_problem_poverty_not_obesity.html|title=Food Deserts Aren't the Problem|last=Gilligan|first=Heather Tirado|date=2014-02-10|newspaper=Slate|issn=1091-2339|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2018 article in ''Guernica'', [[Karen Washington]] states these factors beyond physical access suggest the community should reexamine the word ''food desert'' itself. She believes "food apartheid" more accurately captures the circumstances surrounding access to affordable nutritious foods. [[Karen Washington|Washington]] says, "When we say ''food apartheid'' the real conversation can begin." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guernicamag.com/karen-washington-its-not-a-food-desert-its-food-apartheid/|title=Karen Washington: It's Not a Food Desert, It's Food Apartheid|last=Brones|first=Anna|date=May 7, 2018|website=Guernica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to food options is not the only barrier to healthier diets and improved health outcomes. Wrigley et al. collected data before and after a food desert intervention to explore factors affecting supermarket choice and perceptions regarding healthy diet in Leeds, United Kingdom. Pre-tests were administered prior to a new store opening and post-tests were delivered 2 years after the new store had opened. The results showed that nearly half of the food desert residents began shopping at the newly built store, however, only modest improvements in diet were recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1068/a35150 |title=Deprivation, Diet, and Food-Retail Access: Findings from the Leeds 'Food Deserts' Study |journal=Environment and Planning A |volume=35 |pages=151–88 |year=2003 |last1=Wrigley |first1=Neil |last2=Warm |first2=Daniel |last3=Margetts |first3=Barrie }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/09590550410521798 |title=The Leeds 'food deserts' intervention study: What the focus groups reveal |journal=International Journal of Retail &amp; Distribution Management |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=123–136 |year=2004 |last1=Wrigley |first1=Neil |last2=Warm |first2=Daniel |last3=Margetts |first3=Barrie |last4=Lowe |first4=Michelle }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar pilot study conducted by Cummins et al. focused on a community funded by the Pennsylvania Fresh Food Financing Initiative. They conducted follow up after a grocery store was built in a food desert to assess the impact. They found that "simply building new food retail stores may not be sufficient to promote behavior change related to diet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2013.0512 |pmid=24493772 |pmc=4201352 |title=New Neighborhood Grocery Store Increased Awareness of Food Access but Did Not Alter Dietary Habits or Obesity |journal=Health Affairs |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=283–291 |year=2014 |last1=Cummins |first1=S. |last2=Flint |first2=E. |last3=Matthews |first3=S.

Jump up ^&lt;/ref&gt;

A separate survey also found that supermarket and grocery store availability did not generally correlate with diet quality and fresh food intake.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2011.283 |pmid=21747011 |pmc=3178268 |title=Fast Food Restaurants and Food Stores |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=171 |issue=13 |pages=1162–70 |year=2011 |last1=Boone-Heinonen |first1=Janne |last2=Gordon-Larsen |first2=P |last3=Kiefe |first3=C.

===Work and family===
People who have nonstandard work hours that include rotating or evening shifts may have difficulty shopping at stores that close earlier and instead shop at fast food or convenience stores that are generally open later.&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10834-010-9190-7 |title=Working for Peanuts: Nonstandard Work and Food Insecurity Across Household Structure |journal=Journal of Family and Economic Issues |volume=32 |pages=84–97 |year=2010 |last1=Coleman-Jensen |first1=Alisha J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under welfare-to-work reforms enacted in 1996, a female adult recipient must log 20 hours a week of "work activity" to receive SNAP benefits.&lt;ref name ="Cheese"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Michael |last1=Correll |year=2010 |title=Getting Fat on Government Cheese: The Connection Between Social Welfare Participation, Gender, and Obesity in America |url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1183&amp;context=djglp |journal=Duke Journal of Gender Law &amp; Policy |volume=18 |pages=45–77 |ssrn=1921920 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If they live in a food desert and have family responsibilities, working as well may limit time to travel to obtain nutritious foods as well as prepare healthful meals and exercise.&lt;ref name ="Cheese"/&gt;

=== Safety and store appearance ===
Additional factors may include how different stores welcome different groups of people&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt; and nearness to liquor stores.&lt;ref name="Food Deserts in Chicago"&gt;{{cite web |author=Illinois Advisory Committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights|title=Food Deserts in Chicago |date=October 2011 |url=http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/IL-FoodDeserts-2011.pdf |publisher=United States Commission on Civil Rights |location=Washington, DC |page=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Residents in a 2010 Chicago survey complained that in-store issues like poor upkeep and customer service were also impediments.&lt;ref name="Food Deserts in Chicago"/&gt; Safety can also be an issue for those in high crime areas, especially if they have to walk carrying food and maybe also with a child or children.&lt;ref name="Food Deserts in Chicago"/&gt;

===Fast food===
A possible factor affecting [[obesity]] and other "diet-related diseases" is the proximity of fast food restaurants and convenience stores compared to "full-access" grocery stores.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Proximity to fast food restaurants correlates with a higher [[Body mass index|BMI]], while proximity to a grocery store correlates with a lower BMI, according to one study.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

A 2011 review used fifteen years of data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study to examine the fast-food consumption of more than 5,000 young American adults aged 18–30 years in different geographic environments.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; The study found that fast food consumption was directly related to the proximity of fast food restaurants among low-income participants. 
The research team concluded that "alternative policy options such as targeting specific foods or shifting food costs (subsidization or taxation)" may be complementary and necessary to promote healthy eating habits while increasing the access to large food stores in specific regions and limit the availability of fast food restaurants and small food stores.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some cities already restrict the location of fast food and other food retailers that do not provide healthy food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Unger|first1=Serena |last2=Wooten |first2=Heather |date= June 21, 2009|title= A Food Systems Assessment for Oakland, CA: Toward a Sustainable Food Plan |url=http://clerkwebsvr1.oaklandnet.com/attachments/14033.pdf |location=Oakland, CA |publisher=Oakland Mayor's Office of Sustainability, University of California, Berkeley, Department of City and Regional Planning |isbn= |accessdate= |pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fast food restaurants are disproportionately placed in low-income and minority neighborhoods and are often the closest and cheapest food options.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; "People living in the poorest SES areas have 2.5 times the exposure to fast-food restaurants as those living in the wealthiest areas".&lt;ref name="yeh"&gt;Ming-Chen Yeh and David L. Katz. "Food, Nutrition, and the Health of Urban Populations". In ''Cities and the Health of the Public'' (Nicholas Freudenberg, Sandro Galea, and David Vlahov, eds.).

One study in South Los Angeles, where there is a higher percentage of African Americans, found that there was less access to healthier stores and more access to fast food compared to West Los Angeles, which has a lower African American population. In another study in New Orleans, it was found that communities that were predominantly African American had 2.4 fast food restaurants per square mile while predominantly white neighborhoods had 1.5 fast food restaurants per square mile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hilmers|first1=Angela|last2=Hilmers|first2=David|last3=Dave|first3=Jayna|title=Neighborhood Disparities in Access to Healthy Foods and Their Effects on Environmental Justice|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=2012|volume=102|issue=9|pages=1644–1654|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2012.300865|pmid=22813465|pmc=3482049}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers found that fast food companies purposely target minority neighborhoods when conducting market research to open new fast food restaurants. Existing segregation makes it easier for fast food companies to identify these target neighborhoods. This practice increases the concentration of fast food restaurants in minority neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.healthplace.2007.04.001 |pmid=17576089 |title=Fried chicken and fresh apples: Racial segregation as a fundamental cause of fast food density in black neighborhoods |journal=Health &amp; Place |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=32–44 |year=2008 |last1=Kwate |first1=Naa Oyo A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behavior and social and cultural barriers ===
The likelihood of being food insecure for Latinos is 22.4%, for African Americans 26.1% and for whites, 10.5%.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharma|first1=Shreela V|title=Multidisciplinary approaches to address food insecurity and nutrition among youth and their families|url=http://digitalcommons.library.tmc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1278&amp;context=childrenatrisk|journal=Journal of Applied Research on Children: Informing Policy for Children at Risk|volume=6|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who are food insecure often will find themselves having to cut back more at the end of the month when their money or food stamps run out. Month to month, there are other special occasions that may warrant higher spending on food such as birthdays, holidays, or other special treats.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Messer|first1=Ellen|last2=Ross|first2=Elizabeth M|date=2002|title=Talking to Patients About Food Insecurity|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=0a5f2e56-d743-499b-baea-8d734914844e%40sessionmgr4006&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU%3d#db=a9h&amp;AN=7303260|volume=5|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because people who are food insecure are still fundamentally involved in society, so they are faced with the other stressors of life as well as the additional frustration or guilt that comes with not being able to feed themselves or their family.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

Other studies have documented a sense of loyalty towards the owners of neighborhood convenience stores as an explanation as to why residents may not change their shopping behaviors.&lt;ref name="Walker, R.E. 2010" /&gt;

Steven Cummins also proposed that food availability is not the problem: it is eating habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/takes-grocery-store-eliminate-food-desert/|title=Why it takes more than a grocery store to eliminate a 'food desert'|work=PBS NewsHour|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pearson et al. urge food policy to focus on the social and cultural barriers to healthy eating.&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt; For instance, New York City's public-private Healthy Bodegas Initiative has aimed to encourage bodegas to carry milk and fresh produce and local residents to purchase and consume them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2011.300615 |title=Healthy Bodegas: Increasing and Promoting Healthy Foods at Corner Stores in New York City |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=102|issue=10|pages=e27–e31 |year=2012 |last1=Dannefer |first1=Rachel |last2=Williams|first2=Donya A|last3=Baronberg|first3=Sabrina |last4=Silver|first4=Lynn |pmid= 22897534 |pmc=3490666}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}Regardless of daily calorie intake, if a person does not eat foods that are rich in vitamins and nutrients they are susceptible to malnourishment related diseases. These diseases include [[scurvy]] which results from low vitamin C levels, [[rickets]] from low vitamin D levels, and [[pellagra]] from insufficient nicotinic acid.&lt;ref name=":122"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evan Grivetti|first1=Louis|date=March 1978|title=Culture, Diet, and Nutrition: Selected Themes and Topics|jstor=1307345|journal=BioScience|volume=28|issue=3|pages=171–177|doi=10.2307/1307345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutrient imbalances can affect a person, especially a developing child in a multitude of ways. Studies show that malnutrition in children can cause problems with academic performance, attention span, and motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alaimo|first=Katherine|date=July 2001|title=Food Insufficiency and American School-Aged Children's Cognitive, Academic, and Psychosocial Development|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/108/1/44|journal=Pediatrics|volume=108|issue=1|pages=44–53|pmid=11433053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006, the United States has seen an increase in cases of obesity.&lt;ref name=":132"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3945/ajcn.114.089284 |pmid=24760975 |title=Processed foods: Contributions to nutrition |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=99 |issue=6 |pages=1525–42 |year=2014 |last1=Weaver |first1=Connie M |last2=Dwyer |first2=Johanna |last3=Fulgoni |first3=Victor L |last4=King |first4=Janet C |last5=Leveille |first5=Gilbert A |last6=MacDonald |first6=Ruth S |last7=Ordovas |first7=Jose |last8=Schnakenberg |first8=David }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are not accessible grocery stores in many food deserts, so people do not have the option of eating fresh produce. Instead they have access to cheap, fast, and easy food which typically contains excess fats, sugars, and carbohydrates. Examples of such foods include chips, candy, and soda. Several diseases can result from consuming large amounts of these unhealthy food options, including [[cardiovascular disease]], [[hypertension]], diabetes, [[osteoporosis]] and even cancer.&lt;ref name=":142"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.cnpp.usda.gov/sites/default/files/dietary_guidelines_for_americans/PolicyDoc.pdf|title=Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010|last=|first=|publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.|year=2010|isbn=|location=Washington DC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fresh produce provides the body with nutrients that help it function effectively. Vegetables are good sources of fiber, potassium, folate, iron, manganese, choline, and vitamins A, C, K, E, B6 and more.&lt;ref name=":112"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/resources/2015-2020_Dietary_Guidelines.pdf|title=DIETARY GUIDELINES FOR AMERICANS 2015-2020 Eight Edition|last=|first=|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fruits are good sources of fiber, potassium, and vitamin C. The USDA recommends eating whole fruit instead of fruit juice because juice has less fiber and added sugars.&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt; Dairy products contain nutrients such as calcium, phosphorus, riboflavin, protein, and vitamins A, D and B12. Protein, a good source of vitamin B and lasting energy, can be found in both plant and animal products.&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt; The USDA also suggests to limit percentage of daily calories for sugars (&lt;10%), saturated fats (&lt;10%) and sodium (&lt;2300&amp;nbsp;mg).&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt; Although small amounts of sugars, fats, and sodium is necessary for the body, they can lead to various diseases when consumed in large amounts.

=== Processed foods ===
Even knowing the importance of nutrition, an additional barrier people may face is whether they even have the choice. Corner stores often only carry processed food, eliminating the choice of eating fresh. Processed food encompasses any type of food that has been modified from its original state whether from washing, cooking, or adding preservative or other additives. Because it is such a general category, processed foods can be broken down into four more specific groups: "unprocessed or minimally processed foods, processed culinary ingredients, processed foods (PFs), and ultra-processed foods and drinks (UPFDs)."&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3945/ajcn.117.160440 |pmid=28793996 |title=Ultra-processed foods in human health: A critical appraisal |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=106 |issue=3 |pages=717–24 |year=2017 |last1=Gibney |first1=Michael J |last2=Forde |first2=Ciarán G |last3=Mullally |first3=Deirdre |last4=Gibney |first4=Eileen R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original motivation for processing foods was to preserve them so there would be less food waste and there would be enough food to feed the population.&lt;ref name=":132"/&gt; By canning or dying fruits and vegetables to try and preserve them, some of the nutrients are lost and often times sugar is added, making the produce less healthy than when it was fresh. Similarly, with meats that are dried, there is salt added to help preserve it but results in the consumer having a higher sodium intake.&lt;ref name=":132" /&gt; The ultra-processed foods were not made to be nutrient rich, but rather to satisfy cravings with high amounts of salts or sugars, so they result in people eating more than they should of food that has no nutritional value.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Processed foods may also be made rich with nutrients that many people are lacking in their diets, making up for the lack of fresh food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nutrition.org/the-debate-over-the-health-effects-of-food-processing/|title=The Debate Over the Health Effects of Food Processing {{!}} American Society for Nutrition|date=2017-09-11|work=American Society for Nutrition|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some nutritionists may recommend eliminating processed foods from diets, while others see it as a way to reduce food scarcity and malnutrition.&lt;ref name=":132" /&gt; In 1990 the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act required nutrition labels on food, making it so people could see what and how much of something they were consuming. With that labeling what some companies did was list things that weren't added on the front, but rarely did they add information about nutrients they added.&lt;ref name=":132" /&gt; There are scientists and nutritionists looking into ways to create affordable, processed food high in essential nutrients and vitamins that also taste good so the consumer is inclined to buy them.&lt;ref name=":132" /&gt;

=== Alcohol ===
Many areas that are food deserts have disproportionately high numbers of liquor stores. For example, [[East Oakland, Oakland, California|East Oakland]] has 4 supermarkets and 40 liquor stores in their community.&lt;ref name=":92"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2013.04.021 |title=Foodways of the urban poor |journal=Geoforum |volume=48 |pages=126–35 |year=2013 |last1=Alkon |first1=Alison Hope |last2=Block |first2=Daniel |last3=Moore |first3=Kelly |last4=Gillis |first4=Catherine |last5=Dinuccio |first5=Nicole |last6=Chavez |first6=Noel }}&lt;/ref&gt; These communities are also often predominantly populated by ethnic minorities. Both Latinos and African Americans are predisposed to getting a disease from alcohol consumption. Some alcohol-related illnesses include stroke, hypertension, diabetes, colon and GI cancer, and obesity. There are also studies that show that consuming alcohol in moderation can reduce one's chance of getting cardiovascular disease and even extend one's mental stability into old age.&lt;ref name=":143"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.cnpp.usda.gov/sites/default/files/dietary_guidelines_for_americans/PolicyDoc.pdf|title=Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010|last=|first=|publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.|year=2010|isbn=|location=Washington DC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications for self care ==
[[Self-care|Self care]] is an essential component in management of chronic conditions and for those who are healthy. Self care is greatly influenced by food choices and dietary intake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2014.07.005 |pmid=25217097 |pmc=4205193 |title=Distance to Store, Food Prices, and Obesity in Urban Food Deserts |journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine |volume=47 |issue=5 |pages=587–95 |year=2014 |last1=Ghosh-Dastidar |first1=Bonnie |last2=Cohen |first2=Deborah |last3=Hunter |first3=Gerald |last4=Zenk |first4=Shannon N |last5=Huang |first5=Christina |last6=Beckman |first6=Robin |last7=Dubowitz |first7=Tamara }}&lt;/ref&gt; Limited access to nutritious foods in food deserts can greatly impact one's ability to engage in self care. Access, affordability, and health literacy are all [[social determinants of health]], which are accentuated by living in a food desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.healthplace.2010.04.013 |pmid=20462784 |title=Disparities and access to healthy food in the United States: A review of food deserts literature |journal=Health &amp; Place |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=876–84 |year=2010 |last1=Walker |first1=Renee E |last2=Keane |first2=Christopher R |last3=Burke |first3=Jessica G }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main health implications for those living in food deserts: [[overnutrition]] or [[undernutrition]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/ije/dyi276 |pmid=16338945 |title=Food environments and obesity—neighbourhood or nation? |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=100–4 |year=2006 |last1=Cummins |first1=Steven |last2=MacIntyre |first2=Sally }}&lt;/ref&gt; The community may be undernourished, due to inability to access food stores. The community may be overnourished due to a lack of affordable supermarkets with whole foods and a higher concentration of convenience stores and fast-food restaurants that offer pre-packaged foods often high in sugar, fat, and salt.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Food security|Food-insecurity]] remains a problem for many low-income families, but the greatest challenge to living in a food desert is poor diet quality. Living in a food desert contributes to a higher prevalence of chronic diseases associated with being overweight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stanforddaily.com/2015/05/03/food-deserts-hunger-and-obesity/|title=Food deserts, hunger and obesity|work=Stanford Daily|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Persons living in a food desert often face barriers to self-care, particularly in accessing resources needed to change their dietary habits.

=== Transportation and geography ===
People tend to make food choices based on what is available in their neighborhood. In food deserts there is often a high density of [[Fast food restaurant|fast-food restaurants]] and corner stores that offer prepared foods.&lt;ref name="Coveney &amp; O'Dwyer 2009"/&gt;

In rural areas [[food security]] is a major issue. Food security can imply either a complete lack of food, which contributes to [[Malnutrition|undernourishment]], or a lack of nutritious food, which contributes to over-nourishment.&lt;ref name="Coveney &amp; O'Dwyer 2009"/&gt;

According to the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usda.gov/|title=USDA|website=www.usda.gov|access-date=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; community food security "concerns the underlying social, economic, and institutional factors within a community that affect the quantity and quality of available food and its affordability or price relative to the sufficiency of financial resources available to acquire it."&lt;ref name="ruralhealthinfo.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/topics/food-and-hunger|title=Rural Hunger and Access to Healthy Food Introduction - Rural Health Information Hub|website=www.ruralhealthinfo.org|access-date=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rural areas tend have higher food insecurity than urban areas. This insecurity occurs because food choices in rural areas are often restricted because transportation is needed to access a major [[supermarket]] or a food supply that offers a wide, healthy variety versus smaller [[convenience store]]s that do not offer as much produce.&lt;ref name="ruralhealthinfo.org"/&gt;

It is critical to look at car ownership in relation to the distance and number of stores in the area. Distance from shops influences the quality of food eaten.&lt;ref name="Coveney &amp; O'Dwyer 2009"/&gt; A car or [[public transport]]ation is often needed to access a grocery store. When neither a car or nor public transportation is available, diets are rarely healthy. This is because fast food and convenience stores are easier to access and do not cost much money or time. Further, those who walk to food shops typically have poorer diets, which has been attributed to having to carry shopping bags home.&lt;ref name="Coveney &amp; O'Dwyer 2009"/&gt;

=== Adherence ===
Long-term adherence to a healthful, balanced [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] is essential to promote the well-being of individuals and society. Many approaches to helping people eat a healthy, balanced diet are ineffective because of "adherence problems" with behavior changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1559827613488867 |pmid=27547170 |pmc=4988401 |title=Long-Term Adherence to Health Behavior Change |journal=American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=395–404 |year=2013 |last1=Middleton |first1=Kathryn R |last2=Anton |first2=Stephen D |last3=Perri |first3=Michal G }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no universal definition of dietary adherence, but we know that dietary adherence is influenced by habits that develop over a lifetime.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

It is especially difficult to "adhere" to a prescribed diet and lifestyle (ex. [[Low sodium diet|low salt diet]], [[Low-fat diet|low fat diet]], [[Low-carbohydrate diet|low carbohydrate diet]], low sugar diet) when living in a food desert without enough access to items needed. When high sugar, high fat, and high salt items are the only foods available to people living in a food desert, dietary adherence requires (a) shift in lifestyle/ eating habits and (b) access to fresh, healthy, affordable foods.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Decision-making ===
Decision-making is an important component of self-care that is affected by food deserts. People employ both rational and naturalistic decision-making processes on a routine basis. Naturalistic decisions occur in situations where time is limited, stakes are high, needed information is missing, the situation is ambiguous and the decision-maker is uncertain. Rational decisions are more likely when people have time to weigh options and consider the consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/08870440008400300 |title=Processes of patient decision making: Theoretical and methodological issues |journal=Psychology &amp; Health |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=191–204 |year=2000 |last1=Broadstock |first1=Marita |last2=Michie |first2=Susan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The way individuals living in a food desert make decisions about healthy eating is influenced by a variety of factors. Communities with higher than state average poverty statistics often report low access to affordable food, thus limiting their ability to maintain a healthy diet.&lt;ref name="Hendrickson2006"/&gt; For these families living in poverty, many people work multiple jobs with rotating or evening shifts that make it difficult to find time to shop for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Anna Lena|title=Making Better Maps of Food Deserts|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2011/3/making-better-maps-of-food-deserts|journal=American Scientist|volume=99|issue=3|doi=10.1511/2011.90.209|year=2011|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Time constraints affect decision-making and people often choose to go to a closer convenience store rather than travel farther for fresh food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Correll|first=Michael|date=2010|title=Getting Fat on Government Cheese: The Connection Between Social Welfare Participation, Gender, and Obesity in America|url=https://journalistsresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Food-Stamps-and-Obesity.pdf|journal=Duke Journal of Gender Law &amp; Policy|volume=18|pages=45–77|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Families in urban food deserts may lack access to a car, which adds to the time needed to shop for groceries.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Additionally, convenience stores and corner stores are typically open later hours than a traditional grocery store, making them more accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10834-010-9190-7 |title=Working for Peanuts: Nonstandard Work and Food Insecurity Across Household Structure |journal=Journal of Family and Economic Issues |volume=32 |pages=84–97 |year=2010 |last1=Coleman-Jensen |first1=Alisha J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor that impacts those living in a food desert is safety. High rates of crime are a barrier for those living in food deserts.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book |date=October 2011 |title=Food Deserts in Chicago |publisher=Illinois Advisory Committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights |url=http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/IL-FoodDeserts-2011.pdf }}{{page needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; If people feel unsafe traveling farther to a grocery store, they are more likely to decide to purchase less healthy options at a closer location. In this way, people prioritize their safety over fresh, healthy foods.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Proximity to fast-food restaurants also influences decisions made when choosing meals. Proximity to fast food restaurants is related to having a higher BMI, while proximity to a grocery store is associated with a lower BMI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details/?pubid=42729|title=USDA ERS - Access to Affordable and Nutritious Food-Measuring and Understanding Food Deserts and Their Consequences: Report to Congress|website=www.ers.usda.gov|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that people living in the poorest areas of the country have more than twice the exposure to fast-food restaurants compared to people living in wealthy areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cities and the health of the public|date=2006|publisher=Vanderbilt University Press|others=Freudenberg, Nicholas., Galea, Sandro., Vlahov, David.|isbn=978-0826515124|edition=1st|location=Nashville [Tenn.]|oclc=558991544}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study used 15 years of data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study to examine the fast-food consumption of more than 5,000 young American adults aged 18–30 years in different geographic areas of the US.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Proximity to fast food or a supermarket/grocery store was used to predict the type of food consumed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In low-income study participants, the type of food consumed was directly related to the proximity of fast food restaurants.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These results suggest that low-income persons living in a food desert make decisions to consume fast food based on proximity to fast food restaurants versus distances to a grocery store.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Health literacy ===
While access poses a major barrier to the practice of [[self-care]] in food deserts, [[health literacy]] remains a common barrier to nutritional behavioral choices. Health literacy and food deserts can affect all sectors of the population, but it is known that they both unjustly affect underserved, low-income individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jada.2010.11.009 |pmid=21185958 |title=Serving the Public: Health Literacy and Food Deserts |journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association |volume=111 |issue=1 |pages=14 |year=2011 |last1=Rodriguez |first1=Judith C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Health literacy is the ability to obtain, read, understand, and use [[Healthcare|health]] information in order to make appropriate [[health]] decisions and follow instructions for treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Facilitating state health exchange communication through the use of health literate practices : workshop summary|date=2012|publisher=National Academies Press|others=Hewitt, Maria Elizabeth., Institute of Medicine (U.S.).

Additionally, health literacy and [[self-efficacy]] can predict the likelihood of reading food labels, which predicts dietary choices.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5993/ajhb.38.3.2 |pmid=24636029 |pmc=4039409 |title=Health Literacy, Self-efficacy, Food Label Use, and Diet in Young Adults |journal=American Journal of Health Behavior |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=331–9 |year=2014 |last1=Cha |first1=Eunseok |last2=Kim |first2=Kevin H |last3=Lerner |first3=Hannah M |last4=Dawkins |first4=Colleen R |last5=Bello |first5=Morenike K |last6=Umpierrez |first6=Guillermo |last7=Dunbar |first7=Sandra B }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of young adults in a metropolitan area found that those with low health literacy used food labels significantly less than a high health literacy group, suggesting that low health literacy may negatively influence dietary quality.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Overall, these data suggests that health literacy is a key factor in explaining differences in dietary habits, as healthy eating is associated with higher nutrition literacy skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jneb.2007.08.012 |pmid=18174098 |title=Increasing Nutrition Literacy: Testing the Effectiveness of Print, Web site, and Game Modalities |journal=Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=3–10 |year=2008 |last1=Silk |first1=Kami J |last2=Sherry |first2=John |last3=Winn |first3=Brian |last4=Keesecker |first4=Nicole |last5=Horodynski |first5=Mildred A |last6=Sayir |first6=Aylin }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jada.2011.08.042 |pmid=22732460 |title=Nutrition and Health Literacy: A Systematic Review to Inform Nutrition Research and Practice |journal=Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics |volume=112 |issue=2 |pages=254–65 |year=2012 |last1=Carbone |first1=Elena T |last2=Zoellner |first2=Jamie M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When considering health literacy and dietary self-care behavior, a study of persons with heart failure found that those with low health knowledge had poor self-care behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.pec.2016.01.003 |pmid=26830514 |title=Health literacy is independently associated with self-care behavior in patients with heart failure |journal=Patient Education and Counseling |volume=99 |issue=6 |pages=1026–32 |year=2016 |last1=Matsuoka |first1=Shiho |last2=Tsuchihashi-Makaya |first2=Miyuki |last3=Kayane |first3=Takahiro |last4=Yamada |first4=Michiyo |last5=Wakabayashi |first5=Rumi |last6=Kato |first6=Naoko P |last7=Yazawa |first7=Miyuki }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study reveals how health literacy influences one's ability to manage a health condition and make healthy choices. Gaining access to fresh and affordable food is essential to improving health and decreasing social disparities in those living in food deserts. Increasing health education and resources to improve health literacy are also vital in order for individuals to engage in healthy behaviors, adhere to dietary recommendations, and practice self-care.

==Impact==
One recent study showed that just 9% of the difference between high-income and low-income nutrition is due to food availability, while 91% is due to personal choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2139/ssrn.3095779 |title=The Geography of Poverty and Nutrition: Food Deserts and Food Choices Across the United States |year=2018 |last1=Allcott |first1=Hunt Mname |last2=Diamond |first2=Rebecca Mname |last3=Dubb |first3=Jean-Pierre Mname }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that grocery stores are actually more closely spaced in poor neighborhoods; and that there was no relation between children's food consumption, weight, and the type of food available near their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.12.036 |pmid=22381683 |title=The role of local food availability in explaining obesity risk among young school-aged children |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=74 |issue=8 |pages=1193–203 |year=2012 |last1=Lee |first1=Helen }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study suggested that adding a grocery store near one's home was associated with an average BMI decrease of 0.115, very small compared to the excess BMI of an obese person.&lt;ref&gt;https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/04/are-there-food-deserts-as-a-dietary-problem.html{{full citation needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Food Deserts Contributing to Black Stereotypes'''

The black community and people of color in general are targeted by large food corporations for unhealthy food choices through different media platforms. Foods industries such as sprite and McDonalds that have no nutritional value often promote their products with celebrities of color or big names in general. Often times food establishments with more healthy habits like Whole Foods are promote by a more European face. Psychologically there is more of an influence to purchase things that people of similar ethnicity also purchase so this is a repeated cycle. Food deserts and non-diverse promotion has backed a myth which makes people of color and other ethnic groups see colored people as being heavier naturally or because of there diet for years as a people. Colored people in lower income homes and communities have come to believe that the food they are eating does not affect health but more so there genes play a more important part. Although it is true that characteristics are common among races, this shouldn't affect a certain category in that said race. For the past 20 years women of color have become more easily obese. This is a very big problem when on the topic of human rights because this is showing that the current society that allows food deserts does not see low income colored communities as full citizens. There is no representation of clean eating or a healthy lifestyle for lower income colored and when there is it is very few. This shows an image or a stereotype of colored low income communities that the world sees and so does the nation. This also plays into these communities fulfilling the image or stereotype that is seen by the public/society that they are currently living in. One from an outside perspective would find it hard to judge the situation because there is no experience so the people in communities with lack of healthy food are a lot of times seen as wanting the type of unhealthy food in their communities. This relates back to human rights on a global scale because every human being deserves to have access to nutritional foods that are reasonably priced for that person or community income.

== Initiatives and resources ==
Recognition of food deserts as a major [[public health]] concern has prompted a number of initiatives to address the lack of resources available for those living in both urban and rural areas. On the larger scale, there have been national public policy initiatives.

=== Federal and state policy initiatives ===
In 2010, the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|US Department of Health and Human Services]], the [[United States Department of Agriculture|US Department of Agriculture]], and the [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Department of the Treasury]] announced their partnership in the development of the [[Healthy Food Financing Initiative]] (HFFI). With the goal of expanding access to healthy food options in both urban and rural communities across the country, HFFI has helped expand and develop grocery stores, corner stores, and [[farmers' market]]s, by providing financial and technical assistance to communities. The creation of these resources provides nutritious food options to those living in food deserts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/programs/community-economic-development/healthy-food-financing|title=Healthy Food Financing Initiative|last=|first=|date=|website=US Department of Health &amp; Human Services|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HFFI has awarded $195&amp;nbsp;million to community development organizations in 35 states. Between 2011 and 2015, HFFI created or supported 958 projects aimed at healthy food access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thefoodtrust.org/what-we-do/administrative/hffi-impacts/the-success-of-hffi|title=The Food Trust {{!}} The Success of HFFI|website=thefoodtrust.org|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The HFFI has also supported the development of statewide programs across the country, in California, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thefoodtrust.org/uploads/media_items/hffi-around-the-country.original.pdf|title=Healthy Food Financing Initiatives Across the Country|last=|first=|date=|website=The Food Trust|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Pennsylvania, the state program called the Fresh Food Financing Initiative (FFFI) provides grants and loans to healthy food retailers to create or renovate markets, including large supermarkets, small stores, and farmers' markets, in low income urban and rural areas across Pennsylvania. Because operating in underserved areas is more financially straining on retailers, the program provides subsidized financing incentives for retailers to open in areas where need is high. The Pennsylvania program's success influenced many other states to launch similar programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heart.org/idc/groups/heart-public/@wcm/@maa/documents/downloadable/ucm_495867.pdf|title=The Pennsylvania Fresh Food Financing Initiative|last=|first=|date=|website=American Heart Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Farmers' markets and community gardens===
Local and community efforts have made strides in combatting lack of access to nutritious food in food deserts. [[Farmers' market]]s provide local residents with fresh fruits and vegetables. Usually in a public and central areas of a community, such as a park, farmers' markets are most effective when they are easily accessible. Farmers' markets tend to be more successful in urban than rural areas due to large geographic distances in rural areas that make the markets difficult to access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irp.wisc.edu/publications/focus/pdfs/foc291f.pdf|title=Do Farmers' Markets Ameliorate Food Deserts?|last=McCracken|first=Vicki|date=|website=University of Wisconsin|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion of the [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]] (SNAP) to farmers' markets also helps make nutritious foods increasingly affordable. Each year, SNAP program participants spend around $70&amp;nbsp;billion in benefits; as of 2015, more than $19.4&amp;nbsp;billion were redeemed at farmers' markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://farmersmarketcoalition.org/advocacy/snap/|title=SNAP - Farmers Market Coalition|work=Farmers Market Coalition|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Double Up Food Bucks program doubles what every [[Electronic benefit transfer|Electronic Benefit Transfer]] (EBT) dollar spent at a farm stand is worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.doubleupfoodbucks.org/how-it-works/farmers-markets/|title=How it works at Farmers Markets – Double Up Food Bucks|website=www.doubleupfoodbucks.org|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incentivizes locals to shop for fresh over processed foods. [[Community gardening|Community gardens]] can play a similar role in food deserts, generating fresh produce by having local residents share in the maintenance of food production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/toolstemplates/entertainmented/tips/FoodDesert.html|title=Food Desert {{!}} Gateway to Health Communication {{!}} CDC|date=2017-09-15|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Food Trust, a nonprofit organization based in Pennsylvania, has 22 farmers markets in operation throughout Philadelphia. In an effort to increase accessibility for healthier food and fresh produce, Food Trust farmers markets accept SNAP benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Food Trust {{!}} At Farmers Markets|url=http://thefoodtrust.org/farmers-markets|website=thefoodtrust.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers have reported improved diets with increase in vegetable intake as well as healthier snacking habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Institute of Medicine and National Research Council|title=The Public Health Effects of Food Deserts: Workshop Summary|date=2009|publisher=The National Academies Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0-309-14068-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community gardens also address fresh food scarcity. The nonprofit group DC Urban Greens operates a community garden in Southeast Washington, D.C., an area labeled by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|US Department of Agriculture]] as a food desert. The garden provides fresh produce to those in the city who do not have easily accessible grocery stores nearby. The organization also sets up farmers' markets in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/urban-gardens-grow-residents-devotion-in-dc|title=D.C. urban gardens bring low-cost, fresh produce to city's food deserts|website=PBS NewsHour|access-date=2017-11-17|date=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the food desert of North Las Vegas, a neighborhood with one of the highest levels of food insecurity, another community garden is addressing food scarcity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/nv/newsroom/features/?cid=nrcseprd1311406|title=Community Garden is Oasis in Middle of Food Desert in Las Vegas {{!}} NRCS Nevada|website=www.nrcs.usda.gov|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; These community gardens can aid in education and access to new foods. Organizations such as the [[Detroit Black Community Food Security Network]] use community building gardens in order to promote community around healthy food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2979/racethmulglocon.5.1.13 |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/462927 |title=Sisters of the Soil: Urban Gardening as Resistance in Detroit |journal=Race/Ethnicity: Multidisciplinary Global Contexts |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=13–28 |year=2011 |last1=White |first1=Monica M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meal delivery, food trucks, and ride shares===
An entrepreneurial solution to food insecurity in food deserts is [[food truck]]s. In major urban centers such as Boston, mobile food markets travel to low income areas with fresh produce. The trucks travel to assisted living communities, schools, workplaces, and health centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/annefield/2015/09/15/in-boston-a-mobile-food-truck-serves-food-deserts/2/#5132837662e2|title=In Boston, A Mobile Market For Food Deserts|last=Field|first=Anne|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased availability of online food retailers and delivery services, such as [[AmazonFresh]] and [[FreshDirect]], can also help in food deserts by delivering food straight to residences. The ability for elderly people, disabled people, and those who live geographically far from supermarkets to use SNAP benefits online to order groceries is a major resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2017/08/29/how-the-amazon-whole-foods-merger-shrinks-food-deserts/|title=How the Amazon-Whole Foods merger shrinks food deserts|last=West|first=Jack Karsten and Darrell|date=2017-08-29|work=Brookings|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; For those who lack transportation options, [[Real-time ridesharing|rideshare]] services such as [[Uber (company)|Uber]] and [[Lyft]] may be vital resources to increase access to nutritious foods in food deserts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.recode.net/2017/5/8/15573708/uber-ubereats-food-shopping-delivery-low-income-opportunity|title=Uber needs a win. It could start by helping people in 'food deserts' access healthy foods.|work=Recode|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geisinger Health Services Fresh Food Pharmacy ===
In central Pennsylvania, an innovative solution to food insecurity for persons with [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] is the Fresh Food Pharmacy, which considers access to nutritious foods as vital as access to prescription medicine. Free groceries, all compliant with the [[American Diabetes Association]] guidelines, are provided to those in this program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/05/08/526952657/fresh-food-by-prescription-this-health-care-firm-is-trimming-costs-and-waistline|title=Fresh Food By Prescription: This Health Care Firm Is Trimming Costs — And Waistlines|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This unique program to address food insecurity for those with [[Chronic condition|chronic illnesses]] is a major resource for promoting [[self-care]] in food deserts.

=== Youth education ===
Food deserts are a result of lack of access to food and not enough money to afford the food that is available, which causes many people and especially children to not get enough nutrients their bodies require. Because there is a dominant concern of where the next meal will come from, people don't always care what they are putting in their bodies as long as it will keep them alive. The Grow Hartford Program was implemented in a school in Connecticut to have students address an issue in their community and they chose to focus on food justice.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00228958.2016.1223993 |title=Food Justice: Access, Equity, and Sustainability for Healthy Students and Communities |journal=Kappa Delta Pi Record |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=174–7 |year=2016 |last1=Roselle |first1=René |last2=Connery |first2=Chelsea }}&lt;/ref&gt; The youth involved worked on farms in the area to learn about the processes of food production and the importance and variety of vegetables. The program even led kids to start a community garden at their school. This program allowed the students to engage in hands on learning to educate them about agriculture, food scarcity and nutrition while helping bridge the gap of food access for some of their peers who could now bring home food from the surrounding farms or the school garden.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

The '''Forth and Bargy dialect''', also known as '''Yola''', is an [[extinct language|extinct]] [[English languages|variety of English]] once spoken in the [[barony (Ireland)|baronies]] of [[Forth (barony)|Forth]] and [[Bargy]] in [[County Wexford]], Ireland. It is thought to have evolved from [[Middle English]], which was brought to Ireland during the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasion]], beginning in 1169. As such, it was similar to the [[Fingallian]] dialect of the [[Fingal]] area. Both became extinct in the 19th century, when they were replaced by modern [[Hiberno-English]]. The name "Yola" means "old" in the dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hickey |first= Raymond|authorlink= |title= Dublin English: Evolution and Change |url= |accessdate= |year= 2005 |publisher= John Benjamins Publishing |location= |isbn= 90-272-4895-8 |pages=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dialect was spoken in [[County Wexford]], particularly in the [[barony (Ireland)|baronies]] of [[Forth (County Wexford barony)|Forth]] and [[Bargy]]. This was the first area English-speakers came to in the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]], supporting the theory that the dialect evolved from the [[Middle English]] introduced in that period. As such it is thought to have been similar to [[Fingallian]], which was spoken in the [[Fingal]] region north of [[Dublin]]. Middle English, the mother tongue of the "[[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]]" community, was widespread throughout southeastern Ireland until the 14th century; as the Old English were increasingly assimilated into Irish culture, their original language was gradually displaced through [[Gaelicisation]]. After this point, the Forth and Bargy dialect and Fingallian were the only attested [[relict]]s of this original form of English.&lt;ref name=Hickey2005&gt;{{cite book |last= Hickey |first= Raymond|authorlink= |title= Dublin English: Evolution and Change |url= |accessdate= |year= 2005 |publisher= John Benjamins Publishing |location= |isbn= 90-272-4895-8 |pages=196–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hickey2002&gt;{{cite book |last= Hickey |first= Raymond|authorlink= |title= A Source Book for Irish English |url= |accessdate= |year= 2002 |publisher= John Benjamins Publishing |location= |isbn= 9027237530 |pages= 28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modern English]] was widely introduced by British colonists during and after the 17th century, forming the basis for the modern [[Hiberno-English]] of Ireland. The new varieties were notably distinct from the surviving relict dialects.&lt;ref name=Hickey2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hickey2002/&gt; As English continued to spread, both the Forth and Bargy dialect and the Fingal dialect died out in the 19th century.

The dialect of Forth and Bargy was the only dialect in Ireland included in [[Alexander John Ellis]]'s work ''On Early English Pronunciation Volume V'', which was the earliest survey of dialects of English.  The phonetics of the dialect were taken from a local reverend.&lt;ref&gt;page 67 of ''On Early English Pronunciation, Part V. The existing phonology of English dialects compared with that of West Saxon speech'', A.J. Ellis, Truebner &amp; Co, London, 1889 http://www.openlibrary.org/details/onearlyenglishpr00elliuoft&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
As in the [[Dutch language]], in southwestern varieties of English and (to a lesser extent) in German, most [[voiceless consonant|voiceless]] [[fricative consonant|fricative]]s in Forth and Bargy became [[voiced consonant|voiced]]. The [[Middle English language|Middle English]] vowels are well-preserved, having only partially and sporadically undergone the changes associated with the [[Great Vowel Shift]].&lt;ref&gt;Hickey, R. (1988). A lost Middle English dialect. Historical Dialectology: Regional and Social, 37, 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

One striking characteristic of Forth and Bargy was the fact that [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] shifted to the second syllable of words in many instances: ''{{lang|yol|mor&lt;u&gt;saale&lt;/u&gt;}}'' "morsel", ''{{lang|yol|hat&lt;u&gt;cheat&lt;/u&gt;}}'' "hatchet", ''{{lang|yol|di&lt;u&gt;neare&lt;/u&gt;}}'' "dinner", ''{{lang|yol|rea&lt;u&gt;deare&lt;/u&gt;}}'' "reader", ''{{lang|yol|wed&lt;u&gt;deen&lt;/u&gt;}}'' "wedding", etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Rahilly |first=T.

===Articles===
The definite article was at first ''a'' or ''ee'', which was later replaced by ''the''.

===Verb ===
Forth and Bargy verbs had some conservative characteristics. The second and third person plural endings were sometimes -eth as in Chaucerian English. The past participle retained the Middle English "y" prefix as "ee".&lt;ref name="Poole 1867, p.133"&gt;Poole 1867, p.133.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nouns===
Some nouns retained the ''-en'' plural of ME ''children'', such as ''been'' 'bees' and ''tren'' 'trees'.

==Vocabulary==
The [[glossary]] compiled by Jacob Poole provides most of what is known about Forth and Bargy vocabulary. Poole was a farmer and member of the [[Quaker|Religious Society of Friends]] from Growtown in the Parish of Taghmon on the border between the baronies of Bargy and Shelmalier.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Poole of Growtown.&lt;/ref&gt; He collected words and phrases from his tenants and farm labourers between 1800 and his death in 1827.

Although most of its vocabulary is Anglo-Saxon in origin, Forth and Bargy contains many borrowings from [[Irish language|Irish]] and French.

* '''Bolsker''': an unfriendly person
* '''Chy''': a little
* '''Drazed''': threadbare
* '''Fash''': confusion, in a fash
* '''Keek''': to peep
* '''Saak''': to sunbathe, to relax in front of the fire
* '''Quare''': very, extremely
* '''Wor''': seaweed
Amain is a Norman word which means 'of easy use'

'''An Old Song'''&lt;br /&gt;
What ails you so melancholy, quoth John, so cross?&lt;br /&gt;
You seem all snappish, uneasy, and fretful.&lt;br /&gt;
Lie with us on the clover, 'tis fair and sheltered:&lt;br /&gt;
Come nearer; you're rubbing your back; why so ill-tempered?

Well, gossip, it shall be said; you ask what ails me, &amp; for what;&lt;br /&gt;
You have put us in talk, till the sun goes to set.&lt;br /&gt;
I am a fool, and a dunce; we'll idle out the day.&lt;br /&gt;
The more we spend here, the less in the churchyard.

Yesterday we had a goal, just in our hand.&lt;br /&gt;
Their gentry were quaking, themselves could not stand.&lt;br /&gt;
If Good-for-little had been buried, it had been my Tommy,&lt;br /&gt;
Who by misluck was placed to drive in.

Throngs and crowds from each quarter were at the Lough;&lt;br /&gt;
Such vapouring, and shimmering, when stript in their shirts!&lt;br /&gt;
Such bawling, and shouting, when the ball was thrown!&lt;br /&gt;
I saw their aim was to give us ne'er a stroke.

But with all their bravado, they soon were taught&lt;br /&gt;
That their errand was aiming to bring anguish upon them.&lt;br /&gt;
Such driving, struggling, 'till then we ne'er saw.&lt;br /&gt;
Nor such never will, no, nor never may.

===Address to Lord Lieutenant in 1836===
Congratulatory address in the dialect of Forth and Bargy, presented to the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] the [[Earl of Mulgrave]] [[Constantine Phipps, 1st Marquess of Normanby|Constantine Henry Phipps]] on his visit to Wexford in 1836 taken from the ''Wexford Independent'' newspaper of 15 February 1860. The paper's editor Mr Edmund Hore writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The most remarkable fact, in reality, in connexion with the address is this. In all probability it was the first time regal or vice-regal ears were required to listen to word of such a dialect; an it is even still more probable that a like event will never happen again; for if the use of this old tongue dies out as fast for the next five-and-twenty years as it has for the same bygone period, it will be utterly extinct and forgotten before the present century shall have closed.

''In order for a person not acquainted with the pronunciation of the dialect to form anything like an idea of it, it is first necessary to speak slowly, and remember that the letter a has invariably the same sound, like ''a'' in “father”. Double ''ee'' sounds like ''e'' in “me”, and most words of two syllables the long accent is placed on the last. To follow the English pronunciation completely deprives the dialect of its peculiarities.''

'''To’s Excellencie Constantine Harrie Phipps, y’ Earle Mulgrave, Lord Lieutenant-General and General Governor of Ireland. Ye soumissive Spakeen o’ouz Dwelleres o’ Baronie Forthe, Weisforthe.'''

MAI’T BE PLEASANT TO TH’ECCELLENCIE, – Wee, Vassalès o’ ‘His Most Gracious majesty’, Wilyame ee Vourthe, an, az wee verilie chote, na coshe and loyale dwellerès na Baronie Forthe, crave na dicke luckie acte t’uck neicher th’ Eccellencie, an na plaine garbe o’ oure yola talke, wi vengem o’ core t’gie ours zense o’ y gradès whilke be ee-dighte wi yer name; and whilke we canna zei, albeit o’ ‘Governere’, ‘Statesman’, an alike.

'''Standard English Translation'''

'''To his Excellency, Constantine Henry Phipps, the Earl of Mulgrave, Lord Lieutenant-General, and General Governor of Ireland. The humble Address of the Inhabitants of the Barony of Forth, Wexford.'''

MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY – We, the subjects of his Most Gracious Majesty, William IV, and, as we verily believe, both faithful and loyal inhabitants of the Barony of Forth, beg leave at this favourable opportunity to approach your Excellency, and in the simple dress of our old dialect to pour forth from the strength (or fulness) of our hearts, our sense (or admiration) of the qualities which characterise your name, and for which we have no words but of ‘Governor’, ‘Statesman’, etc. In each and every condition it is with joy of heart that our eyes rest upon the representative of the Sovereign, William IV, under whose paternal rule our days are spent; for before your foot pressed the soil, your name was known to us as the ''friend of liberty'', and ''he who broke the fetters of the slave''. Unto ourselves – for we look on Ireland to be our common country – you have with impartial hand ministered the laws made for every subject, without regard to this party or that. We behold in you one whose days are devoted to the welfare of the land you govern, to promote peace and liberty – the uncompromising guardian of the common right and public virtue. The peace – yes, we may say the profound peace – which overspreads the land since your arrival, proves that we alone stood in need of the enjoyment of common privileges, as is demonstrated by the results of your government. The condition, this day, of the country, in which is neither tumult nor disorder, but that constitutional agitation, the consequence of disappointed hopes, confirms your rule to be rare and enlightened. Your fame for such came before you even into this retired spot, to which neither the waters of the sea below nor the mountains above caused any impediment. In our valleys, where we were digging with the spade, or as we whistled to our horses in the plough, we heard the distant sound of the wings of the dove of peace, in the word ''Mulgrave''. With Irishmen our common hopes are inseparably bound up – as Irishmen, and as inhabitants, faithful and loyal, of the Barony Forth, we will daily and every day, our wives and our children, implore long and happy days, free from melancholy and full of blessings, for yourself and our good Sovereign, until the sun of our lives be gone down the dark valley (of death).

It is an identified cohort within the [[Strauss–Howe generational theory]].

They came of age amid rising national tempers, torrential immigration, rampant [[commercialism]], conspicuous [[consumerism]], declining college enrollment and economic disputes. This led to a distrust of [[Zealot (disambiguation)|Zealotry]] and institutional involvement, shifting focus to a life of materialism. As young adults, many pursued fortunes in frontier boom towns.&lt;ref&gt;John Franch, Robber Baron: The Life of Charles Tyson Yerkes (University of Illinois Press, 2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=FIYRJWiXiJkC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=gilded+generation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6nv1cVsBUq&amp;sig=LXJQ-ZaF8Zq6oE7XZBBYQORagx8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZvorVO25LcaKjAKw8ICACQ&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=gilded%20generation&amp;f=false  page 13].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Members of this generation were also of age by the time the [[American Civil War]] began.
 
==Notable persons==
Some of the notable persons who influenced this generation include [[Mark Twain]], [[JP Morgan]], [[Jay Gould]],&lt;ref&gt;John Franch, Robber Baron: The Life of Charles Tyson Yerkes (University of Illinois Press, 2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=FIYRJWiXiJkC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=gilded+generation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6nv1cVsBUq&amp;sig=LXJQ-ZaF8Zq6oE7XZBBYQORagx8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZvorVO25LcaKjAKw8ICACQ&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=gilded%20generation&amp;f=false  page 13].&lt;/ref&gt; [[John D.

'''Homecoming Scotland 2009''' was a series of events designed to attract people of [[Scottish ancestry]] to visit [[Scotland]]. The campaign, organised by EventScotland and [[VisitScotland]] on behalf of the [[Scottish Government]], and part-financed by the [[European Regional Development Fund]], claimed that "for every single Scot in their native land, there are thought to be at least five more overseas who can claim Scottish ancestry."

2009 was the 250th anniversary of the birth of [[Robert Burns]], the national poet. In addition to Burns-related events, the other four themes of the Homecoming were Scotland's culture and heritage, great Scottish minds and innovations, and golf and whisky.&lt;ref name="BBC events" /&gt;

== Calendar of Events ==
On 16 June 2008 Scotland's [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]], [[Alex Salmond| Alex Salmond MSP MP]], officially launched '''Homecoming Scotland 2009''' at [[Edinburgh Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stv.tv/info/news/20080616/First_Minister_launches_yearlong_Scotti_080616142926232 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205123312/http://www.stv.tv/info/news/20080616/First_Minister_launches_yearlong_Scotti_080616142926232 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-12-05 |title=stv news |publisher=Stv.tv |date= |accessdate=2010-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clangathering.org/content/homecoming-scotland-2009.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Homecoming started on 25 January 2009 ([[Burns night]]) and ran until 30 November 2009 ([[St Andrews Day]]).&lt;ref name="BBC events"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7790384.stm | title=2009 Homecoming events unveiled | publisher=BBC News | date=2008-12-18 | accessdate=2009-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 July 2009 a [[Clan Convention]], composed of the [[clan chief]]s, clan commanders and leading clan representatives of [[Scottish clan]]s, met to discuss the "Role of the Clan in the 21st century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clangathering.org/events/view/116 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105165942/http://www.clangathering.org/events/view/116 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-11-05 |title=clangathering.org - events }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Clan Convention took place within the [[Scottish Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/nmCentre/news/news-08/pa08-038.htm |archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20081126230923/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/nmCentre/news/news-08/pa08-038.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-11-26 |title=scottish.parliament.uk - news }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The centrepiece event of the year was [[The Gathering 2009]], on 25 and 26 July, centred on [[Holyrood Park]] in [[Edinburgh]]. The [[clan convention|clan gathering]] included [[highland games]] over the two days, a parade up the [[Royal Mile]] and a 'clan pageant' on the [[castle esplanade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clangathering.org/|title=clangathering.org home page|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401082950/http://www.clangathering.org/|archivedate=2008-04-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], the [[Duke of Rothesay]], is to be [[Patron]] of The Gathering 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clangathering.org/news/view/10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513030830/http://www.clangathering.org/news/view/10 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-05-13 |title=Royal Patron announced }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scottish Cup Sponsorship==

In October 2008, it was announced that the [[Scottish Cup]] would be re-branded as ''The Homecoming Scottish Cup'' for the 2008/09 competition. [[Glasgow]]-based businessman [[Willie Haughey]] signed a two-year sponsorship deal for the cup, handing the branding rights over to the [[Scottish Government]]. A new name was applied to the 2009/10 competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_cups/7659053.stm|title=Homecoming Scottish Cup unveiled | date=14 October 2008 | accessdate=5 January 2010 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of social media has helped people increase their outreach to a global audience.

{{quote|The Internet allows the masses to wrest control of fame from traditional media, creating micro-celebrities with the click of a mouse|David Weinberger of the [[Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society|Harvard Berkman Center for Internet and Society]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/TECH/05/01/roflcon/ "The new fame: Internet celebrity"] at [[CNN]]
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Micro-celebrities ==
A micro-celebrity is the state of being famous to a niche group of people on a social media platform. It's the self-presentation technique in which people view themselves as a public persona to be consumed by others. They use strategy intimacy to appeal to followers and regard their audience as fans. 

== Internet Competitions ==
[[Internet Icon]] is an [[American Idol]]-like competition between groups to see who can be "the next internet icon" or be able to run their own YouTube channel while sustaining an audience. It premiered on [[YOMYOMF]], and was hosted by [[Chester See]]. Notable judges include [[YouTube]] celebrity and actor [[Ryan Higa]]. 

Additionally, there is also a guest judge who appears on the show each elimination episode. The contestants complete challenges at the [[Los Angeles Center Studios]], where the show is also shot.

The competition aired for two seasons before cancellation due to funding issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=yellowpaco|title=INTERNET ICON SEASON 3!?!?!|date=2014-03-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWYx1AYYL5g&amp;list=UU0WpDW_SigANjRWBI1USgYw|accessdate=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wanghong ==
'''Wanghong''' ( “网红”), or internet fame in Mandarin, is the Chinese rendition of internet stardom. It is used to describe the  Chinese digital economy based on [[influencer marketing]] in social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecns.cn/business/2016/03-16/203077.shtml|title=Celebrity economy set for explosive growth in China|website=www.ecns.cn|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wanghong has been predominantly used to generate profits via retail or [[E-commerce|eCommerce]], by attracting the attention of celebrities' followers.

According to CBN Data, a commercial data company affiliated with Alibaba, the Internet celebrities economy is set to be worth 58 billion yuan in 2016, more than China's cinema box office in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2016-09/17/content_26812432.htm|title=China's Internet celebrity economy bigger than cinema{{!}}Society{{!}}chinadaily.com.cn|website=europe.chinadaily.com.cn|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main business models in the Wanghong economy: '''Social Media Advertising''', and '''Online Retailing'''.

In the '''online retailing''' business model, eCommerce-based Wanghong use social media platform to sell their self-branded products to potential buyers among their followers via Chinese customer to customer [[Customer to customer|C2C]] website, such as [[Taobao|TaoBao]]. Celebrities work as their own shops’ models by posting pictures or videos of themselves, wearing the clothes or accessories they sell, or giving distinctive makeup or fashion tips.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.chinadaily.com.cn/en/2016-03/16/content_23887534.htm|title=Celebrity economy set for explosive growth in China|last=|first=|date=|website=China Daily|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The celebrities serve as [[Key opinion leader|key opinion leaders]] for their followers, who either aspire to be like them, or look up to them.

[[Zhang Dayi]], one of China's best known Wang Hong with 4.9 million [[Sina Weibo|Sina weibo]] followers, she has her online shop in [[Taobao|TaoBao]] website, reportedly earning 300 million yuan ($46 million) per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-36802769|title=The making of a Chinese internet star|last=Tsoi|first=Grace|date=2016-08-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is comparable to the $21 million made by [[Fan Bingbing]], a top Chinese actress.

In '''social media advertising''', internet celebrities can be paid to advertise products. When celebrities have garnered sufficient attention and follower-ship, advertising companies approach them to help advertise products, which can then reach a large user base. 

[[Censorship]] in Chinese media has created an entire [[social media]] ecosystem, that has become wildly successful in its own way. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/understanding-social-media-in-china|title=Understanding social media in China|website=McKinsey &amp; Company|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For every social media platform the Western world, there is a Chinese version of it, and it can be equally successful. In China, the social media platforms used are different, but the results are the same - they generate revenue. The greatest difference between Chinese Wanghong celebrities and their Western counterparts lies in that, the profits they generate can be immense. Because unlike [[YouTube]], which takes a 45% of the commission on ads,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72902?hl=en|title=YouTube partner earnings overview - YouTube Help|website=support.google.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Weibo (company)|Weibo]], one of the biggest social media platforms of [[China]], is not involved in advertising whatsoever. That allows internet celebrities to be more independent and monthly incomes can exceed 10 million RMB ($1.5 million) for those at the top.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.northeastern.edu/rugglesmedia/2018/01/27/internet-celebrity-and-diversity/|title=How Do China’s Internet Celebrity Differ From America’s?|date=2018-01-27|work=Ruggles Media|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms==
Millions of people write online journals or [[blog|weblogs]]. In many cases these contributions do not make them notable on a large scale, or only for people with the same specialist interest. But if the author has or develops a distinctive [[Personality type|personality]], they may rise to fame derived from this as much as from the content of their blog.&lt;ref name=BFF/&gt;

In some cases, people might rise to fame through a single event or video that goes [[Viral video|viral]]. The Internet allows videos, news articles, and jokes to spread very quickly. Depending on the reach of the spread, the content may become considered an "[[Internet meme]]," and thus, any of the people associated may gain exposure for posting really intelligent content. For example, [[Zach Anner]], an [[Austin, Texas]]-based comedian gained worldwide attention after submitting a video to [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s "Search for the Next TV Star" competition. There is substantial searching online for people.&lt;ref&gt;Spink, A., Jansen, B.J., and Pedersen, J. 2004. [https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/jjansen/academic/pubs/jansen_name_searching.pdf Searching for People on Web Search Engines]. Journal of Documentation. 60(3), 266-278&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet [[celebrities]] have also become a popular phenomenon in [[China]] (PRC) with the likes of [[Sister Furong]] (Fu Rong Jiejie), who received worldwide notoriety and fame for her unashamed efforts at [[self-promotion]] via Internet postings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Celebrity in China|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YSjHUvePYVAC|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of web celebrity ties into [[Andy Warhol]]'s quip about [[15 minutes of fame]]. A more recent adaptation of Warhol's quip, possibly prompted by the rise of [[Social network service|online social networking]], [[blogging]], and similar [[List of Internet phenomena|online phenomena]], is the claim that "In the future, everyone will be famous to fifteen people" or, in some renditions, "On the Web, everyone will be famous to fifteen people".&lt;ref name="weinberger"&gt;{{cite web | title = Famous to fifteen people | url=http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/004264.html | author=Weinberger, David | authorlink=David Weinberger | date = July 23, 2005 | accessdate=December 21, 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061214124420/http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/004264.html |archivedate = December 14, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This quote, though attributed to [[David Weinberger]], was said&lt;ref name="weinberger"/&gt; to have originated with the Scottish artist [[Momus (artist)|Momus]].&lt;ref name="momus"&gt;{{cite web | title = POP STARS?

[[Social media]] personalities often function as [[lifestyle guru]]s who present a particular lifestyle or attitude to their spectators. In this role they may be crucial [[influencer]]s / multipliers for trends in the [[fashion industry]], variously also becoming popular ("[[:wikt:fashionista]]") as [[fashion blog]]gers or (unlearned) [[fashion designer]]s.

==Effects==
Occasionally an Internet celebrity has naively invited fans to meet him/her at a certain place and time, without proper organization, attracting crowds of fans, causing disorderly and even unsafe situations. Alternatively it can be organized in a venue, with security personnel. [[Magcon]] is an example of even a group of internet celebrities meeting fans in the latter way.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

[[File:Ryan Higa (7486876950).jpg|thumb|[[Ryan Higa]], known for is [[YouTube]] alias, [[Ryan Higa|Nigahiga]], is a successful YouTube personality.]]

==== Ryan Higa ====
[[Ryan Higa]], known by his [[YouTube]] username "nigahiga", is an American comedian, [[List of YouTubers|YouTube personality]], and actor. He is known for his comedy videos on YouTube, which have been viewed over 3 billion times. His YouTube channel has over 20 million subscribers, making him the 26th most subscribed YouTuber alongside singer [[Shakira]].

Higa was born in [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo]], [[Hawaii]], on the 6th of June 1990. He is of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] descent. In the mid-2006, Higa began making [[Lip sync|lip-sync]] videos with a good friend, [[Sean Fujiyoshi]] while attending [[Waiakea High School]]. They expanded their repertoire to include comedy pieces, with frequent guest appearances by Tim Enos, Ryan Villaruel, Kyle Chun, and Tarynn Nago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2008/01/11/features/screentime.html|title=starbulletin.com {{!}} Features {{!}} /2008/01/11/|last=Star-Bulletin|first=Honolulu|website=archives.starbulletin.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Initial efforts on the YouTube channel was fraught with copyright infringement. On Christmas Eve of 2008, Higa and Fujiyoshi's two most popular videos, ''How To Be Gangster'' and ''How To Be Emo'', were removed due to copyright violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=nigahiga|title=Copyrighted|date=2009-02-23|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCTAqdDfL58&amp;feature=player_embedded|accessdate=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nigahiga account was also temporarily suspended in January 2009, as more videos with copyrighted content was found, and were required to be removed. Most of the initial lip-sync videos that made Higa famous were all deleted as a result, except for one. 

Since then, Higa started composing the music himself. ''How to be Gangster'' and ''How to be Emo'' were put back on nigahiga's channel in late August 2009, only to be removed a few days later, along with ''How to be Ninja'' and ''How to be Nerd''. In Spring 2010, ''How to be Ninja'', ''How to be Gangster'' and ''How to be Emo'' were made public once more.

By December 2010, nigahiga has become the first YouTube channel to hit 3 million subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hawaiisocialmedia.com/2010/12/nigahiga/|title=Ryan Higa Hits 3 Million YouTube Subscribers - Hawaii Social Media|date=2010-12-22|work=Hawaii Social Media|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Higa, the channel name, nigahiga, is the combination of "niga" which means "rant" in Japanese, and "Higa", his last name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/the-youtube-comedians-earning-millions-153436484.html|title=YouTube comedians earning millions|last=|first=|date=|website=Yahoo Finance|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second channel, [[HigaTV]], was created in 2011. This channel posts videos on behind the scenes action for the main channel, and serves as a vlog for Higa. By 2017, this channel has 4.9 million subscribers.

Higa and Fujiyoshi have put together a production company, The Ryan Higa Production Company, to create videos for the nigahiga channel. Later, a parody K-pop group, [[Boys Generally Asian|Boys generally Asian]] was created by Higa and his friends.

==== Logan Paul ====
[[Logan Paul|Logan Alexander Paul]] (born April 1, 1995) is an American internet personality and actor from [[Westlake, Ohio|Westlake]], [[Ohio]]. Paul first gained fame through videos shared on former internet video service [[Vine (service)|Vine]].

[[File:10.8.16LoganPaulByLuigiNovi1.jpg|thumb|Logan Paul]]
Paul rose to fame as a member on the Internet video sharing service [[Vine (service)|Vine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-social-media-influencers-turn-followers-into-dollars/|title=Social media influencers turn followers into dollars|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014, he had over 3.1 million followers on various social media platforms.

Paul created his [[YouTube]] channel, TheOfficialLoganPaul, to upload [[comedy]] sketches and short films.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbwMZHCMpBiOWfYLBOH-9Qw|title=TheOfficialLoganPaul|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also has a [[vlog]] channel, "Logan Paul Vlogs", where he posts daily from September 12, 2016, to January 1, 2018. His first channel has 4.4 million subscribers, and his [[vlog]] channel has 15.7 million followers by January 2018.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Paul was at the center of a controversy when he filmed the [[Cadaver|corpse]] of a recently deceased Japanese man, in the suicide forest at [[Aokigahara|Aoikigahara]], at the foot of the [[Mount Fuji|Fuji Mountains]]. Initially intended to be part three of his "Tokyo Adventures" series, Paul and his group had planned to camp in the woods, but in response to finding the corpse, decided to notify the authorities and cancel their plans. The video gained 6.3 million views within 24 hours of being uploaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nymag.com/selectall/2018/01/logan-paul-suicide-forest-video-youtube.html|title=Logan Paul Posts Footage of Apparent Suicide Victim on YouTube|last=Swearingen|first=Jake|work=Select All|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the backlash, Paul removed the video from his YouTube channel, following up with a written apology on [[Twitter]] on January 1, 2018. On January 2, 2018, a subsequent video apology was released to YouTube in which Paul describes his behavior as a "[[Coping (psychology)|coping mechanism]]," asking his fans to stop defending his actions in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2018/01/02/logan-paul-speaks-uploading-suicide-video-body-hanging-forest-7196120/|title=Logan Paul speaks out after uploading 'suicide' video of dead body in forest|date=2018-01-02|work=Metro|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; While acknowledging his actions as irresponsible, he denied that his intention was to mock the victim. 

Paul uploaded a video on January 24, looking at [[suicide prevention]], interviewing  [[Suicides at the Golden Gate Bridge|Golden Gate Bridge jumper]] Kevin Hines, musical [[activist]] [[Bob Forrest]], and [[National Suicide Prevention Lifeline]] director Dr. John Draper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Logan Paul Vlogs|title=Suicide: Be Here Tomorrow.|date=2018-01-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWjxSkJpxFU|accessdate=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video was well received with a total of 29 million views as of 4 April 2018.

=== Accidental internet celebrities ===

==== Blake Boston (Scumbag Steve) ====
[[Scumbag Steve]] came to fame back in 2011. The meme centered around the photo of a young man wearing a hat backward and askance. The overlaid text generally centers around unethical behavior regarding drugs, partying, and other hedonistic behaviors.

The original image came from the cover of the album “Ma Gangsta”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/magangsta21890|title=BZB (BTM) (magangsta21890) on Myspace|website=Myspace|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the rap group Beantown Mafia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/beantownmafia|title=BTM {{!}} Listen and  Stream Free Music, Albums, New Releases, Photos, Videos|website=Myspace|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known images were posted in a compilation to Reddit&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/f65ra/i_hated_this_dude/|title=I hated this dude • r/funny|website=reddit|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a thread that reached the front page on January 21st, 2011 and received 8,607 upvotes prior to being archived. A commenter in the Reddit thread identified the young man in the photo as [[Blake Boston]], also known as “Weezy B.”

In an interview with [[Know Your Meme]], Blake revealed that the picture was originally taken by his mother.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1355793/Scumbag-Steve-Blake-Boston-speaks-Internet-hate-figure-reveals-famous-picture-taken-mother.html|title=Who is 'Scumbag Steve'? Internet teenage hate figure reveals infamous picture was taken by his mother (and he's actually quite a nice guy)|work=Mail Online|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Boston had a very mixed feelings about his fame. The original reaction to his newfound infamy led to people threatening him and his family for no reason. In an interview with [[Know Your Meme]], he said: "People started blowing up [calling] my phone, telling me I was all over the net. At first it went deep. Then I couldn’t help but laugh. People got my name, my phone, my Facebook, started callin’. Callin’ me all kind of racist things, callin’ my girl and my family all hours of the night."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He eventually came to terms with his likeness becoming a part of internet lore. 

The meme was particularly well received by Reddit’s /r/trees subreddit, leading to creation of many image macros with references to smoking etiquettes and commonly shared experiences under the influence of cannabis. Blake later confirmed his appreciation of the marijuana enthusiast subreddit, /trees.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1355793/Scumbag-Steve-Blake-Boston-speaks-Internet-hate-figure-reveals-famous-picture-taken-mother.html|title=Scumbag Steve|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-04-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Boston announced his intention to capitalize on the fame he had gained through this meme by releasing one song on [[iTunes]] every Thursday, under the alias "Blake Boston AKA Scumbag Steve".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-12|title=Scumbag Steve|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scumbag_Steve&amp;oldid=830111394|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kheyang''' is the exonym of the '''Hyow'''. There '''Kheyang''' or the '''Hyow''' (খেয়াং), are a group of indigenous people inhabiting in the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] of [[Bangladesh]] and the [[Rakhine State]] of [[Myanmar]]. The word '''Kheyang''' originated in '''''khlɔng '''''(see VanBik, 2009: 3-4), which means '''''person''' ''in the language. The endonym '''Hyow '''means '''''Chin.'''''  The Khyang are one of the smallest ethnic groups in [[Bangladesh]] with a population of only 2,345 according to the 1991 census. At present, the approximate number of the Khyang in Bangladesh is 4500. They live in [[Kaptai Upazila|Kaptai]] and [[Chandraghona]] in [[Rangamati Hill District]] and in [[Bandarban Sadar Upazila|Bandarban Sadar]], [[Thanchi Upazila|Thanchi]] and [[Rowangchhari Upazila|Rowangcchari]] upazila in [[Bandarban District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Saradindu Shekhar Chakma|title=Ethnic Cleansing in Chittagong Hill Tracts|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;
. In Myanmar, they live in the [[Myebon Township|Myebon]], [[Minbya Township|Minbya]] and [[Ann Township|Ann townships]] of the [[Rakhine State]].

==History==
According to Kheyang Chronicles, the Khyangs with their King entered [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] when their kingdom in [[Burma]] was overrun by the [[Burma|Burmese]]. But afterwards the King decided to go back to [[Burma]]. But his younger queen being pregnant could not accompany him. Hence she was left behind with some followers and kinsmen. The present Kheyang are the descendants of this queen and her retinue. However, the literature of the Burmese history tells that the Kheyang migrated with the Marma from the southern Myanmar in the late eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = History of Burma, including Burma proper, Pegu, Taungu, Tenasserim, and Arakan.

The Kheyang were Buddhists but many converted to Christianity during the British period. Most Khyang today are under the Mong family or the "Royal Family" which is from Chandraghona, Rangamati Hill Districts in Bangladesh.

==Social system==
Every Khyang society has a leader who is called ‘Karbari’ or ‘Headman.’ Kheyang society has a patriarchal structure. The father of a family is the master of the house. If a village lacks a headman, the villagers unitedly appoint a leader. The leader solves all the disputes that may develop among the villagers and, thus, helps them live in peace. If a person is accused of any criminal wrongdoing, the headmantakes steps in line with customary social laws.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ebbd.info/khyengs-social-system.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The accused is generally punished or forgiven, and the judgement is passed in front of all after measuring the enormity of the misdeed. Both the male and female of the Kheyang community are very industrious. Men dominate and especially follow the laws of society.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ebbd.info/khyengs-social-system.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Limba''' people are a major [[ethnic group]] in the [[Sierra Leone]]. They form the third largest ethnic group in the country, about 8.5% of Sierra Leone's total population (about 566,529 members).

The Limba are [[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous people]] of Sierra Leone and speak various dialects of a language largely unrelated to other tribal languages in Sierra Leone. They are primarily found in the [[Northern Province, Sierra Leone|Northern Province]], particularly in [[Bombali District]], [[Koinadugu District|Koinadugu]] and [[Kambia District]]. During Sierra Leone's [[Colony|colonial]] era thousands of Limbas migrated to the capital city of [[Freetown]] and its [[Western Area]]. As a result, a significant number of Limbas can be found in Freetown and its surrounding [[Western Area]]. During the 16th, 17th, and 18th century, many Limba people were shipped to [[North America]] as [[slaves]].

The Limba are mainly rice farmers, traders and hunters who live in the savannah-woodland region in the [[Northern Province, Sierra Leone|Northern Province]] of [[Sierra Leone]].  They predominate in 7 of Sierra Leone's 149 rural chiefdoms, and their community affairs are dominated by the local [[paramount chief]]s.

== History ==
Members of the Limba tribe believe that they have always lived in Sierra Leone in the Wara Wara mountains and were probably the first rulers of the country. It is believed by some historians that the Limba have already been living in Sierra Leone when colony take place. They were also brilliant scholars and philosophers brought their knowledge of agriculture and trade with them and with that built a society based on this sole ideal: If you work and respect the land properly then you are worthy to enjoy the fruits of your labor. During the colonial era of Sierra Leone, many Limba people were captured and sold at [[Bunce Island]] as slaves to the [[Americas]] through the Atlantic slave trade. To escape this, many Limba people traveled to the capital city of Freetown and the Western area and as a result, most Limba are located in these places.

==Culture==
The Limba consider themselves to be a mountain people and have at points in their history found themselves pushed into the mountains particularly during the periods of [[Susu people|Susu]] expansionism. Historically, they also had to fight off incursions from the [[Fula people|Fula]] and the [[Mandinka people|Mandingo]]. The Limba take pride in their unique language which differs from the other languages spoken in Sierra Leone. As a result, Limbas strive to be very articulate with their vocabulary as a way of sticking out among the rest. They are mostly rice farmers, palm wine brewers and stone builders. They have names similar to the Temne people. They also have a past and current interest in politics, for example [[Siaka Stevens]] as the first president of Sierra Leone from 1971-1985, [[Ernest Bai Koroma]] as the current president of Sierra Leone from 2007, Christian Alusine Karamara-Taylor as a founding member of the [[All People's Congress]] and [[Paolo Conteh]], the current defence minister and Eric Dura Sesay as the Bombali district chairman.According to folklore, Limbas make excellent political leaders because they are descendants of the original rulers of Sierra Leone. The Limba's main sport of interest is [[soccer]] which is quite common amongst nations in [[West Africa]]. Some popular Limba soccer players are [[Lamin Conteh]] and Saidu Tibati Kanu. The Limba have a spiritual home called Kakoia and they believe all Limbas return to the mountain through the town beyond a "door" through the rock. An ancient wooden figure discovered in a cave at Kakoia was probably made by the Limba people. Now in the [[British Museum]], it may have represented an ancestor or deity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=632587&amp;partId=1&amp;people=35589&amp;peoA=35589-3-17&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; They also have a folklore about spirits called Krifi but information about this is limited.

== Religion and spiritual beliefs ==

===Christianity===
The Limba in the southern province are mostly influenced by [[Christianity]]. Portuguese Christian missionary efforts began before the [[Reformation|Protestant Reformation]] but had no lasting effects on the Temne. The Protestant presence accompanied the founding of Freetown in the late eighteenth century; Church Missionary Society representatives were active up the Rokel River and elsewhere in Temne country throughout the nineteenth century. In the 1890s the Soudna Mission was the first [[United States|American]] mission in the Temne area; American Wesleyans and the Evangelical United Brethren subsequently joined the field. Today, 65% of Limba are followers of [[Christianity]].

===Islam===
The Limba in the Northern Province are somewhat influenced by [[Islam]]. [[Muslim]] contacts probably go back several centuries, and fifteenth-century Portuguese were cognizant of Muslim peoples. Early traders, holy men, and warriors brought Islam into the Temne area from the north by the [[Susu people|Susu]] and northeast by the [[Fula people|Fula]] and [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]]. Through the nineteenth century, as the volume of trade grew, Muslim influences increased; in the late twentieth century a significant proportion of Temne claim to be Muslim converts.

Although 30% of Limba have converted to Islam, they still practice their traditional religion, as well.

== Notable Limbas ==

Common Limba surnames include Conteh, Sesay, Dumbuya, Kargbo, Samura, Kamara, Turay, Bangura,Thoronka, Mansaray, Koroma, and Kanu.

'''Lish''' (also called '''Lishpa''' or '''Khispi''') is a [[Kho-Bwa languages|Kho-Bwa]] language of [[West Kameng district]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]] in India. It is closely related to [[Chug language|Chug]].

The Lish (population 1,567 in 1981) live in Dirang village, a few miles from Chug village, and in Gompatse. The Gompatse variety is not Lish proper, but is rather a lect closely related to Lish.&lt;ref name="Blench2015"&gt;Blench, Roger. 2015.

This is a '''list of Asian cuisines''', by region. A cuisine is a characteristic style of [[cooking]] practices and traditions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/cuisine "Cuisine."] [http://www.thefreedictionary.com Thefreedictionary.com]. Accessed June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; usually associated with a specific [[culture]] or region. Asia, being the largest and most populous [[continent]], has many great cuisines.

== Central Asian cuisine ==
[[File:Central Asia (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|Location of [[Central Asia]]. In some definitions, it also includes [[Afghanistan]] (south of area shown).]]

* Central Asian cuisine includes food from [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]].
** [[Bukharan cuisine]] - cuisine of [[Bukhara Jews]] with great influence Uzbeks cuisine
** [[Kazakh cuisine]] &amp;ndash; cuisine of [[Kazakhstan]]. Traditional Kazakh cuisine revolves around [[mutton]] and [[horse meat]], as well as various [[Dairy product|milk products]]. For hundreds of years, Kazakhs were herders who raised fat-tailed sheep, Bactrian camels, and horses, relying on these animals for transportation, clothing, and food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Kazakhstan|work= foodbycountry.com|accessdate= April 18, 2011|url= http://www.foodbycountry.com/Kazakhstan-to-South-Africa/Kazakhstan.html|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110520105036/http://www.foodbycountry.com/Kazakhstan-to-South-Africa/Kazakhstan.html|archivedate= May 20, 2011|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*** [[Kazakh wine]]
** [[Kyrgyz cuisine]] &amp;ndash; originating in [[Kyrgyzstan]], is similar in many respects to that of its neighbors, particularly Kazakh cuisine. Traditional Kyrgyz food includes mutton and horse meat, as well as milk products. The cooking techniques and major ingredients have been strongly influenced by the nation's nomadic way of life.
** [[Karakalpaks cuisine]]([[:ru:Каракалпакская кухня]]) - similar to Kazakhs and Kyrgyz cuisines with great influence Uzbeks cuisine
** [[Tajik cuisine]] &amp;ndash; traditional cuisine of [[Tajikistan]], has much in common with Afghan, Russian, and Uzbek cuisines. ''[[Pilaf|Plov]]'', also called ''[[Osh (food)|osh]]'', is the national dish in Tajikistan, as in other countries in the region. It consists of chunks of mutton, [[carrot]]s and rice fried in a large cast-iron cauldron similar to a [[Dutch oven]]. [[Green tea]] is the national drink. Traditional Tajik meals start with a spread of dried fruit, nuts, [[halva]], and other sweets arrayed on the table in small dishes, and then progress to soup and meat, before finishing with plov.
** [[Turkmen cuisine]] &amp;ndash; cuisine of [[Turkmenistan]]. It is similar to that of the rest of [[Central Asia]]. Plov is the staple, everyday food, which is also served at celebrations. Turkmenistan is perhaps most famous for its [[melon]]s, especially in the former [[Soviet Union]], where it was once the major supplier. Meals are almost always served with [[naan]], Central Asian [[flat bread]], known locally as "çörek."
** [[Uzbek cuisine]] &amp;ndash; cuisine influenced by local [[Agriculture in Uzbekistan|agriculture]], as in most nations. There is a great deal of grain farming in Uzbekistan, so breads and noodles are of importance, and Uzbek cuisine has been characterized as "noodle-rich".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/nyclife/9903,sietsema,3569,19.html "The noodle-rich cuisine of Uzbekistan"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211200812/http://www.villagevoice.com/nyclife/9903,sietsema,3569,19.html |date=2007-12-11 }}, ''The Village Voice'', Dining, 19 January 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Mutton is a popular variety of meat due to the abundance of sheep in the country and it is a part of various Uzbek dishes. Uzbekistan's signature dish is ''[[Pilaf|palov]]'' (''[[Osh (food)|osh]]'') made with rice, pieces of meat, grated carrots and onions.

** Chinese cuisine originated in what is known as the Eight Great Traditions, though it can be generalized into northern styles that feature oils and strong flavors derived from ingredients such as vinegar and garlic, while southern styles tend to favor fresh ingredients that are lightly prepared. It has become widespread throughout many other parts of the world — from [[Asia]] to the [[Americas]], Australia, [[Western Europe]] and [[Southern Africa]]. In recent years, connoisseurs of Chinese cuisine have also sprouted in [[Eastern Europe]] and [[South Asia]]. [[American Chinese cuisine]] and [[Canadian Chinese cuisine|Canadian Chinese food]] are popular examples of local varieties. Local ingredients would be adopted while maintaining the style and preparation technique.

** Great Traditions
*** Eight Great Traditions – Regional cultural differences vary greatly amongst the different regions of China, giving rise to eight main regional [[cuisine]]s, or Eight Great Traditions (八大菜系, Bā Dà Cài Xì)
***# [[Anhui cuisine|Anhui]] is derived from the native cooking styles of the [[Huangshan Mountains]] region in China and is similar to Jiangsu cuisine. It is known for the use of wild herbs, from both land and sea, and simple methods of preparation.
***# [[Cantonese cuisine|Cantonese]] comes from [[Guangdong Province]] in southern China.&lt;ref name="Hsiung"&gt;Hsiung, Deh-Ta. Simonds, Nina. Lowe, Jason. [2005] (2005). The food of China: a journey for food lovers. Bay Books. {{ISBN|978-0-681-02584-4}}. p17.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to [[Guangdong]]'s location on the southern coast of China, fresh live seafood is prominent in Cantonese cuisine. Canton has long been a trading port and many imported foods and ingredients are used in Cantonese cuisine. [[Char siu]] is a popular way to flavor and prepare pork in Cantonese cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;TVB. "[http://pearl.tvb.com/dolcevita/finedining/ TVB] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101015118/http://pearl.tvb.com/dolcevita/finedining/ |date=2010-11-01 }}." ''廣東菜最具多元烹調方法.'' Retrieved on 2008-11-19.&lt;/ref&gt;
***# [[Fujian cuisine|Fujian]] is one of the native Chinese cuisines derived from the native cooking style of the [[Province of China|province]] of [[Fujian]], China. Many diverse [[seafood]]s and woodland delicacies are used, including a myriad of fish, shellfish and turtles, along with [[edible mushroom]]s and [[bamboo shoot]]s, provided by the coastal and mountainous regions of Fujian.&lt;ref name=zgds&gt;{{citation|title=中国饮食文化概论 |last=徐|first=文苑 |publisher=清华大学出版社 |year=2005 |pages=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
***# [[Hunan cuisine|Hunan]], sometimes called '''Xiang cuisine''', consists of the cuisines of the [[Xiang River]] region, [[Dongting Lake]] and western [[Hunan]] Province, in China. The cuisine is well known for its hot spicy flavor, fresh aroma and deep color. Common cooking techniques include stewing, frying, pot-roasting, braising, and smoking. Due to the high agricultural output of the region, ingredients for Hunan dishes are many and varied.
***# [[Jiangsu cuisine|Jiangsu]] is derived from the native cooking styles of the [[Jiangsu]] region in China. Food texture is often soft, but not to the point of mushy or falling apart. Other characters includes the strict selection of ingredients according to the seasons, emphasis on the matching color and shape of each dish and emphasis on using soup to improve the flavor.
***# [[Shandong cuisine|Shandong]] in Chinese is more commonly known as '''Lu cuisine''', and is derived from the native cooking styles of [[Shandong]], an eastern coastal province of China. Possibly Shandong's greatest contribution to Chinese cuisine has been in the area of brewing vinegars. Hundreds of years of experience combined with unique local methods have led to Shandong's prominence as one of the premier regions for vinegar production in China.
***# [[Sichuan cuisine|Sichuan]] is a style of Chinese cuisine originating in the [[Sichuan|Sichuan Province]] of southwestern China famed for bold flavors, particularly the pungency and spiciness resulting from liberal use of [[garlic]] and [[chili pepper]]s, as well as the unique flavor of the [[Sichuan peppercorn]] (花椒). [[Peanut]]s, [[sesame paste]], and [[ginger]] are also prominent ingredients in Sichuan cooking.&lt;ref name=szechuan&gt;{{cite book|title=World and Its Peoples: Eastern and Southern Asia|author=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|year=2007|page=126|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cKh2KL5LqEsC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=szechuan+cuisine#v=onepage&amp;q=szechuan%20cuisine&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

** Traditional cooking methods eschew the use of oils and fats, with a focus on featuring the delicate flavors of the natural ingredients. Due to an abundant seafood supply, the traditional Japanese diet featured minimal use of meat; however, modern Japanese cuisine includes an extensive variety of popular meat dishes. Japanese cuisine offers a vast array of regional specialties that use traditional recipes and local ingredients.
** [[Japanese wine]]
** [[Okinawan cuisine]] is the cuisine of the Japanese [[Okinawa Island|island of Okinawa]]. Due to the difference in culture, climate, vegetables and other ingredients between Okinawa and mainland Japan, Okinawan cuisine is very different from Japanese cuisine. The cuisine incorporated influence from Chinese cuisine and [[Southeast Asia]]n cuisine due to trade. The [[sweet potato]], introduced in Okinawa in 1605, became a staple food there until the beginning of the 20th century. An article about Okinawan food written by [[Kikkoman]] stated that Goya ([[bitter melon]]) and Nabera ([[luffa]] or towel gourd) were "likely" introduced to Okinawa from Southeast Asia. Since [[Ryukyu Kingdom|Ryūkyū]] had served as a tributary state to China, Okinawan cooks traveled to [[Fujian Province]] to learn how to cook Chinese food; Chinese influence seeped into Okinawa in that manner. The same Kikkoman article states that the method of [[distillation]] of [[awamori]] likely originated from [[Siam]] ([[Thailand]]) and traveled to Okinawa during the 15th century. After the lord of the [[Kagoshima]] Domain subjugated Ryūkyū, Okinawan cooks traveled to Japan to study [[Japanese cuisine]], causing that influence to seep into Okinawan cuisine.&lt;ref name="KikkomanOkinawan"&gt;Ishige, Naomichi.

[[South Asian cuisine]] includes the [[cuisine]]s from the [[Indian subcontinent]] and when included in the definition, also that of [[Afghanistan]]. It has roots in South Asia, including practices taken from the [[Hindu]] beliefs practiced by the large population found in the region, alongside in some regional cuisines, certain influences from neighboring regions and cultures, particularly from Muslim cultures of the Middle East and Central Asia. Dishes in this area of the world are known for their use of hot peppers, black pepper, cloves, and other strong spices along with the flavored butter [[ghee]]. Common meats include lamb, goat and chicken; beef is not as common as in western cuisines because the tenets of the Hindu faith prohibit its consumption. Other staples of many of the cuisines include rice, [[chapati]] made from wheat and barley, and beans.&lt;ref name=le/&gt; The cuisine of South Asia has mostly indigenous roots, as well as practices taken from the Hindu beliefs practiced by the large population found in the region.

* [[Middle Eastern cuisine]], or ''West Asian'' cuisine, is the cuisine of the various countries and peoples of the [[Middle East]] ([[Western Asia]]). Despite their similarities, there are considerable differences in [[climate]] and [[culture]], so the term is not definitive.

'''Low Lusatian German''' (in German: ''Niederlausitzer Mundart'' (also English: ''Low Lusatian Dialect'')) is a variety of [[Central German]] spoken in northern [[Saxony]] and southern [[Brandenburg]] within the regions of [[Lower Lusatia]] ([[Cottbus]]) and the northern part of [[Upper Lusatia]] ([[Hoyerswerda]]). It is well-defined from the [[Low German]] dialects around and north of Berlin as well as the Saxon dialect group of present-day Saxony and the [[Slavic language]] of the [[Sorbs]].

Both regions were strongly influenced by different dialects, especially after [[World War II]]. Refugees from [[East Prussia]] and [[Silesia]] settled there after their dispossession from former German areas. After the foundation of the [[German Democratic Republic]] and an economical development because of a stronger extraction of [[lignite]] people from [[Mecklenburg]], [[Thuringia]], [[Saxony]] and [[Saxony-Anhalt]] moved to the Lusatia region to benefit from the development. Due to this influence of other German dialects Low Lusatian never formed a too strong variation from standard German. For people moving now into this area the dialect is easy to learn and influences their spoken language quite fast.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

==Language==

Low Lusatian German lacks regional specific words. It contains [[Syncope (phonetics)|syncope]]s and [[apocope]]s which are used in nearly every German dialect. The only somewhat different [[Manner of articulation|articulation]] is the [[guttural]] {{angle bracket|r}}, where Standard German's {{angle bracket|er}} {{IPA|[ɐ]}} ending is instead {{angle bracket|a}} {{IPA|[a]}}:

|}

At the beginning of a word the {{angle bracket|r}} is always spoken, but it is nearly inaudible within a word. The same effect can be seen on the letter {{angle bracket|e}} {{IPA|[ɛ]}} which also mostly vanishes in the endings, the changing of {{angle bracket|au}} {{IPA|[aʊ]}} to {{angle bracket|o(h)}}/{{angle bracket|oo}} {{IPA|[oː]}}, and the stretching of {{angle bracket|ei}}/{{angle bracket|ai}} {{IPA|[aɪ]}} to {{angle bracket|ee}} {{IPA|[eː]}}:

The short {{angle bracket|i}} {{IPA|[ɪ]}} is spoken similarly to the standard German {{angle bracket|ü}} ({{IPA|[y]}} or {{IPA|[ʏ]}}):

'''Madiga''' (also known as '''Maadiga''','''Maatangi''', '''Makkalu''', '''Madiga''' and '''Madigaru''') are a [[Dalit]] artisan group. They are classified as a [[Scheduled Caste]] and are found in the southern Indian state of [[Andhra Pradesh]],[[Telangana]],[[Karnataka]],[[Kerala]] and also found in Northern states of [[Maharashtra]],[[Chhattisgarh]],[[Odisha]],[[Madhyapradesh]] .&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/lf/2004/09/10/stories/2004091002370200.htm|title=Starring Madiga and dappu...|last=Madhav|first=K.V.S.|date=2004-09-09|newspaper=The Hindu|pages=02|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 Their socio-economic standing today has been improved through the impact of their classification as a Scheduled Caste. The Dalit activist [[Lelle Suresh]] made a critically acclaimed [[documentary film]] about the community, titled ''[[Mahadiga (film)|Mahadiga]]'', in 2004.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Maragang''' or '''Kimaragang''' people are an [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[ethnic group]] residing in [[Sabah]], eastern [[Malaysia]] on the island of [[Borneo]]. They reside in the [[Kota Marudu]] and [[Pitas, Malaysia|Pitas]] districts of [[Kudat Division]]. Their population was estimated at 10,000 in the year 1987. They are considered a sub-group of the [[Kadazan-Dusun]], as their language ([[ISO 639-3]] kqr) belongs to the Dusunic branch of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language family. They are primarily farmers, raising paddy [[rice]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], and cash crops.

The '''Nakh languages''' are a group  of languages within [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian]], spoken chiefly by the [[Chechens]] and [[Ingush people|Ingush]] in the [[North Caucasus]] within [[Southern Russia]].

[[Bats language|Bats]] is the endangered language of the [[Bats people]], an ethnic minority in Georgia.
The Chechen, Ingush and Bats peoples are also grouped under the ethno-linguistic umbrella of [[Nakh peoples]].

==Classification==
The Nakh languages were historically classified as an independent '''North-Central Caucasian''' family, but are now recognized as a branch of the [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian]] family. 

The separation of Nakh from common Northeast Caucasian has been tentatively dated to the [[Neolithic]] (ca. 4th millennium BC).&lt;ref&gt;Johanna Nichols, "Cechen" and "Ingush" in R. Smeets (ed.), ''The Indigenous Languages of the Caucasus'' (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nakh language family consists of:
* [[Vainakh languages]], a [[dialect continuum]] with two literary languages:
** [[Chechen language|Chechen]] – approximately 1,330,000 speakers (2002).&lt;ref name="EthChe"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=che Ethnologue report for Chechen]&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Ingush language|Ingush]] – approximately 413,000 speakers (2002).&lt;ref name="EthInh"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=inh Ethnologue report for Ingush]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bats language|Bats]] or Batsbi – approximately 3,420 (2000),&lt;ref name="EthBbl"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=bbl Ethnologue report for Bats]&lt;/ref&gt; spoken mostly in [[Zemo-Alvani]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Not mutually intelligible with Chechen or Ingush.

==The voicing of ejective consonants==
The Nakh languages are relevant to the [[glottalic theory]] of Indo-European, because the Vainakh branch has undergone the voicing of ejectives that has been postulated but widely derided as improbable in that family. In initial position, Bats ejectives correspond to Vainakh ejectives, but in non-initial position to Vainakh voiced consonants. (The exception is {{IPA|*qʼ}}, which remains an ejective in Vainakh.)

A similar change has taken place in some of the other Dagestanian languages.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Fallon, 2002. ''The synchronic and diachronic phonology of ejectives'', p 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extinct Nakh languages==
Many obscure ancient languages or peoples have been postulated by scholars of the Caucasus as Nakh, many in the South Caucasus. None of these have been confirmed; most are classified as Nakh on the basis of placenames.

===Èrsh===
The [[Èrsh language]], language of the Èrs who inhabited Northern Armenia, and then, (possibly) later, mainly [[Hereti]] in Southeast Georgia and Northwest [[Azerbaijan]]. This is considered to be more or less confirmed as Nakh.&lt;ref name=Jaimoukha&gt;Jaimoukha, Amjad. ''The Chechens: A Handbook''. Routledge Curzon: Oxon, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; They were assimilated eventually, and their language was replaced by Georgian or Azeri.

===Malkh===
The language of the [[Malkh]]s&lt;ref name=Jaimoukha/&gt; (whose name, malkh, refers to the sun) in the North Caucasus, who lived in modern day [[Kabardino-Balkaria]], [[Karachay–Cherkessia]], and once briefly conquered [[Ubykhia]] and [[Abkhazia]]. They were conquered first by Scythian-speaking Alan tribes and then by Turkic tribes, and seem to have largely abandoned their homeland and found shelter among the [[Chechens]], leading to the formation of a [[teip]] named after them. Those who stayed behind were either wiped out or assimilated.

===Kakh===
The language of the Kakh, old inhabitants of [[Kakheti]] and [[Tusheti]] in Eastern Georgia.&lt;ref name=Jaimoukha/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vakhushti, an 18th century Georgian historian cited by Jaimoukha, apparently stated that "the Kakh considered Gligvs, Dzurdzuks and Kists as their ethnic kin." Dzurdzuk is the Georgian name for Chechens, Kists is used to refer to the Ingush here.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kakh apparently called themselves Kabatsas and their territory Kakh-Batsa.&lt;ref&gt;Jaimoukha. ''Chechens''. Page 29&lt;/ref&gt; They may or may not be ancestral to the modern Bats, and they may or may not be closely related to them. They were assimilated (completely or almost completely, depending on if one believes the theory that the Bats are descended from them) by the Kartlians to speak Georgian.

===Gligvic===
Gligvs, a mysterious people in the North Caucasus attributed by Georgian historians to be a Nakh people. They may be ancestral to the Ingush, but the term used by Georgians consistently for the Ingush is "Kist", causing large amounts of confusion (as the Nakh people in Georgia who speak Chechen are also called "Kists").

===Tsanar===
The language of the [[Tsanars]] in historical Georgia is thought by many historians to be Nakh, based on [[toponymy|place names]], geographic location, and other such information.&lt;ref name=Jaimoukha/&gt;

===Dval===
The language of the [[Dvals]] is thought to be Nakh by many historians,&lt;ref name=Jaimoukha/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Гамрекели В. Н. Двалы и Двалетия в I—XV вв. н. э. Тбилиси, 1961 page 138&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Меликишвили Г. А. К изучению древней восточномалоазийской этнонимики. ВДИ, 1962,1 page 62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gamrekeli&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Melikishvilli"&gt;Melikishvilli&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuznetsov&gt;{{Citation| last=Kuznetsov| first=V.| authorlink=Vladimir_Alexandrovitch_Kouznetsov| title=Essays on the history of Alans (in Russian)| publisher=IR| place=Vladikavkaz| year=1992|isbn=978-5-7534-0316-2  |url = http://iratta.com/2007/06/05/09_alanyovsy_i_gruzija_pervaja_chast.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; though there is a rivaling camp arguing for its status as a close relative of [[Ossetic language|Ossetic]].&lt;ref name=Kuznetsov/&gt; Various backing for the Nakh theory (different scholars use different arguments) includes the presence of Nakh placenames in former Dval territory,&lt;ref name=Kuznetsov/&gt; evidence of Nakh–Svan contact which probably would've required the Nakh nature of the Dvals or people there before them,&lt;ref name=Jaimoukha/&gt; and the presence of a foreign-origin Dval clan among the Chechens,&lt;ref name="Melikishvilli"/&gt; seemingly implying that the Dvals found shelter (like the Malkhs are known to have done) among the Chechens from the conquest of their land by foreign invaders (presumably Ossetes). The Dvals were assimilated by the Georgians (and possibly the Ossetes as well) and conquered by the Ossetes in the north. It is thought that Dval did not go fully extinct until the 18th century, making the Dvals the most recent Nakh people known to have died out (if they were Nakh).

===Tsov===
According to Georgian scholars I.A. Javashvili and [[Giorgi Melikishvili]], the [[Urartu|Urartian]] state of [[Sophene|Supani]] was occupied by the ancient Nakh tribe Tsov, whose state is called Tsobena in ancient Georgian historiography.&lt;ref&gt;Джавахишвили И. А. Введение в историю грузинского народа. кн.1, Тбилиси, 1950, page.47-49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ахмадов |first=Шарпудин Бачуевич |title=Чечня и Ингушетия в XVIII - начале XIX века |year= 2002|publisher= "Джангар", АПП|location=[[Elista]] |isbn= &lt;!-- 5-94587-072-3 note: this ISBN is invalid - probably a publisher error, or OCR error--&gt;|page= 52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Гаджиева В. Г. Сочинение И. Гербера Описание стран и народов между Астраханью и рекою Курой находящихся, М, 1979, page.55.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tsov language was the dominant language spoken by its people, and was thought by these Georgian historians (as well as a number of others) to be Nakh. Tsov and its relatives in the area may have contributed to the [[Hurro-Urartian languages|Hurro-Urartian]] substratum in the [[Armenian language]].

'''Ozark Medieval Fortress''' is a project designed to construct an accurate replica of a 13th-century [[Château|French castle]] in [[Lead Hill, Arkansas|Lead Hill]], [[Arkansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bransonshows.com/activity/OzarkMedievalFortress.cfm|title=Ozark Medieval Fortress|website=Bransonshows.com|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction is carried out on the site using only materials and techniques appropriate to the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scatoday.net/node/14323|title=Building It Medieval-The Ozark Medieval Fortress in Arkansas|website=Scatoday.net|accessdate=2 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802204347/http://www.scatoday.net/node/14323#|archive-date=2017-08-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ground was broken in 2009, with the expectation that completion will take about 20 years.

The project was inspired by [[Guédelon Castle]] in France, which is the first attempt to build a medieval castle using accurate construction methods, started by [[Michel Guyot]]. Two French citizens living in Arkansas offered to sell Guyot part of their land for the building of a similar fortification. Guyot accepted, and construction began in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/dailyrft/2010/03/medieval_castle_under_construction_in_ozarks.php |title=Medieval Castle Under Construction in Ozarks|author=Aimee Levitt|date=March 18, 2010|accessdate=2010-07-12 |deadurl=yes |work=Riverfront Times|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810065410/http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/dailyrft/2010/03/medieval_castle_under_construction_in_ozarks.php |archivedate=2010-08-10 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, Ozark Medieval Fortress opened to the public. Visitors had the opportunity to observe the ongoing construction and talk to the costumed workers. Additionally, starting in 2011 a collection of medieval siege weapons was to be on display. The site was open every day from 10AM to 6PM.

In January 2012 the project closed indefinitely, requiring a buyer or an investor.&lt;ref name="ozark_closes"&gt;[http://www.baxterbulletin.com/article/20120124/NEWS01/201240337/Ozark-Medieval-Fortress-closes-now]{{Dead link|date=October 2016|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/28/us/buyer-sought-for-stalled-medieval-castle-in-arkansas.html|title=Buyer Sought for Stalled Tourist Castle Near Branson|first=Bret|last=Schulte|date=27 May 2013|website=Nytimes.com|accessdate=2 August 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization's acronym in Turkish "TIB" had become synonymous for internet censorship by the time of closure due to its appearance on tens of thousands of [[Censorship in turkey|internet block pages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://d8news.com/turkey-shuts-tib-internet-surveillance-censorship-bureau-1327|title=Turkey shuts down TIB internet surveillance and censorship bureau - D8 News|last=|first=|date=2016-08-15|work=|newspaper=[[D8 News]]|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-22|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was part of the [[Information and Communication Technologies Authority]], which is now directly responsible for duties previously tasked to the directorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tib.gov.tr/en/|title=Official site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its 2014 blocking of [[Twitter]] was ruled to be [[Constitution of Turkey|unconstituational]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/02/us-turkey-twitter-ban-idUSBREA311BF20140402 Turkey's Twitter ban violates free speech: constitutional court]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9485">'''Privacy engineering''' is an emerging discipline within, at least, the [[software]] or information systems domain which aims to provide methodologies, tools, and techniques such that the engineered systems provide acceptable levels of [[privacy]]. In the US acceptable level of privacy is defined in terms of compliance to the functional and non-functional requirements set out through a [[privacy policy]], while in the EU, the [[General Data Protection Regulation]] sets the requirements that need to be fulfilled. In the rest of the world, the requirements change depending on local implementations of [[privacy law|privacy]] and [[data protection]] laws.

== Definition and scope ==

The definition of privacy engineering given by [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)]] is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy Engineering at NIST|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/projects/privacy_engineering/index.html|publisher=NIST|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation | ''Focuses on providing guidance that can be used to decrease privacy risks, and enable organizations to make purposeful decisions about resource allocation and effective implementation of controls in information systems.''|sign=|source=}}

While privacy has been developing as a legal domain, privacy engineering has only really come to the fore in recent years as the necessity of implementing said privacy laws in information systems has become a definite requirement to the deployment of such information systems. For example, IPEN&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Internet Privacy Engineering Network|title=Background and purpose|url=https://secure.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/edps/EDPS/IPEN|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlines their position in this respect as:

{{quotation | One reason for the lack of attention to privacy issues in development is the lack of appropriate tools and best practices. Developers have to deliver quickly in order to minimize time to market and effort, and often will re-use existing components, despite their privacy flaws. There are, unfortunately, few building blocks for privacy friendly applications and services, and security can often be weak as well.}}

Privacy engineering&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oliver|first1=Ian|title=Privacy Engineering: A Dataflow and Ontological Approach|date=July 2014|publisher=CreateSpace|isbn=978-1497569713|edition=1st|url=http://www.privacyengineeringbook.net|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; involves aspects such as process management, [[security]], [[ontology]] and [[software engineering]]. The actual application&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gürses|first1=Seda|last2=Troncoso|first2=Carmela|last3=Diaz|first3=Claudia|title=Engineering Privacy by Design|date=2011|publisher=International Conference on Privacy and Data Protection (CPDP) Book|url=https://www.cosic.esat.kuleuven.be/publications/article-1542.pdf|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of these derives from necessary legal compliances, privacy policies and `manifestos' such as [[Privacy by Design|Privacy-by-Design]].

[[File:Pbdmanifestoengineering.png|thumb|Relationship between PbD and Privacy Engineering]]

Towards the more implementation levels, privacy engineering employs [[Privacy-enhancing technologies|privacy enhancing technologies]] to enable [[anonymisation]] and [[de-identification]] of data. Privacy engineering requires suitable security engineering practices to be deployed, and some privacy aspects can be implemented using security techniques. A privacy impact assessment is another tool within this context and its use does not imply that privacy engineering is being practiced.

One area of concern is the proper definition and application of terms such as personal data, personally identifiable information, anonymisation and [[pseudo-anonymisation]] which lack sufficient and detailed enough meanings when applied to software, information systems and data sets.

Another facet of information system privacy has been the ethical use of such systems with particular concern on [[surveillance]], [[big data]] collection, [[artificial intelligence]] etc. Some members of the privacy and privacy engineering communication advocate the idea of [[Ethics engineering]] or reject the possibility of engineering privacy into systems intended for surveillance.

== Core practices ==
As this particular field is still in its infancy and somewhat dominated by the legal aspects, the following list just outlines the primary areas on which privacy engineering is based:

* [[Data flow diagram|Data flow modelling]]
* [[Semantics]]
* [[Requirements engineering]]
* [[Risk assessment]]
* Privacy management and processes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dennedy, Fox, Finneran|title=The Privacy Engineer's Manifesto|publisher=APress|isbn=978-1-4302-6355-5|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MITRE Corp|title=Privacy Engineering Framework|url=http://www.mitre.org/publications/technical-papers/privacy-engineering-framework|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Development of suitable terminologies/ontologies for expressing types, usages, purposes etc. of information
* Privacy impact assessment

Despite the lack of a cohesive development of the above areas, courses already exist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSIT-Privacy Engineering|url=http://privacy.cs.cmu.edu|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oliver|first1=Ian|title=Introduction to Privacy and Privacy Engineering|url=http://www.slideshare.net/ianoliver79/introduction-to-privacy-and-privacy-engineering|publisher=EIT Summer School, University of Brighton|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the training of privacy engineering. The International Workshop on Privacy Engineering&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Workshop on Privacy Engineering|url=http://ieee-security.org/TC/SPW2017/IWPE/|publisher=IEEE Security}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-located with [[IEEE Symposium on Computer Arithmetic|IEEE Symposium]] on Security and Privacy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy|url=http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2017/index.html|publisher=IEEE Security}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a venue to address "the gap between research and practice in systematizing and evaluating approaches to capture and address privacy issues while engineering information systems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gurses, Del Alamo|title=Privacy Engineering: Shaping an Emerging Field of Research and Practice|publisher= IEEE Security and Privacy|date=Mar 2016|volume=14|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aspects of information ==
As an area privacy engineering is particular concerned with the processing of information over the following aspects or [[Upper ontology|ontologies]] and their relations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|title=Semantic Conceptions of Information|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/information-semantic/|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to their implementation in software:

* Information Type Ontologies (as opposed to PII or machine types)
* Data Processing Ontologies
* [[Semantic data model|Semantics of information]] and data sets (see also noise and [[Data anonymization|anonymisation]])
* Provenance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paul Groth, Luc Moreau|title=An Overview of the PROV Family of Documents|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/|publisher=W3C|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of information, including the notion of data subject
* Usage of information
* Purpose of information, viz: primary vs [[Secondary data|secondary]] collection
* Notions of controller and processor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Article 29 Data Protection Working Party|title=Opinion 1/2010 on the concepts of "controller" and "processor"|date=16 February 2010|volume=00264/10/EN WP 169}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The notions of authority and identity (ostensibly of the source(s) of data)

Further to this how the above then affect the security classification, risk classification and thus the levels of protection and flow within a system can then the metricised or calculated.

== Definitions of privacy ==

As already stated, privacy is an area dominated by legal aspects but requiring implementation using, ostensibly, engineering techniques, disciplines and skills. Privacy Engineering as an overall discipline takes its basis from considering privacy not just as a legal aspect or engineering aspect and their unification but also utilising the following areas:

* Privacy as a philosophical aspect
* Privacy as an economic aspect, particular game theory
* Privacy as a sociological aspect

==Legal basis==
The impetus for technological progress in privacy engineering stems from general [[privacy law]]s and various particular legal acts:
*[[Privacy Act of 1974]]
*[[Privacy Protection Act of 1980]]
*[[Video Privacy Protection Act]]
*[[Online Privacy Protection Act]]
*[[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act]]
*[[Driver's Privacy Protection Act]]
*[[Intimate Privacy Protection Act]]
*[[Telephone Records and Privacy Protection Act of 2006]]
*[[General Data Protection Regulation]]

'''Rehabilitation''' is the re-integration into society of a [[Conviction|convicted person]] and the main objective of modern [[penology|penal policy]], to counter [[Habitual offender|habitual offending]], also known as criminal [[recidivism]].&lt;ref name="84-10E"&gt;[https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=693339&amp;BackColorInternet=9999CC&amp;BackColorIntranet=FFBB55&amp;BackColorLogged=FFAC75 Rec(84)10E 21 June 1984 on the criminal record and rehabilitation of convicted persons].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ovey&gt;Clare Ovey, ''[https://www.coe.int/t/DGHL/STANDARDSETTING/PRISONS/Conference_19_files/COURT-%20Clare%20Ovey%20Helsinki.pdf Ensuring respect of the rights of prisoners under the European Convention on Human Rights as part of their reintegration process]'', Registry of the European Court of Human Rights.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatives to imprisonment also exist, such as [[community service]], [[probation]] orders, and others entailing guidance and aftercare towards the defender

== Methods ==

A successful rehabilitation of a prisoner is also helped if convicted persons:
* are not placed in health-threateningly bad conditions, enjoy access to [[medical care]] and are protected from other forms of serious ill-treatment,&lt;ref name=ovey/&gt;
* are able to maintain ties to the outside world,&lt;ref name=ovey/&gt;
* learn new skills to assist them with working life on the outside,&lt;ref name=ovey/&gt;
* enjoy clear and detailed statutory regulations clarifying the safeguards applicable and governing the use and disposal of any [[Criminal record|record of data relating to criminal matters]].&lt;ref name=ovey/&gt;&lt;ref name=84-10E/&gt;

=== Applications ===

====Norway====
Norway’s prison system is based on the principle of normalization, in which inmates have access to amenities they would have outside of prison, such as an exclusive mini fridge, flat-screen TV, private bathroom, and access to outdoor environment.&lt;ref name="Salve"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Deady|first1=Carolyn|title=Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy|url=http://www.salve.edu/sites/default/files/filesfield/documents/Incarceration_and_Recidivism.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Milanovic|first1=Nikola|title=Norway’s New Prisons: Could They Work Here? « The Stanford Progressive|url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/progressive/cgi-bin/?p=653|website=web.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, along with a shared kitchen and living area “to create a sense of family” among inmates and the absence of traditional prison uniforms contributes to Norway’s rehabilitative normalcy system.&lt;ref name="Salve" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt; The prison’s structure is composed of Units A, B and C with Unit A housing those in need of psychiatric or medical attention, thus being the most prohibitive of the three.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benko|first1=Jessica|title=The Radical Humaneness of Norway’s Halden Prison|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/magazine/the-radical-humaneness-of-norways-halden-prison.html?_r=2|website=The New York Times|date=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halden Fengsel, referred to as the “world’s most humane maximum-security prison” embodies the country’s goal of reintegration by aiding inmates in sorting out housing and employment before leaving the prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benko|first1=Jessica|title=The Radical Humaneness of Norway’s Halden Prison|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/magazine/the-radical-humaneness-of-norways-halden-prison.html?_r=2|website=The New York Times|date=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rehabilitative measures involve education, job training, workshops to acquire a trade, and therapy along with the humane treatment they receive from personnel who have to complete 3 years of training to become prison guards.&lt;ref name="Salve" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TG"&gt;{{cite web|last1=James|first1=Erwin|title=The Norwegian prison where inmates are treated like people|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/feb/25/norwegian-prison-inmates-treated-like-people|website=The Guardian|date=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of Norway’s methods is evident as they hold the lowest recidivism rate worldwide at less than 30%.&lt;ref name="Salve" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=James|first1=Erwin|title=The Norwegian prison where inmates are treated like people|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/feb/25/norwegian-prison-inmates-treated-like-people|website=The Guardian|date=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Better out than in” is Norway’s Correctional Service unofficial motto that is in view with their rehabilitative system as a justice to society by integrating inmates as functioning members of society upon release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benko|first1=Jessica|title=The Radical Humaneness of Norway’s Halden Prison|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/magazine/the-radical-humaneness-of-norways-halden-prison.html?_r=2|website=The New York Times|date=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=James|first1=Erwin|title=The Norwegian prison where inmates are treated like people|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/feb/25/norwegian-prison-inmates-treated-like-people|website=The Guardian|date=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislation ==
=== Europe ===
As established by the [[Council of Europe]] committee of ministers, "a crime policy aimed at [[crime prevention]] and the [[social reintegration]] of offenders should be pursued and developed".&lt;ref name=84-10E/&gt;

"The [[European Court of Human Rights]], also, has stated in various judgments that, while punishment remains one of the aims of imprisonment, the emphasis in European penal policy is now on the rehabilitative aim of imprisonment, particularly towards the end of a long prison sentence.... A prospect of release is necessary, because human dignity requires that there must be a chance for a prisoner to atone for his offence and move towards rehabilitation. A review system is also needed because, over the course of a very long sentence, the balance between the grounds of detention (punishment, deterrence, public protection and rehabilitation) can shift to the point that detention can no longer be justified."&lt;ref name=ovey/&gt;

==== Germany ====
Per the [[s:Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]], «Everyone has the right to life and to inviolability of his person. The freedom of the individual is inviolable. These rights may only be encroached upon pursuant to a law».

==== Italy ====
Per the [[s:Constitution of Italy|Italian constitution]], «Punishment cannot consist in treatment contrary to [[human dignity]] and must aim at rehabilitating the condemned».

====United Kingdom====
The [[Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974]] of the UK Parliament enables some criminal convictions to be ignored after a rehabilitation period.

=== United States of America ===
The [[United States Code]] states that sentencing judges shall make imprisonment decisions "recognizing that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation".&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|18|3582|a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 a number of reformers, including [[Koch family foundations]], the [[ACLU]], the [[Center for American Progress]], [[Families Against Mandatory Minimums]], the [[Coalition for Public Safety]], and the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation|MacArthur Foundation]], announced a bipartisan resolution to reform the criminal justice system in the United States. Their efforts were lauded by [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] who noted these reforms will improve rehabilitation and workforce opportunities for those who have served their sentences.&lt;ref name=dbeast&gt;{{cite web| last =Mak| first =Tim| title =Koch Bros to Bankroll Prison Reform| work =The Daily Beast| date =Jan 13, 2015| url =http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/13/koch-bros-to-bankroll-prison-reform.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rtody&gt;{{cite web| title =Koch brothers join Obama in advocating US prison reform| work =Russian Today| date =Jul 17, 2015| url =https://www.rt.com/usa/310128-koch-brothers-obama-prisons/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dbeast/&gt;&lt;ref name=wapos&gt;{{cite web| last =Horwitz| first =Sari| title =Unlikely Allies| work =Washington Post| date =Aug 15, 2015| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2015/08/15/clemency-the-issue-that-obama-and-the-koch-brothers-actually-agree-on/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2015/1020/Congress-s-big-bipartisan-success-that-might-be-just-beginning | title=Congress's big, bipartisan success that might be just beginning | work=Christian Science Monitor | date=Oct 20, 2015 | author=Gass Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Nelson| first =Colleen Mccain; Fields, Gary| title =Obama, Koch Brothers in Unlikely Alliance to Overhaul Criminal Justice| work =Wall Street Journal| date =Jul 16, 2015| url =https://www.wsj.com/articles/obama-koch-brothers-in-unlikely-alliance-to-overhaul-criminal-justice-1437090737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the last few decades, the United States prison population has increased significantly. While prisons are considered punishment, they also are intended to have the purpose of future crime prevention. A recent study found that of $74 billion total spent on incarceration among federal, state and local prisons, less than 1% of that was spent on prevention and treatment. Incarceration not only harms the individual as intended, but also has unintended negative effects on the inmate’s family, community, and overall society. Inmate education has been shown to reduce recidivism. Evidence shows that inmates overwhelmingly take advantage of education programs if they are available to them and if they can afford them. A recent study showed the earning a GED while incarcerate reduced recidivism rates by 14% for those under 21, and 5% for those over 21. Substance abuse is also a major issue in the prison system. Between 1996 and 2006, despite a modest population increase of 12%, the number of incarcerated individuals rose by 33% and the number of substance-abusing individuals rose by 43%. Existing treatment programs have shown solid evidence that drug treatment programs, along with support after release, are effective at reducing recidivism. Emotional and mental health counseling is a core component of successful inmate rehabilitation. Without the proper innate motivation and desire from the inmate, attempts to educate or assist with substance abuse are less effective. A study revealed that more than half of those incarcerated had a mental health problem, defined as a recent history or symptoms of a mental health problem within the previous 12 months.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

== Psychopathy and recidivism ==

Criminal [[recidivism]] is highly correlated with [[psychopathy]].&lt;ref name="Jill S. Levenson 2000 p. 7"&gt;Jill S. Levenson, John W. Morin (2000) [''Treating Nonoffending Parents in Child Sexual Abuse Cases''] p. 7  SAGE, {{ISBN|0-7619-2192-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Psychobiology of personality"&gt;Marvin Zuckerman (1991) [https://books.google.com/books?id=TA01Duy4RLwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA390 ''Psychobiology of personality''] Cambridge University Press, p. 390. {{ISBN|0-521-35942-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lifestyle theory"&gt;Glenn D. Walters (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=wNcshqJlms0C&amp;pg=PA42 ''Lifestyle theory''] p. 42 Nova Publishers, {{ISBN|1-60021-033-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychopath is defined by an uninhibited [[gratification]] in criminal, sexual, or aggressive [[instinct|impulses]] and the ''inability to learn from past mistakes''.&lt;ref name="Jill S. Levenson 2000 p. 7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Psychobiology of personality"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lifestyle theory"/&gt; Individuals with this disorder gain satisfaction through their antisocial behavior and lack remorse for their actions.&lt;ref name=hare2&gt;Hare, Robert D, Psychopaths: New Trends in Research. The Harvard Mental Health Letter, September 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Findings indicate [[psychopathic]] prisoners have a 2.5 time higher probability of being released from jail than undiagnosed ones, even though they are more likely to [[recidivism|recidivate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7833672.stm Psychopaths' 'early release con'](9 February 2009)BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that punishment and behavior modification techniques do not improve the behavior of a psychopath. Psychopathic individuals have been regularly observed to become more cunning and better able to hide their behaviour. It has been suggested by them that traditional [[therapy|therapeutic]] approaches actually make psychopaths if not worse, then far more adept at manipulating others and concealing their behavior. They are generally considered to be not only incurable but also untreatable.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Harris|first1=Grant|last2=Rice|first2=Marnie|contribution=Treatment of psychopathy: A review of empirical findings|editor-last=Patrick|editor-first=Christopher|title=Handbook of Psychopathy|year=2006|pages=555–572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychopaths also have a markedly distorted sense of the potential consequences of their actions, not only for others, but also for themselves. They do not, for example, deeply recognize the risk of being caught, disbelieved or injured as a result of their behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/189/3/280 Attention to the eyes and fear-recognition deficits in child psychopathy - Dadds et al. 189 (3): 280 - The British Journal of Psychiatry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Some criticisms of rehabilitative systems are that they can authorize lengthy restrictions of liberty (to allow time for diagnosis and treatment) and broad assumptions of governmental power over offenders' personalities. Moreover, [[due process]] concerns can be implicated by a lack of traditional safeguards of defendants' procedural rights in rehabilitative processes. Some rehabilitative program, such as [[drug court]]s, have also been criticized for [[net-widening effect|widening the net]] of penal control by sentencing more defendants to prison for violations of treatment regimes than would have gone to prison in the absence of those programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1893&amp;context=journal_articles|title=The changing purposes of criminal punishment: A retrospective on the past century and some thoughts about the next|author=Alschuler, Albert|journal=The University of Chicago Law Review|date=Winter 2003|volume=70|number=1|pages=1-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9353">'''Rural Internet''' is the access to the [[Internet]] from [[rural]] areas (also referred to as "the country" or "countryside"), which are settled places outside towns and cities.  Inhabitants live in [[village]]s, [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]]s, on [[farm]]s and in other isolated houses.  [[Mountain]]s and other [[terrain]] can impede rural Internet access.

Most rural access to Internet is [[voiceband]] by [[56k modem]],{{Dubious|date=September 2018}}{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} but poor phone lines in many rural areas, many of which installed or last upgraded between the 1930s and the 1960s, may limit actual download speeds to 23-26k or less. Since many of these lines serve relatively few customers, phone company maintenance and speed of repair of these lines has actually degraded and their upgrade for modern quality requirements is unlikely. This results in a [[digital divide]].

In many rural areas high-speed, reliable internet has been delivered by providers over radio-frequencies via special radio-equipped antennas. These providers have been bridging the digital divide for years, using private, non-governmental infrastructure, making it not necessary for government to become involved in distributing the internet to rural areas.

Methods for [[broadband Internet access]] in rural areas include:
* [[Mobile Internet]] (broadband if [[High Speed Packet Access|HSPA]] or higher)
* [[Power-line Internet]]
* [[Wireless ISP|Terrestrial Wireless Internet]]
* [[Satellite Internet]]
* [[ADSL loop extender]]
* [[Internet of Things]]
* [[White Space Internet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/07/microsoft-will-help-isps-bring-wireless-internet-to-12-us-states/|title=Microsoft wants all of rural America to get high-speed broadband|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2017-07-15|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the United States ==

The [[United States Department of Agriculture]]’s [[Economic Research Service]] has provided numerous studies and data on the Internet in [[rural America]]. One such article from the Agricultural Outlook magazine, ''Communications &amp; the Internet in Rural America'', summarizes internet uses in rural areas of the United States in 2002.  It indicates, "Internet use by rural and urban households has also increased significantly during the 1990s, so significantly that it has one of the fastest rates of adoption for any household service."&lt;ref name="cira"&gt;[http://webarchives.cdlib.org/sw1bc3ts3z/http://ers.usda.gov/publications/agoutlook/JuneJuly2002/ao292h.pdf] "Communications &amp; the Internet in Rural America." (June–July 2002). ''Agricultural Outlook ''. pp. 23-26. Retrieved December 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another area for inclusion of the Internet is [[Agriculture in the United States|American farming]]. One study reviewed data from 2003 and found that "56 percent of farm operators used the Internet while 31 percent of rural workers used it at their place of work."&lt;ref name="iotr"&gt;[http://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2006-february/internet-on-the-range.aspx] "Internet on the Range." (February 2006). ''Amber Waves''. Retrieved December 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  In later years challenges to economical rural [[telecommunications]] remain.  People in [[inner city]] areas are closer together, so the [[access network]] to connect them is shorter and cheaper to build and maintain, while rural areas require more equipment per customer.  However, even with this challenge the demand for services continues to grow.&lt;ref name="iirat"&gt;[http://www.chicagofed.org/community_development/files/07_2006_telecommunications.pdf] Stenberg, Peter L. (July 2006). "Infrastructure in Rural Areas: Telecommunications." ‘’Profitwise News and Views Special Edition’’. pp 33-36. [[Federal Reserve Bank]] of Chicago. Retrieved December 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 the [[Federal Communications Commission]] proposed to use the [[Universal Service Fund]] to subsidize rural [[broadband Internet]] services.

== In Spain ==

In Spain, the [[Guifi.net]] project has been for some people the only alternative to get access to the Internet. Usually, neighbors are the responsible to collect the necessary money to buy the network equipment that will do a Wireless link with another zone that already has internet access. There have also been cases in which the own city council has invested in the infrastructure.

== In the United Kingdom ==
In the UK, the government is aiming to provide superfast broadband (speeds of 24Mbit/s or more) to 95% of the country by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Broadband Delivery UK - Detailed guidance - GOV.UK|url = https://www.gov.uk/guidance/broadband-delivery-uk|website = www.gov.uk|access-date = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, a study by the [[Oxford Internet Institute]] found that in areas less than 20 miles from large cities, internet speed dropped below 2Mbit/s, the speed designated as "adequate" by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Outside the cities and towns, rural Britain's internet is firmly stuck in the 20th century|url = https://theconversation.com/outside-the-cities-and-towns-rural-britains-internet-is-firmly-stuck-in-the-20th-century-33124|website = The Conversation|access-date = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frustrated by the slow progress being made by private telecoms companies, some rural communities have built their own broadband networks, such as the [[Broadband 4 Rural North|B4RN initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Want rural superfast broadband? Do it yourself|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-34256790|website = BBC News|access-date = 2016-01-15|first = Sebastian Moss Business|last = reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet of Things==
Due to poor telecommunication access in most rural areas, low-energy solutions such as those offered by [[Internet of Things]] networks are seen as a [[cost-effective]] solution well-adapted to agricultural environments.&lt;ref name="WT Vox"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Amanda|title=The Internet of Sheep: Farmers in Wales Are Extending The Concept Of IoT|url=https://wtvox.com/2015/02/the-internet-of-sheep-farmers-in-wales-are-extending-the-concept-of-iot/|website=WT Vox|publisher=WT Vox|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FierceWireless&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alleven|first1=Monica|title=Sigfox, Texas Instruments collaborate to deliver Internet of Things solutions|url=http://www.fiercewireless.com/tech/story/sigfox-texas-instruments-collaborate-deliver-internet-things-solutions/2015-04-29|website=FierceWireless|publisher=FierceWireless|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Irish Times"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newenham|first1=Pamela|title=New dawn for farm tech: sowing the Internet of Things into agriculture|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/agribusiness-and-food/new-dawn-for-farm-tech-sowing-the-internet-of-things-into-agriculture-1.2222532|website=The Irish Times|publisher=The Irish Times|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tasks such as controlling [[livestock]] conditions and numbers, the state of crops, and [[Pest (organism)|pests]] are progressively being taken over by [[machine-to-machine|m2m]] communications.

'''Salvadoran Canadians '''({{lang-fr|Salvadoriens canadiens}}, {{lang-es|Salvadoreño canadiense}}) are [[Canadians|Canadian citizens]] who have ancestry from [[El Salvador]], a [[Central America]]n country. Per the National Household Survey in 2011, 63,965 Canadians indicated that they were of either full or partial Salvadoran ancestry (0.2% of the country's population).&lt;ref name="NHS2011"&gt;[http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=PR&amp;Code1=01&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=Canada&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=01&amp;A1=All&amp;B1=All&amp;Custom=&amp;TABID=1], National Household Survey (NHS) Profile, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Slavadoran Canadians are primarily found in large urban areas of Ontario and Quebec, namely [[Toronto]], [[Mississauga]], [[Montreal]] and [[Quebec City]].

==History==
Salvadorian immigration to Canada is a fairly recent phenomenon. Until the 1980s, Salvadorian immigration to Canada was small to nonexistent. It wasn't until the [[Salvadoran Civil War|civil war]] did sizable numbers of Salvadorans started to come to the country. Between 1982 and 1987, 11,251 Salvadorans entered Canada under a special program that help displaced Salvadorans as well as Guatemalans suffering from the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garcia|first1=Maria Cristina|title=Canada: A Northern Refuge for Central Americans|url=http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/canada-northern-refuge-central-americans|website=Migration Policy Institute|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lot like their [[Salvadoran Australian|Australian]] counterparts, some of these were political asylum seekers and others were refugees looking for a place to stay. Unlike their [[Salvadoran American|American]] counterparts, Salvadorans seeking refuge in Canada were more likely to have their asylum applications approved than those in the United States; as a result of different Canadian and American policy to the situation in El Salvador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Douglas|title=Salvadorans Find a Haven in Canada|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/04/world/salvadorans-find-a-haven-in-canada.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002, immigrants from El Salvador came to Brandon, Manitoba to work for a food processing company.&lt;ref name='mapleleaf'&gt;{{cite news | title = SALVADORIAN WORKERS CELEBRATE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY AT BRANDON FACILITY | date = December 4, 2003 | url = http://investor.mapleleaf.ca/phoenix.zhtml?c=88490&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=547940&amp;highlight= | accessdate = August 1, 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130801210059/http://investor.mapleleaf.ca/phoenix.zhtml?c=88490&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=547940&amp;highlight= | archivedate = August 1, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='thestar'&gt;{{cite news | title = Part 3: Manitoba welcome host for guest workers in Canada

==Demographics==
The province with the highest concentration of people of Salvadoran ancestry is [[Manitoba]], which is 0.3% Salvadoran Canadian. The province with highest number of people with Salvadoran ancestry is [[Ontario]], with 29,000 Salvadorean Canadians.&lt;ref name="NHS2011"/&gt; The cities in Canada with the highest concentration of Salvadoran Canadians are: [[Brandon, Manitoba]] (2.3%), [[Kitchener, Ontario]] (1.1%), [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] (0.7%), [[London, Ontario]] (0.7%), [[New Westminster, British Columbia]] (0.7%), [[Toronto, Ontario]] (0.4%), [[Edmonton, Alberta]] (0.4%), [[Brampton, Ontario]] (0.4%), [[Burnaby, British Columbia]] (0.4%), [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] (0.3%), [[Ottawa, Ontario]] (0.3%), and [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]] (0.3%).&lt;ref name="NHS2011"/&gt; Salvadoreans are the third largest Hispanic Population in Canada. In Toronto, many Salvadoran people are located around Eglinton Avenue and Keele Street, and along Jane Street.

'''Secondary suite''' (or '''accessory dwelling unit''') is an [[urban planning]] term used mainly in [[North American English]] for a self-contained apartment in an owner occupied single-family home / lot that is either attached to the principal dwelling or in a separate structure on the same property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/envir/smart_growth_toolkit/pages/mod-adu.html|title=Smart Growth / Smart Energy Toolkit - Accessory Dwelling Units (ADU)|website=www.mass.gov|access-date=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[British English]] the term "annexe" is used instead. Reasons for wanting to add a secondary suite to a property may be to receive additional income, provide social and personal support to a family member, or obtain greater security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/envir/smart_growth_toolkit/pages/mod-adu.html|title=Smart Growth / Smart Energy Toolkit - Accessory Dwelling Units (ADU)|website=www.mass.gov|access-date=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

===Relationship to main residence===
A secondary suite is considered "secondary" or "accessory" to the [[primary residence]] on the parcel. It normally has its own entrance, kitchen, bathroom and living area. There are three types of accessory units: Interior, Interior with modification, and Detached. Examples of these accessory units include:

* A suite above a rear detached garage (a "[[garage apartment]]"),
* A suite above the main floor of a single-detached dwelling,
* A suite below the main floor of a single-detached dwelling (a "[[basement suite]]").
* A suite attached to a single-detached dwelling at grade, or
* A suite detached from the principal dwelling (a "garden suite" or "[[Guest house (secondary suite)|guesthouse]]").

===Mother-in-law apartment===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[List of house types]], and redirects [[Granny flat]] and [[Granny annex]] --&gt;

A mother-in-law apartment is a small [[apartment]] accessory to a primary residence. Alternative names include "'''[[Grandmother|granny]] flat'''", "'''granny suite'''","'''in-law suite'''", and "'''accessory apartment'''", the first being used primarily in Australia, [[United Kingdom|Britain]], Ireland and [[New Zealand]], where it is the most familiar of these terms, but also in parts of the [[United States]]. Such apartments are frequently used to accommodate an elderly relative who is incapable of independent living, but is not ready for a [[nursing home]] environment or other similar facility.

The apartment may or may not have a communicating door to the main house, but virtually always has a separate entrance and is usually not part of the original design. Many are located above the [[Garage (house)|garage]] of the main house or as a separate building in the rear lawn.

==Legal considerations==

In many North American municipalities, secondary suites are illegal because they do not conform to the [[zoning]] or [[land use]] district the property is in, they have been developed without the proper [[Construction permit|permits]], or they do not meet the local [[building code]]. However, some localities only prohibit the renting out of secondary suites, and allow occupation by a relative or guest, leading to the use of the term '''"mother-in-law" house''' or '''apartment'''. Local jurisdictions may have rules regarding allowing certain relatives to live there and rules about what, if any, rent may be charged.

==By country==

===Australia===

'''Dual occupancy''' is sometimes used to refer to the development of two dwellings on one allotment of land. They may be either attached ([[semi-detached]]) or detached.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  | author = Planning &amp; Land Management, Territory Planning Branch
  | title = Dual Occupancy Review
  | year = 2002
  | url = http://www.actpla.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/2162/dualreview2002.pdf
  | accessdate = August 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is common in [[Australia]]. A dual occupancy can be either torrens titles or strata titled.

A Dual Occupancy in Victoria,Australia is a means to add value to property through a subdivision of one lot into two. It is that subdivision that makes dual occupancy an attractive proposition for new property investors and developers.

A 'granny flat' in Australia is actually also known as a secondary dwelling on a property, which is totally different to a dual occupancy. It does not require subdivision of the land and its construction require approval from the council or relevant authority. The certifying process between council or a private certifier depends on a few conditions.&lt;ref&gt;http://mastergrannyflats.com.au/can-my-granny-flat-be-approved-from-a-private-certifier-or-council/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Government programs====

====CMHC====
The [[Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation]] provides a financial assistance program to help Canadians create affordable housing for low-income seniors and adults with a disability within a secondary suite. The program is called the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060909161602/http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/prfinas/prfinas_002.cfm Residential Rehabilitation Assistance Program (RRAP) -- Secondary/Garden Suite]. The maximum fully [[forgivable loan]] depends on the location of the property:
* Southern Areas of Canada: $24,000/unit
* Northern areas of Canada: $28,000/unit
* Far northern areas: $36,000/unit
A 25% supplement in assistance is available in remote areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/prfinas/prfinas_002.cfm Residential Rehabilitation Assistance Program (RRAP) -- Secondary/Garden Suite] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909161602/http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/prfinas/prfinas_002.cfm |date=2006-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====British Columbia====
The Housing Policy Branch of British Columbia's Ministry of Community, Aboriginal and Women’s Services published a guide for local governments to implement secondary suite programs called 'Secondary Suites: A Guide For Local Governments'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.housing.gov.bc.ca/pub/secondary_suites.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The current issue is dated September 2005. The intent of the guide is to "help local governments develop and implement secondary suite programs". It also highlights good secondary suite practices as well as providing practical information to "elected officials, planners, community groups, homeowners, developers, and others interested in secondary suites".

===Norway===
In Norway, particularly in the bigger cities, it is quite common to build separate adjoined smaller flats for renting out. The owner of the main flat will rent out the smaller adjoined flats.

=== United States ===
In the United States, secondary suites are technically referred to as [[Accessory Dwelling Unit|accessory dwelling unit]]s or ADUs. An ADU is second complete dwelling unit which is legally built within or on the same lot as an existing single family residence. An ADU provides complete independent living facilities including a kitchen, bathroom and its own entryway. ADUs are typically not allowed to be sold separate from the primary home and the homeowners are usually required to reside in one of the two units.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hausable.com/adus-list/guides/the-adu-glossary&lt;/ref&gt; State laws typically delegate planning and zoning powers to city and county governments which specify the appropriate type, distribution and intensity of land uses in the local jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;http://realestate.findlaw.com/land-use-laws/land-use-and-zoning-basics.html&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the feasibility of building an '''accessory dwelling unit (ADU)''' (also known as a secondary suite, second unit, granny cottage, etc.&lt;ref&gt;https://accessorydwellings.org/2012/06/04/beware-of-the-many-synonyms-for-adus/&lt;/ref&gt;) can vary widely from place to place, depending on state law and each local jurisdiction's willingness to adopt regulations that facilitate ADUs.

Popular in the early 20th century, ADUs fell into disfavor after WWII, when a shift to suburban development occurred with emphasis on the nuclear family.  However, with increases in the price of housing in many cities and suburbs, an increased awareness of the costs of low-density car-oriented development patterns and an increased need to care for the aging baby boom generation, ADUs have been promoted by some as a beneficial option.&lt;ref&gt;https://accessorydwellings.org/&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some critics perceive ADUs to be a threat to the character of single-family residential neighborhoods.

In California, Government Code Sections 65852.150, 65852.2 &amp; 65852.22 pertain to local regulation of ADUs.&lt;ref&gt;http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=GOV&amp;division=1.&amp;title=7.&amp;part=&amp;chapter=4.&amp;article=2.&lt;/ref&gt;  SB 1069 and AB 2299 are California bills approved in 2016 and effective January 1, 2017, that limit local government authority to prohibit ADUs in certain cases (and also reduce cost and bureaucracy hurdles to construction).&lt;ref&gt;SB 1069: http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB1069&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AB 2299: http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB2299&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SFC_ADUs &gt; {{ cite news | url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/New-California-housing-laws-make-granny-units-10688483.php | doi= | title=New California housing laws make granny units easier to build | last=Pender | first=Kathleen | publisher=''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' | date=2016-12-03 | accessdate=2018-07-12 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615083653/https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/New-California-housing-laws-make-granny-units-10688483.php | archive-date=2018-06-15 | dead-url=no }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SJMN_ADUs &gt; {{ cite news | url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/09/27/california-eases-restrictions-on-granny-units/ | doi= | title=California eases restrictions on ‘granny units’ | last=Wong | first=Queenie | publisher=''[[The Mercury News|San Jose Mercury News]]'' | date=2016-09-27 | accessdate=2018-07-12 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019114401/https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/09/27/california-eases-restrictions-on-granny-units/ | archive-date=2016-10-19 | dead-url=no }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Santa Cruz, California has an ADU program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City of Santa Cruz Accessory Dwelling Unit Development Program|url=http://www.cityofsantacruz.com/departments/planning-and-community-development/programs/accessory-dwelling-unit-development-program|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The County of Maui in Hawaii has an ADU program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maui County Zoning Code, Section 19.35|url=http://library.municode.com/index.aspx?clientId=16289&amp;stateId=11&amp;stateName=Hawaii|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Honolulu, Hawaii, has "'''[[Ohana]] Dwelling Units,'''" which although similar to ADUs, limit occupancy to "family" and have other regulatory requirements.&lt;ref name="Land use Ordinance"&gt;{{cite web|last=City and County of Honolulu|title=Revised Ordinances of Honolulu, (ROH) Section 21-8.20|url=http://www1.honolulu.gov/council/ocs/roh/21990.pdf|work=Land use Ordinance|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ohana Dwellings in Hawaii were created as an allowed use in the zoning code in 1981 as a way to encourage the private sector to create more housing units (without government subsidy), preserve green fields (open space) and ease housing affordability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/43559663/1984-Ohana-Housing-Program-Evaluation|title=Ohana Housing Program Evaluation|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Honolulu: Office of Information and Complaint, Sept. 1984.|access-date=|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/237847666/2014-05-09-Illegal-Dwellings-Find-Loopholes|title=Black boxes and gray spaces: how illegal accessory dwellings find regulatory loopholes.|last=Lau|first=Questor|date=May 2014|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ohana Zoning a 5 year review|url=http://lrbhawaii.info/lrbrpts/87/ohana.pdf|publisher=State of Hawaii Legislative Reference Bureau|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Honolulu amended its zoning code to add a new use—ADUs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.honolulu.gov/rep/site/ccld8/Ordinance_15-41_Bill_20_2015_CD1_Relating_to_ADUs.pdf|title=Honolulu Ordinance 15-41 Relating to Accessory Dwelling Units.|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;—as a sort of Ohana Dwelling, but with fewer restrictions. To prevent creating further complexities for existing Ohana Dwellings, some of which have been condominimized and owned separately from the main house, Ohana Dwellings remain an allowed use (with different requirements and benefits than ADUs) in the zoning code. Due to the poor turnout in the number of ADUs, Honolulu added incentives in 2016, waiving permit fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/339046463/Honolulu-ADU-Status-Update#from_embed|title=ADU Status Update|last=|first=|date=2/11/2017|website=scribd.com|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fee waivers were extended in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://khon2.com/2016/07/21/honolulu-mayor-signs-adu-incentive-bill-into-law/|title=Honolulu mayor signs ADU incentive bill into law|last=|first=|date=2016-07-21|work=KHON2 News|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; ADUs are an important component to Honolulu's Affordable Housing Strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.honolulu.gov/rep/site/ohou/Housing_Strategy_Handout_2-16-17.pdf|title=Implementing [Honolulu's] Affordable Housing Strategy|last=|first=|date=|website=Honolulu Office of Housing|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For New South Wales, the two approval paths are available.
1. If the Frontage of the land is 12m or more, a CDC (Private certifier) is possible. If less, then it must go through a DA(Council).
2. If above condition is met, another important requirement is the land size. If your land size is 450sqm or over, we can do a CDC approval. If it is less than 450sqm, we have to lodge the secondary dwelling application through the council.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="59617">The '''social structure of the [[United Kingdom]]''' has historically been highly influenced by the concept of [[social class]], which continues to affect British society today.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2712372/Harriet-Harman-Social-class-is-still-most-important-divide-in-Britain.html Harriet Harman: Social class is still most important divide in Britain.] www.telegraph.co.uk, 9 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Biressi|first=Anita|title=Class and Contemporary British Culture|year=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London|isbn=9780230240568|author2=Heather Nunn }}&lt;/ref&gt;

British society, like its European neighbours and most societies in world history, was traditionally (before the Industrial Revolution) divided hierarchically within a system that involved the [[hereditary]] transmission of occupation, social status and political influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boundless.com/sociology/understanding-global-stratification-and-inequality/stratification-systems/caste/|title=Boundless Sociology - Simple Book Publishing|first=|last=Boundless|date=|website=www.boundless.com|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the advent of [[industrialisation]], this system has been in a constant state of revision, and new factors other than birth (for example, [[education]]) are now a greater part of creating identity in Britain.

Although definitions of social class in the United Kingdom vary and are highly controversial, most are influenced by factors of wealth, occupation and education. Until recently the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] was organised on a class basis, with the [[House of Lords]] representing the hereditary upper-class and the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] representing everybody else. The British monarch is usually viewed as being at the top of the social class structure.

British society has experienced significant change since the [[World War II|Second World War]], including an expansion of [[higher education]] and [[home ownership]], a shift towards a service-dominated economy, [[mass immigration]], a changing role for women and a more individualistic culture, and these changes have had a considerable impact on the social landscape.&lt;ref name=savage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socresonline.org.uk/12/3/6.html|title=Changing Social Class Identities in Post-War Britain: Perspectives from Mass-Observation by Mike Savage|accessdate=19 October 2011|publisher=Sociological Research Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, claims that the UK has become a [[classless society]] have frequently been met with scepticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/terence-blacker/uppers-downers-and-the-myth-of-classless-britain-545648.html|title=US|author=|date=|website=independent.co.uk|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fabians.org.uk/publications/extracts/cash-class|title=Fabian Society on Cash and the Classless society|author=|date=|website=fabians.org.uk|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Columnists/Column/0,5673,416483,00.html|title=Comment: Classless Britain is a myth - Columnists - guardian.co.uk|author=|date=|website=www.theguardian.com|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that social status in the United Kingdom is influenced by, although separate from, social class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chan |first1=Tak Wing|last2=Goldthorpe |first2=John |year=2004 |title=Is There a Status Order in Contemporary British Society? |journal=European Sociological Review|volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=383–401 |doi= 10.1093/esr/jch033|url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sfos0006/papers/esr2004.pdf |accessdate=24 December 2011 |citeseerx=10.1.1.454.5199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
Prior to the eighteenth century, one did not speak of class or classes.  Older terms like estates, rank, and orders were predominant. This change in terminology corresponded to a general decrease in significance ascribed to hereditary characteristics, and increase in the significance of wealth and income as indicators of position in the social hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Class, Social|editor=Kuper, Adam|title=The social science encyclopedia|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2004|isbn=978-0-415-32096-2|page=111|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2oES3pJufP4C&amp;pg=PA111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Penney, Robert|chapter=Class, social|editors=Christensen, Karen &amp; Levinson, David|title=Encyclopedia of community: from the village to the virtual world, Volume 1|publisher=SAGE|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7619-2598-9|page=189|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1geOjQ6R0MC&amp;pg=PA189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "class system" in the United Kingdom is widely studied in academia but no definition of the word ''class'' is universally agreed to. Some scholars may adopt the [[Marxist view of class]] where persons are classified by their relationship to [[means of production]], as owners or as workers, which is the most important factor in that person's social rank.  Alternatively, [[Max Weber]] developed a [[three-component theory of stratification]] under which "a person’s power can be shown in the social order through their status, in the economic order through their class, and in the political order through their party.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, Charles E. (2007).  ''Social Inequality Forms, Causes, and Consequences Sixth Edition''.  Allyn and Bacon Boston, MA.  {{ISBN|0-205-48436-0}}. p 202&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides these academic models, there are myriad popular explanations of class in Britain.  In the work ''Class'', [[Jilly Cooper]] quotes a shopkeeper on the subject of [[bacon]]: "When a woman asks for [[Bacon#Cuts|back]] I call her 'madam'; when she asks for [[Bacon#Cuts|streaky]] I call her 'dear'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/mar/08/how-to-cook-perfect-bacon-sandwiches | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Felicity | last=Cloake | title=How to cook the perfect bacon sandwich | date=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The United Kingdom never experienced the sudden dispossession of the estates of the [[nobility]], which occurred in much of Europe after the [[French Revolution]] or in the early 20th century, and the British nobility, in so far as it existed as a distinct social class, integrated itself with those with new wealth derived from commercial and industrial sources more comfortably than in most of Europe. Opportunities resulting from consistent economic growth and the expanding [[British Empire]] also enabled some from much poorer backgrounds (generally men who had managed to acquire some education) to rise through the class system.

The historian [[David Cannadine]] sees the period around 1880 as a peak after which the position of the old powerful families declined rapidly, from a number of causes, reaching a nadir in the years after World War II, symbolised by the widespread [[Destruction of country houses in 20th-century Britain|destruction of country houses]].  However their wealth, if not their political power, has rebounded strongly since the 1980s, benefiting from greatly increased values of the land and fine art which many owned in quantity.

Meanwhile, the complex British middle-classes had also been enjoying a long period of growth and increasing prosperity, and achieving political power at the national level to a degree unusual in Europe. They avoided the strict stratification of many Continental middle-classes, and formed a large and amorphous group closely connected at their edges with both the gentry and aristocracy and the labouring classes. In particular the great financial centre of the [[City of London]] was open to outsiders to an unusual degree, and continually expanding and creating new employment.

The British working class, on the other hand, was not notable in Europe for prosperity,&lt;ref name=PG1944&gt;{{cite book |last=Engels |first=Frederick |authorlink=Frederick Engels |others=Translated by Florence Kelley Wischnewetzky |title=The Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844 |edition=January 1943 George Allen &amp; Unwin reprint of the March 1892 edition by David Price |publisher=Project Gutenberg |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17306/17306-h/17306-h.htm |accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Early Modern British travellers often remarked on the high standard of living of the farm-workers and artisans of the [[Netherlands]], though the peasantry in other countries such as France were remarked on as poorer than their English equivalents.  Living standards certainly improved greatly over the period, more so in England than other parts of the United Kingdom, but the [[Industrial Revolution]] was marked by extremely harsh working conditions and poor housing until about the middle of the 19th century.

==Formal classifications==

===Early modern===
At the time of the formation of Great Britain in 1707, England and Scotland had similar class-based social structures. Some basic categories covering most of the British population around 1500 to 1700 are as follows.&lt;ref&gt;John Rule, ''Albion's people: English society 1714-1815'' (Routledge, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Cannadine, ''Class in Britain'' (Penguin UK, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Class
! Characteristics
|-
|[[Villein|Cottagers]] and labourers; servants
|Cottagers were a step below husbandmen, in that they had to work for others for wages. Lowest order of the working castes; perhaps [[Vagrancy (people)|vagabonds]], drifters, criminals or other outcasts would be lower. [[Slavery in England]] died out by 1200 CE.  Most young women of middle and lower ranks became servants to neighboring families for a few years before marriage.  Servants in husbandry were unmarried men hired on annual contracts as farm workers.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Kussmaul, ''Servants in husbandry in early modern England'' (1981).&lt;/ref&gt; 
|-
|[[Husbandman]] (or other tradesmen)
|A tradesman or farmer who either rented a home or owned very little land was a husbandman. In feudal times, this person likely would have been a serf, and paid a large portion of his work or produce to the land-holding lord.
|-
|[[Yeoman]]
|The yeoman class generally included small farmers who held a reasonable amount of land and were able to protect themselves from neighbouring lords et cetera. They played a military role as longbowmen before 1500. The village shopkeeper was placed between yeoman and gentry in the modern social hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Youngs, ''Sixteenth-Century England'' (1984), pp 47-65&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|Clergy.
|Clergy were mostly located in rural areas, where they were under the direction of the gentry.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace Notestein, ''English people on the eve of colonization, 1603-1630'' (1954) pp 61-69.&lt;/ref&gt; A bishop had the status of nobility, and sat in the House of Lords, but his son did not inherit the title.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Collinson,  "Episcopacy and reform in England in the later sixteenth century." ''Studies in Church History'' 3 (1966): 91-125.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|[[Gentry]]/[[gentleman]]
|The gentry by definition held enough assets to live on land rents without working, and so could be well educated. If they worked it was in law, as priests, in politics, or in other educated pursuits without manual labour. The term Esquire was used for landowners who were not knighted. They typically possess estates worked by tenants and laborers. It was prestigious to purchase a military or naval commission for a likely son.&lt;ref&gt;Notestein, ''English people on the eve of colonization, 1603-1630'' (1954) pp 45-60.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|Professionals and businessman.
|Urban professionals included lawyers, with the highest status going to the London barristers and the [[Inns of Court]]. Physicians were rising in status as professionalization and education built upon rapidly increasing knowledge bases.  Merchants and businessmen could range in status from middle to high, depending on their wealth and importance. If they wanted high social prestige, they would buy a landed estate or negotiate for a knighthood or a baronetcy.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter, ''The Penguin Social History of Britain: English Society in the Eighteenth Century'' (Penguin UK, 1990) pp 77-83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Notestein, ''English people on the eve of colonization, 1603-1630'' (1954) pp 86-115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary O'Day, ''The professions in Early Modern England, 1450-1800'' (Routledge, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|[[Knight]]
| The role of knighthood was very important in the medieval period, with the role of organizing local military forces on behalf of a senior noble.  However, by 1600 the title was an honorific one, often granted to outstanding combat soldiers in the king's army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur F Kinney et al. eds.|title=Tudor England: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nHasAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA410|year=2000|pages=410–11|isbn=9781136745300}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|[[Baronet]] (hereditary, non peer)
|A baronet held a hereditary style of knighthood, giving the highest rank below a peerage.
|-
| Aristocracy: [[peerage|Peer]] ([[Nobility|Noble]])
| The ranks ranged from baron to duke.  The rules of succession were elaborate—usually the eldest son inherited the title and the wealth.  When the male line expired, so too did the title (but the family kept the land). The peers were generally large land holders, often with a house in London. They sat in the House of Lords and often played a role in court, which was a very expensive undertaking subsidized by payoffs and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Notestein, ''English people on the eve of colonization, 1603-1630'' (1954) pp 36-44.&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland and Scotland had entirely separate aristocracies; their nobles sat in their own parliaments but not in the English House of Lords.&lt;ref&gt;Keith M. Brown, ''Noble Society in Scotland: wealth, family, and culture from the Reformation to the Revolution'' (Edinburgh UP, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Debora Shuger, "Irishmen, Aristocrats, and Other White Barbarians," ''Renaissance Quarterly'' 50#2 (1997): 494-525. doi.org/10.2307/3039188&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great British Class Survey===

On 2 April 2013 analysis of the results of a survey,&lt;ref name="BBC Lab UK Survey"&gt;{{cite web|title=Britain's Real Class System: Great British Class Survey|url=http://ssl.bbc.co.uk/labuk/experiments/class/|publisher=BBC Lab UK|accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was conducted by the [[BBC]] in 2011 and developed in collaboration with academic experts, was published online in the journal ''[[Sociology (journal)|Sociology]]''.&lt;ref name=Sociology4213&gt;{{cite journal|last=Savage|first=Mike|author2=Fiona Devine |author3=Niall Cunningham |author4=Mark Taylor |author5=Yaojun Li |author6=Johs.

Class was defined and measured according to the amount and kind of economic, cultural, and social resources, "capitals", reported. [[Economic capital#Social science|Economic capital]] was defined as [[income]] and [[asset]]s; [[cultural capital]] as amount and type of cultural interests and activities, and [[social capital]] as the quantity and [[social status]] of their [[Friendship|friend]]s, [[family]] and personal and business contacts.&lt;ref name=BBCResults4213 /&gt; This theoretical framework was inspired by that of [[Pierre Bourdieu#Bourdieu's theory of class distinction|Pierre Bourdieu]], who published his [[La Distinction|theory of social distinction]] in 1979.

====Results====
Analysis of the survey revealed seven classes: a wealthy "elite;" a prosperous salaried "middle class" consisting of professionals and managers; a class of technical experts; a class of ‘new affluent’ workers, and at the lower levels of the class structure, in addition to an ageing traditional working class, a ‘precariat’ characterised by very low levels of capital, and a group of emergent service workers. The fracturing of the middle sectors of the social structure into distinguishable factions separated by generational, economic, cultural, and social characteristics was considered notable by the authors of the research.&lt;ref name = "Page 2 New Model" &gt;Page 2 [http://soc.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/03/12/0038038513481128.full.pdf "A New Model of Social Class: Findings from the BBC’s Great British Class Survey Experiment"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pages 11 to 15" &gt;Pages 11 to 15 [http://soc.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/03/12/0038038513481128.full.pdf "A New Model of Social Class: Findings from the BBC’s Great British Class Survey Experiment"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Elite=====
Members of the elite class are the top 6% of British society with very high economic capital (particularly savings), high social capital, and very 'highbrow' cultural capital. Occupations such as [[chief executive officer]]s, [[Information technology|IT and telecommunications directors]], [[marketing]] and [[sales]] directors; functional [[Management|manager]]s and directors, [[solicitors]], [[barrister]]s and [[judge]]s, [[Chief financial officer|financial manager]]s, [[academia#United Kingdom|higher education teachers]],&lt;ref name="Professor salaries break the scale"&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor salaries break the scale|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/209290.article|publisher=Times Higher Education|accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[dentist]]s, doctors and [[advertising]] and [[public relations]] directors were strongly represented.&lt;ref name = "Pages 12 and 13" &gt;Pages 12 and 13 [http://soc.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/03/12/0038038513481128.full.pdf "A New Model of Social Class: Findings from the BBC’s Great British Class Survey Experiment"]&lt;/ref&gt; However, those in the established and 'acceptable' professions, such as academia, law and medicine are more traditional upper middle class identifiers, with IT and sales being the preserve of the economic if not social middle class.

=====Established middle class=====
Members of the established middle class, about 25% of British society, reported high economic capital, high status of mean social contacts, and both high highbrow and high emerging cultural capital. Well-represented occupations included [[electrical engineer]]s, [[occupational therapist]]s, [[midwive]]s, environmental professionals, quality assurance and regulatory professionals, town planning officials, and special needs teaching professionals.&lt;ref name = "Pages 12 to 14" &gt;Pages 12 to 14 [http://soc.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/03/12/0038038513481128.full.pdf "A New Model of Social Class: Findings from the BBC’s Great British Class Survey Experiment"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Technical middle class=====
The technical middle class, about 6% of British society, shows high economic capital, very high status of social contacts, but relatively few contacts reported, and moderate cultural capital. Occupations represented include [[Radiology|medical radiographers]], [[Pilot (aircraft)|aircraft pilot]]s, [[pharmacist]]s, [[scientist|natural and social science professionals]] and [[scientist|physical scientists]], and [[Businessperson|business]], [[researcher|research]], and [[Administrator (business)|administrative]] positions.&lt;ref name = "Pages 12 and 14" &gt;Pages 12 and 14 [http://soc.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/03/12/0038038513481128.full.pdf "A New Model of Social Class: Findings from the BBC’s Great British Class Survey Experiment"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====New affluent workers=====
New affluent workers, about 15% of British society, show moderately good economic capital, relatively poor status of social contacts, though highly varied, and moderate highbrow but good emerging cultural capital. Occupations include [[electrician]]s and electrical fitters; [[postal worker]]s; retail [[cashier#retail|cashier]]s and checkout operatives; [[plumber]]s and heating and ventilation engineers; sales and retail assistants; housing officers; kitchen and catering assistants; quality assurance technicians.&lt;ref name = "Pages 12 and 14" /&gt;

=====Traditional working class=====
The traditional working class, about 14% of British society, shows relatively poor economic capital, but some housing assets, few social contacts, and low highbrow and emerging cultural capital. Typical occupations include electrical and [[electronics technician]]s; [[care work]]ers; [[janitor|cleaners]]; [[truck driver|van drivers]]; [[electrician]]s; [[Care work|residential, day, and domiciliary care]]
&lt;ref name = "Pages 12 and 14" /&gt;

=====Emergent service sector=====
The emergent service sector, about 19% of British society, shows relatively poor economic capital, but reasonable household income, moderate social contacts, high emerging (but low highbrow) cultural capital. Typical occupations include [[bartender|bar staff]], [[chef]]s, [[Unlicensed assistive personnel|nursing auxiliaries and assistants]], assemblers and routine operatives, [[care work]]ers, elementary storage occupations, customer service occupations, and [[musician]]s.&lt;ref name = "Pages 12 and 14" /&gt;

=====Precariat=====
The precariat, about 15% of British society, shows poor economic capital, and the lowest scores on every other criterion. Typical occupations include [[janitor|cleaners]], [[Delivery (commerce)|van drivers]], [[care worker]]s, [[carpenter]]s and [[joiner]]s, [[Property caretaker|caretaker]]s, leisure and travel service occupations, [[shopkeeper]]s and proprietors, and [[cashier#retail|retail cashiers]].&lt;ref name = "Pages 12, 14, and 15" &gt;Pages 12, 14, and 15 [http://soc.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/03/12/0038038513481128.full.pdf "A New Model of Social Class: Findings from the BBC’s Great British Class Survey Experiment"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Informal classifications and stereotypes==

===Underclass===
[[File:Ferrier Estate.jpg|thumb|Many unemployed people rely on the [[Welfare state in the United Kingdom|welfare payments]] and are housed in [[Social housing in the United Kingdom|social housing]], such as council estates]].
{{See also|Underclass}}
The term "underclass" is used to refer to those people who are "chronically unemployed", and in many instances have been for generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/614168/underclass|title=Social Class (social differentiation)|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical characteristics are:
* Long-term unemployment, sometimes for generations.
* Living in council housing.

There is a contention that there are homologies between the meaning context and tenor of the abusive popular word "[[chav]]" and the term "underclass" in media discourses: the obvious difference being the former relates to supposed dispositions of a social class in consumption and the later to difficulties of a social class in productive labour relations.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, K. and Yar, M., 2006. The ‘chav’ phenomenon: Consumption, media and the construction of a new underclass. Crime, Media, Culture, 2(1), pp.9-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The "underclass" has also been blamed for the [[2011 England riots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/9128779/How-we-can-turn-the-underclass-around.html|title=How we can turn the underclass around|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|author=Charlie Taylor|date=7 March 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14488486|title=England riots: The return of the underclass|publisher=bbc.co.uk|author=Mark Easton|date=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Working class===

====Unskilled and semi-skilled working class====
Traditionally, these people would have worked as [[manual labourers]]. They would typically have left school as soon as legally permissible and not have been able to take part in [[higher education]].&lt;ref name=Cooper/&gt; Many would go on to work in semi-skilled and unskilled jobs on the assembly lines and machine shops of Britain's major [[car factories]], [[steel mills]], [[coal mines]], [[foundries]] and [[textile mills]] in the highly industrialised cities in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], [[North of England]], [[South Wales]] and the [[Scottish Lowlands]].

However, since the mid-1970s and early-1980s, [[de-industrialisation]] has shattered many of these communities, resulting in a complete deterioration in [[quality of life]] and a reversal in rising [[living standards]] for the [[industrial working class]]. Many either dropped in status to the [[working poor]] or fell into permanent reliance on [[welfare dependence]]. Some dropped out altogether and joined the [[black market economy]], while a limited few did manage to ascend to the [[lower middle-class]].

The [[Mosaic (geodemography)|Mosaic 2010]] groups where the proportion of residents in NRS social grade D was rated "high" in the 2010 Mosaic Index are "Residents with sufficient incomes in right-to-buy social housing" and "Families in low-rise social housing with high levels of benefit need".

Fictional stereotypes include: [[Andy Capp]] and [[Albert Steptoe]], who is not only unaspirational himself; but crushes the aspirations of his son Harold.

It has been argued&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isj.org.uk/?id=293|title=The shape of the working class – International Socialism|author=|date=|website=www.isj.org.uk|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that with the decline in manufacturing and increase in the service sector, lower-paid [[office workers]] are effectively working-class. [[Call centre]]s in particular, have sprung up in former centres of industry. However, since the early-2000s; there has been a trend for many call centres to close down in the UK and outsource their jobs to [[India]], as part of cost-cutting measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/our-towns-and-cities/sheffield/new-call-centre-creates-200-jobs-in-sheffield-1-8320022|title=New Call Centre Creates 200 Jobs in Sheffield|publisher=The Star|author=Robert Cumber|date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/business/sheffield-call-centre-set-to-create-150-jobs-1-8198111|title=Sheffield Call Centre Set to Create 150 Jobs|publisher=The Star|date=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Street of terraced housing.jpg|thumb|right|Terraced housing in [[Loughborough]], built for the working classes.]]
During the post-war era, [[White British|White]] working-class Britons witnessed a big rise in their standard of living. As noted by [[Denys Blakeway]]:

"The White working-class have prospered hugely since the war. They have experienced unparalleled growth in disposable income and today they are now richer than their parents and grandparents could ever have imagined.  There are shared values in White working-class culture but I think it is incredibly difficult to put your finger on exactly what it is that defines "White working-class" because a lot of them are shared by the middle-class, such as football and the pub."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7296072.stm | work=BBC News | first=Dan | last=Bell | title=Who are the white working class? | date=14 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Skilled working class====
This class of people would be in skilled [[industry|industrial]] jobs or tradesmen, traditionally in the construction and manufacturing industry, but in recent decades showing entrepreneurial development as the stereotypical [[white van man]], or self-employed contractors.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt; These people would speak in regional accents and have  completed craft [[apprenticeship]]s rather than a [[university education]]. The only Mosaic 2010 group where the proportion of residents in NRS social grade C2 was rated "high" in the 2010 Mosaic Index is "Residents with sufficient incomes in right-to-buy social housing".&lt;ref&gt;Mosaic 2010 grand index&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle class===
[[File:Ashley Walk, Mill Hill - geograph.org.uk - 458447.jpg|thumb|A suburban street in Mill Hill, London, typical of middle-class housing]]
{{see also|Middle England}}

====Lower middle class====
The British lower middle-class primarily consists of [[office worker]]s. In the nineteenth century, the middle and lower middle classes were able to live in suburbs due to the development of horse-drawn omnibuses and railways.&lt;ref name="bl.uk"&gt;https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/suburbia#&lt;/ref&gt; One radical Liberal politician ([[Charles Masterman]]), writing in 1909 used "the Middle Classes" and "the suburbans" synonymously.&lt;ref name="bl.uk"/&gt; In the early twenty-first century, there were no Mosaic 2010 geodemographic groups where the proportion of residents in NRS social grade C1 was rated as "high" or "low" in the 2010 Index; it was rated as "average" in all Mosaic groups,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Mosaic 2010 Grand Index&lt;/ref&gt; whether these were of a suburban, rural, city or small-town nature.

They are typically employed in relatively unskilled service sector jobs (such as in retail sales or [[travel agent]]s), or work in [[local government]] or are factory and other industrial building owners. Prior to the expansion in higher education from the 1960s onwards, members of this class generally did not have a university education.

Members of the lower middle-class typically speak in local accents, although relatively mild. Votes in this area are split and minority parties will have a stronger proportion. The comedy character [[Hyacinth Bucket]] is a satirical stereotype for this social group.

====Middle middle class====
The middle-class in Britain often consists of people with [[tertiary education]] and may have been educated at either [[state school|state]] or [[private school]]s.&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;[[Kate Fox]], {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-kDPgxYU-s0C&amp;dq=%27%27Watching+the+English%27%27 |title=Watching the English: The Hidden Rules of English Behaviour |publisher=Nicholas Brealey Pub. |accessdate=4 October 2009 |isbn=9781857884470 |date=2 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical jobs include: [[accountant]]s, [[architect]]s, [[solicitor]]s, [[surveyor]]s, [[social worker]]s, [[teacher]]s, [[manager]]s, specialist IT workers, [[engineer]]s, [[Physician|doctors]], university-educated [[nurse]]s and [[civil servant]]s. Displays of [[conspicuous consumption]] are considered vulgar by them; instead they prefer to channel excess income into investments, especially property.

Members of the middle-class are often politically and socially engaged (a Mori poll in 2005 found 70% of grades AB voted at the [[2005 UK general election|2005 general election]] compared to 54% of grades DE) and might be regular churchgoers (a YouGov poll in 2014 found 62% of those attending church at least once a month were NRS grades ABC1),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brin.ac.uk/2015/demography-of-churchgoing-and-other-news/|title=Demography of Churchgoing and Other News - British Religion in Numbers|date=22 February 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.singularinsight.com/men-practising-christian-worship.html|title=Men practising Christian worship|website=S I N G U L A R &amp;nbsp; I N S I G H T}}&lt;/ref&gt; might sit on local committees and governing boards or stand for political office. Education is greatly valued by the middle-classes: they will make every effort to ensure their children get offered a place at university; they may send their children to a  [[private education|private school]], hire a home tutor for out of school hours so their child learns at a faster rate, or go to great lengths to get their children enrolled into good state or selective grammar schools; such as moving house into the catchment area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23576398-rise-in-families-caught-cheating-for-school-places.do|title=Rise in families caught cheating for school places|author=|date=|website=thisislondon.co.uk|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Upper middle class====
[[File:The Old Schools, Harrow School.JPG|thumb|[[Harrow School]]. The public school is traditionally one of the key institutions of the upper-middle-class in Britain.&lt;ref name="Britain 1950, page 679"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Urban History of Britain: 1840–1950 |location=Cambridge |year=2000 |first1=David Michael |last1=Palliser |first2=Peter |last2=Clark |first3=Martin J. |last3=Daunton |page=679 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The upper middle-class in Britain broadly consists of people who were born into families which have traditionally possessed high incomes, although this group is defined more by family background than by job or income. This stratum, in England, traditionally uses the [[Received Pronunciation]] dialect natively.

The upper middle-class are traditionally educated at [[independent school (United Kingdom)|independent schools]], preferably one of the "major" or "minor" "[[public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/columnists/james-delingpole/7482608/thank-god-i-dont-have-that-ghastly-sense-of-entitlement-that-eton-instils/ |title=Thank God I don’t have that ghastly sense of entitlement that Eton instils |work=[[The Spectator]] |date=17 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/20/clegg-cameron-posher |title=Who's posher: Clegg or Cameron? |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=20 April 2010 |first=Sholto |last=Byrnes }}&lt;/ref&gt; which themselves often have pedigrees going back for hundreds of years and charge fees of as much as £33,000 per year per pupil (as of 2014).&lt;ref name="Britain 1950, page 679"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9821490/Is-there-a-private-school-prejudice.html |title=Is there a private school prejudice? |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=28 January 2013 |first=Nigel |last=Farndale }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many upper-middle-class families may have previous ancestry that often directly relates to the [[upper class]]es. Although not necessarily of the landowning classes – as a result, perhaps, of lack of a male heir – many families' titles/styles have not been inherited and therefore many families' past status became dissolved.

===Upper class===
{{Main|Upper class}}
[[File:WoburnAbbey01.JPG|thumb|[[Woburn Abbey]], family seat of the [[Duke of Bedford]]]]
The [[United Kingdom|British]] "upper-class" is statistically very small and consists of the [[peerage]], [[gentry]] and hereditary landowners, among others. Those in possession of a hereditary peerage (but not a life peerage; for example, a [[duke]]dom, a [[marquess]]ate, an [[earl]]dom, a [[viscount]]y, or a [[baron]]y/Scottish [[lord of parliament]]) are typically members of the upper class.

Traditionally, upper-class children were brought up at home by a [[nanny]] for the first few years of their lives, and then home schooled by private [[tutors]]. From the late-nineteenth century, it became increasingly popular for upper-class families to mimic the middle-classes in sending their children to [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]], which had been predominantly founded to serve the educational needs of the middle-class.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}  Nowadays, when children are old enough, they may attend a [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|prep school]] or pre-preparatory school. Moving into [[secondary education]], it is still commonplace for upper-class children to attend a public school, although it is not unheard of for certain families to send their children to [[state school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas Sutherland]], ''[[The English Gentleman]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Continuing education goals can vary from family to family; it may, in part, be based on the educational history of the family.  In the past, both the [[British Army]] and [[Royal Navy]] have been the institutions of choice.  Equally, the [[clergy]], as well as [[academia]], particularly within the [[arts]] and [[humanities]] divisions of Britain's oldest and most prestigious [[universities]] ([[Oxbridge]]), have been traditional career paths amongst the [[upper class]] - indeed until 1840 the majority Oxbridge graduates were destined for ordination.&lt;ref name="Knight"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Frances Knight|title=The Nineteenth-Century Church and English Society|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-65711-2|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accent and language and social class==

===Received Pronunciation===
[[Received Pronunciation]], also known as RP or [[BBC]] English, was a term introduced as way of defining ''standard'' English, but the accent has acquired a certain prestige from being associated with the middle (and above) classes in the South East; the wealthiest part of England. Use of RP by people from the "regions" outside the South East can be indicative of a certain educational background, such as public school or elocution lessons.

"The Queen's English" was once a synonym for RP. However, the Queen and some other older members of the aristocracy are now perceived as speaking in a way that is both more old-fashioned and higher class than "general" RP. [[Phonetician]]s call this accent "Conservative Received Pronunciation".  The Queen's pronunciation has, however, also changed over the years. The results of the Harrington &amp; al. study&lt;ref&gt;Harrington, J., Palethorpe, S., &amp; Watson, C. (2000b). Does the Queen speak the Queen’s
English? Nature Vol. 408, 927.&lt;/ref&gt; can be interpreted either as a change, in a range not normally perceptible, in the direction of the mainstream RP of a reference corpus of 1980s newsreaders,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1515/rela-2015-0010|title = Changes in Received Pronunciation: Diachronic Case Studies|journal = Research in Language|volume = 13|pages = 21–37|year = 2015|last1 = Hinton|first1 = Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; or showing showing subtle changes that might well have been influenced by the vowels of [[Estuary English]].&lt;ref name="DT"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/the_queens_diamond_jubilee/9280753/The-Queens-English-changes-through-the-years.html|title=The Queen's English: changes through the years|first=Susie|last=Dent|date=21 May 2012|publisher=|accessdate=30 March 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BBC English was also a synonym for RP; people seeking a career in acting or broadcasting once learnt RP as a matter of course if they did not speak it already.  However, the BBC and other broadcasters are now much more willing to use – indeed desire to use – regional accents.&lt;ref name="DT" /&gt;

Language and writing style have consistently been one of the most reliable indicators of class, although pronunciation did not become such an indicator until the late-nineteenth century. The variations between the language employed by the upper classes and non-upper classes has, perhaps, been best documented by linguistic Professor [[Alan S C Ross|Alan Ross's]] 1954 article on [[U and non-U English]] usage, with "U" representing upper and upper middle class vocabulary of the time, and "Non-U" representing lower middle class vocabulary. The discussion was furthered in ''[[Noblesse Oblige (book)|Noblesse Oblige]]'' and featured contributions from, among others, [[Nancy Mitford]]. The debate was revisited in the mid-1970s, in a publication by Debrett's called ''U and Non-U Revisited''. Ross also contributed to this volume, and it is remarkable to notice how little the language (amongst other factors) changed in the passing of a quarter of a century.

===English regional dialect===
{{main|Regional accents of English}}

In England, the upper class or prestige dialect is almost always a form of RP; however, some areas have their
"own" prestige dialect, distinct from both RP and the working-class dialect of the region.

England has a wide variety of regional dialects for a small country, most of which have working-class or lower middle-class connotations:
*[[Yorkshire dialect]] the accent of Yorkshire with some considerable variation between the north, south, east and west of the region.
*[[Manchester dialect]] the accent and dialect of [[Manchester]] and the surrounding area. 
*[[Scouse]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; The accent and dialect of Liverpool, especially strong in Merseyside's working-class population.
*[[Brummie]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; The accent and dialect of Birmingham.
*[[Potteries dialect]] the accent and dialect of [[Stoke-on-Trent]] and surround Potteries area.
*The [[Black Country dialect]] of the West Midlands, which is similar to but distinctive from Brummie.
*[[Geordie]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; An accent and dialect of North-East England, particularly the Tyneside area.
* [[Mackem]] – An accent and dialect of Sunderland and surrounding areas.
*[[West Country dialects]] - a variety of similar, yet noticeably different accents and dialects in the South West of England, such as the [[Bristolian dialect]]
*[[Cockney]] is traditionally the working-class accent of [[East London]]. It also has distinct variations in grammar and vocabulary.
*The [[London accent]] is a more broadly defined working and lower middle-class accent than Cockney.
*[[Estuary English]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; A working-class and lower middle-class accent from South-East England, basically a milder (closer to R.P.)  form of the London accent,  showing a tendency to supplant received pronunciation.
*[[Mockney]] is a term used in popular media for a deliberate affectation of the working-class London (Cockney) accent by middle-class people to gain "[[street credibility]]". However, phoneticians regard the infusion of Estuary features into received pronunciation among younger speakers to be a natural process.
* [[Multicultural London English]] (abbreviated MLE), colloquially called [[Jafaican]], is a [[dialect]] (and/or [[sociolect]]) of [[English language|English]] that emerged in the late-twentieth century, and is used mainly by young, [[inner-city]], [[working-class]] people in inner London. It is said to contain many elements from the languages of the [[Caribbean]] ([[Jamaica]] and [[Trinidad &amp; Tobago]]), [[South Asia]] ([[Indian subcontinent]]), and [[West Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The English slanguage|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|author=Paul Kerswill|date=3 July 2010|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/3039887/The-English-slanguage.html|accessdate=5 April 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ES"&gt;{{cite web|title=Word on the street in London|author=Harry Mount|date=1 July 2010|work=[[Evening Standard]]|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/lifestyle/article-23851474-word-on-the-street-in-london.do|accessdate=5 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100915161805/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/lifestyle/article-23851474-word-on-the-street-in-london.do|archivedate=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as remnants of traditional Cockney.&lt;ref name="ES"/&gt; Although the street name, "Jafaican", may seem imply that it is "fake" [[Jamaican English|Jamaican]], research indicates it is "likely that young people have been growing up in London exposed to a mixture of second-language English and local London English and that this new variety has emerged from that mix",&lt;ref name=dailymail&gt;{{cite news |first=Laura |last=Clark |title='Jafaican' is wiping out inner-city English accents |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=382734&amp;in_page_id=1770&amp;in_a_source |date=12 April 2006 |accessdate=2 February 2008 |location=London |work=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; the etymology being the "af" and "can" from "African".

==Heraldry and social class==
{{Main|Heraldry}}
[[File:Coat of Arms of Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon.svg|thumb|right|[[Canting arms]] of [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]].]]
An English citizen with arms registered in the [[College of Arms]], or a Scottish citizen in the [[Lyon Court]], can be referred to as [[armiger]]ous.  Any British citizen can apply for arms from their respective authority but only those of sufficient social standing would be granted arms.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}  Arms in and of themselves are imperfectly aligned with social status, in that many of high status will have no right to arms whilst, on the other hand, those entitled to arms by descent can include branches of families from anywhere on the social scale.

Nevertheless, a right to bear arms under the [[Law of Arms]] is, by definition, linked either to the personal acquisition of social status, inspiring application for a personal grant of arms, or to descent from a person who did so in the past. Rightly or wrongly, therefore, the use of a coat of arms is linked to social prestige.

In the early twentieth century, it was argued by heraldic writers such as [[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies]] that only those with a right to a coat of arms could correctly be described (if men) as gentlemen and of noble status; however, even at the time this argument was controversial, and it was rejected by other writers such as [[Oswald Barron]] and [[Horace Round]]. In the [[Order of Malta]], where proof of technical nobility is a requirement of certain grades of membership, British members must still base their proof upon an ancestral right to a coat of arms.

==Criticisms==

In 1941, George Orwell wrote that Britain was “the most class-ridden society under the sun.”
&lt;ref&gt;The Future of Socialism by Anthony Crosland&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview in 1975 [[Helmut Schmidt]], the then [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Chancellor]] of [[West Germany]] stated that:

{{Quote|If one asks oneself what are the true reasons for the differentiated development of societies and economies between the British and most ones on the Continent, I think it has something to do with the fact that British society, much more than the Scandinavian, German, Austrian, and Dutch societies, is characterised by a class-struggle type of society. This is true for both sides of the upper class as well as for the working classes. I think that the way in which organised Labour on the one hand and industrial management on the other had dealt with their problems is outmoded.}}

Later in the same interview, Schmidt noted that&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | title = Foe into friend: The Makers of the New Germany from Konrad Adenauer to Helmut Schmidt
 | first =Marion | last = Dönhoff
}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|You have to treat workers as equal members of society. You have to give them the self–esteem which they can only have if they acquire responsibility. Then you will be able to ask the trade unions to behave and to abstain from those idiotic policies. Then they will accept some guidance from outsiders—from the government or the party or whatever it is. But as long as you maintain the damned class-ridden society of yours you will never get out of your mess.}}

'''Sweden Finns''' ({{lang-fi|ruotsinsuomalaiset}}, {{lang-sv|sverigefinnar}}) are a Finnish-speaking national minority in [[Sweden]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ds 2001:10 Mänskliga rättigheter i Sverige|url=http://www.regeringen.se/49baf9/contentassets/1d150242dfad40899b9bea8f7601de3c/manskliga-rattigheter-i-sverige---en-kartlaggning|publisher=The Government of Sweden|page=20|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of Finns historically residing in Sweden as well as Finnish immigrants to Sweden. Sweden-Finns should not be confused with the Swedish-speaking [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Finland-Swedes]] in [[Finland]], who comprise a linguistic minority in [[Finland]].

People with Finnish heritage comprise a relatively large share of the population of Sweden. In addition to a smaller part of Sweden Finns historically residing in Sweden, there were about 426,000 people in Sweden (4.46% of the total population in 2012) who were either born in Finland or had at least one parent who was born in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fler med finsk bakgrund i Sverige|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/gruppsida.aspx?programid=185&amp;grupp=16837&amp;artikel=5451293|publisher=Sverige Radio|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[Swedish language]], the [[Finnish language]] has been spoken on both sides of the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] since the late middle ages. Following [[Second_Swedish_Crusade|military campaigns in Finland]] by Sweden in the 13th century, Finland gradually came under Swedish rule and made Finns in Finland and Sweden were subjugates of Sweden. Already in the 1400s, a sizeable population of Stockholm spoke Finnish, and around 4% in the 1700s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SOU 2005:40 Rätten till mitt språk (del 2)|url=http://www.regeringen.se/49bb02/contentassets/04d1aeaf419e46938a5222e27f5d747e/ratten-till-mitt-sprak-del-2|publisher=SOU 2005:40|accessdate=23 February 2017|pages=217-218}}{{sv ikon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finland remained a part of Sweden until 1809 when the peace after the [[Finnish War]] handed Finland to the [[Russian Empire]], though leaving Finnish populations on the Swedish side of the [[Torne_(river)|Torne river]].

In the 1940s, 70,000 young [[Finnish people|Finnish]] [[Finnish war children|children were evacuated]] from Finland. Most of them came to Sweden during the [[Winter War]] and the [[Continuation War]], and around 20% remained after the war. Helped by the [[Nordic Passport Union]], Finnish immigration to Sweden was considerable during the 1950s and 1960s. In 2015, Finnish immigrants to Sweden made out 156 045 persons (or 1.58% of the Swedish population)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finland och Irak de två vanligaste födelsälnderna|publisher=Statistics Sweden|url=http://www.scb.se/sv_/Hitta-statistik/Artiklar/Finland-och-Irak-de-tva-vanligaste-fodelselanderna-bland-utrikes-fodda/|year=2005|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all of them, however, were Finnish speakers. The national minority of Sweden Finns usually does not include immigrated Swedish-speaking Finns, and the national minority of Sweden Finns is protected by Swedish laws that grant specific rights to speakers of the [[Finnish language]]. English somewhat lacks the distinction between '''Finns in Sweden''' ({{lang-sv|sverigefinländare}}), which emphases nationality rather than linguistic or ethnic belonging and thereby includes all Finnish heritage regardless of language, and '''Sweden Finns''' ({{lang-sv|sverigefinnar}}) which emphases linguistic and ethnic belonging rather than nationality and usually excludes Swedish-speaking Finns. Such distinctions are, however, blurred by the dynamics of migration, bilingualism, and national identities in the two countries. Note that speakers of [[Meänkieli_dialects|Meänkieli]] are singled out as a separate linguistic minority by Swedish authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nationella minoriteter|publisher=The Government of Sweden|url=http://www.regeringen.se/regeringens-politik/demokrati-och-manskliga-rattigheter/nationella-minoriteter/|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Denominations and definitions==
Dimensions of language, ethnicity, and origin complicate the terms dividing the populations of Finland and Sweden. In Finland, both Swedish and Finnish are official languages. The Swedish-Finns are [[Swedish-speaking_population_of_Finland|Finnish nationals who speak Swedish]]. The variant of [[standard Swedish]] spoken in Finland is called [[Finland Swedish]] or Finno-Swedish, and those who speak it are [[Finland-Swedes]]. Because of the shared language, Finland-Swedes are overrepresented in the migration of Finnish nationals to Sweden. Swedish-speakers make out 5.3% of the total Finnish population,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Population|publisher=Statistics Finland|url=http://www.stat.fi/tup/suoluk/suoluk_vaesto_en.html|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while around 20% of Finnish immigrants to Sweden were Swedish-speakers according to a 2004 estimation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Geer|first1=Eric|title=Den finska närvaron i Mälarregionen|url=http://www.arkisto.org/envision/images/Dokumentarkiv/1.13113%21finska_narvaron%5b1%5d.pdf|pages=12-13|accessdate=23 February 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816043354/http://www.arkisto.org/envision/images/Dokumentarkiv/1.13113%21finska_narvaron%5B1%5D.pdf|archivedate=16 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden-Finns, however (this article), refers rather to Finnish-speaking Finns in Sweden, since Swedish authorities connect the rights of this national minority with the usage of the Finnish language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=En stärkt minoritetspolitik - översyn av lagen om nationella minoriteter och minoritetsspråk|publisher=The Government of Sweden (Ds. 2016:73)|url=http://www.regeringen.se/4ad8ea/contentassets/692be474ca9f4bc8a2e8d43b0a086c0c/en-starkt-minoritetspolitik--oversyn-av-lagen-om-nationella-minoriteter-och-minoritetssprak-dir-201673|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a wider definition, people of Finnish origin, regardless of language, may be Sweden Finns (in the sense of Finnish nationals in Sweden). In Swedish, the term ''sverigefinländare'' includes both language-groups while ''sverigefinnar'', and the less common ''sverigefinlandssvenskar'', refers to the Finnish-speaking and Swedish-speaking groups respectively.

In addition to Finnish immigrants,  the term ''Sweden Finns'' also includes Finns historically residing in Sweden. A small group of ethnic Finns with origins in [[Ingria]] in [[East Karelia]] would also be Sweden Finns on ethic and linguistic basis. After the Second World War, around 4500 refugees came to Sweden from Ingria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historik|url=http://www.ingermanland.nu/historia.shtml|publisher=Sveriges Ingermanländska Riksförbund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Communities of Finns in Sweden can be traced back to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] when the Finnish Church in Stockholm was founded in 1533, although earlier migration, and migration to other cities in present-day Sweden, remain undisputed. (Strictly speaking this was not a case of [[Immigration|emigration/immigration]] but of ''"internal migration"'' within [[Lands of Sweden|pre-1809]] Sweden.)

In the 16th and the 17th century large groups of [[Savonian people|Savonians]] moved from Finland to [[Dalecarlia]], [[Bergslagen]] and other provinces where their [[slash and burn]] cultivation was suitable. This was part of an effort of the Swedish king [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]], and his successors, to expand agriculture to these uninhabited parts of the country which were later on known as "Finn woods" (''Finnskogar'').

In the 1600s, there were plans to set up a new region [[Järle län]] that would have contained most of the [[skogsfinnar]]. It should be noted that in Sweden at this time, all legislation and official journals were also published in Finnish.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017|reason=Utterly implausible claim that is almost certainly wrong; even in Finland Finnish language only became equal with Swedish in 1863. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_language#Official_status}} Bank-notes were issued in Swedish and Finnish etc. After 1809, and the loss of the eastern part of Sweden (Finland) to Russia, the [[Swedish church]] planned a Finnish-speaking bishopric with [[Filipstad]] as seat. However, after the mid-1800s [[cultural imperialism]] and [[nationalism]] lead to new policies of [[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilation]] and Swedification of the Finnish-speaking population. These efforts peaked from the end of the 1800s and until the 1950s. Finnish speakers remain only along the border with Finland in the far North, and as domestic migrants due to unemployment in the North. Depending on definition they are reported to number to 30,000&amp;ndash;90,000 &amp;mdash; that is up to 1% of Sweden's population, but the proportion of active Finnish-speakers among them has declined drastically in the last generations, and Finnish is hardly spoken among the youngsters today. Since the 1970s largely unsuccessful efforts have been made to reverse some of the effects of Swedification, notably education and public broadcasts in Finnish, to raise the status of Finnish. As a result, a written [[standard language|standard]] of the local [[dialect]] [[Meänkieli]] has been established and taught, which has given reason to critical remarks from Finland, along the line that standard Finnish would be of more use for the students.

The Finnish immigrants who moved to Sweden in the 1950s and 1960s were sometimes despised as being a very "low-class" people, as portrayed in the Swedish book and movie [[Svinalängorna (disambiguation)|Svinalängorna]]. In 2009, [[Maria Wetterstrand]], Swedish politician and then leader of the [[Green Party (Sweden)|Green Party]], wrote a Swedish article in [[Dagens Nyheter]] about this, and demanded that Sweden ought to give Finland an official apology. [[Matti Vanhanen]], then [[Prime Minister of Finland]], responded in 2011 that an apology was not needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Swedish+PM+says+Finland+and+Sweden+do+not+need+to+apologise+to+each+other+over+common+history/1135242786506 Swedish PM says Finland and Sweden do not need to apologise to each other over common history&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution of Sweden Finns==
The city of [[Eskilstuna]], [[Södermanland]], is one of the most heavily populated Sweden Finnish cities of Sweden, due to migration from Finland, during the 1950s until the 1970s, due to Eskilstuna's large number of industries. In Eskilstuna, the Finnish-speaking minority have both a private school (the only one in the city of Eskilstuna, there is no public school or teachers in Finnish at the public schools. Only the lower level is in Finnish, upper level is in Swedish) and only one magazine in Finnish. Some of the municipal administration is also available in Finnish.

[[Image:Finsktalande södra sverige.png|thumb|right|300px|Areas with Finnish-speaking population in per cent, in southern Sweden, 2005]]
In the Finnish mindset, the term "Sweden Finns" ''(ruotsinsuomalaiset)'' is first and foremost directed at these [[immigrant]]s and their offspring, who at the end of the 20th century numbered almost 200,000 first-generation immigrants, and about 250,000 second-generation immigrants. Of these &lt;!-- 430,000 --&gt;  some 250,000 are estimated to use Finnish in their daily lives, {{citation needed|date=March 2013}} and 100,000 remain [[Finnish citizen|citizens of Finland]]. This usage isn't quite embraced in Sweden&lt;!--, due to the implicate expectation that the immigrated Finns as well as the indigenous minority ought to be entitled to minority rights similar to those of the indigenous [[Finland-Swedish|Swedophones]] in Finland--&gt;. According to the latest research by Radio of Sweden (Sveriges Radio), there are almost 470,000 people who speak or understand Finnish or ''[[Meänkieli]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://sverigesradio.se/sida/gruppsida.aspx?programid=185&amp;grupp=20780&amp;artikel=5793792 Kuuntelijat - Lyssnarna] {{fi icon}}/{{sv icon}} Sveriges Radio&lt;/ref&gt; which is about 5.2% of the population of Sweden. {{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In the Swedish mindset, the term "Sweden Finns" historically denominated primarily the (previously) [[un-assimilated]] [[indigenous minority]] of [[ethnic Finn]]s who ended up on the Swedish side of the border when Sweden was partitioned in 1809, after the [[Finnish War]], and the [[Imperial Russia|Russian]] [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] was created. These ''Finnish-speaking Swedes'' are chiefly categorized as either [[Tornedalians]] originating at the Finnish&amp;ndash;Swedish border in the far north, or ''[[Forest Finns|skogsfinnar]]'' ("forest Finns") along the Norwegian&amp;ndash;Swedish border in Central Sweden.

== Genetics ==
In 2011, a detailed genetic study was made in order to, among other reasons, see how similar the Sweden Finns were to the native Swedes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0022547 The Genetic Structure of the Swedish Population&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Each samples in the study were looked at individually, to make sure that the Swedes had full grandparental ancestry from their represented Swedish regions respectively, and the Sweden-born Finns having all of their ancestry from Finland. The Swedes who showed the closest FST distance (meaning greatest genetic similarity) to the Sweden Finns were those from [[East Middle Sweden]] and [[North Middle Sweden]], having distances of 4.66 and 4.67. The most similar Swedes after those were the ones from [[Stockholm]] (4.81). [[Upper Norrland]] was the second most distanced (and thus one of the most dissimilar), at 5.61.

The greatest FST distance between the Swedes and the Sweden Finns was 5.63, and that accounted for the Swedes who came from the [[Skåneland|southernmost regions]]. The greatest FST distance within the Swedish group as a whole, for comparison, was between Southern Sweden and Upper Norrland (3.19), despite Upper Norrland being one of the most distanced Swedish groups from the Sweden Finns as well.

== Today ==
Today, Finns are the largest immigrant group in Sweden, and Finnish is an official [[minority languages of Sweden|minority language of Sweden]]. The benefits of being a "minority language" are however limited to Finnish-speakers being able to use Finnish for some communication with local and regional authorities in a small number of communities ''([[Borås]], [[Borlänge]], [[Botkyrka]], [[Degerfors]], [[Enköping]], [[Eskilstuna]], [[Fagersta]], [[Finspång]], [[Gällivare]], [[Gävle]], [[Göteborg]], [[Gislaved]], [[Hällefors]], [[Håbo]], [[Hallstahammar]], [[Haninge]], [[Haparanda]], [[Hofors]], [[Huddinge]], [[Järfälla]], [[Köping]], [[Kalix]], [[Karlskoga]], [[Kiruna]], [[Lindesberg]], [[Ludvika]], [[Luleå]], [[Malmö]], [[Mariestad]], [[Motala]], [[Norrköping]], [[Nykvarn]], [[Oxelösund]], [[Pajala]], [[Söderhamn]], [[Södertälje]], [[Sandviken]], [[Sigtuna]], [[Skövde]], [[Skellefteå]], [[Skinnskatteberg]], [[Smedjebacken]], [[Solna]], [[Stockholm]], [[Sundbyberg]], [[Sundsvall]], [[Surahammar]], [[Tierp]], [[Trelleborg]], [[Trollhättan]], [[Trosa]], [[Uddevalla]], [[Umeå]], [[Upplands-Väsby]], [[Uppsala]], [[Västerås]], [[Norrtälje]], [[Upplands-Bro]], [[Älvkarleby]], [[Örebro]], [[Örnsköldsvik]], [[Österåker]], [[Östhammar]], [[Övertorneå]])'' where Finnish immigrants make up a considerable share of the population, but not in the rest of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lagen.nu/2009:724#P6 Lag (2009:724) om nationella minoriteter och minoritetsspråk].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9422">[[File:Quesnay Tableau.jpg|thumb|240px|Illustration of the original visualisation of the Tableau by [[François Quesnay|Quesnay]], 1759.]] 
The '''Tableau économique''' ({{IPA-fr|tablo ekɔnɔmik}}) or ''Economic Table'' is an economic model first described by French economist [[François Quesnay]] in 1758, which laid the foundation of the [[Physiocrats|Physiocratic]] school of economics.&lt;ref name="Spiegel 1983 p.189"&gt;Henry William Spiegel (1983) ''The Growth of Economic Thought'', Revised and Expanded Edition, Duke University Press. p.189&lt;/ref&gt;

Quesnay believed that trade and industry were not sources of wealth, and instead in his 1758 manuscript ''Tableau économique'' (Economic Table) argued that agricultural surpluses, by flowing through the economy in the form of rent, wages, and purchases were the real economic movers.
== The model ==
The model Quesnay created consisted of three economic movers. The "Proprietary" class consisted of only landowners. The "Productive" class consisted of all agricultural laborers. The "Sterile" class is made up of artisans and merchants. The flow of production and/or cash between the three classes started with the Proprietary class because they own the land and they buy from both of the other classes. The process has these steps (consult Figure 1).

#The farmer produces 1,500 food on land leased from the landlord. Of that 1,500, he retains 600 food to feed himself, his livestock, and any laborers he hires. He sells the remaining 900 in the market for $1 per unit of food. He keeps $300 ($150 for himself, $150 for his laborer) to buy non-farm goods (clothes, household goods, etc.) from the merchants and artisans. This produces $600 of net profit, to which Quesnay refers as ''product net''.&lt;ref name="Spiegel 1983 p.189"/&gt;
#The artisan produces 750 units of crafts. To produce at that level, he needs 300 units of food and 150 units of foreign goods. He also has subsistence need of 150 units of food and 150 units of crafts to keep himself alive during the year. The total is 450 units of food, 150 units of crafts, and 150 units of foreign goods. He buys $450 of food from the farmer and $150 of goods from the merchant, and he sells 600 units of crafts at the market for $600. Because the artisan must use the cash he made selling his crafts to buy raw materials for the next year’s production, he has no net profit.
#The landlord is only a consumer of food and crafts and produces no product. His contribution to the production process is the redistribution of $600 in [[economic rent#Land rent|land rent]] the farmer pays for the use of naturally occurring land.  The landlord uses $300 of the rent to buy food from the farmer in the market and $300 to buy crafts from the artisan. Because he is purely a consumer, Quesnay considers the landlord the prime mover of economic activity. It is his desire to consume which causes him to expend his entire lease income on food and crafts and which provides income to the other classes.
#The merchant is the mechanism for exporting food in exchange for foreign imports. The merchant uses the $150 he received from the artisan to buy food from the market, and it is assumed that he takes the food out of the country to exchange it for more foreign goods.

:'''Figure 1 Production Flow Diagram for Quesnay's Tableau (4)'''

The Tableau shows the reason why the Physiocrats disagreed with Cantillon about exporting food. The economy produces a surplus of food, and neither the farmer nor the artisan can afford to consume more than a subsistence level of food. The landlord is assumed to be consuming at a level of satiation; therefore, he cannot consume any more. Since food cannot be stored easily, it is necessary to sell it to someone who can use it. This is where the merchant provides value.

== Physiocratic interpretation ==
The merchant is not a source of wealth, however. The [[Physiocrats]] believed that “neither industry nor commerce generates wealth.”&lt;ref name="Charbit and Virmani 2002 p.858"&gt;Charbit and Virmani (2002) p.858&lt;/ref&gt; A “plausible explanation is that the Physiocrats developed their theory in light of the actual situation of the French economy…”&lt;ref name="Charbit and Virmani 2002 p.858"/&gt; France was an absolute monarchy with the land owners constituting 6-8% of the population and owning 50% of the land. (5, p.&amp;nbsp;859) Agriculture contributes 80% of the country’s wealth,&lt;ref name="Charbit and Virmani 2002 p.858"/&gt; and the non-land owning segment of the population “practises a subsistence agriculture that produces the essential minimum, with virtually all income being absorbed by food requirements.”&lt;ref name="Charbit and Virmani 2002 p.859"&gt;Charbit and Virmani (2002) p.859&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, exports consisted mostly of agricultural-based products, e.g. wine.&lt;ref name="Charbit and Virmani 2002 p.859"/&gt; Given the massive effect of agriculture on France’s economy, it was more likely they would develop an economic model that used it to the king’s advantage.

The Physiocrats are at the beginning of the anti-mercantilist movement. Quesnay’s argument against industry and international trade as alternatives to his doctrine is twofold. First, industry produces no gain in wealth; therefore, redirecting labor from agriculture to industry will in effect decrease the nation’s overall wealth. Additionally, population expands to fill available land and food supply; therefore, population must go down if the use of land does not produce food. Second, the basic premise of the Mercantilists is that a country must export more than it imports to gain wealth, but that assumes it has more of a tradeable resource than it needs for internal consumption. France did not have a colony with the ability to produce finished or semi-finished goods like England (e.g. India) or Holland (e.g. North America, Africa, South America). Its main colonial presence was in the Caribbean, southern North America, and southeast Asia, and like France, the colonies had agricultural-based economies. The only good which France had in enough excess to export was food; therefore, international trade based on industrial production would not yield as much wealth.

Quesnay was not anti-industry, however. He was just realistic in his assessment that France was not in good position to incubate a strong industrial market. His argument was that artisans and manufacturers would come to France only in proportion to the size of the internal market for their goods.&lt;ref name="Mueller 1978 p.153"&gt;Mueller (1978) p.153&lt;/ref&gt; Quesnay believed “a country should concentrate on manufacturing only to the extent that the local availability of raw materials and suitable labor enabled it to have a cost advantage over its overseas competitors.”&lt;ref name="Mueller 1978 p.153"/&gt; Anything above that amount should be purchased through trade.

== Legacy ==
The tableau économique is credited as the "first precise formulation" of interdependent systems in economics and the origin of the theory of the [[multiplier (economics)|multiplier]] in economics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YAIeAAAAIAAJ The multiplier theory], by Hugo Hegeland, 1954, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YAIeAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%2B%22tableau+economique%22&amp;pgis=1#search_anchor p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt; An analogous table is used in the theory of [[money creation]] under [[fractional-reserve banking]] by relending of deposits, leading to the [[money multiplier]].

The [[wage-fund doctrine]] was derived from the tableau, then later rejected.

Motilal Banarsidass Publ., Delhi, India (1995). Originally published in 1896&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used in [[Puducherry]], and by the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] population in [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Mauritius]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. Tamil Nadu farmers greatly refer to this. It is used today for cultural, religious and agricultural events,&lt;ref&gt;Indian Epigraphy, D.C. Sircar, TamilNet, Tamil New Year, 13.04.2008&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Gregorian calendar]] largely used for official purposes both within and outside India. The Tamil calendar is based on the classical [[Hindu calendar|Hindu solar calendar]] also used in [[Assam]], [[West Bengal]], [[Kerala]], [[Manipur]], [[Nepal]], [[Odisha]], [[Rajasthan]] and [[Punjab, India|Punjab]].

There are several festivals based on the Tamil calendar. The Tamil New Year follows the ''nirayanam'' [[vernal equinox]]&lt;ref&gt;Dershowitz, Nachum and Reingold, Edward M.: Calendrical Calculations. Third edition, Cambridge University Press (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; and generally falls on 14 April of the Gregorian year. 14 April marks the first day of the traditional Tamil calendar and this remains a public holiday in both Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka. Tropical vernal equinox fall around 22 March, and adding 23 degrees of trepidation or oscillation to it, we get the Hindu sidereal or ''Nirayana Mesha Sankranti'' (Sun's transition into ''nirayana'' Aries). Hence, the Tamil calendar begins on the same date in April which is observed by most traditional calendars of the rest of India - [[Assam]], [[Bengal]], [[Kerala]], [[Odisha]], [[Manipur]], Karnataka, [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;Underhill, Muriel M.: The Hindu Religious Year. Association Press, Kolkata,India (1921).&lt;/ref&gt; This also coincides with the traditional new year in [[Burma]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Bangladesh]] Nepal and [[Thailand]]. The 60-year cycle is also very ancient and is observed by most traditional calendars of India and China, and is related to 5 revolutions of Jupiter according to popular belief, or to 60-year orbit of ''Nakshatras'' (stars) as mentioned in [[Surya Siddhanta]].

The traditional Tamil year starts on 14 April {{CURRENTYEAR}}, [[Kaliyuga]] {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+3102}}. [[Vikrama era|Vikrama]] and [[Shalivahana era|Shalivahana]] Saka eras are also used. There are several references in early Tamil literature to the April new year. Nakkirar, [[Sangam period]] author of the ''[[Neṭunalvāṭai]]'', wrote in the third century CE that the sun travels each year from Mesha/Chitterai in mid-April through 11 successive signs of the zodiac.&lt;ref&gt; JV Chelliah: Pattupattu: Ten Tamil Idylls. Tamil Verses with English Translation. Thanjavur: Tamil University, 1985 -Lines 160 to 162 of the Neṭunalvāṭai.&lt;/ref&gt; Kūdalūr Kizhaar in the third century CE refers to Mesha Raasi/Chitterai i.e. mid-April as the commencement of the year in the [[Puṟanāṉūṟu]].&lt;ref&gt;The Four Hundred Songs of War and Wisdom: An Anthology of Poems from Classical Tamil, The Purananuru. Columbia University Press. 13 August 2013 - Poem 229 of Puṟanāṉūṟu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Professor Vaiyapuri Pillai, 'History of Tamil Language and Literature' Chennai, 1956, pages 35, 151&lt;/ref&gt; The Tolkaapiyam is the oldest surviving Tamil grammar that divides the year into six seasons where Chitterai i.e. mid-April marks the start of the Ilavenil season or summer.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkappiyam Porulatikaram, Peraciriyam. Ed. by R.P.C Pavanantam Pillai. 2 Vols, Longmans,Creen and Co, Madras/Bombay/Calcutta. 1917&lt;/ref&gt; The 8th century Silappadikaaram mentions the 12 Raasis or zodiac signs that correspond to the Tamil months starting with Mesha/Chitterai in mid-April.&lt;ref&gt; R. Parthasarathy, The Tale of an Anklet: An Epic of South India: The Cilappatikāram of Iḷaṅko Aṭikaḷ. New York: Columbia University Press - Canto 26. Canto 5 also describes the foremost festival in the Chola country – the Indra Vizha celebrated in Chitterai&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Manimekalai]] alludes to this very same Hindu solar calendar as we know it today&lt;ref&gt;Lakshmi Holmstrom, Silappadikaram, Manimekalai, Orient Longman Ltd, Madras 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Adiyarkunalaar, an early medieval commentator or Urai-asiriyar mentions the twelve months of the Tamil calendar with particular reference to Chitterai i.e. mid-April. There were subsequent inscriptional references in Pagan, Burma dated to the 11th century CE and in Sukhothai, Thailand dated to the 14th century CE to South Indian, often Vaishnavite, courtiers who were tasked with defining the traditional calendar that began in mid-April.&lt;ref&gt;G.H. Luce, Old Burma – Early Pagan, Locust Valley, New York, Page 68, and A.B. Griswold, 'Towards a History of Sukhodaya Art, Bangkok 1967, pages 12–32&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sixty-year cycle==
{{further|Samvatsara}}
The 60-year cycle is common to both North and South Indian traditional calendars, with the same name and sequence of years. Its earliest reference is to be found in [[Surya Siddhanta]], which [[Varahamihira]]r (550 CE) believed to be the most accurate of the then current theories of astronomy. However, in the Surya Siddhantic list, the first year was ''Vijaya'' and not ''Prabhava'' as currently used. There are some parallels in this [[sexagenary cycle]] with the [[Chinese calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Wells Williams, The Middle Kingdom, V 2, Columbia University Press, New York, 2005 Pages 69-70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kekai Manansala, Quests of the Dragon and Bird Clan, 2006, Page 236&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terrien de Lacouperie, Western Origin of the Early Chinese Civilization: From 2,300 BC to 20 AD, Asher and Co, London 1894 Page 78&lt;/ref&gt; The Surya Siddhanta and other Indian classical texts on astronomy had some influence on the Chinese calendar&lt;ref&gt;George Gheverghese Joseph, Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics, Princeton University Press, 2011, Page 304-305&lt;/ref&gt; although it merits attention that the sexagenary cycle in China is itself very old.

After the completion of sixty years, the calendar starts a new with the first year. This corresponds to the Hindu "century." The ''Vakya'' or ''Tirukannitha Panchangam'' (the traditional Tamil almanac) outlines this sequence. It is related to the position of the planets in the sky with respect to earth. It means that the two major planets Sani/Saturn (which takes 30 years to complete one cycle round the sun) and the Viyazhan/Jupiter (which takes 12 years to complete one cycle round the Sun) comes to the same position after 60 years.

The following list presents the current 60-year cycle of the Tamil calendar:&lt;ref&gt;Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, Vedic calendar: Kadavul Hindu Panchangam, Himalayan Academy, Kapaa, Hawaii, 1997; Pages 5-6,Glossary p 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebrations==
The months of the Tamil Calendar have great significance and are deeply rooted in the faith of the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] [[Hindu]]s. Some months are considered very auspicious while a few are considered inauspicious as well. Tamil months start and end based on the Sun's shift from one Rasi to the other but the names of the months are based on the star on the start of Pournami in that month. The name of the month is some times the name of the star itself. (e.g. Chithrai is always the star on the Pournami of the Chithirai month).

Some of the celebrations for each month are listed below. Dates in parentheses are not exact and usually vary by a day or two. Underneath (or beside) the months of the Hindu calendar are their Gregorian counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Kielhorn, Franz: Festal Days of the Hindu Lunar Calendar.

==Significance==
*The Hindus developed a system of calendrics that encapsulates vast periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;Wijk, Walther E. van: On Hindu Chronology, parts I–V. Acta Orientalia (1922–1927).&lt;/ref&gt; For computing the age of the earth and various geological and other epochs, as well as the age of mankind, they still employ a Tamil calendar derived from ancient astronomical data, known as the ''Tirukkanida Panchanga''&lt;ref&gt;H.P. Blavatsky, 'The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion and Philosophy' Book 2: Pages 49-51, Theosophical University Press, 1888&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 10th Tamil month, called ''Thai'', falls in mid-January each year. It is celebrated with much enthusiasm within the Tamil Community all over the world. Thai is marked by gifts of new clothing for family members and prayers to God for prosperity in the coming year. ''Thai'' and the fifth month ''Aavani'' are considered very auspicious for marriage and most marriages occur during these months.
*The fourth month ''Aadi'' is considered inauspicious, so weddings do not often fall in this month. ''Aadi'' is also the month of preparation for the next crop cycle by farmers. Therefore, farming communities avoid major events like weddings in this month. Those members of the Tamil community who don't actively contribute/participate in farming take advantage by having important functions like wedding in this month. For example, the business community prefers this month for weddings. ''Aadi'' is usually the worst month for business, although when businesses recently initiated Aadi discounts, this situation has changed significantly. Each Friday of this month is set aside for prayer and worship.
*''Aadi'' is an inauspicious month for newlyweds to sleep together because a woman who conceives in this month will have a difficult delivery in May, the hottest month in Tamil Nadu (''Agni natchathiram'' - ['pinezhu'] the last 7 days of ''Chithirai'' and ['munezhu']  the first 7 days of ''Vaigasi''). 'Aadi' is also the windiest month in Tamil Nadu, and hence the phrase 'Aadi kaatru ammiyai nagatrum' (literally, 'the strong winds in the month of Aadi can even move a stone grinder')
*''Purattaasi'' is when most of the non-vegetarian Tamil people fast from meat for a month. Each Saturday of this month is set apart to venerate the planet Saturn.
*''Deepavali'', is celebrated on the new moon day, in the seventh month ''Aipasi''. The month of ''Aipasi'' is usually characterised by the North-East Monsoon in Tamil Nadu, which has given birth to a phrase, ''Aipasi adai mazhai'' meaning the "Non-stop downpour".
*''Maargazhi'' falls in winter in Tamil Nadu, and is an auspicious month. The month is considered sacred. During the holy month of Maargazhi, houses are decorated with colorful and elaborate kolams. These are drawn on the threshold to welcome guests and divine beings to bless their houses with prosperity and happiness. The [[Shaivite]] fast of ''Thiru-vembaavai'' and the Vaishnava fast of ''Thiru-paavai'' are also observed in this month.
*The total number of days in a Tamil Calendar is an average 365 days and the days of the week are named similarly to those of the western calendar. The ''Vakiya Panchangam'' is employed for both sacred and civil calculations. The ''Trikanitha Panchangam'' is employed for [[Hindu astrology|astrological]] calculations.

==Festivals==
The Tamil Calendar is important in the life of Tamil-speaking people and most Festivals of [[Tamil Nadu]] are based on it. Some Festivals include [[Tamil New Year]] (also called ''[[Puthandu]]'') in mid-April, [[Thai Pongal]], [[Deepavali]], Panguni Uthiram, Thirukaarthigai, Aadiperukku, [[Navaratri]] etc. One day was even dedicated to a celebration of the Tamil alphabet and was called "ezhuthu naal'.

The '''Walter P. Reuther Library, Archives of Labor and Urban Affairs''', located on the campus of [[Wayne State University]] in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], contains millions of primary source documents related to the [[labor history of the United States]], urban affairs, and the Wayne State University Archives. The building is named for [[UAW]] President and [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] President [[Walter Reuther]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reuther.wayne.edu/about |title=About Us |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Walter P. Reuther Library |publisher=Wayne State University |accessdate=October 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Walter P. Reuther Library of Labor and Urban Affairs was established at [[Wayne State University]] in 1960 to collect and preserve original documents related to the American labor movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Guide to the Archives of Labor History and Urban Affairs |last=Pflug |first=Warner W. |year=1974 |publisher=Wayne State University Press |location=Detroit |isbn=0-8143-1501-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library is named for early [[United Auto Workers]] organizer and president [[Walter Reuther]]. For over thirty years, the library's collections grew under the leadership of director [[Philip P. Mason]]. In 1975, a dedicated building was constructed for the library, using funds donated by the [[UAW]] and a grant from the [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Walter P. Reuther Library of Labor and Urban Affairs |last=East |first=Dennis |year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architectural firm Odell, Hewlett, and Luckenbach designed the initial construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Walter P. Reuther Library of Labor and Urban Affairs |last=East |first=Dennis |year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, the library's [[Leonard Woodcock]] Wing was completed, which added over 26,000 square feet to the building.&lt;ref&gt;Lippert, John, "Labor of Love: Reuther Labor Archives to Dedicate Expansion of Wayne State Facility", ''Detroit Free Press'', October, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==

===Labor records===
The Reuther Library is the home of the largest labor archives in the United States, and contains over 75,000 linear feet of archival holdings, including paper and digital manuscript material, photographic prints and negatives, oral histories, audio recordings, and motion picture recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Walter P. Reuther Library of Labor and Urban Affairs |last=East |first=Dennis |year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library serves as the official archival repository for the [[Air Line Pilots Association]] (ALPA), [[American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees]] (AFSCME), the [[American Federation of Teachers]] (AFT), Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes division of the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]], Graphic Communication Conference of the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]], [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), The [[National Association of Letter Carriers]] (NALC), [[The Newspaper Guild]], [[Service Employees International Union]] (SEIU), [[United Auto Workers]] (UAW), and the [[United Farm Workers]] (UFW).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mason |first=Philip |date=October 1982 |title=The Archives of Labor and Urban Affairs, Walter P. Reuther Library |journal=Labor History |publisher= |volume=23 |issue= 4|pages=534–545 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reuther.wayne.edu/about |title=About Us |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Walter P. Reuther Library |publisher=Wayne State University |accessdate=October 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archives also collects material related to the [[Coalition of Labor Union Women]], the [[Coalition of Black Trade Unionists]], the [[Workers Defense League]] and numerous labor-related organizations, especially those active in the [[Detroit]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mason |first=Philip |date=January 1990 |title=The Archives of Labor and Urban Affairs, Walter P. Reuther Library |journal=Labor History |publisher= |volume=31 |issue= 1|pages=145–154 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers can access personal papers from labor activists and union leaders at the Reuther Library, including collections from [[Cesar Chavez]], [[Jerry Wurf]], [[Walter P. Reuther]], [[Leonard Woodcock]], James and [[Grace Lee Boggs]], [[Utah Phillips]], [[Dolores Huerta]], Jessie and [[Martin Glaberman]], [[Raya Dunayevskaya]] and many others.

Oral Histories document the work of union leaders and rank-and-file members. Notable oral history collections include "Rosie the Riveter Revisited: Women and the WWII Work Experience," and "Blacks in the Labor Movement." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reuther Library Oral Histories|url=http://reuther.wayne.edu/files/oral_histories_0.pdf|website=reuther.wayne.edu|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the library's collections document the lives of working people and were not created by labor unions. Some of these include records related to the [[civil rights movement]], predominantly during the post-[[World War II]] time period.&lt;ref&gt;''Walter P. Reuther Library: Archives of Labor and Urban Affairs, University Archives''. Detroit: Walter P. Reuther Library, 2008. Web. 17 Oct. 2014. &lt;http://reuther.wayne.edu/pdf/Brochure_2008.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous collections also document women in the workplace, both inside labor organizations and in a broader social context. A significant number of the library's oral histories relate to women's experiences at work, and the Reuther Library also serves as the official repository for the archival collections of the [[Society of Women Engineers]].

===Wayne State University Archives===
The Reuther Library houses the '''[[Wayne State University| Wayne State University Archives]]''', which date from the institution's founding as the '''Detroit Medical College''' in 1868. Collections relate to university development and initiatives, departmental activities, student life, and university publications such as ''[[The South End]]''. University-affiliated organizations, including the Merrill-Palmer Institute, have placed their collections in the University Archives.&lt;ref&gt;''Walter P. Reuther Library: Archives of Labor and Urban Affairs, University Archives''. Detroit: Walter P. Reuther Library, 2008.

'''Youth-led media''' is any effort created, planned, implemented, and reflected upon by young people in the form of [[Mass media|media]], including websites, newspapers, television shows and publications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freechild.org/youthmedia.htm Youth Media Info Center] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050907235833/http://www.freechild.org/youthmedia.htm |date=September 7, 2005 }}, [[Freechild Project]]. Retrieved 11/2/08.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caudhurī, A. (2003) ''Media in Times of Crisis: National and International Issues''. Shraban Prokashoni.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF. (2005) ''Voices of Hope: Adolescents and the Tsunami''. United Nations Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movement==
These efforts form the basis of an international movement born in the early 1970s in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], [[United States|U.S.]] by the publishing arm of a [[left-wing]], teen-led organization called [[Youth Liberation of Ann Arbor]], which existed from 1970 to 1980. One of its founders went on to form the New York City-based Youth Communication, a youth-led media program for young people in foster care. Another organization in the early movement was [[Children's Express]], which operates programs around the world.

In the early 1990s this movement gained new expression in the United States in response to growing [[media bias]] against youth, i.e. the hyper-sensationalization of youth violence ala "[[superpredators (criminal)|superpredators]]", and continued to grow due to the "Columbine" shootings. The first online, teen-written newspaper, [http://readthetattoo.com/ The Tattoo], began in 1994 with a promise of giving voice to teens. This movement features hundreds of individuals and organizations working across the United States to promote the roles of young people in society and in the media.&lt;ref&gt;Coryat, D. (n.d.) "Challenging the silences and omissions of dominant media: Youth-led media collectives in Colombia," Youth Media Reporter. Retrieved 11/2/08.&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrating the wide reach of youth-led media a program in [[Oakland, California]] called [[Youth Radio]] has been featured across national media outlets in the U.S., including NPR and PBS. Other examples include the [[Blunt Youth Radio Project]], which provides an hour-long, weekly, youth-produced public affairs radio show on [[WMPG]] in [[Portland, Maine]].

'''Yuracaré''' (also called Yurujare, Yurucare) are [[South America]]n [[indigenous people]] living on 2,500 square kilometres along the [[Chapare River]] watershed in [[Cochabamba Department]] and [[Beni Department]], in the [[Bolivia]]n Lowlands of the [[Amazon Basin]]. The Yuracaré reside not far from [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]] and [[Cochabamba]], among the forests and plains near the [[Andes]]. They are among the residents of the Yuracaré Native Community Land (TCO), the Yuqui TCO, the [[Isiboro Sécure National Park and Indigenous Territory]], the Chiman Indigenous Territory, and the Multiethnic Indigenous Territory I.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Yurakaré - People &amp; Culture | work = Documentation of Endangered Languages | format = Team_document | accessdate = 2011-07-13 | url = http://www.mpi.nl/DOBES/projects/yurakare/people }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Yuracare language]] is a [[language isolate]], and is believed to be spoken in [[Bolivia]] by between 500 and 2,500 people. There are about 400 families in the Cochabamba Department and 62 Yuracare households in the [[Beni Department]]. The Yuracaré, who are one of approximately 35 Bolivian indigenous groups, traditionally bury their dead along with their bow and arrows, as it is a belief that the dead go to a place underground where game is plentiful.

{{Unreferenced Section|date=May 2013}}
[[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]]'s [[International Forestry Resources and Institutions|IFRI]], along with the Center for the Study of Economic and Social Reality (CERES), has done research among the Yuracaré regarding the way the Yuracaré manage their forests. The organization helped the Yuracaré develop a forest management plan and receive official land titles to their territory by 1996, and in 1998 the Bolivian government officially approved the management plan. This was the first time in Bolivian history that an indigenous group was granted concessionary forest management rights. Further, the IFRI said that the natives' forest management practices increase the amount and size of fruiting trees. The Yuracaré find it important to maintain the forest because certain trees bear the fruit that is necessary in attracting the game that they hunt and of which they live off.

Like other indigenous groups in Bolivia, the Yuracaré have faced major problems stemming from cultural issues in recent years. Some background: Bolivia is South America's poorest nation, and the native populations there are the most financially deprived of all. Having remained isolated over the years, authentic native traditions have still survived, while evolving under Catholic (in this case, the [[Jesuits]] of Paraguayan [[Jesuit Reductions|Reductions]]) and Spanish influences. The proliferation of the Spanish language has led to disconnect and even friction between native tongues and Spanish-speakers. [[Globalization]] has been a major issue, as the Yuracaré have rejected privatization that has been implemented with encouragement from the U.S., to some amount of success.
