[[Image:NVC cover 1.jpg|thumb|right|''British Plant Communities Volume 1'']]
'''''British Plant Communities''''' is a five-volume work, edited by [[John S. Rodwell]] and published by [[Cambridge University Press]], which describes the [[plant communities]] which comprise the [[British National Vegetation Classification]].

Its coverage includes all native vegetation communities and some artificial ones of [[Great Britain]], excluding [[Northern Ireland]].  The series is a major contribution to plant conservation in Great Britain, and, as such, covers material appropriate for professionals and amateurs interested in the conservation of native plant communities.  Each book begins with an introduction to the techniques used to survey the particular vegetations within its scope,  discussing sampling, the type of data collected, organization of the data, and analysing the data.  Each community is discussed with an overall emphasis of the ecology of the community, so that users can consider the relationships of various plant communities to each other as a function of climatic or soil conditions, for example.

The five volumes are:

* ''British Plant Communities Volume 1 – Woodlands and Scrub''
:This volume was first published in 1991 in hardback ({{ISBN|0-521-23558-8}}) and in 1998 in paperback ({{ISBN|0-521-62721-4}})

* ''British Plant Communities Volume 2 – Mires and Heaths''
:This volume was first published in 1991 in hardback ({{ISBN|0-521-39165-2}}) and in 1998 in paperback ({{ISBN|0-521-62720-6}})

* ''British Plant Communities Volume 3 – Grasslands and Montane Communities''
:This volume was first published in 1992 in hardback ({{ISBN|0-521-39166-0}}) and in 1998 in paperback ({{ISBN|0-521-62719-2}})

* ''British Plant Communities Volume 4 – Aquatic Communities, Swamps and Tall-herb Fens''
:This volume was first published in 1995 in hardback ({{ISBN|0-521-39168-7}}) and in 1998 in paperback ({{ISBN|0-521-62718-4}})

* ''British Plant Communities Volume 5 – Maritime Communities and Vegetation of Open Habitats''
:This volume was first published in 2000 in both hardback ({{ISBN|0-521-39167-9}}) and paperback ({{ISBN|0-521-64476-3}})

== Errors ==

The following is a list of errors found in the published books:

* In Volume 1, on page 38–39, the branches leading from couplets 22 and 23 should read W12, not W14
* In volume 3, on page 117, the first branch in couplet 3 should lead to couplet 4, to enable the subcommunities of [[British NVC community CG3|CG3]] to be discerned
* In volume 3, page 284, the ''Juncus trifidus – Racomitrium lanuginosum'' community is referred to as community [[British NVC community U11|U11]], whereas it is in fact community [[British NVC community U9|U9]].
* In volume 4, page 19, the "free-floating or rooted and submerged pondweed vegetation" group of aquatic communities is listed as having seven constituent communities, when in fact it has eight.
* In volume 5, page 20, the "middle saltmarsh" grouping is listed as having eight constituent communities, when in fact it has nine.
* In volume 5, pages 142–143, there is a discrepancy between the stated distribution of community [[British NVC community SD3|SD3]] ("confined to Scotland") and the mapped distribution, which shows the community also occurring in Lancashire and Cumbria.
* In volume 5, page 482, ''Sedum anglicum'' is listed as a constituent species of community [[British NVC community OV33|OV33]]; however, it is not present in the floristic table for this community on page 437

==History==

The history of CMMB (known as a committee of the [[Catholic Health Association of the United States|Catholic Hospital Association]] until 1927) dates back to 1912, when a personal tragedy inspired CMMB’s founder Dr. Paluel J. Flagg to commit to medical [[missionary]] work, beginning with [[leprosy]] patients in Haiti.&lt;ref name="Flagg"/&gt;

For many decades, CMMB prioritized the shipping of medical supplies and equipment to missionaries and health partners around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Edward F. Garesche, [http://epublications.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1052&amp;context=lnq The Catholic Medical Mission Board and its Work], ''The Linacre Quarterly'', Volume 2, Number 4. September 1934&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, [[Fulton J. Sheen|Bishop Fulton J. Sheen]], television personality and national director of the [[Society of the Propagation of the Faith]], joined CMMB’s board and served for 26 years.&lt;ref name="Flagg"/&gt; Another stalwart supporter of CMMB has been the surgeon [[Tom Catena]].&lt;ref&gt;Alex Perry, [http://world.time.com/2012/04/25/alone-and-forgotten-one-american-doctor-saves-lives-in-sudans-nuba-mountains/ Alone and Forgotten, One American Doctor Saves Lives in Sudan’s Nuba Mountains], ''Time''.

In 2002, CMMB introduced ''Born To Live'',&lt;ref name="Born To live"&gt;Georgetown University, Berkley Center, [http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/publications/first-nationwide-faith-based-initiative-to-fight-mother-to-child-transmission-of-hiv-launched-in-kenya First Nationwide Faith-based Initiative to Fight Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV Launched in Kenya]. October 14, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; a program designed for the prevention of  [[Unite for Children, Unite Against AIDS#Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT)|mother-to-child (PMTCT) transmission of HIV]] which affected nearly 60,000 women in Haiti, Kenya and South Sudan.
 
In 2003, CMMB launched ''Action for Family Health'' to help reduce the mortality and morbidity rates of children in five Central American and Caribbean countries, through a partnership with the [[Pan American Health Organization]] (PAHO), Catholic healthcare networks, and the respective Ministries of Health in each country,&lt;ref name="Berkley" /&gt; providing [[deworming]] medicines to children.&lt;ref&gt;PAHO, [http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_view&amp;gid=13723&amp;Itemid=4031 "A Call to Action: Addressing Soil-transmitted Helminths in Latin America &amp; the Caribbean"]. Retrieved on 06/22/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, CMMB supported international and local partners in response to the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|tsunami disaster]], committing US$3.1 million in health aid to survivors in India, [[Indonesia]], and [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;Claudia McDonnel, [http://cny.org/stories/Tsunami-Aid,2702?content_source=&amp;category_id=&amp;search_filter=&amp;event_mode=&amp;event_ts_from=&amp;list_type=&amp;order_by=&amp;order_sort=&amp;content_class=&amp;sub_type=stories&amp;town_id "Tsunami Aid"].

CMMB became a member of the AIDS Relief consortium in response to [[George W. Bush|President Bush]]'s [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief|Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]].&lt;ref name="PEPFAR" /&gt;

In 2010, CMMB provided over US$49 million and over 500 tons of pharmaceutical and medical supplies worth US$46.7 million to Haiti for [[Humanitarian response by non-governmental organizations to the 2010 Haiti earthquake|earthquake relief]] through its local partners,&lt;ref name="FADICA"&gt;FADICA, [http://www.fadica.org/main/CatholicCompass/tabid/123/ctl/ArticleView/mid/454/articleId/39/Y-and-H-Soda-Foundation-and-Catholic-Medical-Mission-Board-Welcomed-to-FADICA-Membership.aspx Y and H Soda Foundation and Catholic Medical Mission Board Welcomed to FADICA Membership].

[[Carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}) is an important [[trace gas]] in [[atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]. It is an integral part of the [[carbon cycle]], a biogeochemical cycle in which [[carbon]] is exchanged between the Earth's [[oceans]], soil, rocks and the [[biosphere]]. [[Plant]]s and other [[photoautotroph]]s use solar energy to produce carbohydrate from atmospheric carbon dioxide and water by [[photosynthesis]]. Almost all other organisms depend on carbohydrate derived from photosynthesis as their primary source of energy and carbon compounds.  {{CO2}} absorbs and emits [[infrared]] radiation at [[wavelength]]s of 4.26 [[µm]] (asymmetric stretching [[Infrared spectroscopy|vibrational mode]]) and 14.99&amp;nbsp;µm (bending vibrational mode) and consequently is a [[greenhouse gas]] that plays a vital role in regulating [[Earth]]'s surface temperature through the [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Petty|first1=G.W. |title=A First Course in Atmospheric Radiation |publisher=Sundog Publishing |year=2004 |pages=229–51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concentrations of {{CO2}} in the atmosphere were as high as 4,000  [[parts per million]] (ppm) during the [[Cambrian|Cambrian period ]] about 500 million years ago to as low as 180 ppm during the [[Quaternary glaciation]] of the last two million years.&lt;ref name="Cambridge2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eggleton|first1=Tony|title=A Short Introduction to Climate Change|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jeSwRly2M_cC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates based on reconstructed temperature records suggests that the amount of {{CO2}} during the last 420 million years ago was with ~2000 ppm highest during the [[Devonian]] (∼400 Myrs ago) and [[Triassic]] (220–200 Myrs ago), with a few maximum estimates ranging up to ∼3,700±1,600 ppm (215 Myrs ago).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Nature Communications |year=2017 |vauthors=Foster GL, Royer DL, Lunt DJ |title=Future climate forcing potentially without precedent in the last 420 million years |doi=10.1038/ncomms14845 |volume=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Global annual mean {{CO2}} concentration has increased by more than 45% since the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]], from 280 ppm during the 10,000 years up to the mid-18th century&lt;ref name="Cambridge2013"/&gt; to 410 ppm as of mid-2018.&lt;ref name=ESRLtrends&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/ |title=Trends in Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide |website=Earth System Research Laboratory |publisher=[[NOAA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NOAA_CO2annual"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dlugokencky |first1=E. |date=5 February 2016 | accessdate=12 February 2016 |url=ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/products/trends/co2/co2_annmean_gl.txt |website=Earth System Research Laboratory |publisher=[[NOAA]]| title=Annual Mean Carbon Dioxide Data}}&lt;/ref&gt; The present concentration is the highest in the last 800,000&lt;ref name="deep ice"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5314592.stm | work=BBC News | title=Deep ice tells long climate story | date=4 September 2006 | accessdate=28 April 2010 | first1=J.| last1=Amos}}&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly even the last 20 million years.&lt;ref name="Grida"&gt;[https://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg1/pdf/WG1_TAR-FRONT.PDF Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The increase has been caused by [[Anthropogenic greenhouse gases|human activities]], particularly the burning of [[fossil fuels]] and [[deforestation]].&lt;ref name="Etheridge1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Etheridge |first=D.M. |author2=L.P.

The second atmosphere, consisting largely of [[nitrogen]] and [[carbon dioxide]] was produced by outgassing from [[volcanism]], supplemented by gases produced during the [[late heavy bombardment]] of Earth by huge [[asteroids]].&lt;ref name=Zahnle&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Zahnle |first1= K. |last2= Schaefer |first2= L. |last3= Fegley |first3= B. |doi= 10.1101/cshperspect.a004895 |title= Earth's Earliest Atmospheres |journal= Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology |volume= 2 |issue= 10 |pages= a004895 |year= 2010 |pmid= 20573713 |pmc= 2944365}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major part of carbon dioxide emissions were soon dissolved in water and built up carbonate sediments. 

The production of free oxygen by [[cyanobacteria]]l photosynthesis eventually led to the [[Great Oxygenation Event|oxygen catastrophe]] that ended Earth's second atmosphere and brought about the Earth's third atmosphere (the modern atmosphere) 2.4 billion years before the present. Carbon dioxide concentrations dropped from 4,000 parts per million during the [[Cambrian|Cambrian period ]] about 500 million years ago to as low as 180 parts per million during the [[Quaternary glaciation]] of the last two million years.&lt;ref name="Cambridge2013"/&gt;&lt;!-- It is unclear if this figure is based on modeled data, or reconstructions. --&gt;

===Drivers of ancient-Earth carbon dioxide concentration===
{{See also|Biogeochemical cycle}}
On long timescales, atmospheric {{CO2}} concentration is determined by the balance among [[Geochemical cycle|geochemical processes]] including organic carbon burial in sediments, silicate rock [[weathering]], and [[volcanism]]. The net effect of slight imbalances in the [[carbon cycle]] over tens to hundreds of millions of years has been to reduce atmospheric {{CO2}}. On a timescale of billions of years, such downward trend appears bound to continue indefinitely as occasional massive historical releases of buried carbon due to volcanism will become less frequent (as earth mantle cooling and progressive exhaustion of  [[Geothermal gradient|internal radioactive heat]] proceed further). The rates of these processes are extremely slow; hence they are of no relevance to the atmospheric {{CO2}} concentration over the next hundreds or thousands of years.

In billion-year timescales, it is [[Future of the Earth|predicted]] that plant, and therefore animal, life on land will die off altogether, since by that time most of the remaining carbon in the atmosphere will be sequestered underground, and natural releases of {{CO2}} by radioactivity-driven tectonic activity will have continued to slow down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ward |first1=Peter D. |last2=Brownlee |first2=Donald |title=The life and death of planet Earth |publisher=Macmillan |year=2003 |isbn=0-8050-7512-7 |pages=117–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of plant life would also result in the eventual loss of oxygen. Some microbes are capable of photosynthesis at concentrations of {{CO2}} of a few parts per million and so the last life forms would probably disappear finally due to the rising temperatures and loss of the atmosphere when the [[Sun#Earth's fate|sun]] becomes a red giant some four billion years from now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Caldeira |first1=Ken |last2=Kasting |first2=James F. |title=The life span of the biosphere revisited |journal=Nature |volume=360 |issue=6406 |pages=721–23 |date=December 1992 |bibcode=1992Natur.360..721C |doi=10.1038/360721a0 |pmid=11536510 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most direct method for measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations for periods before instrumental sampling is to measure bubbles of air ([[fluid inclusions|fluid or gas inclusions]]) trapped in the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] or [[Greenland]] ice sheets. The most widely accepted of such studies come from a variety of Antarctic cores and indicate that atmospheric {{CO2}} concentrations were about 260–280 ppmv immediately before industrial emissions began and did not vary much from this level during the preceding 10,000 [[annum|years]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=June 1998|first1=D.M. |last1=Etheridge|first2=L.P.|last2= Steele|first3= R.L.|last3= Langenfelds|first4=  R.J.|last4= Francey|first5=JM|last5=Barnola|first6=VI|last6=Morgan| title=Historical {{CO2}} record derived from a spline fit (20 year cutoff) of the Law Dome DE08 and DE08-2 ice cores | url=http://cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/trends/co2/lawdome.smoothed.yr20 | accessdate=2007-06-12|website=Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center|publisher=[[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The longest [[ice core]] record comes from East Antarctica, where ice has been sampled to an age of 800,000 years.&lt;ref name="deep ice"/&gt; During this time, the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration has varied between 180–210 ppm during [[ice age]]s, increasing to 280–300 ppm during warmer [[interglacial]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hileman B. |title=Ice Core Record Extended: Analyses of trapped air show current {{CO2}} at highest level in 650,000 years |journal=[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]] |volume=83 |issue=48 |pages=7 |date=November 2005 |url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/83/i48/8348notw1.html |issn=0009-2347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/icecore/antarctica/vostok/vostok_data.html Vostok Ice Core Data], [http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov ncdc.noaa.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of human agriculture during the current [[Holocene]] epoch may have been strongly connected to the atmospheric {{CO2}} increase after the last ice age ended, a [[CO2 fertilization effect|fertilization effect]] raising plant biomass growth and reducing [[stoma]]tal conductance requirements for {{CO2}} intake, consequently reducing transpiration water losses and increasing water usage efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Richerson P.J. |author2=Boyd R. |author3=Bettinger R.L. |title=Was Agriculture Impossible During The Pleistocene But Mandatory During The Holocene? |journal=American Antiquity |volume=66 |issue=3 |pages=387–411 |jstor=2694241 |date=July 2001 |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/boyd/AgOrigins.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.2307/2694241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When dust concentrations in Greenland cores are low, as they nearly always are in Antarctic cores, the researchers report good agreement between measurements of Antarctic and Greenland {{CO2}} concentrations.

[[File:The green house effect.svg|thumb|A pictogram of the greenhouse effect]]

Earth’s natural [[greenhouse effect]] makes life as we know it possible and carbon dioxide plays a significant role in providing for the relatively warm temperature that the planet enjoys. The greenhouse effect is a process by which thermal radiation from a planetary atmosphere warms the planet's surface beyond the temperature it would have in the absence of its atmosphere.&lt;ref name="ipccar4syr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/annexessglossary-e-i.html|title=Annex II Glossary|publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ipcc-AR4WG1"&gt;A concise description of the greenhouse effect is given in the ''Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report,'' "What is the Greenhouse Effect?"

Carbon dioxide is believed to have played an important effect in regulating Earth's temperature throughout its 4.7 billion year history. Early in the Earth's life, scientists have found evidence of liquid water indicating a warm world even though the Sun's output is believed to have only been 70% of what it is today. It has been suggested by scientists that higher carbon dioxide concentrations in the early Earth's atmosphere might help explain this [[faint young sun paradox]]. When Earth first formed, [[Earth's atmosphere]] may have contained more greenhouse gases and {{CO2}} concentrations may have been higher, with estimated [[partial pressure]] as large as {{convert|1000|kPa|bar|abbr=on|lk=on}}, because there was no bacterial [[photosynthesis]] to [[redox|reduce]] the gas to carbon compounds and oxygen. [[Methane]], a very active greenhouse gas which reacts with oxygen to produce {{CO2}} and water vapor, may have been more prevalent as well, with a mixing ratio of 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; (100 [[parts per million]] by volume).&lt;ref name = "Walker"&gt;{{cite journal

Though water is responsible for most (about 36-70%) of the total greenhouse effect, the [[Greenhouse gas#Role of water vapor|role of water vapor]] as a greenhouse gas depends on temperature. On Earth, carbon dioxide is the most relevant, direct anthropologically influenced greenhouse gas. Carbon dioxide is often mentioned in the context of its increased influence as a greenhouse gas since the pre-industrial (1750) era. In the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] the increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was estimated to be responsible for 1.82 W·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the 2.63 W·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; change in radiative forcing on Earth (about 70%).&lt;ref&gt;IPCC Fifth Assessment Report – Chapter 8: Anthropogenic and Natural Radiative Forcing. https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter08_FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Atmospheric carbon dioxide and the carbon cycle==
{{main | Carbon cycle| Atmospheric carbon cycle}}
[[File:Carbon cycle.jpg|thumb|left|This diagram of the fast carbon cycle shows the movement of carbon between land, atmosphere, and oceans in billions of tons of carbon per year. Yellow numbers are natural fluxes, red are human contributions in billions of tons of carbon per year. White numbers indicate stored carbon.]]
Atmospheric carbon dioxide plays an integral role in the Earth's carbon cycle whereby carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere by some natural processes such as [[photosynthesis]] and deposition of carbonates, to form limestones for example, and added back to the atmosphere by other natural processes such as [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] and the acid dissolution of carbonate deposits. There are two broad carbon cycles on Earth: the fast carbon cycle and the slow carbon cycle. The fast carbon cycle refers to movements of carbon between the environment and living things in the biosphere whereas the slow carbon cycle involves the movement of carbon between the atmosphere, oceans, soil, rocks, and volcanism. Both carbon cycles are intrinsically interconnected and atmospheric gaseous carbon dioxide facilitates the carbon cycle.

Natural sources of atmospheric carbon dioxide include [[volcanic]] [[outgassing]], the [[combustion]] of [[organic compound|organic matter]], [[wildfires]] and the [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] processes of living [[aerobic organism]]s. Man-made sources of carbon dioxide include the burning of [[fossil fuels]] for heating, [[electricity generation|power generation]] and [[transport]], as well as some industrial processes such as cement making. It is also produced by various [[microorganism]]s from [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] and [[cellular respiration]]. [[Plant]]s, [[algae]] and [[cyanobacteria]] convert carbon dioxide to [[carbohydrate]]s by a process called [[photosynthesis]]. They gain the energy needed for this reaction from absorption of sunlight by [[chlorophyll]] and other pigments. Oxygen, produced as a by-product of photosynthesis, is released into the atmosphere and subsequently used for respiration by [[heterotrophic]] organisms and other plants, forming a [[carbon cycle|cycle]].

Most sources of {{CO2}} emissions are natural, and are balanced to various degrees by natural {{CO2}} sinks. For example, the natural decay of organic material in forests and grasslands and the action of forest fires results in the release of about 439 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide every year, while new growth entirely counteracts this effect, absorbing 450 gigatonnes per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IPCC Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007 (AR4)|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_and_data_reports.shtml#.T_EtQZFuqSo|publisher=[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]|accessdate=2013-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the initial carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of the young Earth was produced by [[volcano|volcanic activity]], modern volcanic activity releases only 130 to 230 [[tonne|megatonnes]] of carbon dioxide each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gerlach, T.M. |title=Present-day {{CO2}} emissions from volcanoes |journal=[[Eos (journal)|Eos, Transactions, American Geophysical Union]] |volume=72 |issue=23 |pages=249, 254–55 |date=4 June 1991 |publisher=American Geophysical Union |doi=10.1029/90EO10192 |bibcode=1991EOSTr..72..249.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These natural sources are nearly balanced by natural sinks, physical and biological processes which remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. For example, some is directly removed from the atmosphere by land plants for [[photosynthesis]] and it is soluble in water forming [[carbonic acid]]. There is a large natural flux of {{CO2}} into and out of the [[biosphere]] and oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cappelluti, G. |author2=Bösch, H. |author3=Monks, P.S. |title=Use of remote sensing techniques for the detection and monitoring of GHG emissions from the Scottish land use sector |publisher=Scottish Government |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-7559-7738-3 |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/12/15084401/0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the pre-industrial era these fluxes were largely in balance.

Carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere is essential to life and to the present planetary biosphere. Over the course of Earth's geologic history {{CO2}} concentrations have played a role in biological evolution. The first photosynthetic organisms probably [[evolution|evolved]] early in the [[evolutionary history of life]] and most likely used [[reducing agent]]s such as [[hydrogen]] or [[hydrogen sulfide]] as sources of electrons, rather than water.&lt;ref name="pmid16453059"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Olson JM | title = Photosynthesis in the Archean era | journal = Photosyn.

Photosynthetic organisms are [[photoautotroph]]s, which means that they are able to [[Chemical synthesis|synthesize]] food directly from {{CO2}} and water using energy from light. However, not all organisms that use light as a source of energy carry out photosynthesis, since ''[[photoheterotroph]]s'' use organic compounds, rather than {{CO2}}, as a source of carbon.&lt;ref name=bryantfrigaard&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bryant DA, Frigaard NU | title = Prokaryotic photosynthesis and phototrophy illuminated | journal = Trends Microbiol. | volume = 14 | issue = 11 | pages = 488–96 |date=November 2006 | pmid = 16997562 | doi = 10.1016/j.tim.2006.09.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In plants, algae and cyanobacteria, photosynthesis releases oxygen. This is called ''oxygenic photosynthesis''. Although there are some differences between oxygenic photosynthesis in [[plants]], [[algae]], and [[cyanobacteria]], the overall process is quite similar in these organisms. However, there are some types of bacteria that carry out [[anoxygenic photosynthesis]], which consumes {{CO2}} but does not release oxygen.

Carbon dioxide is converted into sugars in a process called [[carbon fixation]]. Carbon fixation is an [[endothermic]] [[redox]] reaction, so photosynthesis needs to supply both the source of energy to drive this process and the electrons needed to convert {{CO2}} into a [[carbohydrate]]. This addition of the electrons is a [[Reduction (chemistry)|reduction reaction]]. In general outline and in effect, photosynthesis is the opposite of [[cellular respiration]], in which glucose and other compounds are oxidized to produce {{CO2}} and water, and to release [[exothermic]] chemical energy to drive the organism's [[metabolism]]. However, the two processes take place through a different sequence of chemical reactions and in different cellular compartments.

Most organisms that utilize photosynthesis to produce oxygen use [[Visible spectrum|visible light]] to do so, although at least three use shortwave [[infrared]] or, more specifically, far-red radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Scientists discover unique microbe in California's largest lake | url = http://www.bio-medicine.org/biology-news/Scientists-discover-unique-microbe-in-Californias-largest-lake-203-1/ | accessdate = 2009-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of increased {{co2}} on plants and crops===
A 1993 review of scientific greenhouse studies found that a doubling of {{CO2}} concentration would stimulate the growth of 156 different plant species by an average of 37%. Response varied significantly by species, with some showing much greater gains and a few showing a loss. For example, a 1979 greenhouse study found that with doubled {{CO2}} concentration the dry weight of 40-day-old cotton plants doubled, but the dry weight of 30-day-old maize plants increased by only 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.science.poorter.eu/1993_poorter_vegetatio.pdf|title=Interspecific variation in the growth response of plants to an elevated ambient CO2 concentration|author=Poorter, Hendrik}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00346400#page-2|title=Elevated Partial Pressure of CO2 and Plant Growth|author=Wong, S.C. | doi=10.1007/BF00346400|bibcode=1979Oecol..44...68W|volume=44|journal=Oecologia|pages=68–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to greenhouse studies, field and satellite measurements attempt to understand the effect of increased {{co2}} in more natural environments. In [[Free-air concentration enrichment|free-air carbon dioxide enrichment]] (FACE) experiments plants are grown in field plots and the {{CO2}} concentration of the surrounding air is artificially elevated. These experiments generally use lower {{CO2}} levels than the greenhouse studies.  They show lower gains in growth than greenhouse studies, with the gains depending heavily on the species under study. A 2005 review of 12 experiments at 475-600 ppm showed an average gain of 17% in crop yield, with [[legumes]] typically showing a greater response than other species and [[C4 carbon fixation|C4 plants]] generally showing less. The review also stated that the experiments have their own limitations. The studied {{CO2}} levels were lower, and most of the experiments were carried out in temperate regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=What have we learned from 15 years of free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE)?

A 2017 article states that increased {{CO2}} levels have a negative impact on the nutritional quality of various human [[Crop|food crops]], by increasing the levels of [[carbohydrate]]s, such as [[glucose]], while decreasing the levels of important nutrients such as [[Protein (nutrient)|protein]], [[iron]], and [[Zinc deficiency|zinc]].

===Atmospheric carbon dioxide and the oceanic carbon cycle===
{{main | Oceanic carbon cycle}}
{{see also|Solubility pump|Ocean acidification}}
[[File:CO2 pump hg.svg|thumb|Air-sea exchange of {{CO2}}]]

The Earth's [[ocean]]s contain a large amount of {{CO2}} in the form of bicarbonate and carbonate ions — much more than the amount in the atmosphere. The bicarbonate is produced in reactions between rock, water, and carbon dioxide. One example is the dissolution of calcium carbonate:

:{{chem|CaCO|3}} + {{CO2}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} ⇌ {{chem|Ca|2+}} + 2 {{chem|HCO|3|-}}

Reactions like this tend to buffer changes in atmospheric {{CO2}}. Since the right side of the reaction produces an acidic compound, adding {{CO2}} on the left side decreases the [[pH]] of seawater, a process which has been termed [[ocean acidification]] (pH of the ocean becomes more acidic although the pH value remains in the alkaline range). Reactions between {{CO2}} and non-carbonate rocks also add bicarbonate to the seas. This can later undergo the reverse of the above reaction to form carbonate rocks, releasing half of the bicarbonate as {{CO2}}. Over hundreds of millions of years, this has produced huge quantities of carbonate rocks.

Ultimately, most of the {{CO2}} emitted by human activities will dissolve in the ocean;&lt;ref name=arch05&gt;{{cite journal |author=Archer, D. |title=Fate of fossil fuel {{CO2}} in geologic time |journal=J. Geophys. Res. |volume=110 |year=2005 |doi=10.1029/2004JC002625 |bibcode=2005JGRC..11009S05A}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the rate at which the ocean will take it up in the future is less certain.
Even if equilibrium is reached, including dissolution of carbonate minerals, the increased concentration of bicarbonate and decreased or unchanged concentration of carbonate ion will give rise to a higher concentration of un-ionized carbonic acid and dissolved {{CO2}}. This, along with higher temperatures, would mean a higher equilibrium concentration of {{CO2}} in the air.

[[File:Global distribution of Carbon Dioxide.jpg|thumb|Carbon Dioxide observations from 2005 to 2014 showing the seasonal variations and the difference between northern and southern hemispheres]]
The first reproducibly accurate measurements of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were from flask sample measurements made by [[Charles David Keeling|Dave Keeling]] at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;The Early Keeling Curve, SIO. http://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/history_legacy/early_keeling_curve. Accessed March 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later in March 1958 the first ongoing measurements were started by Keeling at [[Mauna Loa]]. Measurements at Mauna Loa have been ongoing since then. Now measurements are made at many sites globally. Additional measurement techniques are also used as well. Many measurement sites are part of larger global networks. Global network data are often made publicly available on the conditions of proper acknowledgment according to the respective data user policies.

There are several surface measurement (including flasks and continuous in situ) networks including [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]/[[Earth System Research Laboratory|ERSL]],&lt;ref&gt;NOAA CCGG page http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/index.html Retrieved March 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; WDCGG,&lt;ref&gt;WDCGG webpage http://ds.data.jma.go.jp/gmd/wdcgg/ Retrieved March 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and RAMCES.&lt;ref&gt;RAMCES webpage http://www.lsce.ispl.fr/{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved March 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  The NOAA/ESRL Baseline Observatory Network, and the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] Network &lt;ref&gt;CDIAC CO2 page http://cdiac.ornl.gov/trends/co2/ Retrieved February 9, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; data are hosted at the [[Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center|CDIAC]] at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|ORNL]]. The World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases (WDCGG), part of [[Global Atmospheric Watch|GAW]], data are hosted by the [[Japan Meteorological Agency|JMA]]. The Reseau Atmospherique de Mesure des Composes an Effet de Serre database (RAMCES) is part of [[Institute Pierre Simon Laplace|IPSL]].

From these measurements, further products are made which integrate data from the various sources. These products also address issues such as data discontinuity and sparseness. GLOBALVIEW-CO2 is one of these products.&lt;ref&gt;GLOBALVIEW-CO2 information page. http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/globalview/co2/co2_intro.html. Retrieved February 9, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Ongoing ground-based total column measurements began more recently. Column measurements typically refer to an averaged column amount denoted X&lt;sub&gt;CO2&lt;/sub&gt;, rather than a surface only measurement. These measurements are made by the [[Total Carbon Column Observing Network|TCCON]]. These data are also hosted on the CDIAC, and made publicly available according to the data use policy.&lt;ref&gt;TCCON data use policy webpage https://tccon-wiki.caltech.edu/Network_Policy/Data_Use_Policy. Retrieved February 9, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Satellite measurements are also a recent addition to atmospheric X&lt;sub&gt;CO2&lt;/sub&gt; measurements. [[SCIAMACHY]] aboard [[European Space Agency|ESA's]] [[ENVISAT]] made global column X&lt;sub&gt;CO2&lt;/sub&gt; measurements from 2002-2012. [[Atmospheric Infrared Sounder|AIRS]] aboard NASA’s [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua satellite]] makes global X&lt;sub&gt;CO2&lt;/sub&gt; measurements and was launched shortly after ENVISAT in 2012. More recent satellites have significantly improved the data density and precision of global measurements. Newer missions have higher spectral and spatial resolutions. [[JAXA|JAXA's]] [[Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite|GOSAT]] was the first dedicated GHG monitoring satellite to successfully achieve orbit in 2009. NASA's [[Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2|OCO-2]] launched in 2014 was the second. Various other satellites missions to measure atmospheric X&lt;sub&gt;CO2&lt;/sub&gt; are planned.

'''Cirrocumulus lacunosus''' is a type of [[cirrocumulus cloud]]. The name ''cirrocumulus lacunosus'' is derived from [[Latin]], meaning "full of hollows".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of stratus |url=http://latinlexicon.org/definition.php?p1=1008985 |accessdate=21 July 2011 |author=Numen - The Latin Lexicon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cirrocumulus lacunosus is a relatively rare cloud form that occurs as a layer of cloud with circular holes in it. Formation is commonly attributed to a cool layer mixing with a warmer, higher layer of the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;http://epod.usra.edu/blog/2017/07/cirrostratus-lacunosus-cloud.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dunlop |first=Storm |title=The weather identification handbook |year=2003 |publisher=Lyons Press |location=Guilford, Conn. |isbn=1-58574-857-9 |pages=67 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BR2ft4G5TgQC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PA67#v=onepage&amp;q=cirrocumulus%20lacunosus&amp;f=false |edition=1st Lyons Press |accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These holes normally have frayed edges, and they are often arranged in a manner that resembles a net or a honeycomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Callanan |first=Martin |title=Cirrocumulus lacunosus |url=http://nephology.eu/cirrocumulus/cirrocumulus-lacunosus |work=International Cloud Atlas |publisher=nephology.eu |accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clear Creek State Park''' is a {{convert|1211.19|acre|adj=on}} [[List of Pennsylvania state parks|Pennsylvania state park]] in [[Barnett Township, Jefferson County, Pennsylvania|Barnett]] and [[Heath Township, Jefferson County, Pennsylvania|Heath Townships]], [[Jefferson County, Pennsylvania|Jefferson County]], [[Pennsylvania]] in the United States. Public campsites were first opened at the park in 1922. Many of the facilities seen today at the park were constructed during the [[Great Depression]] by the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]]. Clear Creek State Park is {{convert|12|mi}} from [[Brookville, Pennsylvania|Brookville]] on [[Pennsylvania Route 949]] at the [[confluence (geography)|confluence]] of [[Clear Creek (Pennsylvania)|Clear Creek]] and the [[Clarion River]].

==Recreation==
Clear Creek State Park is open to many recreational opportunities. There are {{convert|25|mi}} of [[hiking]] trails that run through the park and into [[Clear Creek State Forest]]. One such trail leads to Bear Town Rocks, a group of large boulders in the middle of the forest, from the top of which one can get a scenic view of the surrounding area. The park has extensive [[picnic]] facilities and is open to [[hunting]] and [[fishing]] and serves as a launch point for canoeing on the Clarion River.&lt;ref name="clearcreeksp"/&gt;

About {{convert|1200|acre}} of Clear Creek State Park are open to hunting. Hunters may park at the park to gain access to the surrounding Kitanning State Forest. Common game species are [[white-tailed deer]], [[American black bear|black bear]], [[wild turkey|turkey]], and [[eastern gray squirrel|squirrel]]s. The hunting of [[groundhog]]s is prohibited. All hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the [[Pennsylvania Game Commission]].&lt;ref name="clearcreeksp"/&gt;

Clear Creek has a native and [[fish stocking|stocked]] population of [[brook trout]]. The Clarion River also has some trout, [[panfish]] and [[smallmouth bass]]. Some of the small [[Tributary|tributaries]] of Clear Creek and the Clarion River are also stocked with trout by the [[Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission]].&lt;ref name="clearcreeksp"/&gt;

The [[Clarion River]] is a popular destination for canoeing enthusiasts. They commonly launch their [[canoe]]s at Clear Creek State Park for the 4 and a half hour trip ({{convert|10|mi}}) to [[Cook Forest State Park]]. Canoes are available to rent from various [[outfitter]]s in the area.&lt;ref name="clearcreeksp"/&gt;

==Accommodations==
[[Cottage#Cottages in Canada and the U.S.|Cabin]]s and [[Mongolia]]n style [[yurt]]s are available for rent to visitors interested in spending more than a day at Clear Creek State Park. Twenty-two rustic cabins built by the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] can be rented on a weekly basis beginning with the opening of [[trout]] season in April and ending at the conclusion of [[deer]] season in December. The cabins are heated with either a wood stove or a [[propane]] heater. The two yurts have electric heat. Both the cabins and yurts have minimal accommodations. Single bunk beds, tables, chairs, an electric range, refrigerator and lights are provided. There is a centrally located shower area with frost free water spigots for drinking water.&lt;ref name="clearcreeksp"&gt;{{cite web | url = 
http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/findapark/clearcreek/index.htm| title = Clear Creek State Park
| accessdate = 2006-12-21
| publisher = [[Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[campground]] opens and closes with the cabins and yurts. Fifty-three trailer and tent sites are available for use. The rustic campground is located in the woods with [[outhouse]]s and a sanitary dump station. There is a 9-hole [[disc golf]] course and a concrete [[basketball court]] next to the campground.&lt;ref name="clearcreeksp"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3920">'''Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority''' ('''EECA''') is a [[New Zealand]] government/Crown agency responsible for promoting energy efficiency and conservation. 

The EECA was set up by the [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand]] in 1992 to encourage, support and promote energy efficiency, energy conservation, and the use of renewable sources of energy. The EECA, by promoting energy efficiency, helps to reduce climate change and GHG emissions through energy efficiency measures.

==History==
In 2000 EECA became a Crown entity, established under the [[Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act 2000]]. It is subject to the Crown Entities Act 2004.

The passing of the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act meant that for the first time, New Zealand had a legislative basis for promoting energy efficiency, energy conservation, and renewable energy.

The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority is responsible for preparing a national energy efficiency and conservation strategy for approval by the administering Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2000/0014/latest/DLM54984.html |title=Section 13. Preparation of draft strategy |work=Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act 2000 No 14  |publisher=New Zealand Legislation (www.legislation.govt.nz) |accessdate=2010-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home grants==
In 2004, EECA launched the Energywise Home Grants Programme to provide insulation retrofits to low-income owners of homes built before 1978. That year, minimum insulation standards were introduced to the New Zealand building code, and the majority of homes built prior to this had no insulation at all. The Energywise Programme had a target of insulating 6000 homes.

In 2009 the New Zealand Government allocated an extra $247.7 million to EECA for home insulation grants. The programme was called Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart and insulated more than 235,000 homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2002/0009/latest/whole.html?search=ts_regulation_Energy+Efficiency_resel|title=Energy Efficiency (Energy Using Products) Regulations 2002 (SR 2002/9) (as at 21 October 2015) – New Zealand Legislation|website=www.legislation.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Government allocated $100 million of operating funding over three years to the Warm Up New Zealand: Healthy Homes programme, targeting low-income households for home insulation, particularly households occupied by children and/or the elderly.

==Leadership==
As at 2013 Tom Campbell is the chair of the EECA Board. The Chief Executive is Mike Underhill. The employees remuneration statement in the 2014 annual report reveals that he receives remuneration and benefits of over $280,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eeca.govt.nz/sites/all/files/eeca-annual-report-web-2013-2014.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115081137/http://www.eeca.govt.nz/sites/all/files/eeca-annual-report-web-2013-2014.pdf |archivedate=2015-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, the EECA said that they would retire the ''[[Energy Star]]'' label at the end of 2017, as it is becoming less relevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eeca.govt.nz/standards-ratings-and-labels/energy-star/|title=ENERGY STAR®|last=EECA|website=EECA|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/91744902/eeca-drops-energy-star-rating-for-appliances|title=EECA drops Energy Star rating for appliances|website=Stuff|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Energy performance certificates''' ('''EPCs''') are a [[Rating scale|rating]] scheme to summarise the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of buildings in the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-efficiency/buildings/certificates-and-inspections ''Certificates and inspections''], ec.europa.eu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| publisher = Buildings Performance Institute Europe (BPIE)| pages = 60| last1 = Arcipowska| first1 = Aleksandra| last2 = Anagnostopoulos| first2 = Filippos| last3 = Mariottini| first3 = Francesco| last4 = Kunkel| first4 = Sara| title = Energy performance certificates across the EU: Mapping of national approaches| accessdate = 2018-03-19| date = October 2014| url = http://bpie.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Energy-Performance-Certificates-EPC-across-the-EU.-A-mapping-of-national-approaches-2014.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislative history ==
EPCs were introduced in England and Wales on 1 August 2007 as part of [[Home Information Pack]]s (HIPs) for domestic properties with four or more bedrooms. Over time this requirement was extended to smaller properties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/34/part/5 The Housing Act 2004, Part 5], {{ISBN|0-10-543404-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the requirement for HIPs was removed in May 2010, the requirement for EPCs continued. The scheme for HIPs was extended to encompass three bedroom homes from 10 September 2007.  Rental properties, which have a certificate valid for 10 years, required on a new tenancy commencing on or after 1 October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/981475 |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120919132719/http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/981475 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-19 |title=Archived press release on Communities and Local Government website |publisher=Webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are a result of [[Directive on the energy performance of buildings|European Union Directive 2002/91/EC]] relating to the energy performance of buildings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:001:0065:0071:EN:PDF |title=Energy Performance of Buildings Directive 2002/91/EC |date= |accessdate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Transposition (law)|transposed into British law]] by the [[Housing Act 2004]] and The Energy Performance of Buildings (Certificates and Inspections) (England and Wales) Regulations 2007 (&lt;abbr title="Statutory Instrument"&gt;S.I.&lt;/abbr&gt; 2007/991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/991/contents/made |title=The Energy Performance of Buildings (Certificates and Inspections) (England and Wales) Regulations 2007 |date=23 March 2007 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
The energy survey needed to produce an EPC is performed by an assessor who visits the property, examines key items such as [[loft]] [[Building insulation|insulation]], domestic [[boiler]], [[hot water tank]], [[radiator]]s, [[window]]s for [[double glazing]], and so on. He or she then inputs the observations into a [[software]] [[Computer program|program]] which performs the calculation of [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]. The program gives a single number for the rating of energy efficiency, and a recommended value of the potential for improvement. There are similar figures for [[Environmental degradation|environmental impact]]. A table of estimated energy bills per annum (and the potential for improvement) is also presented, but without any reference to householder bills. The householder will have to pay for the survey, which costs around £60 for a four bedroom house. The exercise is entirely non-invasive, so the software will make assumptions on the insulation properties of various elements of the property based on age and construction type. The assessor has the ability to over-ride these assumptions if visual or written evidence is provided to support the presence of insulation which may have been subsequently installed.

==Domestic EPCs==
The calculation of the energy ratings on the energy performance certificate are based on the RDSAPv9.93 procedure, which is a simplified version of the SAP2012. SAP is short for Standard Assessment Procedure and RDSAP for Reduced Data SAP; both are derived from the UK [[Building Research Establishment]]'s Domestic Energy Model (BREDEM), which was originally developed in the 1980s and also underlies the [[National Home Energy Rating|NHER]] Rating. EPCs have to be produced by [[domestic energy assessor]]s who are registered under an approved certification scheme.

===Property Details===
The certificate contains the following property details:&lt;ref name="example-EPC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/49997/1790388.pdf |title=Example of an Energy Performance Certificate |publisher=[[Government of the United Kingdom]] |accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* property address
* property type (for example detached house)
* date of inspection
* certificate date and serial number
* total floor area.

The ''total floor area'' is the area contained within the external walls of the property. The figure includes internal walls, stairwells and the like, but excludes garages, porches, areas less than 1.5&amp;nbsp;m high, balconies and any similar area that is not an internal part of the dwelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://resources.peakdistrict.gov.uk/pubs/planning/housing/appendix6.pdf |title=Affordable Housing (Appendix 6) – Housing Corporation definition of total floor area |publisher=[[Peak District|Peak District National Park Authority]] |accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The A to G Scale===
Energy performance certificates present the energy efficiency of dwellings on a scale of A to G. The most efficient homes &amp;ndash; which should have the lowest fuel bills &amp;ndash; are in band A. The certificate uses the same scale to define the impact a home has on the environment. Better-rated homes should have less impact through [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions]]. The average property in the UK is in band D or E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/207196/20130613_-_Hedonic_Pricing_study_-_DECC_template__2_.pdf |title=An Investigation of the Effect of EPC Ratings on House Prices |publisher=[[Government of the United Kingdom]] |accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic RHI yardstick===
The EPC will become more significant from April 2014 when Domestic [[Renewable Heat Incentive]]s (RHI) become available. The amount of the deemed expected annual heat use for a domestic property can be obtained from the EPC and this will determine the amount of Domestic RHI which is payable on installing renewable heat options like ground source heat pumps and solar thermal collectors.

===EPC Recommendations===
The certificate includes recommendations on ways to improve the home’s energy efficiency to save money.&lt;ref name="example-EPC" /&gt; The accuracy of the recommendations will depend on the inspection standards applied by the inspector, which may be variable.  Inspectors, who may be Home Inspectors (HIs) or Domestic Energy Assessors (DEAs), are audited by their accreditation bodies in order to maintain standards. The recommendations appear general in tone, but are in fact bespoke to the property in question.  The logic by which the RDSAP program makes its recommendations was developed as part of a project to create the RDSAP methodology, which took place during the early years of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Standard Assessment Procedure|url=https://www.gov.uk/standard-assessment-procedure|publisher=www.gov.uk|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU directive requires the EPC recommendations to be cost effective in improving the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of the home, but in addition to presenting the most cost effective options, more expensive options which are less cost effective are also presented.  To distinguish them from the more cost effective measures, these are shown in a section described as 'further measures'. Because the EPC is designed to be produced at change of occupancy, it must be relevant to any occupier and it therefore must make no allowance for the particular preferences of the current occupier.

===Exempt properties===
Properties exempt from the Housing Act 2004 are:
* Non-residential, such as offices, shops, warehouses.
* Mixed use, a dwelling house which part of a business (farm, shop, petrol station)
* Unsafe properties, a property that poses a serious health and safety risk to occupants or visitors
* Properties to be demolished, properties that are due to be demolished where the marketing of the property, all the relevant documents and planning permission exists.
* [[Listed building]]s (Recast of EPC requirements from 9 January 2013)*
* Stand alone buildings of less than 50m2 (Recast of EPC requirements from 9 January 2013)
* Buildings of religion or worship (Recast of EPC requirements from 9 January 2013)
* Residential buildings with use of less than 4 months per year (Recast of EPC requirements from 9 January 2013)

The possible exemption of listed buildings has always been a contentious issue. As a devolved issue, no exemption of listed buildings exists under the Scottish Regulations. In England &amp; Wales, listed buildings are only exempt ''"...in so far as compliance with certain minimum energy performance requirements would unacceptably alter their character or appearance."'' In order to determine whether an EPC will have recommendations that would unacceptably alter the appearance or character of the listed dwelling is lodge an EPC and find out.

==Non-domestic energy performance certificates==
In addition to the requirements in relation to dwellings there is also a requirement for EPCs on the sale, rent or construction of buildings other than dwellings with a floor area greater than 50m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; from 6 April 2008, that contain fixed services that condition the interior environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndepcregister.com/|title=Non-Domestic Energy Performance Certificate Register|website=www.ndepcregister.com|access-date=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Properties that are exempt from requiring a domestic EPC will generally require a non-domestic energy performance certificate, which was also required by the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. Non-dwellings are "responsible for almost 20 per cent of the UK’s energy consumption and carbon emissions."&lt;ref name="DEC-guide"&gt;{{cite web |title=Improving the energy efficiency of our buildings – A guide to display energy certificates and advisory reports for public buildings |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/display-energy-certificates-and-advisory-reports-for-public-buildings |publisher=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]] |accessdate=19 September 2013 |date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All non-domestic EPCs must be carried out by, or under the direct supervision of, a trained non-domestic energy assessor, registered with an approved accreditation body.  [[DCLG]] has arranged for a publicly accessible [https://www.ndepcregister.com/ central register] of such assessors maintained by the Landmark Information Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.freemansurveying.com/services/mees/|title=Non-Domestic MEES|last=|first=|date=|access-date=2018-04-10|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB}} - Multiple Units Within The Same Building&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three levels of building, Level 3, Level 4 and Level 5. The complexity and the services used by that building will determine which level it falls under. The Commercial Energy Assessor must be qualified to the level of the building to carry out the inspection. 

From October 2008 all buildings including factories, offices, retail premises and public sector buildings - must have an EPC whenever the building is sold, built or rented.  Public buildings in England and Wales (but not Scotland) also require a display energy certificate showing actual energy use, and not just the theoretical energy rating.  From January 2009 inspections for air conditioning systems will be introduced.

===The A to G Scale for non-domestic EPCs===
The A to G scale is a linear scale based on two key points defined as follows:
# The zero point on the scale is defined as the performance of the building that has zero net annual CO2 emissions associated with the use of the fixed building services as defined in the Building Regulations. This is equivalent to a Building Emissions Rate (BER) of zero.
# The border between grade B and grade C is set at the Standard Emissions rate (SER)† and given an Asset Rating of 50. Because the scale is linear, the boundary between grades D and grade E corresponds to a rating of 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncm.bre.co.uk/filelibrary/NCM_Modelling_Guide_2010_Edition_28January2013.pdf |title=National Calculation Methodology (NCM) modelling guide 2010 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

†This is based on the actual building dimensions but with standard assumptions for fabric, glazing and building services.

See an [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120919132719/http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planningandbuilding/pdf/820540.pdf example].

==Display energy certificates==
Display energy certificates (DECs) show the actual energy usage of a building, the Operational Rating, and help the public see the energy efficiency of a building. This is based on the energy consumption of the building as recorded by gas, electricity and other meters. The DEC should be clearly displayed at all times and clearly visible to the public. A DEC is always accompanied by an Advisory Report that lists cost effective measures to improve the energy rating of the building.

Display energy certificates are only required for buildings with a total useful floor area over 500m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; that are occupied by a public authority and institution providing a public service to a large number of persons and therefore visited by those persons. The useful floor area limit will be reduced to 250m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in July 2015.

Where the building has a total useful floor area of more than 1,000m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the DEC is valid for 12 months. The accompanying advisory report is valid for seven years. Where the building has a total useful floor area of between 500m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 1000m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the DEC and advisory report are valid for 10 years.

However, to make it easier for public authorities with multiple buildings on one site to comply with the legislation, a site-based approach for the first year (to October 2009) is allowed where it is not possible to produce individual DECs. This means that only one DEC will need to be produced based on the total energy consumption of the buildings on the site. Public bodies most affected by this relaxation are NHS Trusts, universities and schools.

The requirement for display energy certificates came into effect from 1 October 2008.  They were trialled in the UK under an EU-funded project also called "Display" and co-ordinated by [[Energie-Cités]]; participants included [[Durham County Council]] and the [[Borough of Milton Keynes]].

===The A to G scale for DECs===
This is the operational rating for this building. The rating shows the energy performance of the building as it is being used by the occupants, when compared to the performance of other buildings of the same type. A building with performance equal to one typical of its type would therefore have an Operational Rating of 100. A building that resulted in zero CO2 emissions would have an Operational Rating of zero, and a building that resulted in twice the typical CO2 emissions would have an Operational Rating of 200.

This rating indicates whether the building is being operated above or below average performance for a building of this type.&lt;ref name="DEC-guide" /&gt;

See an [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120919132719/http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/planningandbuilding/pdf/768325.pdf example].

==Criticism==
[[Image:Old college farmhouse.jpg|thumb|Old College Farmhouse, a [[listed building]] dating to the 1600s, with thick walls rates poorly under current rules]]EPCs have gained some political controversy, partly reflecting the [[housing market crisis in the United Kingdom (2008)]].

Many in the housing industry, such as the [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]], have criticised the introduction of EPCs, on the grounds of poor quality.&lt;ref name="EPC-criticism1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/propertyadvice/propertyclinic/7590776/Dont-waste-your-energy-on-eco-certificates.html |publisher=The Telegraph|title=Don’t waste your energy on eco-certificates |date=15 April 2010 |author=David Snell|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EPC-criticism2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leedsmet.ac.uk/teaching/vsite/resources/furnell.pdf |title=Energy performance certificates: a waste of time or an effective contributor to a low carbon future? (pages 86-91, 40-51)|author=Benjamin Furnell|date=May 2012 |accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Whilst critical, RICS still provided courses Domestic Energy Assessment, as well as courseware manuals for the professions of Domestic Energy Assessors.

A further objection is often made concerning the quality of inspection made to produce the certificate. It cannot be invasive, so the inspector cannot drill walls or ceilings to determine the state or even existence of any [[Building insulation|insulation]]. The Energy Assessor can either assume the worst (no insulation present) or rely on the householder to produce documentary evidence on what may have been installed. This can produce uncertainty about the validity of the output from the assessor's analysis.

Finally, EPCs pose particular problems for the owners of [[listed building]]s, as improvements, such as [[double glazing]], are often barred by the controls on changes to such structures, making it difficult to rectify low ratings.

According to [[International Energy Agency|IEA]]  primary energy supply increased 29% and energy export 21% from 2004 to 2008 in Kazakhstan.

== Energy by sources ==
Kazakhstan started looking for ways to use [[renewable energy in Kazakhstan|its renewable energy sources]].&lt;ref name="azi1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kazakhstan to establish fund to finance energy-saving programs|url=http://www.azernews.az/region/85700.html|work=www.azernews.az}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late January 2015, an action plan was adopted on the development of renewable energy for the period of 2013 to 2020.&lt;ref name="azi1"/&gt;

On July 20, 2015 Kazakhstan Investment and Development Minister announced that the country would establish a special fund engaged in financing energy-saving programs.&lt;ref name="azi1"/&gt;

In the first half of 2016, Kazakhstan significantly increased the installed capacity of renewable energy facilities, which totaled 251.55 megawatts. It is 1.4 times more than in the same period of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kazakhstan raises capacity of renewable energy facilities|url=http://en.trend.az/business/economy/2546131.html|website=en.trend.az}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oil ===
Kazakhstan has estimated 30 billion barrels of oil reserves. With 172 oilfields, Kazakhstan possesses 3% of global oil reserves, putting it among the world’s top 15 countries in terms of oil reserves.&lt;ref&gt;Roman Vakulchuk and Indra Overland (2018) ‘Kazakhstan: Civil Society and Natural Resource Policy in Kazakhstan’, in Indra Overland (ed.) Public Brainpower: Civil Society and Natural Resource Management, Cham: Palgrave, pp. 143–162.
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320657015&lt;/ref&gt; The main reserves are in five largest onshore oil fields of Tengiz – the largest oil producing field with 565,000 barrels per day of crude in 2011 - Karachaganak, Aktobe, Mangistau, and Uzen, all of which are located in the western part of the country. These hold half of current proven reserves. The offshore fields of Kashagan and Kurmanagazy in the Caspian Sea are estimated to hold minimum 14 million barrels. With 9 – 11 billion barrels, Kashagan is the largest oil field outside of the Middle East. It is estimated to come on stream in 2016 and reach production of 1.5 million barrels per day at its peak. Kazakhstan is a major oil producer with an estimated total production of 1.64 million barrels per day in 2013. The country consumes around 13 per cent of the supply domestically and exports the rest to major oil markets. To continue expanding the liquids production above its current levels, the country needs to develop its Tengiz, Karachaganak, and Kashagan fields as well as add export capacity.&lt;ref name="eia.gov"&gt;[http://www.eia.gov/countries/analysisbriefs/Kazakhstan/kazakhstan.pdf US Energy Information Administration Kazakhstan Snapshot 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

KazMunayGas (KMG), the national oil and gas company, was created in 2002 to represent the interests of the state in the oil and gas industry. The oil production development has been made possible largely due to significant foreign investment, primarily from the Netherlands and the US in the early 2000s. In 2010, the Kazakh government took away KMG’s responsibility to regulate the sector to enable the company’s higher level of involvement in the commercial sector. The government now reserves a majority stake for KMG in all new projects and joint ventures. KMG now controls 20 per cent of total oil and gas proved reserves of Kazakhstan and produces 27 per cent of total oil and gas condensate and 14 per cent of gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/Kazakhstan_oil_and_gas_tax_guide_2014/$FILE/EY-Kazakhstan_oil_and_gas_tax_guide_2014.pdf E&amp;Y Kazakhstan Oil and Gas Tax Guide 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kazakhstan has three major refineries - Atyrau,&lt;ref&gt;[http://kazworld.info/?p=58130 Company Overview of Atyrau Refinery LLP]&lt;/ref&gt; Shymkent and Pavlodar. Their combined crude refining capacity amounts to around 350,000 barrels per day, roughly evenly split amongst the three.   Due to aged infrastructure, they mostly operate only at 60 per cent of their capacity. The government has made significant investment in the modernization of these units to be completed around 2016.&lt;ref name="eia.gov"/&gt;

In mid-2016, a group of oil companies led by Chevron announced a $36.8 billion investment deal for the development of Kazakhstan’s Tengiz oil field. According to experts, this investment may allow Kazakhstan to become a top 10 oil producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kazakhstan Moves Towards Becoming A Top 10 Oil Producer|url=http://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Kazakhstan-Moves-Towards-Becoming-A-Top-10-Oil-Producer.html|website=oilprice.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Natural Gas ===
Kazakhstan’s proven reserves of natural gas are 85 trillion cubic feet. (2013).  Majority of natural gas reserves are located in the west of Kazakhstan and concentrated in four fields – Karachanganak (46 per cent), Tengiz (12 per cent), Imashevskoye (7 per cent) and Kashagan (12 per cent).&lt;ref&gt;([http://www.eia.gov/countries/analysisbriefs/Kazakhstan/kazakhstan.pdf] US Energy Information Administration Kazakhstan Snapshot 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2000-2012 the natural gas production increased four times to 40.1 billion cubic meters in 2012.  However, only 53 per cent of this gas was for commercial purposes; the rest was re-injected into oil fields to enhance production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azernews.az/oil_and_gas/49040.html Kazakhstan announces 2012 oil and gas production figures])&lt;/ref&gt;

Kazakhstan’s gas production suffices to meet domestic demand of 10.5 billion cubic meters (2012).  However, due to limited internal gas pipeline network that does not connect all the production centers (west) with demand centers (south, east, north), the country needs to import gas from Uzbekistan to satisfy the demand in the south of the country and from Russia to satisfy demand in the north and east. In 2012, the country exported 8.8 billion cubic meters of gas to China through the Central Asia – China pipeline. Kazakhstan serves as a major transit country for gas exports from Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan that are destined to Russia and China. In 2012, the amount of gas transited through Kazakhstan was 96.5 billion cubic meters.&lt;ref name="eia.gov"/&gt;

=== Coal ===
Kazakhstan sits on Central Asia’s largest recoverable coal reserves. At 33.6 billion tonnes the reserves represent 3.8 per cent of global total reserves. (2013). In 2013, the country produced 58.4 million tones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/pdf/Energy-economics/statistical-review-2014/BP-statistical-review-of-world-energy-2014-full-report.pdf BP Statistical Review of World Energy June 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Coal production stands at 70 per cent of what it was during the Soviet Union. The largest coal producer is Bogatyr Coal that operates the largest 4.5 billion tons open-pit coal mine in the world in Ekibastuz in the northeastern region of Kazakhstan. In 2012 Bogatyr Coal produced 46 million tons of coal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rusal.ru/en/about/7.aspx Bogatyr Komir data]&lt;/ref&gt;

Majority of coal, 75 percent, is used for domestic consumption, power generation in particular. The largest importers of Kazakhstan’s oil include the neighboring southern Russia and Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.gov/countries/cab.cfm?fips=KZ US Energy Information Agency data]&lt;/ref&gt;

A major concern of the coal mines of Kazakhstan is safety and prevention and control of mine explosions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finnwatch.org/images/stories/Kivihiili_EN_web.pdf Coal from the East and the South], Responsibility in energy company coal purchases, FinnWatch 23.12.2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 Kazakhstan was '''''8. top coal producer''''': 96 million tonnes [[hard coal]] and 5 million tonnes [[brown coal]]. 22 Mt of hard coal was exported (2009). In 2009 Kazakhstan was world 8. top coal exporter. The top hard coal net exporters in 2009 were (Mt): [[Energy in Australia|Australia]]  262, [[Energy in Indonesia|Indonesia]] 230, [[Energy in Russia|Russia]]  93, [[Energy in Colombia|Colombia]]  69, [[Energy in South Africa|South Africa]]  67, [[Energy in the United States|United States]]  33, [[Energy in Vietnam|Vietnam]]  25, Kazakhstan  22, [[Energy in Canada|Canada]]  20 and [[Energy in Czech Republic|Czech Republic]]  4.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2010/key_stats_2010.pdf Key world energy statistics 2010] IEA&lt;/ref&gt;
The coal of Kazakhstan has low energy value 0.444 toe/tonne compared to e.g. in this respect top coal of Australia 0.689 toe/tonne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2010/key_stats_2010.pdf Key world energy statistics 2010] IEA page 59&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming both hard coal 96 Mt and brown coal 6 Mt having about the same energy value,: the coal production would have been about 101 Mt*0.444 toe/Mt*11.630 TWh/toe = 521 TWh in 2009 and export .22*0.444 toe/Mt*11.630 TWh/toe = 114 TWh.

==Electricity==
In 2013, the country produced 93.76 billion kWH - 70 billion kWh (81%) from coal, 8 from gas and 8 from hydro. The country has 71 power stations, including 5 hydro power plants located on the Irtysh river, which translates to total installed generating capacity of 19.6 GW. 75 per cent of electricity generated is consumed by industry, 11 per cent by households, 2 per cent by transportation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Country-Profiles/Countries-G-N/Kazakhstan/, Uranium and Nuclear Power in Kazakhstan, World-nuclear.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kazakhstan largest solar power station "Burboye Solar-1" LLP was commissioned in July 2015. Since then during a year of operation the solar power station produced over 38.4 million kWh. Besides "Burboye Solar-1," the Zhambyl region implements nine projects of alternative energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Six green energy projects to be launched in Zhambyl region by 2020|url=http://www.inform.kz/eng/article/2940414|website=www.inform.kz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Eos''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|ɒ|s}}; [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] and [[Homeric Greek]] {{lang|grc|Ἠώς}} ''Ēōs'', [[Attic Greek|Attic]] {{lang|grc|Ἕως}} ''Éōs'', "dawn", {{IPA-el|ɛːɔ̌ːs|pron}} or {{IPA-el|héɔːs|}}; [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]] {{lang|grc|Αὔως}} ''Aúōs'', [[Doric Greek|Doric]] {{lang|grc|Ἀώς}} ''Āṓs'') is a [[Titan (mythology)|Titaness]] and the [[goddess]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Lycophron]] calls her by an archaic name, ''Tito'' (the Titaness). Kerenyi observes that Tito shares a linguistic origin with Eos's lover [[Tithonus]], which belonged to an older, pre-Greek language. (Kerenyi 1951:199  note 637)&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[dawn]], who rose each morning from her home at the edge of the [[Oceanus]].

Eos had a brother and a sister, [[Helios]], god of the sun, and [[Selene]], goddess of the moon.

==Etymology==
Eos is cognate to the [[Vedic]] goddess ''[[Ushas]]'', [[Culture of Lithuania|Lithuania]]n goddess ''[[Aušrinė]]'', and [[ancient Roman religion|Roman]] goddess ''[[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]]'' ([[Old Latin]] ''Ausosa''), all three of whom are also goddesses of the dawn. All four are considered derivatives of the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] stem ''*h₂ewsṓs''&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 492.&lt;/ref&gt; (later *''Ausṓs''), "dawn", a stem that also gave rise to [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*Austrō'', [[Old Germanic]] ''*Ōstara'' and [[Old English]] ''[[Ēostre]] / Ēastre''. This agreement leads to the reconstruction of a [[Hausos|Proto-Indo-European dawn goddess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mallory|first1=J.P.|last2=Adams|first2=D.Q.|title=The Oxford Introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=978-0-19-929668-2|page=432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cult and temples==
There are no known temples, shrines or altars to Eos. However, Ovid seems to allude to the existence of at least two shrines of Eos, as he describes them in plural, albeit few, in the lines: 
:"[Eos addresses Zeus :] ‘Least I may be of all the goddesses the golden heavens hold--in all the world my shrines are rarest.’"&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, Metamorphoses 13. 576 ff (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.)&lt;/ref&gt;
Ovid may therefore have known of at least two such shrines.

==Greek literature {{Anchor|Eos in Greek literature}}==
The dawn goddess Eos was almost always described with rosy fingers (ῥοδοδάκτυλος, ''rhododáktylos'') or rosy forearms (ῥοδόπηχυς, ''rhodópēkhys'') as she opened the gates of heaven for the Sun to rise.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nonnus]]: "Eos had just shaken off the wing of carefree sleep (Hypnos) and opened the gates of sunrise, leaving the lightbringing couch of [[Cephalus|Kephalos]]." (''[[Dionysiaca]]'' 27. 1f, in  A.L. Rouse's translation).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Homer]],&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' viii.1; xxiv.695&lt;/ref&gt; her [[saffron (color)|saffron-coloured]] robe is embroidered or woven with flowers;&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'' vi:48 etc&lt;/ref&gt; rosy-fingered and with golden arms, she is pictured on [[Attic vase]]s as a beautiful woman, crowned with a [[tiara]] or [[diadem (personal wear)|diadem]] and with the large white-feathered wings of a bird.

From ''The [[Iliad]]'':

{{quote|Now when Dawn in robe of saffron was hastening from the streams of [[Oceanus]], to bring light to mortals and immortals, [[Thetis]] reached the ships with the armor that the god had given her.|''Iliad'' xix.1}}

{{quote|But soon as early Dawn appeared, the [[rose (color)|rosy]]-fingered, then gathered the folk about the [[pyre]] of glorious [[Hector]].|''Iliad'' xxiv.776}}

[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] pictured her exulting in her heart over the radiant horses (Lampus and Phaëton) that drew her chariot, amidst the bright-haired [[Horae]], the feminine Hours, climbing the arc of heaven and scattering sparks of fire.&lt;ref&gt;''Posthomerica'' i.48&lt;/ref&gt;

She is most often associated with her Homeric [[epithet]] "rosy-fingered" (''rhododactylos''), but Homer also calls her '''Eos Erigeneia''':
{{quote|That brightest of stars appeared, ''[[Eosphorus|Eosphoros]],'' that most often heralds the light of early-rising Dawn (''Eos Erigeneia'').|''[[Odyssey]]'' xiii.93}}

[[Hesiod]] wrote:
{{quote|And after these Erigeneia  ["Early-born"] bore the star [[Eosphoros]] ("Dawn-bringer"), and the gleaming stars with which heaven is crowned.|''Theogony'' 378-382}}

Thus Eos, preceded by the [[Phosphorus (morning star)|Morning Star]], is seen as the genetrix of all the stars and planets; her tears are considered to have created the morning dew, personified as [[Ersa]] or [[Herse]] (Ovid, Metamorphoses 13.621-2).
Eos is the daughter of [[Hyperion (mythology)|Hyperion]], a bringer of light, the ''One Above, Who Travels High Above the Earth'' and ''of Theia, The Divine''. Her brother was the Sun god [[Helios]], and her sister was [[Selene]], the Moon goddess. Her team of horses pull her chariot across the sky and are named in the Odyssey as "Firebright" and "Daybright".

She was the Mother of several notable offspring, including the Winds, Zephyrus, Boreas, and Notus, and the Morning Star, Eosphoros, all of whom she bore to the Titan Astraeus ("of the Stars"), and Memnon, her son by Tithonus.

This rosy-fingered, saffron-robed and golden-throned goddess, who goes up to Olympus to announce the light to the immortals, fell in love several times, and some say it was Aphrodite who cursed her to be perpetually in love, because once had Eos lain with Aphrodite's sweetheart Ares, the god of war.

==Genealogy==
Eos is the daughter of [[Hyperion (mythology)|Hyperion]] and [[Theia]] and sister of [[Helios]] the sun and [[Selene]] the moon, "who shine upon all that are on earth and upon the deathless gods who live in the wide heaven" [[Hesiod]] told in ''[[Theogony]]'' (371-374). The generation of Titans preceded all the familiar deities of Olympus who largely supplanted them.

==Lovers and children==

[[File:Eos Memnon Louvre G115.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Eos and the slain [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]] on an [[Attic]] red-figure cup, ca. 490–480 BCE, the so-called "Memnon Pietà" found at [[Capua]] ([[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]]).]]

According to [[Pseudo-Apollodorus]], Eos consorted with the war god [[Ares]] and was thereupon cursed with unsatisfiable sexual desire by the jealous [[Aphrodite]].&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'', 1. 4. 4&lt;/ref&gt; This caused her to abduct a number of handsome young men, most notably [[Cephalus]], [[Tithonus]], [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]], and [[Cleitus (mythology)|Cleitus]]. The good-looking Cleitus was made immortal by her.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''Odyssey'', 15. 249 ff&lt;/ref&gt; She also asked for Tithonus to be made immortal, but forgot to ask for eternal youth, which resulted in him living forever as a helpless old man.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homeric Hymn]] to Aphrodite, 318 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hesiod&lt;ref&gt;''Theogony'' 984ff&lt;/ref&gt; by Tithonus Eos had two sons, [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]] and [[Emathion]]. Memnon fought among the Trojans in the [[Trojan War]] and was slain. Her image with the dead Memnon across her knees, like [[Thetis]] with the dead [[Achilles]] are [[icon]]s that inspired the Christian [[Pietà]] {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}.

[[File:Eos chariot 430-420 BC Staatliche Antikensammlungen.jpg|thumb|right|Eos in her chariot flying over the sea, red-figure [[krater]] from South [[Italy]], 430–420 BC, [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]]]]

The abduction of Cephalus had special appeal for an Athenian audience because Cephalus was a local boy,&lt;ref&gt;Mary R. Lefkowitz, "'Predatory' Goddesses" ''Hesperia'' '''71'''.4 (October 2002, pp. 325-344) p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; and so this myth element appeared frequently in Attic vase-paintings and was exported with them. In the literary myths&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod ''Theogony'' 984; pseudo-Apollodorus ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' iii. 14.3; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] i. 3.1; [[Ovid]] ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' vii. 703ff; Hyginus ''Fabula 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Eos kidnapped [[Cephalus]] when he was hunting and took him to Syria.

The second-century CE traveller Pausanias was informed that the abductor of Cephalus was [[Hemera]], goddess of Day.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias remarking on the subjects shown in the Royal Stoa, Athens (i.3.1) and on the throne of Apollo at Amyklai (iii.18.10ff).&lt;/ref&gt; Although Cephalus was already married to [[Procris]], Eos bore him three sons, including [[Phaethon (son of Eos)|Phaeton]] and [[Hesperus]], but he then began pining for Procris, causing a disgruntled Eos to return him to her and put a curse on them.

In Hyginus' report,&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus, ''Fabula'' 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Cephalus accidentally killed Procris some time later after he mistook her for an animal while hunting.

In Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'' VII, Procris, a jealous wife, was spying on him and heard him singing to the wind, but thought he was serenading his ex-lover Eos.

==Etruscan interpretations==
Among the Etruscans, the generative dawn-goddess was [[Thesan]]. Depictions of the dawn-goddess with a young lover became popular in Etruria in the fifth century, probably inspired by imported Greek vase-painting.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Y. Goldberg, "The 'Eos and Kephalos' from Cære: Its Subject and Date" ''American Journal of Archæology'' '''91'''.4 (October 1987, pp. 605-614) p 607.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Etruscans preferred to show the goddess as a nurturer (''Kourotrophos'') rather than an abductor of young men, the late Archaic sculptural [[acroterion]] from Etruscan Cære, now in Berlin, showing the goddess in archaic running pose adapted from the Greeks, and bearing a boy in her arms, has commonly been identified as Eos and [[Cephalus]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg 1987:605-614 casts doubt on the boy's identification, in the context of Etruscan and Greek abduction motifs.&lt;/ref&gt; On an Etruscan mirror Thesan is shown carrying off a young man, whose name is inscribed as Tinthu&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Noted by Goldberg 1987: in I. Mayer-Prokop, ''Die gravierten etruskischen Griffspiegel archaischen Stils'' (Heidelberg) 1966, fig. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman interpretations==
The [[Roman mythology|Roman]] equivalent of Eos is [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]], also a cognate showing the characteristic [[Latin]] [[rhotacism (sound change)#Latin|rhotacism]]. Dawn became associated in Roman cult with Matuta, later known as [[Mater Matuta]]. She was also associated with the sea harbors and ports, and had a temple on the [[Forum Boarium]]. On June 11, the [[Matralia]] was celebrated at that temple in honor of Mater Matuta; this festival was only for women during their first marriage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14275">'''Exploration geophysics''' is an applied branch of [[geophysics]], which uses physical methods, such as seismic, gravitational, magnetic, electrical and electromagnetic at the surface of the [[Earth]] to measure the physical properties of the subsurface, along with the anomalies in those properties. It is most often used to detect or infer the presence and position of economically useful geological deposits, such as [[ore]] minerals; [[fossil fuels]] and other [[hydrocarbons]]; [[Geothermal energy|geothermal]] reservoirs; and [[groundwater]] reservoirs.

Exploration geophysics can be used to directly detect the target style of mineralization, via measuring its physical properties directly. For example, one may measure the density contrasts between the dense [[iron ore]] and the lighter [[silicate]] host rock, or one may measure the [[electrical conductivity]] contrast between conductive [[sulfide mineral]]s and the resistive silicate host rock.

== Geophysical methods ==
The main techniques used are:

# [[Seismic tomography]] to locate earthquakes and assist in [[Seismology]] 
# [[Reflection seismology]] and [[seismic refraction]] to map the surface structure of a region. 
# [[Physical geodesy|Geodesy]] and [[gravity anomaly|gravity techniques]], including [[gravity gradiometry]].
# [[Magnetism|Magnetic techniques]], including [[aeromagnetic survey]]s to map magnetic anomalies.
# [[Electricity|Electrical techniques]], including [[electrical resistivity tomography]] and [[induced polarization]].
# [[Electromagnetism|Electromagnetic methods]], such as [[magnetotellurics]], [[ground penetrating radar]], [[TDEM|transient/time-domain electromagnetics]] and [[SNMR]].
# [[Well logging|Borehole geophysics]], also called [[well logging]].
# [[Remote sensing|Remote sensing techniques]], including [[hyperspectral imaging]].

Many other techniques, or methods of integration of the above techniques, have been developed and are currently used. However these are not as common due to cost-effectiveness, wide applicability and/or uncertainty in the results produced.

== Uses ==
Exploration geophysics is also used to map the subsurface structure of a region, to elucidate the underlying structures, spatial distribution of rock units, and to detect structures such as faults, folds and intrusive rocks. This is an indirect method for assessing the likelihood of ore deposits or hydrocarbon accumulations.

Methods devised for finding mineral or hydrocarbon deposits can also be used in other areas such as monitoring environmental impact, [[Geophysical imaging|imaging]] subsurface [[Archaeology|archaeological]] sites, ground water investigations, subsurface salinity mapping, [[civil engineering]] [[site investigation]]s and interplanetary imaging.

=== Mineral exploration ===
Magnetometric surveys can be useful in defining magnetic anomalies which represent ore (direct detection), or in some cases gangue minerals associated with ore deposits (indirect or inferential detection).

The most direct method of detection of ore via magnetism involves detecting [[iron ore]] mineralisation via mapping magnetic anomalies associated with [[banded iron formation]]s which usually contain [[magnetite]] in some proportion. [[Skarn]] mineralisation, which often contains magnetite, can also be detected though the ore minerals themselves would be non-magnetic. Similarly, magnetite, hematite and often [[pyrrhotite]] are common minerals associated with [[hydrothermal alteration]], and this alteration can be detected to provide an inference that some mineralising hydrothermal event has affected the rocks.

Gravity surveying can be used to detect dense bodies of rocks within host formations of less dense wall rocks. This can be used to directly detect [[Carbonate hosted lead zinc ore deposits|Mississippi Valley Type ore deposits]], [[Iron oxide copper gold ore deposits|IOCG]] ore deposits, iron ore deposits, skarn deposits and salt diapirs which can form oil and gas traps.

[[Electromagnetic]] (EM) surveys can be used to help detect a wide variety of mineral deposits, especially base metal sulphides via detection of conductivity anomalies which can be generated around sulphide bodies in the subsurface. EM surveys are also used in [[diamond]] exploration (where the [[kimberlite]] pipes tend to have lower resistance than enclosing rocks), [[graphite]] exploration, [[uranium ore deposits|palaeochannel-hosted uranium deposits]] (which are associated with shallow aquifers, which often respond to EM surveys in conductive overburden). These are indirect inferential methods of detecting mineralisation, as the commodity being sought is not directly conductive, or not sufficiently conductive to be measurable.  EM surveys are also used in [[unexploded ordnance]], archaeological, and geotechnical investigations.

Regional EM surveys are conducted via airborne methods, using either fixed-wing aircraft or helicopter-borne EM rigs. Surface EM methods are based mostly on Transient EM methods using surface loops with a surface receiver, or a downhole tool lowered into a borehole which transects a body of mineralisation. These methods can map out sulphide bodies within the earth in 3 dimensions, and provide information to geologists to direct further exploratory drilling on known mineralisation. Surface loop surveys are rarely used for regional exploration, however in some cases such surveys can be used with success (e.g.; SQUID surveys for nickel ore bodies).

Electric-resistance methods such as induced polarization methods can be useful for directly detecting sulfide bodies, coal and resistive rocks such as salt and carbonates.

=== Hydrocarbon exploration ===

[[reflection seismology|Seismic reflection]] techniques are the most widely used geophysical technique in hydrocarbon exploration. They are used to map the subsurface distribution of stratigraphy and its structure which can be used to delineate potential hydrocarbon accumulations. [[Well logging]] is another widely used technique as it provides necessary high resolution information about rock and fluid properties in a vertical section, although they are limited in areal extent. This limitation in areal extent is the reason why seismic reflection techniques are so popular; they provide a method for interpolating and extrapolating well log information over a much larger area.

[[Gravity anomaly|Gravity]] and [[Aeromagnetic survey|magnetics]] are also used, with considerable frequency, in oil and gas exploration. These can be used to determine the geometry and depth of covered geological structures including [[tectonic uplift|uplifts]], [[sedimentary basin|subsiding basins]], [[Fault (geology)|faults]], [[Fold (geology)|folds]], [[intrusion|igneous intrusions]] and [[Salt dome|salt diapirs]] due to their unique [[density]] and [[magnetic susceptibility]] signatures compared to the surrounding rocks.

[[Remote sensing]] techniques, specifically [[hyperspectral imaging]], have been used to detect hydrocarbon microseepages using the [[spectral signature]] of geochemically altered soils and vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=S.D. |last1=Khan |first2=S. |last2=Jacobson |title=Remote Sensing and Geochemistry for Detecting Hydrocarbon Microseepages |journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin |year=2008 |volume=120 |pages=96–105 |doi=10.1130/b26182.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=A. |last1=Petrovic |first2=S.D. |last2=Khan |first3=H. |last3=Chafetz |title=Remote detection and geochemical studies for finding hydrocarbon-induced alterations in Lisbon Valley, Utah |journal=[[Marine and Petroleum Geology]] |year=2008 |volume=25 |pages=696–705 |doi=10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2008.03.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically at sea, two methods are used: marine seismic reflection and electromagnetic seabed logging (SBL).[[Marine Magnetotellurics (mMT)]] or [[marine Controlled Source Electro-Magnetics (mCSEM)]] can provide pseudo-direct detection of hydrocarbons by detecting resistivity changes over geological traps (signaled by seismic survey), then minimizing the number of wellcats.&lt;ref&gt;Stéphane Sainson, ''Electromagnetic seabed logging, A new tool for geoscientists''. Ed. Springer, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil engineering ===

==== Ground penetrating radar ====

[[Ground penetrating radar]] is a non-invasive technique, and is used within civil construction and engineering for a variety of uses, including detection of utilities (buried water, gas, sewerage, electrical and telecommunication cables), mapping of soft soils and overburden for [[geotechnical]] characterization, and other similar uses.

==== Spectral-Analysis-of-Surface-Waves ====
The Spectral-Analysis-of-Surface-Waves (SASW) method is another non-invasive technique, which is widely used in practice to image the shear wave velocity profile of the soil. The SASW method relies on the dispersive nature of Raleigh waves in layered media, i.e., the wave-velocity depends on the load's frequency. A material profile, based on the SASW method, is thus obtained according to: a) constructing an experimental dispersion curve, by performing field experiments, each time using a different loading frequency, and measuring the surface wave-speed for each frequency; b) constructing a theoretical dispersion curve, by assuming a trial distribution for the material properties of a layered profile; c) varying the material properties of the layered profile, and repeating the previous step, until a match between the experimental dispersion curve, and the theoretical dispersion curve is attained. The SASW method renders a layered (one-dimensional) shear wave velocity profile for the soil.

===== Full waveform inversion =====
Full-waveform-inversion (FWI) methods are among the most recent techniques for geotechnical site characterization, and are still under continuous development. The method is fairly general, and is capable of imaging the arbitrarily heterogeneous compressional and shear wave velocity profiles of the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=L.F. |last1=Kallivokas |first2=A. |last2=Fathi |first3=S. |last3=Kucukcoban |first4=K.H. |last4=Stokoe II |first5=J. |last5=Bielak |first6=O. |last6=Ghattas |title=Site characterization using full waveform inversion |journal=Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering |year=2013 |volume=47 |pages=62–82 |doi=10.1016/j.soildyn.2012.12.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Arash |last1=Fathi |first2=Babak |last2=Poursartip |first3=Kenneth H |last3=Stokoe II |first4=Loukas F. |last4=Kallivokas  |title=Three-dimensional P- and S-wave velocity profiling of geotechnical sites using full-waveform inversion driven by field data |journal=Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering |year=2016 |volume=87 |pages=63–81 |doi=10.1016/j.soildyn.2016.04.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elastic waves are used to probe the site under investigation, by placing seismic vibrators on the ground surface. These waves propagate through the soil, and due to the heterogeneous geological structure of the site under investigation, multiple reflections and refractions occur. The response of the site to the seismic vibrator is measured by sensors (geophones), also placed on the ground surface. Two key-components are required for the profiling based on full-waveform inversion. These components are: a) a computer model for the simulation of elastic waves in semi-infinite domains;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Arash |last1=Fathi |first2=Babak |last2=Poursartip |first3=Loukas |last3=Kallivokas |title=Time‐domain hybrid formulations for wave simulations in three‐dimensional PML‐truncated heterogeneous media |journal=International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering |year=2015 |volume=101 |pages=165–198 |doi=10.1002/nme.4780|bibcode = 2015IJNME.101..165F }}&lt;/ref&gt; and b) an optimization framework, through which the computed response is matched to the measured response, via iteratively updating an initially assumed material distribution for the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Arash |last1=Fathi |first2=Loukas |last2=Kallivokas |first3=Babak |last3=Poursartip |title=Full-waveform inversion in three-dimensional PML-truncated elastic media |journal=Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering |year=2015 |volume=296 |pages=39–72 |doi=10.1016/j.cma.2015.07.008 |arxiv = 1504.08340 |bibcode = 2015CMAME.296...39F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Other techniques =====
Civil engineering can also use remote sensing information for topographical mapping, planning and environmental impact assessment. Airborne electromagnetic surveys are also used to characterize soft sediments in planning and engineering roads, dams and other structures.

[[Magnetotellurics]] has proven useful for delineating groundwater reservoirs, mapping faults around areas where hazardous substances are stored (e.g. nuclear power stations and nuclear waste storage facilities), and earthquake precursor monitoring in areas with major structures such as hydro-electric dams subject to high levels of seismic activity.

[[BS 5930]] is the standard used in the UK as a code of practice for site investigations.

=== Archaeology ===
{{See also|Geophysical survey (archaeology)}}

[[Ground penetrating radar]] can be used to map buried artifacts, such as graves, mortuaries, wreck sites, and other shallowly buried archaeological sites.

Ground magnetometric surveys can be used for detecting buried ferrous metals, useful in surveying shipwrecks, modern battlefields strewn with metal debris, and even subtle disturbances such as large-scale ancient ruins.

Sonar systems can be used to detect shipwrecks.

=== Forensics ===
[[Ground penetrating radar]] can be used to detect grave sites.

=== Unexploded ordnance detection ===

Magnetic and electromagnetic surveys can be used to locate [[unexploded ordnance]].

'''Geothermal gradient''' is the rate of increasing temperature with respect to increasing depth in the [[Earth]]'s interior. Away from tectonic plate boundaries, it is about 25–30&amp;nbsp;°C/km (72-87&amp;nbsp;°F/mi)  of depth near the surface in most of the world.&lt;ref name="IPCC" /&gt; Strictly speaking, ''geo''-thermal necessarily refers to the Earth but the concept may be applied to other planets. 

The [[Earth's internal heat budget|Earth's internal heat]] comes from a combination of residual heat from [[planetary accretion]], heat produced through [[radioactive decay]], latent heat from core crystallization, and possibly heat from other sources.

In Earth's continental crust, the decay of natural radioactive isotopes makes a significant contribution to geothermal heat production. The continental crust is abundant in lower density minerals but also contains significant concentrations of heavier [[Goldschmidt classification#Lithophile elements|lithophilic]] minerals such as uranium. Because of this, it holds the most concentrated global reservoir of radioactive elements found in the Earth.&lt;ref name="Geothermal"&gt;William, G. E. (2010).

KGaA.&lt;/ref&gt; These high levels of radioactive elements are largely excluded from the Earth's mantle due to their inability to substitute in mantle minerals and consequent enrichment in melts during mantle melting processes. The mantle is mostly made up of high density minerals with higher concentrations of elements that have relatively small atomic radii such as magnesium (Mg), titanium (Ti), and calcium (Ca).&lt;ref name="Geothermal" /&gt;

The geothermal gradient is steeper in the lithosphere than in the mantle because the mantle transports heat primarily by convection, leading to a geothermal gradient that is determined by the mantle adiabat, rather than by the conductive heat transfer processes that predominate in the lithosphere, which acts as a [[Thermal boundary layer thickness and shape|thermal boundary layer]] of the convecting mantle.{{Citation needed|sate=August 2018|date=August 2018}}

Heat flows constantly from its sources within the Earth to the surface. Total heat loss from the Earth is estimated at 44.2 TW ({{nowrap|4.42 × 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Watts}}).&lt;ref name=Pollack&gt;[http://anquetil.colorado.edu/EPP3/readings/Pollack_etal_1993_Rev_Geophys.pdf Pollack, Henry N., et.al.,''Heat flow from the Earth's interior: Analysis of the global data set,'' Reviews of Geophysics, 31, 3 / August 1993, p. 273 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811133919/http://anquetil.colorado.edu/EPP3/readings/Pollack_etal_1993_Rev_Geophys.pdf |date=2011-08-11 }} {{doi|10.1029/93RG01249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mean heat flow is 65&amp;nbsp;mW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; over [[continental crust]] and 101&amp;nbsp;mW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; over [[oceanic crust]].&lt;ref name=Pollack/&gt; This is 0.087 watt/square meter on average (0.03 percent of solar power absorbed by the Earth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate and Earth’s Energy Budget|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/EnergyBalance/page1.php|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; ), but is much more concentrated in areas where the lithosphere is thin, such as along [[mid-ocean ridge]]s (where new oceanic lithosphere is created) and near [[mantle plume]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Richards, M.

The [[Earth's crust]] effectively acts as a thick insulating blanket which must be pierced by fluid conduits (of magma, water or other) in order to release the heat underneath. More of the heat in the Earth is lost through plate tectonics, by mantle upwelling associated with mid-ocean ridges. The final major mode of heat loss is by [[Heat conduction|conduction]] through the [[lithosphere]], the majority of which occurs in the oceans due to the crust there being much thinner and younger than under the continents.&lt;ref name=Pollack/&gt;&lt;ref name="heat loss"&gt;{{cite journal

The heat of the Earth is replenished by radioactive decay at a rate of 30 TW.&lt;ref name="sustainability"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Rybach | first = Ladislaus | date =September 2007 | title =Geothermal Sustainability | periodical =Geo-Heat Centre Quarterly Bulletin | publication-place =Klamath Falls, Oregon | publisher =Oregon Institute of Technology | volume =28 | issue =3 | pages = 2–7 | url =http://www.oit.edu/docs/default-source/geoheat-center-documents/quarterly-bulletin/vol-28/28-3/28-3-art2.pdf | issn =0276-1084 | accessdate =2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The global geothermal flow rates are more than twice the rate of human energy consumption from all primary sources.

== Direct application ==
Heat from Earth's interior can be used as an energy source, known as [[geothermal energy]]. The geothermal gradient has been used for space heating and bathing since ancient Roman times, and more recently for generating electricity. As the human population continues to grow, so does energy use and the correlating environmental impacts that are consistent with global primary sources of energy. This has caused a growing interest in finding sources of energy that are renewable and have reduced greenhouse gas emissions. In areas of high geothermal energy density, current technology allows for the generation of electrical power because of the corresponding high temperatures. Generating electrical power from geothermal resources requires no fuel while providing true baseload energy at a reliability rate that constantly exceeds 90%.&lt;ref name="Geothermal" /&gt; In order to extract geothermal energy, it is necessary to efficiently transfer heat from a geothermal reservoir to a power plant, where electrical energy is converted from heat by passing steam through a [[turbine]] connected to a generator.&lt;ref name="Geothermal" /&gt; On a worldwide scale, the heat stored in Earth's interior provides an energy that is still seen as an exotic source. About 10 GW of [[geothermal electric]] capacity is installed around the world as of 2007, generating 0.3% of global electricity demand. An additional 28 GW of direct [[geothermal heating]] capacity is installed for district heating, space heating, spas, industrial processes, desalination and agricultural applications.&lt;ref name="IPCC" /&gt; 

== Variations ==
The geothermal gradient varies with location and is typically measured by determining the bottom open-hole [[temperature]] after borehole drilling. To achieve accuracy the drilling fluid needs time to reach the [[ambient temperature]]. This is not always achievable for practical reasons.

In stable [[tectonic]] areas in the [[tropics]] a temperature-[[:wikt:depth|depth]] plot will converge to the annual average surface temperature. However, in areas where deep [[permafrost]] developed during the [[Pleistocene]] a low temperature anomaly can be observed that persists down to several hundred metres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pgi.gov.pl/pgi_en/index.php?option=news&amp;task=viewarticle&amp;sid=107 The Frozen Time, from the Polish Geological Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027200436/http://www.pgi.gov.pl/pgi_en/index.php?option=news&amp;task=viewarticle&amp;sid=107 |date=2010-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Suwałki]] cold anomaly in [[Poland]] has led to the recognition that similar thermal disturbances related to Pleistocene-[[Holocene]] [[climatic]] changes are recorded in boreholes throughout Poland, as well as in [[Alaska]], [[northern Canada]], and [[Siberia]].
[[Image:300px-Geothermgradients.png|right|thumb|500px]]

In areas of Holocene [[Tectonic uplift|uplift]] and [[erosion]] (Fig. 1) the shallow gradient will be high until it reaches an inflection point where it reaches the stabilized heat-flow regime. If the gradient of the stabilized regime is projected above the inflection point to its intersect with present-day annual average temperature, the height of this intersect above present-day surface level gives a measure of the extent of Holocene uplift and erosion. In areas of Holocene [[subsidence]] and [[Deposition (sediment)|deposition]] (Fig. 2) the initial gradient will be lower than the average until it reaches an inflection point where it joins the stabilized heat-flow regime.

In deep boreholes,{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} the temperature of the rock below the inflection point generally increases with depth at rates of the order of 20 [[Kelvin|K]]/km or more.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}  [[Heat conduction#Fourier.27s law|Fourier's law of heat flow]] applied to the Earth gives  ''q'' = ''Mg'' where ''q'' is the [[heat flux]] at a point on the Earth's surface, ''M'' the [[thermal conductivity]] of the rocks there, and ''g'' the measured geothermal gradient. A representative value for the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks is ''M'' = 3.0 [[Watt|W]]/mK.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}  Hence, using the global average geothermal conducting gradient of 0.02 K/m we get that ''q'' = 0.06 W/m². This estimate, corroborated by thousands of observations of [[heat flow]] in boreholes all over the world, gives a global average of 6×10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt; W/m².{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Thus, if the geothermal heat flow rising through an [[acre]] of [[granite]] terrain could be efficiently captured, it would light four 60 [[watt]] [[light bulb]]s.

A variation in surface temperature induced by [[climate change]]s and the [[Milankovitch cycle]] can penetrate below the Earth's surface and produce an oscillation in the geothermal gradient with periods varying from daily to tens of thousands of years and an amplitude which decreases with depth and having a scale depth of several kilometers.&lt;ref name="Stacey"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stacey|first=Frank D.|title=Physics of the Earth|edition=2nd|date=1977|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|isbn=0-471-81956-5}} pp. 183-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sleep"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sleep|first=Norman H.|author2=Kazuya Fujita|title=Principles of Geophysics|date=1997|publisher=Blackwell Science|isbn=0-86542-076-9}} pp. 187-9&lt;/ref&gt; Melt water from the [[polar ice caps]] flowing along ocean bottoms tends to maintain a constant geothermal gradient throughout the Earth's surface.&lt;ref name="Stacey"/&gt;

If the rate of temperature increase with depth observed in shallow boreholes were to persist at greater depths, temperatures deep within the Earth would soon reach the point where rocks would melt. We know, however, that the Earth's [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] is solid because of the transmission of [[S-waves]]. The temperature gradient dramatically decreases with depth for two reasons. First, the mechanism of thermal transport changes from [[Heat conduction|conduction]], as within the rigid tectonic plates, to [[convection]], in the portion of [[Earth's mantle]] that convects. Despite its [[solid]]ity, most of the Earth's mantle behaves over long time-scales as a [[fluid]], and heat is transported by [[advection]], or material transport. Second, [[Decay heat|radioactive heat]] production is concentrated within the crust of the Earth, and particularly within the upper part of the crust, as concentrations of [[uranium]], [[thorium]], and [[potassium]] are highest there: these three elements are the main producers of radioactive heat within the Earth. Thus, the geothermal gradient within the bulk of Earth's mantle is of the order of 0.5 kelvin per kilometer, and is determined by the [[adiabatic]] gradient associated with mantle material ([[peridotite]] in the upper mantle).&lt;ref name="T&amp;S 187"&gt;{{cite book|last=Turcotte|first=D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3357">In [[vacuum tube]] technology, '''HT''' or '''high tension''' describes the main power supply to the circuit, which produces the current between [[anode]] and [[cathode]]. It is also known as the '''plate''' supply or voltage, [[B battery]] supply, or simply labeled '''-&gt;B''' on [[circuit diagram]]s, from the days of [[battery (vacuum tube)|battery powered circuitry]].

The HT supply circuit most commonly provides a [[Electrical polarity|positive]] voltage of some hundreds of volts to the anode (or ''plate'') and in later circuits also to the [[screen grid]], with the cathode running at near ground or chassis potential. The main exception to this was in the case of tubes with water-cooled anodes, once used for [[radio transmission]], [[Induction furnace|electric furnace]]s and similar applications. These tubes used a negative HT supply to the cathode, so that the anode could run near ground DC potential (but typically at many hundreds of volts of [[radio frequency|RF]]).

Other power supplies to vacuum tube circuits include:

* LT, ''low tension'' or ''[[Battery (vacuum tube)#A battery|A battery]]'', the supply to the [[Heating element|filaments]] or heaters.  Early tubes designed for battery operation had 2&amp;nbsp;volt filaments (for use with a [[lead-acid battery|lead-acid]] cell).  Later tubes had 1.4&amp;nbsp;volt filaments to run from [[Zinc–carbon battery|dry batteries]].  With the introduction of mains powered equipment, indirectly heated tubes became more common and usually (though not always) required 4&amp;nbsp;volts in Europe and 6.3&amp;nbsp;volts in America.  The latter became the standard voltage after the [[Second world war]].  One notable exception was that rectifier tubes often had 5 volt filaments or heaters which usually had to have a separate supply anyway.
* GB, ''[[grid bias]]'' or ''[[Battery (vacuum tube)#C battery|C battery]]''. Used in early battery powered equipment. Once self biasing circuits were developed, this power source was no longer required.
* EHT, ''extra high tension'', the accelerator supply to a [[cathode ray tube]].  This supply typically ranges from 15 kV to 35 kV, though very early television receivers used voltages as low as 4 kV.

==Typical circuits==

===HT===
[[Image:VacRect2E.png|thumb|100px|Typical HT supply circuit schematic]]
The HT supply was usually obtained from a full wave rectifier circuit similar to the one shown.  In those sets that had no mains transformer (the so-called [[AC/DC receiver design|AC/DC]] design), the HT was obtained directly from the mains supply, either with a simple half wave rectifier or with a [[voltage doubler]] circuit.

===EHT===
In very early vacuum tube [[television set]]s, the EHT was derived directly from a high voltage winding on the mains transformer using a half wave recitifier.  In later television sets, the EHT supply was invariably generated by rectifying the flyback pulses from the scanning circuitry rather than directly from the mains supply (a practice that survived the transition to transistor circuits).  Although this provided a greater degree of safety, the reason for the change was that the mains transformer had been eliminated from sets produced from the 1940s onwards.

A '''hulder''' is a seductive forest creature found in [[Scandinavian folklore]]. (Her name derives from a root meaning "covered" or "secret".)&lt;ref&gt;AnneMarie Hellström, ''Jag vill så gärna berätta''. {{ISBN|91-7908-002-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Neil Gaiman]], ''[[American Gods]]'' (10th Anniversary Edition). {{ISBN|978-0-7553-8624-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Norwegian folklore, she is known as '''huldra''' ("the [archetypal] hulder", though folklore presupposes that there is an entire Hulder race and not just a single individual). She is known as the '''[[skogsrå]]''' "forest spirit" or '''Tallemaja''' "pine tree Mary" in Swedish folklore, and '''ulda''' in [[Sami people|Sámi]] folklore. Her name suggests that she is originally the same being as the [[völva]] divine figure [[Huld]] and the German [[Holda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nordisk familjebok|url=http://runeberg.org/nfbk/0659.html|website=runeberg.org|language=sv|date=1 January 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word hulder is only used of a female; a "male hulder" is called a ''huldrekall'' and also appears in Norwegian folklore. This being is closely related to other underground dwellers, usually called ''tusser'' (sg., ''tusse''). Whereas the female hulder is almost invariably described as incredible, seductive and beautiful, the males of the same race are often said to be hideous, with grotesquely long noses.

==Folklore==
The hulder is one of several ''[[rå]]'' (keeper, warden), including the aquatic ''[[sjörå]]'' or ''havsfru'', later identified with a [[mermaid]], and the ''[[bergsrå]]'' in caves and mines who made life tough for the poor miners.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

More information can be found in the collected Norwegian folktales of [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jørgen Moe]].

===Relations with humans===
[[Image:Troll woman.gif|thumb|A hulder is talking with a charcoal burner. She looks like a young farmer woman, but her tail is peeking out under her skirt. From ''Svenska folksägner'' (1882).]]
The hulders were held to be kind to charcoal burners, watching their charcoal kilns while they rested. Knowing that she would wake them if there were any problems, they were able to sleep, and in exchange they left provisions for her in a special place. A tale from [[Närke]] illustrates further how kind a hulder could be, especially if treated with respect (Hellström 1985:15).

===Origins===
Associated with Christianity, a tale recounts how a woman had washed only half of her children when God came to her cottage; ashamed of the dirty ones, she hid them.  God decreed that those she had hidden from him would be hidden from humanity; they became the hulders.&lt;ref&gt;K. M. Briggs, ''The Fairies in English Tradition and Literature'', p 147 [[University of Chicago Press]], London, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toponyms==
A multitude of places in Scandinavia are named after the Hulders, often places by legend associated with the presence of the "hidden folk". Here are some examples showing the wide distribution of Hulder-related toponyms between the northern and southern reaches of Scandinavia, and the terms usage in different language groups' toponyms.

===Danish===

* ''Huldremose'' (Hulder Bog) is a bog on [[Djursland]], [[Denmark]] famous for the discovery of the [[Huldremose Woman]], a bog body from 55BC.

===Norwegian===
* ''Hulderheim'' is southeast on the island [[Karlsøya, Troms]], [[Norway]]. The name means "Home of the Hulder".
* ''Hulderhusan'' is an area on the southwest of Norway's largest island [[Hinnøya]], whose name means "Houses of the Hulders".

===Sámi===
* ''Ulddaidvárri'' in [[Kvænangen]], [[Troms]] (Norway) means "Mountain of the Hulders" in North Sámi.
* ''Ulddašvággi'' is a valley southwest of [[Alta, Norway|Alta]] in [[Finnmark]], Norway. The name means "Hulder Valley" in North Sámi. The peak guarding the pass over from the valley to the mountains above has a similar name, Ruollačohkka, meaning "Troll Mountain"—and the large mountain presiding over the valley on its northern side is called Háldi, which is a term similar to the above-mentioned Norwegian rå, that is a spirit or local deity which rules a specific area.

==Parallels==
The hulder may be connected with the German ''[[holda]]''.

[[File:Waterhouse Hylas and the Nymphs Manchester Art Gallery 1896.15.jpg|thumb|400px]]
[[File:Waterhouse Hylas Nymphs study.jpg|thumb|Study for two nymphs]]

'''''Hylas and the Nymphs''''' is an 1896 oil painting by [[John William Waterhouse]].  The painting depicts a moment from the Greek and Roman legend of the tragic youth [[Hylas]], based on accounts by [[Ovid]] and other ancient writers, in which the [[Nympholepsy|enraptured]] Hylas is abducted by [[Naiad]]s (female water [[nymph]]s) while seeking drinking water.  The painting has been interpreted as a metaphor for dangerous female sexuality, and warning against [[nymphomania]].

Hylas was the son of King [[Theiodamas]] of the [[Dryopes|Dryopians]].  After [[Hercules]] killed Hylas's father, Hylas became a companion of Hercules and later his lover.  They both became [[Argonauts]], accompanying [[Jason]] in his quest on his ship ''[[Argo]]'' in seeking the [[Golden Fleece]].  During the journey, Hylas was sent to find fresh water.  He found a pond occupied by [[Naiad]]s, and they lured Hylas into the water and he disappeared.

The painting measures {{convert|98.2|x|163.3|cm}}.  It depicts Hylas, a male youth in classical garb, wearing a blue tunic with a red sash, and bearing a wide-necked water jar.  He is bending down beside a pond in a glade of lush green foliage, reaching out towards seven young women, the water nymphs, who are emerging from the pond among the leaves and flowers of [[Nymphaeaceae]] (water lilies), including an early depiction of the yellow waterlily, [[Nuphar lutea]]).  The nymphs are naked, their alabaster skin luminous in the dark but clear water, with yellow and white flowers in their auburn hair.  They have very similar physical features, perhaps based on just two models.

Hylas is being enticed to enter the water, from which he will not return.  One of the nymph holds his wrist and elbow, a second plucks at his tunic, and a third holds out some pearls in the palm of her hand.  The face of Hylas in profile is shadowed and barely visible, but the faces of the nymphs are clearly visible as they gaze upon him.  The scene is depicted from a slightly elevated position, looking down at the water like Hylas, so no sky is visible. Hylas's position forces the viewer's focus onto the nymphs in the water and the lack of reference to his relationship with Hercules emphasizes that the narrative of the painting is not about Hylas narrative, but about the sinister nature of the nymphs.

Some of Waterhouse's preparatory sketches are in the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in Oxford.

Hylas was a recurrent theme for British artists in the 19th and early 20th centuries, with examples by [[William Etty]] (1833) and [[Henrietta Rae]] (1910), and an earlier example by Waterhouse himself (1893).  Waterhouse also painted other tragic youths from Greek legend, such as [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]] in ''[[Echo and Narcissus (Waterhouse painting)|Echo and Narcissus]]'' (1903) (at the [[Walker Art Gallery]] in Liverpool). His poem "Hercules and Hylas" was published by [[Francis Burdett Thomas Coutts-Nevill]] in 1896.

The painting was acquired from the artist by the [[Manchester Art Gallery]] in 1896.  It was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition]] in 1897.

It was removed from display in gallery 10, "In Pursuit of Beauty", in early 2018 "to prompt conversations about how we display and interpret artworks in Manchester's public collection".  Visitors to the gallery were invited to fill the empty space left on the wall with sticky notes giving their reaction.  After an outcry, it was returned to the gallery after an absence of a few days.

'''Ionic potential''' is the [[ratio]] of [[electric charge]] to the [[ionic radius|radius]] of an [[ion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Ionic potential| url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/science/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/ionic-potential| place = A Dictionary of Earth Sciences 1999, originally published by Oxford University Press 1999| access-date = 17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, the proportion measures the [[charge density]] at the surface of the ion; usually the denser the charge, the stronger will be the [[ionic bond|bond]] that the ion forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Ionic potential| url = http://www.gly.uga.edu/railsback/Fundamentals/IonicPotential04P.pdf| access-date = 17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ionic potential gives the sense of how strongly or weakly the ion will be attracted, electrostatically, to ions of opposite charge; and to what extent the ion will repel other ions of like charge.

It measures the polarising power of a cation.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Perth, Western Australia]]) is an Australian yachtsman.

== Early years ==
Jonathan William Sanders grew up in Perth and in his teens and twenties, worked with shearing teams for 17 years. Initially he was a wool classer/shearing contractor, shearing team overseer and later owner of his own shearing team. He is characterised by his well-built stature and his shy and reserved demeanour and is a close friend and mentor of fellow Western Australian solo-sailor [[David Dicks]].

== Accomplishments ==
Jon Sanders was the first man to [[circumnavigation|circumnavigate]] [[Antarctica]] solo, circling the continent twice in 1981 – 1982. For this accomplishment, Gate 17 of the new Antarctica Cup Racetrack has been named after him, with sector 17 named after the [[S&amp;S 34]] monohull ''Perie Banou,'' the yacht he had used during the circumnavigation.&lt;ref name="Course"&gt;It is one of 18 gates and sectors within a circular race track bounded to the north by the [[Roaring Forties]] and the south by the [[Shrieking Sixties|Screaming Sixties]] latitudes.&lt;/ref&gt; Sanders Gate is positioned mid-way round the Indian Ocean zone; the gate is close to where Sanders suffered a 180-degree knockdown. During the voyage, he passed south of the three great capes: [[Cape Horn|Horn]], [[Cape of Good Hope|Good Hope]] and [[Cape Leeuwin|Leeuwin]], before rounding Cape Horn a second time. He turned north to [[Plymouth]], UK and returning south around Good Hope and returning to [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]].&lt;ref name="sailworld"&gt;
{{cite web
|title      = Gate named after Jon Sanders in Antarctica Cup

|publisher  = Sailworld.com
|date       = 5 November 2007
|accessdate = 24 February 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This voyage was recognised in the ''Guinness Book of Records'' through the following records:

*The first single-handed sailor to remain continuously at sea twice around the world 
*First single-handed sailor to round the five southern most Capes twice on one voyage 
*First single-handed sailor to round the five southern most Capes twice 
*Longest distance continuously sailed by any yacht: {{convert|48510|mi|km}}.
*Longest period alone at sea during a continuous voyage: 419 days: 22 hours: 10 minutes

In 1986 Sanders set out again from Fremantle, and this time completed three solo non-stop circumnavigations aboard his {{convert|47|ft|m|sing=on}} yacht ''[[Parry Endeavour]]'', rounding [[Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago]] just north of the [[Equator]] each time to ensure that his course covered both hemispheres.

Bob Williams, the Chairman of Antarctica Cup Management and the Antarctica Cup Ocean Race, says: "What Jon achieved during his double circumnavigation in 1981/82 was truly remarkable, given the technology available at the time and size of his yacht. I have had the greatest respect for Jon ever since watching him set off in a full gale off Plymouth at the start of the [[Parmelia Race]] in 1979 and was very pleased to be a contributing sponsor for his next yacht ''Parry Endeavour'' in 1986/87. His achievement is an inspiration to all long distance ocean racing sailors and we are very happy to honour Jon now by naming this Gate 17 Sanders Gate and Sector 17 after his yacht ''Perie Banou''"&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;

On 2 November 2016, Sanders set out from [[Carnarvon, Western Australia]] on his tenth circumnavigation, which he completed on 20 December 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jon Sanders completes Tenth Circumnavigation|url=http://www.mysailing.com.au/cruising/jon-sanders-completes-tenth-circumnavigation-of-the-world|website=mysailing.com.au|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  A live tracker of his progress is available [http://www.jonsanders.com.au/clientsat-predictwind-tracker/ here]

''Parry Endeavour'' is now in the [[WA Maritime Museum]], in [[Freemantle]], Western Australia.

== Other recognitions ==

Sanders was made an Officer in the Order of the British Empire for sailing in the 1983 New Year's Honours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article130839900|title=1983 NEW YEAR HONOURS LIST|date=1982-12-31|work=Canberra Times (ACT : 1926 - 1995)|access-date=2018-10-30|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was made an [[Officer of the Order of Australia]] (AO) in the [[1989 Australia Day Honours]] for "service to sailing and to marine science".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/886704|title=SANDERS, Jonathan William|last=|first=|date=|website=honours.pmc.gov.au|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanders was inducted into the Single-Handed Sailor's Hall of Fame in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], USA in 1991.

Sanders' records include: (From S-HSoF website)
* 1970 First solo circumnavigation trip east to west mostly sailing through tropics.
* 1981-82 Double nonstop solo circumnavigation west to east via Southern Ocean.
* Triple non-stop solo circumnavigation:
** 25 May 1986 left Fremantle headed east.
** 29 January 1987 Rendezvous off Fremantle to mark first circumnavigation.
** 13 March 1988 returned from 657 days 21 hours and 18 minutes at sea, completing three non-stop solo circumnavigations.
: The ''[[Guinness World Book of Records]]'' cites this as "the longest distance sailed non-stop by any vessel". (71,023 nautical miles)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Guinness World Records|date=2018|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/products/books/guinness-world-records-2018-edition/|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A road in [[Osborne Park, Western Australia]] bears his name in honour of his sailing accomplishments.

{{Canada provinces map|width=250px|map=Canadian National Parks.png|prefix=List of protected areas of|the=the|caption=Parks in Canada's provinces and territories}}

[[Canada]]'s [[National Parks of Canada|National Parks]] are [[protected area]]s under the ''[[National Parks Act (Canada)|Canada National Parks Act]]'', owned by the [[Government of Canada]] and administered for the benefit, education, and enjoyment of the people of Canada and its future generations.&lt;ref name=Act&gt;{{cite web |url= http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-14.01/FullText.html |title=''Canada National Parks Act'' S.C. 2000, c. 32 |date=October 12, 2000 |accessdate=January 25, 2018 |publisher=Government of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; National parks are administered by [[Parks Canada]], a [[Crown corporations of Canada|Crown agency]] operating under the jurisdiction of the [[Environment and Climate Change Canada|Ministry of Environment and Climate Change]]. The goal of the national parks system is to set aside lands representing the country's 39 distinct natural regions described in the ''National Parks System Plan'', primarily to protect the ecological integrity of the land, and secondarily to allow the public to explore, learn about and enjoy Canada's natural spaces.&lt;ref name="Intro"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/introduction|title=National Parks of Canada – Introduction|publisher=Parks Canada|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada's first national park was created in 1885 through an [[Order in Council|Order-in-Council]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/databases/orders/001022-119.01-e.php?&amp;sisn_id_nbr=30445&amp;page_sequence_nbr=1&amp;interval=20&amp;&amp;page_id_nbr=95575&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;PHPSESSID=crnkuooiktn602a9dnufmjbqg9mkba443c57qcpm9nspau4g8f40 |publisher=Library and Archives Canada |title=Order-in-Council #2197-1885 |date=November 25, 1885 |accessdate=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reserve {{cvt|26|sqkm}} over the [[Cave and Basin National Historic Site|Cave and Basin Hot Springs]] to prevent the land from being sold for private development despite claims being made for it. Modeled after the American experience with [[Yellowstone National Park]], the ''Rocky Mountains Park Act'', adopted in 1887, established the Rocky Mountains Park (now [[Banff National Park]]).&lt;ref name=Brief&gt;{{cite book |title= A Brief History of Canada's National Parks |last=Lothian |first= W.F. |url= http://parkscanadahistory.com/publications/history/lothian/brief/eng/brief-history.pdf |publisher= Environment Canada |date=1981 |isbn= 0-662-15217-4 |accessdate=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a national park was popular and led to numerous proposals for the [[Minister of the Interior (Canada)|Ministry of the Interior]] to consider, including additional sites along the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (e.g. Yoho and Glacier and an expansion of Banff) and the [[Grand Trunk Pacific Railway]] (e.g. Jasper). In 1911 the ''Rocky Mountains Park Act'' was replaced by the ''Dominion Forest Reserves and Parks Act'' which created the world's first national parks service, the Dominion Parks Branch, to administer national parks in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/travel/northamerica/article/990243--parks-canada-celebrates-a-century-of-discovery|title=Parks Canada celebrates a century of discovery|last=Irish|first=Paul|date=13 May 2011|work=Toronto Star|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early national parks, including those established under the leadership of [[James Bernard Harkin|JB Harkin]] who was the first commissioner of the Dominion Parks Branch, were set aside to reserve lands principally for tourism and conservation but also had an exclusionary policy prohibiting [[First Nations]] peoples from using their traditional lands within the new parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Binnema, Theodore; Niemi, Melanie |title='Let the line be drawn now': Wilderness, Conservation, and the Exclusion of Aboriginal People from Banff National Park in Canada|journal=Environmental History|year=2006|volume=11|issue=4|pages=724–50|doi=10.1093/envhis/11.4.724}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, [[Wood Buffalo National Park]] was the first to allow traditional indigenous activities to continue. In 1972, Parks Canada defined National Park Reserves, lands administered by the agency intended to become National Parks pending settlement of [[Aboriginal title in Canada|indigenous land rights]] and agreements for continued traditional use of the lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ictinc.ca/blog/can-first-nations-hunt-in-national-parks |title=Can First Nations hunt in national parks? |first=Bob |last=Joseph |publisher=Indigenous Corporate Training, Inc. |date=13 March 2015 |accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/agence-agency/aa-ia/faits-facts|title=Indigenous fact sheet|publisher=Parks Canada|date=23 June 2017|accessdate=13 December 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171211231012/https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/agence-agency/aa-ia/faits-facts|archivedate=11 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is at least one park located in every one of the nation's [[Provinces and territories of Canada|13 provinces and territories]]. Parks Canada reported attendance of 15,449,249 at all National Parks and Reserves in 2016–17, including over four million visits to the busiest park (Banff) and only two persons at the least-visited park ([[Tuktut Nogait National Park|Tuktut Nogait]]).&lt;ref name="attendance"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/docs/pc/attend |title=Parks Canada Attendance 2016–17 |publisher=Parks Canada |date=11 September 2017 |accessdate=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parks Canada additionally manages three [[National Marine Conservation Area]]s (NMCAs), a single NMCA Reserve, and the country's lone [[National Landmarks (Canada)|National Landmark]]. The ''Canada National Parks Act'' also allows for recognition of [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Sites]] that commemorate events, landmarks, or objects of national importance, and which may include similar levels of protection and administration as national parks.&lt;ref name=Act/&gt; Feasibility studies are underway to establish further national parks in unrepresented regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/cnpn-cnnp|title=Creating new national parks|publisher=Parks Canada|accessdate=13 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Marine Conservation Areas==
[[National Marine Conservation Areas]] (NMCAs) are a relatively new invention in the park system. The goal of the NMCA system is to preserve areas representing Canada's 29 marine regions as identified by Parks Canada.&lt;ref name="nmcaplan"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/amnc-nmca/cnamnc-cnnmca/carte-map-txt |title=Completing the National Marine Conservation Areas System |publisher=Parks Canada |date=30 March 2017 |accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are designed for sustainable use, although they usually also contain areas designed to protect [[ecological integrity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/amnc-nmca/plan|title=National Marine Conservation Area System|publisher=Parks Canada|date=20 July 2017|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lake Superior National Marine Conservation Area]], created in 2015, is the only unit that uses this designation in its name. [[Fathom Five National Marine Park]] was created in 1987, prior to the NMCA concept, and subsequently classified as an NMCA without changing its legal name. [[Saguenay–St. Lawrence Marine Park]] is jointly administered by Parks Canada and its Quebec counterpart, [[Société des établissements de plein air du Québec|Sépaq]]. National Marine Conservation Area Reserves are protected areas proposed to be added to the NMCA system pending settlement of indigenous land and water rights. In the interim, they are administered under park rules.

{{As of|2018}}, established NMCAs and NMCA Reserves protect {{cvt|14,846|sqkm}} of waters, wetlands, and coastlines, representing five of the 29 identified marine regions with studies underway for protected areas in three additional regions.&lt;ref name="nmcaplan"/&gt;

==National Landmark==
In addition to national parks, a [[National Landmarks (Canada)|National Landmarks]] program was established in 1978 but has not yet been expanded beyond a single property. Landmarks were intended to protect specific natural features considered "outstanding, exceptional, unique, or rare to this country. These natural features would typically be isolated entities and of scientific interest."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/lhn-nhs/nt/pingo/info/sec6|title=Pingo Canadian Landmark – Park Management|publisher=Parks Canada|date=15 June 2017|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provincial parks are administered and funded by the provincial governments, however some provincial parks are categorized as ''[[national park]]s'' (Category II) under the [[IUCN]]'s Protected Area Management Categories.

[[Gatineau Park]] in [[Quebec]] is another park under the jurisdiction of the federal government. However, it is managed by the [[National Capital Commission]], not Parks Canada, and is not considered part of the national parks system.

[[Image:Mount Logan.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Mount Logan]] in the [[Saint Elias Mountains]] of [[Yukon]] is the [[topographic elevation|highest]] [[summit (topography)|peak]] of [[Canada]].]]

The following sortable table comprises the '''150 [[Elevation|highest]] [[Summit|mountain peaks]] of [[Canada]] with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5}} of [[topographic prominence]]'''.&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]], and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  All summits in this article have at least 500&amp;nbsp;meters of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=range/&gt;&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite far away.  The key col for [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in [[Nicaragua]], {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Five major Canadian summits exceed {{convert|5000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5}}, 11 exceed {{convert|4500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5}} elevation, [[List of the major 4000-metre summits of Canada|19 exceed {{convert|4000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5}}]], 41 exceed {{convert|3500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5}}, [[List of the major 3000-metre summits of Canada|67 exceed {{convert|3000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5}}]], and 125 major summits exceed {{convert|2500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5}} elevation.

==Highest major summits==
{{GeoGroup|section=Highest major summits}}
{{see also|List of the major 4000-metre summits of Canada|List of the major 3000-metre summits of Canada}}
Of these 150 highest major summits of Canada, 102 are located in British Columbia, 37 in Yukon, 13 in Alberta, two in Nunavut, and one in the Northwest Territories.  Three of these summits lie on the British Columbia-Alberta border and two lie on the British Columbia-Yukon border.  Five of these summits lie on the international Yukon-Alaska border and five lie on the international British Columbia-Alaska border.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2109">A '''lithospheric drip''' is a geological phenomenon in which a dense and relatively cold mass of [[lithosphere]] sinks into the more fluid [[upper mantle]]. The regions of descending material have been detected by [[seismic tomography]] methods and modeled as near vertically oriented cylindrical masses within the upper mantle.

'''Marble''' is a [[metamorphic rock]] composed of recrystallized [[carbonate minerals]], most commonly [[calcite]] or [[dolomite]]. Marble is typically not [[Foliation (geology)|foliated]], although there are exceptions. In [[geology]], the term "marble" refers to metamorphosed [[limestone]], but its use in [[stonemasonry]] more broadly encompasses unmetamorphosed limestone.&lt;ref&gt;Kearey, Philip (2001). ''Dictionary of Geology'', Penguin Group, London and New York, p. 163. {{ISBN|978-0-14-051494-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marble is commonly used for [[Marble sculpture|sculpture]] and as a [[architecture|building]] material.

The word "marble" derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|μάρμαρον}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|mármaron}}),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pberseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dma%2Frmaron μάρμαρον], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang|grc|μάρμαρος}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|mármaros}}), "crystalline rock, shining stone",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dma%2Frmaros μάρμαρος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/marble?view=uk Marble, Compact Oxford English Dictionary].

This [[Stem (linguistics)|stem]] is also the ancestor of the English word "marmoreal", meaning "marble-like."{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} While the English term "marble" resembles the [[French language|French]] {{lang|fr|marbre}}, most other [[European languages]] (with words like "marmoreal"),  more closely resemble the original Ancient Greek.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Physical origins==

Marble is a rock resulting from [[metamorphism]] of [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] [[carbonate rock]]s, most commonly [[limestone]] or [[dolostone|dolomite rock]]. Metamorphism causes variable recrystallization of the original carbonate mineral grains. The resulting marble rock is typically composed of an interlocking mosaic of carbonate [[crystal]]s. Primary sedimentary textures and structures of the original carbonate rock ([[protolith]]) have typically been modified or destroyed.

Pure white marble is the result of metamorphism of a very pure ([[Silicate minerals|silicate]]-poor) limestone or dolomite protolith. The characteristic swirls and [[Vein (geology)|vein]]s of many colored marble varieties are usually due to various mineral impurities such as [[clay]], [[silt]], [[sand]], [[iron oxide]]s, or [[chert]] which were originally present as grains or layers in the limestone. Green coloration is often due to [[Serpentine group|serpentine]] resulting from originally magnesium-rich limestone or dolostone with [[silica]] impurities. These various impurities have been mobilized and recrystallized by the intense pressure and heat of the metamorphism.

===Sculpture===
White marble has been prized for its use in [[marble sculpture|sculptures]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7zKJOYkW0GsC&amp;pg=PA371&amp;dq=%22white+marble%22+prized+for+use+to+make+sculptures&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSna_Y5pXUAhUmw1QKHbcRDRMQ6AEIMTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22white%20marble%22%20prized%20for%20use%20to%20make%20sculptures&amp;f=false|title=PROCEEDINGS 4th International Congress on “Science and Technology for the Safeguard of Cultural Heritage in the Mediterranean Basin” VOL. I|publisher=Angelo Ferrari|isbn=9788896680315|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; since [[Classical antiquity|classical times]]. This preference has to do with its softness, which made it easier to carve, relative [[isotropy]] and homogeneity, and a relative resistance to shattering. Also, the low [[Refractive index|index of refraction]] of calcite allows light to penetrate several millimeters into the stone before being scattered out, resulting in the characteristic waxy look which gives "life" to marble sculptures of any kind, which is why many sculptors preferred and still prefer marble for sculpting.

===Construction marble===
Construction marble is a stone which is composed of calcite, dolomite or serpentine which is capable of taking a polish.&lt;ref&gt;Marble Institute of America pp. 223 Glossary&lt;/ref&gt; More generally in [[construction]], specifically the [[dimension stone]] trade, the term "marble" is used for any crystalline calcitic rock (and some non-calcitic rocks) useful as building stone. For example, [[Tennessee marble]] is really a dense granular fossiliferous gray to pink to maroon [[Ordovician]] limestone, that [[geology|geologists]] call the [[Holston Formation]].

[[Ashgabat]], the capital city of [[Turkmenistan]], was recorded in the 2013 ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' as having the world's highest concentration of white marble buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/26/turkmenistan-world-record-white-marble-buildings |title=Turkmenistan enters record books for having the most white marble buildings &amp;#124; World news |publisher=theguardian.com |date= 2013-05-26|accessdate=2013-11-24 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
According to the [[United States Geological Survey]], U.S. domestic marble production in 2006 was 46,400 tons valued at about $18.1 million, compared to 72,300 tons valued at $18.9 million in 2005. Crushed marble production (for aggregate and industrial uses) in 2006 was 11.8 million tons valued at $116 million, of which 6.5 million tons was finely ground [[calcium carbonate]] and the rest was [[construction aggregate]]. For comparison, 2005 crushed marble production was 7.76 million tons valued at $58.7 million, of which 4.8 million tons was finely ground calcium carbonate and the rest was construction aggregate. U.S. dimension marble demand is about 1.3 million tons. The DSAN World Demand for (finished) Marble Index has shown a growth of 12% annually for the 2000–2006 period, compared to 10.5% annually for the 2000–2005 period. The largest dimension marble application is tile.

In 1998, marble production was dominated by 4 countries that accounted for almost half of world production of marble and decorative stone. Italy and China were the world leaders, each representing 16% of world production, while Spain and India produced 9% and 8%, respectively. [[Italy]] is the world leader in marble export, with 20% share in global marble production, followed by [[China]] with 16%, [[India]] with 10%, [[Spain]] with 6%, and [[Portugal]] with 5%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tunisianindustry.nat.tn/en/download/CEPI/IMCCV02.pdf Strategic positioning study of the marble branch]. CEPI Brief N° 6. tunisianindustry.nat.tn&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupational safety===

Dust produced by cutting marble could cause lung disease but more research needs to be carried out on whether dust filters and other safety products reduce this risk.&lt;ref&gt;Foja, A.F. (1993)  [http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=PH9410698 Marble industry: its socioeconomic, environmental and health effects among marble worker/producer households in Romblon]. Philippines University Thesis. fao.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the legal limit ([[permissible exposure limit]]) for marble exposure in the workplace as 15&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; total exposure and 5&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 10&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; total exposure and 5&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC – NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards – Marble|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0382.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Degradation by acids==
[[Acid]]s damage marble, because the calcium carbonate in marble reacts with them, releasing [[carbon dioxide]] (technically speaking, [[carbonic acid]], but that disintegrates quickly to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) :
:CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(s) + 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) → Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l)

Thus, [[vinegar]] or other acidic solutions should never be used on marble. Likewise, outdoor marble statues, [[headstone|gravestones]], or other marble structures are damaged by [[acid rain]].

==Microbial degradation==
The haloalkaliphilic methylotrophic bacterium ''[[Methylophaga murata]]'' was isolated from deteriorating marble in the [[Kremlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=16211855|title=Methylophaga murata sp. nov.: a haloalkaliphilic aerobic methylotroph from deteriorating marble|date=2005|volume=74|journal=Mikrobiologiia|author1=Doronina NV|author2=Li TsD|author3= Ivanova EG|author4=Trotsenko IuA.|issue=4|pages=511–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacterial and fungal degradation was detected in four samples of marble from Milan cathedral; black ''[[Cladosporium]]'' attacked dried [[acrylic resin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17658586|title=Bacterial and fungal deterioration of the Milan Cathedral marble treated with protective synthetic resins|journal=Science of the Total Environment|year=2007|author1=Cappitelli F|author2=Principi P|author3=Pedrazzani R|author4=Toniolo L|author5=Sorlini C|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2007.06.022|volume=385|issue=1–3|pages=172–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; using melanin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17071788|title=Synthetic consolidants attacked by melanin-producing fungi: case study of the biodeterioration of Milan (Italy) cathedral marble treated with acrylics|author1=Cappitelli F|author2=Nosanchuk JD|author3=Casadevall A|author4=Toniolo L|author5=Brusetti L|author6=Florio S,|author7=Principi P|author8=Borin S|author9=Sorlini C|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|date=Jan 2007|volume=73|issue=1|pages=271–7|doi=10.1128/AEM.02220-06|pmc=1797126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the favorite medium for Greek and Roman sculptors and architects (see [[classical sculpture]]), marble has become a cultural [[symbol]] of tradition and refined taste. Its extremely varied and colorful patterns make it a favorite decorative material, and it is often imitated in background patterns for [[computer display]]s, etc.

Places named after the stone include [[Marblehead, Massachusetts]]; [[Marblehead, Ohio]]; [[Marble Arch]], London; the [[Sea of Marmara]]; India's [[Marble Rocks]]; and the towns of [[Marble, Minnesota]]; [[Marble, Colorado]]; [[Marble Falls, Texas]], and [[Marble Hill, Manhattan, New York]]. The [[Elgin Marbles]] are marble sculptures from the [[Parthenon]] in Athens that are on display in the [[British Museum]]. They were brought to Britain by the [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin|Earl of Elgin]].

==Artificial marble==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Marble dust is combined with cement or synthetic resins to make ''reconstituted'' or ''[[cultured marble]]''. The appearance of marble can be simulated with [[faux marbling]], a painting technique that imitates the stone's color patterns.

[[File:Angus-Montrose.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Location of Montrose, Angus, Scotland]]
[[File:MASHC_layout3.png|thumb|Layout of Montrose Air Station Heritage Centre]]

The '''Montrose Air Station Heritage Centre''' is located to the North of [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]], [[Angus, Scotland]]. Montrose has the distinction of having the first operational military [[airfield]] in [[Great Britain]] and the Heritage Centre is located on the former airfield. It aims to show the human side of its history with a collection of contemporary photographs, artefacts and memorabilia. These not only tell of the history of the airfield but also the story of the men and women who served there and those who lived in the area.

The [[Royal Air Force station|Air Station]] [[Heritage centre|Heritage Centre]] is run by the Ian McIntosh Memorial Trust and is a registered [[Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator|Scottish charitable organisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Scottish charity|SC023193|The Ian McIntosh Memorial Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is self-financing, relying on visitors fees and donations together with grants from local government and the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]]. The centre receives no regular financial support from local or national government.&lt;ref name=MASHC&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.rafmontrose.org.uk/|work=Montrose Air Station|publisher=Montrose Air Station}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main article|RAF Montrose}}
The airfield was first opened on 1913 when five aircraft of [[No. 2 Squadron RAF|No.2 Squadron]] Royal Flying Corps arrived. Montrose became the first operational military airfield in Great Britain and first military airfield in Scotland.&lt;ref name=Reocities&gt;{{cite web|title=Montrose|url=http://www.reocities.com/pentagon/barracks/6344/montrose.htm|work=Disused WWII Airfields in the N.E. Scotland|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The air station closed in 1920 but was reopened in 1935 for use in the Second World War. After the war the airfield continued to be used as a maintenance unit until it closed on 4 June 1952.&lt;ref name=Ronaldv&gt;{{cite web|title=Abandoned &amp; Little-Known Airfields in Europe|url=http://www.ronaldv.nl/abandoned/airfields/gb/scotland/tayside.html|publisher=Ronaldv.nl|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABCT&gt;{{cite web|title=Airfields of Britain Conservation Trust|url=http://www.abct.org.uk/airfields/montrose?tab=memorial|publisher=ABCT|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 a group of local enthusiast banded together to ensure that the history of Montrose Air Station would not be forgotten. A local man, Ian McIntosh, established the Montrose Air Station Heritage Trust, now known as the Ian McIntosh Memorial Trust and money was raised by the Montrose Aerodrome Museum Society.&lt;ref name=LTFAM&gt;{{cite book|title=Learning to Fly at Montrose|year=2005|publisher=Ian McIntosh Memorial Trust|location=Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 the trust purchased the Watch Office and ground which became the Montrose Air Station Museum. Over the years the museum has added more buildings to house its increasing collection of artefacts, memorabilia and models aided by donations, local government grants and the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]].&lt;ref name=HLF1&gt;{{cite news|title=Lottery Boost for Museum|url=http://www.montrosereview.co.uk/news/local-headlines/163-48-000-lottery-boos-for-museum-1-342989|accessdate=3 April 2013|newspaper=Montrose Review|date=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 May 2012 a memorial stone was unveiled at the air station in remembrance of the units and personnel who were stationed there. The memorial was provided by the [[Airfields of Britain Conservation Trust]].&lt;ref name=ABCT /&gt;

===Training Pilots for War===
This project was supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund&lt;ref name=HLF1 /&gt;  as well as local benefactors. It commenced in June 2010 and involved extending the Romney Building to create room for new facilities. These included a [[Link Trainer]], computer flight simulator and a learning zone with audio and video resources. It was completed in October 2012.&lt;ref name=Youtube1&gt;{{cite web|title=End of Pilot Training Project|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn5beiRx4jw|work=YouTube|publisher=Montrose Air Station Heritage Centre|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Spitfire Fund===
Similar to the wartime Spitfire Funds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spitfire Funds|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/spitfire_funds.htm|work=HistoryLearningSite.co.uk|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  this was to raise money to purchase a full size replica Spitfire. Additional funding from Angus Council&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spitfire bid could take off with backing|url=http://www.montrosereview.co.uk/community/spitfire-bid-could-take-off-with-backing-1-2115941|accessdate=3 April 2013|newspaper=Montrose Review|date=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  has enabled the purchase of the Spitfire which now sits at the front of the main building. The Aircraft, made by GB Replicas, stands as a monument to the many people who served there during two World Wars. It is in the colours and markings of the [[No. 602 Squadron RAF|602 Squadron]] ([[City of Glasgow]]) Red Lichtie Spitfire.&lt;ref name=RedLichtie&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arbroath Spitfire|url=http://www.thearbroathspitfire.com/|publisher=Squadron Prints Ltd|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Red Lichtie was purchased in 1942 by the people of [[Arbroath]], Angus after they started a Spitfire fund and raised £5000.&lt;ref name=RedLichtie /&gt;
On 26 July 2013 HRH [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex]] visited the Heritage Centre and unveiled the Spitfire and a commemorative stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STV News Earl of Wessex meets veterans as air station celebrates 100th anniversary|url=http://news.stv.tv/tayside/234205-earl-of-wessex-meets-veterans-as-montrose-air-station-celebrates-100-years/|accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arbroath Spitfire|url=http://www.thearbroathspitfire.com//|accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First in France 1914===
The first pilot to land in France after the declaration of war was Lieutenant [[H.D. Harvey-Kelly]] of No.2 Squadron RFC Montrose.The project is named after this event. A new building has been erected which will house the centre’s artefacts from World War I including the Robertson Cross and the replica [[Sopwith Camel]]. They have also constructed a full size replica [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2|B.E.2a aircraft]] and put together a comprehensive exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Big boost for air station|url=http://www.montrosereview.co.uk/news/local-headlines/big-boost-for-air-station-1-3352953|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also part of this project will involve the production of a Roll of Honour, an 'online' Book of Remembrance for pilots who were killed in accidents whilst flying at Montrose Air Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tribute to Fallen Pilots|url=http://www.montrosereview.co.uk/lifestyle/entertainment/online-tribute-to-fallen-pilots-1-2631026|accessdate=3 April 2013|newspaper=Montrose Review|date=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The First in France 1914 project is supported by the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]].

===Jack Drummond Workshop and Store===
This is named after [[Leading aircraftman|LAC]] Jack Drummond who was posted to Montrose in 1937. The [[Nissen hut]] is used for restoration projects and houses working machinery. For safety reasons it is not open to the public.

===John Betty Library and Research Centre===
Named after [[Squadron Leader]] John Betty, former Chief [[Flying Instructor]] at RAF Montrose, the library houses the largest private collection of aviation books in Scotland and the Heritage Centre’s archives. It is accessible to visitors by arrangement and will eventually provide computer access to archives in the future for family history research.

===David Butler Building===
This building, a Romney Hut funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, was named after David Butler who was a founder member of the Heritage Centre. It houses the Miles M.2H Hawk Major, T.22 de Havilland Sea Vampire and link trainer together with a display of [[aircraft engine]]s. There is also a Pilot Training Display including a computer flight simulator and a Learning Zone for visits from local schools.

===Lt John Ross Robertson Building===
The Heritage Centre's newest building was erected in July 2014 and funded by the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]]. It was officially opened by the [[Lord Lieutenant of Angus]], Mrs Georgiana Osborne, on 3 August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Montrose marks the centenary of WW1|url=http://www.montrosereview.co.uk/news/local-headlines/montrose-marks-the-centenary-of-ww1-1-3502236|publisher=Montrose Review|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Heritage Centres World War I artefacts are on display in the building together with its full size replica [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2|B.E.2a]] and [[Sopwith Camel]] aircraft. The building is named after Lt Robertson who learned to fly at Montrose and was killed in action on his fourth mission 5 months later on 12 May 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lieut John Ross Robertson|url=http://warmemscot.s4.bizhat.com/warmemscot-ftopic5196.html|publisher=The Scottish War Memorials Project|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried by the Germans and the cross they made for his grave is now on display in the building. It stands as a memorial not just for Lt Robertson but to all the people who served at Montrose.

===Historic airfield buildings nearby===
To the immediate south of the Heritage Centre stand three aircraft hangars which are believed to be the oldest known example of their type in the world. The hangars were built at the end of 1913 and first used in early 1914 to house No. 2 Squadron when they moved to the airfield from Upper Dysart. Their design was based on Indian Army Sheds modified by Major Burke to house aircraft and were pre-fabricated in Glasgow before being transported to Montrose. The buildings were constructed of wood with corrugated iron roofs and each one had two gabled openings. The hangars were built in a curve following the path of railway line which used to be at the rear of the buildings.

The hangar farthest away from the heritage centre retains its original cladding. The building is a category:A [[Listed Building]]&lt;ref name="britishlistedbuildings3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/sc-38228-montrose-air-station-building-48-|title=Montrose Air Station Building 48 - Montrose - Angus - Scotland &amp;#124; British Listed Buildings|author=Good Stuff IT Services|publisher=britishlistedbuildings.co.uk|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Historic Scotland]] Building ID: 38228

The other two hangars have had a steel cladding added in 1987-8 and are category:B Listed Buildings &lt;ref name="britishlistedbuildings4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/sc-38227-montrose-air-station-buildings-46-and-47-|title=Montrose Air Station Buildings 46 and 47 - Montrose - Angus - Scotland &amp;#124; British Listed Buildings|author=Good Stuff IT Services|publisher=britishlistedbuildings.co.uk|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Historic Scotland Building ID: 38227

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9393">Significant reserves of '''[[natural gas]]''' were found offshore from the '''[[Gaza Strip]]'''. As of early 2015, Gaza's natural gas was still underwater and the same for almost all of the Levantine gas.&lt;ref name=Schwartz-2015-02-TomDispatch&gt;[[Michael Schwartz (sociologist)|Schwartz, Michael]] (February 2015). [http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175961/tomgram%3A_michael_schwartz%2C_israel%2C_gaza%2C_and_energy_wars_in_the_middle_east/ The Great Game in the Holy Land - How Gazan Natural Gas Became the Epicenter of An International Power Struggle]. ''[[Tom Engelhardt|TomDispatch]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Palestinians signed a memorandum of intent on November 8, 1999 with [[British Gas]] and a company linked to the Palestinian Authority, the [[Consolidated Contractors Company]], giving them rights to explore the area.&lt;ref name="offshore" &gt;[http://www.offshore-technology.com/features/featurepalestine-offshore-gas-projects-mediterranean-sea 'Focus on Palestine: offshore gas projects in the East Mediterranean Sea,'] Offshore technology.com, 4 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rand" &gt;Steven W. Popper, Claude Berrebi, James Griffin, Thomas Light, Endy Y. Min, [https://books.google.it/books?id=dMtllbFoH9UC&amp;pg=PA11  ''Natural Gas and Israel's Energy Future: Near-Term Decisions from a Strategic Perspective,''] [[Rand Corporation]], 2009 p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; The discovered natural gas reserve was calculated to have 35 BCM, larger than Israel's Yam Tethys maritime gas field.&lt;ref name="Rand" /&gt; It was found in two small gas fields dubbed Gaza Marine 1 and Gaza Marine 2.

In 1999, Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]] set aside exploration of Gaza's offshore resources for a future Palestinian state, with no prior consultation with Israel stipulated.&lt;ref name="offshore" /&gt; According to [[Michael Schwartz (sociologist)|Michael Schwartz]], Barak deployed the Israeli navy in Gaza's coastal waters to impede the implementation of the terms of the modest contract between the Palestinian Authority and British Gas (BG) to develop Gaza's Mediterranean gas resources.&lt;ref name=Schwartz-2015-02-TomDispatch/&gt; Israel demanded that the Gaza gas be piped to facilities on its territory, and at a price below the prevailing market level&lt;ref name="Nafeez" &gt;Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed, [http://mondediplo.com/blogs/israel-s-war-for-gaza-s-gas 'Israel’s War for Gaza’s Gas,'] [[Le Monde diplomatique]], November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and that Israel also control all the (relatively modest) revenues destined for the Palestinians — to prevent the money from being used to "fund terror." In Schwartz's view, with this Israeli action the Oslo Accords were officially doomed, because by declaring Palestinian control over gas revenues unacceptable, the Israeli government committed itself to not accepting even the most limited kind of Palestinian budgetary autonomy, let alone full sovereignty. In Schwartz's view, since no Palestinian government or organization would agree to this, a future filled with armed conflict was assured.&lt;ref name=Schwartz-2015-02-TomDispatch/&gt;

The Israeli veto led to the intervention of British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who sought to broker an agreement that would satisfy both the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority. The result was a 2007 proposal that would have delivered the gas to Israel, not Egypt, at below-market prices, with the same 10% cut of the revenues eventually reaching the Palestinian Authority. However, those funds were first to be delivered to the Federal Reserve Bank in New York for future distribution, to guarantee that they would not be used for attacks on Israel.&lt;ref name=Schwartz-2015-02-TomDispatch/&gt;

==Development status under Hamas administration==
The Israelis pointed to the 2006 victory of the militant [[Hamas]] party in Palestinian elections as a deal-breaker. Though Hamas had agreed to let the Federal Reserve supervise all spending, the Israeli government, now led by [[Ehud Olmert]], insisted that no "royalties be paid to the Palestinians." Instead, the Israelis would deliver the equivalent of those funds "in goods and services."&lt;ref name=Schwartz-2015-02-TomDispatch/&gt; 
The Hamas-led [[Palestinian National Unity Government of March 2007|Palestinian unity government]] refused the offer, and soon after, Olmert imposed a blockade on Gaza, which Israel's defense minister termed a form of "'economic warfare' that would generate a political crisis, leading to a popular uprising against Hamas." With Egyptian cooperation, Israel then seized control of commerce in and out of Gaza, limiting even food imports and eliminating its fishing industry. Olmert advisor [[Dov Weisglass]] summed up this policy by saying the Israeli government was putting the Palestinians "on a diet." According to the Red Cross, this blockade produced "chronic malnutrition," especially among Gazan children.&lt;ref name=Schwartz-2015-02-TomDispatch/&gt;

The Palestinians still refused to accept Israel's terms, and the Olmert government decided to unilaterally extract the gas, something that, they believed, could only occur once Hamas had been displaced or disarmed.{{dubious|date=September 2017}} As [[Moshe Ya'alon]] explained, "Hamas... has confirmed its capability to bomb Israel's strategic gas and electricity installations... It is clear that, without an overall military operation to uproot Hamas control of Gaza, no drilling work can take place without the consent of the radical Islamic movement."&lt;ref name=Schwartz-2015-02-TomDispatch/&gt; [[Operation Cast Lead]], launched in the winter of 2008, did not achieve the goal of "transferring the sovereignty of the gas fields to Israel."&lt;ref name=Schwartz-2015-02-TomDispatch/&gt;{{dubious|date=September 2017}}

In 2010-11, the Israeli government of Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] faced an energy crisis when the events of the [[Arab Spring]] in Egypt interrupted and then stopped 40% of Israel's gas supplies. Rising energy prices contributed to some of the largest protests involving Jewish Israelis in decades.&lt;ref name=Schwartz-2015-02-TomDispatch/&gt; Israel's Resource Minister asserted that "[t]hese areas are within the economic waters of Israel... We will not hesitate to use our force and strength to protect not only the rule of law but the international maritime law."&lt;ref name=Schwartz-2015-02-TomDispatch/&gt;

The [[Iron Dome]] system, developed in part to stop [[Hezbollah]] rockets aimed at Israel's northern gas fields, was put in place near the border with Gaza and was tested during [[Operation Returning Echo]], the fourth Israeli military attempt to weaken Hamas and eliminate any Palestinian "capability to bomb Israel's strategic gas and electricity installations."&lt;ref name=Schwartz-2015-02-TomDispatch/&gt;

The next round of negotiations stalled over the Palestinian rejection of Israel's demand to control all fuel and revenues destined for Gaza and the [[West Bank]]. The new Palestinian Unity government then followed the lead of the Lebanese, Syrians, and Turkish Cypriots, and in late 2013 signed an "exploration concession" with [[Gazprom]], the large Russian natural gas company. As with Lebanon and Syria, the Russian Navy was a potential deterrent to Israeli "interference."&lt;ref name=Schwartz-2015-02-TomDispatch/&gt;

With Gazprom's move to develop the Palestinian-claimed gas deposits on the horizon, the Israelis launched their fifth military effort "to force Palestinian acquiescence," [[Operation Protective Edge]].{{dubious|date=September 2017}} The operation "had two major hydrocarbon-related goals: to deter Palestinian-Russian plans and to finally eliminate the Gazan rocket systems." The first goal was apparently met when Gazprom postponed its development deal. However, "the two-pronged land and air attack -- despite unprecedented devastation in Gaza -- failed to destroy Hamas's rocket stockpiles or its tunnel-based assembly system; nor did the Iron Dome achieve the sort of near-perfect interception rate needed to protect proposed energy installations."&lt;ref name=Schwartz-2015-02-TomDispatch/&gt;

As of early 2015, Gaza's natural gas was still underwater and the same for almost all of the Levantine gas.&lt;ref name=Schwartz-2015-02-TomDispatch&gt;[[Michael Schwartz (sociologist)|Schwartz, Michael]] (February 2015). [http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175961/tomgram%3A_michael_schwartz%2C_israel%2C_gaza%2C_and_energy_wars_in_the_middle_east/ The Great Game in the Holy Land - How Gazan Natural Gas Became the Epicenter of An International Power Struggle]. ''[[Tom Engelhardt|TomDispatch]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the [[Palestinian government]] resumed negotiations on the agreement with BG and abrogated the exclusive rights it had given to the company. It also raised the PIF share from 10% under the old agreement to 17.5%. Subsequently, Shell acquired BG on April 8, 2016.&lt;ref name=almonitor/&gt;

As of 2017, the Gaza Marine field licenses were owned by PIF with 17.5% of the field development rights, Consolidated Contractors Company owns 27.5% of these rights and Shell 55%.&lt;ref name=almonitor&gt;[http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/03/palestine-gaza-gas-field-energy-power-crisis-talks.html#ixzz4rsGdB7G9]&lt;/ref&gt; The development and gas extraction rights belong to the [[State of Palestine|Palestinians]] alone.&lt;ref name=almonitor/&gt;

[[Image:Ondes compression 2d 20 petit.gif|thumb|305px|Representation of the propagation of a P-wave on a 2D grid (empirical shape){{clarify|date=November 2017}}]]

A '''P-wave''' is one of the two main types of elastic [[Body wave (seismology)|body waves]], called [[seismic waves]] in seismology. P-waves travel faster than other seismic waves and hence are the first signal from an earthquake to arrive at any affected location or at a [[seismograph]]. P-waves [[Continuum mechanics|may be transmitted through]] gases, liquids, or solids.

==Nomenclature==
The name P-wave can stand for either '''pressure wave''' (as it is formed from alternating [[compression (physical)|compression]]s and [[rarefaction]]s) or '''primary wave''' (as it has high velocity and is therefore the first wave to be recorded by a seismograph).&lt;ref name="John"&gt;{{cite book|last=Milsom|first=J.|title=Field Geophysics|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2003|series=The geological field guide series|volume=25|page=232|isbn=978-0-470-84347-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7CKj8bqVlwC&amp;pg=PA179|accessdate=2010-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[isotropic]] and homogeneous solids, the mode of propagation of a P-wave is always [[Longitudinal wave|longitudinal]]; thus, the particles in the solid vibrate along the axis of propagation (the direction of motion) of the wave energy.

==Seismic waves in the Earth==
{{See also|Core-mantle boundary|Mohorovičić discontinuity|Low-velocity zone|Lehmann discontinuity}}
[[File:Speeds of seismic waves.PNG|thumb|300px|Velocity of seismic waves in the Earth versus depth.&lt;ref name=Helffrich&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Nature |year=2002 |volume=412 |issue=2 August |pages=501–7 |title=The Earth's Mantle |author=GR Helffrich &amp; BJ Wood |url=http://www.phys.uu.nl/~sommer/master/Structure%20and%20Evolution/articles%20for%20presentation/9.pdf | doi=10.1038/35087500 |pmid=11484043 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The negligible ''S''-wave velocity in the outer core occurs because it is liquid, while in the solid inner core the ''S''-wave velocity is non-zero.]]

Primary and  secondary waves are body waves that travel within the Earth. The motion and behavior of both ''P''-type and ''S''-type in the Earth are monitored to probe the interior [[structure of the Earth]]. Discontinuities in velocity as a function of depth are indicative of changes in phase or composition. Differences in arrival times of waves originating in a seismic event like an earthquake as a result of waves taking different paths allow mapping of the Earth's inner structure.&lt;ref name=Negendank&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===P-wave shadow zone===
[[Image:Earthquake wave shadow zone.svg|thumb|P-wave shadow zone (from [[USGS]])]]
Almost all the information available on the structure of the Earth's deep interior is derived from observations of the travel times, [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]]s, [[refraction]]s and phase transitions of seismic body waves, or [[normal modes]]. P-waves travel through the fluid layers of the [[Earth#Interior|Earth's interior]], and yet they are refracted slightly when they pass through the transition between the semisolid [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] and the liquid [[Earth#The core|outer core]]. As a result, there is a P-wave "[[shadow zone]]" between 103° and 142°&lt;ref&gt;Lowrie, William. ''The Fundamentals of Geophysics''. Cambridge University Press, 1997, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; from the earthquake's focus, where the initial P-waves are not registered on seismometers. In contrast, S-waves do not travel through liquids, rather, they are [[Attenuation|attenuated]].

===As an earthquake warning===

Advance earthquake warning is possible by detecting the nondestructive primary waves that travel more quickly through the Earth's crust than do the destructive [[S-waves|secondary]] and [[Rayleigh wave]]s.

The amount of advance warning depends on the delay between the arrival of the P-wave and other destructive waves, generally on the order of seconds up to about 60 to 90 seconds for deep, distant, large quakes such as the [[2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami|2011 Tohoku earthquake]]. The effectiveness of advance warning depends on accurate detection of the P-waves and rejection of [[ground vibrations]] caused by local activity (such as trucks or construction). [[Earthquake early warning]] systems can be automated to allow for immediate safety actions, such as issuing alerts, stopping elevators at the nearest floors and switching off utilities.

==Velocity==
The velocity of P-waves in a [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] [[isotropic]] medium is given by
:&lt;math&gt;v_p= \sqrt{ \frac {K+\frac{4}{3}\mu} {\rho}}= \sqrt{ \frac{\lambda+2\mu}{\rho}} &lt;/math&gt;
where ''K'' is the [[bulk modulus]] (the modulus of incompressibility), ''&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;'' is the [[shear modulus]] (modulus of rigidity, sometimes denoted as ''G'' and also called the second [[Lamé parameters|Lamé parameter]]), ''&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;'' is the [[density]] of the material through which the wave propagates, and ''&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;'' is the first [[Lamé parameters|Lamé parameter]].

Of these, density shows the least variation, so the velocity is mostly ''controlled'' by ''K'' and ''μ''.

The [[elastic moduli]] [[P-wave modulus]], &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, is defined so that &lt;math&gt;M = K + 4\mu/3&lt;/math&gt; and thereby
:&lt;math&gt;v_p = \sqrt{M/\rho}\ &lt;/math&gt;

Typical values for P-wave velocity in earthquakes are in the range 5 to 8&amp;nbsp;km/s. The precise speed varies according to the region of the Earth's interior, from less than 6&amp;nbsp;km/s in the Earth's crust to 13.5&amp;nbsp;km/s in the lower mantle, and 11&amp;nbsp;km/s through the inner core.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dziewonski|first=Adam M.|last2=Anderson|first2=Don L.|title=Preliminary reference Earth model|journal=Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors|volume=25|issue=4|pages=297–356|doi=10.1016/0031-9201(81)90046-7|bibcode=1981PEPI...25..297D|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geologist [[Francis Birch (geophysicist)|Francis Birch]] discovered a relationship between the velocity of P waves and the density of the material the waves are traveling in:

:&lt;math&gt; V_p = a (\bar{ M}) + b \rho &lt;/math&gt;

which later became known as [[Birch's law]].

'''Pacific blockade''' is a term invented by Laurent-Basile Hautefeuille, a French writer on [[international]] [[maritime law]], to describe a [[blockade]] exercised by a [[great power]] for the purpose of bringing pressure to bear on a weaker state without actual [[war]].  It can only be employed as a measure of [[coercion]] by [[maritime power]]s able to bring into action such vastly superior forces to those the resisting state can dispose of that resistance is out of the question.

In this respect it is an [[Casus belli|act of war]], and any attempt to exercise it against a power strong enough to resist would be a commencement of [[hostilities]], and at once bring into play the rights and duties affecting neutrals. On the other hand, the object and justification of a pacific blockade being to avoid war, that is general hostilities and disturbance of [[international]] [[traffic]] with the state against which the operation is carried on, rights of war cannot consistently be exercised against ships belonging to other states than those concerned. And yet, if neutrals were not to be affected by it, the coercive effect of such a blockade might be completely lost. Recent practice has been to limit interference with them to the extent barely necessary to carry out the purpose of the blockading powers.

== Origin ==
It is usual to refer to the intervention of France, England and [[Russia]] in [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] affairs in 1827 as the first occasion on which the coercive value of pacific blockades was put to the test. [[Neutrality (international relations)|Neutral]] vessels were not affected by it. This was followed by a number of other coercive measures described in the [[textbooks]] as pacific blockades.

The first case, however, in which the operation was really a blockade, unaccompanied by hostilities, and which therefore can be properly called a pacific blockade, was that which in 1837 Great Britain exercised against [[Republic of New Granada|New Granada]]. A British subject and consul of the name of Russell was accused of stabbing a native of the country in a street brawl. He was arrested, and after being kept in detention for some months he was tried for the unlawful carrying of [[ammunition|arms]] and sentenced to six years imprisonment. The British government resented this treatment as not only cruel and unjust towards Mr Russell, but disrespectful towards the British nation, and demanded the dismissal of the officials implicated and 1000 damages as some compensation for the cruel injuries which had been inificted upon Mr Russell (State Papers, 1837-1838, p.&amp;nbsp;183). The New Granada government refused to comply with these demands, and the British representative, acting upon his instructions, called in the assistance of the [[West India]]n fleet, but observed in his communication to the British [[naval]] officer in command that it was desirable to avoid hostilities, and to endeavour to bring about the desired result by a strict blockade only. This seems to be the first occasion on which it had occurred to anybody that a blockade without war might serve the purpose of war.

==Precedent==
This precedent was shortly afterwards followed by another somewhat similar case, in which from the April 16 to the November 28, 1838 the French government blockaded the [[Mexico|Mexican]] ports, to coerce the Mexican government into acceptance of certain demands on behalf of French subjects who had suffered injury to their persons and damage to their property through insufficient protection by the Mexican authorities.

The blockade of [[Buenos Aires]] and the [[Argentina|Argentine]] coast from the March 28, 1838 to the November 7, 1840 by the French fleet, a coercive measure consequent upon [[vexatious]] laws affecting foreign residents in the Argentine Republic, seems to have been the first case in which the operation was notified to the different representatives of foreign states. This notification was given in Paris, and at Buenos Aires, and to every ship approaching the blockaded places.

This precedent of notification was, a few years later (1845), followed in another blockade against the same country by Great Britain and France, and in one in 1842 and 1844 by Great Britain against the port of [[Greytown, Nicaragua|Greytown]] in [[Nicaragua]]. In 1850 Great Britain blockaded the ports of [[Greece]] in order to compel the [[Greece|Hellenic]] government to give satisfaction in the [[Don Pacifico]] case. Don Pacifico, a British subject, claimed 32,000 as damages for unprovoked pillage of his house by an [[Athenian]] mob. Greek [[marine vessel|vessel]]s only were seized, and these were only [[Sequestration (law)|sequestered]]. Greek vessels bonafide carrying cargoes belonging to foreigners were allowed to enter the blockaded ports.

Before the next case of blockade which can be described as pacific occurred came the [[Declaration of Paris]] (April 15, 1856), requiring that blockades in order to be binding must be effective; that is to say, maintained by a force sufficient really to prevent access to the coast of the enemy.

==1860==
Some ill-defined measures of blockade followed, such as that of 1860, when Victor Emmanuel, then king of [[Sardinia]], joined the revolutionary government of [[Naples]] in blockading ports in [[Sicily]], then held by the king of Naples, without any rupture of pacific relations between the two governments; that of 1862, in which Great Britain blockaded the port of [[Rio de Janeiro]], to exact redress for pillage of an English vessel by the local population, at the same time declaring that she continued to be, on friendly terms with the emperor of [[Brazil]]; and that in 1880, when a demonstration was made before the port of [[Ulcinj]] by a fleet of British, German, French, [[Austria]]n, [[Russia]]n and [[Italy|Italian]] men-of-war, to compel the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] government to carry out the treaty conceding this town to [[Montenegro]], and it was announced that if the town was not given up by the Turkish forces it would be blockaded.

The blockade which first gave rise to serious theoretical discussion on the subject was that instituted by France in 1884 in Chinese waters. On the 20th of October 1884 Admiral Courbet declared a blockade of all the ports and roadsteads between certain specified points of the island of [[Formosa]]. The British government protestmi that Admiral Coubert had not enough ships to render the blockade effective, and that it was therefore a violation of one of the articles of the [[Declaration of Paris]] of 1856; moreover, that the French government could only interfere with neutral vessels violating the blockade if there was a state of war. If a state of war existed, England as a neutral was bound to close her [[coaling station]]s to belligerents. The British government held that in the circumstances France was waging war and not entitled to combine the rights of peace and warfare for her own benefit. Since then pacific blockades have only been exercised by the great powers as a joint measure in their common interest, which has also been that of peace; and in this respect the term is taking a new signification in accordance with the ordinary sense of the word pacific.

==1886==
In 1886 Greece was blockaded by Great Britain, Austria, Germany, Italy and Russia, to prevent her from engaging in war with Turkey, and thus forcing the powers to define their attitude towards the latter power. The instructions given to the British commander were to detain every ship under the [[Greek flag]] coming out of or entering any of the blockaded ports or harbours, or communicating with any ports within the limit blockaded; but if any parts of the cargo on board of such ships belonged to any subject or citizen of any foreign power other than Greece, and other than Austria, Germany, Italy and Russia, and had been shipped before notification of the blockade or after such notification, but under a charter made before the notification, such ship was not to be detained.

On the blockade of [[Crete]] in 1897 it was notified that the admirals in command of the British, [[Austro-Hungarian]], French, German, Italian, and Russian naval forces had decided to put the island of Crete in a state of blockade, that the blockade would be general for all ships under the Greek flag, and that ships of the six powers or neutral powers may enter into the ports occupied by the powers and land their merchandise, but only if it is not for the Greek troops or the interior of the island, and that these ships may be visited by the ships of the international fleets.

Since the adoption of the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention]] of 1907 respecting the limitation of the employment of force for the recovery of contract debts, the contracting powers are under agreement not to have recourse to armed force for the recovery of contract debts claimed from the government of one country by the government of another country as being due to its nationals, unless the debtor state refuses or neglects to reply to an offer of arbitration, or after accepting the offer-prevents any compromis from being agreed on, or after the arbitration fails to submit to the award (Art. I). Though this does not affect pacific blockades in principle, it supersedes them in practice by a new procedure for some of the cases in which they have hitherto been employed.

==1900s==
There is always the alternative of making the blockade an act of war. This was done in 1902-3, when Great Britain, Germany and Italy proclaimed a blockade of certain ports of [[Venezuela]] and the mouths of the [[Orinoco]]. The blockade in this case was not pacific, but was war with all its consequences for belligerents and neutrals (see Foreign Office notice in London Gazette of December 20, 1902).

The '''Priabonian''' is, in the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]]'s [[geologic timescale]], the latest [[age (geology)|age]] or the upper [[stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] of the [[Eocene]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]] or [[series (stratigraphy)|series]]. It spans the time between {{ma|Priabonian|and}} {{ma|Rupelian|Ma}}. The Priabonian is preceded by the [[Bartonian]] and is followed by the [[Rupelian]], the lowest stage of the [[Oligocene]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stratigraphy.org/index.php/ics-chart-timescale International Commission on Stratigraphy 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stratigraphic definition==
The Priabonian stage was introduced in scientific literature by [[Ernest Munier-Chalmas]] and [[Albert de Lapparent]] in 1893. The stage is named after the small hamlet of [[Priabona (Monte di Malo)|Priabona]] in the community of [[Monte di Malo]], in the [[Veneto]] region of northern [[Italy]].

The base of the Priabonian stage is at the first appearance of calcareous [[Plankton#Size groups|nanoplankton]] species ''Chiasmolithus oamaruensis'' (which forms the base of nanoplankton [[biozone]] NP18). An official [[GSSP]] had in 2009 not yet been assigned.

The top of the Priabonian stage (the base of the Rupelian stage and Oligocene series) is at the [[extinction]] of [[foram]] [[genus]] ''Hantkenina''.

Sometimes local [[rock strata]] cannot be correlated in sufficient detail with the ICS timescale, and stratigraphers often use regional timescales as alternatives to the ICS timescale. The Priabonian overlaps for example the upper Johannian and lower Aldingan stages of the [[Australia]]n timescale or the upper Nanzian and lower Refugian stages of the [[California]]n timescale. Other regional stages which are more or less coeval with the Priabonian include the Jacksonian of the southeastern US and Runangan of [[New Zealand]].

In [[biostratigraphy]], the Priabonian stage is coeval with the [[Chadronian]] [[North American Land Mammal Age]], the [[Headonian]] [[European Land Mammal Mega Zone]] (in more detail: with the [[Mammal Paleogene zones]] 17A through 20&lt;ref name="MP"&gt;{{cite web |last = Alroy |first = John | page = The Paleobiology Database | title = Mammal Paleogene zones |url = http://paleodb.org/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?action=processViewScale&amp;scale_no=125 | accessdate = 15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;), parts of the Barrancan and [[Mustersan]] [[South American Land Mammal Ages]] and the [[Ulangochuian]] and [[Ergilian]] [[Asian Land Mammal Ages]].

{{About|the liquid phenomenon}}
[[File:Begliktash puddle Бегликташ локва — копия.jpg|thumb|upright 1.35|{{center|[[Reflection (mathematics)|Reflection]]s in a puddle}}]]

A '''puddle''' is a small accumulation of liquid, usually water, on a surface.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/puddle&lt;/ref&gt; It can form either by pooling in a depression on the surface, or by [[surface tension]] upon a flat surface. 

A puddle is generally shallow enough to walk through, and too small to traverse with a [[boat]] or [[raft]]. Small wildlife may be attracted to puddles.

Puddles in [[natural landscape]]s and [[habitat]]s, when not resulting from [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], can indicate the presence of a [[Seep (hydrology)|seep]] or [[Spring (hydrology)|spring]]. Small seasonal [[riparian]] plants, [[grasses]], and [[wildflower]]s can germinate with the ephemeral "head start" of moisture provided by a puddle.

Small wildlife, such as birds and insects, can use puddles as a source of essential moisture or for bathing. Raised constructed puddles, [[bird bath]]s, are a part of domestic and [[wildlife garden]]s as a [[garden ornament]] and "micro-habitat" [[Restoration ecology|restoration]]. [[Swallow]]s use the damp [[loam]] which gathers in puddles as a form of [[cement]] to help to build their nests. Many [[butterfly]] species and some other insects, but particularly male butterflies, need puddles for [[nutrient]]s they can contain, such as [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s and [[amino acid]]s. In a behaviour known as [[Mud-puddling|puddling]] they seek out the damp mud that can be found around the edge of the puddles.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, P.H. and Pearson, D.L. (1982) "Why do male butterflies visit mud puddles?". ''Canadian Journal of Zoology'', '''60''' (3): 322–325. {{doi|10.1139/z82-043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some smaller forms of life, such as [[tadpoles]] or [[mosquito]] larvae, a puddle can form an entire habitat. Puddles that do not evaporate quickly can become [[standing water]], which can become [[pollution|polluted]] by decaying organisms and are often home to breeding [[mosquito]]s, which can act as vectors for diseases such as [[malaria]] and, of more recent concern in certain areas of the world, [[West Nile Virus]].

==Puddles on roads==
Puddles commonly form during [[rain]], and can cause problems for transport.  Due to the angle of the road, puddles tend to be forced by gravity to gather on the edges of the road. This can cause [[splash (fluid mechanics)|splashing]] as cars drive through the puddles, which causes water to be sprayed onto [[pedestrian]]s on the pavement. Irresponsible drivers may do this deliberately, which, in some countries, can lead to prosecution for careless driving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/4392092.stm Driver fined over puddle splash] ''BBC News'', 31 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Puddles commonly form in [[potholes]] in a dirt road, or in any other space with a shallow depression and dirt. In such cases, these are sometimes referred to as ''mud puddles'', because mud tends to form in the bottoms, resulting in dirtied wheels or boots when disturbed.

In order to deal with puddles, roads and pavements are often built with a [[Cant (road/rail)|camber]] (technically called 'crowning'), being slightly [[wikt:convex|convex]] in nature, to force puddles to drain into the gutter, which has [[storm drain]] grates to allow the water to drain into the sewers. In addition, some surfaces are made to be porous, allowing the water to drain  through the surface to the [[aquifer]] below.

==Physics==
Due to the action of [[surface tension]], small puddles can also form if a liquid is spilt on a level surface. Puddles like this are common on kitchen floors. Puddles tend to [[evaporation|evaporate]] quickly due to the high surface-area-to-volume ratio and tend to be short lived. In cold conditions puddles can form [[Black ice|patches of ice]] which are slippery and difficult to see and can be a hazard to road vehicles and pedestrians.

==Children==
Puddles are a source of recreation for children, who often like jumping in puddles as an "up-side" to rain.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite magazine

Muddy puddles, and the pleasures of splashing mud in them, are a repeated theme in the children's animation [[Peppa Pig]], to the extent of selling character-branded [[wellington boot]]s.

==Puddle thinking==
It has been fashionable for millennia, and continues to be fashionable in some circles, to believe the Universe is designed for humans. Some critics of this view reject it as [[hubris]] or [[anthropocentrism]] and argue instead that through the process of evolution it is humans that have adapted to or been shaped by the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg, Gerald and Shapiro,Robert (1993) "A Puddlian Fable" in Huchingson, ''Religion and the Natural Sciences'', pp. 220–221.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/scienceshow/stories/2006/1572643.htm|title=The anthropic universe|last=Williams|first=Robyn|date=18 February 2006|work=The Science Show|publisher=ABC Radio National|accessdate=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/proofs-of-god-in-a-photon-1527306.html | title=Proofs of God in a photon | last=Redfern | first=Martin|date=24 December 1995 | work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]'', [[Douglas Adams]] satirizes the belief that the universe is designed for humans:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Adams |first=Douglas |date=2002 |title=The Salmon of Doubt: Hitchhiking the Galaxy One Last Time |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pDchCdg9K-8C&amp;q=imagine+a+puddle#v=snippet&amp;q=imagine%20a%20puddle&amp;f=false |publisher=Harmony Books |page=131 |isbn= |accessdate=January 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, 'This is an interesting world I find myself in, an interesting hole I find myself in, fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact, it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!' This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it's still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be all right, because this World was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
When [[Walter Raleigh]] met [[Queen Elizabeth I]], Raleigh is reputed to have thrown his coat over a [[mud]]dy puddle to allow the Queen to cross without getting her feet wet as an act of [[chivalry]].

Medieval legend spoke of one man who was desperate to find building materials for his house, so he stole [[cobblestone]]s from the road surface. The remaining hole filled with water and a horseman who later walked through the 'puddle' actually found himself drowning.{{Citation Needed|date=December 2014}} A similar legend, of a young boy drowning in a puddle that formed in a [[Pothole]] in a major street in the early years of [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], is told as part of the [[Seattle Underground#Seattle Underground Tour|Seattle Underground Tour]].

'''Rocky Mountain Institute''' '''(RMI)''' is an organization in the [[United States]] dedicated to research, publication, consulting, and lecturing in the general field of [[sustainability]], with a special focus on profitable innovations for [[efficient energy use|energy and resource efficiency]]. RMI was established in 1982&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://rmi.org/about/history/ | title=History | last= | first= | date= | website=Rocky Mountain Institute | accessdate=13 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has grown into a broad-based institution with 150+ staff and an annual budget of some $30 million. RMI's work is independent and non-adversarial, with a strong emphasis on market-based solutions. The institute, including recently{{when?|date=January 2018}} merged [[Carbon War Room]], operates on 9 initiative areas: Electricity Platform, Renewables Solutions, Buildings, Reinventing Fire: China, Smart Island Economies, Mobility Transformation, Shipping Efficiency, Sunshine for Mines, Sustainable Aviation, and Trucking Efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = PDF About RMI Brochure|url = http://www.rmi.org/PDF_about_rmi_brochure|website = www.rmi.org|access-date = 2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of RMI has benefited more than 80 [[Fortune 500]] companies in a diverse range of sectors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rmi.org/images/PDFs/AboutRMI/RMI_BreakthruDsn.pdf Breakthrough Design Team] p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=January 2018}} RMI is headquartered in [[Basalt, Colorado]], and also maintains offices in [[Boulder, Colorado]], New York City, Washington D.C. and Beijing, China.

==History==
In 1978, experimental physicist [[Amory Lovins]] had published many books, consulted widely, and was active in energy affairs in some fifteen countries as synthesist and lobbyist. Lovins is a main theorist of the [[soft energy path]].

Later in 1979, Lovins married [[Hunter Lovins|L. Hunter Sheldon]], a lawyer, forester, and social scientist. Hunter received her undergraduate degree in [[sociology]] and [[political]] studies from [[Pitzer College]], and her [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from [[Loyola Marymount University|Loyola Marymount]]'s [[Loyola Law School|School of Law]]. In 1982, Amory and Hunter founded Rocky Mountain Institute, based in Colorado. Together with a group of colleagues, the Lovinses fostered efficient resource use and policy development that they believed would promote global security. RMI ultimately grew into an organization with a staff of around fifty. By the mid 1980s, the Lovinses were being featured on major network TV programs, such as ''[[60 Minutes]]''.

At RMI's headquarters the south-facing building complex is so energy-efficient that, even with local -40&amp;nbsp;°F (-40&amp;nbsp;°C) winter temperatures, the building interiors can maintain a comfortable temperature solely from the sunlight admitted plus the body heat of the people who work there. The environment can actually nurture semi-tropical and tropical indoor plants.

The Lovinses described the "hard energy path" as involving inefficient liquid-fuel automotive transport, as well as giant centralized electricity-generating facilities, often burning [[fossil fuel]]s such as [[coal]] or [[petroleum]], or harnessing a [[Nuclear fission|fission reaction]], greatly complicated by electricity wastage and loss. The "soft energy path" which they wholly preferred involves efficient use of energy, diversity of energy production methods (and matched in scale and quality to end uses), and special reliance on "soft technologies" (alternative technology) such as [[solar power|solar]], [[wind power|wind]], [[biofuel]]s, and [[geothermal power|geothermal]]. According to the Institute, large-scale electricity production facilities had an important place, but it was a place that they were already filling in the middle 1970s; in general, more would not be needed. In a 1989 speech, Amory Lovins introduced the related concept of [[Negawatt power]], in which the creation of a market for trading increased efficiency could supply additional electrical energy to consumers without increasing generation capacity—such as building more power plants.

In recent years, RMI has convened a team of designers and engineers to develop a super-efficient prototype automobile, which they've dubbed the [[Hypercar (concept car)|Hypercar]].

In December 2014, RMI merged with [[Carbon War Room]], an organization with similar goals but a different approach&lt;ref name=RMICWRmerge&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trigg|first1=Tali|title=Rocky Mountain Institute and Carbon War Room Join Forces|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/2014/12/17/behind-the-merger-of-the-rocky-mountain-institute-and-carbon-war-room-interview-with-rmis-ceo-jules-koltenhorst/|website=scientificamerican.com |publisher=[[Scientific American]]|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electric vehicles ==
In January 2008, led by John E. Waters, [[Bright Automotive]] launched from RMI with the goal of building on the work of a consortium of organizations, including [[Alcoa]], [[Google.org]], [[Johnson Controls]] and the [[Turner Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brightautomotive.com/about-us |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218102030/http://www.brightautomotive.com/about-us |archivedate=2008-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.turnerfoundation.org/ | title=Protecting &amp; Restoring the Natural World | last= | first= | date= | website=Turner Foundation | accessdate=13 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bright Automotive sought with its Bright IDEA project to develop a brand new, {{convert|100|mpgus}} [[plug-in hybrid]] electric (PHEV) [[fleet vehicle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brightautomotive.com/files/pdf/brochure%20pdf/IDEA_Brochure031709.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708094117/http://www.brightautomotive.com/files/pdf/brochure%20pdf/IDEA_Brochure031709.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It  launched [[Bright eSolutions]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brightautomotive.com/esolutions/&lt;/ref&gt; to consult on engineering, design, [[powertrain]], battery technology and [[plug-in hybrid conversion]] technology services. Bright Automotive secured a conversion contract with the [[U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command]] ([[TACOM]]) to convert military non-combat vehicles into a parallel [[PHEV]] for evaluation, including [[V2G]] testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.calcars.org/calcars-news/1081.html | title=Advances by Converter Firms | last= | first= | date=12 November 2009 | website=California Cars Initiative | accessdate=13 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Advanced Energy]], in partnership with Rocky Mountain Institute, has announced a [[Request for Information]] (RFI) for [[Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment]] (EVSE) specific to charging stations for [[plug-in electric vehicle]]s (EV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitchengine.com/advanced-energy-and-rocky-mountain-institute-announce-request-for-information-on-electric-vehicle-supply-equipment/61158/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721004909/http://www.pitchengine.com/advanced-energy-and-rocky-mountain-institute-announce-request-for-information-on-electric-vehicle-supply-equipment/61158/ |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Saint Lawrence rift system''' is a [[Seismology|seismically]] active zone paralleling the [[Saint Lawrence River]]. The [[rift]] system trends northeast and southwest and forms a [[half-graben]] that links the [[Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben|Ottawa-Bonnechere]] and the [[Saguenay Graben|Saguenay]] grabens. The rift system extends more than {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} along the Saint Lawrence valley from the [[Ottawa]] – [[Montreal]] area. Within the system, [[Fault (geology)|fault]] reactivation is believed to occur along late [[Proterozoic]] to early [[Paleozoic]] normal faults related to the opening of the [[Iapetus Ocean]].&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;{{cite book |first=Alain |last=Tremblay |first2=Yvon |last2=Lemieux |chapter=Supracrustal faults of the St. Lawrence rift system between Cap-Tourmente and Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec |title=Current Research 2001 |publisher=Natural Resources Canada |isbn=0-662-29890-X |id=M44-2001/D15E-IN |chapterurl=http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection/M44-2001-D15E.pdf |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two significant historically active seismic zones occur along this system associated with northwest trending intersecting [[graben]] structures. The [[Charlevoix]] region has been the location of at least five magnitude six or larger [[earthquake]]s over the last 350 years, including the [[1925 Charlevoix–Kamouraska earthquake]]. At the Lower St Lawrence zone the largest recorded earthquakes are about magnitude five. Seismic studies indicate a crustal convergence across the Saint Lawrence valley of about {{convert|.5|mm|abbr=on}} per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Mazzotti |first=S. |last2=Henton |first2=J. |last3=Adams |first3=J. |title=Crustal strain rates and seismic hazard from seismicity and GPS measurements along the St Lawrence Valley, Quebec |publisher=American Geophysical Union |date=Spring 2004 |id=Abstract #S14A-02 |bibcode=2004AGUSM.S14A..02M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13793">The '''South East Atlantic Fisheries Organisation''' (SEAFO) is an organization that maintains controls over fishing and fishing related acts in the Southeastern Atlantic Ocean.

==Introduction==

Predating the Independence of [[Namibia]] in 1990, the [[International Commission for South East Atlantic Fisheries]] (ICSEAF) was responsible for the management of the [[fisheries]] in the region both in the [[exclusive economic zones]] of [[Angola]], [[Namibia]] and [[South Africa]] and in the adjacent water of the high seas.  ICSEAF Convention came into force in 1971, with the [[wikt:secretariat|Secretariat]] located in [[Madrid]], Spain and was established mainly in response to increased levels of exploitation of newly discovered rich fishing grounds off the Namibian coast by the fleet of [[Distant Water Fishing Nations]] (DWFNs).  ICSEAF failed its mandate largely because Contracting Parties did not comply with the conservation and management measures they adopted and that the Commission lacked effective compliance and enforcement mechanisms.  Fishing efforts increased rapidly during the 1960s and throughout the 1970s and 1980s on targeted species such as [[hake]], [[horse mackerel]] and [[pilchards]] off Namibia and horse mackerels (''[[Trachurus capensis]]'' and ''[[Trachurus trecae|T. trecae]]'') and sardinellas ([[Sardinella aurita]] and ''[[Sardinella maderensis|S. maderensis]]'') in southern Angolan waters. For example, in 1965 about 193,000 tonnes of hake were caught mainly off Namibia and by 1972, a peak of 820,000 tonnes was recorded, followed by a declining trend to about 338,000 tonnes landed by 1988.  At Independence in 1990, the new government of Namibia proclaimed through the Act of Parliament a {{convert|200|nmi|km|adj=on}} EEZ and the jurisdiction over the fisheries within the zone. The organisation became inoperative following Namibia's refusal to join it.  Meanwhile, the high seas fisheries of the southeast Atlantic were left without a managing body.  With new mandate and direction, SEAFO replaced ICSEAF.

SEAFO is an intergovernmental regional fisheries management organisation responsible for ensuring the long-term conservation and sustainable use of the fishery resources (excluding migratory fish stocks) in the high seas of southeast [[Atlantic Ocean]], within the Convention Area. The SEAFO Convention Area is situated in the southeast Atlantic region, outside the exclusive economic zones of the coastal states of Angola, Namibia, South Africa and United Kingdom’s overseas territory of [[St. Helena]] and its dependencies [[Tristan da Cunha]] and [[Ascension Island]].  It covers an area of about 16 million square kilometres. The idea to establish SEAFO came from Namibia in 1995 because of the concern that certain commercially valuable straddling fish stocks required better protection to avoid compromising their potential in Namibian waters as a result of unsustainable fishing practices on the adjacent high seas.  The idea was welcomed and greatly supported by the coastal neighbours of Angola, South Africa and United Kingdom (on behalf of St. Helena and its dependencies Tristan da Cunha and Ascension Islands) and by DWFN's of [[European Union|EU]], [[Iceland]], Japan, Norway, [[Poland]], [[Republic of Korea]], the [[Russian Federation]], [[Ukraine]] and United States – all of which have history of fishing or demonstrated real interest in the fisheries in the area.

Complex negotiations between the coastal States and the DWFN started in 1997 and were completed in 2000 with the adoption of SEAFO Convention.  SEAFO Convention is largely based on 1982 [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS) and the 1995 [[United Nations Fish Stock Agreement]] (UNFSA) and is internationally hailed as the most contemporary, responsive instrument for conservation and sustainable utilisation of living marine resources in high seas. The Convention was signed on 20 April 2001 in [[Windhoek]] by Angola, the European Community, Iceland, Namibia, Norway, Republic of Korea, South Africa, United Kingdom (on behalf of St. Helena and its dependencies Tristan da Cunha and Ascension Islands) and the United States of America.  It entered into force on 13 April 2003 after the deposit of instruments of ratification by Namibia and Norway and approval by the European Community.  Angola deposited its instrument of ratification on 7 March 2006, making it a 4th Contracting Party of SEAFO.  The role played by the developing coastal States in the drafting of SEAFO Convention was extensive.

The Commission is the highest decision-making body of the Organisation and it meets annually to among others, formulate fisheries conservation and management measures, review compliance issues and adopt the budget.  Decision on matters of substance, within SEAFO is taken by consensus among the Parties. There is also a provision for non acceptance of a decision by a Contracting Party. Budgetary contributions are made up of an equal basic fee and a fee determined from the total catch of species covered by the Convention. SEAFO allows States and regional economic integration organizations to become parties to the Convention and encourages cooperation with non-Parties.  Compliance with monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) is one of the criteria for consideration in determining the nature and extent of participatory rights in SEAFO fishing opportunities.  SEAFO Convention foresees the creation of a robust system of observation, inspection, compliance and enforcement that includes control measures linked to flag State duties and port State duties as well as at-sea and in port inspection, boarding and inspection of vessels on a reciprocal basis, observer programs and procedures to follow up on infringements.  For transparency and openness, SEAFO accords accessibility of observers to its meetings and to its documents. SEAFO Scientific Committee provides scientific advice to the Commission on the conservation and management issues such as the status of the resources and the harvesting levels.  Subsidiary bodies may be established by the Commission, as needs arise, from time-to-time. The day-to-day work of the Organisation is coordinated, administered and overseen by the Secretariat, based in [[Swakopmund]], Namibia.

==General Principles==

SEAFO Convention provides fundamental principles that govern conservation and management of living marine resources under SEAFO's jurisdiction. [[Fisheries]] management is based on the best available scientific evidence, and where scientific information is uncertain, unreliable or inadequate, the precautionary approach principle prevails, until such time when more information is known about the resources dynamics, [[ecosystem]] structures and functions. The general principles encompass the concept of [[ecosystem approach to fisheries]] management.  In particular conservation and protection of species that belong to the same ecosystem as, or are associated with or dependent upon the harvested fishery resources (e.g., [[seabird]]s, [[cetacean]]s, [[Pinniped|seals]] and marine [[turtle]])s are given emphasis.  In addition the general principles call for the minimization of harmful impacts on all living marine resources and protection of marine environment and its biodiversity.

==Fish stocks covered==

Living marine resources covered by SEAFO including fish (such as [[orange roughy]] ''Hoplostethus atlanticus'', alfonsino ''[[Beryx splendens]]'', Patagonian toothfish ''[[Dissostichus eleginoides]]'', [[hake]] ''[[Merluccius paradoxus]]'', horse mackerel ''[[Trachurus capensis]]'', chub mackerel ''[[Scomber japonicus]]'', cardinalfishes ''[[Epigonus]]'' species, [[Oreosomatidae|oreo dories]] and armourhead ''[[Pseudopentaceros]]'' species, some [[shark]] species and [[Batoidea|rays]]), [[Mollusca|molluscs]] (such as [[octopus]] and [[squid]]) and [[crustacean]]s (such as deep sea red crab ''[[Chaceon maritae]]''). Some of the most notable commercially important species are orange roughy, alfonsino  – harvested by bottom trawling, and deep sea red crab  – capture by pots or traps and Patagonian toothfish caught by longlining. Highly migratory fish stocks such as [[tuna]], [[swordfish]], [[marlin]] and sharks in the region are covered by the [[International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas]] (ICCAT). Most of SEAFO fish resources are found in deep waters (greater than 500&amp;nbsp;m depth) and tend to be slow grower, long-lived, late-matured and therefore could be vulnerable to over–exploitation. Their biological and ecological dynamics are not well known and there are no good historic time series.

==Conservation and management regime==

SEAFO has adopted innovative ways to manage deep sea fisheries, taking into account the EAF management, the precautionary approach principles as well as the reliance on the best scientific available evidence.  Since 2005 and 2007, the following conservation and management measures were adopted:

* Limiting catches for deep sea red crab and Patagonian toothfish in South East Atlantic waters due to concerns on the sustainability of the current fisheries and of the potential negative impacts on the vulnerable marine habitats
* Reducing incidental mortality of seabirds, especially [[petrels]] and [[albatrosses]], by fishing gear adjustments and other technical measures during fishing operations
* Prohibiting the “[[shark finning]]” practice whereby vessels cut the valuable shark fins off and retain them on board while discarding the carcass of the shark
* Reducing incidental mortality of sea turtles in fishing operations, notably by promptly releasing turtles entangled in fishing gear
* Implementing closed areas in numerous fragile marine ecosystems such as [[seamounts]] to ensure long-term conservation and protection in line with precautionary approach principles while more scientific information is becoming available.

For monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) of fishing activities, SEAFO has adopted comprehensive and stringent measures including the following:

* Mandatory on board the fishing vessel a scientific observers in order to collect the required catch and biological data on the stocks
* Mandatory automatic satellite [[vessel monitoring system]] (VMS) for all vessels fishing in the SEAFO area
* Port State inspection scheme based on standards set forth in the FAO Model Scheme 
* Prohibiting fishing activities in vulnerable marine areas with prominent seamounts
* Banning of transshipments at sea in order to combat illegal, unregulated and unreported fisheries (IUU)
* Establishment of a Register of SEAFO-authorised fishing vessels 
* Established a list of vessels presumed to have carried out IUU fishing activities including IUU vessels that are in the IUU lists of [[Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization]] ([[NAFO]]), [[North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission]] ([[NEAFC]]) and the [[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources|Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR)]].

==Cooperation with other organisations==

SEAFO recognizes the need to cooperate with coastal States and all other States and Organisations having a real interest in the fishery resources of the South East Atlantic Ocean.  At regional level, SEAFO and Angola, Namibia, South Africa and UK’s overseas territories in the region are working closely to ensure compatibility of conservation and management measures adopted for straddling fish stocks on the high seas and in areas of national jurisdiction. SEAFO has strong link with the [[Benguela Current Large Marine Ecosystem Programme]] (BCLME) and the [[Benguela Current Commission]] (BCC) and shares information on the fisheries and the environment.

At international level, SEAFO has working relationships with various regional fisheries management organisations, notably North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC), Commission for the Conservation of the Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NAFO) and the International Commission for the Conservation of the Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT).  Cooperation with these organisations is centred on the exchange of experiences on all matters of mutual interests, including on sharing of data on by-catch species and information on compliance matters such as on IUU fishing activities.  SEAFO is working closely with the [[United Nations]] in particular with FAO and with the [[Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea]] (DOALOS) aiming at strengthening high seas fisheries governance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17042">'''Space charge''' is a concept in which excess [[electric charge]] is treated as a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]] of charge distributed over a region of space (either a volume or an area) rather than distinct point-like charges. This model typically applies when [[charge carriers]] have been emitted from some region of a solid—the cloud of emitted carriers can form a space charge region if they are sufficiently spread out, or the charged atoms or molecules left behind in the solid can form a space charge region. Space charge usually only occurs in [[dielectric]] media (including [[vacuum]]) because in a conductive medium the charge tends to be rapidly neutralized or [[Electric field screening|screened]]. The sign of the space charge can be either negative or positive. This situation is perhaps most familiar in the area near a [[metal]] object when it is heated to [[incandescence]] in a [[vacuum]]. This effect was first observed by [[Thomas Edison]] in light bulb [[Electrical filament|filament]]s, where it is sometimes called the [[Edison effect]], but space charge is a significant phenomenon in many vacuum and [[solid-state electronic]] devices.

==Cause==

===Physical explanation===
When a metal object is placed in a vacuum and is heated to incandescence, the energy is sufficient to cause [[electron]]s to "boil" away from the surface [[atom]]s and surround the metal object in a cloud of free electrons. This is called [[thermionic emission]]. The resulting cloud is negatively charged, and can be attracted to any nearby positively charged object, thus producing an electric current which passes through the vacuum.

Space charge can result from a range of phenomena, but the most important are:

# Combination of the current density and spatially [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|inhomogeneous]] resistance
# [[Ionization]] of species within the dielectric to form heterocharge
# Charge injection from electrodes and from a stress enhancement
# [[Polarization (waves)|Polarization]] in structures such as [[Electrical treeing|water tree]]s.  "Water tree" is a name given to a tree-like figure appearing in a water-impregnated polymer insulating cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that in [[alternating current]] (AC) most carriers injected at [[Electrode|electrodes]] during a half of cycle are ejected during the next half cycle, so the net balance of charge on a cycle is practically zero. However, a small fraction of the carriers can be trapped at levels deep enough to retain them when the field is inverted. The amount of charge in AC should increase slower than in [[direct current]] (DC) and become observable after longer periods of time.

==== Hetero and homo charge ====
Hetero charge means that the polarity of the space charge is opposite to that of neighboring electrode, and homo charge is the reverse situation. Under high voltage application, a hetero charge near the electrode is expected to reduce the breakdown voltage, whereas a homo charge will increase it. After polarity reversal under ac conditions, the homo charge is converted to hetero space charge.

===Mathematical explanation===
If the "[[vacuum]]" has a [[pressure]] of 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; mmHg or less, the main [[vehicle]] of conduction is [[electron]]s. The emission current density ''(J'') from the [[cathode]], as a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of its thermodynamic [[temperature]] ''T'', in the absence of space-charge, is given by [[Richardson's law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;J = (1-\tilde{r})A_0T^2\exp\left(\frac{-\phi}{kT}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;A_0 = \frac{4\pi e m_e k^2}{h^3} \approx 1.2 \times 10^6&lt;/math&gt;  A m&lt;sup&gt;−2 &lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;
:''e'' = elementary positive charge (i.e., magnitude of electron charge),
:''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' = electron mass,
:''k'' = [[Boltzmann's constant]] = 1.38 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−23&lt;/sup&gt;J/K,
:''h'' = [[Planck's constant]] = 6.62 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−34&lt;/sup&gt; J s,
:''&amp;phi;'' = [[work function]] of the cathode,
:''ř'' = mean electron reflection coefficient.

The reflection coefficient can be as low as 0.105 but is usually near 0.5. For [[Tungsten]], (1 - ř)A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.6 to 1.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; A m&lt;sup&gt;−2 &lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''&amp;phi;'' = 4.52 eV. At 2500&amp;nbsp;°C, the emission is 28207 A/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The emission current as given above is many times greater than that normally collected by the electrodes, except in some [[pulse]]d [[valves]] such as the [[cavity magnetron]]. Most of the electrons emitted by the cathode are driven back to it by the [[Coulomb's law|repulsion]] of the [[cloud]] of electrons in its neighborhood. This is called the ''space charge effect''. In the limit of large current densities, ''J'' is given by the Child-Langmuir equation below, rather than by the thermionic emission equation above.

==Occurrence==
Space charge is an inherent property of all [[vacuum tube]]s. This has at times made life harder or easier for [[electrical engineer]]s who used tubes in their designs. For example, space charge significantly limited the practical application of [[triode]] [[amplifier]]s which led to further innovations such as the vacuum tube [[tetrode]].

On the other hand, space charge was useful in some tube applications because it generates a negative [[Electromotive force|EMF]] within the tube's envelope, which could be used to create a negative bias on the tube's grid. Grid bias could also be achieved by using an applied grid voltage in addition to the control voltage. This could improve the engineer's control and fidelity of amplification. It allowed to construct ''space charge tubes'' for [[Vehicle audio|car radios]] that required only 6 or 12 volts anode voltage (typical examples were the 6DR8/EBF83, 6GM8/ECC86, 6DS8/ECH83, 6ES6/EF97 and 6ET6/EF98).

Space charges can also occur within [[dielectric]]s. For example, when gas near a high voltage electrode begins to undergo [[dielectric breakdown]], electrical charges are injected into the region near the electrode, forming space charge regions in the surrounding gas. Space charges can also occur within solid or liquid dielectrics that are stressed by high [[electric fields]]. Trapped space charges within solid dielectrics are often a contributing factor leading to dielectric failure within high voltage power cables and capacitors.

=== In vacuum (Child's law) ===&lt;!--'Child's law' redirects here--&gt;
[[Image:ChildLangmuirLawGraph1.png|Graph showing Child-Langmuir Law. S and d are constant and equal to 1.|thumb]]

First proposed by [[Clement D. Child]] in 1911, Child's law states that the space-charge limited current (SCLC) in a plane-parallel vacuum diode varies directly as the three-halves power of the anode voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; and inversely as the square of the distance ''d'' separating the cathode and the anode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Child |first=C. D. |authorlink=Clement D. Child |title=Discharge From Hot CaO |journal=Physical Review | series = Series I |date=1 May 1911 |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=492–511 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevSeriesI.32.492 |bibcode = 1911PhRvI..32..492C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For electrons, the current density ''J'' (amperes per meter squared) is written:
:&lt;math&gt;J = \frac{ I_a }{ S } =\frac{4 \epsilon_0}{9}\sqrt{2 e / m_e} \frac{V_a^{3/2}}{d^2}&lt;/math&gt;.
where ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; is the anode current and ''S'' the anode surface inner area; &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of the charge of the electron and &lt;math&gt;m_e&lt;/math&gt; is its mass. The equation is also known as the "three-halves power" law and as the Child–Langmuir law. Child originally derived this equation for the case of atomic ions, which have much smaller ratios of their charge to their mass. [[Irving Langmuir]] published the application to electron currents in 1913, and extended it to the case of cylindrical cathodes and anodes.

The equation's validity is subject to the following assumptions:
# Electrons travel ballistically between electrodes (i.e., no scattering).
# In the interelectrode region, the space charge of any ions is negligible.
# The electrons have zero velocity at the cathode surface.

The assumption of no scattering (ballistic transport) is what makes the predictions of Child–Langmuir Law different from those of Mott–Gurney Law. The latter assumes steady-state drift transport and therefore strong scattering.

=== In semiconductors ===

In semiconductors and insulating materials, an electric field causes charged particles, electrons, to reach a specific drift velocity that is parallel to the direction of the field. This is different from the behavior of the free charged particles in a vacuum, in which a field accelerates the particle. The proportionality factor between the magnitudes of the drift velocity, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, and the electric field, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal E&lt;/math&gt;, is called the [[electron mobility|mobility]], &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;v = \mu \mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Drift regime (The Mott Gurney law) ====&lt;!--'Mott–Gurney law' redirects here--&gt;

The Child's Law behavior of a space charge limited current that applies in a vacuum diode doesn't generally apply to a semiconductor/insulator in a single-carrier device, and is replaced by the Mott-Gurney law. For a thin slab of material of thickness &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, sandwiched between two selective Ohmic contacts, the electric current density, &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;, flowing through the slab is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mott |first1=Nevill F. |last2=Gurney |first2=R. W. |title=Electronic Processes in Ionic Crystals, 1st ed. |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Murgatroyd |first=P. N. J. |journal=J. Phys. D |title=Theory of space-charge-limited current enhanced by Frenkel effect |year=1970 |volume=3 |page=151 |doi=10.1088/0022-3727/3/2/308|bibcode = 1970JPhD....3..151M }}&lt;/ref&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;J=\frac{9}{8} {\epsilon}{\mu} \frac{{V_a}^{2}}{{L}^3}&lt;/math&gt; ,

where &lt;math&gt;V_a&lt;/math&gt; is the voltage that has been applied across the slab and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the [[permitivity]] of the solid. The Mott-Gurney law offers some crucial insight into charge-transport across an intrinsic semiconductor,
namely that one should not expect the drift current to increase linearly with the applied voltage, i.e., from [[Ohm's law]], as one would expect
from charge-transport across a metal or highly doped semiconductor. Since the only unknown quantity in the Mott-Gurney law is the charge-carrier mobility, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, the equation is commonly used to characterize charge transport in intrinsic semiconductors. Using the Mott-Gurney law for characterizing amorphous semiconductors, along with semiconductors containing defects and/or non-Ohmic contacts, should however be approached with caution as significant deviations both in the magnitude of the current and the power law dependence with respect to the voltage will be observed. In those cases the Mott-Gurney law can not be readily used for characterization, and other equations which can account for defects and/or non-ideal injection should be used instead. 

During the derivation of the Mott-Gurney law, one has to make the following assumptions:
# There is only one type of charge carrier present, i.e., only electrons or holes.
# The material has no intrinsic conductivity, but charges are injected into it from one electrode and captured by the other.
# The carrier mobility, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, and the permittivity, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, are constant throughout the sample.
# The current flow is not limited by traps or energetic disorder.
# The current is not predominantly due to doping.
# The electric field at the charge-injecting electrode is zero, meaning that the current is governed by drift only.

As an application example, the steady-state space-charge-limited current across a piece of intrinsic silicon with a charge-carrier mobility of 1500 &amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/V-s, a dielectric constant of 11.9, an area of 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a thickness of 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; cm can be calculated by an [http://www.popproperty.net/PopularTools/Semiconductor/SpaceChargeLimited.aspx on line calculator] to be 126.4 μA at 3 V. Note that in order for this calculation to be accurate, one must assume all the points listed above.

==== Low voltage regime ====

In the case where a very small applied bias is applied across the single-carrier device, the current is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Levie|first=R. |last2=Seidah|first2=N. G. |last3=Moreira|first3=H.  |journal=J.

:&lt;math&gt;J=4{\pi}^2 \frac{k_\mathrm{B}T}{q} {\mu}{\epsilon} \frac{{V_a}}{{L}^3}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;k_\mathrm{B}T&lt;/math&gt; is the thermal energy. Note that the equation describing the current in the low voltage regime follows the same thickness scaling as the Mott-Gurney law, &lt;math&gt;L^{-3}&lt;/math&gt;, but increases linearly with the applied voltage.

====Saturation regimes====

When a very large voltage is applied across the semiconductor, the current can transition into a saturation regime. 

In the velocity-saturation regime, this equation takes the following form
:&lt;math&gt;J=2{\epsilon}{v}\frac{{V_a}}{{L}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Note the different dependence of &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;V_a&lt;/math&gt; between the Mott-Gurney law and the equation describing the current in the velocity-saturation regime.  In the ballistic case (assuming no collisions), the Mott-Gurney equation takes the form of the more familiar Child-Langmuir law.

In the charge-carrier saturation regime, the current through the sample is given by,
:&lt;math&gt;J={q}{\mu}{N_\mathrm{eff}}\frac{{V_a}}{{L}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N_\mathrm{eff}&lt;/math&gt; is the effective [[density of states]] of the charge carrier type in the semiconductor.

== Shot noise ==
Space charge tends to reduce [[shot noise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Terman |first=Frederick Emmons |authorlink=Frederick Terman |title=Radio Engineers' Handbook |edition=first |year=1943 |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=286&amp;ndash;294 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shot noise results from the random arrivals of discrete charge; the statistical variation in the arrivals produces shot noise.&lt;ref name="Terman292-3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Terman|1943|pp=292&amp;ndash;293}}&lt;/ref&gt; A space charge develops a potential that slows the carriers down. For example, an electron approaching a cloud of other electrons will slow down due to the repulsive force. The slowing carriers also increases the space charge density and resulting potential. In addition, the potential developed by the space charge can reduce the number of carriers emitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Terman|1943|pp=286&amp;ndash;287}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the space charge limits the current, the random arrivals of the carriers are smoothed out; the reduced variation results in less shot noise.&lt;ref name="Terman292-3"/&gt;

[[File:Shrine of the Báb in Haifa 6801-11.jpg|thumb|250px|Aerial view of the bridge terrace behind the Shrine of the Báb]]
[[File:Israel - Haifa - Bahai Gardens 004.jpg|thumb|250px|Downward view of the upper terraces]]
[[File:Bahai Garden in Haifa Israel.jpg|thumb|250px|Terraces at night]]

The '''Terraces''' of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], also known as the '''Hanging Gardens of Haifa''', are garden terraces around the [[Shrine of the Báb]] on [[Mount Carmel, Israel|Mount Carmel]] in [[Haifa]], [[Israel]].  The gardens rest in the neighborhoods of [[Wadi Nisnas]] and [[Hadar HaCarmel]].  They are one of the most visited tourist attractions in [[Israel]]. The architect was [[Fariborz Sahba]] of [[Iran]] and the structural engineers were Karban and Co. of Haifa. Along with the [[Bahá'í World Centre buildings|Baha'i Holy Places]] in Western [[Galilee]], it is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

==Symbolism==
The terraces represent the first eighteen disciples of the [[Báb]], who were designated "[[Letters of the Living]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.bahai.org/article-1-6-5-3.html Info.bahai.org: The Projects on Mount Carmel]&lt;/ref&gt; although no individual terraces are connected with individual Letters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/uhj/letters.quddus.dawnbreakers.html#4 UHJ letter: Letters of Living; Dawn-Breakers; Quddus; Terraces]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Nine concentric circles provide the main geometry of the eighteen terraces. Just as the identification of a circle presupposes a centre, so the terraces have been conceived as generated from the Shrine of the Báb. The eighteen terraces plus the one terrace of the Shrine of the Báb make nineteen terraces total. [[19 (number)|Nineteen]] is a significant number within both the Bahá'í and Bábí religions.

Fariborz Sahba began work in 1987 designing the gardens and oversaw construction. The terraces were opened to the public in June 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Momen |first= Moojan| authorlink = Moojan Momen  |encyclopedia= Bahá’í Encyclopedia Project |title= Bahá'í World Center |year= 2009 |publisher= National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United States |location= Evanston, IL |url= http://www.bahai-encyclopedia-project.org/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=36%3Aadministrationinstitutions&amp;id=74%3Abahai-world-center-&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning at its base, the gardens extend almost {{convert|1|km|mi|1|abbr=off|spell=in}} up the side of Mount Carmel, covering some {{convert|200,000|m2|0|abbr=off}} of land. The gardens are linked by a set of stairs flanked by twin streams of running water cascading down the mountainside through the steps and terrace bridges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recreatingeden.com/index.php?pid=8&amp;season=03&amp;episode=30 Gardens of Worship: Recreating Eden (season 3, episode 30, 2006)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301221838/http://www.recreatingeden.com/index.php?pid=8&amp;season=03&amp;episode=30 |date=2012-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gardens have elements of the [[Persian garden|Persian]] [[paradise garden]]s, isolating the site from the noise of the surroundings and connecting the different [[Bahá'í World Centre buildings|Bahá'í buildings]] on Mount Carmel together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ganbahai.org.il/en/learn-more/design-management/ Yael Hammerman: Distinctive Design of the Bahá’í Gardens]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water and ecology==
The [[irrigation system]] includes a computer which, based on meteorologic data it receives, controls hundreds of valves to distribute water throughout the gardens by sprinkling and dripping. This is done at night and in the early morning, to avoid wasting water by evaporation. The water that flows alongside the stairs is circulating in a closed system within each terrace, so that little water is wasted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ganbahai.org.il/en/learn-more/design-management/environmental-considerations Bahá'í World Centre: Environmental Considerations in the Bahá’í Gardens]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Goblin Reservation''''' is a 1968 [[science fiction]] novel by American writer [[Clifford D. Simak]], featuring an educated [[Neanderthal man|Neanderthal]], a biomechanical [[sabertooth tiger]], aliens that move about on wheels, a man who time-travels using an unreliable device implanted in his brain, a ghost, trolls, [[banshee]]s, [[goblin]]s, a [[dragon]] and even [[Shakespeare]] himself.'' The Goblin Reservation'' was a [[Hugo Award]] nominee in 1969 and was originally serialized in ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' magazine.

==Plot==
''The Goblin Reservation'' is the tale of Professor Peter Maxwell. It is set in the distant future when the Earth has been transformed into a university planet; a planet where creatures from all over the galaxy come to study, teach, and be entertained by the amazing discoveries that Earth is now rich with. Among the many things that Earth can now boast is Time University:  a university devoted to slipping through time and discovering the truth about past events. People and creatures from the past are brought forward in time to be interviewed, studied and to provide entertainment for the people of the future.  Among these are Alley Oop, a very smart, if at times crude, [[Neanderthal]] rescued from certain death and educated in the future. The creatures that people of the past always thought to be myth—such as trolls, fairies, goblins, and the like—have been discovered and placed on various reservations where they live and are studied by those working at Supernatural, a division of the planet-wide university.

The story begins when Peter Maxwell comes home to Earth only to discover that he has died.  He is forced to investigate his own "murder" and discover who or what wanted him dead. He also returns with an additional mystery. He was apparently copied by unknown aliens and sent to a hidden crystal world that may have come from the universe that existed before ours.

The knowledge contained in the crystal planet could belong to Earth if Maxwell can discover what the intelligences remaining on the planet want.  The alien race known as Wheelers want the Artifact, a monolith on display in a museum on Earth.  The connection between the two provides the climax to the story.  Before the events of the story, the University is expecting to close a lucrative deal for the Artifact, as well as mounting a prestigious series of talks by William Shakespeare in person.  At the end, thanks to Maxwell, the deal is off, a dragon is on the loose, and Shakespeare has disappeared.

==Characters==
* Peter Maxwell : A professor in the Supernatural Department at the University who has traveled by teleportation to a distant planet and back, originally following a report of a dragon sighting.  On his return he finds that he is a duplicate of the original Maxwell, who has been murdered.  He himself spent time on a planet roofed entirely in crystal that seems to contain the secrets of a previous version of the universe.  He has a mission to find an important item, which turns out to be something the University collected from the past, known as the Artifact.
* Carol Hampton : A new hire at the University who was given Maxwell's old apartment.  Maxwell's key still works, and the two encounter each other when he lets himself in.
* Ally Oop : A Neanderthal rescued from cannibals in the past, and Maxwell's drinking buddy.  He lets Maxwell stay with him.  They spend much time drinking Oop's home-brewed moonshine.
* Nancy Clayton : A society lady who hosts fashionable soirees, usually to introduce something new or bizarre.  Maxwell gets what he thinks is an invitation, apparently because he has returned from the dead.  However he is ushered secretly in the back door, and finds one of the Wheelers waiting to bargain with him for the crystal planet's knowledge.  Nancy disavows all knowledge of the invitation, and planned the party for the Wheeler, who goes by the name "Mr. Marmaduke".
* Mr. Churchill : Churchill is a freelance business agent and fixer who has taken on the Wheelers as clients.  He "bumps into" Maxwell just after his return to Earth and continues to pester him on behalf of Mr. Marmaduke.
* Harlow Sharpe : Sharpe is the head of the Time College.  By the time Maxwell realizes the Wheelers' intent, Sharpe has already made a deal for the Artifact.  Maxwell inadvertently wrecks all of Sharpe's plans, but in compensation the knowledge of the crystal planet is promised to Earth.
* Mr. O'Toole : Leader of the Goblins and Maxwell's friend on the Goblin Reservation.  Proud and arrogant, he is in conflict with the trolls who are ruining the precious October Ale.  The trolls only want respect from the goblins and a share of the ale.
* Wheelers : These are a race of aliens consisting of two wheels on either side of a translucent bubble containing luminous bugs.  They apparently have [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive minds]].  It is later revealed that they used to be the draft animals of the race that made the crystal planet and the Artifact.  They can expel deadly noxious gases that were probably the cause of Maxwell's original "death".
* The Banshee : A smoky wraith-like creature that is dying as an outcast on the reservation.  Maxwell sits a ''death-watch'' with it, and in return the Banshee tells him the truth about the crystal planet.  The banshees are messengers for the crystal planet and its creatures, and are still able to communicate with it.
* Trolls : These creatures live in bridges they construct from stones, and are the only inhabitants of the Goblin Reservation who remember the ways of magic.  Despised and ostracised by the goblins, they retaliate by preventing vehicles from flying over the Reservation, notably an air car carrying Maxwell that is forced to land when its power is cut.  They also vandalize fairy rings and other structures. Maxwell gets concessions from the goblins in order for the trolls to bring down the Wheelers who are pursuing the dragon through the air.
* William Shakespeare : Brought from the past, Shakespeare is scheduled to give a lecture about how he did not write the plays.  His presence sparks a brawl between the English department and the Time department.
* Sylvester the Sabre-Tooth : This is Carol Hampton's pet, a bio-mechanical re-creation of one of the extinct big cats.  His appearance usually leads to mayhem.
* The Artifact : Actually a dragon in suspended animation, it is accidentally freed when Maxwell uses a viewer given to him on the crystal planet.  The Wheelers are trying to buy the Artifact from Earth.  The first Maxwell was killed to prevent him revealing the truth about it.  The Wheelers attack the dragon, and Maxwell has to negotiate peace between the goblins and the other creatures on the reservation in order to make them cooperate against the Wheelers.
* Albert Lambert the Artist : A painter born in 1973 whose style changed radically for unknown reasons when he turned 50.  His later work depicts a bizarre unearthly landscape, including the Artifact.  He appears suddenly, using an erratic experimental time-travel device implanted in his brain.  Shown his own work, he denies painting it, but says he will eventually because he only paints things he has seen.  He identifies the Wheelers, the goblins and the other mythical creatures as those he saw attempting to colonize Earth from space in the [[Jurassic]] era.  The paintings depict their cities.  He returns to his own time using Time University's facilities.
* The Ghost : An actual ghost who cannot remember who he used to be.  At the end he is revealed to be the ghost of Shakespeare himself.  The two dance together in the reservation at the story's conclusion.

== References to actual locations ==
* [[Lake Mendota]], at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], is mentioned in a scene where Maxwell reflects on the mess his life has become.

== Awards and nominations ==
[[Hugo Awards]] 1969 nominee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehugoawards.org/?page_id=50 1969 Hugo Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
In a 2012 video interview with [[Gawker Media]] science fiction site [[io9]], Hugo award-winning author [[Kim Stanley Robinson]] attributed ''The Goblin Reservation'' as the book that got him initially interested in science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Annalee Newitz]].

'''''Triops''''' is a [[genus]] of small [[crustacean]]s in the order [[Notostraca]] (tadpole shrimp). Some [[species]] are considered [[living fossil]]s, with a [[fossil record]] that reaches back to the late [[Carboniferous]], {{Ma|300}}. The long lasting resting eggs of one species, ''[[Triops longicaudatus]]'', are commonly sold in kits as a pet. In contact with fresh water the animals hatch. Most ''Triops'' have a life expectancy of up to 90 days (adult stage only; not including egg period), and can tolerate a [[pH]] range of 6–10. In nature they often inhabit temporary pools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Sol Felty Light |editor2=James T. Carlton |year=2007 |title=The Light and Smith manual: intertidal invertebrates from central California to Oregon |edition=4th |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |isbn=978-0-520-23939-5 |chapter=Branchiopoda |author=Denton Belk |pages=414–417 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=64jgZ1CfmB8C&amp;pg=PA417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relatives and fossil record ==
The genus ''Triops'' can be distinguished from the only other genus of Notostraca, ''[[Lepidurus]]'', by the form of the [[telson]] (the end of its 'tail'), which bears only a pair of long, thin [[Caudal (anatomical term)|caudal]] extensions in ''Triops'', while ''Lepidurus'' also bears a central platelike process. Only 24 hours after hatching they already resemble miniature versions of the adult form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Sol Felty Light |editor2=James T. Carlton |year=2007 |title=The Light and Smith manual: intertidal invertebrates from central California to Oregon |edition=4th |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |isbn=978-0-520-23939-5 |chapter=Branchiopoda |author=Denton Belk |pages=414–417 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=64jgZ1CfmB8C&amp;pg=PA417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Triops'' are sometimes called "[[living fossil]]s," since [[fossil]]s attributable to this genus have been found in rocks of [[Carboniferous]] age, an estimated {{Ma|300}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An Introduction to ''Triops'' |author1=Chip Hannum |author2=Stuart Halliday |lastauthoramp=yes |url=http://mytriops.com/articles/triops_intro.stm |publisher=MyTriops.com |accessdate=October 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805092533/http://mytriops.com/articles/triops_intro.stm |archivedate=August 5, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one extant species, ''[[Triops cancriformis]]'', has hardly changed since the [[Jurassic]] period (approximately {{mya|180}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=David A. Grimaldi  |author2=Michael S.

''Triops'' can be found in Africa, Australia, Asia, South America, Europe (including Great Britain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| series=Autumnwatch | series-link=Autumnwatch | station=[[BBC Two]] | date=5 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and in some parts of North America where the climate is right. Some eggs stay unhatched from the previous group and hatch when rain soaks the area. ''Triops'' are often found in [[vernal pool]]s.

== Life cycle ==
Most species [[sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]], but some populations are dominated by [[hermaphrodite]]s which produce [[internal fertilisation|internally fertilised]] eggs. Reproduction in ''T. cancriformis'' varies with [[latitude]], with sexual reproduction dominating in the south of its range, and [[parthenogenesis]] dominating in the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Graham Bell |year=1982 |title=The masterpiece of nature: the evolution and genetics of sexuality |series=Croom Helm applied biology series |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-85664-753-6 |page=243 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q5g9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Triops'' eggs enter a state of extended [[diapause]] when dry, and will tolerate temperatures of up to {{convert|98|C|F}} for 16 hours, whereas the adult cannot survive temperatures above {{convert|34|C|F}} for 24&amp;nbsp;hours or {{convert|40|C|F}} for 2&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;ref name="Osborne"&gt;{{cite book |author=Patrick L.

== Taxonomy ==
[[File:Triops closeup.jpg|thumb|Closeup of adult ''Triops'' showing naupliar ocellus]]
The name ''Triops'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|[[wikt:τρία|τρία]]}}
(''{{lang|el|tría}}'') meaning "three" and {{lang|el|[[:wikt:ὤψ|ὤψ]]}} (''{{lang|el|ops}}'') meaning "eye".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Scarborough |year=1992 |title=Medical and biological terminologies: classical origins |series=Volume 13 of Oklahoma Series in Classical Culture |publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]] |isbn=978-0-8061-3029-3 |chapter=Crustacea |pages=75–81 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hjwN65nZBE0C&amp;pg=PA75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head of ''T. longicaudatus'' bears a pair of [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] [[compound eye]]s that lie close to each other and are nearly fused together. The compound eyes are generally sessile (not stalked). In addition, there is a [[Nauplius (larva)|naupliar]] [[ocellus]] (the "third eye") between them. The compound eyes are on the surface of the head, but the ocellus is deep within the head. All the eyes, however, are easily visible through the shell covering of the head.

[[Franz von Paula Schrank]] was the first author to use the [[genus]] name ''Triops'',&lt;ref name="Møller" /&gt; coining it in his 1803 work on the fauna of [[Bavaria]]. Their [[German language|German]] name was ''{{lang|de|Dreyauge}}'', which means 'three-eye'. He collected and described specimens from the same locality in [[Regensburg]] from which [[Jacob Christian Schäffer|Schäffer]], another naturalist who had studied the Notostraca, obtained his specimens in the 1750s. However, other authors, starting with [[Louis Augustin Guillaume Bosc]], had adopted the genus name ''Apus'' for the organisms Schrank had named ''Triops''

[[Ludwig Keilhack]] used the genus name ''Triops'' in his 1909 field identification key of the freshwater fauna of [[Germany]]. He suggested that the genus name ''Apus'' be replaced by ''Triops'' Schrank since an avian genus had already been described by [[Giovanni Antonio Scopoli]] under the name ''[[Apus (genus)|Apus]]''.&lt;ref name="Møller"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ole S. Møller |author2=Jørgen Olesen |author3=Jens T.

He suggested that the name '…''Triops'' Schrank, may be returned to the obscurity from which it was unearthed'.&lt;ref name="Møller" /&gt; This controversy continued and was not resolved until the 1950s.

In his 1955 taxonomic review of the Notostraca, [[Alan R. Longhurst]] supported Keilhack's genus name ''Triops'' over ''Apus''. Longhurst provided historical evidence to support this position.&lt;ref name="Møller" /&gt; The [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN) followed Longhurst in their 1958 ruling on the usage and origin of the genus names ''Triops'' and ''Apus''. They rejected the genus name ''Apus'' and instead recognized the genus name ''Triops'' Schrank, 1803 (ICZN name no. 1246).&lt;ref name="Møller" /&gt;

''T. mauritanicus'' was considered a subspecies of ''T. cancriformis'' by Longhurst in 1955, but was given full species status again by Korn ''et al.'' in 2006.&lt;ref name="Korn"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Michael Korn |author2= Federico Marrone |author3= Jose L.

Note that for several of these species there are different varieties, some of which have recently been suggested as subspecies and even separate species. ''T. longicaudatus'', for example, may actually be several species lumped together, and ''[[Triops cancriformis|T. cancriformis]]'' is generally recognized as having three subspecies: ''T. cancriformis cancriformis'',
''T. c. mauretanicus'', and ''T. c. simplex''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mytriops.com/articles/triops_species2.stm Species list] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006181802/http://mytriops.com/articles/triops_species2.stm |date=2011-10-06 }}. Mytriops.com. Retrieved on 2016-07-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the albino form has the special name of ''T. cancriformis'' var. ''Beni-Kabuto Ebi''.

== Human uses ==

[[File:Beni-KabutoEbiAlbino1.jpg|300px|thumb|''Triops cancriformis'' "Beni-Kabuto Ebi Albino" showing translucent carapace. As the animal grows the carapace will become more opaque but will never take on the color pattern normally associated with ''T. cancriformis'']]
[[File:Triopslongredcanc.jpg|350px|thumb|Captive ''Triops cancriformis'' (left) and ''Triops longicaudatus'' (right) feeding on carrot]]

The species is considered a human ally against the [[West Nile virus]], as the individuals consume ''[[Culex]]'' mosquito larvae. They also are used as a [[biological agent]] in Japan, eating weeds in rice [[Paddy field|paddies]]. The Beni-Kabuto Ebi Albino variant of ''T. cancriformis'' is particularly valued for this purpose. In [[Wyoming]], the presence of ''T. longicaudatus'' usually indicates a good chance of the hatching of [[American spadefoot toads|spadefoot frogs]].

Dried eggs of ''T. longicaudatus'' are sold in kits to be raised as aquarium pets, sold under the name of "aquasaurs", "trigons" or "triops". Among enthusiasts, ''T. cancriformis'' is also common. Other species often encountered in captivity include ''[[Triops australiensis|T. australiensis]]'', ''[[Triops newberryi|T. newberryi]]'' and ''[[Triops granarius|T. granarius]]''. The red (albino?) forms of ''T. longicaudatus'' and ''T. cancriformis'' are also fairly common among enthusiasts and have been the subject of numerous YouTube videos.

Captive ''Triops'' are frequently kept in aquariums and fed a diet consisting mainly of carrots, shrimp pellets and dried shrimp.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140331201144/http://www.triops.com/CMS/html/index.aspx?p32sda=faq&amp;psdge87d=310&amp;tl97abi=90 Frequently Asked Questions]. triops.com&lt;/ref&gt; Often they are also given living shrimp and ''Daphnia'' as live prey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mytriops.com/articles/triops_food_recipes.stm Triops food] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070529034011/http://mytriops.com/articles/triops_food_recipes.stm |date=2007-05-29 }}. Mytriops.com (2003-10-28). Retrieved on 2016-07-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Because they can feed on just about anything they are also fed lunch meat,  crackers, potatoes etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://triops-eggs.com/triops-and-their-food/ Triops and their food]. Triops-eggs.com. Retrieved on 2016-07-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

They will also feed themselves by grazing on algae and detritus from the bottom and sides of the tank, and on small particles clinging to sponge filters or to [[Marimo]] moss balls which are often cultured alongside ''Triops''.

The '''Worksop Bestiary''' is a 12th-century [[illuminated manuscript]] containing a [[bestiary]] and other medieval [[Latin]] texts on [[natural history]], largely compiled from the ''[[Physiologus]]'', the ''Imago mundi'' of [[Honorius Augustodunensis]], the ''[[Etymologiae]]'' of St. [[Isidore of Seville]], and an extract from the [[Book of Genesis]]. It also contains the text of a sermon on [[Saint Joseph]], falsely ascribed to [[Saint Augustine]].

The book is now in the [[Morgan Library &amp; Museum]], New York, as MS M. 81.&lt;ref name="Morgan Library record"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://corsair.morganlibrary.org/msdescr/BBM0081a.pdf | title=Catalogue description of the Worksop Bestiary | publisher=The Pierpont Morgan Library | work=Catalogue description | accessdate=February 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was presented to the [[Augustinian]] Worksop Priory Church of Saint Mary and Saint Cuthbert (now [[Worksop Priory]]), by Philip, the [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of [[Lincoln Cathedral]], in 1187. Later owners of the manuscript include the [[Duke of Hamilton|dukes of Hamilton]], the [[Prussia]]n government, [[William Morris]], and Richard Bennett of [[Manchester]], from whom the Pierpont Morgan library acquired it in 1902.

The book consists of 120 pages, contains 106 miniature illuminations, and is written in a [[black letter]] [[Carolingian minuscule|minuscule]] [[book hand]].

The '''World Health Organization''' ('''WHO''') is a [[list of specialized agencies of the United Nations|specialized agency of the United Nations]] that is concerned with international [[public health]]. It was established on 7 April 1948, and is headquartered in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. The WHO is a member of the [[United Nations Development Group]]. Its predecessor, the Health Organization, was an agency of the [[League of Nations]].

The constitution of the World Health Organization had been signed by 61 countries on 22 July 1946, with the first meeting of the [[World Health Assembly]] finishing on 22 July 1946. It incorporated the {{lang|fr|[[Office International d'Hygiène Publique]]|italic=no}} and the League of Nations Health Organization. Since its establishment, it has played a leading role in the [[eradication of infectious diseases|eradication]] of [[smallpox]]. Its current priorities include [[communicable disease]]s, in particular [[HIV/AIDS]], [[Ebola]], [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]]; the mitigation of the effects of [[non-communicable disease]]s such as sexual and [[reproductive health]], development, and aging; nutrition, [[food security]] and healthy eating; occupational health; substance abuse; and driving the development of reporting, publications, and networking.

The WHO is responsible for the [[World Health Report]], the worldwide [[World Health Survey]], and [[World Health Day]]. The current Director-General of the WHO is [[Tedros Adhanom]], who started his five-year term on 1 July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/tedros-director-general/en/ |title=Dr Tedros takes office as WHO Director-General |date=1 July 2017 |publisher=World Health Organization }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Origins ===
The [[International Sanitary Conferences]], originally held on 23 June 1851, were the first predecessors of the WHO. A series of 14 conferences that lasted from 1851 to 1938, the International Sanitary Conferences worked to combat many diseases, chief among them [[cholera]], [[yellow fever]], and the [[bubonic plague]]. The conferences were largely ineffective until the seventh, in 1892; when an International Sanitary Convention that dealt with cholera was passed. Five years later, a convention for the plague was signed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/62873/1/14549_eng.pdf |title=The scientific background of the International Sanitary Conferences, 1851–1938 |last=Howard-Jones |first=Norman |publisher=World Health Organization |year=1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In part as a result of the successes of the Conferences, the [[Pan-American Sanitary Bureau]], and the {{lang|fr|Office International d'Hygiène Publique|italic=no}} were soon founded in 1902 and 1907, respectively. When the [[League of Nations]] was formed in 1920, they established the Health Organization of the League of Nations. After [[World War II]], the United Nations absorbed all the other health organizations, to form the WHO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McCarthy |first=Michael |date=October 2002 |title=A brief history of the World Health Organization. |url=http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS014067360211244X.pdf |journal=[[The Lancet]] |volume=360 |issue=9340 |pages=1111–12 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(02)11244-x|pmid=12387972 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Establishment===
During the 1945 United Nations Conference on International Organization, [[Szeming Sze]], a delegate from China, conferred with Norwegian and Brazilian delegates on creating an international health organization under the auspices of the new United Nations. After failing to get a resolution passed on the subject, [[Alger Hiss]], the Secretary General of the conference, recommended using a declaration to establish such an organization. Sze and other delegates lobbied and a declaration passed calling for an international conference on health.&lt;ref name="Pitt ULS"&gt;[http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=ascead;cc=ascead;q1=Szeming%20Sze;rgn=main;view=text;didno=US-PPiU-ua90f141 Sze Szeming Papers, 1945–2014, UA.90.F14.1], University Archives, Archives Service Center, University of Pittsburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the word "world", rather than "international", emphasized the truly global nature of what the organization was seeking to achieve.&lt;ref name="bmj1948"&gt;{{cite journal |title=World Health Organization |journal=The British Medical Journal |volume=2 |number=4570 |date=7 August 1948|pages=302–303 |jstor=25364565 |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.4570.302|pmc=1614381 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution of the World Health Organization was signed by all 51 countries of the United Nations, and by 10 other countries, on 22 July 1946.&lt;ref name=chronicle_1947&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Move towards a New Health Organization: International Health Conference |journal=Chronicle of the World Health Organization |volume=1 |issue=1–2 |pages=6–11 |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hist/chronicles/chronicle_1947.pdf |format=PDF |year=1947 |accessdate=18 July 2007 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=9 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809031008/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hist/chronicles/chronicle_1947.pdf |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It thus became the first specialized agency of the United Nations to which every member subscribed.&lt;ref name="shimkin"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The World Health Organization |first=Michael B. |last=Shimkin|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=104 |number=2700 |date=27 September 1946 |pages=281–283 |jstor=1674843 |doi=10.1126/science.104.2700.281|pmid=17810349 |pmc=1614381 |citeseerx=10.1.1.1016.3166 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its constitution formally came into force on the first [[World Health Day]] on 7 April 1948, when it was ratified by the 26th member state.&lt;ref name=chronicle_1947/&gt; The first meeting of the [[World Health Assembly]] finished on 24 July 1948, having secured a budget of {{US$|5 million}} (then {{GBP|1250000}}) for the 1949 year.

===Operational history===
[[File:Directors of Global Smallpox Eradication Program.jpg|thumb|Three former directors of the [[Smallpox#Eradication|Global Smallpox Eradication Programme]] read the news that smallpox had been globally eradicated, 1980]]
In 1947 the WHO established an [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] information service via [[telex]], and by 1950 a mass [[tuberculosis]] inoculation drive using the [[BCG vaccine]] was under way. In 1955, the malaria eradication programme was launched, although it was later altered in objective. 1965 saw the first report on [[diabetes mellitus]] and the creation of the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]].&lt;ref name="at60"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/who60/media/exhibition_brochure.pdf |title=WHO at 60 |format=PDF |publisher=WHO |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, [[Viktor Zhdanov]], Deputy Minister of Health for the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], called on the [[World Health Assembly]] to undertake a global initiative to [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradicate]] smallpox, resulting in Resolution WHA11.54.&lt;ref name= Fenner2&gt;{{cite book |last=Fenner |first=Frank |title=Smallpox and Its Eradication |series=History of International Public Health |volume=6 |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva|year=1988 |chapter=Development of the Global Smallpox Eradication Programme |chapterurl=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106_chp9.pdf|pages=366–418 |isbn=978-92-4-156110-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, 2 million people were dying from smallpox every year.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In 1966, the WHO moved its headquarters from the Ariana wing at the [[Palace of Nations]] to a newly constructed HQ elsewhere in Geneva.&lt;ref name="at60"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/archives/exhibits/galleries/building/en/|title=Construction of the main WHO building|year=2016|website=who.int|publisher=WHO|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180611011659/http://www.who.int/archives/exhibits/galleries/building/en/|archive-date=2018-06-11|dead-url=no|access-date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, the World Health Organization intensified the global smallpox eradication by contributing $2.4&amp;nbsp;million annually to the effort and adopted a new [[disease surveillance]] method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www1.szu.cz/svi/cejph/archiv/2010-1-10-full.pdf |first=Vladimír |last=Zikmund  |title=Karel Raška and Smallpox |format=PDF |journal=Central European Journal of Public Health |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=55–56 |date=March 2010 |pmid=20586232 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www1.szu.cz/svi/cejph/archiv/2010-1-11-full.pdf |last1=Holland |first=Walter W. |title=Karel Raška – The Development of Modern Epidemiology.

WHO established a network of consultants who assisted countries in setting up surveillance and containment activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Orenstein |first1=Walter A. |last2=Plotkin |first2=Stanley A. |title=Vaccines |url= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=smallpox&amp;rid=vacc.section.45#47| publisher=W.B.

In 1974, the [[Expanded Programme on Immunization]] and the control programme of [[onchocerciasis]] was started, an important partnership between the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), and the [[World Bank]].

In 1977, the first list of [[essential medicines]] was drawn up, and a year later the ambitious goal of "[[Health For All]]" was declared.

In 1986, the WHO began its global programme on [[HIV/AIDS]]. Two years later preventing discrimination against sufferers was attended to and in 1996 [[UNAIDS]] was formed.

In 1988, the [[Global Polio Eradication Initiative]] was established.&lt;ref name="at60" /&gt;

In 1998, WHO's Director-General highlighted gains in child survival, reduced [[infant mortality]], increased life expectancy and reduced rates of "scourges" such as smallpox and [[polio]] on the fiftieth anniversary of WHO's founding. He, did, however, accept that more had to be done to assist maternal health and that progress in this area had been slow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1998/WHD_98.1-13.pdf |title=World Health Day: Safe Motherhood |date=7 April 1998 |publisher=WHO |format=PDF |page=1 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the [[Stop TB Partnership]] was created along with the UN's formulation of the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. In 2001 the [[measles]] initiative was formed, and credited with reducing global deaths from the disease by 68% by 2007. In 2002, [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] was drawn up to improve the resources available.&lt;ref name="at60"/&gt; In 2006, the organization endorsed the world's first official HIV/AIDS Toolkit for Zimbabwe, which formed the basis for a global prevention, treatment and support plan to fight the [[AIDS pandemic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |editor=Mu Xuequan |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-10/04/content_5167991.htm |title=Zimbabwe launches world's 1st AIDS training package |website=chinaview.cn |agency=Xinhua News Agency |date=4 October 2006 |accessdate=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overall focus===
The WHO's Constitution states that its objective "is the attainment by all people of the highest possible level of health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/entity/governance/eb/who_constitution_en.pdf|publisher=World Health Organization|format=PDF|title=Constitution of the World Health Organization |accessdate=11 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO fulfills this objective through its functions as defined in its Constitution: (a) To act as the directing and coordinating authority on international health work; (b) To establish and maintain effective collaboration with the United Nations, specialized agencies, governmental health administrations, professional groups and such other organizations as may be deemed appropriate; (c) To assist Governments, upon request, in strengthening health services; (d) To furnish appropriate technical assistance and, in emergencies, necessary aid upon the request or acceptance of Governments; (e) To provide or assist in providing, upon the request of the United Nations, health services and facilities to special groups, such as the peoples of trust territories; (f) To establish and maintain such administrative and technical services as may be required, including epidemiological and statistical services; (g) to stimulate and advance work to eradicate epidemic, endemic and other diseases; (h) To promote, in co-operation with other specialized agencies where necessary, the prevention of accidental injuries; (i) To promote, in co-operation with other specialized agencies where necessary, the improvement of nutrition, housing, sanitation, recreation, economic or working conditions and other aspects of environmental hygiene; (j) To promote co-operation among scientific and professional groups which contribute to the advancement of health; (k) To propose conventions, agreements and regulations, and make recommendations with respect to international health matters and to perform.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

{{As of |2012}}, the WHO has defined its role in public health as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/about/role/en/index.html |title=The role of WHO in public health |publisher=WHO |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* setting norms and standards and promoting and monitoring their implementation;
* articulating ethical and evidence-based policy options;
* providing technical support, catalyzing change, and building sustainable institutional capacity; and
* monitoring the health situation and assessing health trends.
* [[CRVS (Civil Registration and Vital Statistic)|CRVS (Civil Registration and Vital Statistics)]] to provide monitoring of vital events (birth, death, wedding, divorce).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/civil_registration/en/|title=Civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS)|website=who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communicable diseases===
The 2012–2013 WHO budget identified 5 areas among which funding was distributed.&lt;ref name="20123budget"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/pb/2012-2013/PB_2012%E2%80%932013_eng.pdf |title=Programme Budget, 2012–2013|publisher=WHO |format=PDF |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of those five areas related to [[communicable diseases]]: the first, to reduce the "health, social and economic burden" of communicable diseases in general; the second to combat [[HIV/AIDS]], [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]] in particular.&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;

As of 2015, the WHO has worked within the [[UNAIDS]] network and strived to involve sections of society other than health to help deal with the economic and social effects of [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |format=pdf |title=Global health sector strategy on HIV/AIDS 2011–2015 |publisher=WHO  |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501651_eng.pdf |year=2011 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with UNAIDS, WHO has set itself the interim task between 2009 and 2015 of reducing the number of those aged 15–24 years who are infected by 50%; reducing new HIV infections in children by 90%; and reducing HIV-related deaths by 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |format=pdf |title=Global health sector strategy on HIV/AIDS 2011–2015 |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501651_eng.pdf |publisher=WHO |year=2011 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, WHO had dropped its commitment to a global malaria eradication campaign as too ambitious, it retained a strong commitment to malaria control. WHO's Global Malaria Programme works to keep track of malaria cases, and future problems in malaria control schemes. As of 2012, the WHO was to report as to whether [[RTS,S]]/AS01, were a viable [[malaria vaccine]]. For the time being, [[insecticide]]-treated [[mosquito net]]s and insecticide sprays are used to prevent the spread of malaria, as are [[antimalarial drugs]] – particularly to vulnerable people such as pregnant women and young children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/index.html |title=Malaria Fact Sheet |website=WHO Media Centre |publisher=WHO |date=April 2012 |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1990 and 2010, WHO's help has contributed to a 40% decline in the number of deaths from [[tuberculosis]], and since 2005, over 46 million people have been treated and an estimated 7&amp;nbsp;million lives saved through practices advocated by WHO. These include engaging national governments and their financing, early diagnosis, standardising treatment, monitoring of the spread and effect of tuberculosis and stabilising the drug supply. It has also recognized the vulnerability of victims of HIV/AIDS to tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs104/en/index.html |title=Tuberculosis Fact Sheet |website=WHO work mediacenter|publisher=WHO |date=April 2012 |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, WHO launched the Global Polio Eradication Initiative to eradicate [[polio]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} It has also been successful in helping to reduce cases by 99% since which partnered WHO with [[Rotary International]], the [[US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), the [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF), and smaller organizations. {{As of| 2011}}, it has been working to immunize young children and prevent the re-emergence of cases in countries declared "polio-free".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs114/en/ |title=Poliomyelitis Fact Sheet |website=WHO Media Centre |publisher=WHO |date=October 2011 |accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, a study was conducted where why Polio Vaccines may not be enough to eradicate the Virus &amp; conduct new technology. Polio is now on the verge of extinction, thanks to a Global Vaccination Drive. the World Health Organization (WHO) stated the eradication programme has saved millions from deadly disease. {{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Non-communicable diseases===
Another of the thirteen WHO priority areas is aimed at the prevention and reduction of "disease, disability and premature deaths from chronic [[noncommunicable disease]]s, [[mental disorder]]s, violence and [[injury prevention|injuries]], and [[visual impairment]]".&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/en/ |title=WHO Violence and Injury Prevention |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Division of Noncommunicable Diseases for Promoting Health through the Life-course Sexual and Reproductive Health has published the magazine, ''Entre Nous'', across Europe since 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ''Entre Nous'' | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170715203751/http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Life-stages/sexual-and-reproductive-health/publications/entre-nous/entre-nous | archive-date = 15 July 2017 | url = http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Life-stages/sexual-and-reproductive-health/publications/entre-nous/entre-nous | website = euro.who.int | publisher = [[WHO]]/Europe | oclc = 782375711 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental health===
The WHO estimates that 12.6&amp;nbsp;million people died as a result of living or working in an unhealthy environment in 2012 –  this accounts for nearly 1 in 4 of total global deaths. Environmental risk factors, such as air, water and soil pollution, chemical exposures, climate change, and ultraviolet radiation, contribute to more than 100 diseases and injuries. This can result in a number of [[List of pollution-related diseases|pollution-related diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= An estimated 12.6&amp;nbsp;million deaths each year are attributable to unhealthy environments |url= http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2016/deaths-attributable-to-unhealthy-environments/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life course and life style===
WHO works to "reduce [[morbidity]] and [[Death|mortality]] and improve health during key stages of life, including pregnancy, childbirth, the [[Infant|neonatal period]], [[childhood]] and adolescence, and improve [[Sexual health|sexual]] and [[reproductive health]] and promote active and healthy aging for all individuals".&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/hrp/en/index.html |title=Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction |publisher=WHO |accessdate=9 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218011849/http://www.who.int/hrp/en/index.html |archive-date=18 February 2012 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also tries to prevent or reduce risk factors for "health conditions associated with use of tobacco, alcohol, [[drugs]] and other psychoactive substances, unhealthy diets and physical inactivity and [[unsafe sex]]".&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/tobacco/en/ |title=Tobacco |publisher=WHO |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/en/ |title=Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health |publisher=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO works to improve nutrition, [[food safety]] and [[food security]] and to ensure this has a positive effect on [[public health]] and [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;

===Surgery and trauma care===

The WHO promotes road safety as a means to reduce traffic-related injuries.&lt;ref&gt;WHO. [http://www.who.int/roadsafety/decade_of_action/en/ Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011–2020]&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO has also worked on global initiatives in surgery, including emergency and essential surgical care,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/surgery/globalinitiative/en/ |title=Global Initiative for Emergency and Essential Surgical Care |publisher=WHO |date=11 August 2011 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; trauma care,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/emergencycare/trauma/essential-care/en/ |title=Essential trauma care project |publisher=WHO |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and safe surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/patientsafety/safesurgery/en/ |title=Safe Surgery Saves Lives |publisher=WHO |date=17 June 2011 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[WHO Surgical Safety Checklist]] is in current use worldwide in the effort to improve patient safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/patientsafety/safesurgery/en/ |title=Safe Surgery Saves Lives |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emergency work===
The World Health Organization's primary objective in natural and man-made emergencies is to coordinate with member states and other stakeholders to "reduce avoidable loss of life and the burden of disease and disability."&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;

On 5 May 2014, WHO announced that the spread of [[Poliomyelitis|polio]] was a world health emergency – outbreaks of the disease in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East were considered "extraordinary".&lt;ref name="AP-20140505"&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff Writer--&gt; |title=UN: Spread of polio now an world health emergency |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20140505/eu-med-polio-emergency-6e6900dc37.html |date=5 May 2014 |location=London |agency=[[AP News]] |publisher=Mindspark Interactkookve Network, Inc. |accessdate=5 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140505"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gladstone |first=Rick |title=Polio Spreading at Alarming Rates, World Health Organization Declares |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/06/health/world-health-organization-polio-health-emergency.html |date=5 May 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=5 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 August 2014, WHO declared that the spread of [[Ebola]] was a public health emergency; an outbreak which was believed to have started in Guinea had spread to other nearby countries such as Liberia and Sierra Leone. The situation in West Africa was considered very serious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |first1=Kate |last1=Kelland |first2=Felix |last2=Onuah |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/08/us-health-ebola-africa-idUSKBN0G81Q820140808 |title=WHO declares Ebola an international health emergency |location=London/Lagos |agency=[[Reuters]]  |date=8 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health policy===
WHO addresses government [[health policy]] with two aims: firstly, "to address the underlying social and economic determinants of health through policies and programmes that enhance health equity and integrate pro-poor, gender-responsive, and human rights-based approaches" and secondly "to promote a healthier environment, intensify primary prevention and influence public policies in all sectors so as to address the root causes of environmental threats to health".&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;

The organization develops and promotes the use of evidence-based tools, norms and standards to support member states to inform [[health policy]] options. It oversees the implementation of the [[International Health Regulations]], and publishes a series of [[medical classification]]s; of these, three are over-reaching "reference classifications": the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases]] (ICD), the [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health]] (ICF) and the [[International Classification of Health Interventions]] (ICHI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/classifications/en/FamilyDocument2007.pdf |title=Family of International Classifications: definition, scope and purpose |publisher=WHO |format=PDF |year=2007 |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other international policy frameworks produced by WHO include the [[International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes]] (adopted in 1981),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/infantfeeding/9241541601/en/ |title=International Code of Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]] (adopted in 2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/fctc/about/en/index.html |title=About the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Health Human Resources#Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel|Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel]] (adopted in 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/hrh/migration/code/WHO_global_code_of_practice_EN.pdf |title=WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel  |publisher=WHO |year=2010 |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of health services, WHO looks to improve "governance, financing, staffing and management" and the availability and quality of evidence and research to guide policy. It also strives to "ensure improved access, quality and use of medical products and technologies".&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt; WHO – working with donor agencies and national governments – can improve their use of and their reporting about their use of research evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, S.J., Lavis, J.N. &amp; Bennett, S., 2009. The Use of Research Evidence in Two International Organizations' Recommendations about Health Systems. Healthcare Policy, 5(1), pp.66–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governance and support===
The remaining two of WHO's thirteen identified policy areas relate to the role of WHO itself:&lt;ref name="20123budget"/&gt;
* "to provide leadership, strengthen governance and foster partnership and collaboration with countries, the United Nations system, and other stakeholders in order to fulfill the mandate of WHO in advancing the global health agenda"; and
* "to develop and sustain WHO as a flexible, learning organization, enabling it to carry out its mandate more efficiently and effectively".

====Partnerships====
The WHO along with the [[World Bank]] constitute the core team responsible for administering the [[International Health Partnership]] (IHP+). The IHP+ is a group of partner governments, development agencies, civil society and others committed to improving the health of citizens in [[developing country|developing countries]]. Partners work together to put international principles for [[aid effectiveness]] and development co-operation into practice in the health sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalhealthpartnership.net/en/ |title=International Health Partnership |publisher=IHP+ |accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization relies on contributions from renowned scientists and professionals to inform its work, such as the [[WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/biologicals/expert_committee/en/ |title=WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/bookorders/anglais/detart1.jsp?codlan=1&amp;codcol=10&amp;codcch=874 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231145418/http://apps.who.int/bookorders/anglais/detart1.jsp?codlan=1&amp;codcol=10&amp;codcch=874|archivedate=31 December 2016|title=WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy: Seventh Report |website=WHO Press Office |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Interprofessional education#WHO Study Group on Interprofessional Education &amp; Collaborative Practice|WHO Study Group on Interprofessional Education &amp; Collaborative Practice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/hrh/professionals/coordination/en/index.html |title=WHO Study Group on Interprofessional Education and Collaborative Practice |publisher=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WHO runs the Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research, targeted at improving [[health policy]] and [[health system|systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/alliance-hpsr/en/index.html |title=Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research |publisher=WHO |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WHO also aims to improve access to health research and literature in developing countries such as through the [[HINARI]] network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hinari/en/ |title=HINARI Access to Research in Health Programme |publisher=Who.int |date=13 October 2011 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WHO collaborates with the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, UNITAID, and the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/246178/WHO-HIV-2016.05-eng.pdf?sequence=1|title=|website=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to spearhead and fund the development of HIV programs. 

WHO created the Civil Society Reference Group on HIV&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/246178/WHO-HIV-2016.05-eng.pdf?sequence=1|title=|website=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which brings together other networks that are involved in policy making and the dissemination of guidelines.

WHO, a sector of the United Nations, partners with UNAIDS&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/246178/WHO-HIV-2016.05-eng.pdf?sequence=1|title=|website=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to contribute to the development of HIV responses in different areas of the world.

WHO facilitates technical partnerships through the Technical Advisory Committee on HIV&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=Technical Advisory Committee on HIV|title=|website=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which they created to develop WHO guidelines and policies.

====Public health education and action====
Each year, the organization marks [[World Health Day]] and other observances focusing on a specific [[health promotion]] topic. World Health Day falls on 7 April each year, timed to match the anniversary of WHO's founding. Recent themes have been [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector-borne diseases]] (2014), healthy ageing (2012) and [[drug resistance]] (2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/world-health-day/en/ |title=World Health Day – 7 April |publisher=WHO |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other official global public health campaigns marked by WHO are [[World Tuberculosis Day]], [[World Immunization Week]], [[World Malaria Day]], [[World No Tobacco Day]], [[World Blood Donor Day]], [[World Hepatitis Day]], and [[World AIDS Day]].

As part of the United Nations, the World Health Organization supports work towards the [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/millennium_development_goals/about/en/index.html |title=Millennium Development Goals |publisher=WHO |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the eight Millennium Development Goals, three – reducing child mortality by two-thirds, to reduce maternal deaths by three-quarters, and to halt and begin to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS – relate directly to WHO's scope; the other five inter-relate and affect world health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/millennium_development_goals/MDG-NHPS_brochure_2010.pdf |title=Accelerating progress towards the health-related Millennium Development Goals |year=2010 |format=PDF |page=2 |publisher=WHO |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data handling and publications===
The World Health Organization works to provide the needed health and well-being evidence through a variety of data collection platforms, including the World Health Survey covering almost 400,000 respondents from 70 countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/survey/en/ |title=WHO World Health Survey |publisher=WHO |date=20 December 2010 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health|Study on Global Aging and Adult Health]]'' (SAGE) covering over 50,000 persons over 50 years old in 23 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/systems/sage/en/index.html |title=WHO Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) |publisher=WHO |date=10 March 2011 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Country Health Intelligence Portal (CHIP), has also been developed to provide an access point to information about the health services that are available in different countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Country Health Policy Process|url=http://www.healthintelligenceportal.org/|accessdate=4 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121222652/http://www.healthintelligenceportal.org/|archivedate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The information gathered in this portal is used by the countries to set priorities for future strategies or plans, implement, monitor, and evaluate it.

The WHO has published various tools for measuring and monitoring the capacity of national [[health system]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Monitoring the building blocks of health systems: a handbook of indicators and their measurement strategies |publisher=WHO |year=2010 |url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/systems/monitoring/en/index.htm |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Health Human Resources|health workforces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Handbook on monitoring and evaluation of human resources for health |publisher=WHO |year=2009 |url=http://www.who.int/hrh/resources/handbook/en/index.html |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Global Health Observatory (GHO) has been the WHO's main portal which provides access to data and analyses for key health themes by monitoring health situations around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Health Observatory|url=http://www.who.int/gho/en/index.html|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''WHO Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems'' (WHO-AIMS), the ''WHO Quality of Life Instrument'' (WHOQOL), and the ''Service Availability and Readiness Assessment'' (SARA) provide guidance for data collection.&lt;ref&gt;See respectively:*{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/WHO-AIMS/en/index.html |title=Mental Health: WHO-AIMS |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}} *{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/media/en/76.pdf  |title=WHOQOL-BREF: Introduction, Administration, Scoring and Generic Version of the Assessment |format=PDF |year=1996 |accessdate=27 March 2012}} *{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/systems/sara_introduction/en/ |title=Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative efforts between WHO and other agencies, such as through the [[Health Metrics Network]], also aim to provide sufficient high-quality information to assist governmental decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthmetrics/about/whatishmn/en/index.html |title=What is HMN? |website=Health Metrics Network |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; WHO promotes the development of capacities in member states to use and produce research that addresses their national needs, including through the [[Evidence-Informed Policy Network]] (EVIPNet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/rpc/evipnet/en/ |title=Evidence-Informed Policy Network |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pan American Health Organization]] (PAHO/AMRO) became the first region to develop and pass a policy on research for health approved in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1414&amp;Itemid=931 |title=Policy on Research for Health |publisher=Pan American Health Organization |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 December 2013, a new WHO database, known as [[MiNDbank]], went online. The database was launched on [[Human Rights Day]], and is part of WHO's QualityRights initiative, which aims to end human rights violations against people with mental health conditions. The new database presents a great deal of information about mental health, substance abuse, disability, human rights, and the different policies, strategies, laws, and service standards being implemented in different countries.&lt;ref name=MiNDbank&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/notes/2013/mindbank-20131210/en/ |title=Mental health information at your fingertips – WHO launches the MiNDbank |publisher=Who.int |date=10 December 2013 |accessdate=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also contains important international documents and information. The database allows visitors to access the health information of WHO member states and other partners. Users can review policies, laws, and strategies and search for the best practices and success stories in the field of mental health.&lt;ref name="MiNDbank"/&gt;

The WHO regularly publishes a ''[[World Health Report]]'', its leading publication, including an expert assessment of a specific [[global health]] topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=WHO |url=http://www.who.int/whr/en/index.html |title=The World Health Report |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other publications of WHO include the ''[[Bulletin of the World Health Organization]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/en/ |title=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal]]'' (overseen by EMRO),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emro.who.int/emhj.htm |title=Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Human Resources for Health]]'' (published in collaboration with [[BioMed Central]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.human-resources-health.com/ |title=Human Resources for Health |publisher=BioMed Central |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Pan American Journal of Public Health]]'' (overseen by PAHO/AMRO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://new.paho.org/journal/ |title=Revista Panamericana de Salud Pública/Pan American Journal of Public Health |publisher=Pan American Health Organization |accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the World Health Organization drafted a global health sector strategy on HIV. In the draft, the World Health Organization outlines its commitment to ending the AIDS epidemic by the year 2030&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hiv/strategy2016-2021/ghss-hiv/en/|title=Global health sector strategy on HIV, 2016–2021|website=World Health Organization|access-date=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with interim targets for the year 2020. In order to make achievements towards these targets, the draft lists actions that countries and the WHO can take, such as a commitment to universal health coverage, medical accessibility, prevention and eradication of disease, and efforts to educate the public. Some notable points made in the draft include addressing gender inequity where females are nearly twice as likely as men to get infected with HIV and tailoring resources to mobilized regions where the health system may be compromised due to natural disasters, etc. Among the points made, it seems clear that although the prevalence of HIV transmission is declining, there is still a need for resources, health education, and global efforts to end this epidemic. 

==Structure==
The World Health Organization is a member of the [[United Nations Development Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13 |title=UNDG Members |publisher=Undg.org |accessdate=9 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511144047/http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13 |archivedate=11 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Membership===
[[File:World Health Organization membership status map.png|thumb|right|Countries by World Health Organization membership status]]
{{As of|2016}}, the WHO has 194 member states: all of them Member States of the United Nations except for the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]].&lt;ref name="countries"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=WHO |url=http://www.who.int/countries/en/ |title=Countries |accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A state becomes a full member of WHO by ratifying the treaty known as the Constitution of the World Health Organization.) {{As of|2013}}, it also had two associate members, Puerto Rico and [[Tokelau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Appendix 1, Members of the World Health Organization (at 31&amp;nbsp;May 2009)|url=http://apps.who.int/gb/bd/PDF/bd47/EN/members-en.pdf|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other countries have been granted [[observer status]]. [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] is an observer as a "national liberation movement" recognized by the [[League of Arab States]] under United Nations Resolution 3118. The [[Holy See]] also attends as an observer, as does the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Order of Malta]].&lt;ref name="observerWHO"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xou_nD9jJF0C |title=World Health Organization |first1=Gian Luca |last1=Burci |first2=Claude-Henri  |last2=Vignes |publisher= Kluwer Law International |year=2004 |isbn=978-90-411-2273-5 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Taiwan was invited under the name of "Republic of China".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xitem=103148&amp;ctnode=427&amp;mp=9 |title=Taiwan Today, Taiwan delegation to participate in WHA |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WHO Member States appoint delegations to the [[World Health Assembly]], WHO's supreme decision-making body. All UN Member States are eligible for WHO membership, and, according to the WHO website, "other countries may be admitted as members when their application has been approved by a simple majority vote of the World Health Assembly".&lt;ref name="countries"/&gt; Liechtenstein is currently the only UN member not in the WHO membership.

In addition, the UN observer organizations [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] and [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] have entered into "official relations" with WHO and are invited as observers. In the [[World Health Assembly]] they are seated alongside the other NGOs.&lt;ref name="observerWHO"/&gt;

===World Health Assembly and Executive Board===
[[File:World Health Organisation building south face 2.jpg|thumb|WHO Headquarters in Geneva]]
The [[World Health Assembly]] (WHA) is the legislative and supreme body of WHO. Based in Geneva, it typically meets yearly in May. It appoints the Director-General every five years and votes on matters of policy and finance of WHO, including the proposed budget. It also reviews reports of the Executive Board and decides whether there are areas of work requiring further examination. The Assembly elects 34 members, technically qualified in the field of health, to the Executive Board for three-year terms. The main functions of the Board are to carry out the decisions and policies of the Assembly, to advise it and to facilitate its work.&lt;ref name="governance"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/governance/en/index.html |title=Governance |publisher=WHO |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current chairman of the executive board is Dr. [[Assad Hafeez]].

The regional divisions of WHO were created between 1949 and 1952, and are based on article 44 of the WHO's constitution, which allowed the WHO to "establish a [single] regional organization to meet the special needs of [each defined] area". Many decisions are made at regional level, including important discussions over WHO's budget, and in deciding the members of the next assembly, which are designated by the regions.&lt;ref name="burci53"&gt;{{harvnb|Burci|Vignes|2004|pages=53–57}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each region has a Regional Committee, which generally meets once a year, normally in the autumn. Representatives attend from each member or associative member in each region, including those states that are not fully recognized. For example, [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] attends meetings of the [[Eastern Mediterranean Regional office of World Health Organization|Eastern Mediterranean Regional office]]. Each region also has a regional office.&lt;ref name="burci53"/&gt; Each Regional Office is headed by a Regional Director, who is elected by the Regional Committee. The Board must approve such appointments, although as of 2004, it had never over-ruled the preference of a regional committee. The exact role of the board in the process has been a subject of debate, but the practical effect has always been small.&lt;ref name="burci53"/&gt; Since 1999, Regional Directors serve for a once-renewable five-year term, and typically take their position on 1 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/gb/archive/pdf_files/WHA52/ew2.pdf|title=A year of change: Reports of the Executive Board on its 102nd and 103rd sessions|website=|publisher=WHO|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011220426/http://apps.who.int/gb/archive/pdf_files/WHA52/ew2.pdf|archive-date=11 October 2017|dead-url=no|accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each Regional Committee of the WHO consists of all the Health Department heads, in all the governments of the countries that constitute the Region. Aside from electing the Regional Director, the Regional Committee is also in charge of setting the guidelines for the implementation, within the region, of the health and other policies adopted by the [[World Health Assembly]]. The Regional Committee also serves as a progress review board for the actions of WHO within the Region.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The Regional Director is effectively the head of WHO for his or her Region. The RD manages and/or supervises a staff of health and other experts at the regional offices and in specialized centres. The RD is also the direct supervising authority—concomitantly with the WHO Director-General—of all the heads of WHO country offices, known as WHO Representatives, within the Region.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

|}
The head of the organization is the Director-General, elected by the [[World Health Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/governance/en/|title=WHO Governance|publisher=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term lasts for 5 years, and Director-Generals are typically appointed in May, when the Assembly meets. The current Director-General is Dr. [[Tedros Adhanom]] Ghebreyesus, who was appointed on 1 July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/director-general-elect/en/|title=World Health Assembly elects Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus as new WHO Director-General|publisher=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Employees ===
The WHO employs 8,500 people in 147 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Employment: who we are |url= http://www.who.int/employment/about_who/en/ |publisher=WHO |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In support of the principle of a tobacco-free work environment, the WHO does not recruit cigarette smokers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Employment: who we need|url=http://www.who.int/employment/who_we_need/en/|publisher=WHO |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has previously instigated the [[Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/fctc/en/index.html |title=Framework Convention on Tobacco Control |publisher=WHO |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goodwill Ambassadors ===
The WHO operates "[[World Health Organization Goodwill Ambassador|Goodwill Ambassadors]]"; members of the arts, sports, or other fields of public life aimed at drawing attention to WHO's initiatives and projects. There are currently five Goodwill Ambassadors ([[Jet Li]], [[Nancy Brinker]], [[Peng Liyuan]], [[Yohei Sasakawa]] and the [[Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra]]) and a further ambassador associated with a partnership project ([[Craig David]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/goodwill_ambassadors/en/ |title=Goodwill Ambassador |publisher=WHO |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Country and liaison offices===
The World Health Organization operates 150 country offices in six different regions.&lt;ref name="peopleandoffices"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/about/structure/en/index.html |title=WHO its people and offices |publisher=WHO |date=29 March 2012 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also operates several liaison offices, including those with the [[European Union]], United Nations and a single office covering the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]]. It also operates the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] in [[Lyon]], France, and the [[WHO Centre for Health Development]] in [[Kobe]], Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/about/who_offices/en/index.html |title=WHO liaison and other offices |publisher=WHO |accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional offices include those in [[Pristina]]; the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]; the US-Mexico Border Field Office in [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]]; the Office of the Caribbean Program Coordination in Barbados; and the Northern Micronesia office.&lt;ref name="detailedinformation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/countryfocus/country_offices/details/en/index.html |title=Detailed information of WHO offices in countries, territories and areas |publisher=WHO |accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There will generally be one WHO country office in the capital, occasionally accompanied by satellite-offices in the provinces or sub-regions of the country in question.

The country office is headed by a WHO Representative (WR). {{As of|2010}}, the only WHO Representative outside Europe to be a national of that country was for the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] ("Libya"); all other staff were international. WHO Representatives in the Region termed the Americas are referred to as PAHO/WHO Representatives. In Europe, WHO Representatives also serve as Head of Country Office, and are nationals with the exception of Serbia; there are also Heads of Country Office in Albania, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Uzbekistan.&lt;ref name="detailedinformation"/&gt; The WR is member of the [[United Nations System|UN system]] country team which is coordinated by the UN System [[Resident Coordinator]].

The country office consists of the WR, and several health and other experts, both foreign and local, as well as the necessary support staff.&lt;ref name="peopleandoffices" /&gt; The main functions of WHO country offices include being the primary adviser of that country's government in matters of health and pharmaceutical policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.euro.who.int/en/where-we-work/member-states/hungary/who-country-office |title = WHO Country Office (Hungary) |publisher=WHO EURO |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Financing and partnerships ===
The WHO is financed by contributions from member states and outside donors. {{As of|2012}}, the largest annual assessed contributions from member states came from the United States ($110&amp;nbsp;million), Japan ($58&amp;nbsp;million), Germany ($37&amp;nbsp;million), United Kingdom ($31&amp;nbsp;million) and France ($31&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.who.int/about/resources_planning/2012_2013_AC_summary.pdf |title = Assessed Contributions payable by Member States and Associate Members – 2012–2013 |publisher=WHO |format = PDF |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined 2012–2013 budget has proposed a total expenditure of $3,959&amp;nbsp;million, of which $944&amp;nbsp;million (24%) will come from assessed contributions. This represented a significant fall in outlay compared to the previous 2009–2010 budget, adjusting to take account of previous underspends. Assessed contributions were kept the same. Voluntary contributions will account for $3,015&amp;nbsp;million (76%), of which $800&amp;nbsp;million is regarded as highly or moderately flexible funding, with the remainder tied to particular programmes or objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/pb/2012-2013/PB_2012%E2%80%932013_eng.pdf |title=Programme Budget, 2012–2013|publisher=WHO |format=PDF |accessdate=26 March 2012 |pages=10, 15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the WHO's work has involved increasing collaboration with external bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.who.int/civilsociety/documents/en/RevreportE.pdf |title=WHO's interactions with Civil Society and Nongovernmental Organizations |website=WHO/CSI/2002/WP6 |publisher=WHO |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104615/http://www.who.int/civilsociety/documents/en/RevreportE.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|year=2002 |accessdate=31 March 2012 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2002}}, a total of 473 non-governmental organizations (NGO) had some form of partnership with WHO. There were 189 partnerships with international NGOs in formal "official relations" – the rest being considered informal in character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/civilsociety/documents/en/RevreportE.pdf |title=WHO's interactions with Civil Society and Nongovernmental Organizations |website=WHO/CSI/2002/WP6 |publisher=WHO |year=2002 |accessdate=31 March 2012 |page=10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104615/http://www.who.int/civilsociety/documents/en/RevreportE.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Partners include the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.gatesfoundation.org/livingproofproject/Pages/gavi.aspx |title=Living Proof Project: Partner Profile |publisher=Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundations |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/what-we-do/current-work/transforming-health-systems/grants-grantees/world-health-oganizations-alliance |title=World Health Organization's Alliance for Health Systems and Policy Research |publisher=Rockefeller Foundation |accessdate=31 March 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710062352/https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/what-we-do/current-work/transforming-health-systems/grants-grantees/world-health-oganizations-alliance|archivedate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

=== IAEA – Agreement WHA 12–40 ===
[[File:Alexei Yablokov, Rosa Goncharova, Vassili Nesterenko.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alexey Yablokov]] (left) and [[Vassili Nesterenko]] (farthest right) protesting in front of the World Health Organization headquarters in [[Geneva]], Switzerland in 2008.]]
[[File:Devant OMS 5.jpg|thumb|right|Demonstration on [[Chernobyl disaster]] day near WHO in [[Geneva]]]]
In 1959, the WHO signed Agreement WHA 12–40 with the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA). A selective reading of this document (clause 3) can result in the understanding that the IAEA is able to prevent the WHO from conducting research or work on some areas, as seen hereafter. The agreement states here that the WHO recognizes the IAEA as having responsibility for peaceful nuclear energy without prejudice to the roles of the WHO of promoting health. However, the following paragraph adds that 

"whenever either organization proposes to initiate a programme or activity on a subject in which the other organization has or may have a substantial interest, the first party shall consult the other with a view to adjusting the matter by mutual agreement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=World Health Organization|title=Agreements with Other Intergovernmental Organizations |url = http://apps.who.int/gb/bd/PDF/bd47/EN/agreements-with-other-inter-en.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The nature of this statement has led some pressure groups and activists (including [[Women in Europe for a Common Future]]) to claim that the WHO is restricted in its ability to investigate the [[Acute radiation syndrome|effects on human health of radiation]] caused by the use of [[nuclear power]] and the continuing effects of [[Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents|nuclear disasters]] in [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] and [[Fukushima nuclear disaster|Fukushima]]. They believe WHO must regain what they see as "independence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Independence for WHO|title=Appeal by Health Professionals for Independence of the World Health Organization|url=http://www.ippnw-europe.org/commonFiles/pdfs/Atomenergie/appeal_healthprofessionals.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Women in Europe for a Common Future|title=Open letter on the WHO/IAEA Agreement of 1959|url=http://www.wecf.eu/download/2010/04/letterIAEA-WHO.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.activistmagazine.com/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=703 |title=World Health Organization Accomodates &lt;nowiki&gt;[sic]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Atomic Agency |date=3 June 2007 |work=Activist Magazine |accessdate=27 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928232353/http://www.activistmagazine.com/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=703 |archivedate=28 September 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However as pointed out by Foreman&lt;ref&gt;M.R.StJ. Foreman, Cogent Chemistry, Reactor accident chemistry an update, 2018, 
10.1080/23312009.2018.1450944, https://www.cogentoa.com/article/10.1080/23312009.2018.1450944&lt;/ref&gt; in clause 2 it states.

“2. In particular, and in accordance with the Constitution of the World Health Organization and the Statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency and its agreement with the United Nations together with the exchange of letters related thereto, and taking into account the respective co-ordinating responsibilities of both organizations, it is recognized by the World Health Organization that the International Atomic Energy Agency has the primary responsibility for encouraging, assisting and co- ordinating research and development and practical application of atomic energy for peaceful uses throughout the world without prejudice to the right of the World Health Organization to concern itself with promoting, developing, assisting and co-ordinating international health work, including research, in all its aspects.”

Clearly suggesting that the WHO is free to do as it sees fit on nuclear, radiation and other matters which relate to health.

===Roman Catholic Church and AIDS===
{{Main|Roman Catholic Church and AIDS}}
In 2003, the WHO denounced the [[Roman Curia]]'s health department's opposition to the use of [[condom]]s, saying: "These incorrect statements about condoms and HIV are dangerous when we are facing a global pandemic which has already killed more than 20&amp;nbsp;million people, and currently affects at least 42&amp;nbsp;million."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/oct/09/aids |title=Vatican: condoms don't stop Aids |work=The Guardian |date=9 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2009}}, the [[Catholic Church]] remains opposed to increasing the use of contraception to combat HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/17/pope-africa-condoms-aids |title=Pope claims condoms could make African Aids crisis worse |website=[[The Guardian]] |date=17 March 2009 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the World Health Assembly President, Guyana's Health Minister [[Leslie Ramsammy]], has condemned [[Pope Benedict XVI|Pope Benedict's]] opposition to contraception, saying he was trying to "create confusion" and "impede" proven strategies in the battle against the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hsk4RI5cPLSsvXTY9ZEyWSMrVElg |title=World Health Assembly: Pope Benedict "wrong" |publisher=Google News|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=21 March 2009 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intermittent preventive therapy ===
The aggressive support of the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] for [[intermittent preventive therapy]] of [[malaria]] triggered a memo from the former WHO malaria chief Akira Kochi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McNeil |first=Donald G. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/16/science/16malaria.html |title=Gates Foundation's Influence Criticized |website=The New York Times |date=16 February 2008 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diet and sugar intake ===
Some of the research undertaken or supported by WHO to determine how people's lifestyles and environments are influencing whether they live in better or worse health can be controversial, as illustrated by a 2003 joint WHO/FAO report on nutrition and the prevention of chronic [[non-communicable disease]],&lt;ref&gt;Report of a Joint FAO/WHO Consultation. ''Diet, nutrition and the prevention of chronic diseases''. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2003 (WHO Technical Report Series 916).&lt;/ref&gt; which recommended that sugar should form no more than 10% of a [[healthy diet]]. The report led to lobbying by the sugar industry against the recommendation, to which the WHO/FAO responded by including in the report this statement: "The Consultation recognized that a population goal for free sugars of less than 10% of total energy is controversial". It also stood by its recommendation based upon its own analysis of scientific studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jim |last=Mann |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/81/8/editorial2.pdf |format=pdf |title=Sugar revisited – again |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |year=2003 |volume=81 |number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, WHO reduced recommended sugar levels by half and said that sugar should make up no more than 5% of a healthy diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC News: WHO: Daily sugar intake 'should be halved'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-26449497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 swine flu pandemic===
{{Main|2009 flu pandemic}}
In 2007, the WHO organized work on pandemic [[influenza vaccine]] development through [[clinical trial]]s in collaboration with many experts and health officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/influenza/clinical_evaluation_tables/en/|title=Tables on clinical evaluation of influenza vaccines|website=World Health Organization|access-date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pandemic involving the [[Pandemic H1N1/09 virus|H1N1 influenza virus]] was declared by the then Director-General [[Margaret Chan]] in April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2009/06/who-declares-pandemic-novel-h1n1-virus|title=WHO declares pandemic of novel H1N1 virus|work=CIDRAP|access-date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margret Chan declared in 2010 that the H1N1 has moved into the post-pandemic period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/en/|title=Pandemic (H1N1) 2009|website=World Health Organization|access-date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the post-pandemic period critics claimed the WHO had exaggerated the danger, spreading "fear and confusion" rather than "immediate information".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36421914/ ''WHO admits errors in handling flu pandemic: Agency accused of overplaying danger of the virus as it swept the globe.''] Posted by msnbc.com&lt;/ref&gt; Industry experts countered that the 2009 pandemic had led to "unprecedented collaboration between global health authorities, scientists and manufacturers, resulting in the most comprehensive pandemic response ever undertaken, with a number of vaccines approved for use three months after the pandemic declaration. This response was only possible because of the extensive preparations undertaken during the last decade".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Abelina A | year = 2011 | title = Lessons from pandemic influenza A(H1N1) The research-based vaccine industry's perspective | url = http://www.evm-vaccines.org/IMG/pdf/Lessons_from_pandemic_influenza.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Vaccine | volume = 29 | issue =  6| pages = 1135–1138 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.11.042 | display-authors = etal | pmid = 21115061 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111009120413/http://www.evm-vaccines.org/IMG/pdf/Lessons_from_pandemic_influenza.pdf | archivedate = 9 October 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013–2016 Ebola outbreak and reform efforts===
Following the [[2014 Ebola outbreak]] in West Africa, the organization was heavily criticized for its bureaucracy, insufficient financing, regional structure, and staffing profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffman|first1=SJ|last2=Røttingen|first2=JA|title=Split WHO in two: strengthening political decision-making and securing independent scientific advice|journal=Public Health Journal|date=February 2014|volume=128|issue=2|pages=188–194|doi=10.1016/j.puhe.2013.08.021|pmid=24434035|url=http://www.publichealthjrnl.com/article/S0033-3506(13)00291-6/pdf|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An internal WHO report on the Ebola response pointed to underfunding and the lack of "core capacity" in health systems in developing countries as the primary weaknesses of the existing system.  At the annual World Health Assembly in 2015, Director-General Margaret Chan announced a $100&amp;nbsp;million Contingency Fund for rapid response to future emergencies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA69/A69_21-en.pdf|title=Report of the Review Committee on the Role of the International Health Regulations (2005) in the Ebola Outbreak and Response|date=13 May 2016|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/05/21/408289115/who-calls-for-100-million-emergency-fund-doctor-swat-team|title=WHO Calls For $100 Million Emergency Fund, Doctor 'SWAT Team'}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which it had received $26.9&amp;nbsp;million by April 2016 (for 2017 disbursement).  WHO has budgeted an additional $494&amp;nbsp;million for its Health Emergencies Programme in 2016–17, for which it had received $140&amp;nbsp;million by April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA69/A69_30-en.pdf|title=Reform of WHO's work in health emergency management / WHO Health Emergencies Programme|date=5 May 2016|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was aimed at rebuilding WHO capacity for direct action, which critics said had been lost due to budget cuts in the previous decade that had left the organization in an advisory role dependent on member states for on-the-ground activities.  In comparison, billions of dollars have been spent by developed countries on the 2013–2016 Ebola epidemic and 2015–16 Zika epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/05/25/479228380/who-aims-to-reform-itself-but-health-experts-arent-yet-impressed|title=WHO Aims To Reform Itself But Health Experts Aren't Yet Impressed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FCTC implementation database===
The WHO has a Framework Convention on Tobacco implementation database which is one of the only mechanisms to help enforce compliance with the FCTC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/fctc/reporting/database |title=Archived copy |accessdate=13 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220023429/http://apps.who.int/fctc/reporting/database/ |archivedate=20 February 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been reports of numerous discrepancies between it and national implementation reports on which it was built. As researchers Hoffman and Rizvi report "As of July 4, 2012, 361 (32·7%) of 1104 countries' responses were misreported: 33 (3·0%) were clear errors (eg, database indicated “yes” when report indicated “no”), 270 (24·5%) were missing despite countries having submitted responses, and 58 (5·3%) were, in our opinion, misinterpreted by WHO staff".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hoffman S.J. |author2=Rizvi Z. | year = 2012 | title = WHO's Undermining Tobacco Control | journal = The Lancet | volume = 380 | issue = 9843| pages = 727–728 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61402-0 | pmid=22920746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IARC controversies ===
{{Further|International Agency for Research on Cancer}}
The World Health Organization sub-department, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), has been criticized for the way it analyses the tendency of certain substances and activities to cause cancer and for having a politically motivated bias when it selects studies for its analysis. Ed Yong, a British science journalist, has criticized the agency and its "confusing" category system for misleading the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/10/why-is-the-world-health-organization-so-bad-at-communicating-cancer-risk/412468/|title=Beefing With the World Health Organization's Cancer Warnings|last=Yong|first=Ed|work=The Atlantic|access-date=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcel Kuntz, a French director of research at the&amp;nbsp;[[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|French National Centre for Scientific Research]], criticized the agency for its classification of potentially carcinogenic substances. He claimed that this classification did not take into account the extent of exposure: for example, red meat is qualified as probably carcinogenic, but the quantity of consumed red meat at which it could become dangerous is not specified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.slate.fr/story/126602/pourquoi-fausses-sciences-gouvernent-monde|title=Pourquoi les fausses sciences gouvernent le monde (et pourquoi il faut mettre un terme à ce règne)|work=Slate|access-date=29 April 2017|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversies have erupted multiple times when the IARC has classified many things as Class 2a (probable carcinogens), including cell phone signals, [[glyphosate]], drinking hot beverages, and working as a barber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-cancer-iarc-idUSKCN1261WS|title=Exclusive: U.S. lawmakers to investigate funding of WHO cancer agency|last=Kelland|first=Kate|date=6 October 2016|agency=Reuters|location=London, U.K.|access-date=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political pressure from China has led to Taiwan being barred from membership of the WHO and other UN-affiliated organizations, and in both 2017 and 2018 the WHO refused to allow Taiwanese delegates to attend the [[World Health Assembly|WHO annual assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China warns Taiwan of continued lockout from WHO assembly|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/china-warns-taiwan-of-continued-lockout-from-who-assembly/2017/05/21/0a486d66-3e58-11e7-b29f-f40ffced2ddb_story.html|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=26 May 2017|date=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On multiple occasions Taiwanese journalists have been denied access to report on the assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO Bows to China Pressure, Contravenes Human Rights in Refusing Taiwan Media|url=https://international.thenewslens.com/article/95982|website=international.thenewslens.com|accessdate=22 May 2018|date=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, 172 members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] wrote to the Director General of the World Health Organization to argue for Taiwan's inclusion as an observer at the WHA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=172 Members Push for Taiwan's Participation at World Health Assembly|url=https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/press-release/172-members-push-for-taiwans-participation-at-world-health-assembly/|website=foreignaffairs.house.gov|accessdate=22 May 2018|date=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travel expenses===
According to [[Associated Press|The Associated Press]], the WHO routinely spends about $200&amp;nbsp;million a year on travel expenses, more than it spends to tackle mental health problems, [[HIV/AIDS]], [[Tuberculosis]] and [[Malaria]] combined. In 2016, [[Margaret Chan]], Director-General of WHO from November 2006 to June 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Health Assembly elects Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus as new WHO Director-General|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/director-general-elect/en/|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=25 May 2017|location=Geneva|date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; stayed in a $1000 per night hotel room while visiting West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://apnews.com/1cf4791dc5c14b9299e0f532c75f63b2/AP-Exclusive:-Health-agency-spends-more-on-travel-than-AIDS| title=Health agency spends more on travel than AIDS| first=Maria| last=Cheng| date=22 May 2017| accessdate=27 June 2017| agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Robert Mugabe's role as a goodwill ambassador ===
On 21 October 2017, the Director General [[Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus]] appointed former Zimbabwean president [[Robert Mugabe]] as a [[World Health Organization Goodwill Ambassador|WHO Goodwill Ambassador]] to help promote the fight against non-communicable diseases. The appointment address praised Mugabe for his commitment to public health in Zimbabwe.

The appointment attracted widespread condemnation and criticism in WHO member states and international organizations due to Robert Mugabe's poor record on human rights and presiding over a decline in Zimbabwe's public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-41702662|title=Robert Mugabe's WHO appointment condemned as 'an insult'|date=21 October 2017|work=''BBC News''|access-date=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://theglobeandmail.com/news/world/shock-as-zimbabwes-mugabe-named-who-goodwill-ambassador/article36681266/ | title=WHO chief 'rethinking' appointment of Zimbabwe's Mugabe as 'goodwill ambassador' after widespread condemnation | work=The Globe and Mail | date=21 October 2017 | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the outcry, the following day the appointment was revoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-41713919 | title=WHO cancels Robert Mugabe goodwill ambassador role |work=''BBC News''| date=22 October 2017 |  accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
