      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7652">The following are the events in professional [[sumo]] during 2000.

==Tournaments==
*Hatsu [[honbasho|basho]], [[Ryogoku Kokugikan]], [[Tokyo]], 9&amp;nbsp;– 23 January
*Haru basho, [[Osaka Prefectural Gymnasium]], [[Osaka]], 12&amp;nbsp;– 26 March
*Natsu basho, Ryogoku Kokugikan, Tokyo, 7&amp;nbsp;– 21 May
*Nagoya basho, [[Aichi Prefectural Gymnasium]], [[Nagoya]], 9&amp;nbsp;– 23 July
*Aki basho, Ryogoku Kokugikan, Tokyo, 3&amp;nbsp;– 17 September
*Kyushu basho, [[Fukuoka Kokusai Center|Fukuoka International Centre]], [[Kyushu]], 5&amp;nbsp;– 19 November

==News==

===January===
*At the Hatsu basho in [[Tokyo]], [[sekiwake]] [[Musoyama]] wins his first top [[makuuchi]] division [[yusho]] or tournament championship with a 13–2 record, finishing one win ahead of [[Fujishima stable (2010)|Musashigawa]] stablemate [[Miyabiyama]], and [[yokozuna (sumo)|yokozuna]] [[Takanohana]]. He wins Technique and Outstanding Performance [[sansho (sumo)|Prizes]] (the latter shared with Miyabiyama). The Fighting Spirit Award is given jointly to [[Kyokutenho]] and [[Takanowaka]].  Yokozuna [[Musashimaru]]  pulls out through injury. It is the first time he has missed any bouts in his career and it brings to an end a record run of 55 consecutive tournaments with a majority of wins. Former komusubi [[Oginishiki]] wins his second [[juryo]] division championship in a row.

===February===
* Former maegashira [[Kushimaumi]] branches out from [[Dewanoumi stable]] to open his own [[Tagonoura stable (2000)|Tagonoura stable]].
* [[Kise stable]] shuts down as its stablemaster, former maegashira [[Kiyonomori Masao|Kiyonomori]], is approaching the mandatory retirement age of 65.

===March===
*The sumo world has to deal with several allegations of [[match-fixing in professional sumo|match-fixing]] - Hawaiian former wrestler [[Takamio]] tells the ''[[Shukan Post]]'' that he helped yokozuna [[Akebono Taro|Akebono]] fix matches, ex-[[komusubi]] [[Itai Keisuke|Itai]] makes similar allegations in a series of articles, and [[Shikinohana]] says current members of the [[Sumo Association]]'s hierarchy also engaged in the practice when they were active wrestlers decades ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/14/sports/wrestlers-try-to-fight-on-amid-swirl-of-boutrigging-stories.html|title=Wrestlers Try to Fight On Amid Swirl of Bout-Rigging Stories|last=Kattoulas|first=Velisarios|date=14 March 2000|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Osaka]] tournament has a surprise winner: 32-year-old [[maegashira]] [[Takatoriki]], who was on the brink of demotion but pulls off a stunning 13–2 score. He also wins the Outstanding Performance Award, and a record tenth Fighting Spirit Prize. Musoyama finishes runner-up alongside Akebono and earns promotion to [[Ōzeki|ozeki]]. He also receives his fourth Technique Prize. Miyabiyama gets a share of the Fighting Spirit Prize. Takanohana's elder brother and fellow yokozuna [[Wakanohana Masaru|Wakanohana]] announces his retirement at the age of 29, after failing to recover from a leg injury sustained in the previous September tournament. He proved unable to add to his five career championships in his brief yokozuna career. [[Tochinohana]] wins the juryo yusho.

===April===
*27: The [[Sumo Association]] award Wakanohana a bonus of 70 million yen for his services to sumo.
*30: 4500 spectators attend a training session for all the top rikishi at the Kokugikan, which is open to the public for the first time.

===May===
[[File:Sumo May09 Kaio.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kaio Hiroyuki|Kaio]] won his first yusho and promotion to ozeki in 2000.]]
*For the third tournament in a row, a rikishi below the rank of ozeki takes the championship: this time it is [[komusubi]] [[Kaio Hiroyuki|Kaio]] with a 14–1 record. He receives his ninth Outstanding Performance Prize, and fifth Fighting Spirit Award.  Yokozuna Takanohana and Akebono finish one win behind on 13–2. Musoyama misses his debut ozeki tournament through injury. Miyabiyama joins him at the rank after posting his second consecutive 11–4 record, but the decision to promote him is (unusually) not unanimous. He also gets a share of the Shukun-sho.  He replaces veteran [[Takanonami]], who is demoted from ozeki for the second time. Tochinohana, in his top division debut, scores 12 and receives the Fighting Spirit and Technique Prizes.  A record eight [[sekitori]] miss the tournament, the most since the six tournaments per year schedule was introduced in 1958. [[Wakanosato]], recuperating from injury, wins the juryo championship. Former maegashira [[Ganyū Kenji|Ganyū]] retires.

===July===
*In [[Nagoya]], Akebono wins his first yusho since 1997, finishing one win ahead of sekiwake [[Tochiazuma Daisuke|Tochiazuma]] with a 13–2 score. Tochiazuma receives the Technique Prize. Takanohana pulls out after injuring his elbow. Musoyama can only manage four wins and is demoted from ozeki. Kaio by contrast follows up his yusho in May with a fine 11–4 record and is finally promoted to ozeki at the age of 28. He also receives a record-equalling tenth Outstanding Performance Prize. The Fighting Spirit Award is shared between newcomers [[Takamisakari]] and [[Aminishiki]], who each score ten. American [[Sentoryu]] also gets a winning score in his debut top division tournament. Wakanosato wins his second juryo yusho in a row. The [[makushita]] division championship is won by [[Asashoryu]] with a perfect 7–0 record.

===August===
*[[Tatsutagawa stable]] shuts down as its stablemaster, former sekiwake [[Aonosato Sakari|Aonosato]], is approaching the mandatory retirement age. Its wrestlers, including sekitori [[Jumonji Tomokazu|Jumonji]], [[Shikishima Katsumori|Shikishima]] and [[Toyozakura]],  move to [[Michinoku stable]].

===September===
*Having suffered from injuries and been looking below par all year,  Musashimaru dominates the Aki basho, losing only on the final day to win his eighth championship with a 14–1 score. Akebono finishes runner-up on 13–2. Takanohana sits the tournament out. Musoyama regains his ozeki rank by winning ten bouts, meaning there will be five ozeki in November. Tochinohana and [[Hayateumi]] share the Technique Prize. Wakanosato gets the Fighting Spirit Award on his return to makuuchi. [[Kotomitsuki]] wins the juryo championship. Popular top division veterans [[Kotonishiki]] and [[Mitoizumi]], now in juryo, both announce their retirements. Also retiring are former maegashira [[Kitakachidoki]] (meaning there are no longer any sekitori from [[Hokkaido]]) and [[Ohinode]].
*23: Wakanohana's retirement ceremony ([[danpatsu-shiki]]) takes place at the Kokugikan. Accompanying him in his final yokozuna [[dohyo-iri]] are his fellow grand champions Akebono and Takanohana.

===November===
*In [[Kyushu]], Akebono wins his second yusho of the year, and eleventh overall, with a fine 14–1 record. This means he has more wins this year than any other wrestler. He finishes one win ahead of newcomer Kotomitsuki, who wins all three [[sansho (sumo)|special prizes]]. Wakanosato also receives his first Outstanding Performance Prize. [[Kinkaiyama]] wins his third juryo championship. Ex maegashira [[Dewaarashi]] retires.
*18: The former Wakanohana announces he is giving up his elder position in the Sumo Association to become a TV [[tarento]].

==Deaths==
*14 Jan: Onaruto Oyakata, former maegashira [[Yoshinotani]], aged 50.

'''Bell MTS Place''' is an [[indoor arena]] in [[Downtown Winnipeg|downtown]] [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]]. The arena is the home of the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Winnipeg Jets]] and their [[American Hockey League]] affiliate, the [[Manitoba Moose]].&lt;ref name="ahlwpg"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jets.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=757779&amp;navid=DL | title=True North relocates AHL franchise to Winnipeg | publisher=[[Winnipeg Jets]] | date=March 12, 2015 | accessdate=March 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jetsahl"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://winnipeg.ctvnews.ca/winnipeggers-and-local-businesses-welcome-ahl-team-1.2277892# | title=Winnipeggers and local businesses welcome AHL team | publisher=[[CTV Winnipeg]] | date=March 12, 2015 | accessdate=March 13, 2015 | author=Roberts, Meghan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://moosehockey.com/ | title=TRUE NORTH SPORTS &amp; ENTERTAINMENT LIMITED UNVEILS MANITOBA MOOSE AS NAME OF AHL FRANCHISE &amp; ANNOUNCES DETAILS OF TICKET CAMPAIGN | publisher=[[Manitoba Moose]] | work=MooseHockey.com | date=May 4, 2015 | accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arena stands on the former [[Eaton's#The Winnipeg store|Eaton's]] site and is owned and operated by [[True North Sports &amp; Entertainment]]. The 440,000 square feet&lt;ref name="Quick Facts"/&gt; (41,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) building was constructed at a cost of $133.5 million [[Canadian dollar|CAD]]. It opened on November 16, 2004, replacing the since-demolished [[Winnipeg Arena]]. It has a capacity of 15,321 for [[ice hockey|hockey]] and 16,345 for concerts.

Originally known as the "True North Centre" during its planning and construction stages, it was named the '''MTS Centre''' as part of a [[naming rights]] agreement with [[Manitoba Telecom Services]]. It was renamed Bell MTS Place on May 30, 2017 following [[Bell Canada]]'s acquisition of MTS.&lt;ref name="cbc-belmtsplace"&gt;{{cite news|title=MTS Centre, Iceplex renamed following Bell takeover of MTS|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/mts-centre-renamed-1.4137892|website=CBC News|agency=Canadian Press|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jets home arena renamed Bell MTS Place|url=https://www.nhl.com/news/winnipeg-home-arena-renamed-bell-mts-place/c-289672910|publisher=National Hockey League|website=NHL.com|date=May 30, 2017|accessdate=February 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Development===
With the bankruptcy of the iconic [[Eaton's]] retailer, the famed store that was originally constructed in Winnipeg was emptied in late 2001.&lt;ref name="PCL"/&gt; Various alternative uses for the building (including residential condominiums) were suggested, but ultimately the arena was deemed to be the most viable and beneficial to the city's struggling downtown by Winnipeg Mayor [[Glen Murray (politician)|Glen Murray]] and True North.&lt;ref name="Uniter"&gt;{{cite news |title=The MTS Centre Has Not Revitalized Downtown|first=Nick|last=Ternette|url=http://uniter.ca/view/2607/|work=The Uniter|date=December 3, 2009|accessdate=August 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a small, but emotional resistance to losing the Western Canadian landmark Eaton's building by some locals and the Save the Eaton's Coalition, which inspired a "group hug" of the "Big Store" by a reported 180 people in 2001, the store was demolished in 2002 to make way for the new entertainment complex.

The MTS Centre officially opened on November 16, 2004, replacing the aging [[Winnipeg Arena]], which had been in operation since 1955. In an effort to recognize the store's history, red bricks were incorporated into the design of the arena façade, evoking the memory of the Eaton's store that had once graced Portage Avenue. An original store window and Tyndall stone surround is mounted in the arena concourse to house a collection of Eaton's memorabilia. In addition, two war memorials were incorporated into the building.&lt;ref name="PCL"&gt;{{cite web|title=MTS Centre (True North Centre |url=http://www.pcl.com/projects/archived/MTSCentre/index.aspx |publisher=PCL Construction |accessdate=August 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906115206/http://www.pcl.com/projects/archived/MTSCentre/index.aspx |archivedate=September 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Timothy Eaton statue]] that was once a main feature of the store is also housed in the MTS Centre, near the spot where it stood in the Eaton's building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timothy Eaton statue begins relocation to MTS Centre|url=http://www.mtscentre.ca/press_releases/031029/|publisher=Concertticketcenter.com|date=October 29, 2003|accessdate=July 22, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706185942/http://www.mtscentre.ca/press_releases/031029/|archivedate=July 6, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hockey===

====American Hockey League====
[[File:Manitobamoosegame.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A [[Manitoba Moose]] game at the MTS Centre]] The AHL's [[Manitoba Moose]] were the arena's first tenant, from its opening in 2004 to 2011.&lt;ref name="Quick Facts"/&gt; The team relocated to [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] prior to the [[2011–12 AHL season]] to make way for the arrival of the Winnipeg Jets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Thrashers Headed to Winnipeg|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=6610414|work=[[ESPN]]|date=June 1, 2011|accessdate=June 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Moose returned to the MTS Centre for the [[2015–16 AHL season|2015–16 season]], making the arena the first (together with the [[SAP Center at San Jose]]) to be home to both an NHL team and its AHL affiliate.&lt;ref name="ahlwpg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jetsahl"/&gt; Only the lower bowl, which has a capacity of 8,812, is used for the majority of Moose home games.&lt;ref name="jetsahl"/&gt;

The arena hosted the [[AHL All-Star Classic]] on February 1, 2006, in which Team Canada defeated Team PlanetUSA, 9-4.

====National Hockey League====
From 1972 to 1996, the original [[Winnipeg Jets (1972–96)|Winnipeg Jets]] played home games out of the now-demolished Winnipeg Arena. Facing mounting financial troubles, the franchise relocated to [[Arizona]] after the [[1995–96 NHL season]] and became the [[Phoenix Coyotes]].

[[File:Winnipeg Jets first home victory celebration.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Winnipeg Jets celebrate their first regulation win in Winnipeg at the MTS Centre on October 17, 2011.]]The idea of Winnipeg one day returning to the NHL gained momentum after the MTS Centre opened. [[David Thomson, 3rd Baron Thomson of Fleet|David Thomson]] and [[Mark Chipman]] were floated as potential owners of an NHL team, although many questions were raised about the MTS Centre's potential suitability as an NHL venue. The arena's capacity was well below that of the next-smallest NHL arena at that time, the [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]], which sat 16,170 but lacked modern design elements. Chipman stated that the arena's current size was sufficient for an NHL team due to the unique economics of the local market.&lt;ref name="Attendance"&gt;{{cite news |title=Coyote Question: Is Phoenix an NHL Market?|first=Nick|last=Ternette|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/news?slug=nc-coyotes110310|work=[[Yahoo Sports]]|date=November 3, 2010|accessdate=November 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 19, 2011, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' reported that Mark Chipman and True North were finalizing the purchase of the [[Atlanta Thrashers]], with the intent of moving the team to Winnipeg.&lt;ref name="Globe Thrashers"&gt;{{cite news|title=Atlanta Thrashers Moving to Winnipeg|first=Stephen|last=Brunt|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/atlanta-thrashers-moving-to-winnipeg/article2029179/|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=May 19, 2011|accessdate=May 20, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520015341/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/atlanta-thrashers-moving-to-winnipeg/article2029179/|archivedate=May 20, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sources: Thrashers Deal Not Done|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=6568200|work=[[ESPN]]|date=May 19, 2011|accessdate=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve days later, True North chairman [[Mark Chipman]], [[NHL Commissioner]] [[Gary Bettman]], and [[Premier of Manitoba]] [[Greg Selinger]] held a press conference at the MTS Centre to announce the deal, which was formally approved by the NHL Board of Governors three weeks later. As part of the transition to the NHL, the arena went through some minor renovations to bring it in line with the league's standards, including construction of additional press boxes, shuttered lighting, flexible rink glass, and an upgraded ice refrigeration system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Daly Says MTS Centre Meets Most League Standards As Is|url=https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=368402|work=[[The Sports Network|TSN]]|date=June 9, 2011|accessdate=June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further improvements were made over the next few years, including concourse improvements, installation of a new high-definition scoreboard, and the replacement of metal rails with plexiglass to eliminate obstructed views around the arena. A total of 278 premium seats were added to the upper level in 2015, slightly increasing the arena's capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MTS Centre Makeover|url=http://www.winnipegsun.com/2015/09/16/mts-centre-makeover|work=Winnipeg Sun|date=September 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the return of the Jets, the MTS Centre hosted several NHL preseason games. The first was held on September 17, 2006 between the Edmonton Oilers and the Phoenix Coyotes (the former Winnipeg Jets) in front of a sold-out crowd, which the Oilers won 5–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Jets Return to Winnipeg After 10 Years|author=The Canadian Press|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060918.wjets18/BNStory/Sports/Hockey/|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=September 16, 2006|accessdate=May 17, 2009}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NHL exhibition game became an annual event for the MTS Centre, concluding in September 2010 when the defending [[Stanley Cup Champions]] [[Chicago Blackhawks]], led by captain and Winnipeg-born [[Jonathan Toews]], played the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] in front of a crowd of 14,092.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lightning to Host Oilers at MTS Centre|first=Ken|last=Wiebe|url=http://www.winnipegsun.com/sports/hockey/2009/05/05/9359446.html|newspaper=[[Winnipeg Sun]]|date=May 5, 2009|accessdate=May 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;'

With a capacity of just over 15,300 for NHL games, Bell MTS Place is the smallest arena in the NHL.

====International====
In international hockey, the arena hosted the [[2007 IIHF Women's World Championship]], which was won by the host country. Other international matches hosted at the arena included [[2005 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|2005 World Junior Championship]] pretournament games, the fifth game of the [[2007 Super Series]] between [[Canada men's national junior ice hockey team|Canada]] and [[Russia men's national junior ice hockey team|Russia]], and the medal round of the [[2011 World U-17 Hockey Challenge]].

'''Bowlmor Lanes''' is the upscale brand of [[ten-pin bowling]] and entertainment centers operated by [[Bowlero Corporation]]. There are currently 18 Bowlmor Lanes centers, nine of which are former [[300 Bowling and Entertainment Centers|AMF 300]] centers and three are former [[AMF Bowling Center|AMF Bowling Centers]].

Bowlmor Lanes centers aim to provide "high-end" bowling in a modern lounge setting which includes audiovisual technology, such as plasma screens for automatic scoring and movie screens above the lanes, plus glow lighting, and glow-in-the-dark lanes. Bowlmor Lanes centers also have DJ booths, sports bars and video arcades, miniature golf, bocce, table shuffleboard, ping pong tables, air hockey, billiards, and boardwalk games, private party facilities with catering services, and full service restaurants.&lt;ref name="reorg"&gt;{{cite web|title=Disclosure Statement for the Second Modified Joint Plan of Reorganization of AMF Bowling Worldwide, Inc., and its Debtor Affiliates Pursuant to Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (Document 818), Case No. 12-36495, United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Richmond Division|url=http://www.kccllc.net/documents/1236495/1236495130523000000000010.pdf|accessdate=February 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowlero claims its Bowlmor Lanes brand has a 35-50% return on equity.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Bowlmor Lanes Founder and CEO Tom Shannon|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ekEgTqQkMQ#t=166|newspaper=Bloomberg Enterprise (TV)|date=October 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
[[File:Bowlmor Lanes Times Square (Manhattan, New York) 001 crop.jpg|thumb|right|Bowlmor Lanes Times Square]]

In 1938 Nick Gianos opened the original Bowlmor Lanes in [[New York City]]'s [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]]. The opening came right at the start of the Golden Age of bowling, the 1940s through the 1960s, when the invention of the automatic [[pinsetter]] propelled bowling's popularity to its highest. Bowlmor Lanes was at the forefront of the bowling revolution, hosting the prestigious Landgraf Tournament in 1942 and one of the first televised bowling tournaments, the East vs. West, broadcast on New York City radio station [[WOR (AM)|WOR]] in 1954. In 1958, Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] bowled at the center.&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nixon Bowled Here, but Owner Looks to the Future|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/04/nyregion/nixon-bowled-here-but-owner-looks-to-the-future.html|newspaper= The New York Times|date=April 5, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the 70's and 80's Bowlmor Lanes was home to the top bowlers in the sport.&lt;ref name="70's and 80's "&gt;[http://www.actionbowlers.com/great_action_houses.htm Actionbowlers.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nick Gianos's son John took over the business in 1981, and by 1997 he was feeling the pressure of rising rent and the need to modernize.&lt;ref name="NY Times"/&gt;

That year, 1992 [[Darden School of Business]] graduate Tom Shannon attended a birthday party at the now dilapidated bowling center. Shannon saw the potential in the property and purchased it for $1.4 million "to inject the tired business with hip design, upscale cuisine, and a full bar, and then market Bowlmor as a party venue."&lt;ref name="Crains"&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Entrepreneurs 2008|url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/gallery/20080501/FEATURES/501009997/5|newspaper=Crain’s New York Business|accessdate=March 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shannon then borrowed $2 million from friends, family, and Bowlmor's sellers to transform the center. Changes included installation of video screens, glow in the dark lanes and balls, and lane-side food and drink service. Shannon eliminated [[bowling league]]s, "to ease out those who did not cotton to the fancy trappings or higher prices," in favor of promotions and events aimed at attracting new fans to the sport. By 1999, Bowlmor Lanes Union Square was the highest-grossing bowling center in the United States.&lt;ref name="reorg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crains"/&gt; The center was closed in July 2014 when it lost its lease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bowlmor Lanes, city's oldest bowling alley, closes after 76-year run in Union Square|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bowlmor-lanes-closes-article-1.1857949#ixzz36sdAHWlq|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==More locations==
With the success of the Union Square location, Shannon’s company, Strike Holdings LLC, went on to replicate the Bowlmor Lanes concept in other markets. In 2001, Strike [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]] opened in suburban [[Washington, D.C.]] A year later, Strike [[Long Island]] was opened in an underground space housing 35 lanes of bowling, a full-service restaurant, and four bars. In November 2004, the 34 lane Strike [[Miami]] opened in the Dolphin Mall in the Doral section of the city, featuring a sports themed restaurant. Strike [[Cupertino]] ([[Silicon Valley]]), California opened at [[Vallco Shopping Mall]] in the summer of 2007 and Strike [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], CA opened in the summer of 2008. The properties were rebranded as Bowlmor Lanes soon after.&lt;ref name="reorg"/&gt;

In the fall of 2010, Strike Holdings opened its largest location in the former [[New York Times]] newsroom in New York City's [[Times Square]]. The {{convert|90000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Bowlmor Lanes facility features seven bowling lounges designed with New York themes, from [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Manhattan Chinatown]] (featuring a gong that is hit upon bowling a strike) to [[Art Deco]] and [[Central Park, Manhattan|Central Park]] (including items purchased from the [[Tavern on the Green]] auction) to [[Prohibition]], plus a full stage with dance floor, a sports bar with stadium-style seating, boardwalk games, and a miniature golf course.&lt;ref name="reorg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Post"&gt;{{cite news |title= Bowlmor 2.0 rolling into Times Square |newspaper=[[New York Post]] |url= http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/bowlmore_rolling_to_times_square_ZmMVEQsMyLskr4tyd1jmyN |date= February 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
Bowlmor's revenues rose from approximately $1.9 million from its single facility in the year ending December 31, 1997 (close to double the revenues for the same facility in the prior year under prior management) to approximately $37.1 million for all locations in the year ending December 31, 2012. Bowlmor locations have earned several hundred thousand dollars per lane per year making it one of the highest grossing bowling facility operators in North America.&lt;ref name="reorg"/&gt;

In 2013 the much larger [[AMF Bowling|AMF Bowling Worldwide]] was reorganized and combined with Strike Holdings LLC to form Bowlmor AMF (now known as [[Bowlero Corporation]]), with Tom Shannon as its Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President.&lt;ref name="reorg"/&gt;

==Accolades==
Shannon was named Bowling Proprietor of the Year in 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Profile: Thomas F. Shannon|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=5477918&amp;privcapId=4100559&amp;previousCapId=4100559&amp;previousTitle=Bowlmor+Holdings+LLC|newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek|accessdate=March 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Centers of Attention: Bowlmor AMF's Tom Shannon knows how to draw a crowd|newspaper=[[Bowlers Journal|Bowlers Journal International]]|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Bowlers Journal|Bowlers Journal International Magazine]] and a Top Entrepreneur of 2008 by [[Crain's New York Business]].&lt;ref name="Crains"/&gt;

==History==
Official groundbreaking ceremonies for the $23 million [[multi-purpose stadium]] took place on August 16, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=South Bend Takes Pair of Games from Chiefs|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BL&amp;p_theme=bl&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F01FD1624182550&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|newspaper=[[The Pantagraph]]|location=Bloomington–Normal|date=August 11, 2001|accessdate=August 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stadium opened on May 24, 2002 as O'Brien Field,&lt;ref name="chiefs-pr-renamed-2013"/&gt; with a game between the Chiefs and the [[Kane County Cougars]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |title=Stadium History|url=http://www.milb.com/content/page.jsp?ymd=20081202&amp;content_id=41469004&amp;sid=t443&amp;vkey=team1|publisher=Peoria Chiefs|date=December 2, 2008|accessdate=August 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Brien Auto Team held the original [[naming rights]] to the facility.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

In 2011, the stadium hosted to the [[Illinois High School Association|IHSA]] Class 1A and 2A baseball state finals. This was the first year the games were played at the facility.&lt;ref name=ihsa2011&gt;{{cite web |title=Baseball State Finals: 1A/2A Tournament Moves To Peoria, 3A/4A Extended In Joliet |url=http://www.ihsa.org/announce/2010-11/2010-10-12.htm |publisher=Illinois High School Association |accessdate=June 8, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zIGtHzjE?url=http://www.ihsa.org/announce/2010-11/2010-10-12.htm |archivedate=June 8, 2011 |date=October 12, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, the Chiefs, including the stadium, received $7.35 million in financing and debt forgiveness.  The plan included forgiveness of $1.2 million in debt to the City of Peoria; including $2 million in funding from [[Caterpillar Inc.]] for [[naming rights]] over 10 years; and $2.7 million in new investment of cash and equity by the Chiefs' ownership group of about 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Peoria City Council Approves Financial Restructuring for Chiefs|first=Nick|last=Vlahos|url=http://www.pjstar.com/news/x1213308616/City-Council-approves-financial-bailout-for-Chiefs|newspaper=[[Journal Star (Peoria)]]|date=April 30, 2013|accessdate=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 10, 2013, Caterpillar and the Chiefs announced that the stadium would be renamed "Dozer Park", a reference to Caterpillar [[bulldozer]]s.&lt;ref name="pjstar-dozer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chiefs-pr-renamed-2013"/&gt;

==The field==
Dozer Park's [[sod]] has an {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}} deep root zone of 90% sand and 10% Dakota peat for nutrition. The high concentration of sand naturally relieves soil compaction.

Beneath the sand and peat mix are {{convert|6|in|mm}} of [[gravel]]. Running through the gravel are drainage tiles that run from [[home plate]] to [[Baseball field#outfield|center field]]. A huge sump pump beyond center field then drains into the city sewer system.

The makeup of the pitcher's mound and batter's boxes are almost 100% clay because it packs better and is wear resistant.  The rest of the infield skin area is around 40% clay, 30% silt and 20% sand.

The field will hold up to {{convert|5|in|mm}} of rain an hour.

The field is mowed every day during homestands, trimmed to {{convert|1|-|1+1/4|in|mm}} high. It takes 1.25 hours to cut the outfield grass 2 directions with a {{convert|100|in|m|sing=on}} cut mower. A walk-behind mower is used for the [[infield]].

The price tag for the field itself was around $450,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Guide to O'Brien Field|first=Dave|last=Reynolds|url=http://www.pjstar.com/services/special/2002obrienfield/stories/g93817a.html|newspaper=[[Journal Star (Peoria)]]|accessdate=August 11, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020603222155/http://www.pjstar.com/services/special/2002obrienfield/stories/g93817a.html|archivedate=June 3, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Luxury suites==
Dozer Park accommodates 20 luxury suites. Examples include:
* Peoria attorney Jay Janssen’s suite &amp;mdash; "A large, ornate [[Oriental rug]] covers most of the green-carpeted suite, which includes six [[candelabra]] wall sconces, a [[chandelier]] in the center, cherry wood [[cabinetry]] and chair rail, decorative border print, a green [[marble]]-topped [[Table (furniture)|table]], a rose-colored [[granite]] [[pedestal]] bar overlooking the field and burgundy [[leather]] [[Chair|stools]] and [[chairs]].

* [[Caterpillar, Inc.]] owns a double suite that is primarily used to entertain the customers and [[VIP]] guests the company hosts in the community.&lt;ref name="suites"/&gt;

==Food==
Other than the five fixed [[Concession stand|concession]] stands there are mobile carts around the park.  The Chiefs' concessionaire is Professional Sports Catering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Who We're Working With|url=http://www.prosportscatering.com/minor_league_baseball.html|publisher=Professional Sports Catering|accessdate=August 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Estádio Urbano Caldeira''', also known as '''Estádio Vila Belmiro''', is an [[association football]] [[stadium]] located in the Vila Belmiro neighborhood of [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]], [[Brazil]], and the home of  [[Santos Futebol Clube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.santosfc.com.br/clube/default.asp?c=Sedes&amp;st=Vila%20Belmiro |title=Estádio Urbano Caldeira |publisher=[[Santos Futebol Clube]] |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |language=Portuguese |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020200357/http://www.santosfc.com.br/clube/default.asp?c=Sedes&amp;st=Vila%20Belmiro |archive-date=October 20, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ground was inaugurated on October 12, 1916 when Santos beat [[Clube Atlético Ypiranga]] 2–1, with [[Adolfo Millon Jr.]] scoring the first goal of the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portogente.com.br/texto.php?cod=2386 |title=A inauguração do nosso estádio |publisher=Porto Gente |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |language=Portuguese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910034814/http://www.portogente.com.br/texto.php?cod=2386 |archivedate=September 10, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named in honor of [[Urbano Caldeira]], former player, manager and chairman of Santos, in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tiosam.org/enciclopedia/index.asp?q=Est%C3%A1dio_Urbano_Caldeira |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130415230134/http://www.tiosam.org/enciclopedia/index.asp?q=Est%C3%A1dio_Urbano_Caldeira |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 15, 2013 |title=Estádio Urbano Caldeira |publisher=Tio Sam |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |language=Portuguese |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ground, given the nickname ''Vila Belmiro'' due to its location within the Vila Belmiro neighborhood, has been Santos' permanent residence since 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldstadiums.com/stadium_pictures/south_america/brazil/sao_paulo/santos_caldeira.shtml |title=Estádio Urbano Caldeira (Vila Belmiro) |publisher=World Stadiums |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |language=Portuguese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804063002/http://www.worldstadiums.com/stadium_pictures/south_america/brazil/sao_paulo/santos_caldeira.shtml |archivedate=August 4, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the club sometimes uses the [[Estádio do Pacaembu|Pacaembu Stadium]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacaembu.com.br/ |title=Pacaembu  |publisher=Pacaembu |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; located in the city of [[São Paulo]] for important matches due to the low capacity of Vila Belmiro.

The ground underwent several expansions and renovations in the 1990s and 2000s (decade), most notably the renewal of the irrigation and drainage systems, flood-lighting and the replacement of the field. The stadium's current highest attendance was recorded in 1964, when 32,989 spectators watched the [[Campeonato Paulista]] match between Santos and [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classicoeclassico.sites.uol.com.br/sp/corxsan_estadio.htm |title=Vila Belmiro |publisher=Clássico é Clássico |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after its foundation, Santos held their training in a field located in the neighborhood of Macuco.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santosfc.com.br/historia/default.asp?c=Hist%F3ria&amp;st=A%20Trajet%F3ria |title=A Trajetória |publisher=[[Santos Futebol Clube]] |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |language=Portuguese |df=mdy }}{{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the field did not meet the minimum size standards to host official matches, Santos played on the "Igreja Coração de Maria" pitch in Ana Costa Avenue.&lt;ref name="foundation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.santosfc.com.br/noticias/colunas/conteudo.asp?id=70617 |title=Vila Belmiro- 92 anos de fundação |publisher=[[Santos Futebol Clube]] |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |language=Portuguese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121231170905/http://www.santosfc.com.br/noticias/colunas/conteudo.asp?id=70617 |archivedate=December 31, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The field, however, was also used by other clubs in town.

On May 31, 1916, a general assembly approved the purchase of an area of 16,500 square meters, in the neighborhood of Vila Belmiro, approved by [[List of Santos FC presidents|club president]] Agnello Cícero de Oliveira and vice-president Dr. Álvaro Ribeiro.&lt;ref name="foundation" /&gt; The land acquired belonged to ''Companhia de Habitações Econômicas'', and the field was bought from them at a price of [[Brazilian real (old)|Rs$]]66,660,000.&lt;ref name="foundation" /&gt; The board members obtained a 10-year loan which was liquified in 1923 after paying Rs$35,000,000 in interest fees.&lt;ref name="foundation" /&gt; 
[[File:Inauguracao.png|thumb|right|225px|Estádio Urbano Caldeira during its inauguration]]
The club, however, did not obtain a nearby area belonging to ''Beneficência Portuguesa'', since the club's finances did not favor this.&lt;ref name="foundation" /&gt; It would not be acquired until 1989.&lt;ref name="foundation" /&gt; The original date for the inauguration of the field was August 20;&lt;ref name="foundation" /&gt; it was postponed until further notice due to the death of Dr. Álvaro Ribeiro.&lt;ref name="foundation" /&gt; On October 12 of that year, the inauguration of the ''Vila Belmiro'' sports park was celebrated with several ceremonies among the members, including a march by musical corporation ''Humanitária'', to see off playing on Macuco field.&lt;ref name="foundation" /&gt; The first game was held 10 days later at 13:30 ([[UTC-3]]),&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.santosfc.com.br/noticias/colunas/conteudo.asp?id=70649 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326072307/http://www.santosfc.com.br/noticias/colunas/conteudo.asp?id=70649 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 26, 2012 |title=O primeiro jogo do nosso estádio |publisher=[[Santos Futebol Clube]] |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |language=Portuguese }}&lt;/ref&gt; against [[Clube Atlético Ypiranga|Ypiranga]] for the [[1916 Campeonato Paulista]], the competition's 491st match, which Santos won 2–1.&lt;ref name="foundation" /&gt; Ticket prices were set at Rs$2 for bleacher and Rs$1 for the general public.&lt;ref name="time" /&gt; [[Adolfo Millon Jr.]] scored the first ever goal on that stadium with Jarbas scoring the second, while Bororó scored for the visiting team.

The first major renovation occurred in 1931.&lt;ref name="early"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://canelada.com.br/caneladas-historicas/historia-dos-estadios-brasileiros-vila-belmiro/ |title=História dos Estádios Brasileiros – Vila Belmiro |publisher=Tiago Buckowsky Xavier |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |language=Portuguese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331074702/http://canelada.com.br/caneladas-historicas/historia-dos-estadios-brasileiros-vila-belmiro/ |archivedate=March 31, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 21, of that year, the stadium renovated its stands and an illumination system was installed.&lt;ref name="early" /&gt; Twenty hours later, the club's first late match was played against a combined team from the city of Santos, with the club losing to its city counterpart 0–1. Manoel Cruz, a midfielder from [[Associação Atlética Portuguesa Santista|Portuguesa Santista]], scored the only goal of the match.&lt;ref name="early" /&gt;

After Urbano Caldeira died on March 12, 1933, Ricardo Pinto de Oliveira, one of the club board members at that time, wanted to pay homage to Caldeira by naming the stadium after him. After a meeting which included all club members, the naming of the stadium was given a positive vote.&lt;ref name="name"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.santosfc.com.br/noticias/conteudo.asp?id=21959#.Tlg05l1m2-A |title=Há 77 anos, Vila ganhava o nome de Estádio Urbano Caldeira |publisher=Santos Futebol Clube |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |language=Portuguese |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326072245/http://www.santosfc.com.br/noticias/conteudo.asp?id=21959#.Tlg05l1m2-A |archive-date=March 26, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-two years later, the first concrete stand was built where the current electrical score–keeping screen is located at.&lt;ref name="early" /&gt; Called ''A Vila Mais Famosa do Mundo'' (The  World's Most Famous Village), the Estádio Urbano Caldeira also came to be called after the era of ''[[Os Santásticos]]'' (1956–1973) the "Alçapão da Vila (The Village Trap) because opposing team often left the ground defeated.&lt;ref name="early" /&gt; Due to the proximity of the stands with the field where the matches unfolds, the pressure that the fans have on opposing teams was said to be incredible.&lt;ref name="early" /&gt; After the golden age, the Vila Belmiro became synonymous with ''[[The Beautiful Game|Joga Bonito]]''.&lt;ref name="early" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CO 2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cunha |first=Odir |title=Time dos Sonhos |trans-title=Dream Teams |year=2003 |ISBN=85-7594-020-1 |language=Portuguese }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vila1950.png|thumb|right|225px|The first concrete stand was built in 1955.]]
In that stadium of modest dimensions, stars of past and present such Pelé, Coutinho, Pepe, Giovanni, Pitta, Robinho, Diego, Neymar and Paulo Henrique Ganso became figures for the national team.&lt;ref name="early" /&gt; For many years Vila Belmiro was the place where [[Pelé]] demonstrated his skills.&lt;ref name="early" /&gt; On November 21, 1964, at Vila Belmiro, Pelé scored eight goals against [[Botafogo Futebol Clube (SP)|Botafogo (SP)]], when Santos beat the opposing squad 11–0. On October 2, 1974, Pelé played his farewell game at the stadium.&lt;ref name="early" /&gt; In that match, Santos beat [[Associação Atlética Ponte Preta|Ponte Preta]] 2–0.&lt;ref name="early" /&gt;

The stadium's attendance record currently stands at 32,989, set on September 20, 1964 when Santos and [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]] drew 0–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meutimao.com.br/estadios-em-que-o-corinthians-jogou/vila_belmiro/ |title=Urbano Caldeira |publisher=Meu Timão |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the record was overshadowed by a tragic event, as part of the stadium bleachers collapsed, resulting in injury to 181 spectators.&lt;ref name="early" /&gt; The match was abandoned and rescheduled 10 days later, in the [[Estádio do Pacaembu|Pacaembu]].&lt;ref name="early" /&gt;

===Development===
During the [[1996 Campeonato Paulista]], the stadium was closed because the field was in a poor condition. During this time Santos FC played in many stadiums, including the [[Estádio Bruno José Daniel]] in [[Santo André]] and the [[Estádio do Pacaembu|Pacaembu Stadium]] in [[São Paulo]].&lt;ref name="foundation" /&gt; After that, the stadium was modified to adopt a system of drainage and irrigation systems controlled by computer. On July 20, 1997, Santos inaugurated the new stadium bleachers, located behind the goal net where, today, the visiting fans are located at.&lt;ref name="fans"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.santosfc.com.br/noticias/conteudo.asp?id=22538#.Tlg3JF1m2-A |title=Há 13 anos, Vila Belmiro ganhava novas arquibancadas |publisher=[[Santos Futebol Clube]] |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |language=Portuguese |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326072315/http://www.santosfc.com.br/noticias/conteudo.asp?id=22538#.Tlg3JF1m2-A |archive-date=March 26, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 27, 1998, during a game between Santos FC and Delia Tavano, a new illumination system was used, with level of 1,200 [[lux]], more than the [[FIFA]] minimum recommendation.&lt;ref name="foundation" /&gt; 
[[File:Estádio Urbano Caldeira-2003-01-18.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Estádio Urbano Caldeira hosted a charity match in 2003.]]
On November 17, 2003, Santos FC opened the ''Memorial das Conquistas'', a place inside the stadium as the club memorial, containing trophies, medals, documents, shirts, posters, movies and many other items that recount the club's history.&lt;ref name="foundation" /&gt; Visitors can also enter the team clock room, press room and the pitch, and, at the end of a tour, can buy club products in a club store inside the stadium.&lt;ref name="foundation" /&gt; In 2009, the new electronic scoreboard was purchased, twice the size of the previous panel, and provides the score of the game, shows materials, promotions and news of Santos.&lt;ref name="foundation" /&gt;  In addition, the stadium has acquired new seats.&lt;ref name="foundation" /&gt; More than five thousand seats were installed to better serve members of the club. The seats have been approved by FIFA and were imported from Europe.&lt;ref name="foundation" /&gt;

The Vila Belmiro was one of the venues of the [[1949 South American Championship|1949 Copa América]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tables/49safull.html |title=Southamerican Championship 1949 |publisher=[[RSSSF]] |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327093532/http://www.rsssf.com/tables/49safull.html |archivedate=March 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; hosted the [[1962 Copa Libertadores]] final and the [[1998 Copa CONMEBOL]] final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsssf.com/sacups/copa62.html |title=Copa Libertadores de América 1962 |publisher=[[RSSSF]] |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/sacups/conmebol98.html |title=Copa Conmebol 1998 |publisher=[[RSSSF]] |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112145241/http://www.rsssf.com/sacups/conmebol98.html |archivedate=January 12, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also hosted a [[Copa do Brasil]] final in [[2010 Copa do Brasil|2010]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssfbrasil.com/tablesae/cbr2010.htm |title=Brazil 2010 Cup |publisher=[[RSSSF]] |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its relative-low capacity, Santos has used other stadiums for high-profile matches such as the [[Estádio Palestra Itália]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsssf.com/sacups/supcopa68.html |title=Recopa Sudamericana 1968 |publisher=[[RSSSF]] |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsssf.com/sacups/supcopa69.html |title=Recopa Sudamericana 1969 |publisher=[[RSSSF]] |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Estádio do Pacaembu|Pacaembu]] and [[Estádio do Morumbi|Morumbi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.santosfc.com.br/noticias/colunas/conteudo.asp?id=70611 |title=O Santos FC e o Pacaembu |publisher=[[Santos Futebol Clube]] |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |language=Portuguese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909221306/http://www.santosfc.com.br/noticias/colunas/conteudo.asp?id=70611 |archivedate=September 9, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsssf.com/sacups/copa2011.html |title=Copa Libertadores de América 2011 |publisher=[[RSSSF]] |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsssf.com/sacups/copa03.html |title=Copa Libertadores de América 2003 |publisher=[[RSSSF]] |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; all located in [[São Paulo]], and the [[Maracanã (stadium)|Maracanã]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsssf.com/sacups/copa63.html |title=Copa Libertadores de América 1963 |publisher=[[RSSSF]] |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current Santos President Luís Álvaro Ribeiro and other club directors are agreeing on building a stadium in a city nearby Santos called [[Cubatão]], a stadium for 40,000 people which would become Santos' home field for almost 70% of the games during the season which would increase the team's profit.

'''Joe W. Davis Stadium''' is a [[minor league baseball]] [[baseball park|park]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], [[United States]], which hosted the [[Huntsville Stars]] of the [[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]] from 1985 until 2014, and then served as a temporary home for the Stars' successor (the [[Biloxi Shuckers]]) in 2015.

Built in 1985, the stadium is located on the grounds of Huntsville's former airport, adjacent to Huntsville's main north–south thoroughfare, [[U.S. Highway 231]] (S. Memorial Parkway).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Freeman |first=Paul |title=Huntsville Airport (2nd location), Huntsville, AL |url=http://www.airfields-freeman.com/AL/Huntsville_AL_98.jpg |work=Abandoned and Little-Known Airfields |accessdate=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium is a multi-purpose facility that seats 10,488 with 15 air-conditioned [[Luxury box|skyboxes]]. Ticket offices and the general office are located on the second floor of the stadium. Closed circuit television above the main concourse allows for viewing of the game while grabbing a bite at the concession stands. In addition to baseball, Joe W. Davis Stadium has been used for high school [[American football|football]], [[monster truck]] rallies, and [[concert]]s.

Nicknamed "The Crown Jewel of the Southern League" upon its construction, the stadium was the oldest venue in the league during its final year of operation.

==History==
The stadium is named for the longtime mayor of Huntsville, [[Joe W. Davis]], who was instrumental in the city's efforts to construct the stadium. Construction came about in 1984 after [[Nashville Sounds]] owner Larry Schmittou purchased the [[Evansville Triplets]] with the intent of moving the team in 1985 to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to effectively elevate his [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] Sounds to the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] level. As a result of this move, the existing Double-A franchise needed a new home. Schmittou considered a swap, which would have sent the Double-A team to [[Evansville, Indiana]] to replace the Triplets. Evansville city leaders balked at the requested stadium upgrades, leading Schmittou to seek alternate arrangements, which resulted in the franchise's move to Huntsville. The team became known as the Huntsville Stars, and Schmittou continued to own the franchise until selling it to a local ownership group in 1994.

The first game was held on April 19, 1985. The Stars defeated the [[Birmingham Barons]] 10-0 in a game that included a [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] from future major-leaguer [[Jose Canseco]].&lt;ref name=stadiumcloses&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al.com/news/huntsville/index.ssf/2015/05/biloxis_u-turn_on_shuckers_sta.html#incart_river?hootPostID=f719c0a5571292ee2e9274b984df64e5|title=Biloxi's U-turn on Shuckers' starting date pronounces end to Huntsville's pro baseball era|first=Mark|last=McCarter|date=May 29, 2015|accessdate=May 30, 2015|website=AL.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-2000s, renovations began on the stadium, including the replacement of all the stadium's box seats. In 2004, Joe Davis Stadium's current scoreboard, a 36-by-48-foot scoreboard complete with [[LED]] numbering and a 12-by-18-foot videoboard, was installed.

In 2014, the Stars were sold to an ownership group with the intent of relocating the franchise to [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], [[Mississippi]] at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Spencer |last=Fordin |publisher=[[MLB.com]] |title=Brewers renew contracts with Biloxi, Brevard County |url=http://m.brewers.mlb.com/news/article/95117906/brewers-renew-contracts-with-affiliates-double-a-biloxi-class-a-brevard-county |date=September 17, 2014 |accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale followed years of failed attempts to secure a new ballpark for the team in Huntsville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ballparkdigest.com/201401116946/minor-league-baseball/news/its-official-huntsville-to-biloxi-in-2015 |publisher=Ballpark Digest |title=It's Official: Huntsville Stars Sold, Expected to Move to Biloxi in 2015 |date=January 11, 2014 |accessdate=January 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to construction delays preventing the [[MGM Park|new Biloxi stadium]] from being completed in time for the Southern League's 2015 opening day, and because the franchise was still operating under a lease to use Joe Davis Stadium, the newly-christened [[Biloxi Shuckers]] played 15 of its first 25 scheduled home games in Huntsville.&lt;ref name=stadiumcloses /&gt; (The remaining ten home games were played with Biloxi acting as the home team on its opponents' home fields.)

The final game at Joe Davis Stadium was played on May 25, 2015 – a 7-2 rain-shortened win for the Shuckers over the Barons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2015_05_25_biraax_blxaax_1&amp;mode=gameday|title=Birmingham vs. Biloxi–May 25, 2015|website=MiLB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Huntsville city government, which has owned the stadium since its construction, planned to demolish it sometime in 2015.&lt;ref name=stadiumcloses /&gt; As of May 2018, the stadium was still standing as the city continued to consider its fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Spedden |first1=Zach |title=Joe Davis Stadium’s Future Uncertain |url=https://ballparkdigest.com/2018/05/22/joe-davis-stadiums-future-uncertain/ |accessdate=September 7, 2018 |work=Ballpark Digest |publisher=August Publications |date=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[chess]], a '''king walk''', also known as a '''king march''', '''steel king''' ({{lang-nl|'''wandelkoning'''}}, literally "wanderking") or '''fighting king''', refers to occasions where the [[king (chess)|king]] travels up the [[chessboard|board]], often involved in a {{chessgloss|mating attack}} against the opposing king.&lt;ref name="tkbook"&gt;{{citation |last = Krabbé |first = Tim |authorlink = Tim Krabbé |title = Chess Curiosities |publisher = [[George Allen &amp; Unwin]] |year = 1985 |location = London |isbn = 0-04-794021-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a highly unusual occurrence since the safety of the king is considered paramount, and players are recommended to keep the king out of harm's way, at least until the [[Chess endgame|endgame]].&lt;ref name="nyt_86"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE0DD1430F934A3575AC0A960948260 "Chess; Theory aside, the king safety is foremost"], [[Robert Byrne (chess player)|Robert Byrne]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 7, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uschess"&gt;[http://www.uschess.org/beginners/ten/ "Ten Tips to Winning Chess – 7. Keep your king safe"], [[Arthur Bisguier]], [[United States Chess Federation]] website&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Wilhelm Steinitz]], often known as the father of modern chess, was renowned for his [[Maxim (saying)|maxim]] that "the king is a fighting piece".&lt;ref name="silman"&gt;[http://www.jeremysilman.com/chess_history/grt_plyr_w_steinitz.html "Wilhelm Steinitz (1836–1900)"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619024745/http://www.jeremysilman.com/chess_history/grt_plyr_w_steinitz.html |date=2008-06-19 }}, [[Jeremy Silman]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt_82"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E3D7143BF934A15755C0A964948260 "Chess; Girding the king"], Robert Byrne, ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 27, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch chess [[historian]] and [[author]] [[Tim Krabbé]] has documented over one hundred such games.&lt;ref name="tkbook"/&gt;

Because of the rarity of such [[chess tactics|tactics]], those which reap rewards for the attacking player often have {{chessgloss|brilliancy prize|brilliancy prizes}} bestowed upon them.&lt;ref name="tkcc218"&gt;[http://www.xs4all.nl/~timkr/chess2/diary_11.htm "Steel king from Utrecht"], Open Chess Diary, July 11, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tkcc342"&gt;[http://www.xs4all.nl/~timkr/chess2/diary_18.htm "Steel King goes all the way"], Open Chess Diary, July 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most famous in recent history,&lt;ref name="chessbase"&gt;[http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3017 "The outrageous king walk"], Dennis Monokroussos, [[ChessBase]], April 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Nigel Short]] defeated [[Jan Timman]] in [[Tilburg]] in 1991, was voted as one of the hundred greatest chess games in a list compiled by [[FIDE Master|FM]] [[Graham Burgess]], and [[Grandmaster (chess)|GM]]s  [[John Nunn]] and [[John Emms (chess player)|John Emms]].&lt;ref name="top100book"&gt;{{Citation |last = Burgess |first = Graham |last2 = Nunn |first2 = John |author2-link = John Nunn |last3 = Emms |first3 = John |author3-link = John Emms (chess player) |title = The Mammoth Book of the World's Greatest Chess Games |publisher = Carroll &amp; Graf |date = October 1998 |url = http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chesscollection?cid=1000082 |isbn = 978-0-7867-0587-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A {{chessgloss|king walk}} can also refer to occasions where the king travels across the board (from {{chessgloss|kingside}} to {{chessgloss|queenside}}, or vice versa) to reach a safer position.

* [http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1012123 Alekhine vs. Yates, London 1922, Queen's Gambit Declined: Orthodox Defense. Main Line (D64) 1–0] Alekhine conjures up an attack in the endgame, and his king joins the fray.

'''Marcerra United Football Club''' is a semi-professional football club based in [[Kuala Lumpur]]. The club last competed in the [[Malaysia FAM League]], the third tier of the Malaysian football league, in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inikanbola.my/2018/01/15/sejauh-mana-pasukan-baru-akan-bertahan/|title=Sejauh manakah pasukan baru akan bertahan|publisher=Inikanbola.my|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team also competes in the [[Kuala Lumpur League]], a state league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sinarharian.com.my/sukan/marcerra-united-alami-kekalahan-pertama-1.780354|title=Marcerra United alami kekalahan pertama|publisher=SinarHarian.com.my|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the management of Marcerra United also has taken over the management of [[Malaysia Premier League]] club [[Kuantan FA]], and renamimg the club to Marcerra Kuantan FA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sports247.my/v1/2018/02/marcerra-kuantan-fa-akhirnya-buka-mulut|title=Marcerra Kuantan FA akhirnya buka mulut|publisher=Sports247.my|accessdate= 8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rice Stadium''' is an [[American football]] [[stadium]] located on the [[Rice University]] campus in [[Houston]], [[Texas]]. It has been the home of the [[Rice Owls football|Rice Owls football team]] since its completion in 1950 and hosted [[Super Bowl]] [[Super Bowl VIII|VIII]] in 1974.

Architecturally, Rice Stadium is an example of [[modern architecture]], with simple lines and an unadorned, functional design. The lower seating bowl is located below the surrounding ground level. Built solely for football, the stadium has excellent sightlines from almost every seat. To achieve this, the running track was eliminated so that spectators were closer to the action and each side of the upper decks was brought in at a concave angle to provide better sightlines. It is still recognized in many circles as the best stadium in Texas for watching a football game. Entrances and aisles were strategically placed so that the entire stadium could be emptied of spectators in nine minutes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/print-edition/2012/06/22/rice-stadium-a-remarkable-gridiron.html?page=all&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Rice University upgraded the facility by switching from [[AstroTurf]] to [[FieldTurf]] and adding a modern scoreboard above the north concourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://riceowls.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/rice-stadium-renovations.html|title=Rice Stadium Renovations|publisher=Rice University Athletics|accessdate=February 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seating in the upper deck is in poor condition, which led the university to move home games for which large crowds were expected to nearby [[NRG Stadium]].

High school football games, especially neutral-site playoff games, are frequently played at Rice Stadium. It can also be used as a concert venue.

==History==
Rice Stadium replaced [[Rice Field]] (now [[Rice Track/Soccer Stadium]]), which had a total capacity of less than 37,000, in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Old Rice Field|url=http://www.ricefootball.net/ricefield.htm|accessdate=December 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new stadium was subsidized by the City of Houston, and it was designed by Hermon Lloyd &amp; W.B. Morgan and Milton McGinty and built by [[KBR (company)#Brown .26 Root|Brown and Root]]. In addition to Rice, the [[University of Houston]] [[Houston Cougars football|football team]] played at Rice Stadium from 1951 to 1965, and the [[Bluebonnet Bowl]] was played there from 1959 to 1967 and again in 1985 and 1986. The [[History of the Houston Oilers|Houston Oilers]] also played in the stadium from 1965 to 1967. In 1974, Rice Stadium hosted [[Super Bowl VIII]], in which the [[Miami Dolphins]] beat the [[Minnesota Vikings]] 24&amp;ndash;7. It was the first Super Bowl played in Houston, and it would be 30 years later that the Super Bowl would return to Houston, which was played at Reliant Stadium.

On July 2, 1988, Rice Stadium hosted a stop on the Monsters of Rock tour. The tour was headlined by [[Van Halen]] and also featured [[Metallica]], [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[Dokken]], and [[Kingdom Come (band)|Kingdom Come]]. This was also the Texas World Music Festival.

===Kennedy speech===
[[File:JFK at Rice University.jpg|thumb|President Kennedy speaks at Rice Stadium on the American space program in 1962]]
{{Main|We choose to go to the Moon}}
On September 12, 1962, Rice Stadium hosted the speech in which President [[John F. Kennedy]] challenged Americans to meet his goal, set the previous year, to send a man to the moon by the end of the decade. In the speech, he used a reference to Rice University football to help frame his rhetoric:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"But why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask, why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35&amp;nbsp;years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does [[Rice–Texas football rivalry|Rice play Texas]]? We choose to go to the moon! We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kennedy's comments implied Rice had a history of losing to Texas; however, the two football teams had split 5&amp;ndash;5 in their previous 10 meetings and would tie the following month. On the other hand, Kennedy's comments about Rice-Texas might have been as forward-looking as his statements about going to the moon (which did occur in [[Apollo 11|1969]]): Since 1963, Rice has gone just 2-42 against Texas, including 28 straight losses between 1966 and 1993 and 12 straight from 1995 to the present.

===Capacity reduction===
{{update|date=February 2014}}
As originally built, Rice Stadium seated 70,000, the second-largest stadium in the [[Southwest Conference]] (behind the [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|Cotton Bowl]]). Rice Stadium was built before professional football came to Houston, and 70,000 fans might be expected to attend a college football game there. However, Rice found it increasingly difficult from the 1960s onward to compete against larger schools. In 2006, the end zones seats were covered with tarps, reducing [[seating capacity]] to 47,000. However, in the event of larger-than-expected crowds, it can easily be expanded to its full capacity, which is larger than the total number of Rice's living alumni. The average attendance for Rice football games in Rice Stadium was 13,353 in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NCAA Accumulated Attendance Report 2007|url=http://web1.ncaa.org/d1mfb/2007/Internet/attendance/IA_ATTENDANCE.pdf|accessdate=August 6, 2008|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[2008 Rice Owls football team|2008 season]], average home attendance was 20,179.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NCAA Accumulated Attendance Report 2008|url=http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/football_records/Attendance/2008.pdf|accessdate=October 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[2009 Rice Owls football team|2009 season]], average home attendance dipped once again to 13,552 per game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NCAA Accumulated Attendance Report 2009|url=http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/football_records/Attendance/2009.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for the 2012 season it was 20,325.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/football_records/2013/Attendance.pdf |title=NCAA Accumulated Attendance Report 2012 |publisher=NCAA |accessdate=February 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brian Patterson Sports Performance Center ===
[[File:BPSPC.jpg|alt=By late October, 2015, a steel skeleton had been erected for the Brian Patterson Sports Performance Center.|thumb|The Brian Patterson Sports Performance Center under construction on Oct. 23, 2015, as seen from the press box.]]
Around July 2015, construction began on the Brian Patterson Sports Performance Center. This building will make up the north end of the stadium, and contain a weight room, a home team locker room, coaching and staff offices. This will replace the north end seating, and lower possible capacity considerably. However, the seating removed consisted of crude concrete steps, and were rarely used. The building was named for donor and former Rice University football player and alumnus Brian Patterson.

'''Roller hockey''' is a form of [[hockey]] played on a dry surface using wheeled skates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/04/nyregion/tribute-for-a-roller-hockey-warrior-who-broke-the-color-barrier.html|title=Tribute for a Roller Hockey Warrior Who Broke the Color Barrier|date=4 May 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most professional inline hockey games take place on an indoor or outdoor sport court (a type of plastic interlinking tiles used to create a skating surface).  Otherwise, any dry surface can be used to host a game, typically a roller rink, macadam, or cement.  The term "Roller hockey" is often used interchangeably to refer to three variant forms chiefly differentiated by the equipment used. There is traditional "[[Roller hockey (Quad)|Roller hockey]]" (Quad hockey, Rink hockey), played with [[quad skates]] and a ball (without contact), "[[Inline hockey]]", played with [[inline skates]] and [[Hockey puck|puck]] (without contact) and "[[International Inline-Skater hockey Federation|Skater hockey]]", played with quad skates or inline skates and plastic ball (with contact like ice hockey). Combined, roller hockey is played in nearly 60 countries worldwide. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/27/sports/hockey/27roller.html|title=In-Line Hockey: Still Rolling, but Not on a Roll|date=27 February 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1991/0429/29101.html|title='Bladers' Skate Their Way Into Hot Sports Trend|first=Kirsten A.|last=Conover|date=29 April 1991|publisher=|accessdate=9 December 2016|via=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variants ==
Roller hockey is played on both [[quad skates]] and [[inline skates]], have different rules and equipment, and involve different types of skating but share the category and name of roller hockey. Roller hockey (quad) is played using traditional quad roller skates, affording greater maneuverability to the player - this results in games filled with fancy footwork, tight maneuvering, and is more similar to football or basketball. The stick is more or less the same as in [[bandy]] and [[shinty]]. Roller hockey (inline) bears close resemblance to ice hockey and is played on inline skates, uses an ice hockey stick and includes a lot of fast "racing back and forth" action. Inline hockey goalies use a glove called a catcher to catch shots made on goal, and a flat, usually square, mitt called a blocker which is used to deflect shots on goal. The Quad hockey goalie uses a flat batting glove that provides rebound characteristics when blocking a shot on goal.

=== Quad hockey===
{{main|Roller hockey (Quad)}} 
[[Image:Argentin player during 2007 rink hockey world championship.jpg|thumb|right|Roller Hockey - Hóquei em Patins - Hoquei sobre Patins - Hóckey a Patíns - Hockey sobre Patines - Hockey Su Pista]]

Quad hockey is a variation of roller hockey. Roller hockey is the overarching name for a rollersport that has existed long before inline skates were "re-invented" in the 70s (They were actually invented before quads, in the 1760s). Roller hockey has been played on [[quad skates]], in sixty countries worldwide and so has many names worldwide. Sometimes the sport is called '''Quad Hockey, [[:pt:Hóquei em Patins|Hóquei em Patins]] (PT), [[:nl:Rolhockey|Rolhockey]] (NL), [[:de:Rollhockey|Rollhockey]] (DE), International Style Ball hockey, [[:fr:Rink Hockey|Rink hockey]] (FR), [[:it:Hockey Su Pista|Hockey Su Pista]] (IT), [[:ca:Hoquei sobre patins|Hoquei sobre Patins]] (CA), [[:es:Hockey sobre Patines|Hockey sobre Patines]] (ES), [[:da:Rulleskøjtehockey|Rulleskøjtehockey]] (DA), [[:sv:Rullbandy|Rullbandy]] (S), [[:et:Rulluisuhoki|Rulluisuhoki]] (ET) and [[Hardball hockey]] (US)''', depending on which region of the world it is played. [[Roller hockey at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Roller hockey]] was a demonstration rollersport in the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]].

=== Inline hockey ===
{{main|Inline hockey}}
[[Image:Inline Hockey at Albuquerque 6.jpg|thumb|right|Inline Hockey is played on inline skates]]

[[Inline hockey]] is a variation of roller hockey very similar to [[ice hockey]], from which it is derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pDuy1GQfKeEC&amp;pg=PT30&amp;dq=roller%20hockey&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjU5bvBj-3QAhWrI8AKHQxECFoQ6AEIWjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=roller%20hockey&amp;f=false|title=Inline Skating in Contemporary Sport: An Examination of Its Growth and Development|first=Robert E.|last=Rinehart|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Paul Cowan|accessdate=11 December 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is referred to by many names worldwide, including '''Ball Hockey, [[Inline hockey]], Roller hockey, Longstick hockey, Deck hockey, [[Road hockey]], [[Street hockey]] and [[Skater hockey]]''' depending on which region of the world in which it is played.

Like ice hockey, inline hockey is a ''contact sport'' therefore body checking isn't penalized. It is similar to ice hockey in that teamwork, skill and aggressiveness are needed. Excepting the use of inline roller skates in lieu of ice skates, the equipment of inline roller hockey is similar to that of ice hockey.

The game is played by two teams, consisting of four skaters and one goalie, on a dry rink divided into two halves by a center line, with one net at each end of the rink. When played more informally, the game often takes place on a smooth asphalt surface outdoors. The game is played in three 15-minute periods or if it is higher standard it's played 20-minutes in each of the three periods. The game rules differ from ice hockey in a few simple ways: there is no icing and it is played in a 4 on 4 player format instead of 5 on 5.

Generally speaking, only competitive-level inline hockey is strictly bound by the governing body's rules. Recreational hockey leagues may make modifications to certain aspects of the rules to suit local requirements (size of rink, length of periods and penalties). Roller hockey is a growing sport in Britain with teams cropping up all over the country{{citation needed|reason=need to make the distinction between game type and format along with source for further investigation|date=September 2015}}. The fact that it can be played on any dry surface means that it can be played in almost any leisure center.

==Tournaments==
Most competitive youth hockey teams play in tournaments. The tournaments vary depending on location, but a typical bracket system is usually used. Teams travel to different locations around their state, sometimes even going out of state. There are inner state tournaments and out of state tournaments. There are even national tournaments competitive teams compete for.

The World Skate is the international association that organize the biggest roller hockey world championship (which is a part of the World Roller Games). Over twenty national teams participate in these two events.

There are other tournaments located in the U.S but played by players all around the world. Narch and Statewars are two Nationwide tournaments of every skill level and age group. 

In [[skater hockey]], the sport is governed in Europe by the [[International Inline-Skater hockey Federation]].

==Roller hockey brands==
Many of the same brands that make ice hockey equipment also make roller hockey skates including Bauer, Easton, Mission, Tron and many more. There are also some brands that specialize in roller hockey like el Leon de Oro (Spain), Tour, Alkali, Revision and Mission (but they make some ice hockey equipment also). Other rink hockey brands include Reno, TVD, Meneghini, Proskate and Azemad.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4713">[[File:Hurling sliotar.jpg|alt=Image of a Irish hurling sliotar|thumb|Irish GAA sliotar]]
A '''sliotar''' or '''sliothar''' ({{IPA-ga|ʃlʲɪt̪ˠəɾˠ}}) is a hard solid sphere slightly larger than a tennis ball, consisting of a [[cork material|cork]] core covered by two pieces of [[leather]] stitched together. Sometimes called a "dust" or "hurling ball", it resembles a [[baseball (object)|baseball]] with more pronounced stitching. It is used in the [[Gaelic games]] of [[hurling]], [[camogie]], and [[rounders]].

==Dimensions==
An official [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) sliotar, as used in top level hurling competitions such as the [[National Hurling League]] or the [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]]s is subject to strict regulations as regards its size, mass and composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaa.ie/content/documents/publications/official_guides/Official_Guide_2010_Part2.pdf|title=Gaelic Athletic Association Official Guide - Part 2|page=14|publisher=[[Gaelic Athletic Association]]|date=2009-06-03|accessdate=2012-02-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306040248/http://www.gaa.ie/content/documents/publications/official_guides/Official_Guide_2010_Part2.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following regulations apply:
* The diameter is between {{convert|69|and|72|mm|in|abbr=on}} not including the rib{{dubious|date=November 2014}}
* The mass is between {{convert|110|and|120|g|oz|abbr=on}}
* The rib height is between 2&amp;nbsp;mm and 2.8&amp;nbsp;mm, and width between 3.6&amp;nbsp;mm and 5.4&amp;nbsp;mm
* The leather cover can be between 1.8&amp;nbsp;mm and 2.7&amp;nbsp;mm and is laminated with a coating of no more than 0.15&amp;nbsp;mm

Approved sliotars carry a GAA mark of approval. The GAA maintains a list of approved suppliers, based on manufacturers who pass their inspection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gaa.ie/tickets-and-merchandise/approved-suppliers//|title=GAA Approved Suppliers|publisher=[[Gaelic Athletic Association]]|accessdate=2012-02-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125102141/http://gaa.ie/tickets-and-merchandise/approved-suppliers/|archivedate=2012-01-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Early (pre-GAA) sliotars used various materials, depending on the part of the country, including combinations of wood, leather, rope and animal hair and even hollow bronze.&lt;ref name="an fear rua"/&gt;

In the early years of the GAA, there was no specific standard for the size or weight of sliotars. The man credited with initial standardisation of the sliotar is [[Ned Treston]] (1862–1949) of [[Gort]], [[County Galway]]. He was selected to play in a match between South Galway and North Tipperary in February 1886 in Dublin. Prior the game, there was debate between the teams as regards the size of the sliotar. Treston made a sliotar at a nearby saddler, which was used in the game, and went on to be a prototype for the standard sliotar used from then on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gortgaa.com/Archive/images/Ned-Treston-bio.jpg|title=Edward (Ned) Treston 1862 - 1949|accessdate=2009-09-16|publisher=Gort GAA}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnny McAuliffe (born 1896, [[Bruff]], [[County Limerick]]; died 1960, in Limerick) is credited with the modern design. Before his improvements the ball tended to be inconsistent due to poor manufacturing. It was also heavier than modern sliotars (over 200g), and due to being made partly with horse-hair, tended to lose shape during play, and become soggy in wet conditions. The brown colour also meant that players tended to lose sight of the sliotar against crowded backdrops such as the crowd in [[Croke Park]].

McAuliffe's changes were to introduce a cork core, with a 2 piece white-tanned leather covering as the standard materials. These changes led to a harder wearing ball, which had better visibility (the white-tanned pigskin was impervious to grass stains and water resistant). The construction materials also meant that the ball was only about half as heavy as Treston's version.&lt;ref name="an fear rua"/&gt;

In the early 2000s, the GAA experimented with using sliotars with rubber rather than cork cores; however, it was found that using a rubber core led to a more unpredictable bounce, and moved a lot faster than a ball with a cork core, especially in wet conditions. It was decided to return to a cork ball in light of this.&lt;ref name="an fear rua"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anfearrua.com/story.asp?id=1892|title=The Science of Sliothars|accessdate=2009-09-16|date=2006-07-03|first=Eamon|last=Gormley|publisher=An Fear Rua}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sword of Gideon''''' is a 1986 Canadian [[television film]] about [[Mossad]] agents hunting down terrorists associated with the 1972 [[Munich massacre]]. It was first shown on the [[CTV Television Network]] in Canada as a four-hour miniseries and later on [[HBO]] in the United States. Directed by [[Michael Anderson (director)|Michael Anderson]] and written by [[Chris Bryant (writer)|Chris Bryant]], the film stars [[Steven Bauer]] and [[Michael York (actor)|Michael York]]. The film is based on the book ''[[Vengeance (Jonas book)|Vengeance]]'' by [[George Jonas]], an account of the incident which has been criticized by some intelligence personnel as fictional, though because of its covert nature is difficult to prove or disprove. In some countries the book was titled ''Vengeance: Sword of Gideon'', from which the movie title is drawn. The story was retold in the 2005 film ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'' by [[Steven Spielberg]].

'''Thialf''' is an ice arena in [[Heerenveen]], [[Netherlands]]. The stadium is used for [[long track speed skating]], [[short track speed skating]], [[ice hockey]], [[figure skating]], [[ice speedway]],&lt;ref&gt;www.fim-live.com/en/sport/sport/ice-speedway-gladiators/&lt;/ref&gt; and non-sports events. The outdoor rink was opened in 1967, and the indoor stadium was opened in 1986. Several world records were set in the indoor stadium. Annually, Thialf hosts two [[ISU Speed Skating World Cup|Speed Skating World Cup]] events. The arena has a capacity of 12,500 seats. [[Jan de Jong]] was the ice rink master at Thialf for many years.

==History==
[[File:Jan Smeekens (23-02-2008).jpg|thumb|left|Ice skaters and their coaches during the World Cup in the season 2007–2008]]
Thialf is named after [[Thialfi]], a character in [[Norse mythology]], who was [[Thor]]'s servant and had to race a giant.&lt;ref name="thialfi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Historie|url=http://thialf.nl/thialf/geschiedenis|publisher=Thialf|accessdate=6 November 2016|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the artificial outdoor ice rink was started in 1966 and it was opened on 14 October 1967 by [[Princess Christina of the Netherlands]]. It was the third 400m artificial ice rink in the Netherlands, after the [[Jaap Eden baan]] in [[Amsterdam]] and the IJsselstadion in [[Deventer]]. Several national and international tournaments were held in Thialf, but only one world record had been skated on the outdoor rink, by [[Andrea Schöne]] on the [[World record progression 5000 m speed skating women|5000 m]] in 1983.

The roofed stadium, which seats 12,500 people, opened on 17 November 1986, about a year after [[Sportforum Hohenschönhausen]] in [[Berlin]], which was the first 400m indoor speed skating oval in the world. Thanks to the indoor conditions, allowing climate control, almost all world speed skating records were broken at Thialf in the first season. Since 1988 it has been overtaken as the "fastest ice in the world" by the high-altitude indoor rinks in [[Olympic Oval|Calgary]] and [[Utah Olympic Oval|Salt Lake City]], which have the additional benefit of low air pressure.

Every year there are main skating events like the Dutch, European and World championships, and one or two [[ISU Speed Skating World Cup|Speed Skating World Cup]] events in Thialf.

The 2500-seat ice hockey arena adjacent to the speed skating oval is the home arena of the [[Heerenveen Flyers]], one of the Netherlands' most successful ice hockey clubs. It is also the main arena used in the Netherlands for international ice hockey tournaments, for example it host the [[2012 IIHF World U18 Championships|IIHF World U18 Championships]] (Division II, Group A) in late March 2012.

The stadium was renovated in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Second phase renovation Thialf|url=http://www.zja.nl/en/page/3872/second-phase-renovation-thialf|publisher=Zwart &amp; Jansma Architects|date=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thialf's new ice rink: sustainable, fast and ‘super-right’|url=https://www.priva.com/discover-priva/news-and-stories/thialf|publisher=[[Priva BV|Priva]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UMRA was the start of open wheel racing for [[NASCAR]] Driver [[Tony Stewart]].

Former UMRA turned pro drivers return to UMRA races for the fun of racing. One such example was in 2000, when [[Tony Stewart]] returned to UMRA for a quick race before a [[Winston Cup]] test. This was the first time he had raced against his father, [[Nelson Stewart]].&lt;ref name="Tony Stewart"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hpX_h76qRsEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=True+Speed+My+Racing+Life&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jE2wl7A73F&amp;sig=hYsnGaMCv0-mIZfo0H0hK5_xjVw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=v5tgTcrcCISglAfHwsWtDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=umra&amp;f=false Tony Stewart], True Speed My Racing Life, Page 372&lt;/ref&gt;

In sports, a '''utility player''' is one who can play several positions competently. Sports in which the term is often used include [[association football|football]], [[baseball]], [[rugby union]], [[rugby league]], [[water polo]], and [[softball]].

The term has gained prominence in all sports due to its use in [[fantasy league]]s, but in rugby and rugby league, it is commonly used by commentators to recognize a player's versatility.

== Association football ==
:''For a more comprehensive list, see: [[:Category:Association football utility players]]''

In football, like other sports, the utility man is usually a player who can play myriad positions. This will commonly be [[Defender (association football)|defence]] and [[midfielder|midfield]], sometimes defence and [[Striker (association football)|attack]]. A few outfield players have also made competent substitute [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeepers]], for example [[Phil Jagielka]], [[Jan Koller]] (originally trained as a goalkeeper before converting into a striker) and [[Cosmin Moți]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/11094410/Liverpool-v-Ludogorets-Razgrad-When-defender-Cosmin-Moti-was-hero-of-penalty-shoot-out-playing-in-goal.html|title=Liverpool v Ludogorets Razgrad: When defender Cosmin Moti was hero of penalty shoot-out - playing in goal|first=Jason|last=Burt|date=13 September 2014|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in the case of goalkeepers playing as outfield players, it is extremely rare.  Some may be free kick and penalty specialists ([[Rogério Ceni]], [[José Luis Chilavert]] and [[Jorge Campos]]), but they do not hold a role in the outfield. [[John O'Shea]], a former Manchester United player, is a famous example for playing in all positions in his United career. More recently, another Manchester United player, [[Phil Jones (footballer, born 1992)|Phil Jones]], has become a utility player being used as a right back, and centre back as well as taking up both defensive and more attacking midfield roles. The former Bulgarian international and [[Sporting Lisbon]] player [[Ivaylo Yordanov]] has played in all three outfield roles. Former Scottish international and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] captain [[Lee McCulloch]] also played in every outfield role for the club. Former Dutch international and [[Feyenoord]], [[PSV Eindhoven]] and [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] player [[Ruud Gullit]] played as a defender, midfielder and striker, changing his position even within a single game to accommodate the gaps caused by substitutions.

Perhaps an early example (though before the term gained popular usage) was England 1966 World Cup winner [[Martin Peters]] (who famously scored in that final), who played in every position- including briefly as goalkeeper- for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United.]]

== Baseball ==
{{See also|Utility infielder}}
In [[baseball]], a '''utility player''' is a player who can play several different positions. In general, each [[Major League Baseball]] team has at least one player who can be described as a utility player.

Most professional teams have two types of utility players. There are "[[utility infielder]]s", who usually play all of the infield positions (plus occasionally [[catcher]]). Utility [[outfielder]]s, or [[fourth outfielders]], tend to play all three outfield positions at various times. Occasionally, there will be players who perform a combination of the two duties. Utility players tend to be players who come off of the bench, though this is not absolute. Often, players who do not have high prospects to be a major league star will learn additional positions so they can look more attractive to major league clubs as [[bench jockey|bench talent]].

In {{by|1991}}, the [[Detroit Tigers]]' [[Tony Phillips]] was the first player to start ten games at five different positions in the same season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stretching One's Earning Power|first=Milton|last=Kent|newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=1994-04-29|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-04-29/sports/1994119046_1_new-position-delgado-blue-jays}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[César Tovar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/t/tovarce01.shtml|title=Cesar Tovar Statistics and History|work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=2010-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cookie Rojas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/rojasco01.shtml|title=Cookie Rojas Statistics and History|work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=2010-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bert Campaneris]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/campabe01.shtml|title=Bert Campaneris Statistics and History|work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=2010-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shane Halter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/haltesh01.shtml|title=Shane Halter Statistics and History|work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=2010-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Don Kelly (baseball)|Don Kelly]], [[Jose Oquendo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/o/oquenjo01.shtml|title=Jose Oquendo Statistics and History|work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=2010-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Scott Sheldon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/sheldsc01.shtml|title=Scott Sheldon Statistics and History|work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; all played every position (including [[pitcher]]) during their respective careers, with Tovar, Camperanis, Halter and Sheldon all doing it in one game.

In {{by|2005}} [[Chone Figgins]] started 48 games at third, 45 in center field and 36 at second, and finished 17th in [[American League]] [[Most Valuable Player]] balloting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/f/figgich01.shtml|title=Chone Figgins Statistics and History|work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=2010-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ryan Theriot]] of the [[San Francisco Giants]] has played shortstop, third base, [[second baseman|second]] and [[outfield]] at some point in his short major league career. [[Mark DeRosa]] for the [[Chicago Cubs]], [[Cleveland Indians]], [[St. Louis Cardinals]] [[Atlanta Braves]], and the San Francisco Giants has played most defensive positions. Former [[third baseman]] [[Brandon Inge]] has played third base, catcher, left field, right field, and center field. Second baseman [[Ben Zobrist]] of the [[Chicago Cubs]] has played first, third, second, shortstop and outfield, [[José Bautista (utility player)|José Bautista]] of [[Toronto Blue Jays]] has played first base, second base, third base, and outfield, and [[Josh Harrison]] of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] has played second base, shortstop, third base, outfield, and pitcher. All three have been named [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All Stars]] while playing multiple positions in their All-Star seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/players/7264/career;_ylt=AqdQfeiFpahSPQNM8MfGgQyFCLcF |title=José Bautista - Toronto Blue Jays - Career Statistics - MLB |publisher=Yahoo.com |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In {{by|2015}}, [[Brock Holt]] of the [[Boston Red Sox]] was the first player ever to be selected to the All Star Game after starting at seven or more positions before the break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/14/holt-1st-all-star-to-start-at-7-positions-before-b/?page=1|title=Holt 1st All-Star to start at 7 positions before break|first=The Washington Times|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|date=|website=washingtontimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zobrist and Bautista both finished in the top 10 in MVP voting while starting at least 40 games at two different defensive positions. [[Luis Sojo]] is considered to be the classic modern utility player in baseball, as he was a natural shortstop, but could also play 3rd base, 2nd base, 1st base, and even left field. It was said that in emergency situations, he could even play a bit of catcher.

A third type of utility player is often seen in youth baseball, and occasionally in [[college baseball]]—a player talented enough as a [[pitcher]] and [[position player]] to play in both roles. The term "utility player" is not typically used to describe such an individual, with "[[two-way player]]" used instead. Two recent examples of two-way players in modern college baseball are [[A. J. Reed]] and [[Brendan McKay (baseball)|Brendan McKay]], both of whom were consensus national players of the year while playing regularly as [[first baseman|first basemen]] and starting pitchers—Reed in [[2014 Kentucky Wildcats baseball team|2014]] with [[Kentucky Wildcats baseball|Kentucky]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/baseball/2014/06/14/kentuckys-2-way-star-a-j-reed-wins-howser-trophy/10523951/ |title=Kentucky's 2-way star A.J.

Even more rarely, a player can have the talent to play both roles at the top professional level. [[Babe Ruth]] began his career as a pitcher, but proved to be such a strong hitter that he briefly alternated in the two roles until becoming a full-time position player. A current example is [[Shohei Ohtani]], who made the Best Nine of [[Nippon Professional Baseball|Japan's]] [[Pacific League]] as both a pitcher and a hitter in [[2016 Nippon Professional Baseball season|2016]], and is a [[designated hitter]] / [[starting pitcher]] for the [[Los Angeles Angels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/18208693/shohei-otani-eyeing-move-mlb-2017-season |title=Japanese MVP Shohei Otani weighing MLB move for 2018 |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=December 6, 2016 |accessdate=January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Tweener (basketball)|Swingman}}

The term "utility player" is rarely used in basketball outside of fantasy basketball leagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; Instead; basketball uses the terms [[tweener (basketball)|tweener]] and [[swingman]] to refer to a player who can play two or three different positions, with more specific terms being [[combo guard]], [[forward-center]], and [[stretch four]].

== Ice hockey ==
In ice hockey, it is common for [[Centre (ice hockey)|centres]] and [[Winger (ice hockey)|wingers]] to play either position in certain situations. Depending on need, a team may use a natural centreman on the wing if they have too many centres or, conversely, a winger may be pressed to play centre because of a lack of suitable players in that area. Because of the frequency of [[Forward (ice hockey)|forwards]] playing both positions, the term utility player tends to refer not to a player that plays more than one forward position, but to a player that can play both [[Defenceman (ice hockey)|defence]] and forward. Teams may use a defenceman as a forward, or vice versa, for a variety of reasons.

Sometimes a natural defenceman who struggles on the defensive side of the game but possesses strong offensive qualities may be used as a winger. [[Marc-Andre Bergeron]] and [[Kurtis Foster]], for example, have proven to be quality offensive defencemen who struggle in defending their own zone. As such, they have dressed as forwards so their teams can continue to use their offensive abilities on the [[power play (sporting term)|powerplay]] while still using the standard six defencemen during [[even strength]].

An extra defenceman may also be pressed to play forward in an emergency situation, where a team has a rash of injuries to their forwards and do not have time to summon a replacement player from a [[farm team]].

It is very common for teams to use a forward on "[[the point (ice hockey)|the point]]" during the powerplay to provide a greater offensive threat. Though the forward is playing defence in this situation, they aren't necessarily seen as true utility players.

Along with Bergeron and Foster, other notable defencemen that have played forward at some point in their careers include [[Phil Housley]], [[Brent Burns]], [[Mark Streit]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/sports/story.html?id=0d969d38-5373-4c15-94e4-c3e9c2002620 |title=Versatile Streit makes it look easy with Habs |publisher=Canada.com |date=2008-02-11 |accessdate=2013-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326053419/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/sports/story.html?id=0d969d38-5373-4c15-94e4-c3e9c2002620 |archivedate=2014-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christoph Schubert]], [[Ian White (ice hockey)|Ian White]] and [[Chris Campoli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://senators.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=510124 |title=Campoli making forward move - Ottawa Senators|publisher=NHL.com |accessdate= 2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable forwards who have played defence include [[Sergei Fedorov]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dispatch.com/live/contentbe/dispatch/2007/03/16/20070316-B4-02.html{{dead link|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mathieu Dandenault]], [[Brooks Laich]] and [[Sami Kapanen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://whalerslegends.blogspot.com/2009/06/sami-kapanen.html |title=Hartford Whalers Legends: Sami Kapanen |publisher=WhalersLegends.blogspot.com |date=2009-06-07 |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases a player has made a full-time conversion from one position to the other and experienced success. Hockey Hall of Famer [[Red Kelly]] spent the first half of his career as an offensive defenceman for the Detroit Red Wings before finishing his career as a strong [[two-way player|two-way centreman]] for the Toronto Maple Leafs. [[Wendel Clark]] was a star defenceman in junior before converting to left wing and scoring over 300 goals and 500 points in 15 NHL seasons. (Some junior hockey teams have a tendency to put their best offensive players on defence instead of as forwards, since defencemen generally have more time on the ice.) [[Dustin Byfuglien]] is an example of a current player who has made the switch from forward to defence full-time. [[Jonathan Ericsson]] of the Detroit Red Wings is another example of a player who converted from forward to defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redwingscentral.com/prospects/ericsson.php |accessdate=April 19, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213093400/http://www.redwingscentral.com/prospects/ericsson.php |archivedate=February 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is extremely rare for goaltenders to play any position other than goaltender; likewise, it is just as rare for non-goaltenders to suit up in goal, because of the significant difference in skills and equipment required for the position.

==Gridiron football==
{{expert-subject|date=January 2012}}
In [[gridiron football]], the utility player is often capable of playing multiple positions, and often they may play both offense and defense. The concept was far more common in the early days of football, when pro teams used their best athletes as many ways as possible, and substitutions were far more restricted, meaning players had to stay on the field for offense, defense and "special teams". This was known as the [[one-platoon system]].

The [[triple threat man]], who could run, pass and kick, was particularly popular during the early days of football from the time the forward pass was invented to the World War II era (see, for instance, [[Bradbury Robinson]], [[Tommy Hughitt]], [[Sammy Baugh]] and, during his college years, [[Johnny Unitas]]). Most levels of football lifted the substitution restrictions during the post-World War II era in the late 1940s, beginning with "platooning" (use of different offensive and defensive units) and eventually transitioning to complete free substitution. [[Chuck Bednarik]], a center and linebacker, was the last full-time two way player in the NFL, having retired in 1962. Despite this, the [[American Football League]] of the 1960s frequently used players at multiple positions, particularly kickers and punters (e.g. [[George Blanda]], [[Paul Maguire]], [[Cookie Gilchrist]], [[Gino Cappelletti]], and [[Gene Mingo]], a running back who became the first black placekicker in modern professional football, among others). Because of increased injury risk awareness, since the [[AFL-NFL merger]] these types of players are increasingly rare, and true utility players usually end up specializing in one position (for example, [[Lane Johnson]] played quarterback, tight end, defensive end and offensive tackle through college but was tagged specifically at offensive tackle when drafted into the NFL). Those that do play multiple positions for any extended period of time are mostly backups (e.g. [[Guido Merkens]], [[Brad Smith (American football)|Brad Smith]] and [[Joe Webb]]) or career minor-league players (e.g. [[Don Jonas]], [[Eric Crouch]] and [[Charles Puleri]]). It is still very common in smaller high schools to see top players play two or even three ways (offense, defense and special teams), in multiple positions, but in college and pro ball, where rosters are larger and the talent pool is more elite, the injury risk outweighs potential benefits.

In the [[National Football League]], [[Bill Belichick]] of the [[New England Patriots]] uses the utility player frequently. For instance, [[Doug Flutie]], as a former member of the Patriots, famously switched from quarterback to kicker for one extra-point play in 2006, to deliver the first [[drop kick]] in the NFL in sixty years. Belichick has also used his linebackers, including [[Bryan Cox]] and [[Mike Vrabel]], as [[H-back]]s on offense, and doubled his wide receivers (e.g. [[Troy Brown]] and [[Randy Moss]]) as cornerbacks and safeties. Additionally, [[Houston Texans]] defensive end [[J. J. Watt]] lined up at tight end in special goal-line packages in 2014, catching three touchdown passes. The 6' 5" Watt played tight end in high school before becoming a full-time defensive player.

The [[tackle-eligible play|tackle eligible]] is a special form of utility player; examples of those who used this play notably include [[Jason Peters]], [[Warren Sapp]], [[Jumbo Elliott (American football)|Jumbo Elliott]], [[William Perry (American football)|William "The Refrigerator" Perry]], [[Mitch Frerotte]] and [[Anthony Muñoz]]. Another example of a type of utility player is the [[halfback option play]], in which a [[running back]] performs the passing duties of a [[quarterback]]; [[Walter Payton]], [[LaDanian Tomlinson]] and most recently [[Ronnie Brown]] have used this play multiple times, and this type of play has spawned an entire [[Wildcat offense|offensive scheme]]. Note that generally, a player who plays one regular position as well as special teams is ''usually'' not considered a utility player, nor are hybrid running back/wide receivers such as [[Reggie Bush]]; only those who play two distinct offensive and/or defensive positions are considered such, as are those who play an offensive or defensive position and in addition kick or punt.

The "offense/offensive weapon" (also known as OW) is an offensive player that can play multiple different positions. The OW role contains, but is not limited too, players that can play quarterback, running back, tight end, and wide receiver. [[Kordell Stewart]] was the first player to be used in this role back in the 1990s, but it became popular in the early 2010s.  Back when Stewart played this role, it was known as the "Slash" role.  The Jacksonville Jaguars' OW [[Denard Robinson]] was the first to be officially an OW but other current examples of the OW position include Carolina Panthers Quarterback [[Joe Webb]] (has started at WR in the NFL) Minnesota Vikings Tight End and Fullback [[MarQueis Gray]] (who started at QB and WR at the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|University of Minnesota]]), and New Orleans Saints quarterback [[Taysom Hill]].

The [[Arena Football League]], for many years, made almost all of its players, with the exception of two players on each side (always a quarterback, a kicker {the quarterback and kicker were never on the field at the same time} and usually a wide receiver and two defensive backs), play both sides of the ball; this was known as "ironman." The "ironman" concept was dropped in 2007.

With the exception of the now defunct NFL Europe almost all European American Football leagues have players that play offense defense and special teams. Especially when the number of "American" players is limited they are often on the field for as many snaps as possible both on offense and defense

== Rugby league ==
The use of utility in rugby league is more expansive because not only would a player play only at backs' (or forwards') positions, some may play in forward and back positions with similar roles (e.g. halfback/hooker), or even play so many different positions as injury cover. [[Lance Hohaia]] is a prime example of this as he played in six different positions in his NRL career.

== Rugby union ==
Utility player is a term used mostly in New Zealand. In rugby union, it comes in a form of utility back. It is mostly a back who can cover at least two positions. Notable examples in New Zealand include [[Daniel Bowden]], [[Luke McAlister]] and [[Cory Jane]], but Australia also has many utility backs like [[Adam Ashley-Cooper]], [[Kurtley Beale]] and [[Matt Giteau]]. A South African example is [[François Steyn]].

Despite that, there are forwards who are capable of covering multiple positions. Many players in the back row of the scrum ([[Flanker (rugby union)|flanker]]s and [[Number eight (rugby union)|number eight]]s) will frequently switch between the two positions. Notable players in English rugby have made the transition between back row to the back line as they possess transferrable skills &amp; are usually the quicker &amp; more mobile of the pack, less often a player may also be capable of playing [[Lock (rugby union)|lock]] as well as a back-row position, with several modern examples being [[Sébastien Chabal]], [[Steven Luatua]], [[Kieran Read]], and [[Maro Itoje]], all with international caps in both rows of the scrum. However, this description never applies to props who can play both ends of the front row (i.e. Numbers 1 &amp; 3), unless the player has the ability to cover as a [[Hooker (rugby union)|hooker]] (e.g. [[John Afoa]], a prop who could cover as a hooker, or [[John Smit]], primarily a hooker but also capped internationally at both prop positions).

== Fantasy sports ==
In [[fantasy baseball]] and [[fantasy basketball|basketball]], a utility player is a player (specifically a batter in baseball) who accumulates statistics without being assigned to a particular position.  The batter can play any position; he need not actually be a utility player (for example, if a fantasy manager has two first baseman, he can assign one to the first base position and one to a utility slot).  Similarly, a person assigned a utility slot in fantasy basketball need not be a tweener or swingman.

The '''Vientiane Buffalos''' rugby football club (sometimes spelled ''Buffaloes'') was founded in 1998 by [[rugby union]] playing expatriates in the capital of [[Laos]]. The club has grown gradually since then and is a full member of the [[Lao Rugby Federation]] (LRF). As well as men's contact rugby ([[Rugby sevens|sevens]], tens and fifteen-a-side), the club organises touch rugby tournaments involving women and children. Members of the Buffalos have been instrumental in promoting the sport in Laos, setting up the LRF and establishing a Lao national team and other clubs to play against.

The '''Wheel Blacks''' are the national [[wheelchair rugby]] team of [[New Zealand]]. The team won the gold medal at the [[2004 Summer Paralympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzlive.com/en/news/paralympians-aim-for-medals-in-beijing "Paralympians aim for Medals in Beijing"], NZ Live, July 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 Wheel Blacks were captained by [[Tim Johnson (Wheelchair Rugby)|Tim Johnson]] and coached by [[Grant Sharman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rugbyfoundation.com/rugby_foundation/news?p=view&amp;news_id=187 Interview with Grant Sharman by Brent Ward], rugbyfoundation.com, October 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Wheel Blacks'' name is [[New Zealand national team nomenclature based on the "All Blacks"|one of many]] national team nicknames related to the [[All Blacks]].

Johnson captained the Wheel Blacks at the [[2008 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Beijing]], although the team finished third in their group, salvaging fifth overall in the consolation matches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-05/07/content_8118188.htm "New Zealand to send a 30-strong team to Beijing Paralympic Games"], Xinhua, May 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zakiya Nassar''', sometimes spelled "Zakia" ({{lang-ar|زكية نصار}}), born April 2, 1987 in Bethlehem, Palestine),&lt;ref name=GM&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080707.wswimmers07/BNStory/International/home?cid=al_gam_mostview "For Palestinian swimmers, it's a chance to swim"], ''Globe and Mail'', July 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; is an Olympic swimmer from [[State of Palestine|Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080916182539/http://results.beijing2008.cn/WRM/ENG/BIO/Athlete/6/236366.shtml Nassar's bio] from the 2008 Olympics website; retrieved 2009-07-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

She [[Palestine at the 2008 Summer Olympics|represented Palestine]] at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]]. In the lead-up to the Games, her coach, relayed by the media, commented that Nassar faced severe difficulties in training, due to her lack of access to a swimming pool. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' reported that "[t]here is no Olympic-sized pool in the Palestinian territories and no budget to speak of for the Palestinian Olympic swimmers".&lt;ref name=GM/&gt; Nassar told the media that she was receiving no support from the Palestinian authorities, that she was able to swim once a month "at best", and that she feared a disastrous performance in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courriersport.com/actu/jo/160408_Palestine.asp "JEUX OLYMPIQUES: Les Palestiniens à rude épreuve"], ''Courier international''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3527840,00.html "From Jenin to Beijing"], [[Ynetnews]], April 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Israel]]i authorities subsequently granted her authorisation to swim in a pool in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3529275,00.html "Palestinian Olympic runner receives exit permit"], Ynetnews, April 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Nassar won her heat in the [[Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Women's 50 metre freestyle|50 metre freestyle event]], but her time of 31.97 was not sufficient for her to advance to the next round.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africa.reuters.com/sport/news/usnBAN549894.html "Beijing's youngest is leader of the laggards"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908040055/http://africa.reuters.com/sport/news/usnBAN549894.html |date=2008-09-08 }}, Reuters, August 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
