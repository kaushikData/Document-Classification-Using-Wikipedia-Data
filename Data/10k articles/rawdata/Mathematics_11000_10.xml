The '''accumulation function''' ''a''(''t'') is a function defined in terms of time ''t'' expressing the ratio of the value at time ''t'' ([[future value]]) and the initial investment ([[present value]]). It is used in [[interest theory]]. 

Thus ''a''(0)=1 and the value at time ''t'' is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;A(t) = A(0) \cdot a(t)&lt;/math&gt;.  
where the initial investment is &lt;math&gt;A(0).&lt;/math&gt;

For various interest-accumulation protocols, the accumulation function is as follows (with ''i'' denoting the [[interest rate]] and ''d'' denoting the [[annual effective discount rate|discount rate]]):
*[[simple interest]]: &lt;math&gt;a(t)=1+t \cdot i&lt;/math&gt;
*[[compound interest]]: &lt;math&gt;a(t)=(1+i)^t&lt;/math&gt;
*[[simple discount]]: &lt;math&gt;a(t) = 1+\frac{td}{1-d}&lt;/math&gt;
*[[compound discount]]: &lt;math&gt;a(t) = (1-d)^{-t}&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of a positive [[rate of return]], as in the case of interest, the accumulation function is an [[increasing function]].

==Variable rate of return==
The [[Rate_of_return#Logarithmic_or_continuously_compounded_return|logarithmic or continuously compounded return]], sometimes called [[Compound interest#Force of interest|force of interest]], is a function of time defined as follows: 

:&lt;math&gt;\delta_{t}=\frac{a'(t)}{a(t)}\,&lt;/math&gt;

which is the rate of change with time of the natural logarithm of the accumulation function.

Conversely:

:&lt;math&gt;a(t)=e^{\int_0^t \delta_u\, du}&lt;/math&gt;

reducing to

:&lt;math&gt;a(t)=e^{t \delta}&lt;/math&gt;
for constant &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;.

The effective [[annual percentage rate]] at any time is:
:&lt;math&gt;  r(t) = e^{\delta_t} - 1&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1243">In [[mathematical analysis]], the '''Alexandrov theorem''', named after [[Aleksandr Danilovich Aleksandrov]], states that if {{mvar|U}} is an [[open set|open subset]] of [[Euclidean space|{{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}]] and &amp;thinsp;{{math|''f''&amp;thinsp;: ''U'' &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}}&amp;thinsp; is a [[convex function]], then {{math|''f''}} has a second derivative almost everywhere.

In this context, having a second derivative at a point means having a second-order Taylor expansion at that point with a local error smaller than any quadratic.

The result is closely related to [[Rademacher's theorem]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15280">[[File:Graph betweenness.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|An [[undirected graph]] colored based on the betweenness centrality of each vertex from least (red) to greatest (blue).]]
In [[graph theory]], '''betweenness centrality''' is a measure of [[centrality]] in a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] based on [[Shortest path problem|shortest paths]]. For every pair of vertices in a connected graph, there exists at least one shortest path between the vertices such that either the number of edges that the path passes through (for unweighted graphs) or the sum of the weights of the edges (for weighted graphs) is minimized. The betweenness centrality for each [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] is the number of these shortest paths that pass through the vertex.

Betweenness centrality finds wide application in [[network theory]]: it represents the degree of which nodes stand between each other. For example, in a [[telecommunications network]], a node with higher betweenness centrality would have more control over the network, because more information will pass through that node. Betweenness centrality was devised as a general measure of centrality:{{Sfnp|Freeman|1977|p=39}} it applies to a wide range of problems in network theory, including problems related to social [[network theory|networks]], biology, transport and scientific cooperation.

Although earlier authors have intuitively described centrality as based on betweenness, {{Harvp|Freeman|1977}} gave the first formal definition of betweenness centrality.

== Definition ==

The betweenness centrality of a node &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is given by the expression:

:&lt;math&gt;g(v)= \sum_{s \neq v \neq t}\frac{\sigma_{st}(v)}{\sigma_{st}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{st}&lt;/math&gt; is the total number of shortest paths from node &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; to node &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{st}(v)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of those paths that pass through &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that the betweenness centrality of a node scales with the number of pairs of nodes as implied by the summation indices. Therefore, the calculation may be rescaled by dividing through by the number of pairs of nodes not including &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;g \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;. The division is done by &lt;math&gt;(N-1)(N-2)&lt;/math&gt; for directed graphs and &lt;math&gt;(N-1)(N-2)/2&lt;/math&gt; for undirected graphs, where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the number of nodes in the giant component. Note that this scales for the highest possible value, where one node is crossed by every single shortest path. This is often not the case, and a normalization can be performed without a loss of precision
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{normal}(g(v)) = \frac{g(v) - \min(g)}{\max(g) - \min(g)}&lt;/math&gt;
which results in:
:&lt;math&gt;\max(normal) = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\min(normal) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
Note that this will always be a scaling from a smaller range into a larger range, so no precision is lost.

== The load distribution in real and model networks ==

[[File:Load Dist.png|thumb|400px|Plot showing the power law distribution of load in a scale free network for various values of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;.Circles: &lt;math&gt;\gamma=2.2&lt;/math&gt;

Diamonds:&lt;math&gt;\gamma=3.0&lt;/math&gt;,
X's:&lt;math&gt;\gamma=4.0&lt;/math&gt;,
Triangles:&lt;math&gt;\gamma= \infin &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="Goh"&gt;K.-I. Goh, B. Kahng, and D. Kim PhysRevLett.87.278701&lt;/ref&gt;]]

--&gt;
&lt;!--
It has been shown that the load distribution of a [[scale-free network]] follows a [[power law]] given by a load exponent &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;,{{Sfnp|Goh|Kahng|Kim|2001}}
:&lt;math&gt;P(g) \approx g^{-\delta}&lt;/math&gt;      (1)
this implies the scaling relation to the degree of the node,
:&lt;math&gt;g(k) \approx k^\eta&lt;/math&gt;.
Where &lt;math&gt;g(k)&lt;/math&gt; is the average load of vertices with degree &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. The exponents &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; are not independent since equation (1) implies &lt;ref name="Bart"&gt;M. Barthélemy. Betweenness centrality in large complex networks. Eur. Phys. J. B 38, 163–168 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P(g)= \int P(k) \delta (g-k^\eta) dk&lt;/math&gt;
For large g, and therefore large k, the expression becomes
:&lt;math&gt;P(g\gg1)= \int k^{-\gamma} \delta (g-k^\eta) dk&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sim g^{-1-\frac{\gamma -1}{\eta}} &lt;/math&gt;
which proves the following equality:
:&lt;math&gt;\eta=\frac{\gamma -1}{\delta -1}&lt;/math&gt;

The important exponent appears to be &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; which describes how the betweenness centrality depends on the connectivity. The situation which maximizes the betweenness centrality for a vertex is when all shortest paths are going through it, which corresponds to a tree structure (a network with no clustering). In the case of a tree network the maximum value of &lt;math&gt;\eta = 2&lt;/math&gt; is reached.&lt;ref name="Bart" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\eta = 2 \rarr \delta = \frac{\gamma +1}{2} &lt;/math&gt;
This maximal value of &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; (and hence minimum of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;) puts bounds on the load exponents for networks with non-vanishing clustering.
:&lt;math&gt;\eta \le 2 \rarr \delta \ge \frac{\gamma +1}{2} &lt;/math&gt;
In this case, the exponents &lt;math&gt;\delta , \eta &lt;/math&gt; are not universal and depend on the different details (average connectivity, correlations, etc.)

=== Real networks ===

Real world scale free networks, such as the internet, also follow a power law load distribution.&lt;ref name="Goh2"&gt;Kwang-Il Goh, Eulsik Oh, Hawoong Jeong, Byungnam Kahng, and Doochul Kim. Classification of scale-free networks. PNAS (2002) vol. 99 no. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This is an intuitive result. Scale free networks arrange themselves to create short path lengths across the network by creating a few hub nodes with much higher connectivity than the majority of the network. These hubs will naturally experience much higher loads because of this added connectivity.
---&gt;

== Weighted networks  ==
In a weighted network the links connecting the nodes are no longer treated as binary interactions, but are weighted in proportion to their capacity, influence, frequency, etc., which adds another dimension of heterogeneity within the network beyond the topological effects. A node's strength in a weighted network is given by the sum of the weights of its adjacent edges.

:&lt;math&gt;s_{i} = \sum_{j=1}^{N} a_{ij}w_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

With &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; being adjacency and weight matrices between nodes &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.
Analogous to the power law distribution of degree found in scale free networks, the strength of a given node follows a power law distribution as well.

:&lt;math&gt;s(k) \approx k^\beta &lt;/math&gt;

A study of the average value &lt;math&gt;s(b)&lt;/math&gt; of the strength for vertices with betweenness &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; shows that the functional behavior can be approximated by a scaling form &lt;ref name="Barrat"&gt;A. Barrat, M. Barthelemy, R. Pastor-Satorras, and A. Vespignani. The architecture of complex weighted networks. PNAS (2004) vol. 101 no. 11&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s(b)\approx b^{\alpha} &lt;/math&gt;

==Percolation centrality==

Percolation Centrality is a version of weighted betweenness centrality, but it considers the 'state' of the source and target nodes of each shortest path in calculating this weight.  Percolation of a ‘contagion’ occurs in complex networks in a number of scenarios. For example, viral or bacterial infection can spread over social networks of people, known as contact networks. The spread of disease can also be considered at a higher level of abstraction, by contemplating a network of towns or population centres, connected by road, rail or air links. Computer viruses can spread over computer networks. Rumours or news about business offers and deals can also spread via social networks of people. In all of these scenarios, a ‘contagion’ spreads over the links of a complex network, altering the ‘states’ of the nodes as it spreads, either recoverably or otherwise. For example, in an epidemiological scenario, individuals go from ‘susceptible’ to ‘infected’ state as the infection spreads. The states the individual nodes can take in the above examples could be binary (such as received/not received a piece of news), discrete (susceptible/infected/recovered), or even continuous (such as the proportion of infected people in a town), as the contagion spreads. The common feature in all these scenarios is that the spread of contagion results in the change of node states in networks. Percolation centrality (PC) was proposed with this in mind, which specifically measures the importance of nodes in terms of aiding the percolation through the network. This measure was proposed by Piraveenan et al.&lt;ref name="piraveenan2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Piraveenan |first1 = Mahendra | year=2013| title = Percolation Centrality: Quantifying Graph-Theoretic Impact of Nodes during Percolation in Networks | journal = PLOS ONE | volume=8 | issue=1 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0053095 | pages=e53095 | pmid=23349699 | pmc=3551907| bibcode=2013PLoSO...853095P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Percolation Centrality is defined for a given node, at a given time, as the proportion of ‘percolated paths’ that go through that node. A ‘percolated path’ is a shortest path between a pair of nodes, where the source node is percolated (e.g., infected). The target node can be percolated or non-percolated, or in a partially percolated state.

:&lt;math&gt;PC^t(v)= \frac{1}{N-2}\sum_{s \neq v \neq r}\frac{\sigma_{sr}(v)}{\sigma_{sr}}\frac{{x^t}_s}{{\sum {[{x^t}_i}]}-{x^t}_v}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{sr}&lt;/math&gt; is total number of shortest paths from node &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; to node &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{sr}(v)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of those paths that pass through &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. The percolation state of the node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;{x^t}_i&lt;/math&gt; and two special cases are when &lt;math&gt;{x^t}_i=0&lt;/math&gt; which indicates a non-percolated state at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; whereas when &lt;math&gt;{x^t}_i=1&lt;/math&gt; which indicates a fully percolated state at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. The values in between indicate partially percolated states ( e.g., in a network of townships, this would be the percentage of people infected in that town).

The attached weights to the percolation paths depend on the percolation levels assigned to the source nodes, based on the premise that the higher the percolation level of a source node is, the more important are the paths that originate from that node. Nodes which lie on shortest paths originating from highly percolated nodes are therefore potentially more important to the percolation. The definition of PC may also be extended to include target node weights as well. Percolation centrality calculations run in [[Big O notation|&lt;math&gt;O(NM)&lt;/math&gt;]] time with an efficient implementation adopted from Brandes' fast algorithm and if the calculation needs to consider target nodes weights, the worst case time is [[Big O notation|&lt;math&gt;O(N^3)&lt;/math&gt;]].

== Algorithms ==
Calculating the betweenness and closeness centralities of all the [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] in a graph involves calculating the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices on a graph, which takes [[big theta|&lt;math&gt;\Theta(|V|^3)&lt;/math&gt;]] time with the [[Floyd–Warshall algorithm]], modified to not only find one but count all shortest paths between two nodes. On a sparse graph, [[Johnson's algorithm]] or Brandes' algorithm may be more efficient, both taking [[Big O notation|&lt;math&gt;O(|V|^2 \log |V| + |V| |E|)&lt;/math&gt;]] time. On unweighted graphs, calculating betweenness centrality takes [[Big O notation|&lt;math&gt;O(|V| |E|)&lt;/math&gt;]] time using Brandes' algorithm.{{Sfnp|Brandes|2001|p=1}}

In calculating betweenness and closeness centralities of all vertices in a graph, it is assumed that graphs are undirected and connected with the allowance of loops and multiple edges. When specifically dealing with network graphs, often graphs are without loops or multiple edges to maintain simple relationships (where edges represent connections between two people or vertices). In this case, using Brandes' algorithm will divide final centrality scores by 2 to account for each shortest path being counted twice.{{Sfnp|Brandes|2001|p=9}}

Another algorithm generalizes the Freeman's betweenness computed on geodesics and Newman's betweenness computed on all paths, by introducing a hyper-parameter controlling the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. The time complexity is the number of edges times the number of nodes in the graph.{{Sfnp|Mantrach|2010}}

The concept of centrality was extended to a group level as well.&lt;ref name=group&gt;Puzis, R., Yagil, D., Elovici, Y., Braha, D. (2009)[http://necsi.edu/affiliates/braha/Internet_Research_Anonimity.pdf Collaborative attack on Internet users’ anonymity], ''Internet Research'' '''19'''(1)&lt;/ref&gt; Group betweenness centrality shows the proportion of geodesics connecting pairs of non-group members that pass through a group of nodes. Brandes'  algorithm for computing the betweenness centrality of all vertices was modified to compute the group betweenness centrality of one group of nodes with the same asymptotic running time.&lt;ref name="group"/&gt;

== Related concepts ==
''Betweenness centrality'' is related to a network's [[Connectivity (graph theory)|connectivity]], in so much as high betweenness vertices have the potential to disconnect graphs if removed (see [[Cut (graph theory)|cut set]]) .

In [[graph theory]], '''boxicity''' is a [[graph invariant]], introduced by [[Fred S. Roberts]] in 1969.

The boxicity of a graph is the minimum [[dimension]] in which a given graph can be represented as an [[intersection graph]] of axis-parallel [[box (shape)|box]]es. That is, there must exist a one-to-one correspondence between the [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] of the graph and a set of boxes, such that two boxes intersect if and only if there is an edge connecting the corresponding vertices.

==Examples==
The figure shows a graph with six vertices, and a representation of this graph as an intersection graph of rectangles (two-dimensional boxes). This graph cannot be represented as an intersection graph of boxes in any lower dimension, so its boxicity is two.

{{harvtxt|Roberts|1969}} showed that the graph with 2''n'' vertices formed by removing a [[perfect matching]] from a [[complete graph]] on 2''n'' vertices has boxicity exactly ''n'': each pair of disconnected vertices must be represented by boxes that are separated in a different dimension than each other pair. A box representation of this graph with dimension exactly ''n'' can be found by thickening each of the 2''n'' facets of an ''n''-dimensional [[hypercube]] into a box. Because of these results, this graph has been called the ''Roberts graph'',&lt;ref&gt;E.g., see {{harvtxt|Chandran|Francis|Sivadasan|2010}} and  {{harvtxt|Chandran|Sivadasan|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although it is better known as the '''cocktail party graph''' and it can also be understood as the [[Turán graph]] ''T''(2''n'',''n'').

==Relation to other graph classes==
A graph has boxicity at most one if and only if it is an [[interval graph]]; the boxicity of an arbitrary graph ''G'' is the minimum number of interval graphs on the same set of vertices such that the intersection of the edges sets of the interval graphs is ''G''. Every [[outerplanar graph]] has boxicity at most two,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Scheinerman|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and every [[planar graph]] has boxicity at most three.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Thomassen|1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a bipartite graph has boxicity two, it can be represented as an intersection graph of axis-parallel line segments in the plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bellantoni|Ben-Arroyo Hartman|Przytycka|Whitesides|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algorithmic results==
Many graph problems can be solved or approximated more efficiently for graphs with bounded boxicity than they can for other graphs; for instance, the [[maximum clique problem]] can be solved in polynomial time for graphs with bounded boxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Chandran|Francis|Sivadasan|2010}} observe that this follows from the fact that these graphs have a polynomial number of [[maximal clique]]s. An explicit box representation is not needed to list all maximal cliques efficiently.&lt;/ref&gt; For some other graph problems, an efficient solution or approximation can be found if a low-dimensional box representation is known.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{harvtxt|Agarwal|van Kreveld|Suri|1998}} and {{harvtxt|Berman|DasGupta|Muthukrishnan|Ramaswami|2001}} for approximations to the [[maximum independent set]] for intersection graphs of rectangles, and {{harvtxt|Chlebík|Chlebíková|2005}} for results on hardness of approximation of these problems in higher dimensions.&lt;/ref&gt; However, finding such a representation may be difficult:
it is [[NP-complete]] to test whether the boxicity of a given graph is at most some given value ''K'', even for ''K'' = 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Cozzens|1981}} shows that computing the boxicity is NP-complete; {{harvtxt|Yannakakis|1982}} shows that even checking whether the boxicity is at most 3 is NP-hard; finally {{harvtxt|Kratochvil|1994}} showed that recognising boxicity 2 is NP-hard.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{harvtxt|Chandran|Francis|Sivadasan|2010}} describe algorithms for finding representations of arbitrary graphs as intersection graphs of boxes, with a dimension that is within a [[logarithm]]ic factor of the [[degree (graph theory)|maximum degree]] of the graph; this result provides an upper bound on the graph's boxicity.

Despite being hard for its natural parameter, boxicity is [[parameterized complexity|fixed-parameter tractable]] when parameterized by the [[vertex cover]] number of the input graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Adiga|Chitnis|Saurabh|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bounds==
[[Louis Esperet]] proved the following bound of the boxicity of ''G'' graph with ''m'' edges, which is asymptotically optimal:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;box(G) = O(\sqrt{m \cdot log(m)})&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Esperet"&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Esperet |first=Louis |date=2015 |title=Boxicity and Topological Invariants|eprint=1503.05765 |class=math.CO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related graph invariants==
* [[Cubicity]] is defined in the same way as boxicity but with axis-parallel [[hypercube]]s instead of hyperrectangles.&lt;!--For a graph G, its cubicity cub(G) is the minimum dimension k such that G is representable as the intersection graph of (axis-parallel) cubes in k-dimensional space.--&gt; Boxicity is a generalization of cubicity.
* [[Sphericity (graph theory)|Sphericity]] is defined in the same way as boxicity but with unit-diameter spheres.&lt;!-- The sphericity of a graph G is the smallest n such that the vertices in G can be mapped into unit-diameter spheres in n-space in such a way that two vertices are adjacent in G if and only if their assigned spheres intersect.  --&gt;

[[Louis Esperet]] proved the following connection between the [[Colin de Verdière invariant]] and boxicity of the same graph:
&lt;math&gt;box(G) = O(\mu(G)^4(log(\mu(G))^2)&lt;/math&gt;, and conjectured that the boxicity of ''G'' is at most the Colin de Verdière invariant of ''G''.&lt;ref name="Esperet"/&gt;

'''Calculator''' is a basic [[calculator]] [[application (software)|application]] made by [[Apple Inc.]] and bundled with [[macOS]]. It has three modes: basic, scientific, and programmer. Basic includes a number pad, buttons for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing, as well as memory keys. Scientific mode supports exponents and trigonometric functions, and programmer mode gives the user access to more options related to [[computer programming]].

The Calculator program has a long associated history with the beginning of the Macintosh platform, where a simple four-function calculator program was a standard [[desk accessory]] from the earliest system versions. Though no [[scientific calculator|higher math]] capability was included, third-party developers provided upgrades, and Apple released the [[NuCalc|Graphing Calculator]] application with the first [[PowerPC]] release (7.1.2) of the Mac OS, and it was a standard component through Mac OS 9. Apple currently ships a different application called [[Grapher]].

Calculator has [[Reverse Polish notation]] support, and can also speak the buttons pressed and result returned.

The calculator also includes some basic conversion functions to convert between units in the following categories:

*Area
*Currency
*Energy or Work
*Temperature
*Length
*Speed
*Pressure
*Weight/Mass
*Power
*Volume

Currency [[exchange rate]]s may be updated from the Internet.{{Citation needed|date = March 2015}}

==History==
[[File:Macintosh Calculator 1984.png|thumb|right|The calculator as it shipped in 1984.]]
The Calculator appeared first as a [[desk accessory]] in [[History_of_Mac_OS#System_1.2C_2.2C_3_.26_4|first version]] of [[Macintosh System]] for the 1984 [[Macintosh 128k]]. Its original incarnation was developed by [[Chris Espinosa]] and its appearance was designed, in part, by [[Steve Jobs]] when Espinosa, flustered by Jobs's dissatisfaction with all of his prototype designs, conceived an application called ''The Steve Jobs Roll Your Own Calculator Construction Set'' that allowed Jobs to tailor the look of the calculator to his liking. Its design was maintained with the same basic math operations until [[Mac OS 9|the final release of classic Mac OS]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1812">In mathematics, '''chromatic homotopy theory''' is a subfield of [[stable homotopy theory]] that studies [[complex-oriented cohomology theory|complex-oriented cohomology theories]] from the "chromatic" point of view, which is based on [[Daniel Quillen|Quillen]]'s work relating cohomology theories to formal groups. In this picture, theories are classified in terms of their "chromatic levels"; i.e., the heights of the [[formal group]]s that define the theories via the [[Landweber exact functor theorem]]. Typical theories it studies include: [[complex K-theory]], [[elliptic cohomology]], [[Morava K-theory]] and [[Topological modular forms|tmf]].
&lt;!--
== Chromatic convergence theorem ==
In algebraic topology, the '''chromatic convergence theorem''' states the [[homotopy limit]] of the [[chromatic tower]] (defined below) of a finite [[local spectrum|''p''-local spectrum]] ''X'' is ''X'' itself. The theorem was proved by Hopkins and Ravenel.

== Statement ==
Let &lt;math&gt;L_n&lt;/math&gt; denotes the localization with respect to homology theory. Let ''X'' be a spectrum. For example, &lt;math&gt;L_0 X&lt;/math&gt; is the rational localization and &lt;math&gt;L_1 X&lt;/math&gt; is the localization with respect to [[p-adic K-theory|''p''-local ''K''-theory]]. The resulting sequence
:&lt;math&gt;\cdots \rightarrow L_2 X \rightarrow L_1 X \rightarrow L_0 X&lt;/math&gt;
is called the chromatic tower, and one can take its homotopy limit. The theorem says

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2586">In a [[spherical coordinate system]], a '''colatitude''' is the [[complementary angle]] of a given [[latitude]], i.e. the difference between 90° and the latitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|last=Weisstein |first=Eric W. |title=Colatitude |work=MathWorld |publisher=[[Wolfram Research]] |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Colatitude.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Southern Hemisphere|Southern latitudes]] are given a negative value and are thus denoted with a [[minus sign]].

The colatitude corresponds to the conventional polar angle in spherical coordinates, as opposed to the latitude as used in [[cartography]].

==Examples==
Latitude and colatitude sum up to 90°.

==Astronomical use==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
The colatitude is most 
useful in [[astronomy]] because it refers to the [[zenith distance]] of the [[celestial pole]]s. For example, at [[42nd parallel north|latitude 42&amp;deg;N]], [[Polaris]] (approximately on the North celestial pole) has an [[Celestial coordinate system#Altitude|altitude]] of 42°, so the distance from the [[zenith]] (overhead point) to Polaris is {{nowrap|1=90 − 42 = 48°}}.

Adding the declination of a star to the observer's colatitude gives the maximum latitude of that star (its angle from the [[horizon]] at [[culmination]] or upper transit). For example, if [[Alpha Centauri]] is seen with a latitude of 72° north (108° south) and its declination is known (60°S), then it can be determined that the observer's colatitude is {{nowrap|1=108° − 60° = 48°}} (i.e. their latitude is {{nowrap|1=90° − 48° = 42°S}}).

Stars whose declinations exceed the observer's colatitude are called [[Circumpolar star|circumpolar]] because they will never set as seen from that latitude. If an object's declination is further south on the celestial sphere than the value of the colatitude, then it will never be seen from that location. For example, Alpha Centauri will always be visible at night from [[Perth, Western Australia]] because the colatitude is {{nowrap|1=90° − 32° = 58°}}, and 60° is greater than 58°; on the other hand, the star will never rise in [[Juneau]] because its declination of −60° is less than −32° (the negation of Juneau's colatitude). Additionally, colatitude is used as part of the [[Schwarzschild metric]] in general relativity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1671">In [[topology]], a '''continuous group action''' on a [[topological space]] ''X'' is a [[group action]] of a [[topological group]] ''G'' that is continuous: i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;G \times X \to X, \quad (g, x) \mapsto g \cdot x&lt;/math&gt;
is a continuous map. Together with the group action, ''X'' is called a '''''G''-space'''.

If &lt;math&gt;f: H \to G&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous group homomorphism of topological groups and if ''X'' is a ''G''-space, then ''H'' can act on ''X'' ''by restriction'': &lt;math&gt;h \cdot x = f(h) x&lt;/math&gt;, making ''X'' a ''H''-space. Often ''f'' is either an inclusion or a quotient map. In particular, any topological space may be thought of as a ''G''-space via &lt;math&gt;G \to 1&lt;/math&gt; (and ''G'' would act trivially.)

Two basic operations are that of taking the space of points fixed by a subgroup ''H'' and that of forming a quotient by ''H''. We write &lt;math&gt;X^H&lt;/math&gt; for the set of all ''x'' in ''X'' such that &lt;math&gt;hx = x&lt;/math&gt;. For example, if we write &lt;math&gt;F(X, Y)&lt;/math&gt; for the set of continuous maps from a ''G''-space ''X'' to another ''G''-space ''Y'', then, with the action &lt;math&gt;(g \cdot f)(x) = g f(g^{-1} x)&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;F(X, Y)^G&lt;/math&gt; consists of ''f'' such that &lt;math&gt;f(g x) = g f(x)&lt;/math&gt;; i.e., ''f'' is an [[equivariant map]]. We write &lt;math&gt;F_G(X, Y) = F(X, Y)^G&lt;/math&gt;. Note, for example, for a ''G''-space ''X'' and a closed subgroup ''H'',  &lt;math&gt;F_G(G/H, X) = X^H&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3567">In the mathematical discipline of [[graph theory]], the '''Erdős–Pósa theorem''', named after [[Paul Erdős]] and [[Lajos Pósa (mathematician)|Lajos Pósa]], states that there is a function {{math|''f''(''k'')}} such that for each [[positive integer]] {{mvar|k}}, every graph either contains {{mvar|k}} vertex-disjoint [[Cycle (graph theory)|circuits]] or it has a [[feedback vertex set]] of {{math|''f''(''k'')}} vertices that intersects every circuit. Furthermore, {{math|1=''f''(''k'') = O(''k'' log ''k'')}} in the sense of [[Big O notation]].  Because of this theorem, circuits are said to ''have the Erdős–Pósa property''.

The theorem claims that for any finite number {{mvar|k}} there is an appropriate (least) value {{math|''f''(''k'')}}, with the property that in every graph with no {{mvar|k}} vertex-disjoint circuits all circuits can be covered by {{math|''f''(''k'')}} vertices. This generalized an unpublished result of [[Béla Bollobás]], which states that {{math|1=''f''(2) = 3}}. {{harvtxt|Erdős|Pósa|1965}} obtained the bounds {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''k'' log ''k'' &lt; ''f''(''k'') &lt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''k'' log ''k''}} for the general case. The result suggests that although there  are infinitely many different graphs with no {{mvar|k}} disjoint circuits, they split into finitely many simply describable classes. For the case {{math|1=''k'' = 2}}, {{harvtxt|Lovász|1965}}  gave a complete characterization. {{harvtxt|Voss|1969}} proved {{math|1=''f''(3) = 6}} and {{math|9 ≤ ''f''(4) ≤ 12}}.

==Erdős–Pósa property==
A family {{math|'''''F'''''}} of graphs or [[hypergraph]]s is defined to have the Erdős–Pósa property if there exists a function {{math|''f'': '''N''' → '''N'''}} such that for every (hyper-)graph {{mvar|G}} and every integer {{mvar|k}} one of the following is true:

*{{mvar|G}} contains {{mvar|k}} vertex-disjoint subgraphs each isomorphic to a graph in {{math|'''''F'''''}}; or
*{{mvar|G}} contains a vertex set {{mvar|C}} of size at most {{math|''f''(''k'')}} such that {{math|''G'' &amp;minus; ''C''}} has no subgraph isomorphic to a graph in {{math|'''''F'''''}}.

The definition is often phrased as follows.  If one denotes by {{math|''ν''(''G'')}} the maximum number of vertex disjoint subgraphs of {{mvar|G}} isomorphic to a graph in {{math|'''''F'''''}} and by {{math|''τ''(''G'')}} the minimum number of vertices whose deletion from {{mvar|G}} leaves a graph without a subgraph isomorphic to a graph in {{math|'''''F'''''}}, then {{math|''τ''(''G'') ≤ ''f''(''ν''(''G''))}}, for some function {{math|''f'': '''N''' → '''N'''}} not depending on {{mvar|G}}.

He was active in [[Alexandria]] during the reign of [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy&amp;nbsp;I]] (323–283 BC). His ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' is one of the most influential works in the [[history of mathematics]], serving as the main textbook for teaching [[mathematics]] (especially [[geometry]]) from the time of its publication until the late 19th or early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, pp. 50–62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, pp. 100–19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macardle, et al. (2008). ''Scientists: Extraordinary People Who Altered the Course of History.'' New York: Metro Books. g. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Elements'', Euclid deduced the theorems of what is now called [[Euclidean geometry]] from a small set of [[axiom]]s. Euclid also wrote works on [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]], [[conic section]]s, [[spherical geometry]], [[number theory]], and [[Mathematical rigour|rigor]].

Euclid is the anglicized version of the Greek name Εὐκλείδης, which means "renowned, glorious".&lt;ref name="Etymology"&gt;{{cite web

== Life ==
Very few original references to Euclid survive, so little is known about his life. He was likely born c. 325 BC, although the place and circumstances of both his birth and death are unknown and may only be estimated roughly relative to other people mentioned with him. He is rarely mentioned by name by other Greek mathematicians from [[Archimedes]] (c. 287 BC – c. 212 BC) onward, and is usually referred to as "ὁ στοιχειώτης" ("the author of Elements").&lt;ref&gt;Heath (1981), p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; The few historical references to Euclid were written centuries after he lived, namely by [[Proclus]] c. 450 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, David. ''Euclid''. Clark University Department of Mathematics and Computer Science. [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/Euclid.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed biography of Euclid is given by Arabian authors, mentioning, for example, a birth town of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]. This biography is generally believed to be fictitious.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, John J.; Robertson, Edmund F., "Euclid of Alexandria"; Heath 1956, p. 4; Heath 1981, p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt; If he came from Alexandria, he would have known the [[Serapeum of Alexandria]], and the [[Library of Alexandria]], and may have worked there during his time. Euclid's arrival in Alexandria came about ten years after its founding by [[Alexander the Great]], which means he arrived c. 322 BC.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|isbn=978-0787638139|location=Detroit, Mich.|page=126|oclc=41497065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proclus introduces Euclid only briefly in his ''Commentary on the Elements''. According to Proclus, Euclid supposedly belonged to [[Plato]]'s "persuasion" and brought together the ''Elements'', drawing on prior work of [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] and of several pupils of Plato (particularly [[Theaetetus (mathematician)|Theaetetus]] and [[Philip of Opus]].) Proclus believes that Euclid is not much younger than these, and that he must have lived during the time of [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy I]] (c. 367 BC – 282 BC) because he was mentioned by Archimedes. Although the apparent citation of Euclid by Archimedes has been judged to be an interpolation by later editors of his works, it is still believed that Euclid wrote his works before Archimedes wrote his.&lt;ref&gt;Proclus, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JZEHj2fEmqAC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;vq=euclid&amp;dq=proclus+commentary+elements&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0#PPR30,M1 p. XXX]; O'Connor, John J.; Robertson, Edmund F., "Euclid of Alexandria" &lt;/ref&gt; Proclus later retells a story that, when Ptolemy I asked if there was a shorter path to learning geometry than Euclid's ''Elements'', "Euclid replied there is no royal road to geometry."&lt;ref&gt;Proclus, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JZEHj2fEmqAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 57]&lt;/ref&gt; This anecdote is questionable since it is similar to a story told about [[Menaechmus]] and Alexander the Great.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Euclidis quae supersunt omnia.tif|thumb|''Euclidis quae supersunt omnia'' (1704)]]

Euclid died c. 270 BC, presumably in Alexandria.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the only other key reference to Euclid, [[Pappus of Alexandria]] (c. 320 AD) briefly mentioned that [[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonius]] "spent a very long time with the pupils of Euclid at Alexandria, and it was thus that he acquired such a scientific habit of thought" c. 247–222&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Heath (1956), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~cherlin/History/Papers1999/schmarge.html|title=Conic Sections in Ancient Greece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the lack of biographical information is unusual for the period (extensive biographies being available for most significant Greek mathematicians several centuries before and after Euclid), some researchers have proposed that Euclid was not a historical personage, and that his works were written by a team of mathematicians who took the name Euclid from [[Euclid of Megara]] (à la [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]]). However, this hypothesis is not well accepted by scholars and there is little evidence in its favor.&lt;ref&gt; O'Connor, John J.; Robertson, Edmund F., "Euclid of Alexandria"; {{cite book|title=Les livres arithmétiques d'Euclide|author=Jean Itard|year=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Elements'' ==

Although many of the results in ''Elements'' originated with earlier mathematicians, one of Euclid's accomplishments was to present them in a single, logically coherent framework, making it easy to use and easy to reference, including a system of rigorous [[mathematical proof]]s that remains the basis of mathematics 23 centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;Struik p.&amp;nbsp;51 ("their logical structure has influenced scientific thinking perhaps more than any other text in the world").&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no mention of Euclid in the earliest remaining copies of the ''Elements'', and most of the copies say they are "from the edition of [[Theon of Alexandria|Theon]]" or the "lectures of Theon",&lt;ref&gt;Heath (1981), p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt; while the text considered to be primary, held by the Vatican, mentions no author. The only reference that historians rely on of Euclid having written the ''Elements'' was from Proclus, who briefly in his ''Commentary on the Elements'' ascribes Euclid as its author.

Although best known for its geometric results, the ''Elements'' also includes [[number theory]]. It considers the connection between [[perfect numbers]] and [[Mersenne primes]] (known as the [[Euclid–Euler theorem]]), the [[Euclid's theorem|infinitude of prime numbers]], [[Euclid's lemma]] on factorization (which leads to the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] on uniqueness of [[integer factorization|prime factorizations]]), and the [[Euclidean algorithm]] for finding the [[greatest common divisor]] of two numbers.

The geometrical system described in the ''Elements'' was long known simply as ''[[geometry]]'', and was considered to be the only geometry possible. Today, however, that system is often referred to as ''[[Euclidean geometry]]'' to distinguish it from other so-called ''[[Non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]]'' that mathematicians discovered in the 19th century.

===Fragments===
{{See also|Oxyrhynchus Papyri}}
The [[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 29]] (P. Oxy. 29) is a fragment of the second book of the ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' of Euclid, unearthed by [[Bernard Grenfell|Grenfell]] and [[Arthur Surridge Hunt|Hunt]] 1897 in [[Oxyrhynchus]]. More recent scholarship suggests a date of 75–125 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Fowler |year=1999 |title=The Mathematics of Plato's Academy |edition=Second |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0198502586 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HuwwIdk-xL8C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the ''Elements'', at least five works of Euclid have survived to the present day. They follow the same logical structure as ''Elements'', with definitions and proved propositions.
* ''[[Data (Euclid)|Data]]'' deals with the nature and implications of "given" information in geometrical problems; the subject matter is closely related to the first four books of the ''Elements''.
* ''On Divisions of Figures'', which survives only partially in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translation, concerns the division of geometrical figures into two or more equal parts or into parts in given [[ratio]]s. It is similar to a first-century AD work by [[Heron of Alexandria]].
* ''[[Catoptrics]]'', which concerns the mathematical theory of mirrors, particularly the images formed in plane and spherical concave mirrors. The attribution is held to be anachronistic however by J J O'Connor and E F Robertson who name [[Theon of Alexandria]] as a more likely author.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, John J.; Robertson, Edmund F., "Theon of Alexandria"&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Phaenomena'', a treatise on [[spherical astronomy]], survives in Greek; it is quite similar to ''On the Moving Sphere'' by [[Autolycus of Pitane]], who flourished around 310 BC.

[[File:EuclidStatueOxford.jpg|thumb|right|upright|19th-century statue of Euclid by [[Joseph Durham]] in the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]]]]
* ''[[Euclid's Optics|Optics]]'' is the earliest surviving Greek treatise on perspective. In its definitions Euclid follows the Platonic tradition that vision is caused by [[Emission theory (vision)|discrete rays which emanate from the eye]]. One important definition is the fourth: "Things seen under a greater angle appear greater, and those under a lesser angle less, while those under equal angles appear equal." In the 36 propositions that follow, Euclid relates the apparent size of an object to its distance from the eye and investigates the apparent shapes of cylinders and cones when viewed from different angles. Proposition 45 is interesting, proving that for any two unequal magnitudes, there is a point from which the two appear equal. [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]] believed these results to be important in astronomy and included Euclid's ''Optics'', along with his ''Phaenomena'', in the ''Little Astronomy'', a compendium of smaller works to be studied before the ''Syntaxis'' (''Almagest'') of [[Claudius Ptolemy]].

=== Lost works ===
Other works are credibly attributed to Euclid, but have been lost.
* ''Conics'' was a work on [[conic section]]s that was later extended by [[Apollonius of Perga]] into his famous work on the subject. It is likely that the first four books of Apollonius's work come directly from Euclid. According to Pappus, "Apollonius, having completed Euclid's four books of conics and added four others, handed down eight volumes of conics." The Conics of Apollonius quickly supplanted the former work, and by the time of Pappus, Euclid's work was already lost.
* ''[[Porism]]s'' might have been an outgrowth of Euclid's work with conic sections, but the exact meaning of the title is controversial.
* ''Pseudaria'', or ''Book of Fallacies'', was an elementary text about errors in [[reasoning]].
* ''Surface Loci'' concerned either [[Locus (mathematics)|loci]] (sets of points) on surfaces or loci which were themselves surfaces; under the latter interpretation, it has been hypothesized that the work might have dealt with [[Quadric|quadric surfaces]].
* Several works on [[mechanics]] are attributed to Euclid by Arabic sources. ''On the Heavy and the Light'' contains, in nine definitions and five propositions, Aristotelian notions of moving bodies and the concept of specific gravity. ''On the Balance'' treats the theory of the lever in a similarly Euclidean manner, containing one definition, two axioms, and four propositions. A third fragment, on the circles described by the ends of a moving lever, contains four propositions. These three works complement each other in such a way that it has been suggested that they are remnants of a single treatise on mechanics written by Euclid.

The '''Fermi–Pustyl'nikov model''', named after [[Enrico Fermi]] and [[Lev Pustyl'nikov]], is a model of the Fermi acceleration mechanism.

A point mass falls with a constant [[acceleration]] vertically on the infinitely heavy horizontal wall, which moves vertically in accordance with analytic periodic law in time. The point interacts with the wall by the law of [[elastic collision]].  For this model it was proved that under some general conditions the [[velocity]] and [[energy]] of the point at the moments of collisions with the wall tend to infinity for an [[open set]] of initial data having the infinite [[Lebesgue measure]].&lt;ref name="Pustyln1"&gt;L.

(2), (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;  This model was introduced in 1968 in,&lt;ref name="Pustyln3"&gt;L. D. Pustyl'nikov (1968), On a dynamical system. (Russian) Uspekhi Mat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7860">The '''Fibonacci word fractal''' is a [[fractal]] curve defined on the plane from the [[Fibonacci word]].

== Definition ==
[[File:Fibonacci fractal first iterations.png|thumb|The first iterations]]
This curve is built iteratively by applying, to the Fibonacci word  0100101001001...etc., the Odd–Even Drawing rule:

For each digit at position ''k'' :
* if the digit is 0 : draw a segment in the current direction
* if the digit is 1 : draw a segment after a 90° angle turn:
** to the right if ''k'' is even
** to the left if ''k'' is odd
To a Fibonacci word of length &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; (the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; [[Fibonacci number]]) is associated a curve &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_n&lt;/math&gt; made of &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; segments. The curve displays three different aspects whether ''n'' is in the form 3''k'', 3''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, or 3''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2.

== Properties&lt;ref&gt;[http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00367972/fr/ The Fibonacci word fractal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|eprint=1601.04786|title=Hausdorff Dimension of Generalized Fibonacci Word Fractals|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|last1=Hoffman|first1=Tyler|last2=Steinhurst|first2=Benjamin|class=math.MG|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
[[File:FWF whites quares.png|thumb|The Fibonacci numbers in the Fibonacci word fractal.]]
* The curve &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F_n}&lt;/math&gt;, contains &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; segments, &lt;math&gt;F_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; right angles and &lt;math&gt;F_{n-2}&lt;/math&gt; flat angles.
* The curve never self-intersects and does not contain double points. At the limit, it contains an infinity of points asymptotically close.
* The curve presents self-similarities at all scales. The reduction ratio is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{1+\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;. This number, also called the [[silver ratio]] is present in a great number of properties listed below.
* The number of self-similarities at level ''n'' is a Fibonacci number \&amp;nbsp;−1. (more precisely : &lt;math&gt;F_{3n+3}-1&lt;/math&gt;).
* The curve encloses an infinity of square structures of decreasing sizes in a ratio  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{1+\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;. (see figure) The number of those square structures is a [[Fibonacci number]].
* The curve &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_n&lt;/math&gt;can also be constructed by different ways (see gallery below):
** [[Iterated function system]]  of 4 and 1 homothety of ratio &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{1/(1+\sqrt2)}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{1/(1+\sqrt2)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
** By joining together the curves  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_{n-2}&lt;/math&gt;
** [[L-system|Lindermayer system]] 
** By an iterated construction of 8 square patterns around each square pattern.
** By an iterated construction of [[octagon]]s 
* The [[Hausdorff dimension]] of the Fibonacci word fractal is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{3\frac{\log\varphi}{\log(1+\sqrt 2)}= 1,6379}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\varphi=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[golden ratio]].
* Generalizing to an angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; between 0 and &lt;math&gt;\pi/2&lt;/math&gt;, its Hausdorff dimension is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{3\frac{\log\varphi}{\log(1+a+\sqrt{(1+a)^2+1}})}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;a=\cos\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.
* The Hausdorff dimension of its frontier is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\frac{\log 3}{{\log(1+\sqrt 2})}= 1,2465}&lt;/math&gt;.
* Exchanging the roles of "0" and "1" in the Fibonacci word, or in the drawing rule yields a similar curve, but oriented 45°.
* From the Fibonacci word, one can define the « dense Fibonacci word», on an alphabet of 3 letters : 102210221102110211022102211021102110221022102211021... ({{OEIS|id=A143667}}). The usage, on this word, of a more simple drawing rule, defines an infinite set of variants of the curve, among which :
** a «diagonal variant»
** a «svastika variant»
** a «compact variant »
* It is conjectured that the Fibonacci word fractal appears for every [[sturmian word]] for which the slope, written in [[Continued fraction|continued fraction expansion]], ends with an infinite series of&amp;nbsp;"1".

== The Fibonacci tile ==
[[File:Tiling Fibonacci word fractal.png|thumb|Imperfect tiling by the Fibonacci tile. The area of the central square tends to infinity.]]
The juxtaposition of four &lt;math&gt;F_{3k}&lt;/math&gt; curves allows the construction of a closed curve enclosing a surface whose area is not null. This curve is called a "Fibonacci Tile".
* The Fibonacci tile almost tiles the plane. The juxtaposition of 4 tiles (see illustration) leaves at the center a free square whose area tends to zero as k tends to infinity. At the limit, the infinite Fibonacci tile tiles the plane.
* If the tile is enclosed un a square of side 1, then its area tends to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{2-\sqrt{2} = 0.5857}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Fibonacci snowflake ===
The Fibonacci snowflake is a Fibonacci tile defined by:&lt;ref name="Blondin"&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/233l63132272n203/ Christoffel and Fibonacci tiles]&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{q_n = q_{n-1}q_{n-2}}&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{n\equiv2 \pmod 3}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{q_n = q_{n-1}\overline{q}_{n-2}}&lt;/math&gt; otherwise.
with &lt;math&gt;q_0=\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_1=R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L = &lt;/math&gt;"turn left" et &lt;math&gt;R = &lt;/math&gt;"turn right", and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\overline{R} = L}&lt;/math&gt;,

Several remarkable properties :&lt;ref name="Blondin" /&gt;{{,}}:&lt;ref name="Blondin2"&gt;[http://www.lirmm.fr/~labbe/pdf/fibonacci_snowflakes.pdf Fibonacci snowflakes]&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is the Fibonacci tile associated to the "diagonal variant" previously defined.
* It tiles the plane at any order.
* It tiles the plane by translation in two different ways. 
* its perimeter, at order ''n'', equals &lt;math&gt;4F(3n+1)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;F(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; [[Fibonacci number]]. 
* its area, at order ''n'', follows the successive indexes of odd row of the [[Pell number|Pell sequence]] (defined by &lt;math&gt;P(n)=2P(n-1)+P(n-2)&lt;/math&gt;).

In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[graph theory]], the '''Frucht graph''' is a 3-[[regular graph]] with 12 vertices, 18 edges, and no nontrivial [[graph automorphism|symmetries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname=FruchtGraph|title=Frucht Graph}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first described by [[Robert Frucht]] in 1939.&lt;ref name="f38"/&gt;

The Frucht graph is a [[pancyclic graph|pancyclic]] [[Halin graph]] with [[chromatic number]] 3, [[chromatic index]] 3, radius 3, and diameter 4. As with every Halin graph, the Frucht graph is [[polyhedral graph|polyhedral]] ([[planar graph|planar]] and [[k-vertex-connected graph|3-vertex-connected]]) and  [[Hamiltonian graph|Hamiltonian]], with [[Girth (graph theory)|girth]] 3. Its [[Glossary_of_graph_theory#Independence|independence number]] is 5.

The Frucht graph can be constructed from the [[LCF notation]]: [−5,−2,−4,2,5,−2,2,5,−2,−5,4,2].

==Algebraic properties==
The Frucht graph is one of the two smallest [[cubic graph]]s possessing only a single [[graph automorphism]], the identity&lt;ref&gt;Skiena, S. Implementing Discrete Mathematics: Combinatorics and Graph Theory with Mathematica. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; (that is, every vertex can be distinguished topologically from every other vertex). Such graphs are called [[asymmetric graph|asymmetric]] (or identity) graphs. [[Frucht's theorem]] states that any [[group (mathematics)|group]] can be realized as the group of symmetries of a graph,&lt;ref name="f38"&gt;{{Citation | last1=Frucht | first1=R. | title=Herstellung von Graphen mit vorgegebener abstrakter Gruppe. | url=http://www.numdam.org/item?id=CM_1939__6__239_0 | language=German | zbl=0020.07804 | year=1939 | journal=Compositio Mathematica | issn=0010-437X | volume=6 | pages=239–250}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a strengthening of this theorem also due to Frucht states that any group can be realized as the symmetries of a 3-regular graph;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Frucht | first1=R. | title=Graphs of degree three with a given abstract group | url=http://cms.math.ca/cjm/v1/p365 | doi = 10.4153/CJM-1949-033-6 | mr=0032987 | year=1949 | journal=[[Canadian Journal of Mathematics]] | issn=0008-414X | volume=1 | pages=365–378}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Frucht graph provides an example of this realization for the [[trivial group]].

The [[characteristic polynomial of a graph|characteristic polynomial]] of the Frucht graph is &lt;math&gt;(x-3) (x-2) x (x+1) (x+2) (x^3+x^2-2 x-1) (x^4+x^3-6 x^2-5 x+4)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Hansen's problem''' is a problem in planar [[surveying]], named after the astronomer [[Peter Andreas Hansen]] (1795&amp;ndash;1874), who worked on the geodetic survey of Denmark. There are two known points ''A'' and ''B'', and two unknown points ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. From ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; an observer measures the angles made by the lines of sight to each of the other three points.  The problem is to find the positions of ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. See figure; the angles measured are&amp;nbsp;(''&amp;alpha;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''&amp;beta;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''&amp;alpha;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''&amp;beta;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

Since it involves observations of angles made at unknown points, the problem is an example of [[Resection (orientation)|resection]] (as opposed to intersection).

== Solution method overview==

Define the following angles: 
''&amp;gamma;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''AP''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''&amp;delta;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''BP''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''&amp;phi;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''AB'', ''&amp;psi;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''BA''.
As a first step we will solve for ''&amp;phi;'' and ''&amp;psi;''.
The sum of these two unknown angles is equal to the sum of ''&amp;beta;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''&amp;beta;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, yielding the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\phi+\psi=\beta_1+\beta_2.&lt;/math&gt;

A second equation can be found more laboriously, as follows.  The [[law of sines]] yields

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{AB}{P_2 B}=\frac{\sin \alpha_2}{\sin \phi}&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_2 B}{P_1 P_2}=\frac{\sin \beta_1}{\sin \delta}.&lt;/math&gt;

Combining these, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{AB}{P_1 P_2}=\frac{\sin \alpha_2 \sin \beta_1}{\sin \phi \sin \delta}.&lt;/math&gt;

Entirely analogous reasoning on the other side yields

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{AB}{P_1 P_2}=\frac{\sin \alpha_1 \sin \beta_2}{\sin \psi \sin \gamma}.&lt;/math&gt;

Setting these two equal gives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin \phi}{\sin \psi}=\frac{\sin \gamma \sin \alpha_2 \sin \beta_1}{\sin \delta \sin \alpha_1 \sin \beta_2} = k.&lt;/math&gt;

Using a known [[trigonometric identity]] this ratio of sines can be expressed as the tangent of an angle difference:

:&lt;math&gt;\tan \frac{\phi - \psi}{2}=\frac{k-1}{k+1}\tan\frac{\phi+\psi}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the second equation we need. Once we solve the two equations for the two unknowns &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, we can use either of the two expressions above for &lt;math&gt;\frac{AB}{P_1 P_2}&lt;/math&gt; to find ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; since ''AB'' is known.  We can then find all the other segments using the law of sines.&lt;ref&gt;Udo Hebisch: Ebene und Sphaerische Trigonometrie, Kapitel 1, Beispiel 4 (2005, 2006)[http://www.mathe.tu-freiberg.de/~hebisch/skripte/sphaerik/strigo.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Solution algorithm ==
We are given four angles (''&amp;alpha;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''&amp;beta;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''&amp;alpha;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''&amp;beta;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and the distance ''AB''.  The calculation proceeds as follows:

* Calculate &lt;math&gt;\gamma=\pi-\alpha_1-\beta_1-\beta_2,\quad \delta=\pi-\alpha_2-\beta_1-\beta_2.&lt;/math&gt;
* Calculate &lt;math&gt;k=\frac{\sin \gamma \sin \alpha_2 \sin \beta_1}{\sin \delta \sin \alpha_1 \sin \beta_2}.&lt;/math&gt;
* Let &lt;math&gt;s=\beta_1+\beta_2, \quad d=2 \arctan \left[ \frac{k-1}{k+1}\tan(s/2)\right]&lt;/math&gt; and then &lt;math&gt;\phi=(s+d)/2, \quad \psi=(s-d)/2.&lt;/math&gt;
* Calculate 
::&lt;math&gt;P_1 P_2 = AB \frac{\sin \phi \sin \delta}{\sin \alpha_2 \sin \beta_1}&lt;/math&gt;

: or equivalently

::&lt;math&gt;P_1 P_2 = AB \frac{\sin \psi \sin \gamma}{\sin \alpha_1 \sin \beta_2}.&lt;/math&gt;

: If one of these fractions has a denominator close to zero, use the other one.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12641">'''Hari Seldon''' is a fictional character in [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Foundation series|''Foundation'' series]]. In his capacity as mathematics professor at [[Streeling University]] on the planet [[Trantor]], Seldon develops [[Psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]], an algorithmic science that allows him to predict the future in probabilistic terms. On the basis of his psychohistory he is able to predict the eventual fall of the [[Galactic Empire (Asimov)|Galactic Empire]] and to develop a means to shorten the millennia of chaos to follow. The significance of his discoveries lies behind his nickname "Raven" Seldon.

In the first five books of the ''Foundation'' series, Hari Seldon made only one in-the-flesh appearance, in the first part of the first book (''[[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|Foundation]]''), although he did appear other times in pre-recorded messages to reveal a [[Seldon Crisis]]. After writing five books in chronological order, Asimov went back with two books to better describe the initial process. The two prequels—''[[Prelude to Foundation]]'' and ''[[Forward the Foundation]]''—describe his life in considerable detail. He is also the central character of the Second Foundation Trilogy written after Asimov's death (''[[Foundation's Fear]]'' by [[Gregory Benford]], ''[[Foundation and Chaos]]'' by [[Greg Bear]], and ''[[Foundation's Triumph]]'' by [[David Brin]]), which are set after Asimov's two prequels.

== Fictional biography ==
Galactic Empire First Minister and psychohistorian Hari Seldon was born in the 10th month of the 11,988th&amp;nbsp;year of the Galactic Era (GE) (-79&amp;nbsp;Foundation Era (FE)) and died 12,069&amp;nbsp;GE (1&amp;nbsp;FE).&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;According to the ''Encyclopedia Galactica'' (Asimov's fictitious encyclopedia often cited in his future history novels), "It is thought that Seldon's birthdate, which some consider doubtful, may have been adjusted to match that of Cleon's" the last Galactic Emperor of the Entun Dynasty (''Prelude to Foundation'', p.&amp;nbsp;3).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;In Asimov's saga, the Galactic Era begins when the [[Galactic Empire (Asimov)|Galactic Empire]] is founded at an unknown date roughly 11,000&amp;nbsp;years in the future: The timeline can be deduced from some hints Asimov dropped in his other science fiction works, including the [[Robot series (Asimov)|''Robot'']] and [[Galactic Empire (series)|''Empire'']] series.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born on the planet [[Helicon (planet)|Helicon]] in the [[Arcturus]] sector where his father worked as a tobacco grower in a hydroponics plant.

He shows incredible mathematical abilities at a very early age. He also learns [[martial arts]] on Helicon that later help him on Trantor, the principal art being Heliconian Twisting (a form seemingly equal parts [[Jujutsu|Jiu Jitsu]], [[Krav Maga]], and [[Submission Wrestling]]). Helicon is said to be "less notable for its mathematics, and more for its martial arts" (''Prelude to Foundation''). Seldon is awarded a Ph.D. in mathematics for his work on turbulence at the University of Helicon.&lt;ref name="Asimovprelude"&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Prelude to Foundation |publisher=Bantam Books |year=1989 |pages=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he becomes an assistant professor specializing in the mathematical analysis of social structures.&lt;ref name="Asimovprelude"/&gt;{{rp|p. 73}} {{rp|p. 76}}

Seldon is the subject of a biography by [[Gaal Dornick]]. Seldon is Emperor [[Cleon I]]'s second and last First Minister, the first being [[Eto Demerzel]]/[[R. Daneel Olivaw]]. He is deposed as First Minister after Cleon I's assassination.

{{quote|Seldon, Hari— . . . found dead, slumped over desk in his office at Streeling University in 12,069 (1&amp;nbsp;F.E.). Apparently Seldon had been working up to his last moments on psychohistorical equations; his activated Prime Radiant was discovered clutched in hand. According to Seldon’s instructions, the instrument was shipped by his colleague Gaal Dornick who had recently emigrated to Terminus. Seldon's body was jettisoned into space, also in accordance with instructions he’d left. The official memorial service on Trantor was simple, though attended. It was worth noting that Seldon’s old friend former First Minister Eto Demerzel attended the event. Demerzel had not been seen since his mysterious disappearance immediately following the Joranumite Conspiracy during the reign of Emperor Cleon&amp;nbsp;I. Attempts by the Commission of Public Safety to locate Demerzel in the days following the Seldon memorial proved to be unsuccessful. [[Wanda Seldon]], Hari Seldon’s granddaughter, did not attend the ceremony. It was rumored that she was grief-stricken and had refused all public appearances. To this day, her whereabouts from then on remain unknown. It has been said that Hari Seldon left this life as lived it, for he died with the future he created unfolding all around him.|[[Encyclopedia Galactica]]}}

== ''Foundation'' ==
Using psychohistory, Seldon mathematically determines what he calls ''The [[Seldon Plan]]''—a plan to determine the right time and place to set up a new society, one that would replace the collapsing [[Galactic Empire (Asimov)|Galactic Empire]] by sheer force of social pressure, but over only a thousand-year time span, rather than the ten-to-thirty-thousand-year time span that would normally have been required, and thus reduce the human suffering from living in a time of barbarism. The Foundation is placed on Terminus, a resource-poor planet entirely populated by scientists and their families. The planet—or so Seldon claimed—was originally occupied to create the ''[[Encyclopedia Galactica]],'' a vast compilation of the knowledge of a dying galactic empire. In reality, Terminus had a much larger role in his Plan, which larger role he had to conceal from its inhabitants at first.

== ''Prelude to Foundation'' ==
Seldon visits Trantor to attend the Decennial Mathematics Convention. He presents a paper which indicates that one could theoretically predict the Galactic Empire's future. He is able to show that Galactic society can be represented in a simulation simpler than itself (in a finite number of iterations before the onset of chaotic noise smears discerning sets of events).&lt;ref name="Asimovprelude"/&gt;{{rp|p. 148}}  He does so using a technique invented that past century. At first, Seldon has no idea how this could be done in practice, and he is fairly confident that no one could actually fulfill the possibility. Shortly after his presentation, he becomes a lightning rod for political forces who want to use psychohistory for their own purposes. The rest of the novel tells of his flight, which lasts for approximately a year and which takes him through the complex and variegated world of Trantor. During his flight to escape the various political factions, he discovers how psychohistory can be made a practical science. It is in this novel that he meets his future wife [[Dors Venabili]], future adopted son [[Raych Seldon]], and future partner [[Yugo Amaryl]].

== ''Forward the Foundation'' ==
This novel is actually told as a sequence of [[short stories]], just as was the case with the original trilogy. They take place at intervals a decade or more apart, and tell the story of Hari's life, starting about ten years after ''[[Prelude to Foundation|Prelude]]'' and ending with his death. The stories contrast his increasingly successful professional life with his increasingly unsuccessful personal life.

Seldon becomes involved in politics when [[R. Daneel Olivaw|Eto Demerzel]] becomes a target for a smear campaign conducted by Laskin Joranum. He eventually takes Demerzel's place as First Minister, despite his reluctance to divide his attention between government and the development of Psychohistory. His career comes to an end when Cleon I is assassinated by his gardener (a random event Seldon could not have predicted) and the seizure of power by a military junta. Seldon eventually causes the fall of the junta by dropping subtle false hints about what Psychohistory foresees, leading to the Junta making unpopular decisions. However, an agent of the Junta inside Seldon's team, having deduced that Dors is a robot, builds a device that ultimately kills her, leaving Seldon heartbroken. Years later, Seldon discovers that his granddaughter Wanda has telepathic abilities and begins searching for others like her but fails. Raych eventually decides to move his family to the planet Santanni, but Wanda chooses to remain with her elderly grandfather. However, just after they arrive a rebellion breaks out on the planet and Raych is killed in the fighting. His wife and child are lost when their ship disappears. Seldon eventually finds Stettin Palver, another telepath who becomes Wanda's husband and the pair are eventually instrumental in creating the Second Foundation.

Seldon mentions two indigenous species of Helicon: the lamec and the greti. The first is a hardworking animal, while the latter is dangerous as indicated by the native Helicon saying "If you ride a greti, you find you can't get off; for then it will eat you."  The saying is similar to the age-old Chinese proverb "He who rides the tiger finds it difficult to dismount" (騎虎難下), and the words ''lamec'' and ''greti'' are anagrams of ''camel'' and ''tiger'', respectively.

In his old age, he gains the nickname ''Raven'' for his dire predictions of the future.

==Contemporary influence==
Although Hari Seldon was a fictional character, he has had an effect on contemporary thinkers.  Historian [[Ian Morris (historian)|Ian Morris]] has discussed the applicability and inspiration of Hari Seldon to statistics and prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Ian|title=Why the West rules-- for now : the patterns of history, and what they reveal about the future|date=2010|isbn=9781551995816|page=581}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hari Seldon's name is cited in an article in ''The Economist'' discussing the use of statistics in [[epidemiology]], the process through which societies change collective political thinking, and "a general computer model of society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Seldon, I Presume?|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21572159-data-social-networks-are-making-social-science-more-scientific-dr-seldon-i|publisher=The Economist|date=Feb 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is speculation in ''Forbes'' that Seldon's psychohistory is being manifested in today's emergence of [[Big Data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pinn|first1=Phil|title=Big Data: Is It Straight Out Of Sci-Fi?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gyro/2013/08/06/big-data-is-it-straight-out-of-sci-fi/#3ca7b0c45c4e|website=Gyro|publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the fictional character of Seldon has even been labeled as a "paradigmatic figure" in Big Data research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boellstorff|first1=Tom|title=Making big data, in theory|journal=First Monday|date=October 7, 2013|volume=18|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seldon is quite often named in research as a metaphorical literary reference point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaddis|first1=John Lewis|title=International Relations Theory and the End of the Cold War|journal=International Security|date=Winter 1992–1993|volume=17|issue=3|pages=5–58|doi=10.2307/2539129|publisher=The MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phillips|first1=Nelson|last2=Zyglidopoulos|first2=Stelios|title=Learning from Foundation: Asimov's Psychohistory and the Limits of Organization Theory|journal=Organization|date=November 1999|volume=6|issue=4|pages=591–608|doi=10.1177/135050849964002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People that give credit to Hari Seldon for career choices they made include economist and ''New York Times'' columnist [[Paul Krugman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Larissa MacFarquhar]]|title=The Deflationist|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/03/01/the-deflationist|website=The New Yorker|date=March 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Newt Gingrich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lizza|first1=Ryan|title=When Newt met Hari Seldon|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/when-newt-met-hari-seldon|website=The New Yorker|date=December 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9011">In [[mathematics]], the '''Hartley transform''' ('''HT''') is an [[integral transform]] closely related to the [[Fourier transform]] (FT), but which transforms real-valued functions to real-valued functions. It was proposed as an alternative to the Fourier transform by [[Ralph V. L. Hartley]] in 1942,&lt;ref name="Hartley_1942"/&gt; and is one of many known [[Fourier-related transform]]s. Compared to the Fourier transform, the Hartley transform has the advantages of transforming [[real number|real]] functions to real functions (as opposed to requiring [[complex number]]s) and of being its own inverse.

The discrete version of the transform, the [[discrete Hartley transform]] (DHT), was introduced by [[Ronald N. Bracewell]] in 1983.&lt;ref name="Bracewell_1983"/&gt;

The two-dimensional Hartley transform can be computed by an analog optical process similar to an [[optical Fourier transform]] (OFT), with the proposed advantage that only its amplitude and sign need to be determined rather than its complex phase.&lt;ref name="Villasenor_1994"/&gt; However, optical Hartley transforms&lt;!-- apparently NOT abbreviated as OHT, as OHT used for something else --&gt; do not seem to have seen widespread use.

==Definition==
The Hartley transform of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f''(''t'') is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;
H(\omega) = \left\{\mathcal{H}f\right\}(\omega) =  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^\infty
f(t) \operatorname{cas}(\omega t) \, \mathrm{d}t,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; can in applications be an [[angular frequency]] and

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{cas}(t) = \cos(t) + \sin(t) = \sqrt{2} \sin (t+\pi /4) = \sqrt{2} \cos (t-\pi /4)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

is the cosine-and-sine or ''Hartley'' kernel. In engineering terms, this transform takes a signal (function) from the time-domain to the Hartley spectral domain (frequency domain).

=== Inverse transform ===
The Hartley transform has the convenient property of being its own inverse (an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]]):

:&lt;math&gt;f = \{\mathcal{H} \{\mathcal{H}f \}\}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Conventions ===

The above is in accord with Hartley's original definition, but (as with the Fourier transform) various minor details are matters of convention and can be changed without altering the essential properties:
*Instead of using the same transform for forward and inverse, one can remove the &lt;math&gt;{1}/{\sqrt{2\pi}}&lt;/math&gt; from the forward transform and use &lt;math&gt;{1}/{2\pi}&lt;/math&gt; for the inverse&amp;mdash;or, indeed, any pair of normalizations whose product is &lt;math&gt;{1}/{2\pi}&lt;/math&gt;. (Such asymmetrical normalizations are sometimes found in both purely mathematical and engineering contexts.)
*One can also use &lt;math&gt;2\pi\nu t&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\omega t&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., frequency instead of angular frequency), in which case the &lt;math&gt;{1}/{\sqrt{2\pi}}&lt;/math&gt; coefficient is omitted entirely.
*One can use cos&amp;minus;sin instead of cos+sin as the kernel.

==Relation to Fourier transform==
This transform differs from the classic Fourier transform 
&lt;math&gt;F(\omega) = \mathcal{F} \{ f(t) \}(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; in the choice of the kernel. In the Fourier transform, we have the exponential kernel:
&lt;math&gt;\exp\left({-i\omega t}\right) = \cos(\omega t) - i \sin(\omega t),&lt;/math&gt;
where ''i'' is the [[imaginary unit]].

The two transforms are closely related, however, and the Fourier transform (assuming it uses the same &lt;math&gt;1/\sqrt{2\pi}&lt;/math&gt; normalization convention) can be computed from the Hartley transform via:

:&lt;math&gt;F(\omega) = \frac{H(\omega) + H(-\omega)}{2} - i \frac{H(\omega) - H(-\omega)}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the real and imaginary parts of the Fourier transform are simply given by the [[even and odd functions|even and odd]] parts of the Hartley transform, respectively.

Conversely, for real-valued functions ''f''(''t''), the Hartley transform is given from the Fourier transform's real and imaginary parts:

:&lt;math&gt;\{ \mathcal{H} f \} = \Re \{ \mathcal{F}f \} - \Im \{ \mathcal{F}f \} = \Re \{ \mathcal{F}f \cdot (1+i) \}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Re&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Im&lt;/math&gt; denote the real and imaginary parts of the complex Fourier transform.

== Properties ==
The Hartley transform is a real [[linear operator]], and is [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]] (and [[Hermitian operator|Hermitian]]).  From the symmetric and self-inverse properties, it follows that the transform is a [[unitary operator]] (indeed, [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal]]).

There is also an analogue of the [[convolution theorem]] for the Hartley transform. If two functions &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt; have Hartley transforms &lt;math&gt;X(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y(\omega)&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, then their [[convolution]] &lt;math&gt;z(t) = x * y&lt;/math&gt; has the Hartley transform{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}:

:&lt;math&gt;Z(\omega) = \{ \mathcal{H} (x * y) \} = \sqrt{2\pi} \left( X(\omega) \left[ Y(\omega) + Y(-\omega) \right]
                         + X(-\omega) \left[ Y(\omega) - Y(-\omega) \right] \right) / 2.&lt;/math&gt;

Similar to the Fourier transform, the Hartley transform of an even/odd function is even/odd, respectively.

The properties of the ''Hartley kernel'', for which Hartley introduced the name ''cas'' function (from ''cosine and sine'') in 1942,&lt;ref name="Hartley_1942"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bracewell_1999"/&gt; follow directly from [[trigonometry]], and its definition as a phase-shifted trigonometric function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{cas}(t)=\sqrt{2} \sin (t+\pi /4)&lt;/math&gt;. For example, it has an angle-addition identity of:

:&lt;math&gt;
2 \operatorname{cas} (a+b) = \operatorname{cas}(a) \operatorname{cas}(b) + \operatorname{cas}(-a) \operatorname{cas}(b) + \operatorname{cas}(a) \operatorname{cas}(-b) - \operatorname{cas}(-a) \operatorname{cas}(-b). \,
&lt;/math&gt;

Additionally:

:&lt;math&gt; 
\operatorname{cas} (a+b) = {\cos (a) \operatorname{cas} (b)} + {\sin (a) \operatorname{cas} (-b)} = \cos (b) \operatorname{cas} (a) + \sin (b) \operatorname{cas}(-a) \,
&lt;/math&gt;

and its derivative is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{cas}'(a) = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}a} \operatorname{cas} (a) = \cos (a) - \sin (a) = \operatorname{cas}(-a).
&lt;/math&gt;

A '''hierarchical query''' is a type of [[Select (SQL)|SQL query]] that handles [[hierarchical model]] data. They are special cases of more general recursive fixpoint queries, which compute [[transitive closure]]s.

In standard [[SQL:1999]] hierarchical queries are implemented by way of recursive ''[[#Common table expression|common table expressions]]'' (CTEs). Unlike Oracle's earlier [[#CONNECT BY|connect-by clause]], recursive CTEs were designed with [[fixpoint]] semantics from the beginning.&lt;ref name="JimMelton1"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jim Melton|author2=Alan R. Simon|title=SQL:1999: Understanding Relational Language Components|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wyhXvU0Eyg0C&amp;pg=PA352|year=2002|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-1-55860-456-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recursive CTEs from the standard were relatively close to the existing implementation in [[IBM DB2]] version 2.&lt;ref name="JimMelton1"/&gt; Recursive CTEs are also supported by [[Microsoft SQL Server]] (since SQL Server 2008 R2),&lt;ref name="msdnRCTEs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms186243.aspx |title=Recursive Queries Using Common Table Expressions |author=Microsoft |accessdate=2009-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Firebird (database server)|Firebird 2.1]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://firebirdsql.org/rlsnotesh/rlsnotes210.html#rnfb210-cte |title=Firebird 2.1 Release Notes |author=Helen Borrie |date=2008-07-15 |accessdate=2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PostgreSQL|PostgreSQL 8.4+]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/queries-with.html |title=WITH Queries}} PostgreSQL&lt;/ref&gt; [[SQLite|SQLite 3.8.3+]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sqlite.org/lang_with.html |title=WITH Clause}} SQLite&lt;/ref&gt; [[IBM Informix]] version 11.50+, [[CUBRID]] and [[MySQL|MySQL 8.0.1+]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mysqlserverteam.com/mysql-8-0-labs-recursive-common-table-expressions-in-mysql-ctes/ |title=MySQL 8.0 Labs: [Recursive] Common Table Expressions in MySQL (CTEs)}} mysqlserverteam.com&lt;/ref&gt;. Tableau and TIBCO Spotfire do not support CTEs, while Oracle 11g Release 2's implementation lacks fixpoint semantics.

Without common table expressions or connected-by clauses it is possible to achieve hierarchical queries with user-defined recursive functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paragoncorporation.com/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=24 Paragon corporation: Using PostgreSQL User-Defined Functions to solve the Tree Problem], February 15, 2004, accessed September 19, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common table expression ==
{{expand section|date=November 2012}}
A common table expression, or CTE, (in [[SQL]]) is a temporary named result set, derived from a simple query and defined within the execution scope of a &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;INSERT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;UPDATE&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;DELETE&lt;/code&gt; statement.

CTEs can be thought of as alternatives to derived tables ([[subquery]]), [[view (database)|views]], and inline user-defined functions.

Common table expressions are supported by [[Teradata]], [[IBM DB2|DB2]], [[Firebird (database server)|Firebird]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Comparison of relational database management systems#Database capabilities]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft SQL Server]], [[Oracle Database|Oracle]] (with recursion since 11g release 2), [[PostgreSQL]] (since 8.4), [[MariaDB]] (since 10.2), [[MySQL]] (since 8.0), [[SQLite]] (since 3.8.3), [[HSQLDB|HyperSQL]] and [[H2 (DBMS)|H2]] (experimental).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.h2database.com/html/advanced.html#recursive_queries&lt;/ref&gt; Oracle calls CTEs "subquery factoring".&lt;ref name="MortonSands2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Karen Morton|author2=Robyn Sands|author3=Jared Still|author4=Riyaj Shamsudeen |author5=Kerry Osborne|title=Pro Oracle SQL|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nrwu-f4JwjcC&amp;pg=PA283|year=2010|publisher=Apress|isbn=978-1-4302-3228-5|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The syntax for a recursive CTE is as follows:

&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
WITH [RECURSIVE] with_query [, ...]
SELECT...
&lt;/source&gt;

where &lt;code&gt;with_query&lt;/code&gt;‘s syntax is:

&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
query_name [ (column_name [,...]) ] AS (SELECT ...)
&lt;/source&gt;

Recursive CTEs (or "recursive subquery factoring"&lt;ref name="MortonSands2010b"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Karen Morton|author2=Robyn Sands|author3=Jared Still|author4=Riyaj Shamsudeen |author5=Kerry Osborne|title=Pro Oracle SQL|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nrwu-f4JwjcC&amp;pg=PA304|year=2010|publisher=Apress|isbn=978-1-4302-3228-5|page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Oracle jargon) can be used to traverse relations (as graphs or trees) although the syntax is much more involved because there are no automatic pseudo-columns created (like &lt;code&gt;LEVEL&lt;/code&gt; above); if these are desired, they have to be created in the code. See MSDN documentation&lt;ref name="msdnRCTEs"/&gt; or IBM documentation&lt;ref&gt;http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/dzichelp/v2r2/topic/com.ibm.db2z9.doc.apsg/src/tpc/db2z_xmprecursivecte.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/iseries/v5r4/index.jsp?topic=%2Fsqlp%2Frbafyrecursivequeries.htm&lt;/ref&gt; for tutorial examples.

The &lt;code&gt;RECURSIVE&lt;/code&gt; keyword is not usually needed after WITH in systems other than PostgreSQL.&lt;ref name="ObeHsu2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Regina Obe|author2=Leo Hsu|title=PostgreSQL: Up and Running|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8jkIZkMTPcC&amp;pg=PA94|year=2012|publisher=O'Reilly Media|isbn=978-1-4493-2633-3|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In SQL:1999 a recursive (CTE) query may appear anywhere a query is allowed. It's possible, for example, to name the result using &lt;code&gt;CREATE&lt;/code&gt; [&lt;code&gt;RECURSIVE&lt;/code&gt;] &lt;code&gt;VIEW&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jim Melton|author2=Alan R. Simon|title=SQL:1999: Understanding Relational Language Components|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wyhXvU0Eyg0C&amp;pg=PA352|year=2002|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-1-55860-456-8|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a CTE inside an &lt;code&gt;INSERT INTO&lt;/code&gt;, one can populate a table with data generated from a recursive query; random data generation is possible using this technique without using any procedural statements.&lt;ref name="ChamberlinChamberlin1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Don Chamberlin|title=A Complete Guide to DB2 Universal Database|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hb4zskzHrWYC&amp;pg=PA253|year=1998|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-1-55860-482-7|pages=253–254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Databases, like PostgreSQL, support a shorter CREATE RECURSIVE VIEW format which is internally translated into WITH RECURSIVE coding.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/sql-createview.html&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a recursive query computing the [[factorial]] of numbers from 0 to 9 is the following:
&lt;source lang=sql&gt;
WITH RECURSIVE temp (n, fact) AS 
(SELECT 0, 1 -- Initial Subquery
  UNION ALL 
 SELECT n+1, (n+1)*fact FROM temp -- Recursive Subquery 
        WHERE n &lt; 9)
SELECT * FROM temp;
&lt;/source&gt;

== CONNECT BY ==

An alternative syntax is the non-standard &lt;code&gt;CONNECT BY&lt;/code&gt; construct; it was introduced by Oracle in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Oracle 10g, the construct was only useful for traversing acyclic graphs because it returned an error on detecting any cycles; in version 10g Oracle introduced the NOCYCLE feature (and keyword), making the traversal work in the presence of cycles as well.&lt;ref name="MishraBeaulieu2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sanjay Mishra|author2=Alan Beaulieu|title=Mastering Oracle SQL|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r5vbGgz7TFsC&amp;pg=PT227|year=2004|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|isbn=978-0-596-00632-7|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;code&gt;CONNECT BY&lt;/code&gt; is supported by [[EnterpriseDB]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enterprisedb.com/documentation/hierarchical-queries.html Hierarchical Queries], EnterpriseDB&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oracle database]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/queries003.htm Hierarchical Queries], Oracle&lt;/ref&gt; [[CUBRID]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CUBRID Hierarchical Query|url=http://www.cubrid.org/manual/841/en/Hierarchical%20Query|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IBM Informix]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGU8G_12.1.0/com.ibm.sqls.doc/ids_sqs_2033.htm Hierarchical Clause], IBM Informix&lt;/ref&gt; and [[IBM DB2|DB2]] although only if it is enabled as a compatibility mode.&lt;ref name="Gennick2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Gennick|title=SQL Pocket Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rEAFRzMe_SMC&amp;pg=PA8|year=2010|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4493-9409-7|page=8|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The syntax is as follows:

&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
 SELECT select_list
 FROM table_expression
 [ WHERE ... ]
 [ START WITH start_expression ]
 CONNECT BY [NOCYCLE] { PRIOR child_expr = parent_expr | parent_expr = PRIOR child_expr }
 [ ORDER SIBLINGS BY column1 [ ASC | DESC ] [, column2 [ ASC | DESC ] ] ...
 [ GROUP BY ... ]
 [ HAVING ... ]
 ...
&lt;/source&gt;

;For example,

&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
 SELECT LEVEL, LPAD (' ', 2 * (LEVEL - 1)) || ename "employee", empno, mgr "manager"
 FROM emp START WITH mgr IS NULL
 CONNECT BY PRIOR empno = mgr;

&lt;/source&gt;

The output from the above query would look like:

  level |  employee   | empno | manager
 -------+-------------+-------+---------
      1 | KING        |  7839 |
      2 |   JONES     |  7566 |    7839

* &lt;tt&gt;CONNECT_BY_ISCYCLE&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;CONNECT_BY_ROOT&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Unary operators ===
The following example returns the last name of each employee in department 10, each manager above that employee in the hierarchy, the number of levels between manager and employee, and the path between the two:

&lt;source lang="oracle11"&gt;
   SELECT ename "Employee", CONNECT_BY_ROOT ename "Manager",
   LEVEL-1 "Pathlen", SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH(ename, '/') "Path"
   FROM emp
   WHERE LEVEL &gt; 1 and deptno = 10
   CONNECT BY PRIOR empno = mgr
   ORDER BY "Employee", "Manager", "Pathlen", "Path";
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Image:Hofstadter's butterfly.png|thumb|Hofstadter's butterfly]]
In [[physics]], '''Hofstadter's butterfly''' is a mathematical object describing the theorised behaviour of [[electron]]s in a [[magnetic field]], discovered  in 1976 by [[Douglas Hofstadter]]. It takes its name from its visual resemblance to a [[butterfly]]. It is a [[fractal]] structure and as such it shows [[self-similarity]], meaning that small fragments of the structure contain a (distorted) copy of the entire structure. It is one of the rare non-random fractal structures discovered in [[physics]], along with [[Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem|KAM theorem]].
A central concern in Hofstadter's paper is how the two distinct behaviours predicted for 'rational' and 'irrational' magnetic fields must be unified in the continuous physical world.

To test whether Hofstadter's butterfly describes real electron behaviour requires accurate measurements. Such were not possible when he wrote his paper. However, more recent experimental research has confirmed the characteristic butterfly shape.

== Background ==

Hofstadter described the structure in 1976 in an article on the [[energy level]]s of [[Bloch electron]]s in magnetic fields.&lt;ref name="energylevels"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hofstadter |first=Douglas R. |author-link=Douglas R. Hofstadter |date=1976 |title=Energy levels and wavefunctions of Bloch electrons in rational and irrational magnetic fields |journal=[[Physical Review B]] |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=2239–2249 |bibcode=1976PhRvB..14.2239H |doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.14.2239}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gives a graphical representation of the spectrum of the [[almost Mathieu operator]] for &lt;math&gt;\lambda = 1&lt;/math&gt; at different frequencies. The intricate mathematical structure of this spectrum was discovered by Soviet physicist Mark Ya. Azbel' in 1964.&lt;ref name="Azbel"&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Azbel' |first=Mark Ya. |date=1964 |title=Energy Spectrum of a Conduction Electron in a Magnetic Field |url=http://www.jetp.ac.ru/cgi-bin/e/index/e/19/3/p634?a=list |journal=[[Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics]] |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=634–645}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Azbel' did not plot the structure as a geometrical object.

Written while Hofstadter was at the [[University of Oregon]], his paper was influential in directing further research. Hofstadter predicted on theoretical grounds that the allowed energy level values of an electron in a two-dimensional [[square lattice]], as a function of a magnetic field applied to the system, formed what is now known as a [[fractal set]]. That is, the distribution of energy levels for small scale changes in the applied magnetic field [[recursively]] repeat [[pattern]]s seen in the large-scale structure.&lt;ref name="energylevels" /&gt; "Gplot", as Hofstadter called the figure, was described as a [[recursive structure]] in his 1976 article in ''[[Physical Review B]]'',&lt;ref name="energylevels" /&gt; written before [[Benoit Mandelbrot]]'s newly coined word "fractal" was introduced in an English text. Hofstadter also discusses the figure in his 1979 book ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]''. The structure became generally known as "Hofstadter's butterfly".

In 1997 the Hofstadter butterfly was reproduced in experiments with microwave guide equipped by an array of scatterers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kuhl |first=U. |last2=Stöckmann |first2=H.-J. |date=13 April 1998 |title=Microwave realization of the Hofstadter butterfly |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=80 |issue=15 |pages=3232–3235 |bibcode=1998PhRvL..80.3232K |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.80.3232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarity of the mathematical description of the microwave guide with scatterers and of Bloch's waves in magnetic field allowed to reproduce the Hofstadter butterfly for periodic sequences of the scatterers.

In 2013, three separate groups of researchers independently reported evidence of the Hofstadter butterfly spectrum in [[graphene]] devices fabricated on hexagonal [[boron nitride]] substrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dean |first=C.

In [[mathematics]], '''hyperbolic space''' is a [[homogeneous space]] that has a [[constant function|constant]] negative [[Constant curvature|curvature]], where in this case the curvature is the sectional curvature.
It is [[hyperbolic geometry]] in more than 2 [[dimension (mathematics)|dimensions]], and is distinguished from [[Euclidean space]]s with [[zero]] curvature that define the [[Euclidean geometry]], and [[elliptic geometry]] that have a constant positive curvature.

When embedded to a Euclidean space (of a higher dimension), every point of a hyperbolic space is a [[saddle point]]. Another distinctive property is the [[Riemannian volume form|amount of space]] covered by the [[n-ball|''n''-ball]] in hyperbolic ''n''-space: it increases [[exponential growth|exponentially]] with respect to the radius of the ball for large radii, rather than polynomially.

==Formal definition==
'''Hyperbolic ''n''-space''', denoted '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, is the maximally symmetric, [[simply connected]], ''n''-dimensional [[Riemannian manifold]] with a constant negative [[sectional curvature]]. 
Hyperbolic space is a space exhibiting [[hyperbolic geometry]]. 
It is the negative-curvature analogue of the ''n''-[[sphere]].  Although hyperbolic space '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is [[diffeomorphic]] to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, its negative-curvature metric gives it very different geometric properties.

Hyperbolic 2-space, '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, is also called the [[hyperbolic plane]].

==Models of hyperbolic space==
Hyperbolic space, developed independently by [[Nikolai Lobachevsky]] and [[János Bolyai]], is a geometrical space analogous to [[Euclidean space]], but such that [[parallel postulate|Euclid's parallel postulate]] is no longer assumed to hold.  Instead, the parallel postulate is replaced by the following alternative (in two dimensions):
* Given any line ''L'' and point ''P'' not on ''L'', there are at least two distinct lines passing through ''P'' which do not intersect ''L''.
It is then a theorem that there are infinitely many such lines through ''P''. This axiom still does not uniquely characterize the hyperbolic plane up to [[isometry]]; there is an extra constant, the curvature {{nowrap|''K'' &lt; 0}},  which must be specified. However, it does uniquely characterize it up to [[Homothetic transformation|homothety]], meaning up to bijections which only change the notion of distance by an overall constant. By choosing an appropriate length scale, one can thus assume, without loss of generality, that {{nowrap|1=''K'' = −1}}.

Models of hyperbolic spaces that can be embedded in a flat (e.g. Euclidean) spaces may be constructed.  In particular, the existence of model spaces implies that the parallel postulate is [[logically independent]] of the other axioms of Euclidean geometry.

There are several important models of hyperbolic space: the '''Klein model''', the '''hyperboloid model''', the '''Poincaré ball model''' and the '''Poincaré half space model'''.  These all model the same geometry in the sense that any two of them can be related by a transformation that preserves all the geometrical properties of the space, including [[isometry]] (though not with respect to the metric of a Euclidean embedding).

===The hyperboloid model===
{{main|Hyperboloid model}}
The hyperboloid model realizes hyperbolic space as a hyperboloid in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; = {(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;∈'''R''',&amp;nbsp;''i''=0,1,...,''n''}.  The hyperboloid is the locus '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; of points whose coordinates satisfy
:&lt;math&gt;x_0^2-x_1^2-\cdots-x_n^2=1,\quad x_0&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;
In this model a ''line'' (or [[geodesic]]) is the curve formed by the intersection of '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with a plane through the origin in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;.

The hyperboloid model is closely related to the geometry of [[Minkowski space]].  The [[quadratic form]]
:&lt;math&gt;Q(x) = x_0^2 - x_1^2 - x_2^2 - \cdots - x_n^2 ,&lt;/math&gt;
which defines the hyperboloid, [[polarization identity|polarizes]] to give the [[bilinear form]]
:&lt;math&gt;B(x,y) = (Q(x+y)-Q(x)-Q(y))/2=x_0y_0 - x_1y_1 - \cdots - x_n y_n .&lt;/math&gt;
The space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;, equipped with the bilinear form ''B'', is an (''n''+1)-dimensional Minkowski space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n'',1&lt;/sup&gt;.

One can associate a ''distance'' on the hyperboloid model by defining&lt;ref&gt;Note the similarity with the [[Elliptic geometry|chordal metric]] on a sphere, which uses trigonometric instead of hyperbolic functions.&lt;/ref&gt; the distance between two points ''x'' and ''y'' on '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to be
:&lt;math&gt;d(x, y) = \operatorname{arcosh} B(x,y) .&lt;/math&gt;
This function satisfies the axioms of a [[metric space]].  It is preserved by the action of the [[Lorentz group]] on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n'',1&lt;/sup&gt;.  Hence the Lorentz group acts as a [[transformation group]] preserving [[isometry]] on '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

===The Klein model===
{{main|Klein model}}
An alternative model of hyperbolic geometry is on a certain [[open set|domain]] in [[projective space]].  The Minkowski quadratic form ''Q'' defines a subset {{nowrap|''U''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ⊂ '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} given as the locus of points for which {{nowrap|''Q''(''x'') &gt; 0}} in the [[homogeneous coordinates]] ''x''.  The domain ''U''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is the '''Klein model''' of hyperbolic space.

The lines of this model are the open line segments of the ambient projective space which lie in ''U''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  The distance between two points ''x'' and ''y'' in ''U''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;d(x, y) = \operatorname{arcosh}\left(\frac{B(x,y)}{\sqrt{Q(x)Q(y)}}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
This is well-defined on projective space, since the ratio under the inverse hyperbolic cosine is homogeneous of degree 0.

This model is related to the hyperboloid model as follows.  Each point {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''U''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} corresponds to a line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; through the origin in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;, by the definition of projective space.  This line intersects the hyperboloid '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; in a unique point.  Conversely, through any point on '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, there passes a unique line through the origin (which is a point in the projective space).   This correspondence defines a [[bijection]] between ''U''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  It is an isometry, since evaluating {{nowrap|''d''(''x'',''y'')}} along {{nowrap|1=''Q''(''x'') = ''Q''(''y'') = 1}} reproduces the definition of the distance given for the hyperboloid model.

===The Poincaré ball model ===
{{main|Poincaré disc model}}

A closely related pair of models of hyperbolic geometry are the Poincaré ball and Poincaré half-space models.

The ball model comes from a [[stereographic projection]] of the hyperboloid in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; onto the hyperplane {''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}. In detail, let ''S'' be the point in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n'',1&lt;/sup&gt;  with coordinates (−1,0,0,...,0): the ''South pole'' for the stereographic projection.   For each point ''P'' on the hyperboloid '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, let ''P''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; be the unique point of intersection of the line ''SP'' with the plane {''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}.

This establishes a bijective mapping of '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; into the unit ball
:&lt;math&gt; B^n = \{(x_1,\ldots,x_n) | x_1^2+\cdots+x_n^2 &lt; 1\}&lt;/math&gt;
in the plane {''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}.

The geodesics in this model are [[semicircle]]s that are perpendicular to the boundary sphere of ''B''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Isometries of the ball are generated by [[inversive geometry|spherical inversion]] in hyperspheres perpendicular to the boundary.

===The Poincaré half-space model ===
{{main|Poincaré half-plane model}}

The half-space model results from applying [[inversion in a circle]] with centre a boundary point of the Poincaré ball model ''B''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; above and a radius of twice the radius.

This sends circles to circles and lines, and is moreover a [[conformal transformation]].  Consequently, the geodesics of the half-space model are lines and circles perpendicular to the boundary hyperplane.

==Hyperbolic manifolds==

Every [[complete space|complete]], [[connected space|connected]], [[simply connected]] manifold of constant negative curvature &amp;minus;1 is [[Isometry|isometric]] to the real hyperbolic space '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. As a result, the [[universal cover]] of any [[closed manifold]] ''M'' of constant negative curvature &amp;minus;1, which is to say, a [[hyperbolic manifold]], is  '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus, every such ''M'' can be written as '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;/Γ where Γ is a [[torsion (algebra)|torsion-free]] [[discrete group]] of [[isometry|isometries]] on '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  That is, Γ is a [[lattice (discrete subgroup)|lattice]] in [[Indefinite orthogonal group|SO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'',1)]].

=== Riemann surfaces ===
Two-dimensional hyperbolic surfaces can also be understood according to the language of [[Riemann surface]]s. According to the [[uniformization theorem]], every Riemann surface is either elliptic, parabolic or hyperbolic. Most hyperbolic surfaces have a non-trivial [[fundamental group]] π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=Γ; the groups that arise this way are known as [[Fuchsian group]]s. The [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] '''H'''²/Γ of the upper half-plane [[Ideal (ring theory)|modulo]] the fundamental group is known as the [[Fuchsian model]] of the hyperbolic surface. The [[Poincaré half plane]] is also hyperbolic, but is [[simply connected]] and [[noncompact]]. It is the [[universal cover]] of the other hyperbolic surfaces.

The analogous construction for three-dimensional hyperbolic surfaces is the [[Kleinian model]].

'''Inductive reasoning''' is a [[method of reasoning]] in which the [[premise]]s are viewed as supplying some evidence for the truth of the conclusion (in contrast to [[Deductive reasoning|''deductive'' reasoning]] and [[abductive reasoning|''abductive'' reasoning]]). While the conclusion of a deductive argument is certain, the truth of the conclusion of an inductive argument may be ''[[probable]]'', based upon the evidence given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Copi |first=I. M. |last2=Cohen |first2=C. |last3=Flage |first3=D. E. |year=2006 |title=Essentials of Logic |edition=Second |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |publisher=Pearson Education |isbn=978-0-13-238034-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many dictionaries define inductive reasoning as the derivation of general principles from specific observations, though some sources find this usage "outdated".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Comparison with deductive reasoning==
[[File:Argument terminology used in logic.png|thumb|400px|Argument terminology]]
Unlike deductive arguments, inductive reasoning allows for the possibility that the conclusion is false, even if all of the [[premise]]s are true.&lt;ref&gt;John Vickers.

The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of being valid or invalid, inductive arguments are either ''strong'' or ''weak'', which describes how ''probable'' it is that the conclusion is true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~bio125/logic.Giere.pdf | title = Logical Basis of Hypothesis Testing in Scientific Research | last = Herms | first = D. | format = pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another crucial difference is that deductive certainty is impossible in non-axiomatic systems, such as [[reality]], leaving inductive reasoning as the primary route to (probabilistic) knowledge of such systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-reason/#TheReaReaCogRolLim | title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy : Kant's account of reason }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that "if ''A'' is true then that would cause ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' to be true", an example of deduction would be "''A'' is true therefore we can deduce that ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' are true". An example of induction would be "''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' are observed to be true therefore ''A'' might be true". ''A'' is a [[Causality|reasonable]] explanation for ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' being true.

For example:
:A large enough asteroid impact would create a very large crater and cause a severe [[impact winter]] that could drive the non-avian dinosaurs to extinction.
:We observe that there is a [[Chicxulub crater|very large crater]] in the Gulf of Mexico dating to very near the time of the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs
:Therefore it is possible that this impact could explain why the non-avian dinosaurs became extinct.
Note however that this is not necessarily the case. Other events with the potential to affect global climate also coincide with the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. For example, the release of [[volcanic gas]]es (particularly [[sulfur dioxide]]) during the formation of the [[Deccan Traps]] in India.

A classical example of an ''incorrect'' inductive argument was presented by John Vickers:
: All of the swans we have seen are white.
: Therefore, we know that all swans are white.

The correct conclusion would be, "We [[Expectation (epistemic)|expect]] that all swans are white".

The definition of ''inductive'' reasoning described in this article excludes [[mathematical induction]], which is a form of ''deductive'' reasoning that is used to strictly prove properties of recursively defined sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chowdhry|first1=K.R.|title=Fundamentals of Discrete Mathematical Structures|date=January 2, 2015|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|page=26|edition=3rd|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MmVwBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=%22mathematical+induction%22+deduction#v=onepage&amp;q=%22mathematical%20induction%22%20deduction&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 December 2016|isbn=9788120350748}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deductive nature of mathematical induction is based on the non-finite number of cases involved when using mathematical induction, in contrast with the finite number of cases involved in an enumerative induction procedure with a finite number of cases like [[proof by exhaustion]]. Both mathematical induction and proof by exhaustion are examples of [[complete induction]]. Complete induction is a type of masked deductive reasoning.

An argument is deductive when the conclusion is necessary given the premises. That is, the conclusion cannot be false if the premises are true.

If a deductive conclusion follows duly from its premises then it is valid; otherwise it is invalid (that an argument is invalid is not to say it is false. It may have a true conclusion, just not on account of the premises). An examination of the above examples will show that the relationship between premises and conclusion is such that the truth of the conclusion is already implicit in the premises. Bachelors are unmarried because we ''say'' they are; we have defined them so. Socrates is mortal because we have included him in a set of beings that are mortal.

For inductive reasoning the premises or prior data provide support for the conclusion, but they do not guarantee it. The result is a conclusion having, it is often said, a “degree of certainty.” The phrase is not optimal since certainty is absolute and does not come in degrees; what is really meant is degrees approaching certainty. Succinctly put: deduction is about certainty/necessity; induction is about ''probability''.&lt;ref&gt; Introduction to Logic. Harry J. Gensler, Rutledge, 2002. P. 268&lt;/ref&gt; This is the best way to understand and remember the difference between inductive vs. deductive reasoning. Any single assertion will answer to one of these two criteria. (There is also [[modal logic]], which deals with the distinction between the necessary and the  ''possible'' in a way not concerned with probabilities among things deemed possible.)

The philosophical definition of inductive reasoning is more nuanced than simple progression from particular/individual instances to broader generalizations. Rather, the premises of an inductive [[logical argument]] indicate some degree of support (inductive probability) for the conclusion but do not [[entailment|entail]] it; that is, they suggest truth but do not ensure it. In this manner, there is the possibility of moving from general statements to individual instances (for example, statistical syllogisms, discussed below).

==History==
===Ancient philosophy===
For a move from particular to universal, [[Aristotle]] in the 300s BCE used the Greek word ''epagogé'', which [[Cicero]] translated into the Latin word ''inductio''.&lt;ref name=Gattei&gt;Stefano Gattei, ''Karl Popper's Philosophy of Science: Rationality without Foundations'' (New York: [[Routledge]], 2009), ch. 2 "Science and philosophy", [https://books.google.com/books?id=oPPu1JvMBFoC&amp;pg=PA28#v=twopage pp 28–30].&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 300s [[Common Era|CE]], [[Sextus Empiricus]] maintained that all knowledge derives from sensory experience—concluded in his ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'' that acceptance of universal statements as true cannot be justified by induction.&lt;ref name=Gattei/&gt;

===Early modern philosophy===
In 1620, [[Early modern philosophy|early modern philosopher]] [[Francis Bacon]] repudiated mere experience and enumerative induction, and sought to couple those with neutral and minute and many varied observations before {{explain|date=April 2018}} to uncover the natural world's structure and causal relations beyond the present scope of experience via his method of [[inductivism]], which nonetheless required enumerative induction as a component.

The supposedly radical empiricist [[David Hume]]'s 1740 stance found enumerative induction to have no rational, let alone logical, basis but to be a custom of the mind and an everyday requirement to live, although observations could be coupled with the principle [[Uniformitarianism|uniformity of nature]]—another logically invalid conclusion, thus the [[problem of induction]]—to seemingly justify enumerative induction and reason toward unobservables, including causality [[counterfactual]]ly,  simply that {{explain|date=April 2018}} modifying such an aspect prevents or produces such outcome.

Awakened from "dogmatic slumber" by a German translation of Hume's work, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] sought to explain the possibility of [[metaphysics]].  In 1781, Kant's ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' introduced the distinction ''[[rationalism]]'', a path toward knowledge distinct from ''[[empiricism]]''.  Kant sorted statements into two types.  The [[analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic]] are true by virtue of their terms' [[syntax|arrangement]] and [[semantics|meanings]]—thus are [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], merely logical truths, true by [[logical truth|necessity]]—whereas the [[analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic]] arrange meanings to refer to states of facts, [[contingency (philosophy)|contingencies]].  Finding it impossible to know objects as they truly are in themselves, however, Kant found the philosopher's task not peering behind the veil of appearance to view the ''[[noumena]]'', but simply handling ''[[phenomena]]''.

Reasoning that the mind must contain its own categories organizing [[sense data]], making experience of ''space'' and ''time'' possible, Kant concluded [[Uniformitarianism|uniformity of nature]] ''a priori''.&lt;ref name=Salmon/&gt;  A class of synthetic statements was not [[contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] but true by necessity, then, the [[synthetic a priori|synthetic ''a priori'']].  Kant thus saved both [[metaphysics]] and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], but incidentally discarded [[scientific realism]] and developed [[transcendental idealism]].  Kant's transcendental idealism prompted the trend [[German idealism]].  [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel|G F W Hegel]]'s [[absolute idealism]] flourished across continental Europe and fueled [[nationalism]].

===Late modern philosophy===
Developed by [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]], and promulgated in the 1830s by his former student [[Auguste Comte|Comte]] was [[positivism]], the first [[Late modern philosophy|late modern]] [[philosophy of science]]. In the [[French Revolution]]'s aftermath, fearing society's ruin again, Comte opposed [[metaphysics]]. Human knowledge had evolved from religion to metaphysics to science, said Comte, which had flowed from [[mathematics]] to [[astronomy]] to [[physics]] to [[chemistry]] to [[biology]] to [[sociology]]—in that order—describing increasingly intricate domains, all of society's knowledge having become scientific, as questions of [[theology]] and of [[metaphysics]] were unanswerable. Comte found enumerative induction reliable by its grounding on experience available, and asserted science's use as improving human society, not metaphysical truth.

According to Comte, [[scientific method]] frames predictions, confirms them, and states laws—positive statements—irrefutable by [[theology]] or by [[metaphysics]].  Regarding experience to justify enumerative induction by having shown [[Uniformitarianism|uniformity of nature]],&lt;ref name=Salmon&gt;Wesley C Salmon, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/210401 "The uniformity of Nature"], ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research'', 1953 Sep;'''14'''(1):39–48, p 39.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]] welcomed Comte's positivism, but thought [[scientific laws|laws]] susceptible to recall or revision, and withheld from Comte's [[Religion of Humanity]].  Comte was confident to lay [[scientific law|laws]] as [[foundationalism|irrefutable foundation of other knowledge]], and the churches, honoring eminent scientists, sought to focus public mindset on ''[[altruism]]''—a term Comte coined—to [[applied science|apply science]] for humankind's social welfare via Comte's spearheaded science, [[sociology]].

During the 1830s and 1840s, while [[Auguste Comte|Comte]] and [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]] were the leading philosophers of science, [[William Whewell]] found enumerative induction not nearly so simple, but, amid the dominance of inductivism, described "superinduction".&lt;ref name=Toretti-p220&gt;Roberto Torretti, ''The Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1999), pp [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=PA216&amp;dq=Comte+Mill 216], [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=Whewell+induction+superinduction 219–21].&lt;/ref&gt;  Whewell proposed recognition of "the peculiar import of the term ''Induction''", as "there is some Conception ''superinduced'' upon the facts", that is, "the Invention of a new Conception in every inductive inference". Rarely spotted by Whewell's predecessors, such mental inventions rapidly evade notice.&lt;ref name=Toretti-p220/&gt;  Whewell explained,

{{quote|text="Although we bind together facts by superinducing upon them a new Conception, this Conception, once introduced and applied, is looked upon as inseparably connected with the facts, and necessarily implied in them.  Having once had the phenomena bound together in their minds in virtue of the Conception, men can no longer easily restore them back to detached and incoherent condition in which they were before they were thus combined".&lt;ref name=Toretti-p220/&gt;}}

These "superinduced" explanations may well be flawed, but their accuracy is suggested when they exhibit what Whewell termed ''[[consilience]]''—that is, simultaneously predicting the inductive generalizations in multiple areas—a feat that, according to Whewell, can establish their truth.  Perhaps to accommodate prevailing view of science as inductivist method, Whewell devoted several chapters to "methods of induction" and sometimes said "logic of induction"—and yet stressed it lacks rules and cannot be trained.&lt;ref name=Toretti-p220/&gt;

Originator of [[pragmatism]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C S Peirce]] who, as did [[Gottlob Frege]] independently, in the 1870s performed vast investigations that clarified the basis of [[deductive inference]] as mathematical proof, recognized induction but continuously insisted on a third type of inference that Peirce variously termed ''[[abductive reasoning|abduction]]'' or ''retroduction'' or ''hypothesis'' or ''presumption''.&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Torretti, ''The Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1999), pp [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=Peirce+abduction+deduction+induction 226], [https://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=PA228&amp;dq=Peirce+abduction 228–29].&lt;/ref&gt;  Later philosophers gave Peirce's abduction, ''etc'', the [[synonym]] ''[[inference to the best explanation]]'' (IBE).&lt;ref name=Poston/&gt;

===Contemporary philosophy===
====Bertrand Russell====
Having highlighted Hume's [[problem of induction]], [[John Maynard Keynes]] posed ''logical probability'' as its answer—but then figured not quite.&lt;ref&gt;David Andrews, ''Keynes and the British Humanist Tradition: The Moral Purpose of the Market'' (New York: [[Routledge]], 2010), pp [https://books.google.com/books?id=1VsYOwRsOVUC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=induction+Hume+Keynes+probability 63–65].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bertrand Russell]] found Keynes's ''Treatise on Probability'' the best examination of induction, and if read with Jean Nicod's ''Le Probleme logique de l'induction'' as well as [[R. B. Braithwaite|R B Braithwaite]]'s review of it in the October 1925 issue of ''Mind'', to provide "most of what is known about induction", although the "subject is technical and difficult, involving a good deal of mathematics".&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell, ''The Basic Writings of Bertrand Russell'' (New York: [[Routledge]], 2009), "The validity of inference"], pp 157–64, quote on [https://books.google.com/books?id=jqun5YJGt-wC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=Keynes+induction p 159].&lt;/ref&gt;  Two decades later, [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] proposed enumerative induction as an "independent logical principle".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Landini, ''Russell'' (New York: [[Routledge]], 2011), p [https://books.google.com/books?id=Simvmwn2m2gC&amp;pg=PA230&amp;dq=Russell+principle+induction 230].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Russell1945"/&gt;  Russell found,

{{quote|text="Hume's skepticism rests entirely upon his rejection of the principle of induction.  The principle of induction, as applied to causation, says that, if ''A'' has been found very often accompanied or followed by ''B'', then it is probable that on the next occasion on which ''A'' is observed, it will be accompanied or followed by ''B''.  If the principle is to be adequate, a sufficient number of instances must make the probability not far short of certainty.  If this principle, or any other from which it can be deduced, is true, then the casual inferences which Hume rejects are valid, not indeed as giving certainty, but as giving a sufficient probability for practical purposes.  If this principle is not true, every attempt to arrive at general scientific laws from particular observations is fallacious, and Hume's skepticism is inescapable for an empiricist.  The principle itself cannot, of course, without circularity, be inferred from observed uniformities, since it is required to justify any such inference.  It must therefore be, or be deduced from, an independent principle not based on experience.  To this extent, Hume has proved that pure empiricism is not a sufficient basis for science.  But if this one principle is admitted, everything else can proceed in accordance with the theory that all our knowledge is based on experience.  It must be granted that this is a serious departure from pure empiricism, and that those who are not empiricists may ask why, if one departure is allowed, others are forbidden.  These, however, are not questions directly raised by Hume's arguments.  What these arguments prove—and I do not think the proof can be controverted—is that the induction is an independent logical principle, incapable of being inferred either from experience or from other logical principles, and that without this principle, science is impossible".&lt;ref name="Russell1945"&gt;Bertrand Russell, ''A History of Western Philosophy'' (London: George Allen and Unwin, 1945 / New York: Simon and Schuster, 1945), pp 673-74.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Gilbert Harman====
In a 1965 paper, [[Gilbert Harman]] explained that enumerative induction is not an autonomous phenomenon, but is simply a masked consequence of [[inference to the best explanation]] (IBE).&lt;ref name=Poston&gt;Ted Poston [http://www.iep.utm.edu/found-ep "Foundationalism"], § b "Theories of proper inference", §§ iii "Liberal inductivism", ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', 10 Jun 2010 (last updated): "Strict inductivism is motivated by the thought that we have some kind of inferential knowledge of the world that cannot be accommodated by deductive inference from epistemically [[basic belief]]s.  A fairly recent debate has arisen over the merits of strict inductivism.  Some philosophers have argued that there are other forms of nondeductive inference that do not fit the model of enumerative induction.  [[C. S. Peirce]] describes a form of inference called '[[abductive reasoning|abduction]]' or '[[inference to the best explanation]]'.  This form of inference appeals to explanatory considerations to justify belief.  One infers, for example, that two students copied answers from a third because this is the best explanation of the available data—they each make the same mistakes and the two sat in view of the third.  Alternatively, in a more theoretical context, one infers that there are very small unobservable [[molecules|particles]] because this is the best explanation of [[Brownian motion]].  Let us call 'liberal inductivism' any view that accepts the legitimacy of a form of inference to the best explanation that is distinct from enumerative induction.  For a defense of liberal inductivism, see [[Gilbert Harman]]'s classic (1965) paper.  Harman defends a strong version of liberal inductivism according to which enumerative induction is just a disguised form of [[inference to the best explanation]]".&lt;/ref&gt;  IBE is otherwise synonym to [[C S Peirce]]'s abduction.&lt;ref name=Poston/&gt;  Many [[philosophy of science|philosophers of science]] espousing [[scientific realism]] have maintained that IBE is the way that scientists develop approximately true scientific theories about nature.&lt;ref&gt;Stathis Psillos, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2956303 "On Van Fraassen's critique of abductive reasoning"], ''Philosophical Quarterly'', 1996 Jan;'''46'''(182):31–47, p 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Main|Problem of induction}}

Inductive reasoning has been criticized by thinkers as far back as [[Sextus Empiricus]].&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism''. Trans. [[Robert Gregg Bury|R.G. Bury]], Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; The classic philosophical treatment of the [[problem of induction]] was given by the Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Although the use of inductive reasoning demonstrates considerable success, its application has been questionable. Recognizing this, Hume highlighted the fact that our mind draws uncertain conclusions from relatively limited experiences. In deduction, the truth value of the conclusion is based on the truth of the premise. In induction, however, the dependence on the premise is always uncertain. As an example, let's assume "all ravens are black." The fact that there are numerous black ravens supports the assumption. However, the assumption becomes inconsistent with the fact that there are white ravens. Therefore, the general rule of "all ravens are black" is inconsistent with the existence of the white raven. Hume further argued that it is impossible to justify inductive reasoning: specifically, that it cannot be justified deductively, so our only option is to justify it inductively. Since this is circular he concluded that our use of induction is unjustifiable with the help of [[Hume's Fork]].&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, John. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/#2HumIndJus "The Problem of Induction"] (Section 2). ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. 21 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Hume then stated that even if induction were proved unreliable, we would still have to rely on it. So instead of a position of [[Philosophical skepticism|severe skepticism]], Hume advocated a [[Scientific skepticism|practical skepticism]] based on [[common sense]], where the inevitability of induction is accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, John. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/#IndJus "The Problem of Induction"] (Section 2.1). ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. 21 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bertrand Russell]] illustrated his skepticism in a story about a turkey, fed every morning without fail, who following the laws of induction concludes this will continue, but then his throat is cut on Thanksgiving Day.&lt;ref&gt;The story by Russell is found in Alan Chalmers, ''What is this thing Called Science'', Open University Press, Milton Keynes, 1982, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Popper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Karl R. |last=Popper |first2=David W. |last2=Miller |title=A proof of the impossibility of inductive probability |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=302 |year=1983 |issue=5910 |pages=687–688 |doi=10.1038/302687a0 |bibcode=1983Natur.302..687P }}&lt;/ref&gt; had declared in 1963, "Induction, ''i.e.'' inference based on many observations, is a myth.  It is neither a psychological fact, nor a fact of ordinary life, nor one of scientific procedure".&lt;ref name=Gillies&gt;Donald Gillies, "Problem-solving and the problem of induction", in ''Rethinking Popper'' (Dordrecht: [[Springer (publisher)|Springer]], 2009), Zuzana Parusniková &amp; Robert S Cohen, eds, [https://books.google.com/books?id=R3aywtFIKKsC&amp;pg=PA103#v=twopage pp 103–05].&lt;/ref&gt;  Popper's 1972 book ''Objective Knowledge''—whose first chapter is devoted to the problem of induction—opens, "I think I have solved a major philosophical problem: the [[problem of induction]]".&lt;ref name=Gillies/&gt; Within Popper's schema, enumerative induction is "a kind of optical illusion" cast by the steps of conjecture and refutation during the ''problem shift''.&lt;ref name=Gillies/&gt;  An imaginative leap, the ''tentative solution'' is improvised, lacking inductive rules to guide it.&lt;ref name=Gillies/&gt;  The resulting, unrestricted generalization is deductive, an entailed consequence of all, included explanatory considerations.&lt;ref name=Gillies/&gt;  Controversy continued, however, with Popper's putative solution not generally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Ch 5 "The controversy around inductive logic" in [[Richard Mattessich]], ed, ''Instrumental Reasoning and Systems Methodology: An Epistemology of the Applied and Social Sciences'' (Dordrecht: [[D. Reidel|D. Reidel Publishing]], 1978), pp [https://books.google.com/books?id=i8kmptHdx3MC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;dq=controversy#v=twopage 141–43].&lt;/ref&gt;

By now, inductive inference has been shown to exist, but is found rarely, as in programs of machine learning in [[Artificial Intelligence]] (AI).&lt;ref name=Gillies-p111/&gt;  Popper's stance on induction is strictly falsified—enumerative induction exists—but is overwhelmingly absent from science.&lt;ref name=Gillies-p111&gt;Donald Gillies, "Problem-solving and the problem of induction", in ''Rethinking Popper'' (Dordrecht: [[Springer (publisher)|Springer]], 2009), Zuzana Parusniková &amp; Robert S Cohen, eds, [https://books.google.com/books?id=R3aywtFIKKsC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=exceptions p 111]: "I argued earlier that there are some exceptions to Popper's claim that rules of inductive inference do not exist.  However, these exceptions are relatively rare.  They occur, for example, in the machine learning programs of [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]].  For the vast bulk of human science both past and present, rules of inductive inference do not exist.  For such science, Popper's model of conjectures which are freely invented and then tested out seems to me more accurate than any model based on inductive inferences.  Admittedly, there is talk nowadays in the context of science carried out by humans of 'inference to the best explanation' or 'abductive inference', but such so-called inferences are not at all inferences based on precisely formulated rules like the deductive rules of inference.  Those who talk of 'inference to the best explanation' or 'abductive inference', for example, never formulate any precise rules according to which these so-called inferences take place.  In reality, the 'inferences' which they describe in their examples involve conjectures thought up by human ingenuity and creativity, and by no means inferred in any mechanical fashion, or according to precisely specified rules".&lt;/ref&gt; Although much talked of nowadays by philosophers, abduction or IBE lacks [[rules of inference]] and the discussants provide nothing resembling such, as the process proceeds by humans' imaginations and perhaps creativity.&lt;ref name=Gillies-p111/&gt;

===Biases===
Inductive reasoning is also known as hypothesis construction because any conclusions made are based on current knowledge and predictions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} As with deductive arguments, biases can distort the proper application of inductive argument, thereby preventing the reasoner from forming the most [[Logical consequence|logical conclusion]] based on the clues. Examples of these biases include the [[availability heuristic]], [[confirmation bias]], and the [[Gambler's fallacy | predictable-world bias]]

The availability heuristic causes the reasoner to depend primarily upon information that is readily available to them. People have a tendency to rely on information that is easily accessible in the world around them. For example, in surveys, when people are asked to estimate the percentage of people who died from various causes, most respondents would choose the causes that have been most prevalent in the media such as terrorism, and murders, and airplane accidents rather than causes such as disease and traffic accidents, which have been technically "less accessible" to the individual since they are not emphasized as heavily in the world around them.

The confirmation bias is based on the natural tendency to confirm rather than to deny a current hypothesis. Research has demonstrated that people are inclined to seek solutions to problems that are more consistent with known hypotheses rather than attempt to refute those hypotheses. Often, in experiments, subjects will ask questions that seek answers that fit established hypotheses, thus confirming these hypotheses. For example, if it is hypothesized that Sally is a sociable individual, subjects will naturally seek to confirm the premise by asking questions that would produce answers confirming that Sally is in fact a sociable individual.

The predictable-world bias revolves around the inclination to perceive order where it has not been proved to exist, either at all or at a particular level of abstraction. Gambling, for example, is one of the most popular examples of predictable-world bias. Gamblers often begin to think that they see simple and obvious patterns in the outcomes and, therefore, believe that they are able to predict outcomes based upon what they have witnessed. In reality, however, the outcomes of these games are difficult to predict and highly complex in nature. However, in general, people tend to seek some type of simplistic order to explain or justify their beliefs and experiences, and it is often difficult for them to realise that their perceptions of order may be entirely different from the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gray |first=Peter |title=Psychology |location=New York |publisher=Worth |edition=Sixth |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-4292-1947-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types and examples==
The following are types of inductive argument. Notice that while similar, each has a different form.

In contrast to the binary valid/invalid for deductive arguments, inductive arguments are rated in terms of strong or weak along a continuum. An inductive argument is strong in proportion to the probability that its conclusion is correct. We may call an inductive argument plausible, probable, reasonable, justified or strong, but never certain or necessary. Logic affords no bridge from the probable to the certain.

The futility of attaining certainty through some critical mass of probability can be illustrated with a coin-toss exercise. Suppose someone shows me a coin and says the coin is either a fair one or two-headed. He flips it ten times, and ten times it comes up heads. At this point there is strong reason to believe it is two-headed. After all, the chance of ten heads in a row is .000976 – less than one in one thousand. Then, after 100 flips, still every toss has come up heads. Now there is “virtual” certainty that the coin is two-headed. Still, one can neither logically or empirically rule out that the next toss will produce tails. No matter how many times in a row it comes up heads this remains the case. If one programed a machine to flip a coin over and over continuously, at some point the result would be a string of 100 heads. In the fullness of time all combinations will appear.

As for the slim prospect of getting ten out of ten heads from a fair coin - the outcome that made the coin appear biased - many may be surprised to learn that the chance of any combination of heads or tails is equally unlikely (e.g. H-H-T-T-H-T-H-H-H-T) – and yet it occurs in ''every'' trial of ten tosses. That means ''all'' results for ten tosses have the same probability as getting ten out of ten heads, which is .000976. If one records the heads-tails series, for whatever result, that exact series had a chance of .000976.

The conclusion for a valid deductive argument is already contained in the premises since because its truth is strictly a matter of logical relations. It cannot say more than its premises. Inductive premises, on the other hand, draw their substance from fact and evidence, and the conclusion accordingly makes a factual claim or prediction. Its reliability varies proportionally with the evidence. Induction wants to reveal something ''new'' about the world. One could say that induction wants to say ''more'' than is contained in the premises.

To better see the difference between inductive and deductive arguments, consider that it would not make sense to say, "All rectangles so far examined have four right angles, so the next one I see will have four right angles." This would treat logical relations as something factual and discoverable, and thus variable and uncertain. Likewise, speaking deductively we may permissibly say. "All unicorns can fly; I have a unicorn named Charlie; Charlie can fly." This deductive argument is valid because the logical relations hold; we are not interested in their factual soundness. A faulty inductive argument might take the form, "All Swans so far observed were white, therefore it is settled that all swans white." This argument is a case of induction posing as deduction, and fails for the reasons discussed above. 

Inductive reasoning is inherently [[Uncertainty|uncertain]]. It only deals in degrees to which, given the premises, the conclusion is ''credible'' according to some theory of evidence. Examples include a [[many-valued logic]], [[Dempster–Shafer theory]], or [[Probability|probability theory]] with rules for inference such as [[Bayes' theorem|Bayes' rule]]. Unlike deductive reasoning, it does not rely on universals holding over a [[Closed world assumption|closed domain of discourse]] to draw conclusions, so it can be applicable even in cases of [[Open world assumption|epistemic uncertainty]] (technical issues with this may arise however; for example, the [[Axioms of probability#Second axiom|second axiom of probability]] is a closed-world assumption).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Bart |last=Kosko |title=Fuzziness vs. Probability |journal=International Journal of General Systems |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=211–240 |year=1990 |doi=10.1080/03081079008935108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an inductive argument:

: All biological life forms that we know of depend on liquid water to exist.
: Therefore, if we discover a new biological life form it will probably depend on liquid water to exist.

This argument could have been made every time a new biological life form was found, and would have been correct every time; however, it is still possible that in the future a biological life form not requiring liquid water could be discovered.

As a result, the argument may be stated less formally as:

: All biological life forms that we know of depend on liquid water to exist.
: All biological life probably depends on liquid water to exist.

===Generalization===
A generalization (more accurately, an ''inductive generalization'') proceeds from a premise about a [[statistical sample|sample]] to a conclusion about the [[statistical population|population]].

: The proportion Q of the sample has attribute A.
: Therefore:
: The proportion Q of the population has attribute A.

;Example
There are 20 balls—either black or white—in an urn. To estimate their respective numbers, you draw a sample of four balls and find that three are black and one is white. A good inductive generalization would be that there are 15 black and five white balls in the urn.

How much the premises support the conclusion depends upon (a) the number in the sample group, (b) the number in the population, and (c) the degree to which the sample represents the population (which may be achieved by taking a random sample). The [[hasty generalization]] and the [[biased sample]] are generalization fallacies.

====Statistical and inductive generalization====
:Of a sizeable random sample of voters surveyed 66% supports Measure Z. 
:Therefore, approximately 66% of voters supports Measure Z. 

This is a ''Statistical'' &lt;ref&gt;Schaum’s Outlines, Logic, Second Edition. John Nolt, Dennis Rohatyn, Archille Varzi.McGraw-Hill, 1998. P. 223&lt;/ref&gt;, aka ''Sample Projection.''&lt;ref&gt;Schaum’s Outlines, Logic, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;
The measure is highly reliable within a well-defined margin of error provided the sample is large and random. It is readily quantifiable. Compare the preceding argument with the following. “Six of the ten people in my book club are Libertarians. About 60% of people are Libertarians.” The argument is weak because the sample is non-random and the sample size is very small

:So far, this year his son's Little League team has won 6 of ten games. 
:By season’s end, they will have won about 60% of the games.

This is ''Inductive generalization''. This inference is less reliable that the Statistical Generalization, first, because the sample events are non-random, and because it is not reducible to mathematical expression. Statistically speaking, there is simply no way to know, measure and calculate as to the circumstances affecting performance that will obtain in the future. On a philosophical level, the argument relies on the presupposition that the operation of future events will mirror the past. In other words, it takes for granted a uniformity of nature, an unproven principle that cannot be derived from the empirical data itself. Arguments that tacitly presuppose this uniformity are sometimes called ''Humean'' after the philosopher who was first to subject them to philosophical scrutiny. &lt;ref&gt;Introduction to Logic. Gensler p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistical syllogism===
{{Main|Statistical syllogism}}

A statistical syllogism proceeds from a generalization to a conclusion about an individual.

:90% of graduates from Excelsior Preparatory school go on to University.
:Bob is a graduate of Excelsior Preparatory school. 
:Bob will go on to University.

This is a ''Statistical Syllogism''.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to Logic. Harry J. Gensler, Rutledge, 2002. P. 268&lt;/ref&gt; Even though one cannot be sure Bob will attend university we can be fully assured of the exact probability for this outcome (given no further information). Arguably the argument is too strong and might be accused of “cheating.” After all, the probability is given in the premise. Typically, Inductive reasoning seeks to ''formulate'' a probability. Two [[dicto simpliciter]] fallacies can occur in statistical syllogisms: "[[accident (fallacy)|accident]]" and "[[converse accident]]".

===Simple induction===
Simple induction proceeds from a premise about a sample group to a conclusion about another individual.

: Proportion Q of the known instances of population P has attribute A.
: Individual I is another member of P.
: Therefore:
: There is a probability corresponding to Q that I has A.

This is a combination of a generalization and a statistical syllogism, where the conclusion of the generalization is also the first premise of the statistical syllogism.

===Enumerative induction=== 
The basic form of [[inductive inference]], simply ''induction'', reasons from particular instances to all instances, and is thus an unrestricted generalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Churchill |first=Robert Paul |title=Logic: An Introduction |year=1990 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=0-312-02353-7 |oclc=21216829 |edition=2nd |page=355 |quote=In a typical enumerative induction, the premises list the individuals observed to have a common property, and the conclusion claims that all individuals of the same population have that property.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If one observes 100 swans, and all 100 were white, one might infer a universal [[categorical proposition]] of the form ''All swans are white''. As this [[argument form|reasoning form]]'s premises, even if true, do not entail the conclusion's truth, this is a form of inductive inference.  The conclusion might be true, and might be thought probably true, yet it can be false. Questions regarding the justification and form of enumerative inductions have been central in [[philosophy of science]], as enumerative induction has a pivotal role in the traditional model of the [[scientific method]].

:All life forms so far discovered are composed of cells. 
:All life forms are composed of cells. 

This is ''Enumerative Induction'', aka ''Simple Induction'' or ''Simple Predictive Induction''. It is a subcategory of Inductive Generalization. In everyday practice this is perhaps the most common form of induction. For the preceding argument, the conclusion is tempting but makes a prediction well in excess of the evidence. First, it assumes that life forms observed until now can tell us how future cases will be – an appeal to uniformity.  Second, the concluding ''All'' is a very bold assertion. A single contrary instance foils the argument. And last, to quantify the level of probability in any mathematical form is problematic. &lt;ref&gt;Schaum’s Outlines, Logic, p. 243-235&lt;/ref&gt; By what standard do we measure our earthly sample of known life against all (possible) life? For suppose we do discover some new organism - let’s say some microorganism floating in the Mesosphere, or better yet, on some asteroid - and it is cellular. Doesn't the addition of this corroborating evidence oblige us to raise our probability assessment for the subject proposition? It is generally deemed reasonable to answer this question, yes; and for a good many this “yes” is not only reasonable but incontrovertible. Very well; so then just ''how much'' should this new data change our probability assessment. Here, consensus melts away; and in its place arises a question about whether we can talk of probability coherently at all without numerical quantification. 

:All life forms so far discovered have been composed of cells. 
:The ''next'' life form discovered will be composed of cells. 

This is Enumerative Induction in its ''weak form''. It truncates “all” to a mere single instance, and by making a far weaker claim considerably strengthens the probability of its conclusion. Otherwise, it has the same shortcomings as the strong form: its sample population is non-random, and quantification methods are elusive.

===Argument from analogy===
{{Main|Argument from analogy}}

The process of analogical inference involves noting the shared properties of two or more things, and from this basis inferring that they also share some further property:&lt;ref name="Baronett"&gt;{{Cite book
| last = Baronett
| first = Stan
| title = Logic
| publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall
| location = Upper Saddle River, NJ
| year = 2008
| pages = 321–325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:P and Q are similar in respect to properties a, b, and c.
:Object P has been observed to have further property x.
:Therefore, Q probably has property x also.

Analogical reasoning is very frequent in [[common sense]], [[science]], [[philosophy]] and the [[humanities]], but sometimes it is accepted only as an auxiliary method. A refined approach is [[case-based reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;For more information on inferences by analogy, see [http://www.cs.hut.fi/Opinnot/T-93.850/2005/Papers/juthe2005-analogy.pdf Juthe, 2005].&lt;/ref&gt;

:Mineral A is an igneous rock often containing veins of quartz, and most commonly found in South America in areas of ancient volcanic activity.
:Additionally, mineral A is soft stone suitable for carving into jewelry.
:Mineral B is an igneous rock often containing veins of quartz, and most commonly found in South America in areas of ancient volcanic activity.                                                 
:Mineral B is probably a soft stone suitable for carving into jewelry.

This is ''analogical induction'', according to which things alike in certain ways are more prone to be alike in other ways. This form of induction was explored in detail my philosopher John Stewart Mill in his System of Logic, wherein he states,

:"There can be no doubt that every resemblance [not known to be irrelevant] affords some degree :of probability, beyond what
:would otherwise exist, in favor of the conclusion."&lt;ref&gt;A System of Logic. Mill 1843/1930. p 333&lt;/ref&gt;

Analogical induction is a subcategory of inductive generalization because it assumes a pre-established uniformity governing events. Analogical induction requires an auxiliary examination of the ''relevancy'' of the characteristics cited as common to the pair. In the preceding example, if I add the premise that both stones were mentioned in the records of early Spanish explorers, this common attribute is extraneous to the stones and does not contribute to their probable affinity. 

A pitfall of analogy is that features can be cherry-picked: While objects may show striking similarities, two things juxtaposed may respectively possess other characteristics not identified in the analogy that are characteristics sharply ''dis''similar. Thus, analogy can mislead if not all relevant comparisons are made.

===Causal inference===
A causal inference draws a conclusion about a causal connection based on the conditions of the occurrence of an effect. Premises about the correlation of two things can indicate a causal relationship between them, but additional factors must be confirmed to establish the exact form of the causal relationship.

===Prediction===
A prediction draws a conclusion about a future individual from a past sample.

: Proportion Q of observed members of group G have had attribute A.
: Therefore:
: There is a probability corresponding to Q that other members of group G will have attribute A when next observed.

==Bayesian inference==
As a logic of induction rather than a theory of belief, [[Bayesian inference]] does not determine which beliefs are ''a priori'' rational, but rather determines how we should rationally change the beliefs we have when presented with evidence. We begin by committing to a [[prior probability]] for a hypothesis based on logic or previous experience, and when faced with evidence, we adjust the strength of our belief in that hypothesis in a precise manner using [[conditional probability|Bayesian logic]].

==Inductive inference==
Around 1960, [[Ray Solomonoff]] founded the theory of universal [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference|inductive inference]], the theory of prediction based on observations; for example, predicting the next symbol based upon a given series of symbols. This is a formal inductive framework that combines [[algorithmic information theory]] with the Bayesian framework. Universal inductive inference is based on solid philosophical foundations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Samuel |last=Rathmanner |author2link=Marcus Hutter |first2=Marcus |last2=Hutter |title=A Philosophical Treatise of Universal Induction |journal=Entropy |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=1076–1136 |year=2011 |doi=10.3390/e13061076 |bibcode=2011Entrp..13.1076R |arxiv=1105.5721 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be considered as a mathematically formalized [[Occam's razor]]. Fundamental ingredients of the theory are the concepts of [[algorithmic probability]] and [[Kolmogorov complexity]].

{{quantum field theory}}
A '''gauge theory''' is a type of [[Scientific theory|theory]] in [[physics]]. The word '''gauge''' means a [[Measurement|measurement]], a thickness, an in-between distance, (as in [[Track gauge|railroad tracks]]) or a resulting number of units per certain parameter (a number of loops in an inch of fabric or a [[Gauge (bore diameter)|number of lead balls in a pound of ammunition]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gauge&lt;/ref&gt; Modern theories describe physical forces in terms of [[Field (physics)|fields]], e.g., the [[electromagnetic field]], the [[gravitational field]], and fields that describe forces between the [[elementary particles]]. A general feature of these field theories is that the fundamental fields cannot be directly measured; however, some associated quantities can be measured, such as charges, energies, and velocities. For example, say you cannot measure the diameter of a lead ball, but you can determine how many lead balls, which are equal in every way, are required to make a pound. Using the number of balls, the elemental mass of lead, and the formula for calculating the volume of a sphere from its diameter, one could indirectly determine the diameter of a single lead ball.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gauge&lt;/ref&gt; In field theories, different configurations of the unobservable fields can result in identical observable quantities. A transformation from one such field configuration to another is called a '''gauge transformation''';&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Hill Perkins|Donald H. Perkins]] (1982) ''Introduction to High-Energy Physics''. Addison-Wesley: 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Penrose]] (2004) ''[[The Road to Reality]]'', p. 451. For an alternative formulation in terms of symmetries of the [[Lagrangian density]], see p. 489. Also see J. D. Jackson (1975) ''Classical Electrodynamics'', 2nd ed. Wiley and Sons: 176.&lt;/ref&gt; the lack of change in the measurable quantities, despite the field being transformed, is a property called '''gauge invariance'''. For example, if you could measure the color of lead balls and discover that when you change the color, you still fit the same number of balls in a pound, the property of "color" would show '''gauge invariance'''. Since any kind of invariance under a field transformation is considered a [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry]], gauge invariance is sometimes called '''gauge symmetry'''. Generally, any theory that has the property of gauge invariance is considered a gauge theory.

For example, in electromagnetism the electric and magnetic fields, '''E''' and '''B''' are observable, while the potentials ''V'' ("voltage") and '''A''' (the [[magnetic vector potential|vector potential]]) are not.&lt;ref&gt;For an argument that ''V'' and '''A''' are more fundamental, see Feynman, Leighton, and Sands, '''The Feynman Lectures''', Addison Wesley Longman, 1970, II-15-7,8,12, but this is partly a matter of personal preference.&lt;/ref&gt; Under a gauge transformation in which a constant is added to ''V'', no observable change occurs in '''E''' or '''B'''.

With the advent of [[quantum mechanics]] in the 1920s, and with successive advances in [[quantum field theory]], the importance of gauge transformations has steadily grown. Gauge theories constrain the laws of physics, because all the changes induced by a gauge transformation have to cancel each other out when written in terms of observable quantities. Over the course of the 20th century, physicists gradually realized that all forces ([[fundamental interaction]]s) arise from the constraints imposed by [[local symmetry|''local'' gauge symmetries]], in which case the transformations vary from point to point in [[spacetime|space and time]]. [[Perturbation theory|Perturbative]] [[quantum field theory]] (usually employed for scattering theory) describes forces in terms of force-mediating particles called [[gauge boson]]s. The nature of these particles is determined by the nature of the gauge transformations. The culmination of these efforts is the [[Standard Model]], a quantum field theory that accurately predicts all of the fundamental interactions except [[gravity]].

==History and importance==

The earliest field theory having a gauge symmetry was [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s formulation, in 1864–65, of [[classical electrodynamics|electrodynamics]]  ("[[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]]"). The importance of this symmetry remained unnoticed in the earliest formulations. Similarly unnoticed, [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] had derived Einstein's equations of general relativity by postulating a symmetry under any change of coordinates.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}{{when|date=September 2015}}  Later [[Hermann Weyl]], inspired by success in Einstein's [[general relativity]], conjectured (incorrectly, as it turned out) in year 1919 that invariance under the change of [[scale (measurement)|scale]] or "gauge" (a term inspired by the various [[track gauge]]s of railroads) might also be a local symmetry of electromagnetism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hermann Weyl]] (1919), "Eine neue Erweiterung der Relativitíatstheorie," ''Ann. der Physik'' '''59''', 101–133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moriyasu1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=K. Moriyasu|title=An Elementary Primer for Gauge Theory|year=1983|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-9971-950-83-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5, 12}}  Although Weyl's choice of the gauge was incorrect, the name "gauge" stuck to the approach.  After the development of [[quantum mechanics]], Weyl, [[Vladimir Fock|Fock]] and [[Fritz London|London]] modified their gauge choice by replacing the scale factor with a change of wave [[phase (waves)|phase]], and applying it successfully to electromagnetism.&lt;ref&gt;For a review and references, see [[Lochlainn O’Raifeartaigh]] and Norbert Straumann, "Gauge theory: Historical origins and some modern developments," ''Reviews of Modern Physics'', 72 (2000), pp. 1–22, {{doi|10.1103/RevModPhys.72.1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gauge symmetry was generalized mathematically in 1954 by [[Chen Ning Yang]] and [[Robert Mills (physicist)|Robert Mills]] in an attempt to describe the [[Strong interaction|strong nuclear forces]]. This idea, dubbed [[Yang–Mills theory]], later found application in the [[quantum field theory]] of the [[weak force]], and its unification with electromagnetism in the [[electroweak]] theory.

The importance of gauge theories for physics stems from their tremendous success in providing a unified framework to describe the [[quantum field theory|quantum-mechanical behavior]] of [[electromagnetism]], the [[weak force]] and the [[strong force]]. This gauge theory, known as the [[Standard model|Standard Model]], accurately describes experimental predictions regarding three of the four [[fundamental force]]s of nature.

==In classical physics==

===Electromagnetism===
{{Main|Gauge fixing}}
Historically, the first example of gauge symmetry to be discovered was classical [[electromagnetism]].{{clarify|post-text=Not for classical gravitational fields?|date=September 2015}} A static electric field can be described in terms of an [[electric potential]] (voltage) that is defined at every point in space, and in practical work it is conventional to take the Earth as a physical reference that defines the zero level of the potential, or [[electrical ground|ground]]. But only ''differences'' in potential are physically measurable, which is the reason that a [[voltmeter]] must have two probes, and can only report the voltage difference between them. Thus one could choose to define all voltage differences relative to some other standard, rather than the Earth, resulting in the addition of a constant offset.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Purcell (1963) ''Electricity and Magnetism''. McGraw-Hill: 38.&lt;/ref&gt; If the potential &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a solution to [[Maxwell's equations]] then, after this gauge transformation, the new potential &lt;math&gt;V \rightarrow V+C&lt;/math&gt; is also a solution to Maxwell's equations and no experiment can distinguish between these two solutions. In other words, the laws of physics governing electricity and magnetism (that is, Maxwell equations) are invariant under gauge transformation.&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Jackson (1975) ''Classical Electrodynamics'', 2nd ed. Wiley and Sons: 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell's equations have a gauge symmetry.

Generalizing from static electricity to electromagnetism, we have a second potential, the [[magnetic vector potential]] '''A''', which can also undergo gauge transformations. These transformations may be local. That is, rather than adding a constant onto ''V'', one can add a function that takes on different values at different points in space and time. If '''A''' is also changed in certain corresponding ways, then the same '''E''' and '''B''' fields result. The detailed mathematical relationship between the fields '''E''' and '''B''' and the potentials ''V'' and '''A''' is given in the article [[Gauge fixing]], along with the precise statement of the nature of the gauge transformation. The relevant point here is that the fields remain the same under the gauge transformation, and therefore [[Maxwell's equations]] are still satisfied.

Gauge symmetry is closely related to [[charge conservation]]. Suppose that there existed some process by which one could briefly violate conservation of charge by creating a charge ''q'' at a certain point in space, 1, moving it to some other point 2, and then destroying it. We might imagine that this process was consistent with conservation of energy. We could posit a rule stating that creating the charge required an input of energy ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=''qV''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and destroying it released ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=''qV''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which would seem natural since ''qV'' measures the extra energy stored in the electric field because of the existence of a charge at a certain point. Outside of the interval during which the particle exists, conservation of energy would be satisfied, because the net energy released by creation and destruction of the particle, ''qV''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-''qV''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, would be equal to the work done in moving the particle from 1 to 2, ''qV''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-''qV''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. But although this scenario salvages conservation of energy, it violates gauge symmetry. Gauge symmetry requires that the laws of physics be invariant under the transformation &lt;math&gt;V \rightarrow V+C&lt;/math&gt;, which implies that no experiment should be able to measure the absolute potential, without reference to some external standard such as an electrical ground. But the proposed rules ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=''qV''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=''qV''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for the energies of creation and destruction ''would'' allow an experimenter to determine the absolute potential, simply by comparing the energy input required to create the charge ''q'' at a particular point in space in the case where the potential is &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V+C&lt;/math&gt; respectively. The conclusion is that if gauge symmetry holds, and energy is conserved, then charge must be conserved.&lt;ref&gt;Donald H. Perkins (1982) ''Introduction to High-Energy Physics''. Addison-Wesley: 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Diffeomorphism of a square.svg|right|thumb|The Cartesian coordinate grid on this square has been distorted by a coordinate transformation, so that there is a nonlinear relationship between the old (x,y) coordinates and the new ones. Einstein's equations of general relativity are still valid in the new coordinate system. Such changes of coordinate system are the gauge transformations of general relativity.]]

===General relativity===
As discussed above, the gauge transformations for classical (i.e., non-quantum mechanical) [[general relativity]] are arbitrary coordinate transformations.&lt;ref name="Robert M. Wald 1984, p. 260"&gt;[[Robert M. Wald]] (1984) ''General Relativity''. University of Chicago Press: 260.&lt;/ref&gt;  Technically, the transformations must be invertible, and both the transformation and its inverse must be smooth, in the sense of being [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] an arbitrary number of times.

====An example of a symmetry in a physical theory: translation invariance====
Some global symmetries under changes of coordinate predate both general relativity and the concept of a gauge. For example, [[Galileo]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] introduced the notion of [[Galilean transformation|translation invariance]]{{when|date=September 2015}}, an advancement from the [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotelian]] concept that different places in space, such as the earth versus the heavens, obeyed different physical rules.

Suppose, for example, that one observer examines the properties of a hydrogen atom on Earth, the other—on the Moon (or any other place in the universe), the observer will find that their hydrogen atoms exhibit completely identical properties. Again, if one observer had examined a hydrogen atom today and the other—100 years ago (or any other time in the past or in the future), the two experiments would again produce completely identical results. The invariance of the properties of a hydrogen atom with respect to the time and place where these properties were investigated is called translation invariance.

Recalling our two observers from different ages: the time in their experiments is shifted by 100 years. If the time when the older observer did the experiment was ''t'', the time of the modern experiment is ''t''+100 years. Both observers discover the same laws of physics. Because light from hydrogen atoms in distant galaxies may reach the earth after having traveled across space for billions of years, in effect one can do such observations covering periods of time almost all the way back to the [[Big Bang]], and they show that the laws of physics have always been the same.

In other words, if in the theory we change the time ''t'' to ''t''+100 years (or indeed any other time shift) the theoretical predictions do not change.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Misner]], [[Kip Thorne]], and [[John A. Wheeler]] (1973) ''[[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]]''. W. H. Freeman: 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Another example of a symmetry: the invariance of Einstein's field equation under arbitrary coordinate transformations====
In Einstein's [[general relativity]], coordinates like ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', and ''t'' are not only "relative" in the global sense of translations like &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow t+C&lt;/math&gt;, rotations, etc., but become completely arbitrary, so that, for example, one can define an entirely new time-like coordinate according to some arbitrary rule such as &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow t+t^3/t_0^2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; has units of time, and yet [[Einstein's equations]] will have the same form.&lt;ref name="Robert M. Wald 1984, p. 260"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973) ''[[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]]''. W. H. Freeman: 967.&lt;/ref&gt;

Invariance of the form of an equation under an arbitrary coordinate transformation is customarily referred to as [[general covariance]], and equations with this property are referred to as written in the covariant form. General covariance is a special case of gauge invariance.

Maxwell's equations can also be expressed in a generally covariant form, which is as invariant under general coordinate transformation as Einstein's field equation.

==In quantum mechanics==

===Quantum electrodynamics===
Until the advent of quantum mechanics, the only well known example of gauge symmetry was in electromagnetism, and the general significance of the concept was not fully understood. For example, it was not clear whether it was the fields '''E''' and '''B''' or the potentials '''V''' and '''A''' that were the fundamental quantities; if the former, then the gauge transformations could be considered as nothing more than a mathematical trick.

===Aharonov–Bohm experiment===
[[Image:Double slit diffraction.svg|right|thumb|Double-slit diffraction and interference pattern]]

{{Main|Aharonov–Bohm effect}}
In quantum mechanics, a particle such as an electron is also described as a wave. For example, if the [[double-slit experiment]] is performed with electrons, then a wave-like interference pattern is observed. The electron has the highest probability of being detected at locations where the parts of the wave passing through the two slits are in phase with one another, resulting in [[wave interference|constructive interference]]. The frequency of the electron ''wave'' is related to the kinetic energy of an individual electron ''particle'' via the quantum-mechanical relation ''E'' = ''hf''. If there are no electric or magnetic fields present in this experiment, then the electron's energy is constant, and, for example, there will be a high probability of detecting the electron along the central axis of the experiment, where by symmetry the two parts of the wave are in phase.

But now suppose that the electrons in the experiment are subject to electric or magnetic fields. For example, if an electric field was imposed on one side of the axis but not on the other, the results of the experiment would be affected. The part of the electron wave passing through that side oscillates at a different rate, since its energy has had −''eV'' added to it, where −''e'' is the charge of the electron and ''V'' the electrical potential. The results of the experiment will be different, because phase relationships between the two parts of the electron wave have changed, and therefore the locations of constructive and destructive interference will be shifted to one side or the other. It is the electric potential that occurs here, not the electric field, and this is a manifestation of the fact that it is the potentials and not the fields that are of fundamental significance in quantum mechanics.

[[Image:Aharonov-Bohm effect.svg|thumbnail|left|250px|Schematic of double-slit experiment in which Aharonov–Bohm effect can be observed: electrons pass through two slits, interfering at an observation screen, with the interference pattern shifted when a magnetic field '''B''' is turned on in the cylindrical solenoid, marked in blue on the diagram.]]

====Explanation with potentials====
It is even possible to have cases in which an experiment's results differ when the potentials are changed, even if no charged particle is ever exposed to a different field. One such example is the [[Aharonov–Bohm effect]], shown in the figure.&lt;ref&gt;Feynman, Leighton, and Sands (1970) ''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]''. Addison Wesley, vol. II, chpt. 15, section 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In this example, turning on the solenoid only causes a magnetic field '''B''' to exist within the solenoid. But the solenoid has been positioned so that the electron cannot possibly pass through its interior. If one believed that the fields were the fundamental quantities, then one would expect that the results of the experiment would be unchanged. In reality, the results are different, because turning on the solenoid changed the vector potential '''A''' in the region that the electrons do pass through. Now that it has been established that it is the potentials '''V''' and '''A''' that are fundamental, and not the fields '''E''' and '''B''', we can see that the gauge transformations, which change '''V''' and '''A''', have real physical significance, rather than being merely mathematical artifacts.

====Gauge invariance: the results of the experiments are independent of the choice of the gauge for the potentials====
Note that in these experiments, the only quantity that affects the result is the ''difference'' in phase between the two parts of the electron wave. Suppose we imagine the two parts of the electron wave as tiny clocks, each with a single hand that sweeps around in a circle, keeping track of its own phase. Although this cartoon ignores some technical details, it retains the physical phenomena that are important here.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Feynman]] (1985) ''[[QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter]]''. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; If both clocks are sped up by the same amount, the phase relationship between them is unchanged, and the results of experiments are the same. Not only that, but it is not even necessary to change the speed of each clock by a ''fixed'' amount. We could change the angle of the hand on each clock by a ''varying'' amount θ, where θ could depend on both the position in space and on time. This would have no effect on the result of the experiment, since the final observation of the location of the electron occurs at a single place and time, so that the phase shift in each electron's "clock" would be the same, and the two effects would cancel out. This is another example of a gauge transformation: it is local, and it does not change the results of experiments.

===Summary===
In summary, gauge symmetry attains its full importance in the context of quantum mechanics. In the application of quantum mechanics to electromagnetism, i.e., [[quantum electrodynamics]], gauge symmetry applies to both electromagnetic waves and electron waves. These two gauge symmetries are in fact intimately related. If a gauge transformation θ is applied to the electron waves, for example, then one must also apply a corresponding transformation to the potentials that describe the electromagnetic waves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Hill Perkins|Donald H. Perkins]] (1982) ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_High_Energy_Physics.html?id=e63cNigcmOUC Introduction to High-Energy Physics]''. Addison-Wesley: 332.&lt;/ref&gt; Gauge symmetry is required in order to make quantum electrodynamics a [[renormalization|renormalizable]] theory, i.e., one in which the calculated predictions of all physically measurable quantities are finite.

===Types of gauge symmetries===
The description of the electrons in the subsection above as little clocks is in effect a statement of the mathematical rules according to which the phases of electrons are to be added and subtracted: they are to be treated as ordinary numbers, except that in the case where the result of the calculation falls outside the range of 0≤θ&lt;360°, we force it to "wrap around" into the allowed range, which covers a circle. Another way of putting this is that a phase angle of, say, 5° is considered to be completely equivalent to an angle of 365°. Experiments have verified this testable statement about the interference patterns formed by electron waves. Except for the "wrap-around" property, the algebraic properties of this mathematical structure are exactly the same as those of the ordinary real numbers.

In mathematical terminology, electron phases form an [[Abelian group]] under addition, called the [[circle group]] or ''U''(1). "Abelian" means that addition  [[commutative law|commutes]], so that θ&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;φ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;φ&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;θ. [[group (mathematics)|Group]] means that addition [[associativity|associates]] and has an [[identity element]], namely "0". Also, for every phase there exists an [[inverse element|inverse]] such that the sum of a phase and its inverse is 0. Other examples of abelian groups are the integers under addition, 0, and negation, and the nonzero fractions under product, 1, and reciprocal.

[[Image:gauge.png|right|thumb|Gauge fixing of a ''twisted'' cylinder.]]
As a way of visualizing the choice of a gauge, consider whether it is possible to tell if a cylinder has been twisted. If the cylinder has no bumps, marks, or scratches on it, we cannot tell. We could, however, draw an arbitrary curve along the cylinder, defined by some function θ(''x''), where ''x'' measures distance along the axis of the cylinder. Once this arbitrary choice (the choice of gauge) has been made, it becomes possible to detect it if someone later twists the cylinder.

In 1954, [[Chen Ning Yang]] and [[Robert Mills (physicist)|Robert Mills]] proposed to generalize these ideas to noncommutative groups. A noncommutative gauge group can describe a field that, unlike the electromagnetic field, interacts with itself. For example, [[general relativity]] states that gravitational fields have energy, and [[special relativity]] concludes that energy is equivalent to mass. Hence a gravitational field induces a further gravitational field. The [[nuclear forces]] also have this self-interacting property.

===Gauge bosons===
Surprisingly, gauge symmetry can give a deeper explanation for the existence of interactions, such as the electric and nuclear interactions. This arises from a type of gauge symmetry relating to the fact that all particles of a given type are experimentally indistinguishable from one another. Imagine that Alice and Betty are identical twins, labeled at birth by bracelets reading A and B. Because the girls are identical, nobody would be able to tell if they had been switched at birth; the labels A and B are arbitrary, and can be interchanged. Such a permanent interchanging of their identities is like a global gauge symmetry. There is also a corresponding local gauge symmetry, which describes the fact that from one moment to the next, Alice and Betty could swap roles while nobody was looking, and nobody would be able to tell. If we observe that Mom's favorite vase is broken, we can only infer that the blame belongs to one twin or the other, but we cannot tell whether the blame is 100% Alice's and 0% Betty's, or vice versa. If Alice and Betty are in fact quantum-mechanical particles rather than people, then they also have wave properties, including the property of [[superposition principle|superposition]], which allows waves to be added, subtracted, and mixed arbitrarily. It follows that we are not even restricted to complete swaps of identity. For example, if we observe that a certain amount of energy exists in a certain location in space, there is no experiment that can tell us whether that energy is 100% A's and 0% B's, 0% A's and 100% B's, or 20% A's and 80% B's, or some other mixture. The fact that the symmetry is local means that we cannot even count on these proportions to remain fixed as the particles propagate through space. The details of how this is represented mathematically depend on technical issues relating to the [[spin (physics)|spins]] of the particles, but for our present purposes we consider a spinless particle, for which it turns out that the mixing can be specified by some arbitrary choice of gauge θ(''x''), where an angle θ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0° represents 100% A and 0% B, θ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;90° means 0% A and 100% B, and intermediate angles represent mixtures.

According to the principles of quantum mechanics, particles do not actually have trajectories through space. Motion can only be described in terms of waves, and the momentum ''p'' of an individual particle is related to its wavelength λ by ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''h''/''λ''. In terms of empirical measurements, the wavelength can only be determined by observing a change in the wave between one point in space and another nearby point (mathematically, by [[derivative|differentiation]]). A wave with a shorter wavelength oscillates more rapidly, and therefore changes more rapidly between nearby points. Now suppose that we arbitrarily fix a gauge at one point in space, by saying that the energy at that location is 20% A's and 80% B's. We then measure the two waves at some other, nearby point, in order to determine their wavelengths. But there are two entirely different reasons that the waves could have changed. They could have changed because they were oscillating with a certain wavelength, or they could have changed because the gauge function changed from a 20-80 mixture to, say, 21-79. If we ignore the second possibility, the resulting theory doesn't work; strange discrepancies in momentum will show up, violating the principle of conservation of momentum. Something in the theory must be changed.

Again there are technical issues relating to spin, but in several important cases, including electrically charged particles and particles interacting via nuclear forces, the solution to the problem is to impute physical reality to the gauge function θ(''x''). We say that if the function θ oscillates, it represents a new type of quantum-mechanical wave, and this new wave has its own momentum ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''h''/''λ'', which turns out to patch up the discrepancies that otherwise would have broken conservation of momentum. In the context of electromagnetism, the particles A and B would be charged particles such as electrons, and the quantum mechanical wave represented by θ would be the electromagnetic field. (Here we ignore the technical issues raised by the fact that electrons actually have spin 1/2, not spin zero. This oversimplification is the reason that the gauge field θ comes out to be a scalar, whereas the electromagnetic field is actually represented by a vector consisting of ''V'' and '''A'''.) The result is that we have an explanation for the presence of electromagnetic interactions: if we try to construct a gauge-symmetric theory of identical, non-interacting particles, the result is not self-consistent, and can only be repaired by adding electric and magnetic fields that cause the particles to interact.

Although the function θ(''x'') describes a wave, the laws of quantum mechanics require that it also have particle properties. In the case of electromagnetism, the particle corresponding to electromagnetic waves is the photon. In general, such particles are called [[gauge bosons]], where the term "boson" refers to a particle with integer spin. In the simplest versions of the theory, gauge bosons are massless, but it is also possible to construct versions in which they have mass, as is the case for the gauge bosons that transmit the nuclear decay forces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2663">In the area of mathematics known as [[functional analysis]], '''James' space''' is an important example in the theory of [[Banach space]]s and commonly serves as useful counterexample to general statements concerning the structure of general Banach spaces. The space was first introduced in 1950 in a short paper by [[Robert C. James]].&lt;ref&gt;James, Robert C. ''A Non-Reflexive Banach Space Isometric With Its Second Conjugate Space.'' Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 37, no. 3 (March 1951): 174–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

James' space serves as an example of a space that is isometrically isomorphic to its [[Dual space#Double dual|double dual]], while not being [[reflexive space|reflexive]]. Furthermore, James' space has a [[Schauder basis|basis]], while having no [[Schauder basis#Unconditionality|unconditional basis]].

== Definition ==

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; denote the family of all finite increasing sequences of integers of odd length. For any sequence of real numbers &lt;math&gt;x=(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p = (p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_{2n+1}) \in \mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; we define the quantity

: &lt;math&gt;\|x\|_p := \left( x_{p_{2n+1}}^2 + \sum_{m=1}^n (x_{p_{2m-1}} - x_{p_{2m}})^2 \right)^{1/2}. &lt;/math&gt;

James' space, denoted by '''J''', is defined to be all elements ''x'' from [[Sequence space#c and c0|''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]] satisfying 
&lt;math&gt;\sup\{\|x\|_p:p\in\mathcal{P}\} &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;, endowed with the norm &lt;math&gt;\|x\| := \sup\{\|x\|_p:p\in\mathcal{P}\} \ (x\in \mathbf{J})&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties &lt;ref&gt;Morrison, T.J. ''Functional Analysis: An introduction to Banach space theory''. Wiley. (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; ==

* James' space is a Banach space.
* The [[Standard basis#Generalizations|canonical basis]] {e&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;} is a (conditional) [[Schauder basis]] for '''J'''. Furthermore, this basis is both [[Schauder basis#Properties|monotone]] and [[Schauder basis#Schauder bases and duality|shrinking]].
* '''J''' has no [[Schauder basis#Unconditionality|unconditional basis]].
* James' space is not [[reflexive space|reflexive]]. Its image into its [[Dual space#Double dual|double dual]] under the canonical embedding has [[codimension]] one.
* James' space is however isometrically isomorphic to its double dual.
* James' space is ''somewhat reflexive'', meaning every closed infinite-dimensional subspace contains an infinite dimensional reflexive subspace. In particular, every closed infinite-dimensional subspace contains an isomorphic copy of&amp;nbsp;[[lp space|''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].

[[File:JosefEhrenfriedHofmann MFO15792.jpg|thumb|Hofmann (left) in [[Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach|Oberwolfach]]]]
'''Joseph Ehrenfried Hofmann''' (* 7 March 1900 in [[Munich]], † 7 May 1973 in Günzburg ) was a [[Germany|German]] historian of [[mathematics]], known for his research on [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]].

==Life and work==

After graduating from high school in 1919 at the Wilhelm Gymnasium in Munich, Hofmann studied in Munich (Ph.D., 1927, [[Walther von Dyck]] and George Faber ) and was briefly an assistant in Munich and Darmstadt, before he went into the teaching profession (in Gunzburg, Nördlingen). As a student he was drawn to the history of mathematics, after Faber him for publishing the works of Euler heranzog. A big influence was Henry Wieleitner, with whom he published several works on the history of calculus. As a school teacher, he continued his historical studies. In 1939 he habilitated in the history of mathematics at the [[University of Berlin]]. 1940 to 1945 he was entrusted with the Leibniz edition of the Berlin Academy of Sciences. 1947 until his retirement in 1963 he was again high school teacher in Gunzburg. He also had (in part-time) professor of the History of Mathematics at the Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, the Humboldt University of Berlin, the Eberhard Karls University of Tuebingen (honorary professorship in 1950) and the Technical University of Karlsruhe . He organized regular symposia on the history of mathematics at the Mathematical Research Institute in Oberwolfach, where he worked right after the war.
Hofmann was considered an expert in the development of calculus by Leibniz, whose time in Paris he studied carefully and so significantly to the Enlightenment (or reassurance) of long in the history of mathematics echoing priority dispute between Leibniz and Isaac Newton contributed to the invention of calculus. He was co-editor of the works of Leibniz, and others of Nicholas of Cusa, Johann Bernoulli (and other reprint editions of her work in publishing and Georg Olms, Hildesheim, such as mathematics history of Abraham Gotthelf Kästner ). He also worked on number theory by [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]] . He discovered including some new works of Fermat (published 1943).
He died after he drove off a car on the morning walk.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6092">In [[combinatorial number theory]], the '''Lambek–Moser theorem''' is a generalization of [[Beatty's theorem]] that defines a [[partition (number theory)|partition]] of the positive [[integer]]s into two subsets from any monotonic integer-valued function. Conversely, any partition of the positive integers into two subsets may be defined from a monotonic function in this way.

The theorem was discovered by [[Leo Moser]] and [[Joachim Lambek]]. {{harvtxt|Dijkstra|1980}} provides a [[proof without words|visual proof]] of the result.&lt;ref&gt;For another proof, see {{citation|url=http://www.math.ust.hk/excalibur/v4_n1.pdf|journal=Mathematical Excalibur|volume=4|issue=1|page=2|year=1998|title=A proof for the Lambek and Moser theorem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement of the theorem==
The theorem applies to any [[monotonic function|non-decreasing]] and un[[bounded function]] {{mvar|f}} that maps positive integers to non-negative integers. From any such function {{mvar|f}}, define {{math|''f''{{hsp}}*}} to be the integer-valued function that is as close as possible to the [[inverse function]] of {{mvar|f}}, in the sense that, for all {{mvar|n}},
:{{math|''f''{{hsp}}(''f''{{hsp}}*(''n'')) &lt; ''n'' ≤ ''f''{{hsp}}(''f''{{hsp}}*(''n'') + 1)}}.
It follows from this definition that {{math|1=''f''{{hsp}}** = ''f''}}.
Further, let
:{{math|1=''F''(''n'') = ''f''{{hsp}}(''n'') + ''n''}} and {{math|1=''G''(''n'') = ''f''{{hsp}}*(''n'') + ''n''}}.

Then the result states that {{math|''F''}} and {{math|''G''}} are strictly increasing and that the ranges of {{math|''F''}} and {{math|''G''}} form a partition of the positive integers.

==Example==
Let {{math|1=''f''{{hsp}}(''n'') = ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}};&lt;ref&gt;Example from {{citation|last=Garry|first=Y. K. K.|title=Inverse sequences and complementary sequences|journal=Mathematical Excalibur|volume=3|issue=4|year=1997|page=2|url=http://www.math.ust.hk/excalibur/v3_n4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f^\ast(n)=\lfloor\sqrt{n-1}\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus {{math|1=''F''(''n'') = ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''n''}} and &lt;math&gt;G(n)=\lfloor\sqrt{n-1}\rfloor+n.&lt;/math&gt;
For {{math|1=''n'' = 1, 2, 3, ...}} the values of {{mvar|F}} are the [[pronic number]]s
:2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56, 72, 90, 110, ...
while the values of {{mvar|G}} are
:1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, ....
These two sequences are complementary: each positive integer belongs to exactly one of them. The Lambek–Moser theorem states that this phenomenon is not specific to the pronic numbers, but rather it arises for any choice of {{mvar|f}} with the appropriate properties.

==Beatty's theorem==
[[Beatty's theorem]], defining a partition of the integers from rounding their multiples by an [[irrational number]] {{math|''r'' &gt; 1}}, can be seen as an instance of the Lambek–Moser theorem. In Beatty's theorem, &lt;math&gt;f(n)=\lfloor rn\rfloor-n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^\ast(n)=\lfloor sn\rfloor-n,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{r}+\tfrac{1}{s}=1&lt;/math&gt;. The condition that {{mvar|r}} (and therefore {{mvar|s}}) be greater than one implies that these two functions are non-decreasing; the derived functions are &lt;math&gt;F(n)=\lfloor rn\rfloor&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G(n)=\lfloor sn\rfloor.&lt;/math&gt; The sequences of values of {{mvar|F}} and {{mvar|G}} forming the derived partition are known as Beatty sequences.

==Universality==
The Lambek–Moser theorem is universal, in the sense that it can explain any partition of the integers into two infinite parts. If {{math|1=''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...}} and {{math|1=''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...}} are any two infinite subsets forming a partition of the integers, one may construct a pair of functions {{mvar|f}} and {{math|''f''{{hsp}}*}} from which this partition may be derived using the Lambek–Moser theorem: define {{math|1=''f''{{hsp}}(''n'') = ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''n''}} and {{math|1=''f''{{hsp}}*(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''n''}}.

For instance, consider the partition of integers into [[Parity (mathematics)|even and odd numbers]]: let {{mvar|S}} be the even numbers and {{mvar|T}} be the odd numbers.
Then {{math|1=''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''n''}}, so {{math|1=''f''{{hsp}}(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''}} and similarly {{math|1=''f''{{hsp}}*(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1}}. These two functions {{mvar|f}} and {{math|''f''{{hsp}}*}} form an inverse pair, and the partition generated via the Lambek–Moser theorem from this pair is just the partition of the positive integers into even and odd numbers.

Lambek and Moser discuss formulas involving the [[prime-counting function]] for the functions {{mvar|f}} and {{math|''f''{{hsp}}*}} arising in this way from the partition of the positive integers into [[prime number]]s and [[composite number]]s.

[[File:80-80-20 triangle problem JCB.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Solution to Langley’s 80-80-20 triangle problem]]
'''Langley’s Adventitious Angles''' is a mathematical problem posed by [[Edward Mann Langley]] in ''[[The Mathematical Gazette]]'' in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Problem 644|first=E. M.|last=Langley|authorlink=Edward Mann Langley|journal=[[The Mathematical Gazette]]|year=1922|volume=11|page=173}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Darling/&gt;

==The problem==

In its original form the problem was as follows: &lt;math&gt;ABC&lt;/math&gt; is an [[isosceles triangle]].

::&lt;math&gt;\angle{B}=\angle{C}=80^\circ.&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;CF&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;30^\circ&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;AC&lt;/math&gt; cuts &lt;math&gt;AB&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;F.&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;BE&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;20^\circ&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;AB&lt;/math&gt; cuts &lt;math&gt;AC&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;E.&lt;/math&gt;

::Draw &lt;math&gt;FE.&lt;/math&gt;

::Prove &lt;math&gt;\angle{BEF}=30^\circ.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name=Darling&gt;{{citation|title=The Universal Book of Mathematics: From Abracadabra to Zeno's Paradoxes|first=David|last=Darling|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2004|page=180|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnpChqstvg0C&amp;pg=PA180|authorlink=David J. Darling}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Adventitious angles|first=Colin|last=Tripp|journal=[[The Mathematical Gazette]]|volume=59|year=1975|pages=98–106|jstor=3616644}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solution==

A solution was developed by [[James Mercer (mathematician)|James Mercer]] in 1923.&lt;ref name=Darling /&gt; This solution involves drawing one additional line, and then making repeated use of the fact that the internal angles of a triangle add up to 180° to prove that several triangles drawn within the large triangle are all isosceles.

::Draw &lt;math&gt;BG&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;20^\circ&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;BC&lt;/math&gt; intersecting &lt;math&gt;AC&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and draw &lt;math&gt;FG.&lt;/math&gt; (See figure on the lower right.)

::Since &lt;math&gt;\angle{BCG}=80^\circ&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\angle{CBG}=20^\circ&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\angle{BGC}=80^\circ&lt;/math&gt; and triangle &lt;math&gt;BCG&lt;/math&gt; is isosceles with &lt;math&gt;BC=BG.&lt;/math&gt;

::Since &lt;math&gt;\angle{BCF}=50^\circ&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\angle{CBF}=80^\circ&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\angle{BFC}=50^\circ&lt;/math&gt; and triangle &lt;math&gt;BCF&lt;/math&gt; is isosceles with &lt;math&gt;BC=BF.&lt;/math&gt;

::Since &lt;math&gt;\angle{FBG}=60^\circ&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;BF=BG&lt;/math&gt; then triangle &lt;math&gt;BGF&lt;/math&gt; is [[equilateral]].

::Since &lt;math&gt;\angle{BGE}=100^\circ&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\angle{GBE}=40^\circ&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\angle{GEB}=40^\circ&lt;/math&gt; and triangle &lt;math&gt;BGE&lt;/math&gt; is isosceles with &lt;math&gt;GB=GE.&lt;/math&gt;

::Therefore all the red lines in the figure are equal.

::Since &lt;math&gt;GE=GF&lt;/math&gt; triangle &lt;math&gt;EFG&lt;/math&gt; is isosceles with &lt;math&gt;\angle{GEF}=70^\circ.&lt;/math&gt;

::Therefore &lt;math&gt;\angle{BEF}=30^\circ.&lt;/math&gt;

Many other solutions are possible.  Cut the Knot list twelve different solutions and several alternative problems with the same 80-80-20 triangle but different internal angles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cut-the-knot.org/triangle/80-80-20/index.shtml|title=The 80-80-20 Triangle|last=Bogomolny|first=Alexander|authorlink= Alexander Bogomolny |website=www.cut-the-knot.org|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalization==
[[File:Int quadrangle.jpg|thumb|adventitious quadrangles problem]]
A quadrilateral such as BCEF in which the angles formed by the diagonals with the sides are all [[Rational number|rational]] (when measured in degrees) is called an '''adventitious quadrangle'''. Numerous constructions for other adventitious quadrangles beyond the one appearing in Langley's puzzle are known. They form several infinite families and an additional set of sporadic examples.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{citation

Classifying the adventitious quadrangles (which need not be convex) turns out to be equivalent to classifying all triple intersections of diagonals in regular polygons. This was solved by [[Gerrit Bol]] in 1936 (Beantwoording van prijsvraag # 17, Nieuw-Archief voor Wiskunde 18,  pages 14-66). He in fact classified (though with a few errors) all multiple intersections of diagonals in regular polygons. His results (all done by hand!) were confirmed with computer, and the errors corrected, by Bjorn Poonen and Michael Rubinstein in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

These ratios are often reported using the value calculated for the [[Sun]] as a baseline ratio which is a constant &lt;math&gt;\Upsilon_\odot&lt;/math&gt; = 5133 [[kilogram|kg]]/[[Watt|W]] equal to a [[solar mass]] ({{Solar mass|link=y}}) divided by a [[solar luminosity]] ({{Solar luminosity|link=y}}), ({{Solar mass}}/{{Solar luminosity}}). The mass to light ratios of galaxies and clusters are all much greater than &lt;math&gt;\Upsilon_\odot&lt;/math&gt; due in part to the fact that most of the [[matter]] in these objects does not reside within stars and observations suggest that a large fraction is present in the form of [[dark matter]].

Luminosities are obtained from [[photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] observations, correcting the observed [[brightness]] of the object for the [[cosmic distance ladder|distance dimming]] and [[interstellar extinction|extinction]] effects. In general, unless a complete [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] of the [[Electromagnetic radiation|radiation]] emitted by the object is obtained, a model must be extrapolated through either [[power law]] or [[blackbody]] fits. The luminosity thus obtained is known as the [[bolometric luminosity]].

Masses are often calculated from the dynamics of the [[virial theorem|virialized system]] or from [[gravitational lens]]ing. Typical mass to light ratios for galaxies range from 2 to 10 &lt;math&gt;\Upsilon_\odot&lt;/math&gt; while on the largest scales, the mass to light ratio of the [[observable universe]] is approximately 100 &lt;math&gt;\Upsilon_\odot&lt;/math&gt;, in concordance with the [[Lambda-CDM model|current best fit cosmological model]].

'''Maximum-entropy random graph models''' are [[random graph]] models used to study [[complex networks]] subject to the [[principle of maximum entropy]] under a set of structural constraints

==Overview==
Any random graph model (at a fixed set of parameter values) results in a [[probability distribution]] on [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s, and those that are maximum [[entropy]] within the considered class of distributions have the special property of being maximally [[unbiased]] [[Null_model|null models]] for network inference&lt;ref name="van der Hoorn"&gt;{{cite news

|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. [[Biological_network_inference|biological network inference]]). Each model defines a family of probability distributions on the set of graphs of size &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; (for each &lt;math&gt;n&gt;n_0&lt;/math&gt; for some finite &lt;math&gt;n_0&lt;/math&gt;), parameterized by a collection of constraints on &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; observables &lt;math&gt;\{Q_j(G)\}_{j=1}^J&lt;/math&gt; defined for each graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; (such as fixed expected average [[degree (graph theory)|degree]], [[degree distribution]] of a particular form, or specific [[Degree_(graph_theory)#Degree_sequence|degree sequence]]), enforced in the graph distribution alongside entropy maximization by the [[method of Lagrange multipliers]]. Note that in this context "maximum entropy" refers not to the [[graph entropy|entropy of a single graph]], but rather the entropy of the whole probabilistic ensemble of random graphs.

Several commonly studied random network models are in fact maximum entropy, for example the [[Erdos-Renyi model|ER]] graphs &lt;math&gt;G(n,m)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G(n,p)&lt;/math&gt; (which each have one global constraint on the number of edges), as well as the [[configuration model]] (CM).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Networks: An Introduction - Oxford Scholarship|last=Newman|first=Mark|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199206650.001.0001|year = 2010|isbn = 9780199206650|url = http://cds.cern.ch/record/1281254|format = Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soft configuration model (SCM) (which each have &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; local constraints, one for each nodewise degree-value).

Suppose we are building a random graph model consisting of a probability distribution &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}(G)&lt;/math&gt; on the set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}_n&lt;/math&gt; of [[Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#Simple_graph|simple graphs]] with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices. The  [[Entropy_(statistical_thermodynamics)#Gibbs_entropy_formula|Gibbs entropy]] &lt;math&gt;S[G]&lt;/math&gt; of this ensemble will be given by

:      &lt;math&gt; S[G]=-\sum_{G\in \mathcal{G}_n}\mathbb{P}(G)\log\mathbb{P}(G).&lt;/math&gt;

We would like the ensemble-averaged values &lt;math&gt;\{\langle Q_j \rangle\}_{j=1}^J&lt;/math&gt; of observables &lt;math&gt;\{Q_j(G)\}_{j=1}^J&lt;/math&gt; (such as average [[Degree_(graph_theory)|degree]], average [[Clustering_coefficient|clustering]], or [[Average_path_length|average shortest path length]]) to be tunable, so we impose &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; "soft" constraints on the graph distribution:

:      &lt;math&gt; \langle Q_j \rangle = \sum_{G\in \mathcal{G}_n}\mathbb{P}(G)Q_j(G) = q_j, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;j=1,...,J&lt;/math&gt; label the constraints. Application of the method of Lagrange multipliers to determine the distribution &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}(G)&lt;/math&gt; that maximizes &lt;math&gt;S[G]&lt;/math&gt; while satisfying &lt;math&gt;\langle Q_j \rangle=q_j&lt;/math&gt;, and the normalization condition &lt;math&gt;\sum_{G\in \mathcal{G}_n}\mathbb{P}(G)=1&lt;/math&gt; results in the following:&lt;ref name="Park"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

:      &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{P}(G) = \frac{1}{Z}\exp\left[-\sum_{j=1}^J\psi_j Q_j(G)\right],&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is a normalizing constant (the [[Partition function (mathematics)|partition function]]) and &lt;math&gt;\{\psi_j\}_{j=1}^J&lt;/math&gt; are parameters (Lagrange multipliers) coupled to the correspondingly indexed graph observables, which may be tuned to yield graph samples with desired values of those properties, on average; the result is an exponential family and [[canonical ensemble]]; specificially yielding an [[exponential random graph model|ERGM]].

==The Erdős–Rényi model &lt;math&gt;G(n,m)&lt;/math&gt;==

In the canonical framework above, constraints were imposed on ensemble-averaged quantities &lt;math&gt;\langle Q_j \rangle&lt;/math&gt;. Although these properties will on average take on values specifiable by appropriate setting of &lt;math&gt;\{\psi_j\}_{j=1}^J&lt;/math&gt;, each specific instance &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; may have &lt;math&gt;Q_j(G)\ne q_j&lt;/math&gt;, which may be undesirable. Instead, we may impose a much stricter condition: every graph with nonzero probability must satisfy &lt;math&gt;Q_j(G)= q_j&lt;/math&gt; exactly. Under these "sharp" constraints, the maximum-entropy distribution is determined. We exemplify this with the Erdős–Rényi model &lt;math&gt;G(n,m)&lt;/math&gt;.

The sharp constraint in &lt;math&gt;G(n,m)&lt;/math&gt; is that of a fixed number of [[Glossary_of_graph_theory_terms#edge|edges]] &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="ER"&gt;{{cite journal

This restricts the sample space from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}_n&lt;/math&gt; (all graphs on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices) to the subset &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}_{n,m}=\{g\in\mathcal{G}_n;|\operatorname E(g)|=m\}\subset \mathcal{G}_n&lt;/math&gt;. This is in direct analogy to the [[microcanonical ensemble]] in classical [[statistical mechanics]], wherein the system is restricted to a thin manifold in the [[phase space]] of all states of a particular [[energy]] value. 

Upon restricting our sample space to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}_{n,m}&lt;/math&gt;, we have no external constraints (besides normalization) to satisfy, and thus we'll select &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}_{n,m}(G)&lt;/math&gt; to maximize &lt;math&gt;S[G]&lt;/math&gt; without making use of Lagrange multipliers. It is well-known that the entropy-maximizing distribution in the absence of external constraints is the [[Discrete_uniform_distribution|uniform distribution]] over the sample space (see [[maximum entropy probability distribution]]), from which we obtain:

:      &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}_{n,m}(G)=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{G}_{n,m}|}=\binom{\binom{n}{2}}{m}^{-1},&lt;/math&gt;

where the last expression in terms of [[binomial coefficients]] is the number of ways to place &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; edges among &lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{2}&lt;/math&gt; possible [[Edge (graph theory)|edges]], and thus is the [[cardinality]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}_{n,m}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Generalizations==
A variety of maximum-entropy ensembles have been studied on generalizations of simple graphs. These include, for example, ensembles of simplicial complexes

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1799">The '''Mishnat ha-Middot''' ({{lang-he|מִשְׁנַת הַמִּדּוֹת}}; "treatise of measures") is considered the earliest known Hebrew treatise on geometry. The treatise was discovered in the [[Munich Library]] by [[Moritz Steinschneider]], who dated it between 800 and 1200 C.E. [[Hermann Schapira]] argued the treatise dates from an earlier period and [[Solomon Gandz]] conjectured [[Rabbi Nehemiah]] (c. 150 C.E.) to be the author. The content resembles both the work of [[Hero of Alexandria]] (c. 100 C.E.) and that of [[al-Khwārizmī]] (c. 800 C.E.) and the proponents of the earlier dating therefore see it linking [[Greek mathematics|Greek]] and Islamic mathematics.

The ''Mishnat ha-Middot'' argues against the common belief that the Bible defines the [[geometry|geometric]] ratio [[π]] (pi) as being exactly equal to 3 and defines it as 3 1/7 instead.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11833">In mathematics, a '''Misiurewicz point''' is a parameter in the [[Mandelbrot set]] (the [[parameter space]] of quadratic polynomials) for which the [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]&lt;!-- Term is undefined in this context --&gt; is strictly preperiodic (i.e., it becomes periodic after finitely many iterations but is not periodic itself). By analogy, the term ''Misiurewicz point'' is also used for parameters in a [[Multibrot set]] where the unique critical point is strictly preperiodic. (This term makes less sense for maps in greater generality that have more than one (free) critical point because some critical points might be periodic and others not.)

==Mathematical notation ==
A parameter &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a Misiurewicz point &lt;math&gt;M_{k,n} &lt;/math&gt; if it satisfies the equations
:&lt;math&gt;f_c^{(k)}(z_{cr}) = f_c^{(k+n)}(z_{cr}) &lt;/math&gt;

and 
:&lt;math&gt; f_c^{(k-1)}(z_{cr}) \neq f_c^{(k+n-1)}(z_{cr})&lt;/math&gt;

so :
:&lt;math&gt;M_{k,n} = c : f_c^{(k)}(z_{cr}) = f_c^{(k+n)}(z_{cr}) &lt;/math&gt;

where :
* &lt;math&gt;z_{cr} &lt;/math&gt; is a [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]] of &lt;math&gt;f_c&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are positive integers,
* &lt;math&gt; f_c^{k} &lt;/math&gt; denotes the &lt;math&gt; k&lt;/math&gt;-th iterate of &lt;math&gt; f_c&lt;/math&gt;.

==Name==
Misiurewicz points are named  after the Polish-American [[mathematician]] [[Michał Misiurewicz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.iupui.edu/~mmisiure/ Michał Misiurewicz home page], Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that the term "Misiurewicz point" is used ambiguously: Misiurewicz originally investigated maps in which all critical points were non-recurrent (that is, there is a neighborhood of every critical point that is not visited by the orbit of this critical point), and this meaning is firmly established in the context of dynamics of iterated interval maps.&lt;ref&gt;Wellington de Melo, Sebastian van Strien, "One-dimensional dynamics". Monograph, Springer Verlag (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; The case that for a quadratic polynomial the unique critical point is strictly preperiodic is only a very special case; in this restricted sense (as described above) this term is used in complex dynamics; a more appropriate term would be '''Misiurewicz–Thurston points''' (after [[William Thurston]], who investigated postcritically finite rational maps).

==Synonyms==
* hub ( in case of branch point)

==Quadratic maps==
A [[complex quadratic polynomial]] has only  one critical point. By a suitable [[conjugacy class|conjugation]] any quadratic polynomial can be transformed into a map of the form &lt;math&gt; P_c(z)=z^2+c &lt;/math&gt; which has a single critical point at &lt;math&gt; z = 0&lt;/math&gt;. The Misiurewicz points of this family of maps are [[root of a function|roots]] of the equations

:&lt;math&gt;P_c^{(k)}(0) = P_c^{(k+n)}(0)&lt;/math&gt;,

(subject to the condition that the critical point is not periodic), 
where :
*''k'' is the pre-period
*''n'' is the period
*&lt;math&gt;P_c^{(n)} = P_c ( P_c^{(n-1)})&lt;/math&gt; denotes  the ''n''-fold [[Function composition|composition]] of &lt;math&gt;P_c(z)=z^2+c&lt;/math&gt; with itself i.e. the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; [[Iterated function|iteration]] of &lt;math&gt;P_c&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, the Misiurewicz points with ''k''=2 and ''n''=1, denoted by ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2,1&lt;/sub&gt;, are roots of

:&lt;math&gt;P_c^{(2)}(0) = P_c^{(3)}(0)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow c^2+c=(c^2+c)^2+c&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow c^4+2c^3=0&lt;/math&gt;.

The root ''c''=0 is not a Misiurewicz point because the critical point is a [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] when ''c''=0, and so is periodic rather than pre-periodic. This leaves a single Misiurewicz point ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2,1&lt;/sub&gt; at ''c'' = &amp;minus;2.

===Properties of Misiurewicz points of  complex quadratic mapping===
Misiurewicz points belong to the [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] of the [[Mandelbrot set]]. Misiurewicz points are [[Dense set|dense]] in the [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] of the [[Mandelbrot set]].&lt;ref name=Douady&gt;Adrien Douady, John Hubbard, "Etude dynamique des polynômes complexes", prépublications mathématiques d'Orsay, 1982/1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schleicher&gt;Dierk Schleicher, "On Fibers and Local Connectivity of Mandelbrot and Multibrot Sets", in: M. Lapidus, M. van Frankenhuysen (eds): Fractal Geometry and Applications: A Jubilee of Benoît Mandelbrot. Proceedings of Symposia in Pure Mathematics 72, American Mathematical Society (2004), 477–507 or [https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9902155 online paper from arXiv.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a Misiurewicz point, then the associated [[filled Julia set]] is equal to the [[Julia set]], and means the [[filled Julia set]] has no [[Interior (topology)|interior]].

If &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a Misiurewicz point, then in the corresponding Julia set all periodic cycles are repelling (in particular the cycle that the critical orbit falls onto).

The [[Mandelbrot set]] and [[Julia set]] &lt;math&gt;J_c&lt;/math&gt; are locally asymptotically [[self-similarity|self-similar]] around Misiurewicz points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.cmp/1104201823 Lei.pdf]  [[Tan Lei]], "Similarity between the Mandelbrot set and Julia Sets", Communications in Mathematical Physics 134 (1990), pp. 587-617.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Types====
Misiurewicz points can be classified according to number of external rays that land on them :,&lt;ref name=Douady/&gt; points where branches meet
* branch points  ( =  points that disconnect the Mandelbrot set into at least three components.) with 3 or more [[external ray|external arguments ( angles )]]
* non-branch points  with exactly 2 external arguments ( = interior points of arcs within the Mandelbrot set) : these points are less conspicuous and thus not so easily to find on pictures.
* end points with  1 external argument ( branch tips )

According to the Branch Theorem of the Mandelbrot set,&lt;ref name=Schleicher/&gt; all branch points of the Mandelbrot set are Misiurewicz points (plus, in a combinatorial sense, hyperbolic components represented by their centers).&lt;ref name=Douady/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schleicher/&gt;

Many (actually, most) Misiurewicz parameters in the Mandelbrot set look like `centers of spirals'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://classes.yale.edu/fractals/MandelSet/MandelBoundary/Mis.html The boundary of the Mandelbrot set] by Michael Frame, Benoit Mandelbrot, and Nial Neger&lt;/ref&gt; The explanation for this is the following: at a Misiurewicz parameter, the critical value jumps onto a repelling periodic cycle after finitely many iterations; at each point on the cycle, the Julia set is asymptotically self-similar by a complex multiplication by the derivative of this cycle. If the derivative is non-real, then this implies that the Julia set, near the periodic cycle, has a spiral structure. A similar spiral structure thus occurs in the Julia set near the critical value and, by [[Tan Lei]]'s aforementioned theorem, also in the Mandelbrot set near any Misiurewicz parameter for which the repelling orbit has non-real multiplier. Depending on the value of the multiplier, the spiral shape can seem more or less pronounced. The number of the arms at the spiral equals the number of branches at the Misiurewicz parameter, and this equals the number of branches at the critical value in the Julia set. (Even the `principal Misiurewicz point in the 1/3-limb', at the end of the parameter rays at angles 9/56, 11/56, and 15/56, turns out to be asymptotically a spiral, with infinitely many turns, even though this is hard to see without maginification.)

====External arguments====
[[External ray|External arguments]] of Misiurewicz points,  measured in [[Turn (geometry)|turns]] are :
{{unordered list
|1= [[rational numbers]]
|2= [[Fraction (mathematics)#Vulgar.2C proper.2C and improper fractions|proper fraction]] with [[Even and odd numbers|even]] [[Vulgar fraction|denominator]]

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}_{10} = 0.5_{10} =   0.1_2 &lt;/math&gt;
*fraction with denominator &lt;math&gt; = a*2^b&lt;/math&gt; and [[repeating decimal|repeating expansion]] like :
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{6}_{10} = \frac{1}{2*3}_{10}= 0,16666..._{10} = 0.0(01)..._2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.unipa.it/~grim/21_project/CiechYeung.pdf BINARY DECIMAL NUMBERS AND DECIMAL NUMBERS OTHER THAN BASE TEN by Thomas Kim-wai YEUNG and Eric Kin-keung POON]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3632">In [[mathematics]], an '''orbit trap''' is a method of colouring [[fractal]] images based upon how close an [[iterated function|iterative function]], used to create the fractal, approaches a geometric shape, called a "trap". Typical traps are points, lines, circles, flower shapes and even raster images. Orbit traps are typically used to colour two dimensional fractals representing the complex plane.

==Examples==
[[Image:Line and point trap golden.png|322px|right|thumb|Mandelbrot set rendered using a combination of cross and point shaped orbit traps.]]

===Point based===
A point based orbit trap colours a point based upon how close a function's orbit comes to a single point, typically the origin.

===Line based===
A line based orbit trap colours a point based upon how close a function's orbit comes to one or more lines, typically vertical or horizontal (x=a or y=a lines). [[Pickover stalks]] are an example of a line based orbit trap which use two lines.

==Algorithm==

Orbit traps are typically used with the class of two-dimensional fractals based on an iterative function. A program that creates such a fractal colours each pixel, which represent discrete points in the complex plane, based upon the behaviour of those points when they pass through a function a set number of times.

The best known example of this kind of fractal is the [[Mandelbrot set]], which is based upon the function ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''c''. The most common way of colouring Mandelbrot images is by taking the number of iterations required to reach a certain bailout value and then assigning that value a colour. This is called the escape time algorithm.

A program that colours the Mandelbrot set using a point-based orbit trap will assign each pixel with a “distance” variable, that will typically be very high when first assigned:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
double distance = 10e5
&lt;/source&gt;

As the program passes the complex value through the iterative function it will check the distance between each point in the orbit and the trap point. The value of the distance variable will be the shortest distance found during the iteration:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
private double getDistance(Complex c,
                           Complex point,
                           int maxIteration)
{        
    double distance = 1e20;
    Complex z = new Complex(0, 0);
        
    for(int i=0; i&lt;maxIteration; i++)
    {
        //Perform Mandelbrot iteration
        z = z.multiply(z);
        z = z.add(c);
               
        //Set new distance dist = min( dist, |z-point| )
        Complex zMinusPoint = new Complex(z);
        zMinusPoint = zMinusPoint.subtract(point);
            
        double zMinusPointModulus = zMinusPoint.magnitude();
        if(zMinusPointModulus &lt; distance)
            distance = zMinusPointModulus;
    }
        
    return distance;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Ludwig Otto Blumenthal''' (20 July 1876 – 12 November 1944) was a [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] and professor at [[RWTH Aachen University]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Frankfurt]], [[Hesse-Nassau]]. A student of [[David Hilbert]], Blumenthal was an editor of ''[[Mathematische Annalen]]''. When the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service|Civil Service Act of 1933]] became law in 1933, after [[Enabling Act of 1933|Hitler became Chancellor]], Blumenthal was dismissed from his position at [[RWTH Aachen University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = BRILL| isbn = 978-90-04-29639-8| title = Voices from Exile: Essays in Memory of Hamish Ritchie| date = 2015-06-05|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ybG9CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-1-107-00684-3| last1 = Hoffmann| first1 = Dieter| last2 = Walker| first2 = Mark| title = The German Physical Society in the Third Reich: Physicists Between Autonomy and Accommodation| date = 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7hH8BXyl7gEC&amp;pg=PA248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blumenthal, who was of Jewish background, emigrated from the Nazis to the Netherlands, lived in [[Utrecht]] and was deported via [[Westerbork transit camp|Westerbork]] to the [[nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]], [[Concentration camp Theresienstadt|Theresienstadt]] in [[Bohemia]] (now [[Czech Republic]]), where he died.

In 1913, Blumenthal made a fundamental, though often overlooked, contribution to aerodynamics by building on [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Joukowsky's]] work to extract the [[complex number|complex]] transformation that carries the latter's name,&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930090787_1993090787.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; making it an example of [[Stigler's Law]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1601">In [[mathematical logic]] and in particular in [[model theory]], a '''potential isomorphism''' is a collection of finite [[partial isomorphism]]s between two models which satisfies certain closure conditions. Existence of a partial isomorphism entails [[Elementarily equivalent|elementary equivalence]], however the converse is not generally true, but it holds for [[Saturated model|ω-saturated models]].

== Definition ==
A '''potential isomorphism''' between two models ''M'' and ''N'' is a non-empty collection ''F'' of finite partial isomorphisms between ''M'' and ''N'' which satisfy the following two properties:

* for all finite partial isomorphisms ''Z'' ∈ ''F'' and for all ''x'' ∈ ''M'' there is a ''y'' ∈ ''N'' such that ''Z'' ∪ {(''x'',''y'')} ∈ ''F''
* for all finite partial isomorphisms ''Z'' ∈ ''F'' and for all ''y'' ∈ ''N'' there is a ''x'' ∈ ''M'' such that ''Z'' ∪ {(''x'',''y'')} ∈ ''F''

A notion of [[Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé game]] is an exact characterisation of elementary equivalence and potential isomorphism can be seen as an approximation of it. Another notion that is similar to potential isomorphism is that of [[local isomorphism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12760">{{Hatnote|This page is about the formal concept in theoretical computer science. For the common meaning of this term, see [[Pseudorandom number generator]].}}

In [[theoretical computer science]] and [[cryptography]], a '''pseudorandom generator (PRG)''' for a class of [[statistical test]]s is a [[deterministic algorithm|deterministic procedure]] that maps a [[random seed]] to a longer [[pseudorandom|pseudorandom string]] such that no statistical test in the class can distinguish between the output of the generator and the uniform distribution. The random seed is typically a short binary string drawn from the [[uniform distribution (discrete)|uniform distribution]].

Many different classes of statistical tests have been considered in the literature, among them the class of all Boolean circuits of a given size.
It is not known whether good pseudorandom generators for this class exist, but it is known that their existence is in a certain sense equivalent to (unproven) circuit lower bounds in [[computational complexity theory]].
Hence the construction of pseudorandom generators for the class of Boolean circuits of a given size rests on currently unproven hardness assumptions.

==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A = \{A: \{0, 1\}^n \to \{0,1\}^*\}&lt;/math&gt; be a class of functions.
These functions are the ''statistical tests'' that the pseudorandom generator will try to fool, and they are usually [[algorithms]].
Sometimes the statistical tests are also called ''adversaries'' or ''distinguishers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/893721520|title=Introduction to modern cryptography|last=Katz|first=Jonathan|others=Lindell, Yehuda|isbn=9781466570269|edition= Second |location=Boca Raton|authorlink=Jonathan Katz (computer scientist)|oclc=893721520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A function &lt;math&gt;G: \{0, 1\}^\ell\to\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\ell \leq n&lt;/math&gt; is a ''pseudorandom generator'' against &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; with ''bias'' &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; if, for every &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;, the [[total variation distance|statistical distance]] between the distributions &lt;math&gt;A(G(U_\ell))&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A(U_n)&lt;/math&gt; is at most &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;U_k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[uniform distribution (discrete)|uniform distribution]] on &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^k&lt;/math&gt;.

The quantity &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''seed length'' and the quantity &lt;math&gt;n-\ell&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''stretch'' of the pseudorandom generator.

A pseudorandom generator against a family of adversaries &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal A_n)_{n\in\N}&lt;/math&gt; with bias &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(n)&lt;/math&gt; is a family of pseudorandom generators &lt;math&gt;(G_n)_{n\in\N}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;G_n : \{0,1\}^{\ell(n)}\to\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; is a pseudorandom generator against &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A_n&lt;/math&gt; with bias &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(n)&lt;/math&gt; and seed length &lt;math&gt;\ell(n)&lt;/math&gt;.

In most applications, the family &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; represents some [[model of computation]] or some set of [[algorithm]]s, and one is interested in designing a pseudorandom generator with small seed length and bias, and such that the output of the generator can be computed by the same sort of algorithm.

==Pseudorandom generators in cryptography==
{{main|Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator}}
In [[cryptography]], the class &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; usually consists of all [[circuit complexity|circuit]]s of size polynomial in the input and with a single bit output, and one is interested in designing pseudorandom generators that are computable by a [[polynomial-time algorithm]] and whose bias is negligible in the circuit size.
These pseudorandom generators are sometimes called '''cryptographically secure pseudorandom generators (CSPRGs)'''.

It is not known if cryptographically secure pseudorandom generators exist.
Proving that they exist is difficult since their existence implies [[P versus NP problem|P ≠ NP]], which is widely believed but a famously open problem.
The existence of cryptographically secure pseudorandom generators is widely believed as well{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} and they are necessary for many applications in [[cryptography]].

The [[pseudorandom generator theorem]] shows that cryptographically secure pseudorandom generators exist if and only if [[one-way function]]s exist.

===Uses===
Pseudorandom generators have numerous applications in cryptography. For instance, pseudorandom generators provide an efficient analog of [[one-time pads]]. It is well known that in order to encrypt a message ''m'' in a way that the cipher text provides no information on the plaintext, the key ''k'' used must be random over strings of length |m|. Perfectly secure encryption is very costly in terms of key length. Key length can be significantly reduced using a pseudorandom generator if perfect security is replaced by [[semantic security]]. Common constructions of [[stream cipher]]s are based on pseudorandom generators.

Pseudorandom generators may also be used to construct [[symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric key cryptosystems]], where a large number of messages can be safely encrypted under the same key. Such a construction can be based on a [[pseudorandom function family]], which generalizes the notion of a pseudorandom generator.

In the 1980s, simulations in physics began to use pseudorandom generators to produce sequences with billions of elements, and by the late 1980s, evidence had developed that a few common generators gave incorrect results in such cases as phase transition properties of the 3D [[Ising model]] and shapes of diffusion-limited aggregates. Then in the 1990s, various idealizations of physics simulations—based on [[random walk]]s, [[correlation function]]s, localization of eigenstates, etc., were used as tests of pseudorandom generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1085|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pseudorandom generators testing===
NIST announced SP800-22 [[Randomness tests]] to test whether a pseudorandom generator produces high quality random bits. [[Yongge Wang]] showed that NIST testing is not enough to detect weak pseudorandom generators and developed statistical distance based testing technique LILtest.&lt;ref&gt;http://webpages.uncc.edu/yonwang/liltest/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pseudorandom generators for derandomization==
A main application of pseudorandom generators lies in the derandomization of computation that relies on randomness, without corrupting the result of the computation.
Physical computers are deterministic machines, and obtaining true randomness can be a challenge.
Pseudorandom generators can be used to efficiently simulate randomized algorithms with using little or no randomness.
In such applications, the class &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; describes the randomized algorithm or class of randomized algorithms that one wants to simulate, and the goal is to design an "efficiently computable" pseudorandom generator against &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; whose seed length is as short as possible.
If a full derandomization is desired, a completely deterministic simulation proceeds by replacing the random input to the randomized algorithm with the pseudorandom string produced by the pseudorandom generator.
The simulation does this for all possible seeds and averages the output of the various runs of the randomized algorithm in a suitable way.

===Constructions===

====Pseudorandom generators for polynomial time====
A fundamental question in computational complexity theory is whether all [[polynomial time]] [[randomized algorithm]]s for [[computational problem|decision problems]] can be deterministically simulated in polynomial time.  The existence of such a simulation would imply that '''BPP''' = '''P'''.  To perform such a simulation, it is sufficient to construct pseudorandom generators against the family '''F''' of all circuits of size ''s''(''n'') whose inputs have length ''n'' and output a single bit, where ''s''(''n'') is an arbitrary polynomial, the seed length of the pseudorandom generator is O(log ''n'') and its bias is ⅓.

In 1991, [[Noam Nisan]] and [[Avi Wigderson]] provided a candidate pseudorandom generator with these properties.  In 1997 [[Russell Impagliazzo]] and [[Avi Wigderson]] proved that the construction of Nisan and Wigderson is a pseudorandom generator assuming that there exists a [[computational problem|decision problem]] that can be computed in time 2&lt;sup&gt;O(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt; on inputs of length ''n'' but requires [[circuit complexity|circuits]] of size 2&lt;sup&gt;Ω(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;.

====Pseudorandom generators for logarithmic space====
While unproven assumption about circuit complexity are needed to prove that the Nisan–Wigderson generator works for time-bounded machines, it is natural to restrict the class of statistical tests further such that we need not rely on such unproven assumptions.
One class for which this has been done is the class of machines whose work space is bounded by &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt;.
Using a repeated squaring trick known as [[Savitch's theorem]], it is easy to show that every probabilistic log-space computation can be simulated in space &lt;math&gt;O(\log^2 n)&lt;/math&gt;.
[[Noam Nisan]] (1992) showed that this derandomization can actually be achieved with a pseudorandom generator of seed length &lt;math&gt;O(\log^2 n)&lt;/math&gt; that fools all &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt;-space machines.
Nisan's generator has been used by Saks and Zhou (1999) to show that probabilistic log-space computation can be simulated deterministically in space &lt;math&gt;O(\log^{1.5} n)&lt;/math&gt;.
This result is still the best known derandomization result for general log-space machines in 2012.

====Pseudorandom generators for linear functions====
{{main|small-bias sample space}}

When the statistical tests consist of all multivariate [[linear function]]s over some [[field (mathematics)|finite field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F&lt;/math&gt;, one speaks of [[small-bias sample space|epsilon-biased generators]].
The construction of {{harvtxt|Naor|Naor|1990}} achieves a seed length of &lt;math&gt;\ell= \log n + O(\log (\epsilon^{-1}))&lt;/math&gt;, which is optimal up to constant factors.
Pseudorandom generators for linear functions often serve as a building block for more complicated pseudorandom generators.

====Pseudorandom generators for polynomials====
{{main|Pseudorandom generators for polynomials}}

{{harvtxt|Viola|2008}} proves that taking the sum of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; small-bias generators fools polynomials of degree &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.
The seed length is &lt;math&gt;\ell = d \cdot \log n + O(2^d \cdot \log(\epsilon^{-1}))&lt;/math&gt;.

====Pseudorandom generators for constant-depth circuits====
[[AC0|Constant depth circuits]] that produce a single output bit.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Limitations on the probability of pseudorandom generators==
The pseudorandom generators used in cryptography and universal algorithmic derandomization have not been proven to exist, although their existence is widely believed.  Proofs for their existence would imply proofs of lower bounds on the [[circuit complexity]] of certain explicit functions. Such circuit lower bounds cannot be proved in the framework of [[natural proof]]s assuming the existence of stronger variants of cryptographic pseudorandom generators.

==Level 1==

Examples for levels 1–4 were given by Ramanujan in his 1917 paper. Given  &lt;math&gt;q=e^{2\pi i \tau}&lt;/math&gt; as in the rest of this article. Let,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
j(\tau) &amp;= \Big(\tfrac{E_4(\tau)}{\eta^8(\tau)}\Big)^3 = \tfrac{1}{q} + 744 + 196884q + 21493760q^2 +\dots\\
j^*(\tau) &amp;= 432\,\frac{\sqrt{j(\tau)}+ \sqrt{j(\tau)-1728}}{\sqrt{j(\tau)}- \sqrt{j(\tau)-1728}} = \tfrac{1}{q}  - 120 + 10260q - 901120q^2 + \dots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

with the [[j-invariant|j-function]] ''j''(''τ''), [[Eisenstein series]] ''E''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[Dedekind eta function]] ''η''(''τ''). The first expansion is the McKay–Thompson series of class 1A ({{OEIS2C|id= A007240}}) with a(0) = 744. Note that, as first noticed by [[John McKay (mathematician)|J. McKay]], the coefficient of the linear term of ''j''(''τ'') almost equals &lt;math&gt;196883&lt;/math&gt;, which is the degree of the smallest nontrivial [[irreducible representation]] of the [[Monstrous  moonshine|Monster group]]. Similar phenomena will be observed in the other levels. Define

:&lt;math&gt;s_{1A}(k)=\tbinom{2k}{k}\tbinom{3k}{k}\tbinom{6k}{3k}=1, 120, 83160, 81681600,\dots&lt;/math&gt; ({{OEIS2C|id= A001421}})

:&lt;math&gt;s_{1B}(k)=\sum_{j=0}^k\tbinom{2j}{j}\tbinom{3j}{j}\tbinom{6j}{3j}\tbinom{k+j}{k-j}(-432)^{k-j} =1, -312, 114264, -44196288,\dots&lt;/math&gt;

Then the two modular functions and sequences are related by

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty s_{1A}(k)\,\frac{1}{(j(\tau))^{k+1/2}}= \pm \sum_{k=0}^\infty s_{1B}(k)\,\frac{1}{(j^*(\tau))^{k+1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;

if the series converges and the sign chosen appropriately, though squaring both sides easily removes the ambiguity. Analogous relationships exist for the higher levels.

Examples:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\pi} = 12\,\boldsymbol{i}\,\sum_{k=0}^\infty s_{1A}(k)\,\frac{163\cdot3344418k+13591409}{(-640320^3)^{k+1/2}},\quad j\Big(\tfrac{1+\sqrt{-163}}{2}\Big)=-640320^3&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\pi} = 24\,\boldsymbol{i}\,\sum_{k=0}^\infty s_{1B}(k)\,\frac{-3669+320\sqrt{645}\,(k+\tfrac{1}{2})}{\big({-432}\,U_{645}^3\big)^{k+1/2}},\quad j^*\Big(\tfrac{1+\sqrt{-43}}{2}\Big) = -432\,U_{645}^{3}=-432\Big(\tfrac{127+5\sqrt{645}}{2}\Big)^{3}&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;U_n&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Fundamental unit (number theory)|fundamental unit]]. The first belongs to a [[Chudnovsky algorithm|family of formulas]] which were rigorously proven by the Chudnovsky brothers in 1989&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Chudnovsky|first1=David V.|author1-link=Chudnovsky brothers|last2=Chudnovsky|first2=Gregory V.|author2-link=Chudnovsky brothers|title=The Computation of Classical Constants|year=1989|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|issn=0027-8424|volume=86|issue=21|pages=8178–8182|doi=10.1073/pnas.86.21.8178|pmid=16594075|pmc=298242|jstor=34831}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
and later used to calculate 10 trillion digits of π in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=10 Trillion Digits of Pi: A Case Study of summing Hypergeometric Series to high precision on Multicore Systems|last1=Yee|first1=Alexander|last2=Kondo|first2=Shigeru|series=Technical Report|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2142/28348|year=2011|publisher=Computer Science Department, University of Illinois}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The second formula, and the ones for higher levels, was established by H.H. Chan and S. Cooper in 2012.&lt;ref name="Chan 3"/&gt;

==Level 2==

Using Zagier’s notation&lt;ref name = "Zagier" /&gt; for the modular function of level 2,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
j_{2A}(\tau) &amp;=\Big(\big(\tfrac{\eta(\tau)}{\eta(2\tau)}\big)^{12}+2^6 \big(\tfrac{\eta(2\tau)}{\eta(\tau)}\big)^{12}\Big)^2 = \tfrac{1}{q} + 104 + 4372q + 96256q^2 + 1240002q^3+\cdots \\
j_{2B}(\tau) &amp;= \big(\tfrac{\eta(\tau)}{\eta(2\tau)}\big)^{24} = \tfrac{1}{q} - 24 + 276q - 2048q^2 + 11202q^3 - \cdots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the coefficient of the linear term of ''j''&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;(''τ'') is one more than &lt;math&gt;4371&lt;/math&gt; which is the smallest degree &gt; 1 of the irreducible representations of the [[Baby Monster group#Generalized Monstrous Moonshine|Baby Monster group]]. Define,

:&lt;math&gt;s_{2A}(k)=\tbinom{2k}{k}\tbinom{2k}{k}\tbinom{4k}{2k}=1, 24, 2520, 369600, 63063000,\dots&lt;/math&gt; ({{OEIS2C|id= A008977}})

:&lt;math&gt;s_{2B}(k)=\sum_{j=0}^k\tbinom{2j}{j}\tbinom{2j}{j}\tbinom{4j}{2j}\tbinom{k+j}{k-j}(-64)^{k-j}=1, -40, 2008, -109120, 6173656,\dots&lt;/math&gt;

Then,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty s_{2A}(k)\,\frac{1}{(j_{2A}(\tau))^{k+1/2}}= \pm \sum_{k=0}^\infty s_{2B}(k)\,\frac{1}{(j_{2B}(\tau))^{k+1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;

if the series converges and the sign chosen appropriately.

Examples:

The first formula, found by Ramanujan and mentioned at the start of the article, belongs to a family proven by D. Bailey and the [[Jonathan Borwein|Borwein brothers]] in a 1989 paper.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Borwein|J.M. Borwein]], [[Peter Borwein|P.B. Borwein]] and D.H.

===Modular functions===

In 2002, Sato&lt;ref name="Sato"/&gt; established the first results for level &gt; 4. It involved [[Apéry's theorem|Apéry numbers]] which were first used to establish the irrationality of &lt;math&gt;\zeta(3)&lt;/math&gt;. First, define,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}j_{6A}(\tau) &amp;=j_{6B}(\tau)+\tfrac{1}{j_{6B}(\tau)}-2 = j_{6C}(\tau)+\tfrac{64}{j_{6C}(\tau)}+16 = j_{6D}(\tau)+\tfrac{81}{j_{6D}(\tau)}+14 =\tfrac{1}{q} + 10 + 79q + 352q^2 +\dots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}j_{6B}(\tau) &amp;= \Big(\tfrac{\eta(2\tau)\eta(3\tau)}{\eta(\tau)\eta(6\tau)}\Big)^{12}=\tfrac{1}{q} + 12 + 78q + 364q^2 + 1365q^3+\dots

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}j_{6D}(\tau) &amp;= \Big(\tfrac{\eta(\tau)\eta(2\tau)}{\eta(3\tau)\eta(6\tau)}\Big)^{4}=\tfrac{1}{q} -4 - 2q + 28q^2 - 27q^3 - 52q^4+\dots\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}j_{6E}(\tau) &amp;= \Big(\tfrac{\eta(2\tau)\eta^3(3\tau)}{\eta(\tau)\eta^3(6\tau)}\Big)^{3}=\tfrac{1}{q} +3 + 6q + 4q^2 - 3q^3 - 12q^4 +\dots\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

J. Conway and S. Norton showed&lt;ref&gt;J. Conway and S. Norton, "Monstrous Moonshine", p.319, http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.103.3704&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt; there are linear relations between the McKay–Thompson series ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, one of which was,

:&lt;math&gt;T_{6A}-T_{6B}-T_{6C}-T_{6D}+2T_{6E} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

or using the above eta quotients ''j''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;j_{6A}-j_{6B}-j_{6C}-j_{6D}+2j_{6E} = 22&lt;/math&gt;

===α Sequences===

For the modular function '''''j''&lt;sub&gt;6A&lt;/sub&gt;''', one can associate it with ''three'' different sequences. (A similar situation happens for the level 10 function '''''j''&lt;sub&gt;10A&lt;/sub&gt;'''.) Let,

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_1(k)=\tbinom{2k}{k}\sum_{j=0}^k \tbinom{k}{j}^3 =1, 4, 60, 1120, 24220,\dots&lt;/math&gt; ({{OEIS2C|id= A181418}}, labeled as ''s''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; in Cooper's paper)

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_2(k)=\tbinom{2k}{k}\sum_{j=0}^k \tbinom{k}{j}\sum_{m=0}^j\tbinom{j}{m}^3=\tbinom{2k}{k}\sum_{j=0}^k \tbinom{k}{j}^2\tbinom{2j}{j} =1, 6, 90, 1860, 44730,\dots&lt;/math&gt; ({{OEIS2C|id= A002896}})

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_3(k)=\tbinom{2k}{k}\sum_{j=0}^k \tbinom{k}{j}(-8)^{k-j}\sum_{m=0}^j\tbinom{j}{m}^3 =1, -12, 252, -6240, 167580, -4726512,\dots&lt;/math&gt;

which, respectively, is the product of the [[central binomial coefficient]]s &lt;math&gt;c(k)=\tbinom{2k}{k}&lt;/math&gt; with the [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FranelNumber.html Franel numbers], {{OEIS2C|id=A002893}}, and (-1)^k {{OEIS2C|id=A093388}}. Note that the second sequence, ''α''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''k'') is the number of 2n-step polygons on a [[Integer_lattice|cubic lattice]]. Their complements,

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha'_2(k)=\tbinom{2k}{k}\sum_{j=0}^k \tbinom{k}{j}(-1)^{k-j}\sum_{m=0}^j\tbinom{j}{m}^3 =1, 2, 42, 620, 12250,\dots&lt;/math&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha'_3(k)=\tbinom{2k}{k}\sum_{j=0}^k \tbinom{k}{j}(8)^{k-j}\sum_{m=0}^j\tbinom{j}{m}^3 =1, 20, 636, 23840, 991900,\dots&lt;/math&gt;

There are also associated sequences, namely the Apéry numbers,

:&lt;math&gt;s_{6B}(k)=\sum_{j=0}^k \tbinom{k}{j}^2\tbinom{k+j}{j}^2 =1, 5, 73, 1445, 33001,\dots&lt;/math&gt; ({{OEIS2C|id= A005259}})

the Domb numbers (unsigned) or the number of 2''n''-step polygons on a [[Diamond_cubic#Mathematical_structure|diamond lattice]],

:&lt;math&gt;s_{6C}(k)=(-1)^k \sum_{j=0}^k \tbinom{k}{j}^2 \tbinom{2(k-j)}{k-j} \tbinom{2j}{j} =1, -4, 28, -256, 2716,\dots&lt;/math&gt; ({{OEIS2C|id= A002895}})

and the Almkvist-Zudilin numbers,

:&lt;math&gt;s_{6D}(k)=\sum_{j=0}^k (-1)^{k-j}\,3^{k-3j}\,\tfrac{(3j)!}{j!^3} \tbinom{k}{3j} \tbinom{k+j}{j} =1, -3, 9, -3, -279, 2997,\dots&lt;/math&gt; ({{OEIS2C|id= A125143}})

===Identities===

The modular functions can be related as,

:&lt;math&gt; P = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \alpha_1(k)\,\frac{1}{\big(j_{6A}(\tau)\big)^{k+1/2}} =  \sum_{k=0}^\infty \alpha_2(k)\,\frac{1}{\big(j_{6A}(\tau)+4\big)^{k+1/2}} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \alpha_3(k)\,\frac{1}{\big(j_{6A}(\tau)-32\big)^{k+1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; Q = \sum_{k=0}^\infty s_{6B}(k)\,\frac{1}{\big(j_{6B}(\tau)\big)^{k+1/2}}= \sum_{k=0}^\infty s_{6C}(k)\,\frac{1}{\big(j_{6C}(\tau)\big)^{k+1/2}}= \sum_{k=0}^\infty s_{6D}(k)\,\frac{1}{\big(j_{6D}(\tau)\big)^{k+1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;

if the series converges and the sign chosen appropriately. It can also be observed that,

:&lt;math&gt;P = Q = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \alpha'_2(k)\,\frac{1}{\big(j_{6A}(\tau)-4\big)^{k+1/2}} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \alpha'_3(k)\,\frac{1}{\big(j_{6A}(\tau)+32\big)^{k+1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;

which implies,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty \alpha_2(k)\,\frac{1}{\big(j_{6A}(\tau)+4\big)^{k+1/2}} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \alpha'_2(k)\,\frac{1}{\big(j_{6A}(\tau)-4\big)^{k+1/2}} &lt;/math&gt;

and similarly using α&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and α'&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Examples===

One can use a value for '''''j''&lt;sub&gt;6A&lt;/sub&gt;''' in three ways. For example, starting with,

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta=j_{6A}\Big(\sqrt{\tfrac{-17}{6}}\Big)=198^2-4=(140\sqrt{2})^2&lt;/math&gt;

and noting that &lt;math&gt;3\times17=51&lt;/math&gt; then,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{1}{\pi} &amp;= \frac{24\sqrt{3}}{35}\,\sum_{k=0}^\infty \alpha_1(k)\,\frac{51\cdot11k+53}{(\Delta)^{k+1/2}}\\
\frac{1}{\pi} &amp;= \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{99}\,\sum_{k=0}^\infty \alpha_2(k)\,\frac{17\cdot560k+899}{(\Delta+4)^{k+1/2}}\\
\frac{1}{\pi} &amp;= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\,\sum_{k=0}^\infty \alpha_3(k)\,\frac{770k+73}{(\Delta-32)^{k+1/2}}\\ 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

as well as,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{1}{\pi} &amp;= \frac{12\sqrt{3}}{9799}\,\sum_{k=0}^\infty \alpha'_2(k)\,\frac{11\cdot51\cdot560k+29693}{(\Delta-4)^{k+1/2}}\\
\frac{1}{\pi} &amp;= \frac{6\sqrt{3}}{613}\,\sum_{k=0}^\infty \alpha'_3(k)\,\frac{51\cdot770k+3697}{(\Delta+32)^{k+1/2}}\\ 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

though the formulas using the complements apparently do not yet have a rigorous proof. For the other modular functions,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\pi} = 8\sqrt{15}\,\sum_{k=0}^\infty s_{6B}(k)\,\Big(\tfrac{1}{2}-\tfrac{3\sqrt{5}}{20}+k\Big)\Big(\frac{1}{\phi^{12}}\Big)^{k+1/2},
\quad j_{6B}\Big(\sqrt{\tfrac{-5}{6}}\Big)=\Big(\tfrac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\Big)^{12}=\phi^{12}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\pi} = \frac{1}{2}\,\sum_{k=0}^\infty s_{6C}(k)\,\frac{3k+1}{32^k},
\quad j_{6C}\Big(\sqrt{\tfrac{-1}{3}}\Big)=32&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\pi} = 2\sqrt{3}\,\sum_{k=0}^\infty s_{6D}(k)\,\frac{4k+1}{81^{k+1/2}},
\quad j_{6D}\Big(\sqrt{\tfrac{-1}{2}}\Big)=81&lt;/math&gt;

==Level 7==

Define

:&lt;math&gt;s_{7A}(k)=\sum_{j=0}^k \tbinom{k}{j}^2\tbinom{2j}{k}\tbinom{k+j}{j} =1, 4, 48, 760, 13840,\dots&lt;/math&gt; ({{OEIS2C|id= A183204}})

and,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
j_{7A}(\tau) &amp;=\Big(\big(\tfrac{\eta(\tau)}{\eta(7\tau)}\big)^{2}+7 \big(\tfrac{\eta(7\tau)}{\eta(\tau)}\big)^{2}\Big)^2=\tfrac{1}{q} +10 + 51q + 204q^2 +681q^3+\dots\\
j_{7B}(\tau)&amp;=\big(\tfrac{\eta(\tau)}{\eta(7\tau)}\big)^{4}= \tfrac{1}{q}- 4 + 2q + 8q^2 - 5q^3 - 4q^4 - 10q^5 + \dots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Example:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\pi} = \frac{3}{22^3}\,\sum_{k=0}^\infty s_{7A}(k)\, \frac{11895k+1286}{(-22^3)^{k}},
\quad j_{7A}\Big(\tfrac{7+\sqrt{-427}}{14}\Big) = -22^3+1 = -(39\sqrt{7})^2&lt;/math&gt;

No pi formula has yet been found using '''''j'''''&lt;sub&gt;7B&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Level 8==
Define,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
j_{4B}(\tau)&amp;=\big(j_{2A}(2\tau)\big)^{1/2}=\tfrac{1}{q} + 52q + 834q^3 + 4760q^5 + 24703q^7+\dots\\
&amp;= \Big(\big(\tfrac{\eta(\tau)\,\eta^2(4\tau)}{\eta^2(2\tau)\,\eta(8\tau)}\big)^{4}+4 \big(\tfrac{\eta^2(2\tau)\,\eta(8\tau)}{\eta(\tau)\,\eta^2(4\tau)}\big)^{4}\Big)^2 = \Big(\big(\tfrac{\eta(2\tau)\,\eta(4\tau)}{\eta(\tau)\,\eta(8\tau)}\big)^{4} - 4 \big(\tfrac{\eta(\tau)\,\eta(8\tau)}{\eta(2\tau)\,\eta^2(\tau)}\big)^{4}\Big)^2\\ 
j_{8A'}(\tau)&amp;=\big(\tfrac{\eta(\tau)\,\eta^2(4\tau)}{\eta^2(2\tau)\,\eta(8\tau)}\big)^{8}=\tfrac{1}{q} - 8 + 36q - 128q^2 + 386q^3 -1024q^4+\dots\\
j_{8A}(\tau)&amp;=\big(\tfrac{\eta(2\tau)\,\eta(4\tau)}{\eta(\tau)\,\eta(8\tau)}\big)^{8}=\tfrac{1}{q} + 8 + 36q + 128q^2 + 386q^3 +1024q^4+\dots.\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The expansion of the first is the McKay–Thompson series of class 4B (and is a [[square root]] of another function) while the second, if unsigned, is that of class 8A given by the third. Let,

:&lt;math&gt;s_{4B}(k)=\tbinom{2k}{k}\sum_{j=0}^k 4^{k-2j}\tbinom{k}{2j}\tbinom{2j}{j}^2 =\tbinom{2k}{k}\sum_{j=0}^k \tbinom{k}{j}\tbinom{2k-2j}{k-j}\tbinom{2j}{j}=1, 8, 120, 2240, 47320,\dots&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;s_{8A'}(k)=\sum_{j=0}^k (-1)^{k}\tbinom{k}{j}^2\tbinom{2j}{k}^2 =1, -4, 40, -544, 8536,\dots&lt;/math&gt;

where the first is the product&lt;ref name="Almkvist"/&gt; of the central binomial coefficient and a sequence related to an [[arithmetic-geometric mean]] ({{OEIS2C|id=A081085}}),

Examples:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\pi} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{13}\,\sum_{k=0}^\infty s_{4B}(k)\,\frac{70\cdot99\,k+579}{(16+396^2)^{k+1/2}},\quad j_{4B}\Big(\tfrac{1}{4}\sqrt{-58}\Big)=396^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\pi} = \frac{\sqrt{-2}}{70}\,\sum_{k=0}^\infty s_{4B}(k)\, \frac{58\cdot13\cdot99\,k + 6243}{(16-396^2)^{k+1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\pi} = 2\sqrt{2}\,\sum_{k=0}^\infty s_{8A'}(k)\,\frac{-222+377\sqrt{2}\,(k+\tfrac{1}{2})}{\big(4(1+\sqrt{2})^{12}\big)^{k+1/2}},\quad j_{8A'}\Big(\tfrac{1}{4}\sqrt{-58}\Big)=4(1+\sqrt{2})^{12},\quad j_{8A}\Big(\tfrac{1}{4}\sqrt{-58}\Big)=4(99+13\sqrt{58})^{2}=4U_{58}^2&lt;/math&gt;

though no pi formula is yet known using ''j''&lt;sub&gt;8A&lt;/sub&gt;(''τ'').

==Level 9==

Define,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
j_{3C}(\tau) &amp;= \big(j(3\tau))^{1/3} =-6+\big(\tfrac{\eta^2(3\tau)}{\eta(\tau)\,\eta(9\tau)}\big)^6 -27 \big(\tfrac{\eta(\tau)\,\eta(9\tau)}{\eta^2(3\tau)}\big)^6=\tfrac{1}{q} + 248q^2 + 4124q^5 +34752q^8+\dots\\
j_{9A}(\tau) &amp;= \big(\tfrac{\eta^2(3\tau)}{\eta(\tau)\,\eta(9\tau)}\big)^6 = \tfrac{1}{q} + 6 + 27q + 86q^2 + 243q^3 + 594q^4+\dots\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The expansion of the first is the McKay–Thompson series of class 3C (and related to the [[cube root]] of the [[j-invariant|j-function]]), while the second is that of class 9A. Let,

:&lt;math&gt;s_{3C}(k)=\tbinom{2k}{k}\sum_{j=0}^k (-3)^{k-3j}\tbinom{k}{j}\tbinom{k-j}{j}\tbinom{k-2j}{j} =\tbinom{2k}{k}\sum_{j=0}^k(-3)^{k-3j}\tbinom{k}{3j}\tbinom{2j}{j}\tbinom{3j}{j} = 1, -6, 54, -420, 630,\dots&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;s_{9A}(k)=\sum_{j=0}^k\tbinom{k}{j}^2\sum_{m=0}^j\tbinom{k}{m}\tbinom{j}{m}\tbinom{j+m}{k} =1, 3, 27, 309, 4059,\dots&lt;/math&gt;

where the first is the product of the central binomial coefficients and {{OEIS2C|id=A006077}} (though with different signs).

Examples:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\pi} = \frac{-\boldsymbol{i}}{9}\sum_{k=0}^\infty s_{3C}(k)\,\frac{602k+85}{(-960-12)^{k+1/2}},\quad j_{3C}\Big(\tfrac{3+\sqrt{-43}}{6}\Big)=-960&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\pi} = 6\,\boldsymbol{i}\,\sum_{k=0}^\infty s_{9A}(k)\,\frac{4-\sqrt{129}\,(k+\tfrac{1}{2})}{\big( -3\sqrt{3U_{129}}\big)^{k+1/2}},\quad j_{9A}\Big(\tfrac{3+\sqrt{-43}}{6}\Big)=-3\sqrt{3}\big(53\sqrt{3}+14\sqrt{43}\big) = -3\sqrt{3U_{129}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Level 10==

===Modular functions===

Define,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}j_{10A}(\tau) &amp;=j_{10B}(\tau)+\tfrac{16}{j_{10B}(\tau)}+8 = j_{10C}(\tau)+\tfrac{25}{j_{10C}(\tau)}+6 = j_{10D}(\tau)+\tfrac{1}{j_{10D}(\tau)}-2 =\tfrac{1}{q} + 4 + 22q + 56q^2 +\dots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}j_{10B}(\tau) &amp;= \Big(\tfrac{\eta(\tau)\eta(5\tau)}{\eta(2\tau)\eta(10\tau)}\Big)^{4}=\tfrac{1}{q} - 4 + 6q - 8q^2 + 17q^3 - 32q^4 +\dots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}j_{10C}(\tau) &amp;= \Big(\tfrac{\eta(\tau)\eta(2\tau)}{\eta(5\tau)\eta(10\tau)}\Big)^{2}=\tfrac{1}{q} - 2 - 3q + 6q^2 + 2q^3 + 2q^4+\dots\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}j_{10D}(\tau) &amp;= \Big(\tfrac{\eta(2\tau)\eta(5\tau)}{\eta(\tau)\eta(10\tau)}\Big)^{6}=\tfrac{1}{q} + 6 + 21q + 62q^2 + 162q^3 +\dots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}j_{10E}(\tau) &amp;= \Big(\tfrac{\eta(2\tau)\eta^5(5\tau)}{\eta(\tau)\eta^5(10\tau)}\Big)=\tfrac{1}{q} + 1 + q + 2q^2 + 2q^3 - 2q^4 +\dots\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Just like the level 6, there are also linear relations between these,

:&lt;math&gt;T_{10A}-T_{10B}-T_{10C}-T_{10D}+2T_{10E} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

or using the above eta quotients ''j''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;j_{10A}-j_{10B}-j_{10C}-j_{10D}+2j_{10E} = 6&lt;/math&gt;

===β Sequences===

Let,

:&lt;math&gt;\beta_{1}(k)=\sum_{j=0}^k \tbinom{k}{j}^4 =1, 2, 18, 164, 1810,\dots&lt;/math&gt; ({{OEIS2C|id= A005260}}, labeled as ''s''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; in Cooper's paper)

:&lt;math&gt;\beta_{2}(k)=\tbinom{2k}{k}\sum_{j=0}^k \tbinom{2j}{j}^{-1}\tbinom{k}{j}\sum_{m=0}^j \tbinom{j}{m}^4 =1, 4, 36, 424, 5716,\dots&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta_{3}(k)=\tbinom{2k}{k}\sum_{j=0}^k \tbinom{2j}{j}^{-1}\tbinom{k}{j} (-4)^{k-j}\sum_{m=0}^j \tbinom{j}{m}^4 =1, -6, 66, -876, 12786,\dots&lt;/math&gt;

their complements,

:&lt;math&gt;\beta_{2}'(k)=\tbinom{2k}{k}\sum_{j=0}^k \tbinom{2j}{j}^{-1}\tbinom{k}{j} (-1)^{k-j}\sum_{m=0}^j \tbinom{j}{m}^4 =1, 0, 12, 24, 564, 2784,\dots&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta_{3}'(k)=\tbinom{2k}{k}\sum_{j=0}^k \tbinom{2j}{j}^{-1}\tbinom{k}{j} (4)^{k-j}\sum_{m=0}^j \tbinom{j}{m}^4 =1, 10, 162, 3124, 66994,\dots&lt;/math&gt;

and,

:&lt;math&gt;s_{10B}(k)=1, -2, 10, -68, 514, -4100, 33940,\dots&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;s_{10C}(k)=1, -1, 1, -1, 1, 23, -263, 1343, -2303,\dots&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;s_{10D}(k)=1, 3, 25, 267, 3249, 42795, 594145,\dots&lt;/math&gt;

though closed-forms are not yet known for the last three sequences.

===Identities===

The modular functions can be related as,&lt;ref&gt;S. Cooper, "Level 10 analogues of Ramanujan’s series for 1/π", Theorem 4.3, p.85, J. Ramanujan Math. Soc. 27, No.1 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;U =
\sum_{k=0}^\infty \beta_1(k)\,\frac{1}{(j_{10A}(\tau))^{k+1/2}} = 
\sum_{k=0}^\infty \beta_2(k)\,\frac{1}{(j_{10A}(\tau)+4)^{k+1/2}} =
\sum_{k=0}^\infty \beta_3(k)\,\frac{1}{(j_{10A}(\tau)-16)^{k+1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;V =
\sum_{k=0}^\infty s_{10B}(k)\,\frac{1}{(j_{10B}(\tau))^{k+1/2}} = 
\sum_{k=0}^\infty s_{10C}(k)\,\frac{1}{(j_{10C}(\tau))^{k+1/2}} = 
\sum_{k=0}^\infty s_{10D}(k)\,\frac{1}{(j_{10D}(\tau))^{k+1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;

if the series converges. In fact, it can also be observed that,

:&lt;math&gt;U = V =\sum_{k=0}^\infty \beta_2'(k)\,\frac{1}{(j_{10A}(\tau)-4)^{k+1/2}} =
\sum_{k=0}^\infty \beta_3'(k)\,\frac{1}{(j_{10A}(\tau)+16)^{k+1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the exponent has a fractional part, the sign of the square root must be chosen appropriately though it is less an issue when ''j''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is positive.

===Examples===

Just like level 6,  the level 10 function '''''j''&lt;sub&gt;10A&lt;/sub&gt;''' can be used in three ways. Starting with,

:&lt;math&gt;j_{10A}\Big(\sqrt{\tfrac{-19}{10}}\Big) = 76^2&lt;/math&gt;

and noting that &lt;math&gt;5\times19=95&lt;/math&gt; then,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{1}{\pi} &amp;= \frac{5}{\sqrt{95}}\,\sum_{k=0}^\infty \beta_1(k)\,\frac{408k+47}{(76^2)^{k+1/2}}\\ 
\frac{1}{\pi} &amp;= \frac{1}{17\sqrt{95}}\,\sum_{k=0}^\infty \beta_2(k)\,\frac{19\cdot 1824k+3983}{(76^2+4)^{k+1/2}}\\
\frac{1}{\pi} &amp;= \frac{1}{6\sqrt{95}}\,\,\sum_{k=0}^\infty \beta_3(k)\,\,\frac{19\cdot 646k+1427}{(76^2-16)^{k+1/2}}\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

as well as,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{1}{\pi} &amp;= \frac{5}{481\sqrt{95}}\,\sum_{k=0}^\infty \beta_2'(k)\,\frac{19\cdot 10336k+22675}{(76^2-4)^{k+1/2}}\\
\frac{1}{\pi} &amp;= \frac{5}{181\sqrt{95}}\,\sum_{k=0}^\infty \beta_3'(k)\,\frac{19\cdot 3876k+8405}{(76^2+16)^{k+1/2}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

though the ones using the complements do not yet have a rigorous proof. A conjectured formula using one of the last three sequences is,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\pi} = \frac{\boldsymbol{i}}{\sqrt{5}}\,\sum_{k=0}^\infty s_{10C}(k)\frac{10k+3}{(-5^2)^{k+1/2}},\quad j_{10C}\Big(\tfrac{1+\,\boldsymbol{i}}{2}\Big) = -5^2&lt;/math&gt;

which implies there might be examples for all sequences of level 10.

==Level 11==

Define the McKay–Thompson series of class 11A,

:&lt;math&gt;j_{11A}(\tau)= (1+3F)^3+(\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{F}}+3\sqrt{F})^2=\tfrac{1}{q} + 6 + 17q + 46q^2 + 116q^3 +\dots&lt;/math&gt;

where,

:&lt;math&gt;F = \tfrac{\eta(3\tau)\,\eta(33\tau)}{\eta(\tau)\,\eta(11\tau)}&lt;/math&gt;

and,

:&lt;math&gt;s_{11A}(k) = 1,\, 4,\, 28,\, 268,\, 3004,\, 36784,\, 476476,\dots&lt;/math&gt;

No closed-form in terms of binomial coefficients is yet known for the sequence but it obeys the [[recurrence relation]],

:&lt;math&gt;(k + 1)^3 s_{k + 1} = 2(2k + 1)(5k^2 + 5k + 2)s_k\,-\,8k(7k^2 + 1)s_{k - 1}\,+\,22k(k - 1)(2k - 1)s_{k - 2}&lt;/math&gt;

with initial conditions ''s''(0) = 1, ''s''(1) = 4.

Example:&lt;ref name = "Cooper 2"&gt;S. Cooper, "Ramanujan’s theories of elliptic functions to alternative bases, and beyond", Askey 80 Conference, Dec 2013, http://www.math.umn.edu/~stant001/ASKEYABS/Shaun_Cooper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\pi}=\frac{\boldsymbol{i}}{22}\sum_{k=0}^\infty s_{11A}(k)\,\frac{221k+67}{(-44)^{k+1/2}},\quad j_{11A}\Big(\tfrac{1+\sqrt{-17/11}}{2}\Big)=-44&lt;/math&gt;

==Higher levels==

As pointed out by Cooper,&lt;ref name = "Cooper 2" /&gt; there are analogous sequences for certain higher levels.

==Similar series==

R. Steiner found examples using [[Catalan numbers]] &lt;math&gt;C_k &lt;/math&gt;, 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\pi} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty {(2C_{k-n})}^2 \frac{(4z)k+(2^{4(n-2)+2}-(4n-3)z)}{2^{4k}} (z \in \Z, n\ge2, n \in \N )&lt;/math&gt;
and for this a [[modular form]] with a second periodic for k exists: &lt;math&gt;k=\frac {1}{16}((-20-12\boldsymbol{i})+16n), k=\frac {1}{16}((-20+12\boldsymbol{i})+16n)&lt;/math&gt;. 
Other similar series are 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\pi} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty {(2C_{k-2})}^2 \frac{3k+\frac{1}{4}}{2^{4k}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\pi} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty {(2C_{k-1})}^2 \frac{(4z+1)k-z}{2^{4k}} (z \in \Z)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\pi} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty {(2C_{k-1})}^2 \frac{-1k+\frac{1}{2}}{2^{4k}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\pi} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty {(2C_{k-1})}^2 \frac{0k+\frac{1}{4}}{2^{4k}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\pi} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty {(2C_{k-1})}^2 \frac{{\frac{k}{5}+\frac{1}{5}}}{2^{4k}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\pi} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty {(2C_{k-1})}^2 \frac{{\frac{k}{3}+\frac{1}{6}}}{2^{4k}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\pi} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty {(2C_{k-1})}^2 \frac{{\frac{k}{2}+\frac{1}{8}}}{2^{4k}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\pi} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty {(2C_{k-1})}^2 \frac{2k-\frac{1}{4}}{2^{4k}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\pi} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty {(2C_{k-1})}^2 \frac{3k-\frac{1}{2}}{2^{4k}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\pi} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty {(2C_k)}^2 \frac{{\frac{k}{16}+\frac{1}{16}}}{2^{4k}}&lt;/math&gt;

with the last (comments in {{OEIS2C|id=A013709}}) found by using a linear combination of higher parts of [[Wallis product|Wallis]]-Lambert series for 4/Pi and Euler series for the circumference of an ellipse. 

Using the definition of Catalan numbers with the Gamma-function the first and last for example give the identities

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty {\left (\frac{\Gamma(\frac{1}{2}+k)}{\Gamma(2+k)}\right)}^2 \left(4zk-(4n-3)z+2^{4(n-2)+2}\right) (z \in \Z, n\ge2, n \in \N )&lt;/math&gt;
...
:&lt;math&gt;4 = \sum_{k=0}^\infty {\left (\frac{\Gamma(\frac{1}{2}+k)}{\Gamma(2+k)}\right)}^2 (k+1)&lt;/math&gt;.

The last is also equivalent to,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\pi} = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\binom{2k}{k}^2}{k+1}\, \frac{1}{2^{4k}}&lt;/math&gt;

and is related to the fact that,

:&lt;math&gt; \pi = \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \frac{2^{4k}}{k {2k\choose k}^2} &lt;/math&gt;

which is a consequence of [[Stirling's approximation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3301">In [[mathematics]], a '''Riemann–Roch theorem for smooth manifolds''' is a version of results such as the [[Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem]] or [[Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem]] (GRR) without a hypothesis making the [[smooth manifold]]s involved carry a [[Complex manifold|complex structure]]. Results of this kind were obtained by [[Michael Atiyah]] and [[Friedrich Hirzebruch]] in 1959, reducing the requirements to something like a [[spin structure]].

==Formulation==

Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be oriented smooth [[closed manifold]]s,
and ''f'': ''X'' &amp;rarr; ''Y'' a continuous map.
Let ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;=''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(''TY'') &amp;minus; ''TX'' in the [[K theory|K-group]] 
K(X).
If dim(X) &amp;equiv; dim(Y) mod 2, then
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ch}(f_{K*}(x)) = f_{H*}(\mathrm{ch}(x) e^{d(v_f)/2}\hat{A}(v_f)),&lt;/math&gt;
where ch is the [[Chern character]], d(v&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;) an element of 
the integral [[cohomology group]] ''H''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''Y'', ''Z'') satisfying
''d''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;equiv; ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; ''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(T''Y'')-''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(T''X'') mod 2,
f&lt;sub&gt;K*&lt;/sub&gt; the [[Gysin homomorphism]] for K-theory,
and f&lt;sub&gt;H*&lt;/sub&gt; the Gysin homomorphism for cohomology
.&lt;ref&gt;M. Karoubi, ''K-theory, an introduction'', Springer-Verlag, Berlin (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;
This theorem was first proven by Atiyah and Hirzebruch.&lt;ref&gt;M. Atiyah and F. Hirzebruch, ''Riemann–Roch theorems for differentiable manifolds'' (Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 65 (1959) 276–281)&lt;/ref&gt;

The theorem is proven by considering several special cases.&lt;ref&gt;M. Karoubi, ''K-theory, an introduction'', Springer-Verlag, Berlin (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; 
If ''Y'' is the [[Thom space]] of a vector bundle ''V'' over ''X'',
then the Gysin maps are just the Thom isomorphism.
Then, using the [[splitting principle]], it suffices to check the theorem via explicit computation for line
bundles.

If ''f'': ''X'' &amp;rarr; ''Y'' is an embedding, then the 
Thom space of the normal bundle of ''X'' in ''Y'' can be viewed as a tubular neighborhood of ''X''
in ''Y'', and excision gives a map
:&lt;math&gt;u:H^*(B(N), S(N)) \to H^*(Y, Y-B(N)) \to H^*(Y)&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;v:K(B(N), S(N)) \to K(Y, Y-B(N)) \to K(Y)&lt;/math&gt;.
The Gysin map for K-theory/cohomology is defined to be the composition of the Thom isomorphism with these maps.
Since the theorem holds for the map from ''X'' to the Thom space of ''N'',
and since the Chern character commutes with ''u'' and ''v'', the theorem is also true for embeddings.
''f'': ''X'' &amp;rarr; ''Y''.

Finally, we can factor a general map ''f'': ''X'' &amp;rarr; ''Y''
into an embedding 
:&lt;math&gt;i: X \to Y \times S^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;
and the projection
:&lt;math&gt;p: Y \times S^{2n} \to Y.&lt;/math&gt;
The theorem is true for the embedding.
The Gysin map for the projection is the Bott-periodicity isomorphism, which commutes with the Chern character,
so the theorem holds in this general case also.

==Corollaries==

Atiyah and Hirzebruch then specialised and refined in the case ''X'' = a point, where the condition becomes the existence of a spin structure on ''Y''. Corollaries are on [[Pontryagin class]]es and the [[J-homomorphism]].

      <comment>/* Erdős discrepancy problem */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4377">In mathematics, a '''sign sequence''', or '''±1&amp;ndash;sequence''' or '''bipolar sequence''', is a [[sequence]] of numbers, each of which is either 1 or −1. One example is the sequence (1, −1, 1, −1 ...).

Such sequences are commonly studied in [[discrepancy theory]].

==Erdős discrepancy problem==
&lt;!--{{Further|[[Erdős discrepancy problem]]}}--&gt;

Around 1932, mathematician [[Paul Erdős]] conjectured that for any infinite ±1-sequence &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\langle x_1, x_2, \ldots \rangle &lt;/math&gt; and any integer ''C'', there exist integers ''k'' and ''d'' such that

The Erdős Discrepancy Problem asks for a proof or disproof of this conjecture.

In February 2014, Alexei Lisitsa and Boris Konev of the [[University of Liverpool]] showed that every sequence of 1161 or more elements satisfies the conjecture in the special case ''C''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, which proves the conjecture for ''C''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = A SAT Attack on the Erdos Discrepancy Conjecture | arxiv = 1402.2184 | first1 = Boris | last1 = Konev | first2 = Alexei | last2 = Lisitsa | date = 17 Feb 2014 | bibcode = 2014arXiv1402.2184K }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the best such bound available at the time. Their proof relied on a [[SAT-solver]] computer algorithm whose output takes up 13 [[gigabytes]] of data, more than the entire text of Wikipedia at that time, so it cannot be independently verified by human mathematicians without further use of a computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25068-wikipediasize-maths-proof-too-big-for-humans-to-check.html|title=Wikipedia-size maths proof too big for humans to check|first = Jacob | last = Aron|publisher=[[New Scientist]]|date=February 17, 2014|accessdate=February 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, [[Terence Tao]] announced a proof of the conjecture, building on work done in 2010 during [[Polymath Project|Polymath5]] (a form of [[crowdsourcing]] applied to mathematics) and a suggestion made by German mathematician Uwe Stroinski on Tao's blog.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/09/28/newser-famous-math-problem-solved-crowdsourcing/72973338/ Famous math problem solved thanks to crowdsourcing].

such that
:&lt;math&gt;\left|\sum_{j=1}^{N-v} x_j x_{j+v}\right| \le 1&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="778">In mathematics, a '''supersolvable arrangement''' is a  [[Arrangement of hyperplanes|hyperplane arrangement]] which has a maximal [[Flag (linear algebra)|flag]] with only [[Modular lattice|modular]] elements.
A complex hyperplane arrangement is supersolvable if and only if its complement is fiber-type. 

Examples include arrangements associated with [[Coxeter group]]s of type A and B.

It is known that all [[Orlik–Solomon algebra]]s of supersolvable  arrangements are [[Koszul algebra]]s; whether the converse is true is an open problem.&lt;ref&gt;Sergey Yuzvinsky, Orlik–Solomon algebras in algebra and topology, Russian Math.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1576">In mathematics, the '''''n''-th symmetric power''' of an object ''X'' is the quotient of the ''n''-fold product &lt;math&gt;X^n:=X \times \cdots \times X&lt;/math&gt; by the permutation action of the [[symmetric group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{S}_n&lt;/math&gt;.

More precisely, the notion exists at least in the following three areas:
*In [[linear algebra]], the ''n''-th symmetric power of a vector space ''V'' is the vector subspace of the [[symmetric algebra]] of ''V'' consisting of degree-''n'' elements (here the product is a [[tensor product]]).
*In [[algebraic topology]], the ''n''-th symmetric power of a [[topological space]] ''X'' is the [[quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] &lt;math&gt;X^n/\mathfrak{S}_n&lt;/math&gt;, as in the beginning of this article.
*In [[algebraic geometry]], a symmetric power is defined in a way similar to that in algebraic topology. For example, if &lt;math&gt;X = \operatorname{Spec}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is an [[affine variety]], then the [[GIT quotient]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec}((A \otimes_k \dots \otimes_k A)^{\mathfrak{S}_n})&lt;/math&gt; is the ''n''-th symmetric power of ''X''.

{{Nihongo|'''Toshikazu Sunada'''|砂田 利一|Sunada Toshikazu|born September 7, 1948}} is a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[mathematician]] and author of many books and essays on mathematics and mathematical sciences. He is professor of mathematics at [[Meiji University]], [[Tokyo]], and is also professor emeritus of [[Tohoku University]], [[Tohoku]], [[Japan]]. Before he joined Meiji University in 2003, he was professor of mathematics at [[Nagoya University]] (1988–1991), at the [[University of Tokyo]] (1991–1993), and at Tohoku University (1993–2003). Sunada was involved in the creation of the School of Interdisciplinary Mathematical Sciences in Meiji University and is its first dean (2013-2017).


==Main work==
Sunada's work covers [[complex analytic geometry]], [[spectral geometry]], [[dynamical systems]], [[probability]], [[graph theory]], and discrete geometric analysis.  Among his numerous contributions, the most famous one is a general construction of isospectral manifolds (1985), which is based on his geometric model of [[number theory]], and is considered to be a breakthrough in the problem proposed by [[Mark Kac]] in "Can one hear the shape of a drum?" (see [[Hearing the shape of a drum]]). Sunada's idea was taken up by C. Gordon, D. Webb, and S. Wolpert when they constructed a counterexample for Kac's problem. For this work, Sunada was awarded the Iyanaga Prize of the [[Mathematical Society of Japan]] (MSJ) in 1987. He was also awarded Publication Prize of MSJ in 2013,  the Hiroshi Fujiwara Prize for Mathematical Sciences in 2017, and the Prize for Science and Technology (the Commendation for Science and Technology by the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology) in 2018.

In a joint work with Atsushi Katsuda, Sunada also established a geometric analogue of [[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions]] in the context of dynamical systems (1988). One can see, in this work as well as the one above, how the concepts and ideas in totally different fields (geometry, dynamical systems, and number theory) are put together to formulate problems and to produce new results.

His study of discrete geometric analysis includes a graph-theoretic interpretation of [[Ihara zeta function]]s, a discrete analogue of periodic magnetic Schrödinger operators as well as the large time asymptotic behaviors of [[random walk]] on crystal lattices. The study of random walk led him to the discovery of a "mathematical twin" of the [[diamond]] crystal out of an infinite universe of hypothetical crystals (2005). He named it the [[Laves graph|K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; crystal]] due to its mathematical relevance (see the linked article). What was noticed by him is that the K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  crystal has the "strong isotropy property", meaning that for any two vertices ''x'' and ''y'' of the crystal net, and for any ordering of the edges adjacent to ''x'' and any ordering of the edges adjacent to ''y'', there is a net-preserving congruence taking ''x'' to ''y'' and each ''x''-edge to the similarly ordered ''y''-edge. This property is shared only by the diamond crystal 
(the strong isotropy should not be confused with the [[Edge-transitive graph|edge-transitivity]] or the notion of [[symmetric graph]]; for instance, the [[Cubic crystal system|primitive cubic lattice]] is a symmetric graph, but not strongly isotropic). The K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; crystal and the diamond crystal as networks in space are examples of “standard realizations”, the notion introduced by Sunada and M. Kotani as a graph-theoretic version of Albanese maps ([[Abel-Jacobi map]]s) in [[algebraic geometry]].

For his work, see also [[Isospectral]], [[Reinhardt domain]], [[Ihara zeta function]], [[Ramanujan graph]], [[quantum ergodicity]], [[quantum walk]].

{{Refimprove|date=November 2009}}
'''Underwriting''' services are provided by some large specialist [[financial institution]]s, such as banks, insurance or investment houses, whereby they guarantee payment in case of damage or financial loss and accept the [[financial risk]] for liability arising from such guarantee. An underwriting arrangement may be created in a number of situations including insurance, issue of securities in a [[public offering]], and in bank lending, among others.

The name derives from the [[Lloyd's of London]] [[insurance]] market. Financial bankers, who would accept some of the risk on a given venture (historically a sea voyage with associated risks of shipwreck) in exchange for a [[insurance premium|premium]], would literally write their names under the risk information that was written on a Lloyd's slip created for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZCu4ctqn9OsC&amp;pg=PA25 "Underwriting: The Poetics of Insurance in America, 1722-1872"] , by Eric Wertheimer, Stanford University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Securities underwriting==
[[Security (finance)|Securities]] underwriting is the process by which [[investment banking|investment banks]] raise investment capital from investors on behalf of corporations and governments that are issuing securities (both [[ownership equity|equity]] and [[debt capital]]). The services of an underwriter are typically used during a [[public offering]] in a [[primary market]].

This is a way of distributing a newly issued security, such as stocks or bonds, to investors. A [[syndicate]] of banks (the lead managers) underwrites the transaction, which means they have taken on the risk of distributing the securities. Should they not be able to find enough investors, they will have to hold some securities themselves. Underwriters make their income from the price difference (the "[[underwriting spread]]") between the price they pay the issuer and what they collect from investors or from broker-dealers who buy portions of the offering.

===Risk, exclusivity, and reward===
Once the underwriting agreement is struck, the underwriter bears the risk of being unable to sell the underlying securities, and the cost of holding them on its books until such time in the future that they may be favorably sold.

If the instrument is desirable, the underwriter and the securities issuer may choose to enter into an exclusivity agreement. In exchange for a higher price paid upfront to the issuer, or other favorable terms, the issuer may agree to make the underwriter the exclusive agent for the initial sale of the securities instrument. That is, even though third-party buyers might approach the issuer directly to buy, the issuer agrees to sell exclusively through the underwriter.

In summary, the securities issuer gets cash up front, access to the contacts and sales channels of the underwriter, and is insulated from the market risk of being unable to sell the securities at a good price. The underwriter gets a profit from the markup, plus possibly an exclusive sales agreement.

Also if the securities are priced significantly below market price (as is often the custom), the underwriter also curries favor with powerful end customers by granting them an immediate profit (see [[flipping]]), perhaps in a [[quid pro quo]]. This practice, which is typically justified as the reward for the underwriter for taking on the market risk, is occasionally criticized as unethical, such as the allegations that [[Frank Quattrone]] acted improperly in doling out hot [[initial public offering|IPO]] stock during the [[dot com bubble]].

==Bank underwriting==
In [[banking]], underwriting is the detailed [[Credit (finance)|credit]] analysis preceding the granting of a [[loan]], based on credit information furnished by the borrower; such underwriting falls into several areas:

*Consumer loan underwriting includes the verification of such items as employment history, salary and [[financial statements]]; publicly available information, such as the borrower's credit history, which is detailed in a [[credit report]]; and the lender's evaluation of the borrower's credit needs and ability to pay. Examples include [[mortgage underwriting]].
*Commercial (or business) underwriting consists of the evaluation of financial information provided by small businesses including analysis of the business balance sheet including tangible net worth, the ratio of debt to worth (leverage) and available liquidity (current ratio).  Analysis of the income statement typically includes revenue trends, gross margin, profitability, and [[Debt Service Coverage Ratio|debt service coverage]].

Underwriting can also refer to the purchase of [[corporate bond]]s, [[commercial paper]], government securities, municipal general-obligation bonds by a [[commercial bank]] or dealer bank for its own [[Deposit account|account]] or for resale to investors. Bank underwriting of corporate securities is carried out through separate holding-company affiliates, called [[securities affiliate]]s or Section 20 affiliates.

==Insurance underwriting==
[[Insurance]] underwriters evaluate the risk and exposures of potential clients. They decide how much coverage the client should receive, how much they should pay for it, or whether even to accept the risk and insure them. Underwriting involves measuring risk exposure and determining the [[insurance premium|premium]] that needs to be charged to insure that risk. The function of the underwriter is to protect the company's [[book of business]] from risks that they feel will make a loss and issue [[Insurance contract|insurance policies]] at a premium that is commensurate with the exposure presented by a risk.

Each insurance company has its own set of underwriting guidelines to help the underwriter determine whether or not the company should accept the risk. The information used to evaluate the risk of an applicant for insurance will depend on the type of coverage involved. For example, in underwriting automobile coverage, an individual's driving record is critical. However, the type of automobile is actually far more critical. As part of the underwriting process for [[life insurance|life]] or [[health insurance]], [[medical underwriting]] may be used to examine the applicant's health status (other factors may be considered as well, such as age &amp; occupation). The factors that insurers use to classify risks are generally objective, clearly related to the likely cost of providing coverage, practical to administer, consistent with applicable law, and designed to protect the long-term viability of the insurance program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actuarialstandardsboard.org/pdf/asops/asop012_101.pdf "Risk Classification (for All Practice Areas),"] Actuarial Standard of '''Practice No. 12''', Actuarial Standards Board, December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The underwriters may decline the risk or may provide a quotation in which the premiums have been [[premium loadings|loaded]] (including the amount needed to generate a profit, in addition to covering expenses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelawdictionary.org/premium-loading/|title=What is PREMIUM LOADING? definition of PREMIUM LOADING (Black's Law Dictionary)|date=19 October 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or in which various [[exclusions (insurance)|exclusions]] have been stipulated, which restrict the circumstances under which a claim would be paid. Depending on the type of insurance product (line of business), insurance companies use automated underwriting systems to encode these rules, and reduce the amount of manual work in processing quotations and policy issuance. This is especially the case for certain simpler life or personal lines (auto, homeowners) insurance. Some insurance companies, however, rely on agents to underwrite for them. This arrangement allows an insurer to operate in a market closer to its clients without having to establish a physical presence.

Two major categories of exclusion in insurance underwriting are [[moral hazard]] and [[correlated]] losses.&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/03/353030214/bedbugs-lava-and-bowling-balls-inside-my-homeowners-insurance-policy|title=Bedbugs, Lava And Bowling Balls: Inside My Homeowners Insurance Policy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With a moral hazard, the consequences of the customer's actions are insured, making the customer more likely to take costly actions.  For example, bedbugs are typically excluded from homeowners' insurance to avoid paying for the consequence of recklessly bringing in a used mattress.&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt;  Insured events are generally those outside the control of the customer, for example (typical in life insurance) death by automobile accident, contrasted with death by suicide.  Correlated losses are those that can affect a large number of customers at the same time, thus potentially bankrupting the insurance company.  This is why typical homeowner's policies cover damage from fire or falling trees (usually affecting an individual house), but not floods or earthquakes (which affect many houses at the same time).&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt;

==Other forms==

===Real estate underwriting===
In evaluation of a real estate loan, in addition to assessing the borrower, the property itself is scrutinized. Underwriters use the [[debt service coverage ratio]] to figure out whether the property is capable of redeeming its own value.

===Forensic underwriting===
Forensic underwriting is the "after-the-fact" process used by lenders to determine what went wrong with a mortgage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20071230/REALESTATE/712300739 "Lenders scrutinize borrowers,"] ''Herald Tribune'' March 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Forensic underwriting is a borrower's ability to work out a modification scenario with their current lien holder, not to qualify them for a new loan or a refinance. This is typically done by an underwriter staffed with a team of people who are experienced in every aspect of the real estate field.

===Sponsorship underwriting===
{{Main|Underwriting spot}}
Underwriting may also refer to financial [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] of a venture, and is also used as a term within [[public broadcasting]] (both [[public television]] and [[public radio|radio]]) to describe funding given by a company or organization for the operations of the service, in exchange for a mention of their product or service within the station's programming.

===Thomson Financial league tables===
Underwriting activity in the [[mergers and acquisitions]], [[Equity (finance)|equity issuance]], [[debt]] issuance, [[syndicated loan]]s and U.S. municipal bond markets is reported in the [[Thomson Financial league tables]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thomsonreuters.com/business_units/financial/league_tables/|title=Current League Tables|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113123731/http://www.thomsonreuters.com/business_units/financial/league_tables/|archivedate=2008-11-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. quantum filtering and [[Quantum stochastic calculus#Quantum trajectories|quantum trajectories]]). The physics of continuous quantum measurements is as follows. Consider using an ancilla, e.g. a [[Cavity quantum electrodynamics|field]] or a [[Circuit quantum electrodynamics|current]], to probe a quantum system. The interaction between the system and the probe correlates the two systems. Typically the interaction only weakly correlates the system and ancilla. (Specifically, the interaction unitary need only to be expanded to first or second order in perturbation theory.) By measuring the ancilla and then using quantum measurement theory, the state of the system conditioned on the results of the measurement can be determined. In order to obtain a strong measurement, many ancilla must be coupled and then measured. In the limit where there is a continuum of ancilla the measurement process becomes continuous in time. This process was described first by:

It should be noted that the notion of a weak measurement is often misattributed to [[Yakir Aharonov|Aharonov]], [[David Albert|Albert]] and [[Lev Vaidman|Vaidman]].&lt;ref name="Aharonov1988"/&gt; In their article they consider an example of a weak measurement (and perhaps coin the phrase "weak measurement") and use it to motivate their definition of a [[weak value]], which they defined there for the first time.

== Mathematics==

There is no universally accepted definition of a weak measurement. One approach is to declare a weak measurement to be a generalized measurement where some or all of the [[Kraus operators]] are close to the identity.&lt;ref name="OreshkovBrun2005" /&gt; The approach taken below is to interact two systems weakly and then measure one of them.&lt;ref name="Wiseman and Milburn"/&gt; After detailing this approach we will illustrate it with examples.

===Weak interaction and ancilla coupled measurement===

Consider a system that starts in the [[quantum state]] &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and an ancilla that starts in the state &lt;math&gt;|\phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, the combined initial state is &lt;math&gt;|\Psi\rangle = |\psi\rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. These two systems interact via the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] &lt;math&gt;H = A \otimes B&lt;/math&gt;, which generates the time evolutions &lt;math&gt;U(t) = \exp[-ixtH] &lt;/math&gt; (in units where &lt;math&gt;\hbar = 1&lt;/math&gt;), where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the "interaction strength", which has units of inverse time. Assume a fixed interaction time &lt;math&gt;t = \Delta t&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;\lambda = x \Delta t&lt;/math&gt; is small, such that &lt;math&gt;\lambda^3 \approx 0&lt;/math&gt;. A series expansion of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; in  &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; gives

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 U &amp;= I \otimes I - i\lambda H - \frac 1 2 \lambda^2 H^2 + O(\lambda^3) \\
  &amp;\approx I \otimes I - i\lambda A \otimes B - \frac 1 2 \lambda^2 A^2 \otimes B^2.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Because it was only necessary to expand the unitary to a low order in perturbation theory, we call this is a weak interaction. Further, the fact that the unitary is predominately the identity operator, as &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda^2&lt;/math&gt; are small, implies that the state after the interaction is not radically different from the initial state. The combined state of the system after interaction is

:&lt;math&gt;
|\Psi'\rangle = \left(I \otimes I - i\lambda A \otimes B - \frac 1 2 \lambda^2 A^2 \otimes B^2\right) |\Psi\rangle.
&lt;/math&gt;

Now we perform a measurement on the ancilla to find out about the system, this is known as an ancilla-coupled measurement. We will consider measurements in a basis &lt;math&gt;|q\rangle&lt;/math&gt; (on the ancilla system) such that &lt;math&gt;\sum_q |q\rangle \langle q| = I&lt;/math&gt;. The measurements action on both systems is described by the action of the projectors &lt;math&gt;\Pi_q = I \otimes |q\rangle \langle q|&lt;/math&gt; on the joint state &lt;math&gt;|\Psi'\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. From [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum measurement theory]] we know the conditional state after the measurement is

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 |\Psi_q\rangle &amp;= \frac{\Pi_q |\Psi'\rangle}{\sqrt{\langle\Psi'| \Pi_q |\Psi'\rangle}} \\
  &amp;= \frac{I \langle q|\phi\rangle - i\lambda A \langle q| B |\phi\rangle - \frac 1 2 \lambda^2 A^2 \langle q| B^2 |\phi\rangle}{\mathcal N} |\psi\rangle \otimes |q\rangle,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal N = \sqrt{\langle\Psi'| \Pi_q |\Psi'\rangle}&lt;/math&gt; is a normalization factor for the wavefunction. Notice the ancilla system state records the outcome of the measurement. The object &lt;math&gt;M_q := I \langle q|\phi\rangle - i\lambda A \langle q| B |\phi\rangle - \frac 1 2 \lambda^2 A^2 \langle q| B^2 |\phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is an operator on the system Hilbert space and is called a [[Kraus operators|Kraus operator]].

With respect to the Kraus operators the post-measurement state of the combined system is

:&lt;math&gt;
|\Psi_q\rangle = \frac{M_q |\psi\rangle}{\sqrt{\langle \psi|M_q^\dagger M_q|\psi\rangle}} \otimes |q\rangle.
&lt;/math&gt;

The objects &lt;math&gt;E_q = M_q^\dagger M_q &lt;/math&gt; are elements of what is called a [[POVM]] and must obey &lt;math&gt;\sum_q E_q = I&lt;/math&gt; so that the corresponding probabilities sum to unity: &lt;math&gt;\sum_q \Pr(q|\psi) = \sum_q \langle\psi| E_q |\psi\rangle = 1&lt;/math&gt;. As the ancilla system is no longer correlated with the primary system, it is simply recording the outcome of the measurement, we can [[Partial trace|trace]] over it. Doing so gives the conditional state of the primary system alone:

:&lt;math&gt;
|\psi_q\rangle = \frac{M_q |\psi\rangle}{\sqrt{\langle \psi|M_q^\dagger M_q|\psi\rangle}},
&lt;/math&gt;

which we still label by the outcome of the measurement &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, these considerations allow one to derive a [[Quantum stochastic calculus#Quantum trajectories|quantum trajectory]].

===Example Kraus operators===
We will use the canonical example of Gaussian Kraus operators given by Barchielli, Lanz, Prosperi;&lt;ref name="Barchiellietal1982"/&gt; and Caves and Milburn.&lt;ref name="CavesMilburn1987" /&gt; Take &lt;math&gt;H = x \otimes p&lt;/math&gt;, where the position and momentum on both systems have the usual [[Canonical commutation relation]] &lt;math&gt;[x,  p] = i&lt;/math&gt;. Take the initial wavefunction of the ancilla to have a Gaussian distribution

:&lt;math&gt;
|\Phi\rangle = \frac{1}{(2\pi\sigma^2)^{1/4}} \int dq' \exp[-q'^2/(4\sigma^2)] |q'\rangle.
&lt;/math&gt;

The position wavefunction of the ancilla is

:&lt;math&gt;
\Phi(q) = \langle q|\Phi\rangle = \frac{1}{(2\pi\sigma^2)^{1/4}} \exp[-q^2/(4\sigma^2)].
&lt;/math&gt;

The Kraus operators are (compared to the discussion above, we set &lt;math&gt;\lambda = 1&lt;/math&gt;)

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 M(q) &amp;= \langle q| \exp[-ix \otimes p] |\Phi\rangle \\
  &amp;= \frac{1}{(2\pi\sigma^2)^{1/4}} \exp[-(q - x)^2/(4\sigma^2)],
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

while the corresponding POVM elements are

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 E(q) &amp;= M_q^\dagger M_q \\
  &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp[-(q - x)^2/(2\sigma^2)],
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

which obey &lt;math&gt;\int dq\, E(q) = I&lt;/math&gt;. An alternative representation is often seen in the literature. Using the spectral representation of the position operator &lt;math&gt;x = \int dx' |x'\rangle \langle x'|&lt;/math&gt;, we can write

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 M(q) &amp;= \frac{1}{(2\pi\sigma^2)^{1/4}} \int dx' \exp[-(q - x')^2/(4\sigma^2)] |x'\rangle \langle x'|, \\
 E(q) &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \int dx' \exp[-(q - x')^2/(2\sigma^2)] |x'\rangle \langle x'|.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\sigma \to 0} E(q) = |x = q\rangle \langle x = q| &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="CavesMilburn1987" /&gt; That is, in a particular limit these operators limit to a strong measurement of position; for other values of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; we refer to the measurement as finite-strength; and as &lt;math&gt;\sigma \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;, we say the measurement is weak.

==Information-gain–disturbance tradeoff==
As stated above, Busch's theorem prevents a free lunch: there can be no information gain without disturbance. However, the tradeoff between information gain and disturbance has been characterized by many authors, including Fuchs and [[Asher Peres|Peres]];&lt;ref name="FuchsPeres1996"&gt;{{cite journal

==Applications==

Since the early days it has been clear that the primary use of weak measurement would be for feedback control or adaptive measurements of quantum systems. Indeed, this motivated much of Belavkin's work, and an explicit example was given by Caves and Milburn. An early application of an adaptive weak measurements was that of [http://coding.jpl.nasa.gov/sdolinar Dolinar]'s receiver,&lt;ref name="Dolinar1973"&gt;{{cite journal

'''William James Firey''' (1923–2004) was an American mathematician, specializing in the geometry of convex bodies.&lt;ref name=Obit&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=William J. Firey|date=20 August 2004|newspaper=Corvallis Gazette-Times|url=https://www.gazettetimes.com/news/local/obituaries/william-j-firey/article_a00e9304-c901-56fe-9d2e-8f026532ba61.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in Montana, Firey moved with his family to Seattle when he was 6 years old. During WW II, he served in the U.S. Army as a medical technician in Europe. He married in 1946. During the first years of their marriage, the couple worked for the [[United States Forest Service]] during summers in fire look-out stations in the Washington [[Cascade Range|Cascades]].&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt;

Firey received in 1948 his bachelor's degree from the University of Washington, in 1949 his master's degree from the University of Toronto, and in 1954 his Ph.D. from Stanford University. He was a faculty member at Washington State University for 8 years and then became a professor at Oregon State University, where he retired as professor emeritus in 1988. He was a visiting professor at several universities and made several trips to the [[Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach]].&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt;

In 1974 Firey was an Invited Speaker at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in Vancouver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Firey, W. J.|chapter=Some open questions on convex surfaces|title=''In:'' Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians, 1974, Vancouver, B.C.|volume=vol. 1|pages=479–484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|In addition to his professional travels, he and his wife, often joined by friends, sailed in the Pacific Northwest's San Juan and Gulf Islands, the Mediterranean seas around Greece, and the Baltic. Land travels included sojourns in France and trips to Turkey, England and Scotland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Denmark, Greece and Mexico.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt;}}

Upon his death he was survived by his widow and his daughter and predeceased by his son.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt;
