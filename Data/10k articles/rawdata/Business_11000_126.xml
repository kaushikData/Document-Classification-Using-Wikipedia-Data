In a U.S. [[Public company|publicly traded company]], an '''audit committee''' is an operating committee of the [[board of directors]] charged with oversight of financial reporting and disclosure.  Committee members are drawn from members of the company's board of directors, with a [[Chairman|Chairperson]] selected from among the committee members.  A qualifying (cf. paragraph "Composition" below) audit committee is required for a U.S. publicly traded company to be listed on a [[stock exchange]]. Audit committees are typically empowered to acquire the consulting resources and expertise deemed necessary to perform their responsibilities.

The role of audit committees continues to evolve as a result of the passage of the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] of 2002.  Many audit committees also have oversight of regulatory compliance and [[Enterprise risk management|risk management]] activities.

[[Not for profit]] entities may also have an audit committee.

Internationally, the '''audit committee''' is a committee of the board of directors responsible for oversight of the financial reporting process, selection of the independent auditor, and receipt of audit results both internal and external. The committee assists the board of directors fulfill its corporate governance and overseeing responsibilities in relation to an entity’s financial reporting, internal control system, risk management system and internal and external audit functions. Its role is to provide advice and recommendations to the board within the scope of its terms of reference / charter. Terms of reference and requirements for an audit committee vary by country, but may be influenced by economic and political unions capable of passing legislation. The European Union directives are applied across Europe through legislation at the country level. Although specific legal requirements may vary by country in Europe, the source of legislation on corporate governance issues is often found at the European Union level and within the non-mandatory corporate governance codes that cross national boundaries.

==Definitions==
*[[Institute of Internal Auditors]] definition: ''"The Audit committee refers to the governance body that is charged with oversight of the organization’s audit and control functions. Although these fiduciary duties are often delegated to an audit committee of the board of directors, the (...) Practice Advisory is also intended to apply to other oversight groups with equivalent authority and responsibility, such as trustees, legislative bodies, owners of an owner-managed entity,    internal control committees, or full boards of directors"'' (IIA Practice Advisory 2060-2 of 2004).
*In Nigeria, the Audit Committee is defined as a ''“Committee of Directors and the enterprises shareholders representatives whose specific responsibility is to review the annual financial statements before submission to the Board of Directors”''.
*The above definitions are focused on the private sector. A similar definition has been developed by the [[Supreme Audit Institution|government auditors]] in the [[INTOSAI]]’s Internal Control Standards: ''"A committee of the Board of Directors whose role typically focuses on aspects of financial reporting and on the entity's processes to manage business and financial risk, and for compliance with significant applicable legal, ethical, and regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee typically assists the Board with the oversight of (a) the integrity of the entity's financial statements, (b) the entity's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (c) the independent auditors' qualifications and independence, (d) the performance of the entity's internal audit function and that of the independent auditors and (e) compensation of company executives (in absence of a remuneration committee)."''(Standard INTOSAI GOV #9100, "Internal Control Standards for the Public Sector”, annex 2){{cite web|title=INTOSAI definition|url=http://www.issai.org/media(891,1033)/Internal_Control_Standards.pdf|work=INTOSAI definition|publisher=INTOSAI|accessdate=1 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725124531/http://www.issai.org/media(891,1033)/Internal_Control_Standards.pdf|archive-date=2011-07-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}

In India, according to Section 177(1) of the [[Companies Act 2013]], the Board of Directors of every listed company and such other class or classes of companies, as may be prescribed, shall constitute an Audit Committee. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prasad|first=Suresh|title=Audit Committee to be constituted by BOD of specified Company|url=http://www.aubsp.com/section-177-audit-committee|publisher=AUBSP|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As per Rule 6 (Committees of the Board) of the Companies (Meetings of Board and its Powers) Rules, 2014, the Board of directors of every listed companies and the following classes of companies shall constitute an Audit Committee and a Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Board:

All public companies having:
* Paid-up Capital ≥ ₹10 Crore;
* Turnover ≥ ₹100 Crore;
* Loans + Borrowings + Debentures + Deposits ≥ ₹50 Crore.


==Composition==
Usually, membership of the Committee is subject to the maximum number of 6 persons. 
* In the USA, a qualifying audit committee is required for listed publicly traded companies. To qualify, the committee must be composed of [[outside director|independent outside directors]] with at least one qualifying as a financial expert.
* [[European Union]], 8th [[European Directive|Directive]]&lt;ref name="2006/43/EC"&gt;{{cite web|title=European Directive  2006/43/EC of 17 May 2006|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:2006L0043:20080321:EN:PDF|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; on company law 2006/43/EC: ''“Each public-interest entity shall have an audit committee. The Member State shall determine whether audit committees are to be composed of non-executive members of the administrative body and/or members of the supervisory body of the audited entity and/or members appointed by the general meeting of shareholders of the audited entity. At least one member of the audit committee shall be independent and shall have competence in accounting and/or auditing.”''
*  [[Institute of Internal Auditors]] best practice:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sample Audit Committee Charter|url=http://www.theiia.org/guidance/standards-and-guidance/audit-committees-board-of-directors/sample-audit-committee-charter-1/?search=Audit|publisher=IIA|accessdate=6 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728101524/http://www.theiia.org/guidance/standards-and-guidance/audit-committees-board-of-directors/sample-audit-committee-charter-1/?search=Audit|archive-date=2011-07-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''“The audit committee will consist of at least three and no more than six members of the board of directors... Each committee member will be both independent and financially literate. At least one member shall be designated as the "financial expert," as defined by applicable legislation and regulation”''.

==Responsibilities==
Boards of Directors and their committees rely on management to run the daily operations of the business.  The Board's role is better described as oversight or monitoring, rather than execution.  Responsibilities of the audit committee typically include:&lt;ref&gt;AICPA "The Audit Committee Toolkit" New York; 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/2004/1104/essentials/p22.htm |title=CPA Journal AC Responsibilities |publisher=Nysscpa.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::* Overseeing the financial reporting and disclosure process.
::* Monitoring choice of accounting policies and principles.
::* Overseeing hiring, performance and independence of the external auditors.
::* Oversight of regulatory compliance, ethics, and whistleblower hotlines.
::* Monitoring the internal control process.
::* Overseeing the performance of the [[internal audit]] function.
::* Discussing [[risk management]] policies and practices with management.

The duties of an audit committee are typically described in a committee charter, often available on the entity's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/governance/en/audit?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=corp |title=Sample Charter |publisher=Dell.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;×

*[[European Union]]: Directive &lt;ref name="2006/43/EC" /&gt; 2006/43/EC, article 41.2: (...) the audit committee shall, inter alia: (a) Monitor the financial reporting process; (b) Monitor the effectiveness of the company's internal control, internal audit where applicable, and risk management systems; (c) Monitor the statutory audit of the annual and consolidated accounts; (d) Review and monitor the independence of the statutory auditor or audit firm, and in particular the provision of additional services to the audited entity.
*Public sector: Cf. Standard INTOSAI GOV #9100&lt;ref name=INTOSAIdefinition&gt;{{cite web|title=INTOSAI definition|url=http://www.issai.org/media(891,1033)/Internal_Control_Standards.pdf|work=INTOSAI definition|publisher=INTOSAI|accessdate=1 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725124531/http://www.issai.org/media(891,1033)/Internal_Control_Standards.pdf|archive-date=2011-07-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in oversight of financial reporting and accounting===
Audit committees typically review [[financial statement]]s quarterly and annually in [[Public company|public companies]].  In addition, members will often discuss complex accounting estimates and judgments made by management and the implementation of new [[accountancy|accounting principles]] or regulations.  Audit committees interact regularly with senior financial management such as the [[Chief financial officer|CFO]] and [[Comptroller|Controller]] and are in a position to comment on the capabilities of these managers.  Should significant problems with accounting practices or personnel be identified or alleged, a special investigation may be directed by the audit committee, using outside [[Consultant|consulting]] resources as deemed necessary.

[[External auditor]]s are also required to report to the committee on a variety of matters, such as their views on management's selection of accounting principles, accounting adjustments arising from their [[audit]]s, any disagreement or difficulties encountered in working with management, and any identified [[fraud]] or illegal acts.&lt;ref&gt;"Audit Committee Effectiveness: What Works Best-2nd Edition." [[Institute of Internal Auditors]] and [[Price Waterhouse]]. Altamonte Springs, FLA; 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in oversight of the external auditor===
Audit committees typically approve selection of the external [[auditor]].  The external auditor (also called a public accounting firm) reviews the entity's financial statements quarterly and issues an opinion on the accuracy of the entity's annual financial statements.  Changing an external auditor typically also requires audit committee approval.  Audit committees also help ensure the external auditor is independent, meaning no conflicts of interest exist that might interfere with the auditor's ability to issue its opinion on the financial statements.
*[[European Union]]: Directive&lt;ref name="2006/43/EC" /&gt; 2006/43/EC, article 41.3 and 41.4: ''"In a public-interest entity, the proposal of the administrative or supervisory body for the appointment of a statutory auditor or audit firm shall be based on a recommendation made by the audit committee. The statutory auditor or audit firm shall report to the audit committee on key matters arising from the statutory audit, and in particular on material weaknesses in internal control in relation to the financial reporting process."''

===Role in oversight of regulatory compliance===
Audit committees discuss litigation or regulatory compliance risks with management, generally via briefings or reports of the General Counsel, the top lawyer in the organisation.  Larger corporations may also have a Chief Compliance Officer or Ethics Officer that report incidents or risks related to the entity's [[code of conduct]].

===Role in monitoring the effectiveness of the internal control process and of the internal audit===
[[Internal control]] includes the policies and practices used to control the operations, accounting, and regulatory compliance of the entity.  Management and both the [[internal audit]]ing function and external auditors provide reporting to the audit committee regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of internal control.
*[[Institute of Internal Auditors|IIA]] Practice Advisory: Cf. PA1110-1 paragraphs 2 and 3 (where the “board” means “an organization's governing body, such as a board of directors, supervisory board, (...) any other designated body of the organization, including the audit committee to whom the chief audit executive may functionally report)
* European best practice  for the role of the Audit Committee in  overseeing internal audit: cf.&lt;ref name=ECIIAguidance /&gt;

===Role in oversight of risk management===
Organizations have a variety of functions that perform activities to understand and address risks that threaten the achievement of the organization's objectives.  The policies and practices used by the entity to identify, prioritize, and respond to the risks (or opportunities) are typically discussed with the audit committee.  Having such a discussion is required for listing on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].  Many organizations are developing their practices towards a goal of a risk-based management approach called [[Enterprise risk management]]. Audit committee involvement in non-financial risk topics varies significantly by entity. Dr. [[Ram Charan]] has argued for risk management early warning systems at the corporate board level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*European best practice  for the role of the Audit Committee in  risk management: cf.&lt;ref name=ECIIAguidance /&gt;

==Impact of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002==
The [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] of 2002 increased audit committees’ responsibilities and authority.  It raised membership requirements and committee composition to include more independent directors.  Companies were required to disclose whether or not a financial expert is on the Committee.  Further, the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] and the [[stock exchange]]s proposed new regulations and rules to strengthen audit committees.

==History==
Below are a few key milestones in the evolution of audit committees:&lt;ref name="kpmg.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kpmg.com/aci/docs/practices/ACI_JourneyGlob_WEB.pdf |title=KPMG AC Journey 2005-2006 |publisher=Kpmg.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-22 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1939: The [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) first endorsed the audit committee concept.
*1972: The [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) first recommends that publicly held companies establish audit committees composed of outside (non-management) directors.
*1977: NYSE adopts a listing requirement that audit committees be composed entirely of independent directors.
*1988:  AICPA issues SAS 61 "Communication with Audit Committees" addressing communications between the external auditor, audit committee and management of SEC reporting companies.
*1999: NYSE, NASD, AMEX, SEC and AICPA finalize major rule changes based on Blue Ribbon Committee on Improving the Effectiveness of the Corporate Audit Committee.
*2002: [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] is passed in the wake of corporate scandals and includes whistleblower and financial expert disclosure requirements for audit committees.

===Interaction with the Board, and with non-executive Board Members===
*The [[European Confederation of Institutes of Internal Auditing]] (ECIIA)’s best practice:&lt;ref name=ECIIAguidance&gt;{{cite web|title=ECIIA Guidance on the 8th EU Company Law Directive|url=http://www.eciia.eu/system/files/eccia_ferma_web_1.pdf|publisher=www.eciia.eu|accessdate=12 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321211907/http://www.eciia.eu/system/files/eccia_ferma_web_1.pdf|archive-date=2012-03-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''"The work of the audit committee can only be valuable if sufficient time is allotted on the board agenda for the audit committee to present the results of its work. The audit committee should also feel that the board is taking appropriate action on its report."''
*[[European Union]] best practice: Cf. European Parliament resolution of 10 March 2009 on implementation of Directive 2006/43/EC on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts (2008/2247(INI)): ‘’”(...)  Stresses that recent experience shows the need for frequent and high-quality interaction within audit committees and between independent directors, supervisory boards and auditors; and that non-executive board members should consider carefully the possibility of having meetings without executive board members being present.”’’

===Frequency of interaction with management===
Many audit committee chairpersons conduct interim calls with key members of management between quarterly meetings.  Key contacts may include the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], [[Chief financial officer|CFO]], Chief Auditor, and external audit partner.  Many boards also schedule dinners prior to formal meetings that allow informal interaction with management. Some companies also require their boards to spend a certain amount of time learning their operations beyond board meeting attendance.

===Executive sessions===
These are formally scheduled private meetings between the audit committee and key members of management or the external auditor. These meetings typically are unstructured and provide the opportunity for the committee to obtain the feedback of these managers in private.  A key question audit committee members ask in such sessions is: "Is there anything you would like to bring to our attention?"

===Evaluation===
Audit committees should complete a self-evaluation annually to identify improvement opportunities.  This involves comparing the committee's performance versus its charter, any formal guidelines and rules, and against best practices.  Such a review is confidential and may or may not include evaluations of particular members.&lt;ref&gt;"Audit Committee Effectiveness: What Works Best-2nd Edition" Institute of Internal Auditors and Price Waterhouse. Altamonte Springs, FLA; 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Survey results==
Various consulting and public accounting firms perform research on audit committees, to provide benchmarking data.&lt;ref name="kpmg.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kpmg.com/aci/docs/surveys/Global-2nd_ACI_Survey_HL-2007_POSTFNL.pdf |title=KPMG AC Survey 2007 |publisher=Kpmg.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207073949/http://www.kpmg.com/aci/docs/surveys/Global-2nd_ACI_Survey_HL-2007_POSTFNL.pdf |archive-date=2008-12-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kpmg.com/aci/docs/surveys/ACI_NACD_Journey07_08_POSTFINAL.pdf |title=KPMG AC Study 2008 |publisher=Kpmg.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207102046/https://www.kpmg.com/aci/docs/surveys/ACI_NACD_Journey07_08_POSTFINAL.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some results are identified below:
*54% of committee members surveyed felt the audit committee was "very effective," while 38% indicated "somewhat effective."
*Risk management, internal control, and accounting estimates and judgments were the top priority areas for 2007.
*Most audit committees have 3-4 members and are usually chaired by persons with experience as a CFO, external auditor, or CEO.
*Audit committees meet 6-10 times per year, either face-to-face or via teleconference, with the former lasting from 1–4 hours and the latter 1–2 hours.
*Audit committee members devoted 50–150 hours to their responsibilities each year.
*The percentage of audit committees with oversight responsibility for: IT compliance (66%), business continuity (50%), and information security(45%).
*41% were "very satisfied" with the internal audit function, while 52% were "somewhat satisfied."
*Two-thirds felt the Chief Internal Audit position was for a professional internal auditor, rather than as a "stepping stone" to other roles.
*93% indicated the audit committee was "somewhat" or "much more" effective since the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] was implemented in 2002.
*58% of committee members were "somewhat satisfied" that they understood management's processes to identify and assess significant business risks.
*Only 17% of audit committees had primary responsibility for oversight of non-financial risk; the full board had this responsibility in 56% of companies.

In a 2011 study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Document of 3/12/10 presented to the CoE Committee of Ministers|url=https://wcd.coe.int/wcd/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1684131&amp;Site=CM|publisher=Council of Europe|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Council of Europe concluded that: ''“The Benchmarking results from a sample of 15 international organisations in Europe show that 11 have an audit committee (of which the name may vary from Audit Committee, Advisory Committee on Audits, Audit Advisory Board, Audit Progress Committee, Finance and Audit Committee, Independent Advisory Oversight Committee, Independent Audit Advisory Committee of Experts) and in seven, the Audit committee plays a role in the selection of the External Auditor"''.

A 2009 study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benchmarking exercise on Financial Governance|url=http://eca.europa.eu/products/3RDCONTCONF_EUROCONTROL3|publisher=eca.europa.eu|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 23 international organisations showed that 10 had an Audit Committee and 3 considered having one in future, with 8 reporting to the Governing Body level and 2 reporting to DG/Executive Director level. The sizes of all Audit Committees were between 3 and 9 members, with 5 committees having a mix of external expert members and internal members.

The '''Progressive Insurance Automotive X PRIZE''' ('''PIAXP''' or '''AXP''') was a set of competitions, programs and events, from the [[X Prize Foundation]], to "inspire a new generation of super-efficient vehicles that help break America's addiction to oil and stem the effects of climate change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Competition Guidelines, Version 1.2, 13 January 2009|page=5|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-06-21|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801164332/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf|archivedate=1 August 2009|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Progressive Corporation|Progressive Insurance]] was the title sponsor of the prize, the centerpiece of which is the Competition Division, within which a 10-million-dollar purse was divided between the winners of three competitions.

The essence of each competition was to design, build and race super-efficient vehicles that achieved 100 [[Miles per gallon of gasoline equivalent|MPGe]] (2.35&amp;nbsp;liter/100&amp;nbsp;kilometer) efficiency, produced less than 200&amp;nbsp;grams/mile well-to-wheel CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent [[Exhaust gas|emissions]], and could be manufactured for the mass market.&lt;ref name='msnbc'/&gt;  Within the Competition Division, there are two vehicle classes: Mainstream and Alternative. The mainstream class had a prize of $5 million. The alternate class had two separate prizes of $2.5 million, one for side-by-side seating and one for tandem seating.&lt;ref name="guidelines"&gt;{{cite web|title=Competition Guidelines|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=progressiveautoxprize.org|accessdate=2009-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PIAXP has an Educational Program, funded by a $3.5 million grant from the [[United States Department of Energy]], to engage students and the public in learning about advanced vehicle technologies, energy efficiency, climate change, alternative fuels, and the science, technology, engineering, and math behind efficient vehicle development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Education Program  Overview |url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/education|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-06-30| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090614171836/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/education| archivedate= 14 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The X Prize Foundation began work on the development of a competition to spur innovation in the automotive industry in 2005 and on 6 March 2006 announced that Mark Goodstein would join the Foundation as an Executive Director of the new prize.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: X Prize Foundation Hires Mark Goodstein as Executive Director|url= http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/press-release/x-prize-foundation-hires-mark-goodstein-as-executive-director |publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A little more than year later, on 12 April 2007, the Foundation formally announced the creation of the prize at the 2007 New York Auto Show and set the purse at $10 million for a car that could get {{convert|100|mpgus|L/100&amp;nbsp;km mpgimp|abbr=on}} and be sold for a reasonable price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Auto X Prize to reward 100-mpg car|url=http://blogs.consumerreports.org/cars/2007/04/auto_x_prize_to.html|author=Eric Evarts|publisher=[[Consumer Reports]]|accessdate=2009-06-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305093834/http://blogs.consumerreports.org/cars/2007/04/auto_x_prize_to.html|archivedate=5 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the subsequent year, the X Prize Foundation solidified sponsorship for the prize and on 20 March 2008 announced that Progressive Insurance would be the Title Sponsor of the Prize and fund the $10 million purse.  From that point onward, it was known as the Progressive Insurance Automotive X Prize (PIAXP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: X Prize Foundation Progressive Insurance Join Forces to Officially Announce the $10 Million Automotive X Prize|url= http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/press-release/x-prize-foundation-hires-mark-goodstein-as-executive-director |publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 12 April 2007 announcement of the creation of the X Prize, the Foundation released draft Competition Guidelines, which were open for public comment from 2 April to 31 May 2007.  The latest guidelines were published on 10 January 2009. The competition guidelines are the product of hundreds of volunteers of the AXP and world-class advisors.&lt;ref name="guidelines"/&gt;

On 7 April 2009, the [[X Prize Foundation]] announced that 111 teams had registered by the February 2009 deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/news-events/press-release/111-teams-get-green-light-to-advance-in-multimillion-dollar-competition|title=111 Teams Get Green Light to Advance in Multimillion Dollar Competition|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 20 October 2009, the design judging had winnowed the number of teams down to 43, with some publicly, and others quietly, withdrawing.&lt;ref name="progressiveautoxprize.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/teams |title=Teams &amp;#124; Progressive Automotive XPRIZE |publisher=Progressiveautoxprize.org |accessdate=2011-01-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101228170845/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/teams| archivedate= 28 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The formal vehicle competition events began on 26 April 2010, and consisted of the remaining four stages: Shakedown (26 April – 7 May 2010), Knockout ( 16–30 June 2010), Finals ( 19–30 July 2010) and Validation (August 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=COMPETITION TIMELINE|url= http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/prize-details/competition-timeline |publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2011-01-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101228192728/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/prize-details/competition-timeline| archivedate= 28 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Winners===
The winners of the competition were announced on 16 September 2010.&lt;ref name="XPrizeAwards"&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Teams Awarded Share of $10 Million Purse in Progressive Insurance Automotive X PRIZE for Super Fuel-Efficient Vehicles|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/news-events/press-releases/three-teams-awarded-share-10-million-purse-progressive-insurance-automotive-x-prize-super-fu|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=17 September 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100919163613/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/news-events/press-releases/three-teams-awarded-share-10-million-purse-progressive-insurance-automotive-x-prize-super-fu| archivedate= 19 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Team Edison2 won the $5 million Mainstream competition with its four-passenger [[Very Light Car]], obtaining 102.5&amp;nbsp;MPGe or just below 69&amp;nbsp;MPG running on [[E85]] fuel.
* Team [[Li-Ion Motors]] won the $2.5 million Alternative Side-by-Side competition with their aerodynamic Wave-II electric vehicle achieving 187&amp;nbsp;MPGe.
* Team [[X-Tracer Switzerland]] won the $2.5 million Alternative Tandem competition with their 205.3&amp;nbsp;MPGe faired electric motorcycle.

==Vehicle requirements==
Within the Competition Division, there are two vehicle classes—Mainstream and Alternative—both of which have the same requirements for [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] and [[Exhaust gas|emissions]], but differing design constraints. The Alternative class is further divided into tandem and side-by-side classes.  Vehicles in the Mainstream Class must meet specifications that are derived from typical small, five-passenger, economy mixed-use vehicles.  The Alternative Class has fewer performance and design restrictions and provides an outlet for innovation.  Both classes allow entries that are modifications of an existing popular vehicle, provided that all PIAXP requirements are met.

Vehicles in both classes must have a fuel economy of 100 [[Miles per gallon of gasoline equivalent|MPGe]] (21&amp;nbsp;kWh or 2.35&amp;nbsp;liters of petrol/100&amp;nbsp;kilometer) and produce less than 200&amp;nbsp;grams/mile CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions (measured well-to-wheel).  For electric vehicles, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions requirement is a more binding constraint.  Because CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions will be calculated assuming a national average of electricity sources projected to 2014, an all-electric car will have to achieve 114 MPGe in order to produce less than 200&amp;nbsp;grams/mile CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.  Further, electricity consumption is measured at the "plug" side of the battery charging device, so it would have to achieve 114 MPGe, assuming 100% efficient battery charging.  If the charger were 85% efficient, this requirement would grow to 134 MPGe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Competition Guidelines, Version 1.2, 13 January 2009|pages=27, 29|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-06-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090801164332/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf| archivedate= 1 August 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy and Emissions Spreadsheet 12.1.08| url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/Energy_and_Emissions_spreadsheet_12.1.08.xls|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the other words, efficiency of electric cars should be not 21 but 16 kWh/100&amp;nbsp;km.

Vehicles in both classes also must have features expected of a modern automobile including an enclosed cabin with windshield and windows, operating windshield wipers, washers, headlights, horn, indicators, brake lights, reflective devices, rear and side-view mirrors, and seat belts.  They must have the usual automotive controls, including accelerator pedal, brake pedal, steering mechanism (not necessarily a wheel) and indicators.  They must be "highway capable", which is defined as the ability to maintain {{convert|65|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} on a four percent uphill grade and to accelerate from {{convert|40|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in less than 9&amp;nbsp;seconds.  They must be able to brake from 60 to 0&amp;nbsp;mph in less than {{convert|170|ft|m}}, meet existing noise standards and use tires that meet automotive or motorcycle (alternative class only and only if the vehicle is otherwise eligible to be classified as a motorcycle) standards.  Both must meet the same set of static and dynamic stability requirements.

The mainstream vehicle must seat at least four adults with at least two side-by-side front seats, have at least {{convert|10|cuft|m3}} of useful cargo space in one contiguous location not counting the passenger seats, accelerate from 0 to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 15&amp;nbsp;seconds or less, and be able to drive {{convert|200|mi|km}} without refueling or recharging.  The mainstream vehicle must have four or more wheels.

The alternate class vehicle must seat at least two people, accelerate from 0 to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 18&amp;nbsp;seconds or less, and be able to drive {{convert|100|mi|km}} without refueling or recharging.  The alternative vehicle has no minimum number of wheels, but it must remain upright when stopped with no driver inputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Competition Guidelines, Version 1.2, 13 January 2009|pages=16, 20|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-06-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090801164332/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf| archivedate= 1 August 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the main focus of PIAXP is fuel economy and carbon emissions, not safety, the vehicles must be "production capable".  Therefore, the entries must either be fully compliant with the [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108|Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards]] (FMVSS) and other applicable [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) requirements or compliance has to be "designed in".  For example, allowance for airbags in the designs is considered acceptable without actually installing the airbags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Competition Guidelines, Version 1.2, 13 January 2009|pages=20, 21|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-06-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090801164332/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf| archivedate= 1 August 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teams are also required to submit a [[business plan]] which clearly demonstrates an ability to produce 10,000 vehicles per year.  Note that teams are not required to be under-taking this plan, but the plan has to exist and the car has to be designed such that this plan is feasible.

With the lack of mainstream entrants from established automobile companies, a Demonstration Division was created so that automakers could at least display and promote their highest efficiency vehicles alongside the main competition.  However, there were too few entrants by 1 March registration deadline, and this division was canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/prize-details/registration|title=X Prize Team Registration page|date=1 March 2010|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only confirmed entrant was the [[Tesla Roadster (2008)|Tesla Roadster]], which had dropped out of the main competition.

Vehicles in the Demonstration Division would have met the same requirements as Mainstream Class vehicles in the Competition Division, except for MPGe and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.  There was no Alternative Class equivalent in the Demonstration Division.  These vehicles would have been stock vehicles, i.e., vehicles identical to those for sale or pre-production prototypes of vehicles intended for sales.

Vehicles in the Demonstration Division would have been tested in the same way as Competition Division vehicles and would have participated in the PIAXP competition events under the same rules in order to demonstrate and showcase their capabilities and performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Competition Guidelines, Version 1.2, 13 January 2009|pages=39, 40|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-06-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090801164332/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf| archivedate= 1 August 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition events==
The competition timeline was finalized as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/prize-details/competition-timeline|title=Competition Timeline|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=6 May 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100504221127/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/prize-details/competition-timeline| archivedate= 4 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design judging===
Accepted teams must provide evidence that their vehicles are production capable, by providing a detailed Data Submissions covering four areas:

* Safety and Emissions:  Vehicles must be designed so that, in production, they meet U.S. safety standards (FMVSS) and U.S. emission standards.
* Manufacturability and Cost:  Vehicles must be capable of being manufactured in quantities of 10,000 per year with production costs within levels consistent with that production volume.
* Features:  Vehicles must have the features expected by consumers for vehicles within the projected prices range.
* Business Plan:  There must be a credible plan to manufacture, sell and support 10,000 vehicles (or conversions) per year by 2014.  The plan must address required fuel infrastructure if it does not already exist.

Those that pass this hurdle will be invited to bring their vehicles to the competition events.  The design judging was closed in October 2009, with 43 teams remaining.

===Shakedown stages===
The first three stages will be a “shake-down” period and performance in these stages will not count to final scores.  The first step of the competition will be the review of technical reports, technical inspection of the vehicles and performance testing of safety elements to eliminate unsafe vehicles.  The two-week shakedown took place at the [[Michigan International Speedway]], from 26 April to 7 May 2010.

Those that pass the initial technical and safety inspections and tests will participate in the remaining competition events. These include stage races, additional active safety performance tests and a dynamometer test.

===Knockout stage===
The next stage will be a “knockout” qualifying event.  To advance, vehicles must pass active safety performance tests, meet acceptable emission levels and demonstrate at least 67 MPGe on a test track.  These were held at the [[Michigan International Speedway]] from  20–29 June 2010.  After this stage, only 15 vehicles from 12 teams remained in the competition.

===Finals stage===
The final stages will determine the winning teams.  To complete the race successfully, vehicles must maintain a minimum average speed (maximum allowable time) while meeting PIAXP requirements for fuel economy (90 MPGe) and emissions.  The finals also include a tie breaking race; the vehicle with the best overall time while still meeting requirements will take the purse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Competition Guidelines, Version 1.2, 13 January 2009|pages=10–12|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-06-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090801164332/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf| archivedate= 1 August 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The final stages are scheduled for  19–30 July 2010 at the [[Michigan International Speedway]].

===Validation stage===
The few remaining teams were validated on [[dynamometer]]s under laboratory conditions at the EPA Labs in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] and [[Argonne National Laboratory]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. This stage is scheduled for August 2010. The validation results count toward 50% of the final efficiency figures, which together must exceed 100 MPGe.

Edison2 was an exception. The engines in both Very Light Cars failed before validation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://autoblog.xprize.org/axp/2010/08/the-competition-isnt-over-yet-why-validation-matters.html#comments| title = The Competition Isn’t Over Yet: Why Validation Matters| accessdate = 2011-03-31| author = Eric Cahill| publisher = Progressive Automotive XPrize Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edison2 was allowed to circumvent the rules governing procedures and provided independent third-party validation reports instead of undergoing the same validation testing as other finalist teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.edmunds.com/greencaradvisor/2010/08/auto-x-prizes-mainstream-finalist-gets-ok-to-provide-own-validation-results.html |title=Auto X-Prize's 'Mainstream' Finalist Gets OK to Provide Own Validation Results |accessdate=2011-03-31 |author=John O'Dell |publisher=Edmunds.com Green Car Advisor |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820062230/http://blogs.edmunds.com/greencaradvisor/2010/08/auto-x-prizes-mainstream-finalist-gets-ok-to-provide-own-validation-results.html |archivedate=20 August 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational program==
The [[United States Department of Energy]] joined the PIAXP as a sponsor, funding an educational program targeted to young people.  The first component of the Education Program is a web site created in partnership with Discovery Education, www.FuelOurFutureNow.com, featuring activities for K-12 students, as well as videos, virtual labs, and interactive resources intended for use in school and in the home.

==Competing teams==
Although 111 teams registered for the PAIXP and paid the registration fee,
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/Complete_List_of_Registered_PIAXP_Teams.pdf| title= Registered Teams Overview| publisher=''[[X Prize Foundation]]| accessdate=10 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by 20 October 2009, the number of teams had decreased to 43, sponsoring 53 vehicles between them.&lt;ref name="progressiveautoxprize.org"/&gt;  These remaining teams represented 10 countries (some entries listed two countries of origin) with 28 coming from the United States and 7 from the state of California.  Of the 53 vehicles, 28 were in the Alternative Classes and 25 in the Mainstream Class.  By 15 April, only 30 teams remained. After the shakedown completed in May, 22 teams remained.&lt;ref name="shakedown"&gt;{{cite web|last=Evarts |first=Eric |title=Automotive X Prize: Final Shakedown results |url=http://blogs.consumerreports.org/cars/2010/05/automotive-x-prize-final-shakedown-results.html |publisher=[[Consumer Reports]] Cars Blog |accessdate=2010-05-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100517063031/http://blogs.consumerreports.org/cars/2010/05/automotive-x-prize-final-shakedown-results.html |archivedate=17 May 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A sample of the teams is shown below.

===Mainstream===
* American HyPower – The "Zams" is a modified 2009 Toyota Prius.  The all volunteer team based in Centennial, CO is composed of aerospace, electrical, and chemical engineers as well as entrepreneurs.  It focuses on improving fuel efficiency through the introduction of hydrogen and a proprietary fuel augmentation device. In addition, aerodynamic modifications were made to the stock vehicle which alone, significantly improve fuel efficiency.
* BITW Technologies- Demonstrated the use of Bio-Diesel as a renewable resource and curb our use of petroleum from other countries.
* Edison2 – Developers of [[the Very Light Car]], this Lynchburg, Va team of experts from auto endurance racing emphasize low weight and low aerodynamic drag as the key to automotive efficiency, and are entered in both alternative classes and the mainstream class.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7196">Bank Administration Institute (BAI) is a [[nonprofit organization]] in the United States that provides research, training, and thought leadership events for the [[financial services]] industry. Headquartered in [[Chicago|Chicago, IL]], '''BAI''' also operates Banking Strategies, a daily online financial services publication.

==Organization==
BAI's mission is to give financial services leaders confidence, information and resources in order to make smart business decisions, every day. BAI's mission is created on the belief that a strong financial services industry helps consumers, businesses, and communities thrive.

BAI's members include national and global [[bank]]s, [[credit union]]s, [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] and [[Loan|auto loan]] providers, [[Money services business|money service businesses]], and larger lending institutions. In 2016, over 250,000 financial services individuals at more than 1,500 financial services organizations took compliance and [[Professional development|professional training courses]] through BAI.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==History==
In 1924, several representatives of regional [[Audit|auditors']] groups met to discuss issues in the auditing industry. Later that same year they created a national organization—the National Association of Bank Auditors and Controllers (NABAC) —and began to hold annual conventions and distribute a magazine focused on financial industry topics.

In the 1940s, the NABAC established its own office—first in [[Cleveland]] and later in Chicago. And the organization began to provide both education and technical research for its members. In 1957, the organization set up the NABAC Research Institute as the first official, collective research effort for the banking industry.

In 1969, NABAC rebranded as Bank Administration Institute (BAI), and had approximately 8,000 member institutions across the U.S.

In 1981, BAI launched the first electronic information services—Innerline—providing 24-hour access to world news briefs, American Banker news service, financial information on 8,500 publicly held corporations, and email and online registration for BAI conferences.

As of 1997, BAI co-sponsored with ECCHO (Electronic Check Clearing House Organization) the National Electronic Check and Image Exchange Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eccho.org/about_overview.php |title=About ECCHO™ |publisher=ECCHO |accessdate=16 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419210713/http://eccho.org/about_overview.php |archivedate=19 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, BAI recognized 90 years of service to the financial services industry and provided more than 250,000 individuals with [[Compliance training|compliance]] and professional training.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Business lines==

BAI is organized into three major divisions: Research, Learning and Development, and Conferences and Events.

BAI's Research division conducts [[data analysis]] using account-level data provided from participating financial services organizations. Once data is gathered, the data is then analyzed and compiled using BAI's proprietary database. BAI uses the data in order to present individual organizations with a comparison of their data with the larger peer group of participating organizations. All individual company data is kept confidential, and competitive data is available to participating organizations only in [[Aggregate data|aggregate]]. As a non-profit organization, BAI does not provide advice or consulting as a part of its research services. Comparative data is presented without additional insight or opinion. BAI Research topics include industry trends, small business banking, retail banking, and commercial banking. Analytics that can be compared include deposit performance, forecasts, market opportunities, and branch performance.

BAI Learning and Development division maintains a software course catalog through BAI's proprietary learning management system, the BAI Learning Manager, which can be accessed and managed by training administrators. The catalog includes more than 250 courses for banks, credit unions, mortgage lenders, and other financial services organizations. Topics cover areas including financial regulations, compliance, professional skills, certifications, and [[Human resource management|human resources]] issues. Courses are available from entry to executive level. BAI's course catalog is regularly updated to reflect the latest regulatory trends and issues in compliance and can also be provided to a financial institution's own learning management platform. BAI compliance and professional training can be customized, is updated continually, and is compliant with national regulatory standards.

BAI's Conferences and Events division hosts several industry events with the help of sponsors. Events include a comprehensive banking conference, a global awards program learning conference, executive roundtables, certification programs, and [[Web conferencing|webinars]] throughout the year.

The following are a few of the main events:

* '''BAI Global Banking Innovation Awards''': An annual awards program that has operated since 2011, the BAI Global Banking Innovation Awards event recognizes innovators within the financial services industry worldwide. Nominations are submitted by the financial services organizations themselves, with winners selected by an independent judging panel, and given the awards at the annual ceremony. A majority of finalists and award winners have historically been awarded to financial services organizations located outside the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161012005832/en/CBW-Bank-Named-Innovative-Community-Based-Banking-Organization|title=CBW Bank Named Most Innovative Community-Based Banking Organization by BAI&amp;rsquo;s 2016 Global Banking Innovation Awards|website=www.businesswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''BAI Beacon''': Formerly two separate conferences—BAI Retail Delivery and BAI Payments Connect—BAI Beacon is a two-day "immersive experience" for those in the financial services industry. Topics include sales, marketing and product development, channel strategies, payments strategy and fraud, compliance, small business, analytics, and technology. In 2016, BAI Beacon served as the premiere of the U.S. FinTechStage. Speakers focus on innovation and industry trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gibson|first1=Rebecca|title=BAI Beacon|url=http://www.technologyrecord.com/Article/bai-beacon-56121#.V_6DW2U5mhY|website=TheRecord|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Webinars''': BAI offers a variety of webinars each year month based on topics deemed relevant to the financial services industry. Topics include regulatory updates, small business banking, mobile payments, retail banking, security and fraud, and key industry trends.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5323">In economics, the '''Backus–Kehoe–Kydland consumption correlation puzzle''', also known as the '''BKK puzzle''', is the observation that [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] is much less [[correlation|correlated]] across countries than [[Output (economics)|output]].

In an [[Arrow–Debreu model|Arrow–Debreu economy]], i.e. an economy with a [[Complete market|complete set of state-contingent markets]], country-specific output risks should be pooled and domestic consumption growth should not depend heavily on country-specific income shocks.  So according to theory we should observe that consumption is much more correlated across countries than output.  What [[David K. Backus|Backus]], [[Patrick J. Kehoe|Kehoe]] and [[Finn Kydland|Kydland]] found in their article from 1992 was the opposite, namely that consumption is much less correlated across countries than output.&lt;ref name="BackusKehoeKydland1992"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Backus | first1 = David K.| last2 = Kehoe | first2 = Patrick J.| last3 = Kydland | first3 = Finn E. | year=1992 |title= International Real Business Cycles | journal = [[Journal of Political Economy]] | volume = 100 | pages = 745–775 | doi = 10.1086/261838 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BackusKehoeKydland1995"&gt;{{Citation | last= Backus  | first= David K.  | last2= Kehoe  | first2= Patrick J.  | last3= Kydland  | first3= Finn E.  | year= 1995  | editor-last= Cooley  | editor-first= Tom  | editor-link = Thomas F. Cooley | contribution= International Business Cycles: Theory and Evidence  | title=Frontiers of Business Cycle Research | publisher= Princeton University Press  | isbn = 0-691-04323-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland (1992) calculate the correlation of [[Hodrick–Prescott filter|HP-filtered]] consumption and output for 11 advanced countries relative to the US. The measured average consumption correlation was .19, whereas the average output correlation was .31. [[Maurice Obstfeld|Obstfeld]] and [[Kenneth Rogoff|Rogoff]] (1996)&lt;ref name="ObstfeldRogoff1996"&gt;{{Citation | last= Obstfeld   | first= Maurice  | last2= Rogoff  | first2= Kenneth  | year= 1996 | title= Foundations of International Macroeconomics   | publisher= The MIT Press  | isbn = 978-0-262-15047-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  reports average correlation of OECD countries with world consumption (35 “benchmark” countries) of .43, whereas the average OECD country’s output correlation with world benchmark is 0.52. The really puzzling part of these results is not that consumption levels are not perfectly correlated, but that they are less correlated than output.  Apparently, there is hardly any risk sharing.

Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000) identifies this as one of the six major puzzles in international economics.&lt;ref name="ObstfeldRogoff2000"&gt;{{Citation  | last= Obstfeld   | first= Maurice  | last2= Rogoff  | first2= Kenneth  | year= 2000  | editor-last= Bernanke

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The others are the [[home bias in trade puzzle]], the [[equity home bias puzzle]], the [[Feldstein-Horioka puzzle|Feldstein-Horioka savings-investment correlations puzzle]], [[Real exchange-rate puzzles|the purchasing power and exchange rate disconnect puzzle]], and the Baxter-Stockman neutrality of exchange rate regime puzzle. It is also related to the [[Backus-Smith puzzle|Backus-Smith consumption-real exchange rate puzzle]].&lt;ref name="BackusSmith92"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Backus | first1 = David K.| last2 = Smith| first2 = Gregor W.| year=1993 |title= Consumption and real exchange rates in dynamic economies with non-traded goods | journal =Journal of International Economics | volume = 35| pages = 297–316 | doi = 10.1016/0022-1996(93)90021-O | issue = 3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attempts to account for the perceived anomaly ==
Stockman and Tesar (1995)&lt;ref name="StockmanTeser1995"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Stockman | first1 = Alan C.| last2 = Tesar | first2 = Linda L. | year=1995 |title= Tastes and Technology in a Two-Country Model of the Business Cycle: Explaining International Comovements | journal = [[American Economic Review]] | volume = 85 | pages = 168–185 | issue=1 | jstor=2118002}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests two means of breaking the link between prices and quantities and making it hard for households to smooth consumption by trade.  The first is nontraded goods: Suppose households like to consume goods that cannot be traded, like some services. If there is a positive technology shock raising their supply, they can’t [[consumption smoothing|smooth their consumption]] of these goods by exporting them abroad.  The second is "taste shocks": If consumption rises in one country without any change in the economic environment, it will borrow abroad, driving up the interest rate and inducing the foreign country to cut back on its consumption. So consumption could be negatively correlated across countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6392">'''Benjamin Hauwanga''', commonly known as '''B.H.''', (born 24 September 1961 in [[Tsumeb]], [[Oshikoto Region|Oshikoto]])  is a [[Namibia]]n businessman. His parents separated while he was a young boy; his mother single-handedly raised him, although his father visited the family regularly. He has eight siblings.

He was fascinated with business at a very young age; as a child he sold indigenous food after school to contribute to the household income while his mother worked as a [[domestic worker]]. As with every business, money is the key and the main objective: Whenever he got, he used the change to buy sweets and resold them at school to get more money and increase cash-flow.

At the age of nine, he started cleaning yards and got paid weekly. This was a great incentive for him but later he realized that the money coming in weekly was not enough to buy enough stock to satisfy the demand for the product (sweets) at school. He arranged to receive the money month-end; that improved the cash-flow and the stock levels. As the cash-flow improved, he bought a bicycle to extend his operations. The bicycle took him three years to pay off.

His first shop was a cardboard-box in front of his mother's house in the black township, called "the Location".

Mr Watyako Mumbala from Elim Omunda gwambala he is a founder of Wamu Group of Companies

==Business career==
Hauwanga opened his first spares shop in [[Ongwediva]], selling car parts. He grew this business from suppliers in [[Windhoek]] and [[Johannesburg]] and then to the world. He has several operations around the country and has expanded into neighboring [[Angola]]. His operations in Angola are property development; he has completed several projects in Angola.

Benjamin "BH" has branches of the BH Group of Companies across [[Namibia]] with branches in [[Kavango Region|Kavango]], [[Oshana]], [[Omusati]], [[Khomas]] and [[Ohangwena]].

Benjamin Hauwanga joins an elite group of Namibian businessmen in owning a private plane. His Beechcraft 55 Baron aircraft is believed to have cost around N$3 million. He says he bought it to improve the logistical dimensions of his business operations. He bought it from Rami Barnes, a South African entrepreneur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informante.web.na/index2.php?option%3Dcom_content%26do_pdf%3D1%26id%3D3688 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327081013/http://www.informante.web.na/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=3688 |archivedate=2012-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hauwanga is the owner of the Bennies Entertainment Park and Lodge in [[Ongwediva]].

==Controversies==
In 2008, Hauwanga was involved in a legal saga with another prominent businessman, [[Harold Pupkewitz]]. The legal showdown that erupted was over money that the BH businesses claim to have lost in non-existent orders and deliveries from Pupkewitz: the amount of money in discussion was N$4 947 250.60. The dispute arose from payments that BH Motor Spares alleges to have made to Pupkewitz for goods that they had neither ordered nor received from the motoring mogul. BH claims that Pupkewitz invoiced and collected money for the orders. The sum of N$4 947 250.60 is accordingly due, owing and payable by the defendant to the plaintiff which sum, the defendant, despite demand, fails and/or refuse to pay to the plaintiff.

Hauwanga was represented by Sisa Namandje law firm while Pupkewitz was represented by the Lorentz Hangula Inc. law firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informante.web.na/index2.php?option%3Dcom_content%26do_pdf%3D1%26id%3D2280 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327081031/http://www.informante.web.na/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=2280 |archivedate=2012-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, BH was also involved in a scandal with the grandson of the former president [[Sam Nujoma]]. Joseph Nakanyala, grandson of Nujoma, tried to extort Hauwanga by using Nujoma's cell phone in June purporting to be the former president. In SMSs, Nakanyala threatened to kill Hauwanga if he did not give him money. Nakanyala was caught red-handed by the police while stealing a briefcase with money from Nujoma's residence and he later claimed that Hauwanga had sent him.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Through thorough investigations it was concluded that Nakanyala made all the stories up in an attempt to extort Hauwanga. Nakanyala withdrew his claims and publicly apologized to Hauwanga through lawyer Sisa Namandje.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In a statement signed by Nakanyala, he acknowledged having made these allegations saying: "I had no basis and right at the time of making such allegations to accuse Mr Benjamin Hauwanga. I acknowledge and recognize that the allegations I made have injured the good reputation and name of Mr Hauwanga, and I unconditionally and unreservedly apologize to him , his family, friends and all those who have been affected and inconvenienced by the false allegations I made" the statement reads further. The two shook hands and embraced warmly after Nakanyala finished reading his apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informante.web.na/index2.php?option%3Dcom_content%26do_pdf%3D1%26id%3D5345 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327081041/http://www.informante.web.na/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=5345 |archivedate=2012-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
In 2011, Hauwanga received an honorary master's degree in Entrepreneurship (honoris causa) from the [[International University of Management]] (IUM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8545">The '''Brenner debate''' was a major debate amongst historians during the late 1970s and early 1980s, regarding the [[History of capitalism|origins of capitalism]].

It began with a 1976 journal article by [[Robert Brenner]].

Historians [[Trevor Aston]] and [[Charles Philpin|C. H. E. Philpin]] (1985) characterised the debate as 'one of the most important historical debates of recent years'.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Aston and C. H. E. Philpin, 'Preface', in ''The Brenner Debate: Agrarian Class Structure and Economic Development in Pre-Industrial Europe'', ed. by Trevor Aston and C.H.E. Philpin, Past and Present Publications (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985), p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The debate has been seen as a successor to the so-called "[[transition debate]]" (or Dobb-Sweezy debate) that followed [[Maurice Dobb|Maurice Dobb's]] 1946 ''Studies in the Development of Capitalism'',&lt;ref&gt;Chris Harman, '[http://pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk/isj102/harman.htm The Rise of Capitalism]', ''International Socialism Journal'', 102 (Spring 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[Paul Sweezy]]'s 1950 article "The Transition From Feudalism To Capitalism"), in the journal ''[[Science &amp; Society]]''. (These articles were subsequently collected and published as a book, also entitled ''The Transition from Feudalism to Capitalism'', in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;''The Transition from Feudalism to Capitalism'', ed. by R. H. Hilton (London: Verso, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt;
It began with Brenner's 1976 article "Agrarian Class Structure and Economic Development in Pre-Industrial Europe", in the influential historical journal ''[[Past &amp; Present (journal)|Past &amp; Present]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unc.edu/courses/2005fall/geog/160/001/GEC'05/brenner.pdf Agrarian Class Structure and Economic Development in Pre-Industrial Europe]. ''[[Past and Present (journal)|Past &amp; Present]]'' 70 (1976), pp.&amp;nbsp;30–74&lt;/ref&gt;
== The debate==
Brenner's thesis was the focus of a symposium in around 1977, several contributions to which also appeared in the pages of ''Past &amp; Present''. Brenner's article and the discussions that followed it have a broad significance for understanding the origins of [[capitalism]], and were foundational to so-called "[[Political Marxism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Meikisins Wood, ''The Origin of Capitalism: A Longer View'', 2nd edn (London: Verso, 2002), esp. pp. 50–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, [[Michael Postan]] and [[John Hatcher (historian)|John Hatcher]] characterised the debate as attempting to determine whether [[Malthusian]] cyclic explanations of population and development or [[social class]] explanations governed demographic and economic change in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;M. M. Postan, John Hatcher, "Population and Class relations in Feudal society" ''Past &amp; Present'' 78 (1) 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;  The debate challenged the prevalent views of regarding class relations in the [[economy of England in the Middle Ages]] in particular  – and agricultural societies with [[serfdom]] in general, as well as engaging the broader historiography of the economics of feudalism from the 20th century (in both the west and the Soviet Union).

Even though Brenner's key ideas have not achieved consensus,&lt;ref&gt;Shami Ghosh, 'Rural Economies and Transitions to Capitalism: Germany and England Compared (''c''.1200–''c''.1800)', ''The Journal of Agrarian Change'', 16.2 (April 2016), 255–90, DOI: 10.1111/joac.12096.&lt;/ref&gt; the debate has remained influential in 21st century scholarship,&lt;ref&gt;''Peasants into Farmers? The Transformation of Rural Economy and Society in the Low Countries (Middle Ages- 19th Century) in Light of the Brenner Debate'', ed. by Peter Hoppenbrouwers and Jan Luiten van Zanden, CORN Publication Series, 4 (Turnhout: Brepols, 2001), {{ISBN|250351006X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Meikisins Wood, ''The Origin of Capitalism: A Longer View'', 2nd ed. (London: Verso, 2002), esp. pp. 50–64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Dimmock, ''The Origin of Capitalism in England, 1400–1600'' (Leiden: Brill, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;
In the view of Shami Ghosh, Brenner's thesis proposed an explanatory framework for the evolution of what he called "agrarian capitalism", in England, during the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;blockquote&gt;[A] transformation of relationships between landlords and cultivators led to the creation of a largely free and competitive market in land and labour, while simultaneously dispossessing most of the peasants. Thus from the old class divisions of owners of land on the one hand, and an unfree peasantry with customary rights of use to land on the other, a new tripartite structure came into being, comprising landlords, free tenant farmers on relatively short-term market-determined leases and wage labourers; this Brenner defines as ‘agrarian capitalism’. Wage labourers were completely market-dependent – a rural proletariat – and tenant farmers had to compete on the land market in order to retain their access to land. This last fact was the principal motor of innovation leading to a rise in productivity, which, coupled with the growth of a now-free labour market, was essential for the development of modern (industrial) capitalism. Thus the transformations of agrarian class structures lay at the root of the development of capitalism in England.{{cn|date=June 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Publication==

Brenner's original article, and the symposium on it, led to a series of publications in ''Past &amp; Present'':

* Brenner, Robert (1976). ‘Agrarian Class Structure and Economic Development in Pre-Industrial Europe,’ ''Past &amp; Present'', 70, February, pp.&amp;nbsp;30–75.

These studies were republished with some additional material in ''The Brenner Debate: Agrarian Class Structure and Economic Development in Pre-Industrial Europe'', ed. by Trevor Aston and C.H.E. Philpin, Past and Present Publications (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985), {{ISBN|0521268176}}, which was to be reprinted many times.

A related and parallel debate also took place in the pages of the ''[[New Left Review]]'':

* Brenner, Robert (1977). ‘The Origins of Capitalist Development: A Critique of Neo-Smithian Marxism‘, ''New Left Review'', I/104, July–August pp.&amp;nbsp;25–92.
* [[Paul Sweezy|Sweezy, Paul]] (1978). ‘Comment on Brenner,’ ''New Left Review'', I/108, March–April, pp.&amp;nbsp;94–5
* Brenner, Robert (1978). ‘Reply to Sweezy,’ ''New Left Review'', I/108, March–April, pp.&amp;nbsp;95–6
* Fine, Ben (1978). ‘On the Origins of Capitalist Development,’ ''New Left Review'', I/109, May–June, pp.&amp;nbsp;88–95

As of 2016, Brenner's most recent statements of his ideas, making some small modifications to his earlier claims, were:

* Brenner, R., 1985. ‘The Social Basis of Economic Development’. In ''Analytical Marxism'', ed. J. Roemer, 25–53. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.
* Brenner, R., 2001. ‘The Low Countries in the Transition to Capitalism’. ''Journal of Agrarian Change'', 1: 169–241.
* Brenner, R., 2007. ‘Property and Progress: Where Adam Smith Went Wrong’. In ''Marxist History-Writing for the Twenty-First Century'', ed. C. Wickham, 49–111. Oxford: Oxford University Press.

It would only begin to experience significant consolidation from 2012 onwards.

After some controversy in the first part of the 20th Century, it has been generally agreed that regulation of the '''Canadian accounting profession''' falls within provincial jurisdiction over matters of a local and private nature,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;held ''[[obiter]]'' by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in {{cite CanLII|litigants=Reference Re Securities Act|link=Reference Re Securities Act|year=2011|court=scc|num=6|pinpoint=par. 34|parallelcite=[2011] 3 SCR 837|date=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as under the provincial education power with respect to training for achieving such professional qualifications.{{sfn|Richardson|Kilfoyle|2012|p=9}}

==Creation of different specialties==
===Chartered accountants===
====Organization of provincial societies====
Demand for trained accountants arose as early as the 1840s, when the first Canadian professional accounting firms were organized in [[Toronto]] and [[Montreal]].{{sfn|Richardson|1996|p=89}}

The Association of Accountants in Montreal was organized as the first accounting organization in North America in 1879&lt;ref name="5Things"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.canadian-accountant.com/content/business/canada-150-five-things-you-didn-t-know-about-the-history-of-accounting-in-canada|title= Canada 150: Five things you didn't know about the history of accounting in Canada|last= Ellis|first= Colin|date= June 30, 2017|publisher= Canadian Accountant}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and only the fifth such organization in the world),{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=559}} and was incorporated by an Act of the [[Legislative Assembly of Quebec]].&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title = An Act to incorporate the Association of Accountants in Montreal|abbr = S.Q.|year = 1880|chapter = 88|link = https://books.google.com/books?id=PoMwAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA265&amp;ots=WFl3OaPENZ&amp;pg=PA404#v=onepage&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ontario would follow several weeks later with the formation of the Institute of Accountants and Adjusters of Ontario,&lt;ref name="5Things"/&gt; which was later incorporated as the Institute of Accountants of Ontario in 1883 under the direction of E.R.C.

====Attempt to nationalize the profession====
Tensions erupted following a disciplinary hearing in 1890 held by the Institute of Accountants of Ontario into an audit conducted with respect to [[Confederation Life]].{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=561}} While the action itself affirmed the importance of auditor independence, it caused a rift in the IAO membership and the resignation of several prominent members of the governing Council in 1891.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=561}}

The early CA bodies, with the exception of the AAM, also started to relax their entrance requirements to allow the admission of accountants who were not in public practice.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=563}} An initial effort to create a national organization in 1901 was quashed due to local opposition, but this caused a concerted effort, sponsored by the AAM, to create one that would be restricted to practicing accountants.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=563}} As a result, the Dominion Association of Chartered Accountants ("DACA") was created in 1902, in an attempt to create a national status for the profession through direct entry of qualified applicants to membership.&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =An Act to incorporate the Dominion Association of Chartered Accountants|abbr =S.C.|year =1902|chapter =58|link= https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1902v02cana#page/67/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ontario passed an Act in 1908 granting the ICAO exclusive rights to the CA designation,&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title = An Act to revise and amend The Chartered Accountants Act|abbr = S.O.|year = 1908|chapter = 42|link = https://archive.org/stream/statutesofprovin1908onta#page/386/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, on DACA's petition, the [[Governor in Council]] [[Disallowance and reservation|disallowed]] it in 1909, on grounds of [[Paramountcy (Canada)|federal paramountcy]] in having created a national body, as described in a memo by [[Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada]] [[Allen Bristol Aylesworth|Sir Allen Aylesworth]] recommending the measure.&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{cite web|title = P.C. 870: Disallowance Statute of Ontario, Cap. 42., intituled An Act to Revise and Amend the Chartered Accountants Act - Min.

DACA would become the [[Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants]] in 1951.&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =An Act respecting the Dominion Association of Chartered Accountants|abbr =S.C.|year =1951|chapter =89|link= https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1951v02cana#page/113/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would expand internationally in 1973, when the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bermuda was incorporated and subsequently obtained affiliation with the CICA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Fox|first= David|date= July 9, 2014|title= Bermuda accountants unite under single umbrella organisation|url= http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20140709/BUSINESS03/140709721|work= [[The Royal Gazette (Bermuda)|The Royal Gazette]]|location= [[Hamilton, Bermuda]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Certified general accountants===
The creation of large business and governmental organizations increased the demand for accountants on their payrolls, which called for efforts to address their unique needs without the necessity of [[apprenticeship]]s demanded by the CA firms.{{sfn|Richardson|1996|p=89}} The Canadian Association of Accountants was formed in 1908,{{sfn|Richardson|1996|p=89}} arising from a technical self-study group of accountants working at the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]],{{sfn|Richardson|2000|p=110}} which led to the creation of the General Accountants Association in 1913.{{efn|It had to change its name because of opposition from the CA bodies, as "CAA" would have been too similar a designation to use.{{sfn|Richardson|1996|p=89}}}}&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =An Act to incorporate the General Accountants Association|abbr =S.C.|year =1913|chapter =116|link= https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1913v02cana#page/193/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite initial assurances that its members would refrain from practicing public accounting, it began advertising examinations in that field in 1917, thus triggering conflicts with the CA bodies that would last for decades.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=573}}

Because of such protracted opposition, it was only in 1999 that the GAA was able to change its name to the [[Certified General Accountants Association of Canada]].&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =An Act respecting the Certified General Accountants Association of Canada|abbr =S.C.|year =1999|chapter =38|link= https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1999v02cana#page/n296/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, portions of its membership would be admitted into membership of other professional bodies, such as the admission into Quebec's Association of Accountants in 1920,&lt;ref group="na"&gt;S.Q. 1919-20, c. 118&lt;/ref&gt; the CGA/CA merger in Quebec in 1946,{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=592}} the CGA/CPA merger in 1949,{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=595}} and the CGA/CPA merger in Manitoba in 1950.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=595}}

===Cost and management accounting: from CA possession to the creation of RIAs and CMAs===
Towards the end of the [[First World War]], several significant issues forced organizations to invest resources into the creation of [[cost accounting]] functions:{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=566}}

:* the [[Russian Revolution]], together with worldwide labour unrest, created pressure on business organizations to demonstrate that they were earning fair returns;
:* wartime procurement by the [[Imperial Munitions Board]] and the introduction of [[income tax]]&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title = The Business Profits War Tax Act, 1916|abbr = S.C.|year = 1916|chapter = 11|link = https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1916v01cana#page/60/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title = The Income War Tax Act, 1917|abbr = S.C.|year = 1917|chapter = 28|link = https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1917v01cana#page/170/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; necessitated proving the actual cost of manufacturing goods; and
:* the high rate of postwar bankruptcies brought about by the [[Post–World War I recession]] and the [[Depression of 1920–21]] created the need to demonstrate that the price of manufactured goods covered their cost.

In a move designed to prevent the newly-created General Accountants Association from moving into that field,{{sfn|Richardson|2000|p=110}} DACA created the Canadian Society of Cost Accountants ("CSCA"), with membership originally restricted to chartered accountants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= The Canadian Society of Cost Accountants|url= https://archive.org/stream/canadianchartere10canauoft#page/30/mode/2up|journal= The Canadian Chartered Accountant|location= Toronto|publisher= Dominion Association of Chartered Accountants|date= July 1920|volume = X|issue = 1|pages = 31{{en dash}}34|accessdate= June 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CSCA would initiate efforts to standardize education in cost accounting, and entered into an affiliation agreement with the US [[National Association of Cost Accountants]] in 1922.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=580}} When the CSCA tried to obtain NACA's educational materials at a more reasonable cost in 1926, NACA proposed a merger of the two organizations. This was rejected, and the affiliation was subsequently dissolved.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|pp=582-583}} The Society began to issue "Certificates of efficiency" in 1927 to its graduates.{{sfn|Allan|1982|p= 21}}{{sfn|Richardson|1996|p=90}}

In the 1930s, there would be internal tensions as to what areas of company accounting the CSCA should focus on, and, in 1939, members wishing to concentrate more on [[management accounting]] left to form the Controllers' Institute of Canada (later part of the [[Financial Executives International|Financial Executives Institute]]).{{sfn|Richardson|1996|p=90}}

When provincial societies began to be formed in 1941, the "Registered Industrial and Cost Accountant" ("RIA") was created for its members.{{sfn|Richardson|2000|p=112}}&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title = The Society of Industrial and Cost Accountants of Ontario Act, 1941|abbr = S.O.|year = 1941|chapter = 77|link = https://archive.org/stream/statutesofprovin1941onta#page/316/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative was generally accepted in most provinces, but there was resistance in British Columbia as the promoters of that effort were only CGAs and independent accountants.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=591}} It would pass only when the enabling Act specified that the RIA designation was available only to those members who were also CAs.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=591}}

The designation was simplified as "Registered Industrial Accountant" in some, but not all, provinces around 1967.&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title = The Society of Industrial Accountants of Ontario Act, 1967|abbr = S.O.|year = 1967|chapter = 129|link = https://archive.org/stream/statutesofprovin1967onta#page/548/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would be replaced by the [[Certified Management Accountants of Canada|Certified Management Accountant]] ("CMA") designation beginning in 1976,{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=611}} but the province-by-province implementation would be completed only in 1985.

===Certified public accountants: the first CPAs===
The first Canadian CPA designation arose from several parallel moves:

:* In Quebec, the Licentiate in Accountancy was first granted by [[McGill University]] in 1918,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/about/history|title= Desautels: History|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website= mcgill.ca|publisher= [[Desautels Faculty of Management]], [[McGill University]]|access-date= September 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was granted statutory recognition as a professional designation in 1920.&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Loi constituant en corporation l'Association des comptables|abbr =S.Q.|year =1919-20|chapter =118|link= https://www.bibliotheque.assnat.qc.ca/DepotNumerique_v2/AffichageFichier.aspx?idf=126287}}{{fr-icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently replaced by "Certified Public Accountant" in 1927.&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Loi modifiant la Loi des comptables|abbr =S.Q.|year =1927|chapter =61|link= https://www.bibliotheque.assnat.qc.ca/DepotNumerique_v2/AffichageFichier.aspx?idf=123700}}{{fr-icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* In English Canada, the Society of Incorporated Accountants and Auditors was formed in 1918 and incorporated in 1919 by members of the GAA.&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= December 13, 1919|title= The Society of Incorporated Accountants and Auditors|url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/databases/canada-gazette/093/001060-119.01-e.php?document_id_nbr=14647&amp;f=p|journal= [[Canada Gazette]]|volume= 53|issue= 24|page= 1783}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would become the United Accountants and Auditors of Canada in 1920,&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= May 29, 1920|title= Society of Incorporated Accountants and Auditors|url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/databases/canada-gazette/093/001060-119.01-e.php?document_id_nbr=6680&amp;f=p|journal= [[Canada Gazette]]|volume= 53|issue= 48|page= 4140}}&lt;/ref&gt; conferring the "United Accountant" ("UA") designation.{{sfn|Richardson|1993a|pp=221-222}}{{efn|The UA designation was held not to infringe the protected designation of CA.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Institute of Chartered Accountants of Manitoba v Bellamy|year=1926|court=MBQB|num=242|format=canlii|parallelcite=[1926] 4 DLR 230|date=1926-07-07|courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} It would later engage in a failed attempt to take over the GAA.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=576}}
:* In Ontario, the UAs (formed mainly from accountants and auditors working in government tax offices){{sfn|Richardson|Kilfoyle|2012|p=10}} were successful in obtaining statutory recognition as the Association of Accountants and Auditors.

The CPAs subsequently gained statutory recognition in most, but not all, provinces. Because of CA opposition in Nova Scotia, it was only able to use the designation of "Registered Public Accountant".{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=598}}

===Accredited public accountants===
The "International Society of Commerce" ("ISC") was first noted in an advertisement in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], as early as 1921,{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=578}} and its members were conferred with the designation of "Accredited Public Accountant" ("APA"). The ISC, located in [[Winnipeg]], formed the "Institute of Accredited Public Accountants" in 1938,{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=587}} which was federally incorporated in 1946.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=592}}&lt;ref name="CIAPA"/&gt; It initially attempted to organize a provincial institute in British Columbia in 1937, but failed to receive legislative approval.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=587}}

When Quebec consolidated the auditing profession in 1946, APAs in the province who had practiced accounting continuously from 1942 received statutory recognition in Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;S.Q. 1946, c. 47,s. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The APA designation later received statutory protection in New Brunswick, Manitoba and Saskatchewan.

An attempt was made to form a body in Ontario by way of [[private bill]] in 1949,&lt;ref group="nc"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/v1ontariobills1949ontauoft#page/65/mode/1up Bill 5, 1st Session, 23rd Legislature] (Ontario, 1949)&lt;/ref&gt; but it was withdrawn at second reading on grounds advanced by the CA and CPA bodies that a [[public bill]] would be a more appropriate choice for action.&lt;ref name="HansardON1949" group="nc"&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction= Ontario|title= Institute of Accredited Public Accountants of Ontario|url= https://archive.org/stream/v2hansard1949ontauoft#page/1223/mode/1up|house= [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]]|date= March 24, 1949|page_start= 1223|page_end= 1226}}&lt;/ref&gt; That option was never subsequently pursued. Similar efforts to secure recognition in British Columbia and Alberta were also pursued at the time,&lt;ref name="HansardON1949" group="nc"/&gt; but they failed as well. Provincial societies were later organized in British Columbia and Ontario in 1957.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|pp=597, 599}}

The APAs would later consolidate with other accounting organizations. They merged with the CPAs in New Brunswick in 1952, but other APAs revived the organization in 1961.{{efn|reactivated upon [[writ of mandamus]] issued by the [[New Brunswick Court of Appeal]]&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Ex Parte Goodwin et al|link=|year=1961|court=nbca|num=421|format=canlii|parallelcite=27 DLR (2d) 667|date=1961-03-24|courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Later efforts by other provincial bodies to merge with the CGAs proved to be more conclusive. The Ontario society, however, decided in 1963 to restrict its membership to those members who held public accounting licenses. As no future licenses would be conferred on APAs after 1962 as a result of that year's reorganization of the Public Accountants Council, it would gradually cease to exist over time.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=603}}

While the APA designation is not now recognized by any Canadian jurisdiction as a professional designation in active usage, the Canadian Institute of Accredited Public Accountants continues to exist,&lt;ref name="CIAPA"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ic.gc.ca/app/scr/cc/CorporationsCanada/fdrlCrpDtls.html?corpId=462195|title= Federal Corporation Information - 046219-5|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=ic.gc.ca|access-date= April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in alliance with the Society of Professional Accountants of Canada.{{sfn|Richardson|Kilfoyle|2012|p=13}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ic.gc.ca/app/scr/cc/CorporationsCanada/fdrlCrpDtls.html?corpId=2744503|title= Federal Corporation Information - 274450-3|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=ic.gc.ca|access-date= April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SPAC confers the APA designation as an [[title of honor|honorary title]] to [[registered professional accountant|Registered Professional Accountant]]s of distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://professionalaccountant.org/about-spac/designations/|title= Designations|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website= professionalaccountant.org|publisher= Society of Professional Accountants of Canada|access-date= April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation of uniform accounting standards==
From 1946, the chartered accountants took the initiative to codify [[generally accepted accounting principles]] and [[generally accepted auditing standards]] in Canada:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://accountinghistory.blogspot.ca/2011/11/brief-history-of-evolution-of.html|title= A Brief History of Accounting and Auditing Standards in Canada|last= Roy|first= Paul-Émile|date= November 16, 2011|website= accountinghistory.blogspot.ca|publisher= Digital Archives for Chartered Accountants}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* DACA's Accounting and Auditing Research Committee began to issuing bulletins in 1946, setting out recommended standards of practice on accounting and auditing.
:* The CICA started the production of research studies in 1963 on topics of current interest to the profession.
:* The ''CICA Handbook'' was created in 1968 to consolidate the CICA's pronouncements. Its requirements would attain mandatory in 1975, through regulations issued under the ''[[Canada Business Corporations Act]]''.&lt;ref group="na"&gt;currently the {{Cite canlaw|link= http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2001-512/section-70.html|type= reg|regtitle= Canada Business Corporations Regulations, 2001|regnumber= SOR/2001-512}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] and [[International Auditing Standards]] would be incorporated by reference in the ''Handbook'', effective in 2011.
:* It would be renamed in 2014 as the ''CPA Canada Handbook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.cpacanada.ca/en/business-and-accounting-resources/cpa-canada-handbook-the-standards-and-guidance-collection|title= CPA Canada Handbook: The standards and guidance collection|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |publisher= [[CPA Canada]] |access-date= April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Licensing of public accounting==
In addition to conferring exclusive rights to use specified designations on the members of the various professional bodies, most provinces have also required those who pursued [[public accounting]] to obtain a separate permit. The permit is issued by:

#a specified professional body, either with or without the supervision of a provincial agency;
#a provincial agency (which could be effectively dominated by a professional body), either generally or where a qualified accountant does not belong to a specified body (as in BC from 1973).&lt;ref group="na"&gt;''Companies Act'', S.B.C. 1973, c. 18, s. 203; currently {{Cite canlaw|short title  =Business Corporations Act|abbr =S.B.C.|year =2002|chapter =57|part =7|division =4|link=http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/02057_08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=609}}

==Consolidation: Rise of the Chartered Professional Accountants (2012-)==
===Implementation by jurisdiction===
The various provincial bodies were federated nationally in the following bodies:

:* [[Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants]]

Yukon also grants an honorary designation known as "CPA (Hon)".

Alberta has opted to allow all those with legacy designations to use them in conjunction with "CPA" during the first 10 years from July 1, 2015, or to use the legacy designation alone during that time. After the 10-year transition period, the "CPA" designation can be used on its own by such legacy holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Designation Use|url = http://www.cpaalberta.ca/Members/Designation-Use|publisher = CPA Alberta|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150704204438/http://www.cpaalberta.ca/Members/Designation-Use|archivedate = 2015-07-04|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on the Canadian landscape===
During the years running up to the 2012-2018 consolidation, as well as thereafter, there has been debate as to the practical impact of the merger.

The 2010-2011 CA/CMA position paper on the proposed merger gave five reasons why it should be pursued:{{sfn|Richardson|Kilfoyle|2012|pp=19-22}}

#The existing regulatory framework was complex and costly.
#The differences in the functions pursued by the various designation holders were disappearing.
#A strong Canadian voice was needed on the world stage.
#It was necessary to compete with other accounting designations that were going global, such as the [[Chartered Global Management Accountant]] (promoted by the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] and the [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants]]) and [[CPA Australia]].
#It was desirable to act proactively, instead of waiting for reforms imposed by various governments.

There was significant resistance by the CA membership at the time, who were concerned that their collective image would be diminished as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Richardson|first1= Alan J.|last2= Jones|first2= D.G. Brian|year= 2007|title= Professional "brand", personal identity and resistance to change in the Canadian accounting profession: a comparative history of two accounting association merger negotiations|url= http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1032373207076035|journal= Accounting History|publisher= |volume= 12|issue= 2|pages=  135{{en dash}}164|doi= 10.1177/1032373207076035|issn=1032-3732|accessdate=May 16, 2014}} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the consolidation, the following observations have been made:

#Based on a [[social network theory]] analysis, it appears that those associated with the former chartered accountant bodies have generally had a disproportionate impact in the attainment of [[political power]] within the new CPA bodies, extending even to ousting the [[knowledge base]] that had been accumulated within the other legacy bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Richardson|first1= Alan J.|date= 2017|title= Merging the Profession: A Social Network Analysis of the Consolidation of the Accounting Profession in Canada|url= |journal= Accounting Perspectives|volume= 16|issue= 2|pages= 83–104|doi= 10.1111/1911-3838.12139}} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The new CPA bodies have adopted a more passive approach in recruiting new members, in contrast to the activity undertaken by the previous legacy bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Brouard|first1= François|last2= Bujaki|first2= Merridee|last3= Durocher|first3= Sylvain|date=2017 |title= Attracting Prospective Professional Accountants Before and After the CPA Merger in Canada|url= |journal= Accounting Perspectives|volume= 16|issue= 2|pages= 105–127|doi= 10.1111/1911-3838.12138}} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign professional bodies active in Canada==
As possession of a Canadian professional accounting designation is not generally a mandatory requirement to hold a Canadian financial position, other professional bodies have members who also work in Canada, of which the most significant are:

:* [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Official website|https://www.cimaglobal.com/Our-locations/Canada/|name=CIMA - Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sintering mould and [[Electrode]]s are similar to those employed in field assisted sintering techniques ('''FAST''') such as [[spark plasma sintering]] and '''single electromagnetic pulse sintering technologies'''.

The method, analogous to resistive sintering, is a direct evolution of a welding technology named '''Capacitor Discharge Welding''' ([[:de:Widerstandsschweißen|Kondensator-Impulsschweißen]]). CDS seems like an improvement of the less powerful capacitor discharge compaction patented by W.Knoess and M.Schlemmer (EP 0671232, US Patent 5529746).

Advantages of the technique are:
* short sintering time (less than one second)
* no need for a controlled atmosphere even during sintering of highly reactive materials such as [[titanium]]
* the ability to obtain [[metastable]] and [[nanocrystalline]] materials (see [http://www.eposintering.com/refereed/capacitor-discharge-sintering-of-nanocrystalline-copper/ Capacitor discharge sintering of nanocrystalline copper])

==Disambiguation==

Other authors also refer to this technology as spark plasma compaction (in reference to the well known [[Spark Plasma Sintering]] with whom it has in common only the use of electric currents).

==Developments==
Capacitor discharge sintering is at an experimental/research stage of development in Germany at the Ruhr-Universität Bochum where a prototype machine is installed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifam-dd.fraunhofer.de/fhg/Images/411_Ses41_Tillmann_040_FINAL_v3_tcm260-175569.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Industrialization and evolution of the technology is ongoing in [http://www.eposintering.com EPoS srl], a [[start-up company]] from [[Torino]]. EPoS has patented a CDS based process which is claimed to produce components with improved properties at a competitive production cost. The company active since 2010 is employing solely proprietary technologies based on CDS to develop and produce [[abrasives]], [[cemented carbide]] blanks, and a wide range of components produced with metallic alloys, semiconductors and [[composite material|composites]].

{{Big Five Hawaii}}
'''Castle &amp; Cooke, Inc.''', is a [[Los Angeles]]-based company that was once part of the [[Big Five (Hawaii)|Big Five companies]] in [[Territory of Hawaii|territorial Hawaii]]. The company at one time did most of its business in [[agriculture]] including becoming, through mergers the modern [[Dole Food Company]], the world's largest producer of fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biz.yahoo.com/ic/10/10303.html|title=Dole Food Company, Inc. Company Profile|publisher=Yahoo! Finance|accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1996 it was spun off from Dole and today most of the company's business is in [[real estate]] and residential, commercial, and retail development.

== History ==
Castle &amp; Cooke was founded in 1851 as a partnership between [[Samuel Northrup Castle]] and [[Amos Starr Cooke]] as a department store that sold farm tools, sewing equipment, and medicine. Joseph Ballard Atherton joined as clerk in 1858 and rose to become partner by 1865.&lt;ref name="CandC"&gt;{{cite book |author=Castle &amp; Cooke|title=The first 100 years: a report on the operations of Castle &amp; Cooke for the years 1851-1951 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_ibRAAAAMAAJ |year=1951 |publisher=Castle and Cooke, Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few decades, the company invested heavily in Hawaii's sugar industry, running plantations in [[Kohala, Hawaii|Kohala]] and [[Haiku, Hawaii|Haiku]]. Atherton became president after the deaths of Cooke in 1871 and Castle in 1894, when the company incorporated. After the death of Atherton, George Parmele Castle (1851–1932) became president. G.P. Castle retired in 1916 and Edward Davies Tenney became chairman.&lt;ref name="men"&gt;{{cite book |title= Men of Hawaii: being a biographical reference library, complete and authentic, of the men of note and substantial achievement in the Hawaiian Islands |publisher= [[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] |year=1921 |editor=John William Siddall |page= 85 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4o8DAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA85 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1910s, the company, along with three other Big Five companies, invested in [[Matson Navigation Company]]. Tenney became president of Matson after [[William Matson]]'s death. In 1931, the company also bought a 21 percent share of the Hawaiian Pineapple Company, which was later renamed the [[Dole Food Company]]. After the death of Tenney, Alexander G. Budge became president in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Castle &amp; Cooke, Inc. |work= Funding Universe company history |url= http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Castle-amp;-Cooke-Inc-Company-History.html |accessdate= May 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Castle &amp; Cooke bought the remaining shares of Dole in 1961.

Between 1964 and 1968, Castle &amp; Cooke acquired the [[Standard Fruit Company]], adding bananas and other tropical fruits to its existing pineapple operations. In 1976, it acquired Bud Antle Inc., a California-based lettuce and celery farmer; it was renamed Dole Fresh Vegetables in 1989.

The company maintained Dole's large pineapple plantations throughout the state, including a particularly large one on the island of [[Lanai]], where Castle &amp; Cooke owned about 95 percent of the island.

In the decades that followed, Castle &amp; Cooke began to face severe financial trouble as Hawaii's agriculture industry weakened. In 1985, the company merged with the Flexi-Van Corporation, a transportation leasing company. In 1991, the company was renamed Dole Food Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/13/business/hawaiian-merger-for-flexi-van.html|title=HAWAIIAN MERGER FOR FLEXI-VAN|first=|last=Andrew Pollack|date=13 March 1985|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the real estate operations of The Dole Food Company were spun off as the newly reformed company Castle &amp; Cooke. The new Castle &amp; Cooke was bought by Dole CEO, [[David H. Murdock]], who remains the CEO of Castle &amp; Cooke today.

On May 2, 2012 (made public in June), [[Oracle Corp.]] CEO [[Larry Ellison]] signed an agreement to buy most of the 6th largest Hawaiian island of [[Lanai]] from Castle &amp; Cooke for $300 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/blog/2016/01/pbn-confirms-amount-billionaire-larry-ellison-paid.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent Developments ==

In April 2016, their project in Koa Ridge that had faced extensive delays was approved by the Hawaii State Supreme Court. The project aims to build 3,500 homes, which were initially valued at $300,000 each. Construction is set to begin in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shimogawa|first1=Duane|title=Castle &amp; Cooke's 3,500-home Koa Ridge project to move ahead|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/news/2016/04/06/castle-cookes-3-500-home-koa-ridge-project-to-move.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Contemporary''' is an itinerant museum of [[contemporary art]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], in the United States. It does not collect artworks. It was started as the '''Contemporary Museum''' by George Ciscle in 1989. During its first decade, it had no fixed home, but instead was "dedicated to redefining the concept of the museum". It sponsored exhibitions in a variety of non-traditional spaces around Baltimore,&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Judith E. "Sins of Omission." Art in America. October 1993. p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as borrowing space in partnering institutions such as the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]], [[Maryland Historical Society]], [[Peabody Conservatory]] and [[Walters Art Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contemporary.org/about.html|title=About Us|publisher=Contemporary Museum|accessdate=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the Contemporary Museum moved to 100 W. Centre Street, one block from the Walters, in the [[Mount Vernon, Baltimore|Mount Vernon]] neighborhood of downtown Baltimore, where it organized exhibitions and related programming for nearly ten years. In 2011, the museum moved out of the W. Centre Street space and organized projects in neighboring institutions and buildings.

The museum suspended operations in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20130628170512/http://contemporary.org/ Contemporary Museum Baltimore, accessed 06/28/2013&lt;/ref&gt; but in September 2013 announced that it would re-open under a new name, The Contemporary, after a year spent "reimagining the organization's mission, vision and operating structure".&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20130907115419/http://www.contemporary.org/ The Contemporary, accessed 09/07/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a direct descendant of [[Christopher Columbus]] by way of Christopher's son, [[Diego Columbus|Diego]]. From Diego, Colón de Carvajal also holds the [[Duchy of Veragua]] since 1986. As the Duchy corresponds to the present-day [[Veraguas Province]] of the independent republic of [[Panama]], Colón de Carvajal maintains close connections with Panamanian society, and serves on the advisory board of Petaquilla Minerals, a mining company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.petaquilla.com/newsrelease.aspx?petaquilla=Don%20Cristobal%20Colon%20de%20Carvajal%20Joins%20Advisory%20Board%20of%20Petaquilla%20Minerals%20Ltd|title = Don Cristobal Colon de Carvajal Joins Advisory Board of Petaquilla Minerals Ltd.|date = May 10, 2012|publisher = Petaquilla Minerals Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Colón inherited from his father the [[Cristóbal Colón de Carvajal, 17th Duke of Veragua|17th Duke of Veragua]] all of his titles after he was murdered by [[Basque people|Basque]] nationalist terrorist group [[Euskadi Ta Askatasuna|ETA]].

In 2011, his additional title as [[Duchy of Vega|Duke of Vega]] was among many to be spun away to different recipients, with the new Duke of Vega being Colón's son, [[Ángel Santiago Colón de Mandalúniz]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://titulosnobleza.blogspot.com/2011/04/nuevas-concesiones-de-titulos.html Nuevas Concesiones de Títulos Nobiliarios], [[Blog]] ''Títulos Nobiliarios''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2011/04/20/pdfs/BOE-A-2011-7102.pdf Real Carta de Sucesión]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6157">[[Image:Deloss Walker - painted portrait.JPG|frame|Deloss Walker, founder of Walker + Associates, Inc.]]
'''Vernon Deloss Walker''' (August 14, 1931 – April 19, 1996) was a notable advertising executive and political campaign consultant. Walker founded the [[Memphis, Tennessee]]-based advertising firm Walker + Associates, Inc. in October 1965. Walker played a major role in politics, corporate marketing and philanthropy throughout the South from the 1960s to 1990s.

==Political campaign consulting==
Noted by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine as a political Media Mesmerist,&lt;ref&gt;"The Media Mesmerists" ''Time'', October 30, 1978, www.time.com&lt;/ref&gt; Walker and his firm consulted with and managed the successful campaigns of some of the South’s most preeminent politicians, including [[Albert Gore Jr.]] and [[Jim Sasser]] of Tennessee, [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Dale Bumpers]] of Arkansas, [[Fob James]] of Alabama, and [[Joe Frank Harris]] of Georgia.

Recalling Alabama's 1978 Governor’s race in which Fob James defeated a number of seasoned political veterans, Alabama political columnist Steve Flowers wrote, "Fob realized he was no political professional ...&amp;nbsp;so he sought out professional advice. He had the money to think big and wanted to know who the best political consultant in the South was. It was an easy answer: Deloss Walker, a political public relations genius who lived in Memphis, Tenn. His track record for electing governors of southern states was 5–0. The scenario was the same for all five upset victories. He took an obscure, unknown candidate and elected him governor over a well-known incumbent or favorite. He had just taken an unknown school board member named Dale Bumpers and made him Governor of Arkansas. Deloss Walker was the most renowned and expensive political guru in the country in 1977."&lt;ref&gt;"The 1978 Governor’s Race was Certainly One for the Record Books" Steve Flowers, October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1998 autobiography Joe Frank Harris, ''Personal Reflections on a Public Life'', the former Governor of Georgia recalls the hiring of Deloss Walker and Walker + Associates to run his campaign in 1982: "The broadcast and newspaper media are, of course, a potent force, and if you can gain access to them effectively and with enough repetition, you can move name identification along very quickly. We were able to do that with the assistance of Deloss Walker and Walker and Associates, a public relations group from Memphis, Tennessee whom I had met though a mutual friend…At the time we signed on Deloss had handled some fifty political campaigns and had won all but two of them."&lt;ref&gt;Joe Frank Harris, ''Personal Reflections on a Public Life'', Mercer University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertising agency leader==
Deloss Walker's firm, Walker + Associates, Inc. has served a variety of notable clients, including the regional co-op for [[McDonald's]], the Tennessee Department of Tourist Development, and [[Lucite]] International. In 1987, Deloss Walker was named the Silver Medal Award&lt;ref name="memphisadfed.org"&gt;http://www.memphisadfed.org&lt;/ref&gt; winner. The award is the Memphis Advertising Federation's&lt;ref name="memphisadfed.org"/&gt; highest honor, recognizing an "entire career of outstanding accomplishment and contribution in advertising."

Since 1996, the firm has been led by president and chief executive officer Ceil Walker.&lt;ref&gt;"40 Years and Counting – Walker + Associates Makes its Mark in Satisfaction, Longevity" The Commercial Appeal, December 23, 2007, www.commercialappeal.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"After Deloss" The Memphis Flyer, February 5, 1998, wwwmemphisflyer.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Deloss Walker was born in [[O'Kean, Arkansas|O'Kean, AR.]]   He attended Southern Baptist College, in Walnut Ridge, Ark. Walker served in the [[Korean War]] and was awarded the [[Bronze Star]] in combat in the [[battle of Heartbreak Ridge]]. Before founding Walker + Associates, Inc. advertising agency, Deloss Walker was general manager of [[Jonesboro, Arkansas]] radio station [[KNEA]].&lt;ref&gt;"Deloss Walker, Ad Expert, Political Strategist, Dies" ''The Commercial Appeal'', April 20, 1996, www.commercialappeal.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community involvement==
Deloss Walker led or supported many initiatives to improve the community. In 1996, the Memphis Symphony honored Deloss and Ceil Walker with the Hebe Award for outstanding contributions and service to the arts. That year, well-known historian [[Shelby Foote]] was also honored by the Symphony with its Amphion Award.&lt;ref&gt;"Symphony Ball to Honor Foote, Walkers" ''The Commercial Appeal'', October 19, 1996, www.commercialappeal.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Walker + Associates today==
The communications agency Deloss Walker founded in 1965 continues to operate today. In fact, many of Walker + Associates' clients have stayed with the agency long-term, including McDonald's, which has been a client for more than 23 years.&lt;ref&gt;"Walker and Associates Honored for Work with McDonald's" ''Memphis Business Journal'', August 30, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency continues to win industry awards such as International MarCom Creative, Communicator, ADDY, and VOX awards, among others. On March 30, 2013, the Commercial Appeal highlighted four awards (two ADDYs and two International MarCom Creative Awards) given to Walker + Associates  for videos created for the DeSoto County (Miss.) CVB / Tourism Association.&lt;ref&gt;"Commercial Appeal", March 30, 2013, http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2013/mar/30/desoto-tourism-gets-4-awards-for-videos/&lt;/ref&gt; On March 13, 2009, the Memphis Business Journal highlighted Walker + Associates' platinum International MarCom award for a movie poster parody titled "No Country for Old Couches."&lt;ref&gt;"Walker &amp; Associates wins big with ‘No Country for Old Men’ parody," ''Memphis Business Journal'', March 13, 2009, http://memphis.bizjournals.com/memphis/stories/2009/03/16/tidbits1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gerardus Jozef Dusseldorp''' {{post-nominals|country=USA-cats|AO}} (2 December 1918{{spaced ndash}}22 April 2000) was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[engineer]] and the founder of [[Civil and Civic]], the financing arm of which later emerged as [[Lend Lease Corporation]], one of [[Australia]]'s largest companies.

==Career==
Born in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] in the [[Netherlands]] in December 1918,&lt;ref name=book&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1YBcy4lR1RwC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=Dick+Dusseldorp&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6lhKAlZHXS&amp;sig=eD5AiCs4WEwFFpQjRcy-jF7wo90&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wP5iSqPhMYWhjAfuwKzxDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8 Clark, L. Page 18]&lt;/ref&gt; Gerardus Dusseldorp was known as ''Dik'' as a child, the [[anglicise]]d version of which stuck with him for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, L. Page 19&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], as a [[Netherlands|Dutchman]] of working age, he was deported to [[Berlin]], to work as forced labour.&lt;ref name="Clark, L. Page 22"&gt;Clark, L. Page 22&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to the [[Netherlands]], he secured work with a [[Denmark|Danish]] firm building a railway from [[Copenhagen]] to [[Hamburg]].&lt;ref name="Clark, L. Page 22"/&gt; In late 1943 he was transported to [[Kraków]], again as forced labour but this time for the [[Siemens|Siemens Organisation]].&lt;ref name="Clark, L. Page 22"/&gt; In Summer 1944 he escaped and returned again to the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="Clark, L. Page 22"/&gt;

In 1945 he and his brother Hank secured jobs at ''Bredero's Bouwbedrijf'', a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] housebuilder established in the 1870s.&lt;ref name="Clark, L. Page 24"&gt;Clark, L. Page 24&lt;/ref&gt; By 1947 he had been promoted to Construction Manager.&lt;ref name="Clark, L. Page 24"/&gt; In March 1951 Bredero's sent him to [[Australia]] to seek out business opportunities: there he established [[Civil and Civic]], the success of which was based on the principle that the designer should be employed by the contractor rather than the other way round.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, L. Page 30&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s he undertook residential housing developments such as Harbour Heights Estate and was a competitor of [[Leslie Joseph Hooker]] and [[LJ Hooker|Hooker]]’s housing developments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willoughbydhs.org.au/History/Suburbs/Suburbs-MiddleCove.html Middle Cove].

He eventually retired from the business in 1988 and in retirement became a significant [[philanthropist]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/15/1097784025099.html?from=storylhs Rise and shine] Sydney Morning Herald, 16 October 2004

=== Sinking of the ''Rainbow Warrior'' ===

Prieur worked in the intelligence-gathering and evaluation wing of the French Secret Service, the Direction Générale de la Sécurité Extérieure ([[DGSE]]). She was an expert in European peace organisations and was the controller for [[Christine Cabon]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Cabon was posted to [[Auckland]] in April 1985, where she infiltrated the [[Greenpeace Aotearoa New Zealand|Greenpeace]] office and gathered information for Prieur and her fellow agent [[Alain Mafart]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/about/history/the-bombing-of-the-rainbow-war/rainbow/|title=A beret, a bottle of Beaujolais and a baguette|website=Greenpeace International|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1985, Prieur and Marfart entered New Zealand from Corsica on Swiss passports issued to their aliases Sophie and Alain Turenge, a newlywed couple on honeymoon.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Their instructions were to sink the ''Rainbow Warrior'' as the French government suspected that it would be used to protest the upcoming nuclear tests at [[Mururoa atoll]] in the South Pacific.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Prieur's responsibilities were the logistics of the operation, and the evacuation of the agents from the country after the bombing had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=4850|title=Saboteur spills the French beans|date=2000-06-30|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prieur and Marfart delivered [[limpet mine]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s to two [[Frogman|frogmen]] to plant on the ship's hull on the night of 10 July 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/defence/news/article.cfm?c_id=32&amp;objectid=3007440|title=The day Operation Satanic came to NZ|date=2002-12-03|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The explosions sank the vessel and killed photographer [[Fernando Pereira]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

They were arrested by [[New Zealand police]] within 30 hours of the bombing, and o&lt;nowiki/&gt;riginally charged with Pereira's murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/rainbow-warrior/|title=Rainbow Warrior bombing|website=my.christchurchcitylibraries.com|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prieur was transferred to [[Christchurch]] Women's Prison and held there awaiting trial.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Prieur pleaded guilty to charges of manslaughter and wilful damage in the Auckland District Court, and was sentenced to ten years imprisonment on 22 November 1985.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/profile/Susan%20Barnum/clipnumber/38947/|title=Greenpeace Bombers|last=|first=|date=22 November 1985|work=Logansport Pharos Tribume|access-date=4 May 2016|via=Newspaper Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/rainbow-warrior-30th-anniversary-of-bombing-by-french-commandos-in-auckland-new-zealand-on-july-10-1985/news-story/ef4f785ccbc7c0bdeb60a06719a8471b|title=Rainbow Warrior: 30th anniversary of bombing by French commandos in Auckland, New Zealand, on July 10, 1985|last=|first=|date=10 July 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After serious political pressure from France and her allies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10656635 |title=At the end of the Rainbow - National - NZ Herald News |publisher=Nzherald.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the New Zealand government agreed to a [[United Nations]] arbitration ruling in July 1986 that saw the pair transferred to French custody on the island of [[Hao (French Polynesia)|Hao]] in French Polynesia.

Prieur's husband, Joel Prieur, an employee of the Defense Department, was posted to Hao shortly after she was exiled there.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/profile/Susan%20Barnum/clipnumber/38949/|title=France Ends Agent's Exile|last=|first=|date=7 May 1988|work=Cedar Rapids Gazette|access-date=4 May 2016|via=Newspaper Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 May 1988 she was returned to France because she was pregnant, and was heralded as a national hero.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/profile/Susan_Barnum/clipnumber/38952/|title=Spy: French Leader Ordered Sinking|last=|first=|date=11 July 2005|work=Daily Herald Suburban Chicago|access-date=4 May 2016|via=Newspaper Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; She never returned to Hao.

Although a UN Arbitration panel found that France had breached its obligation to New Zealand several times by removing the agents from Hao, and failing to return them, it rejected the claim by New Zealand to have Mafart and Prieur returned because the term they should have spent there had already lapsed.

=== Later career ===

In 1989, Prieur was promoted to Major,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3LtFS3rl9MC&amp;lpg=PA304&amp;dq=%22Dominique%20Prieur%22&amp;pg=PA304#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Dominique%20Prieur%22&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Cold War Espionage, Spies, and Secret Operations|last=|first=|publisher=Enigma Books|year=2009|isbn=9781929631759|editor-last=Trahair|editor-first=Richard C.

Prieur published a book ''"Agent secrète"'' (''Secret Agent'') in 1995 concerning her role in the bombing. With regards to the death of Pereira, she wrote "We were terrified and appalled ... We hadn't come here to kill anyone."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 2005, Prieur and Marfart appealed to the [[Supreme Court of New Zealand|New Zealand Supreme Court]] to stop footage of their guilty pleas being shown on television.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nfh&amp;AN=20060927B012114112&amp;site=ehost-live|title=Ship Bombers Lose TV Appeal|last=|first=|date=27 September 2006|work=Gold Coast Bulletin|subscription=yes|access-date=4 May 2016|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; The supreme court allowed the footage to go on the air.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Fellowship of Companies for Christ International''' ('''FCCI''') is a membership-based 501(c)(3)non-profit. Founded in 1977 as '''Fellowship of Companies for Christ''' ('''FCC''') in Atlanta, Georgia.  In 1985, ‘International’ was added to the name to reflect the international vision.   FCCI members include Christian business owners, CEOs, managing directors, professionals and other business leaders.  Members believe Jesus Christ can be a positive change agent in their personal lives, the culture of their workplaces and the broader marketplace where they conduct business.  While FCC originated with a small circle of business and ministry leaders in the 1970s in Atlanta, Georgia, US, [http://www.linkedin.com/pub/terence-chatmon/14/5a5/203 FCCI now reports activities in over 100 nations, as of 12/2015.]

== Overview ==
"The Fellowship of Companies for Christ International aims higher than your basic business-networking organization. It's a group that supplies spiritual inspiration and guidance for born-again-Christian CEOs"—Inc. Magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Hansen |first= Susan |date= 2/1/2003 |title= Let Us Now Pray ... for Accu-Fab |url= http://www.inc.com/magazine/20030201/25119_pagen_4.html|journal= Inc.

[http://www.fcci.org/ Fellowship of Companies for Christ International] equips and encourages company leaders to operate their businesses and conduct their personal lives according to Biblical principles. For over 35 years, as a cross-denominational group, FCCI has been exploring the question: "What does it mean to run a company for Christ?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Hamiltion |first= Robert |date= 1995-05-14 |title=Q&amp;A: Drew M. Crandall; A Minister Goes to the Marketplace |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/14/nyregion/connecticut-q-a-drew-m-crandall-a-minister-goes-to-the-marketplace.html Q&amp;A: Drew M. Crandall; A Minister Goes to the Marketplace |journal= New York Times|accessdate= 2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; FCCI is now a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHHOF0D3kME global fellowship with a local vision], focused on personal, business and community transformation through a growing relationship with Christ, believing that Christ can change the world through how members do business.

'''Biblical mandate'''--FCCI embraces the discipleship of leaders and nations as described in Great Commission. '''''FCCI's Vision''''' is unique as it focuses on leaders' transformation impacting their personal lives, leadership styles, and business cultures that can lead to a transformation of their community, city and their respective nations. --[http://www.fcci.org/ "Transforming the world through Christ, one business leader at a time."]

Long before [[What Would Jesus Do?]]-WWJD wristbands appeared in the 1990s, in the 1970s FCCI's founding circles wrestled with the question: '''"What would Jesus do--if He were running my company?"''' This question was penned by [[Charles Sheldon]] in 1896 in a series of articles that became the book '''[[In His Steps]]'''

FCCI is part of a revival of interest on matters of faith, expressly discussed in workplaces, including prayer, study and discussion groups in break rooms, conference rooms and dedicated spaces allowing free expression of faith, in compliance with Title 7 requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Ellin |first= Abby |date= 2000-06-21 |title= In the Name of Peace at the Office |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/21/jobs/in-the-name-of-peace-at-the-office.html|journal= New York Times|accessdate= 2014-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural Transformation ==
[http://www.twotenmag.com/blog/calling-all-leaders-with-terence-chatmon/ FCCI sees business as a bridge to reach the world for Christ] by allowing clients, employees, leaders, competitors and stakeholders to experience the blessings that come with alignment to Biblical principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= DeButts |first= Jimmy |date=2007-01-18|title= Business and the Good Book |url= http://www.bizjournals.com/birmingham/stories/2007/01/22/smallb1.html?page=all Articles|journal= Birmingham Business Journal|accessdate= 2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A company's culture is positively impacted by an outflowing of the Abundant Life experienced by its leader. When a city, region or nation has enough leaders and businesses in alignment with Biblical principles, cultures can change through how business is done. FCCI promotes a purposeful strategy to positively impact the cultural hub cities around the world, expressed in the [http://www.fcci.org/business/influential-city-outreach/ Influential Cities Outreach.]

FCCI supports a broader movement of Fortune 500 Companies to proprietorships that allow free expression of faith within the (US Federal law)Title 7 context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Hamiltion |first= Robert |date= 1995-05-14 |title= Connecticut Q&amp;A: Drew M.

== Organizational Structure and Activities ==
Operating as a 501c3 non-profit sustainable through membership and donations, FCCI produces an [http://www.fcci.org/conference annual international conference] drawing Christian business leaders from dozens of countries. Speakers address issues common to all business owners and leaders from a Biblical perspective. Live conference sessions are  streamed from the conference around the world and video is captured, segmented and uploaded for ongoing use in '''Business Leadership Groups''' in the USA and other nations. The International Conference is a source of watershed moments for attendees, sometimes provoking transformational change in their personal or business lives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Morawski |first= Lisa |date= 1999-08-23|title= A Divine Mission |url= http://www.bizjournals.com/dayton/stories/1999/08/23/smallb1.html|journal= Dayton Business Journal|accessdate= 2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FCCI conference has also exhibited a catalytic effect, sometimes inspiring spinoffs when attendees return home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Lawley |first= Erin |date= 3/5/2006|title= Working the Word |url= http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/stories/2006/03/06/story2.html?page=all|journal= Nashville Business Journal|accessdate= 2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FCCI Business Leadership Groups''' [BLGs] convene weekly or monthly for fellowship, encouragement, prayer, counsel and Godly wisdom. Business issues are discussed in the groups from a biblical perspective which considers the impact on both relationships and resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= O'Neal Parker |first=  Lonnae |date= 1/11/2002|title= Prayer and Profits |url= http://wwrn.org/articles/4194/?&amp;section=other|journal= Washington Post | accessdate= 2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concepts of Biblical stewardship are promoted to FCCI's membership and modeled by the organization, a founding member of the Evangelical Counsel for Financial Accountability [http://www.ecfa.org/ ECFA] FCCI promotes the Biblical concepts that '''''our purpose in work''''': 1. is of utmost importance to God and 2. is key to eternal reward (Col 3:17, 23-24). '''''Business as Missions''''' and '''''Business as Ministry''''' is most effective when Eternal Purpose is clearly understood, Eternal Values are clearly communicated, taught and most importantly, modeled by business leaders. The preeminence of eternal purpose is central to all of FCCI's activities. This idea is reinforced by the name given to FCCI's process for developing leaders-'''Pathway to Purpose.'''
FCCI provivdes ongoing prayer support for CEOs, business leaders, their employees and others through a through a web-facilitated network of volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Hansen |first= Susan |date= 2/1/2003 |title= Let Us Now Pray ... for Accu-Fab |url= http://www.inc.com/magazine/20030201/25119_pagen_4.html|journal= Inc. Magazine|accessdate= 2014-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Staff ==
FCCI's global fellowship is served by a [http://www.fcci.org/about/our-staff small team of employees], supporting a cadre of distinguished volunteers leading Business Leadership Groups and Area Teams, all overseen by an [http://www.fcci.org/about/board-of-directors International Board].

== Pathway to Purpose[tm](P2P) ==
[http://www.fcci.org/business/pathway-to-purpose P2P] is a template for all of FCCI's conferences, seminars, groups and materials. "P2P" promotes four developmental objectives: Spiritual Maturity, Servant Leadership, Business Excellence and Kingdom Impact. The concept of a "Kingdom Company" is promoted as one where Biblical purpose and values, servant leadership and excellence lead to business transformation. Jesus Christ is the model; His teaching is the framework—all energized by the work of the Holy Spirit. Kingdom Companies are great places for anyone to work and often present non-Christians with their first exposure to Kingdom principles at work. Proselyting is not the objective. Conducting oneself in a manner that provokes questions on matters of faith '''''is''''' a goal (1Pet 3:15.)  [https://www.fcci.org/library/?s=&amp;post_type=library FCCI resources] are developed with all of these P2P objectives in mind.

== Notable Participants ==
In the 1970s, FCCI's founding circle included: [[Larry Burkett]], Bert Stumberg,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Stumberg Family |date=2013-02-20 |title= Family Placed Obituary |url= http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/atlanta/obituary.aspx?page=lifestory&amp;pid=163183042 |journal= Legacy.com and The Atlanta Journal &amp; Constitution |accessdate= 2014-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bobby Mitchell, Bill Leonard, Jim Moye, Smith Lanier, Ben Lively, Thomas Harris and Jimmy Pursell.

'''Huguette Marcelle Clark''' {{IPAc-en|uː|g|ɛ|t|_|k|l|ɑː|r|k}}&lt;ref name=charges/&gt; (June 9, 1906 – May 24, 2011) was an American [[heir]]ess and [[philanthropist]], who became well known again late in life as a recluse, living in a hospital for more than 20 years while her various mansions remained unoccupied.

The youngest daughter of [[Montana]] senator and industrialist [[William A. Clark]], she spent her early life in [[Paris]] before relocating with her family to [[New York City]], where she was educated at the [[Spence School]]. After a short-lived marriage ended in 1930, Clark returned to her residence at [[907 Fifth Avenue]], a large twelfth-floor apartment that she significantly expanded to occupying two floors. She also meticulously maintained [[Bellosguardo Foundation|Bellosguardo]], a large familial estate in [[Santa Barbara, California]], though she never returned to the property after the 1950s.

Clark spent much of her life outside of the public sphere, devoting her time to painting, the arts, and collecting various antiquities, primarily toys and [[doll]]s. In 1952, she purchased another property in [[New Canaan, Connecticut]], but following the death of her mother in 1963, became increasingly reclusive. In 1991, she was admitted to [[Doctors Hospital (Manhattan)|Doctors Hospital]] in Manhattan to treat various [[basal cell carcinoma|basal cell]] cancer lesions on her face. Though she successfully recovered, Clark remained a hospital resident for the following two decades.

Upon her death at 104 in 2011, Clark left behind a fortune of more than $300 million, most of which was donated to charity after a court dispute with her distant relatives. The events surrounding her estate and private affairs during the last several years of her life were covered extensively by journalist [[Bill Dedman]], who subsequently co-wrote a [[Empty Mansions|book about her life]].

Huguette Marcelle Clark was born on June 9, 1906, in [[Paris]], [[French Third Republic|France]].{{sfn|Dedman|Newell|2014|p=6}} She was the second daughter of [[William A. Clark]] (1839{{em dash}}1925), from his second wife, Anna Eugenia Clark (née La Chapelle; 1878{{em dash}}1963).{{sfn|Dedman|Newell|2014|p=170}} Her father was a former U.S. Senator from [[Montana]] and businessman involved in mining and railroads, who had largely amassed a fortune in [[copper]] mining operations in [[Butte, Montana]] and [[Jerome, Arizona]].{{sfn|Dedman|Newell|2014|pages=50–51, 73, 85}} He was also a railroad magnate and one of the founders of [[Las Vegas]].&lt;ref name=charges/&gt; Her mother, the daughter of [[French Canadians|French-Canadian]] immigrants, was born and raised in [[Michigan]], and was an aspiring singer and musician who met William while she was living in a [[boarding house]] in Butte.{{sfn|Dedman|Newell|2014|p=46}} Clark was raised [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], the faith of her mother,&lt;ref name=excluded&gt;{{cite web|work=[[NBC News]]|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/43166747/ns/business-local_business/t/family-excluded-huguette-clark-burial/|title=Family excluded from Huguette Clark burial|date=May 26, 2011|accessdate=September 25, 2018|author=Dedman, Bill|author-link=Bill Dedman}}&lt;/ref&gt; while her father was a [[Protestantism|Protestant]].{{sfn|Dedman|Newell|2014|p=73}}

In addition to her older sister, Louise Amelia Andrée Clark (1902–1919), she had five half-siblings from her father's first marriage to Katherine Louise Stauffer:&lt;ref name=Trib&gt;{{cite news |author=Geary, David L.|title= Daughter of Connellsville's controversial billionaire dies |url= http://triblive.com/x/dailycourier/news/s_739448.html |newspaper= The Tribune-Review |location=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|date= May 28, 2011 |access-date= January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Joaquina Clark (1870&amp;ndash;1939), [[Charles W.

Clark spent her early life in France, living with her family at their apartment on [[Avenue Victor-Hugo (Paris)|Avenue Victor-Hugo]] in the [[16th arrondissement of Paris|16th arrondissement]].{{sfn|Dedman|Newell|2014|p=6}} When she was five years old, she subsequently relocated to [[New York City]], where she was educated at the [[Spence School]] in [[Manhattan]].{{sfn|Dedman|Newell|2014|pages=104–108}} The family resided in a six-story, 121-room mansion located at [[William A.

===1927—1987: Real estate and artistic endeavors===
[[File:Bellosguardo 1.jpg|thumb|upright=1|left|[[Bellosguardo Foundation|Bellosguardo]] estate in [[Santa Barbara, California]]]]
In December 1927, Clark announced her engagement to law student William MacDonald Gower, a [[Princeton University]] graduate who was a son of one of her father's business associates, William Bleakly Gower.{{sfn|Dedman|Newell|2014|p=135}} The two married on August 18, 1928 at [[Bellosguardo Foundation|Bellosguardo]], her family's {{convert|23|acre|m2 ha|adj=on}} estate on the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]] in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[California]].{{sfn|Dedman|Newell|2014|p=138}} The same year, Clark agreed to donate $50,000 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|50000|1928|r=-3}}}} in today's dollars){{Inflation-fn|US}} to excavate a salt pond and create an artificial freshwater lake across from Bellosguardo. She stipulated that the facility would be named the [[Andree Clark Bird Refuge|Andrée Clark Bird Refuge]], after her sister, who had died of [[meningitis]]. Clark and Gower separated in 1929, one year after their marriage, and divorced in [[Reno, Nevada]], on August 12, 1930.&lt;ref name=generosity/&gt;

After her divorce, Clark returned to the twelfth-floor apartment at 907 Fifth Avenue, where she had previously lived with her mother.{{sfn|Dedman|Newell|2014|pages=173, 240}} Upon moving back in, Clark modified and expanded the apartment significantly, so that it took up the entire twelfth floor of the building, as well as half of the eighth.&lt;ref name=martin&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Atlantic]]|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/06/inside-houses-huguette-clark/351324/|title=Inside Huguette Clark's Massive Homes|author=Martin, Adam|date=June 1, 2011|accessdate=September 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The residence grew to a total of 42 rooms, including a {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} library, {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} drawing room, and {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} living room.&lt;ref name=martin/&gt; According to architectural historian Andrew Alpern: "If you stood with your back to the fireplace in the library, you could see out to [[Central Park]] through the living room window that is almost {{convert|110|ft|m}} away!"&lt;ref name=martin/&gt; Clark and her mother continued to maintain Bellosguardo, and during the [[Great Depression]] had the original home torn down and rebuilt "just to give people jobs."&lt;ref name=martin/&gt; Clark visited Bellosguardo regularly during this period, staying there with family and friends.&lt;ref name=martin/&gt; There, she befriended Barbara Dorn, the daughter of one of the property's caretakers. An acquaintance recalled that Clark "hung out with rich daredevils who drove fast cars and flew rickety planes," but became close friends with Dorn, as both were shy and "hid in the garden."&lt;ref name=martin/&gt;

Clark was also a musician and painter, and in 1929 exhibited seven of her own paintings at the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]], located in [[Washington, D.C.]] She possessed an enthusiasm for the arts and was an avid collector of visual art,&lt;ref name=sbi&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Santa Barbara Independent]]|location=Santa Barbara, California|url=http://www.independent.com/news/2011/jun/22/holland-knight-files-last-will-testament-executors/|title=Last Will &amp; Testament of "Reluctant Heiress" Huguette Clark|author=Holland &amp; Knight|accessdate=September 26, 2018|date=June 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as antique toys and [[dolls]].{{sfn|Dedman|Newell|2014|pages=180, 244, 255}} She reportedly had a very small group of friends&lt;ref name="NBCNews.com3"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/38733524/ns/business-local_business/t/who-watching-heiress-huguette-clarks-millions/|title=Who Is Watching Huguette Clark's Millions?|accessdate=September 25, 2018|archiveurl=http://archive.is/gGmQJ|archivedate=September 26, 2018|author=Dedman, Bill|date= September 8, 2010 |work=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was "skittish around strangers,"&lt;ref name=charges/&gt; spending much of her time in private, rarely leaving her residence.&lt;ref name=martin/&gt; She occasionally attended [[Christian Dior]] fashion shows in New York City, but only to find inspiration for clothing to dress her dolls.{{sfn|Dedman|Newell|2014|p=177}}&lt;ref name=dujour&gt;{{cite web|work=[[DuJour Media]]|title=The Peculiar Life of Huguette Clark|author=Burleigh, Nina|url=http://staging.dujour.com/culture/huguette-clark-peculiar-life-trial/|accessdate=September 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, she purchased a {{convert|52|acre|m2 ha|adj=on}} estate in [[New Canaan, Connecticut]], referred to as ''Le Beau Chateau''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2012/05/04/apartments-owned-by-late-heiress-find-buyers|work=The Wall Street Journal|title=Apartments Owned by Late Heiress Find Buyers|date=May 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of her mother in 1963, she became even more reclusive.&lt;ref name=martin/&gt; Her mother's death left Clark the sole owner of Bellosguardo, which she had not visited since the 1950s.&lt;ref name=martin/&gt; Despite her lack of visitation, Bellosguardo continued to be maintained throughout Clark's life for a total cost of $40,000 per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=NBC News|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/huguette-clark/inside-heiress-huguette-clarks-california-mansion-frozen-time-60-years-n105251|title=Inside Heiress Huguette Clark's California Mansion, Frozen in Time for 60 Years|date=May 14, 2014|accessdate=September 26, 2018|archiveurl=http://archive.is/rtCfT|archivedate=September 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1988—2009: Hospitalization and later life===
As she aged, Clark began to develop a distrust of outsiders, including her family, because she worried they were after her money. She preferred to conduct all of her conversations in [[French language|French]] so that others were unlikely to understand the discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/38719231/ns/business-local_business/t/mysterious-heiress-huguette-clark-alone-now/|title=At 104, the Mysterious Heiress Huguette Clark Is Now Alone|accessdate=September 25, 2018|author=Dedman, Bill|date= September 8, 2010|work=NBC News|archiveurl=http://archive.fo/AccZy|archivedate=September 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1991, Clark had grown frail and had numerous [[Tumor|cancerous lesions]] that disfigured her face, making it difficult for her to see or eat.{{sfn|Dedman|Newell|2014|p=232}} On March 26 that year, she was admitted to the Upper East Side's [[Doctors Hospital (Manhattan)|Doctors Hospital]] for treatment.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; Physicians there noted that she was so thin she appeared like "an apparition ...&amp;nbsp; like somebody out of a concentration camp."&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; Clark successfully underwent surgery to remove [[basal cell carcinoma|basal cell]] tumors from her face, as well as reconstructive surgery to her lips, right cheek, and right eyelid.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; A nurse initially noted in Clark's chart that she behaved "like a homeless person – no clothes, not in touch with the world, had not seen a doctor for 20 years, and threw everyone out of the room."&lt;ref name=guard/&gt;

Following her treatment, Clark remained a resident of the hospital for the rest of her life.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; Though initially a resident of Doctors Hospital, she later transferred to [[Beth Israel Medical Center]] following the merger of the two hospitals.&lt;ref name="NBCNews.com4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/39030815/ns/business-local_business/t/attorney--year-old-heiress-defends-his-handling-her-finances/|title=Attorney for 104-year-old heiress defends his handling of her finances |accessdate=September 26, 2018|author=Dedman, Bill|archiveurl=http://archive.fo/hZZsG|archivedate=September 26, 2018|date=September 8, 2010|work=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her doctor, Henry Singman, "had strongly urged that she go home," but Clark was "perfectly happy, content, to remain in the situation she was in."&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; She had regular visitation from private nurses and medical staff throughout the day and was provided meals in the hospital, where her 11th-floor room overlooked Central Park.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; Clark paid a daily sum of $829 to stay in the hospital.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; There, hospital officials recalled her eccentric interests, noting that she would often change conversational topics to [[cartoon]]s such as ''[[The Smurfs]]'' and ''[[The Flintstones]]''.{{sfn|Dedman|Newell|2014|p=280}}

Throughout her nearly two-decades stay, Clark became very close with her private nurse, Hadassah Peri.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; Over the years, Clark gifted Peri and her family over $30 million dollars in various properties, vehicles, medical expenses, cash gifts, and college tuitions.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; A neurologist visited Clark in 2006, and noted that she was "alert and cheerful, neurologically normal in every way ...&amp;nbsp; She seemed cute as pie, perfectly content."&lt;ref name=charges&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/huguette-clark/no-charges-heiress-huguette-clarks-300-million-fortune-n86951|work=NBC News|title=No Charges in Heiress Huguette Clark's $300 Million Fortune|date=April 24, 2014|accessdate=September 26, 2018|author=Dedman, Bill|archiveurl=http://archive.is/vTXUW|archivedate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Clark had a net worth of over $300 million, she was cash poor in her later life, selling properties in order to give large gifts to both friends and strangers{{em dash}}$10 million to her best friend, and $25,000 to hospital workers who once fixed the television in her room.&lt;ref name=charges/&gt;

===2010—2011: Finals years and media attention===
In February 2010, Clark became the subject of a series of reports by [[Bill Dedman]], an investigative reporter for [[NBCNews.com|NBC News]]. Dedman found that caretakers at her three residences had not seen her in decades, and that her palatial estates in Santa Barbara and [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Connecticut]], had lain empty throughout that time, although the houses and their extensive grounds were meticulously maintained by their staff.&lt;ref name="dedman-essay"/&gt; He determined in 2010 that she was in the care of a New York City hospital, and that some of her personal possessions had been quietly sold. Some of the possessions sold include a rare 1709 violin called ''[[La Pucelle (violin)|La Pucelle]]'' (or ''The Virgin'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cozio.com/Instrument.aspx?id=212|title=La Pucelle, Virgin, Maiden No. 212|accessdate=April 14, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102125303/http://cozio.com/Instrument.aspx?id=212|archivedate=November 2, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; made by [[Antonio Stradivari]], and an 1882 [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] painting entitled ''In the Roses''.&lt;ref name="NBCNews.com3"/&gt;

In August 2010, the office of the [[New York County District Attorney]] initiated a probe into her affairs managed by her accountant, Irving Kamsler, and her attorney, Wallace Bock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/38794432/ns/business-local_business/t/report-sparks-welfare-check-heiress-huguette-clark/|title=Report sparks welfare check on reclusive heiress|work=NBC News|author=Dedman, Bill|archiveurl=http://archive.is/XYBJ|archivedate=September 4, 2012|deadurl=yes|date=September 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then a former [[paralegal]] for Bock's law firm, Cynthia Garcia, said that Bock received many lavish gifts from Clark, including a $1.5 million gift after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, to build a [[bomb shelter]] in an [[Israeli settlement]] in the [[West Bank]] near the homes of his daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/fortune_ate_att_it48Wqycw4kkG7qXKyW1CO|title=104-Year-Old Heiress Gave Lawyer 'Millions' in Gifts|accessdate=January 12, 2012|author=Mangan, Dan|date=August 28, 2010|work=[[New York Post]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102084506/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/fortune_ate_att_it48Wqycw4kkG7qXKyW1CO|archivedate=January 2, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Garcia, Bock tried many times to get Clark to sign a will, including versions that included him as a beneficiary.

==Death==
Clark died on May 24, 2011 at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City, two weeks short of her 105th birthday.{{sfn|Dedman|Newell|2014|p=322}} She had been moved a month earlier to an [[intensive-care unit]] and later to a room with [[hospice]] care; at the time of her death, Peri was by her side.{{sfn|Dedman|Newell|2014|p=322}} Though Clark had long said she did not want a funeral or priests, a Catholic priest was summoned to give her [[Catholic particular churches and liturgical rites|last rites]].{{sfn|Dedman|Newell|2014|p=306}}

During this time, Clark had been living at Beth Israel under pseudonyms; the latest was Harriet Chase.{{sfn|Dedman|Newell|2014|p=316}} Her room was guarded and she was cared for by part-time private nurses. Her room on the third floor had a card with the fake room number "1B" with the name "Chase" taped over the actual room number. A criminal investigation into the handling of her money was ongoing at the time of her death.&lt;ref name="NBCNews.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/39006900/ns/business-huguette_clark_mystery|title=Huguette Clark, the Reclusive Copper Heiress, Dies at 104|accessdate=January 8, 2012|author=Dedman, Bill|date=May 24, 2011|work=NBC News|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101190829/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/39006900/ns/business-huguette_clark_mystery|archivedate=January 1, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/finance-obituaries/8536420/Huguette-Clark.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|title=Huguette Clark| date=May 25, 2011 | accessdate = January 12, 2012 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was entombed on the morning of May 26, 2011, in the family mausoleum in section 85 of [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx)|Woodlawn Cemetery]], located in [[The Bronx]], New York City, before the cemetery gates were open to the public. Her attorney said she had specific instructions that no funeral service or [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] be held.  In 2008, Clark's representatives had obtained consent from other Clark family members to alter the mausoleum originally commissioned by her father.  It was not until early 2011 that the mausoleum was altered to accommodate her entombment.&lt;ref name=excluded/&gt;

==Posthumous events==
===Estate settlement===
Clark's last will and testament was filed on June 22, 2011, in [[New York Surrogate's Court]]. This will was made in 2005 and left seventy-five percent of her estate, about $300 million, to charity. The will provided that her longtime nurse, Hadassah Peri, would receive about $30 million; her goddaughter, Wanda Styka, would receive about $12 million; and the newly created [[Bellosguardo Foundation]] would get $8 million.&lt;ref name=gold&gt;{{cite web|author=Gold, Scott|date=November 3, 2013|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-santa-barbara-mansion-20131103,0,4879659,full.story|title=A tangled estate of affairs for Santa Barbara's majestic Bellosguardo|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate= November 5, 2013}} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other employees who managed her residences and affairs would receive smaller sums totaling $2 million, while Beth Israel Hospital, where she resided for many years and where she died, received $1 million.&lt;ref name=sbi/&gt; Her attorney and accountant would receive $500,000 each.

In October 2011, NBC News reported that an earlier will was signed six weeks before the second will; this earlier will left Clark's estate entirely to her family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://billingsgazette.com/a-million-twist-huguette-clark-signed-two-wills-one-to/article_b855955b-c076-583c-8923-7335499e51ef.html|work=[[Billings Gazette]]|title=A $400 million twist: Huguette Clark signed two wills, one to her family|author=Dedman, Bill|publisher=NBC News|location=Billings, Montana|date=November 28, 2011|accessdate=September 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=deal/&gt; A total of nineteen distant relatives of Clark{{em dash}}the last of whom saw her in 1957, and many of whom never met her{{em dash}}subsequently challenged the second will, citing her "obsession with high end, lifelike French and Japanese dolls, model castles, the [[Smurfs]], her reclusiveness and tendency to give her money freely as evidence of mental illness."&lt;ref name=inside&gt;{{cite web|work=New York Post|title=A look inside heiress Huguette Clark's weird world of dolls, model castles and the Smurfs|author=Boniello, Kathianne|date=August 11, 2013|accessdate=September 26, 2018|url=https://nypost.com/2013/08/11/a-look-inside-heiress-huguette-clarks-weird-world-of-dolls-model-castles-and-the-smurfs/|archiveurl=http://archive.fo/Liw0V|archivedate=September 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also accused Peri, as well as her attorney and accountant, of defrauding her.&lt;ref name=deal&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/huguette-clarks-300-million-copper-fortune-divided-heres-deal-flna4B11244681|work=NBC News|title=Huguette Clark's $300 million copper fortune is divided up: Here's the deal|author=Dedman, Bill|date=November 2, 2015|accessdate=September 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While no one was charged with a crime, the accusations resulted in an investigation by the district attorney's office, who mandated that the will be settled before a [[jury trial]].&lt;ref name=deal/&gt;

===Reported theft of artwork===
[[File:Danseuse Faisant des Pointes.jpg|thumb|[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Danseuse_Faisant_des_Pointes.jpg]|''Danseuse Faisant des Pointes'' (1879–1880), a pastel drawing by [[Edgar Degas]], was stolen from Clark's Fifth Avenue apartment]]
In March 2012, it was reported that shortly after Clark moved to a hospital in the early 1990s, a valuable pastel, ''Danseuse Faisant des Pointes'' (''Dancer Making [[en pointe|Pointes]]''), by [[Edgar Degas]], was stolen from her Fifth Avenue apartment. The painting was sold to Peter Findlay Gallery and later acquired in 1993 by [[H&amp;R Block]] co-founder and art collector [[Henry W. Bloch]]. The Peter Findlay Gallery indicated that it acquired the piece from a "European gentleman, seemingly from a good family, who visited New York from time to time" and who claimed to have inherited the work. It was not until 2005 that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] made Bloch aware that it was investigating the painting, and in 2007, they told Bloch that the painting had in fact been reported stolen from Clark.&lt;ref name="Degas painting"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://openchannel.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/03/15/10693680-the-10-million-degas-ballerina-heiress-huguette-clark-and-the-tax-man|title=The $10 million Degas ballerina, heiress Huguette Clark and the tax man|accessdate=March 17, 2012|author=Dedman, Bill|date=March 14, 2012|work=NBC News|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316210146/http://openchannel.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/03/15/10693680-the-10-million-degas-ballerina-heiress-huguette-clark-and-the-tax-man|archivedate=March 16, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under an October 2008 deed of gift, Clark agreed to donate the pastel, valued at $10 million, to the [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], of which Bloch was a major benefactor.&lt;ref name="Degas painting"/&gt; After making the gift, Clark made a request that the pastel be lent three times in 25 years to the [[Corcoran Museum of Art]], that it be listed as from an anonymous donor, and that Clark personally receive a full-sized color photograph of the work.&lt;ref name="Degas painting"/&gt; The museum kept the matter confidential, acknowledging ownership in a 2012 written exchange with NBC News.&lt;ref name="Degas painting"/&gt;

===Sale of residences and personal items===
After her death, seventeen items from her personal jewel collection were auctioned off at [[Christie's]] on April 17, 2012. Buyers paid a total of over $20 million for the items, including a rare 9 carat pink diamond by Dreicer &amp; Company that was purchased for over $15.7 million, which included a buyer's premium of 12 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/features/auctions/0412/magnificent-jewels/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://archive.fo/ML0BL|archivedate=June 22, 2014|title=Magnificent Jewels|work= [[Christie's]]|date=April 17, 2012|accessdate= June 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of Clark's collection of art and antiquities were consigned to go on the auction block at Christie's in June 2014, over three years after her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=National Public Radio|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/06/17/312204184/-eccentric-capable-lucid-heiress-belongings-head-to-auction|title=Eccentric Heiress's Untouched Treasures Head For The Auction Block|author=Adler, Margot|date=June 17, 2014|accessdate=September 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012, one of Clark's three [[907 Fifth Avenue]] apartments, the penthouse #12W, sold for a pre-emptive $25.5 million, $1.5 million above the listing price, to [[Boaz Weinstein]], the hedge fund manager and founder of Saba Capital Management, which was the biggest sale of the week according to city records.&lt;ref name=NYT1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Finn|first1=Robin|title=Big Ticket – Sold for $25.5 Million|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/20/big-ticket-sold-for-25-5-million/|accessdate=January 28, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=July 20, 2012}} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Prime Minister of Qatar]] attempted to purchase both of Clark's apartments on the eighth floor, which comprised the entire eighth floor, and combine the two into one huge apartment. However, the building's board did not allow it. In November 2012, apartment #8W was sold for $22.5 million to financier [[Frederick Iseman]]. The unit was listed for $19 million, but the sale includes a piece of unit #8E,&lt;ref name=Curbed1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dailey|first1=Jessica|title=$22.5M Sale of Huguette Clark's Partial Combo Approved|url=http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2012/11/26/225m_sale_of_huguette_clarks_partial_combo_approved.php|accessdate=January 28, 2016|work=Curbed|date=November 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later sold in October 2013 for $6.8 million to David Luski, president and chief executive officer at DRA Advisors LLC, after originally being listed for $12 million.&lt;ref name=Curbed2&gt;{{cite news|last1=Budin|first1=Jeremiah|title=Last Sliver of Huguette Clark Estate Sells for $6.8 Million|url=http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2013/10/17/last_sliver_of_huguette_clark_estate_sells_for_68_million.php|accessdate=January 28, 2016|work=Curbed|date=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, the three apartments sold for a combined $54.8 million.

In April 2014, after sitting empty for more than 60 years, Clark's French-style chateau known as "Le Beau Chateau", which sits on 52 wooded acres in [[New Canaan, Connecticut]], was sold to the fashion designer [[Reed Krakoff]] and his wife. They purchased the home for the reduced price of $14.3 million.&lt;ref name=NBCNews&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dedman|first1=Bill|title=Heiress Huguette Clark's 'Extra' Mansion Sells for $14 Million|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/huguette-clark/heiress-huguette-clarks-extra-mansion-sells-14-million-n79536|accessdate=January 28, 2016|work=NBC News|date=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''information industry''' or '''information industries''' are [[industry|industries]] that are [[information]] intensive in one way or the other. It is considered one of the most important [[economic sector]]s for a variety of reasons. 

There are many different kinds of information industries, and many different ways to classify them. Although there is no standard or distinctively better way of organizing those different views, the following section offers a review of what the term "information industry" might entail, and why. Alternative conceptualizations are that of [[knowledge]] industry and information-related occupation. The term "information industry" is mostly identified with [[computer programming]], system design, telecommunications, and others.  

==Information products==

First, there are companies which produce and sell information in the form of goods or services. [[Mass media|Media]] products such as [[television]] programs and [[movies]], published books and periodicals would constitute probably among the most accepted part of what information goods can be. Some information is provided not as a tangible commodity but as a service. Consulting is among the least controversial of this kind. However, even for this category, disagreements can occur due to the vagueness of the term "information." For some, information is knowledge about a subject, something one can use to improve the performance of other activities—it does not include arts and entertainments. For others, information is something that is mentally processed and consumed, either to improve other activities (such as production) or for personal enjoyment; it would include artists and architects. For yet others, information may include anything that has to do with sensation, and therefore information industries may include even such things as restaurant, amusement parks, and prostitution to the extent that food, park ride, and sexual intercourse have to do with senses. In spite of the definitional problems, industries producing information goods and services are called information industries.

==Information services==

Second, there are [[information processing]] services. Some services, such as [[legal]] services, [[banking]], [[insurance]], [[computer programming]], [[data processing]], testing, and market research, require intensive and intellectual processing of information. Although those services do not necessarily provide information, they often offer expertise in making decisions on behalf of clients. These kinds of service industries can be regarded as an information-intensive part of various industries that is externalized and specialized. 

==Information distribution==

Third, there are industries that are vital to the dissemination of the information goods mentioned above. For example, [[telephone]], [[broadcasting]] and book retail industries do not produce much information, but their core business is to disseminate information others produced. These industries handle predominantly information and can be distinguished from wholesale or retail industries in general. It is just a coincidence, one can argue, that some of those industries are separately existing from the more obvious information-producing industries. For example, in the United States, as well as some other countries, broadcasting stations produce very limited amount of programs they broadcast. But this is not the only possible form of division of labor. If legal, economic, [[cultural]], and [[historical]] circumstances were different, the broadcasters would have been the producers of their own programs. Therefore, in order to capture the information related activities of the economy, it might be a good idea to include this type of industry. These industries show how much of an economy is about information, as opposed to materials. It is useful to differentiate production of valuable information from processing that information in a sophisticated way, from the movement of information. 

==Information devices==

Fourth, there are manufacturers of information-processing devices that require research and sophisticated decision-making. These products are vital to information-processing activities of above mentioned industries. The products include computers of various levels and many other microelectronic devices, as well as software programs. Printing and copying machines, measurement and recording devices of various kinds, electronic or otherwise, are also in this category. The role of these tools are to automate certain information-processing activities. The use of some of these tools may be very simple (as in the case of some printing), and the processing done by the tools may be very simple (as in copying and some calculations) rather than intellectual and sophisticated. In other words, the specialization of these industries in an economy is neither production of information nor sophisticated decision-making. Instead, this segment serves as an infrastructure for those activities, making production of information and decision-making services will be a lot less efficient. In addition, these industries tend to be "[[high-tech]]" or research intensive - trying to find more efficient ways to boost efficiency of information production and sophisticated decision-making. For example, the function of a standard calculator is quite simple and it is easy to how to use it. However, manufacturing a well-functioning standard calculator takes a lot of processes, far more than the task of calculation performed by the users. 

==Research industries==

Fifth, there are very [[research|research-intensive]] industries that do not serve as infrastructure to information-production or sophisticated decision-making. Pharmaceutical, food-processing, some apparel design, and some other "high-tech" industries belong to this type. These products are not exclusively for information production or sophisticated decision-making, although many are helpful. Some services, such as medical examination are in this category as well. One can say these industries involve a great deal of sophisticated decision-making, although that part is combined with manufacturing or "non-informational" activities. 

==Infrastructure==

Finally, there are industries that are not research intensive, but serve as [[infrastructure]] for information production and sophisticated decision-making. Manufacturing of office furniture would be a good example, although it sometimes involves research in ergonomics and development of new materials. 

As stated above, this list of candidates for information industries is not a definitive way of organizing differences that researchers may pay attention to when they define the term. Among the difficulties is, for example, the position of advertising industry.

==Importance==

Information industries are considered important for several reasons. Even among the experts who think industries are important, disagreements may exist regarding which reason to accept and which to reject.

First, information industries is a rapidly growing part of economy. The demand for information goods and services from consumers is increasing. In case of consumers, media including music and motion picture, personal computers, video game-related industries, are among the information industries. In case of businesses, information industries include computer programming, system design, so-called FIRE (finance, insurance, and real estate) industries, telecommunications, and others. When demand for these industries are growing nationally or internationally, that creates an opportunity for an urban, regional, or national economy to grow rapidly by specializing on these sectors. 

Second, information industries are considered to boost innovation and productivity of other industries. An economy with a strong information industry might be a more competitive one than others, other factors being equal. 

Third, some believe that the effect of the changing economic structure (or composition of industries within an economy) is related to the broader social change. As information becomes the central part of our economic activities we evolve into an "[[information society]]", with an increased role of mass media, digital technologies, and other mediated information in our daily life, leisure activities, social life, work, politics, education, art, and many other aspects of society.

==Criticism==
In July 2009, using information obtained from a Freedom of Information request to the Welsh government, the [[Welsh Liberal Democrats]] criticised International Business Wales officials for running up a bill of £750,000, on 35 different corporate credit card accounts for the year June 2008 to end of May 2009, at the tax-payers expense. Liberal Democrat leader [[Kirsty Williams]] AM said: 
:"In the middle of a recession it's disgusting to know that public officials are flying first class, staying in the most expensive hotels, eating in the best restaurants - all at the swipe of the Welsh credit card."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/wales_politics/8148458.stm BBC Wales News: "Civil servants' £750k cards bill" 13.07.09]&lt;/ref&gt;

First Minister [[Rhodri Morgan]] at first refuted the allegation. He later publicly apologised in a letter to Kirsty Williams and said that he had been misled by IBW officials, whom he had believed at the time: 
:"I stated, on the clear and explicit advice from the relevant senior officials that no officials from IBW (International Business Wales) had flown first class. Today I have learned that this is not the case. I apologise for having misled you and the wider public."&lt;ref name=letter&gt;BBC Wales: [http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/betsanpowys/2009/07/im_sorry.html Letter from First Minister Rhodri Morgan to Kirsty Williams AM], 15 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

He added that he was setting up an investigation and independent review:
:"I need hardly say how disturbed I am by this latest information now to hand. I am instructing the Permanent Secretary to undertake an immediate and thorough investigation and audit of IBW's expenditure and audit systems. This review will be led from outside the Assembly Government."&lt;ref name=letter /&gt;

==Support==
Following the July 2009 press coverage a group of Welsh exporters have shown their support for International Business Wales, calling on politicians to "stop playing politics" with the organisation.
Malcolm Duncan, Managing Director of Blaenavon-based Super Rod, who heads up the support group said: 
:"I understand the need for the public to be kept informed about the activities of any Government department. But what does worry me is when politicians start to play politics with these departments, that could ultimately have a detrimental effect on both business and our economy as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/business-in-wales/business-news/2009/08/15/exporters-reject-attack-on-ibw-91466-24446015/  Wales Online: "Exporters reject attack on IBW" 15.08.09]&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Economic Renewal: a new direction"==
On Monday 5 July 2010 the [[Welsh Assembly Government]] announced plans to transform the way it supports businesses and the Welsh economy. "Economic Renewal: a new direction" is a vision to make Wales "one of the best places in the world to live, to work and to thrive". 

As part of the transformation, functions previously supported by International Business Wales, Trade and Inward investment, can be accessed directly through the Welsh Government; or by [http://www.ibwales.com visiting the Trade and Inward investment website] or calling (+44) 1443 845500.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2727">The '''International Colour Authority''' ('''ICA''') is a private organization publishing [[forecasting|forecasts]] about [[colour]] [[Fads and trends|trends]] for the coming seasons, to be used by [[industrial design|industry designers]]. It also awards a ''Seal of Approval'' that companies may display in their promotional materials if the colour ranges they use are appraised by the ICA.

ICA forecasts were launched in 1968. Since then, a panel of international colour specialists, the Spanish Painter [[Pepa Poch]] among them,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.barcelonaesmoda.com/en/entrevista/%E2%80%9Ccolour-is-a-feeling%E2%80%9D/|title=Interview to Pepa Poch, Painter: "Colour is a feeling"|last=|first=|date=|website=Barcelona és moda|publisher=Cambra de Comerç de Barcelona|access-date=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; gathers twice a year in [[London]] to select the next colour [[Palette (painting)|palette]]. The selection is published 22 months ahead of the retail selling season, thus constituting the earliest colour trend prediction available to the [[furniture]] design and [[textile industry|textile]] industries. Nowadays the ICA is one of the leading colour forecasters for the industry, along with the [[Color Marketing Group]]. Their products are ''"high-quality forecast publications containing an abundance of accurate information on market trends"'', which ranks them among ''"the favourite publications of many professionals"'', according to an article published by the [[International Trade Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.tradeforum.org/news/fullstory.php/aid/418/Don%92t_Be_Off-colour.html Don't Be Off-colour]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}". ''International Trade Forum'', '''1''' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Colours in the ICA colour guides are referenced using the [[Pantone]] standard, the [[Natural Color System]] (NCS) standard, or both.

ICA has now launched an online service through which subscribers can download the forecasts, and is creating an online newsletter, World Colour News.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2897">The '''International Wheelset Congress''' ('''IWC''') was founded by [[Lucchini RS|Lucchini]] in 1963. The first congress took place in [[Bergamo]], [[Italy]], in that year. Since then, with only two exceptions it has been held every third year. The International Wheelset Congress is the oldest railway technical conference in the world. 

One of the premier international rail conferences, The International Wheelset Congress, attracts engineers from the international rail community. The congress provides a platform for rail operators, equipment builders, component suppliers, academia and government, regulatory and standards organisations. It is also a forum for dissemination of technology and advancements in the design and manufacture of rail [[Wheelset (rail transport)|wheelset]] components and their performance to promote increased productivity, performance and safety in rail operations.

==Recent meetings==
The 15th International Wheelset Congress was held in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]], in September 2007. The location of the congress is chosen worldwide according to a rotational rule. 

The 16th International Wheelset Congress was held at the [[Cape Town International Convention Centre]] in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], in March 2010. The event was hosted by Ringrollers Pty Ltd under the auspices of [[Union des Industries Ferroviaires Européennes]] (UNIFE) and ERWA.

The 17th International Wheelset Congress was held in [[Ukraine]] in 2013&lt;ref name="17iwc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.17iwc.com/ |title=Дополнительные ссылки |publisher=17 IWC |date= |accessdate=2013-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was hosted by KLW-WheelCo. The main topic of the conference - new technologies increasing the operational life cycle of the wheelsets.

'''Johan Didrik Schlömer Beichmann ''' [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] (30 May 1886 &amp;ndash; 10 February 1966) was a Norwegian military officer, journalist and businessman. A resistance pioneer during the [[German occupation of Norway]], he fled to London and eventually served as head commander of the Norwegian Army-in-exile. 

==Personal life==
Beichmann was born in [[Oslo|Kristiania]], the son of judge and civil servant [[Frederik Beichmann]], and writer [[Edle Hartmann]].&lt;ref name=barth41&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Barth |editor-first=Bjarne Keyser |editor-link=Bjarne Keyser Barth |encyclopedia=Norges militære embedsmenn 1929 |title=Beichmann, J.

==Career==
Beichmann graduated as military officer from the [[Norwegian Military Academy]] in 1907. He studied [[electrical engineering]] at the [[Technische Universität Darmstadt]] (1908–1908), and graduated from the [[Norwegian Military College]] in 1911.&lt;ref name=barth41/&gt; 

He worked as journalist for the newspaper ''[[Tidens Tegn]]'' from 1911 to 1912. From 1912 to 1917 he headed Infantry Regiment 16, and was also periodically assigned as topographer for the [[Norwegian Mapping and Cadastre Authority]].&lt;ref name=barth41/&gt; From 1918 to 1923 he was again journalist for ''Tidens Tegn'', and eventually manager for the newspaper from 1923 to 1933.&lt;ref name=heh1948/&gt;

He was promoted major in 1933, and in 1934 to lieutenant colonel and commander of the [[Alta Battalion]].&lt;ref name=heh1948&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1948|title=Beichmann, Johan |encyclopedia=[[Hvem er hvem?]]|editor1-last=Gram |editor1-first=Harald|editor1-link=Harald Gram|editor2-last=Steenstrup |editor2-first=Bjørn |editor2-link= |publisher=Aschehoug|location=Oslo|url=http://runeberg.org/hvemerhvem/1948/0040.html |page=40 |language=Norwegian|accessdate=15 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beichmann was a resistance pioneer during the [[German occupation of Norway]]. In 1941 he was in command of local so-called "fighting groups", which eventually developed to become part of the resistance organization [[Milorg]]. He had to flee from Norway in the autumn of 1941, and eventually reached London.&lt;ref name=nkl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Kraglund  |first=Ivar |authorlink= |editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl, Hans Fredrik]] |encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940-45]] |title=Beichmann, Johan |language=no  |url=http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/b/b1.html |accessdate=15 July 2018 |edition=  |year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |volume= |location=Oslo |id= |isbn=82-02-14138-9 |doi= |pages= |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030151756/http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/b/b1.html |archivedate=2013-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1942 to 1945 he served as head of the Norwegian {{ill|Hærens overkommando|no}} in London, with the rank of major general.&lt;ref name=heh1948/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Kiyoshi Aki'''|安藝 清|Aki Kiyoshi}} (born September 13, 1947) is the owner and founder of [[Aeon (eikaiwa)|Aeon Corporation]], one of the "Big Four" [[eikaiwa]] (conversational [[English language|English]]) schools in [[Japan]].

== Founding of Aeon ==
{{Main|Aeon (eikaiwa)}}
In 1973, Aki and university classmate [[Tsuneo Kusunoki]] founded the company AMVIC. The name was an acronym of the phrase "for AMbition and VICtory." The company would focus on foreign language studies.

Later, AMVIC International was split into two divisions. Aki became the head of {{nihongo|''AMVIC Gaigogakuin''|AMVIC外語学院|anbikku gaigogakuin}}, which provided foreign language training for students. Kusunoki assumed control of {{nihongo|''AMVIC Eikaiwa''|AMVIC英会話|anbikku eikaiwa}}, which specialized in English language education for non-native speakers.

In 1989, AMVIC International split into two separate companies, as the former partners developed differing visions of the company's future. Aki's company became Aeon, focusing on language learning in Japan. He remains Aeon's chairman as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeonet.co.jp/profile/company.html 会社概要｜英会話 AEON イーオン]&lt;/ref&gt; Kusunoki's company became [[GEOS (eikaiwa)|GEOS]], focusing on global language learning with focus on English language education. GEOS and Aeon remained competitors until April 2010 when GEOS filed for bankruptcy protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100422a1.html Geos school chain files for bankruptcy &amp;#124; The Japan Times Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Aki's wife is [[Italian-American]], and his daughter is [[Angela Aki]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fm20080912a1.html She, herself and AI sidebar: Mixed blessings] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5derbVPDu?url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fm20080912a1.html |date=January 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="keys"&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fm20090227r1.html Angela Aki turns to the keys for answers]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leonard Alfred Fulford''' (11 November 1928 – 27 November 2011) was a British [[commercial photographer]] and director, with a specialty for photography of [[still life]]. He was one of the founding members of [[BFCS]]. With studios in London, New York, Los Angeles and Milan, BFCS was one of the most successful commercial production companies of all time, winning the [[Palme d'Or]] at the Cannes Advertising Festival an unprecedented six times. Fulford directed the popular ''[[Go to work on an egg]]'' television commercials for the [[Egg Marketing Board]] during the 1960s.&lt;ref name=independent/&gt; Fulford also directed many of the iconic Guinness television commercials of the 1970s and 1980s,&lt;ref name=independent/&gt; along with other memorable spots like the [[Courage Brewery|Courage Best]] 'Rabbit Rabbit' commercial featuring the specially written song by Chas and Dave, and the iconic [[Simple Skincare|Simple skincare]] commercial in which robotic arms spray a pristine white lily with colouring and perfume.

His work earned him numerous awards and much recognition. The famous "[[Go to work on an egg]]" television ad campaign which he directed earned him the nickname "the eggman" within the industry. [[John Lennon]] makes reference to Len as "the eggman" in [[The Beatles]] song "[[I Am the Walrus]]".

Len Fulford retired in 1995 and resided in [[East Anglia]]. He died in [[Friston]], Suffolk, on 27 November 2011, at the age of 83.&lt;ref name=independent&gt;{{cite news|first=Phil|last=Davison|title=Len Fulford: Director behind the 'Go to work on an egg' and Guinness 'toucan' commercials   |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/len-fulford-director-behind-the-go-to-work-on-an-egg-and-guinness-toucan-commercials-6282930.html |work=[[The Independent]] |publisher= |date=2011-12-30 |accessdate=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is survived by three sons.  His wife, the former Gillian Fox, whom he married in 1953, died in 2007.&lt;ref name=independent/&gt;

The '''Lieutenant Joseph Patrick Kennedy Junior Memorial Skating Rink''' was an [[ice skating rink]] in the town of [[Barnstable, Massachusetts]]. It was named after the late [[Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.]], who was killed when his [[B-24 Liberator]] exploded during a bombing mission. The facility also doubled as an [[ice hockey rink]] for [[Barnstable High School]].  The last public skate occurred on March 22, 2009. It was replaced by the [[Hyannis Youth and Community Center]].

==History==

===Opening===
The '''Lt. Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Memorial Skating Centre''' rink opened in 1957 as an open-air skating rink. It was built with funds from the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. foundation, which made the name fitting.&lt;ref name="Party"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090323/NEWS/903230313|title=Kennedy Memorial Rink's farewell party|last=Gold|first=Robert|date=March 23, 2009|publisher=Cape Cod Online|accessdate=2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, the rink was extended in length from 185 to 215 feet, with its official 85 foot hockey width. At the time, this made it the second largest in the northeastern United States, behind one in [[West Point, New York]].&lt;ref name="Patriot"&gt;{{cite web|title=Early Files 11-12-10|url=http://www.barnstablepatriot.com/home2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=22820&amp;Itemid=36|publisher=[[The Barnstable Patriot]]|accessdate=1 January 2011|author=Patriot Staff|date=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was alright for skating during calm weather, but it was impossible to skate during a storm. Early skaters even had to shovel the ice after a snowfall.&lt;ref name="Party" /&gt; This led to it being enclosed in 1965.

Although the rink was enclosed, it was open to the outside warm air. This led to fog forming on some nights. It was also unable to be used during the summer, a thing that most modern rinks do not have to do.&lt;ref name="Party" /&gt; This shortcomings led to replacement plans.

For many years, the rink was home to [[Barnstable High School]]'s after [[prom]] celebration. The rink was used until 2008, when it was temporarily relocated to the high school because of the demolition of the rink.

===Replacement===
[[File:Demolition of the Kennedy Rink.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Demolition of the rink as viewed from the nearby [[Hyannis East Elementary School]]]]
In the early 2000s, there were plans to replace the rink with one rink next door in the [[Hyannis Youth and Community Center]]. The original plans for the center consisted of a one rink and an adjacent youth center. The plan was eventually scrapped and new plans incorporated the usage of two rinks, one gymnasium, a youth center, and a raised jogging track around the gymnasium.&lt;ref name="Party" /&gt;

===Closing===
The rink held its last public skate on March 22, 2009.&lt;ref name="Party" /&gt; This brought to an end 52 years of skating at the rink.&lt;ref name="Party" /&gt; The rink was eventually torn down, with a marker was placed in the spot of the former rinks center ice. One of the rinks will carry on the name of [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.]], while the other will be named after the highest private donor to the project.

'''Luther Kountze''' (October 29, 1841 &amp;ndash; April 17, 1918) was an [[United States|American]] [[banker]], responsible for helping the city of [[Denver, Colorado]] in a time of need and leaving a philanthropic legacy in [[Morristown, New Jersey]]. He founded a late-19th century national banking dynasty along with his brothers [[Charles Kountze|Charles]], [[Herman Kountze|Herman]] and [[Augustus Kountze|Augustus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1892/05/01/104127235.pdf "August Kountze obituary",] ''New York Times.'' May 1, 1892. Retrieved 1/28/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==
From 1858 to 1862 Luther worked at the [[Kountze Brothers Bank]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], which was operated by his brothers Augustus and Herman. Late in 1862 he went to Denver, Colorado, where he opened a bank under the name of Kountze Brothers and listed his brothers as senior members. In 1866 they organized the [[Colorado National Bank]] of Denver.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Hill, E.C. (1919) ''The Historical Register, Illustrated with Portrait Plates.'' p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a great fire engulfed much of the city in 1867, Kountze was credited with saving the city of [[Denver, Colorado]] from financial disaster, and ultimately, oblivion. Late that year and into the next Kountze worked with several other investors to form the company that would eventually become the [[Denver Pacific Railway|Denver Pacific Railroad and Telegraph Co.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denver-rmn.com/millennium/0608mile.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228084717/http://www.denver-rmn.com/millennium/0608mile.shtml |archivedate=2007-02-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Delbartonkountzemansion.jpg|thumb |Kountze built a large stone mansion in Morristown, shown here |Kountze's Mansion, now located on [[Delbarton School|Delbarton School's]] campus ]]Luther left Colorado for New York in 1867. In 1868 he established the Kountze Brothers Bank at 52 Wall Street in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtgothictomes.com/colorado_checks.htm Colorado bank check, Colorado revenue imprinted check. Mt. Gothic Tomes and Reliquary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; His brother Augustus later joined him there, where they traded securities and bonds. In 1908, U.S. Senator [[Robert M. La Follette Sr.]] included him in the "100 men who controlled banking." He was then vice-president and a director of the [[United States Mortgage and Trust Company]].

In 1881 Luther moved to [[Morristown, New Jersey]] and built an English-style estate. He died in 1918, leaving an estate valued at $4,973,950.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/11/29/98791102.pdf Description of estate assets], ''New York Times.'' November 29, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philanthropy===
Kountze was one of the founders of the [[Metropolitan Opera|Metropolitan Opera House Company]]. He contributed a large part of the land that now forms the National [[Jockey Hollow]] Park in Morristown, NJ.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

A marketing communication tool can be anything from: [[advertising]], [[personal selling]], [[direct marketing]], sponsorship, communication, promotion and public relations.&lt;ref  name=tomse2014/&gt;

MC are made up of the [[marketing mix]] which is made up of 4P's: Price, Promotion, Place and Product, for a business selling goods, and made up of 7P's: Price, Promotion, Place, Product, People, Physical evidence and Process, for a service based business.&lt;ref&gt;Kusumawati, R.

==Overview==
Marketing communications includes [[advertising]], promotions, sales, branding and online promotion.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The process allows the public businesses use to know or understand a brand. Successful branding involves targeting audiences who appreciate the organization's  marketing program.

Advertising is a small but important part of marketing communications; the marketing communications mix is a set of tools that can be used to deliver a clear and consistent message to target audiences. It is also commonly called the promotional mix. Crosier (1990) states that all terms have the same meaning in the context of the 4ps: Product, price, place and promotion.&lt;ref name="tomse2014" /&gt; Price can send a message to the target audience. For example, comparing a $50 bag to a $10 bag, the former may be viewed as a luxury or more durable item.

The [[marketing plan]] identifies key opportunities, threats, weaknesses and strengths, sets objectives and develops an action plan to achieve marketing goals. Each section of the 4P's sets its own object; for instance, the pricing objective might be to increase sales in a certain geographical market by pricing their own product or service lower than their competitors. This creates a significant change in the market because more people of the target market would aim to do business with your organization  than your competitors, because pricing is one of the most significant aspects of marketing that can change the whole market positively and or negatively.

==Definitions==
*Communication barriers: Communication barriers are factors that hinder the objectives of a marketing communication. Major communication barriers are: Noise and clutter, consumer apathy, brand parity and weak creative ideas or strategies. Noise is an unrelated sensory stimulus that distracts a consumer from the marketing message (for example, people talking nearby making it hard to hear a radio advertisement). Clutter is the high number and concentration of advertisements presented to a consumer at any time. As attention cannot be divided, there is a limit to how much can be taken in and processed, which means that a strong marketing communication needs to stand out from the clutter and be heard above the noise. (Ang, 2014. "Principles of Integrated Marketing Communications". Page 11.)
*Consumer apathy is the tendency of a consumer to avoid marketing communications. The consumer may not be interested, or consider themselves "in the market," and as such attempt to shut out the irrelevant marketing stimuli; this is known as selective attention. Alternatively, a consumer may be "in the market," yet not be aware of the brand or products existence or prevalence. Consumers tend to purchase familiar brands, and will not be inspired to investigate alternatives. One approach marketers use to overcome apathy is to create incentives, such as competitive pricing or loyalty rewards. (Ang, 2014. "Principles of Integrated Marketing Communications". Page 11.)
*Brand parity means a brand is not significantly different from its competition. Without a distinct value proposition, consumers do not develop brand preference or associations, and instead purchase purely based on price (Ang, 2014. "Principles of Integrated Marketing Communications". Page 12). This is not ideal, as effective marketing communication increases brand equity. One important objective of marketing communications is to develop a strong, unique brand identity that allows the brand to be positioned separate from its competition.
*[[Marketing mix]] is the most important part of marketing strategy, which is "the framework to manage marketing and incorporate it within a business context&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marketing Fashion, Second edition : Strategy, Branding and Promotion|last=Harriet|first=Posner|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;". 
*Marketing strategy: how a business achieves their marketing objectives.  The initial step to achieve a marketing strategy is to identify the market target and build up a plan that the business can implement.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==Communication==
Communication is one important aspect of the marketing mix.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of Marketing|last=Doyle|first=Charles|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marketing communication is often the largest component of communication within a company, which may be to present company values, objectives or specific products and services to investors, customers or the general public. In the 21st century, communications objectives focus on more customized messages, targeting customer groups or individuals to create high responses and greater brand interaction.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

As business becomes increasingly global with greater access to Internet, mobile phones and social media, new challenges exist to inform people in targeted foreign markets. Shifts in the global economy and access to new markets lead also to greater demands for product shipping and associated services. To be effective, communication strategies must converge with marketing objectives while also accounting for local languages, dialects and cultural norms.

External communications might involve market research questionnaires, office website, guarantees, company annual report and presentations for investors.  Internal communication can be the marketing materials, price list, product catalogues, sales presentations and management communications.    On the other hand, each market demands different types of communications. For example, the industrial market demands a more personal communication but the consumer market demands non-personal communication.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

There are also 4 different fundamental types of communication.
*One-to-many:  this kind of communication is the most original communication.  It is "generated from a single broadcast point and then available over airwaves or in mass print runs&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;".   This type of communication is usually adapted to news distribution that does not specific not even interactive.  Such as in an urgent notice play over airwave from broadcast in an industry, it is helpful for the general announcement.
*Many-to-one: many-to-one is usually connected to the one-to-many communication.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  For example, a reply button in your email box, a prepaid number bought from Spark. All the communication techniques proceeded to the public with bi-directional communication from mass communications.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
*One-to-one: this is the most intensive and interactive communication at a one-to-one level.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  There are so many examples like a sales presentation; a negotiation in the market or direct delivery is base on the one-to-one communication.  Most of this communication is face to face. But in the development of Internet, email and online shopping are taking place the chance to face to face of people.  Which is provided the chance to sellers and buyers talk more directly.  Another important is instant message 'chat' channel like Wechat and Facebook, which are becoming extremely popular in business.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
*Many-to-many: on the background of highly developed Internet, the many-to-many communication has been growing up such as online chat rooms, 'blogging' websites.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  The many-to-many communication stands for the participants are able to exchange their ideas and experiences.

One-to-one is more immediate, while the many-to-may channels tend to be less urgent but with greater longevity.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Psychology of communication=== 
One of the primary goals of a marketing communication is to persuade consumers, by either changing their perception of a brand, product or service, or persuading them to purchase (or feel motivated / tempted to purchase) a product or service. The "Elaboration Likelihood Model" is used to demonstrate how persuasion occurs. When a marketing communication message is sent out, first it must be acknowledged and attended by the receiver. By giving their attention to the marketing communication, consumers will begin to process and comprehend the message. There are two routes to persuasion: Central and peripheral. Central route processing is used in high-involvement purchase decisions. These are infrequent, high-risk purchases, usually involving large amounts of money and a significant amount of time (for example, purchasing a house or car). Because these purchase decisions are high risk, a large cognitive effort is expended in order to rationally select the most logical and valuable option available. In these marketing messages, information about the product or service itself is most valuable. 
Peripheral route processing is employed in low involvement purchase decisions. These are frequent, low-risk purchases, generally of a low or medium cost in which choices are made more on affective (or emotion based) values rather than cognitive (or rational) values. Because of this, marketing messages will employ more storytelling and imagery, focusing on how the product or service makes one feel, and the associations it has, rather than the attributes and specifications it possesses.

[[Communication]] can be defined as process of using, word, sound or visual cues to supply information to one or more people.&lt;ref&gt;*Communication. (n.d.). ''Merriam-Webster.'' Retrieved from http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/communication&lt;/ref&gt; A communication process is defined as information that is shared with the intent that the receiver understands the message that the business intended to send.&lt;ref&gt;Communication process. (n.d.). ''Business Dictionary.'' Retrieved from http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/communication-process.html&lt;/ref&gt; The communication process was once thought of as having the source of the message, which is then [[encoding|encoded]], put through the chosen [[communication channel]], which is then [[Code|decoded]] by the recipient and then received.&lt;ref name=belch2012/&gt;  Throughout the middle of the channel there is the potential for noise to distort the message being sent.&lt;ref name=belch2012/&gt;  Once the receiver has the message they then give feedback to the original source, where they then find out whether the campaign has been successful or not.&lt;ref name=belch2012/&gt;

With the prevalent use of technology, customers are seeking out information about brands, products and businesses prior to purchase.&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, D. C., &amp; Singer, M. (2015). Competing on Customer Journeys. ''Harvard Business Review, 93''(11), 88-100&lt;/ref&gt; This means that there is a need for an additional channel within the communication process, so it is a more accurate representation of the current business environment. Businesses are now having to take into consideration that both opinion leaders and opinion formers who have a great influence over today's society and their perceptions. So they have to be included into the communication process before the recipient of the message receives it.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, L., Zhao, J., &amp; Xu, K. (2016). Who creates Trends in Online Social Media: The Crowd of Opinion Leaders? ''Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 21''(1), 1-16&lt;/ref&gt;

This model is more effective when there is common ground between the senders and receivers so they can communicate effectively. Choosing the appropriate source helps develop the message and appeal to the targeted audience. The source will be more effective if they are relatable to the target audience. This realm of understanding is represented by the overlapping circles. The more knowledge the source has about who they are targeting, the better they can understand how the receiver may interpret or react to the message.&lt;ref name=belch2003/&gt;

The components of the transactional model are:
*'''Source:''' The source is an individual or organization that has information to share. The source (or sender) creates and sends the information to another person or group of people. The source maybe an individual (e.g. a sales person or spokesperson) or a non-personal identity (e.g. a corporation or organization). The communication process begins with the source, marketers must carefully choose a source as it affects how the message will be perceived by the target audience.&lt;ref name=belch2003&gt;Belch, G. E., &amp; Belch, M. A. (2003). ''Advertising and promotion: An integrated marketing communications perspective''. The McGraw− Hill. Retrieved from, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://202.74.245.22:8080/xmlui/handle/123456789/54&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Encoding:''' This is transposing the intended meaning of the message with words, symbols or pictures to show a message. Encoding is the development of the message that contains the information the source hopes to convey. It is putting together the thoughts, ideas and information into a symbolic form that can be transmitted and understood by the receiver.&lt;ref name=belch2003/&gt; Encoding the message is the second step in the communication process. The encoding process leads to development of a message that contains the information or meaning the source hopes to convey. Encoding is extremely important, it is a brain activity that takes effect when the receiver makes sense of a brand message or idea used to convey meaning: words, colour, pictures, signs, symbols or even music. The message may be verbal or nonverbal, oral or written, or symbolic (e.g. the sound of a brass band being redolent of simpler times or heritage). or it can often include 'cues' such as the Nike 'swoosh' which indicates success. Often things can get in the way of the "correct" encoding and the interpretation of the intended message (decoding). There are methods the sender can use to make sure the receiver interprets the message correctly, these methods include; channels, consumer insights, having similarities with the receiver and frame of reference (e.g. age, values, culture).&lt;ref name="belch2012"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advertising and promotion: An integrated marketing communications perspective (9th ed.)|last=Belch, G. E., &amp; Belch, M. A.|publisher=McGraw-Hill Irwin.|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, it is extremely important for the sender to get to know its receiver and this is accomplished through research for targeting strategy. These concepts help craft the intended message in the minds of the consumer.

*'''Message''': The message comes from the encoding process, it is the content, meaning or information the sources hopes to convey. The message can be in many forms such as verbal, non-verbal, oral, written or symbolic.&lt;ref name=belch2003/&gt;

*'''Channel''': The channel is the method by which the communication travels from the source or sender to the receiver.&lt;ref name="belch2012" /&gt; There are two types of channels, personal and non-personal. Personal channels of communication are direct and target individual groups. Personal communication channels are connected with two or more persons who communicate directly with each other face-to-face, person-to-person through telephone, email or fax. Social channels also fall under the category of personal communications. Friends, neighbors, associates, co-workers, or family members are all means of social channels.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business communication (7th ed)|last=Krizan, A., Merrier, P., Logan, J., Williams, K.|publisher=|year=2008|isbn=|location=Canada|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Carrying a message without interpersonal contact between sender and receiver is known as non-personal channels of communication. Mass media or mass communications are examples of non-personal channels, since the message is sent to many individuals at one time. Non-personal channels of communication are made up out of two main types, the first being print. Print media includes newspapers, magazines, direct mail, and billboards. The second type is broadcast; broadcast media includes radio and television.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Modica, T., Hoffmann, K.|date=2010|title=Formal Modeling of Communication Platforms using Reconfigurable Algebraic High-Level Nets|url=http://journal.ub.tu-berlin.de/eceasst/article/view/426/417|journal=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Decoding:''' The receiver unravels the symbols to interpret what is being communicated. Transforming the sender's message back into thought. This is influenced greatly by the receiver's frame of reference (or realm of understanding) which involves their values, attitudes and state of mind when receiving the message. For the model to be effective the decoding by the receiver would match the encoding by the source, meaning they correctly understand the message that was sent.&lt;ref name=belch2003/&gt; Decoding is the process of interpreting messages and relies on correct encoding and the ability of the receiver to deconstruct transmitted meaning. Decoding occurs when the message reaches one or more of the receiver's senses. Consumers both hear and see television ads, others consumers handle (touch) and read (see) an advertising offer (e.g. coupon). According to Belch &amp; Belch this process is deeply influenced by the receiver's frame of reference or field of experience, which refers to the experiences, perceptions, attitudes, and values he or she brings to the communication situation.&lt;ref name="belch2012" /&gt; For effective communication to occur, the message decoding process of the receiver must match the encoding of the sender. Over this entire means the receiver comprehends and correctly translates what the source is trying to communicate. Effective communication is more likely to emerge when there is some common ground between the two parties. The more familiarity the sender has about the receivers, the better the sender can understand their needs, commiserate with them, and over all communicate more effectively.

*'''Receiver''': The individual (s) that the source shares thoughts or information with. The receiver hears, sees or reads the message and decodes it.

*'''Noise:''' Noise is any external interference during this communication process. Any external factors that creates unplanned distortion. This distortion can make it difficult for the receiver to interpret or assign meaning to a message as it was intended by the source. Examples of noise in the encoding of the message could be lack of radio or television signal. Noise can also occur when the sender and receivers fields of experience do not overlap, if there is no common ground between them, which may result in a misunderstanding in the meaning of the message.&lt;ref name=belch2003/&gt; Throughout the communication process, the message is subject to irrelevant factors that can distort or interfere with its reception. Noise is the physical or Psychological fundamentals either from inside or outside of the process of communication. Noise acts as a barrier as it makes the message less accurate, less productive and unclear. It may even prevent the message from ever reaching the receiver. Physical noise is often triggered by badly made images or messages (e.g. poor print quality) or elements of distraction (e.g. consumer scrolling through TV advertisements). Psychological noise could be mixed meanings, poor credibility of source or the insignificance of the message to the consumer requirements. Not having a connection with the receiver and lacking in common ground usually cause this. This may result in unsuitable encoding of the message such as; using a sign, symbol, or word that is unfamiliar or has different meaning to the receiver (e.g. sending a message in foreign language that is not understood by the receiver). The more common ground there is between the sender and the receiver, the less likely it is for noise and barriers to interrupt a message.&lt;ref name="belch2012" /&gt;

*'''Response/Feedback''': The receiver's reaction to the message provides feedback to the sender. This is the set of reactions after seeing, hearing or reading the message. The receiver's response is the feedback and lets the sender know how the message was decoded and received. A form of feedback in an interpersonal selling situation could be questions, comments or any reactions (such as expressions) about the message. In mass media an indication of how the marketing communications were perceived is the amount of sales after the message has been sent. There are many different ways such as attitude change, store visits and inquires that provide feedback in mass media. Feedback can help to improve the communication process and the success of future messages.&lt;ref name=belch2003/&gt; The receiver's particular type of reactions after seeing, hearing, or reading a message is known as a response. Receivers' responses can range from either non noticeable actions or noticeable actions. Non noticeable responses can be storing their information in memory and noticeable responses are immediate action such as dialing the commercials number to order a product advertised on television. One of the main goals of communication is receiving appropriate receiver responses, feedback closes the loop in the communications flow and lets the sender monitor how the intended message is being decoded and received. To achieve this goal one can ask indirectly or directly for the response, or assist the receiver in giving the response.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Receiving feed back can be more difficult for parties that advertise through the channels of mass media, because advertisers are not in direct contact with their customers so other methods must be obtained to determine how their messages have been received. While the critical form of feedback happens through sales, it is often hard to show a direct relationship between advertising and purchase behavior. So marketers; visit stores, check coupon redemption, use reply cards and listen to customer inquiries to achieve feedback. Once a significant amount of feedback/response study has been gathered advertisers would then have enough information to determine reasons for success or failure in the communication process and from there they can make appropriate adjustments.

===Opinion leaders and opinion formers===
[[Opinion leader]]s are consumers who have large influence over the purchasing behaviour of other consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Opinion Leaders. (n.d.). ''Business Dictionary.'' Retrieved from http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/opinion-leaders.html&lt;/ref&gt; These can be peers or celebrities, and often represent a "desired state" in the eye of the influenced consumer. By following the consumption patterns of opinion leaders, consumers aspire to achieve a similar status or lifestyle, and project a similar image. Because of this, opinion leaders are powerful factors in marketing communications. Having opinion leaders endorse a brand can increase brand awareness and sales. Due to this, large companies pay highly influential celebrities to endorse their products.

You can receive the opinion leaders' thoughts or feeling towards the product/service through paid advertising, social media, blogs, or any other form of written media.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://evconsumerbehaviour.angelfire.com/opinion-leaders-formers-followers.html|title=Opinion leaders, formers &amp; followers|date=|website=evconsumerbehaviour|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These can be direct, or indirect influences.

[[Opinion Former]]s are consumers who are regarded by their peers as being highly knowledgeable and trustworthy.&lt;ref&gt;Opinion Formers. (n.d.). ''Business Dictionary.'' Retrieved from http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/opinion-formers.html&lt;/ref&gt; They are considered experts in selecting the highest quality products due to their extensive knowledge, and as such are able to influence the purchasing behaviour of other consumers despite lacking the celebrity status of an opinion leader. They have specialized knowledge about the area which corresponds with the product, service or business. For example, this could be a doctor sponsoring a form of medication, or a personal trainer recommending a sports brand to the customer.  This means that both opinion leaders and opinion formers have a large influence on the consumer and their perceived view of the business, product, or service provided.&lt;ref name=stehr2015/&gt; If a brand is specializing in the sale and manufacturing of makeup products, the business would want to look at someone who is both known for their knowledge about makeup and also someone who they know is popular within that community, so that the message is as wide spread throughout their target market as possible.&lt;ref name=stehr2015&gt;Stehr, P., Rossler, P., Leissner, L., &amp; Schonhardt, F. (2015) Parasocial Opinion Leadership Media Personalities'' Influence within Parasocial Relations: Theoretical Conceptualization and Preliminary Results. ''International Journal of Communication (19328036)'', 9982-1001&lt;/ref&gt;
Opinion leaders add another link in the communication process, acting as a "meaning filter" for the receivers of the message (Dahlen, 2010). The message is sent from the sender and the opinion leaders share their opinions with the targeted audience.

===Adjusted model of communications===
The core model of communication has been criticized for its linearity – sender, message, receiver and its absence of structural perception.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, S. (1980). Encoding/decoding. ''Culture, media, language'', 128-138. Retrieved from, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.hu.mtu.edu/~jdslack/readings/CSReadings/Hall_Encoding-n-Decoding.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Since then an adjusted model of communication has developed.

The adjusted model of communication was developed within a marketing context, when marketers saw that people were affected more by influential homophilous groups (family and friends) and heterophilous groups (outside the person's network) than mass media (Dahlen, 2010).

The adjusted model is different to the core model of communication because it incorporates opinion leaders also known as gate keepers.

== Mass media ==
===Television===
{{main|television advertising}}
Television has since its inception dominated the advertising media scene, due to its combination of visual and aural stimulation, allowing for greater attention grabbing and more effective transmission of messages than other forms of media. It has a few disadvantages: television commercials suffer from being "zipped" and zapped". "Zipping" is the term given to fast forwarding commercial break sessions during the pre-recording of programs. Often viewers will record programs purely so they can be viewed without the commercial breaks. "Zapping" is the term given to the habit of many consumers to change channels during commercial breaks. This is also done to avoid watching advertisements. Using television advertisements is beneficial due to its wide reach and the degree to which content can be segmented according to the intended target market. Advertisements are carefully paired with time segments and / or linked with appropriate programming, known as "media vehicles". This helps to ensure the intended audience is being reached with the marketing message.&lt;ref name=Ang14&gt;Ang, 2014. "Principles of Integrated Marketing Communications".&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|118}}

While initial production costs of a television advertisement are high, it is likely to reach a mass audience and, therefore, maintains a low cost per viewer, making it an efficient communication platform.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

===Radio===
{{main|radio advertising}}
Radio by definition is the broadcasting of sound programmes to the public and today can be live streamed through a broadband connection or digitally transmitted into people's cars or homes.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuyucu|first=Mihalis|date=October 2014|title=From Analog to Digital Radio Management: The New Radio and New Media|url=http://www.ojcmt.net/articles/44/444.pdf|journal=Online Journal of Communication and Media Technologies|volume=4|issue=4|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being the oldest form of media transmission still being used, marketing via radio remains a popular and effective choice due to its relatively lower cost and convenience (radio exposure can occur during transit, at work, and during recreational activities). Due to the lack of a visual aspect, radio advertising attempts to create imagery in the consumers mind. Radio advertising is also extremely effective at reinforcing messages encountered in other channels (such as television).&lt;ref name=Ang14/&gt;{{rp|122}} A familiar jingle or voice associated with a brand enhances brand and ad awareness, ultimately increasing brand equity. This is an example of "Integrated Marketing Communications", in which multiple marketing channels are simultaneously utilized to increase the strength and reach of the marketing message. Like television, radio marketing benefits from the ability to select specific time slots and programmes (in this case in the form of radio stations and segments within).

Fill et al.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; argue that radio communication promotes "emotional consumer–centric associations" as each listener is forced to construct a visual representation of the words and sounds such as music in their minds. A common technique used by companies is known as imagery transfer, where a complementary visual television advertisement is used alongside a one-dimensional radio advertisement featuring a similar audio track to stimulate a visual association between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Advertising|author1=Arens, William |author2=Arens, Christian |author3=Weigold, Michael |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2011|isbn=|edition=13|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests this sub-conscience relational thought process greatly benefits future brand recognition and awareness.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Radio infomercials are often a simple script that is read out by the presenter. This is quick and does not require extensive lead times due to minimal production efforts.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

===Print===
[[Printed media]] is the most basic form of media advertising. It is the most challenging to create strong imagery with, due to its lack of sensory stimulation, but can be effective in efficient, clear information communication and message delivery. Where a consumer may miss a message in video or audio (perhaps a loud noise interrupts, or someone blocks their view) in print the message remains visible indefinitely. Aspects such as size, colour and style can be used to increase effectiveness relative to other print advertisements, which is important as despite being a basic media communication channel, print is the second largest medium after television (Ang, 2014. "Principles of Integrated Marketing Communications". Page 126.).

Traditionally, marketing communications practitioners focused on the creation and execution of printed marketing collateral. Traditional media, or as some refer to as old media, has been used within the marketing and advertising world for many years.&lt;ref name="McGraw-Hill"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Belch, &amp; Belch|title=Advertising and promotion: An integrated marketing communications perspective|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Boston, M.A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional media encompasses conventional forms of advertising media, such as television, magazines, newspapers, radio, and direct mail and outdoor.  For many decades, these forms of communication have been the main source for marketers to reach both consumers and other companies. In a world with no internet and the vast world of social media, roots of advertising and promotion lie within traditional media, where there is a more direct, physical way of advertising.

Advertising in the form of print is used by businesses in the form of billboards, magazines, newspapers and posters, to get their message across to the target audience. Businesses will usually place a billboard in areas where in can be easily seen and where the target audience will spend their daily activities. Newspaper, magazines and posters are smaller in size and can be found in numerous places allowing the general public availability to read them. Depending on the product or service that is being advertised, marketers may specify where majority of their prints may go to, such as advertisement of a new shampoo may be more common within salons.

Print media are a highly customizable, varying in print size, font, positioning and colour combination. Newspapers commonly use coarse paper and tend to have poor reproduction quality, while magazines can enhance the appearance of a certain product due to the heavy weight gloss paper used which translates colour well and offers a long lasting quality and likeability.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Magazines function as a frame, a psychological device which manipulates perspective and judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Barnes, James H |author2=Reid, Leonard N |author3=Rotfield, Herbert J |date=1984|title=Attention to Magazine Ads as Function of Layout Design|url=|journal=Journalism Quarterly|volume=62|issue=2|pages=439–441|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Vogue, a leading paid circulation fashion magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiss|first=David|date=2014|title="That's part of what we do" The Performance power of Vogue's Anna Wintour|url=https://cjdept.unm.edu/research/recent/docs/weiss-thats-part-of-what-we-do-chapter-2014.pdf|journal=Journal of Magazine and New Media Research|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1–29|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; publishes advertising efforts alongside beautiful imagery and elegant photography, the association of the two communicates respectability and sophistication and promotes the creditability of the brands which appear in the same publication. Due to the high-quality reproduction, magazines tend to last longer and are often found in hair salons and waiting rooms. Consumers often cut out individual images which further prolongs the message and increases potential exposure. Although the relevance of the message may be lost during this extended time, brand awareness may still be raised.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; {{repetition|date=January 2017}}

Magazines are often segmented by subject such as women's health, automotive or fashion and therefore effectively reach a particular target market while newspapers focus on geographical regions which tend to appeal to a broad representative population sample and, therefore, offer low impact in selectivity. Newspapers are often run on a weekly schedule offering up to date information and coverage of local events and businesses as a lower coast alternative. Such advertisements in smaller typeface and are black and white.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

===Decline===
Traditional media is gradually losing effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trusov, Bucklin, &amp; Pauwel|title=Effects of Word-of-Mouth Versus Traditional Marketing: Findings from an Internet Social Networking Site.|journal=Journal of Markerting|date=2009|volume=73|issue=5|pages=90–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change is driven by two key factors: audience fragmentation and ability to choose commercial content. Television, radio, magazines, and newspapers are becoming more fragmented and reaching smaller and more selective audiences.  The rapid growth of communication due to interactive media, particularly the internet have caused the changes in the use of communication through media, with businesses preferring to use modern media over more traditional media methods. Consumers cannot avoid new and innovative ways of communication.&lt;ref name="McGraw-Hill"/&gt; Many marketers believe that traditional methods of advertising have become too expensive and is not cost-effective compared to modern media. Traditional forms of marketing communications such as advertising are one way in nature, whereas new media allows marketers to perform a variety of functions.

==Communication platforms==
Communication platforms like Skype, Facebook or other types of media have become extremely important means of communication. Although there are other methods of communications that aren't just related to [[social media]], people can also be hugely influenced by their peers, this process is known as social mediation.  Marketing Communication Platforms are a powerful capability for personalizing and expending marketing contents in an automated fashion based on the profile of the recipients.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A [[wiktionary:platform|platform]] by simplest definition is a raised floor or stage. It functions as a similar principle in marketing communications, providing awareness and information about a specific brand or product.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marketing Communication: A brand narrative approach |author1=Dahlen Michael |author2=Lange Fedrick |author3=Smith Terry |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2010 |url=https://autonline.aut.ac.nz/bbcswebdav/pid-3617607-dt-content-rid-6697168_3/orgs/BUS_BK_MARKETIns/603/Dahlen_w2.pdf |isbn= |location=West Sussex, UK |pages= }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strategic selection of various communication platforms is known as a media strategy which aims to engage an audience in a meaningful conversation and, as a result, create a lasting relationship.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Consumer-Centric Marketing|last=Cundari|first=Aldo|publisher=Wiley|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern technology has expanded the use of platforms and ways in which consumers and the brand can interact. As a result, the context of platforms and how they are defined has changed.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cole|first=Michael D.|last2=Long|first2=Mary M.|last3=Chiagouris|first3=Larry G.|last4=Gopalakrishna|first4=Pradeep|date=2011-04-01|title=Transitioning from Traditional to Digital Content: An Examination of Opinion Leadership and Word-of-Mouth Communication across Various Media Platforms|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15332861.2011.571990|journal=Journal of Internet Commerce|volume=10|issue=2|pages=91–105|doi=10.1080/15332861.2011.571990|issn=1533-2861}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various platforms by which communication is transmitted,&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advertising Strategy, Creativity and Media|author1=Fill, Chris |author2=Hughes, Graham |author3=De Francessco, Scott |publisher=Pearson|year=2013|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these can be categorised as paid, owned, earned and shared, formally named as the integrated communication triangle by Grönroos and Lindberg-Repo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Finne|first=Åke|last2=Grönroos|first2=Christian|date=2009-07-01|title=Rethinking marketing communication: From integrated marketing communication to relationship communication|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13527260902757654|journal=Journal of Marketing Communications|volume=15|issue=2-3|pages=179–195|doi=10.1080/13527260902757654|issn=1352-7266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model acknowledges that communication must be credible and trustworthy to be effective. Studies reveal many consumers look at review forums and ask friends or peers whom they trust for ratings on products before making a purchase decision.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Therefore, effective communication relies on an integrated approach of one dimensional and interactive platforms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marketing communications: A brand narrative approach|last=Dahlen, M., Lange, F., &amp; Smith, T|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons.|year=2010|isbn=|location=West Sussex, UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Explicitly planned market content is communicated through non-personal communication platforms.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Muller, Richard |author2=Wergin, Rand |date=2012|title=A case study in marketing communications: Traditional vs e-media advertising|url=|journal=International Journal of the Academic Business World|volume=6|issue=1|pages=85–94|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brand is in control of the platform, message content, frequency and repetition of the communication message.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Andreas M.|last2=Haenlein|first2=Michael|date=2010-01-01|title=Users of the world, unite!

Other aspects of noise decrease the effectiveness of message penetration, for example, most paid communication platforms, print and electronic media are filled with marketing and advertising messages and are subject to clutter, often forcing brands to compete for attention.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; To eliminate noise brands often choose to include inserts such as samples and scent strips within magazines while newspapers utilise "call to action" inserts such as coupons which encourage consumers to visit or try a local service or good.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

==Guerrilla marketing==
Due to the rise in advertising clutter, there has been a push for non-traditional media such as [[guerrilla marketing]].&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Micael Dahlén|last2=Anton Granlund|last3=Mikael Grenros|date=2009-05-01|title=The consumer-perceived value of non-traditional media: effects of brand reputation, appropriateness and expense|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/07363760910954091|journal=Journal of Consumer Marketing|volume=26|issue=3|pages=155–163|doi=10.1108/07363760910954091|issn=0736-3761}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guerrilla Marketing is usually a low-cost way of generating buzz through creative or unexpected communication platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tam Duc Dinh|last2=Khuong Ngoc Mai|date=2015-12-21|title=Guerrilla marketing's effects on Gen Y's word-of-mouth intention – a mediation of credibility|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/10.1108/APJML-06-2015-0102|journal=Asia Pacific Journal of Marketing and Logistics|volume=28|issue=1|pages=4–22|doi=10.1108/APJML-06-2015-0102|issn=1355-5855}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outdoor settings provide potential ground to gain attention from a large audience. An example is customizing street infrastructure or creating an event such as a flash mob. Research rates guerrilla advertising as having a higher perceived value compared to other communication platforms, which tends to result in a positive consumer response.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; An example of successful guerrilla marketing was created by Volkswagen (VW) in their promotional "driven by fun" campaign, where consumers could use VW "fast lane" slide instead of the escalator to get to the bottom of the stairs faster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.creativeguerrillamarketing.com/guerrilla-marketing/volkswagens-new-guerrilla-campaign-encourages-people-to-try-the-fast-lane/|title=Volkswagen's New Guerrilla Campaign Encourages People To Try The 'Fast Lane'|website=Creative Guerrilla Marketing|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Touch points==
Every point of contact is a form of communication and it is, therefore, necessary to consider touch points as a communication platform. Touch points can be either physical or a human interaction between a brand and the consumer which influence customer decision-making process during pre-purchase, purchase and post-purchase.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Chris|date=2003|title=Brand touchpoints|url=|journal=Information Outlook|volume=7|issue=11|pages=38|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many ways in which a customer may interact with a business.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Interactions occur through direct customer service exchanges, a company website, the point of purchase environment and product packaging or performance.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; These all contribute to consumer perceptions of a particular brand. For instance, the service-scape of a purchase touch point such as a retail store can influence the perception of quality and service through lighting and layout or other sensory touch points, for example smell.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; [[Fast fashion]] retailers such as Topshop maintain a white store interior and exterior which is perceived as luxurious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Visual Merchandising: Window and In-Store displays for Retail|last=Morgan|first=Tony|publisher=Laurance King|year=2011|isbn=|location=London, UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the higher price point and packaging of Ferrero Rocher may communicate sophistication and better quality. Visual appearance can have a significant effect on purchase decision,&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; companies such as Coke a Cola and Pepsi provide a free fridge to distributors to control how products are displayed at the point of purchase.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

==Multiplier effect==
While boarding a [[United Airlines]] flight, Dave Carroll saw baggage handlers on the tarmac damage his [[Taylor Guitars|Taylor]] guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2009/jul/23/youtube-united-breaks-guitars-video|title=Singer gets his revenge on United Airlines and soars to fame|last=Tran|first=Mark|date=2009-07-23|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; After failed attempts to solve the issue through customer service, Carroll uploaded a humorous [[YouTube]] video titled "United breaks guitars",&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; which experienced over 15 million views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=sonsofmaxwell|title=United Breaks Guitars|date=2009-07-06|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YGc4zOqozo|accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, United faced a drop in the stock market.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Carroll's YouTube video is an example of the '''multiplier effect''', and how consumer experiences are shared through user-generated content (UGC) networks and word of mouth communication.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Research shows customer are more likely to pass on negative experiences, and therefore, such interactive platforms have a significant impact on purchase decisions and brand outlook.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

This highlights a trend in integration of consumer behaviour with marketing communications, where technology has facilitated social group communication. Communication has changed from one direction with companies in control of their message to a dialogue where businesses interact with consumer feedback.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; As Andy Lark, Commonwealth Bank CMO states "the power has shifted, we are now entering a transparent age where there are no secrets".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/marketing-and-advertising-shift-to-where-the-eyeballs-are--online-20120406-1wgz3.html|title=Marketing and advertising shift to where the eyeballs are - online|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional models viewed paid media platforms as the primary source of information. However technology has enabled dialogue within a consumer-centric communication platform.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This flow of information allows a many-to-many exchange through UGC, which includes all types of creative content online through blogs, chats, forums, online platforms for product reviews and social media websites such as [[Facebook]], YouTube and [[Instagram]],&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; which are known as earned and shared media.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

==Co-creation==
[[Nike Inc.|Nike]] built an example of co-creation and customer empowerment through earned and shared media. Nike ID is an online application that allows customers to design their shoe and therefore "Just do it online".&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Market-generated media remain an important communication platform and information source.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  Consumers tend to consider both market-generated and UGC when making a purchase decision,&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; particularly, for higher involvement product like [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] [[record album]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dhar|first=Vasant|last2=Chang|first2=Elaine A.|date=2009-11-01|title=Does Chatter Matter? The Impact of User-Generated Content on Music Sales|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1094996809000723|journal=Journal of Interactive Marketing|volume=23|issue=4|pages=300–307|doi=10.1016/j.intmar.2009.07.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transition from traditional media to various forms of online and UGC marketing is increasing. Academics recognize that marketing communication is an open system and customers are influenced by multiple communication platforms.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;  Ultimately positive brand encounters manifest brand supporters who contribute to positive earned and shared media, through product recommendations online and offline.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

===The internet===
The Internet features both non-personal and personal forms of communication. It has become one of the most dominant sources of information for most consumers. Belch &amp; Belch {{asof|2012|lc=yes}} explained that the internet is mostly a non-personal form of communication as consumers absorb information online with no personal contact between the consumer and the organizations that are providing the information on their websites. However, as the internet develops, it is including personal communication as consumers interact with marketers online as well as communicate and share information with one another through the use of [[social media]].&lt;ref name="belch2012" /&gt;

The Internet allows multimedia documents to be shared among its users. {{asof|2003}} approximately 30 million websites have been registered worldwide and 650 million were connected to the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kitchen|first1=Phillip J|last2=Pelsmacker|first2=Patrick De|title=Integrated Marketing Communications: A Primer|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet as a marketing tool can be used to reach and inform customers directly, create brand loyalty, and build relationships. Online advertising includes elements such as: graphic images as website banners, [[pop-up advertisement]]s, [[homepage]] restyling and anchor deals (co-operation between two organizations ).&lt;ref name="Marketing Management"/&gt;

====Interactivity====
Interactivity is a characteristic feature of the Internet that was described in 1996 by John Deighton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deighton|first=J.|last2=Tedlow|first2=R.|date=1996|title=The Future of Interactive Marketing|url=|journal=Harvard Business Review|volume=|pages=151–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that in the then-new Internet business environment, clients rather than the marketers usually start the interaction, by actively looking for the information that they need. Moreover, personal responses of customers will be collected by corporations and their individual demands will be met according to their desires.

On one hand, traditional media are "push" formats where marketers broadcast their messages to customers, but do not allow direct feedback. The interaction between the two parties is few and far between. On the other hand, Internet media have the attribute of "pull" where customers have the freedom to search for whatever they wish. For instance, whenever a consumer types "flower" on [[Google]]'s search engine, an advertisement of a specific flower shop might be placed on the top or bottom of the search result page by the [[AdWords|Google Adword]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|title=An introduction to Google AdWords|date=|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFzoM59bIQ8|accessdate=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Google]] makes use of the client's search history and location to place an appropriate ad. The traditional one-way "push" communication is supplanted by the more productive two-way "push and pull" interaction.

====Individualisation====
Compared with the traditional media where the same information is received by all consumers, Internet media can send information "tailored" to the need of a specific consumer.This is another advantage of two-way interaction of the Internet media. One of the first and most prominent examples is the personalized service provided by [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] in which consumers are called by their names and "tailored" recommendations are provided according to their previous purchase records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Internet marketing strategy, implementation and practice|last=Chaffey|first=D.|date=2006|publisher=Financial Times Prentice Hall|year=|isbn=|edition=|location=Harlow|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, besides "tailored" individual service, with the accumulation of consumers' information on the Internet, [[Mass customization|mass customisation]] becomes possible in which companies provide "tailored" content to particular segment of consumers with similar interests. [[Douban]] is a Chinese social networking service website which allows its users to rate movies, TV dramas, music and concerts. It rapidly grew to 200 million registered users in 2013 (founded in 2005). In addition, people who like the same TV drama, like ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', or fans of the same movie star, such as [[Tom Cruise]], will group together to discuss and share their feelings. This allows companies to take advantage of mass customisation to sell products or reinforce their [[brand equity]] in suitable target groups. By doing so, the interaction and co-operation of companies and consumers are deepening, widening and multiplying in a variety of ways.

====Industry restructuring====
Restructuring followed by [[disintermediation]] and [[Re-intermediation|reintermediation]] is one of the essential features of the transition from traditional to Internet marketing communications. The Internet may force traditional distributors or retailers out of business simply because Internet transactions are less costly. [[JD.com]] significantly impacted the distribution channels for personal computers in China as of 2009 by allowing consumers to order different parts of the computers, that were then assembled by the online business, leaving tens of thousands of retailers in that field out of their jobs. In 2015, JD.com accounted for 22.9% of the Chinese online shopping's market share.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/323115/market-share-of-b2c-online-retailers-in-china/|title=China: B2C online retailers market share 2015 {{!}} Statistic|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=|access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, according to ''[[Financial Times]]'', with the shifting trend of using mobile phones for online purchase in China, the people using cellphones to log on to the Internet outnumbered those using PC,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/e3081bac-6e66-11e4-afe5-00144feabdc0|title=JD.com growth reflects Chinese consumer shift to mobile|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=|access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; the next wave of restructuring faced by JD.com and its major competitors like [[Alibaba Group|Alibaba]]. In 2014, JD.com's orders deriving from mobile phones increased by 543%, compared with the last year's quarter of the same period. Haoyu Shen, the chief executive of the JD.com, ascribed this result to its own company's app rather than the co-operation with [[Tencent|Tecent]], the Chinese second largest online corporation, although it invested in JD.com in March 2014. As an [[E-commerce|ecommerce]] business, JD.com has been constantly facing challenges and opportunities of reintermediation with the rapid shifts of the technology development of the Internet.

===Social media===
Social media's market penetration is rising thanks to services like YouTube, Facebook and Instagram.  Companies are using these external social media platforms to personally engage with existing and future customers, reinforce brand messaging, influence customer opinions, provide targeted offers, and service customers more efficiently..&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/TalkDebbie/building-a-brand-platform|title=Is your brand bland or grand|last=Elliot, D.|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Email===
[[Email marketing]] is directly marketing a commercial message to a group of people using [[email]]. In its broadest sense, every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing. It usually involves using email to send ads, request business, or solicit sales or donations, and is meant to build loyalty, trust, or brand awareness. Email marketing can be done to either sold lists or a current customer database. Broadly, the term is usually used to refer to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing the relationship of a merchant with its current or previous customers, to encourage customer loyalty and repeat business, acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately, and adding advertisements to email messages sent by other companies to their customers.

===In-product communication===
Another channel for direct [[digital marketing]] is [[in-product communication]] (or in-product marketing), which delivers marketing content directly to a user's [[internet of things|internet-connected device]] or [[software|software application]]. In-product marketing content is often very similar to that of email marketing campaigns, but the segmentation and delivery is more targeted.  Because email has become a standard tool in the [[digital marketing]] toolkit, the email channel often is overloaded and overused, leading to much lower [[open rate]]s, lower engagement rates, lower [[click-through rate|click-through rates (CTR)]], and lower [[conversion marketing|conversion rates]].  The rise of internet-connected ([[Internet of Things|IOT]]) devices is enabling a growing number of consumer products manufacturers to take advantage of this channel of marketing communications, to supplement other digital marketing channels.

==Direct marketing==
In [[direct marketing]] the producer communicates directly with potential customers, instead of through third party media. Individual customer's responses and transactions are recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCorkell|title=Direct and Database Marketing|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct marketing is a growing form of marketing communication. It is designed to build the relationship between the customer and the brand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tapp|first1=J|title=The strategic value of direct marketing: what are we good at?|journal=Journal of Database Marketing|issue=9|pages=9–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as [[customer relationship management]] (CRM). Organizations  use customer accounts in order to monitor and understand their needs. They manage detailed information about the customer's touch points with the objective to maximize satisfaction and loyalty. The communication can be in person, by telephone, mail, email or website.&lt;ref name="Marketing Management"/&gt; The interaction between the organization  and the customer is usually a two-way communication. Direct marketing relies on CRM databases which contain valuable customer information. Good quality databases can provide a competitive advantage and increase profitability. Treating the customer database as an expense rather than an investment, or not continuously maintaining or updating them can be detrimental.&lt;ref name="Marketing Management"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cant|first1=M|last2=Strydom|first2=J|last3=Jooste|first3=C|last4=du Plessis|first4=P|title=Marketing Management|date=2006|publisher=Juta &amp; Co Ltd|location=Cape Town, South Africa|page=458|edition=Fifth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct mail===
Direct mail is a letter, card, catalogue, or sample sent through post, email, [[fax]], or courier. This communication is most effective when the recipient has shown interest in or has previously purchased from the organization. Advantages of direct mail are personalisation, careful targeting, creativity and flexibility. Email is low-cost, but can be lost through [[spam (email)|spam]] and junk email filters. Direct mail is dependent on accurate databases.&lt;ref name="Marketing Management"/&gt;

===Telemarketing===
[[Telemarketing]] is marketing communication via telephone. There are two types of telemarketing: outbound and inbound.&lt;ref name="Marketing Management"/&gt; Outbound telemarketing is used by organizations to reach out to potential customers, generate sales, make appointments with salespeople and introduce new products. Inbound telemarketing is where people call the organization to complain or inquire about products. Both outbound and inbound can be used as a customer service strategy to boost sales and receive suggestions for improvement. Advantages of telemarketing include targeted communications, flexible and direct interaction between the organization and the customer, it can be an effective personal selling partner and it is cost effective compared to face-to-face contact. A disadvantage is that call centres are usually used to handle outbound and inbound telemarketing, which need to be implemented, managed and financed.&lt;ref name="Marketing Management"/&gt;

===Mail order===
[[Mail order]] marketing is a catalogue of products that customers can order to receive in the mail. This form of direct marketing dates back over 100 years. Home shopping, online shopping and teleshopping now accompany it. With current technology mail order has improved. Now there can be a larger range in catalogue, delivery is faster, and complaints are dealt with professionally. Mail order exerts less pressure on the customer than telemarketing and sales are easy to manage, however costly infrastructure is required in maintaining the back-end.&lt;ref name="Marketing Management"/&gt;

===Direct-response advertising===
Direct-response advertising is partially direct marketing. It is a message transmitted through traditional communications media that requires the reader, viewer, listener or customer to respond directly to the organization.&lt;ref name="Marketing Management"/&gt; The audience may respond to receive more information or to purchase a product. A common example of direct response advertising is in television "home shopping immediately to receive a particular deal or discount. Disadvantages are that focus can be lost because of the medium of communication and the targeting can be less narrow compared to direct mail. Organizational messages can get cluttered and crowded.&lt;ref name="Marketing Management"/&gt;

====Cellular marketing====
Cellular marketing uses audience's mobile phone and [[short message service|SMS]] to promote a product or brand. Advantages are a high level of flexibility and easy integration through computer systems using the Internet to send mass text messages. This marketing communications platform allows organizations to directly target customers to remind them to renew subscriptions, give exclusive product discounts, or build brand reputation through competitions or sweepstakes. 
The disadvantage is that some customers are charged to receive SMS, so [[opt-in]] permission is required.&lt;ref name="Marketing Management"/&gt;

====CD/DVD technology====
[[CD]] and [[DVD]] discs can be used as part of e-communications. Entire marketing presentations, catalogues, brochures and price lists can be stored on a CD. CDs are small and simple to hand out to target audiences and most modern computers have CD drive readers, however most of the same information can be presented on a website or email.&lt;ref name="Marketing Management"/&gt;

==Integrated marketing communications==
'''Integrated marketing communications''' ('''IMC''') is the use of [[marketing]] strategies to optimise the communication of a consistent message of the company's brands to stakeholders.&lt;ref name=kitchen2015&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kitchen, P., &amp; Burgmann, I.|year=2015|title=Integrated marketing communications: Making it work at a strategic level|journal=Journal of Business Strategy|volume=36|pages=34–39|doi=10.1108/JBS-05-2014-0052}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coupling methods together improves communication as it harnesses the benefits of each channel, which when combined together builds a clearer and vaster impact than if used individually.&lt;ref name=pitta2006&gt;Pitta, D. A., Weisgal, M., &amp; Lynagh, P. (2006). Integrating exhibit marketing into integrated marketing communications. ''Journal of Consumer Marketing'' '', 23'' (3), 156-166.&lt;/ref&gt; IMC requires marketers to identify the boundaries around the promotional mix elements and to consider the effectiveness of the campaign's message.&lt;ref name=dahl2015&gt;Dahl, S., Low, D., &amp; Eagle, L. (2015). Integrating marketing communications and social marketing: Together for a common good? ''Journal of Social Marketing'' '', 5'' (3), 226-240.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid to late 1980s, the marketing environment was undergoing profound environmental changes with implications for marketing communications. Media proliferation, audience fragmentation, globalisation of markets, the advent of new communications technologies, the widespread use of databases meant that the old methods, and practices used in mass marketing were no longer relevant. In particular, the rise of digital and interactive media meant that marketers were relying less on advertising as the dominant form of marketing communications. Amongst practitioners and scholars, there was an increasing recognition that new approaches to marketing communications were required. That new approach would become known as ''integrated marketing communications.''  A number of empirical studies, carried out in the early 1990s, found that the new IMC was far from a "short-lived managerial fad," but rather was a very clear reaction by advertisers and marketers to the changing external environment.

Integrated marketing communications is a holistic planning process that focuses on integrating messages across communications disciplines, creative executions, media, timing and stakeholders. An integrated approach  has emerged as the dominant approach used by companies to plan and execute their marketing communication programs &lt;ref name="cbaweb.sdsu.edu"&gt;Belch, G.E and Belch, M.A., "Evaluating the Effectiveness of Elements of Integrated Marketing Communications: A Review of Research," ''Occasional Paper,'' San Diego State University, 2016 &lt;Online: https://cbaweb.sdsu.edu/assets/files/imc/abstracts/effect-imc.doc&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and has been described as a ''paradigm shift.''&lt;ref&gt;chul, L., Han, D. and Schultz, D., "Understanding the Diffusion of Integrated Marketing Communications," ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' Vol. 44, No. 1, 2004, pp 31-45&lt;/ref&gt;

IMC unifies and coordinates an organization's marketing communications to promote a consistent brand message.&lt;ref&gt;Shimp, T. A. (2010).

===History===
The  impetus to rethink marketing communications came from a number of environmental changes that were becoming increasingly apparent throughout the mid to late 1980s. Media was proliferating and at the same time converging, audiences were fragmenting and many new communications disciplines were emerging. Few advertising agencies provided the full suite of services in terms of the varied communications disciplines. Companies were reliant on a multiplicity of service providers for assistance with advertising, public-relations, branding, packaging, sales promotion, event organisers and other promotional activities. Each of these communications disciplines was treated as a "silo"; with little thought to the synergies between them,with the result that many different stakeholders involved in presenting the company's external image throughout the breadth and length of a campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelissen, J.P., Christensen, L. and Vijn, P., "Understanding the Development and Diffusion of Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC): A Metaphorical Perspective, NRG Working Paper No. 06-02, 2006, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; In that environment, both practitioners and theorists recognised the potential for confusing or inconsistent brand images to develop across media and across different communications disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Ang, L., ''Principles of Integrated Marketing Communications: A Focus on New Technologies and Advanced Theories,'' [Kindle Edition], Cambridge University Press, 2014, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;  The fragmentation of audiences presented marketers with particular challenges. No longer were they able to communicate with mass markets via mass media; instead they needed to communicate with increasingly tightly defined market segments, using highly specialist media and communications disciplines. New media and the use of databases were enabling marketers to communicate with customers on a one-to-one basis.&lt;ref&gt;Kitchen, P.J. and Schultz, D.E. "A Multi-Country Comparison of the Drive for IMC." ''Journal of Advertising Research,''1999, p. 21; Tedlow, R.A. and Jones, G., ''The Rise and Fall of Mass Marketing'', Routledge, N.Y., 1993 Ch 2; Kara, A and Kaynak, E., "Markets of a Single Customer: Exploiting Conceptual Developments in Market Segmentation", ''European Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 31, No. 11/12, 1997, pp. 873–895, DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.1108/03090569710190587&lt;/ref&gt; The old methods and practices associated with mass communications were failing to serve the realities of the new era.&lt;ref&gt;Kliatchko, J.G., "Towards a New Definition of Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC)," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol 24, No. 1, 2005, pp. 7–34.&lt;/ref&gt; The imperative to present a clear, coherent and unified narrative in both internal and external communications was becoming increasingly apparent by the late 1980s.

In 1989, two discrete events served to draw attention to the fact that industry attitudes to marketing communications were shifting. Firstly, the consulting firm, [[Shearson#Shearson Lehman Hutton|Shearson-Lehman Hutton]] published a report on the subject of consumer advertising, signalling that a number of market-place changes would force packaged goods marketers to adopt a more integrated approach to marketing communications. Their report also noted that high-end manufacturers (e.g. automobiles) and up-market services (e.g. cruise vacations) were more inclined to use integrated promotions.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, L.,''Strategic Integrated Marketing Communications,'' Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, pp 5-6;  Kliatchko, J.G., "Towards a New Definition of Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC)," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol 24, No. 1, 2005, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, the [[American Association of Advertising Agencies]] (4A's), instituted a task-force to investigate integrated marketing communications (IMC), with the result that the first official definition was published. The AAAA defined IMC as, "a concept of marketing communications planning that recognizes the added value of a comprehensive plan that evaluates the strategic roles of a variety of communication disciplines (e.g. general advertising, direct response, sales promotion, and public relations) and combines these disciplines to provide clarity, consistency, and maximum communication impact."&lt;ref&gt;Percy, L.,''Strategic Integrated Marketing Communications,'' Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, p. 5; Cornelissen, J.P., Christensen, L. and Vijn, P., "Understanding the Development and Diffusion of Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC): A Metaphorical Perspective, NRG Working Paper No. 06-02, 2006, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; At this stage, the development of IMC, focused primarily on the need for organisations to offer more than just standard [[advertising]] and to integrate the various communications disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Kliatchko, J., "Revisiting the IMC Construct: A Revised Definition and Four Pillars," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol. 27, No. 1, 2008, pp. 138-139&lt;/ref&gt; The 4As originally coined the term the "new advertising"; however, this title did not appropriately incorporate many other aspects included in the term "IMC" – most notably, those beyond traditional advertising process aside from simply advertising.&lt;ref name="dandc"&gt;{{cite book|first=Duncan |last=Tom |first2=Clarke |last2=Caywood |chapter=The Concept, Process and Evolution of Integrated Marketing Communication |title=Integrated Communication: Synergy of Persuasive Voices |editor-last=Esther |editor-first=Thorson |editor-first2=Jeri |editor-last2=Moore |publisher=Psychology Press |year=1996 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Northwestern Arch.jpg|thumb|The Medill School at Northwestern was the first university to teach course in integrated marketing communications]]

In 1991, the faculty of [[Medill School of Journalism]], [[Northwestern University]] in conjunction with the AAAA, began the first empirical research study designed to investigate how IMC was being used.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, D. and Kitchen, P., "Integrated Marketing Communications in US Advertising Agencies: An Exploratory Study," ''Journal of Adaertising Research,'' Vol. 37, no, 5, 1997, pp.7-17&lt;/ref&gt; The study focused around understanding the concept and the importance of IMC and also to analyse the extent in which IMC was practiced in all major U.S advertising agencies. This initial study was then replicated by other studies with a view to examining how IMC was being used in other countries; New Zealand, UK, US, Australia, India, Thailand, South Africa and the Philippines, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Kliatchko, J.G., "Towards a New Definition of Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC)," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol 24, No. 1, 2005, pp. 8-9; Ichul, L., Han, D. and Schultz, D., "Understanding the Diffusion of Integrated Marketing Communications," ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' Vol. 44, No. 1, 2004, pp 31-45&lt;/ref&gt; The findings from these studies demonstrated that the new IMC was far from a "short-lived managerial fad" but rather was "a very clear reaction by advertising agencies and their clients as they are affected by a multitude of factors such as new forms of information technology including development and usage of databases, media fragmentation, client desires for interaction/synergy, and global and regional coordination."&lt;ref&gt;Kitchen, P.J. and Schultz, D.E. "A Multi-Country Comparison of the Drive for IMC." ''Journal of Advertising Research,''Vol. 39, No. 1, 1999, p. 21; Shimp, T.A. ''Advertising Promotion and Other Aspects of Integrated Marketing Communications,'' Cengage, 2008, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; This was the second stage of IMC's development, where the focus shifted to documenting the practice of IMC as a global phenonenon. In other words, researchers were attempting to codify practices that had been used for some time.&lt;ref&gt;Kliatchko, J., "Revisiting the IMC Construct: A Revised Definition and Four Pillars," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol. 27, No. 1, 2008, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, [[Don E. Schultz|Don Schultz]] and his team published the first text-book dedicated to IMC.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, D. E., Tannenbaum, S.I. and Lauterborn, R.F., ''Integrated Marketing Communications: Putting it together and making it work, '' Lincolnwood, Ill., NTC Business Books, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Their work, simply entitled, ''Integrated Marketing Communications,'' described IMC as a totally new way of looking at the whole of marketing communications, rather than looking at each of the parts separately. And, in the same year, the Medill School at Northwestern University changed their curriculum to include a focus on this new idea of integrated marketing communications rather than the traditional program which had emphasised advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, L.,''Strategic Integrated Marketing Communications,'' Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, pp 6-7&lt;/ref&gt; IMC emerged from an "academic department that, for several decades, had been recognized as the number one advertising program.&lt;ref&gt;Caywood,C., ''The Handbook of Strategic Public Relations and Integrated Marketing Communications,''Chicago, Ill., McGraw-Hill, 2012;&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-1990s, virtually every text-book on the subject of marketing communications has adopted an integrated perspective or has added chapters on IMC in new editions of standard works.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, F., Patti, C. and Ichul, K., "An Inside-out Approach to Integrated Mmarketing Communications: An International Perspective," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol. 27, No.4, 2008, pp 531-34; Finne, A. and Gronroos, C., "Rethinking Marketing Communications: From Integrated Marketing Communications to Relationship Communicatios," in ''The Evolution of Integrated Marketing Communications: The Customer-driven Marketplace,'' Don Schultz (ed), Routledge, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Collectively these books focus on the IMC planning processes and this represents the third distinct stage in the evolution of IMC – an emphasis on managing and organising IMC.&lt;ref&gt;Kliatchko, J., "Revisiting the IMC Construct: A Revised Definition and Four Pillars," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol. 27, No. 1, 2008, pp. 140-141&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, scholars have advanced different definitions of IMC, with each definition exhibiting a slightly different emphasis. Yet, in spite of the variety of definitions in circulation, there is general consensus that integrated marketing communications should be viewed as a planning process.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, L.,''Strategic Integrated Marketing Communications,'' Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have pointed out that because IMC is both a process and a concept, it is exceedingly difficult to define.&lt;ref&gt;Kliatchko, J.G., "Towards a New Definition of Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC)," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol 24, No. 1, 2005, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the key definitions that have been advanced during IMC's evolution are outlined here:

* "IMC is the process of all sources and information managed so a consumer or prospect is exposed which behaviorally moves the customer more towards a sale."  (Schultz, 1991)&lt;ref&gt;Don Schultz (1991) quoted in Kliatchko, J.G., "Towards a New Definition of Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC)," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol 24, No. 1, 2005, pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

* "The strategic co-ordination of all messages and media used by an organisation to influence its perceived brand value." (Duncan and Everett, 1993) &lt;ref&gt;Cited in: Percy, L.,''Strategic Integrated Marketing Communications,'' Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, p.7 &lt;/ref&gt;

* "The process of strategically controlling or influencing all messages and encoring purposeful dialogue to created and nourish profitable relationships with consumers and other stakeholders." (Duncan &amp; Caywood, 1996)&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, T. and Caywood, C., "The concept, process, and evolution of integrated marketing communications, in Thorson, E. and Moore, J. (eds), ''Integrated Communication: Synergy of Persuasion Voices, Mahwah, NJ, Lawrence Erlbaum, 1996, pp. 13-34&lt;/ref&gt;

* "[A three-pronged definition] One-voice marketing communications is integration that creates a clear and consistent image, position, message, and/or theme across all marketing communication disciplines or tools. Integrated communications refers to the creation of both a brand image and a behavioural response that emanate directly from marketing communications materials such as advertisements. Coordinated marketing communications associates 'integrated' with the concept of 'coordination'.  (Nowak &amp; Phelps, 1994)&lt;ref&gt;Nowak and Phelps (1994)quoted in Kliatchko, J.G., "Towards a New Definition of Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC)," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol 24, No. 1, 2005, pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

* "IMC is a strategic business process used to plan, develop, execute and evaluate coordinate measurable persuasive brand communication programs over time with consumers, customers and prospects, and other that are targeted, relevant internal and external audiences." (Schultz &amp; Schultz, 1998)&lt;ref&gt;Schultz &amp; Schultz, 1998 quoted in Kliatchko, J.G., "Towards a New Definition of Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC)," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol 24, No. 1, 2005, pp. 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

* "IMC is the concept and process of strategically managing audience-focused,channel-centred, and results-driven brand communication programmes over time." (Kliatchko, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Kliatchko, J.G., "Towards a New Definition of Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC)," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol 24, No. 1, 2005, p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

* "An IMC program plans and executes various marketing activities with consistency so that its total impact exceeds the sum of each activity. It is a strategy in which different communication tools like advertising, public relations, sales promotion, direct marketing and personal selling work together to maximize the communication impact on target consumers." (Saeed et al., 2013)&lt;ref&gt;Saeed, R., Naeem, B., Bilal, M. and Naz, U., "Integrated Marketing Communication: A Review Paper," ''Interdisciplinary Journal of Contemporary Research in Business,'' Vol. 5, No, 5, 2013, pp 124-133&lt;/ref&gt;

* "IMC is the planning and execution of all types of advertising-like and promotion-like messages selected for a brand, service, or company, in order to meet a common set of communication objectives, or more particularly, to support a single ‘ positioning’." (Larry Percy, 2008)&lt;ref&gt;Percy, L.,''Strategic Integrated Marketing Communications,'' Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, there is general agreement amongst both practitioners and scholars that the emergence of IMC represents "a significant example of development in the marketing discipline... [that] has influenced thinking and acting among all types of companies and organizations facing the realities of competition in an open economy."&lt;ref&gt;Holm, O. "Integrated marketing communication: From Tactics to Strategy", ''Corporate Communications: An International Journal,'' Vol. 11, No. 1, 2006, pp.23-33, https://doi.org/10.1108/13563280610643525&lt;/ref&gt; Belch and Belch argue that IMC has become the dominant approach used by companies to plan and execute their marketing communication programs&lt;ref&gt;Belch, G.E and Belch, M.A., "Evaluating the Effectiveness of Elements of Integrated Marketing Communications: A Review of Research," ''Occasional Paper,'' San Diego State University, 2016 &lt;Online: https://cbaweb.sdsu.edu/assets/files/imc/abstracts/effect-imc.doc&gt; p. 2 &lt;Online: cbaweb.sdsu.edu&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; while other scholars have described IMC as a ''paradigm shift.''&lt;ref&gt;Ichul, L., Han, D. and Schultz, D., "Understanding the Diffusion of Integrated Marketing Communications," ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' Vol. 44, No. 1, 2004, pp 31-45&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Percy argues that "the planning and execution of ''all'' marketing communication should be ''integrated''".&lt;ref&gt;Percy, L., ''Strategic Integrated Marketing Communications,'' Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, p.14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meaning of integration===
[[File:Imaginative advertising on Brockenhurst Station - geograph.org.uk - 170785.jpg|thumb|Integrating the creative and the media can result in imaginative and powerful messages that grab attention and are noticed]]

Within the literature there is no absolute agreement about the meaning of "integration" in the concept, "integrated marketing communications".  The concept of IMC has evolved during its brief history, and with that different ideas around the meaning of integration have been advanced.&lt;ref&gt;Kliatchko, J., "Revisiting the IMC Construct: A Revised Definition and Four Pillars," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol. 27, No. 1, 2008, pp. 133–160&lt;/ref&gt; The diverse views surrounding IMC and its meaning can be explained by the early state of theoretical development and research on IMC which gives rise to a mulplicity of different perspectives. As the discipline matures, these different views are expected to converge.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelissen, J.P., Christensen, L. and Vijn, P., "Understanding the Development and Diffusion of Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC): A Metaphorical Perspective,'' ''NRG Working Paper'' No. 06-02, 2006, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The marketing and advertising literature identifies many different types of integration:

====Functional integration====
Functional integration refers to the capacity of the different promotional tools to complement each other and deliver a unified, coherent message. Each of the communications disciplines (advertising, PR, personal selling, sales promotion etc.) has its own strengths and weaknesses. For instance, it is generally recognised that straight advertising is very effective at creating [[brand awareness]], but much less effective at converting awareness into actual sales.&lt;ref&gt;O'Guinn, T., Allen,C., and Semenik, R.J., ''Advertising and Integrated Brand Promotion,'' Mason, Ohio, South-Western Cengage, 2009, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; As consumers approach the actual purchase, they may turn to other types of promotion such as [[personal selling]] or direct [[marketing]].  A carefully planned communications program will include a blend of tools in a way that the messages move the customer through the various stages of the [[consumer behaviour|purchase decision]] – from need recognition through to purchase and post-purchase stages. Integrating the communications disciplines addresses the question of how the strengths of one discipline can be used to overcome the weaknesses of a different discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Mudzanani, T., "A Review and Analysis of the Role of Integrated Marketing Communication Message Typology in the Development of Communication Strategies," '' African Journal of Marketing Management'' , Vol. 7, no 8, 2015, pp. 90-97; Ang, L., ''Principles of Integrated Marketing Communications: A Focus on New Technologies and Advanced Theories,'' Cambridge University Press, 2014, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

====Message integration====
Message integration is also known as ''image integration'' or ''creative integration''. A key task for IMC is ensuring consistency in executions within and across the different types of marketing communications, as well as over time. Everything connected with an IMC campaign should have a similar 'look and feel', irrespective of the medium or tool. Message integration does not imply that messages need to identical. Rather it means that every piece of promotion – from advertising to direct mail to collateral materials to packaging to posters to corporate vehicles to business cards and office stationery – should be immediately recognisable as part of the same livery.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, L., ''Strategic Integrated Marketing Communications,'' Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, pp 202-205&lt;/ref&gt;

Clearly, media releases which are often part of a PR program are very different to persuasive messages used in advertising.  However, messages should include a similar tone and at least some common elements so that each message looks like it is part of a coherent, integrated campaign. Every execution is part of the brand's identity. Consistent executions facilitate brand awareness. People associate the 'look' of the brand's marketing communication with the brand itself. Consistent executions are more of a 'feeling' that ties everything together; a unique look or feel so that the target audience recognizes a brand's marketing communication even before they see the brand name. The key to consistency is the visual feel. This is because the visual memory for the imagery associated with the brand actually elicits faster brand identification than the brand name itself.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, L., ''Strategic Integrated Marketing Communications,'' Oxford, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, pp 202-205; Mudzanani, T., "A review and analysis of the role of integrated marketing communication message typology in the development of communication strategies," '' African Journal of Marketing Management'' , Vol. 7, no 8, 2015, pp. 90-97&lt;/ref&gt;

====Media integration====
Much IMC planning is concerned with co-ordinating different media channels to optimize the effectiveness of marketing communications programmes. If brand communications "reflect implied brand values and imagery that  are consistent throughout differing media channels, then clearly these  channels act in a mutually reinforcing way with each successive consumer engagement."&lt;ref&gt;Hackley, C., ''Advertising and Promotion,'' Sage, 2005, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Certain messages may not translate into other media. For instance, messages containing 'sex appeals' may work well on TV because movement lends itself to eroticism, but may become "flat" in a static medium such as print. In such cases it is important that the secondary media support the primary media and that messages harmonise.&lt;ref name="Ang, L. 2014"&gt;Ang, L., ''Principles of Integrated Marketing Communications: A Focus on New Technologies and Advanced Theories,'' Cambridge University Press, 2014, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Research studies suggest that consumers learn more quickly when exposed to messages via different media. The explanation for this is that slight variations in execution create a slight mental perturbation which grabs attention, and results in more elaborate encoding of the main message argument. By exposing consumers to the same message through multiple media, there are more opportunities to engage with consumers. In short, a multi media strategy is more effective.&lt;ref name="Ang, L. 2014"/&gt;

====Integration of timing====
Integration of timing refers to the timing messages so that they operate to support each other and reach potential customers at different junctures, depending on when they are most receptive to different types of message or depending on the consumer's readiness to buy.&lt;ref name="Ang, L. 2014"/&gt;

====Other types of integration====
Other types of integration include:&lt;ref&gt;Mudzanani, T., "A review and analysis of the role of integrated marketing communication message typology in the development of communication strategies," '' African Journal of Marketing Management'' , Vol. 7, no 8, 2015, pp. 90-97&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''Coordinated integration''' refers to the ways that different internal and external agencies (e.g web designers, advertising agencies, PR consultants, graphic designers) coordinate to provide a consistent message.  
:'''Stakeholder integration''' refers to the way that all stakeholders (e.g. employees, suppliers, customers and others) cooperate to communicate a shared understanding of the company's key messages and values. 
:'''Relationship integration''' refers to the way that communications professionals (e.g. marketing managers, advertising managers) contribute to the company's overall corporate goals and quality management.

===Criticisms===
Both practitioners and scholars agree that IMC makes practical "good sense".&lt;ref&gt;Pettigrew, L.S., "If IMC is so Good, Why Isn't Being Implemented: Barriers to IMC Adoption in Corporate America," ''Journal of Integrated Communication,'' 2000-2001, pp 29-37; Cornelissen, J.P., Christensen, L. and Vijn, P., "Understanding the Development and Diffusion of Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC): A Metaphorical Perspective,'' ''NRG Working Paper'' No. 06-02, 2006, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the discipline has relatively few critics. Nevertheless, researchers have pointed to areas that are in need of further research, and highlight some of the discipline's deficiencies:

*Some practitioners and scholars argue that IMC is not new. Skeptics point out that the more experienced commmunicationsd managers, especially national brand managers, have always practised integration.&lt;ref&gt;Shimp, T.A. ''Advertising Promotion and Other Aspects of Integrated Marketing Communications,'' Cengage, 2008, p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

*A more serious criticism of IMC concerns the problem of measurement. The value of IMC activities has proved very difficult to measure due to the interactions of different communications tools.&lt;ref name="cbaweb.sdsu.edu"/&gt;  A growing number of scholars agree that the lack of rigorous measurement metrics and methods represents a major challenge for the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Ewing, M.T. "Integrated Marketing Communications Measurement and Evaluation," ''Journal of Marketing Communications,'' Vol.15, No. 2-3, 2009, pp 103-117&lt;/ref&gt;

*Studies have shown that, while managers are familiar with the IMC concept in theory, it is not widely practiced.  Such findings suggest that IMC is easy to understand, but difficult to do. One possible explanation for the slow uptake is that organisational barriers to implementation may have become entrenched and are difficult to overcome.&lt;ref&gt;Pettigrew, L.S., "If IMC is so Good, Why Isn't Being Implemented: Barriers to IMC Adoption in Corporate America," ''Journal of Integrated Communication,'' 2000-2001, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; A number of organisational characteristics have been cited as possible barriers to implementation. These factors include: a mind-set that has been built up over the years which promotes specialisation rather than integration; organisational structure which has been designed to manage specialisms (e.g. advertising, PR as separate branches); manager ability and lack of skills in integration; agency remuneration systems and the adequacy of budgets.&lt;ref&gt;Pickton,A. and Broderick, D., ''Integrated Marketing Communications,'' 2nd ed., Pearson, Essex, England, 2005, pp 35-39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marketing communications framework===
The '''marketing communications planning framework''' ('''MCPF''') is a model for the creation of an ICM [[communication planning|plan]]. Created by Chris Fill,&lt;ref&gt;Fill, C. (2013) Marketing Communications, 6th edn, Harlow: Pearsons.&lt;/ref&gt; senior examiner for the [[Chartered Institute of Marketing]], the MCPF is intended to solve the inadequacies of other frameworks.

[[File:marketing-communications-planning-framework.gif]]

=== Integrated Marketing Communications planning approaches===
====Inside–out approach====
An  “inside-out”  approach is the traditional planning approach to marketing  communication. Planning begins "inside" the organisation by identifying the goals and objectives which are often based around what has always been done. Communication's task then becomes a process of "selling" the organisation's message to the "outside" or external stakeholders. .&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, F., Patti, C. and Ichul, K., "An Inside-out Approach to Integrated Marketing Communications: An International Perspective," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol. 27, No.4, 2008, pp 531-540&lt;/ref&gt;

The inside–out approach to integrated marketing communications has been criticised as a one sided view point, since it combines the elements of communication and marketing to create a single unified message. Porcu and his team point out that many of the first, tentative attempts to practice IMC were primarily concerned with integrating the message, so that to organisation appeared to speak with "one voice,"  but failed to adopt a more rounded customer orientation. The inside–out approach is weak due to the stagnant, outdated method.&lt;ref name="Porcu, L. 2012, pp 313-348"&gt;Porcu, L., del Barrio-Garcia, S., and Kitchen, P.J., "How Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) works? A theoretical review and an analysis of its main drivers and effects/ ¿Cómo funciona la Comunicación Integrada de Marketing (CIM)? Una revisión teórica y un análisis de sus antecedentes y efectos," ''COMUNICACIÓN Y SOCIEDAD,'' Vol. XXV, Núm. 1, 2012, pp 313-348&lt;/ref&gt;

====Outside–in approach====
The outside–in approach of integrated marketing communications seeks to understand the needs and wants of the consumer.&lt;ref name="Porcu, L. 2012, pp 313-348"/&gt; In addition to the previous category, this approach establishes significant progression. Organisations can gain in-depth knowledge based on consumers and therefore can accommodate the way they approach to fulfil their requirements. Relationship marketing aids in building up a history of frequent conversation between organisations and stakeholders which contributes to trust.&lt;ref&gt;Gambetti, R. C. and Schultz, D. E., "Reshaping the Boundaries of Marketing Communication to Bond with Consumers," ''Journal of Marketing Communications,'' Vol 21, No. 1, 2015 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Communication builds rapport that could prove to be profitable as they retain clientele. The outside-in approach offers a unique way to planning, as it operates backwards by concentrating on customers first, then determining the most effective course of marketing and communication methods to implement. Effectively managing the strategic business process is crucial as it defines the steps to follow which ensure brand value is upheld.

====Cross-functional planning approach====
Cross-functional planning approach of integrated marketing communications diverges away from the other two categories, it does not centre around the concept of marketing promotional elements, instead the focus has shifted toward restructuring the organisation to increase a customer-centric environment. This approach recognises that messages do not just come from the marketing department, but can come from virtually any department within the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Porcu, L., del Barrio-Garcia, S., and Kitchen, P.J., "How Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) works? A theoretical review and an analysis of its main drivers and effects," ''COMUNICACIÓN Y SOCIEDAD,'' Vol. XXV, Núm. 1, 2012, especially see pp 323-325&lt;/ref&gt; Investing for the reorganisation sparks change where all departments interconnect to work cohesively toward managing and planning all stages of brand relationship. As a unified organisation, the cross-functional process is a competitive advantage as they can achieve profitable relationships with customers and stakeholders. This can be achieved through improving the relation amongst messages sent from all departments through channels to the receivers. By sending strategic messages and monitoring any external reaction, organisations gain feedback data from consumers which can be used to inform subsequent planning or fine-tuning of the communications strategy. The process is circular, not linear,&lt;ref&gt;Porcu, L., del Barrio-Garcia, S., and Kitchen, P.J., "How Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) works? A theoretical review and an analysis of its main drivers and effects," ''COMUNICACIÓN Y SOCIEDAD,'' Vol. XXV, Núm. 1, 2012, p. 323-325&lt;/ref&gt; at the beginning organisation and consumer communicate by interacting and dialogue which ignites the relationship, over time trust is earned and the consumer may continue to purchase, which in turn increases sales and profitability for the organisation and finally, the relationship is strong and the organisation retains clientele.&lt;ref name=dahl2015/&gt; Interactive communication is advantageous for a cross-functional approach as the business and consumer are both involved in brand communication.&lt;ref name=Valos16&gt;Valos, M. J., Habibi, F. H., Casidy, R., Driesener, C. B. and Maplestone, V. L., "Exploring the Integration of Social Media within Integrated Marketing Communication Frameworks: Perspectives of Services Marketers," ''Journal of Marketing Practice,'' Vol. 34, no. 1, pp 19-40.&lt;/ref&gt; Implementing IMC is a flexible process due to the changing nature of the marketing dynamics therefore by eliminating borders within the organisation it allows for this notion.

===Barriers to implementation===
The barriers to implementation have been cited as one of the main reasons for the failure to adopt holistic approaches to IMC.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, F., Patti, C. and Ichul, K., "An Inside-out Approach to Integrated Mmarketing Communications: An International Perspective," ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol. 27, No.4, 2008, pp 531-34&lt;/ref&gt; The key barriers cited in the literature are:

'''No support from senior management'''

It is vital for an organisation who implements integrated marketing communications to have the commitment from all levels of employees, including senior management.&lt;ref name=kitchen2015/&gt; The union between both marketing and corporate goals should coincide and support simultaneously. The lack of involvement from senior management could lead to IMC being deprived of resources which prevents the full potential IMC can deliver for the organisation to benefit from.&lt;ref name=Valos16/&gt; Higher levels of the business need to coincide with the efforts of staff in the strategic planning to grasp that IMC's programme is valuable.

'''Clients are confused about the concept'''

Some companies such as advertising agencies could possibly take advantage of the integrated marketing communications model, due to the stress they receive from clients and budgets being reduced.&lt;ref name=kitchen2015/&gt; The introduction of new technology broadens the boundaries for advertising elements to endeavour with such avenues like the internet. Their focus may stray from the core principles of IMC which is to integrate the elements together, as they're less effective individually.  Also, their clients may not grasp the IMC concept as an essential attribute, therefore, they perceive IMC as saving money due to the strategic juxtaposition.

'''Organisation is too specialised'''

One of the core fundamentals of integrated marketing communications is that of the focus aspires toward a customer orientation.&lt;ref name=kitchen2015/&gt; In spite of that, the purpose of some organisations have not adopted the framework and are still task orientated. Examples include public relations, direct marketing and advertising.

'''Conflict within organisation'''

Trying to implement integrated marketing communications into strong hierarchy structured organisations may cause staff resistance due to the nature of horizontal communication causing disagreements amongst staff.&lt;ref name=kitchen2015/&gt; Staff may not perform their tasks and functions which jeopardises the work environment. For IMC to be successful the culture of the organisation needs to accommodate an open perspective where communication amongst the varying departments are managed tactically.&lt;ref name=likethis&gt;Valos, M. J., Habibi, F. H., Casidy, R., Driesener, C. B., &amp; Maplestone, V. L. (2016). Exploring the integration of social media within integrated marketing communication frameworks: Perspectives of services marketers. Journal of Marketing Practice , 34 (1), 19-40&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals reactions toward the new restructure will differ,  as some become custom to the process and enjoy the borderless integration, on the other hand, some may feel threatened from the absence of control that once maintained order and power within the previous structured organisation (Vladmir, Miroslav, &amp; Papic, 2012). A corporate structure may not necessarily invite IMC due to their culture being incompatible for the integration.

====Removing barriers====
Integrated marketing communication is the process of communicating an idea in order to attract customers using an array of tools. It is the process of sending out a message to a receiver (Communications, 2016). Depending on the company values and the type of product or service they offer, the most appropriate message to deliver will depend on the brand and consumer. To understand how integrated marketing communication can benefit a business, three main areas will be discussed. These areas being who the Sender is? Who is the Receiver? And what tools can the sender use in order to pass a message on to the receiver?

Practical solutions towards improving marketing strategies by using ICM can be done through two differing marketing concepts the [[four P's]] or the [[four C's]] . Also, the uses of encoding and decoding should be followed, all of which intertwine to form growth in sales financially for a business.

A sender is someone who is aiming to communicate an idea to a receiver, which might be an individual or a group. Marketers must first understand who the receive is in order to successfully implement marketing communications. For example, [[Staples Inc.|Staples]] seeks to identify itself as a 'one-stop' shop for all office needs. It advertises a wide variety of office supplies, safe and on time delivery, competitive pricing and excellent customer service. Staples focuses its marketing efforts on advertising those values.  Their slogan "To make more happen, everyday". This theme is the most appropriate because it attracts their target audience. Workers have little time on their hands, the product they offer will give them the ability to make life easier; by doing so, they save time. In today's fast-paced lifestyle, if a service is convenient, customers will most likely use the product. Staples have successfully taken the necessary steps in order to communicate their values to their customers. They have done this through understanding who they are and who they should be targeting.

==4C's==
Originally, marketing was focused around the [[4P's]] (product, price, place and promotion) which concentrated on companies' internal concepts. The idea of integrated marketing communications was first raised in 1993 by [[Don E. Schultz]], who changed the 4P's concept into the 4C's model. The four parts include consumer, communication, convenience and cost, taking into consideration the needs and wants of consumers. Integrated marketing communications accomplished synergy when each element was executed in accordance with the overall vision of the organisation's campaign, which allows the message to be executed efficiently.&lt;ref name=dahl2015/&gt; Finding out who the target market is to answer the 4C's: knowing what products they're willing to purchase, the amount of money they are willing to spend for it, how the product will fulfil their needs and wants, the accessibility of the product and how easily correct information is transmitted.&lt;ref&gt;Nagra, G. K., Kumari, S., Gopal, R., &amp; Manjrekar, P. (2012). Impact of Integrated Marketing Communication on different customer segments, effects on consumer decision making process. ''International Journal of Applied Services Marketing Perspectives'' '', 1'' (1), 56-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Changing the emphasis onto what consumers desire leads to a higher success being attained through IMC, as it is being influenced by not only internal stakeholders but also external ones.

==Communication-based relationship marketing==
Expanding from this, Tom Duncan and Sandra E. Moriarty formed the concept of communication-based relationship marketing. This model diverged from the concept of the general one way, business influencing consumers what to believe scenario.&lt;ref&gt;Lucia, P., del Barrio-Garcia, S., &amp; Kitchen, P. J. (2012). How Integrated Marketing Communications works? A theoretical review and analysis of its main drivers and effects. ''Journal of Marketing Communications'' '', 25'' (1), 313-348. &lt;/ref&gt; However, Duncan and Moriarty argued that communication between business and consumers was the key to developing strong establishment for consumer orientated marketing endeavours. The process of IMC through communication-based marketing goes through a sequential three stage process. Organisations begin with choosing an effective mixture of communication methods; then, the marketing methods are selected; thereafter, the best of each element is fused and integrated together which thence is channelled from the organisation to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Vladmir, M., Miroslav, K., &amp; Papic, T. (2012). The necessity to adjust traditional integrated marketing communications tools and techniques to new global trends. ''Journal of Marketing Communications'' '', 61'' (4), 141-154.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, these findings shaped modern marketing, focusing on an interactive two-way approach that builds rapport with stakeholders. Developments from integrated marketing communications have evolved into three categories: inside-out approach, outside-in approach and cross-functional strategic approach.

==Branding==
{{main|Brand management}}
Branding goes beyond having a logo; it is how businesses communicate on behalf of their company, verbally and visually. A brand is a conversation {{em dash}} it is how people talk about your company when you are not in the room.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Consumers are constantly interacting and meeting with brands. This can be through television or other media advertisements such as event sponsorships, personal selling and product packaging. Brand exposure such as this is known as a brand touch point or brand contact whereby the organization  can try impressing its consumer. Without branding, consumers wouldn't be able to decipher between products and decide which one they like most. People may not be able to even tell the differences between some of the brands, they would have to try each brand several times before being able to judge which one was best. In order to help with purchase decisions, marketing communications try to create a distinct image for the brand. Brand associations are made to encourage linkages with places, personalities or even emotions which creates a sophisticated brand personality in the minds of the consumers. This shows how brand communications add value to products&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and why branding is a crucial aspect to the communication platform.

==Focus==
Marketing communications are focused on the product/service as opposed to corporate communications where the focus of communications work is the company/enterprise itself. Marketing communications are primarily concerned with demand generation and product/service positioning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://inevitablesteps.com/marketing/marketing-communication-mix/ |title=Marketing Communication Mix: Promote Effectively |date=June 12, 2015 |publisher=Inevitable Steps |accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while corporate communications deal with issue management, mergers and acquisitions, litigation, etc.

==Customer-focused versus customer-centric==
A recent revelation in integrated marketing communication is the change in the role of the customer within the business world. Due to the fast-paced growth of technology, customers are rapidly gaining more power through forums such as word of mouth; now with capabilities of reaching a much wider audience through the use of social media. Recognizing this power shift, organizations have begun to re-evaluate their typical marketing strategies and customer approaches from the traditional customer-focused attitude to the wide-spreading customer-centric method in order to develop a more integrated strategy.

A customer-focused approach can be defined as "when an organization learns more about the habits of the customer so that they can identify opportunities for [[cross-selling]] etc" (Laurie &amp; Mortimer, 2011). While this type of approach can be viewed as entirely satisfactory, Kliatchko (2008) introduced a contrasting concept which concentrates on "working from the outside in" and promotes a different perspective on organizations. When an organization adopts a customer-centric technique, they forgo the view that customers are only passive receivers of marketing techniques and focus on listening to what their needs are and striving to satisfy them; integrating the customer into the process (Laurie &amp; Mortimer, 2011). Many organizations are yet to relinquish such control, as shown by research conducted by ''Campaign'' magazine, which can only be suspected to be due to the fear that it could potentially diminish the marketing profession (Laurie &amp; Mortimer, 2011). This view, however, is rebutted by Saihtiri et al. (2014) who claims that "achieving superiority in customer-centric performance is then rewarded through stronger brand performance in the marketplace".

'''Narcisa Buencamino-de León''' (October 29, 1877 – February 6, 1966) was a [[Philippines|Filipino]] [[film]] [[film producer|producer]].

Clad daily in the frugal rural dress of the ''camisón'', ''saya'' and [[Slipper|chinelas]],&lt;ref name="dns"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mercado |first=Monina |title= Doña Sisang and Filipino Movies|year= 1977|publisher= Vera-Reyes, Inc.|location= Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Doña Sisang''', as she was widely known, was already a 61-year-old widow when she entered the film industry. Nonetheless, she chartered her family-owned [[LVN Pictures]] into a dominant position in post-World War II [[Cinema of the Philippines|Philippine cinema]]. In addition, de Leon was one of the most highly regarded Filipino businesswomen of the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="dns" /&gt;

Her grandson, [[Mike de Leon]], emerged as a highly acclaimed film director beginning in the 1970s. His 1977 film ''[[Kung Mangarap Ka't Magising]]'' was dedicated to his late grandmother on the occasion of her birth [[centenary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kabayancentral.com/video/mdeleon.html|title=Mike de Leon|date=May 14, 2006|work=|publisher=Kabayan Central|accessdate=November 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[Image:San Miguel 000.JPG|thumb|left|'''Family home''' of Doña Sisang in [[San Miguel, Bulacan]]]]

She was born Narcisa Buencamino in [[San Miguel, Bulacan]] at October 1877, the daughter of a poet and the granddaughter of a Chinese merchant.&lt;ref name=dns /&gt; Her father died when she was five,&lt;ref name=fil1&gt;{{cite book|title=Filipinos in History Vol. III|year=1996|publisher=National Historical Institute|location=Philippines|pages=68–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she was later forced to stop schooling after the fourth grade to work for a living.&lt;ref name=dns /&gt; In her teens, she was working odd jobs as a cook and a seamstress, and she would eventually enter the business of making umbrellas.&lt;ref name=fil1 /&gt; 

In 1904, she married José de León, a local government official in San Miguel, with whom she would have five children. The family settled in San Miguel, Bulacan.

==Businesswoman==

The de León couple ventured into the rice production business, and soon would be recognized as among the leading rice producers in Luzon.&lt;ref name=dns /&gt; By the 1920s, the couple would own several high-valued real properties in [[Bulacan]], [[Manila]], and other prime locations within [[Luzon]].&lt;ref name=fil1 /&gt; They also engaged in [[Philanthropy|philanthropic]] activities and donated a hospital to their hometown of San Miguel. 

De León was widowed in 1934. She moved her family to Manila, took charge of the family business, and refocused it towards real estate.&lt;ref name=dns /&gt; It was said that the business soared to new heights when she took full control after her husband's death.&lt;ref name=fil1 /&gt; She would also become the first woman appointed to the board of directors of a government corporation when she was named by [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Manuel Quezon]] to the board of the National Rice and Corn Corporation.&lt;ref name=dns /&gt;

In the 1950s, De León would be among the organizing shareholders of Republic Cement Corporation, which soon became among the leading [[cement]] producers in the country.&lt;ref name=dns /&gt;

==LVN Pictures==
{{see also|LVN Pictures}}

After her husband's death, de León was urged by her brother and some friends to invest in the Filipino film industry.&lt;ref name=fil1 /&gt; She agreed, and in 1938, her family, along with the Villongco and Navoa families, contributed capital to establish a film studio. The company was named [[LVN Pictures]], the name taken from the respective initials of the three founding families.&lt;ref name=mb&gt;{{cite web|last=Belen |first=Crispina |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=LVN Studios closes shop! |work=Celebrity World |publisher=Manila Bulletin |date=July 7, 2005 |url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2005/07/07/ENTR2005070738818.html |accessdate=November 22, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312225330/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2005/07/07/ENTR2005070738818.html |archivedate=March 12, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from de Leon, the two other principal founding partners of LVN Pictures were Carmen Villongco and Eleuterio Navoa Sr.&lt;ref name=ag&gt;{{cite web| last =Ambrocio| first =Royce| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Film History Comes to Life at LVN Museum| work =| publisher =Articles Gratuits.com| date =April 15, 2006| url =http://www.en.articlesgratuits.com/film-history-comes-to-life-at-lvn-museum-id413.php| accessdate =November 22, 2007| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20071218142803/http://www.en.articlesgratuits.com/film-history-comes-to-life-at-lvn-museum-id413.php| archive-date =December 18, 2007| dead-url =yes| df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LVN broke into the Philippine film industry with the successful release of its first feature, [[Carlos Vander Tolosa|Carlos Vander Tolosa's]] musical ''[[Giliw Ko]]'', released in 1939. De León was elected president of LVN Pictures in 1940,&lt;ref name=fil1 /&gt; and she eventually bought out the shares of her other partners, gaining full control over the studio.&lt;ref name=mb/&gt; ''Giliw Ko'' was followed with another successful film, [[Manuel Conde|Manuel Conde's]] ''Ibong Adarna'' (1941), which featured the first color sequence in a Filipino film and was the first local film to earn more than a million [[Philippine peso|pesos]].&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, J. "A Movie Quizbook", page 136&lt;/ref&gt; However, LVN Pictures was forced to close shop upon the Japanese invasion of the Philippines in December 1941.&lt;ref name=ag/&gt; It resumed operations after the Liberation of Manila in 1945, and produced the first post-war Filipino movie, ''Orasang Ginto'' (1946). In 1949, LVN produced the first full-color Filipino feature film, ''Batalyon XIII''. Dissatisfied by the color-processing of that film, De León bought her own color laboratory for LVN.&lt;ref name=dns /&gt; LVN Pictures saw the peak of its success in the decade following the war, hosting a stable of the most prominent film stars who had joined its studios such as [[Rogelio de la Rosa]]. In addition to producing commercially successful films, LVN also featured critically acclaimed prestige films such as [[Lamberto Avellana|Lamberto Avellana's]] ''[[Child of Sorrow (film)|Anak Dalita]]'' (1956), which was named Best Film at the 1956 Asia-Pacific Film Festival. In the late 1950s, LVN capitalized on the unexpected stardom of one of its contract players, the singer [[Diomedes Maturan]] who emerged as the top box-office draw of 1958–1959.

===Thematic influence on LVN films===

During her years at the helm of LVN Pictures, de León retained absolute control over the operations of the studio and of the films it produced. She personally read and approved the final scripts prior to production,&lt;ref name=dns /&gt; later with the assistance of her son Manuel.&lt;ref name=dns /&gt; Her personal tastes dictated the themes of LVN films. Reflecting her upbringing and age, she was partial to rural romances and stories based on the traditional forms of [[Awit (poem)|awit]] and [[corrido]],&lt;ref name=dns /&gt; and populated her movies with Philippine [[folk dance]]s.&lt;ref name=dns /&gt; She resisted copying Hollywood trends and insisted on injecting Filipino culture into LVN films.&lt;ref name=dns /&gt;

Devoutly [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], she demanded that each of LVN's films contain a moral lesson.&lt;ref name=asia/&gt; She disallowed [[Sex in film|sex scenes]] and permitted only [[Scene (film)#Love scene|love scenes]] that featured no more than a peck on the cheek.&lt;ref name=dns /&gt;

Her idiosyncrasies aside, de Leon used the phrase "''Kung ano ang kikita''" ("Whatever makes money") to justify the choices of scripts LVN adapted into film.&lt;ref name=dns /&gt; As a result, she resisted making "prestige films" that delved into socially conscious issues. She was hesitant to produce [[Lamberto Avellana|Avellana's]] bleak drama ''Anak Dalita'', and only did so at the insistence of her son, Manuel.&lt;ref name=dns /&gt; The film earned poorly, but received several international awards which failed to mollify de Leon. She told her son, "''Ano ngayon ang gagawin ninyo sa mga kopang iyan? Makakain ninyo ba iyan?''" ("What will you do with all those trophies? Can you be fed with those?")&lt;ref name=dns /&gt;

===Star maker===
[[Image:Mila del Sol.jpg|thumb|right|'''[[Mila del Sol]]''' rose to stardom after being cast by Doña Sisang in ''[[Giliw Ko]]'', LVN Pictures' first production]]

De León was known for her acumen in selecting and cultivating stars. This was manifested early on in the casting of the very first LVN film, ''Giliw Ko''. De Leon was instrumental in the casting of the then-unknown [[Mila del Sol]] in a romantic leading role, over the objection of director Vander Tolosa who felt that the 12-year-old actress was too young for the part.&lt;ref name=asia&gt;{{cite web| last = Paras| first = Wilhelmina| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =RETURN OF A GOLDEN OLDIE: A regional film-restoration effort bears fruit| work =| publisher = Asiaweek Magazine| date =December 4, 1998| url =http://www.asiaweek.com/asiaweek/98/1204/feat4.html| accessdate = November 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Del Sol would be but the first of many Filipino actors whom de Leon would "discover" and groom for stardom. Among the other discoveries of de Leon and LVN Pictures were [[Charito Solis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Charito Solis IMDB Biography|publisher = The Internet Movie Database|url =https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0813098/bio| accessdate = November 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nida Blanca]],&lt;ref name=mb/&gt; [[Armando Goyena]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Lo| first = Ricky| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =ARMANDO GOYENA: THEN AND NOW| work =| publisher = Philippine Star| date =December 23, 2001| url =http://www.newsflash.org/2001/12/sb/sb002005.htm| accessdate = November 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luz Valdez]],&lt;ref name=mb/&gt; [[Delia Razon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Baldovino| first = Gypsy| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =BLAST from the past: Delia Razon – Grand Dame of Sword-and-Sandal Epics| work =| publisher = Manila Bulletin| date =May 14, 2006| url =http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2006/05/14/ENTR2006051463947.html| accessdate = November 22, 2007}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mario Montenegro]].&lt;ref name=dns /&gt; Razon and Montenegro were signed by LVN after De Leon espied them in bit roles in other films.&lt;ref name=dns /&gt;

De León was a fiery disciplinarian&lt;ref name=mb/&gt; whom, it was joked, would fall ill when she had no one to scold.&lt;ref name=dns /&gt; She maintained a strict supervision over the behavior of her stars,&lt;ref name=mb/&gt; restraining their spending habits by withholding portions of their salaries until their withheld pay was sufficient to buy a new house or car.&lt;ref name=dns /&gt; De León though would periodically hand out cash advances to LVN actresses so they could purchase new gowns.&lt;ref name=dns /&gt; She would involve herself into the personal lives of her stars, engineering for example, the reconcillation between [[Nestor de Villa]] and his father, with whom he had become estranged after he disapproved of his becoming an actor.&lt;ref name=dns /&gt; She frequently invited many of her actors to her [[Quezon City]] home along Broadway Street. De León was also willing to help in manually sewing the costumes of her actresses.&lt;ref name=mb/&gt; 

In line with her frugal nature, De León was hesitant to spend on [[publicity]] for LVN films. Instead, she would develop "love team" tandems among her stars, such as [[Nestor de Villa]] and [[Nida Blanca]], and encourage them to "''Magpa-chismis kayo.''" ("Make gossip for yourselves.")&lt;ref name=dns /&gt;

==Lifestyle==

De León was known for her extreme humility.&lt;ref name=fil1 /&gt;"Filipinos in History Vol. 3", page 70&lt;/ref&gt; She favored her simple rural attire even when attending the most lavish receptions, and would immediately deflect any praises directed at her.&lt;ref name=fil1 /&gt; She insisted on using an old diesel-powered [[Mercedes-Benz]] even after it had fallen out of fashion and in disrepair.&lt;ref name=dns /&gt; De León also continued her philanthropic activities, providing for a school building to her native San Miguel, contributing to the renovation of the San Miguel Church,&lt;ref name=fil1 /&gt; and even donating parcels of land in Bulacan and [[Cabanatuan]] to the needy.&lt;ref name=mb/&gt;

Despite her financial success, de Leon never learned to read [[English language|English]] and could only speak the language at a most rudimentary level. She was however, well-versed in Spanish and Tagalog.&lt;ref name=dns /&gt;

==Later years==

Despite the box-office success of the films of LVN Pictures in the 1940s and 1950s, it was unable to sustain financial liquidity, and by 1961, it stopped producing movies and redirected its operations for [[post-production|post-production services]]. Despite being in her eighties, De León continued on as a film producer with [[Dalisay Pictures]], an independent production outfit. She likewise attended to her other businesses and was active until the week before her death at age 88 in 1966.&lt;ref name=dns /&gt; De Leon is buried at the [[Manila North Cemetery]].

The '''Central Business District''' ('''CBD''') is a [[Neighborhoods in New Orleans|neighborhood]] of the city of [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], [[United States]].

A subdistrict of the French Quarter/CBD area, its boundaries, as defined by the City Planning Commission, are Iberville, [[Decatur Street (New Orleans)|Decatur]] and [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]]s to the north; the [[Mississippi River]] to the east; the [[New Orleans Morial Convention Center]], Julia and [[Magazine Street]]s, and the [[Pontchartrain Expressway]] to the south; and [[Claiborne Avenue|South Claiborne Avenue]], Cleveland Street, and South and North Derbigny Streets to the west. It is the equivalent of what many [[city|cities]] call their [[downtown]], although in New Orleans [[Downtown New Orleans|"downtown" or "down town"]] was historically used to mean all portions of the city downriver from Canal Street (in the direction of flow of the Mississippi River). In recent decades, however, use of the catch-all "downtown" adjective to describe neighborhoods downriver from Canal Street has largely ceased, having been replaced in usage by individual neighborhood names (such as [[Bywater, New Orleans|Bywater]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Originally developed as the largely-residential [[Faubourg#New Orleans|Faubourg]] Ste. Marie (''English:'' St. Mary Suburb) in the late 18th century, the modern Central Business District is today a dynamic, mixed-use neighborhood, the home of professional offices in skyscrapers, specialty and neighborhood retail stores, numerous restaurants and clubs, and thousands of residents inhabiting restored, historic commercial and industrial buildings.

==Geography==
The Central Business District is located at {{Coord|29|56|59|N|90|04|14|W|type:city}} &lt;ref name="GR1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has an elevation of {{convert|3|ft|1}}.&lt;ref name="GR3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geonames.usgs.gov|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=US Board on Geographic Names|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|date=2007-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As is true of most of [[New Orleans metropolitan area|metropolitan New Orleans]], the parts of the district nearer the river are higher in elevation than areas further removed from it. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the district has a total area of {{convert|1.18|sqmi|1}}.  {{convert|1.06|sqmi|1}} of which is land and {{convert|0.12|sqmi|1}} (10.17%) of which is water.

* [[Central City, New Orleans|Central City]] (south)
* [[Tulane/Gravier, New Orleans|Tulane/Gravier]] (west)

===Boundaries===
The City Planning Commission defines the boundaries of the Central Business District as these streets: Iberville Street, Decatur Street, [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]], the [[Mississippi River]], the [[New Orleans Morial Convention Center]], Julia Street, Magazine Street, the Pontchartrain Expressway, South Claiborne Avenue, Cleveland Avenue, South Derbigny Street and North Derbigny Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gnocdc.org/orleans/1/47/index.html|title=Central Business District Neighborhood|author=Greater New Orleans Community Data Center|accessdate=2008-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
As of the [[census]]&lt;ref name="GR2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=American FactFinder}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 2000, there were 3,435 inhabitants of the census tracts best corresponding to the boundaries of the New Orleans Downtown Development District. The [[population density]] was 1,692 /mi² (664 /km²). Another 4,142 inhabitants of the adjacent [[French Quarter]] neighborhood were recorded in the 2000 Census. The CBD, its subdistricts (e.g., the '''Warehouse District'''), and the bordering neighborhoods of [[Tremé]], the French Quarter, and the [[Lower Garden District, New Orleans|Lower Garden District]] possessed 21,630 residents, according to the 2000 Census.

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2009}}
Streets in the Central Business District (originally ''Faubourg Ste. Marie'') were initially platted in the late 18th century, representing the first expansion of [[New Orleans]] beyond its original French Quarter footprint. Significant investment began in earnest following the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, as people from other parts of the [[United States]] flocked to the city. Consequently, the district began to be referred to as the '''American Sector'''.

While traditionally [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]] was viewed as the dividing line between the [[French Quarter]] and the American Sector, legally both sides of Canal Street are today considered part of the Central Business District for zoning and regulatory purposes. Through the 19th and into the 20th century, the Central Business District continued developing almost without pause. By the mid-20th century, most professional offices in the region were located downtown, the hub of a well-developed [[New Orleans Public Service Incorporated|public transit system]].

Canal Street was the primary retail destination for New Orleanians, as well as for residents of the surrounding region. Local and regional [[department store]]s [[Maison Blanche]], [[D.H. Holmes]], Godchaux's, [[Gus Mayer]], Labiche's, Kreeger's, and [[Krauss Building|Krauss]] anchored numerous well-known specialty retailers, such as [http://www.rubensteinsneworleans.com/about/history.php Rubenstein Bros.], [[Adler's Jewelry]], Koslow's, Rapp's, and [[P. P. Werlein|Werlein's Music]]. National retailers, like [[S.H. Kress &amp; Co.|Kress]], [[F.W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth]], and [[Walgreens]] were present alongside local drugstore [[K&amp;B]]. [[Sears]] operated a large store one block off Canal, on Baronne Street.

Bookstores, theaters, and movie palaces also abounded, with the neon marquees of the [[Saenger Theatre (New Orleans)|Saenger]], [[State Palace Theatre (New Orleans)|Loews State]], [[Orpheum Theater (New Orleans)|RKO Orpheum]], [[Joy Theater|Joy]], and [[Civic Theatre (New Orleans)|Civic]] theaters nightly casting multi-colored lights onto surrounding sidewalks.

In the 1950s, six-lane '''Loyola Avenue''' was constructed as an extension of Elk Place, cutting a swath through a low-income residential district and initially hosting the city's new civic center complex. The late-1960s widening of '''Poydras Street''' was undertaken to create another six-lane [[Downtown circulator|central area circulator]] for vehicular traffic, as well as to accommodate modern high-rise construction. The City of New Orleans partook in transforming the district from 1973 to 1993, in a collaboration between public and private sectors to spark active community participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Jane S.|last2=Young|first2=Alma H.|date=1993-01-01|title=Revitalising the Central Business District in the Face of Decline: The Case of New Orleans, 1973-1993|jstor=40113232|journal=The Town Planning Review|volume=64|issue=3|pages=251–271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The portion of the CBD closer to the Mississippi River and upriver from Poydras Street is known as the '''Warehouse District''', because it was heavily devoted to [[warehouse|warehousing]] and manufacturing before shipping became [[containerization|containerized]].  The [[1984 Louisiana World Exposition|1984 World's Fair]] drew attention to the then semi-derelict district, resulting in steady investment and redevelopment from the mid-1980s onward.  Many of the old 19th-century warehouses have been converted into [[hotel]]s, [[restaurant]]s, [[condominium]]s, and [[art gallery|art galleries]].

Notable structures in the CBD include the [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] [[Gallier Hall]] (the city's former [[city hall (administration)|city hall]]); the [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]]; the [[New Orleans Arena]]; the city's present-day, [[International style (architecture)|International style]] city hall; and [[One Shell Square]], the city's tallest building and headquarters for [[Royal Dutch Shell]]'s Gulf of Mexico Exploration and Production.  Other significant attractions include the postmodern [[Piazza d'Italia, New Orleans|Piazza d'Italia]], [[Harrah's New Orleans|Harrah's Casino]], the [[2 Canal Street|World Trade Center New Orleans]], the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals]], [[St. Patrick's Church (New Orleans)|St. Patrick's Church]], the [[Hibernia Bank Building (New Orleans)|Hibernia Bank Building]], and the former [[New Orleans Cotton Exchange]].

The principal public park in the CBD is [[Lafayette Square, New Orleans|Lafayette Square]], upon which face both Gallier Hall and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.  Other public spaces include Duncan Plaza, Elk Place, the Piazza d'Italia, [[Lee Circle]], Mississippi River Heritage Park, Spanish Plaza, and the Richard and Annette Bloch Cancer Survivors Plaza.

[[Museums]] include the [[National World War II Museum]], the [[Ogden Museum of Southern Art]], the Louisiana Children's Museum, the New Orleans Contemporary Arts Center and [[Confederate Memorial Hall]].

New Orleans CBD was one of the few areas of New Orleans that escaped the [[Effects of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans|catastrophic flooding]] of 2005's Hurricane Katrina.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==Government and infrastructure==
The New Orleans City Hall and surrounding structures, including the ''circa''-1960, architecturally award-winning Main Branch of the [[New Orleans Public Library]] face '''Duncan Plaza''', an exercise in 1950s-style [[urban renewal]] embodying then-mayor [[DeLesseps Story Morrison|Chep Morrison's]] desire to create a modern [[civic center]].  The '''New Orleans Civic Center''' is today much diminished, with the [[Louisiana Supreme Court]] building having been torn down in the wake of the court's 2004 departure for the [[French Quarter]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lasc.org/Bicentennial/lasc_history.aspx History of the Louisiana Supreme Court], retrieved 16 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; the Louisiana State office building having suffered the same fate, and Duncan Plaza itself having been fenced off.

The [[United States Postal Service]] operates the New Orleans Main Post Office at 701 Loyola Avenue in the CBD.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://usps.whitepages.com/service/post_office/75104?p=1&amp;s=LA&amp;service_name=post_office&amp;z=New+Orleans Post Office Location - N O MAIN OFC WINDOW SVE]."

The [[New Orleans Union Passenger Terminal|Union Passenger Terminal]] is the [[Terminal train station|terminus]] for three of [[Amtrak|Amtrak's]] long-distance trains, the [[City of New Orleans (train)|City of New Orleans]], the [[Crescent (Amtrak)|Crescent]] and, since 2005, the [[Sunset Limited]] (with the elimination, due to [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] damage, of the eastbound portion of the Sunset Limited route), and also offers inter-city bus service via [[Greyhound Lines]].

[[Interstate Highway System|Interstate Highway]] access is provided by [[Interstate 10|I-10]], via the Claiborne and [[Pontchartrain Expressway|Pontchartrain]] Expressways.  When I-10 curves to the east by the Louisiana Superdome and becomes the Claiborne Expressway, elevated above N. Claiborne Avenue, the Pontchartrain Expressway continues as [[U.S. Route 90 Business (New Orleans, Louisiana)|U.S. Route 90 Business]] and crosses the Mississippi River on the twin-bridge [[Crescent City Connection]].

Significant thoroughfares in the CBD include [[St. Charles Avenue]], Camp Street, [[Carondelet Street]], Gravier Street, Poydras Street, [[Tchoupitoulas Street]], Howard Avenue, and [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]].  Prior to the 1980s, the intersection of Gravier and Carondelet streets was the ''de facto'' heart of the city's financial district.  Though still a vibrant area, that part of the CBD witnessed the migration of much business slightly upriver to Poydras Street, as many modern [[List of tallest buildings in New Orleans|high-rise office towers]] were constructed there in the 1970s and 1980s.  The widening of Loyola Avenue, Poydras Street and O'Keefe Avenue aimed to simultaneously create an effective [[downtown circulator]] high capacity road network for automobile traffic and make room for large-scale redevelopment (e.g., Duncan Plaza, [[Louisiana Superdome|Superdome]]).  However, many of the development sites created in the wake of these improvements were never built upon, leaving a noticeable and unfortunate quantity of surface parking lots along these widened streets.

==Economy==
[[Entergy]], the region's sole [[Fortune 500]] firm, maintains its headquarters in the CBD, as does [[Reily Foods Company]], which markets [[Luzianne]] products and Standard Coffee.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.luzianne.com/contact_us.php Contact Us]."

(HRI Properties), [[Tidewater (marine services)|Tidewater Marine]], Energy Partners Ltd., Intermarine, IMTT, International Coffee Corp., and The Receivables Exchange.

The CBD also hosts the '''New Orleans I.P.''', an "Intellectual Property", home to numerous [[creative industries]] firms, and numerous bioscience companies are established at the '''New Orleans BioInnovation Center''', located within BioDistrict New Orleans.

The regional economic alliance '''Greater New Orleans, Inc.''' (GNO Inc.), [[New Orleans metropolitan area|the New Orleans metropolitan area's]] lead economic development entity for the ten-parish New Orleans region, is also headquartered downtown, as is the '''New Orleans Business Alliance''' (NOLA BA), the public-private partnership agency leading economic development efforts for the city proper.

The [[World Trade Center New Orleans|World Trade Center of New Orleans]] (WTCNO) has been located in the CBD since its establishment in 1943. The WTCNO facilitates the addition of wealth and jobs in Louisiana through international trade, economic development, and allied activities by supporting a prosperous international business climate in Louisiana.

==[[Diplomatic mission]]s==
The [[Diplomatic missions of Mexico|Consulate of Mexico]] in New Orleans is located in the CBD.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://portal.sre.gob.mx/nuevaorleans/ Bienvenidos Consulado de México en Nueva Orleáns]." [[Diplomatic missions of Mexico|Consulate of Mexico in New Orleans]]. Retrieved on March 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The consulate re-opened in that location in 2008 because of the dramatic increase in the local Mexican immigrant population, many of whom arrived in the [[Effects of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans|wake of Hurricane Katrina]] to assist in the city's rebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, David.

In addition to Mexico, [[France]] maintains a consulate in downtown New Orleans, a reflection of the long-standing ties between that nation and Louisiana, and of [[New France|France]]'s role as the founder of New Orleans in 1718.

'''Newtown Pery''' is an area of central [[Limerick]], [[Ireland]], and forms the main [[city centre]] (or [[Central Business District|CBD]]) of the city. The district is known for its [[Georgian architecture|Georgian architectural]] heritage and is the core area of Limerick's Georgian Quarter. It is one of the three towns that make up modern-day Limerick City Centre, the other two being the older ''[[King's Island, Limerick|Englishtown]] &amp; [[Irishtown, Limerick|Irishtown]]'' which date from the medieval period. Newtown Pery houses the largest collection of Georgian townhouses in Ireland outside of [[Georgian Dublin|Dublin]]. In 1837, [[Samuel Lewis (publisher)|Samuel Lewis]] in his ''Topographical Dictionary of Ireland'' described Newtown Pery as ‘one of the handsomest towns in Ireland’.&lt;ref name="libraryireland.com"&gt;http://www.libraryireland.com/topog/L/Limerick-City-Topography.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Limerick - O'Connell Street looking north east - geograph.org.uk - 331730.jpg|225px|thumb|Limerick - O'Connell Street looking north east. The majority of this section of Newtown Pery was rebuilt in the mid to late 20th Century]]
Prior to the development of Newtown Pery, the historical City of Limerick was situated just north of the present day city centre, stretching from [[King John's Castle (Limerick)|King John's Castle]] towards where [[St John's Cathedral (Limerick)|St. John's Cathedral]] is today. The city was made up of two distinct towns; [[King's Island, Limerick|Englishtown]] (populated by [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]] settlers) located on the historical island city and [[Irishtown, Limerick|Irishtown]] (populated by natives) located on the southern bank of the Abbey River.&lt;ref name="limerickcity.ie"&gt;http://www.limerickcity.ie/media/limerick%20history%2005.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The two towns were connected by one bridge ''Baal's Bridge'' over the Abbey River, while ''Thomond Bridge'' beside [[King John's Castle (Limerick)|King John's Castle]] was a major crossing point of the [[River Shannon]] from ''Englishtown'' into modern-day [[County Clare]]. As with most cities of this time, Limerick was heavily fortified and walled and the streets were characteristically narrow, winding &amp; cramped.&lt;ref name="libraryireland.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="limerickcity.ie"/&gt; Prior to the construction of Newtown Pery, Limerick was also beginning to exhibit some early Georgian styles within the old city. Examples surviving today include; the ''Old Bishop's Palace'' at ''Castle Street'' &amp; at ''John's Square'' (Limerick's first example of fashionable architecture and civic spaces). Early photographs of the old city areas also show the old (pre-Georgian) continental &amp; [[Dutch gable]]d styled townhouses as being altered somewhat to appear more Georgian. Very few of these survive today.  Originally the land south of the medieval city that was to become Newtown Pery was owned by the [[Franciscans]] and known as ''South Priors Land''. Following the [[dissolution of the monasteries]] by [[Henry VIII]] this land was granted to Edmund Sexton of whom [[Edmund Sexton Pery]] was a descendant and on whom much of Georgian Limerick is credited.&lt;ref name="limerickcity.ie"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://limerickslife.com/rediscovering-limericke-3/&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the turbulent years of the 17th century, Limerick began to prosper in the 18th century and was completely transformed into the city it is today.&lt;ref name="georgianquarter.com"&gt;http://georgianquarter.com/264-2/&lt;/ref&gt; Easy access from most parts of Ireland facilitated by the [[River Shannon]] &amp; the opening of [[canals]] enabled Limerick to become the main port city on the western side of Ireland, which in turn brought much prosperity to the city and to its merchants and landowners with trade between Britain and America.&lt;ref name="georgianquarter.com"/&gt;

The boundaries of the city of Limerick, where the [[municipal corporation]] had authority, were smaller than the [[county of the city]] of Limerick, where the city [[grand jury]] had parallel authority.  The area within the county of the city but outside the city proper was termed the city liberties. The development of Newtown Pery can be attributed to the work of [[Edmund Sexton Pery, 1st Viscount Pery|Edmund Sexton Pery]] (created [[Viscount Pery]] in 1785) and his plan for the development of a [[new town]] on lands he owned in the south liberties of the city. In 1769, he commissioned the Irish engineer [[Christopher Colles]] to design a town plan on his estate which has since become known as ''Newtown Pery''. Colles devised an impressive plan for the Pery Estate which divided the estate into a [[grid plan]] of equal rectangular plots &amp; length and of a distinctive architectural unity which still defines the city centre to this day.&lt;ref name="limerickcity.ie"/&gt; The town was built in stages as Pery sold off leases to builders and developers who built 4 and 5 story townhouses in the Georgian fashion with long wide and elegant streets in [[grid plan]] design with [[O'Connell Street, Limerick|O'Connell Street]] (originally known as George's Street) as its centre, which was mostly in accordance with Colles' plan.&lt;ref name="garrymiley.com"&gt;http://www.garrymiley.com/2007/05/05/TheConservationOfGeorgianLimerick1.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest houses are located along Bank Place, Rutland Street, Patrick Street which were built by the Arthur family - a prominent Limerick family during the 18th century. Some of the finest examples of [[Georgian Architecture]] can be seen at the [[The Crescent (Limerick)|Crescent]] area and [[Pery Square]].&lt;ref name="limerickcity.ie"/&gt; The Custom's House ([[Hunt Museum]]), designed by Italian architect [[Davis Ducart]], is also one of the city's finest examples of Georgian Architecture.

By the turn of the 19th Century, Newtown Pery was rapidly growing as most fashionable area of the city. In 1807 its leading residents secured a [[private act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK parliament]] to establish a body of [[improvement commissioners]] as municipal authority for the [[Civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] of St Michael's, within which Newtown Pery was located.&lt;ref name="michaelsparishArchives"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.limerick.ie/historicalresources/limerickarchives/archivecollections/digitalarchives/limerickcitycouncilandlocalgovernmentcollections/commissionersfortheimprovementofst.michaelsparish1810-1851|title=Commissioners for the Improvement of St. Michael's Parish, 1810-1851|work=Archives|publisher=Limerick City and County Council|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commissioners were abolished in 1853 when the area was absorbed into Limerick city.&lt;ref name="michaelsparishArchives" /&gt; One brake on the town's development was that the only crossing point on the Shannon remained at Thomond Bridge in the old and now less fashionable Englishtown district.&lt;ref name="LovettWellesley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lovett|first=Phil|title=The Wellesley Bridge|journal=The Old Limerick Journal|issue=9|pages=28–31|url=http://www.limerickcity.ie/media/Media,3987,en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1835, a new bridge was built over the Shannon connecting the west directly with Newtown Pery.&lt;ref name="LovettWellesley" /&gt; It was originally called Wellesley Bridge after [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley]], the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] when the act to pay for it was passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ó Maidín|first=Pádraig|title=The Building of the Sarsfield Bridge|journal=Old Limerick Journal|issue=6|pages=5–6|url=http://www.limerickcity.ie/media/Media,3941,en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It cemented Newtown Pery's position as Limerick's premier urban district as connections to the area improved.&lt;ref name="LovettWellesley" /&gt; The five-arch bridge was designed by [[Alexander Nimmo]] based on the [[Pont de Neuilly]] in [[Paris]]. In 1882 it was replaced with the current [[Sarsfield Bridge]].&lt;ref name="LovettWellesley" /&gt;

==Details==
[[File:Limerick4.JPG|thumb|Tait Memorial Clock Tower &amp; Dominican Church, Baker Place]]
From its development Newtown Pery has served as Limerick's [[Central Business District|CBD]]. It is also the city's main retail district which is centered on [[O'Connell Street, Limerick|O'Connell Street]], [[William Street, Limerick|William Street]] and the adjoining streets. In addition to the quality of the Georgian heritage in the district, another striking feature of the development is the [[grid plan]] layout of the streets in the area running north/south and east/west in similar fashion and design as found in [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Glasgow]], [[Bristol]] &amp; [[Berlin]] albeit on a smaller scale.&lt;ref name="garrymiley.com"/&gt; This distinguishes Limerick's Georgian stock to the other major Irish Georgian development in Dublin, as Limerick's terraces are more uniform. This is due to the fact that the Pery owned all the land that was developed and it enabled a single development plan.

Limerick continued to expand following the [[Acts of Union 1800|Act of Union]] and into the early 19th Century, however, Pery's plan for the city was never fully realised. It was intended that the city would continue further southwards however a crippling economic decline in Ireland caused by the [[Great Irish Famine]] put an end to the development. The terrace at [[Pery Square]] was the last development of the great Georgian expansion of Limerick. The terrace itself was intended to be part of a Georgian square enclosing the People's Park, similar to [[Fitzwilliam Square]] or [[Mountjoy Square]] in [[Dublin]] however the plans were never realised as the development coincided with the beginning of the Famine. Another distinguishing feature of Georgian Limerick to Georgian Dublin is, Newtown Pery was a completely new ''greenfield'' development. Limerick's medieval city was left completely intact and remains to this day. Unfortunately, most of the built infrastructure of medieval Limerick did not survive past the mid 20th Century following the clearance of slum living in the city. Some examples survive and the street outlines remain in ''Nicholas Street'', ''Mary Street'', ''Broad Street'', ''John Street'' &amp; ''Mungret Street''. Much of Georgian Dublin in contrast however was undertaken by the [[Wide Streets Commission]] which almost completely rebuilt Dublin over the older medieval city.

==Decline==
[[File:George Street, Limerick (5691906290).jpg|thumb|O'Connell Street in the early 20th century featuring the imposing facade of Cannock's Department Store &amp; its landmark clocktower. It was rebuilt in the early 1960s, losing its Georgian character]]
Although housing an important collection of Georgian architecture and acting as Limerick's city centre, unfortunately Newtown Pery's position as the one time fashionable area of the city is long over. In addition to this, its Georgian heritage has been severely compromised, in particular around the retail core of ''[[O'Connell Street, Limerick|O'Connell Street]]'' &amp; ''[[William Street, Limerick|William street]]''. Economic decline &amp; stagnation plagued Limerick during the 20th Century which saw some townhouses converted to tenements such as at ''Arthur's Quay &amp; Bank Place''. During this time very little investment was seen in Newtown Pery, only the exodus of families &amp; industries to new suburban districts around the city due to modern requirements. By the mid 20th century dereliction had taken its toll as the townhouses at ''Arthur's Quay'', ''Francis Street'' &amp; ''Bank Place'' were completely lost. Lax development controls enabled the almost complete rebuilding of the northern end of O'Connell Street and replacing what were some iconic and illustrious buildings with more [[modernist]] (&amp; perhaps less attractive) sixties style architecture. The loss of ''Todd's Department Store'' to a fire which gutted the building, the rebuilding of ''Cannock's Department Store, Royal George Hotel, AIB Bank'' amongst many more, completely altered the look of city and ultimately resulted in a loss of the districts heritage and character. Nevertheless, much of the districts Georgian townhouses remained intact, however many were converted to offices or flats while others remained unoccupied or neglected. However, despite the architectural losses &amp; economic conditions; Newtown Pery remained the premier retail &amp; services district for Limerick and the greater [[Mid-West Region, Ireland|Mid-West Region]] well up into the late 20th and early 21st Century.

Economic stagnation in Limerick, was only broken by the [[Celtic Tiger]] in the late 20th Century. Unfortunately, Newtown Pery, still lagged behind with regards to investment &amp; planning with exception to the riverfront of the [[River Shannon|Shannon]]. Suburban areas of Limerick have seen massive investments particularly in retail, which has seen the one time retail core of ''[[O'Connell Street, Limerick|O' Connell Street]] &amp; [[William Street, Limerick|William street]]'' been eclipsed by massive retail developments in the suburbs. Poor planning &amp; lack of investment has resulted in high vacancy rates &amp; further dereliction which plagues some parts. Amongst the casualties of this poor planning has been the ''[[Patrick Street, Limerick|Patrick Street]], [[Rutland Street, Limerick|Rutland Street]] &amp; Ellen Street'' areas which were all part of the ill fated [[Opera Centre]] development. These streets are now almost completely derelict &amp; vacant. [[Urban decay|Urban depression]] in Limerick unfortunately is not confined to these areas alone as much of central Limerick is now exhibiting the effects, mainly of heavy suburbanisation but also the effects of economic recession. The area is now a shadow of its former self as more and more businesses &amp; retail facilities leave the city centre for the convenience of the new shopping centres.

==Future==
In order to arrest the decline of Limerick's CBD and Newtown Pery in general, both [[Limerick City Council]] and national government have introduced schemes to counteract the heavy suburbanisation of the city. Amongst the most eloborate plans is the €250 million ''Limerick 2030'' plan which will see a complete redevelopment of the ''Arthur's Quay'' area into a new and modern retailing complex.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.limerickcity.ie/Planning/EconomicDevelopment/Limerick2030AnEconomicandSpatialPlanforLimerick/&lt;/ref&gt; It will also see the development of a higher education campus to include facilities from [[Limerick Institute of Technology|LIT]], [[University of Limerick|UL]], and [[Mary Immaculate College|MIC]] and a refurbishment of the city's main streets.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Another plan is the ''Living City Initiative'' which provides tax relief for residents who refurbish Georgian houses in designated areas. It also provides tax relief to retailers who carry out works to upgrade or re-fit their shops in the designated Georgian area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.limerick.ie/business/whatsnew/2013-02-18limerickcityandcountycouncilswelcomelivingcityinitiative.html&lt;/ref&gt; Newtown Pery is a testament to Limerick's rich &amp; eventful past and remains one of the most important remnants of Ireland's [[Georgian Era]]. It remains to be seen if the above schemes can stop the decline of the city's historic &amp; elegant stock of buildings.

The '''Operation Carne Fraca''' or '''Operation Weak Meat''' in Brazilian media in English ({{Language with name/for|2=Portuguese|3=meat of minor quality}}), is an action enforced by the [[Federal Police of Brazil]], the Brazilian [[Law enforcement in Brazil|federal police]], started on March 17, 2017 which investigated some of the country's largest meat processing companies.

The company [[JBS S.A.]],&lt;ref group="A"&gt;JBS represents about a quarter of world's market on beef&lt;/ref&gt; holding the trademarks [[Seara Foods|Seara Alimentos]], [[Swift Armour]], [[Friboi]] and [[Vigor Alimentos|Vigor]] and also the [[Brasil Foods|BRF]] company, holding the trademarks [[Sadia S.

'''PEST analysis''' (political, economic, socio-cultural and technological) describes a framework of macro-environmental factors used in the [[environmental scanning]] component of [[strategic management]]. It is part of an external analysis when conducting a strategic analysis or doing [[market research]], and gives an overview of the different macro-environmental factors to be taken into consideration. It is a  strategic tool for understanding market growth or decline, business position, potential and direction for operations. 

Variants that build on the PEST framework include:
* '''PESTEL''' or '''PESTLE''', which adds legal and environmental factors. Popular in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cipd.co.uk/subjects/corpstrtgy/general/pestle-analysis.htm PESTLE analysis history and application], CIPD. Retrieved 2009-10-21.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''SLEPT''', adding legal factors.
* '''STEPE''', adding ecological factors.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, J. [http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/jrichardson/STEPE.htm A Brief Intellectual History of the STEPE Model or Framework (i.e., the Social, Technical, Economic, Political, and Ecological)], accessed 18 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''STEEPLE''' and '''STEEPLED''', adding ethics and demographic factors.
* '''DESTEP''', adding demographic and ecological factors.
* '''SPELIT''', adding legal and intercultural factors. Popular in the United States since the mid-2000s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Spelit-Power-Matrix-Organizational-Environment/dp/141967191X/], SPELIT Power Matrix. Retrieved 2015-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is also '''STEER''', which considers sociocultural, technological, economic, ecological, and [[Regulatory compliance|regulatory]] factors, but does not specifically include political factors.&lt;ref name="CarrJr.2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lawrence P. Carr|author2=Alfred J. Nanni Jr.|title=Delivering Results: Managing What Matters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VxE5rnqJq4cC&amp;pg=PA44|date=28 July 2009|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4419-0621-2|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==
The basic PEST analysis includes four factors:
* '''Political''' factors are basically how the [[government]] intervenes in the economy. Specifically, political factors have areas including [[tax policy]], [[labour law]], [[environmental law]], [[trade restriction]]s, [[tariffs]], and political stability. Political factors may also include goods and services which the government aims to provide or be provided ([[merit good]]s) and those that the government does not want to be provided ([[demerit good]]s or merit bads). Furthermore, governments have a high impact on the [[health]], [[education]], and [[infrastructure]] of a nation.
* '''Economic''' factors include [[economic growth]], [[interest rate]]s, [[exchange rate]]s,  [[inflation rate]]. These factors greatly affect how businesses operate and make decisions. For example, interest rates affect a firm's [[cost of capital]] and therefore to what extent a business grows and expands. Exchange rates can affect the costs of exporting goods and the supply and price of imported goods in an economy.
* '''Social''' factors include the cultural aspects and health consciousness, population growth rate, age distribution, career attitudes and emphasis on safety. High trends in social factors affect the demand for a company's products and how that company operates. For example, the ageing population may imply a smaller and less-willing workforce (thus increasing the cost of labour). Furthermore, companies may change various management strategies to adapt to social trends caused from this (such as recruiting older workers).
* '''Technological''' factors include technological aspects like [[R&amp;D]] activity, [[automation]], technology incentives and the rate of [[technological change]]. These can determine [[barrier to entry|barriers to entry]], minimum efficient production level and influence the [[outsourcing]] decisions. Furthermore, technological shifts would affect costs, quality, and lead to [[innovation]].

Expanding the analysis to PESTLE or PESTEL adds:

* '''Legal''' factors include [[discrimination law]], [[consumer law]], [[antitrust law]], [[employment law]], and [[health and safety law]]. These factors can affect how a company operates, its costs, and the demand for its products.
* '''Environmental''' factors include ecological and environmental aspects such as weather, climate, and [[climate change]], which may especially affect industries such as tourism, farming, and insurance. Furthermore, growing awareness of the potential impacts of climate change is affecting how companies operate and the products they offer, both creating new markets and diminishing or destroying existing ones.

Other factors for the various offshoots include:

* '''Demographic''' factors include gender, age, ethnicity, knowledge of languages, disabilities, mobility, home ownership, employment status, religious belief or practice, culture and tradition, living standards and income level.
* '''Regulatory''' factors include acts of parliament and associated regulations, international and national standards, local government by-laws, and mechanisms to monitor and ensure compliance with these.

More factors discussed in the SPELIT Power Matrix include:

* '''Inter-cultural''' factors considers collaboration in a global setting.
* Other specialized factors discussed in chapter 10 of the SPELIT Power Matrix include the '''Ethical, Educational, Physical, Religious, and Security''' environments. The security environment may include either personal, company, or national security.
* Other business-related factors that might be considered in an environmental analysis include '''Competition, Demographics, Ecological, Geographical, Historical, Organizational, and Temporal (schedule).'''&lt;ref&gt;Schmieder-Ramirez, J. and Mallette, L.,  [http://insciencepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ISP_Education-Applications-Developments-Book.pdf Using the SPELIT Analysis Technique for Organizational Transitions], Chapter 28 of "Education Applications and Developments" edited by Mafalda Carmo, Science Press, 2015 Retrieved 2015-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applicability of the factors ==
The model's factors will vary in importance to a given company based on its industry and the goods it produces. For example, consumer and [[Business-to-business|B2B]] companies tend to be more affected by the social factors, while a global defense contractor would tend to be more affected by political factors. Additionally, factors that are more likely to change in the future or more relevant to a given company will carry greater importance. For example, a company which has borrowed heavily will need to focus more on the economic factors (especially interest rates).

Furthermore, conglomerate companies who produce a wide range of products (such as Sony, Disney, or BP) may find it more useful to analyze one department of its company at a time with the PESTEL model, thus focusing on the specific factors relevant to that one department. A company may also wish to divide factors into geographical relevance, such as local, national, and global.

== Use of PEST analysis with other models ==
The PEST factors, combined with external micro-environmental factors and internal drivers, can be classified as opportunities and threats in a [[SWOT analysis]]. A graphical method for PEST analysis called "PESTLEWeb" was developed at [[Henley Business School]] in the UK; research showed that PESTLEWeb diagrams are considered by users to be more logical, rational, and convincing than traditional PEST analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collins|first1=Rob|title=A Graphical Method for Exploring the Business Environment|url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~kell0956/docs/PESTLEWeb.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collins|first1=Rob|title=Is there a better way to analyse the business environment?|url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~kell0956/docs/pestleweb_thesis.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter John Debnam''' (born 21 April 1954), is a former [[Australia]]n politician. He was a member of the [[New South Wales]] [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] representing [[Electoral district of Vaucluse|Vaucluse]] between 1994 and [[New South Wales state election, 2011|2011]]. Debnam is a former [[Leader of the New South Wales Liberal Party]], [[Opposition (parliamentary)|Leader of the Opposition]] and [[Shadow Minister]] for Western Sydney, Redfern/Waterloo and Citizenship. He also held the [[Shadow Cabinet|shadow portfolios]] of Infrastructure and Energy.

==Biography==
Debnam's early years of schooling were at [[Frenchs Forest Public School]] and [[The Forest High School (New South Wales)|The Forest High School]]. Debnam was educated at the [[Royal Australian Naval College]], where he graduated in 1974. He served in the [[Royal Australian Navy]] from 1972 to 1980. During his Naval career, Debnam served on many ships including the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMAS|Melbourne|R21|6}}, destroyer escort {{HMAS|Torrens|DE 53|6}}, destroyers {{HMAS|Vampire|D11|6}} and {{HMAS|Anzac|D59|6}} and patrol boats {{HMAS|Attack|P 90|6}} and {{HMAS|Barricade|P 98|6}}. After leaving the Navy, Debnam studied at the [[Macquarie Graduate School of Management]], where he gained an [[MBA]]. He held positions at Dalgety Farmers Limited, [[Boeing Australia|Hawker de Havilland]] and Australian Aircraft Consortium before entering politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Peter Debnam, Opposition Leader| publisher =[[Liberal Party of Australia (New South Wales Division)|Liberal Party]]| url =http://www.peterdebnam.com.au/main_content/main_content/peter_debnam_mp_-_nsw_liberal_leader.html| accessdate = 2007-02-27 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070223025714/http://www.peterdebnam.com.au/main_content/main_content/peter_debnam_mp_-_nsw_liberal_leader.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 Debnam was elected to the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] as Liberal member for Vaucluse. The following year the Liberal government was defeated by [[Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch)|Labor]] under [[Bob Carr]]. Between 1997 and 2005 Debnam was successively Shadow Minister for Housing and for Planning and Urban Affairs, Shadow Treasurer, Shadow Minister for Transport, Shadow Minister for Police and Shadow Minister for Transport Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Mr Peter John Debnam, MBA MP| work =Members of Parliament| publisher =[[Parliament of New South Wales]]| url =http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Prod/Parlment/Members.nsf/d890a06557517cedca256e700008765e/f5d110ab77befa634a25674500016563| accessdate = 12 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[John Brogden (politician)|John Brogden]]'s sudden resignation as Liberal Leader in August 2005, the Deputy Leader, [[Barry O'Farrell]], was initially the favourite to become leader, but Debnam steadily gained ground as he lobbied Liberal MPs, and on 31 August O'Farrell withdrew from the contest.

==Allegations against Attorney-General==
On 16 November 2006, Debnam suggested under [[Parliamentary Privilege]] that NSW Attorney-General [[Bob Debus]] was under investigation by the [[Police Integrity Commission]]. In response, the Government released a police report stating that a minister had been the subject of complaints (not an investigation), and that they were dismissed in 2003 as spurious and groundless. The report did not name the minister concerned as it was, deemed to be 'not in the public interest'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =  http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20773189-1702,00.html| title = Allegations against Debus 'spurious'| date = 2006-11-17| accessdate = 2006-11-17| publisher = [[News Limited]] | work = [[The Australian]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Mr Debnam declined to provide evidence to support his claims, he was censured by Parliament for misleading the House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =  http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200611/s1790547.htm| title = Parliament censures Debnam over Debus claims| date = 2006-11-16| accessdate = 2007-02-22|  work = ABC News |publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was subsequently reported that Debnam's source for the accusation was a convicted child sex offender and bank robber with a history of making unsubstantiated allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =  http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/rotten-debnam-refuses-to-apologise/2006/11/21/1163871391544.html?from=rss| title = "Rotten" Debnam refuses to apologise| date = 2006-11-21| accessdate = 2007-02-22| publisher = Fairfax Media | work = The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opinion poll support for the Opposition leader declined markedly in the wake of the allegations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =  http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/election-becomes-race-for-the-biggest-loser/2006/11/20/1163871338930.html?page=1| title = Election becomes race for the biggest loser| date = 2006-11-21| accessdate = 2007-02-22| publisher = Fairfax Media | work = The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also distracted attention from a campaign against the Government over the sacking of Ministers [[Milton Orkopoulos]] and [[Carl Scully]].

==2007 election==
Peter Debnam led the Liberal/National coalition to defeat in the [[New South Wales state election, 2007|2007 state election]]. The Coalition gained a total of four seats from Labor and independents—too few to significantly reduce Labor's majority. Following the election, his deputy, O'Farrell, announced he would challenge Debnam for the Liberal leadership.  When it was apparent that Debnam did not have enough support to keep his post, he withdrew from the contest on 2 April 2007, effectively handing the leadership to O'Farrell. On 11 April 2007 O'Farrell appointed Debnam as opposition infrastructure and energy spokesman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Porter's Five Forces Framework''' is a tool for analyzing competition of a business. It draws from [[Industrial organization|industrial organization (IO) economics]] to derive five forces that determine the competitive intensity and, therefore, the attractiveness (or lack of it) of an industry in terms of its profitability. An "unattractive" industry is one in which the effect of these five forces reduces overall profitability. The most unattractive industry would be one approaching "pure competition", in which available profits for all firms are driven to [[Profit (economics)#Normal profit|normal profit levels]]. The five-forces perspective is associated with its originator, [[Michael E. Porter]] of [[Harvard University]]. This framework was first published in ''Harvard Business Review'' in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Porter, "How Competitive Forces Shape Strategy," May 1979 (Vol. 57, No. 2), pp. 137-145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Porter refers to these forces as the [[Market_environment#Micro-environment|microenvironment]], to contrast it with the more general term [[environmental scanning|macroenvironment]]. They consist of those forces close to a [[company]] that affect its ability to serve its customers and make a [[Profit (economics)|profit]]. A change in any of the forces normally requires a business unit to re-assess the [[marketplace]] given the overall change in [[industry information]]. The overall industry attractiveness does not imply that every [[firm]] in the industry will return the same profitability. Firms are able to apply their [[core competencies]], [[business model]] or network to achieve a profit above the industry average. A clear example of this is the airline [[industry]]. As an industry, profitability is low because the industry's underlying structure of high fixed costs and low variable costs afford enormous latitude in the price of airline travel. Airlines tend to compete on cost, and that drives down the profitability of individual carriers as well as the industry itself because it simplifies the decision by a customer to buy or not buy a ticket. A few carriers--[[Richard Branson]]'s [[Virgin Atlantic]] is one--have tried, with limited success, to use sources of differentiation in order to increase profitability.

Porter's five forces include three forces from 'horizontal' competition--the threat of substitute products or services, the threat of established rivals, and the threat of new entrants--and two others from 'vertical' competition--the [[bargaining power]] of suppliers and the bargaining power of customers.

Porter developed his five forces framework in reaction to the then-popular [[SWOT analysis]], which he found both lacking in rigor and ''ad hoc''.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Porter, Nicholas Argyres and Anita M. McGahan, "An Interview with Michael Porter", ''The Academy of Management Executive'' '''16''':2:44 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4165839 at JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Porter's five-forces framework is based on the [[structure–conduct–performance paradigm]] in [[Industrial organization|industrial organizational economics]]. It has been applied to try to address a diverse range of problems, from helping businesses become more profitable to helping governments stabilize industries.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1924831 ''Competition and Crisis in Mortgage Securitization'']&lt;/ref&gt; Other Porter strategy tools include the [[value chain]] and [[Porter generic strategies|generic competitive strategies]].

== Five Forces ==
{{strategy}}

=== Threat of new entrants ===
Profitable industries that yield high returns will attract new firms. New entrants eventually will decrease profitability for other firms in the industry. Unless the entry of new firms can be made more difficult by [[incumbents]], abnormal profitability will fall towards zero ([[perfect competition]]), which is the minimum level of profitability required to keep an industry in business.

The following factors can have an effect on how much of a threat new entrants may pose:
* The existence of [[barriers to entry]] ([[patents]], [[rights]], etc.). The most attractive segment is one in which entry barriers are high and exit barriers are low. It's worth noting, however, that high barriers to entry almost always make exit more difficult.
* Government policy
* Capital requirements
* Absolute cost
* Cost disadvantages independent of size
* [[Economies of scale]]
* [[Product differentiation]]
* [[Brand equity]]
* Switching costs
* Expected retaliation 
* Access to distribution channels
* [[Customer loyalty]] to established brands
* Industry profitability (the more profitable the industry, the more attractive it will be to new competitors)
* [[Network effect]]

=== Threat of substitutes ===
A substitute product uses a different technology to try to solve the same economic need. Examples of substitutes are meat, poultry, and fish; landlines and cellular telephones; airlines, automobiles, trains, and ships; beer and wine; and so on. For example, tap water is a substitute for Coke, but Pepsi is a product that uses the same technology (albeit different ingredients) to compete head-to-head with Coke, so it is not a substitute. Increased marketing for drinking tap water might "shrink the pie" for both Coke and Pepsi, whereas increased Pepsi advertising would likely "grow the pie" (increase consumption of all soft drinks), while giving Pepsi a larger market share at Coke's expense. 

Potential factors:
* Buyer propensity to substitute
* Relative price performance of substitute
* Buyer's [[switching costs]]
* Perceived level of [[product differentiation]]
* Number of substitute products available in the market
* Ease of substitution
* Availability of close substitute

=== Bargaining power of customers ===
The bargaining power of customers is also described as the market of outputs: the ability of customers to put the [[firm]] under pressure, which also affects the customer's sensitivity to price changes. Firms can take measures to reduce buyer power, such as implementing a loyalty program. Buyers' power is high if buyers have many alternatives. It is low if they have few choices. 

Potential factors:
* Buyer concentration to [[firm]] [[concentration ratio]]
* Degree of dependency upon existing channels of distribution
* Bargaining leverage, particularly in industries with high [[fixed cost]]s
* Buyer switching costs
* Buyer information availability
* Availability of existing substitute products
* Buyer [[price sensitivity]]
* Differential advantage (uniqueness) of industry products
* [[RFM (customer value)]] Analysis

=== Bargaining power of suppliers ===
The bargaining power of suppliers is also described as the market of inputs. Suppliers of raw materials, components, labor, and services (such as expertise) to the [[firm]] can be a source of power over the firm when there are few substitutes. If you are making biscuits and there is only one person who sells flour, you have no alternative but to buy it from them. Suppliers may refuse to work with the firm or charge excessively high prices for unique resources.

Potential factors are:
* Supplier switching costs relative to [[firm]] switching costs
* Degree of differentiation of inputs
* Impact of inputs on cost and differentiation
* Presence of substitute inputs
* Strength of distribution channel
* Supplier concentration to [[firm]] concentration ratio
* Employee solidarity (e.g. [[labor unions]])
* Supplier competition: the ability to forward vertically integrate and cut out the buyer.

===  Competitive rivalry ===
For most industries the intensity of competitive rivalry is the major determinant of the competitiveness of the industry. Having an understanding of industry rivals is vital to successfully market a product. Positioning pertains to how the public perceives a product and distinguishes it from competitors. A business must be aware of its competitors marketing strategy and pricing and also be reactive to any changes made. 

Potential factors:
* Sustainable [[competitive advantage]] through [[innovation]]
* Competition between online and offline companies
* Level of [[advertising]] expense
* Powerful competitive strategy
* Firm [[concentration ratio]]

== Usages ==
Strategy consultants occasionally use Porter's five forces [[Conceptual framework|framework]] when making a qualitative evaluation of a [[firm]]'s strategic position. However, for most consultants, the framework is only a starting point. They might use [[value chain]] or another type of analysis in conjunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://flevy.com/blog/introduction-to-strategy-development-and-strategy-execution/ | title=Introduction to Strategy Development and Strategy Execution | publisher=Flevy | date=21 October 2014 | accessdate=2 November 2014 | author=Tang, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like all general frameworks, an analysis that uses it to the exclusion of specifics about a particular situation is considered naive.

According to Porter, the five forces framework should be used at the line-of-business industry level; it is not designed to be used at the industry group or industry sector level. An industry is defined at a lower, more basic level: a market in which similar or closely related products and/or services are sold to buyers. (See [[industry information]].)  A [[firm]] that competes in a single industry should develop, at a minimum, one five forces analysis for its industry. Porter makes clear that for diversified companies, the primary issue in [[corporate strategy]] is the selection of [[Industry|industries]] ([[Industry|lines of business]]) in which the company will compete. The average ''Fortune Global 1,000'' company competes in 52 industries &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-management/chapter/external-inputs-to-strategy/|title=External Inputs to Strategy {{!}} Boundless Management|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Criticisms ==
Porter's framework has been challenged by other academics and strategists. For instance, Kevin P. Coyne and Somu Subramaniam claim that three dubious assumptions underlie the five forces:
* That buyers, competitors, and suppliers are unrelated and do not interact and [[collusion|collude]].
* That the source of value is structural advantage (creating barriers to entry).
* That uncertainty is low, allowing participants in a market to plan for and respond to changes in competitive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin P. Coyne and Somu Subramaniam, "Bringing Discipline to Strategy, ''[[McKinsey Quarterly]]'', 1996, (Vol. 33, No. 4), pp. 14-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important extension to Porter's work came from Adam Brandenburger and [[Barry Nalebuff]] of [[Yale School of Management]] in the mid-1990s. Using [[game theory]], they added the concept of [[complementors]] (also called "the 6th force") to try to explain the reasoning behind strategic alliances. Complementors are known as the impact of related products and services already in the market.&lt;ref&gt;Brandenburger, A. M., &amp; Nalebuff, B. J. (1995). The Right Game: Use Game Theory to Shape Strategy. ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', (Vol. 73, No. 4), 57-71. [http://faculty.som.yale.edu/barrynalebuff/rightgame_hbr1995.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that [[complementors]] are the sixth force has often been credited to [[Andrew Grove]], former CEO of [[Intel Corporation]]. Martyn Richard Jones, while consulting at [[Groupe Bull]], developed an augmented five forces model in Scotland in 1993. It is based on Porter's Framework and includes Government (national and regional) as well as pressure groups as the notional 6th force. This model was the result of work carried out as part of [[Groupe Bull]]'s Knowledge Asset Management Organisation initiative.

Porter indirectly rebutted the assertions of other forces, by referring to innovation, government, and complementary products and services as "factors" that affect the five forces.&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Porter. "The Five Competitive Forces that Shape Strategy", ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', January 2008 (Vol. 88, No. 1), pp. 78-93. [http://hbr.org/2008/01/the-five-competitive-forces-that-shape-strategy/ar/1 PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also perhaps not feasible to evaluate the attractiveness of an industry independently of the resources that a [[firm]] brings to that industry. It is thus argued (Wernerfelt 1984)&lt;ref&gt;Wernerfelt, B. (1984), A Resource-based View of the Firm, ''[[Strategic Management Journal]]'', Vol. 5: pp. 171-180 [http://web.mit.edu/bwerner/www/papers/AResource-BasedViewoftheFirm.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; that this theory be combined with the [[Resource-based view|resource-based view (RBV)]] in order for the firm to develop a sounder framework.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2248">A '''power structure''' is an overall system of influence relationships between any individual and every other individual within any selected group of people. A description of a power structure would capture the way in which [[Power (social and political)|power]] or [[authority]] is distributed between people within groups such as a government, nation, institution, organization, or a society.&lt;ref&gt;G. William Domhoff, Thomas R. Dye, ''Power Elites and Organizations'' (1987), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Such structures are of interest to various fields, including [[sociology]], [[government]], [[economics]], and [[business]]. A power structure may be formal and intentionally constructed to maximize values like [[Social justice|fairness]] or [[efficiency]], as in a [[hierarchical organization]] wherein every entity, except one, is subordinate to a single other entity. Conversely, a power structure may be an informal set of roles, such as those found in a [[dominance hierarchy]] in which members of a social group interact, often aggressively, to create a ranking system. A culture that is organised in a dominance hierarchy is a [[dominator culture]], the opposite of an egalitarian culture of partnership. A visible, dominant group or elite that holds power or authority within a power structure is often referred to as being [[the Establishment]]. Power structures are fluid, with changes occurring constantly, either slowly or rapidly, evolving or revolutionary, peacefully or violently.

As chairman of Kidney Wales Foundation, Aggarwal campaigned and provided evidence from 2007 onwards &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140728160557/http://www.assemblywales.org/bus-home/bus-third-assembly/3-committees/3-scrutiny/3-hwlg/bus-committees-third-hwlg-agendas.htm?act=dis&amp;id=64096&amp;ds=11%2F2007 ]&lt;/ref&gt; for a deemed consent or 'soft opt out' to increase the number of organs available for transplantation and save lives. The Human Transplantation Wales Act received Royal Assent on 10 September 2013. &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140808052852/http://wales.gov.uk/newsroom/firstminister/2013/130910assent/?lang=en ]&lt;/ref&gt; The law came into effect on 1 December 2015. In its first year the number of patients waiting for organ donation dropped 38% from 309 in 2010/11 to 193 in 2015/16 and it was said to represent "considerable progress". &lt;ref&gt;https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/health/organ-donation-rates-risen-opt-12022254&lt;/ref&gt; 
In December 2017 Theresa May called for a public consultation to extend the "opt out" law to England in order to reduce organ donation waiting lists &lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/12/families-wishes-could-over-ruled-new-presumed-consent-organ/&lt;/ref&gt; 

He has been a member of the [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain]] since 1973, appointed a Fellow of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society in November 2013.&lt;ref name="rpharms1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpharms.com/what-s-happening-/news_show.asp?id=1036 |title=New RPS Fellows announced &amp;#124; Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPS) |website=Rpharms.com |date=2013-12-20 |accessdate=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2007, Aggarwal was made an OBE in the Queen’s [[Birthday Honours List]] in recognition of his contribution to the pharmaceutical industry and the life of the Asian community in Wales. Roy Thomas, chief Executive of the Kidney Wales charity, told the Western Mail: "He is a very modest man but the honour is more than deserved. He has promoted the need for diversity in business. The Welsh and Asian communities should be proud of him and what he has achieved." &lt;ref&gt;Rowland, Paul.

Retrieved 28 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; As well as English, he speaks Swahili, Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati and Urdu.

==Early Days==

Aggarwal was educated at the Duke of Gloucester Grammar School in Nairobi, Kenya, before his family emigrated to Wales in 1967. He studied A-Levels at [[Bath College]], Somerset, from 1967-1969, then won a place at the Welsh School of Pharmacy at Cardiff University from 1969-1972. He graduated with a B.Pharms (Hons) 2.1 in Pharmacology and joined [[Boots UK]] as a graduate trainee. He rose to become one of the company's youngest-ever regional managers, looking after high-profile stores including Oxford Street, London.&lt;ref name="pharmacy1"&gt;Trainis, Neil. [http://www.pharmacy.biz/Newsdetails.aspx?HeadlineID=691 "Entrepreneurial pharmacy in action"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130219191434/http://www.pharmacy.biz/Newsdetails.aspx?HeadlineID=691 |date=19 February 2013 }} Pharmacy Business. 9 March 2011. Retrieved 28 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On a social visit to Cardiff in 1982, he was introduced to a pharmacy on City Road and decided that he would rather run his own business rather than work for someone else. Resigning from Boots, he bought this first shop. Over the next decade, Aggarwal built up a chain of six pharmacies, and a significant business, in and around Cardiff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aggarwalgroup.co.uk/aggarwal.html "R K Aggarwal: Biography"] Company Website. Retrieved 28 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 Central Pharmacy, which Aggarwal still owns and operates, was awarded the Best in UK Clarins Gold Salons Award.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, Aled. [http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2008/09/10/pharmacist-s-prescription-for-beauty-products-is-named-uk-s-best-91466-21715042/ "Pharmacist’s prescription for beauty products is named UK’s best"] Western Mail. 10 September 2008. Retrieved 28 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He believes the key to good business is in customer service, telling Pharmacy Business (9 March 2011): "I enjoy what I do. I have a lot of happiness in what we achieve. I've always had a strong head for business and I enjoy leadership and keeping customer service levels high. We want to make customers feel how we would want to feel."&lt;ref name="pharmacy1"/&gt;

In 2010 Aggarwal was named UK 2010 Pharmacy Business Entrepreneur of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;Pharmacy Business. [http://www.pharmacy.biz/awards/index.php?page=pbbusinesswinners "Pharmacy Awards Winners 2012"] 25 October 2012. Retrieved 28 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The award was presented by then Secretary of State for Health [[Andrew Lansley]] MP.&lt;ref&gt;Llewellyn-Jones, Robert.

Retrieved 28 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocate for Community Pharmacies==

Aggarwal has been a staunch advocate of the benefits of community pharmacies and the support and advice they can provide to patients.

In November 2009, he wrote: "The community pharmacy network in Wales is made up of more than 700 pharmacies, ranging from the small independent pharmacy to the larger branches of well-known chains. They are located where people work, shop and live and to many they are the most accessible part of the health service. We are all aware of the role the pharmacy plays in providing patients with 60 million-plus prescription medicines every year. But, over the years, more and more people have been recognising community pharmacies as sources of help and advice – particularly about how to lead a healthier lifestyle – and a provider of health checks."&lt;ref&gt;Aggarwal, Raj. [http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/health-news/2009/11/09/welsh-pharmacies-increasing-role-in-sexual-health-support-91466-25120316/ "Welsh pharmacies’ increasing role in sexual health support"] Western Mail. 9 November 2009. Retrieved 28 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also written about the high cost to the public purse for wasted prescription medicines in Wales - that "costs the NHS an estimated £50million a year; enough to fund 350 nurses, 200 hip operations and more than 1,000 coronary bypass operations" - and urged health officials to place more trust in pharmacists, writing: "Wales has the highest prescribing rate per head of population in the UK – 22 items compared to 16 in England – meaning this is a serious issue for the Assembly Government to sort out. There are more than 700 pharmacies across Wales situated where people work, shop and live.

==Honorary Consul for India==

Aggarwal has been a staunch advocate for increasing business links between Wales and other nations, especially India. India is the UK’s fourth largest inward investor, creating 5,889 jobs over the past year. It accounts for around 6% of exports from Wales, worth around £100m. According to the Assembly Government there are more than 2,000 Indian students at Welsh universities. Taking part in a US-Indian-Welsh business symposium in March 2011, Aggarwal said: "Ensuring a commercial link with India and continued investment relations is essential if Wales is to grow on the international stage." &lt;ref&gt;Kelsey, Chris.

Retrieved 28 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, Aggarwal was appointed to the role by India’s High Commissioner Dr Jaimini Bhagwati during a ceremony at Cardiff’s India Centre. Talking to the South Wales Echo, Aggarwal: "This is a special privilege that I and my family will always cherish. Wales is a dynamic small country and stronger links with the rising superpower that is India will be vital to its future prosperity. I’ll work tirelessly to build a deeper engagement between the two countries to which I and many Welsh people owe their allegiance." .&lt;ref name="walesonline1"/&gt;

Welsh First Minister [[Carwyn Jones]] said of the appointment: "Raj isn’t only a personal friend to me but also to Wales. He’s been a tireless advocate for promoting our country as a place to invest and do business and travelled with me to India earlier this year to highlight what we have to offer to Indian companies. I know his appointment as Honorary Consul to Wales will be of great pride to him and I am sure he will do an excellent job."&lt;ref&gt;[http://wales.gov.uk/newsroom/firstminister/2012/120926indiahc/;jsessionid=663EB040B1CEDE2A797F0DF6F13617E8?status=closed&amp;lang=en "First Minister congratulates new Indian representative to Wales"] Welsh Government. 26 September 2012.

In March 2015, at the organisation's Annual General Meeting, Aggarwal was appointed president of the Consular Association of Wales. The role involves working closely with the UK Government, the National Assembly for Wales and the Welsh Government. Aggarwal told Wales Online: "I hope to show all the amazing strengths and fantastic attributes of Wales and its people, its commerce, education, tourism and cultural endeavours."&lt;ref&gt;Blake, Aled.

In the [[United States Navy]], '''Refueling and Overhaul (ROH)''' refers to a lengthy process or procedure performed on [[nuclear-power]]ed naval [[ship]]s, which involves replacement of expended [[nuclear fuel]] with new fuel and a general maintenance fix-up, renovation, and often modernization of the entire ship.  In theory, such a process could simply involve only refueling or only an overhaul, but nuclear refueling is usually combined with an overhaul.  An ROH usually takes one to two years for submarines and up to almost three years for an aircraft carrier, performed at a naval [[shipyard]].  Time periods between ROHs on a ship have varied historically from about 5–20 years (for [[submarine]]s) to up to 25 years (for {{Sclass-|Nimitz|aircraft carrier|2}}s).  For modern submarines and aircraft carriers, ROHs are typically carried out about midway through their operating lifespan.  There are also shorter maintenance fix-ups called ''availabilities'' for ships periodically at shipyards.  A particularly lengthy refueling, maintenance, and modernization process for a nuclear [[aircraft carrier]] can last up to almost three years and be referred to as a '''Refueling Complex Overhaul (RCOH)'''.

==Process==
At a shipyard, a ship to undergo ROH goes into a [[drydock]], which is then closed off from the sea.  Water is evacuated from the drydock with keel blocks pre positioned under the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]], so the ship's keel area will rest on the blocks as the water is pumped out.  At the end of the ROH, the drydock is refilled with water so the ship can be re-floated and removed from the dock.

|}
To start ROH, operating procedures are used to shut down and cool down the propulsion [[power plant]] to bring it to desired temperatures, pressures, and other conditions.  During the ROH, ship's Navy crew stand shutdown watches, and civilian shipyard workers do much of the repair, maintenance, and installation work.  During an ROH, all personnel in a maintenance work area are commonly required to wear a [[hard hat]].

Land-based [[naval reactor]] prototype plants have also undergone similar refueling and overhauls, not at a shipyard but at whatever facility they are located.

===Refueling===
In a nuclear-powered ship, the nuclear fuel is essentially a solid inside a reactor core which is inside the ship's [[nuclear reactor]].  Once a reactor core has gone critical, meaning it has been used during a reactor operation, highly [[radioactive]] [[nuclear fission products]] have formed in the core, and the core has become highly radioactive.  Refueling involves taking the expended core out of the reactor and putting in a new core with fresh nuclear fuel.  Because it is so radioactive, removing a core with spent nuclear fuel from a reactor requires elaborate radiological handling precautions.  All materials that came in contact with the critical core, including the internal surfaces and [[Nuclear reactor coolant|coolant water]], are considered  [[Radioactive contamination|radioactively contaminated]] and require special radiological handling and disposal precautions.  In addition to radiological training and qualification required for working in radiation areas or with radioactive materials or contamination, [[Ionizing radiation|radiation exposure]] to workers is monitored to ensure maximum exposure limits are not exceeded.

===Overhaul===
The overhaul commonly includes extensive maintenance and renovation work and checks of various systems and equipment aboard the [[ship]].  A&amp;nbsp;major overhaul also typically includes upgrading various systems and equipment to modernize them; for example, old [[Analog electronics|analog electrical]] equipment may be replaced by new [[Digital electronics|digital electronic]] equipment.  The work for such overhauls is typically planned out by [[engineer]]s well in advance and new equipment is obtained for any replacements or installations.

An example of renovation work done during refueling and overhauls of submarines is the conversion of a [[fleet ballistic missile submarine]] (SSBN) to a [[guided missile submarine]] (SSGN).  Such a conversion consists of taking the 24 [[ballistic missile]]s and their silos out of the missile section in the submarine, and replacing them with 154 [[Tomahawk cruise missile]]s and special operations force insertion platforms which can carry up to 66 special operations personnel.  The first four {{sclass-|Ohio|submarine|2}}s have undergone such conversions during their midlife refueling and overhauls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cst/csat27.pdf Unmanned Undersea Vehicles And Guided Missile Submarines: Technological and Operational Synergies]&lt;/ref&gt;  For more details, see {{section link|Ohio-class submarine|SSBN/SSGN conversions}}.
[[File:OHIOSSGNCONVERSION.JPG|thumb|center|540px|{{USS|Ohio|SSGN-726|6}} in drydock undergoing conversion to SSGN]]
During an overhaul, an extensive testing program is conducted.  Numerous test procedures that have been written are followed, data is recorded as required, and logs of the testing are kept.  Tests that can be conducted include: [[Industrial radiography|radiography]] to test critical [[Welding|welds]], testing of fluid systems and other pressure boundaries which includes [[hydrostatic test]]ing to detect any [[leak]]s, and testing of electrical and mechanical setpoints for various types of equipment such as sensor input setpoints for various kinds of automatic trips and [[safety valve]] relief pressure setpoints.  At the finish of the ROH, the testing data records are bound and retained as a permanent documentation record resulting from the ROH.

As the ship is readied, toward the end of the ROH, the power plant is warmed or brought back up to the desired [[operating temperature]] and pressure so it can be  started when ready.

==Refueling and Complex Overhaul==
'''Refueling and Complex Overhaul (RCOH)''' is a process for refueling and upgrading [[Nimitz class aircraft carrier|nuclear-powered aircraft carrier]]s in the [[United States Navy|US Navy]]. The [[nuclear reactors]] that power some aircraft carriers typically use up their [[nuclear fuel]] about halfway through their desired 50-year life spans. Because carriers can last so long before being retired, they are refueled and refurbished with an RCOH to extend their usable lifetime. At the same time a ship is refueled, it is given a complex overhaul in which broken, worn or obsolete parts are repaired or replaced and systems are modernized. The modernization typically includes an upgrade of ship’s [[combat systems]] and warfighting capabilities, its internal distribution systems are upgraded, and allowance is made for future upgrades over the ship’s remaining operational service life.  Given the size of an aircraft carrier and the number of systems and subsystems it has, an RCOH is extremely complex, costly (several billion dollars), and time-consuming. Each RCOH is planned to take 46 months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/cvn-68-mods.htm CVN-68 Nimitz-class Modernization]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/uss-theodore-roosevelt-headed-into-midlife-overhaul-02810/ USS Theodore Roosevelt Headed Into Mid-Life Overhaul]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nn.northropgrumman.com/capabilities/rco.html Refueling and Complex Overhaul]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''side letter''' or '''side agreement''' is a [[collective bargaining]] agreement that is not part of the underlying or primary [[collective bargaining agreement]] (CBA) which the parties to the [[contract]] use to reach agreement on issues the CBA does not cover, to clarify issues in the CBA, or to modify the CBA (permanently or temporarily).  One may distinguish side letters from "side settlements" or "settlement agreements", which settle a dispute arising from the underlying CBA.&lt;ref name="CooperTire"&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/circs/6th/054641p.pdf ''United Steelworkers of America v.

Bethesda, Maryland: Education Week Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-9674795-4-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the law of contracts, a side letter has the same force as the underlying contract.&lt;ref name="CooperTire" /&gt; However, the courts may invalidate side letters in conflict with the main collective bargaining agreement.&lt;ref&gt;"Eighth Circuit Invalidates Side Letter Agreement Conflicting With Collective Bargaining Agreement". ''Benefits &amp; Compensation Legal &amp; Legislative Reporter.'' October 2004; ''Trustees of the Graphic Communication International Union, Local 1B Health and Welfare Fund "A" v. Tension Envelope Corporation,'' [[case citation|374 F.3d 633]] (8th Cir. 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The terms of the CBA govern interpretation of side letters.  In the United States, several [[United States courts of appeals|appellate courts]] have held that in disputes where side letters do not contain [[conflict resolution]] procedures, the parties must use the underlying collective bargaining agreement's dispute resolution mechanism (in these cases, [[arbitration]]) to resolve the dispute.&lt;ref name="CooperTire" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/tmp/FH0OGU6E.pdf ''United Steelworkers v. Trimas Corporation]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }},'' No. 07-1688 (7th Cir. July 3, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dube"&gt;Dube, Lawrence E. "Court Orders Arbitration on Neutrality Pact, But Says NLRB May Have to Decide Legality". ''Daily Labor Report.'' September 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The range of issues side letters covers is wide. In some cases, side letters have driven national [[labour law]] policy. For example, in the United States, a side letter guaranteeing employer neutrality during union elections in newly acquired plants, subsidiaries, or divisions led to a federal lawsuit over the legality of the agreement in 2002 and a major decision by the [[National Labor Relations Board]] revising federal labour policy in 2007.&lt;ref name="Dube" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Int'l Union v. Dana Corp.,'' [[case citation|278 F.3d 548]] (6th Cir. 2002); Gross, Jared S. "Recent Developments: International Union v. Dana Corp." ''Ohio State Journal on Dispute Resolution.'' 2003; Moody, Kim.

''U.S. Law Week.'' October 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]], side letters are becoming increasingly common due to the changes in federal labour law the [[WorkChoices]] Act created. WorkChoices limits the collective bargaining agreements that parties can register for eligibility for workplace tribunals enforcement, and also requires CBAs be strictly limited to work-related issues. The inclusion of even minor non-workplace-related clauses (such as dues check-off) can render a CBA unenforceable. In response, many unions and employers are using side letters to reach agreement on non-workplace-related matters, and not registering these side-letters with the federal government—relying on [[common law]] to enforce the side letters.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Andrew and Riley, Joellen.

[[File:Tiit Vähi teisel Arvamusfestivalil Narvas.jpg|thumb|Tiit Vähi (2016)]]
'''Tiit Vähi''' (born 10 January 1947) is an [[Estonia]]n politician who was [[Prime Minister of Estonia]] from 1995 to 1997. He was also [[acting Prime Minister]] for several months during 1992 under the [[transitional government]].

==Life and career==
Born in [[Kaagjärve vald|Kaagjärve parish]],&lt;ref&gt;http://valgamaalane.postimees.ee/3995043/intervjuu-tiit-vaehi-voib-toeoejuttu-ajada-ka-kell-kaks-oeoesel&lt;/ref&gt; Estonia, Vähi graduated from the [[Tallinn Technical University]] with a degree in Engineering. From the time of his graduation until 1992, he served in several top managerial post with the [[Valga Trucking Company]].

During the Estonian national independence movement, Vähi was among the organisers of the [[Estonian Popular Front]], and led its regional committee in [[Valga County]]. In 1989, he was appointed [[Estonian Minister for Transport and Communications|Minister for Transport and Communications]], a post that he held until January 1992. During his tenure as Transport Minister, he forged close ties with the transport ministries of the [[Nordic countries]] and improved relations with the other two [[Baltic States]] on transport related issues. He transferred control of Estonia's airports, railways and sea ports, under the control Moscow, to the Estonian authorities.

Shortly after Estonia's return to independence in 1991, Vähi was appointed as the Government's special representative to north-eastern Estonia, a region inhabited by a majority of ethnic [[Russians]].

On 30 January 1992, Vähi became the second post-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Prime Minister of Estonia, succeeding [[Edgar Savisaar]]. During this first stint as Prime Minister, he embarked upon a vast programme to transform the country's economy from its being [[centrally planned economy|centrally controlled]] into a more [[free market economy]]. His government also introduced the Estonian currency, the [[Estonian kroon|Kroon]], in June 1992. He also founded the [[Estonian Privatisation Agency]], which embarked on the privatisation of government-owned assets to the private sector. 
 
As agreed when he assumed the post Prime Minister in the transition government, Vähi did not participate in the parliamentary elections on 20 September 1992.

In 1993, he was elected Chairman of the [[Estonian Coalition Party]]. The parliamentary elections of March 1995 gave victory to the KMÜ coalition, comprising the [[Estonian Coalition Party]] and the [[People's Union of Estonia]] Parties. As leader of the Estonian Coalition Party, Vähi was asked by [[President of Estonia|President]] [[Lennart Meri]] to form a government. Appointed Prime Minister for the second time in his career, he formed a coalition government of the KMÜ and the Estonian Centre Party, which was sworn in on 17 April 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Raun, Toivo U. ''Estonia and the Estonians''. Stanford, Calif: Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-8179-2852-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His second term as Prime Minister was quite rocky. On 11 October 1995 several ministers resigned from the cabinet, causing the [[Estonian Centre Party]] to withdraw from the government coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Tapes Scandal Topples Rulers In Estonia. ''The Washington Post''. 	12 Oct 1995 [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/19419031.html?dids=19419031:19419031&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Oct+12%2C+1995&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=Tapes+Scandal+Topples+Rulers+In+Estonia&amp;pqatl=google link]&lt;/ref&gt;  On 7 November 1995, Vähi reformed the government, this time with the help of the [[Estonian Reform Party]]. This collaboration lasted less than a year; on 20 November 1996, six ministers, including then-[[Estonian Foreign Minister|Foreign Minister]] [[Siim Kallas]], resigned, causing a collapse of the collaboration between the Coalition Party and the Reform Party. On 1 December 1996, Vähi once again reformed the government; however, this time, he only used members of his own party, thus greatly reducing its ability to retain power. On 7 February 1995, Vähi survived a [[no-confidence]] vote, 46–45. Feeling pressure from within his own party, he resigned on 25 February 1997. Three days later, on 27 February, President Lennart Meri named [[Mart Siimann]] as the new Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;Estonia Names New Prime Minister

He is currently a member of the free-market liberal Reform Party but is not active in politics and has concentrated on his career as a businessman. He has expressed opinion that Estonia needs to improve relations with Russia&lt;ref&gt;[https://majandus24.postimees.ee/3747157/vahi-venemaa-vastane-sojatorvik-kahjustab-ari Vähi: Venemaa vastane sõjatõrvik kahjustab äri]&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Trademark Clearinghouse''' is a database of validated and registered trademarks established by [[ICANN]] to assist [[trademark]] holders prevent infringing behavior in the [[Domain Name System]]. In combination with the Uniform Rapid Suspension System (URS), it is the second significant attempt by ICANN to handle the "Trademark Dilemma".&lt;ref name=TM_Dilemma /&gt; The first attempt was the [[Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy]].

The Trademark Clearinghouse is not a trademark office. Rights holders who register their marks with the Trademark Clearinghouse must still register with their country's trademark office. The primary purpose of the Trademark Clearinghouse is to maintain a global database of verified trademarks for the [[Domain Name System]].&lt;ref name="TMCH_FAQ" /&gt;

The Trademark Clearinghouse is strictly for [[second-level domain]] names. Other mechanisms exist to protect trademark in the [[Generic top-level domain|new gTLDs]] themselves.&lt;ref name=Explaining_TMCH_to_businesses /&gt; All new gTLD registries are required to use the Trademark Clearinghouse and URS for protection of Second-level domains.&lt;ref name="TMCH_FAQ" /&gt;

==History==
One of the initial tasks of ICANN when it was formed was to deal with the so-called "Trademark Dilemma",&lt;ref name=TM_Dilemma /&gt;&lt;ref name=TM_Dilemma_2 /&gt; which is determining the appropriate balance of rights between domain name holders and trademark owners. So in December 1999 ICANN launched the [[Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy]]. Starting in 2008&lt;ref name=ICANN_GTLD_RFP /&gt; ICANN began a new program to launch many more new [[Generic top-level domain]]s. As part of this program ICANN envisioned a replacement program for the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy.

On March 6, 2009 ICANN commissioned 18 intellectual property experts from around the world entitled the Implementation Recommendation Team (IRT). They produced a report on May 29, 2009 with numerous recommendations to protect intellectual property rights holders. Most importantly, the report recommended an Intellectual Property Clearinghouse be created in concert with a Uniform Rapid Suspension System (URS).&lt;ref name=IRT_report /&gt;

The recommendation of the Intellectual Property Clearinghouse became the basis for the Trademark Clearinghouse and together with the URS eventually replaced the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy.

On May 28, 2010 ICANN published the Trademark Clearinghouse Proposal.&lt;ref name=TMCH_prop /&gt; The proposal emerged from an ICANN meeting held in Nairobi between the 7th and 12 March 2010. In the proposal both the Trademark Clearinghouse and the Universal Rapid Suspension program were proposed as possible replacements for the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy.

In November 2012 ICANN organized meetings in Los Angeles and Brussels to consider the implementation of the Trademark Clearinghouse for new top level domains.&lt;ref name=Robin_Gross_IGP /&gt; The outcome of these meetings was a [[straw man proposal]] for the Trademark Clearinghouse.&lt;ref name=strawman /&gt;

In March 2013 the Trademark Clearinghouse launched.&lt;ref name=TMCH_launch_Tuesday /&gt;

===Controversy===
The new gTLD program initially faced heavy criticism from many brand owners. Specifically, the [[Association of National Advertisers]] created an organization called Coalition for Responsible Internet Domain Oversight (CRIDO)&lt;ref name=CRIDO /&gt; and began lobbying ICANN to halt the new gTLD rollout. The brand owners saw the creation of more gTLDs as a further cost to protect their trademarks from [[cybersquatting]]. They wanted strong trademark protections built into the new gTLD program.&lt;ref name=ANA_Letter_1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ANA_Letter_2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ANA_Letter_3 /&gt;

Milton Mueller, a professor at Syracuse University and frequent critic of ICANN, argues that the creation of the Trademark Clearinghouse was entirely hijacked by the advertising and intellectual property stakeholders, primarily by groups like the Association of National Advertisers (ANA). He argues that ICANN staff ignored its established bottom up processes when it did not suit them, and instead implemented the straw man proposal against the wishes of the Generic Names Supporting Organization (GNSO), Noncommercial Stakeholders Group (NCSG), and numerous other stakeholders.&lt;ref name=IGP_on_TMCH /&gt;

DNS news site DomainIncite.com has also been critical of the Trademark Clearinghouse development process.&lt;ref name=TMCH_Compromised_Beginnings /&gt;

====Brussels and Los Angeles meetings====
Many non-commercial observers have criticised ICANN for the way in which the Trademark Clearinghouse was developed. Most of this criticism has stemmed from a lack of openness concerning the proceedings at the Los Angeles and Brussels meetings. In response to this criticism ICANN's Ombudsman opened a probe into the closed door nature of these meetings in December 2012.&lt;ref name=Ombudsman_Probe /&gt;

Robin Gross, chair of ICANN's Noncommercial Stakeholders Group (NCSG) claimed that the NCSG was largely ignored during the proceedings, while the Business Constituency and Intellectual Property Constituency were overly represented.&lt;ref name=Robin_Gross_IGP /&gt; Using ICANN's Documentary Information Disclosure Program (DIDP) process, ICANN's version of a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] request, the NCSG requested all information concerning the Los Angeles and Brussels meetings. In response, the NCSG received no new information&lt;ref name=ICANN_accountable /&gt;

The NCSG criticised the Brussels meeting immediately prior to it. In response, Fadi Chehade, CEO of ICANN, explained the purpose of the meeting in Brussels as simply an informal white board brainstorming session.&lt;ref name=ICA_Brussels /&gt; After the meeting Chehade wrote a blog post detailing what happened at the Brussels meeting.&lt;ref name=Chehade_Brussels /&gt;

====Red Cross / Red Crescent====
On June 25, 2014, ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) issued a comminuque entitled, "Protection of Red Cross / Red Crescent Names". The communique exempted the 'terms and names associated with the Red Cross and Red Crescent' from trademark protection while still affording them protected status. The communique advised that the names not be subject to policy considerations relating to trademark, because they cannot receive adequate treatment under trademark law. Instead the permanent protection of these names should be confirmed.&lt;ref name=GAC_on_Red_Cross_Crescent /&gt;

In response, ICANN's Generic Names Supporting Organization (GNSO) suggested the names simply be added to the Trademark Clearinghouse. The matter is still being debated.&lt;ref name=GAC_on_Red_Cross_Crescent /&gt;

==Protection services==
The Trademark Clearinghouse is not a rights protection mechanism itself. Instead, additional mechanisms coupled with the Trademark Clearinghouse help trademark owners protect their rights. There are two special time periods where trademark holders are given special treatment, ongoing notification services, and the URS. There are also differentiated services offered by specific registries. These build on the Trademark Clearinghouse to afford special treatment to trademark holders with verified trademarks in the Trademark Clearinghouse.&lt;ref name="TMCH_FAQ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Basic_Intro_to_TMCH" /&gt;

===Sunrise period===
The sunrise period is a time period immediately prior to the launching of a TLD. Trademark Clearinghouse registrants receive priority access to reserve domain names associated with their trademarks before general access.&lt;ref name="TMCH_FAQ" /&gt; New gTLD registries are required to offer a sunrise period of at least 30 days.&lt;ref name="TMCH_FAQ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Basic_Intro_to_TMCH" /&gt;

===Claims period===
During the claims period registrants attempting to register a second-level domain name under a TLD which utilizes the Trademark Clearinghouse will receive a warning if the name matches an entry in the Trademark Clearinghouse.&lt;ref name="TMCH_Video" /&gt; If the registrant registers the name anyway, the rights owner will receive a notification from the Trademark Claims system.&lt;ref name="TMCH_FAQ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TMCH_Video" /&gt; The claims period is required to last at least 90 days after the initial launch of the new gTLD.&lt;ref name="TMCH_FAQ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Basic_Intro_to_TMCH" /&gt;

===Ongoing notifications===
Rights holders with trademarks registered in the Trademark Clearinghouse can opt in to receive additional notifications after the claims period expires. Holders will be notified of exact matches to names they have registered in the Trademark Clearinghouse. This service is optional and free.&lt;ref name="ongoing" /&gt;

===Domain Protected Marks List===
Domain Protected Marks List (DPML) is a service offered by specific new gTLD registry operators based on the Trademark Clearinghouse. It is not a standard service offered to rights holders registered in the Trademark Clearinghouse, nor is it standardized by ICANN. Different registries will implement DPML differently as a means of marketplace differentiation. Typically registries will offer to defensively block registrations that are more than just exact matches.&lt;ref name=DPML /&gt;

==Uniform Rapid Suspension==

As part of the new gTLD program ICANN developed an accompanying rights protection mechanism for trademark holders called the Uniform Rapid Suspension (URS). Work on the URS started in September 2012 with an RFI issued by ICANN.&lt;ref name=URS_general /&gt; It was finalized in January 2014.&lt;ref name=india_URS /&gt;

The URS is not meant to replace the [[Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy]], but instead complement it. In contrast to the UDRP, the URS is meant as a lightweight, inexpensive, expedited arbitration process for resolving obvious trademark rights violations.&lt;ref name=URS_general /&gt; Unlike the UDRP, successful URS claims only cause a domain name to be suspended and redirected, not seized.&lt;ref name=URS_proc /&gt; Also, the URS is not intended for use where facts are in question.&lt;ref name=URS_proc /&gt; URS decisions can take as little as one week to resolve.&lt;ref name=URS_general /&gt;

Registries and registrars participating in the new gTLD program are required to implement the URS. In the context of the URS, they are called providers.&lt;ref name=URS_general /&gt;

===How it works===
Every URS claim starts with a complaint filed by a trademark holder against a registrant of a domain name they believe to be infringing their trademark.&lt;ref name=URS_proc /&gt; The complainant must also pay a one time non-refundable fee of $375.&lt;ref name=URS_proc /&gt;&lt;ref name=URS_gbu /&gt; Within two days of the complaint being filed an administrative review will be held by the URS provider.

If this review determines the complaint is in proper order the domain name will be locked, preventing changes to the DNS, and the allegedly offending registrant will be notified of the complaint. The registrant then has 14 calendar days to respond to the complaint before the complaint proceeds to default.&lt;ref name=URS_proc /&gt;

After the complaint has been filed and either a response has been received or the complaint has entered default, a single examiner selected by the provider determines the outcome. The examiner should then examine the evidence and issue a verdict using a standard of clear and convincing evidence.&lt;ref name=URS_proc /&gt;

The examiner should find in favor of the complainant if; the registered domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a word mark, the complainant holds a valid and current national or regional registration of the mark in question, this mark is registered and validated in the Trademark Clearinghouse, the registrant has no legitimate right or interest to the domain name, and the domain name was registered and is being used in bad faith. All standards must be met for the examiner to find in favor of the complainant.&lt;ref name=URS_proc /&gt;

If the examiner determines that the domain name is non-infringing use, or a [[Fair use (U.S. trademark law)|fair use]], the complaint should be dismissed.&lt;ref name=URS_proc /&gt; However, the URS guidelines do not define "fair use", nor do they indicate which specific jurisdiction's definition of "fair use" should be used.&lt;ref name=URS_proc /&gt;

===Examples===
In October 2014 the domain names radisson.club and radissonblu.club were suspended using the URS. Saravanan Dhandapani, acting as the first examiner for the National Arbitration Forum (NAF) and the Asian Domain Name Dispute Resolution Centre (ADNDRC), determined these two domain names infringed on the trademark of Radisson hotels.&lt;ref name=india_URS /&gt;

==Pricing==
As of October 2014 registering a single trademark can cost between $95 and $150 for one year. Three year and five year registrations are also available at reduced cost, as are bulk discounts. In general registering a single mark for one year will always be the most expensive option, while registering multiple marks for longer periods will incur greater discount.&lt;ref name=TMCH_Pricing /&gt;

Registries pay a one time fee to register between $7,000 - $10,000.&lt;ref name=registry_cost /&gt;

===Basic fee structure===
The basic fee structure is intended for registering small numbers of marks. It is only available to actual trademark holders, and not trademark agents. No bulk discounts are available, but discounts are given for registering marks for longer periods.&lt;ref name=TMCH_Pricing_Basic /&gt;

* $150 for 1 year
* $435 for 3 years
* $725 for 5 years

===Advanced fee structure===
The advanced fee structure is intended for registering large numbers of marks. It is available for trademark holders and agents, and requires the establishment of a prepayment account. Discounts are available when buying in bulk and when purchasing for longer periods.

The advanced fee structure uses a [[Loyalty program]] to encourage more trademark registrations. Registrants using it gain points for each registration. As more points are earned successive levels are reached, which decrease the cost of the next batch of registrations. In short, the more registrations a registrant makes, and the longer their duration, the cheaper they get.&lt;ref name=TMCH_Pricing_Advanced /&gt;

==Implementation==
ICANN has subcontracted out most of the functionality of the Trademark Clearinghouse to [[IBM]] and [[Deloitte]]. IBM handles the technical implementation, administration and support of the trademark database. Deloitte is responsible for authentication and validation of trademarks.&lt;ref name=TMCH_providers /&gt;

==Use==
On March 25, 2013, the Trademark Clearinghouse claimed it had "delivered over 500,000 Trademark Claims notices and prevented over 475,000 trademarked names from being registered."&lt;ref name=half_million_TM_notices_served /&gt;

Uptake on new [[Generic top-level domain|gTLDs]] has been brisk, with 426 new gTLDs introduced to the Internet as of October 17, 2014.&lt;ref name=gtld_stats /&gt;
