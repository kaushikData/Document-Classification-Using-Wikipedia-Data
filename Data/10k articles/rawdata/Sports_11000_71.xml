      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3433">The '''1912 New Zealand rugby league tour of Australia''' was a tour by the [[New Zealand national rugby league team]]. 
==Squad==
The touring party included, backs; [[Arthur Carlaw]] (vice-captain), [[James Barber (rugby)|James Barber]], [[George Bradley (rugby league)|George Bradley]], [[Billy Curran]], [[Jim Gilmour]], [[Arthur Hardgrave]], [[Bill Kelly (rugby league)|Bill Kelly]], [[Don Kenealy]], [[Lance Moir]], [[Charles Webb (rugby league)|Charles Webb]], [[Stan Weston]] and forwards; [[Arthur Francis (rugby)|Arthur Francis]] (captain), [[Tom Brownlee (rugby league)|Tom Brownlee]], [[Billy Dervan]], [[Charles Dunning (rugby)|Charles Dunning]], [[David Evans (rugby)|Dave Evans]], [[Harold Hayward]], [[Morgan Hayward]], [[Robert Irvine (rugby league)|Robert Irvine]], [[Cecil King (rugby league)|Cecil King]] and [[Jim Rukutai]].

They were managed by Barry Brigham and Tom MacReynolds.

Captain Arthur Francis left the squad before the final game against New South Wales. Francis took up a contract with [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]], leaving on the same boat for England as [[Herb Gilbert]], [[Steve Darmody]] and [[Bill Farnsworth]].&lt;ref name=kiwi100&gt;John Coffey and Bernie Wood, ''The Kiwis: 100 Years of International Rugby League'', Hodder Moa, Auckland, 2007, p.p. 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Fixtures==
Before the tour New Zealand defeated [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] 38-16.&lt;ref name=akl100&gt;Coffey, John and Bernie Wood ''Auckland, 100 years of rugby league, 1909-2009'', 2009. {{ISBN|9781869693664}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand arrived in Sydney after midnight and only 14 hours before kick off of their first match.&lt;ref name=kiwi100/&gt;

The Combined XIII included five players from New South Wales, including [[Dally Messenger]]. However, because the team was organised by the [[Queensland Rugby League]], it is not considered an official [[Australia national rugby league team|Australian]] match.

The players were scheduled to sail immediately after their final game as the [[New Zealand Rugby League]] had organised a match in Wellington. However the players rebelled and demanded a break from their hectic schedule. The NZRL subsequently held an inquest and fined the players 10 shillings each.&lt;ref name=kiwi100/&gt;

The '''1955 Chatham Cup''' was the 28th annual nationwide knockout [[association football|football]] competition in [[New Zealand]].

The competition was run on a regional basis, with regional associations each holding separate qualifying rounds.

Teams taking part in the final rounds are known to have included [[Eastern Suburbs AFC|Eastern Suburbs]] (Auckland), [[Huntly Thistle]], [[Eastern Union]] (Gisborne), [[New Plymouth Old Boys]], [[Napier Rovers]], [[Wanganui Athletic]], [[Kiwi United]] (Manawatu), [[Masterton Athletic]], [[Victoria University (soccer)|Victoria University]], [[Western A.F.C.|Western]] (Christchurch), and [[Roslyn-Wakari]] (Dunedin).

==The 1955 final==
In the final, winger Peter Saunderson became the seventh player to score a finals [[hat-trick]]. Western's total of six goals equalled [[Waterside (Wellington)|Waterside]]'s tally from the [[1940 Chatham Cup|1940 final]], and the aggregate of eight goals also equalled the record set in that final. The game was played in a howling Wellington southerly, and Western made full use of it in the first half, rattling in four goals. John White and [[Alex Davis]] had both scored in the opening dozen minutes, and these were added to by both Saunderson and Stan Ralph. In the second half Anderson and King reduced the deficit to two before Saunderson scored a further brace to seal the win for the southerners.&lt;ref&gt;{{HiltonNZAssoc}} p.72&lt;/ref&gt; King's goal was his sixth in Chatham Cup finals, after a hat-trick in the [[1951 Chatham Cup|1951 Final]] and two more in [[1953 Chatham Cup|1953]].

The '''1976–77 Pittsburgh Penguins season''' was their tenth in the [[National Hockey League]]. They finished third in the [[Norris Division]] for the third season in a row. In the playoffs, the Penguins were eliminated in the first round. Changes occurred in management and ownership. In December 1976, [[Baz Bastien]] replaced [[Wren Blair]] as the club's general manager. The club was sold to shopping mall magnate [[Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr.]] in February 1977.

{{TOClimit|limit=2}}

==Regular season==
Despite the fact that [[Pierre Larouche]], [[Jean Pronovost]] and [[Syl Apps Jr.|Syl Apps]] were unable to reproduce their franchise record-setting offensive output of the previous season the team finished with a similar regular season record on the strength of improved defensive prowess and the goaltending of [[Dunc Wilson]] and [[Denis Herron]], who was re-acquired from the [[Kansas City Scouts]] in the off-season.

General Manager [[Wren Blair]], who had been part of the ownership group which bought the club from the NHL in July 1975 until February 1976, was removed from his position December 3, 1976. Aldege 'Baz' Bastien, the man who had coached the [[American Hockey League]]'s [[Pittsburgh Hornets]] to a [[Calder Cup]] championship in 1967, was named Blair's replacement.

Co-owners [[Al Savill]] and [[Otto Frenzel]] sold the club to shopping mall magnate [[Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr.]] in February 1977, less than two years after having bought the team from the [[National Hockey League|NHL]].

'''Birch Lane''' was a [[rugby league]] ground in [[Bradford]], England. It was the first long term home of [[Bradford Bulls|Bradford Northern]] Rugby League Football Club, who played there for 26 years from 1908 to 1934 before moving to [[Odsal Stadium]].{{sfn|Delaney|1991|p=44}} For a short while it was also home to [[Bradford F.C.]] in their first incarnation as a [[association football|football]] club. Birch Lane was described as "notorious"{{sfn|Ludlam|1969|p=17}} and a "poverty-stricken place"{{sfn|Ludlam|1969|p=19}} and was never popular either with Northern or Bradford F.C. for the short period they were there.

There is also a [[cricket]] ground at Birch Lane which adjoins the site of the rugby ground, home to Bowling Old Lane Cricket Club. This predates the rugby ground and continues in existence to this day.

==History==
[[File:Bowling Old Lane Cricket Club - Birch Lane - geograph.org.uk - 638075.jpg|thumb|right|Bowling Old Lane Cricket Club]]

The four acre field at Birch Lane which was to become the rugby and football ground was originally leased by the [[Bowling]] Old Lane Cricket Club. The plot, which adjoined the cricket ground, was taken on at the start of the 1886/87 season as a home for their counterpart [[rugby football|rugby]] club.&lt;ref name=BradfordFC/&gt;

[[Bradford F.C.]], the city's senior [[association football]] team at the time, spent a season at Birch Lane in 1898/99, when it was banished from its home at [[Park Avenue (stadium)|Park Avenue]]. At that time, the ground was generally referred to as Bowling Old Lane. The arrangement did not last. Birch Lane had poor transport connections and no shelter for supporters. Bradford played their last game at Birch Lane on 8 April 1899 when they beat Hunslet 2–1.&lt;ref name=BradfordFC/&gt; In 1906, the Bowling Old Lane rugby club switched over to [[soccer]].{{sfn|Delaney|1991|p=44}}

Bradford Northern first approached the club to rent the ground shortly after their formation in 1907. However, the offer of £50 rent was refused at an [[Annual general meeting|AGM]] on 31 May of that year and the club based itself at [[Greenfield Stadium, Bradford|Greenfield Athletic Ground]] instead.{{sfn|Delaney|1991|p=44}} The following year, the Bowling Old Lane club relented and offered the field to Northern at a rent of £30. Despite having spent £302 on ground improvements at Greenfield, Northern accepted and approved the move at their AGM of June 1908.{{sfn|Delaney|1991|p=44}}

That summer, an open stand of twelve terraces was built, with a [[News media|press]] hut at its centre. [[Huddersfield Giants|Huddersfield]] were Northern's first visitors on 12 September 1908, when they won 14–11. In August 1913, the capacity of the ground was expanded by 2,000 by moving a boundary fence. Despite this, by 1921 Northern were already finding Birch Lane limiting and were looking for a new home.{{sfn|Delaney|1991|p=44}}

Birch Lane's biggest day was 16 February 1924 when 10,807 saw the first round [[Challenge Cup]] match with [[Dewsbury Rams|Dewsbury]]. The ground was unable to handle crowds of this size though and the wooden fencing around the pitch gave way. Later that year, a new embankment at the Cross Street end increased the capacity to 15,000, but Northern still chose to play major games at [[Valley Parade]], home of [[Bradford City AFC]].{{sfn|Delaney|1991|p=44}} This included a match against the touring [[Australia RL|Australians]].&lt;ref name=LoveRL/&gt;

The open stand was finally covered in January 1929, by which time Northern had agreed to move back to Greenfield, only for the move to fall through due to Northern's precarious finances. A move eventually came in June 1933, when Northern signed a lease with [[Bradford Council]] for the site that was to become [[Odsal Stadium]], the biggest ground in [[England]] outside [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]], still the club's home to this day. This move has been credited with keeping Bradford Northern in business. During their stay at the ground, Northern had only been kept going through 'mile of penny' schemes, bazaars and subscriptions.{{sfn|Ludlam|1969|p=19}} Birch Lane at that time, with "its little stand, its surround of rusty galvanised iron pipe, its insecure unvertical posts and its similarity to a hen-run"{{sfn|Ludlam|1969|p=19}} did little to enhance the club's status. Northern lost their last game at the ground 7–8 to [[St Helens Recreation RLFC|St. Helens Recs]] on 7 April 1934, Tom Winnard scoring the last points at the ground.{{sfn|Delaney|1991|p=44}} Bradford Northern Rugby League Football Club had played at Birch Lane for 26 years from 1908 to 1934.&lt;ref name=BradfordFC/&gt;

Birch Lane continued to be used for [[amateur]] [[rugby league]] for a number of years until eventually it was sold for development. Today, while the adjacent cricket ground remains, the former rugby ground is covered by housing and part of Ryan Street School. A stanchion from the stand could still be found in a neighbouring back garden as late as 1992.{{sfn|Delaney|1991|p=44}}

==Rugby League Tour Matches==
Other than Bradford Northern club games, Birch Lane also saw Bradford play host to international touring teams from [[Australian Kangaroos|Australia]] (sometimes playing as [[Australasia rugby league team|Australasia]]), [[New Zealand Kiwis|New Zealand]] from 1921–1933.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/venues/birch-lane/results.html Birch Lane at Rugby League Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cross Country Canada''' is the governing federation for [[cross-country skiing]] in [[Canada]].

==History==
The first governing body for cross-country skiing in Canada was the Canadian Amateur Skiers Association (CASA), founded in 1920. This body covered all disciplines of skiing; alpine, cross-country and jumping. CASA changed to Canadian Skiers Association (CSA) and in 1969 cross-country skiing separated from the CSA, becoming its own discipline. Biathlon was part of the CCC for 9 years until it left and formed its own governing body. The CCC remains Canada's governing body for cross-country skiing.

'''[[Cyprus]]''' has sent athletes to every [[Olympic Games]] held since 1980. Cyprus earned its first [[Olympic Games#Olympic champions and medalists|Olympic medal]] in the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] when [[Pavlos Kontides]] earned a silver medal in the [[Sailing at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's Laser class|men's laser sailing event]]. They had a near miss at the 2008 Olympics when [[Antonis Nikolaidis]] lost the bronze medal shoot-off in [[Shooting at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's skeet|men's skeet]]. The first modern Olympian from Cyprus was actually [[Anastasios Andreou]] in 1896, who competed under the [[Greece at the 1896 Summer Olympics|Greek]] flag.  At this time, Cyprus was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[colony]].

Because the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] is [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|not internationally recognized]] by any major authority (including the IOC), it has no Olympic committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northcyprusonline.com/North-Cyprus-Online-Entertainment.php Occupied Cyprus, Interest Tourism, Scuba Diving, Paintball, Horse Riding, Karting&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, all Cypriot Olympians are required to compete under the name and flag of the [[Republic of Cyprus]]. Those who are unable or unwilling to compete under the flag of the Republic either compete for Turkey,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.obv.org.uk/news-blogs/meliz-redif-make-olympic-history&lt;/ref&gt; or for another country, or not at all.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6134">The '''European Senior Chess Championship''' is a [[chess]] tournament for senior chess players organised by the [[European Chess Union]]  (ECU). Beginning in 2001, entry was open to men aged sixty or over (60+) by January 1 of the year the tournament starts. The corresponding, women's category had an age restriction of fifty years or over (50+). 

In 2014 the competition was split into separate tournaments for the age categories of 65+ and 50+ and these age restrictions were unified across both genders. The format of each tournament is a 9-round [[Swiss system|Swiss]], the overall winners being awarded the respective titles of "European Senior Chess Champion" and "European Senior Women's Chess Champion" in each age category. Similar titles are awarded for rapidplay and blitz, but these are not shown below.

==Classification==
The female athlete triad is a syndrome of three interrelated conditions. Thus, if an athlete is suffering from one element of the Triad, it is likely that she is suffering from the other two components of the triad as well.&lt;ref name="What is the Triad"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Triad?|url=http://www.femaleathletetriad.org/for-athletes-coaches/what-is-the-triad/|publisher=Female Athlete Triad Coalition|accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the increase in female participation in sports, much of it attributable to [[Title IX]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thein-Nissenbaum|first=Jill|last2=Hammer|first2=Erin|date=2017-04-04|title=Treatment strategies for the female athlete triad in the adolescent athlete: current perspectives|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5388220/|journal=Open Access Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=8|pages=85–95|doi=10.2147/OAJSM.S100026|issn=1179-1543|pmc=5388220|pmid=28435337}}&lt;/ref&gt; legislation in the United States, the incidence of a triad of disorders particular to women — the female athlete triad—has also increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gottschlich|first=Laura|title=The Female Athlete Triad|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/89260-overview|publisher=Medscape|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this increasing prevalence, the female athlete triad and its relationship with athletics was identified in the 1980s as the symptoms, risk factors, causes and treatments were studied in depth and their relatedness evaluated. The condition is most common in cross country running, gymnastics, and figure skating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=De Souza |first=Mary Jand |title=The Female Athlete Triad |url=http://www.powerbar.com/articles/161/the-female-athlete-triad-a-new-model-for-female-athletes-health.aspx |publisher=Powerbar |accessdate=14 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324134319/http://www.powerbar.com/articles/161/the-female-athlete-triad-a-new-model-for-female-athletes-health.aspx |archivedate=24 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those who suffer from the triad are involved in some sort of athletics, in order to promote weight loss and leanness. The competitive sports that promote this physical leanness may result in disordered eating, and be responsible for the origin of the Female Athlete Triad. For some women, not balancing the needs of their bodies and their sports can have major consequences.&lt;ref name="KidsHealth"&gt;{{cite web|title=Female Athlete Triad|url=http://kidshealth.org/teen/food_fitness/sports/triad.html|publisher=KidsHealth|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, for some competitive female athletes, problems such as low self-esteem, a tendency toward perfectionism, and family stress place them at risk for disordered eating.&lt;ref name="KidsHealth"/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Clinical symptoms of the Triad may include disordered eating, fatigue, hair loss, cold hands and feet, dry skin, noticeable weight loss, increased healing time from injuries (e.g., lingering bruises), increased incidence of bone fracture and cessation of menses.  Affected females may also struggle with low self-esteem and depression.

Upon physical examination, a physician may also note the following symptoms: elevated carotene in the blood, [[anemia]], [[orthostatic hypotension]], electrolyte irregularities, [[hypoestrogenism]], [[Atrophic vaginitis|vaginal atrophy]], and [[bradycardia]].&lt;ref name="Nattiv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hobart"/&gt;

An athlete may show signs of restrictive eating, but not meet the clinical criteria for an eating disorder. She may also display subtle menstrual disturbances, such as a change in menstrual cycle length, anovulation, or luteal phase defects, but not yet have developed complete amenorrhea. Likewise, an athlete's bone density may decrease, but may not yet have dropped below her age-matched normal range. These signs can be considered "occult," as no one symptom may be severe enough to seek medical attention, leaving the Triad to go unnoticed or untreated.&lt;ref name="What is the Triad"/&gt;

===Disordered eating===
{{main|Disordered eating}}
Energy availability is defined as energy intake minus energy expended.  Energy is taken in through food consumption.  Our bodies expend energy through normal functioning as well as through exercise.  In the case of female athlete triad, low energy availability may be due to eating disorders, but not necessarily so. Athletes may experience low energy availability by exercising more without a concomitant change in eating habits, or they may increase their energy expenditure while also eating less.&lt;ref name="Nattiv"/&gt; Disordered eating is defined among this situation due to the low caloric intake or low energy availability.

While most athletes do not meet the clinical criteria to be diagnosed with an eating disorder such as [[anorexia nervosa]] or [[bulimia nervosa]], many will exhibit disordered eating habits such as fasting, as well as avoiding certain types of food the athlete thinks are "bad" (such as foods containing fat).&lt;ref name="KidsHealth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hobart"/&gt; More severe examples of disordered eating habits may include [[binge-eating]]; [[vomiting|purging]]; and the use of diet-pills, [[laxatives]], [[diuretics]], and [[enemas]].&lt;ref name="Nattiv"/&gt;

By restricting their diet, the athlete may worsen their problem of low energy availability. Having low dietary energy from excessive exercise and/or dietary restrictions leaves too little energy for the body to carry out normal functions such as maintaining a regular menstrual cycle or healthy bone density.&lt;ref name="Nattiv"/&gt;

===Amenorrhea===
{{main|Amenorrhea}}
Amenorrhea, defined as the cessation of a woman’s menstrual cycle for more than three months, is the second disorder in the Triad.  Weight fluctuations from dietary restrictions and/or excessive exercise affect the hypothalamus’s output of gonadotropic hormones.  Gonadotropic hormones “stimulate growth of the gonads and the secretion of sex hormones.”&lt;ref&gt;Online Medical Dictionary. 1997. Center for Cancer Education. &lt;http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?action=Search+OMD&amp;query=gonadotropins&gt; Retrieved on 2007-10-24.&lt;/ref&gt;  (e.g. gonadotropin-releasing hormone, lutenizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone.)  These gonadotropic hormones play a role in stimulating estrogen release from the ovaries.  Without estrogen release, the menstrual cycle is disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;Menstruation and the Menstrual Cycle. The National Women’s Health Information Center. 2007. &lt; http://www.4women.gov/FAQ/menstru.htm&gt; Retrieved on 2007-10-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Exercising intensely and not eating enough calories can lead to decreases in estrogen, the hormone that helps to regulate the menstrual cycle. As a result, periods may become irregular or stop altogether.&lt;ref name="KidsHealth"/&gt;

There are two types of amenorrhea.  A woman who has been having her period and then stops menstruating for ninety days or more is said to have secondary amenorrhea.  Primary amenorrhea is characterized by delayed [[menarche]] (the onset of menses during puberty).  Delayed menarche may be associated with delay of the development of secondary sexual characteristics.&lt;ref name="Nattiv"/&gt;

===Osteoporosis===
{{main|Osteoporosis}}
Osteoporosis is defined by the National Institutes of Health as ‘‘a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture.’’&lt;ref&gt;Osteoporosis. 2006. National Institutes of Health. &lt;http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Bone/Osteoporosis/default.asp&gt; Retrieved on 2007-10-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Low estrogen levels and poor nutrition, especially low calcium intake, can lead to osteoporosis, the third aspect of the triad. This condition can ruin a female athlete's career because it may lead to stress fractures and other injuries.&lt;ref name="KidsHealth"/&gt;

Patients with female athlete triad get osteoporosis due to hypoestrogenemia, or low estrogen levels.  With estrogen deficiency, the osteoclasts live longer and are therefore able to resorb more bone. In response to the increased bone resorption, there is increased bone formation and a high-turnover state develops which leads to bone loss and perforation of the trabecular plates.&lt;ref&gt;Ott, Susan. 2007. Estrogen: Mechanism of Bone Action. Department of Medicine University of Washington. &lt; http://courses.washington.edu/bonephys/esteffects.html&gt; Retrieved on 2007-10-24.&lt;/ref&gt;  As osteoclasts break down bone, patients see a loss of bone mineral density.  Low bone mineral density renders bones more brittle and hence susceptible to fracture.  Because athletes are active and their bones must endure mechanical stress, the likelihood of experiencing bone fracture is particularly high.&lt;ref name="Nattiv"/&gt;

Additionally, because those suffering with female athlete triad are also restricting their diet, they may also not be consuming sufficient amounts vitamins and minerals which contribute to bone density; not getting enough [[calcium]] or [[vitamin D]] further exacerbates the problem of weak bones.&lt;ref name="Hobart"/&gt;

Bone mass is now thought to peak between the ages of 18-25.  Thus, behaviors which result in low bone density in youth could be detrimental to an athlete’s bone health throughout her lifetime.&lt;ref name="Hobart"/&gt;

In addition, ovulation is the primary way that females create the hormone progesterone. When an ovum is released from the ovary, the structure that remains develops into the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum emits the hormone progesterone during the 10-16 days of the luteal phase. Without experiencing regular, ovulatory menstrual cycles, the female is not secreting the hormone progesterone during the luteal phase of her cycle. Progesterone directly stimulates osteoblasts to make new bone. Therefore if the woman is not ovulating, she is not creating progesterone, and misses out on this opportunity to stimulate new bone growth. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmc = 2968416|year = 2010|last1 = Seifert-Klauss|first1 = V.|title = Progesterone and Bone: Actions Promoting Bone Health in Women|journal = Journal of Osteoporosis|volume = 2010|pages = 1–18|last2 = Prior|first2 = J. C.|pmid = 21052538|doi = 10.4061/2010/845180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
[[Gymnastics]], [[figure skating]], [[ballet]], [[Diving (sport)|diving]], [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]], and [[Long-distance track event|long distance running]] are examples of sports which emphasize low body weight.&lt;ref name="Hobart"/&gt; The Triad is seen more often in aesthetic sports such as these versus ball game sports.&lt;ref name="Hobart"/&gt; Women taking part in these sports may be at an increased risk for developing female athlete triad.&lt;ref name="Hobart"/&gt;

Athletes at greatest risk for low energy availability are those who restrict dietary energy intake, who exercise for prolonged periods, who are vegetarian, and who limit the types of food they will eat.&lt;ref name="Medicine &amp; Science"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=American College of Sports Medicine|title=The Female Athlete Triad|journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise|volume=39|issue=10|pages=1867–1882|doi=10.1249/mss.0b013e318149f111|pmid=17909417|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many factors appear to contribute to disordered eating behaviors and clinical eating disorders.&lt;ref name="Medicine &amp; Science"/&gt; Dieting is a common entry point and interest has focused on the contribution of environmental and social factors, psychological predisposition, low self-esteem, family dysfunction, abuse, biological factors, and genetics.&lt;ref name="Medicine &amp; Science"/&gt; Additional factors for athletes include early start of sport-specific training and dieting, injury, and a sudden increase in training volume. Surveys show more negative eating attitude scores in athletic disciplines favoring leanness.&lt;ref name="Medicine &amp; Science"/&gt; Disordered eating behaviors are risk factors for eating disorders.&lt;ref name="Medicine &amp; Science"/&gt;

==Treatment==
The underlying cause of the female athlete triad is an imbalance between energy taken into the body (through [[food energy|nutrition]]) and energy used by the body (through exercise).&lt;ref name="AMSSMfive"&gt;{{Citation |author1 = American Medical Society for Sports Medicine |author1-link = American Medical Society for Sports Medicine |date = 24 April 2014 |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = American Medical Society for Sports Medicine |work = [[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-medical-society-for-sports-medicine/ |accessdate = 29 July 2014}}, which cites

Because a symptom of the female athlete triad is menstrual dysfunction, some physicians may recommend [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|oral contraceptives]] because those pills will regulate the menstrual cycle.&lt;ref name="AMSSMfive"/&gt; However, the underlying cause of the menstrual disorder is an energy imbalance, and using pills to regulate the menstrual cycle without changes in diet and behavior is likely to mask the food deficiency and delay appropriate treatment.&lt;ref name="AMSSMfive"/&gt; A woman taking contraceptives to treat menstrual dysfunction without correcting this energy imbalance will continue to lose bone density.&lt;ref name="AMSSMfive"/&gt;

===Less exercise===
Continued participation in training and competition depends on the physical and mental health of the athlete.&lt;ref name="Health-Related Concerns"/&gt; Athletes who weigh less than 80 percent of their ideal body weight may not be able to safely participate.&lt;ref name="Health-Related Concerns"/&gt;

Persons with female athlete triad are often asked by health care providers to reduce the amount of time they spend exercising by 10-12 percent.&lt;ref name="Hobart"/&gt;

===Eating more===
Low energy availability with or without eating disorders, functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, and osteoporosis, alone or in combination, pose significant health risks to physically active girls and women. Prevention, recognition, and treatment of these clinical conditions should be a priority of those who work with female athletes to ensure that they maximize the benefits of regular exercise.&lt;ref name="Medicine &amp; Science"/&gt;

Patients are recommended to work with a dietician who can monitor their nutritional status and help the patient work towards a healthy goal weight.&lt;ref name="Hobart"/&gt; Patients should also meet with a psychiatrist or psychologist to address the psychological aspects of the triad.&lt;ref name="Hobart"/&gt; Therefore, it is important that trainers and coaches are made aware of the athlete’s condition and be part of her recovery.&lt;ref name="Hobart"/&gt;

===Medicine===
Patients are also sometimes treated pharmacologically. To both induce menses and improve bone density, doctors may prescribe cyclic [[estrogen]] or [[progesterone]] as is used to treat post-menopausal women.&lt;ref name="Hobart"/&gt; Patients may also be put on oral contraceptives to stimulate regular periods.&lt;ref name="Hobart"/&gt; In addition to hormone therapy, nutrition supplements may be recommended.&lt;ref name="Hobart"/&gt; Doctors may prescribe calcium supplements.  Vitamin D supplements may be also used because this vitamin aids in calcium absorption.&lt;ref name="Hobart"/&gt; [[Bisphosphonates]] and [[calcitonin]], used to treat adults with osteoporosis, may be prescribed, although their effectiveness in adolescents has not yet been established.&lt;ref name="Hobart"/&gt; Finally, if indicated by a psychiatric examination, the affected athlete may be prescribed anti-depressants and in some cases benzodiazepines to help in alleviating severe distress at mealtimes.&lt;ref name="Hobart"/&gt;

==Prognosis==
Sustained low energy availability, with or without disordered eating, can impair health. Psychological problems associated with eating disorders include low self-esteem, depression, and anxiety disorders. Medical complications involve the cardiovascular, endocrine, reproductive, skeletal, gastrointestinal, renal, and central nervous systems. The prognosis for anorexia nervosa is grave with a six-fold increase in standard mortality rates compared to the general population. In one study, 5.4% of athletes with eating disorders reported suicide attempts. Although 83% of anorexia nervosa patients partially recover, the rate of sustained recovery of weight, menstrual function and eating behavior is only 33%.&lt;ref name="Medicine &amp; Science"/&gt;

Amenorrheic women can be infertile, due to the absence of ovarian follicular development, ovulation, and luteal function. Consequences of hypoestrogenism seen in amenorrheic athletes include impaired endothelium-dependent arterial vasodilation, which reduces the perfusion of working muscle, impaired skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and vaginal dryness.&lt;ref name="Medicine &amp; Science"/&gt;

Due to low bone mineral density that declines as the number of missed menstrual cycles accumulates, and the loss of BMD may not be fully reversible. Stress fractures occur more commonly in physically active women with menstrual irregularities and/or low BMD with a relative risk for stress fracture two to four times greater in amenorrheic than eumenorrheic athletes. Fractures also occur in the setting of nutritional deficits and low BMD.&lt;ref name="Medicine &amp; Science"/&gt;

==Society and culture==
The American Academy of Pediatrics and the AAFP contend that exercise is important and should be promoted in girls for health and enjoyment, however pediatricians should be wary of health problems that may occur in female athlete.&lt;ref name="Health-Related Concerns"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joy|first=Elizabeth|title=Health-Related Concerns of the Female Athlete|journal=American Family Physician|volume=79|issue=6|pages=489–495|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2009/0315/p489.html|accessdate=14 March 2012|date=2009-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The health related issues concerning this topic are grave and can lead to numerous health issues as previously demonstrated. The treatment plan will depend on the severity of the disorder, however some form of treatment has been shown as helpful to produce successful progress towards a better health condition. Clearly, many health problems arise due to disordered eating.

Coaches are discouraged from active participation in the treatment of eating disorders. In addition to conflicts of interest, coaches may be perceived to pressure athletes and potentially perpetuate components of the Female Athlete Triad. For example, in maintaining a place on the team or continued scholarship support, a female athlete may feel compelled to overtrain or restrict eating.&lt;ref name="Health-Related Concerns"/&gt;

'''Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark''' is a sports stadium in the [[Prenzlauer Berg]] district of [[Berlin]]. It is bordered on the south by Eberswalder Straße, on the north by the [[Max Schmeling]] [[Max-Schmeling-Halle|Halle]], on the west by Mauerpark, where part of the [[Berlin Wall]] once stood. The complex includes a football and athletics stadium as well as several smaller sports fields. The stadium is the second largest in the city after Berlin's [[Olympiastadion (Berlin)|Olympiastadion]] with approximately 20,000 seats, of which 15,000 covered, and has temporarily been used by various Berlin football sides. Following its 2014 advance to the [[Regionalliga Nordost]], [[Berliner FC Dynamo]] is now the main user of the stadium, together with [[Berlin Adler]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fupa.net/berichte/bfc-dynamo-zieht-in-jahn-sportpark-um-137303.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was the venue for the [[2018 World Para Athletics European Championships]].

== History ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-23703-0013, Berlin, Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadion, Tribüne.jpg|thumb|left|Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark (1954)]]

Since 1825, the area was used as the drill grounds of the Guard Regiment of the [[Prussia]]n army. Some housing was constructed on the site late in the 19th century, but this was a short-lived use and the area soon became an open space used for sports. Between 1892 and 1904, the site served as the ground of [[Hertha BSC]]. The city of Berlin purchased the land in 1912 and developed it for sports use in 1913.

After [[World War II]] and the division of the capital city, the area was part of what became [[East Berlin]], in the [[Soviet occupation zone|Soviet zone of occupation]]. A football and athletics stadium, with a capacity of 30,000 spectators, was built on the site in 1951, for use during the World Youth Festival that year. Known initially as Berliner Sportpark, [[East German]] municipal officials renamed the facility the [[Friedrich Ludwig Jahn|Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn]]-Sportpark the following year, to honour the centenary of the birth of the man known in Germany as the father of gymnastics. The stadium was refurbished in 1988 and its capacity reduced to the present-day number.

== Use of the site ==
From 1963 to 1989, the facility hosted the Olympic Day of Athletics competition, modeled on a similar event staged each year in [[West Berlin]]. The meet saw the setting of several world records, including [[Uwe Hohn]]'s record javelin throw of 104.80 meters on 20 July 1984 – the first time a throw of over 100 meters was made.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1982-0915-037, Europapokal, BFC Dynamo-Hamburger SV 1-1.jpg|thumb|left|The European Pokal match between BFC Dynamo and Hamburger SV on 15 September 1982.]]
East German first division club [[Berliner FC Dynamo]] played its [[DDR-Oberliga]] home fixtures here. The wine-reds celebrated nine of its ten consecutive championships (1979 through 1988) in the stadium, except for the 1986/87 season when the stadium was under reconstruction. In the 1970s and 1980 [[Berliner FC Dynamo|BFC]] hosted teams such as [[Red Star Belgrade|Red Star]], [[Aston Villa]], [[Hamburger SV]], [[AS Roma]], [[Werder Bremen]] and [[Girondins Bordeaux]] for its [[European Cup]] matches in the stadium.

The [[East Germany national football team|national side]] played ten international matches at the stadium between 1951 and 1990, including its 13 March 1974 contest versus [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], which ended with a 5–2 victory in front of a record 30,000 spectators.

The stadium was used by the [[Berlin Thunder]] of the [[NFL Europe]] during 1999-2002. The amateur side of Hertha BSC ([[Hertha BSC II]]) also use the facility, when they expect an unusually large crowd or where there are security concerns related to a match. The final of the Berlin Cup is also held here each season.

In 2006 [[Hertha BSC]] played its [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] semi-final match against [[FK Moscow]] (0–0) here, as well as its [[UEFA Cup]] qualification home contest against [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] club [[FC Ameri Tbilisi]] (1–0). In 2016 Hertha played their Europa League qualification match against Brondby at the stadium and won 1-0, however Hertha lost the corresponding fixture away from home 3-1 and were knocked out of the competition.

The facility also serves as a concert venue and has welcomed performers such as [[Michael Jackson]] during his [[Dangerous World Tour]] on 4 September 1992, which was watched by 35.000 people.

In May 2001 stadium hosted the [[2001 Speedway Grand Prix of Germany]], first GP event at temporary track. The Grand Prix was won by Pole [[Tomasz Gollob]], top German rider, [[Robert Barth (speedway rider)|Robert Barth]], finished 14th.

In Juli 2014 it was announced that the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was chosen as the venue for the [[2014–15 UEFA Women's Champions League|2015 UEFA Women's Champions League Final]]. The final was held on 14 May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uefa.com/womenschampionsleague/news/newsid=2123817.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium is also regularly used for [[American football]] and serves as the home venue for the [[Berlin Adler]]. It is also the annual venue of the [[German Bowl]] since 2012 and was the site of the 2014 [[Eurobowl]] final, where the Berlin Adler defeated the New Yorker Lions 20-17.

== Future redevelopment==
The stadium is considered to be in a state of decay, satisfying neither current needs nor future plans. In order to host the 2015 UEFA Women's Champions League final, the stadium was temporary renovated at an estimated cost of €1.5 million - €2 million. This temporary renovation included new paintwork, refurbished player and visitor facilities, a new fire alarm system and a new lawn. That was however only the beginning, as the entire area is planned for a future complete redevelopment.

The area is highly popular and the needs for sporting facilities in Berlin are many. Even when the stadium is empty, the area around is crowded. The neighboring Mauerpark is popular among the citizens of Berlin. Its flea market attracts more than 40,000 visitors each Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bardow |first=Dominik |date=11 August 2014 |title=Was wird aus dem Jahnsportpark? - Wende im Gelände |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/sport/berlinsport/was-wird-aus-dem-jahnsportpark-bald-koennten-zwischen-mauerpark-und-jahnsportpark-welten-aufeinandertreffen/10312264-2.html |language=German |newspaper=[[Der Tagesspiegel]] |publisher=Verlag Der Tagesspiegel GmbH |location=[[Berlin]] |access-date=31 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The population pressure of [[Prenzlauer Berg]] is also high, with [[Pankow]] having the highest birth rate in Berlin.&lt;ref name ="umbauplane"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bardow |first=Dominik |date=11 August 2014 |title=Umbaupläne: Jahnsportpark soll barrierefrei werden |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/sport/berlinsport/umbauplaene-jahnsportpark-soll-barrierefrei-werden/10312268.html |language=German |newspaper=[[Der Tagesspiegel]] |publisher=Verlag Der Tagesspiegel GmbH |location=[[Berlin]] |access-date=1 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the plans, more than 40 users of sport facilities in Berlin have been interviewed.&lt;ref name ="umbauplane"/&gt;

Being the second largest stadium in the city, in terms of seating capacity, and with the [[Olympiastadion (Berlin)|Olympic Stadium]] often considered too large, the stadium also plays a crucial role for the possibility of arranging major sports events in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wenck |first=Dietmar |date=17 August 2013 |title=Jahn-Sportpark soll für 30 Millionen Euro saniert warden |url=http://www.morgenpost.de/sport/berlin-sport/article119120450/Jahn-Sportpark-soll-fuer-30-Millionen-Euro-saniert-werden.html |language=German |newspaper=[[Berliner Morgenpost]] |publisher=Berliner Morgenpost GmbH |location=[[Berlin]] |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A redeveloped stadium would fit in Germany's bid for hosting the [[2024 Summer Olympics]] or  [[2028 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name ="umbauplane"/&gt; If Berlin is awarded the 2024 Summer Olympics, the stadium is planned to be the center of the Paralympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stadionwelt.de/sw_stadien/index.php?folder=sites&amp;site=news_detail&amp;news_id=11502 |title=Umbaupläne für Berliner Jahn-Sportpark |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=23 January 2015 |website=stadionwelt.de |publisher=Stadionwelt, Sole trader: Thomas Krämer |language=German |access-date=31 October 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a preliminary draft concept, the redeveloped Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark is to be an inclusion sports facility, which goes beyond simple [[accessibility]]. The plan includes new office spaces for associations and clubs in the grandstand of the stadium and in new buildings, and possibly a new sports hall for clubs and schools with two or three pitches, one or two artificial turf fields, additional tennis, beach volleyball and beach football fields. Further plans includes a day care center and a car park that could possibly also serve the popular [[Max-Schmeling-Halle]].&lt;ref name ="umbauplane"/&gt;

In January 2015, it was reported that the entire cost for the redevelopment of the whole area was estimated at up to €150 million. The redeveloped stadium will have a capacity of 20,000 spectators and offer future [[2. Bundesliga|second division]] fit. The stadium will have soil heating, completely new seats, fully covered stands and become barrier-free. The distinctive floodlights will be preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Biekler |first1=Sabine |last2=Loy |first2=Thomas |date=22 January 2015 |title=Olympia: 150 statt 30 Millionen Euro für Jahn-Sportpark |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/was-kosten-die-spiele-in-berlin-olympia-150-statt-30-millionen-euro-fuer-jahn-sportpark/11262114.html |language=German |newspaper=[[Der Tagesspiegel]] |publisher=Verlag Der Tagesspiegel GmbH |location=[[Berlin]] |access-date=31 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015 it was reported by the [[Berliner Zeitung]] that the [[Senate of Berlin]] wants to rebuild the stadium, and that the reconstruction could begin at earliest in 2018 and be completed by 2023.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Aulich |first=Uwe |date=2 February 2015 |title=Jahn-Sportpark wird auch ohne Olympia neu gebaut |url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/berlin/berlin-prenzlauer-berg-jahn-sportpark-wird-auch-ohne-olympia-neu-gebaut,10809148,29782856.html |language=German |newspaper=[[Berliner Zeitung]] |publisher=Berliner Verlag GmbH |location=[[Berlin]] |access-date=31 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, German media reported that the senate is planning to invest €170 million in the redevelopment of the area, including €85 million for a new stadium, and that the current stadium will be demolished by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Koch-Klaucke |first=Norbert |date=23 February 2017 |title=Senat pumpt 170 Mio. in den Sportpark in Prenzlauer Berg |url=http://www.berliner-kurier.de/berlin/kiez---stadt/fit-for-jahn-senat-pumpt-170-mio--in-den-sportpark-in-prenzlauer-berg-25797008 |language=German |newspaper=[[Berliner Kurier]] |location=Berlin |publisher=Berliner Verlag GmbH |access-date=6 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''G. M. C. Balayogi Athletic Stadium''' is a multipurpose [[stadium]] situated in the [[Gachibowli]] suburb of [[Hyderabad, Telangana]], [[India]].  It is used mostly for [[association football]] matches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Gachibowli-stadium-now-open-for-non-sporting-events/articleshow/9425840.cms Gachibowli stadium now open for non-sporting events]&lt;/ref&gt;  The stadium holds 32,000 people and contains an 8-lane 400m running synthetic athletic track, a 10-lane 100m sprinting track and a 4-lane synthetic warm-up track. Inside the athletic tracks lies a Football field 105m x 68m in size. Built at a cost of Rs. 35.30 crores, this stadium has built-up area of 14,850 m² (3.67 acres).

==Structure==
The highlight of the stadium is the cantilevered roof covering the spectator stands. The simple yet innovative structural design allows a 25m span cantilever allowing the spectators an unobstructed view of the sporting events.
Diagonal yellow steel structural members act as tension members to balance out the forces of the cantilevered roof of the spectator stands. These members not only add to the exterior appearance, but also help in creation of a well-defined ambulatory path along the stadium.
Orange coloured corrugated metal sheets wrap around the inner and outer edges of the roof trusses. This inexpensive cladding enhances the appearance of the stadium greatly.{{Fact or opinion|date=February 2018}}

==West block==
Most of the services and administrative areas of the stadium are hosted in the west block. The west block also contains the entrance porch and lobby.
The facilities hosted in the west block are:
* Public address system
* Media Centre &amp; Press Box
* 3 service and one players’ entrance
* Score board control &amp; Games management room
* Lighting control rooms
* Public address &amp; announcement rooms
* VIP lounges, pantries &amp; toilets
* Office &amp; conference rooms

|The [[Queen's Indian Defense|Queen's Indian Defence]] is a hypermodern opening for Black.
}}
'''Hypermodernism''' is a [[Schools of chess|school]] of [[chess]] that emerged after [[World War I]]. It featured challenges to the chess ideas of central European masters, including [[Wilhelm Steinitz]]'s approach to the centre and the rules established by [[Siegbert Tarrasch]]. 

==Overview==
The Hypermoderns demonstrated their new ideas with games and victories. [[Aron Nimzowitsch]] showed that games could be won through indirect [[Control of the center#Control of the center|control of the center]], breaking with Tarrasch's view that the center must be occupied by pawns. Nimzowitsch advocated controlling the center of the board with distant pieces rather than with [[pawn (chess)|pawns]], thus inviting the opponent to occupy the center with pawns, which can then become targets of attack. This was part of the hypermodern framework, which Nimzowitsch encapsulated in his seminal book ''[[My System]]'', which greatly influenced many chess players. It introduced and formalized concepts of the pawn chain, overprotection, undermining, [[prophylaxis (chess)|prophylaxis]], restraint, rook on the seventh [[rank (chess)|rank]], knight [[outpost (chess)|outposts]], the dynamics of the [[isolated pawn|isolated queen's pawn]], and other areas of chess.

Although none of the primary exponents of the Hypermodern school ever achieved the title of [[World Chess Champion]], they were among the world's strongest players. World Champion [[Alexander Alekhine]] was associated with hypermodernism, but his style was more of a blend with the Classical school.

In practice, hypermodernism has not replaced the classical theory of Steinitz and Tarrasch. Instead, modern chess textbooks describe hypermodernism as an addition, or extension, to classical theory.

Hypermodern [[Chess opening|openings]] include the [[Réti Opening]], [[King's Indian Defence]], [[Queen's Indian Defense|Queen's Indian Defence]], [[Nimzo-Indian Defence]], [[Nimzowitsch Defense]], [[Grünfeld Defence]], [[Bogo-Indian Defence]], [[Old Indian Defense|Old Indian Defence]], [[Catalan Opening]], [[King's Indian Attack]], [[Alekhine's Defence]], [[Modern Defence]], [[Pirc Defence]], [[Larsen's opening]], [[Sokolsky Opening]], and to a lesser degree the [[English Opening]]. Openings such as [[Anderssen's Opening|1.a3]] do not constitute hypermodern openings since, although they delay the occupation of the centre with pawns, they also delay piece development.

==History==
[[Howard Staunton]] and many of his contemporaries understood various ideas associated with hypermodernism {{harvcol|Korn|de Firmian|1990|p=625}}. The Hypermodern school of chess theory came to prominence in the 1920s. Leading members were [[Aron Nimzowitsch]], [[Richard Réti]], [[Savielly Tartakower]], [[Gyula Breyer]], and [[Ernst Grünfeld]], who all came from [[Central Europe]] {{harvcol|Averbakh|2012|p=81}}. They felt that chess was becoming boring, slow and not worthwhile. They also believed that chess could not be defined by a simple set of laws or principles, such as those laid out by the German [[Siegbert Tarrasch]].

Their ideas were thus a challenge to the existing orthodoxy popularised by Tarrasch in the 1890s. This orthodoxy was a rather dogmatic distillation of the ideas worked out by chess pioneer [[Wilhelm Steinitz]]. Steinitz was the first player who in his play demonstrated a mastery of [[Chess terminology#Positional play|positional chess]], and the ideas he developed came to be known as the "Classical" or "Modern" school of thought. This school of thought emphasized the importance of "static" advantages such as avoidance of pawn weaknesses, strong outposts for [[knight (chess)|knights]], and striving for [[bishop (chess)#Good bishop and bad bishop|"good" rather than "bad"]] [[bishop (chess)|bishops]] in positions with locked pawn structures. This school of thought was in turn a reaction to the earlier swashbuckling style of [[Adolf Anderssen]], [[Joseph Henry Blackburne|Henry Blackburne]] and others who represented the [[Romantic chess|Romantic]] school.

In 1922, Richard Réti published ''Die neuen Ideen im Schachspiel'' (English: ''The New Ideas in Chess''), an examination of the evolution of chess thinking from the time of [[Paul Morphy]] through the beginning of the Hypermodern school. Tartakower's book ''Die hypermoderne Schachpartie'' (English: ''The Hypermodern Chess Game'') was published in 1924. Nimzowitsch's book ''[[Mein System]]'' (English: ''My System'') was published in 1925 through to 1927 in five installments. It discusses elements of hypermodernism, but focuses mainly on positional chess.

This is a '''list of IBF Muay Thai world champions''', showing every world champion certificated by the [[International Boxing Federation Muaythai]] (IBF Muay Thai). The IBF, which is one of the four major governing bodies in professional boxing,  started certifying their own [[Muay Thai]] world champions in late 2017. The IBF is the second boxing organization to start certifying Muay Thai World champions following [[World Boxing Council]] (WBC).

The '''Senior CLASS Award''' is presented each year to the outstanding senior [[NCAA Division I]] [[Student-athlete|Student-Athlete]] of the Year in men's [[College ice hockey|ice hockey]]. The award was established in 2007.

So far, no women's version of this award has been created. Three NCAA sports that are sponsored for both men and women have Senior CLASS Awards for only one sex—ice hockey and lacrosse do not have women's awards, and volleyball does not have a men's award.

'''Longinus Johannes Norbert "Noppie" Koch''' (22 March 1932 – 7 December 2010) was a cyclist and pacer from the Netherlands. As a cyclist he became national champion in 1959, 1962 and 1963 and won two bronze medals at the [[UCI Motor-paced World Championships]] in 1959 and 1960, in the professionals category.&lt;ref name=r3/&gt; He was then injured in an accident at the factory where he worked and had to retire from racing. He became a pacer in [[motor-paced racing]], bringing [[Piet de Wit]], [[Leo Proost]], [[Martin Venix]] and [[Mattheus Pronk]] to the [[UCI Motor-paced World Championships]] titles.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref name=r2/&gt; 

His fame as a pacemaker spread beyond the Netherlands, and he was invited to work with German and Belgian cyclists such as [[Dieter Kemper]], [[Theo Verschueren]] and [[Stan Tourné]].&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref name=r2/&gt; Although UCI required the pacer and the cyclist to be from the same country, Koch, together with another international pacer [[Bruno Walrave]], successfully argued in the Dutch court to remove this rule. The basis for the claim was that Koch and Walrave would lose their jobs as pacers because of the discrimination by their nationality.&lt;ref name=r4/&gt; 

In total, as a pacer Koch won 10 world and 14 European titles between 1965 and 1987. He retired in 1988/1989 after being injured in a crash during a race.

The [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) does not officially recognize a ranking of participating countries at the Olympic Games.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson|first=Ian|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121856271893833843?mod=psp_free_today&amp;mg=com-wsj#printMode|title=Who's on First in Medals Race|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=August 13, 2008|accessdate=2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, the IOC does publish medal tallies for information purposes, showing the total number of [[Olympic medal]]s earned by athletes representing each country's respective [[National Olympic Committee]].&lt;ref name="Araton"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Araton|first=Harvey|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/19/sports/olympics/19araton.html?_r=2&amp;ref=sports&amp;pagewanted=print|title=A Medal Count That Adds Up To Little|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 18, 2008|accessdate=2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The convention used by the IOC is to sort by the number of gold medals the athletes from a country have earned. In the event of a tie in the number of gold medals, the number of silver medals is taken into consideration, and then the number of bronze medals.  If two countries have an equal number of gold, silver, and bronze medals, they are ordered in the table alphabetically by their [[List of IOC country codes|IOC country code]].

==Background==
The Olympic Charter, Chapter 1, section 6 states that:
{{bquote|The Olympic Games are competitions between athletes in individual or team events and not between countries...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/olympic_charter_en.pdf|title=Olympic Charter|publisher=''International Olympic Committee''|date=2011-07-08|accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The Charter goes even further in Chapter 5, section 57, expressly prohibiting the IOC from producing an official ranking:
{{bquote|The IOC and the OCOG shall not draw up any global ranking per country. A roll of honour bearing the names of medal winners and those awarded diplomas in each event shall be established by the OCOG and the names of the medal winners shall be featured prominently and be on permanent display in the main stadium.}}

According to Australian IOC member [[Kevan Gosper]], the IOC began to accommodate medals tables in 1992, releasing 'information' based on the 'gold first' standard.&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt; The medal tables provided on its website carry this disclaimer:
{{bquote|The International Olympic Committee (IOC) does not recognise global ranking per country; the medal tables are displayed for information only. Furthermore, the results that we publish are official and are taken from the "Official Report" - a document published for each Olympic Games by the Organising Committee. However, for the first Olympic Games (until Antwerp in 1920), it is difficult to give the exact number of medals awarded to some countries since teams were composed of athletes from different countries. The medal tables by country are based on the number of medals won, with gold medals taking priority over silver and bronze. A team victory counts as one medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/table_uk.asp?OLGT=1&amp;OLGY=1896|title=Olympic Games Athens 1896 - Medal Table|publisher=''International Olympic Committee''|accessdate=2008-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Official reports===
Each [[OCOG|Olympic Games organising committee]] (except in 1904) has published an official report after the conclusion of the Games, which among other things list the results of each event. Some early reports included an overall national ranking, including those of 1908,&lt;ref name="officialreport1908"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.la84.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1908/1908.pdf#page=418|title=Official Report|last=1908 Olympic Games Organising Committee|pages=366–7|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1912,&lt;ref name="officialreport1912"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.la84.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1912/1912.pdf#page=1178|title=Official Report|last=1912 Olympic Games Organising Committee|pages=864–5|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1924 (Summer&lt;ref name="officialreport1924s"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.la84.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1924/1924.pdf#page=615|title=Official Report|last=1924 Summer Olympic Games Organising Committee|page=617|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Winter&lt;ref name="officialreport1924w"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.la84.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1924/1924part4.pdf#page=60|title=Official Report|last=1924 Winter Olympic Games Organising Committee|pages=661|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and 1928 (Winter&lt;ref name="officialreport1928"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.la84.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1928/1928w2.pdf#page=19|title=Official Report|last=1928 Winter Olympic Games Organising Committee|page=19|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The 1912 and 1924 tables are described as "official" while that of 1928 is "unofficial".

The 1932 Winter Games report states, "There is no official point score in the Olympic Games" and quotes General Rule 19 of the 1930 Olympic Charter, "In the Olympic Games there is no classification according to points".&lt;ref name="officialreport1932w"&gt;{{cite book|last=Latimer|first=George M.|title=Report |url=http://library.la84.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1932/1932w.pdf#page=264|year=1932|publisher=III Olympic Winter Games Organizing Committee|location=Lake Placid|pages=264–5|chapter=Point Scoring}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Olympic%20Charter/Olympic_Charter_through_time/1930-Olympic_Charter.pdf#page=12|title=General rules applicable to the celebration of the Olympic Games|year=1930|work=1930 - Olympic Charter - Statutes of the International Olympic Committee|publisher=International Olympic Committee|page=28|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It states that the country-based organisation of teams is "chiefly for practical convenience" and that country rankings are "a grave injustice on the smaller countries".&lt;ref name="officialreport1932w"/&gt; It continues that "it has been the experience of all previous Olympic Games that the press of the world insist on exploiting the aspect of national rivalry by creating and publishing a wholly unofficial point score of their own devising, most often on the basis of 10, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 points for the six places recognized on the table of honor". The report itself provides such a table "for ready reference".&lt;ref name="officialreport1932w"/&gt;

===National goals===
The sports funding agencies of some nations have set targets of reaching a certain rank in the medals table, usually based on gold medals; examples are Australia, Japan, France, and Germany.&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt; Funding is reduced for sports with low prospects of medals.&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt;

After London's [[London bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics|successful bid]] to host the [[2012 Olympics]], [[UK Sport]] submitted a funding request to the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] setting an "aspirational goal" of fourth place in the [[2012 Summer Olympics medal table|2012 medals table]], to be reviewed after the [[2008 Olympics]], for which a target of eighth place was set.&lt;ref name="nao2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/0708434.pdf#page=27|title=Setting targets and reporting performance|last=Comptroller and auditor general|date=20 March 2008|work=Preparing for Sporting Success at the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games and Beyond|publisher=[[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]]|pages=25, sec 3.4–3.5|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cm200708"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmcumeds/104/7120414.htm|title=Memorandum submitted by the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Ltd (LOCOG)|last=Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport|date=4 December 2007|work=House of Commons|pages=Minutes of Evidence   Examination of Witnesses  Questions 220–239|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmpubacc/477/47703.htm|title=Forty-Second Report|last=Select Committee on Public Accounts|date=23 June 2008|work=House of Commons|page=Summary|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Olympic Association]] dissociated itself from setting targets.&lt;ref name="cm200708"/&gt; When Britain [[Great Britain at the 2008 Summer Olympics|finished fourth in 2008]], the 2012 target was settled at fourth, with the team [[Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Olympics|ultimately finishing third]].

[[Australia at the 2012 Summer Olympics|Australia's disappointing 10th-place]] in the 2012 medals table prompted the [[Australian Sports Commission]] to draw up a ten-year plan which included a "medium-term" goal of a top-five place in the Summer Olympics and Paralympics and a top-15 place in the winter games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ausport.gov.au/ais/rio_2016|title=Rio 2016|last=Wylie|first=John|year=2015|publisher=Australian Sports Commission (republished from [[The Australian]])|accessdate=4 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160227031003/http://ausport.gov.au/ais/rio_2016#|archive-date=2016-02-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ausport.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/509852/Australias_Winning_Edge.pdf#page=4|title=Australia’s 2012–2022 performance targets|year=2012|work=Australia's Winning Edge 2012–2022|publisher=Australian Sports Commission|page=4|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Tokyo bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics]], the [[Japanese Olympic Committee]] set a 2016 target of third place in gold medals, which it retained even after the games were awarded in 2009 to Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2010/04/28/olympics/joc-wont-change-gold-medal-target-for-2016-olympics/#.VtoemX2LRhF|title=JOC won't change gold medal target for 2016 Olympics|date=28 April 2010|work=The Japan Times|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ranking systems==
{{Quote box|width=250px|align=right|quote="I believe each country will highlight what suits it best. One country will say, 'Gold medals.' The other country will say, 'The total tally counts.' We take no position on that."|source='''[[IOC]] President [[Jacques Rogge]]'''&lt;ref name=Rogge&gt;{{cite news|last=Shipley|first=Amy|title=China's Show of Power|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=August 25, 2008|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/24/AR2008082400851_pf.html|accessdate=2008-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

As  the IOC does not consider its sorting of nations to be an official ranking system, various methods of ranking nations are used. Some sort rankings decided by the total number of medals the country has but most list by the gold medals counted. However, if two or more teams have the same number of gold medals, the silver medals are then judged from the most to the least and then the bronze medals.

=== Medal count ranking ===
The '''gold first''' ranking system described above is used by most of the world media, as well as the IOC. While the gold first ranking system has been used occasionally by some American media outlets, newspapers in the United States primarily publish medal tables ordered by the '''total number''' of medals won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eason|first=Kevin|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/olympics/article4599875.ece?print=yes&amp;randnum=1268512737712|title=America refuses to accept defeat in Olympic medal count|publisher=''The Times (UK)''|date=2008-08-25|accessdate=2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Flyan|first=Kevin|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/china/2008/08/19/whos-top-of-the-medals-table/|title=Who’s top of the medals table?|publisher=Reuters|date=2008-08-19|accessdate=2009-01-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916020810/http://blogs.reuters.com/china/2008/08/19/whos-top-of-the-medals-table/|archivedate=2008-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wetzel|first=Dan|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/news;_ylt=Av5FIN9FAQzc5PVxJGoYmla7KZt4?slug=dw-medalcount082208&amp;prov=yhoo&amp;type=lgns&amp;print=1|title=U.S. will be rocked by China’s heavy medals|publisher=''Yahoo!

This difference in rankings has its origins in the early days of the Olympics, when the IOC did not publish or recognise medal tables.&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt; Before the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] the difference in ranking system received scant notice, since in recent Olympic history the country that led in total medals also led in the gold count.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} However, during the 2002 Winter Olympics Germany won the highest number of medals (36), but earned one gold medal fewer than Norway - the latter winning 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.databaseolympics.com/games/gamesyear.htm?g=45 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418064015/http://www.databaseolympics.com/games/gamesyear.htm?g=45 |archivedate=2008-04-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar situation occurred at the [[2008 Summer Olympics medal table|2008 Summer Olympics]], with China and U.S. topping the gold and total medal tallies respectively,&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news|first=Robert |last=Hardaway |title=Weighing Olympic gold |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/sunday/commentary/la-oe-hardaway22-2008aug22,0,52982.story |publisher=''The Los Angeles Times'' |date=2008-08-22 |accessdate=2008-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827043408/http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/sunday/commentary/la-oe-hardaway22-2008aug22%2C0%2C52982.story |archivedate=August 27, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then again at the [[2010 Winter Olympics medal table|2010 Winter Olympics]] when Canada and the U.S. finished 1st and 3rd respectively in the "gold first" ranking&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sochi2014.com/en/medal-history?year=2010 2010 Official Medal Table]&lt;/ref&gt; and 3rd and 1st respectively in terms of total medals won.&lt;ref name="Vancouver 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-medals/ |title=Official Website for the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics |accessdate=2010-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212034642/http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-medals/ |archivedate=2010-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Other exceptions are the [[1896 Summer Olympics medal table|1896]], [[1912 Summer Olympics medal table|1912]], and [[1964 Summer Olympics medal table|1964]] Summer Olympics when the United States finished first in gold medal count, but second in the overall medal count.
In an August 24, 2008 news conference, IOC President [[Jacques Rogge]] confirmed that the IOC does not have a view on any particular ranking system.&lt;ref name=Rogge/&gt;

=== Population-size, resources-per-person and multivariate prediction models and ratings===
Sporting success predictions and ratings can be [[univariate]], i.e. based on one independent variable, such as a country's population size and the number of medals is divided by the population of the country,&lt;ref name=nzherald&gt;{{cite web|title=We are second in medals table-behind Slovenia|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10528184|accessdate=2009-01-16|date=2008-08-21|publisher=New Zealand Herald|last=Donovan|first=Brooke}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardianrogers&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympics 2012: the alternative medals table|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/datablog/2012/jul/30/olympics-2012-alternative-medal-table#pop|accessdate=2012-08-06|date=2012-08-30|publisher=''The Guardian''|last=Rogers|first=Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[wikt:multivariate|multivariate]], where resources-per-person in the form of GDP per capita and other variables are included. &lt;!--Since the following portion of text seems to be original research and no references were given, and also the argument presented is - as I have shown at the end - double-edged one: Every country is limited in the number of participants they can send per event, sometimes as few as one athlete per event, including one team in team events. Countries with a large population, such as China or the United States, usually do not rank highly here,&lt;ref name=nzherald&gt;{{cite web|title=We are second in medals table-behind Slovenia|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10528184|accessdate=2009-01-16|date=2008-08-21|publisher=New Zealand Herald|last=Donovan|first=Brooke}}&lt;/ref&gt; since they cannot send as many participants per capita as some smaller countries, but on the other hand smaller nations have to select the best competitors from much smaller population to compete with the best from bigger nations.--&gt;

Resources per person in the form of [[GDP]] per capita has been included in an article by ''[[The Guardian]]'' published during the [[2012 Summer Olympics]]&lt;ref name=guardianrogers&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympics 2012: the alternative medals table|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/datablog/2012/jul/30/olympics-2012-alternative-medal-table#pop|accessdate=2012-08-06|date=2012-08-30|publisher=''The Guardian''|last=Rogers|first=Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again by [[Google]]'s News Lab for the Rio 2016 games.&lt;ref name=flagandmap&gt;{{cite web|title=2008 Summer Olympics: GDP Adjusted Performance Ranking|url=http://www.flagandmap.com/famcore/olympics-2008-gdpadj-ranking|accessdate=2012-07-25|publisher=FlagAndMap}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://landing.google.com/altmedaltable/|title=Alternative Olympics medal table|website=landing.google.com|access-date=2016-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Already in 2002, the research done by Meghan Busse of [[Northwestern University]] suggested that both a large population and high per capita GDP are needed to generate high medal totals,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/andrew.bernard/olymp60restat_finaljournalversion.pdf Who Wins the Olympic Games: Economic Resources and Medal Totals], ''Review of Economics and Statistics'', December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and predictive models have been built trying to predict success with [[multivariate analysis]], taking also past results and host-nation advantage into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18976333 |title=Medals table: The alternative rankings for London 2012 |publisher=The BBC |date=30 July 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coloradocollege.edu/newsevents/newsroom/dan-johnson-the-man-who-predicts-medals |title=Dan Johnson: "The Man Who Predicts Medals" |publisher=Colorado College |date=18 July 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19249898 |title=Medals table: The real winners and losers |publisher=The BBC |date=14 August 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weighted ranking ===
Systematic rankings based upon a weighted point system with the most points awarded to a gold medal have also been devised. Those used in the official reports were:
* 1908: 5:3:1 — gold medals 5 points, silver medals 3 points, and bronze medals 1 point.&lt;ref name="officialreport1908"/&gt;&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;
* 1912: 3:2:1 — the report also compares this "Swedish" method with the 5:3:1 "English" method.&lt;ref name="officialreport1912"/&gt;
* 1924: 10:5:4:3:2:1 — so points were awarded for 4th to 6th places, where no medals were awarded.&lt;ref name="officialreport1924s"/&gt;&lt;ref name="officialreport1924w"/&gt; The IOC did require top six finishers to be listed in the report in a "table of honor".&lt;ref name="officialreport1932w"/&gt;
* 1928: 6:5:4:3:2:1 — separate totals are listed depending on whether the [[military patrol]] was included or not, as [[Military patrol at the 1928 Winter Olympics|its status was downgraded]] belatedly to [[demonstration sport]].&lt;ref name="officialreport1928"/&gt; 
* 1932: same as 1924, and described as the usual scheme in newspapers.&lt;ref name="officialreport1932w"/&gt;
The 1908 and 1924 systems share the points for tied placings: for example, in a two-way tie for second, each gets half the sum of the points for second and third place.&lt;ref name="officialreport1908"/&gt;&lt;ref name="officialreport1924s"/&gt;&lt;ref name="officialreport1924w"/&gt;

In 2004, a 3:2:1 system was used by the Australian Geography Teachers Association.&lt;ref name="AGTA"&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Bernard |title=Medal points data for Athens 2004 Olympic Games |url=http://www.geography.org.uk/download/GA_PSMMAthensPoints.pdf |publisher=Review of Economics and Statistics |year=2004 |accessdate=2010-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719003703/http://www.geography.org.uk/download/GA_PSMMAthensPoints.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This weighting values a gold medal as much weight as a silver and a bronze medal combined. In response to the 2008 controversy over medal rank, Jeff Z. Klein in a ''[[New York Times]]'' blog post proposed a 4:2:1 system as a compromise between the total-medals and golds-first methods.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Medal Rankings: Which Country Leads the Olympics?|author=Klein, Jeff |publisher=''New York Times''|date=2008-08-17 |url=http://beijing2008.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/23/the-medal-rankings-which-country-leads-the-olympics/|accessdate=2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems have been popular in certain places at certain times, but none of them have been adopted on a large scale.

The '''International Roll of Honour''' is a list established by the [[Scottish Football Association]] recognising players who have gained 50 or more international [[cap (football)|caps]] for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. The roll of honour was launched in February 1988, when 11 players had already achieved the distinction.&lt;ref name = "sfa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_football_players.cfm?page=138 |publisher=[[Scottish Football Association]]|accessdate=11 March 2017|title=International Roll of Honour |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427032517/http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_football_players.cfm?page=138 |archivedate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each player inducted receives a commemorative gold medal, an invitation to every Scotland home match and has their portrait hung in the [[Scottish Football Museum]].&lt;ref name = "sfa"/&gt;

{{as of|2018}} there are 31 players on the roll of honour. [[Craig Gordon]] is the most recent addition, having won his 50th cap on 5 October 2017 against [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]].

In July 2017, the SFA launched the Women's International Roll of Honour, which recognises players who have won 100 or more caps for [[Scotland women's national football team|Scotland Women's National Team]]. The women's roll of honour initially included 12 players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scottishfa.co.uk/news/women-s-international-roll-of-honour-unveiled/ |title=Women’s International Roll of Honour unveiled |work= |publisher=Scottish Football Association |date=10 July 2017 |accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Silivrikapi Ice Skating Hall''', full name '''Silivrikapi Skating Hall and Recreation Center''', shortly '''Silivrikapı Ice Rink''', ({{lang-tr|Silivrikapı Buz Pateni Salonu}}), is an indoor [[ice skating]] and [[ice hockey]] [[hockey rink|arena]] located at Silivrikapı neighborhood of [[Fatih]] district in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]. It was opened in September 2009.&lt;ref name="ibb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibb.gov.tr/en-US/Pages/Haber.aspx?NewsID=191 |publisher=Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality |title=Silivrikapı Ice Rink Ready for Championship… |date=2009-09-10 |accessdate=2012-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arena consists of an Olympic-size rink of {{convert|1740|m2|sqft |abbr=on}} with a seating capacity of 900 people, and another one of {{convert|600|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} for 200 spectators used as training rink.&lt;ref name="hdn"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=istanbul-waits-20-years-for-first-faceoff-2010-01-03 |newspaper=[[Hürriyet Daily News]] |title=Istanbul waits 20 years for first faceoff |date=2012-01-03 |accessdate=2012-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Covering an area of {{convert|8950|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}, the construction of the complex cost {{Turkish lira}} 30 million (approx. US$20 million).&lt;ref name="ibb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icepark.com.tr/tuerkiyeden-haberler/27-slvrkapi-buz-pst.html |publisher=Ice Park |title=Silivrikapı Buz Pisti |language=Turkish |accessdate=2012-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Asked by the [[Turkish Ice Skating Federation]], the Metropoiitan Municipality of Istanbul planned to build an ice rink in 1989. The district municipality of Fatih allocated the current site for the building of the venue. However, the government was reluctant to provide the funds required. The planning and the works proceeded only slow since the project proved to be difficult due to lack of technical know-how about the construction of an ice rink.&lt;ref name="hdn"/&gt;
 
Shortly before the completion of the construction, a major [[1999 İzmit earthquake|earthquake in 1999]] devastated parts of Istanbul. Due to an expertise, the building was declared unsafe. The structure was then demolished, and the project was abandoned.&lt;ref name="hdn"/&gt;

Years after, the project to build an ice rink resumed with pressure from the ice skating community and financial support from the government. In 2007, the construction of a new ice skating venue began at the same site in Silivrikapı that was finally completed in September 2009. Shortly after its opening, the venue hosted [[International Skating Union]]'s Junior Grand Prix of Figure Skating event.&lt;ref name="ibb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hdn"/&gt;

Silivrikapı Ice Skating Hall hosts ice hockey clubs of Istanbul, which carried out their trainings in the past at the [[Galleria Ice Rink]], a small size ice rink in a shopping mall not far from the Silivrikapı Arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eurohockey.com/club/2203-istanbul-paten-klb.html?league=847 |publisher=Euro Hockey |title=Istanbul Paten Klübü |accessdate=2012-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bookmaker Ratings''' - the international analytical online publication which mediates disputes between players and bookmakers.
Bookmaker Ratings was founded by Paruyr Shahbazyan in 2012 when he spent $50 purchasing a simple website template.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paruyr Shahbazyan in Forbes |url=http://www.forbes.ru/finansy/309505-na-storone-igroka-kak-zarabotat-v-bukmekerskom-biznese}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also in 2012, Bookmaker Ratings made the news after being informed of a possible match-fixing incident in the Russian championship between Khimki and Petrotrest. Later, UEFA asked them to investigate the match between these two sides in order to identify any incidents.
Bookmaker Ratings does not only try to solve disputes between players and bookmakers but also has an independent rating system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Interview with Paruyr Shahbazyan|url=http://sobesednik.ru/sport/20120404-totalizatory-onlain-novye-instrumenty-dlya-regulirovaniya-rynka}}&lt;/ref&gt; where bookmakers are ranked from 1 to 5 on several criteria including: reliability, speed of payments, customer support and value of odds. This system of ratings is regularly updated, including new bookmaking companies.

The website, which is available in four languages, publishes daily betting tips for various sports, written by the site's authors who range from journalists to ex-players including commentator [[Konstantin Genich]] and former world number 5 tennis player [[Anna Chakvetadze]]. Other experts in the past have included football World Cup winner [[Fabio Cannavaro]] and former heavyweight boxing champion [[Nikolai Valuev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= MegaObzor about BR|url=http://megaobzor.com/forecasts-for-sports-require-professionalism-from-experts.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bookmaker Ratings averages 1.2 million hits a month, 350,000 of which are unique visitors. During Bookmaker Ratings' four years of existence, they have helped refund players more than 1.4m US dollars.

In May 2016, Bookmaker Ratings created their 'Handicap Platform', which allows users to post their own betting tips on sporting events.
The site also contains a section which gives readers the latest news from the bookmaking world as well as bookmakers' bonuses and a betting encyclopedia. Furthermore, Bookmaker Ratings has its own YouTube channel.

'''Wan Ok Phansa''' ({{lang-th|วันออกพรรษา}}) (; literally "day of going out of [[Vassa]]", ออก in Thai meaning exit or leave) is the last day of the [[Thai people|Thai]]-[[Lao people|Lao]] observance of [[Vassa]]. It occurs in October, three lunar months after ''Wan Kao Pansa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Meaning of Wan Awk Pansa|url=http://chiangmaibest.com/awk-pansa/|website=Chiang Mai Best|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The day is celebrated in [[Isan]] by illuminated [[boat]] processions ({{lang-th|ไหลเรือไฟ}} ''lai ruea fai'', {{lang-tts|ไหลเฮือไฟ}} ''lai huea fai''), notably in [[Nakhon Phanom Province]] on the [[Mekong]] and in [[Ubon Ratchathani]] on the [[Mun River]].   

The main ceremonies feature boats of 8–10 metres in length, formerly made of [[banana]] wood or [[bamboo]] but now sometimes of other materials.  The boats  are filled with offerings such as ''[[khao tom]]'' ([[glutinous rice]] sweets wrapped in banana leaves) and decorated on the outside with [[flower]]s, [[candle]]s and [[Lighting|lamp]]s. The boats are launched in the evening.  

Additionally, some celebrants individually launch their own, smaller, vessels. Boat races also take place around this time in many places throughout the country as a way to please the [[Nāga#Buddhism|Nāga]] spirits.
Along the [[Mekong]] River, people launch little hot air balloons, acting as a [[lantern]]s, around the night of Wan Ok Phansa.  

Launching the boats (or the lanterns) symbolizes your wishes but also getting rid of unnecessary negative feelings. 

==Etymology==

"Wan" ({{lang-th|วัน}}) means "day"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thai-language.com/id/131393 วัน  wan ''thai-language.com'']&lt;/ref&gt;, "Ok" ({{lang-th|ออก}}) means "the exit; the way out"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thai-language.com/id/131252 ออก  aawk ''thai-language.com'']&lt;/ref&gt;, and Phansa ({{lang-th|พรรษา}}) is the Thai word for [[Vassa]].

[[File:Westchester Couny Center December 3, 2013.jpg|thumb|Facade of the Westchester County Center]]
The '''Westchester County Center''' is a 5,000-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[White Plains, New York]]. It hosts various local concerts and sporting events for the area.

The County Center was conceived by the Westchester Recreation Commission in 1924 as a multi-purpose indoor recreational facility to host community programs and income-producing commercial events.  It was designed by the architectural firm of [[Walker &amp; Gillette]], and built and decorated in the [[Art Deco]] style. The construction project cost approximately $785,000; a $16-million rehabilitation was completed in 1988.

For nearly 80 years the County Center has been Westchester's premier setting for thousands of concerts, trade shows, sports events, meetings, seminars, theatrical presentations, conventions and civic and community events.

On the weekend of May 22, 1930, the Westchester County Center Grand opening gala was held, attracting thousands from all over Westchester to hear such notable musicians as the pianist Percy Grainger, Metropolitan Opera Company tenor Edward Johnson, organist Palmer Christian and more than 1,500 local choral group performers. In the ensuing years, generations of County Center audiences have been treated to performances by such greats as Judy Garland, Liza Minnelli, Joan Sutherland, James Brown, Kenny Rogers, Janis Joplin and John Sebastian, along with the Harlem Globetrotters, World Wrestling Entertainment, and the Royal Hanneford Circus, one of the longest running events at the Center to date.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2842">Wheelchair Aussie Rules was originally created by Kevin Bucky Faulkner 
The first organised game of competitive '''wheelchair Australian rules football''' was played at the [[RAAF]] base in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]] on 8 November 2015.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hartigan|first1=Brian|title=First officially organised wheelchair Aussie Rules|url=http://www.contactairlandandsea.com/2015/11/08/wheelchair-aussie-reules/|website=Contact - Air, Land and Sea|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite news|title=Wheelchair Aussie rules makes official debut in match between diggers and locals at Adelaide RAAF base|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-08/wheelchair-aussie-rules-makes-competitive-debut/6922434|accessdate=9 November 2015|work=ABC News|date=8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;The game involved a team of wounded [[Australian Defence Force]] (ADF) personnel undergoing rehabilitation at [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]'s soldier Recovery Centre  and a [[Disability Sports Australia]] (DSA) team made up of players from South Australia. The game was organized by the ADF, [[Australian Football League]] and DSA. The final score was: DSA team 16.8.104 defeated the ADF team 14.5.89.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;

In April 2015, [[Prince Harry]] whilst visiting [[Darwin, Northern Territory]] raised the profile of this new sport by participating in a game of wheelchair AFL.&lt;ref name=harry&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Lisa|title=Prince Harry plays wheelchair AFL|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/latest-news/prince-harry-plays-wheelchair-afl/story-fn3dxiwe-1227310229360|accessdate=9 November 2015|work=The Australian|date=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game involved wounded Australian soldiers.&lt;ref name=harry/&gt;

In November 2015, there are plans to create a national league. &lt;ref name=abc/&gt;
