      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5490">'''Academic detailing''' is “[[university]] or [[non-commercial]]-based educational outreach.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Soumerai SB, Avorn J | year = 1990 | title = Principles of educational outreach ('academic detailing') to improve clinical decision making | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 263 | issue = 4| pages = 549–56 | doi=10.1001/jama.1990.03440040088034}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process involves face-to-face education of prescribers by trained [[health care]] professionals, typically [[pharmacists]], [[physicians]], or [[nurses]]. The goal of academic detailing is to improve prescribing of targeted [[drugs]] to be consistent with [[medical]] evidence from [[randomized controlled trials]], which ultimately improves patient care and can reduce [[health care costs]]. A key component of non-commercial or university-based academic detailing programs is that they (academic detailers/clinical educators, management, staff, program developers, etc.) do not have any financial links to the [[pharmaceutical industry]].

Academic detailing has been studied for over 25 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Avorn J, Soumerai SB | year = 1983 | title = Improving drug-therapy decisions through educational outreach. A [[randomized controlled trial]] of academically based "detailing | url = | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 308 | issue = 24| pages = 1457–63 | doi=10.1056/nejm198306163082406}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been shown to be effective at improving prescribing of targeted medications about 5% from baseline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Brien MA, Rogers S, Jamtvedt G | year = 2007 | title = Educational outreach visits: effects on professional practice and health care outcomes | doi = 10.1002/14651858.cd000409.pub2 | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = 4 | issue = | page = CD000409 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though it is primarily used to affect prescribing, it is also used to educate providers regarding other [[non-drug intervention]]s, such as [[screening guideline]]s.

== Organizations ==
Many academic detailing programs exist around the world. In the [[United States]], university-based state programs exist in [[Vermont]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.med.uvm.edu/ahec/TB1+BL.asp?SiteAreaID=290&lt;/ref&gt; Oregon&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20110720024858/http://pharmacy.oregonstate.edu/drug_policy/index.php?nav=ROAD&lt;/ref&gt; and [[South Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sccp.sc.edu/SCORxE&lt;/ref&gt;  The nonprofit organization Alosa Health&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alosahealth.org/|title=Alosa Health|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; runs an academic detailing program in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Washington, DC called the Independent Drug Information Service (IDIS). The National Resource Center for Academic Detailing (NaRCAD), funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) in 2010, was created to help organizations with limited resources to establish and improve their own programs and to create a network of academic detailing programs. The [[U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs]] Pharmacy Benefits Management pilot tested the National Academic Detailing Service in 2010 to enhance veterans' outcomes by empowering clinicians and promoting the use of evidence-based treatments using delivered by clinical pharmacy specialists.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbm.va.gov/PBM/academicdetailingservice/AboutUs.asp (Last accessed: 20 October 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; After the pilot, in March 2015, the Interim Under Secretary for Health issued a memorandum requiring implementation of AD programs throughout the [[Veterans Health Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.veterans.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/VA%20Clancy%20Testimony%203.26.20151.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Programs also exist in [[Canada]] through the [[Canadian Academic Detailing Collaboration (CADC)]],&lt;ref&gt;http://ebm.oscarmcmaster.org/ebm-resources/CADC%20Handout%202008.doc&lt;/ref&gt; including the [https://effectivepractice.org Centre for Effective Practice]'s (CEP) [https://effectivepractice.org/resources/academic-detailing-service/ academic detailing service] in Ontario,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jin|first=Margaret|last2=Naumann|first2=Terryn|last3=Regier|first3=Loren|last4=Bugden|first4=Shawn|last5=Allen|first5=Michael|last6=Salach|first6=Lena|last7=Chelak|first7=Kristen|last8=Blythe|first8=Nancy|last9=Gagnon|first9=Antony|date=May 2012|title=A brief overview of academic detailing in Canada: Another role for pharmacists|journal=Canadian Pharmacists Journal : CPJ|volume=145|issue=3|pages=142–146.e2|doi=10.3821/145.3.cpj142|issn=1715-1635|pmc=3567505|pmid=23509530}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Australia]] through the [[Drug and Therapeutics Information Service]] (DATIS) and the [[National Prescribing Service]] (NPS).

[[Universities]] and [[university college]]s normally use the [[ECTS grading scale]]. Most institutions have official "explanations" of the grades equivalent to the following:&lt;ref&gt;The example is from the University of Oslo, [http://www.lovdata.no/for/sf/kd/td-20051220-1798-007.html#6-1]. Other institutions using similar scales include the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, [http://www.lovdata.no/for/sf/kd/xd-20051207-1684.html#39], Sør-Trøndelag University College, [http://www.lovdata.no/for/sf/kd/td-20080619-0638-004.html#4-4] and The Norwegian Police University College, [http://www.lovdata.no/for/sf/kd/td-20090603-0986-005.html#24].&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"

|}

In some subjects the grades Passed/Not passed and Recognized/Not recognized are used.

The formerly most common system of grades used at university level was based on a scale running from 1.0 (highest) through 6.0 (lowest), 4.0 being the lowest passing grade. Except from in natural sciences and mathematics, the grades from 1.0 to 1.5 were rarely used, de facto reducing the grade range from 1.6 to 6.0 outside these fields. Medicine and law studies used a different grading system. The way the ECTS grading scale was introduced implies that students who had started their studies while the old system still was in effect will graduate with transcripts containing grades from both systems (i.e., both numbers and letters).

== Secondary school and upper secondary school ==
Lower levels of education (secondary school and upper secondary school) use a scale running from 1 to 6, with 6 being the highest and 2 as the lowest passing grade.

The grading scale is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;The grading scale is provided by regulations (''forskrift'') to the Norwegian education law, see § 4-4 [http://www.lovdata.no/for/sf/kd/td-20060623-0724-015.html#4-4]&lt;/ref&gt;

*6 Outstanding competence in the subject (1-5% of students)
*5 Very good competence in the subject (15-25% of students)
*4 Good competence in the subject (20-30% of students)
*3 Fairly good competence in the subject (25-40% of students)
*2 Low level of competence in the subject (10-20% of students) 
*1 Very low level of competence in the subject (failure, 1-8% of students)

For non-final tests and mid-term evaluations, grades are often postfixed with + or − (except 6+ and 1−), and it is also common to use grades such as 5/6 or 4/3 indicating borderline grades. This practice is unofficial. Finals, and the final grades for each subject, may only be graded with whole numbers.

In addition, grades are given for conduct, in particular ''tidiness'' and ''behavior''. This scale runs:

*G (''God'' or Good)
*Ng (''Nokså god'' or Fairly good)
*Lg (''Lite god'' or Not good)

"G" represents the normal good conduct. The "Ng" grade indicates clear deviations from normal good conduct, while the "Lg" grade are for extraordinary cases with major deviations. In some cases the scale is extended with + or - suffixes, most commonly "G-", to inform a student of a borderline status.

'''Albert Gleizes''' ({{IPA-fr|glɛz|lang}}; 8 December 1881 – 23 June 1953) was a French artist, theoretician, philosopher, a self-proclaimed founder of [[Cubism]] and an influence on the [[School of Paris]]. Albert Gleizes and [[Jean Metzinger]] wrote the first major treatise on Cubism, ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', 1912. Gleizes was a founding member of the [[Section d'Or]] group of artists. He was also a member of ''[[Der Sturm]]'', and his many theoretical writings were originally most appreciated in Germany, where especially at the [[Bauhaus]] his ideas were given thoughtful consideration. Gleizes spent four crucial years in New York, and played an important role in making America aware of [[modern art]]. He was a member of the [[Society of Independent Artists]], founder of the Ernest-Renan Association, and both a founder and participant in the [[Abbaye de Créteil]].&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/albertgleizes1881robb#page/n3/mode/2up Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 – 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund.]&lt;/ref&gt; Gleizes exhibited regularly at [[Léonce Rosenberg]]’s ''Galerie de l’Effort Moderne'' in Paris; he was also a founder, organizer and director of [[Abstraction-Création]]. From the mid-1920s to the late 1930s much of his energy went into writing, e.g., ''[[Crystal Cubism#Painting and its Laws|La Peinture et ses lois]]'' (Paris, 1923), ''Vers une conscience plastique: La Forme et l’histoire'' (Paris, 1932) and ''Homocentrisme'' (Sablons, 1937).&lt;ref name="MoMA, Daniel Robbins"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=2191 Museum of Modern Art, New York, MoMA, Albert Gleizes, Daniel Robbins, Grove Art Online, 2009 Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Born Albert Léon Gleizes and raised in [[Paris, France|Paris]], he was the son of a fabric designer who ran a large industrial design workshop. He was also the nephew of [[Léon Comerre]], a successful portrait painter who won the 1875 [[Prix de Rome]]. The young Albert Gleizes did not like school and often skipped classes to idle away the time writing poetry and wandering through the nearby [[Cimetière de Montmartre|Montmartre cemetery]]. Finally, after completing his secondary schooling, Gleizes spent four years in the 72nd Infantry Regiment of the French army (Abbeville, Picardie) then began pursuing a career as a painter. Gleizes began to paint self-taught around 1901 in the [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] tradition. His first landscapes from around [[Courbevoie]] appear particularly inspired by [[Alfred Sisley]] or [[Camille Pissarro]].&lt;ref name="Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie"&gt;[http://www.fondationgleizes.fr/pdf/fag-chronologie-gleizes.pdf Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112092816/http://fondationgleizes.fr/pdf/fag-chronologie-gleizes.pdf |date=2008-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although clearly related to Pissarro in technique, Gleizes' particular view-points as well as the composition and conception of early works represent a clear departure from the style of late Impressionism. The density with which these works are painted and their solid framework suggest affinities with Divisionism which were often noted by early critics.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

Gleizes was only twenty-one years of age when his work titled ''La Seine à Asnières'' was exhibited at the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1902. The following year Gleizes exhibited two paintings at the Salon d'Automne. In 1905 Gleizes was among the founders of ''l'Association Ernest-Renan'', a union of students opposed to military propaganda. Gleizes was in charge of the ''Section littéraire et artistique'', organizing theater productions and poetry readings. At the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon (Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, 1906), Gleizes exhibited ''Jour de marché en banlieue''. Tending towards 1907 his work evolved into a [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] style with strong [[Naturalism (visual art)|Naturalist]] and [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] components.&lt;ref name="Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie" /&gt;

Gleizes and others decide to create an ''association fraternelle d'artistes'' and rent a large house in Créteil. The [[Abbaye de Créteil]] was a self-supporting community of artists that aimed to develop their art free of any commercial concerns. For nearly a year, Gleizes along with other painters, poets, musicians and writers, gathered to create. A lack of income forced them to give up their cherished Abbaye de Créteil in early 1908 and Gleizes moved to 7 rue du Delta near [[Montmartre]], Paris, with artists [[Amedeo Modigliani]], {{Ill|Henri Doucet|fr}}, Maurice Drouart and Geo Printemps.&lt;ref name="Brooke, 2001"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=QG9wNyIlEAgC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=gleizes,+%22simultaneous+movements+of+translation%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8EIKQ9bxba&amp;sig=Ddnuo643ki8Urc433IuNhY4KzwE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9XovVdD_Gor-ygPcioGIBA&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=gleizes%2C%20%22simultaneous%20movements%20of%20translation%22&amp;f=false Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes: For and Against the Twentieth Century'', Yale University Press, 2001], {{ISBN|0300089643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908 Gleizes exhibited at the ''Toison d'Or'' in [[Moscow]]. The same year, showing a great interest in color and reflecting the transient influence of [[Fauvism]], the work of Gleizes became more synthetic with a [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] component.&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/chronology Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881–1953'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fondation Gleizes"&gt;[http://www.fondationgleizes.fr/albert-gleizes-vie.html Fondation Gleizes, Sa Vie] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20071012171915/http://www.fondationgleizes.fr/albert-gleizes-vie.html |date=2007-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gleizes' Fauve-like period was very brief, lasting several months, and even when his paint was thickest and color brightest, his concern for structural rhythms and simplification was dominant. His geometric simplifications at this time were more akin to [[Pont-Aven School]] and [[Les Nabis]] principles than to [[Paul Cézanne]]. His landscapes of 1909 are characterized by the reducing of forms of nature to primary shapes.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"/&gt;

During the summer of the same year his style became linear and stripped, broken down into multiple forms and facets with attenuated colors, close to that of the painter [[Henri Le Fauconnier]]. In 1910 a group began to form which included Gleizes, Metzinger, [[Fernand Léger]] and [[Robert Delaunay]]. They met regularly at Henri le Fauconnier's studio on rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs, near the Boulevard de Montparnasse. These soirées would often included writers such as [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Roger Allard|fr|3=Roger Allard}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|René Arcos|fr|3=René Arcos}}, [[Paul Fort]], [[Pierre-Jean Jouve]], [[Alexandre Mercereau]], [[Jules Romains]] and [[André Salmon]].&lt;ref name="Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie" /&gt; Together with other young painters, the group wanted to emphasise a research into form, in opposition to the Neo-Impressionist emphasis on color. From 1910 onwards, Albert Gleizes was directly involved with Cubism, both as an artist and principle theorist of the movement.&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fondation Gleizes" /&gt;

==Cubism==

===The crucial years===
Gleizes' evolvement in Cubism saw him exhibit at the twenty-sixth [[Salon des Indépendants]] in 1910. He showed his ''Portrait de René Arcos'' and ''[[L'Arbre, The Tree (Gleizes)|L'Arbre]]'', two paintings in which the emphasis on simplified form had already begun to overwhelm the representational interest of the paintings. The same tendency is evident in Jean Metzinger's ''Portrait of Apollinaire'' in the same Salon.&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke" /&gt; When [[Louis Vauxcelles]] wrote his initial review of the Salon he made a passing and imprecise reference to Gleizes, [[Jean Metzinger]], Robert Delaunay, Fernand Léger and [[Henri le Fauconnier]], as "ignorant geometers, reducing the human body, the site, to pallid cubes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7527626n/f1.item Louis Vauxcelles, ''A travers les salons: promenades aux « Indépendants »'', Gil Blas, 18 March 1910]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guillaume Apollinaire]], in his account of the same salon at the [[Grand Palais]] (in L'Intransigeant, 18 March 1910)&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7855479/f1.image Guillaume Apollinaire, in L'Intransigeant, 18 March 1910, ''Prenez garde à la peinture! Le Salon des artistes indépendants. Six mille toiles sont exposées'' (Editions Bibliopolis, 1998)]&lt;/ref&gt; remarked "with joy" that the general sense of the exhibition signifies "''La déroute de l'impressionnisme,''" in reference to the works of a conspicuous group of artists (Gleizes, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier, Metzinger, [[André Lhote]] and [[Marie Laurencin]]).&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Robbins, 1985, ''Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', from ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art (J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serdar-hizli-art.com/art_history/abstract_art/history_and_chronology_of_cubism_page_2.htm The History and Chronology of Cubism, The Cubist Painters, p. 2]&lt;/ref&gt; In Gleizes' paintings of the crucial year 1910, writes [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]], "we see the artist's volumetric approach to Cubism and his successful union of a broad field of vision with a flat picture plane. [...] The effort to grasp the intricate rhythms of a panorama resulted in a comprehensive geometry of intersecting and overlapping forms which created a new and more dynamic quality of movement.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

Gleizes then exhibited at the 1910 [[Salon d'Automne]] with the same artists, followed by the first organized group showing by Cubists, in ''Salle 41'' of the 1911 [[Salon des Indépendants]] (''[[La Femme aux Phlox (Gleizes)|La Femme aux Phlox (Woman with Phlox)]]'') together with Metzinger, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Léger. The result was a public scandal which brought Cubism for the first time to the attention of the general public ([[Picasso]] and [[Braque]] were exhibiting in a private gallery selling to a small circle of connoisseurs). In a review of the 1911 Indépendants published in Le Petit Parisien (23 April 1911), critic Jean Claude writes:
:Then there is Le Fauconnier, who, jealous of the Cubist Metzinger, became trapezoid… and painted something of the sort he titled, I think, ''L’Abondance''… Metzinger himself painted nudes that look like puzzles, the pieces of which are cubes of various sizes; F. Léger lacking originality, adopted stove pipes [tuyau de poêle] as a means of reproduction of the human figure… The other, which I have never been able to guess the name, uses small checkerboards, gray and white, white and black, gray and brown, pink and black, and painted an Eiffel Tower flanked on the ground undoubtedly to crush houses, which, while dancing the cancan, stuffed their chimneys through the windows.

:A talented artist, Albert Gleizes, also allowed himself to try a trianguliste representation of the human figure. This is sad, deeply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k563950s/f5.image Le Petit Parisien, review of the 1911 Salon des Indépendants, 4 April 1911. Gallica, Bibliothèque nationale de France]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1911 Salon d'Automne (room 8) Gleizes exhibited his ''[[Portrait of Jacques Nayral (Gleizes)|Portrait de Jacques Nayral]]'' and ''[[La Chasse, The Hunt (Gleizes)|La Chasse (The Hunt)]]'', with, in addition to the group of ''Salle 41'', [[André Lhote]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Jacques Villon]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye]] and [[André Dunoyer de Segonzac]]. In the fall of that year, though the intermediary of Apollinaire, he met [[Pablo Picasso]] for the first time and joined the [[Puteaux Group]] which held meetings in the studio of [[Jacques Villon]] (Gaston Duchamp) and also included Villon's brothers, [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]], amongst others. Many of these artists also frequented the cafés Le Dôme, La Closerie des Lilas, La Rotonde, Le Select, and La Coupole in Montparnasse.&lt;ref name="Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''People crowded into our room, they shouted, they laughed, they got worked up, they protested, they luxuriated in all kinds of utterances''.

Gleizes exhibited his ''[[Les Baigneuses (Gleizes)|Les Baigneuses (The Bathers)]]'' at the 1912 Salon des Indépendants; a show marked by Marcel Duchamp's ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2]]'', which itself caused a scandal even amongst the Cubists (Duchamp removed the painting before the opening of the exhibition). This was followed by a group show at the [[Galeries Dalmau]] in [[Barcelona]], the first exhibition of Cubism in Spain,&lt;ref&gt;[http://pandora.girona.cat/viewer.vm?id=2933958&amp;view=dalmau&amp;lang=en Exposició de Arte Cubista, Galeries Dalmau, Barcelona, 20 April – 10 May 1912]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=qrP60BqU634C&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=cubisme+en+espana,+galeries+dalmau&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRwoagvc3aAhVGQBQKHZDyCekQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cubisme%20en%20espana%2C%20galeries%20dalmau&amp;f=false Carol A.

1911 through 1912, drawing to some extent on theories of [[Henri Poincaré]], [[Ernst Mach]], [[Charles Henry (librarian)|Charles Henry]] and [[Henri Bergson]], Gleizes began to represent ''the object, no longer considered from a specific point of view, but rebuilt following a selection of successive viewpoints'' (i.e., as if viewed simultaneously from numerous viewpoints, and in four-dimensions). This technique of [[relative motion]] is pushed to a its highest degree of complexity in the monumental ''[[Harvest Threshing|Le Dépiquage des Moissons (Harvest Threshing)]]'' (1912). This ambitious work, with Delaunay's ''La Ville de Paris'' (''City of Paris''), is one of the largest paintings in the history of Cubism.

The Cubists were defended by the Socialist deputy, Marcel Sembat.&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick F. Barrer: ''Quand l'art du XXe siècle était conçu par les inconnus'', pp. 93–101, gives an account of the debate&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger, in preparation for the Salon de la Section d'Or, published a major defence of Cubism, resulting in the first theoretical essay on the new movement, entitled ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' (published by Eugène Figuière in 1912, translated to English and Russian in 1913).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondationgleizes.fr/albert-gleizes-oeuvre.html, Fondation Gleizes, Son Oeuvre]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory===
[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1912-13, Les Joueurs de football (Football Players), oil on canvas, 225.4 x 183 cm, National Gallery of Art.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Albert Gleizes, 1912-13, ''[[Les Joueurs de football|Les Joueurs de football (Football Players)]]'', oil on canvas, 225.4 x 183 cm (88.7 by 72 in.), [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington D.C.]]
In ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' Gleizes and Metzinger wrote: "If we wished to relate the space of the [Cubist] painters to geometry, we should have to refer it to the non-Euclidean mathematicians; we should have to study, at some length, certain of [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann's theorems]]." Cubism itself, then, was not based on any geometrical theory, but corresponded better to [[non-Euclidean geometry]] than classical or [[Euclidean geometry]]. The essential was in the understanding of space other than by the classical method of perspective; an understanding that would include and integrate the fourth dimension.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Henderson, 1983, The Fourth Dimension and NonEuclidean geometry in Modern Art&lt;/ref&gt; Cubism, with its new geometry, its dynamism and multiple view-point perspective, not only represented a departure from Euclid's model, but it achieved, according to Gleizes and Metzinger, a better representation of the real world: one that was mobile and changing in time. For Gleizes, Cubism represented a "''normal evolution of an art that was mobile like life itself''."&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke" /&gt;
In contrast to Picasso and Braque, Gleizes' intent was not to analyze and describe visual reality. Gleizes had argued that we cannot know the external world, we can only know our ''sensations''.&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke" /&gt; Objects from daily life⎯guitar, pipe or bowl of fruit⎯ did not satisfy his complex idealistic concepts of the physical world. His subjects were of vast scale and of provocative social and cultural meaning. Gleizes' iconography (as of Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Léger) helps to explain why there is no period in his work corresponding to analytic Cubism, and how it was possible for Gleizes to become an abstract painter, more theoretically in tune with Kandinsky and Mondrian than Picasso and Braque, who remained associated with visual reality.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

Gleizes' intent was to reconstitute and synthesize the real world according to his individual consciousness (''sensations''), through the use of volumes to convey the solidity and structure of objects. Their weight, placement and effects upon each other, and the inseparability of form and color, was one of the principal lessons of Cézanne. Forms were simplified and distorted, each shape and color modified by another, rather than splintered. His concern was to establish weight, density and volumetric relationships among sections of a broad subject. Gleizes himself characterized the 1910–11 phase of his work as an "analysis of volume relationships," though it bears little relation to the traditional use of the word "analytical" in our understanding of Cubism.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We laugh out loud when we think of all the novices who expiate their literal understanding of the remarks of a cubist and their faith in absolute truth by laboriously placing side by side the six faces of a cube and both ears of a model seen in profile." (Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger)&lt;ref name="Ganteführer" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1913, L'Homme au hamac, oil on canvas, 130 x 155.5 cm. Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Albert Gleizes, 1913, ''[[Man in a Hammock|L'Homme au Hamac (Man in a Hammock)]]'', oil on canvas, 130 x 155.5 cm, [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery]], Buffalo, New York]]
A central theme of ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' was that access to the true essence of the world could be gained by ''sensations'' alone. The sensation offered by classical painting was very limited: to only one point of view, from a single point in space and frozen in time. But the real world is mobile, both spatially and temporally. Classical perspective and the formulations of Euclidean geometry were only ''conventions'' (to use Poincaré's term) that distance us from the truth of our sensations, from the truth of our own human nature. Man sees the world of natural phenomena from a multitude of angles that form a continuum of sensations in perpetual and continuous change. The Cubists' aim was to completely eschew absolute space and time in favor of relative motion, to grasp through sensory appearances and translate onto a flat canvas the dynamical properties of the [[4-manifold|four-dimensional manifold]] (the natural world). Only then could one achieve a better representation of the mobile reality of our living experience. If Gleizes and Metzinger write in Du "Cubisme" that we can only know our sensations, it is not because they wish to disregard them, but, on the contrary, to understand them more deeply as the primary source for their own work. In reasoning this way, Gleizes and Metzinger demonstrate that they are successors to Cézanne, who insists that everything must be learnt from nature: "''Nature seen and nature felt... both of which must unite in order to endure.''"&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CKu9jzTIM-8C&amp;pg=PA107&amp;hl=fr&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q=both%20of%20which%20must%20unite%20in%20order%20to%20endure&amp;f=false Conversations with Cézanne, by Paul Cézanne, P.

In February 1913, Gleizes and other artists introduced the new style of European modern art to an American audience at the [[Armory Show]] (International Exhibition of Modern Art) in [[New York City]], [[Chicago]] and [[Boston]]. In addition to ''[[Man on a Balcony|Man on a balcony (l'Homme au Balcon)]]'' no. 196, Gleizes exhibited at the Armory Show his 1910 ''[[La Femme aux Phlox (Gleizes)|Femme aux Phlox (Woman with Phlox)]]'', Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/images/detail/armory-show-entry-form-albert-gleizes-painting-la-femme-aux-phlox-14516 Armory Show entry, Albert Gleizes' painting ''La Femme aux Phlox'', 1910, Walt Kuhn family papers, and Armory Show records, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/catalogueofinter00asso Catalogue of International Exhibition of Modern Art], Exhibition held at the Armory of the 69th Infantry, New York, from Feb. 15 to March 15, 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

Gleizes published an article in [[Ricciotto Canudo]]'s ''Montjoie!'' entitled "Cubisme et la tradition". It was through the intermediary of Canudo that Gleizes would meet the artist [[Juliette Roche]]; a childhood friend of [[Jean Cocteau]] and daughter of [[Jules Roche]], an influential politician of the 3rd Republic.&lt;ref name="Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie" /&gt;

With the outbreak of [[World War I]], Albert Gleizes re-enlisted in the French army. He was put in charge of organizing entertainment for the troops and as a result was approached by Jean Cocteau to design the set and costumes for the [[William Shakespeare]] play, ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', along with [[Georges Valmier]].&lt;ref name="Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie" /&gt;

Discharged from the military in the fall of 1915, Gleizes and his new wife, Juliette Roche, moved to New York, where they would meet regularly with [[Francis Picabia]], [[Man Ray]], Marcel Duchamp and [[Jean Crotti]] (who would eventually marry [[Suzanne Duchamp]]). It is at this time that Gleizes witnessed, with a critical eye, the [[readymades of Marcel Duchamp]]. After a short stay at the Albemarle Hotel Gleizes and his wife settled at 103 West Street, where Gleizes painted a series of works inspired by jazz music, skyscrapers, luminous signs and the [[Brooklyn Bridge]]. Here Gleizes met [[Stuart Davies]], [[Max Weber]], [[Joseph Stella]], and participated in a show at Montross Gallery with Duchamp, Crotti and Metzinger (who remained in Paris)&lt;ref name="Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie" /&gt;

From New York City, the couple sailed to [[Barcelona, Spain|Barcelona]] where they were joined by [[Marie Laurencin]], [[Francis Picabia]] and his wife. The group spent the summer painting at the resort area of [[Tossa de Mar]] and in November Gleizes opened his first [[solo exhibition]], at the [[Galeries Dalmau]] in Barcelona, 29 November – 12 December 1916.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pandora.girona.cat/viewer.vm?id=2934322&amp;view=dalmau&amp;lang=en Exposició Albert Gleizes, 29 November – 12 December 1916, Galeries Dalmau, Barcelona (catalogue)]&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to New York city in 1917, Gleizes began writing poetic sketches in verse and in prose, some of which were published in Picabia's [[Dada]] periodical [[391 (magazine)|391]]. Both Gleizes and his wife traveled from New York to [[Bermuda]] in September 1917,&lt;ref&gt;[http://bnl.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/BermudaNP02/id/42856/rec/1 The Royal Gazette, Bermuda Commercial and General Advertizer and Recorder, No. 115, 27 September 1917, p. 2]. Bermuda National Library, Digital Collection&lt;/ref&gt; where he painted a number of landscapes. When the war in Europe ended they returned to France where his career evolved more towards teaching through writing and he became involved with the committee of the ''Unions Intellectuelles Françaises''.&lt;ref name="Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke" /&gt;

During the winter of 1918 at the Gleizes' rented house in Pelham New York, writes Daniel Robbins, Albert Gleizes came to his wife and said, "A terrible thing has happened to me: I believe I am finding God." This new religious conviction resulted not from any mystical visions but instead from Gleizes' rational confrontation of three urgent problems: collective order, individual differences and the painter's role. Although Gleizes did not join the Church until 1941, his next twenty-five years were spent in a logical effort not only to find God but also to have faith.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

From 1914 and extending to the end of the New York period, Gleizes' nonrepresentational paintings and those with an apparent visual basis existed side by side, differing only, writes Daniel Robbins, in "the degree of abstraction hidden by the uniformity with which they were painted and by the constant effort to tie the plastic realization of the painting to a specific, even unique, experience."&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt; Gleizes approached abstraction conceptually rather than visually and in 1924 his intricate dialectic caused him to produce two amusing paintings which departed from his usual subject matter: the Imaginary Still Lifes, Blue and Green. In effect, writes Robbins, "Gleizes would have inverted Courbet's "Show me an angel and I will paint you an angel" to be "As long as an angel remains an unembodied ideal and cannot be shown to me, I'll paint it."&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

By 1919 the pre-war sense of the Cubist movement had been virtually shattered. Paris was overshadowed by a strong reaction against those visions of common effort and revolutionary construction which Gleizes continued to embrace, while the avant-garde was characterized by the anarchic and, to him, destructive spirit of Dada. Neither alternative held any appeal for him and, with the Salons dominated by a return to classicism, his old hostility to Paris was constantly nourished. Gleizes' attempt to resuscitate the spirit of the Section d'Or was met with great difficulty, despite support by [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Georges Braque]] and [[Léopold Survage]].&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt; His own organizational efforts were directed towards the re-establishment of a European-wide movement of abstract artists in the form of a large travelling exhibition, the ''Exposition de la Section d’Or'', in 1920; it was not the success he had hoped for. Cubism was passé for younger artists, although Gleizes, on the contrary, felt that only its preliminary phase had been investigated.&lt;ref name="MoMA, Daniel Robbins"/&gt;

It was the revival of the Section d'Or which ensured that Cubism in general and Gleizes in particular would become Dada's preferred target.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green, 1987"&gt;Christopher Green, 1987, Cubism and its Enemies: Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916–1928. Yale University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, an effort to organize an artists' cooperative received the support of Robert Delaunay, but of no other major artists.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt; The polemic resulted in the publication of ''Du cubisme et des moyens de le comprendre'' by Albert Gleizes, followed in 1922 by ''Painting and its Laws (La Peinture et ses lois)'', within which appear the notion of ''translation'' and ''rotation'' that would ultimately characterize both the pictorial and theoretical aspects of Gleizes' art.&lt;ref name="Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie" /&gt; His post-Cubist style of the twenties—flat, forthright, uncompromising—is virtually [[Blaise Pascal]]'s "Spirit of Geometry."&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

Gleizes was in nearly every sense a maverick Cubist, perhaps the most unyielding of them all; both in his paintings and writings (which had a big impact on the image of Cubism in Europe and the United States). He developed a single-minded, thoroughly uncompromising Cubism without the diversion of a classical alternative. During the 1920s Gleizes worked on a highly abstract brand of Cubism. In addition to his shows at [[Léonce Rosenberg]]'s L'Effort Moderne, the dealer-publisher Povolozky printed his writings. His art was indeed backed by a prodigious theoretical effluence, most notably in ''La Peinture et ses lois'' (first published in ''La Vie des Lettres'', October 1922). Gleizes fused aesthetic, metaphysical, moral and social priorities to describe the status and function of art.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green, 1987" /&gt;

===Painting and its Laws===
In ''La Peinture et ses lois'' writes Robbins, "Gleizes deduced the rules of painting from the picture plane, its proportions, the movement of the human eye and the laws of the universe. This theory, later referred to as ''translation-rotation'', ranks with the writings of Mondrian and Malevich as one of the most thorough expositions of the principles of abstract art, which in his case entailed the rejection not only of representation but also of geometric forms."&lt;ref name="MoMA, Daniel Robbins" /&gt; Flat planes were set in motion simultaneously to evoke space by shifting across one another, as if rotating and tilting on oblique axes. Diagrams entitled "''Simultaneous movements of rotation and shifting of the plane on its axis''" were published to illustrate the concept. 

Gleizes undertook the task of writing the characterizations of these principles in ''Painting and its Laws'' (''La Peinture et ses lois''), published by gallery owner Jacques Povolozky in the journal ''La Vie des lettres et des arts'', 1922-23, as a book in 1924,&lt;ref name="Brooke, 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org/form-and-history/poznanski/painting-and-its-laws.html Albert Gleizes, ''Painting and Its Laws'', summary by Peter Brooke]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alibert"&gt;Pierre Alibert, ''Gleizes, Naissance et avenire du cubisme'', Aubin-Visconti, Edition Dumas, Saint-Etienne, October 1982, {{ISBN|2-85529-000-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reproduced in [[Léonce Rosenberg]]'s ''Bulletin de l'Effort moderne'', no. 13, March 1925, no. 14, April 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes, ''La Peinture et ses lois, Ce qui devait sortir du Cubisme'', Bulletin de l'Effort moderne, no. 13, March 1925, no. 14, April 1925&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Gleizes's primary objectives was to answer the questions: How will the planar surface be animated, and by what logical method, independent of the artists ''fantaisie'', can it be attained?&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois"&gt;Albert Gleizes, ''La Peinture et ses lois, Ce qui devait sortir du cubisme'', La Vie des lettres et des arts, 1922-3, 1924 in book form&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The approach:'''&lt;br /&gt;
Gleizes bases these laws both on truisms inherent throughout the history of art, and especially on his own experience since 1912, such as: ''The primary goal of art has never been exterior imitation'' (p.&amp;nbsp;31); ''Artworks come from emotion... the product of individual sensibility and taste'' (p.&amp;nbsp;42); ''The artist is always in a state of emotion, sentimental exaltation [ivresse]'' (p.&amp;nbsp;43); ''The painting in which the idea of abstract creation is realized is no longer an anecdote, but a concrete fact'' (p.&amp;nbsp;56); ''Creating a painted artwork is not the emission of an opinion'' (p.&amp;nbsp;59); ''The plastic dynamism will be born out of rhythmic relations between objects... establishing novel plastic liaisons between purely objective elements that compose the painting'' (p.&amp;nbsp;22).&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes, ''Le Cubisme et la Tradition'', Montjoie!, Paris, 10 February 1913, p. 4. Reprinted as ''A Propos du Salon d'Automne'', in ''Tradition et Cubisme'', Paris, 1927. Gleizes outlines what he perceives as the 'decadence' inherent in the modern art.&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing, Gleizes states that the 'reality' of a painting is not that of a mirror, but of the object... issue of imminent logic (p.&amp;nbsp;62). 'The subject-pretext tending toward numeration, inscribed following the nature of the plane, attains a tangent intersections between known images of the natural world and unknown images that reside within intuition' (p.&amp;nbsp;63).&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

'''Defining the laws:'''&lt;br /&gt;
Rhythm and space are for Gleizes the two vital conditions. Rhythm is a consequence of the continuity of certain phenomena, variable or invariable, following from mathematical relations. Space is a conception of the human psyche that follows from quantitative comparisons (pp.&amp;nbsp;35, 38, 51). This mechanism  is the foundation for artistic expression. It is therefor both a philosophical and scientific synthesis. For Gleizes, Cubism was a means to arrive not only at a new mode of expression but above all a new way of thinking. This was, according to art historian {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre Alibert (historian)|fr|Pierre Alibert|lt=Pierre Alibert}}, the foundation of both a new species of painting and an alternative relationship with the world; hence another principle of civilization.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

The problem set out by Gleizes was to replace ''anecdote'' as a starting point for the work of art, by the sole means of using the elements of the painting itself: line, form and color.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

Beginning with a central rectangle, taken as an example of elementary form, Gleizes points out two mechanical ways of juxtaposing form to create a painting: (1) either by reproducing the initial form (employing various [[Symmetry (geometry)|symmetries]] such as reflectional, rotational or translational), or by modifying (or not) its dimensions.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt; (2) By displacement of the initial form; pivoting around an imaginary axis in one direction or another.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

The choice of position (through translation and/or rotation), though based on the inspiration of the artist, is no longer attributed to the anecdotal. An objective and rigorous method, independent of the painter, replaces emotion or sensibility in the determination the placement of form, that is through ''translation'' and ''rotation''.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

'''Schematic illustrations:'''&lt;br /&gt;

[[File:Albert Gleizes (after) 1. Mouvements de translation du plan sur un côté.jpg|thumb|center|upright=2.9||&lt;div align="center"&gt;1. Movements of translation of the plane to one side&lt;/div&gt;]]

Space and rhythm, according to Gleizes, are perceptible by the extent of movement (displacement) of planar surfaces. These elemental transformations modify the position and importance of the initial plane, whether they converge or diverge ('recede' or 'advance') from the eye, creating a series of new and separate spatial planes appreciable physiologically by the observer.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

[[File:Albert Gleizes (after) 2. Mouvements simultanés de rotation et de translation du plan.jpg|thumb|center|upright=2.9|&lt;div align="center"&gt;2. Simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane&lt;/div&gt;]]

Another movement is added to the first movement of translation of the plane to one side: Rotation of the plane. Fig. I shows the resulting formation that follows from simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the initial plane produced on the axis. Fig II and Fig. III represent the simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the rectangle, inclined to the right and to the left. The axis point at which movement is realized is established by the observer. Fig. IV represents the simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the rectangle plane, with the position of the eye of the observed displaced left of the axis. Displacement toward the right (though not represented) is straightforward enough to imagine.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

[[File:Albert Gleizes (after) 3. Mouvements simultanés de rotation et de translation du plan aboutissant à la création d'un organisme plastique spatial et rythmique.jpg|thumb|center|upright=2.9|&lt;div align="center"&gt;3. Simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane resulting in the creation of a spatial and rhythmic plastic organism&lt;/div&gt;]]

With these figures Gleizes attempts to present, under the most simple conditions possible (simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane), the creation of a spatial and rhythmic organism (Fig. VIII), with practically no initiative taken on the part of the artist who controls the evolutionary process. The planar surfaces of Fig. VIII are filled with hatching espousing the 'direction' of the planes. What emerges in the inert plane, according to Gleizes, through the movement followed by the eye of the observer, is "a visible imprint of successive stages of which the initial rhythmic cadence coordinated a succession of differing states". These successive stages permit the perception of space. The initial state, by consequence of the transformation, has become a spatial and rhythmic organism.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

[[File:Albert Gleizes (after) 4. Systéme plastique spatial et rythmique obtenue par la conjugaison des mouvements simultanés de rotation et de translation du plan et des mouvements de translation du plan sur un côté.jpg|thumb|center|upright=2.5|&lt;div align="center"&gt;4. Plastic spatial and rhythmic system obtained by the conjugation of simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane and from the movements of translation of the plane to one side&lt;/div&gt;]]

Fig. I and Fig. II obtain mechanically, Gleizes writes, with minimal personal initiative, a "plastic spatial and rhythmic system", by the conjugation of simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane and from the movements of translation of the plane to one side. The result is a spatial and rhythmic organism more ''complex'' than shown in Fig. VIII; demonstrating through mechanical, purely plastic means, the realization of a material universe independent of intentional intervention by the artist. This is sufficient to demonstrate, according to Gleizes, the ''possibilities of the plane'' to serve spatially and rhythmically by its own power.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt; [''L'exposé hâtif de cette mécanique purement plastique aboutissant à la réalisation d'un univers matériel en dehors de l'intervention particulière intentionnelle, suffit à démontrer la ''possibilité du plan'' de signifier spatialement et rythmiquement par sa seule puissance''].&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

Gleizes' painting of 1920–1922, submitted to the same rigor, were not Cubist in any conventional sense; but they ''were'' Cubist in their concern with [[Planimetrics|planimetric]] space, and in their relationship (synthesis) with subject-matter. Indeed, the abstract appearance of these compositions is misleading. Gleizes had always remained committed to synthesis. He described how artists had freed themselves from the 'subject-image' as a pretext to work from the 'subjectless-image' (nebulous forms) until they came together. The images known from the natural world combined with those nebulous forms were made 'spiritually human'. Though Gleizes considered his works as initially nonrepresentational and only afterwards as denotational.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green, 1987" /&gt;

Before World War I, Gleizes had always been identified as a Cubist avant-garde. And during the twenties he continued to hold a prominent position, but he was no longer identified with the avant-garde since Cubism had been superseded by Dada and [[Surrealism]]. Even after historians began their attempts to analyze the vital role played by Cubism, the name of Albert Gleizes was always mentioned because of his early and important participation in the movement. Gleizes had never ceased to call himself a Cubist and theoretically a Cubist he remained. In many ways his theories were close to those developed by Mondrian, though his paintings never submitted to the discipline of primary colors and the right angle; they were not Neo-Plastic (or [[De Stijl]]) in character. In fact, his works from the late 1920s through the 1940s looked like nothing else that was being done, and indeed, they were rarely seen in the art world because Gleizes deliberately distanced himself from extensive participation in the Parisian scene.&lt;ref name="MoMA, Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

Gleizes realized that his evolution towards 'purity' carried with it the risk of alienation from the 'mentality of the milieu', but he saw it as the sole means of arriving at a new type of art that could reach a mass audience (just as the French murals of the 11th and 12th centuries). In ''Du Cubisme et les moyens de comprendre'' (1920), Gleizes went so far as to envisage the mass-production of painting; as a means of undermining the market system and thus the status of artworks as commodities. 'The multiplication of pictures,' Gleizes wrote, 'strikes at the heart of the understanding and the economic notions of the bourgeois.'&lt;ref name="Christopher Green, 1987" /&gt;

===1920s–1930s===

After World War I, with the support given by the dealer [[Léonce Rosenberg]], Cubism returned as a central issue for artists. With the Salons dominated by a return to classicism, Gleizes attempted to resuscitate the spirit of the [[Section d'Or]] in 1920 but was met with great difficulty, despite support by [[Fernand Léger]], [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Constantin Brâncuși]], [[Henri Laurens]], [[Jacques Villon]], [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]], [[Louis Marcoussis]] and [[Léopold Survage]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/albertgleizes1881robb#page/n3/mode/2up Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 - 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Published by The Solomon R.

The idea was to bring together a collection of works that revealed the complete process of transformation and renewal that had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes, ''The Epic, From immobile form to mobile form'', in [http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/gltexts/epic#anchor1066855 Peter Brooke, Texts by Gleizes]&lt;/ref&gt; It was not the success he had hoped for. Cubism was seen as passé for emerging artists and other established artists such as Marcel Duchamp and Picabia, although Gleizes, on the contrary, felt that only its preliminary phase had been investigated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=2191 Daniel Robbins, Museum of Modern Art, New York, MoMA, Albert Gleizes, Grove Art Online, 2009 Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Cubists works (which already represented a wide variety of styles), the second edition of the Section d'Or held at the Galerie La Boétie from 5 March 1920 included [[De Stijl]], [[Bauhaus]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] and [[Futurism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt322.html La Section d'Or, Kubisme.info] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001140051/http://www.kubisme.info/kt322.html |date=2015-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the revival of the Section d'Or which ensured that Cubism in general would become [[Dadaism|Dada]]'s preferred target.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Green, 1987, Cubism and its Enemies: Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916-1928. Yale University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The new polemic resulted in the publication of ''Du cubisme et des moyens de le comprendre'' by Gleizes, followed in 1922 by ''La Peinture et ses lois''.&lt;ref&gt;Gino Severini, ''From Cubism to Classicism''. Albert Gleizes, ''Painting and its Laws'', Translation, introduction and notes by Peter Brooke, published by Francis Boutle, London, 2001, {{ISBN|978 1 903427 05 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondationgleizes.fr/pdf/fag-chronologie-gleizes.pdf Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie (French)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112092816/http://fondationgleizes.fr/pdf/fag-chronologie-gleizes.pdf |date=2008-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of Jules Roche, the Gleizes' had enough independent income and real estate to pursue their goals without bowing to material considerations, unlike many other artists. The Gleizes' spent more and more time at the family home in Serrières, in Cavalaire, and an even quieter location on the [[French Riviera]], both associating with people more sympathetic to their social ideas. Gleizes became active in the ''Union Intellectuelle'' and lectured extensively in France, Germany, Poland and England, while continuing to write. In 1924–25 the Bauhaus (where certain ideals analogous to his own were practiced) requested a new book on Cubism (as part of a series which included [[Wassily Kandinsky]]'s ''Point and Line to Plane'', Paul Klee's ''Pedagogical Notebooks'', and [[Kasimir Malevich]]'s ''The Non-Objective World''&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke" /&gt;). Gleizes, in response, would write ''Kubismus'' (published in 1928) for the collection of Bauhausbücher 13, Munich. The publication of Kubismus in French the following year would bring Gleizes closer to Delaunay.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie" /&gt; In 1924 Gleizes, Léger and [[Amédée Ozenfant]] opened ''Académie Moderne''.&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke" /&gt;

In 1927, still dreaming of the communal days at the Abbaye de Créteil, Gleizes founded an artist's colony at a rented house called the ''{{ill|Moly-Sabata|fr}}'' in [[Sablons, Isère|Sablons]] near his wife's family home in Serrières in the [[Ardèche]] département in the Rhône Valley.&lt;ref name="Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke" /&gt;

[[Léonce Rosenberg]], in 1929, commissioned Gleizes (replacing [[Gino Severini]]) to paint decorative panels for his Parisian residence, which would be installed in 1931. The same year Gleizes was part of the committee of Abstraction-Création (founded by [[Theo van Doesburg]], [[Auguste Herbin]], [[Jean Hélion]] and [[Georges Vantongerloo]]) that acted as a forum for international [[abstract art|non-representational art]], and counteracted the influence of the [[Surrealist]] group led by [[André Breton]]. By this time, his work reflected the strengthening of his religious convictions and his 1932 book, ''Vers une conscience plastique, La Forme et l’histoire'' examines [[Celtic art|Celtic]], [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]], and [[Orient]]al art. On tour in [[Poland]] and [[Germany]], he gave lectures titled ''Art et Religion, Art et Production'' and ''Art et Science'' and wrote a book on Robert Delaunay but it was never published.&lt;ref name="Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke" /&gt;

In 1934 Gleizes began a series of paintings that would continue for several years, in which three levels are identified: ''static translation'', corresponding to his researches of the 1920s; ''mobile rotation'', corresponding to his researches into coloured cadences of the late 1920s and early 1930s; and ''simple grey arcs'' which, Gleizes argues, gives the 'form' or unifying 'rhythm' of the painting. The level of 'translation' is generally a geometrical figure evoking a representational image, unlike the work of the early 1930s. These works no longer articulate the strict non-representation of ''Abstraction Création''. [[Léonce Rosenberg]]—who had already published Gleizes extensively in his ''Bulletin de l'Effort Moderne'', but had not previously shown much enthusiasm for his painting—was deeply impressed by Gleizes' paintings (which followed from his 1934 research) at the Salon d'Automne. This was the beginning of a close relationship with Gleizes, which continued through the 1930s and is reflected in a stream of correspondence.&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke" /&gt;

In 1937, Gleizes was commissioned to paint murals for the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne]] at the Paris World’s Fair. He collaborated with Delaunay in the ''Pavillon de l'Air'' and with [[Léopold Survage]] and Fernand Léger for the ''Pavillon de l'Union des Artistes Modernes''. At the end of 1938, Gleizes volunteered to participate in the free seminars and discussion groups for young painters set up by Robert Delaunay at his Paris studio.&lt;ref name="Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke" /&gt; Then Gleizes, in collaboration with [[Jacques Villon]], conceived the idea of executing a mural for the auditorium of the École des Arts et Métiers; the latter was rejected by the school authorities as too abstract, but immense panels by Gleizes survive as ''Four Legendary Figures of the Sky'' (San Antonio, TX, McNay A. Inst.). Other examples of this ambitious public style include ''The Transfiguration'' (1939–41; Lyon, Mus. B.-A.).

In the late 1930s, the wealthy American art connoisseur [[Peggy Guggenheim]] purchased a great deal of the new art in Paris including works by Albert Gleizes. She brought these works to the United States which today form part of the [[Peggy Guggenheim Collection]].

===World War II and after===
During [[World War II]], Gleizes and his wife remained in France under the German occupation. In 1942 Gleizes began the series of ''Supports de Contemplation'', large scale, entirely non-representational paintings that are both very complex and very serene.&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke" /&gt; Materials being difficult to obtain during the war, Gleizes painted on burlap, sizing the porous material with a mixture of glue and paint. He had used burlap in some of his earliest paintings and now found it favorable to his vigorous touch, for it took the most powerful strokes even while preserving the matte surface he so valued. In 1952, Gleizes realized his last major work, a fresco titled ''Eucharist'' that he painted for a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] chapel in [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]].&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke" /&gt;

Albert Gleizes died in [[Avignon]] in the [[Vaucluse]] département on 23 June 1953 and was interred in his wife's family mausoleum in the cemetery at Serrières.

==Legacy==
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Gleizes' individual development, his unique struggle to reconcile forces," writes Daniel Robbins, "made him one of the few painters to come out of Cubism with a wholly individual style, undeflected by later artistic movements. Although he occasionally returned to earlier subjects... these later works were treated anew, on the basis of fresh insights. He never repeated his earlier styles, never remained stationary, but always grew more intense, more passionate. [...] His life ended in 1953 but his paintings remain to testify to his willingness to struggle for final answers. His is an abstract art of deep significance and meaning, paradoxically human even in his very search for absolute order and truth." (Daniel Robbins, 1964)&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Commemoration==
In celebration of the 100th anniversary of the publication of ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' by Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger, the [[Musée de La Poste]] in Paris presented a show entitled ''Gleizes – Metzinger. Du cubisme et après'', from 9 May to 22 September 2012. Over 80 paintings and drawings, along with documents, films and 15 works by other members of the Section d'Or group (Villon, Duchamp-Villon, Kupka, Le Fauconnier, Lhote, La Fresnaye, Survage, Herbin, Marcoussis, Archipenko...) were included in the show. A catalogue in French and English was published for the event. A French postage stamp is issued representing works by Gleizes (''Le Chant de Guerre'', 1915) and Metzinger (''L'Oiseau Bleu'', 1913). This is the first time that a museum has organized an exhibit showcasing both Gleizes and Metzinger together.&lt;ref&gt;Musée de La Poste, Galerie du Messager, Paris, France, [http://www.ladressemuseedelaposte.fr/Gleizes-Metzinger-Du-cubisme-et-1826 ''Gleizes – Metzinger.

The '''Antigua Public Library''' is the national library of [[Antigua and Barbuda]], located in [[St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda]].

== History ==
One of the earliest sources of books on the island was through the work of the Reverend [[Thomas Bray]] in the late 17th Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=25549065 |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/25549065?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102291745291 |title="Before the Public": Some Early Libraries of Antigua |accessdate=7 June 2013 |volume=38 |pages=1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various library societies grew to prominence in the mid-19th Century, including the Antigua Library Society and the Presbyterian Church Library. The colonial government transformed the Antigua Library Society into the Antigua Public Library in 1854.

== Old building==
On 8 October 1974, a destructive earthquake hit the island, causing the old wooden building to be damaged and closed. A sign was affixed to the building noting "This building was damaged in the earthquake of 1974. Repairs are pending", and the library was relocated to a small area upstairs above a dry good store on Market Street, St Johns. That the sign was still in place a decade and more after the earthquake was a major theme of ''[[A Small Place]]'', a 1988 book by [[Jamaica Kincaid]], which suggested that the continued use of the inadequate building, too small to house all the books from the old library, demonstrated the indifference of the post-colonial government to matters of culture and learning.

== New building ==

An EC$1 million donation from [[Allen Stanford]] was received in December 2004, in order to reduce the time for completion of the library from the 'too long' one year to six months, with a promise from him to match further donations received.

The '''Australian Curriculum''' is a [[national curriculum]] for all primary and secondary schools in [[Australia]] under progressive development, review, and implementation. The curriculum is developed and reviewed by the [[Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority]], an independent statutory body. Since 2014 all [[States and territories of Australia|states and territories]] in Australia have begun implementing aspects of the Foundation to Year 10 part of the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority [http://www.acara.edu.au/_resources/ACARA_infographic.pdf infographic]&lt;/ref&gt;

Credentialing, and related assessment requirements and processes, remain the responsibility of states and territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently asked questions|url=http://www.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/australian-curriculum/faq.html#affect-assessment-credentialling|publisher=www.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
A nationwide curriculum has been on the political agenda in [[Australia]] for several decades. In the late 1980s a significant push for a [[national curriculum]] in Australia was mounted by the [[Bob Hawke|Hawke]] Federal Labor government. Draft documentation was produced but failure to achieve agreement from the mainly [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] State governments led to the abandonment of this initiative in 1991.

In 2006, then Liberal Prime Minister [[John Howard]] called for a "root and branch renewal" of Australian history teaching at school level, ostensibly in response to building criticism of Australian students' (and Australians more widely) perceived lack of awareness of historical events.  The Howard government convened the Australian History Summit in August 2006 to commence the process of drafting a national History curriculum.  The Summit recommended that Australian History be a compulsory part of the curriculum in all Australian schools in years 9 and 10.  The Australian History External Reference Group was then commissioned by the government to develop a ''Guide to Teaching Australian History in Years 9 and 10''.  The Reference Group comprised [[Geoffrey Blainey]], [[Gerard Henderson]], [[Nicholas Brown (historian)|Nicholas Brown]] and [[Elizabeth Ward (historian)|Elizabeth Ward]], and was presented with a draft proposal prepared earlier by the historian [[Tony Taylor (historian)|Tony Taylor]].  The ''Guide'' was released to the public on 11 October 2007, but little was achieved toward its implementation following the Howard government's defeat at the federal election in November 2007. The current Labor initiated National History Curriculum remains politically contentious.

In April 2008, the Rudd Government established the independent [[National Curriculum Board (Australia)|National Curriculum Board]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deewr.gov.au/Ministers/Gillard/Media/Releases/Pages/Article_081107_114135.aspx Minister for Education: Media release: Delivering Australia's First National Curriculum, 12 October 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Tony Taylor, who had written the original draft for the Howard government-appointed Australian History External Reference Group, told ''[[The Age]]'' that he expected that the Reference Group's ''Guide to Teaching Australian History'' would be discarded by the new Board.  Taylor had expressed public disapproval of the changes made to his original draft, both by the Reference Group and, Taylor suspected, by Howard himself.  Taylor was of the opinion that the ''Guide'' had sought to establish a curriculum that was "too close to a nationalist view of Australia's past", and hoped that the new Board would produce a curriculum that was more in line with what Taylor saw as Rudd's "regional and global world view".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rudd to scrap Howard's history|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2008/01/09/1199554741706.html|publisher=www.theage.com.au|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008, the Board appointed four academics to draft "framing documents" which would establish a broad direction for the National Curriculum in each of four subject areas: History ([[Stuart Macintyre]]), English ([[Peter Freebody]]), Science ([[Denis Goodrum]]) and Mathematics ([[Peter Sullivan (pedagogue)|Peter Sullivan]]). In May 2009 the [[Statutory authority|statutory]] Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA) was established to oversee the implementation of the planned nationwide curriculum initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deewr.gov.au/Ministers/Gillard/Media/Releases/Pages/Article_090603_143742.aspx Minister for Education: Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority: Joint Media Release with the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment Training and Youth Affairs, 3 June 2009] In March 2010 a draft national curriculum was released.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation issues and criticism==

The Australian Curriculum has experienced implementation issues due to reluctance or slowness by some States in changing state curricula. New South Wales in particular has delayed its roll out of the new curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Education: NSW goes slow on primary curriculum as Commonwealth chalks up changes|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/education-nsw-goes-slow-on-primary-curriculum-as-commonwealth-chalks-up-changes-20150920-gjqpd1.html|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, Anna Patty, an education editor for the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', criticised the Australian Curriculum on the basis that it "threatens to water down the content" for senior students, compared with the existing Higher School Certificate. Under the new curriculum, students would have to learn statistics in mathematics, while the Extension 1 and 2 topics would be replaced with an easier specialist maths course.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=National curriculum content not up to scratch: critics|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/education/national-curriculum-content-not-up-to-scratch-critics-20100514-v4gt.html|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patty said that the English courses would focus more on language and literacy, and less on literature, and that the curriculum would disadvantage gifted students.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In September 2010, the NSW Board of Studies criticised the then draft Australian Curriculum, saying that it was inferior to the NSW curriculum.  Among other criticisms, the Board said that the draft K-10 curriculum lacked an overarching framework, was overcrowded with content, diminished the teaching of literature, and that the maths curriculum failed to cater to the full range of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/education/new-curriculum-slammed-by-studies-board-20100912-156ze.html|title=New curriculum slammed by studies board|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, Peter Brown, a mathematics lecturer of the [[University of New South Wales]], criticised the Australian Curriculum for lack of flexibility within the Year 9-10 and the Year 11-12 syllabuses by the removal of extension maths courses.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/letters/no-water-to-throw-on-heated-debate-20101015-16nlj|title=No water to throw on heated debate|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown also said that the National Curriculum would "dumb down" the year 12 curriculum then offered in NSW.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In October 2013, conservative economist [[Judith Sloan]] criticised the business and economics components of the Australian Curriculum in particular, and offered the general criticism that "[t]he real rationale for a national school curriculum relates to the pursuit of centralised control by the federal government and the scope to impose fashionable values dressed up as the pursuit of educational excellence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='National curriculum mired in half-baked fads'|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/columnists/national-curriculum-mired-in-half-baked-fads/news-story/4dea704318ad475c218038da10e67178|website=The Australian|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6238">Professor '''Blessings Chinsinga''' is a Malawian lecturer at the centre of the Malawi Academic Freedom Stand off and eventual protests. He was a Senior Lecturer in Development Administration, Public Policy Analysis and Institutions, and Development at University of Malawi's Chancellor College.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africaresearchinstitute.org/advisory-board-article.php?i=K3GUHMNW4V Dr Blessings Chinsinga - Advisory Board - Africa Research Institute&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029165743/http://www.africaresearchinstitute.org/advisory-board-article.php?i=K3GUHMNW4V |date=October 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic Stand-off==
The stand off began when Dr Blessings Chinsinga, who was an associate political science professor, was interrogated by [[Peter Mukhito]], Malawi’s Inspector General of Police. In a political science lecture he had drawn comparisons between Malawi’s fuel crisis and popular uprisings in [[Tunisia]] and [[Egypt]] during the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110714020001/http://www.malawidemocrat.com/education/malawi-university-lock-out-is-illegal-%E2%80%93lecturers/ Malawi Democrat – Malawi news from Malawi online » Malawi University lock-out is illegal, court agrees&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This comparison was reported to the police and he  was eventually fired along with Jessie Kabwira Kapasula, Gaston Kanchedzera and Edge Kanyongoro.

This move received much criticism from faculty at the university including president of the Chancellor College Academic Staff Union (CCASU), [[Jessie Kabwila-Kapasula]].  It also prompted protests from the University of Malawi students, predominantly from the Chancellor College and Polytechnic campuses, who stood in solidarity with Chinsinga and CCASU in support of academic freedom. The protest led to the eventual closing of UNIMA's Chancellor College and Polytechnic.

It led to the involvement of the then Minister Education, [[Peter Mutharika]] and his brother President [[Bingu wa Mutharika]]. President Mutharika ordered the lecturers back to class.

As a condition to return to class, the academics asked for an official apology from the police chief, [[Peter Mukhito]] and assurances of respect for academic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/Butty-Malawi-University-Lecturers-Update-Kabwila-Kapasula-22march11-118415189.html Malawi College Teacher Boycott Shows No Sign of Ending&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The police Inspector General Mukhito declared that academic freedom had to be balanced because this was an issue of national security. This statement was supported by [[Bingu wa Mutharika]] who encouraged him not to apologize because of a 'mere lecture'. The failure to resolve this matter and a stand off occurred between lecturers and students on one side, and the President of Malawi, [[Bingu wa Mutharika]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyasatimes.com/malawi/2011/09/21/police-quiz-poly-academic-dons-over-pressure-group/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401205553/http://www.nyasatimes.com/malawi/2011/09/21/police-quiz-poly-academic-dons-over-pressure-group/ |archivedate=2012-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The students stood in solidarity with the fired faculty which resulted in the use of teargas to disperse students and an indefinite closure of the university.

===Commission===

An Academic Freedom Commission to solve the academic stand off was formed headed by former chancellor [[Brown Chimphamba]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstimeafrica.com/archives/20538 Mutharika’s TV address on university impasse misleading – CCASU | Newstime Africa&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court Case===
The register closed the two colleges of the university under the orders of the then President, who is both the Commander-in-Chief of the Malawi Police Service and Chancellor of the University of Malawi, in defiance of a court order that the lecturers had obtained.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://www.capitalradiomalawi.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=129%3Aacademicfreedom&amp;Itemid=164{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A court order had also a court order halted the dismissal of the staff and prevented the university council from withholding salaries of the lecturers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Thus a complete lock-out of campuses of the two colleges could not be achieved.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Authorities eventually ordered the indefinite closure of the two colleges.

=== Causes of Malawi Protests===
The Academic Stand off was one of the factors that led to the [[2011 Malawian protests|July 20, 2011 nationwide protests]]. Civil society was demanding the reinstatement of the professor and the guarantee of academic freedom.

'''Christine Anne Milne''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AO}} ({{nee|'''Morris'''}}; born 14 May 1953)&lt;ref name="tasparl"&gt;[http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/history/tasparl/milnec678.htm Parliamentary Library profile], ''Parliament of Tasmania''&lt;/ref&gt; is a former Australian Senator and was leader of the parliamentary caucus of the [[Australian Greens]] from 2012 to 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/political-news/bob-brown-resigns-as-greens-leader-and-senator-20120413-1wxoz.html | title=Bob Brown resigns as Greens leader and Senator | publisher=The Age | date=13 April 2012 | accessdate=13 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Milne stepped down as leader on 6 May 2015, replaced by [[Richard Di Natale]].

==Early life and education==
Milne was born in [[Latrobe, Tasmania]], the second daughter of Wesley Vale dairy farmers Tom and June Morris. She attended Wesley Vale Area School from 1959 to 1963, [[St Mary's College, Hobart]] as a boarder from 1964 to 1969, and completed her final year of schooling at [[Devonport High School]] in 1970.

She studied history and political science at the [[University of Tasmania]] from 1971 to 1974, where she resided at [[St. John Fisher College (University of Tasmania)|Ena Waite University College]] and was elected its President. She graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree with Honours in Australian History, and a Certificate of Education in March 1975.

From 1975 to 1984 Milne worked as a secondary school teacher, teaching English, History and Social Science at [[Parklands High School (Burnie)|Parklands High School]], [[Devonport High School]] and [[Don College]]. She first came to public attention for her role in opposing the building of the [[Wesley Vale pulp mill]] near [[Bass Strait]] in North Western Tasmania on the basis of its environmental impact. She also participated in the ultimately successful campaign opposing the [[Franklin Dam]] and was arrested and jailed in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/senators/milne.htm | title=Senator Christine Milne | work=Q&amp;A | publisher=ABC Television | accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked as a research officer with the Australian Bicentennial Historical Records Search from 1987 to 1988.

==Political career==
Milne was first elected to the [[Tasmanian House of Assembly]] in 1989 as a member of the [[Tasmanian Greens]] in the electorate of [[Division of Lyons (state)|Lyons]],&lt;ref name="tasparl"/&gt; one of five Green politicians elected at that election. She was part of the [[Labor–Green Accord]], a political agreement between the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Tasmanian Greens to form government after the 1989 general election had resulted in a [[hung parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first=Airlie | last=Ward | url=http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/tas/content/2006/s1588941.htm | title=Minority Government | work=Stateline Tasmania | publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | date=10 March 2006 | accessdate=10 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Bob Brown]] stood down in 1993 to contest the federal election, she became leader of the Greens in the Tasmanian Parliament and the first female leader of a political party in Tasmania.&lt;ref name="tasparl"/&gt;

[[File:2014-09-21 Christine Milne Peoples Climate March Melbourne 600 0479.JPG|thumb|Christine Milne speaking at the Peoples Climate March in Melbourne in September 2014|left]]

She oversaw a loose alliance between the Greens and Liberals after the 1996 general election. During that time, Tasmania saw significant economic and social reform. Measures included gun law reform, liberalisation of gay laws, an apology to the Indigenous stolen generation and support for an Australian republic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/txt/s3272234.htm], "ABC's Q&amp;A"&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1998, the major parties voted to restructure the House of Assembly from 35 to 25 seats, increasing the quota of votes required to be elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly. Liberal Premier Tony Rundle immediately called an election, which his party subsequently lost. Due to the changes, Milne lost her seat, leaving the Greens with one remaining seat.

After her career in state politics, she was an adviser to Senator [[Bob Brown]] from 2000 until she was elected to represent Tasmania in the Federal [[Australian Senate|Senate]] at the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]].&lt;ref name="senatebio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au/piweb/TranslateWIPILink.aspx?Folder=BIOGS&amp;Criteria=NAME_ID:KA5%3B|title=Christine Milne, Senate Biography|work=aph.gov.au|accessdate=15 October 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121127114603/http://parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au/piweb/TranslateWIPILink.aspx?Folder=BIOGS&amp;Criteria=NAME_ID:KA5;|archivedate=27 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preferences to [[Family First Party|Family First]] from the [[Australian Labor Party]] almost prevented her from being elected; however, she managed to reach a quota mostly as a result of the high level of below-the-line voting in Tasmania. The other Green elected at that election was [[Rachel Siewert]] from Western Australia. Milne was part of [[Frontbench of Bob Brown|Bob Brown's frontbench]] covering the portfolios of Arts, Climate change, Competition Policy &amp; Small Business, Finance &amp; Administration, Food Security, Regional Australia, Resources &amp; Energy, and Trade.

Milne was Vice-President of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN, also known as the [[World Conservation Union]]) from 2005 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20091013110605/http://www.npc.org.au/speakerArchive/chrismil.html Senator Christine Milne], ''National Press Club of Australia''&lt;/ref&gt; She became Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens on 10 November 2008.&lt;ref name="senatebio"/&gt;

In 2009, she debated the shortcomings of Australian Climate Change Regulatory Authority Bill 2009 in the federal parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/senate/dailys/ds301109.pdf Australian Senate Hansard Monday, 30 November 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124015936/http://aph.gov.au/hansard/senate/dailys/ds301109.pdf |date=24 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 April 2012, Milne became the leader of the Australian Greens after the resignation of Bob Brown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-04-13/bob-brown-resigns-as-greens-leader/3948496 As it happened: Bob Brown resigns as Greens leader] – Australian Broadcasting Corporation – Retrieved 13 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; She reorganised the [[Frontbench of Christine Milne|Green's front bench.]]

On 6 May 2015, Milne announced her immediate resignation from the leadership of the Australian Greens, and foreshadowed her departure from the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/Senator.Christine.Milne/posts/10152705390385916?fref=nf Christine Milne announces her resignation and leaves the Senate]  – Retrieved 6 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Milne resigned from the Senate on 10 August 2015.&lt;ref name=resigtweet&gt;{{cite web|last1=@AuSenate|title=Senator @ChristineMilne has resigned as a senator for Tasmania|url=https://twitter.com/AuSenate/status/630516450441080832|website=Twitter|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Diplôme d'Ingénieur''' ({{IPA-fr|diplom dɛ̃ʒenjœʁ|lang}}, often abbreviated as ''Dipl. Ing.'') is a postgraduate degree in engineering ''(see [[Engineer's degree|Engineer's Degrees in Europe]])'' awarded by the French [[Grandes Écoles]] in engineering. It is generally obtained after five to seven years of studies after the French [[Baccalauréat]].

Each holder of the diplôme d'ingénieur is also conferred the title of ''Ingénieur diplômé'' (graduate engineer). This is distinguished from the term '''ingénieur''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' (engineer) which is non-regulated and can be loosely used as a generic title based on one's professional position or nature of work rather than formal academic qualifications. 

Diplôme d'ingénieur graduates from reputable institutions often access the French job market with a significant advantage compared to PhDs. However, this is not always true for all industries, and roles that require high technical expertise (especially research in specific area) will favor a specialized master's or PhD qualification. 

==Accreditation==
The title ''Ingénieur diplômé'' is a strictly regulated and protected by the French state. Any institution issuing the diplôme d'ingénieur must be accredited by the [[Commission des titres d'ingénieur]] (within the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research) which is the official administrative body responsible for evaluating higher education institutions to train professional engineers in France. Anyone found to be misusing the title of ''Ingénieur diplômé'' is liable to a €15,000 fine and a one-year sentence in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070719&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000021342951&amp;dateTexte=20151002|title=Article 433-17 of the French Penal Code|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=French|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071191&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000006525290&amp;dateTexte=20151002|title=Article L642-12 of the French Educational Code|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=French|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the signing of the [[Bologna Process]] in 1999, the European [[Master's Degree]] is also conferred by the state to the holder of a diplôme d'ingénieur, but the converse is not true. This is because the diplôme d'ingénieur is recognised to include, but significantly surpass, a [[Bologna Process]] [[Master's Degree]]. 

The diplôme d'ingénieur is also recognized in the United States by the [[AACRAO]] since 2013 as "Master of Science in Engineering".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cti-commission.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mou_aacrao-cti.pdf Memorandum of Understanding (AACRAO - CTI)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grandes Écoles and Universities in France ==
France is particular in that only accredited [[Grandes écoles|Grandes Écoles]] in engineering are certified to issue the diplôme d'ingénieur, which is differentiated from bachelor's and master's degrees in engineering issued by public universities (Universités).

Universities in France are comprehensive institutions composed of several faculties covering various fields (natural sciences, engineering, law, economics, medicine, humanities, etc) with a large student body. By law, admission to a French university is non-competitive and open to anyone with a high school diploma. On the other hand, Grandes Écoles in engineering are much smaller in size and recruit their students with very selective processes (typically a few hundred students per year per institution, and a few thousand students per year country-wide), with the minimum qualification being 2 years of post-baccalureate studies in scientific [[Classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles|classes préparatoires]], three to four years University studies (Bachelors or Masters), or an otherwise equivalent training for foreign students, in order to be admitted to the engineer training in one of the Grandes Écoles.

==Curriculum==
The engineer training leading to the diplôme d'ingénieur may vary significantly among the Grandes Écoles in terms of curriculum structure, despite the same accreditation from CTI. In general, the most prestigious (therefore highly selective) Grandes Écoles tend to offer a multidisciplinary&lt;nowiki/&gt; curriculum for their flagship engineer program, exposing students to various fields of study with each courses taught at a graduate level. The multidisciplinary engineer program in the so-called 'generalist' Grandes Écoles is usually considered to be more competitive and intensive than specialized master's degree programs. However, this is not always the case, and there are a number of well-established Grandes Écoles that focus on a specialized curriculum for their engineer program.

Student engineers in Grandes Écoles are educated in close cooperation with the various industries through academic-industry partnerships, which introduce graduates to professional life while giving them a solid grounding in their discipline. As many graduates will advance to positions leading future projects and teams, courses related to management and professional training are also included in the curriculum.

In addition to the core curriculum in engineering and science, the French engineer training often includes, and is not limited to:
* courses in humanities and social sciences
* courses in business administration
* visits to production sites
* conferences and career talks by professionals
* internships and research projects

==Professional training==
More than 90 percent of the French engineer programs require at least one internship (typically in a business setting) at some point in the curriculum.

Most schools arrange three types of internships that train the students with progressive responsibilities, initially as observers and increasingly as actors, in order to gain a comprehensive understanding and perspective of all levels of responsibility and roles within the industry. One can distinguish “worker” (blue-collar) internships, “senior technician” internships, and “graduate” internships where the students perform the same type of work they will do as graduate engineers. Internships are graded and constitute part of the academic degree requirements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3513">'''Ed Mock''' (c.1938- April 25, 1986) was a [[San Francisco]]-based [[dancer]], [[teacher]], and [[choreographer]], whose style and teaching influenced future generations of dancers and artists.  Most active through the 70s and 80s, Mock founded and ran the West Coast Dance Company (1974-1979) and Ed Mock Dancers (1980-1985), as well as the Ed Mock Dance Studio.&lt;ref name="EstateProject" &gt;The Estate Project, http://www.artistswithaids.org/artforms/dance/catalogue/mock.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dancestudiolife.com/tag/ed-mock/&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in Chicago, Mock trained with dancers Jimmy Payne and Anna Nassif, and was later influenced by [[Lester Horton]], [[Katherine Dunham]], and a mix of [[jazz]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Zinko, Carolyne (Feb 6, 2008) Black History Month: Ed Mock. SF Gate: http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Black-History-Month-Ed-Mock-3229418.php&lt;/ref&gt;  He became known both as a solo performer and as a choreographer.  As a [[Solo dance|soloist]], Mock specialized in [[Dance improvisation|improvisation]], mixing [[modern dance]] with [[mime]], [[storytelling]], and voice.  

In 1986, Mock was elected to the [[Bay Area]] Dance Coalition Hall of Fame, and received the "Dance Teacher of the Year Award."&lt;ref name="EstateProject" /&gt;

On April 25, 1986, Mock died of an [[AIDS]]-related illness.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artistswithaids.org/artforms/dance/catalogue/mock.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013,  [[Amara Tabor-Smith]], a Bay-Area choreographer who studied and danced with Mock from the age of 14, created the multi-venue ''He Moved Swiftly But Gently Down the Not Too Crowded Street: Ed Mock and Other True Tales in a City That Once Was.'' The piece wandered through the city June 15 and June 21-23. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfbg.com/2013/06/12/his-footsteps&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_23318799/dance-card-ed-mock-feted-new-dance-work&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[Lynne Redding]] published a book of black and white photographs taken during 1980-1984 of Mock and his dance company in the studio, in rehearsal and in performance. Included in the book is an essay by [[Burr Snider]].

'''Eleventh grade''', '''junior year''', or '''grade 11''' (called '''[[Year 12]]''' in [[England]]) is the eleventh, and for some countries final, [[educational stage|grade]] of [[secondary school]]s. Students are typically 16–17 years of age, depending on the country and the students' birthdays.

==Australia==
In Australia, Year Eleven is typically the twelfth year of education and fifth (except South Australia, which it is the fourth) year of high school education. Although there are slight variations between the states, most students in Year Eleven are aged around fifteen, sixteen or seventeen. [[Queensland]] year-eleven students are the youngest in the country, as they usually enter at age fifteen.

In [[New South Wales]], Year Eleven is the shortest year as it only lasts three whole terms. Year Twelve begins its first term where Year Eleven would have its fourth.

Year Eleven is followed by [[Year Twelve]], the final year of high school.

==Bangladesh==
Grade eleven is the first year of college in [[Bangladesh]]. Students in this grade are sixteen to
seventeen years old and get the chance to study in this grade after passing the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) or equivalent exam. In Bangladesh this grade is also referred as 'Class 11' or 'Inter first year' or 'Intermediate first year' or 'HSC first year' etc.

==Belgium==
In [[Belgium]], the 11th grade is called "5ème secondaire" in the French speaking part of the country, and "5de middelbaar" in the Dutch speaking part.

== Brazil ==
In [[Brazil]], the 11th grade is called "Segundo Ano do Ensino Médio", which means 2nd year of medium school (not to be confused with middle school). Students tend to be 16 years old.

==Bulgaria==
In [[Bulgaria]], the 11th grade it's the penultimate year of the high-school ([[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]) stage. Students tend to be 17-18 years old.

==Canada==
In all provinces and territories, except Quebec, a student continues to [[Twelfth grade|Grade 12]] to complete their high school, or secondary, education. In [[Quebec]], Grade 11 (sec. 5) is the final year of [[secondary education]], followed by [[College education in Quebec|college]], a pre-university level unique to Quebec.

==Colombia==
The eleventh grade is the last year in secondary education. In this year, all students are required to do an [[intern]]ship in any subject field. To differentiate from Universities' internships, the practice is called 'alphabetisation'; most of the time is related to community services, such as teaching in schools, or assisting in hospitals or libraries. Students also do the [[ICFES]] National Test and they present to the draft for the [[National Army of Colombia|Colombian Army]]. By law, the army cannot recruit under-age students; most of eleventh-graders are aged 16-17, and the draft is almost changed for the payment of a monetary fee. This year is called the senior year.

==Finland==
In Finland there are three years of high school, which starts in 11th grade at the age of 16. 10th grade is usually skipped. 
 
==France==
The equivalent is the [[:fr:Première (lycée)|Première]], which is the penultimate year of [[Secondary education in France]] (followed by the [[:fr:Terminale (lycée)|Terminale]]).

==Hong Kong==
In Hong Kong, 11th grade is called Form 5.

==India==
In India, after appearing for the boards, the percentages determine the streams in which the student can study. 

There are three streams:
* Science, which comprises Physics, Chemistry, Biology, English, Computer Science/Informatics/Physical Education/Maths/Psychology/Home Science,
* Commerce, which comprises Accountancy, Marketing, English, Business Studies, Business Economics, Informatics /Maths/Physical Education, 
* Humanities/Arts which comprises English, Psychology, Fashion Studies/Home science, Informatics. 
The combination of streams can vary from Institutions.

But in abroad places, the streams are determined by the model exam, which is under the school. The stream which the students opt for are the basis of which degree they can study. Generally eleventh grade is known as +1 which originates from the term 10+1. This year is generally the continuation of grade 9 and grade 12 is the continuation of grade 10.
A student can also change his stream in the middle of the academic year from Science to other streams, but the reverse cannot be done. 
In Grade 11, students prepare for the entrance tests of various colleges and universities across the country.

==Ireland==
It is Fifth Year or Cúigú Bhliain of Secondary School (for 15- to 17-year-olds as there is an optional year beforehand). In this year, students prepare for the [[Irish Leaving Certificate|Leaving Certificate]].

==Italy==
In Italy, eleventh grade is called *Terza superiore* 
(3rd class of the Superior/High School, two years left).

==Malaysia==
In Malaysia, 11th grade also known as Form 5 in secondary school. The students at this stage are 17 years old, and it is the fifth and last year in the secondary school. (Compare to Form 6 or known as 12th grade).

==Mexico==
In some parts the eleventh grade is the second year of high school. Most students enter this grade as 16 year olds, but some might enter early as 15 and late as 17.

==Norway==
In [[Norway]], the eleventh year of education is the first year of ''Videregående skole'', equivalent to high school. It is very rarely referred to as the eleventh grade, but rather the first grade of ''Videregående'' or VG1. Although ''Videregående skole'' is not compulsory for Norwegians, approximately 93% of people aged 16-18 enroll. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ssb.no/utdanning/nokkeltall&lt;/ref&gt; There is no upper age limit for starting or finishing ''Videregående skole'', but students cannot enroll earlier than the year they turn 16.

==New Zealand==
In New Zealand, ''Year 12'' is the equivalent of eleventh grade, with students aged 16 or 17 during the years. It is the fourth year of secondary school and the twelfth year of compulsory education. During Year 12, most students complete Level 2 of the [[National Certificate of Educational Achievement]] (NCEA), the country's main national qualification for secondary school students. Students in Year 12 typically study English (or Te Reo Māori) and a minimum of five elective subjects with mathematics highly recommended.

==Pakistan==
Grade eleven is the first of two years in college (grade twelve being the last and final year before postgraduate and university education) and is equivalently referred to as "first year." Students in this year level are fifteen to sixteen years old. Students get to select from the following subjects:

Pre-medical (Biology, Physics, Chemistry)

Pre-engineering (Math, Physics, Chemistry)

Commerce

Humanities

Science

Home economics 

Arts

And the compulsory subjects are Urdu, Islamic studies(1st year only) and Pakistan studies (2nd year only). The students can select the preferred subject on the basis of SSC result (9th and 10th grade)

==Philippines==
In the [[Philippines]], Grade 11 is the first year of Senior High School. Topics discussed depend on the four tracks and their strands.

* Academic Track
**ABM (Accountancy, Business &amp; Management)
**STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Mathematics)
**HUMSS (Humanities &amp; Social Sciences)
**GAS (General Academic Strand)
**Pre-Baccalaureate Maritime
* Technical-Vocational Track
**Agro-Fishery Arts
**Home Economics
**Industrial Arts
**Information Communications Technology (ICT)
* Sports Track
* Arts and Design Track

Since school year 2016-2017. Students are usually 16–17 years old.

==Russia==
The eleventh grade is final year of [[secondary education]], the end of the high school, and it is an [[Unified State Exam|examinational]] year, when training to USE is being more powerful, than in [[tenth grade]]. Priority of education in this year is given to repeat the material learned in high school ([[Fifth grade|Fifth]] to [[Tenth grade|Tenth years]]) in [[Mathematics]], [[Russian language]] and in exam subjects by pupils' choice.

==Singapore==
In Singapore, 11th grade is equivalent of Secondary 5 level.

Only people taking N Levels (normal academic levels) will go to secondary 5, those in express streams will take their O levels (ordinary levels) in secondary 4, and then continue to a Junior College for 2 years or Polytechnic for 3 years.

==Spain==
The closest equivalent to the eleventh grade is the first year of Bachillerato. It is for pupils aged 16 to 17. It is a year of many changes when pupils can start to choose what they would like to study in the future at university.

==Sweden==
This is the second year of Upper Secondary School.

==United Kingdom==
===England and Wales===
{{main|Sixth form}}
[[Year 12]], or Lower Sixth form, is comparable to the 11th grade in the [[US]]. It is the sixth and penultimate year of secondary education. For students who entered [[secondary school]] before September 2008,{{citation needed|date=March 2009}} it is not compulsory to attend these last two years. During Year 12, three [[GCE Advanced Level|Advanced Subsidiary]] units are completed per subject (either written exams, [[coursework]] or a mixture, depending on subject). Often students choose four AS-Level subjects in Year 12 (some students may decide to take three or five).

Students then enter Year 13 (equivalent to 12th grade) and may choose to drop a subject,{{citation needed | date=August 2013}} going on to complete three subjects. Successful completion generally results in the award of [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-Level]] qualifications, though [[Business and Technology Education Council|BTEC]]s can be received.

===Scotland===
In Scotland, fifth year (of secondary education) or S5 is optional, where pupils will generally sit [[Higher (Scottish)|Higher]] qualifications which form the core entry requirements for university. It is followed by an optional final sixth year (also known as S6). The students ages normally range from 16-17 in this year.

===Northern Ireland===
The system is similar to the English one at this age. [[Sixth form|Lower Sixth Form]] (Year 13), pupils start on a two-year course, at the end of which they will hopefully have gained three 'A' Levels in their chosen subjects.

==United States==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
In the US, a student in the eleventh grade is typically referred to as a third year high school student or ''[[Junior (education)|junior]] ''. The vast majority of students who are classified as juniors take the [[SAT|SAT Reasoning Test]] and/or [[ACT (examination)|ACT]] in the second semester of their third year of high school. [[Math]] students usually take [[Algebra II]], but classes like [[Trigonometry]] or [[Precalculus]] are sometimes offered for students who wish to take [[Advanced Placement]] math classes in their fourth year aka senior year of high school. Depending on the location there may be a combination of any of the listed subjects. They may also take easier courses such as [[Algebra|Algebra I]] and [[Geometry]] if they do not have the required prerequisites for the more advanced courses that are listed above. Students who are advanced in mathematics often take [[Calculus]] or [[Statistics]]. 

In [[science]] classes, third year students are taught usually [[Biology]], [[Physics]] or [[Chemistry]] especially Lab Chemistry. [[Atom]]s, [[molecule]]s, and [[Stoichiometry]] is taught as well. Some school districts will have these certain subjects as a required science credit while others will begin to have the option of science electives.

In English class, a college-preparatory [[curriculum]] would also include American literature. Often, [[English literature]] (also referred to as British literature) is taught in the third year of high school. Books and authors learned include ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'', ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'', ''[[The Crucible]]'', ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'', ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'', [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]], [[Amy Tan]], and [[Lorraine Hansberry]].

In a [[social studies]] curriculum, third year students in the United States are usually taught [[History of the United States|US history]] or the world from the 1870s to the 21st Century. They may also acquire more advanced world culture and [[geography]] knowledge, along with some more-advanced social studies such as [[psychology]], [[economics]], [[sociology]] and [[government]].

Many high school third year students in the United States opt to take a [[foreign language]], even though it is not required in many secondary schools [[Curriculum|curricula]].

While normally followed by [[twelfth grade]], some colleges will accept excelling students out of this grade as part of an [[early college entrance program]]. Alternatively, some students may choose to graduate early through standardized testing or advanced credits.

'''Elizabeth Osborne Robinson Abbott''' (September 11, 1852 &amp;ndash; September 27, 1926) was an American educator considered to be a pioneer in introducing [[kindergarten]] to [[Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=swByA6qRq6AC&amp;pg=PA207 |title=The Selected Papers of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B.

The daughter of [[William Stevens Robinson]] and [[Harriet Hanson Robinson|Harriet Hanson]], she was born '''Elizabeth Osborne Robinson''' in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]. She taught at a district school in [[Maine]] and ran a small private school. She also worked at [[typesetting]] for a while but found that the pay for women in that field was not very good. She then began working as a cook in a charity kindergarten and nursery in [[Boston]]; she was allowed to take classes which eventually allowed her to teach kindergarten. She began teaching at a charity summer school in Boston and then taught in [[Waterbury, Connecticut]]. In 1885, she married George S. Abbott. She continued to teach and later operated a kindergarten out of her home. She served as secretary of the Connecticut Valley Kindergarten Association. Abbott also helped found the Old and New woman's club in [[Malden, Massachusetts]] and was the main founder for the Woman's Club of Waterbury.&lt;ref name=willard&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=zXEEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA2 |title=A Woman of the Century: Fourteen Hundred-seventy Biographical Sketches Accompanied by Portraits of Leading American Women in All Walks of Life |page=2 |last=Willard |first=Frances Elizabeth |author2=Livermore, Mary Ashton Rice |year=1893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbott and her husband later moved into her family's home in Malden. She was confined to a wheelchair for the last eleven years of her life and died in Malden at the age of 74.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=6rtgoVKMGDQC&amp;pg=PA210 |pages=210-11 |title="A Good Poor Man's Wife": Being a Chronicle of Harriet Hanson Robinson and Her Family in Nineteenth-century New England |last=Bushman |first=Claudia L |year=1998 |ISBN=0874518830}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been an influential supporter of the Danish choreographer [[August Bournonville]].&lt;ref&gt;Anne Middleboe Christensen, "Hvor danser den Kongelige Ballet Hen?", Det Schønbergske Forlag, 2002, {{ISBN|87-570-1627-5}}. Pages 70 and 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Andersen was trained at the Royal Danish Ballet from the age of seven. He also studied under [[Vera Volkova]], [[Stanley Williams (ballet)|Stanley Williams]] and [[Nora Kiss]]. He first danced with the company in 1971 and became a solo dancer in 1977. In 1976, supported by [[Dinna Bjørn]], he was the originator of the Bournonville Group which danced around the world presenting Bournonville's ballets. His first term as artistic director of the Royal Danish Ballet was from 1985–1994. From 1995–1999, he was the artistic director of the [[Royal Swedish Ballet]] and from 2002–2008 he was again artistic director of the Royal Danish Ballet. He has directed several productions of August Bournonville's ballets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.das-ny.org/moty2004_frankandersen.htm "Artistic Director Frank Andersen - Person of the Year 2004"], ''Danish American Society''. Retrieved 20 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997, he has been an advisor to the [[National Ballet of China]], visiting the People’s Republic on many occasions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ballet.co.uk/magazines/yr_02/jul02/interview_frank_andersen.htm Renee Renouf, "Interview with Frank Andersen"], ''Ballet Magazine'', July 2002. Retrieved 20 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; His dancing has been qualified as conveying love of life, humour and charm in roles such as Geert in ''[[The Kermesse in Bruges]]'', Gurn in ''La Sylphide'', Frants in ''[[Coppélia]]'', and Puck in [[John Neumeier]]'s ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' (1980).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Dans/Klassisk_og_modern-_Dansere_og_koreografer_i_Danmark/Frank_Andersen "Frank Andersen"], ''Den Store Danske''. {{Da icon}} Retrieved 20 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Andersen, together with his wife [[Eva Kloborg]], also a ballet dancer and choreographer, instructed a group of Vietnamese dancers from the Vietnam National Opera &amp; Ballet in Bournonville's ballet. This culminated in major presentations at the [[Hanoi Opera House]] on 29 and 30 May 2010 with performances of ''[[Le Conservatoire|Conservatory]]'' (1849) and ''Flower Festival in Genzano'' (1858).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambhanoi.um.dk/da/menu/OmOs/Nyheder/VietnamesiskeDansereFremfoerteKlassiskBournonvilleBallet.htm?wbc_purpose=basic&amp;WBCMODE=presentationunpublished&amp;printmode=True "Vietnamesiske dansere fremførte klassisk Bournonville ballet"], ''Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark''.

The act of swallowing live [[goldfish]] was an American school [[Fad|trend]] popularized in the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;http://americanhistory.si.edu/blog/2011/01/1939-the-year-of-goldfish-swallowing.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
Although it is not clear how the fad emerged, various people have made claims. A 1963 letter to the ''New York Times'' claimed that it was started by a man named Lothrop Withington Jr., who was a freshman at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] University and supposedly did so as part of a bid to become class president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/blog/2011/01/1939-the-year-of-goldfish-swallowing.html|title=1939: The year of goldfish gulping|website=National Museum of American History|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ripleys.com/weird-news/goldfish-swallowing/|title=College Bros in the 1930s Were the Champs of Goldfish Swallowing|date=2018-02-13|work=Ripley's Believe It or Not!|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stunt started a competition between multiple universities such as Penn State, MIT, and Harvard in an attempt to surpass one another.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/great-goldfish-swallowing-craze-1939-180954429/|title=The Great Goldfish Swallowing Craze of 1939 Never Really Ended|last=Clark|first=Laura|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Women also took part in the trend, as in April 1939 Marie Hensen from the University of Missouri was recorded{{By whom|date=May 2018}} as the first woman to swallow a goldfish.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Although once widely practiced, the stunt is rare today, but has made appearances in recent entertainment. In 2000, ''Jackass'' star Steve-O swallowed a live goldfish, only to vomit it moments later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/future-proof/2014/02/how-long-can-goldfish-survive-if-you-swallow-it|title=How long can a goldfish survive if you swallow it?|last=|first=|date=|website=NewStatesman|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possibility in the origins of goldfish swallowing comes from Chicago bartenders, most notably Matt Schulien (who performed magic while tending bar at his family's restaurant), who would cut up carrots to look like goldfish tails. When performing the stunt, bartenders would reach into a bowl of goldfish kept behind the bar while palming the carrot piece, placing that in between their pursed lips, using their tongues to lever it up and down to mimic the actions of a live fish, finally swallowing the carrot piece. The trick dates back to the 1920s, and some people believe that the fad could have been started by college students fooled by the trick.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

According to the National Museum of American History, goldfish swallowing was such a craze at universities during the early 20th century that it made appearances in several news publications, including the ''New York Times'' and the ''Washington Post''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/blog/2011/01/1939-the-year-of-goldfish-swallowing.html|title=1939: the year of goldfish swallowing|publisher=Smithsonian|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Legislation ==
The stunt became so popular that Massachusetts State Senator George Krapf filed a bill to "preserve the fish from cruel and wanton consumption."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard A. |last=Burgheim |url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1952/5/6/goldfish-swallowing-college-fad-started-here/?page=single |work=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |title=Goldfish Swallowing: College Fad Started Here, Spread Over World |date=6 May 1952 |access-date=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14829">'''Henry Charles Taylor''' (April 16, 1873 – April 28, 1969) was an American [[agricultural economics|agricultural economist]].  As an early pioneer in the field, he has been called the "father of agricultural economics" in the United States.&lt;ref name=ahs/&gt;  Taylor established the first university department dedicated to agricultural economics in the United States in 1909 during his time at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]].  He also had a brief but very influential career in the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] from 1919 to 1925, where he helped reorganize its offices and became head of the new [[Bureau of Agricultural Economics]].  Coming from a rural farm community himself, Taylor's foremost goal was always to try to improve the living conditions of farmers.

==Early life==
Taylor was born in [[Iowa]] on a farm near [[Stockport, Iowa|Stockport]].  Growing up, he witnessed his father, Tarpley Taylor, expand his farm from about {{convert|60|acre|m2}} to {{convert|600|acre|km2}} by buying small farms from early settlers.  From an early age he was able to see how proper land and economic management reinforced each other.  Additionally, Taylor had been impacted by the depressions of the late 19th century, especially that of the 1890s, and what devastating effects they had on farmers.  He entered [[Drake University]] to do two years of preparatory work, then went on to [[Iowa State College]], where he received his B.S. in agriculture in 1896, then his M.S. in agriculture in 1898.  He then joined the University of Wisconsin–Madison to earn his Ph.D.  Taylor's original intention upon going to Wisconsin was to take up a career as a statesman in order to represent farmers.  However he soon realized that his economics study offered more than he was expecting.&lt;ref name=ch&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Kenneth Parsons|Parsons, Kenneth H.]] | date =June 1991 | title = Henry Charles Taylor, 1873-1969: Organizer and first head of the USDA's BAE | journal = Choices: The Magazine of Food, Farm &amp; Resource Issues | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | page = 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Later in his career, he stated that "90 per cent of what could be done for the farmers was what they could do for themselves by adjusting production."&lt;ref name=uwp/&gt; Inspired by economics professor [[Richard T. Ely]], he left in 1899 to travel through Europe, briefly studying economics at the [[London School of Economics]] in Britain and at the [[University of Halle-Wittenberg]] and the [[University of Berlin]] in Germany.&lt;ref name=ahs&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jones, C. Clyde  |date=July 1958 | title = Henry C. Taylor: Father of Agricultural Economics (1873-) | journal = Agricultural History | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 196–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His doctoral dissertation was on "The Decline of Land Owners Farmers in England," which had him traveling by bicycle to visit more than a hundred farms.  Taylor returned to Wisconsin in 1901 to complete his degree in economics in 1902.&lt;ref name=uwp&gt;{{cite journal | author = Parsons, Kenneth H. |date=May 1970 | title = Henry Charles Taylor: A Personal Tribute by a Colleague | journal = Land Economics | volume = 46 | issue = 2 | pages = 191–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career at the University of Wisconsin–Madison===
He stayed on at the faculty of the University of Wisconsin until 1919.  Room was made for him in the Department of General Economics and the School of Commerce to teach economic geography and economic history.  However, as he later noted there was nothing in the budget to provide for his area of interest, agricultural economics.  Ely suggested that he simply teach the given courses and slowly develop work on agricultural economics.  Upon approaching the dean with the idea, he was told there would be no place for such courses for the next ten years.  Nevertheless, by the winter of 1902-03, Ely had arranged for fourteen lectures to be given to agricultural students on the economics of farm management.  The dean was impressed by the prepared syllabus and eventually Taylor set up an agricultural economics course for four-year students.  He devoted himself by 1903 to founding a Department of Agricultural Economics at the University for both research and teaching.  Taylor wrote the first agricultural economics textbook in the United States in 1905. He also adapted a dot map system with [[William Jasper Spillman|William J. Spillman]] to show historical shifts in agricultural production.&lt;ref name=uwp/&gt;

By 1909 he was successful in creating the new department, the first devoted to agricultural economics in the United States.&lt;ref name=uwp/&gt;  By this time he had also broadened the scope of the field to include [[rural sociology]].&lt;ref name=ahs/&gt;  In 1910 he authored the first Wisconsin Experiment Station bulletin on agricultural economics, on the ''Methods of Renting Farm Lands in Wisconsin''.&lt;ref name=bp/&gt;  Taylor also worked with the Wisconsin state government after being spurred on by [[Charles McCarthy (political scientist)|Charles McCarthy]], an advocate of cooperation between the government, farmers, and universities.  Wisconsin's new Department of Agriculture was asked to provide leadership in improving the marketing of dairy as the state was seeing a recent shift toward greater milk production.  Taylor used this as an opportunity to secure funding from the government to create a new faculty position for marketing.  For this, he invited his long-time friend and head of the Department of Economics at Iowa State College [[Benjamin Horace Hibbard]].  He joined the department in 1913 to become its second faculty member.&lt;ref name=ch/&gt;

Taylor was also a founding member of the Farm Management Association, which later became the [[Agricultural &amp; Applied Economics Association|American Farm Economic Association]].  He served as its president in 1920.&lt;ref name=ae&gt;{{cite journal | author = Unknown author |date=August 1969 | title = Henry C. Taylor | journal = American Journal of Agricultural Economics | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | pages = 732–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government career==
From 1909 to 1910 he assisted the Bureau of the Census to plan its schedule for the agricultural census, as well as for a special census of plantations.  Taylor chose to join the United States Department of Agriculture for the chance at giving a national role to agricultural economics, even though the new position meant a large reduction in salary.  He moved to [[Washington D.C.]] in 1919 to take charge of the USDA's Office of Farm Management and Farm Economics.  Not long after his arrival in Washington, the wartime prices of farm products collapsed, which proved disastrous for a great number of farmers.  In 1920, President Harding appointed [[Henry Cantwell Wallace|Henry C. Wallace]], who knew Taylor and was himself a great supporter of farmers, as the new Secretary of Agriculture.  Taylor soon became Chief of the Bureau of Markets and Crop Estimates, while also being part of a commission to reorganize the offices of the USDA.  For him this was a chance to consolidate the economics work of the department which had been scattered through many offices.  In 1922, Wallace appointed him chief of the new Bureau of Agricultural Economics, which subsumed the former Office of Farm Management and Bureau of Markets and Crop Estimates&lt;ref name=ahs/&gt; (today the [[Agricultural Research Service]] and [[Agricultural Marketing Service]]).  Among Taylor's tasks in the USDA were the expansion of agricultural information services, creating foreign outposts for the USDA to better collect information on world production and consumption, standardizing the grading of exported American crops, especially cotton, and inaugurating the Agricultural Outlook Service.&lt;ref name=bp&gt;{{cite journal | author = Penn, R. J. |date=December 1969 | title = Henry Charles Taylor, 1873-1969 | journal = American Journal of Agricultural Economics | volume = 51 | issue = 5 | pages = 999–1002 | doi = 10.1093/ajae/51.5.999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also brought many talented new people into the USDA.  Among them, two of his Ph.D. students he had already sent to work with Spillman, Oscar C. Stine and [[Oliver Edwin Baker]], and [[Lewis Cecil Gray]], who he persuaded to go with him to Washington.&lt;ref name=ch/&gt;

One of the major issues at the time was the controversy surrounding the first [[McNary–Haugen Farm Relief Bill]] in 1924 and other farmer subsidies proposals, however Taylor later stated his own involvement was only indirect.  The bill was not supported by the White House but had support from much of the Department of Agriculture.  Wallace died unexpectedly in late 1924, and Taylor had lost one of his greatest supporters.  President Coolidge appointed [[William Marion Jardine]] as the new Secretary of Agriculture in 1925.  Although he knew Taylor and they possibly were friends, Coolidge appointed Jardine on the condition that he get rid of Taylor.  Jardine asked him to step down and he would try to find him a government position of equivalent rank.  Taylor ignored the request and carried on his work, stating that he himself never actively supported the McNary-Haugen Bill or any other such program.  Taylor was dismissed from his post officially on August 15, 1925.&lt;ref name=ch/&gt;  Despite his short government career, he was still able to make major contributions to the Department of Agriculture, which had become one of the first great economic research organizations in the United States.&lt;ref name=ahs/&gt;&lt;ref name=uwp/&gt;  Disappointed by his termination, he went on to give speeches to farm groups, especially in Iowa, with the main message that Washington was more interested in providing cheap food to urban workers than the welfare of farmers.  Taylor wrote of his experience in government in 1926 in a 317-page manuscript called "A Farm Economist in Washington, 1919-1925."  Although intended to be released as a book to the public, it was never published.&lt;ref name=ch/&gt;

==Later life==
Taylor returned to his academic career, briefly rejoining Ely, then going to [[Northwestern University]] to work with the Institute for Research in Land Economics until 1928.  He then went to [[New England]] for three years to serve as Director of the Survey of Rural [[Vermont]].  Taylor then left the United States and traveled through Japan, China, Korea, and India as a member of the Commission of Appraisal of the Layman's Foreign Missions Inquiry for one year, in which he reviewed the work done by missionaries on rural problems.  He then went to Rome to serve as the United States member of the Permanent Committee of the International Institution of Agriculture between 1933 and 1935.&lt;ref name=ahs/&gt;&lt;ref name=ch/&gt;

He returned to the United States in 1935 on request from Illinois Governor [[Frank Lowden]] to serve as Managing Director of the recently created [[Farm Foundation]] in Chicago until 1945, where he focused on the broad problems of rural communities and worked to establish a relationship between researchers in the USDA and state agricultural colleges.&lt;ref name=bp/&gt;  He also worked closely with Oscar C. Stine on studying the history and development of agricultural economics.&lt;ref name=ch/&gt;  In 1936 he also served as president of the [[Agricultural History Society]], of which he was a life member.&lt;ref name=ae/&gt;  In 1945 he was transferred to Washington D.C. to serve as Agricultural Economist for the Farm Foundation.  This allowed him to devote himself to writing his book, ''The Story of Agricultural Economics'', with his wife Anne Dewees Taylor, and the foundation's sponsorship.  With its completion in 1952, Taylor began a study of land scarcity in highly industrialized nations like England, Germany, and Japan, and how their economies were adapting with the loss of their colonies.&lt;ref name=ahs/&gt;  He stayed active to the end of his life.  Taylor regularly attended the meetings of the International Conference of Agricultural Economists until he was 90, and also worked to complete a 100-year history of the original Taylor farm, Tarplewick, started by his parents in Iowa in 1861.&lt;ref name=uwp/&gt;

Even before his death he had become known as the "father of agricultural economics" in the United States.&lt;ref name=ahs/&gt;  However Taylor himself noted the pioneer work of five of his contemporaries in the field along with him: [[Andrew Boss]], [[William Jasper Spillman|William J. Spillman]], and [[George F. Warren]], from a background in [[agronomy]], and Benjamin H. Hibbard and  [[Thomas Nixon Carver]], who along with himself were students of Richard T. Ely in general economics.&lt;ref name=bp/&gt;  Taylor nonetheless embraced this role as a sort of elder statesman, and accepted many visitors to his home, including many young agricultural economists.  He found teaching to be the most rewarding part of his career.  Taylor was eventually hospitalized by bone cancer of the leg, a terminal illness, but even then continued to see visitors.&lt;ref name=ch/&gt;  He died in April 1969 at the [[Sibley Memorial Hospital]] in Washington.  He was survived by his daughter, Esther E. Taylor.&lt;ref name=ae/&gt;

The '''Arthur O. Eve Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP)''' is a partnership between the State of New York and its independent colleges which provides economically and educationally disadvantaged residents the possibility of a college education. The primary objective of HEOP is to help provide a broad range of services to the student, who because of academic and economic circumstances, would otherwise be unable to attend college, yet has the potential and desire to obtain a college degree. HEOP is sponsored jointly by the State Education Department and the College. HEOP is funded jointly by participating colleges and the New York State Arthur O. Eve Higher Education Opportunity Program and programming activities are supported, in part, by a grant from the New York State Education Department.

All HEOP Scholars must be New York State residents and must meet both financial and academic guidelines. &lt;ref name="HEOP Report"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Higher Education Opportunity Program|title=Higher Education Opportunity Program Final Report Part I|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HEOP program was funded under Title V of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and was approved by Governor Rockefeller of New York.&lt;ref name="HEOP Report" /&gt; This program is successful due to HEOP providing grants to institutions of higher learning.&lt;ref name="HEOP Report" /&gt; The program has initially awarded over fifty colleges grants ranging from $40,000-$61,000 to appropriately fund students admitted through HEOP. &lt;ref name="HEOP Report" /&gt; 

When the HEOP program was founded in 1969, there were approximately twenty-five institutions that offered the program. Now, forty-three years later, the program has expanded to fifty-seven&lt;ref name="HEOP Work"&gt;{{cite web|last=State Education Department|title=HEOP 2012-2013 Program Brochure|url=http://www.highered.nysed.gov/kiap/colldev/HEOP/documents/HEOPWebBrochure2012-13.pdf|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  independent colleges and universities throughout New York State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=New York State Education Department|title=Higher Education Opportunity Program|url=http://www.highered.nysed.gov/kiap/colldev/HEOP/|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In order to be eligible for the Higher Education Opportunity Program, a student must be a New York State resident for 1 year before starting HEOP at his/her admitted college, have a high school or equivalent state approved diploma (such as the Armed Forces), be academically disadvantaged meaning that he/she would not be able to be accepted according to regular admission standards, be financially disadvantaged (based on specific income cutoffs, varying by college) and have ambition to succeed.&lt;ref name="HEOP Work" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1546">'''ITnet''' ('''Institute of Technology Network''') is an [[Packet over SONET|PoS]] based multi Mbit/s [[computer network|network]] created for the [[Regional Technical College|Institutes of Technology]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. ITnet uses a 45 Mbit/s link to each of the institutions and an international link of 310 Mbit/s via [[HEAnet]].

The system was proposed in 1991 between [[Regional Technical College, Cork]] and [[Regional Technical College, Carlow]], as they were then called. In 1993 an agreement was reached to create '''RTCnet'''. The system was running by 1994 with its [[network hub|hub]] in [[University College, Dublin]] and service management at Carlow. All Regional Technical Colleges were connected to the system.

In 1998 RTCnet became ITnet to reflect the change in status of the Regional Technical College system to Institutes of Technology. The hub of the system and service management moved to [[Institute of Technology, Tallaght]] where an international link was provided via [[HEAnet]].

ITnet was incorporated into [[HEAnet]] during 2007 and 2008 and has now ceased to exist as an independent network for the IoTs. All internet services are now provided directly to the Institutes by [[HEAnet]].

He performed breeding experiments with [[horse]]s and [[zebra]]s which disproved earlier theories of heredity.

==Life==
Ewart was born in [[Penicuik]], [[Midlothian]], [[Scotland]], the son of John Ewart, a joiner, and his wife, Jean Cossar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=EWART, James Cossar|journal=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page= 570|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA570}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied medicine from 1871 to 1874 at the [[University of Edinburgh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = a. | first1 = J.

Cossar Ewart, F.R.S | doi = 10.1038/133165a0 | journal = Nature | volume = 133 | issue = 3353 | pages = 165–166| year = 1934 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he graduated MB ChB. After graduation, he became an anatomy demonstrator under [[William Turner (University Principal)|William Turner]] and then held the position of Curator of the Zoological Museum at [[University College, London]], where he assisted [[Ray Lankester|E Ray Lankester]] (later director of the Natural History Museum) by making zoological preparations for the museum and providing teaching support for Lankester's course in practical zoology&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.  In 1878 he returned to Scotland to take a post of Professor of Natural History at [[Aberdeen University]] from where he moved to [[Edinburgh University]] in 1882, staying in the post until 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Aberdeen he encountered [[James Duncan Matthews]], a mature student (older than himself) and they became friends until Matthew's premature death in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-royal-society-of-edinburgh/article/div-classtitlejames-duncan-matthewsdiv/5232F9CC63F0089F4CD601DD3DBC1F2B&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[William Turner (anatomist)|Sir William Turner]], William Rutherford, [[William Rutherford Sanders]] and [[John Chiene]]. He won the Society's Neill Prize for 1895-98  and served as their Vice-President 1907 to 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in June, 1893, having jointly delivered their [[Croonian Lecture]] in 1881.

Among various other studies, he performed breeding experiments with [[horse]]s and [[zebra]]s. He carried out these experiments at “The Bungalow”, now the Navaar House in Penicuik, well before the rediscovery of [[Gregor Mendel]]'s works. Ewart crossed a male zebra with a female [[pony]] to show that the theory of [[Telegony (pregnancy)|telegony]] inherited from the Greeks was unsound. Telegony held that a female with a history of mating with multiple males would pass on genetic qualities of all previous partners to her offspring. Ewart later bred the mare which had produced zebra-horse hybrids with a pony, and the offspring showed no zebra qualities in either markings or temperament. Ewart's goal was also to produce a draught animal for South African conditions, resistant to African diseases and more tractable than a mule.

In 1883 he commissioned [[George Washington Browne]] to design a grand new house in [[Penicuik]], finished in 1885, which is where he died on New Year's Eve 1933/34. It is now the Craigiebield House Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin McWilliam|McWilliam, Colin]]. ''Buildings of Scotland: Midlothian'', p. 384&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

He married three times, his first wife being the sister of [[Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer]].

'''Kosciuszko Foundation''' is a [[Foundation (charity)|charitable foundation]] based in [[New York City]]. It was created by [[Stephen Mizwa]] to fund programs that promote [[Poland|Polish]]-American intellectual and artistic exchange.

== History ==
The Polish American Scholarship Committee was established in 1923 by Dr. [[Stephen Mizwa]] to bring students to universities in the United States. Mizwa worked with the president of [[Vassar College]], Henry Noble MacCracken, who had visited Poland. The two expanded the Scholarship Committee's mission to promote cultural and educational exchanges between the United States and Poland. In December 1925, the Scholarship Committee changed into the new Kosciuszko Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc-architecture.com/UES/UES037.htm New York Architecture Images], Retrieved on December 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation is named in honor of [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]], a Polish general and patriot, who after unsuccessful battles in uprising for Polish freedom migrated to [[North America]] and fought in [[American Revolutionary War]]. The organization was founded in 1925, on the eve of the 150th anniversary of Kosciuszko's enlistment in the American liberation cause.

The headquarters are in a limestone neo-Renaissance three-story mansion built in 1917. The building was designed by Harry Allan Jacobs for James J. Van Alen, whose in-laws, the [[Astor family|Astors]], lived down the block.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3DE1238F931A25754C0A964958260 "Postings: Kosciuszko Foundation House; An Inside Job" The New York Times, Published: July 12, 1992] Retrieved on December 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The second-story ballroom functions as a gallery, as well as a lecture and concert hall for chamber-music and solo recitals.

==Activities==
The foundation provides scholarships and fellowships to Polish students, scholars, and artists who were invited for a research or educational stay by an institution of higher education in the United States. Several programs are also targeted at Polish musicians. Grants for U.S. citizens include research and study opportunities in Poland.

The foundation organizes cultural events for the Polish community. It is the largest public institution in North America dedicated solely to Polish art. Exhibitions are held that draw from the permanent collection of oils, watercolors, prints, drawings, ceramics, sculpture, tapestries and photographs. An annual Chopin Piano Competition showcases young talent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc-arts.org/oDetail.aspx?OrgID=1211&amp;v=true NYC Arts, Culture Guide and Calendar]  Retrieved on December 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation sponsors and publishes the biggest Polish-American and American-Polish dictionary, known as ''Kosciuszko Foundation Dictionary'' and published in a book and CD-ROM format. The recent version, titled ''New Kosciuszko Foundation Dictionary'' was issued in 2003. Its editor-in-chief was a renowned Polish professor of English language.

==Washington, D.C.==
The foundation's Washington office provides a venue for local Polish-American events through a wide range of activities, including films, concerts, exhibitions, educational programs, publications, and seminars; and uses its website to provide information on activities, collections and topics of interest to those who  interested in Poland.

==Chapters==
Kosciuszko Foundation has regional chapters in:
* [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] (Western New York State)
* [[Chicago]], Illinois
* [[Denver]], Colorado (Rocky Mountain)
* [[Houston]] (Texas)
* [[Ohio]]
* [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania
* [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania

The '''Learning Grid''' was a UK charity that promoted hands-on activities related to science and engineering for school pupils and students in the [[United Kingdom]]. The name '''Learning Grid''' was also used to refer collectively to the activities themselves.

==History==
Motorsport Development UK (MDUK) was established in November 2003 with funding from four regional development agencies ([[East Midlands Development Agency]], [[Advantage West Midlands]], [[South East England Development Agency]], and [[East of England Development Agency]]), and from the DTI, with about £11.5m each year. Martin Fellows was head of MDUK. MDUK was a six-year programme, and came to a close in March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-mia.com/assets/Motorsport_Development_UK_Final_Report.pdf MIA]&lt;/ref&gt; MDUK was headquartered at [[Silverstone]].

The Learning Grid began in 2005 as a recommendation of the Motorsport Competitiveness Panel, a body set up by the UK [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] whose final report was announced by the then Secretary of State [[Patricia Hewitt]] on 11 July 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090311183614/http://www.autoindustry.co.uk/press_releases/11-07-03_1 DTI announcement]&lt;/ref&gt; The name 'Learning Grid' was thought to refer to a motorsport starting grid, since many of the activities had a motorsport theme, although another derivation could be the representation of activities on a map or grid showing the age group on the X axis and level of time commitment required on the Y axis.

It was officially launched at [[Goodwood Circuit|Goodwood]] in October 2005, with an event hosted by [[Greenpower]], with Bob Gilbert and a speech given by [[Charles Gordon-Lennox, Earl of March and Kinrara]].

==Structure==
A Motorsport Academy was also established in 2006. Another programme of MDUK was Energy Efficient Motorsport. Learning Grid was headquartered at [[Savoy Place]], home of the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology (professional society)|IET]], in the [[City of Westminster]].

On 2 February 2007, it became a not-for-profit limited company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmdius/50/50we62.htm Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills Committee March 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707185303/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmdius/50/50we62.htm |date=2015-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2009, the registered office was moved from Savoy Place to [[Bromyard]] in [[Herefordshire]]. One of the directors of the company was [[Roger Putnam (British businessman)|Roger Putnam]]. This company was dissolved on 24 May 2011.

==Activities==
22 separate activities achieved the Learning Grid quality standard, including [[Formula Student]], [[F1 in Schools]], [[Primary Engineer]], Greenpower, STEM days and residential courses run by the [[Smallpeice Trust]], the Shell [[Eco-marathon]], [[F1 in Schools]], the [[Engineering Education Scheme]] and [[The Year in Industry]]. Accreditation was valid for 3 years, with an annual review.

==Quality==
The Learning Grid created its Learning Grid Quality Standard for engineering and science activities. Accredited programmes featured in a Guide published each autumn which was available to assist teachers in choosing suitable programmes for their pupils. The Learning Grid also ran an annual showcase event at [[Rockingham Motor Speedway]] near [[Corby]] in [[Northamptonshire]].

This page is a '''list of staff at South Park Elementary''' from the characters in the American animated television series '''''[[South Park]]'''''.

==Mr. Adler==
'''Mr. Richard Adler''' is the puffy cheeked, shop-class teacher at South Park Elementary. During "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]", he is plagued by memories of his fiancée's death and chews copious amounts of nicotine gum to deal with them. When he runs out of gum, he plans to commit suicide. After writing his suicide note, he lies on a large table saw with a moving feed, but is interrupted by a fight between Tweek and Craig entering his classroom, killing Kenny in the process. Afterwards, he communicates with his fiancée's spirit through Kenny's corpse, and she helps him move on from his mourning. Now it seems he has relaxed a bit and put his past behind him, and has not featured prominently in an episode since "Tweek vs. Craig", although he has appeared in the background of many scenes and was one of the teachers supporting the move to teach sex education to the younger students in "[[Proper Condom Use]]", and also spoke his views on 9/11 in "[[Mystery of the Urinal Deuce]]". He was featured in the episode, "[[Bass to Mouth]]", and has a few lines. He also commented on the country's inevitable doom in "[[About Last Night... (South Park)|About Last Night]]". His teaching method consists primarily of telling the children to "quit screwing around", and "don't screw around, you screw around too much!" The episode "[[Mysterion Rises]]" reveals Adler to be a member of the Cult of Cthulhu. Adler always has a visible bandage covering a scar on his forehead after his suicide attempt. Mr. Adler's character was based on an old shop teacher who taught co-creator [[Matt Stone]]. His name was referenced in DVD commentary, but was censored because the real teacher did not give South Park permission to reveal his name.

==Chef==
{{Main|Chef (South Park)}}
'''Jerome "Chef" McElroy''' (voiced by [[Isaac Hayes]]) was one of few African American characters in ''South Park'', and the chef at the South Park Elementary School. In the initial season, his gimmick line, as the four boys come into the cafeteria was, "Hello there, children!" They would respond with, "Hey, Chef." This was usually followed by Chef asking "How's it going?" and the boys would reply "Bad." A stereotypical character, Chef is obsessed with sex (especially with white women). In "[[Chef Aid]]", it is revealed that he committed bestiality with a goat. He is a talented singer, and has a tendency to sing wildly inappropriate songs when his muse strikes him. The children often seek him out when in need of guidance or information. Sometimes the advice given by Chef is inappropriate, such as in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut]]'', Stan asks Chef how he can get Wendy to like him and he replies, "That's easy. You just gotta find the [[clitoris]]." He refers to the boys as 'children' even if there is only one of them present. He once almost married a [[succubus]], but the boys saved him. He has not been seen since "[[Return of Chef]]" because of the departure of Hayes. In this episode, he is "killed", but is then seen being remade with a body similar to that of [[Darth Vader]]

==Ms. Choksondik==
'''Ms. Diane Choksondik''' becomes the boys' new teacher after they enter fourth grade and is voiced by Trey Parker. Ms. Choksondik has extremely exaggerated saggy [[breasts]], is overweight, wears glasses, and has a [[Amblyopia|lazy eye]]. She also does not wear a bra, and when she lifts her arms, the bottom few inches of her breasts show below the bottom of her blouse. One of the early jokes about Ms. Choksondik is that the children do not get the obvious pun in her name, and try to create other names for her (such as "makesmesick", "chokesonbricks" and "chokesonrocks"). She corrects them in full seriousness. In the episode "[[Proper Condom Use]]", it is strongly implied that her contemptuous attitude towards [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] stems from the fact that no man before [[Mr. Mackey]] had any sexual interest in her.

The episode "[[Professor Chaos (South Park episode)|Professor Chaos]]" ends on a [[cliffhanger]] saying someone would die, in a parody of cliffhanger endings, and it was revealed during this gag that Ms. Choksondik has died. In the episode "[[Simpsons Already Did It]]", the boys reveal they put some of their [[Sea-Monkeys|Sea People]] in her coffee. When she dies soon after, they became horrified when they thought that their prank had killed her. Later, the news says that large amounts of [[semen]] (or, as the boys took it, "sea men") had been found in her stomach, and they go to great lengths to hide their apparent role in her death, until Chef explains that Ms. Choksondik must have died from something else. After her death, the boys receive two weeks off school to "deal with" her death, and then are taught for a short time by Mr. Mackey before [[Mr. Garrison]] is allowed a return to teach them.

==Ms. Claridge==
'''Ms. Claridge''' is a South Park Elementary preschool teacher. Her first appearance was in "[[Pre-School (South Park)|Pre-School]]". Ms. Claridge was disabled and covered in burns after a fire broke out in the pre-school classroom at South Park Elementary. The fire was started when Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny wanted to play "fireman" and asked the "baddest kid in pre-school", Trent Boyett, to start a fire for them. In spite of the boys' efforts to extinguish the fire (by urinating on it), the fire grew out of control and nearly killed Ms. Claridge. Ms. Claridge survived, but was badly injured and placed in an electric [[wheelchair]] which very much resembles that of [[Christopher Pike (Star Trek)|Captain Christopher Pike]] in the original ''[[Star Trek]]'' episode "[[The Menagerie (Star Trek)|The Menagerie]]".

Ms. Claridge communicates by 'beeping' once for yes and twice for no. It is not clear how she can function as a teacher if she can only communicate "yes" and "no", yet her students appear to understand her.

The boys denied all culpability for the fire and Trent Boyett was sent to Juvenile Hall for five years. While trying to escape the newly released Trent, Cartman fires a taser gun, which accidentally powers Ms. Claridge's wheelchair, sending her crashing into a propane shop, exploding and setting her alight once again. The police arrive and ask if Trent started the fire. She replies "no" with two beeps but the police mistake it for "yes yes" and arrest Trent.

Ms. Claridge appears briefly in two other episodes, "[[The Death of Eric Cartman]]", where Cartman, in his efforts to atone for his life's misdeeds, gives her a fruit basket, and also again at the talent show in "[[Erection Day]]".

==Mr. Connors==
'''Mr. Connors''' (Trey Parker) was the wrestling teacher at the school. He appeared in "[[W.T.F. (South Park)|W.T.F.]]", where he is fired due to some of the wrestling videos on his iPhone being mistaken for gay pornography, and eventually joined the [[WWE]].

==Ms. Crabtree==
'''Ms. Veronica Lee Crabtree''', known in the series as '''Mrs. Crabtree''', was voiced by [[Mary Kay Bergman]] in seasons 1–3 and [[Eliza Schneider]] in seasons 4–8, when she was officially "killed off" in "[[Cartman's Incredible Gift]]". She was the bus driver for South Park elementary, and enforced incredibly strict discipline on the bus, constantly yelling at the students to enforce quiet. She does the same to adult staff travelling on the bus, and doesn't seem to understand that she can't report the staff for disorderly conduct like she would with the students. The students often mutter various insults to her, then quickly cover them up with poor excuses when she demanded they repeat themselves. However, [[Stan Marsh]] once repeated the insult back word for word. As a result, Ms. Crabtree said "oh" and drove off without letting the boys getting on the bus.

In one episode, a kid from the drug rehabilitation center (across from Cartman's [[fat camp]]) is forced to climb into Ms. Crabtree's body [[vagina]]lly while pretending to be Kenny (who was arrested for prostitution), but was rebirthed [[stillbirth|stillborn]]. Moments later, she squeezed out another kid, who resembled [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]].

In the episode "[[Chef Aid]]", Chef resorts to [[prostitution]] to get needed money, and Ms. Crabtree, over whose head he puts a bag first, is one of his "customers".

The character's biggest role was in the season 2 episode "[[City on the Edge of Forever (South Park)|City on the Edge of Forever]]", where she has the main role in the episode's b-plot. After the bus becomes stranded at the edge of a cliff, Ms Crabtree leaves the children behind to try to find assistance, but ends up getting sidetracked by a stand up comedian agent who draws her into a career in stand-up. She eventually starts a romantic relationship with a truck driver she met while hitchhiking, and the two spends the last few minutes of the show watching the sunset together.

Ms. Crabtree&amp;nbsp;– as well as the bird nesting on her head&amp;nbsp;– was murdered by a serial killer in the 2004 episode "Cartman's Incredible Gift". Detectives investigating the crime in the episodes noted she was "an [[wikt:ancillary|ancillary]] character the fans wouldn't miss much". The school janitor Mr. Venezuela is currently the new school bus driver.

==Mr. Derp==
'''Mr. Derp''' is most prominent as Chef's substitute in "[[The Succubus (South Park)|The Succubus]]". Voiced by Trey Parker, the character commonly displays slapstick and physical camp humor, much to the chagrin of the boys. He tends to hit himself in the head with a [[claw hammer]] in attempts to make the boys laugh. In the season three commentary, Matt and Trey reveal that his namesake, "Derp", is the sound commonly made in a klutzy situation when things go horribly wrong, literally and comically, like a joke that can be "seen from a mile away". The word ''derp'' has become a popular phrase and [[Internet meme]].

He has also since appeared in the background in "[[Eek! A Penis!]]", possibly indicating that he has since replaced Chef. He also appeared before Chef's death briefly in "[[Professor Chaos (South Park episode)|Professor Chaos]]" and "[[Timmy 2000]]" (as the lemonade stand clerk at [[Lollapalooza|Lalapalalapaza]]).

==Ms. Ellen==
'''Ms. Ellen''' (appeared only in "[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]" and voiced by a celebrity guest star, [[Natasha Henstridge]]) substituted for Mr. Garrison in South Park Elementary as a third-grade teacher when he was away for a few days undergoing a plastic surgery on his nose. She was promoted to a permanent teaching position after Mr. Garrison, enjoying his new '[[David Hasselhoff]]' look, quit to do what he "always wanted to do: hang out and screw hot chicks." Chef went out on a date with Ms. Ellen and only to find out that she is a [[lesbian]]. When the boys found out that she was a lesbian, they tried every effort to become one themselves. Ms. Ellen's attractive looks and kind nature caused the boys in the class to develop deep amorous feelings towards her, which also caused Wendy to become very jealous (oblivious to the fact that Ms. Ellen does not reciprocate their interest). Wendy frames her in a way that causes Iraqi soldiers to send her on a rocket into the sun.

==Mr. Garrett==
'''Mr. Garrett''' is the coach of the South Park Elementary basketball team. He appears very briefly in the episode 'Elementary School Musical.'

==Mr. Garrison==
{{Main|Mr. Garrison}}
'''Mr. Garrison''' has been the children's teacher throughout most of the series. In the beginning, Garrison was in denial of his homosexuality to the point of [[homophobia]], and was always seen with either of his hand puppets that he claimed were gay. Later he went missing, hiding on a mountain, living in isolation. He eventually "came out of the closet" and returned with the intention to teach again. In "[[4th Grade (South Park)|4th Grade]]", he was denied the job by [[#Principal Victoria|Principal Victoria]], who said, "Oh, we don't hire gay people." He was eventually allowed back as the Kindergarten teacher. In "[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]", a change in laws allow Garrison to be promoted to teach the 4th grade, receiving his old 3rd grade students who have now advanced a grade. In the season 9 episode "[[Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina]]", Garrison got a sex reassignment operation, after which he came to be known as '''Janet Garrison'''. In the season 11 episode "[[D-Yikes!]]", Garrison becomes a [[lesbian]]. Finally, in the season 12 episode "[[Eek, a Penis!]]", he gets reassigned back to being male again.

==Nurse Gollum==
'''Nurse Mary Gollum''' (called '''Nurse McSchwartz''' in the [[Television pilot|original pilot]] of "[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]") is the school nurse at South Park Elementary, notable primarily for the fact that she has a dead [[fetus]] attached to the side of her head, which terrifies the children (she lacks this in the original pilot). Nurse Gollum is described in her first appearance on the show as suffering from the (fictional) condition "conjoined twin myslexia". [[Principal Victoria]] asked her if she could have it removed, Nurse Gollum stated yes but that it would cost her life.

In Nurse Gollum's first appearance, "[[Conjoined Fetus Lady]]", [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] is sent to see her and shocked at her appearance. The rest of the children are soon terrified, leading to Sheila and [[Mayor McDaniels]] to arrange a special week for Conjoined Twin Myslexia awareness. However, this leads to Nurse Gollum becoming angered, saying that she just wants to live her life normally (especially since she's the only person in the city to suffer of this condition). She made an additional appearance in "[[Roger Ebert Should Lay Off the Fatty Foods]]" playing the role of [[Christine Chapel|Nurse Chapel]] in a recreation of the Star Trek episode "[[Dagger of the Mind]]".

Despite having a dead fetus on her head, she is one of the most normal and intelligent adult characters on the show.  Despite not wanting to be singled out for being different, she appeared in the episode "[[Freak Strike]]" where she is one of the freaks in the [[infomercial]] that is promoting awareness of 'freaks' through [[daytime TV|daytime]] [[talk show]]s.

Nurse Gollum's last appearance on the show was in Season 9 episode "[[Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow]]" in a very minor cameo, but in the "[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]" video game, there are posters scattered around South Park, revealing Nurse Gollum's first name as Mary, and declaring that she has [[missing person|been missing]] since "October 19th", which is a reference to her appearance in the aforementioned episode, which first aired on October 19, 2005.

Nurse Gollum is named after [[Gollum]], the deformed creature from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

==The Groundskeeper==
'''The Groundskeeper''' appears very briefly in the episodes "[[Damien (South Park)|Damien]]" and "[[Butters' Bottom Bitch]]". She appears to be in charge of watching the students during recess. She is of old age and possesses an unpleasant demeanor, exclaiming to the students "five minutes until recess is over, you little bastards!"

==Mr. Mackey==
'''[[Mr. Mackey]]''', voiced by [[Trey Parker]], is the school [[school counselor|guidance counselor]]. He has a disproportionately large head and mumbles "M'kay" into most sentences.  He speaks with a [[Southern American English|Southern accent]], and he is believed to be from [[Louisiana]]. It is assumed he is at least 40 years old (he once said he had sex at 19 and that it has been about 21 years since). He is based on Trey Parker's junior high school counselor, Stan Lackey. He has occasionally taught classes at the school, and taught sex education with [[Ms. Choksondik]]. During this time he had a sexual relationship with Ms. Choksondik until her death. After her death, he took over the fourth grade class until [[Mr. Garrison]] returned. In the episode "[[Erection Day]]" he is shown to be left-handed.

Despite his slightly odd appearance and catchphrase (M'kay), Mr. Mackey is generally portrayed as an able and responsible counselor who actually cares about the children, much unlike Mr. Garrison and other adult authority figures. He sometimes appears with Principal Victoria when punishing a student or announcing an important message. His methods as a counselor often reflect real-life controversies in education. For example, when Kyle talks about seeing [[Mr. Hankey|Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo]], he places Kyle on a heavy dose prescription of [[Prozac]]. In an early episode, the children feign having [[Attention Deficit Disorder]], and he prescribes them all [[Ritalin]]. During a drug-education class in the episode "[[Ike's Wee Wee]]", he passes some marijuana around the classroom, and it is stolen (apparently by one of the children, though it is later revealed that the actual thief was Mr. Garrison). For this, Mr. Mackey is fired by the school, evicted by his landlord, and, feeling depressed, he ends up using alcohol, marijuana and LSD. The episode suggests that his large head is caused by the tightness of his tie around his neck, but in "[[Child Abduction Is Not Funny]]", his parents are shown to have large heads as well. He becomes a hippie and travels to India with a like-minded woman. Mr. Mackey is captured by [[The A-Team]], and his former employers, along with [[Jimbo Kern|Jimbo]], say that they should have helped him with his drug problem rather than firing him. Mr. Mackey protests, saying that he likes his new life and that he actually has not done drugs since his first experimentations back in South Park. Nobody listens and in rehab at the [[Betty Ford Center|Betty Ford Clinic]], he is "cured" of his addiction to drugs. Mr. Mackey's social worker then re-ties his tie, which makes his head swell back to its original size.

In the episode "[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]" he is shown to have a bondage sex scene with [[Liane Cartman]]. In "[[Cat Orgy]]", he's shown to have presumably had sex with her again. In "[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]", it is revealed that he can speak [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]] fluently. In "[[Trapped in the Closet (South Park)|Trapped in the Closet]]", Mr. Mackey is seen at the [[Church of Scientology]] Org where Stan is having an auditing session. However, it is not known whether or not he continues having sessions with the Org from that point on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spscriptorium.com/Season9/E912script.htm |title=South Park Scriptorium - "Trapped in the Closet" |publisher=Spscriptorium.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-07 }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=SheriffIsInTown |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; From "[[Major Boobage]]" onward, Mackey's sweater and jeans were re-designed, much like [[Mr. Garrison]]'s two episodes later in "[[Eek, a Penis!]]". In "[[Insheeption]]" he is revealed to be a hoarder with a troubled childhood, having been bullied and later being molested by [[Woodsy the Owl]].

In the Season 1 DVD, Parker stated that Mr. Mackey was based on his school counselor, who, when he saw Parker in the halls during class, would simply say, "Okay, Trey, get back to class now, mmm-kay?"

==Mr. Meryl==
'''Mr. Meryl''' is the Audio/Visual Department Teacher and appeared in "[[Quest for Ratings]]". He tells [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], [[Jimmy Valmer|Jimmy]] and [[Token Black|Token]] that their show "Super Action News" is losing in the ratings to [[Craig Tucker|Craig]]'s [[home video]] show, "Animals Close-Up With a [[Wide-angle lens|Wide-Angle Lens]]" and subsequently gives them all a failing grade. This inspires the boys to come up with new ideas to revamp their show.

==Ms. Pearl==
'''Ms. Pearl''' is the Home Economics teacher. She speaks with a soft, gentle voice and does her job well, although she appears to believe in old-fashioned gender roles, namely by having all the girls on her course, despite a couple having applied for [[wood shop]] class, and by teaching her class ways to find, manipulate and marry rich men. She is good with chat up lines (as seen in "[[Tweek vs. Craig]]"). She also dates Richard Adler, and mentioned she wanted to sleep with him. He refused because he was still mourning the death of his fiancée.

==PC Principal==
'''PC Principal''', his real name as revealed in “Super Hard PCness”, is the current principal of South Park Elementary, replacing Principal Victoria in the show's [[South Park (season 19)|nineteenth season]]. He graduated from [[Texas A&amp;M University]] and is very emphatic on [[political correctness]] issues. The character was first introduced in "[[Stunning and Brave]]". He is a muscular man with dark blonde hair, a very faint mustache, and a goatee. He is often shown wearing [[Oakley, Inc.|Oakley]] sunglasses. He is very aggressive and violent in enforcing compliance to his ideas of acceptable behavior, for instance in the episode "Stunning and Brave" he responds to Cartman's use of politically incorrect language by beating him so severely that he is hospitalized. The episode also showed that Principal lives in a fraternity house with other similar, violent, college-age men that is a few houses down the street from Randy and Sharon Marsh's house.  It is later implied that he is part of a larger conspiracy involving online ads.  Once he discovers this conspiracy, however, he turns against the ads to defend humanity from their intolerance. His character was central to most episodes of the nineteenth season, and at the end of the season, he announced in the episode "[[PC Principal Final Justice]]" that he would be remaining as principal of South Park Elementary.  He has been the principal ever since. PC Principal got vice principal Strong Woman pregnant, who gave birth to (quintuplets) 5 children known as PC Babies.

==Mr. Slave==
'''Mr. Slave''', voiced by [[John Hansen (voice actor)|John Hansen]], is the homosexual lover of Mr. Garrison up until the episode "[[Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina]]" when he breaks up with Garrison after Mr. Garrison had a sex change. Mr. Slave, as his name suggests, is a [[Sadomasochism|masochist]] and is permanently dressed in a [[leather subculture|leather]] [[bondage (sexual)|bondage]] outfit. His [[catchphrase]] is an excited exclamation of "Jesus Christ!" spoken with a [[gay lisp|lisp]]. In many episodes, he says little else.

Mr. Slave's first major appearance is during the fourteenth episode of season six "[[The Death Camp of Tolerance]]", although his voice was heard briefly in "[[Butters' Very Own Episode]]". Despite Mr. Slave's occupation, he is shown to be wise and knowledgeable, offering characters advice. One of his most prominent moments was in "[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]", when he gave Wendy Testaburger and most of the town advice that [[Paris Hilton]] is not to be admired. He explains that he himself is a whore and that it is not a good thing. He then shoves Hilton up his own anus, where she meets the same creatures Lemmiwinks did in "The Death Camp of Tolerance".

After Garrison's sex change operation, Mr. Slave ended their relationship due to no longer being sexually interested in Garrison and that his own feelings about the operation were not brought up prior. By the events of "[[Follow That Egg!]]", despite Garrison's attempts to stop him, Mr. Slave moved on and married [[Big Gay Al]].

==Ms. Stephenson==
'''Ms. Stephenson''' appeared as the [[kindergarten]] teacher for South Park Elementary in "[[Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy]]". She falls in love and has sex with [[Ike Broflovski]]. They run away together after Kyle's strenuous attempts lead to their prosecution. Ms. Stephenson eventually commits [[suicide]] because of the ordeal. She drives a blue [[pickup truck]] with yellow stripes.

==Mr. Stkrdknmibalz==

'''Mr. Stkrdknmibalz''' (pronounced stick-your-dick-in-my-balls) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] language teacher hired in "[[Where My Country Gone?]]". He leads various South Park residents, including [[Mr. Garrison]], in singing the Canadian [[ABCs]], which is similar to the [[United States|American]] version, but with varied lyrics (for example, [[G]] is replaced by "Guy", and Mr. Stkrdknmybalz points it out on a wall chart, where it is a G with eyes and a [[top hat]] drawn on it).

==Mrs. Streibel==
'''Yvonne Streibel''' appeared in "[[Toilet Paper (South Park episode)|Toilet Paper]]". She is the art teacher and gave Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny detention for making a penis sculpture out of clay. They decided to get revenge by [[toilet papering]] her house. She is married and has two daughters.

== Strong Woman ==
'''Strong Woman''' is the vice-principal of South Park Elementary. She has blonde hair and wears a lilac-blue coat and a dark purple shirt. Strong Woman is first introduced in the episode "[[Super Hard PCness]]", in which she is hired by PC Principal as the vice-principal to address the problem of bullying in the school. Woman is assertive of herself and dislikes those who are assertive for her, seeing it as a way of quietening her. She develops a sexual relationship with PC Principal by the following episode, "[[Splatty Tomato]]". Strong Women later gives birth to (quintuplets) 5 children referred to as PC Babies, due to being extremely PC. PC Principal is secretly their father.

==Principal Victoria==
'''Principal Victoria''' was the [[head teacher|principal]] of South Park Elementary for the first eighteen seasons. She was always seen with curly hair and glasses, and usually appears with [[Mr. Mackey]]. Her name is a play on [[Victoria Principal]]. She speaks with a heavy [[North-Central American English|Minnesotan accent]].

In "[[Helen Keller! The Musical]]", she reveals that she does recreational drugs. In the episode "[[Sexual Harassment Panda]]", when she was put on the witness stand during Cartman's second trial over the school allowing him to be sexually harassed, Principal Victoria hysterically confessed that she murdered a man, cut up his body, and hid his remains (though the court was only interested in whether or not the school did anything to stop Cartman from being sexually harassed). In "[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]", it is revealed that Principal Victoria has been a breast cancer survivor for seven years, which inspires Wendy to fight back against Cartman (who, according to Principal Victoria, is Wendy's "cancer").

Principal Victoria appears to be very able to run the school, despite its strange crew. In "[[Go God Go]]", she is shown telling [[Mr. Garrison|Mrs. Garrison]] he has to teach [[evolution]] in class, which he refuses. When pushed, he makes a complete mess of the subject, so Principal Victoria asks [[Richard Dawkins]] to teach it. Her husband is shown for the first time on the episode "[[About Last Night... (South Park)|About Last Night...]]". In "[[Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut]]", when Garrison asks "who here hasn't had sex with Mrs. Cartman", she and Mayor McDaniels exchange uncomfortable glances, implying that she, like almost everyone else in South Park, has at some point slept with Mrs. Cartman.

At the start of season nineteen, "[[Stunning and Brave]]", Victoria was said to have been fired as principal and replaced by PC Principal.  However, she resurfaces in the episode "[[Sponsored Content (South Park)|Sponsored Content]]" to confide to Garrison the truth of how she actually lost her position as the two return to South Park.

==Mr. Venezuela==
'''Mr. José Venezuela''' is the janitor.  He appeared in "[[Mystery of the Urinal Deuce]]" and is a stereotypical poor [[Latin Americans|Latin American]] immigrant.  He has three children. He makes six dollars an hour, at best. Also, in the same episode, his first name is revealed to be José. Later, he also replaces the school bus driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/2010/dec|title=Blog|author=|date=|website=southparkstudios.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109133245/http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/2010/dec|archivedate=2011-01-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mr. Wyland==
'''Mr. Wyland''' was the 3rd grade substitute teacher for [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]] for two episodes after Mr. Garrison was caught attempting to molest a child (Cartman) in "[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]". Wyland wears a blue top with a red bow tie. He was first shown in "[[Cherokee Hair Tampons]]" and made the class make a get well card for Kyle, who needed a kidney transplant. As a joke, the children make Butters into a get well card by gluing glitter and a sign that says "Get Well Kyle" on him and making him sing a song for Kyle. He was then shown in the next episode, "[[Chef Goes Nanners]]", and organized a debate on whether or not to change the South Park Flag, which depicted four white men hanging a black man.

'''Louis-Achille Delaquerrière''', who was born in [[Les Loges, Seine-Maritime|Les Loges]], France 24 February 1856&lt;ref name="Oursel"&gt;Oursel, N-N. ''Nouvelle Biographie Normande.'' Alphonse Picard, Paris, 1888, p53.&lt;/ref&gt; and died in Paris 11 September 1937, was a French opera singer, and later a voice pedagogue, active in France.

==Life and career==
As a child he was a pupil in the choir of [[Rouen Cathedral]].&lt;ref name="Oursel"/&gt; Although rejected as a student at the [[Paris Conservatoire]], Louis became a pupil of Louise de Miramont-Tréogate (whom he subsequently married), and later served on the [[Paris Conservatoire]]'s Admissions jury panel (1910) and its Concours jury for 1929 and 1933. He attended l'École Niedermeyer (piano, organ, composition) and was also coached by Jean-Baptiste Faure with whom Louise herself had studied.

Louis made his debut at the [[Opéra-Comique]] as Daniel in ''[[Le chalet]]'' on 16 March 1881.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;Martin J. ''Nos artistes des théâtres et concerts.'' Paul Ollendorff, Paris, 1895.&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[La Monnaie]] in Brussels, Delaquerrière sang Wagner in ''[[Mefistofele|Méphistophélès]]'' by Boito in 1883, created a role in ''Le panache blanc'' (by Philippe Flon) and sang L'abbé in ''Le trésor'' (by Charles Lefebvre) in 1884, created David in the local premiere of ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg|Les maîtres chanteurs de Nuremberg]]'' (translated by Victor Wilder) and appeared in ''Joli Gilles'' (Ferdinand Poise) in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;[http://carmen.demunt.be/ Computerised Archival Retrieval in Multimedia Enhanced Networking - The digital opera archives of La Monnaie.] accessed 11 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

He sang in Geneva for a season then returned to the Opéra-Comique.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; There he sang in ''Mignon'' (Wilhelm), ''[[La dame blanche]]'' (Georges), ''[[La Traviata]]'' (Alfredo), ''[[Carmen]]'' (Don José), ''L'Ombre'' (by Flotow), ''[[Le postillon de Lonjumeau]]'', and created Le comte de Nangis in Chabrier's ''[[Le roi malgré lui]]'' (1887).&lt;ref&gt;Soubies A, Malherbe C. ''Histoire de l'opéra comique - La seconde salle Favart 1840-1887.'' Flammarion, Paris, 1893.&lt;/ref&gt; At the 100th performance of ''[[The Barber of Seville|Le Barbier de Séville]]'' at the Opéra-Comique on 25 Feb 1887, he sang Almaviva with [[Cécile Mézeray|Mézeray]] as Rosine and [[Gabriel Soulacroix|Soulacroix]] as Figaro; other roles with the company included Mergy in ''[[Le pré aux clercs]]'' and Alexis in ''[[Le déserteur]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff S. ''Un demi-siècle d'Opéra-Comique (1900-1950).'' André Bonne, Paris, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;

The singer was on good terms with several contemporary artists and composers;&lt;ref name="uwo"/&gt; his close friendship with Chabrier resulted in a proposal to mount a concert of the composer's works in [[Royan]] in 1888, where Delaquerrière was enjoying success; Chabrier in one of his most bitter letters tore the idea to shreds.&lt;ref name=Delage&gt;Delage R. ''Emmanuel Chabrier''. Fayard, Paris, 1999, p484-485.&lt;/ref&gt; Among his papers were letters from composers of his time, as well as manuscripts, including one of Liszt.&lt;ref name="uwo"/&gt;

Delaquerrière appeared at Monte Carlo in early 1889, singing Vincent in ''[[Mireille (opera)|Mireille]]'', Philémon in ''[[Philémon et Baucis]]'', Wilhelm Meister in ''[[Mignon]]'', Sylvain in ''[[Les Dragons de Villars]]'' and Don José in ''[[Carmen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Joseph Walsh (Wexford)|Walsh TJ.]] ''Monte Carlo Opera 1879-1909.''

In January 1893 he sang Pierre in the premiere of Messager's ''[[Madame Chrysanthème (opera)|Madame Chrysanthème]]'' at the [[Théâtre de la Renaissance|Salle de la Renaissance du Théâtre-Lyrique]], where he also sang in ''[[Fra Diavolo]]'', ''Le Barbier de Séville'' and ''[[Oberon (Weber)|Obéron]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Noel E &amp; Stoullig E.

He left the stage while still young (1899) to devote his time to vocal teaching.

For 25 years, both the Paris Opéra and Opéra-Comique recruited artists at his School.  Among his pupils were well-known opera singers such as [[Edmond Clément]], [[Lucienne Bréval]] and Paul Franz. [[Emma Calvé]], although not a pupil, came to rehearse at the Delaquerrière home, particularly while they were all in Brussels at the same time.

His son was [[:fr:José Delaquerrière|José Delaquerrière]] (born Paris 16 September 1886, died Montreal 10 April 1978), also a tenor, known for his leading roles in operetta, whose early musical training in Paris was provided by his parents.&lt;ref name="uwo"&gt;[http://news.westernu.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/11/WNews-May26-05.pdf Vignette of French life research 'gold mine,' May 26, 2005, p. 9] retrieved 21 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Savoir chanter'' (first published 1976 (Éd.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5999">The '''Milwaukee Project''' was a program begun in the 1960s designed to improve the [[IQ]]s and scholastic achievement of children at risk and to study the effects of intellectual stimulation on children from deprived environments.

==The Project==
Rick Heber of the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] examined the statistics of districts in the city of [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]]. His attention was drawn towards one district, where the residents had the lowest median income and lowest level of education in the city. The unemployment rate was also very high. Although this district contained only 3% of the city’s population, 33% of all children who had been labeled "mentally retarded" lived there.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Program==
Heber selected 40 newborns from this district. All had a mother with an IQ lower than 80. In many cases the father was absent. The newborns were randomly assigned to an experimental and a [[control group]]. Mothers of children in the experimental group received education, vocational rehabilitation, and training in homemaking and child care. The children were brought to infant stimulation centers, where they received a high quality educational program designed to develop language and cognitive skills. They also received three balanced meals a day. They stayed there five days a week, seven hours a day. When the children were six the program ended. The children then attended local schools. Both the experimental group and the control group were tested an equal number of times throughout the project.&lt;ref name=Edublox&gt;{{cite web|title=The Role of Genetics in IQ and Intelligence|url=http://iq-test.learninginfo.org/iq03.htm|work=Article|publisher=Edublox|accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Findings==
According to Heber and colleagues, by age six all of the children from the experimental group had higher IQs than all of the children from the control group. Mean IQ was 120 in the experimental group and 87 in the control group. After the children left the program their IQs started declining. By the time both groups were ten years old the IQs of the children of the experimental group had decreased to 105. Mean IQ in the control group was 85.&lt;ref name=Edublox /&gt;

At age 14, the children in the experimental group had a mean IQ ten points above that of the control group, but the scholastic achievement scores of the experimental group were not better than those of the control group. Both groups performed in school as would be expected from children with a mean IQ of 80. For this reason, [[Arthur Jensen]] has suggested that the Milwaukee Project did not produce permanent intelligence gains, but that the IQ gains it showed were due to an indirect form of "[[teaching to the test]]".&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1998, pp. 340–342&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

The Milwaukee Project's claimed success was celebrated in the popular media and by famous psychologists. However, later in the project Rick Heber, the principal investigator, was discharged from the University of Wisconsin–Madison and convicted and imprisoned for large-scale abuse of federal funding for private gain. Two of Heber's colleagues in the project were also convicted for similar abuses. The project's results were not published in any refereed scientific journals, and Heber did not respond to requests from colleagues for raw data and technical details of the study. Consequently, even the existence of the project as described by Heber has been called into question. Nevertheless, many college textbooks in psychology and education have uncritically reported the project's results.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds &amp; Fletcher-Janzen 2001, pp. 462–463, 635–636&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sommer &amp; Sommer 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''My Mom's Having a Baby''''' is an American television teen comedy/documentary that aired as an ''[[ABC Afterschool Special]]'' on February 16, 1977. The program would be historic as it was the first television program of its kind in the [[United States]] to showcase the pregnancy process and conception to young people, using a combination of animation and live action. The program was a co-production between [[Dick Clark Productions]] and [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises]].

==Premise==
Upon learning that his mother is pregnant with what will be his brother, 10-year-old Petey Evans begins to wonder (through animated fantasies and flashbacks) about how babies are born, only to realize that those theories are not delivered by storks or popping out of a stomach. So, with help from his friends Oskar and Kelly, they go to a real expert who will be performing the delivery, Dr. [[Lendon Smith]], who uses an animated film that explains in detail (via Smith's narration) of how a pregnancy begins and how the child is conceived.

The remaining portion of this program features an actual live birth being performed in front of the cameras, which was taken from a 1974 [[ABC's Wide World of Entertainment]] special called ''[[David Hartman (TV personality)|David Hartman]]: Birth &amp; Babies''.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Ledger]] (Lakeland, Florida): "Actual Birth of Baby to be Televised", February 13, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/20/arts/television-the-quiet-life-as-pursued-by-david-hartman.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all "Television — The Quiet Life as Pursued by David Hartman"] From New York Times (August 20, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Actress Candace Farrell, who played the mother in this program, was pregnant at the time of filming the 1974 special, which resulted in the producers hiring her for this program.

==Awards==
*This program won a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] in 1977 for Outstanding Children's Informational Special.

==Cast==
*Shane Sinutko as Petey Evans
*Jarred Johnson as Oskar
*Rachael Longaker as Kelly
*Lendon Smith as himself
*Candace Farrell as Anne Evans

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18379">The '''Nordic Mathematical Contest (NMC)''' is [[List of mathematics competitions|a mathematics competition]] for secondary school students from the five [[Nordic countries]]: [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]]. It takes place every year in March or April and serves the double purpose of being [[List of mathematics competitions|a regional secondary school level mathematics competition]] for the [[Nordic countries|Nordic region]] and a step in [[International Mathematical Olympiad selection process|the process of selection of the teams]] of the participating countries for the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] (IMO) and the regional [[Baltic Way (mathematical contest)|Baltic Way competition]].

==Participation==
At most twenty participants from each country are appointed by the organisers of [[#External links|the national secondary school level mathematics competitions]]. They must either be eligible to the IMO or attend a secondary school.&lt;ref name = "reg11"/&gt;  (The foreword of ref.&lt;ref name = "probl20y"/&gt; renders the eligibility requirements unlike [[#Regulations|the past and present regulations]].)

==Problems==
The exam consists of four problems to be answered in four hours. Only writing and drawing tools are permitted. For each problem the contestant can get from zero to seven points. The problems are of the IMO type and harder than those of [[#External links|the national secondary school level competitions in mathematics of the Nordic countries]] but not as hard as those of the IMO. They are chosen by the organising committee of the host country of the year from proposals submitted by [[#External links|the national organising committees]].&lt;ref name = "reg11"/&gt;

The [[#External links|official web site of the NMC]] provides a complete collection in English with solutions of the problems from all the years. It is compiled by Matti Lehtinen. Selected versions of the problems in other [[North Germanic languages|Nordic languages]] are also available at the site

==Organisation==
The NMC is run in a decentralised manner involving no travel of the contestants nor any other personnel. The contestants write the exam in their own schools on the same day. Thence the papers are sent to a committee in the contestants' country who mark them preliminarily. They are then forwarded with the preliminary marking to a committee in the host country of the year, who coordinate the marking and decide the final result of each contestant. Hosting the NMC rotates among the participating countries in a fixed order. In each country, the NMC is run by the organisers of [[#External links|the country's secondary school level mathematics competition]].&lt;ref name = "reg11"/&gt;

==History==

===Start===
The early history of the NMC is documented in a series of reports&lt;ref name = "r1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "r3"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "r4"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "r5"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "r6"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "p9"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "r9"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "r10"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "r11"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "r13"/&gt; in the journal [http://normat.no Normat]. According to Åke Samuelsson,&lt;ref name = "r1"/&gt; the NMC was founded at a meeting of the leaders of the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] teams at the 27th IMO in Warsaw 1986. As [[Denmark]] did not participate in the IMO before 1991, no team leader from [[Denmark]] was there. The founding countries were [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]]. The first NMC took place on 30 March 1987 hosted by [[Sweden]] with 47 contestants from the four participating countries. It is stressed in the report that the organisation was minimal. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th NMCs took place in 1988-90 hosted by [[Norway]], [[Iceland]]&lt;ref name = "r3"/&gt; and [[Finland]],&lt;ref name = "r4"/&gt; respectively. This established the hosting order for the future.

Rumors of this new mathematics competition reached [[Denmark]], and in 1989 a single [[Denmark|Danish]] student, who was very eager to participate, was allowed to write the exam in a school in [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name = "r3"/&gt; In 1990 more Danish students participated, so Matti Lehtinen could write in his report:&lt;ref name = "r4"/&gt; "For the first time the NMO may now be called a common [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] competition since all five [[Nordic countries]] participated with at least half a dozen pupils." (Translated from [[Swedish language|Swedish]]; the abbreviation NMO is elucidated in [[#Name|the section Name below]].) [[Denmark]] was invited to host the NMC in 1991, the year [[Denmark]] entered the IMO, but since the [[Denmark|Danish]] organisers were yet unexperienced, the [[Sweden|Swedish]] organisers agreed to host the NMC for a second time.&lt;ref name = "r5"/&gt; [[Denmark]] would then host the NMC in 1992&lt;ref name = "r6"/&gt; and again in 1996.&lt;ref name = "r10"/&gt; In the future, the hosting order would be the present one: [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[Iceland]], [[Finland]], [[Denmark]].

Slightly diverging views of the aim of the NMC among its founders are indicated in the reports. According to Åke Samuelsson's report from the 1st NMC,&lt;ref name = "r1"/&gt; the participants in the founding meeting discussed "the possibility of arranging a [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] mathematics competition which in difficulty would lie somewhere between [[List of mathematics competitions|the national competitions]] and [[International Mathematical Olympiad|the International Mathematical Olympiad]]" (translated from [[Swedish language|Swedish]]). This suggests that they wanted NMC to be a regional mathematics competition in its own right at a level accessible for [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] secondary school students. In Matti Lehtinen's report&lt;ref name = "r4"/&gt; from the 4th NMC the NMC is seen rather as a vehicle for the training for the IMO: "Most of the participants were candidates for [[International Mathematical Olympiad|the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO)]], and the NMO may be seen at all as a link in the training for the IMO." (Translated from [[Swedish language|Swedish]].) The latter view is expressed in the foreword of ref.&lt;ref name = "probl20y"/&gt; as well.

===Name===
[[File:Regulations of the Nordic Mathematical Contest 1991.png|thumb|Regulations 1991]]

The name of the competition has changed over time. Originally it was called 'The Nordic Mathematics Olympiad' ({{lang-sv|Den nordiska matematikolympiaden}}).&lt;ref name="r1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r4"/&gt; The 1991 regulations (see image) display the present name, 'The Nordic Mathematical Contest', and words equivalent in [[Scandinavia]]n languages to 'competition' or 'contest' are used in the subsequent reports&lt;ref name = "r5"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "r6"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "p9"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "r9"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "r10"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "r11"/&gt; except in 1999, when 'olympiad' returns temporarily.&lt;ref name = "r13"/&gt; The following remark in ref.&lt;ref name="r4"/&gt; seems to reflect some discussion of the name in the early days; the word 'olympiad' may have been felt too pretentious: "The Fourth Nordic Mathematics Olympiad [&lt;span&gt;[[Swedish language|Swedish]]&lt;/span&gt;: matematikolympiaden], or maybe more descriptively—Mathematics Competition [&lt;span&gt;[[Swedish language|Swedish]]&lt;/span&gt;: matematiktävlingen] took place on 5 April 1990." (Translated from [[Swedish language|Swedish]].) In ref.&lt;ref name = "probl20y"/&gt; the NMC  is called 'The Nordic Mathematical Competition'.

===Regulations===
The first documented regulations of the NMC were issued for the 5th NMC in 1991. (See image.) They were applied unaltered in 1992 and apparently with at most minor changes in the following years. According to these regulations students in a 'gymnasium' (10th&amp;ndash;12th school year in the [[Education|educational systems]] of [[Nordic countries|the Nordic countries]], in the regulations referred to as the 'upper school') are eligible to participate without any age limit. The curriculum comprises "any branch of mathematics suitable for upper school students", and it is stressed that it is thus broader than that of the IMO. In particular, "problems from calculus and elementary probability theory" may occur. The subjects of most of the problems that have been posed at the NMC actually lie within the traditional IMO curriculum. However, problem 4 in 2002 must be deemed outside this curriculum since its formulation involves the concept of probability. No aim of the NMC is specified in the 1991 regulations.

Regulations issued for the 11th NMC in 1997&lt;ref name = "reg97"/&gt; are very similar to those of 1991, the most conspicuous difference being that the host country is now allowed to propose problems. According to the 1991 regulations, proposals should be collected from the countries other than the host country. It is not known at which of the NMCs 1993&amp;ndash;97 this change was first implemented.

The 1997 regulations seem to have been acknowledged until 1999. In fact, in this year, at a meeting of the leaders of the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] teams&lt;ref name = "lea99"/&gt; during the IMO, the leader of the [[Norway|Norwegian]] team raised the issue that the 1997 regulations prevented the participation of talented students who were too young to be in a 'gymnasium'. As a repair he proposed to change in point 4 of the regulations the words "enrolled in an upper school (gymnasium)" to "enrolled in an upper school (gymnasium) or eligible to the IMO". The meeting consented to the proposal.

The decision of the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] team leaders at the 40th IMO in 1999 was never implemented in the context of the NMC, but its rule of eligibility was adobted for [[Baltic Way (mathematical contest)|the Baltic Way competition]] in 2000 hosted by [[Norway]]&lt;ref name = "BWan00"/&gt; and except for a minor change of wording it remains the basic rule of eligibility of this competition.&lt;ref name = "BWreg12"/&gt; In 2000, 2001, 2005 and 2006, the hosts of the NMC issued a statement whose version from 2005 is cited below. According to this statement, the eligibility to the IMO is the main criterion for the eligibility to the NMC. It is accepted, however, that this criterion may not be fulfilled in "some borderline cases". About the problems it is stated only that they should be "slightly below the IMO level". The marking scale is specified according to the tradition. The full text of the statement reads as follows in its version from 2005:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

"We shall not publish a detailed regulation, but just remind everybody of the basic facts:

*Each country can enroll a maximum of 20 participants
*Participants should be eligible for the next IMO (there is [a] possibility of some borderline cases, where the IMO elig[i]bility is no[t] fulfilled, perhaps because of age, as we have noticed some years ago, but we will not make [a] problem of this).
*The contest consist of four problems slightly below the IMO level. All countries are allowed and asked to submit problem proposals, but the final choice of problems is left to the organizing country.
*The organizing country prepares the exam reasonably early so that the participating counties can make their translations in good time. The organizing country checks the translations before the contest.
*The contest takes place on March 30, 2005, basically at each participant's own school. The contact persons in the participating countries take care of the local arrangements.
*After the contest, the students' papers are preliminarily marked in the participating countries an[d] sent to the organizing country for a coordination of the marking. The problems are marked on a scale with maximum five points for each problem. The organizing country provides guidelines for marking. The coordination ends ultimo April[.]
*The organizing country provides the final result sheet and diplomas, if possible before the end of the school year."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After a mail conference in 2009 among the organisations of [[List of mathematics competitions|the national mathematics competitions]], regulations&lt;ref name="reg10"/&gt; were issued again for the competition in 2010 and have since then been applied essentially unaltered.&lt;ref name="reg11"/&gt; For the first time an aim of the NMC is stated in these regulations: The participants should experience a mathematical contest at an international level, and the NMC should provide information relevant for the selection of the teams for the IMO. The participants should be eligible to the IMO, and also other secondary school students are allowed to participate. The mathematical content of the problems is that of  the IMO and their intended level of difficulty slightly lower than that of IMO problems. An annual meeting of the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] leaders during  the IMO, which has taken place traditionally throughout the history of the NMC, is mentioned in the regulations for the first time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8670">The '''Opificio delle pietre dure''', literally meaning ''Workshop of semi-precious stones'', is a public institute of the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities (Italy)|Ministry for Cultural Heritage]] based in [[Florence]]. It is a global leader in the field of [[art restoration]] and provides teaching as one of two Italian state conservation schools (the other being the [[Istituto Superiore per la Conservazione ed il Restauro]]). The institute maintains also a specialist library and archive of conservation and a museum displaying historic examples of [[Pietra dura|pietre dure]] inlaid semi-precious stones artefacts. A scientific laboratory conducts research and diagnostics and provides a preventive conservation service.

==Origins and early history ==
[[Image:Cathedral Virgin Mary-7.jpg|thumb|Altar decorated in ''[[commesso]]'', (Cathedral of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary (Velika Gospa), [[Dubrovnik]])]]
Being one of the famous artistic workshops of the [[Italian Renaissance]], the Opificio was established in 1588 at the behest of [[Ferdinando I de' Medici]] to provide the elaborate, inlaid precious and semi-precious stoneworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = OPD Museum | url = http://www.firenzemusei.it/00_english/opificio/index.html | accessdate = 2011-02-22 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110109123911/http://www.firenzemusei.it/00_english/opificio/index.html | archivedate = 2011-01-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the masterpieces of the crafts is the overall decoration of the [[Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze#Cappelle Medicee|Cappella dei Principi]] (Chapel of Princes) in the [[Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze]]. The technique, which originated from [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] [[inlay]] work, was perfected by the Opificio masters and the artworks they produced became known as "opera di commessi medicei" (''[[commesso (art technique)|commesso]]'' is the old name of the technique, similar to ancient mosaics) and later as "commesso in pietre dure" (semi-precious stones mosaic).

The artisans performed the exceptionally skilled and delicate task of inlaying thin veneers of semi-precious stones especially selected for their colour, opacity, brilliance and grain to create elaborate decorative and pictorial effects. Items of extraordinary refinement were created in this way, from furnishings to all manner of artworks. Today, artisans trained at the Opificio assist many of the world's museums in their restoration programmes.

The Opificio workshops were originally located in the [[Casino Mediceo. Florence|Casino Mediceo]], then in the [[Uffizi]] and were finally moved to their present location in Via Alfani in 1796.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = OPD Museum | url = http://www.firenzemusei.it/00_english/opificio/index.html | accessdate = 2011-02-22 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110109123911/http://www.firenzemusei.it/00_english/opificio/index.html | archivedate = 2011-01-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the 19th Century the institute's activities moved away from the production of works of art and towards its restoration. At first specialising in [[hardstone carving]], in which the workshops were a world authority, and then later expanding into other related fields (stone and marble sculptures, bronzes, ceramics).

==Recent history==

The second branch of the Institute (baboratori di restauro) had a more modern story. In 1932 [[Ugo Procacci]], the distinghished scholar of Florentine art, in his career as an officer of the Italian Ministry for Cultural Heritage, founded a Laboratory of restoration (original Italian name: ''Gabinetto di restauro'') at the Florence Soprintendenza. It was the first modern restoration laboratory in Italy (pre-dating of 7 years the [[Istituto Superiore per la Conservazione ed il Restauro]] in Rome) and one of the very first ones in all the world.
The Gabinetto di Restauro used scientific methods for the preliminary exhaminition of the works of art (as X radiography) and began an outstanding campaign of restoration on Tuscan Early Masters paintings, that was later known as "restauri di rivelazione" (literally meaning ''revealing restoration'').

&lt;!---[[image:Fortezza lab.jpg|thumb|right|Inside the laboratory at the [[Fortezza da Basso]].]] not at the commons yet---&gt;
In 1966, the fatal tragedy of the [[flood of the River Arno in Florence|flooding of the River Arno]], resulted in many priceless works of art requiring restoration. It provided a significant impetus for expansion of the Gabinetto di restauro's research and restorative services. More space was needed because of the sheer number of artworks which required restoration and also, in some cases, the large size of the pieces themselves, such as the immense 4.48 x 3.9m [[Crucifix (Cimabue, Santa Croce)|Crucifix]] by [[Cimabue]] from the [[Basilica di Santa Croce]]. The expansions provided new laboratories in the [[Fortezza da Basso]]. 
Thanks to financial aid and an influx of expertise from throughout the world, the Florentine Laboratory became, in a short time one of the vanguard restoration laboratories in the world, combining traditional practices with modern technology.

In 1975, the Cultural Heritage Ministry merged the Opificio laboratories with the Gabinetto di restauro (plus other minor Florentine restoration laboratories) and created a new Institute, the modern ''Opificio delle pietre dure''.

Today, the institute is organised in departments specific for the various types of artworks it treats. The laboratories are in three principal venues: in Via Alfani 78, in the historic centre of Florence; in the [[Fortezza da Basso]];  and in [[Palazzo Vecchio]] where restoration treatments on tapestries and textiles are carried out.
There are also several research and services offices.

The actual (updated on march, 26, 2012) Superintendent is  Marco Ciatti.
The Opificio has a board of directors of the departments, under the supervision of the Supertintendent.
It has also a gestional committee and a scientific committee.

===Departments===
*Tapestries and carpets
*Bronzes and ancient weapons
*Wooden sculptures
*Wall painting
*Drawings and prints
*Stoneworks
*Pietre dure mosaics
*Jewelry
*Easel paintings
*Terracotta and potteries
*Textiles

==Museum==
[[Image:Opificio delle pietre dure, ingresso.JPG|thumb]]
The small museum in the Via Alfani displays examples of pietre dure works, including cabinets, table tops and plates, showing an immense repertoire of decoration, usually either flowers, fruits and animals, but also sometimes other picturesque scenes, including a famous view of the [[Piazza della Signoria]]. There is also a large baroque fireplace entirely covered in [[malachite]], a dazzling and brilliant green stone as well as copies of painting executed in inlaid stone. Some of the exhibition space is dedicated to particular types of stone, such as the [[paesina]], extracted near Florence, the grain and colour of which can be used to create vivid landscapes.

An exhibition of the technical processes of pietre dure works through history, can be found on the first floor as well as a large range of finished works dating back to the time of the Medici. There are vases and furnishings decorated with [[Art Nouveau]] designs of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including a tabletop with a harp and garland by [[Emilio Zocchi]] (1849) and another decorated with flowers and birds by [[Niccolò Betti]] (1855).

The point of out-of-school learning is to overcome learning disabilities, development of talents, strengthen communities and increase interest in education by creating extra learning opportunities in the real world. In a study&lt;ref&gt;UCLA CRESST, [http://www.lasbest.org/resourcecenter/LASBEST_DOJ_Final%20Report.pdf The Long-Term Effects of After-School Programming on Educational Adjustment and Juvenile Crime:A Study of the LA’s BEST After-School Program]&lt;/ref&gt; performed by the UCLA [[National Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards, and Student Testing (CRESST)]] it was proven that out-of-school learning increases the interest in education and school itself.

==Implementation==
Out-of-school learning is typically not coordinated by the school itself. Out-of-school experiences are organized with community partners such as museums, sport facilities, charity initiatives, and more. Out-of-school experiences can range from [[service learning]] to summer school and expeditions or more commonly occur in day to day experiences at after-school with creative ventures such as arts courses and even sports. Some other examples of out-of-school learning are:

* homework and homework clubs
* study clubs – extending curriculum
* mentoring – by other pupils and by adults, including parents
* learning about learning
* community service and citizenship
* residential activities – study weeks or weekends

==Results==
It has been found in research&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wallacefoundation.org/KnowledgeCenter/KnowledgeTopics/CurrentAreasofFocus/Out-Of-SchoolLearning/Pages/default.aspx The Wallace Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; by the Wallace Foundation that out-of-school learning can be a great opportunity to discover and develop talents. Especially if a professional organization develops a learning environment that guides groups of pupils/students in their co-operation in creating a professional and publicly visible product, presentation or performance. Companies, cultural institutions and non governmental organizations can offer valuable out-of-school learning experiences.

Organizations will see results accordingly to the quality of the experience, whether they aim to promote active and healthy lifestyles, increase community involvement and visitors/members, to an interest in a company's corporate responsibility projects and employment opportunities.

==Projects==

In the United Kingdom alone several local and state bodies run out-of-school learning projects, with additional funding&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/566481.stm Cash boost for out-of-school learning]&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] (£9.1m in 2000). Some major examples of out-of-school learning projects are:
* [http://www.parentzonescotland.gov.uk/ Parentzone], an out of school learning initiative from the Scottish government
* [http://www.lasbest.org/ LA's Best], an out of school learning initiative from [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]] mayor of  Los Angeles, California from 1973 to 1993
* [http://www.sarahswereld.nl/ Sarahs'wereld] and [https://www.duurzaamdoor.nl/projecten/de-wenswijk De Wenswijk], out of school learning initiatives from the Wensenwerk Foundation sponsored by the [[Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment]] in the Netherlands.

'''Paul Sandford McGlothin''' (born 1948 in Tennessee, currently in New York City) is most well-known as an author and consultant on [[calorie restriction]] (CR) and CR research.

== Musical work ==
Paul McGlothin performed the [[clarinet]] with scholarships to [[Interlochen Arts Academy]]* and [[Oberlin Conservatory of Music]] as well as fellowships at the [[Tanglewood Music Center]]&lt;ref&gt;See especially the Students and Faculty section in [[Tanglewood Music Center]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the National Orchestral Association* – followed by principal clarinet positions in symphony [[orchestras]] at [[Carnegie Hall]] and [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]]. He organized events to honor the traditional music and dance of [[ethnicities]] in the United States and Puerto Rico – most notable being the Latin Dance Spectacular, the National [[Gospel Music|Gospel Choir]] Competition, and the New York [[Hispanic Heritage Month]] Celebration.

== Publications in Calorie Restriction ==
Paul McGlothin has attempted to bridge the gap between calorie restriction research and calorie restriction tools available to non-experts.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} He has attempted to integrate calorie restriction research with calorie restriction application in the following ways: a) ''The CR Way,''&lt;ref&gt;''The CR Way,'' by Paul McGlothin and Meredith Averill. (2008) New York: [[HarperCollins]].&lt;/ref&gt; co-authored with his wife, Meredith Averill, and launched on Barbara Walters’ longevity special, "Living to 150: Can You Do It?" It presents an approach to CR that recognizes the special challenges and opportunities that human beings experience in applying CR, as compared to the lab animals that thrive on it; b) ''The CR Way to Happy Dieting,''&lt;ref&gt;''The CR Way to Happy Dieting,'' by Paul McGlothin and Meredith Averill. (2010) LivingTheCRWay.com *&lt;/ref&gt; an online resource that takes advantage of research in [[neurochemistry]] to support healthful weight-loss efforts by starting people on a diet that first deals biochemically with their food-related emotions; and c) the Web site, LivingTheCRWay.com, maintained to provide new research results as they develop and are evaluated. The CR Way "diet" is based on decades of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fontana | first1 = L | last2 = Partridge | first2 = L | last3 = Longo | first3 = VD | year = 2010 | title = Extending Healthy Life Span — From Yeast to Humans | url = | journal = Science | volume = 328 | issue = 5976| pages = 321–326 | doi = 10.1126/science.1172539 | pmid = 20395504 | pmc=3607354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work in Longevity Research ==

Before the UCSF project, McGlothin and Averill helped assemble the CR cohort for human studies by Drs. Luigi Fontana and John Holloszy and their colleagues at the [[Washington University School of Medicine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fontana | first1 = L | last2 = Meyer | first2 = TE | last3 = Klein | first3 = S | last4 = Holloszy | first4 = JO | year = 2004 | title = Long-term calorie restriction is highly effective in reducing the risk for atherosclerosis in humans | url = | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 101 | issue = 17| pages = 6659–63 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0308291101 | pmid = 15096581 | pmc=404101}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work has grown into the first longitudinal study of the effects of human calorie restriction with a focus on optimal nutrition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meyer | first1 = TE | last2 = Kovacs | first2 = SJ | last3 = Ehsani | first3 = AA | last4 = Klein | first4 = S | last5 = Holloszy | first5 = JO | last6 = Fontana | first6 = L | year = 2006 | title = Long-term caloric restriction ameliorates the decline in diastolic function in humans | url = | journal = J Am Coll Cardiol | volume = 47 | issue = 2| pages = 398–402 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2005.08.069 | pmid = 16412867 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fontana | first1 = L | last2 = Klein | first2 = S | last3 = Holloszy | first3 = JO | last4 = Premachandra | first4 = BN | year = 2006 | title = Effect of long-term calorie restriction with adequate protein and micronutrients on thyroid hormones | url = | journal = J Clin Endocrinol Metab | volume = 91 | issue = 8| pages = 3232–5 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2006-0328 | pmid = 16720655 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fontana | first1 = L | last2 = Weiss | first2 = EP | last3 = Villareal | first3 = DT | last4 = Klein | first4 = S | last5 = Holloszy | first5 = JO | year = 2008 | title = Long-term effects of calorie or protein restriction on serum IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 concentration in humans | url = | journal = Aging Cell | volume = 7 | issue = 5| pages = 681–7 | doi = 10.1111/j.1474-9726.2008.00417.x | pmid = 18843793 | pmc=2673798}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fontana | first1 = L | last2 = Klein | first2 = S | last3 = Holloszy | first3 = JO | year = 2010 | title = Effects of long-term calorie restriction and endurance exercise on glucose tolerance, insulin action, and adipokine production | url = | journal = Age | volume = 32 | issue = 1| pages = 97–108 | doi = 10.1007/s11357-009-9118-z | pmid = 19904628 | pmc=2829643}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cangemi | first1 = R | last2 = Friedmann | first2 = AJ | last3 = Holloszy | first3 = JO | last4 = Fontana | first4 = L | year = 2010 | title = Long-term effects of calorie restriction on serum sex-hormone concentrations in men | url = | journal = Aging Cell | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 236–42 | doi = 10.1111/j.1474-9726.2010.00553.x | pmid = 20096034 | pmc=3569090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s and early 2000s McGlothin collaborated with a variety of labs on several projects, including testing the beneficial effects of maintaining low circulating blood glucose, studying the effect on the lipid profile, produced by various dietary fats, and creating a pilot study on [[resveratrol]] that was reported at the 2004 [[CR Society International|CR Society Intl.]] Conference&lt;ref&gt;McGlothin P (2004). "Resveratrol - CR Mimetic?" CR Society Intl. Conference DVD: CRIII&lt;/ref&gt; in Charleston. McGlothin’s work in testing and reporting CR results and helping create calorie restriction research projects led to his being named Research VP* of the [[CR Society International|CR Society]], where he works with scientists to plan studies. He also serves on the Society’s Board of Directors.*

In 2009, A. Janet Tomiyama, Ph.D., representing the laboratories of [[Elizabeth Blackburn]] (Biophysics and Biochemistry, [[UCSF]]) and Elissa Epel (Psychiatry, UCSF), invited McGlothin and Averill to collaborate in developing a human CR research project: Calorie Restriction with Optimal Nutrition and Aging (CRONA), including researchers in several related fields: Anne Brunet (Genetics, [[Stanford]]), Pankaj Kapahi ([[Buck Institute for Age Research]]), [[Cynthia Kenyon]], (Biophysics and Biochemistry, UCSF), Jue Lin (Biochemistry &amp; Biophysics, UCSF). Eric Verdin (Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology* and UCSF). By early 2011 much of the data gathering had been accomplished.

Professor '''Richard Weston''' (born 1953) is an architect, landscape architect, author&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/wcidentities/lccn-nr92-42957 WorldCat identities]&lt;/ref&gt; and is also the Chair of Architecture at [[Cardiff University]].  He is Director of Richard Weston Studio Ltd and Earth Images Ltd.

==Professional background==

Weston was born in [[Leicester]] in 1953. He attended Wyggeston Boys Grammar School.  He went on to study architecture at [[University of Manchester|Manchester University]], gaining a BA in 1975 and [[Bachelor of Architecture|BArch in 1977]].  Supported by the [[Thouron Award]], he attended the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (USA) to study landscape architecture, gaining an [[Master of Landscape Architecture|MLA]] (Penn) in 1979.  From 1979–1982 he worked in practice and was appointed as a lecturer at the [[Welsh School of Architecture]] (WSA) in [[Cardiff]].  He subsequently taught at the Leicester and Portsmouth schools of architecture before returning to Cardiff in 1999 as a professorial research fellow.  In 2003 he was appointed to the Chair of Architecture, a position he holds today.

In addition to his teaching at the WSA, he is editor of arq (''Architectural Research Quarterly'', Cambridge University Press) and director of Richard Weston Studio Ltd and Earth Images Ltd.  Alongside his teaching duties, Weston is an experienced researcher with numerous books and publications to his name.  Most notably, he is author of two award winning books, a monograph on the architect [[Alvar Aalto]] and a study of the modernist movement titled [[Modernism]].  In addition he is the author of the definitive work on the life and achievements of [[Sydney Opera House]] architect, [[Jørn Utzon]]. Famously reclusive and private, Utzon granted Weston unlimited access to his archives and himself, enabling the publication of a unique study.

==Architectural work==

In 1992, Weston designed a glass roof to cover the sunken courtyard of a house built in a redundant water tank in [[Hampshire]]. Formed of stainless steel 'gutter trusses' whose profile, like a river, widens and deepens in response to the flow of water, and between them span laminated glass arches, with an interlayer to reduce heat gain from the sun.

Weston’s interest in structural glass found dramatic expression in a house he built for himself as part of FutureWorld (an exhibition designed to provide the public with a glimpse of the way homes might operate in the 21st century) in [[Milton Keynes]].  The 5.5 tonne stressed-skin plywood roof of Radiant House is supported only by glass – a feat achieved in collaboration with engineer Mark Lovell.

In 2002, he entered two architectural competitions, taking the opportunity they posed to explore ideas.  The first for the [[Royal Danish Playhouse|Royal Playhouse]] in [[Copenhagen]] (in collaboration with John Pardey Architects and eventually won by [[Lundgaard &amp; Tranberg|Lundgaard &amp; Tranberg Arkitekter]], who went on to build it) and the second for the Great Egyptian Museum in Cairo.  Whilst it did not win, the proposal, consisting of a 230m limestone dome, was selected for publication by the judges and Weston’s learning of the Egyptians’ fascination with the stars later became an inspiration for the designs for his own house and studio in [[Sully, Vale of Glamorgan|Sully]], South Wales - although sadly this was to remain on the drawing board.

==Design work==

Described by the Independent on Sunday as "the break out star of ''Britain's Next Big Thing''",&lt;ref name="The Independent on Sunday 20110320"&gt;{{cite news |title=Wrapped in thought: How an architecture professor become the hot new thing on Liberty's books |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/wrapped-in-thought-how-an-architecture-professor-become-the-hot-new-thing-on-libertys-books-2243865.html |work=[[The Independent on Sunday]] |date=20 March 2011 |accessdate=17 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  he appeared in the seven-part [[BBC2]] television series tracing the development of new products for leading retailers.

Using high-resolution scanners, he has generated designs for a collection of silk scarves from natural materials such as minerals and stones.This idea was presented at the ‘Best of British Open Design Call’ at Liberty in London (the world’s leading retailer of scarves) and, since their debut on the shelves in 2010, have quickly established themselves as amongst Liberty’s best selling lines.&lt;ref name="The Independent on Sunday 20110320"/&gt;

The images, which can be printed on most natural and man-made fibres, offer a wide range of application in architecture, interior design and fashion.  In addition to the scarves, they have appeared in Liza Bruce’s new ranges of swimwear.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}  Architectural applications are also currently being developed, with leading British architects [[Patel Taylor]] featuring an ‘agate façade’ in a house in Camden Town.  The London Olympic Games in 2012 followed suit, with four 5x3m images greeting athletes in the Olympic Village in Stratford. Weston's most recent public work is a four-storey banner installed in the atrium of the new Health Library at the Heath Hospital in Cardiff.

The scope of Weston's work has been extended by the purchase, in September 2014, of a sophisticated optical microscope and he is gaining increasing recognition internationally, with publications in the USA (Vincent Mok in ''Maniac Magazine'', May 2013, p58-9), Ukraine (in Russian in ''Salon'' magazine, September 2013, p82-7) and The Netherlands (''Mark'' magazine, June/July 2014, p160-167), as well as in two books on textile design published in the UK, the first by Melanie Bowles, ''Digital Textile Design'' (Laurence King, 2012), the second, Simon Clarke's ''Print: Fashion, Interiors, Art'' (Laurence King, 2014).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6265">'''Ruth H. Munce''' (January 24, 1898 – May 23, 2001) was an American romance novelist, mission teacher and founder of [[Keswick Christian School]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]].

== Early life, family history ==

Born in [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown, Pennsylvania]], Ruth Glover Hill was the second daughter of Presbyterian minister, Thomas Franklin Hill, who died when she was two. As a widow, her mother, [[Grace Livingston Hill]], author of over 100 Christian-themed romance novels, provided a comfortable lifestyle for Munce and her sibling in [[Swarthmore, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=death&gt;Basse, Craig (2001-04-25). [http://www.sptimes.com/News/052501/NorthPinellas/Keswick_school_founde.shtml Keswick School Founder Dies at 103]. ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]''. Retrieved April 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Munce's mother was not the only writer in her family line.  Her great-aunt, [[Isabella Macdonald Alden]], was also a well-known author who wrote a series called "The Pansy Books" from the mid-to-late 19th century.&lt;ref name="unhappy"&gt;Miller, Betty Jean (1988-05-30). "Unhappy with Public Education, She Founded a Christian School." ''[[St.Petersburg Times]]''. Retrieved April 13, 2007 from Lexis Nexis Academic.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family deaths birth literary life ==

Around 1925, she married Gordon Munce, who was an oil executive for [[Gulf Oil|Gulf]]. In subsequent years, the Munces adopted two sons, James and [http://www1.publishersweekly.com/article/CA168970.html#Making%20'Muncemeat' Robert]. Her husband, Gordon, died in 1947. Her mother, Grace Livingston Hill, also died in 1947, in the midst of writing the novel, ''Mary Arden''. [[J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co.|Lippincott Publishers]] asked Munce to finish her mother's book, and she took on that challenge. Writing under the pen-name, Ruth Livingston Hill, Munce attempted to continue in her mother's style of writing. She says that J. B. Lippincott could not tell the difference between what content was hers and what was her mother's, and Munce refused to show him any of the written variations.  Completion of her mother's novel led to her own career as an author, writing six more Christian romances. She also wrote a book of Bible studies and a textbook on the book of Genesis, published in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="unhappy"/&gt;

== The move south ==

Following the deaths of her mother and husband, Munce moved to [[Tampa Bay]] with her two sons. She performed a three-month stint at [[St. Petersburg High School]], teaching Bible history until the School Board decided to do away with this subject because it would open the way for more "subversive groups." At a crossroads in her career, Munce chose to finish her college education that she had  begun at [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]], but was interrupted by [[World War I]]. She earned a teacher's certificate.&lt;ref name="unhappy"/&gt;

==School founder ==

Attempting to fill a void in Christian education—something she wanted for her own children—in [[Pinellas County, Florida|Pinellas County]], Munce, with the help of friends, started a Christian school in Fall 1952 in a temporary location at the "Baptist Church on 22nd Avenue South." About 30 to 40 elementary students attended, perpetuating her passion to open a permanent school, which she did with her own financial backing in 1953&lt;ref name="unhappy"/&gt; in unincorporated Pinellas County, naming it Grace Livingston Hill Memorial School, in honor of her mother.&lt;ref name="death"/&gt;

Munce remained principal of the school she founded for at least ten years,&lt;!-- discrepancy in time of tenure. Basse says 15 years; Miller says 10 years. --&gt; teaching Bible and English classes in her tenure. In 1961, she turned the school over to Bill Caldwell, who was operating Keswick radio stations, WKES-FM and WGNB-AM, and the Southern Keswick Bible Conference on the same site as the school.  Reflecting the new ownership, the school was renamed [[Keswick Christian School]] in 1962.

== Missionary  ==

In 1968, at age 70, Munce undertook an eight-year stint teaching at Nairobi Bible Institute in Kenya.&lt;ref name="death"/&gt; Her book, ''What Happened?: A Study in Genesis (A Textbook for Christian Schools or Home Bible Study Groups)'' is based on her teachings while in Kenya.&lt;ref name="unhappy"/&gt; Returning home to Pinellas County in the mid-1970s, Munce made her missions local, leading up to 14 interdenominational Bible studies a week, a routine she continued well into her nineties, with participants admiring the "breadth of her knowledge".&lt;ref name="unhappy"/&gt;

== End of life ==

For her 102nd and 103rd birthdays, Munce celebrated with Keswick students at her place of residence at Pinecrest Place in [[Largo, Florida|Largo]], where she lived for approximately five years. Munce was said to have beamed at seeing the students, a testament to her diligence 50 years after the school's founding.&lt;ref name="birthday"&gt;Bolger-Paulet, Betsy (2001-01-31). "Woman Celebrates 103 Years with Her School's Students". ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]''. Retrieved April 13, 2007 by Lexis Nexis Academic.&lt;/ref&gt;

Munce died May 23, 2001, at Mariner Health of [[Belleair, Florida]], where she had been a resident for a week.&lt;ref name="death"/&gt;

'''St. Patrick's Institute of Science &amp; Technology''' is a [[Pakistan]]i [[vocational school]], located in the [[Saddar]] neighborhood of [[Saddar Town]] in [[Karachi]], [[Sindh]].

==History and administration==
In 1963, Fr. Dalmatius Geurts and [[James deSouza|Fr. Jimmy deSouza]] made an analysis of the situation and a feasibility study and came to the conclusion that there was a big demand for skilled craftsmen in Pakistan. The final plan was for a school for metal work, auto mechanics, electro-technology, air conditioning &amp; refrigeration, and carpentry.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Christian Voice, Karachi]]''. 17 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brother [[Norman Wray]], a [[La Salle Brothers, Pakistan|de La Salle]] brother, set up the school in 1965{{clarify|date=November 2016|reason=homepage of school's website states in top banner "Estd. 1966"}} and was its principal for 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Brother Norman Wray|url = http://www.smumn.edu/Resources/Images/17413.pdf|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101128225023/http://smumn.edu/Resources/Images/17413.pdf|archivedate = 2010-11-28|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1980, the principal of the school has been Brother George Abeyratne. The school is owned by the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Karachi]].

==Development==
With more than 350 students, the majority of whom are [[Muslim]]s, the school caters to Pakistan's growing industrial development which calls for more technicians. The school conducts regular, as well as short evening courses.

Students are admitted to regular courses after passing class eight examinations. The courses prepare students for the class ten examinations conducted by the [http://www.sbte.edu.pk Sindh Board of Technical Education] as well as the [[Diploma of Associate Engineer]] examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Staff | date = 16 May 2002 | url=  http://www.dawn.com/2002/05/16/local17.htm | title = Karachi: SBTE Exam Results | work = [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] | access-date = 17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the people who want careers as technicians take evening and short courses. They often get jobs as electricians or as air-conditioning and refrigeration mechanics. The school's fees for the courses are not high and concessions are granted to all deserving students. A computer section was scheduled to open in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{dead link|date=November 2016}} {{cite web |title = UCANews.com | date = 10 July 1990| url= http://www.ucanews.com/1990/07/10/la-salle-brothers-school-provides-technical-training/?key=st.+patrick's+technical+school+karachi | publisher = [[Union of Catholic Asian News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the only University in Cyprus with a system of three campuses in the major cities of Nicosia, Limassol and Larnaca.

The University of Nicosia is the largest private university in Cyprus; its current enrollment is over 11,000 students.

=== Founding ===

Intercollege was founded in 1980 by private initiative in order to prepare students for the examinations of recognized British professional bodies, such as the Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM) and the Communication, Advertising and Marketing Foundation (CAM).

In 1981, Dr Nicos Peristianis, the present Executive Dean of University of Nicosia, was appointed Director and the College began expanding its programs towards academic degrees. In its first decade of operation, Intercollege developed and modified courses of study in accordance with the College's growing constituencies, the needs of the Cypriot labor marke.

To this end, Intercollege prepared students for the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) examinations, which were accepted by the University of the State of New York and the [[Thomas Edison State College]] towards their external degrees. Through hard work and persistence, the College has steadily developed into a respected Cypriot college that awards its own diplomas, bachelor's and master's degrees on three campuses. In September 2007, the 27-year-old College was acknowledged as a University and now uses the name University of Nicosia, Cyprus. The University continues to offer a number of professional programs such as the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), the Certified Accounting Technician (CAT), and the Chartered Institute of Banking.

__NOTOC__
'''Victor Ninov''' ({{lang-bg|Виктор Нинов}}, born 1959) is a former researcher in the [[nuclear chemistry]] group at [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] (LBNL) who was alleged to have fabricated the evidence used to claim the creation of elements 118 and 116. These elements were later genuinely discovered by a Russian-American team at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] in [[Dubna]], [[Russia]] and named [[oganesson]] and [[livermorium]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ninov|first=Viktor|title=Observation of Superheavy Nuclei Produced in the Reaction of &lt;sup&gt;86&lt;/sup&gt;Kr with &lt;sup&gt;208&lt;/sup&gt;Pb|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=83|pages=1104–1107|date=1999|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.1104|bibcode=1999PhRvL..83.1104N|issue=6|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1233919/files/article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT20021015"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/15/science/at-lawrence-berkeley-physicists-say-a-colleague-took-them-for-a-ride.html?scp=2&amp;sq=victor%20ninov&amp;st=cse&amp;pagewanted=1 "At Lawrence Berkeley, Physicists Say a Colleague Took Them for a Ride"] George Johnson, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 15 October 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Ninov was trained at the [[Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung]] (GSI) in [[Germany]]. His hiring by the LBNL from GSI had been considered a coup: he had been involved in the discovery of [[darmstadtium]], [[roentgenium]], and [[copernicium]] (elements 110, 111, and 112) and was considered one of the leading experts at using the complex types of software needed to detect the [[decay chain]] of unstable [[transuranium element]]s.

An internal committee at the lab concluded that Ninov was the only person in the large project to translate the raw computer results into human-readable results and had used this opportunity to inject false data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Dalton|last=Rex|pages=728–729|title=Misconduct: The stars who fell to Earth|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=420|doi=10.1038/420728a|year=2002|pmid=12490902|issue=6917|bibcode = 2002Natur.420..728D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Re-analysis of the raw data did not indicate the events which Ninov's analysis originally reported.&lt;ref name="NYT20021015" /&gt;

Re-examination of the data from the experiments conducted at GSI during which Ninov's team had discovered elements 110 and 112 found that one false decay chain had been injected into the data for each element,&lt;ref name="NYT20021015" /&gt; even though there were already some factual decay chains in the original data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epja.edpsciences.org/index.php?option=article&amp;access=standard&amp;Itemid=129&amp;url=/articles/epja/abs/2002/05/epja1361/epja1361.html New results on elements 111 and 112] European Physical Journal, July 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://epja.edpsciences.org/index.php?option=article&amp;access=standard&amp;Itemid=129&amp;url=/articles/epja/abs/2004/01/100500003/100500003.html Second experiment at VASSILISSA separator on the synthesis of the element 112] European Physical Journal, June 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2002/07/more-elemental-fraud&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports on the Ninov affair were released around the same time that the final report on the [[Jan Hendrik Schön|Schön affair]], another major incident of fraud in physics. As a result, the [[American Physical Society]] adopted more stringent ethical guidelines, especially those regulating the conduct of co-authors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/19/science/after-two-scandals-physics-group-expands-ethics-guidelines.html?scp=7&amp;sq=victor%20ninov&amp;st=cse After Two Scandals, Physics Group Expands Ethics Guidelines] Dennis Overbye, New York Times, 19 November 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
