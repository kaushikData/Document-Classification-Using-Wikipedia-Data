[[File:John C Calhoun by Mathew Brady, 1849.jpg|thumb|right|Calhoun photographed by [[Mathew Brady]] in 1849|alt=Age 67, long gray hair, austere look, frowning, holding black cloak closed with both hands.]]
'''''A Disquisition on Government''''' is a political treatise written by U.S. Senator [[John C. Calhoun]] of [[South Carolina]] and published posthumously in 1851. Written in response to what Calhoun saw as the growing subjugation of the Southern United States by the more populous North, especially in terms of Northern promotion of [[tariffs|tariff]] legislation and opposition to [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], the 100-page ''Disquisition'' promotes the idea of a [[concurrent majority]] in order to protect what he perceived to be the South's interests. The ''Disquisition'', and other writings like it by Southern [[Fire-Eaters]], increased the feeling of sectionalism in the South and led ultimately to [[Secession in the United States|secession]] and the [[American Civil War]].

Calhoun died in 1850, and the ''Disquisition'' was published the following year.

==Premise==
The ''Disquisition on Government'' is a 100-page essay on Calhoun's definitive and comprehensive ideas on government, which he worked on intermittently for six years until its 1849 completion.{{sfn|Bartlett|1994| pp= 351–55}} It systematically presents his arguments that a numerical majority in any government will typically impose a despotism over a minority unless some way is devised to secure the assent of all classes, sections, and interests and, similarly, that innate human depravity would debase government in a democracy.{{sfn|Freehling|1965| pp= 25–42}}

==Summary==
Calhoun offered the concurrent majority as the key to achieving consensus, a formula by which a minority interest had the option to nullify objectionable legislation passed by a majority interest.  The consensus would be effected by this tactic of nullification, a veto that would suspend the law within the boundaries of the state.{{sfn|Coit|1950|pp= 150–151}}{{sfn|Krannawitter|2008| p= 171}}

Veto power was linked to the right of secession, which portended [[anarchy]] and social chaos. Constituencies would call for compromise to prevent this outcome.{{sfn|Krannawitter|2008| p= 174}} With a concurrent majority in place, the U.S. Constitution as interpreted by the Federal Judiciary would no longer exert collective authority over the various states. According to the [[Supremacy Clause]] located in Article 6, laws made by the federal government are the "supreme law of the land" only when they are made "in pursuance" of the U.S. Constitution.

These ideas are convincing if one shares Calhoun's conviction that a functioning concurrent majority never leads to stalemate in the legislature; rather, talented statesmen, practiced in the arts of conciliation and compromise would pursue "the common good",{{sfn|Coit |1950| p= 147}} however explosive the issue. His formula promised to produce laws satisfactory to all interests. The ultimate goal of these mechanisms were to facilitate the authentic will of the white populace. Calhoun explicitly rejected the founding principles of equality in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], denying that humanity is born free and equal in shared nature and basic needs. He regarded this precept as "the most false and dangerous of all political errors".{{sfn|Krannawitter|2008| pp= 166–167}} States could constitutionally take action to free themselves from an overweening government, but slaves as individuals or interest groups could not do so. Calhoun's stance assumed that with the establishment of a concurrent majority, minority groups would influence their own representatives sufficiently to have a voice in public affairs; the representatives would perform strictly as high-minded public servants. Under this scenario, the political leadership would improve and persist, corruption and demagoguery would subside, and the interests of the people would be honored. {{sfn|Krannawitter| 2008|pp= 170–171}} This introduces the second theme in the ''Disquisition'', and a counterpoint to his concept of the concurrent majority—political corruption.

Calhoun considered the concurrent majority essential to provide structural restraints to governance, believing that "a vast majority of mankind is entirely biased by motives of self-interest and that by this interest must be governed".{{sfn|Coit |1950| p= 149}} This innate selfishness would inevitably emerge when government revenue became available to political parties for distribution as patronage. Politicians and bureaucrats would succumb to the lure of government lucre accumulated through taxation, tariff duties and public land sales. Even a diminishment of massive revenue effected through nullification by the permanent minority would not eliminate these temptations. Calhoun predicted that electioneering, political conspiracies, and outright fraud would be employed to mislead and distract a gullible public; inevitably, perfidious demagogues would come to rule the political scene. A decline in authority among the principal statesmen would follow, and, ultimately, the eclipse of the concurrent majority.{{sfn|Freehling|1965|p=223}}

Calhoun contended that however confused and misled the masses were by political opportunists, any efforts to impose majority rule upon a minority would be thwarted by a minority veto.{{sfn|Freehling|1965|p=222}} What Calhoun fails to explain, according to American historian [[William W. Freehling]], is how a compromise would be achieved in the aftermath of a minority veto, when the ubiquitous demagogues betray their constituencies and abandon the concurrent majority altogether. Calhoun's two key concepts – the maintenance of the concurrent majority by high-minded statesmen on the one hand; and the inevitable rise of demagogues who undermine consensus on the other – are never reconciled or resolved in the ''Disquisition''.{{sfn|Freehling|1965|p=223}}

South Carolina and other Southern states, in the three decades preceding the Civil War, provided legislatures in which the vested interests of land and slaves dominated in the upper houses, while the popular will of the numerical majority prevailed in the lower houses. There was little opportunity for demagogues to establish themselves in this political milieu – the democratic component among the people was too weak to sustain a plebeian politician. The conservative statesmen – the slaveholding gentry – retained control over the political apparatus.{{sfn|Freehling|1965| pp= 225–226}}{{sfn|Varon|2008| pp= 91–92}}  Freehling described the state's political system of the era thus:

{{quote|quote=[T]he apportionment of [state] legislative seats gave the small majority of low country aristocrats control of the senate and a disproportionate influence in the house. Political power in South Carolina was uniquely concentrated in a legislature of large property holders who set state policy and selected the men to administer it. The characteristics of South Carolina politics cemented the control of upper class planters. Elections to the state legislature – the one control the masses could exert over the government – were often uncontested and rarely allowed the "plebeian" a clear choice between two parties or policies&amp;nbsp;...{{sfn|Freehling|1965| pp= 225–226}}}}

'''John C. Calhoun on the "concurrent majority" from his Disquisition (1850):'''

{{quote|quote=If the whole community had the same interests, so that the interests of each and every portion would be so affected by the action of the government, that the laws which oppressed or impoverished one portion, would necessarily oppress and impoverish all others – or the reverse – then the right of suffrage, of itself, would be all-sufficient to counteract the tendency of the government to oppression and abuse of its powers.&amp;nbsp;... But such is not the case. On the contrary, nothing is more difficult than to equalize the action of the government, in reference to the various and diversified interests of the community; and nothing more easy than to pervert its powers into instruments to aggrandize and enrich one or more interests by oppressing and impoverishing the others; and this too, under the operation of laws, couched in general terms – and which, on their face, appear fair and equal.&amp;nbsp;... Such being the case, it necessarily results, that the right of suffrage, by placing the control of the government in the community must&amp;nbsp;... lead to conflict among its different interests – each striving to obtain possession of its powers, as the means of protecting itself against the others – or of advancing its respective interests, regardless of the interests of others. For this purpose, a struggle will take place between the various interests to obtain a majority, in order to control the government. If no one interest be strong enough, of itself, to obtain it, a combination will be formed.&amp;nbsp;... [and] the community will be divided into two great parties – a major and minor – between which there will be incessant struggles on the one side to retain, and on the other to obtain the majority – and, thereby, the control of the government and the advantages it confers.{{sfn|Polin|Polin|2006| p= 380}}}}

==Publication==
The ''Disquisition'' was published in 1851, shortly after his death, as was another book, ''Discourse on the Constitution and Government of the United States''.{{sfn|Calhoun|1851}}

Many Southerners believed Calhoun's warnings, contained in the ''Disquisition'' and in his many other writings and speeches, and read every political news story from the North as further evidence of the planned destruction of the southern way of life. The climax came a decade after Calhoun's death with the election of Republican [[Abraham Lincoln]] in [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860]], which led to the secession of South Carolina, followed by six other Southern states. They formed the [[Confederate States of America]].{{sfn|Perman|2012|p=11}}

He looks at a girl, with her back to the spectator, who stands close to the window. She holds up a glass of wine in her right hand, as if she were about to give it to the cavalier with the pipes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5930">The '''Alb Limes''' ({{lang-de|Alblimes}}) is a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] frontier fortification or ''[[limes]]'' of the late 1st century AD in the [[Swabian Jura]], also known as the Swabian Alb. The Alb Limes runs for just under 135 kilometres from [[Rottweil]] (Latin: ''[[Arae Flaviae]]'') in the southwest to [[Heidenheim an der Brenz]] (Latin: ''Aquileia'') in the northeast.
&lt;!--
== Verlauf ==
[[Bild:Alblimes.png|thumb|450px|Möglicher Straßenverlauf des Alblimes]]
[[File:Modell wachturm aalen.jpg|miniatur|Innenansicht eines Wachturms am Obergermanisch-Rätischen Limes]]
Der Alblimes bestand aus einer Kette von [[Römische Militärlager|Kastellen]], von denen die meisten an der [[Wasserscheiden in Deutschland|Rhein-Donau-Wasserscheide]], also auf der [[Kammlinie]] der Alb, lagen. Der Alblimes war nicht mit Wall, Graben, Mauer oder [[Palisade]] befestigt, vielmehr markierte hier die Straße zwischen den Kastellen die Grenzlinie.

Der größere Teil des Alblimes lag auf dem Gebiet der [[römische Provinz|römischen Provinz]] [[Raetia]], nur die westlichen Kastelle Lautlingen, Geislingen a.&amp;nbsp;R., Rottweil und Sulz befanden sich in der Provinz [[Germania superior]].

== Geschichte ==
Der Alblimes entstand im Zuge des Baus der [[Kinzig (Rhein)|Kinzigtalstraße]] und der Gründung des römischen Rottweil im Jahre 73/74 n. Chr. Zumindest die südwestlichen [[Römische Militärlager|Kastelle]] des Alblimes in [[Lautlingen]] ([[Kastell Lautlingen]]), sowie die vorgelagerten Kastelle in [[Sulz am Neckar]] ([[Kastell Sulz]]) und [[Geislingen (bei Balingen)|Geislingen-Hasenbühl]] ([[Kastell Geislingen/Häsenbühl]]) dürften gleichzeitig entstanden sein.

Nicht ganz gesichert ist die Datierung der weiteren Kastelle des Alblimes in [[Burladingen]]-Hausen ([[Kastell Burladingen]]), [[Gomadingen]] ([[Kastell Gomadingen]]), [[Römerstein (Gemeinde)|Römerstein-Donnstetten]] (''[[Kastell Donnstetten|Clarenna]]''), [[Lonsee]]-Urspring (''[[Kastell Urspring|Ad Lunam]]'') und Heidenheim (''[[Kastell Heidenheim|Aquileia]]''). Überwiegend wird die Gründung im Jahre 74 n. Chr. angenommen, aber auch eine Entstehung erst unter Kaiser [[Domitian]] um 84 n. Chr. gilt als möglich. Genaueres kann mangels exakt datierbarer Funde bisher nicht gesagt werden. Bislang wurde erst das Kastell in Urspring durch [[Ausgrabung]] erforscht.

Der westliche Teil des Alblimes von Rottweil bis Donnstetten markierte nur für kurze Zeit die Außengrenze des [[Römisches Reich|römischen Reichs]], nämlich bis zur Vorverlegung der Grenze vom Rhein an [[Odenwald]] und Neckar unter Kaiser [[Trajan]] (vermutlich) im Jahre 98 n. Chr. (siehe: [[Lautertal-Limes]] und [[Neckar-Odenwald-Limes]]). Der östliche Teil des Alblimes von Donnstetten bis Heidenheim blieb hingegen bis um 122 n. Chr. Außengrenze des römischen Reichs. Spätestens um diese Zeit verlor der Alblimes seine militärische Bedeutung.

== Zusammenhang mit der Donautalstraße ==
Südlich des Alblimes verläuft die aus [[Claudius|claudischer]] Zeit stammende ''[[Donautalstraße]]'', in der Literatur auch [[Donausüdstraße]] genannt, weil sie ihren Verlauf parallel südlich der [[Donau]] nimmt. Diese [[Römerstraße|römische Fernstraße]] wurde zwischen 41 und 54 n.&amp;nbsp;Chr. zusammen mit den Kastellen der älteren Donaulinie des Rätischen Limes erbaut. Sie bildete mit der Donau selbst die Grenze zum freien Germanien und entwickelte sich spätestens mit dem Bau der Kinzigtalstraße 73/74&amp;nbsp;n.&amp;nbsp;Chr. zu einer strategisch und logistisch bedeutenden Ost-West-Verbindung zwischen den Legionslagern der germanischen Provinzen und dem Balkan.

== Besonderheit ==
Ende der 1990er Jahre wurden die Reste einer 1976 entdeckten antiken Befestigung bei [[Deggingen]] im oberen [[Fils (Fluss)|Filstal]] als römisches Kastell erkannt. Diese Anlage (etwa zwölf Kilometer nordöstlich von Donnstetten) diente offenbar als Flankenschutz im Vorfeld des Limes, der hier eine ziemlich tiefe Einbuchtung aufwies, und ist ein Hinweis auf die Bedeutung von Donnstetten (''Clarenna'') in römischer Zeit. Das Kastell Deggingen erklärt außerdem zumindest teilweise, wieso die römische Straße von [[Köngen]] am [[Neckar]] (lateinisch: ''[[Grinario]]'') nach Donnstetten außerhalb des Lautertal-Limes (also aus römischer Sicht in Feindesland) verlaufen konnte.
{{Siehe auch|Kastell Deggingen}}
Teilweise werden auch die römischen Kastelle in Essingen, [[Bopfingen|Oberdorf am Ipf]] (''[[Opia]]''), [[Munningen]] (''[[Losodica]]'') und [[Nördlingen]] (''[[Septemiacum]]''?) dem Alblimes zugerechnet. Sie sind vermutlich um 84 n. Chr. entstanden.

'''Barbarian Press''' is a fine press publisher, owned and operated by Jan Elsted and [[Crispin Elsted]] in [[Mission, B.C.]], Canada. In 1977, the Elsteds were working toward their PhD's in English literature at the [[University of London]] when they met Graham Williams of the Florin Press, who introduced them to letterpress printing using movable type and hand presses. By the time they returned to Canada in 1978 they had abandoned their academic careers, purchased type and a few presses, and were "determined to make beautiful books for the rest of their lives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goodman|first1=Richard|title=Here Come the Barbarians|url=http://www.finebooksmagazine.com/issue/200905/barbarian_press-1.phtml|website=Fine Books and Collections|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publication decisions and editorial work are shared. The design and typesetting (usually by hand) are by Crispin, and the presswork by Jan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shoesmith|first1=John|title=Barbarian Press: Endgrain Editions|url=http://hpcanpub.mcmaster.ca/case-study/barbarian-press-endgrain-editions|website=Historical Perspectives on Canadian Publishing|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The press publishes in several main areas—literary classics, translations, typography, and books on wood engraving. They publish works that they themselves would like to read, with a particular focus (to quote Jan) on "books which celebrate wood engravings as an art form."' Most of their publications use wood engravings as illustrations, and the press publishes an ongoing series of monographs on individual engravers called Endgrain Editions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hayward|first1=Michael|title=The Gutenberg Effect: Living a Handmade Life|url=http://www.geist.com/photography/the-gutenberg-effect/|website=Geist|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Elsteds periodically provide workshops in their pressroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hayward|first1=Michael|title=The Gutenberg Effect: Living a Handmade Life|url=http://www.geist.com/photography/the-gutenberg-effect/|website=Geist|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent books include a new textual edition of Shakespeare's ''Pericles'' in two volumes, with over a hundred engravings by Simon Brett; a selection from Richard Barham's ''The Ingoldsby Legends'', illustrated with unpublished wood engravings by the Dalziel brothers, engraved in the 1870s; and an edition of the odes of John Keats, with engravings by Andy English. The press's text types include Bembo, Poliphilus and Blado, Joanna, Van Dijck, Garamond, and Antigone (Greek); the press also has a large collection of printer's flowers and borders, including the Curwen Press collection of Monotype ornaments.

The Elsteds were awarded the Robert R. Reid Award for lifetime achievement or extraordinary contributions to the book arts in Canada by the [[Alcuin Society]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alcuinsociety.com/jan-and-crispin-elsted-recipients-of-the-7th-robert-r-reid-award/|title=Alcuin Society Robert R Reid Award|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benjamin Jonson''' (''c''. 11 June 1572 – ''c''. 16 August 1637&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bland|first=Mark|date=2004|title=Ben Jonson and the Legacies of the Past|jstor=10.1525/hlq.2004.67.3.371|journal=Huntington Library Quarterly|volume=67|pages=371–400}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an English playwright, poet, actor, and literary critic, whose artistry exerted a lasting impact upon English poetry and stage comedy. He popularised the [[comedy of humours]]. He is best known for the [[satire|satirical]] plays ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]''&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Jonson, Ben |volume=15 |pages=502–507 |first=Adolphus William |last=Ward}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1598), ''[[Volpone|Volpone, or The Fox]]'' (c. 1606), ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'' (1610) and ''[[Bartholomew Fair (play)|Bartholomew Fair]]'' (1614) and for his [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] and [[epigram]]matic poetry; he is generally regarded as the second most important English playwright during the reign of [[James VI and I]] after [[William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|306058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonson was a [[Classics|classically educated]], well-read and cultured man of the [[English Renaissance]] with an appetite for controversy (personal and political, artistic and intellectual) whose cultural influence was of unparalleled breadth upon the playwrights and the poets of the [[Jacobean era]] (1603–1625) and of the [[Caroline era]] (1625–1642).&lt;ref name="autogenerated388"&gt;"Ben Jonson", ''Grolier Encyclopedia of Knowledge'', volume 10, p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StewartHarp2000"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Evans |first=Robert C |year=2000 |editor=Harp, Richard |editor2=Stewart, Stanley |title=The Cambridge companion to Ben Jonson |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, England |isbn=0-521-64678-2 |pages=189–202 |chapter=Jonson's critical heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:William Camden by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Westminster School]] master [[William Camden]] cultivated the artistic genius of Ben Jonson.]]

[[File:Attributed to Abraham van Blijenberch - William Drummond of Hawthornden, 1585 - 1649. Poet - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Scottish poet [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]] was friend and confidant to Jonson.]]
In midlife, Jonson claimed that his paternal grandfather, who 'served King Henry 8 and was a gentleman',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-15116&lt;/ref&gt; was a member of the extended Johnston family of [[Annandale]] in the [[Dumfries and Galloway|Dumfries and Galloway]], a genealogy that is attested by the three spindles ([[rhombus|rhombi]]) in the Jonson family [[coat of arms]]: one spindle is a diamond-shaped [[Heraldry|heraldic]] device used by the Johnston family. 

Jonson's father lost his property, was imprisoned, and suffered [[forfeiture (law)|forfeiture]] under [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]]; having become a clergyman upon his release, he died a month before his son's birth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-15116&lt;/ref&gt; Jonson's mother married a master [[bricklayer]] two years later.&lt;ref name="Robert Chambers, Book of Days"&gt;Robert Chambers, Book of Days&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Ben Jonson", Encyclopædia Britannica, 15th Edition, pp. 611&lt;/ref&gt; Jonson attended school in [[St Martin's Lane]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Later, a family friend paid for his studies at [[Westminster School]], where the [[antiquarian]], historian, [[topographer]] and [[officer of arms]], [[William Camden]] (1551–1623) was one of his masters. In the event, the pupil and the master became friends, and the intellectual influence of Camden's broad-ranging scholarship upon Jonson's art and [[style (fiction)|literary style]] remained notable, until Camden's death in 1623.

On leaving Westminster School, Jonson was to have attended the [[University of Cambridge]], to continue his book learning but did not, because of his unwilled apprenticeship to his bricklayer stepfather.&lt;ref name="autogenerated388"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robert Chambers, Book of Days"/&gt; According to the churchman and historian [[Thomas Fuller]] (1608–61), Jonson at this time built a garden wall in [[Lincoln's Inn]]. After having been an apprentice bricklayer, Ben Jonson went to the [[Netherlands]] and volunteered to soldier with the English regiments of [[Francis Vere]] (1560–1609) in [[Flanders]].

The ''Hawthornden Manuscripts'' (1619), of the conversations between Ben Jonson and the poet [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]]&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; (1585–1649), report that, when in Flanders, Jonson engaged, fought and killed an enemy soldier in [[single combat]], and took for trophies the weapons of the vanquished soldier.&lt;ref name=Hawthornden&gt;{{Cite book |last=Drummond |first=William |year=1619 |title=Heads of a Conversation betwixt the Famous Poet Ben Johnson and William Drummond of Hawthornden, January 1619 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ubHPBcMk2OMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22William+Drummond%22+jonson&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=S0PASPT7GY-2iwGjjPTsDQ&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA43,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his military activity on the Continent, Jonson returned to England and worked as an actor and as a playwright. As an actor, Jonson was the protagonist “Hieronimo” (Geronimo) in the play ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'' (ca. 1586), by [[Thomas Kyd]] (1558–94), the first [[revenge tragedy]] in English literature. Moreover, by 1597, he was a working playwright employed by [[Philip Henslowe]], the leading producer for the English public theatre; by the next year, the production of ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' (1598) had established Jonson's reputation as a dramatist.&lt;ref&gt;"Ben Jonson", Encyclopædia Britannica, 15th Edition, p. 611&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Thomas Kyd", ''Grolier Encyclopedia of Knowledge'', volume 11, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding his marriage Jonson described his wife to William Drummond as "a shrew, yet honest". The identity of Jonson's wife has always been obscure, yet she sometimes is identified as "Ann Lewis", the woman who married a Benjamin Jonson in 1594, at the church of [[St Magnus-the-Martyr]], near [[London Bridge]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated612"&gt;"Ben Jonson", Encyclopædia Britannica, 15th Edition, p. 612.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning the family of Anne Lewis and Ben Jonson, the St. Martin's Church registers indicate that Mary Jonson, their eldest daughter, died in November 1593, at six months of age. Then a decade later, in 1603, Benjamin Jonson, their eldest son, died of [[Bubonic plague]] when he was seven years old; to lament and honour the dead boy, Benjamin Jonson ''père'' wrote the elegiac ''[[On My First Sonne]]'' (1603). Moreover, 32 years later, a second son, also named Benjamin Jonson, died in 1635. In that period, Ann Lewis and Ben Jonson lived separate lives for five years; their matrimonial arrangement cast Ann Lewis as the housewife Jonson, and Ben Jonson as the artist who enjoyed the residential hospitality of his patrons, Sir Robert Townshend and Lord Aubigny, [[Esme Stuart, 3rd Duke of Lennox]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated612"/&gt;

==Career==
By summer 1597, Jonson had a fixed engagement in the [[Admiral's Men]], then performing under [[Philip Henslowe]]'s management at [[The Rose (theatre)|The Rose]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; [[John Aubrey]] reports, on uncertain authority, that Jonson was not successful as an actor; whatever his skills as an actor, he was evidently more valuable to the company as a writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowers|first1=Fredson T.|title=Ben Jonson the Actor|journal=Studies in Philology|date=July 1937|volume=34|issue=3|pages=392–406|jstor=4172372|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time Jonson had begun to write original plays for the Admiral's Men; in 1598 he was mentioned by [[Francis Meres]] in his ''Palladis Tamia'' as one of "the best for tragedy."&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; None of his early tragedies survive, however. An undated comedy, ''[[The Case is Altered]]'', may be his earliest surviving play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miola|first=Robert S.|year=2012|title=The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Ben Jonson|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|chapter=The Case Is Altered, Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1597 a play which he co-wrote with [[Thomas Nashe]], ''[[The Isle of Dogs (play)|The Isle of Dogs]]'', was suppressed after causing great offence. Arrest warrants for Jonson and Nashe were issued by Queen [[Elizabeth I]]'s so-called interrogator, [[Richard Topcliffe]]. Jonson was jailed in [[Marshalsea Prison]] and charged with "Leude and mutynous behaviour", while Nashe managed to escape to [[Great Yarmouth]]. Two of the actors, [[Gabriel Spenser]] and Robert Shaw, were also imprisoned. A year later, Jonson was again briefly imprisoned, this time in [[Newgate Prison]], for killing Gabriel Spenser in a [[duel]] on 22 September 1598 in Hogsden Fields&lt;ref name=Hawthornden/&gt; (today part of [[Hoxton]]). Tried on a charge of [[manslaughter]], Jonson pleaded guilty but was released by [[benefit of clergy]],&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; a legal ploy through which he gained leniency by reciting a brief bible verse (the [[neck-verse]]), forfeiting his 'goods and chattels' and being branded on his left thumb.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; While in jail Jonson converted to Catholicism, possibly through the influence of fellow-prisoner Father [[Thomas Wright (writer)|Thomas Wright]], a [[Jesuit]] priest.&lt;ref name="ID2008"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Donaldson |first=Ian |year=2008 |title=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, England |chapter=Benjamin Jonson (1572–1637) |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/15116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1598 Jonson produced his first great success, ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'', capitalising on the vogue for humorous plays which [[George Chapman]] had begun with ''[[An Humorous Day's Mirth]]''. [[William Shakespeare]] was among the first actors to be cast. Jonson followed this in 1599 with ''[[Every Man out of His Humour]]'', a pedantic attempt to imitate [[Aristophanes]]. It is not known whether this was a success on stage, but when published it proved popular and went through several editions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Jonson's other work for the theatre in the last years of [[Elizabeth I]]'s reign was marked by fighting and controversy. ''[[Cynthia's Revels]]'' was produced by the [[Children of the Chapel]] Royal at [[Blackfriars Theatre]] in 1600. It satirised both [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]], who Jonson believed had accused him of lustfulness in ''[[Histriomastix (play)|Histriomastix]]'', and [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]]. Jonson attacked the two poets again in ''[[Poetaster (play)|Poetaster]]'' (1601). Dekker responded with ''[[Satiromastix]]'', subtitled "the untrussing of the humorous poet".&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The final scene of this play, whilst certainly not to be taken at face value as a portrait of Jonson, offers a caricature that is recognisable from Drummond's report – boasting about himself and condemning other poets, criticising performances of his plays and calling attention to himself in any available way.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

This "[[War of the Theatres]]" appears to have ended with reconciliation on all sides. Jonson collaborated with Dekker on a [[procession|pageant]] welcoming [[James I of England|James I]] to England in 1603 although Drummond reports that Jonson called Dekker a rogue. Marston dedicated ''The Malcontent'' to Jonson and the two collaborated with Chapman on ''[[Eastward Ho]]'', a 1605 play whose anti-Scottish sentiment briefly landed both Jonson and Chapman in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gossett|first1=Suzanne|title=Marston, Collaboration, and "Eastward Ho!"|journal=Renaissance Drama|date=2004|volume=33|pages=181–200|jstor=41917391|accessdate=|series=New series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal patronage==
At the beginning of the English reign of [[James VI and I]] in 1603 Jonson joined other poets and playwrights in welcoming the new king. Jonson quickly adapted himself to the additional demand for [[masque]]s and entertainments introduced with the new reign and fostered by both the king and his consort&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; [[Anne of Denmark]]. In addition to his popularity on the public stage and in the royal hall, he enjoyed the patronage of aristocrats such as [[Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland|Elizabeth Sidney]] (daughter of [[Philip Sidney|Sir Philip Sidney]]) and [[Lady Mary Wroth]]. This connection with the Sidney family provided the impetus for one of Jonson's most famous lyrics, the [[country house poems|country house poem]] ''To [[Penshurst Place|Penshurst]]''.

In February 1603 [[John Manningham]] reported that Jonson was living on Robert Townsend, son of [[Roger Townshend (died 1590)|Sir Roger Townshend]], and "scorns the world."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Harvnb|Donaldson|2011|p=428}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps this explains why his trouble with English authorities continued. That same year he was questioned by the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] about ''[[Sejanus His Fall|Sejanus]]'', a politically themed play about corruption in the Roman Empire. He was again in trouble for topical allusions in a play, now lost, in which he took part. Shortly after his release from a brief spell of imprisonment imposed to mark the authorities' displeasure at the work, in the second week of October 1605, he was present at a supper party attended by most of the [[Gunpowder Plot]] conspirators. After the plot's discovery he appears to have avoided further imprisonment; he volunteered what he knew of the affair to the investigator [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]] and the [[Privy Council]]. Father Thomas Wright, who heard Fawkes's confession, was known to Jonson from prison in 1598 and Cecil may have directed him to bring the priest before the council, as a witness.&lt;ref name="ID2008"/&gt; (Teague, 249).
[[File:Jonson 1616 folio Workes title page.jpg|200px|thumb|Title page of ''The Workes of Beniamin Ionson'' (1616), the first [[Folio (printing)|folio]] publication that included stage plays]]
At the same time, Jonson pursued a more prestigious career, writing masques for James's court. ''[[The Entertainment at Althorp|The Satyr]]'' (1603) and ''[[The Masque of Blackness]]'' (1605) are two of about two dozen masques which Jonson wrote for James or for Queen Anne, some of them performed at [[Apethorpe Palace]] when the King was in residence. ''The Masque of Blackness'' was praised by [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] as the consummate example of this now-extinct genre, which mingled speech, dancing and spectacle.

On many of these projects he collaborated, not always peacefully, with designer [[Inigo Jones]]. For example, Jones designed the scenery for Jonson's masque ''[[Oberon, the Faery Prince]]'' performed at [[Whitehall]] on 1 January 1611 in which [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Henry]], eldest son of James I, appeared in the title role. Perhaps partly as a result of this new career, Jonson gave up writing plays for the public theatres for a decade. He later told Drummond that he had made less than two hundred pounds on all his plays together.

In 1616 Jonson received a yearly pension of 100 [[Mark (money)|marks]] (about £60), leading some to identify him as England's first [[Poet Laureate]]. This sign of royal favour may have encouraged him to publish the first volume of the folio collected edition of his works that year.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Other volumes followed in 1640–41 and 1692. (See: [[Ben Jonson folios]])

On 8 July 1618 Jonson set out from Bishopsgate in London to walk to Edinburgh, arriving in Scotland's capital on 17 September. For the most part he followed the great north road, and was treated to lavish and enthusiastic welcomes in both towns and country houses.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/884139272|title=Ben Jonson's walk to Scotland : an annotated edition of the 'foot voyage'|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Loxley, James, 1968-, Groundwater, Anna,, Sanders, Julie, 1968-|year=|isbn=9781107003330|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|pages=94, 96|oclc=884139272}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his arrival he lodged initially with John Stuart, a cousin of King James, in Leith, and was made an honorary burgess of Edinburgh at a dinner laid on by the city on 26 September.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He stayed in Scotland until late January 1619, and the best-remembered hospitality he enjoyed was that of the Scottish poet, [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]],&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; sited on the [[River Esk, Lothian|River Esk]]. Drummond undertook to record as much of Jonson's conversation as he could in his diary, and thus recorded aspects of Jonson's personality that would otherwise have been less clearly seen. Jonson delivers his opinions, in Drummond's terse reporting, in an expansive and even magisterial mood. Drummond noted he was "a great lover and praiser of himself, a contemner and scorner of others".&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

On returning to England, he was awarded an [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] [[academic degree|degree]] from Oxford University.

The period between 1605 and 1620 may be viewed as Jonson's heyday. By 1616 he had produced all the plays on which his present reputation as a dramatist is based, including the tragedy ''[[Catiline His Conspiracy|Catiline]]'' (acted and printed 1611), which achieved limited success&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; and the comedies ''[[Volpone]]'' (acted 1605 and printed in 1607), ''[[Epicoene, or the Silent Woman]]'' (1609), ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'' (1610), ''[[Bartholomew Fayre: A Comedy|Bartholomew Fair]]'' (1614) and ''[[The Devil is an Ass]]'' (1616).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; ''The Alchemist'' and ''Volpone'' were immediately successful. Of ''Epicoene'', Jonson told Drummond of a satirical verse which reported that the play's subtitle was appropriate, since its audience had refused to applaud the play (i.e., remained silent). Yet ''Epicoene'', along with ''Bartholomew Fair'' and (to a lesser extent) ''The Devil is an Ass'' have in modern times achieved a certain degree of recognition. While his life during this period was apparently more settled than it had been in the 1590s, his financial security was still not assured.

==Religion==
Jonson recounted that his father had been a prosperous [[Protestant]] landowner until the reign of "[[Mary I of England|Bloody Mary]]" and had suffered imprisonment and the forfeiture of his wealth during that monarch's attempt to restore England to Catholicism. On [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]'s accession he was freed and was able to travel to London to become a clergyman.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson (2011: 56)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riggs (1989: 9)&lt;/ref&gt; (All that's known of Jonson's father, who died a month before his son was born, comes from the poet's own narrative.) Jonson's elementary education was in a small church school attached to [[St Martin-in-the-Fields#Medieval and Tudor|St Martin-in-the-Fields]] parish, and at the age of about seven he secured a place at [[Westminster School]], then part of [[Westminster Abbey]].

Notwithstanding this emphatically Protestant grounding, Jonson maintained an interest in Catholic doctrine throughout his adult life and, at a particularly perilous time while a religious war with Spain was widely expected and persecution of Catholics was intensifying, he converted to the faith.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson (2011: 176)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=R51&gt;Riggs (1989: 51–52)&lt;/ref&gt; This took place in October 1598, while Jonson was on remand in [[Newgate Prison|Newgate Gaol]] charged with manslaughter. Jonson's biographer Ian Donaldson is among those who suggest that the conversion was instigated by Father Thomas Wright, a [[Jesuit]] priest who had resigned from the order over his acceptance of Queen Elizabeth's right to rule in England.&lt;ref name=D134&gt;Donaldson (2011: 134–140)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harp; Stewart (2000: xiv)&lt;/ref&gt; Wright, although placed under [[house arrest]] on the orders of [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]], was permitted to minister to the inmates of London prisons.&lt;ref name="D134" /&gt; It may have been that Jonson, fearing that his trial would go against him, was seeking the unequivocal [[Absolution#Roman Catholic Church|
absolution]] that Catholicism could offer if he were sentenced to death.&lt;ref name="R51" /&gt; Alternatively, he could have been looking to personal advantage from accepting conversion since Father Wright's protector, the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]], was among those who might hope to rise to influence after the succession of a new monarch.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson (2011: 143)&lt;/ref&gt; Jonson's conversion came at a weighty time in affairs of state; the royal succession, from the childless Elizabeth, had not been settled and Essex's Catholic allies were hopeful that a sympathetic ruler might attain the throne.

Conviction, and certainly not expedience alone, sustained Jonson's faith during the troublesome twelve years he remained a Catholic. His stance received attention beyond the low-level intolerance to which most followers of that faith were exposed. The first draft of his play ''[[Sejanus His Fall|Sejanus]]'' was banned for "[[Papist|popery]]", and did not re-appear until some offending passages were cut.&lt;ref name="ID2008"/&gt; In January 1606 he (with Anne, his wife) appeared before the [[Consistory Court]] in London to answer a charge of [[recusancy]], with Jonson alone additionally accused of allowing his fame as a Catholic to "seduce" citizens to the cause.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson (2011: 229)&lt;/ref&gt; This was a serious matter (the [[Gunpowder Plot]] was still fresh in mind) but he explained that his failure to take [[Eucharist|communion]] was only because he had not found sound theological endorsement for the practice, and by paying a fine of thirteen shillings (65p) he escaped the more serious penalties at the authorities' disposal. His habit was to slip outside during the sacrament, a common routine at the time—indeed it was one followed by the royal consort, [[Anne of Denmark|Queen Anne]], herself—to show political loyalty while not offending the conscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Maxwell |first=Julie |year=2010 |editor=Sanders, Julie |title=Ben Jonson in context |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, England |isbn=978-0-521-89571-2 |page=231 |chapter=Religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading church figures, including [[John Overall (bishop)|John Overall]], [[Dean of St Paul's]], were tasked with winning Jonson back to Protestantism, but these overtures were resisted.&lt;ref name=D228&gt;Donaldson (2011: 228–9)&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1610 [[Henry IV of France]] was assassinated, purportedly in the name of the Pope; he had been a Catholic monarch respected in England for tolerance towards Protestants, and his murder seems to have been the immediate cause of Jonson's decision to rejoin the Church of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Walker |first=Anita |year=1995 |author2=Dickerman, Edmund |title=Mind of an Assassin: Ravaillac and the Murder of Henri IV of France |journal=Canadian Journal of History |location=Saskatoon, Saskatchewan |volume=30 |pages=201–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=D272&gt;Donaldson (2011: 272)&lt;/ref&gt; He did this in flamboyant style, pointedly drinking a full chalice of [[communion wine]] at the [[eucharist]] to demonstrate his renunciation of the Catholic rite, in which the priest alone drinks the wine.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Morrill (historian)|Jon Morrill]], quoted in Donaldson (2011: 487)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=R177&gt;Riggs (1989: 177)&lt;/ref&gt; The exact date of the ceremony is unknown.&lt;ref name=D272/&gt; However, his interest in Catholic belief and practice remained with him until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=van den Berg |first=Sara |editor=Harp, Richard |editor2=Stewart, Stanley |title=The Cambridge Companion to Ben Jonson |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, England |isbn=0-521-64678-2 |page=10 |chapter=True relation: the life and career of Ben Jonson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline and death==
Jonson's productivity began to decline in the 1620s, but he remained well known.  In that time, rose to the prominence the [[Sons of Ben (literary group)|Sons of Ben]] or the "[[Tribe of Ben]]" - those younger poets such as [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Robert Herrick]], [[Richard Lovelace]], and [[John Suckling (poet)|Sir John Suckling]] who took their bearing in verse from Jonson. However, a series of setbacks drained his strength and damaged his reputation. He resumed writing regular plays in the 1620s, but these are not considered among his best. They are of significant interest, however, for their portrayal of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s England. ''[[The Staple of News]]'', for example, offers a remarkable look at the earliest stage of English journalism. The lukewarm reception given that play was, however, nothing compared to the dismal failure of ''[[The New Inn]]''; the cold reception given this play prompted Jonson to write a poem condemning his audience (the ''Ode to Myself''), which in turn prompted [[Thomas Carew]], one of the "Tribe of Ben," to respond in a poem that asks Jonson to recognise his own decline.&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal factor in Jonson's partial eclipse was, however, the death of James and the accession of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] in 1625. Jonson felt neglected by the new court. A decisive quarrel with Jones harmed his career as a writer of court masques, although he continued to entertain the court on an irregular basis. For his part, Charles displayed a certain degree of care for the great poet of his father's day: he increased Jonson's annual pension to £100 and included a [[English units of wine casks#Tierce|tierce]] of wine and beer.

Despite the strokes that he suffered in the 1620s, Jonson continued to write. At his death in 1637 he seems to have been working on another play, ''The Sad Shepherd''. Though only two acts are extant, this represents a remarkable new direction for Jonson: a move into [[pastoral]] drama. During the early 1630s he also conducted a correspondence with [[James Howell]], who warned him about disfavour at court in the wake of his dispute with Jones.

Jonson died on or around 16 August 1637, and his funeral was held the next day. It was attended by 'all or the greatest part of the nobility then in town'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He is buried in the north aisle of the nave in [[Westminster Abbey]], with the inscription "O Rare Ben Johnson ''[sic]''" set in the slab over his grave.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;&lt;ref name=DCWA&gt;{{cite web |title=Monuments &amp; Gravestones: Ben Jonson |work=Westminster Abbey 1065 to today |publisher=Dean and Chapter of Westminster Abbey |url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/history-research/monuments-gravestones/people/12177 |accessdate=26 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107172342/http://www.westminster-abbey.org/history-research/monuments-gravestones/people/12177 |archivedate=7 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Aubrey]], in a more meticulous record than usual, notes that a passer-by, John Young of [[Great Milton]], [[Oxfordshire]], saw the bare grave marker and on impulse paid a workman eighteen pence to make the inscription. Another theory suggests that the tribute came from [[William Davenant]], Jonson's successor as Poet Laureate (and card-playing companion of Young), as the same phrase appears on Davenant's nearby gravestone, but essayist [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]] contends that Davenant's wording represented no more than Young's coinage, cheaply re-used.&lt;ref name=DCWA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hunt |first=Leigh |date=9 April 1828 |title=Life of Sir William Davenant, with specimens of his poetry |series=The Companion |volume=XIV |page=187 |chapter=His epitaph, and Ben Jonson's |oclc=2853686}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Jonson was buried in an upright position was an indication of his reduced circumstances at the time of his death,&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Quincy Adams|Adams, J.

It has been claimed that the inscription could be read "Orare Ben Jonson" (pray for Ben Jonson), possibly in an allusion to Jonson's acceptance of [[Roman Catholic theology|Catholic doctrine]] during his lifetime (although he had returned to the Church of England) but the carving shows a distinct space between  "O" and "rare".&lt;ref name="ID2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Stubbs |first=John |date=24 February 2011 |title=Reprobates |publisher=Viking Penguin |location=London |isbn=978-0-670-91753-2 |page=182 |quote=…a plea for the passerby's prayers (the Latin imperative ''orare'')…}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Fletcher |first=Angus |year=2007 |title=Time, space, and motion in the age of Shakespeare |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=978-0-674-02308-6 |page=95 |chapter=Structure of an epitaph |quote=At first sight the words seem clear enough…but some…have believed that the words intended to say, in Latin, "Pray for Ben Jonson"…}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A monument to Jonson was erected in about 1723 by the Earl of Oxford and is in the eastern aisle of Westminster Abbey's [[Poets' Corner]].

===Drama===
Apart from two tragedies, ''[[Sejanus (play)|Sejanus]]'' and ''[[Catiline: His Conspiracy|Catiline]]'', that largely failed to impress Renaissance audiences, Jonson's work for the public theatres was in comedy. These plays vary in some respects. The minor early plays, particularly those written for [[boy player]]s, present somewhat looser plots and less-developed characters than those written later, for adult companies. Already in the plays which were his salvos in the Poet's War, he displays the keen eye for absurdity and hypocrisy that marks his best-known plays; in these early efforts, however, plot mostly takes second place to variety of incident and comic set-pieces. They are, also, notably ill-tempered. [[Thomas Davies (bookseller)|Thomas Davies]] called ''Poetaster'' "a contemptible mixture of the serio-comic, where the names of [[Augustus Caesar]], [[Maecenas]], [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], [[Ovid]] and [[Tibullus]], are all sacrificed upon the altar of private resentment." Another early comedy in a different vein, ''[[The Case is Altered]]'', is markedly similar to Shakespeare's romantic comedies in its foreign setting, emphasis on genial wit and love-plot. Henslowe's diary indicates that Jonson had a hand in numerous other plays, including many in genres such as English history with which he is not otherwise associated.

The comedies of his middle career, from ''[[Eastward Ho]]'' to ''[[The Devil is an Ass]]'' are for the most part [[city comedy]], with a London setting, themes of trickery and money, and a distinct moral ambiguity, despite Jonson's professed aim in the Prologue to ''[[Volpone]]'' to "mix profit with your pleasure". His late plays or "[[dotages]]", particularly ''[[The Magnetic Lady]]'' and ''The Sad Shepherd'', exhibit signs of an accommodation with the romantic tendencies of [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan comedy]].

Within this general progression, however, Jonson's comic style remained constant and easily recognisable. He announces his programme in the prologue to the [[folio (printing)|folio]] version of ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'': he promises to represent "deeds, and language, such as men do use." He planned to write comedies that revived the classical premises of Elizabethan dramatic theory—or rather, since all but the loosest English comedies could claim some descent from [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]], he intended to apply those premises with rigour.&lt;ref&gt;Doran, 120ff&lt;/ref&gt; This commitment entailed negations: after ''The Case is Altered'', Jonson eschewed distant locations, noble characters, romantic plots and other staples of Elizabethan comedy, focusing instead on the satiric and realistic inheritance of [[new comedy]]. He set his plays in contemporary settings, peopled them with recognisable types, and set them to actions that, if not strictly realistic, involved everyday motives such as greed and [[jealousy]]. In accordance with the temper of his age, he was often so broad in his characterisation that many of his most famous scenes border on the [[farce|farcical]] (as [[William Congreve]], for example, judged ''Epicoene''.) He was more diligent in adhering to the [[classical unities]] than many of his peers—although as [[Margaret Cavendish]] noted, the unity of action in the major comedies was rather compromised by Jonson's abundance of incident. To this classical model Jonson applied the two features of his style which save his classical imitations from mere pedantry: the vividness with which he depicted the lives of his characters, and the intricacy of his plots. Coleridge, for instance, claimed that ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'' had one of the three most perfect plots in literature.

===Poetry===
[[File:Houghton MS Lowell Autograph File 185, Jonson.jpg|thumb|"Epitaph for Cecilia Bulstrode" manuscript, 1609]]
Jonson's poetry, like his drama, is informed by his classical learning. Some of his better-known poems are close translations of Greek or Roman models; all display the careful attention to form and style that often came naturally to those trained in classics in the [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] manner. Jonson largely avoided the debates about rhyme and meter that had consumed Elizabethan classicists such as [[Thomas Campion]] and [[Gabriel Harvey]]. Accepting both rhyme and stress, Jonson used them to mimic the classical qualities of simplicity, restraint and precision.

"Epigrams" (published in the 1616 folio) is an entry in a genre that was popular among late-Elizabethan and Jacobean audiences, although Jonson was perhaps the only poet of his time to work in its full classical range. The epigrams explore various attitudes, most from the satiric stock of the day: complaints against women, courtiers and spies abound. The condemnatory poems are short and anonymous; Jonson’s epigrams of praise, including a famous poem to Camden and lines to Lucy Harington, are longer and are mostly addressed to specific individuals. Although it is included among the epigrams, "[[On My First Sonne]]" is neither satirical nor very short; the poem, intensely personal and deeply felt, typifies a genre that would come to be called "lyric poetry." It is possible that the spelling of 'son' as 'Sonne' is meant to allude to the [[sonnet]] form, with which it shares some features. A few other so-called epigrams share this quality. Jonson's poems of "The Forest" also appeared in the first folio. Most of the fifteen poems are addressed to Jonson's aristocratic supporters, but the most famous are his country-house poem “[[To Penshurst]]” and the poem “[[To Celia]]” ("Come, my Celia, let us prove") that appears also in ''[[Volpone]]''.

''Underwood'', published in the expanded folio of 1640, is a larger and more heterogeneous group of poems. It contains ''[[A Celebration of Charis]]'', Jonson's most extended effort at love poetry; various religious pieces; [[Encomium|encomiastic poems]] including the poem to Shakespeare and a sonnet on [[Mary Wroth]]; the ''[[Execration against Vulcan]]'' and others. The 1640 volume also contains three elegies which have often been ascribed to Donne (one of them appeared in Donne's posthumous collected poems).

==Relationship with Shakespeare==
[[File:Shakespeare and Jonson at the Mermaid Tavern.jpg|thumb|A 19th century engraving illustrating [[Thomas Fuller]]'s story of [[Shakespeare]] and Jonson debating at the "[[Mermaid Tavern]]".]]

There are many legends about Jonson's rivalry with [[Shakespeare]], some of which may be true.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} Drummond reports that during their conversation, Jonson scoffed at two apparent absurdities in Shakespeare's plays: a nonsensical line in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', and the setting of ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'' on the non-existent seacoast of Bohemia. Drummond also reported Jonson as saying that Shakespeare "wanted art" (i.e., lacked skill). Whether Drummond is viewed as accurate or not, the comments fit well with Jonson's well-known theories about literature.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In [[s:On Shakespeare|"De Shakespeare Nostrat"]] in ''Timber'', which was published posthumously and reflects his lifetime of practical experience, Jonson offers a fuller and more conciliatory comment. He recalls being told by certain actors that Shakespeare never blotted (i.e., crossed out) a line when he wrote. His own claimed response was "Would he had blotted a thousand!"{{efn|Jonson's claim is interesting, since early printings of Shakespeare's work suggest that he tended to start a scene before giving up and trying again. His failure to cross the original attempts out left his printers unsure what needed to be deleted, though also allowed an insight into his creative process.}} However, Jonson explains, "He was, indeed, honest and of an open and free nature, had an excellent phantasy, brave notions and gentle expressions, wherein he flowed with that facility that sometimes it was necessary he should be stopped".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/dscv10h.htm#footnote11 Gutenberg.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Jonson concludes that "there was ever more in him to be praised than to be pardoned." Also when Shakespeare died, he said, "He was not of an age, but for all time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pogue |first1=Kate Emery |year=2006 |title=Shakespeare's Friends |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oy29eyCMNycC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=%22praised+than+to+be+pardoned%22+%22age+but+for+all+time%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22praised%20than%20to%20be%20pardoned%22%20%22age%20but%20for%20all%20time%22&amp;f=false |location=London |publisher=Praeger |page=99 |isbn=0275989569 |access-date=25 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Fuller]] relates stories of Jonson and Shakespeare engaging in debates in the [[Mermaid Tavern]]; Fuller imagines conversations in which Shakespeare would run rings around the more learned but more ponderous Jonson. That the two men knew each other personally is beyond doubt, not only because of the tone of Jonson's references to him but because Shakespeare's company produced a number of Jonson's plays, at least two of which (''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' and ''[[Sejanus His Fall]]'') Shakespeare certainly acted in. However, it is now impossible to tell how much personal communication they had, and tales of their friendship cannot be substantiated.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Jonson's most influential and revealing commentary on Shakespeare is the second of the two poems that he contributed to the prefatory verse that opens Shakespeare's [[First Folio]]. This poem, [[s:To the Memory of My Beloved the Author, Mr. William Shakespeare and What He Hath Left Us|"To the Memory of My Beloved the Author, Mr. William Shakespeare and What He Hath Left Us"]], did a good deal to create the traditional view of Shakespeare as a poet who, despite "small Latine, and lesse Greeke",&lt;ref&gt;W.T. Baldwin [https://web.archive.org/web/20060904145150/http://durer.press.uiuc.edu/baldwin/vol.1/html/2.html 's ''William Shakspere's Smalle Latine and Lesse Greeke'', 1944]&lt;/ref&gt; had a natural genius. The poem has traditionally been thought to exemplify the contrast which Jonson perceived between himself, the disciplined and erudite classicist, scornful of ignorance and sceptical of the masses, and Shakespeare, represented in the poem as a kind of natural wonder whose genius was not subject to any rules except those of the audiences for which he wrote. But the poem itself qualifies this view:
:Yet must I not give Nature all: Thy Art,
:My gentle Shakespeare, must enjoy a part.

Some view this elegy as a conventional exercise, but others see it as a heartfelt tribute to the "Sweet Swan of Avon", the "Soul of the Age!" It has been argued that Jonson helped to edit the [[First Folio]], and he may have been inspired to write this poem by reading his fellow playwright's works, a number of which had been previously either unpublished or available in less satisfactory versions, in a relatively complete form.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Reception and influence==
Jonson was a towering literary figure, and his influence was enormous for he has been described as 'One of the most vigorous minds that ever added to the strength of English literature'.&lt;ref&gt;Morley, Henry, Introduction to ''Discoveries Made Upon Men and Matter and Some Poems'' 1892 kindle ebook 2011 ASIN B004TOT8FQ&lt;/ref&gt; Before the English Civil War, the "Tribe of Ben" touted his importance, and during the Restoration Jonson's satirical comedies and his theory and practice of "humour characters" (which are often misunderstood; see William Congreve's letters for clarification) was extremely influential, providing the blueprint for many Restoration comedies. [[John Aubrey]] wrote of Jonson in "[[Brief Lives]]." By 1700 Jonson's status began to decline. In the Romantic era, Jonson suffered the fate of being unfairly compared and contrasted to Shakespeare, as the taste for Jonson's type of satirical comedy decreased. Jonson was at times greatly appreciated by the Romantics, but overall he was denigrated for not writing in a Shakespearean vein.

In 2012, after more than two decades of research, [[Cambridge University Press]] published the first new edition of Jonson's complete works for 60 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/9423214/Why-should-William-Shakespeare-have-the-last-word-over-Ben-Jonson.html|title=Why should William Shakespeare have the last word over Ben Jonson?|date=24 July 2012|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drama===
As G. E. Bentley notes in ''Shakespeare and Jonson: Their Reputations in the Seventeenth Century Compared'', Jonson's reputation was in some respects equal to Shakespeare's in the 17th century. After the English theatres were reopened on the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], Jonson's work, along with Shakespeare's and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|Fletcher]]'s, formed the initial core of the Restoration repertory. It was not until after 1710 that Shakespeare's plays (ordinarily in heavily revised forms) were more frequently performed than those of his Renaissance contemporaries. Many critics since the 18th century have ranked Jonson below only Shakespeare among [[English Renaissance theatre|English Renaissance dramatists]]. Critical judgment has tended to emphasise the very qualities that Jonson himself lauds in his prefaces, in ''Timber'', and in his scattered prefaces and dedications: the realism and propriety of his language, the bite of his satire, and the care with which he plotted his comedies.

For some critics, the temptation to contrast Jonson (representing art or craft) with Shakespeare (representing nature, or untutored genius) has seemed natural; Jonson himself may be said to have initiated this interpretation in the second folio, and [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]] drew the same comparison in his [[commonplace book]] later in the century.

At the Restoration, this sensed difference became a kind of critical dogma. [[Charles de Saint-Évremond]] placed Jonson's comedies above all else in English drama, and [[Charles Gildon]] called Jonson the father of English comedy. [[John Dryden]] offered a more common assessment in the "Essay of Dramatic Poesie," in which his [[Avatar]] Neander compares Shakespeare to [[Homer]] and Jonson to [[Virgil]]: the former represented profound creativity, the latter polished artifice. But "artifice" was in the 17th century almost synonymous with "art"; Jonson, for instance, used "artificer" as a synonym for "artist" (''Discoveries,'' 33). For [[Lewis Theobald]], too, Jonson "ow[ed] all his Excellence to his Art,” in contrast to Shakespeare, the natural genius. [[Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)|Nicholas Rowe]], to whom may be traced the legend that Jonson owed the production of ''Every Man in his Humour'' to Shakespeare's intercession, likewise attributed Jonson's excellence to learning, which did not raise him quite to the level of genius. A consensus formed: Jonson was the first English poet to understand classical precepts with any accuracy, and he was the first to apply those precepts successfully to contemporary life. But there were also more negative spins on Jonson's learned art; for instance, in the 1750s, [[Edward Young]] casually remarked on the way in which Jonson's learning worked, like Samson's strength, to his own detriment. Earlier, [[Aphra Behn]], writing in defence of female playwrights, had pointed to Jonson as a writer whose learning did not make him popular; unsurprisingly, she compares him unfavourably to Shakespeare. Particularly in the tragedies, with their lengthy speeches abstracted from [[Sallust]] and [[Cicero]], [[Augustan literature|Augustan]] critics saw a writer whose learning had swamped his [[aesthetic]] judgment.

In this period, [[Alexander Pope]] is exceptional in that he noted the tendency to exaggeration in these competing critical portraits: "It is ever the nature of Parties to be in extremes; and nothing is so probable, as that because Ben Johnson had much the most learning, it was said on the one hand that Shakespear had none at all; and because Shakespear had much the most wit and fancy, it was retorted on the other, that Johnson wanted both."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Pope, ed. ''Works of Shakespeare'' (London, 1725), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; For the most part, the 18th century consensus remained committed to the division that Pope doubted; as late as the 1750s, [[Sarah Fielding]] could put a brief recapitulation of this analysis in the mouth of a "man of sense" encountered by David Simple.

Though his stature declined during the 18th century, Jonson was still read and commented on throughout the century, generally in the kind of comparative and dismissive terms just described. [[Heinrich Wilhelm von Gerstenberg]] translated parts of [[Peter Whalley (clergyman)|Peter Whalley]]'s edition into German in 1765. Shortly before the Romantic revolution, [[Edward Capell]] offered an almost unqualified rejection of Jonson as a dramatic poet, who (he writes) "has very poor pretensions to the high place he holds among the English Bards, as there is no original manner to distinguish him and the tedious sameness visible in his plots indicates a defect of Genius."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Craig, D. H., ed. ''Jonson: The Critical Heritage'' (London: Routledge, 1995). p. 499&lt;/ref&gt; The disastrous failures of productions of ''Volpone'' and ''Epicoene'' in the early 1770s no doubt bolstered a widespread sense that Jonson had at last grown too antiquated for the contemporary public; if he still attracted enthusiasts such as [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Earl Camden]] and [[William Gifford]], he all but disappeared from the stage in the last quarter of the century.

The [[Romanticism|romantic]] revolution in criticism brought about an overall decline in the critical estimation of Jonson. Hazlitt refers dismissively to Jonson's "laborious caution." Coleridge, while more respectful, describes Jonson as psychologically superficial: “He was a very accurately observing man; but he cared only to observe what was open to, and likely to impress, the senses.” Coleridge placed Jonson second only to Shakespeare; other romantic critics were less approving. The early 19th century was the great age for recovering Renaissance drama. Jonson, whose reputation had survived, appears to have been less interesting to some readers than writers such as [[Thomas Middleton]] or [[John Heywood]], who were in some senses "discoveries" of the 19th century. Moreover, the emphasis which the romantic writers placed on imagination, and their concomitant tendency to distrust studied art, lowered Jonson's status, if it also sharpened their awareness of the difference traditionally noted between Jonson and Shakespeare. This trend was by no means universal, however; [[William Gifford]], Jonson's first editor of the 19th century, did a great deal to defend Jonson's reputation during this period of general decline. In the next era, [[Algernon Charles Swinburne|Swinburne]], who was more interested in Jonson than most [[Victorians]], wrote, "The flowers of his growing have every quality but one which belongs to the rarest and finest among flowers: they have colour, form, variety, fertility, vigour: the one thing they want is fragrance” – by “fragrance,” Swinburne means spontaneity.

In the 20th century, Jonson’s body of work has been subject to a more varied set of analyses, broadly consistent with the interests and programmes of modern literary criticism. In an essay printed in ''The Sacred Wood'', [[T. S. Eliot]] attempted to repudiate the charge that Jonson was an arid classicist by analysing the role of imagination in his dialogue. Eliot was appreciative of Jonson's overall conception and his "surface", a view consonant with the modernist reaction against Romantic criticism, which tended to denigrate playwrights who did not concentrate on representations of psychological depth. Around mid-century, a number of critics and scholars followed Eliot's lead, producing detailed studies of Jonson's verbal style. At the same time, study of Elizabethan themes and conventions, such as those by [[E. E. Stoll]] and [[M. C. Bradbrook]], provided a more vivid sense of how Jonson's work was shaped by the expectations of his time.

The proliferation of new critical perspectives after mid-century touched on Jonson inconsistently. Jonas Barish was the leading figure among critics who appreciated Jonson's artistry. On the other hand, Jonson received less attention from the new critics than did some other playwrights and his work was not of programmatic interest to psychoanalytic critics. But Jonson's career eventually made him a focal point for the revived [[New Historicism|sociopolitical criticism]]. Jonson's works, particularly his masques and pageants, offer significant information regarding the relations of literary production and political power, as do his contacts with and poems for aristocratic patrons; moreover, his career at the centre of London's emerging literary world has been seen as exemplifying the development of a fully commodified literary culture. In this respect he is seen as a transitional figure, an author whose skills and ambition led him to a leading role both in the declining culture of [[patronage]] and in the rising culture of mass consumption.

===Poetry===
Jonson has been called 'the first poet laureate'.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Michael, ''Lives of the Poets'', Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson 1998 {{ISBN|9780753807453}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Jonson's reputation as a playwright has traditionally been linked to Shakespeare, his reputation as a poet has, since the early 20th century, been linked to that of [[John Donne]]. In this comparison, Jonson represents the [[Cavalier poet|cavalier]] strain of poetry, emphasising grace and clarity of expression; Donne, by contrast, epitomised the [[Metaphysical poets|metaphysical]] school of poetry, with its reliance on strained, [[baroque]] metaphors and often vague phrasing. Since the critics who made this comparison ([[Herbert Grierson]] for example), were to varying extents rediscovering Donne, this comparison often worked to the detriment of Jonson's reputation.

In his time Jonson was at least as influential as Donne. In 1623, historian [[Edmund Bolton]] named him the best and most polished English poet. That this judgment was widely shared is indicated by the admitted influence he had on younger poets. The grounds for describing Jonson as the "father" of cavalier poets are clear: many of the cavalier poets described themselves as his "sons" or his "tribe". For some of this tribe, the connection was as much social as poetic; [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Herrick]] described meetings at "the Sun, the Dog, the Triple Tunne".&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; All of them, including those like Herrick whose accomplishments in verse are generally regarded as superior to Jonson's, took inspiration from Jonson's revival of classical forms and themes, his subtle melodies, and his disciplined use of [[wit]]. In these respects Jonson may be regarded as among the most important figures in the prehistory of English [[Augustan literature|neoclassicism]].

The best of Jonson's lyrics have remained current since his time; periodically, they experience a brief vogue, as after the publication of Peter Whalley's edition of 1756. Jonson's poetry continues to interest scholars for the light which it sheds on English literary history, such as politics, systems of patronage and intellectual attitudes. For the general reader, Jonson's reputation rests on a few lyrics that, though brief, are surpassed for grace and precision by very few Renaissance poems: "[[On My First Sonne]]"; "[[To Celia]]"; "[[To Penshurst]]"; and the [[epitaph]] on Salomon Pavy, a [[boy player]]  abducted from his parents who acted in Jonson's plays.

It is in Jonson's ''Timber, or Discoveries...'' that he famously quipped on the manner in which language became a measure of the speaker or writer:

{{quote|Language most shows a man: Speak, that I may see thee. It springs out of the most retired and inmost parts of us, and is the image of the parent of it, the mind. No glass renders a man’s form or likeness so true as his speech. Nay, it is likened to a man; and as we consider feature and composition in a man, so words in language; in the greatness, aptness, sound structure, and harmony of it.|Ben Jonson, 1640 (posthumous)&lt;ref&gt;Jonson, B., "Discoveries and Some Poems," Cassell &amp; Company, 1892.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As with other English Renaissance dramatists, a portion of Ben Jonson's literary output has not survived. In addition to ''[[The Isle of Dogs (play)|The Isle of Dogs]]'' (1597), the records suggest these lost plays as wholly or partially Jonson's work: ''Richard Crookback'' (1602); ''Hot Anger Soon Cold'' (1598), with Porter and [[Henry Chettle]]; ''Page of Plymouth'' (1599), with Dekker; and ''Robert II, King of Scots'' (1599), with Chettle and Dekker. Several of Jonson's masques and entertainments also are not extant: ''The Entertainment at Merchant Taylors'' (1607); ''The Entertainment at Salisbury House for James I'' (1608); and ''The May Lord'' (1613–19).

Finally, there are questionable or borderline attributions. Jonson may have had a hand in ''[[Rollo Duke of Normandy|Rollo, Duke of Normandy, or The Bloody Brother]]'', a play in the canon of John Fletcher and his collaborators. The comedy ''[[The Widow (play)|The Widow]]'' was printed in 1652 as the work of [[Thomas Middleton]], Fletcher and Jonson, though scholars have been intensely sceptical about Jonson's presence in the play. A few attributions of anonymous plays, such as ''[[The London Prodigal]]'', have been ventured by individual researchers, but have met with cool responses.&lt;ref&gt;Logan and Smith, pp. 82–92&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CaricaturePB.jpg|right|thumb|Cover of the 2002 paperback edition of ''Caricature'']]
'''''Caricature''''' is a book collection of nine [[Comics|comic]] [[Short story|short stories]] by [[Daniel Clowes]]. In contrast to earlier Clowes collections such as ''Lout Rampage!'' and ''Orgy Bound'', ''Caricature'' concentrates on the more naturalistic, character-focused side of Clowes's output displayed in ''[[Ghost World]]''. It includes some of his most admired short stories, including "Immortal, Invisible", "Gynecology" and the title story. All the material in the collection originally appeared in Clowes's [[comic book]] ''[[Eightball (comic book)|Eightball]]'' with the exception of "Green Eyeliner", which was published in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]''.

''Caricature'' was first published by [[Fantagraphics Books]] in 1998 in a deluxe [[hardcover]] edition. A less expensive [[paperback]] version was released in 2002. Both editions contain a mixture of [[Color printing|full-color]] and [[black-and-white]] material.

'''Carminow Cross''' is a stone [[Celtic cross]] near a major road junction southeast of [[Bodmin]] in mid-[[Cornwall]], England. Immediately to the north is Castle Canyke, an [[Hillfort|Iron Age fort]].&lt;ref&gt;Ordnance Survey ''One-inch Map of Great Britain; Bodmin and Launceston, sheet 186''. 1961&lt;/ref&gt; The cross is a Grade II* [[listed building]].&lt;ref name="NHLE"&gt;{{National Heritage List for England| num=1298242 |desc=Stone Cross at SX 088 656, Carminow |grade=II* |accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century and early 20th century the cross was half hidden in a hedge at the back of some cottages which then formed the hamlet of Carminow Cross. A. G. Langdon conjectured that its original position was at the crossroads, before it was moved into the hedge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Langdon |first=Arthur G. |date=1896 |title=Old Cornish Crosses |location=Truro |publisher=J. Pollard |pages=311-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When road widening was undertaken in the mid-20th century it was moved to its present position surrounded by grass verge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7992">'''Clocktower Productions''' is a non-profit art institution working in the visual arts, performance, music, and radio. It was founded in 1972 as The Clocktower Gallery by [[Alanna Heiss]], the Founder and former Director of [[MoMA PS1]] (formerly P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center) under the aegis of the Institute for Art and Urban Resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperallergic.com/55653/112-greene-street-the-soho-that-used-to-be/|title= 112 Greene Street: The Soho that Used to Be|publisher=Hyperallergic| author=Frances Richard |date=August 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.booksandideas.net/The-Rise-and-Fall-of-Alternative.html|title= The Rise and Fall of Alternative Spaces|publisher=books and ideas| author=Cristelle Terroni |date=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1972 until 2013, the institution operated out of a City-owned McKim, Mead &amp; White building in Lower Manhattan, the [[former New York Life Insurance Company Building]].

In 2013, the City of New York sold the building to a private developer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.downtownexpress.com/2013/12/04/clock-strikes-midnight-on-downtown-art-gallery/ | title= Clock strikes midnight on Downtown art gallery | publisher=Downtown Express | author=Sam Spokony | date= December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the organization relocated its operations through program partnerships with other arts institutions around the city, including [[Pioneer Works]] in Red Hook, Knockdown Center in Queens, and Times Square Arts, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.interviewmagazine.com/art/alanna-heiss-clocktower/#_ | title= Alanna Heiss, On The Horizon | publisher=Interview Magazine | author=Rachel Small | date= December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://observer.com/2013/10/clocktower-gallery-will-leave-namesake-space-next-month/ | title= Clocktower Gallery Will Leave Namesake Space Next Month | publisher= New York Observer | author=Zoë Lescaze | date=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Clocktower Productions is the organization formerly known as The Clocktower Gallery and ARTonAIR.org. Opening in 1972 with inaugural shows by [[Joel Shapiro]], [[Richard Tuttle]], and [[James Bishop (artist)|James Bishop]], the Clocktower presented work in the visual arts, performance, and music by artists including [[Gordon Matta-Clark]], [[Lynda Benglis]], [[Max Neuhaus]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]], [[Richard Artschwager]], [[Pat Steir]], [[Vito Acconci]], [[Michelangelo Pistoletto]], [[Charlotte Moorman]], [[Laurie Anderson]], and [[Marina Abramović]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/19/fashion/the-spirit-of-youth-circa-1970-new-york.html | title= The Spirit of Youth, Circa 1970 New York | publisher=New York Times| author= Bob Morris |date= January 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[September 11, 2001]], security procedures in the organization’s City-owned building suspended ongoing activity and exhibitions in the Clocktower. From 2004 until 2008, the Clocktower space operated as a satellite of P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center (now MoMA PS1), housing the headquarters of Art Radio WPS1.org, the museum’s all-art Web-based radio station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/23/arts/art-radio-free-tribeca.html | title= ART; Radio Free TriBeCa | publisher=New York Times | author= Phoebe Hoban | date= May 23, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2004-04-20/nyc-life/adieu-bonjour/ | title= Adieu, Bonjour | publisher=New York Village Voice| author= Tricia Romano | date=April 20, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, Alanna Heiss left P.S.1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://artdaily.com/news/28098/P-S-1-Contemporary-Art-Center-Founder-and-Director-Alanna-Heiss-to-Retire#.VE7y6efdBU8 | title= P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center Founder and Director Alanna Heiss to Retire | publisher=New York artdaily.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to the Clocktower Gallery in order to run the radio station full-time, renaming the organization AIR, Art International Radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://bombmagazine.org/article/4222/image-not-available-can-alanna-heiss-bring-art-to-the-airwaves | title= Image Not Available: Can Alanna Heiss Bring Art to the Airwaves? | publisher=New York artdaily.org | author=Jed Lipinski | date= June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, installations and artworks commissioned by AIR went on view in the Clocktower’s galleries and project spaces. Works by [[Tony Oursler]], [[Todd Eberle]], [[Mary Heilmann]] and Sabina Streeter reinaugurated the Clocktower Gallery's exhibition program.&lt;ref name="art:21, August 17, 2009"&gt;http://blog.art21.org/2009/08/17/weekly-roundup-15/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14134">'''Contemporary Ukrainian literature''' is a notion referred to [[Ukrainian literature]] of the past several decades. Most often 1991 as a year of Ukrainian independence is considered as a start of the contemporary Ukrainian literature as from that year on the literary censorship of the [[Soviet Union]] ceased to exist and writers were able to deviate from the official [[socialist realism]] style. Principal changes took place in Ukrainian literature already in the years of [[Perestroika]] (1985) and especially after the [[Chernobyl disaster]]. Some researchers consider that contemporary Ukrainian literature started from the 1970-s after the generation of the [[sixtiers]].

Due to the increased freedom and openness of the Ukrainian society to foreign influences and much broader contacts with literatures of other countries contemporary Ukrainian literature is different from the literature of soviet and classical period. It turns to the previously forbidden topics ([[Holodomor]], sexuality, drugs, deviant behavior, etc.), using new styles ([[postmodernism]], neo avant-garde, profanity and [[surzhyk]]), diversity and mixing of genres, shocking effects and reflecting upon social problems and historical memory.

Modern Ukraine also has a significant number of [[Russian language in Ukraine|Russophone writers]], who are especially successful in the genres of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]].&lt;ref name="pentacle"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Oldie |first1=H.L. |last2=Dyachenko |first2=Marina and Sergey |last3=Valentinov |first3=Andrey|year=2005 |script-title=ru:Пять авторов в поисках ответа (послесловие к роману "Пентакль") |trans-title=Five authors in search for answers (an afterword to Pentacle) |language= Russian|location=Moscow |publisher=Eksmo |isbn=5-699-09313-3 |quote=Украиноязычная фантастика переживает сейчас не лучшие дни. ...

== History ==
[[File:Oksana Zabuzhko.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Oksana Zabuzhko]].]]
During the later [[USSR]] some Ukrainian writers started to deviate from the officially approved literary style of [[socialist realism]]. Among these writers were [[Valeriy Shevchuk]] with his psychological prose and the authors of "chymeric prose" ([[Vasyl Zemlyak]] and [[Volodymyr Drozd]]) similar to [[magical realism]]. There existed also underground literary circles like the [[Kyiv school of poetry]] ([[Vasyl Holoborodko]], [[Mykola Vorobyov]], [[Viktor Kordun]], [[Mykhaylo Hryhoriv]]), a circle of Lviv writers around the samizdat "Skrynya" almanac ([[Hryhoriy Chubay]], [[Oleh Lysheha]], [[Mykola Riabchuk]], [[Viktor Morozov]], [[Roman Kis]], [[Orest Yavorskyi]]), separate dissident writers like [[Ihor Kalynets]]. Authors belonging to ''Kyiv ironic school'' ([[Volodymr Dibrova]], [[Bohdan Zholdak]], [[Les Podervianskyi]]) are considered to be the forefathers of Ukrainian postmodernism. Contemporary Ukrainian literature was also influenced by the ''New York group'' of Ukraininan emigre writers, who separated politics from their art in contrast to the politically active [[sixtiers]] writers in soviet Ukraine. On the background of stronger censorship and repression in the times of [[Brezhnev]] many writers in Ukraine since 1970-s distanced themselves into inner immigration making their literature self-sufficient.

With advent of [[Perestroika]] the censorship pressure on writers decreased. This allowed them to turn to previously prohibited styles and themes. The populist canon of social realism was revised, the works of the "Shot renaissance" modernist generation of 1920-s, [[Ukrainian diaspora|diaspora]] and underground writers were printed.

The role of a writer in the society was revised. A writer in soviet Ukraine played a specially important social function, which new postmodernist writers (especially the [[Bu-Ba-Bu]] group of poets including [[Yuri Andrukhovych]], [[Viktor Neborak]] and [[Oleksandr Irvanets]]) tried to debunk.

Some of the centers of new Ukrainian literature were situated away from the republican capital of Kyiv. ''Stanislav phenomenon'' emerged in [[Ivano-Frankivsk]] and included a group of eminent writers like [[Yuri Andrukhovych]], [[Yuriy Izdryk]], [[Taras Prokhasko]], [[Halyna Petrosanyak]] and [[Mariya Makytsey]].

[[Mykola Riabchuk]] was an influential figure in Ukrainian literature in the end of 1980-s and beginning of 1990-s. He edited "Suchasnist", the most influential literary journal at that period. Thanks to Riabchuk many still to become famous writers were first published.

After the collapse of the USSR Ukraine faced a decade of substantial social changes. A free book marked had to replace the state-financed soviet publishing system and the support of writers loyal to the regime.

[[File:Yuri Andruchovych by Kubik.JPG|thumb|right|150px|[[Yuri Andrukhovych]]]]
Modernist tradition in Ukrainian literature was raptured by extermination of many Ukraininan writers in 1930-es. A Soviet period of considerable cultural isolation followed. This led to the fact some contemporary Ukrainian authors write in classical, modernist or postmodernist styles coming in terms with the historic gap each on their own terms.

Many works of contemporary writers are concentrated on darker sides of human life, violence and crisis. This came about as a reaction to the false and compulsory optimism of the official socialist realist literature.

There are numerous literary festivals in Ukraine, most important are the Lviv international literary festival, [[Meridian Czernowitz]] and Kyivski lavry.

Some Ukrainian authors write in a mixture of Ukrainian and Russian called [[surzhyk]] ([[Bohdan Zholdak]], [[Les Podervianskyi]], [[Volodymyr Dibrova]], [[Myhaylo Brynyh]]) using it to create a comic effect as this is the language of the marginalized.

A number of writers of Ukraine write in Russian language. [[Andriy Kurkov]] is the best known of them. Also a great number of contemporary Russian science fiction writers originally come from Ukraine or still live there ([[H. L. Oldie]], [[Alexander Zorich]], [[Yuri Nikitin (author)|Yuri Nikitin]], [[Andrey Valentinov]], [[Marina and Sergey Dyachenko]] and [[Vladimir Arenev]]).

[[File:Court Theatre - the shed.JPG|thumb|The current premises in [[Addington, New Zealand|Addington]]]]
The '''Court Theatre''' is a professional theatre company based in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand. It was founded in 1971 and located in the [[Christchurch Arts Centre]] from 1976 until the February [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]]. It opened new premises in [[Addington, New Zealand|Addington]] in December 2011.  It is currently New Zealand's largest theatre company and is led by CEO, [[Philip Aldridge]] and artistic director Ross Gumbley.

== History ==

===Founding and early years===
[[File:Canterbury Provincial Council Stone Chamber.jpg|thumb|Stone Chamber of the [[Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings|Canterbury Provincial Council]]]]
The company was founded by Yvette Bromley {{post-nominals|country=NZL|QSM}} and [[Mervyn Thompson]] in 1971 who served as Co-artistic Directors for the first three years of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.courttheatre.org.nz/index.cfm/1,9,html/About-Us | title=Christchurch's Theatre | publisher=Court Theatre | location=Christchurch | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724101856/http://www.courttheatre.org.nz/index.cfm/1%2C9%2Chtml/About-Us | archive-date=24 July 2011 | deadurl=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bromley chose the theatre's name out of affection for the [[Royal Court Theatre]] in [[London]], which she knew well from her upbringing and drama education.&lt;ref name="ties to landmark" /&gt;

During the first eighteen months of its existence, The Court had three venues. The first was ''The Stone Chamber of the [[Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings|Canterbury Provincial Council Chambers]]'' (April – May 1971), where The Court's début production, ''The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie'' was staged.&lt;ref name="ties to landmark"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Crean |first1=Mike |title=Reliving Court's ties to landmark |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/5833594/Reliving-Courts-ties-to-landmark |accessdate=15 August 2015 |work=[[The Press]] |date=22 October 2011 |page=C7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally the [[Māori Land Court]] would require the use of the chamber, necessitating the set being struck and taken to the Durham Street Art Gallery; the furniture being moved back into the chamber and the processed reversed for the next evening's performance. The Stone Chamber was one of the city's most magnificent structures, but it was impractical for a theatre company, as there was little room for an audience and a lack of toilets.&lt;ref name="ties to landmark" /&gt;

Next was the ''Durham Street Art Gallery'' (June 1971 – May 1972), which was used as an interim venue between the Canterbury Society of Arts vacating the premises and the Law Court expanding into the area.&lt;ref name="ties to landmark" /&gt; From June to August 1972, The Court was housed in the ''Beggs Theatrette'' and staged two productions in the space.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The next four years (September 1972 – February 1976) were a period of relative stability. The Court Theatre was housed at The Orange Hall on Worcester Street. In 1974, Mervyn Thompson stood down leaving Yvette Bromley as sole Artistic Director until 1975 when Randall Wackrow (who had joined the company as Business Manager in 1973) joined her as Co-artistic Director.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===The Arts Centre===
[[File:Court Theatre, Christchurch (Arts Centre).jpg|thumb|The Court Theatre at the [[Christchurch Arts Centre]]]]
In 1976, the company moved to the [[Christchurch Arts Centre]] complex, in the buildings which were formerly the Engineering School of [[Canterbury College, Christchurch|Canterbury College]]. The performance space was previously lecture room D.&lt;ref name="ties to landmark" /&gt;

From 1977 to 1978, Randall Wackrow served as sole Artistic Director, standing down in 1979 with the appointment of Elric Hooper.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Hooper served as Artistic Director for more than two decades.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Hooper declared his intent to balance the theatre's repertoire with "three main thrusts — the classic, the contemporary and the indigenous".  Although economic pressure saw a fledgling second auditorium, ''Court Two'', closed as a regular venue following the economic slump of the mid-eighties (although it was to be later revived as ''The Forge''), overall this philosophy was rewarded.

As the new millennium approached, The Court saw growth across the board — in audiences, income and acclaim, and expanded its company with the introduction of [[Theatresports]] to [[Australasia]] in the late 1980s and the formation of professional improvisation troupe, [[Court Jesters|The Court Jesters]].{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} In 1990, Hooper was awarded the [[MBE]] and the 1990 Commemoration medal by the [[Queen Elizabeth II|Queen]].{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Hooper retired as Artistic Director in 1999 and Catherine Downes served as Artistic Director of The Court Theatre from 2000–2005.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Ross Gumbley has been The Court's Artistic Director from 2006.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

== Arts Centre premises ==
The Court operated two auditoria at the Arts Centre. Court One seated 291 in a broad 'semi-thrust' stage, staging at least eight productions each season totalling approximately 270 performances annually. Each season contained a mix of New Zealand works, modern international theatre and classics.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The Forge (formerly known as Court Two) seated 123 in a 'box' setting with the audience seated on two sides. Until recently it was used as a hosting venue by touring or independent productions, but since 2007 The Forge was used by the Court for staging challenging international, local and devised works, with an aim of attracting a different audience demographic from its Court One patronage.

== Current role and activities ==
The Court Theatre employs professionals from around the country and internationally. It sustains a full-time professional staff and an ensemble acting company and is administered by The Court Theatre Trust. At any one time there can be up to 100 people working full-time at The Court Theatre.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In addition to being a full-time professional theatre company, The Court Theatre operates numerous other activities in the community. The company annually tours a show regionally around the [[South Island]]. Its education programme provides training for school-age students and adults, regularly liaising with high school and tertiary institutions as well as other community groups. The company also produces school holiday kids' shows and an annual touring primary school show.

Furthermore, the company employs a troupe of professional improvisors and corporate entertainers, The [[Court Jesters]]. The most public face of their work is the [[improv comedy]] show "Scared Scriptless" which is staged every Friday and Saturday night at The Court Theatre.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10410">'''Creative peacebuilding''' is the larger name for artist approaches to [[peacebuilding]] within individuals, groups, and societies. It includes various forms of [[art therapy]], whereby individuals and groups can express themselves to nurture healing and restoration. It is also used to overcome the recurrence of [[violence]], as a preventative measure to make the foundations of peace stronger, especially in contexts of war and conflict. Creating an environment of lasting peace is the primary goal of creative peacebuilding.

== War and conflict ==
According to [[Johan Galtung]], peacebuilding is the process of creating self-supporting structures that "remove causes of wars and offer alternatives to war in situations where wars might occur."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.allianceforpeacebuilding.org/2013/08/selected-definitions-of-peacebuilding/|title=Selected Definitions of Peacebuilding|work=Alliance for Peacebuilding|access-date=10 November 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[John Paul Lederach]], peacebuilding is a comprehensive concept that encompasses, generates, and sustains the full array of processes, approaches, and stages needed to transform conflict toward more sustainable, peaceful relationships, which involves a wide range of activities. It has a diverse range of interaction and involves various stakeholders in various levels within the spectrum of governance and development.&lt;ref name="Lederach2010"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UL8VDAAAQBAJ|title=The Moral Imagination: The Art and Soul of Building Peace|last=Lederach|first=John Paul|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-19-974758-0|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creative peacebuilding facilitates the establishments of sustainable peace by preventing recurrence of violence, addresses the root causes, healing and effects of conflict, and offer alternatives to violence through reconciliation, economic and social transformation with the use of photography, film, painting, and the like. [[Jolyon Mitchell]] argues that the visual arts can both encourage peacebuilding and instigating violence. This is true of various forms of visual arts, ranging from posters, cartoons, and stained glass, to websites, radio, and films by reflecting on examples from around the world.&lt;ref name="Mitchell2012"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jLGcNb1_H1YC|title=Promoting Peace, Inciting Violence: The Role of Religion and Media|last=Mitchell|first=Jolyon P.|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0-415-55746-7|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creative peacebuilding can be especially powerful when used with those suffering from a young demographic and those with [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]]. For at-risk youth, it lays the roots for a peaceful lifestyle and to help children who have already experienced trauma in their lives become fully functional adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ishaq|first=Ashfaq|date=December 2006|title=Development of children’s creativity to foster peace|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(06)69915-7/abstract|journal=The Lancet|volume=368|pages=26–27|via=|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(06)69915-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art therapy==
Art therapy has been used to help rehabilitate [[child soldiers]] in [[Uganda]] as well as to help children who lost their homes in the [[tsunami]] of 2004 cope with their feelings. Many youth centers catering to impoverished children use art forms to build community, discipline and trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prutzman|first=Priscilla|date=October 1981|title=Children's Creative Response to Conflict|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0130.1981.tb00454.x|journal=Peace and Change|volume=7|issue=4|pages=77–79|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0130.1981.tb00454.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
[[Music therapy]] can be used in several different fashions to build peace. It can be used to help individuals express themselves or to foster communication between individuals or groups of people. It can be used to nurture healing and reconciliation. Music is something that transcends language and national or ethnic boundaries. It has unique styles depending on the community it originates in and can also be adapted to fit individual's tastes. When two groups who have been in conflict or have the potential for conflict make music together communication and healing become possible. When individuals listen to or play music, they can reduce their [[stress (biology)|stress]] levels and express their feelings.&lt;ref name="Sutton2002"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Z3jtH_qeIIC|title=Music, Music Therapy and Trauma: International Perspectives|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|year=2002|isbn=978-1-84310-027-0|editor-last=Sutton|editor-first=Julie P.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual arts ===
Visual art therapy can be used to help individuals cope with their feelings resulting from violent experiences. It is also used to treat [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. Art therapy is especially useful for people who are having trouble verbalizing their feelings and are keeping them bottled up. By sharing their experiences and processing them through a tactical and visual activity, people are able to heal. No prior experience with visual art is needed to participate in and gain benefits from art therapy—it is about the process of creation, not about the aesthetic appeal of the product. Art therapy can be used in group settings as well—creating a collaborative art project can be an experience that bridges differences between people and builds feelings of trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Avrahami|first=Dalia|date=2006|title=Visual Art Therapy's Unique Contribution in the Treatment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J229v06n04_02|journal=Journal of Trauma &amp; Dissociation|volume=6|issue=4|pages=5–38|doi=10.1300/j229v06n04_02|issn=1529-9732|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visualization and technology ===
If people who have lived through traumatic or violent experiences can relive them and change the situation or their response to the situation they can come to terms with their past. Virtual technology and especially [[virtual reality]] simulations can be especially useful in cases like these and have been used to treat veterans of [[Iraq War|the Iraq war]] who are suffering from [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]]. If the technology needed for these simulations is too expensive to be practical, mental [[Creative visualization|visualization]], in which the victim uses their imagination to create situations and feel as if they are gaining control of the way events play out, can be used as an alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/world/iraq/2007-06-18-iraq-virtual-reality_n.htm|title=Iraq vets use virtual reality to ease post-battle trauma|last=Jones|first=Brent|date=18 June 2007|website=www.usatoday.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Create Peace Project===
Create Peace Project is an arts-for-peace education organization working to promote the practices of peace and spread the message of hope and goodwill to children around the world using creativity. Create Peace Project was founded in San Francisco, California in 2007 by artist and peace activist Ross Holzman in response to the overwhelming amount of violence in the world, on the news, and in our communities. Violence, coupled with the lack of creativity in peoples lives sparked the creation of projects such as Banners for Peace and The Peace Exchange. Create Peace Project has included more than 25,000 children from around the world in its arts-for-peace projects since its inception and continues to work with schools in the US and beyond promoting peace through creativity to children of all ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.createpeaceproject.org|title=Create Peace Project|last=Holzman|first=Ross|date=8 May 2008|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barefoot artists===
Artist [[Lily Yeh]] has helped to heal the wounds [[genocide]] left on a village of widows and orphans through her work with Barefoot Artists. The members of the community were provided with a chance to honor their lost loved ones through their construction of a beautiful and expressive monument commemorating the mass grave of the local victims of the genocide. The construction process also provided a sense of closure to their mourning. Other aspects of the peacebuilding process in the village included paintings on building walls created by the village children of things that they hoped to see in the future as well as things important to their everyday existence. On the economic side of this peacebuilding effort, the people of the village learned how to mosaic and pour concrete, two useful and marketable skills to help provide economic stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://barefootartists.org/|title=Barefoot Artists|last=Yeh|first=Lily|date=|website=Barefoot Artists|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===River City Drum Corps===
In the United State, creative peacebuilding is used in many inner-city areas in places such as New York, Philadelphia, and Louisville. The River City Drum Corps in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville, Ky]] provides a musical outlet for children who perhaps are not listened to in other parts of their lives. It is also a structured program where discipline and the importance of both uniqueness and teamwork are taught. The children learn drumming patterns and perform for different events and groups of people throughout the city. Both the children in the program and their audience benefit from the cultural exchange and communication that take place during drum corps performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rivercitydrumcorpky.com/rcdc/|title=About RCDC|last=|first=|date=|website=River City Drum Corp|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Gospel Jesus}}
 
The '''Descent from the Cross''' ({{lang-el|Ἀποκαθήλωσις}}, ''Apokathelosis''), or '''Deposition of Christ''', is the scene, as depicted in art, from the Gospels' accounts of [[Joseph of Arimathea]] and [[Nicodemus]] taking Christ down from the cross after his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] ({{bibleverse||John|19:38-42}}). In [[Byzantine art]] the topic became popular in the 9th century, and in the West from the 10th century. The Descent from the Cross is the 13th [[Station of the Cross]].

Other figures not mentioned in the [[Gospels]] who are often included in depictions of this subject include [[St. John the Evangelist]], who is sometimes depicted supporting a [[Swoon of the Virgin|fainting Mary]] (as in [[The Descent from the Cross (Rogier van der Weyden)|the work below by Rogier van der Weyden]]), and [[Mary Magdalene]]. The Gospels mention an undefined number of women as watching the crucifixion, including the [[Three Marys]], ([[Salome (disciple)|Mary Salome]] being mentioned in {{bibleverse||Mark|15:40}}), and also that the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene saw the burial ({{bibleverse||Mark|15:47}}). These and further women and unnamed male helpers are often shown.&lt;ref&gt;G. Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art'', Vol. II, 1972 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, p.164, {{ISBN|0-85331-324-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the image==
Even in early depictions the details and posing of the composition, and especially the position of Christ's body, are varied. The scene was usually included in medieval cycles of the Life or the [[Passion of Christ]], between the [[Crucifixion]] and the ''[[Entombment of Christ]]''. The ''[[Lamentation of Christ]]'', or ''[[Pietà]]'', showing the body of Christ held by Mary, may intervene between these two, and is common as an individual image, especially in [[sculpture]]. The ''Bearing of the body'', showing Christ's body being carried to his tomb, and the ''Anointing of Christ's body'', showing the body laid flat on the top of the tomb or a similarly-shaped "anointing-stone" are other scenes that may be shown. This last is especially important in Orthodox art, where it is shown on the [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|Epitaphios]].

With the Renaissance the subject became popular for [[altarpiece]]s, partly because of the challenges of the composition, and the suitability of its vertical shape.  The [[Mannerist]] version of [[Rosso Fiorentino]] is usually regarded as his most important work, and [[Pontormo]]'s altarpiece is perhaps his most ambitious work.  The subject was painted several times by both [[Rubens]] and [[Rembrandt]], who repeated one of his paintings (now in Munich) in a large print, his only one to be mainly [[engraving|engraved]], as well as making two other [[etching]]s of the subject.

'''Dichromacy''' (''di''  meaning "two" and ''chroma'' meaning "color") is the state of having two types of functioning [[color]] receptors, called [[cone cell]]s, in the [[eye]]s. Organisms with dichromacy are called dichromats. Dichromats can match any color they see with a mixture of no more than two pure [[spectrum|spectral lights]]. By comparison, [[trichromat]]s require three pure spectral lights to match all colors that they can perceive, and [[Tetrachromacy|tetrachromats]] require four.

Dichromacy in humans is a color vision defect in which one of the three basic color mechanisms is absent or not functioning. It is hereditary and sex-linked, predominantly affecting males.&lt;ref name="Cassin"&gt;Cassin, B. and Solomon, S. ''Dictionary of Eye Terminology''. Gainesville, Florida: Triad Publishing Company, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Dichromacy occurs when one of the cone pigments is missing and color is reduced to two dimensions.&lt;ref name="Tiresias"&gt;[http://www.tiresias.org/guidelines/colour_blindness.htm "Guidelines: Colour Blindness."] Tiresias.org. Retrieved 29 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
There are various kinds of [[color blindness]]:

* [[Protanopia]] is a severe form of red-green color blindness, in which there is impairment in perception of very long wavelengths, such as reds.  To these individuals, reds are perceived as beige or grey and greens tend to look beige or grey like reds. It is also the most common type of dichromacy today. This problem occurs because patients do not have the red cone cells in the retina.&lt;ref name="HanggiIngersoll2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hanggi|first1=Evelyn B.|last2=Ingersoll|first2=Jerry F.|last3=Waggoner|first3=Terrace L.|title=Color vision in horses (Equus caballus): Deficiencies identified using a pseudoisochromatic plate test.|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|volume=121|issue=1|year=2007|pages=65–72|issn=1939-2087|doi=10.1037/0735-7036.121.1.65}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Protanomaly]] is a less severe version.
* [[Deuteranopia]] consists of an impairment in perceiving medium wavelengths, such as greens.  [[Deuteranomaly]] is a less severe form of deuteranopia.  Those with deuteranomaly cannot see reds and greens like those without this condition; however, they can still distinguish them in most cases. It is very similar to protanopia. In this form, patients do not have green cone cells in the retina, which makes it hard to see the green color.&lt;ref name="HanggiIngersoll2007" /&gt;
* A rarer form of color blindness is [[tritanopia]], where there exists an inability to perceive short wavelengths, such as blues.  Sufferers have trouble distinguishing between yellow and blue. They tend to confuse greens and blues, and yellow can appear pink. This is the rarest of all dichromacy, and occurs in around 1 in 100,000 people. Patients do not have the blue cone cells in the retina.

==Testing for dichromacy==
The three determining elements of a dichromatic opponent-colour space are the missing colour, the null-luminance plane, and the null-chrominance plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scheibner | first1 = H. | last2 = Cleveland | first2 = S. | year = 1998 | title = Dichromacy characterized by chrominance planes | url = | journal = Vision Research | volume = 38 | issue = 21| pages = 3403–3407 | doi=10.1016/s0042-6989(97)00373-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The description of the phenomena itself does not indicate the colour that is impaired to the dichromat, however, it does provides enough information to identify the fundamental colour space, the colours that are seen by the dichromat. This is based on testing both the null-chrominance plane and null-luminance plane which intersect on the missing colour. The cones excited to a corresponding colour in the colour space are visible to the dichromat and those that are not excited are the missing colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scheibner | first1 = H. | last2 = Cleveland | first2 = S. | year = 1997 | title = Dichromacy characterized by chrominance planes | url = | journal = Vision Research | volume = 38 | issue = 1| pages = 3403–3407 | doi=10.1016/s0042-6989(97)00373-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animals that are dichromats==
It is more informative to use situations where less than the total visual system is operating when studying about vision. For example, a system by which cones are the sole visual receptors could be used. This is rare in humans but certain animals possess this trait and this proves useful in understanding the concept of dichromacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobs | first1 = G.

==Color detecting abilities of dichromats==

According to colour vision researchers at the [[Medical College of Wisconsin]] (including [[Jay Neitz]]), each of the three standard colour-detecting cones in the retina of [[trichromat]]s – [[blue]], [[green]] and [[red]] – can pick up about 100 different gradations of colour. If each detector is independent of the others, simple [[exponentiation]] gives a total number of colours discernible by an average human as their product, or about 1 million;&lt;ref name="Roth 2006" &gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06256/721190-114.stm
  |title=Some women who are tetrachromats may see 100,000,000 colors, thanks to their genes
  |author=Mark Roth
  |publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
  |date= 13 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless, other researchers have put the number at upwards of 2.3 million.&lt;ref name=Jacobs09/&gt; Exponentiation suggests that a dichromat (such as a human with red-green [[color blindness]]) would be able to distinguish about 10,000 different colours,&lt;ref&gt;"Color Vision:Almost Reason for Having Eyes" by Jay Neitz, Joseph Carroll, and Maureen Neitz  Optics &amp; Photonics News January 2001 1047-6938/01/01/0026/8- Optical Society of America&lt;/ref&gt; but no such calculation has been verified by [[Psychophysics|psychophysical]] testing.

Furthermore, dichromats have a significantly higher threshold than trichromats for coloured stimuli flickering at low (1&amp;nbsp;Hz) frequencies. At higher (10 or 16&amp;nbsp;Hz) frequencies, dichromats perform as well as or better than trichromats.&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe Lindsay T. ; de Luca Emanuela ; Hansen Thorsten; Gegenfurtner Karl R. "Advantages and disadvantages of human dichromacy" ''JOURNAL OF VISION'',  Volume: 6   Issue: 3   Pages: 213–223   {{doi|10.1167/6.3.3}}  Published: 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bayer Florian S.; Vivian Paulun C.; Weiss David; Gegenfurtner Karl R.

'''Duiliu Zamfirescu''' (30 October 1858 – 3 June 1922) was a Romanian novelist, poet, short story writer, lawyer, [[Nationalism|nationalist]] politician, journalist, diplomat and memoirist. In 1909, he was elected a [[list of members of the Romanian Academy|member of the Romanian Academy]], and, for a while in 1920, he was [[List of Romanian Foreign Ministers|Foreign Minister of Romania]]. Zamfirescu is best remembered for his ''Comăneștenilor'' [[Literature cycle|literary cycle]], comprising his novels ''[[Viața la țară]]'', ''[[Tănase Scatiu]]'', ''În război'', ''Îndreptări'' and ''Anna''.

==Biography==
Born in Plăinești, [[Râmnicu Sărat County]] (present-day [[Dumbrăveni, Vrancea|Dumbrăveni]], [[Vrancea County]]), he attended elementary school and gymnasium in [[Focșani]], and later studied at the [[Matei Basarab High School]] in [[Bucharest]] (1873–1876), before entering the [[University of Bucharest]]'s Faculty of Law.&lt;ref name="Săndulescu, p.XLIII"&gt;Săndulescu, p.XLIII&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in 1880.&lt;ref name="Săndulescu, p.XLIII"/&gt;

Zamfirescu made his debut with a series of poems in ''[[Ghimpele]]'' review (1877), and, later in the same year, became an enthusiastic supporter of the Romanian war effort during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Independence War]], an experience which placed its mark on his later works and choice of subjects.&lt;ref name="Săndulescu, p.XLIII"/&gt; Three years later, he became associated with [[Alexandru Macedonski]]'s ''[[Literatorul]]'', a circle of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] writers,&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.262, 303; Săndulescu, p.XLIV&lt;/ref&gt; publishing a [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poem titled ''Levante și Kalavryta'' ("Levante and Kalavryta").&lt;ref name="Săndulescu, p.XLIV"&gt;Săndulescu, p.XLIV&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, his work was under the influence of Macedonski's [[Parnassianism]].&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.263"&gt;Ornea, p.263&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, he was appointed [[public prosecutor]] in the [[Northern Dobruja]]n town of [[Hârșova]], while being employed, until 1884, as literary columnist for ''[[România Liberă]]''. At the time, the editorial staff also included the writers [[Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea]], [[Alexandru Vlahuță]], and [[D. D. Racoviță-Sphinx]].&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.262"&gt;Ornea, p.262&lt;/ref&gt; Zamfirescu contributed articles in which he declared his dislike for [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]],&lt;ref&gt;Cristea, p.XXXVII; Săndulescu, p.XLIV&lt;/ref&gt; as well as distancing himself from the [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] of his contemporaries [[Ion Luca Caragiale]] and [[Ioan Slavici]] (despite common perception, he claimed he had "nothing in common" with the latter two).&lt;ref&gt;Zamfirescu, in Cristea, p.XXXVII&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, he also contributed political articles under the pen name ''Don Padil''.&lt;ref name="Săndulescu, p.XLIV"/&gt;

In 1882, after briefly serving as a [[prosecutor]] in [[Târgoviște]] and resigning, Duiliu Zamfirescu moved back to Focșani, where he practiced law and was a [[French language]] substitute teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Săndulescu, p.XLIIV&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the same year, he settled in Bucharest and joined ''România Liberă'''s editorial staff, publishing his first volume of prose and poems, ''Fără titlu'' ("Untitled"), in 1883.&lt;ref name="Săndulescu, p.XLIV"/&gt; Zamfirescu authored his debut novel, ''În fața vieții'' ("Facing Life") in 1884—the work was noted for the chapter "Pesimistul de la Soleni" ("The [[Pessimism|Pessimist]] of Soleni"), a satire of the [[Russian Empire|Russian]]-born [[Socialism|socialist]] thinker [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]].&lt;ref name="Săndulescu, p.XLIV"/&gt;

In 1885, he came out first in an examination for the office of [[legation]] ''[[Attaché]]'', and was consequently employed by the [[List of Romanian Foreign Ministers|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], while at the same time teaching the [[Romanian language]] at the Sf. Gheorghe High School.&lt;ref&gt;Săndulescu, p.XLIV-XLV&lt;/ref&gt; He also began associating with the ''[[Junimea]]'' circle and began writing for its magazine, ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', bringing his writings to the attention of [[Titu Maiorescu]],&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.67, 71, 260, 261-263; Săndulescu, p.XLIV-XLV&lt;/ref&gt; while becoming a regular in the literary circle formed around the restaurant [[Casa Capșa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Ro icon}} Daniela Șontică, [http://www.jurnalul.ro/print.php?id=60349 "La un șvarț cu capșiștii" ("Having a Coffee Substitute with the Crowd at Casa Capșa")]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, in ''[[Jurnalul Național]]'', August 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He was part of a small group of literary figures who oscillated between ''Literatorul'' and Maiorescu's circle—others to do so were [[Vasile Alecsandri]], [[Veronica Micle]] and [[Matilda Cugler-Poni]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.303&lt;/ref&gt; The first of his poems to be published with Maiorescu's approval was titled ''Iarna'' ("Winter")—printed in June 1884.&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.263"/&gt; Zamfirescu is considered one of the most important writers to have been associated with ''Junimea'' during the final stage of its existence.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.67, 157, 259-260&lt;/ref&gt; He nonetheless maintained some distance to the society, and reportedly irritated Titu Maiorescu by collaborating with the newly established anti-''Junimist'' magazines ''Literatură și Artă Română'' (edited by [[N. Petraşcu]], on whom Zamfirescu was to be an influence, and [[Dimitrie C. Ollănescu-Ascanio]]).&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.266"&gt;Ornea, p.266&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, in May 1885, Zamfirescu was dispatched to Italy, as legation secretary in [[Rome]], a position which he filled until 1906, with a hiatus (1892–1894) during which he was assigned to Greece and later Belgium.&lt;ref name="Săndulescu, p.XLV"&gt;Săndulescu, p.XLV&lt;/ref&gt; He was a colleague of [[Dimitrie Ghyka]],&lt;ref name="ghyka"&gt;{{Ro icon}} [[Dimitrie Ghyka]], [http://www.itcnet.ro/history/archive/mi2000/current2/mi47.htm "Memorii" ("Memoirs")] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007124746/http://www.itcnet.ro/history/archive/mi2000/current2/mi47.htm |date=October 7, 2007 }}, excerpts published by ''Magazin Istoric'', February 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and remembered for welcoming the [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] [[Transylvania]]n activist [[Badea Cârţan]] during the latter's celebrated trip to the Italian capital (1896).&lt;ref&gt;{{Ro icon}} Ana Maria Luca, [http://www.jurnalul.ro/articol_31754/dacul_din_columna.html "Dacul din Columnă" ("The Dacian from the Column")], in ''[[Jurnalul Național]]'', April 10, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Zamfirescu married an Italian woman, Henrietta Allievi, who died in 1920.&lt;ref name="ghyka"/&gt;

An enthusiastic admirer of [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s writings, he began work on a [[monograph]] entirely dedicated to the latter (excerpts of which were first published in 1892 issues of ''Convorbiri Literare'').&lt;ref name="Săndulescu, p.XLV"/&gt; With his 1894 volume of poetry ''Alte orizonturi'' ("Other Horizons"), Zamfirescu entered a prolific phase of his literary career: in 1894-1895, ''Convorbiri Literare'' serialized his novel ''[[Viața la țară]]'' ("Life in the Country"), followed in 1895-1896 by ''[[Tănase Scatiu]]'', and, in 1897-1898, ''În război'' ("At War");&lt;ref name="Săndulescu, p.XLV"/&gt; in 1895, he also published his collected [[novella]]s (''Nuvele romane'', "Roman Novellas"), followed by the poetry volumes ''Imnuri păgâne'' ("Pagan Hymns", 1897), and ''Poezii nouă'' ("New Poems", 1899).&lt;ref name="Săndulescu, p.XLV"/&gt;

His relations with Dobrogeanu-Gherea was tense, but, in 1890, Zamfirescu approved of the decision taken by the [[Theodor Rosetti]] cabinet to award the Romanian citizenship to the philosopher (at a time when his [[Jew]]ish ethnicity would have made it extremely hard to obtain).&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.316&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Dobrogeanu-Gherea published a study of Zamfirescu's works.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.326&lt;/ref&gt; The two opposed each other over economic ideas and Dobrogeanu-Gherea's application of [[Marxism]] to the Romanian society—examining the works of [[Achille Loria]], Zamfirescu collected Marxist-inspired notions that, he believed, contradicted Dobrogeanu-Gherea from inside his own camp.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.334-335&lt;/ref&gt; When Maiorescu and the Romanian Marxists were engaged in a lengthy polemic, he added his own arguments in support of the former.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.335&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1901 and 1902, his novel ''Îndreptări'' ("Betterments") was serialized by the magazine ''Literatură și Artă Română'', which was a sign of cooling relations between Zamfirescu and his mentor Maiorescu (nevertheless, ''Convorbiri Literare'' continued to publish Zamfirescu's novel ''Anna'' in 1906).&lt;ref&gt;Săndulescu, p.XLV-XVI&lt;/ref&gt; He apparently sought to include in his work both major tendencies of [[Literature of Romania|19th century Romanian literature]]—"[[art for art's sake]]" as preached by Maiorescu and the "[[Didacticism|tendentious art]]" notably advocated by Dobrogeanu-Gherea.&lt;ref&gt;Cristea, p.XLI&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1905, through the articles of [[Simion Mehedinți]], his work came to be criticized by the traditionalist magazine ''[[Sămănătorul]]'', who coupled a rejection of [[modernism]] with an appreciation of for [[folklore]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.77-78&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, Zamfirescu was accepted to the Academy, and delivered a much-discussed speech on the influence of [[Poporanism]] and traditionalism in literature, showing his disapproval for both currents.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.71; Săndulescu, p.XVI&lt;/ref&gt; It stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I do not go as far as to state that the peasants' soul is not at all interesting to literature; that is because for me, all of nature is interesting. Despite this, the greatest critics and the greatest creators of human characters do not deal with simple souls, because they are as uneventful as nothingness itself."&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.267"&gt;Ornea, p.267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Zamfirescu thus attacked the use of folklore for direct inspiration, which saw Maiorescu, among others, defending folk literature and its supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.71-72&lt;/ref&gt; Maiorescu had by then ceased most contacts with his former protégé.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.266-267, 268&lt;/ref&gt; There were also notable tensions between Zamfirescu and the Transylvanian poet [[Octavian Goga]], whose work was hailed as an example by both Maiorescu and ''Sămănătorul''.&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.267"/&gt;

The same year, Zamfirescu was named a [[Minister Plenipotentiary]] and the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]]'s envoy to the [[Danube Commission]].&lt;ref name="Săndulescu, p.XVI"&gt;Săndulescu, p.XVI&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Furfanțo'' volume of short stories and his novel ''Lydda'' were both printed in 1911.&lt;ref name="Săndulescu, p.XVI"/&gt; He was relieved of his diplomatic post in 1913, at a time when Maiorescu became [[List of Prime Ministers of Romania|Premier]] of a [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]] cabinet—this came after a [[Romanian Army]] officer reported statements made by Zamfirescu, which he alleged were [[Patriotism|unpatriotic]].&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.268"&gt;Ornea, p.268&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Maiorescu never gave Zamfirescu a chance to explain himself.&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.268"/&gt;

During [[World War I]], following the [[Romanian Campaign (World War I)|occupation of southern Romania]] by the [[Central Powers]], Zamfirescu followed Romanian authorities in their [[Iaşi]] refuge.&lt;ref name="Săndulescu, p.XVI"/&gt; By late 1918, he became a founding member of the [[People's Party (interwar Romania)|People's Party]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Ro icon}} Ioan Scurtu, [http://www.itcnet.ro/history/archive/mi1997/current5/mi41.htm "Mit și realitate.

His short term in office was noted for the establishment of Romanian relations with the [[Holy See]] (''see [[Roman Catholicism in Romania]]''). In 1919, [[Vladimir Ghika]] had been appointed Romanian representative to the [[Pope|Papacy]] by the National Romanian Council, an institution which campaigned for the recognition of [[Greater Romania]] at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]].&lt;ref name="predabucur"&gt;{{Ro icon}} Dumitru Preda, Marius Bucur, [http://www.itcnet.ro/history/archive/mi2000/current5/mi56.htm "România - Vatican. 80 ani de relații diplomatice" ("Romania - Vatican. 80 Years of Diplomatic Relations")] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010050951/http://www.itcnet.ro/history/archive/mi2000/current5/mi56.htm |date=October 10, 2007 }}, in ''Magazin Istoric'', May 2000, p.57&lt;/ref&gt; When Ghika's term expired, he was replaced by Zamfirescu with [[Dimitrie Pennescu]], who was Romania's first [[Ambassador of Romania to the Holy See|Ambassador to the Vatican]].&lt;ref name="predabucur"/&gt; The [[Nuncio|Apostolic Nunciature]] in Romania was set up as a result of this, and first held by Archbishop [[Francesco Marmaggi]].&lt;ref name="predabucur"/&gt;

Duiliu Zamfirescu's last published works were his poetry volume ''Pe Marea Neagră'' ("On the [[Black Sea]]", 1919) and a collection of autobiographical pieces and short stories, ''O muză'' ("A Muse", 1920).&lt;ref name="Săndulescu, p.XVI"/&gt; In July 1921, he was involved in projects to crown [[King of Romania|King]] [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]] as "King of Greater Romania".&lt;ref&gt;{{Ro icon}} [[G.

==Style, assessments, and legacy==
Zamfirescu's creations were original in style, blending a series of contrasting influences. One of the most enduring of these was the prose of [[Nicolae Gane]].&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.259"&gt;Ornea, p.259&lt;/ref&gt; After parting with [[Parnassianism]] and [[Romanticism]], Duiliu Zamfirescu adopted some of Gane's themes (including his compassionate perspective on the decay of low-ranking [[boyar]]s as a [[social class]]) and, in part, his storytelling techniques.&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.259"/&gt; The writer was also known for the frequent comparisons he drew between his novels and those of [[Leo Tolstoy]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.261, 262&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his later works bear the imprint of [[Neoclassicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.262, 263&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of ''[[Junimea]]'' guidelines in his writings is a disputed subject. An opponent of both strict [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] and rural traditionalism, Zamfirescu ridiculed the works of ''Junimist'' novelist [[Ioan Slavici]] as "sentimental mawkishness".&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.260"&gt;Ornea, p.260&lt;/ref&gt; Such contradictions have literary historians such as [[Tudor Vianu]] to leave him out of their essays on ''Junimism''.&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.260"/&gt; It was also proposed that Zamfirescu associated with both ''[[Literatorul]]'' and ''[[Junimea]]'' due to one of their very few common traits, which was political in nature: the two groups shared Zamfirescu's [[conservatism]] and his interest in preserving a Romanian [[aristocracy]] on the boyar model.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.262-263&lt;/ref&gt; Although his similarities with ''Junimea'' were extended after he adopted Neoclassical guidelines, Zamfirescu strongly disagreed with Maiorescu and his disciples on the issue of peasant themes and folklore in novels, arguing that the new literature was supposed to draw inspiration from the urban environment and the rural [[upper class]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.263-265&lt;/ref&gt; In one instance, he is known to have referred to ''Junimea'''s theory on the peasant novel using the French expression ''c'est bourgeois et plat'' ("it is [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] and plain").&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.266"/&gt;

In many ways, however, Zamfirescu was a Realist, notably using the guidelines imposed by ''Junimea'' as a means to give an accurate portrayal of his characters' speech.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.264-265&lt;/ref&gt; Researcher [[Z. Ornea]] argued that the main disagreement between him and the literary society was over Maiorescu's view that the national values of Romania were mostly embodied by the peasants, with Zamfirescu arguing that these had also been preserved by the cultured groups of low-ranking boyars.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.265, 268-269, 271-274&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Ornea, Zamfirescu's focus on the latter group and his [[nationalism]] came to contrast with his aesthetic guidelines, and, paradoxically, led to virtually all of his novels having a rural background and displaying a strong sympathy for the peasantry.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.268-277&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, Zamfirescu's positive characters lash out at boyars of foreign origins, to whom they refer as "[[Phanariotes]]", and tolerate the unscrupulous [[Tănase Scatiu]] in their company only because he is from the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.269&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, Scatiu is also disliked for being a [[Greeks of Romania|Greek]] and a profiteering [[Leasehold estate|estate leaseholder]]—indicative of Zamfirescu's own social and national views.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.270, 273&lt;/ref&gt; Zamfirescu believed in a strong and natural connection between the landowners and their property, as well as between the landowners and their community—this theme was found with many conservatives of his day, including the ''Junimists'' [[Petre P. Carp]] and [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]], and announced a similar theory constructed by historian [[Nicolae Iorga]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.272, 275&lt;/ref&gt; In his fictional world, peasants make brief appearances as secondary characters, noted for their deep respect for the traditional owners, as well as for their dislike of all change.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.272-276&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, Zamfirescu introduced [[Socialism|socialist]] agitators as negative characters, and, in ''Lume nouă şi lume veche'' ("New World and Old World"), one of his less known novels, gave them the central stage as a means to [[Satire|satirize]] them.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.275&lt;/ref&gt;

Duiliu Zamfirescu remained a maverick throughout his life, and his publicized outbursts against various trends has probably contributed to the decline in interests among his public and critics.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.260-261&lt;/ref&gt; Ornea described him as "immeasurably arrogant, petulant and a [[snob]]", noting that these traits had led to "unjust" treatment of his work.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.261&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[interwar period]], Zamfirescu's views were defended by the modernist critic [[Eugen Lovinescu]], whose arguments were later rejected by his colleague [[George Călinescu]]—the latter argued that Lovinescu had failed to prove Zamfirescu's aesthetic value.&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.260"/&gt; Criticism of Zamfirescu was especially acute after his 1909 speech, when both competing traditionalist currents, [[Poporanism]] and ''[[Sămănătorul]]'', attacked his work in its entirety.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.261-262&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Ornea, Zamfirescu's novels serve as a bridge between ''Junimea'' and 20th century traditionalism.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.276-277&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have traditionally held a more favorable view of Zamfirescu's correspondence, which was only published after 1937.&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.262"/&gt; Offering a glimpse into his lengthy investigation of artistic styles and tenets, they have won acclaim for their refinement.&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.262"/&gt;

[[File:Jasper Johns, Flag (detail).jpg|thumb|Detail of ''Flag'' (1954-55). Museum of Modern Art, New York City. This image illustrates Johns' early technique of painting with thick, dripping encaustic over a collage made from found materials such as newspaper. This rough method of construction is rarely visible in photographic reproductions of his work.]]
'''''Flag''''' is an [[encaustic painting]] by the American artist [[Jasper Johns]]. Created when Johns was 24 (1954–55), two years after he was discharged from the [[US Army]], this painting was the first of many works that Johns has said were inspired by a dream of the [[U.S. flag]] in 1954. It is arguably the painting for which Johns is best known.

The US flag was in the news repeatedly in 1954. The [[McCarthy hearings]] came to a close on 17 June 1954, only three days after [[Flag Day (United States)|Flag Day]]. On Flag Day, U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] signed an amendment to the [[pledge of allegiance]] to add the words "under God." The ''New York Times'' ran article on facts and myths associated with the flag on the day before Flag Day, and then an article on the "discipline" of the flag on Flag Day itself, saying, with reference to a national air-raid drill "we are all soldiers now". [[Francis Scott Key]], composer of "[[The Star Spangled Banner]]", was born in 1779, 175 years before 1954. The [[Iwo Jima Marine Memorial]] at [[Arlington National Cemetery]], with its large US flag, was dedicated on 11 November 1954. Johns and his father were both named after Sergeant [[William Jasper]], who saved the fallen flag of the Americans at [[Fort Moultrie]] in the [[American Revolutionary War]].

The work measures {{convert|107.3|cm}} by {{convert|153.8|cm}}. It is made using encaustic, oil paint, and newsprint collage on three separate canvases, mounted on a plywood board. The painting reflects the three colors of the US flag: red, white and blue; the flag is depicted in the form it took between 1912 and 1959, with 48 white stars on a blue canton representing the then-US states (excluding Alaska and Hawaii), and with thirteen red and white stripes. Newsprint is visible under the stripes. Reading the texts, it is clear that the newsprint was not selected at random: Johns steered clear of headlines, or national or political news, and used inconsequential articles or adverts. The painting has a rough-textured surface, and the 48 stars are not identical. It is dated 1954 on its reverse.

Johns's selection of the US flag allows him to explore a familiar two-dimensional object, with its simple internal geometric structure and a complex symbolic meaning. Johns was attracted to painting "things the mind already knows", and claimed that using a familiar object like the flag freed himself from the need to create a new design and allowed him to focus on the execution of the painting. Critics were unsure whether it was a painted flag or a painting ''of'' a flag; Johns later said it was both. His work is often described as [[Neo-Dadaist]] and anticipates aspects of [[pop art]], [[minimal art]], and [[conceptual art]].

Johns made over 40 works based on the US flag, including a large and monochrome ''[[White Flag (Johns painting)|White Flag]]'' in 1955, and his 1958 work ''[[Three Flags]]'' with three superimposed flags showing a total of 84 stars.

In November 2014 the encaustic ''Flag'' (1983) was auctioned off for $36,000,000 at Sotheby's New York.

The painting was included in Johns's first solo exhibition at the [[Leo Castelli Gallery]] in early 1958. [[Alfred Barr]], director of the [[Museum of Modern Art]], wanted to buy the work, but was concerned that it might be considered unpatriotic. He persuaded a friend, [[Philip Johnson]], to buy it instead; Johnson bought it, and donated it to the [[Museum of Modern Art]] "in honor of [[Alfred H. Barr, Jr.]]" when he retired in 1968.

'''Franz Mayer Traumann''', better known as '''Franz Mayer''' (1882, [[Mannheim]], [[Germany]] – 1975, [[Mexico]]) was a Jewish German-Mexican financier, photographer and collector, and the founder of the [[Franz Mayer Museum]] in [[Mexico City]].

== Biography ==
Franz Mayer arrived in Mexico in 1905. He moved into the financial world at the age of 23 and by around 1908 he had already enrolled as an agent of an independent [[stock exchange]], thus beginning a promising career.

During the [[Mexican Revolution]], he left the country and went to the [[United States]], where he lived for two years, returning to Mexico in 1913. In 1920, he married Maria Antonieta de la Macorra but became a widower a few years later, having had no children. He became a Mexican citizen on 29 December 1933.

From the 1950s, Franz Mayer had conceived the idea of donating his collection of fine and decorative arts to Mexico. Finally in 1963 he set up a trust fund, and the [[Bank of Mexico]] was chosen as the fiduciary for the establishment of an art museum in [[Mexico City]]. At the same time a sponsor was found among the people closest to him. According to the wishes of Franz Mayer, the contract established that the trusteeship would create a library, organize exhibitions, competitions and conferences.

Franz Mayer died in 1975 and donated his collection to the state and people of Mexico. The museum carrying his name was opened in 1986 in the former flour-weighing building and hospital, specially renovated in order to house this collection.

'''Helena Charlotta Åkerhielm''' née '''af Ugglas''' (1786- 7 April 1828) was a Swedish dramatist and translator. 

She was the daughter of count [[Samuel af Ugglas]] and Carolina Wittfoth and married baron [[Gustaf Fredrik Åkerhielm]] (1776-1853) in 1807. 

Her spouse was director of the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]] in 1818-23, and like him, she was genuinely interested in the dramatic art and active as a playwright and translator there. She co-wrote the tragedy ''Engelbrekt'' in collaboration with her spouse, which was staged at the Royal Dramatic theatre in 1820; the play was successful and was played at the theatre seventeen times until 1841. She also translated the plays ''Värdshuset, eller det lyckliga äventyret'' (1819), ''De begge svartsjuke'' (1820) and ''Maria Stuart'' (1820), all of them from French, which were all staged with good critique on the royal theatre. 

She was the first woman to have her own play staged at the Royal Dramatic theatre, and together with [[Jeanette Granberg]] one of only two female playwrights to have their plays staged at the Royal Dramatic theatre before 1863.

'''High culture''' encompasses the [[culture|cultural products]] of aesthetic value, which a society collectively esteem as exemplary [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Raymond. ''Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society'' (1983) Rev. Ed. p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; It may also include intellectual works considered to be of supreme philosophical, historical, or literary value, as well as the education which cultivates such aesthetic and intellectual pursuits. In popular usage, the term ''high culture'' identifies the culture of an [[upper class]] (an [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]]) or of a [[status class]] (the [[intelligentsia]]); and also identifies a society’s common repository of broad-range knowledge and tradition (e.g. folk culture) that transcends the social-class system of the society. Sociologically, the term ''high culture'' is contrasted with the term ''[[low culture]]'', the forms of [[popular culture]] characteristic of the less-educated social classes, such as the [[barbarians]], the [[Philistinism|Philistines]], and ''[[hoi polloi]]'' (the masses).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7uMOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA68 |year=1989 |title=Edging Women Out: Victorian Novelists, Publishers and Social Change |isbn=978-0-415-03767-9 |author=Gaye Tuchman, Nina E.

==Concept==
{{more footnotes|section|date=December 2016}}
;Definition
In European history, '''high culture''' was understood as a cultural concept common to the humanities, until the mid-19th century, when [[Matthew Arnold]] introduced the term ''high culture'' in the book ''[[Culture and Anarchy]]'' (1869). The Preface defines [[culture]] as "the disinterested endeavour after man’s perfection" pursued, obtained, and achieved by effort to "know the best that has been said and thought in the world." Such a literary definition of high culture also comprehends [[philosophy]]. Moreover, the philosophy of aesthetics proposed in high culture is a force for moral and political good. Critically, the term "high culture" is contrasted with the terms "[[popular culture]]" and "[[mass culture]]".&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1967) Volume 1. p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Notes Towards the Definition of Culture'' (1948), [[T. S. Eliot]] said that high culture and popular culture are necessary and complementary parts of the culture of a society. In ''[[The Uses of Literacy]]'' (1957), [[Richard Hoggart]] presents the sociologic experience of the working-class man and woman in acquiring the cultural literacy, at university, which facilitates social upward mobility. In the U.S., [[Harold Bloom]] and [[F. R. Leavis]] pursued the definition of high culture, by way of the [[Western canon]] of literature.
[[File:TS Eliot.jpg|thumb|T. S. Eliot]]

Media theorist [[Steven Johnson (author)|Steven Johnson]] writes that, unlike popular culture, "the classics—and soon to be classics—are" in their own right descriptions and explanations of the cultural systems that produced them." He says that "a crucial way in which mass culture differs from high art" is that individual works of mass culture are less interesting than the broader cultural trends which produced them.&lt;ref name="Johnson2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Johnson|title=Everything Bad is Good for You: How Popular Culture is Making Us Smarter|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2CVF7E3hpn4C&amp;q=classics|date=6 April 2006|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-193312-2|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''History of high culture in the West'''

The high culture of the [[Western culture|West]] originated in the classical-world traditions of intellectual and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] life in [[Ancient Greece]] (from c. 8th century BC – AD 147) and [[Ancient Rome]] (753 BC – AD 476). In the classical [[Greco-Roman]] tradition, the ideal mode of language was published and preserved in works of elevated style (correct grammar, syntax, and diction). Certain forms of language used by authors in valorized epochs were held up in antiquity and the Renaissance as eternal valid models and normative standards of excellence; e.g. the Attic dialect of ancient Greek spoken and written by the playwrights and philosophers of Periclean Athens (fifth century BC); and the form of classical Latin used in the "Golden Age" of Roman culture (c. 70 B.C. - AD 18) represented by such figures as Cicero and Virgil.This form of education was known to the Greeks as παιδεία, which was translated by the Romans into Latin as ''humanitas'' &lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius. Attic Nights 13:17 http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/gellius/13*.html&lt;/ref&gt;'since it reflected a form of education aiming at the refinement of human nature, rather than the acquisition of technical or vocational skills. Indeed, the Greco-Roman world tended to see such manual, commercial, and technical labor as subordinate to purely intellectual activities.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero. ''De Officiis''. 150 – http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0048%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D150&lt;/ref&gt; From the idea of the "free" man with sufficient leisure to pursue such intellectual and aesthetic refinement, arose the classical distinction between the "liberal" arts which are intellectual and done for their own sake, as against the "servile"or "mechanical" arts which were associated with manual labor and done to earn a living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maritain.nd.edu/jmc/etext/art4.htm|title=Jacques Maritain Center: Art and Scholasticism 4|website=maritain.nd.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This implied an association between high culture and the upper classes whose inherited wealth provided such time for intellectual cultivation. The leisured gentleman not weighed down by the necessity of earning a living, was free to devote himself to activities proper to such a "free man"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_88|title=Moral letters to Lucilius|last=Seneca|publisher=|via=Wikisource}}&lt;/ref&gt; – those deemed to involve true excellence and nobility as opposed to mere utility.
 
During the Renaissance, the classical intellectual values of the fully rediscovered Græco–Roman culture were the cultural capital of the upper classes(and the aspiring), and aimed at the complete development of human intellectual, aesthetic, and moral faculties. This ideal associated with humanism (a later term derived from the humanities or ''studia humanitatis''), was communicated in Renaissance Italy through institutions such as the Renaissance court schools. Renaissance humanism soon spread through Europe becoming much of the basis of upper class education for centuries. For the socially ambitious man and woman who means to rise in society, ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'' (1528), by [[Baldasare Castiglione]], instructs the reader to acquire and possess knowledge of the Græco–Roman Classics, being education integral to the social-persona of the [[Aristocracy|aristocrat]]. A key contribution of the Renaissance was the elevation of painting and sculpture to a status equal to the liberal arts (hence the visual arts lost for elites any lingering negative association with manual artisanship.) The early Renaissance treatises of [[Leon Battista Alberti]] were instrumental in this regard.

The evolution of the concept of high culture initially was defined in educational terms largely as critical study and knowledge of the Græco–Roman arts and [[humanities]] which furnished much of the foundation for [[European culture|European cultures]] and societies. However, aristocratic patronage through most of the modern era was also pivotal to the support and creation of new works of high culture across the range of arts, music, and literature. The subsequent prodigious development of the modern European languages and cultures meant that the modern definition of the term "high culture" embraces not only Greek and Latin texts, but a much broader canon of select literary, philosophical, historical, and scientific books in both ancient and modern languages. Of comparable importance are those works of art and music considered to be of the highest excellence and broadest influence (e.g. the Parthenon, the painting and sculpture of Michelangelo, the music of Mozart, etc). Together these texts and art works constitute the exemplary artifacts representing the high culture of the Western world. 
 
;Cultural traditions
In the Western and some East Asian traditions, art that demonstrates the imagination of the artist is accorded the status of high art. In the West this tradition began in Ancient Greece, was reinforced in the [[Renaissance]], and by [[Romanticism]], which eliminated the [[hierarchy of genres]] within the [[fine arts]], which was established in the Renaissance. In China there was a distinction between the [[literati painting]] by the [[scholar-official]]s and the work produced by common artists, working in largely different styles, or the decorative arts such as [[Chinese porcelain]] which were produced by unknown craftsmen working in large factories. In both China and the West the distinction was especially clear in [[landscape painting]], where for centuries imaginary views, produced from the imagination of the artist, were considered superior works.

;Cultural capital
In socially-stratified Europe and the Americas, a first-hand immersion to the high culture of the West, the [[Grand Tour|Grand Tour of Europe]], was a rite of passage that complemented and completed the book education of a [[gentleman]], from the nobility, the aristocracy, and the bourgeoisie, with a worldly perspective of society and civilisation. The post-university tour of the cultural centres of Europe was a social-class benefit of the [[cultural capital]] transmitted through the high-status institutions (schools, academies, universities) meant to produce the ideal gentleman of that society. 

The European concept of high culture included cultivation of refined etiquette and manners; the education of taste in the fine arts such as sculpture and painting; an appreciation of classical music and opera in its diverse history and myriad forms; knowledge of the humane letters (''literae humaniores'') represented by the best Greek and Latin authors, and more broadly of the liberal arts traditions (e.g. philosophy, history, drama, rhetoric, and poetry) of Western civilisation, as well as a general acquaintance with important concepts in theology, science, and political thought.

==High art==
[[File:The MET.jpg|thumb|The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], on [[Fifth Avenue]]]]
Much of high culture consists of the appreciation of what is sometimes called "high art". This term is rather broader than Arnold's definition and besides [[literature]] includes music, [[visual arts]] (especially [[painting]]), and traditional forms of the [[performing arts]] (including some [[film|cinema]]). The [[decorative art]]s would not generally be considered high art.&lt;ref&gt;Dormer, Peter (ed.), ''The Culture of Craft'', 1997, Manchester University Press, {{ISBN|0719046181}}, 9780719046186, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wSZASV70krMC&amp;pg=PT66&amp;lpg=PT66 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural products most often regarded as forming part of high culture are most likely to have been produced during periods of high [[civilization]], for which a large, [[sophistication|sophisticated]], and wealthy urban-based society provides a coherent and conscious aesthetic framework, and a large-scale milieu of training, and, for the [[visual arts]], sourcing materials and financing work. Such an environment enables artists, as near as possible, to realize their creative potential with as few as possible practical and technical constraints. Although the Western concept of high culture naturally concentrates on the Greco-Roman tradition, and its resumption from the [[Renaissance]] onwards, such conditions existed in other places at other times.

==Art music==
{{main|Art music}}
[[Art music]] (or serious music&lt;ref&gt;a b "Music" in Encyclopedia Americana, reprint 1993, p. 647&lt;/ref&gt; or erudite music) is an [[umbrella term]] used to refer to musical traditions implying advanced structural and theoretical considerations and a written musical tradition.&lt;ref name="DenisArnold"&gt;
Denis Arnold, "Art Music, Art Song", in The New Oxford Companion to Music, Volume 1: A-J, (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1983): 111. {{ISBN|0-19-311316-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of art music is a frequent and well-defined musicological distinction – musicologist Philip Tagg, for example, refers to art music as one of an "axiomatic triangle consisting of 'folk', 'art' and 'popular' musics". He explains that each of these three is distinguishable from the others according to certain criteria, with high cultural music often performed to an audience whilst folk music would traditionally be more participatory.&lt;ref&gt;
Philip Tagg, "Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice", Popular Music 2 (1982): 41.
&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, "art music" frequently occurs as a contrasting term to "popular music" and to "traditional" or "folk music".&lt;ref name="DenisArnold" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Music" in ''Encyclopedia Americana'', reprint 1993, p. 647
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Tagg, "Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice", ''Popular Music 2'' (1982): 37–67, here 41–42.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art film==
{{main|Art film}}
[[Art film]] is the result of [[filmmaking]] which is typically a serious, [[independent film]] aimed at a [[niche market]] rather than a [[mass market]] [[audience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Art film definition – Dictionary – MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861685559/art_film.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwKfOywe?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861685559/art_film.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critics and [[film studies]] scholars typically define an "art film" using a "...canon of films and those formal qualities that mark them as different from mainstream Hollywood films",&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Wilinsky. {{Google books|id=0CDEQ6AEwAA|title=Sure Seaters: The Emergence of Art House Cinema}}. University of Minnesota, 2001 (Commerce and Mass Culture Series). See also review in {{Google books|id=gPMKAQAAMAAJ|page=171|Volume 32|text=canon of films and those formal qualities that mark them as different from mainstream Hollywood films}}, ''[[Journal of Popular Film &amp; Television]]'', 2004. Retrieved 2012-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt; which includes, among other elements: a [[social realism]] style; an emphasis on the authorial expressivity of the director or writer; and a focus on the thoughts and dreams of characters, rather than presenting a clear, goal-driven story. According to the film scholar [[David Bordwell]], "art cinema itself is a [[film genre]], with its own distinct conventions."&lt;ref&gt;Keith, Barry. ''Film Genres: From Iconography to Ideology''. Wallflower Press: 2007. (page 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotion of high culture==
[[File:The Ballet Rambert Visiting An Aircraft Factory in Britain TR969.jpg|thumb|right|Dancers from the [[Ballet Rambert]], under the auspices of CEMA, a government programme, perform ''[[Peter and The Wolf]]'' at an aircraft factory in the English Midlands during World War II.]]
The term has always been susceptible to attack for [[elitism]], and, in response, many proponents of the concept devoted great efforts to promoting high culture among a wider public than the highly educated [[bourgeoisie]] whose natural territory it was supposed to be. There was a drive, beginning in the 19th century, to open [[museum]]s and [[concert hall]]s to give the general public access to high culture. Figures such as [[John Ruskin]] and [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|Lord Reith]] of the BBC in Britain, [[Leon Trotsky]] and others in Communist [[Russia]], and many others in America and throughout the western world have worked to widen the appeal of elements of high culture such as [[classical music]], art by [[old master]]s and the [[classic literature|literary classics]].

With the widening of access to university education, the effort spread there, and all aspects of high culture became the objects of academic study, which with the exception of the [[Classical studies|classics]] had not often been the case until the late 19th century. University [[liberal arts]] courses still play an important role in the promotion of the concept of high culture, though often now avoiding the term itself.

Especially in Europe, governments have been prepared to subsidize high culture through the funding of [[museum]]s, [[opera]] and [[ballet]] companies, [[orchestra]]s, cinema, public [[broadcasting]] stations such as [[BBC Radio 3]], [[Arte|ARTE]], and in other ways. Organizations such as the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]], and in most European countries, whole ministries administer these programs. This includes the subsidy of new works by composers, writers and artists. There are also many private philanthropic sources of funding, which are especially important in the US, where the federally funded [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] also funds broadcasting. These may be seen as part of the broader concept of [[official culture]], although often a mass audience is not the intended market.

==Theories of high culture==
[[File:Ernest Renan 1876-84.jpg|thumb|[[Ernest Renan]] ([[Antoine Samuel Adam-Salomon]], 1870s)]]

The relations between high culture and mass culture are concerns of [[cultural studies]],  [[media studies]], and [[critical theory]], [[sociology]], [[Postmodernism]] and [[Marxist philosophy]]. In the essay "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]" (1936), [[Walter Benjamin]] explored the relations of value of the arts (high and mass) when subjected to industrial reproduction. The critical theoreticians [[Theodor W. Adorno]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]] interpreted the high-art and mass-art cultural relations as an instrument of social control, with which the [[ruling class]] maintain their [[cultural hegemony]] upon society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = McGregor| first = Craig| authorlink =| title = Class in Australia | edition=1| year=1997| publisher  = Penguin Books Australia Ltd| location=Ringwood, Victoria | isbn=978-0-14-008227-2| page = 301| quote= Élite culture is often an instrument of social control. . . .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Orientalist [[Ernest Renan]] and for the rationalist philosopher [[Ernest Gellner]], high culture was conceptually integral to the politics and ideology of [[nationalism]], as a requisite part of a healthy national identity. Gellner expanded the conceptual scope of the phrase in ''Nations and Nationalism'' (1983) stating that high art is "a literate, codified culture, which permits context-free communication" among cultures.

In ''[[La Distinction|Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste]]'' (1979), the sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]] proposed that æsthetic taste (cultural judgement), derived from social class, in establishing definitions of high art by the practice of human activities such as [[etiquette|social etiquette]], [[gastronomy]], [[oenology]], [[military service]]. That in such activities of aesthetic judgement, the ruling-class person uses social codes unknown to middle- and the lower-class persons in the pursuit and practice activities of taste.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8538">The [[hoplite]]s were soldiers from [[Ancient Greece]] who were usually free citizens. They had a very uniform and distinct appearance; specifically they were armed with a [[spear]] (''[[dory]]'') in their right hand and a heavy round [[shield]] in their left.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hoplite soldiers were organized in battle into the "[[Phalanx|Phalanx formation]]". The goal of this formation was to create uniformity and a powerful military force in order to maximize the effectiveness as the army as a whole, rather than use people as individual fighters. With the hoplite formation everyone was the same in battle. The Phalanx formation appeared during the 7th and 8th centuries BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/180753601|title=War in human civilization|last=Azar.|first=Gat,|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199236633|location=Oxford|oclc=180753601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The representation of hoplites in art show historians how the Greeks used this formation in battle as well as how the soldiers were dressed and what their armor looked like. The hoplite formation is shown in different styles of pottery such as [[White ground technique|white ground]] and [[Black-figure pottery|black figure]] and also on many different types of pottery such an ''[[Typology of Greek Vase Shapes|olpe]]'', ''[[krater]],'' ''[[alabastron]]'', and ''[[dinos]]''. Across all depictions, hoplite soldiers wear the same armor and carry the same weapons in the same position. In addition, the aspect of uniformity is emphasized in these representations.

== Representations in art ==

=== Chigi Vase ===
[[File:Detail from the Chigi-vase.jpg|thumb|
Chigi Vase 650-640 BC
]]The [[Chigi vase|Chigi Vase]] is a [[Orientalizing period|Protocorinthian]] ''[[Typology of Greek Vase Shapes|olpe]]'' and was made by the Chigi Painter from 650-640 BC. The [[Chigi vase|Chigi Vase]] was discovered in an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] tomb at Monte Aguzzo. It is [[Black-figure pottery|black-figure]] style with an unusual use of [[Polychrome|polychromy]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cvaonline.org/tools/pottery/painters/keypieces/corinthian/chigi.htm|title=Greek vases 800-300 BC: key pieces - The Classical Art Research Centre|website=www.cvaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains the earliest known representation of the [[hoplite]] [[phalanx formation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hurwit|first=Jeffrey|date=2002|title=Reading the Chigi Vase|url=|journal=Hesperia: The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens|volume=71|pages=1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The vase shows the moment that the two hoplite formations come in contact in battle. Each soldier is armed with a decorative round shield in their left hand and a long spear in their right as well as a helmet. Behind the soldiers is a flute player that may have been used to keep the hoplites marching correctly. The [[Chigi vase]] is arguably one of the most important representations of the Hoplite Soldier in [[Ancient Greek art|Greek Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/745332893|title=Greek art and archaeology : a new history, c. 2500-c. 150 BCE|last=T.,|first=Neer, Richard|isbn=9780500288771|location=New York|oclc=745332893}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chigi Vase gives historians as insight to how the phalanx formation was used in battle.

=== Terracotta Alabastron ===
[[File:Terracotta alabastron (perfume vase) MET DP119906.jpg|thumb|Terracotta alabastron 590–570 BC]]
This Middle [[Corinthia]]n perfume vase from 590–570 BC contains two friezes of the [[Phalanx|hoplite phalanx]]. The [[terracotta]] vase uses a form of [[Black-figure pottery|black figure]] and is only 21.3&amp;nbsp;cm in height. Both friezes show hoplites with a circular shield in their left hand, spear in their right, as well as a typical hoplite helmet. All of the hoplites are faced in the same way and have about the same distance in between their feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Terracotta alabastron (perfume vase)|date=ca. 590–570 B.C.|url=https://metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/247192|accessdate=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could reflect the state of uniformity and the lack of individualism within hoplite warfare. The top frieze is interrupted by another figure who does not resemble a hoplite soldier. The rest of the vase is decorated with lines and dots, creating zones on the vase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amyx, Darrell A. 1988. Corinthian Vase-Painting of the Archaic Period. no. 4, p. 156, Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.|first=Darrell|date=1988|title=Corinthian Vase-Painting of the Archaic Period|url=|journal=University of California Press|volume=4|pages=156|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hoplite black figure Dinos  ===
This Attic black figure [[Dinos]] now located in [[Louvre|Musée du Louvre]] in [[Paris]] was made by "The Louvre Painter" in 560 BC. It contains three friezes. The first depicts [[Troilus|Troilos]] and Polyxena at the fountain, a  Centauromachy, the return of [[Hephaestus|Hephaistos]], and a [[symposium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Louvre%20E%20876&amp;object=Vase|title=Louvre E 876 (Vase)|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The middle frieze shows a [[Phalanx|hoplite phalanx]], and the bottom frieze shows a horse race. The frieze with the hoplites shows two hoplite formations engaging in battle. The hoplite in front of the first phalanx advances to the left over a body. Another hoplite extends his arm as he leans to throw he spear to the warrior in front of him. The warriors on foot all possess typical characteristics of hoplites with their spear and round shield as well as their helmet. In addition the hoplites are close to each other in proximity which is a feature of the [[Phalanx|phalanx formation]].

=== Attic Black-Figure Calyx Krater ===
[[File:Hoplite fight from Athens Museum.jpg|thumb|
Attic Black-Figure Calyx Krater
]]This Calyx Krater was made in 530 BCE from [[Farsala|Pharsala]] and uses the [[Black-figure pottery|black figure]] stye. It is also painted  in the manner of [[Exekias]]. The [[Krater|Calyx Krater]]  depicts the scene a Four-horse [[chariot]] and a [[Homer]]ic battle around the body of a dead warrior, that might be [[Patroclus|Patroklos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.namuseum.gr/collections/vases/archaic/archaic14-en.html#|title=NATIONAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL MUSEUM OF ATHENS - OFFICIAL SITE|website=www.namuseum.gr|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main focus of the scene is on the two hoplites clashing in battle, behind each of them is a hoplite phalanx. This image gives insight into how two hoplite formations engaged in battle. The figures can be identified as hoplites because of their round [[Round shield|shield]] in their left hand as well as their spear in the right hand.

=== Dionysos with Satyr and Maenad Alabastron ===
The "[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Harvard+1920.44.54&amp;object=vase Dionysos with Satyr and Maenad Ababastron]" was made by the [[Haimon Painter|Haimon painter]] in 480 BC and it from the late [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]]. It is attic black figure and white ground. The lower frieze represents a  [[Gigantomachy]]. [[Heracles|Herakles]] and [[Athena]] fight five [[Giants (Greek mythology)|giants]], four of whom are represented as hoplites. The viewer can tell that the giants are hoplites because of the typical helmets, the round shield held in the left hand, and the spear in the right hand. One of the hoplite [[Giants (Greek mythology)|giants]] is on the ground to due to his fight with Athena. the others are attacking Herakles from behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Harvard+1920.44.54&amp;object=vase|title=Harvard 1920.44.54 (Vase)|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This work of art is an interesting take on the typical [[Giants (Greek mythology)|Gigantomachy]]. The representation of the hoplite formation in this period hints that the Greeks were still using this formation in warfare. In addition, this [[alabastron]] is an example of the combination of a mythological battle (the Gigantomachy) and aspects of real battles (the hoplite formation) that we see in other examples of Greek Art, specifically the [[Temple of Athena Nike]] on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Akropolis]] and the [[Stoa Poikile]] on the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Classical Agora]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3656">In [[literary criticism]], an '''idiot plot''' is "a plot which is kept in motion solely by virtue of the fact that everybody involved is an [[idiot]],"&lt;ref name="DK"&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Damon|authorlink=Damon Knight|year=1967|title=In Search of Wonder|location=Chicago|publisher=Advent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and where the story would otherwise be over if this were not the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/eberts-guide-to-practical-filmgoing-a-glossary-of-terms-for-the-cinema-of-the-80s | title = Movie glossary: Idiot plot | author = Roger Ebert | accessdate = 2011-02-10 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a narrative where its conflict comes from characters not recognizing, or not being told, key information that would resolve the [[conflict (narrative)|conflict]], often because of plot contrivance. The only thing that prevents the conflict's resolution is the character's constant avoidance or obliviousness of it throughout the plot, even if it was already obvious to the viewer, so the characters are all "idiots" in that they are too obtuse to simply resolve the conflict immediately.

Reviewing ''[[Prime (film)|Prime]]'' in 2005 critic [[Roger Ebert]] said "I can forgive and even embrace an Idiot Plot in its proper place (consider Astaire and Rogers in ''[[Top Hat]]''). But when the characters have depth and their decisions have consequences, I grow restless when their misunderstandings could be ended by words that the screenplay refuses to allow them to utter."&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051027/REVIEWS/510270305 | title = Movie reviews: Prime | author = Roger Ebert | accessdate = 2011-02-10 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternate formulations describe only the [[protagonist]] as being an idiot.

[[Science fiction]] writer and critic [[Damon Knight]], in his 1956 collection ''[[In Search of Wonder]]'', attributes the first use of the term to author [[James Blish]].&lt;ref name=DK/&gt; Knight went on to coin the term '''second-order idiot plot''', "in which not merely the principals, but everybody in the whole society has to be a grade-A idiot, or the story couldn't happen."&lt;ref name=DK/&gt;

Writing in 2013, author [[David Brin]] explored one variation of the idiot plot. In most adventure films and novels, the writers and directors have an imperative to keep their protagonists in jeopardy. This becomes difficult if they are surrounded by skilled professionals, paid to intervene and help if called. Hence, storytellers feel compelled to separate their characters from meaningful help, so that any assistance they receive is either late or else below the level of danger offered by the antagonists. The more powerful the villains, the more competent that help is allowed to be. "But for the most part, institutions and your neighbors are portrayed as sheep, so that only the hero's actions truly matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=David Brin |authorlink=David Brin |url=http://www.locusmag.com/Perspectives/2013/01/david-brin-our-favorite-cliche-a-world-filled-with-idiots-orwhy-films-and-novels-routinely-depict-society-and-its-citizens-as-fools/ |title=Our Favorite Cliché — A World Filled With Idiots…, or, Why Films and Novels Routinely Depict Society and its Citizens as Fools |publisher=Locusmag.com |date=2013-01-20 |accessdate=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Centre for Theatre Research''' sometimes also known as The International Centre for Theatre Creation was founded in 1970 by [[Peter Brook]] and [[Micheline Rozan]].  It is often abbreviated to the [[acronym]] CIRT as in French the group is called the Centre International de Recherche Théâtrale.  The centre is a multicultural theatrical research and production company based out of the [[Bouffes du Nord]] theatre in Paris since 1974.&lt;ref&gt;'''The Continuum Companion to Twentieth Century Theatre'', edited Colin Chambers, Continuum, 2002, {{ISBN|0-8264-4959-X}}, Page 384&lt;/ref&gt; The first three years of the company were taken up by exploring a fundamental theatrical question (see below)

== Funding ==
Brook had previously been sponsored for limited periods by [[Jean-Louis Barrault]] or the [[Royal Shakespeare Company|RSC]] (at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]]).  Brook and Rozan acquired sufficient funding to sustain Brook's work for three years.  Working with a core company and several visiting collaborators. 
A budget of $1 million was established: $100,000 to set up the organization, and $300,000 for each year from 1971-1973{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.  Money was raised from the French government and various international foundations ([[Ford Foundation]], [[Gulbenkian Foundation]] and [[Anderson Foundation]]s)
Money also came from the government of [[Iran]] in the form of a commission for a work at the [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]]/[[Persepolis]] festival in 1971. Work was begun even though the full three-year budget was not secured at the outset.

== First three-year journey ==
This multinational assembly of actors, dancers, musicians and other performers travelled widely in the Middle East and Africa in the early 1970s.  This was as a three-year 'pilgrimage' to answer the question "What were the common stories, the recognizable shorthands, the instant abstractions, the shared outlines of story and character with which an international group could work?"{{Fact|date=February 2007}}
On this three-year sojourn, they produced two major works ''[[Orghast]]'' I &amp; II, performed in 1971 at the [[Shiraz Arts Festival]] in Iran in the [[Achaemenid]] ruins of [[Persepolis]] and [[Naqsh-e Rostam]], and ''[[The Conference of Birds]]'' developed in [[West Africa]] and completed in 1974 at [[Brooklyn Academy of Music|BAM]] in Brooklyn, New York.

'''Jack Epps Jr.''' (born 1949) is an American [[screenwriter]], [[author]] and [[educator]], known chiefly for such popular 1980s films as ''[[Top Gun]]'',&lt;ref name=IMDB&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Epps Jr.|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0258390/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Legal Eagles]]'' and ''[[The Secret of My Success (1987 film)|The Secret of My Success]]'', which he wrote with longtime partner [[Jim Cash]]. Epps Jr. graduated from the College of Arts and Letters at [[Michigan State University]], and has since gone on to teach at [[the University of Southern California]].&lt;ref name="Cinema USC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Epps Jr.|url=http://cinema.usc.edu/directories/profile.cfm?id=6498&amp;first=&amp;last=&amp;title=&amp;did=67&amp;referer=%..|publisher=Cinema USC|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Epps Jr. came to California to become a director, but he did not have the money or know-how to do so. He decided to first write a script and to hope that this would lead to directing. Partnering with Anderson House, they sold a script to ''Hawaii Five-O''. He continued to work with House for a few years, before partnering with Jim Cash.&lt;ref name="Old School Blog"&gt;{{cite web|title=Back to the 80s: Interview with Jack Epps Jr. screenwriter of Top Gun &amp; more - Kickin' it Old School|url=http://oldschool.tblog.com/post/1970118087|publisher=Old School Blog|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Top Gun'' and later successes===
After completing seven unproduced screenplays together, Epps Jr. and Cash produced ''Top Gun''. This film went on to become the number-one worldwide box office hit in 1986. After this, they quickly wrote other screenplays that were produced, including ''[[Legal Eagles]]'' and ''[[The Secret of My Success (1987 film)|The Secret of my Success]]''. Epps co-authored over 25 screenplays and eight motion pictures that he produced well into the following decade, including ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'', ''[[Turner &amp; Hooch]]'' and ''[[Anaconda (film)|Anaconda]]''.&lt;ref name="Angels in the Sky Movie"&gt;{{cite web|title=JACK EPPS JR.|url=http://angelsintheskythemovie.com/the-talent-team/8-bios/14-jack-epps-jr|publisher=Angels in the Sky Movie|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote for some of the most successful actors in the industry including [[Tom Cruise]], [[Robert Redford]], [[Tom Hanks]], [[Warren Beatty]] and others.

==Teaching==
Epps Jr. is an Associate Professor and Chair of the Writing for Screen and Television Division in the School of Cinematic Arts.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomsbury.com/author/jack-epps-jr&lt;/ref&gt; Using techniques he had developed over his career and applied to classes, he authored a screenwriting manual, ''Screenwriting is Rewriting: The Art and Craft of Professional Revision'', in 2016.

==Awards and honors==
Epps Jr. was awarded on honorary doctorate of fine arts by Michigan State University at their 2009 commencement. He is also the recipient of the Michigan State University Spartans in Hollywood Award.&lt;ref name="Angels in the Sky Movie" /&gt; He is part of the Writer's Guild of America where he has been a member for three decades and he is a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

Her parents divorced in 1965, when she was seven years old, with her mother then taking care of the children by herself.

'''The Judgment of Paris''' is the theme of a mosaic from the early second century AD, discovered in 1932 in [[Antioch]].&lt;ref name=JdPselonMdL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/mosaic-judgment-paris|title=Mosaic of the Judgment of Paris|work=Department of Greek, Etruscan, and Roman Antiquities: Roman Art |publisher=Musée du Louvre, Paris|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is one of the most important mosaics from the ancient city, which was located a short distance from the site of modern [[Antakya|Antakya (''Antioch'')]].   The mosaic is normally housed in Paris at the [[Louvre]] (Ma 3443), although it has been known to go on tour.&lt;ref name=JdPselonMdL/&gt;   In 2007 it was scheduled to feature in an itinerant exhibition of important pieces that the Louvre organised in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=JdPselonMdA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arles-antique.cg13.fr/docs/ExpoParisArles.pdf|title=Exposition du 24 juin au 15 octobre 2006|author=ACRM-MAPA|publisher=Musée départemental Arles antique|date=June 2006|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mosaic is square in shape.   The sides are {{convert|1860|mm|in||abbr=on}} long.   Originally it was part of a large floor mosaic featuring five different images.   It formed the floor of the dining room in a large [[:de:Atriumhaus|Atrium house]].   The Judgment of Paris was the central and largest image, with two others on each side.  The other four are housed in other museums as follows:&lt;ref name=JdPselonMdL/&gt;
* "The Drinking Contest of Hercules" ([[Worcester Art Museum]])
* "Aphrodite and Adonis (The Art Museum, [[Princeton University]])
* "Dancing [[Maenad]]" ([[Baltimore Museum of Art]])
* "Dancing [[Satyr]]" ([[Baltimore Museum of Art]])

The mosaic depicts the Judgment of Paris, one in a series of incidents which led to the [[Trojan War]].   [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] is shown seated in the middle of the scene, where he is required to determine which of the three goddesses, [[Hera]], [[Athena]] or [[Aphrodite]], is the most beautiful.   The goddesses stand to the right.   Over on the left [[Hermes]] watches:  above him [[Psyche (psychology)|Psyche]] looks on from a rock, while on the right side, above and behind the divine contestants, [[Eros]] looks down from the top of an appropriately positioned pillar.   The composition is framed with a rich floral pattern in which vine leaves feature prominently.&lt;ref name=JdPselonMdA/&gt;

The archeologist-scholar [[Doro Levi]] saw a certain [[Impressionism|impressionistic effect]] in the work, especially in respect of the interplay between the light and the shadows.  "The Judgment of Paris" was a popular theme in antiquity.  Around six examples have been identified among the [[:de:Römische Wandmalerei|wall paintings]] at [[Pompeii]].   Only two other surviving mosaic depictions have been found, however.   These are on [[Kos]] and at [[Casariche]] in Spain.&lt;ref name=JdPsegunCas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casariche.es/?page_id=469|title=Mosaico Juicio de Paris|publisher=Ayuntamiento de Casariche (Sevilla)|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!---

Insgesamt hatte das Mosaik, das einst 7.2 × 4.8 m groß war, fünf Bilderfelder.

It measures 138&amp;nbsp;cm × 138&amp;nbsp;cm and is made of oil and gold on canvas, showing elaborate and complex ornamentation as seen in [[Jugendstil]]. Klimt was a member of the [[Vienna Secession]], a group of artists that broke away from the traditional way of painting. Adele Bloch-Bauer, in her will, asked her husband to donate the Klimt paintings to the [[Österreichische Galerie Belvedere|Austrian State Gallery]] upon his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adele.at/Klage_von__Dr__Stefan_Gulner_m/Vorgelegte_Urkunden/Testament_vom_19_1_1923_von_Ad/testament_vom_19_1_1923_von_ad.html |title=Last Will 1923 |publisher=Adele.at |date=January 19, 1923 |accessdate=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She died in 1925 from meningitis.

| [[File:Raphael missing.jpg|200px]] || [[Portrait of a Young Man (Raphael)|''Portrait of a Young Man'']] by [[Raphael]] || 1940s || [[Poland]] || ''Portrait of a Young Man'' is a painting in oil on [[panel painting|panel]], probably from 1513 to 1514, by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[High Renaissance]] [[Old Master]] painter and architect Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino better known simply as [[Raphael]].&lt;ref name="houpt49"&gt;Houpt, Simon ''et al.'' (2006). ''Museum of the Missing,'' p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting was plundered by the [[Nazi]]s in [[Poland]]. The subject's identity is unverified, but many scholars have traditionally regarded it as Raphael's [[self-portrait]]. The facial features are perceived by specialists as compatible with, if not clearly identical to, the only undoubted self-portrait by Raphael in his [[fresco]] ''[[The School of Athens]]'' at the Vatican, identified as such by [[Vasari]]. If it is a self-portrait, no hint is given of Raphael's profession; the portrait shows a richly dressed and "confidently-poised" young man.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Roger ''et al.'' (1983). ''Raphael'', p. 170–171.&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent times, a book about [[Nazi plunder]] by [[Lynn H. Nicholas]] and a documentary film by the same title, ''[[The Rape of Europa (book)|The Rape of Europa]]'', suggested that if the painting were to reappear today, it would be worth in excess of US$100M.|| $100,000,000&lt;ref&gt;[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]: [https://www.pbs.org/therapeofeuropa/  ''The Rape of Europa.''], 2006 film, aired November 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;|| Falsely reported to have been found 1 August 2012, the location is still unknown.

The '''Los Angeles Women's Music Festival''' was a 2007 [[Los Angeles]] based summer [[music festival]] that featured exclusively female solo artists and female-led bands.

==Overview==
In 2007, Los Angeles based female musicians [[Gayle Day]], [[Miria (singer)]], [[Gilli Moon]] and Toni Koch, in partnership with [[Warrior Girl Music]], [[SheJay]], and [[Adventure Art Entertainment]], produced the first women's music festival in Los Angeles. Inspired by [[Lilith Fair]] and held at Woodley Park (CA), home of WorldFest (LA), Los Angeles' largest Earth Day festival, the Los Angeles Women's Music Festival was an eco-music-fest featuring over 65 bands on 5 solar-powered stages, offering vegan, vegetarian and organic refreshments, and featuring pet adoptions, and was attended by over 2500 people. The Los Angeles Women's Music Festival also donated a percentage of proceeds to Los Angeles animal rescue groups. The festival was started in 2007 as an annual festival but was on hiatus during 2008 and was scheduled to return in 2009, although the latter event never materialized. As of 2015, it is on indefinite hiatus due to financial challenges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawmf.com/about.html Los Angeles Women’s Music Festival official website: About] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517125648/http://www.lawmf.com/about.html |date=2008-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myspace.com/lawmf07 MySpace: Los Angeles Women’s Music Festival Newsletter - Vol. 1 Issue 1 - March 8, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/218388/ Yahoo!

[[File:Marie Aspioti at her desk.jpg|thumb|250px|Marie Aspioti at her desk]]
'''Maria-Aspasia (Marie) Aspioti''' (29 September 1909 – 25 May 2000),&lt;ref name="National Centre of the Book"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lillios2004"/&gt; was a distinguished Corfiote writer, playwright,&lt;ref name="National Centre of the Book"/&gt; poet, magazine publisher and cultural figure who influenced the literary and cultural life of post-war [[Corfu]].&lt;ref name="Potts2010"/&gt; She published the magazine ''Prosperos'' between the years 1949–1954, and ''Lear's Corfu'' in 1965.&lt;ref name="Potts2010"/&gt; She was a close friend of [[Lawrence Durrell]] and had been awarded an [[MBE]].&lt;ref name="Lillios2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Henderson1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="José Ruiz Mas"/&gt;

==Life==
[[File:Aspioti Mansion Villa Rossa in Corfu.jpg|thumb|The Aspioti Mansion in Corfu]]
Aspioti was born into a wealthy family who lived in the ''Villa Rosa'' mansion in a suburb of the old town of Corfu. She was the daughter of Konstantinos Aspiotis, a man who became wealthy by mass-producing, in his [[printing shop]], a kind of exclusive [[playing cards]] illustrated by his grandfather Nikolaos Aspiotis who was a painter. Eventually his company moved to Athens and became ''[[Aspioti-ELKA]]'', a well-known printing and publishing company and one of the largest of its kind in Greece.&lt;ref name="National Centre of the Book"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Program1995"/&gt;

In 1930 Marie Aspioti published the book ''Corfu'' in French in co-operation with French writer René Puaux. Lawrence Durrell in the introduction of his publication ''Lear's Corfu'' in 1965 mentions: {{quotation| She is, I think, the first Greek friend I made and as a girl in her twenties she wrote a book about Corfu in French which was the first study of the island to fall into my hands. Indeed her knowledge is as comprehensive as her scholarship is scrupulous and unobtrusive.&lt;ref name="Lillios2004"/&gt;}}

During World War II she became a volunteer nurse at the Corfu General Hospital. In January 1950 she published the magazine ''Prosperos, editions of Art and Literature of the British Council'', inspired by Lawrence Durrell's work ''Prospero's Cell''.&lt;ref name="National Centre of the Book"/&gt;

In Corfu she was the director of the Corfu Branch of the [[British Council]] from 1946 to 1955,&lt;ref name="Lillios2004"/&gt; and was a family friend of [[Prince Philip]].&lt;ref name="Osler2011"/&gt; In 1955 she resigned her position as the director of the British Council in protest against the British policies in Cyprus against [[enosis]] in trying to suppress Cypriot self-determination. At the same time she returned to the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] the MBE she had received.&lt;ref name="Lillios2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="José Ruiz Mas"/&gt; She also accused Durrell of betraying his [[philhellenism]] for a few coins.&lt;ref name="José Ruiz Mas"/&gt;

She also wrote poems and theatrical plays. In 1956 her first theatrical play ''O Κουρσεμένος Γάμος'' (''The Pirated Wedding'') was performed in Corfu. Her other literary works were published in ''Prosperos'' magazine and other publications in Corfu.&lt;ref name="National Centre of the Book"/&gt;

Later in life, Marie Aspiotis could no longer afford to maintain her ''Villa Rosa'' mansion and although the building became dilapidated she continued living there with her mother.&lt;ref name="Tennant2001"/&gt;

[[File:Melpomene (by Joseph Fagnani).jpg|thumb|''Melpomene'' by [[Joseph Fagnani]] (1819–1873) (1869)]]

'''Melpomene''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɛ|l|ˈ|p|ɒ|m|ᵻ|n|iː}}; {{lang-grc|[[wikt:Μελπομένη#Ancient Greek|Μελπομένη]]|Melpoménē|to sing' or 'the one that is melodious}}), initially the [[Muse]] of Chorus, she then became the '''Muse of Tragedy''', for which she is best known now.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Blyth |first=Charles |title=Virgilian Tragedy and [[Troilus]] |publisher= [[The Chaucer Review]] |date=1990 |volume=24 |number=3 |pages=211-218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her name was derived from the Greek verb melpô or melpomai meaning "to celebrate with dance and song." She is often represented with a tragic mask and wearing the [[cothurnus]], boots traditionally worn by tragic actors. Often, she also holds a knife or club in one hand and the tragic mask in the other.

Melpomene is the daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Mnemosyne]]. Her sisters include [[Calliope]] (muse of epic poetry), [[Clio]] (muse of history), [[Euterpe]] (muse of lyrical poetry), [[Terpsichore]] (muse of dancing), [[Erato]] (muse of erotic poetry), [[Thalia (muse)|Thalia]] (muse of comedy), [[Polyhymnia]] (muse of hymns), and [[Urania]] (muse of astronomy).  She is also the mother of several of the [[Siren (mythology)#List of Sirens|Sirens]], the divine handmaidens of [[Persephone|Kore (Persephone/Proserpina)]] who were cursed by her mother, [[Demeter]]/[[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], when they were unable to prevent the kidnapping of Kore (Persephone/[[Proserpina]]) by [[Hades]]/[[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]].  

In Roman and Greek poetry, it was traditional{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} to invoke the goddess Melpomene so that one might create beautiful lyrical phrases (see [[Horace's Odes]]).

Specifically, the theorem says that if the action has an infinite-dimensional [[Lie algebra]] of infinitesimal symmetries parameterized linearly by ''k'' arbitrary functions and their derivatives up to order ''m'', then the [[functional derivative]]s of ''L'' satisfy a system of ''k'' differential equations.

Noether's second theorem is sometimes used in [[gauge theory]].  Gauge theories are the basic elements of all modern [[field theory (physics)|field theories]] of physics, such as the prevailing [[Standard Model]].

'''The ''Racławice Panorama''''' (Polish: ''Panorama racławicka'') is a monumental (15 × 114 meter) [[cyclorama|cycloramic]] [[painting]] depicting the [[Battle of Racławice]], during the [[Kościuszko Uprising]]. It is located in [[Wrocław]], [[Poland]]. The painting is one of only a few preserved relics of a genre of 19th-century mass culture, and the oldest in Poland. The panorama stands in a circular fashion and, with the viewer in the center, presents different scenes at various viewing angles. A special kind of perspective used in the painting and additional effects (lighting, artificial terrain) create a feeling of reality.

== History ==
[[File:Lwow Panorama Raclawicka.jpg|thumb|Former location in [[Lviv]]]]
[[File:RotundaPanoramyRaclawickiej.jpg|thumb|Current location in [[Wrocław]]]]

The idea came from the painter [[Jan Styka]] in [[Lviv]] who invited the renowned battle-painter [[Wojciech Kossak]] to participate in the project.&lt;ref&gt;Józef Piątek, Małgorzata Dolistowska, "Panorama racławicka", Wrocław 1988, {{ISBN|83-04-02757-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were assisted by [[Ludwik Boller]], [[Tadeusz Popiel]], [[Zygmunt Rozwadowski]], [[Teodor Axentowicz]], [[Włodzimierz Tetmajer]], [[Wincenty Wodzinowski]] and [[Michał Sozański]].

The project was conceived as a patriotic commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the victorious Battle of Racławice, a famous episode of the Kościuszko Insurrection, a heroic but ultimately failed attempt to defend Polish independence. The battle was fought on 4 April 1794 between the insurrectionist force of regulars and peasant volunteers ([[Kosynierzy|armed with scythes]]) under Kościuszko (1746–1817) himself and the [[Russia]]n army commanded by General [[Alexander Tormasov]]. For the nation which had lost its independence, the memory of this glorious victory was particularly important.

The National Exhibition, organized in Lviv in 1894, offered an excellent opportunity to realize Styka’s idea. Canvas, woven to order, was bought in Brussels, the specially built rotunda’s iron structure (designed by Ludwik Ramułt) in [[Vienna]]. The rotunda, located in Stryjski Park in Lviv, was ready in July 1893. The huge panorama painting was executed within 9 months, between August 1893 and May 1894. The official opening was on 5 June 1894. Since the very beginning, Panorama of the Battle of Racławice attracted enormous attention and brought crowds of tourists to Lviv. On average 75 000 viewers visited it every year.&lt;ref&gt;Romuald Nowak "Panorama racławicka", Muzeum Narodowe we Wrocławiu 1999/2010, {{ISBN|978-83-86766-41-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], the painting was brought to Wrocław (formerly Breslau in Germany) along with a part of the collection of the Ossoliński Institution. As under the [[Communist]] regime the subject was considered politically sensitive, the efforts to have the canvas restored and exhibited, undertaken by successive Volunteer Committees, were successful only after August 1980. Reopened on 14 June 1985, the major attraction of the old Lviv has immediately become the main tourist attraction of Wrocław. Here, contemporary viewers have an opportunity to participate in a unique illusionist spectacle.

==Notable visitors==

Among the many guests who have visited the panorama are [[Pope John Paul II]]; [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Beatrix, the Queen of the Netherlands]]; [[Czesław Miłosz]], winner of the 1980 [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] visited Racławice panorama 8 September 1894 and said "Imposant. Es hat mich frappirt."&lt;ref&gt;Józef Piątek, Małgorzata Dolistowska, "Panorama racławicka", Wrocław 1988, {{ISBN|83-04-02757-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen]] said about this painting, "This is the most beautiful panorama I have ever seen."&lt;ref&gt;Józef Piątek, Małgorzata Dolistowska, "Panorama racławicka", Wrocław 1988, {{ISBN|83-04-02757-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kepler-solar-system-2.png|thumb|upright|Inner section of Kepler's [[Platonic solid]] model of planetary spacing in the [[Solar System]] from ''[[Mysterium Cosmographicum]]'' (1596)]]

'''Sacred geometry''' ascribes symbolic and [[Sacred|sacred meanings]] to certain geometric shapes and certain geometric [[Proportion (architecture)|proportions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.geometry/unit5/unit5.html dartmouth.edu: Paul Calter, ''Polygons, Tilings, &amp; Sacred Geometry'']&lt;/ref&gt; It is associated with the belief that a god is the geometer of the world. The geometry used in the design and construction of [[sacred architecture|religious structures]] such as [[Church (building)|churches]], [[temple]]s, [[mosque]]s, religious [[monuments]], [[altar]]s, and [[church tabernacle|tabernacles]] has sometimes been considered sacred. The concept applies also to sacred spaces such as [[temenos|temenoi]], [[sacred grove]]s, [[village green]]s and [[holy well]]s, and the creation of [[sacred art|religious art]].

==As worldview and cosmology==
{{further|Mathematics and art}}

The belief that a god created the universe according to a geometric plan has ancient origins. [[Plutarch]] attributed the belief to [[Plato]], writing that "Plato said god geometrizes continually" (''Convivialium disputationum'', liber 8,2). In modern times, the mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] adapted this quote, saying "God arithmetizes".&lt;ref&gt;Cathérine Goldstein, Norbert Schappacher, Joachim Schwermer, ''The shaping of arithmetic'',  [https://books.google.com/books?id=IUFTcOsMTysC&amp;pg=PA235 p. 235].&lt;/ref&gt;

As late as [[Johannes Kepler]] (1571–1630), a belief in the geometric underpinnings of the cosmos persisted among some scientists.&lt;ref name=Calter&gt;{{cite web |last1=Calter |first1=Paul |title=Celestial Themes in Art &amp; Architecture |url=https://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.geometry/unit10/unit10.html |publisher=[[Dartmouth College]] |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural forms==
{{further|Patterns in nature}}

[[File:NautilusCutawayLogarithmicSpiral.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Nautilus]]'' shell's [[logarithm]]ic growth spiral]]

According to [[Stephen Skinner (author)|Stephen Skinner]], the study of sacred geometry has its roots in the study of nature, and the [[Fibonacci number|mathematical principles]] at work therein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Skinner |first=Stephen |title=Sacred Geometry: Deciphering the Code |publisher=Sterling |date=2009 |isbn=978-1-4027-6582-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[patterns in nature|forms observed in nature]] can be related to geometry; for example, the [[chambered nautilus]] grows at a constant rate and so its shell forms a [[logarithmic spiral]] to accommodate that growth without changing shape. Also, [[honeybee]]s construct hexagonal cells to hold their honey.  These and other correspondences are sometimes interpreted in terms of sacred geometry and considered to be further proof of the natural significance of geometric forms.

==Art and architecture==
{{further|Mathematics and architecture|Mathematics and art|Islamic geometric patterns}}

Geometric ratios, and geometric figures were often employed in the designs of ancient [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|Egyptian]], ancient Indian, [[Architecture of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Roman architecture|Roman]] architecture. Medieval European cathedrals also incorporated symbolic geometry. Indian and Himalayan spiritual communities often constructed temples and [[fortification]]s on design plans of [[mandala]] and [[yantra]].

Many of the sacred geometry principles of the human body and of ancient architecture were compiled into the [[Vitruvian Man]] drawing by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. The latter drawing was itself based on the much older writings of the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]].

[[Islamic geometric patterns]] are well known too, which are used in the Qu'ran, Mosques and even in the caligraphies of personal names.

===In Hinduism===

[[File:Mandala.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Hindu]] [[Mandala|Maṇḍala]]]]

The [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agamas]] are a collection of Sanskrit,&lt;ref name=Grimes&gt;Grimes, John A. (1996). ''A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English''. State University of New York Press. {{ISBN|9780791430682}}. LCCN 96012383. [https://books.google.com/books?id=eP5p0ev3nJEC]&lt;/ref&gt; Tamil, and [[Grantha script|Grantha]]&lt;ref name=NagalingamCh1&gt;Nagalingam, Pathmarajah (2009). ''The Religion of the Agamas''. Siddhanta Publications. [http://www.siddha.com.my/forum/religionoftheagamas/chapter1.html]&lt;/ref&gt; scriptures chiefly constituting the methods of temple construction and creation of idols, worship means of deities, philosophical doctrines, meditative practices, attainment of sixfold desires, and four kinds of yoga.&lt;ref name=Grimes/&gt;

Elaborate rules are laid out in the Agamas for Shilpa (the art of [[sculpture]]) describing the quality requirements of such matters as the places where temples are to be built, the kinds of image to be installed, the materials from which they are to be made, their dimensions, proportions, air circulation, and lighting in the temple complex. The [[Manasara]] and Silpasara are works that deal with these rules. The rituals of daily worship at the temple also follow rules laid out in the Agamas.

=== In European Religious Architecture ===
The construction of Medieval European cathedrals was often based on geometries intended to make the viewer see the world through mathematics, and through this understanding, gain a better understanding of the divine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Petersen|first=Toni|title=A(rt and) A(rchitecture) T(hesaurus)|date=2003|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.article.t000037|work=Oxford Art Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These churches frequently featured a [[Latin Cross]] floor-plan.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=CUMMINGS|first=L.A.|title=A RECURRING GEOMETRICAL PATTERN IN THE EARLY RENAISSANCE IMAGINATION|date=1986|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-033986-3.50067-7|work=Symmetry|pages=981–997|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080339863|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the beginning of the Renaissance in Europe, views shifted to favor simple and regular geometries. The circle in particular became a central and symbolic shape for the base of buildings, as it represented the perfection of nature and the centrality of man's place in the universe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The use of the circle and other simple and symmetrical geometric shapes was solidified as a staple of Renaissance religious architecture in [[Leon Battista Alberti]]'s architectural treatise, which described the ideal church in terms of spiritual geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/981109542|title=Architectural principles in the age of humanism.|last=Rudolf.|first=Wittkower,|date=1998|publisher=Academy Editions|isbn=0471977632|oclc=981109542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unanchored geometry==
[[Stephen Skinner (author)|Stephen Skinner]] discusses the tendency of some writers to place a geometric diagram over virtually any image of a natural object or human created structure, find some lines intersecting the image and declare it based on sacred geometry. If the geometric diagram does not intersect major physical points in the image, the result is what Skinner calls "unanchored geometry".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CG0EeHGl_dQC&amp;pg=PA91 Stephen Skinner, ''Sacred geometry: deciphering the code'', p91]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Staatsoper Hannover''' is a German [[opera house]] and [[opera]] company in [[Hanover]].  Its season runs from September to June.

The home base of Staatsoper Hannover is a theater built in classical style between 1845 and 1852 based on a plan drawn by [[Georg Ludwig Friedrich Laves]]. The building was badly damaged in [[World War II]] and rebuilt in 1948. In 1985, the [[acoustics]] were improved, and between 1996 and 1998 the stage facilities were renovated.

The current ''Intendant'' (superintendent) of the company is Michael Klügl.  Since 2011, conductor [[Karen Kamensek]] has served as ''[[Generalmusikdirektor]]in'' (General Music Director, GMD) of the company, the first American and the first woman to hold the post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/karen-kamensek-dirigentin-eine-frauenquote-in-der-musik-unmoeglich-a-742728.html | title=Karen Kamensek, Dirigentin: "Eine Frauenquote in der Musik?

The '''Teatro Alfieri''' was a major theatre and opera house in 18th and 19th century [[Florence]], located at Via dell'Ulivo #6 corner Via Pietrapiana in the [[Florence]], region of Tuscany, Italy. 

==History==
It was constructed originally in 1740 by members of the ''Accademia dei Risoluti''. At that time it was known as the ''Teatro di Santa Maria'' (the name of a nearby street) or the ''Teatro Risoluti''. The theatre underwent extensive reconstruction and enlargement in 1828, supervised by the architect [[Vittorio Bellini]] (1798 - 1860).&lt;ref&gt;Sistema Archivistico Nazionale. [http://www.san.beniculturali.it/web/san/dettaglio-soggetto-produttore?id=8578 "Bellini, Vittorio, architetto, (Firenze 1798 - 1860)"]. Retrieved 18 December 2013 {{it}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It re-opened as the Teatro Alfieri, named in honour of the playwright [[Vittorio Alfieri]].

In its heyday, the theatre interior decorations were elaborate, was used for both prose drama and operas. In the late 19th century and early 20th centuries, it also became known as a performance venue for plays written in the [[Florentine dialect]]. The theatre was demolished in 1928 when the Fascist government of Florence re-developed the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Santa Croce]] district.&lt;ref&gt;Garlington, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Adoration of the Kings''''' is a large [[panel painting|oil-on-oak]] painting by [[Jan Gossaert]] (born Jean Gossart, also known as Jan Mabuse), dated to 1510–15, depicting the [[Adoration of the Magi]].  Although Gossaert's name is signed on the border of [[Biblical Magi#Names|Balthazar]]'s richly embroidered headdress, and on a collar worn by Balthazar's turbaned attendant, the painting was occasionally attributed to [[Albrecht Dürer]] in the 17th and 18th centuries.  In 2010, Ainsworth suggested that the work was a collaboration between Gossaert and [[Gerard David]].

==Painting==
In the centre of the painting, the [[Madonna and child]] sit in the ruins of a building, receiving a gift from the kneeling [[Biblical Magi#Names|Caspar]] to the right; the Christ-child holds a gold coin in his left hand, almost as if he were offering Caspar a [[communion wafer]].  Six shepherds, an ass and a cow watch from behind, with a grey-bearded [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] – depicted in a bright red robe, contrasting with Mary's traditional garb of deep blue – standing behind a column to the left.  More shepherds and their flock are barely visible in the distance.

To the right of Caspar stands [[Biblical Magi#Names|Melchior]] holding aloft his gift, accompanied by four attendants, with more attendants approaching from the distance on horseback.  Balthazar stands to the left with his gift and three attendants.  Balthazar's richly decorated crown is inscribed with his name at its peak and Gossaert's name towards the bottom; Gossaert's name also appears on a collar worn by Balthazar's turbaned black attendant.  Further left, two more attendants in exotic dress watch from a window.

Nine angels (perhaps representing the [[Christian angelic hierarchy|nine orders of angels]]) look down through the structure of the ruined building, one holding a scroll bearing the words "[[Gloria in excelsis deo|Gloria in excelcis deo]]".  A bird – symbolising the [[Holy Spirit]] – hovers above, while the [[Star of Bethlehem]] shines brightly at the top of the painting.  Several babies appear as decorative details, in the architectural frieze and the capitals, and on the golden vessel for Balthazar's gift.  A tenth angel – possibly a self-portrait of Gossaert – is barely visible, in a doorway behind the ox.

==Technical details and composition==
The work was painted on a wooden panel consisting of six oak boards, laid vertically, measuring {{convert|177.2|cm|in}} high by {{convert|161.8|cm|in}} wide.  The paint was applied to a ground of chalk fixed with animal glue, with a thin [[primer (paint)|priming]] layer of [[lead white]] mixed with a little [[lead-tin-yellow]].  There is much [[underdrawing]], visible in some areas due to the paint having become more transparent.  A number of details were added at a late stage, over areas previously painted, including the two figures at the window to the left; the ox and the ass; the two shepherds behind the ass and the shepherds in the distance; Joseph's stick; Caspar's sceptre and the lid of Caspar's goblet.

Gossaert's composition draws from several sources.  It takes its main inspiration from the [[Monforte altarpiece]] by [[Hugo van der Goes]] (Gemäldegalerie, [[Staatliche Museen]], Berlin), which has a similar grouping of richly dressed Mary and [[Biblical Magi|Magi]] among ruined architecture, with their attendants and bystanders, and glimpses of the landscape behind and angels above.  The two dogs in the foreground, on a floor with many broken tiles, are copied from other engravings: one taken from the lower right corner of Dürer's engraving of [[Saint Eustace]] and the second is a reflection of the dog in an engraving of the "Adoration of the Kings" by [[Martin Schongauer]].  Other elements are drawn from other prints by Schongauer and Dürer.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==History==
The origins of the painting are unclear.  It may have been commissioned by [[David of Burgundy]], [[Archdiocese of Utrecht (695–1580)|Bishop of Utrecht]] from 1456 to 1496, or his half-brother, [[Philip of Burgundy (bishop)|Philip of Burgundy]], who was Bishop from 1517 to 1524. Lorne Campbell argues that the painting was commissioned by [[Daniel van Boechout]], Lord of Boerlare and Beverweerd, as the altarpiece of the [[Lady Chapel]] of the [[Benedictine]] Abbey of St Adrian in [[Geraardsbergen]], in East Flanders, south of Ghent and west of Brussels, where it first enters the historical record in 1600. It was bought by the rulers of the [[Habsburg Netherlands]], [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Albert]] and [[Isabella Clara Eugenia|Isabella]], in 1601, who had seen it at the abbey the previous year.  They paid £2,100 to the abbot, and moved the painting to become the altar of the chapel of their palace in Brussels.  The palace was destroyed by a fire in February 1731, but the chapel and its contents survived.  The chapel was demolished in the 1770s, but the painting had already been removed by the Governor of the [[Austrian Netherlands]], [[Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine|Charles of Lorraine]]. It was sold after Charles' death in 1781 to Emmanuel-Marie de Cock, [[Pensionary]] of Brussels and Greffier-Pensionary of the [[States of Brabant]].

A painting matching its description came to London in 1787 and was sold at an auction held in London by [[John Greenwood (artist)|John Greenwood]] the following year. It came into the possession of art dealer [[Michael Bryan (art historian)|Michael Bryan]] by 1795, and was sold to [[Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle]], who displayed it at [[Castle Howard]]. It was restored in 1884 by William Morrill, and then moved to [[Naworth Castle]].

[[George Howard, 9th Earl of Carlisle]] served as a Trustee of the [[National Gallery]] for more than 30 years, and offered to sell the painting to the National Gallery shortly before his death in 1911.  His widow honoured his wishes, and the painting was bought by the gallery later in 1911.  The £40,000 purchase price was funded by an advance of the gallery's annual purchase grant and other gallery funds, with contributions from [[The Art Fund]], [[Edward Tennant, 1st Baron Glenconner]], [[Edward Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh]], [[Alfred de Rothschild]], and [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|George Curzon, Earl (later Marquess) Curzon of Kedleston]].  The gallery published a monograph by [[Maurice W. Brockwell]] to commemorate the acquisition – the first such publication by the gallery.

Copies are held by the [[Museo Nacional de San Carlos]] in Mexico City, the [[Wittelsbacher Ausgleichfonds]] in Munich, the church of St John the Baptist in Nethen, the [[National Gallery in Prague]], and the [[Tula Art Museum]].

'''Tiffany "Pennsatucky" Doggett''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] in the [[Netflix]] series ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]'', portrayed by [[Taryn Manning]]. Manning was offered the role without needing to audition. The character of Doggett is based on a real-life prisoner, a "young woman from western [[Pennsylvania]] who proudly called herself a [[redneck]]".&lt;ref name="Salon1"/&gt; She is originally from [[Waynesboro, Virginia]]. Prior to her imprisonment, she is shown to be exchanging sexual favors for soda or money. Doggett is also known to have had five [[abortion]]s. She is charged with shooting an abortion doctor and decides to hire a [[Christianity|Christian]] lawyer; the ensuing support she receives from Christian groups leads to Doggett's becoming a [[born-again Christian]].

Doggett makes her first appearance in Season 1, episode 5 and initially is the main [[antagonist]] but becomes a protagonist in later seasons. In her debut episode, she unsuccessfully attempts to hang up a cross in the prison chapel and expresses [[homophobia|homophobic]] views. She conflicts with [[Alex Vause]] and [[Piper Chapman]] throughout the first season. In the second season, Doggett's storyline revolves around her friendships with [[List of Orange Is the New Black characters#Sam Healy|Sam Healy]] and Carrie "Big Boo" Black. This friendship with Big Boo continues into the third season. Big Boo comforts Doggett when the latter is feeling remorse for her abortions and when she is raped by a [[prison officer|correctional officer]]. The character Doggett and her storylines have received mixed reviews from critics, though Manning's performance has received critical acclaim.

==Creation and casting==

Tiffany Doggett's nickname "Pennsatucky" is derived from [[Pennsyltucky]]; a slang term for the rural portions of [[Pennsylvania]]. The author, [[Piper Kerman]], of the book, ''[[Orange Is the New Black: My Year in a Women's Prison]]'',  which inspired ''Orange is the New Black'' describes the real life version of Pennsatucky as "a young woman from western Pennsylvania who proudly called herself a redneck".&lt;ref name="Salon1"/&gt; Kerman further describes her as someone addicted to [[crack cocaine]] and dealing with the loss of custody of her child.&lt;ref name="Salon1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/07/05/we_still_dont_know_how_to_talk_about_pennsatucky_the_reality_of_rural_sexual_assault_and_how_class_plays_out_in_orange_is_the_new_black/|title=We still don't know how to talk about Pennsatucky: The reality of rural sexual assault and how class plays out in "Orange Is the New Black"|last=Eisenberg|first=Emma|date=July 5, 2015|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|accessdate=December 5, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029031434/http://www.salon.com/2015/07/05/we_still_dont_know_how_to_talk_about_pennsatucky_the_reality_of_rural_sexual_assault_and_how_class_plays_out_in_orange_is_the_new_black/ |archivedate=October 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Taryn Manning]], already an established actress, did not have to audition for the role of Doggett and was offered it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.enstarz.com/articles/77036/20150330/orange-is-the-new-black-season-3-release-taryn-manning-finds-playing-pennsatucky-morally-conflicting-video.htm|title='Orange Is the New Black' Season 3 Release: Taryn Manning Finds Playing Pennsatucky 'Morally Conflicting'?

==Storylines==

===Season 1===

[[File:Taryn Manning at Paley Fest Orange Is The New Black crop.png|thumb|left|upright|Manning was described by critic Horatia Harrod as "brilliantly unhinged" in her portrayal of Doggett.&lt;ref name="Harrod1"/&gt;]]

Following the release of the first season of ''Orange is the New Black'', Doggett received some criticism from different media. Writing for ''[[The American Conservative]]'', B. D. McClay claimed that Doggett was a poor and inaccurate representation of American Christians; "Pennsatucky is such an aggressively terrible character" and "her faith is neither well-understood nor well-drawn".&lt;ref name="AmCon1"/&gt; Laura Leonard of ''[[Christianity Today]]'', supports Clay's view and goes further to say "it was frustrating to see this one painful narrative represent Christian faith on ''OITNB'', a show that masters other aspects of the melting pot so well", speaking about Doggett's background story and conflict with Chapman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/women/2014/july/stereotypical-christians-of-orange-is-new-black.html?start=2|title=The Stereotypical Christians of 'Orange Is the New Black'|last=Leonard|first=Laura|date=July 21, 2014|work=[[Christianity Today]]|accessdate=August 11, 2016|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160811203356/http://www.christianitytoday.com/women/2014/july/stereotypical-christians-of-orange-is-new-black.html?start=2|archivedate=August 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two critics for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' also gave negative reviews of Doggett; Todd VanDerWerff says that "Pennsatucky never really comes together as a character in the same way as some of the others on the show" and Myles McNutt opted to criticize the storyline of the final episode of the first season specifically, saying that it "[treats] her like a cartoon villain instead of a real character".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/orange-is-the-new-black-orange-is-the-new-black-100179|title=Orange Is The New Black: Orange Is The New Black|last=VanDerWerff|first=Todd|date=July 16, 2013|work=The A.V.

Doggett's rape storyline in the third season garnered much reaction, both positive and negative. Jada Yuan of ''[[New York (magazine)#Digital expansion and blogs|Vulture]]'' described the rape scenes (both the one in the flashback and the one involving correctional officer Coates) as "heartbreaking" and praised episode director [[Jesse Peretz]]'s decision to keep the camera focused on Manning during the scenes.&lt;ref name="Yuan1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/07/orange-is-the-new-black-is-the-only-tv-show-that-understands-rape.html|title='Orange Is the New Black' Is the Only TV Show That Understands Rape|last=Yuan|first=Jada|date=July 6, 2015|work=Vulture|accessdate=August 9, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160707102629/http://www.vulture.com/2015/07/orange-is-the-new-black-is-the-only-tv-show-that-understands-rape.html|archivedate=July 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Megan Vick praised the 'transformation' of the character of Doggett, calling it "the season's breakout storyline and performance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://zap2it.com/2015/06/orange-is-the-new-black-season-3-pennsatucky-mvp-rape-storyline/|title='Orange Is the New Black' Season 3: Pennsatucky earns MVP award for tragic turn|last=Vick|first=Megan|date=June 15, 2015|publisher=[[Zap2it]]|accessdate=August 11, 2016|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160305133111/http://zap2it.com/2015/06/orange-is-the-new-black-season-3-pennsatucky-mvp-rape-storyline/|archivedate= March 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; McNutt, who had been critical of Doggett in the first season, spoke positively about the rape storyline.&lt;ref name="AVTittin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/orange-new-black-tittin-and-hairin-221137|title=Orange Is The New Black: "A Tittin' And A Hairin'"|last=McNutt|first=Myles|date=June 20, 2015|work=[[The A.V.

Marissa Higgins, writing for [[xoJane]], contended that the show "didn't accomplish anything with their portrayal of sexual assault" and said that she disliked the way that the story ended with Doggett effectively quitting her job as van driver in order to avoid further contact with Coates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.xojane.com/issues/orange-is-the-new-black-is-handling-sexual-assault-terribly|title=Actually, "Orange is the New Black" is Doing a TERRIBLE Job of Portraying and Discussing Sexual Assault|last=Higgins|first=Marissa|date=July 10, 2015|work=[[xoJane]]|accessdate=August 11, 2016|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304093625/http://www.xojane.com/issues/orange-is-the-new-black-is-handling-sexual-assault-terribly|archivedate= March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emma Eisenberg, of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', criticized the scenes depicting Doggett growing up in [[Waynesboro, Virginia|Waynesboro]] as being "riddled with excessive [[Appalachia]]n clichés". She went further by calling Doggett's mother unrealistic in her attitude towards sex: "the mothers I met [near Waynesboro] wanted their daughters to understand sex and to make informed choices". Eisenberg claimed that, therefore, Doggett's mother's speech about sex − "it's like a bee sting, in and out, over before you knew it was happening" − was not representative of people in Waynesboro at that time.&lt;ref name="Salon1"/&gt; Chloe Stillwell completely disagreed with Eisenberg and insisted that the character of Doggett was realistic: "Eisenberg's argument completely misses the point that perhaps the show is trying to be as real as possible, and acknowledging that there are real life Pennsatuckies in this world isn't to disenfranchise Appalachia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefrisky.com/2015-07-08/the-soapbox-on-pennsatucky-poor-white-rural-representation-on-orange-is-the-new-black/|title=The Soapbox: On Pennsatucky &amp; Poor, White, Rural Representation On "Orange Is The New Black"|last=Stillwell|first=Chloe|date=July 8, 2015|work=The Frisky|accessdate=August 11, 2016|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160305023321/http://www.thefrisky.com/2015-07-08/the-soapbox-on-pennsatucky-poor-white-rural-representation-on-orange-is-the-new-black/|archivedate= March 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, she appeared at the [[Shakespeare Memorial Theatre]] under the direction of [[Peter Hall (director)|Peter Hall]] as Helena in ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' opposite [[Charles Laughton]] as Bottom and ''Coriolanus'' opposite [[Laurence Olivier]] (in the title role), [[Albert Finney]] and [[Edith Evans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Micheline Steinberg |title=Flashback, A Pictorial History 1879–1979: 100 Years of Stratford-upon-Avon and the Royal Shakespeare Company |publisher=RSC Publications |date=1985 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, Redgrave had her first starring role in [[Robert Bolt]]'s ''[[The Tiger and the Horse]]'', in which she co-starred with her father. In 1961, she played [[Rosalind (As You Like It)|Rosalind]] in ''[[As You Like It]]'' for the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]. In 1962, she played [[Imogen (Shakespeare)|Imogen]] in [[William Gaskill]]'s production of ''[[Cymbeline]]'' for the [[Royal Shakespeare Company|RSC]]. In 1966, Redgrave created the role of Jean Brodie in the [[Donald Albery]] production of ''[[The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (novel)|The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie]]'', adapted for the stage by [[Jay Presson Allen]] from the novel by [[Muriel Spark]].

Redgrave had her first credited film role, in which she co-starred with her father, in [[Brian Desmond Hurst]]'s ''[[Behind the Mask (1958 film)|Behind the Mask]]'' (1958). Redgrave's first starring film role was in ''[[Morgan – A Suitable Case for Treatment]]'' (1966), co-starring [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] and directed by [[Karel Reisz]], for which she received an Oscar nomination, a [[Cannes]] award, a [[Golden Globe]] nomination and a [[BAFTA|BAFTA Film Award nomination]]. Following this, she portrayed a cool London swinger in ''[[Blowup]]'' (1966). Co-starring [[David Hemmings]], it was the first English-language film of the Italian director [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]. Reunited with Karel Reisz for the biographical film of dancer [[Isadora Duncan]] in ''[[Isadora]]'' (1968), her portrayal of Duncan led her gaining a National Society of Film Critics' Award for Best Actress, a second Prize for the Best Female Performance at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], along with a Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination. In the same period came other portrayals of historical (or semi-mythical) figures – ranging from Andromache in ''[[The Trojan Women (film)|The Trojan Women]]'' (1971) to the lead in ''[[Mary, Queen of Scots (1971 film)|Mary, Queen of Scots]]'' (1971), the latter earning her a third Oscar nomination. She also played the role of [[Guinevere]] in the film ''[[Camelot (film)|Camelot]]'' (1967) with [[Richard Harris]] and [[Franco Nero]], and briefly as [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] in ''[[Oh! What a Lovely War]]'' (1969). She portrayed the character of Mother Superior Jeanne des Anges (Joan of the Angels) in ''[[The Devils (film)|The Devils]]'' (1971), the once controversial film directed by [[Ken Russell]].

=== The 1970s and political controversy===
Redgrave funded and narrated a documentary film, ''[[The Palestinian]]'' (1977), about the situation of the Palestinians and the activities of the [[Palestinian Liberation Organisation]]. In the film ''[[Julia (1977 film)|Julia]]'' (also 1977), she starred in the title role as a woman murdered by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] regime in the years prior to [[World War II]] for her [[anti-Fascist]] activism. Her co-star in the film was [[Jane Fonda]] (playing writer [[Lillian Hellman]]), who, in her 2005 autobiography, noted that:
{{bquote|there is a quality about Vanessa that makes me feel as if she resides in a netherworld of mystery that eludes the rest of us mortals. Her voice seems to come from some deep place that knows all suffering and all secrets. Watching her work is like seeing through layers of glass, each layer painted in mythic watercolor images, layer after layer, until it becomes dark, but even then you know you haven't come to the bottom of it ... The only other time I had experienced this with an actor was with Marlon Brando ... Like Vanessa, he always seemed to be in another reality, working off some secret, magnetic, inner rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fonda |first=Jane |title=My Life So Far |publisher=Random House |location=New York |year=2005 |page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When Redgrave was nominated for an Oscar in 1977 for her role in ''Julia,'' members of the [[Jewish Defense League]] (JDL), led by Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]], burned effigies of Redgrave and picketed the Academy Awards ceremony to protest against her involvement in ''The Palestinian''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emanuellevy.com/oscar/oscar-politics-vanessa-redgrave-2/ |title=Welcome to Emanuel Levy » Oscar Politics: Vanessa Redgrave |publisher=Emanuellevy.com |date= |accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Higginbotham|first=Adam|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/9202723/Vanessa-Redgrave-Why-do-I-work-Im-mortgaged-up-to-the-hilt.html|title=Vanessa Redgrave: 'Why do I work? I’m mortgaged up to the hilt'|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=&lt;!-- Tuesday. --&gt;17 April 2012|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redgrave's performance in ''Julia'' received an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]]. Accepting the award, Redgrave thanked Hollywood for having "refused to be intimidated by the threats of a small bunch of Zionist hoodlums – whose behavior is an insult to the stature of Jews all over the world and to their great and heroic record of struggle against fascism and oppression."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/movies/oscars/speeches.htm | title=The Oscar Acceptance Speech: By and Large, It's a Lost Art |work=The Washington Post | author=Sharon Waxman | date=21 March 1999 | accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her remarks brought an outraged on-stage response from screenwriter and Academy Award presenter [[Paddy Chayefsky]], and sparked controversy. One Redgrave biography noted that "The scandal of her awards speech and the negative press it occasioned had a destructive effect on her acting opportunities that would last for years to come."&lt;ref name="Callahan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Callahan|first1=Dan|title=Vanessa: The Life of Vanessa Redgrave|date=2014|publisher=Pegasus Books|isbn=9781605985930|page=121|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dR1bBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT87&amp;dq=vanessa+redgrave+chayefsky#v=onepage&amp;q=vanessa%20redgrave%20chayefsky&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, Redgrave sued the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]], claiming that the orchestra had fired her from a performance because of her support of the PLO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17283568297737840904|title=Google Scholar|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lillian Hellman]] testified in court on Redgrave's behalf.&lt;ref name="martinson 357"&gt;{{cite book |title= Lillian Hellman|last= Martinson|first= Deborah|year= 2005|publisher=Counterpoint Press|isbn= 1-58243-315-1|page= 357|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Redgrave won on a count of [[breach of contract]], but did not win on the claim that the Boston orchestra had violated her civil rights by firing her.&lt;ref name="martinson 357"/&gt;

In 1995, Redgrave was elected to serve as a [[UNICEF]] [[UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador|Goodwill Ambassador]].

In December 2002, Redgrave paid £50,000 bail for [[Chechnya|Chechen]] separatist Deputy Premier and special envoy [[Akhmed Zakayev]], who had sought [[political asylum]] in the United Kingdom and was accused by the [[Russian government]] of aiding and abetting hostage-takings in the [[Moscow Hostage Crisis of 2002]] and guerrilla warfare against Russia.

At a press conference, Redgrave said she feared for Zakayev's safety if he were extradited to Russia on terrorism charges. He would "die of a heart attack" or some other mysterious explanation offered by Russia, she said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2548939.stm |title=UK actress defends Chechen rebel |date=6 December 2002 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=17 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 November 2003, a London court rejected the Russian government's request for Zakayev's extradition. Instead, the court accepted a plea by lawyers for Zakayev that he would not get a fair trial, and could even face torture, in Russia. "It would be unjust and oppressive to return Mr Zakayev to Russia," Judge Timothy Workman ruled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3266325.stm |title=Court rejects Chechen extradition |date=13 November 2003 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=17 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Vanessa Redgrave and her brother [[Corin Redgrave]] launched the [[Peace and Progress Party]], which campaigned against the [[Iraq War]] and for human rights. However, in June 2005 Redgrave left the party.

Redgrave has been an outspoken critic of the "[[war on terrorism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Redgrave, Vanessa (30 September 2001), [http://www.commondreams.org/views01/0930-08.htm "We Need Justice.

In response she questioned whether there can be true democracy if the political leadership of the United States and Britain does not "uphold the values for which my father's generation fought the Nazis, [and] millions of people gave their lives against the [[Soviet Union]]'s regime. [Such sacrifice was made] because of democracy and what democracy meant: no torture, no camps, no detention forever or without trial.... [Such] techniques are not just alleged [against the governments of the U.S. and Britain], they have actually been written about by the [[FBI]]. I don't think it's being 'far left'...to uphold the rule of law."&lt;ref name="LarryKing"&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0506/18/lkl.01.html ''CNN Larry King Live'' interview with Vanessa Redgrave transcript], (Aired 18 June 2005), ''CNN.com''. accessed 17 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, Redgrave remarked in an interview with US broadcast journalist [[Amy Goodman]]: "I don't know of a single government that actually abides by international human rights law, not one, including my own. In fact, [they] violate these laws in the most despicable and obscene way, I would say." Goodman's interview with Redgrave took place in the actress's West London home on the evening of 7 March, and covered a range of subjects, particularly the cancellation by the [[New York Theatre Workshop]] of the [[Alan Rickman]] production ''[[My Name is Rachel Corrie]]''. Such a development, said Redgrave, was an "act of catastrophic cowardice" as "the essence of life and the essence of theatre is to communicate about lives, either lives that have ended or lives that are still alive, [and about] beliefs, and what is in those beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06/03/08/1620208 "Legendary Actor Vanessa Redgrave Calls Cancellation of Rachel Corrie Play an 'Act of Catastrophic Cowardice'"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060315093007/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06%2F03%2F08%2F1620208 |date=15 March 2006 }} [https://archive.org/download/dn2006-0308/dn2006-0308-1_64kb.mp3 audio], (8 March 2004), ''Democracy Now!''. accessed 17 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, she was awarded a lifetime achievement award from the [[Transilvania International Film Festival]], one of whose sponsors is a mining company named [[Gabriel Resources]]. She dedicated the award to a community organisation from [[Roşia Montană]], Romania, which is campaigning against a [[gold mining|gold mine]] that Gabriel Resources is seeking to build near the village. Gabriel Resources placed an "open letter" in ''[[The Guardian]]'' on 23 June 2006, attacking Redgrave, arguing the case for the mine, and exhibiting support for it among the inhabitants: the open letter is signed by 77 villagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vasagar |first=Jeevan |date=23 June 2006 |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1804285,00.html |title=Redgrave centre stage in campaign to halt Romanian gold mine that has split village |work=The Guardian |accessdate=17 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, Redgrave was named as one of the possible suretors who paid the £50,000 bail for [[Jamil al-Banna]], one of three British residents arrested after landing back in the UK following four years' captivity at [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]]. Redgrave has declined to be specific about her financial involvement but said she was "very happy" to be of "some small assistance for Jamil and his wife", adding, "It is a profound honour and I am glad to be alive to be able to do this. Guantanamo Bay is a concentration camp."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1573181/Vanessa-Redgrave-bails-Guantanamo-suspect.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Vanessa Redgrave bails Guantanamo suspect | first1=Matthew | last1=Moore | date=20 December 2007 | accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, Redgrave took part in a protest outside [[Pentonville Prison]] in North London after new prison regulations were introduced which forbade sending books to prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.express.co.uk/celebrity-news/467737/Vanessa-Redgrave-joins-protest-against-prison-book-ban| title=Vanessa Redgrave joins protest against prison book ban| publisher=express.co.uk| date=2014-03-30| access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and fellow actor [[Samuel West]], playwright [[David Hare (playwright)| David Hare]] and [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom| Poet Laureate]] [[Carol Ann Duffy]] took turns reading poetry and making speeches. Redgrave stated that the ban was "vicious and deplorable...Literature is something that stirs us beyond our immediate problems, it can help us to learn better our own problems, our own faults or to have a goal to live for, an aspiration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/poetry-reading-held-outside-pentonville-in-protest-against-prison-books-ban-9222222.html| title=Poetry reading held outside Pentonville in protest against prison books ban| author=Helen William| publisher=London Evening Standard| date=2014-03-28| access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban was overturned by the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)| Ministry of Justice]] the following December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/08/ban-books-prisoners-ministry-of-justice-mark-haddon| title=The ban on books for prisoners is over.

In 2017 Redgrave made her directorial debut with the movie ''[[Sea Sorrow]]'', a documentary about the [[European migrant crisis]] and the plight of migrants encamped outside [[Calais, France]] trying to reach Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=&lt;https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/may/21/vanessa-redgrave-sea-sorrow-interview-democracy-voting-labour| title=Vanessa Redgrave: ‘Democracy is at stake.

The UN signed the Declaration of Human Rights and now we have to employ lawyers to take the government to court to force them to obey the law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4047">'''Walsingham''' was a popular [[Elizabethan]] [[ballad]] tune. There are various versions of the lyrics, which relate to a [[Our Lady of Walsingham|pilgrimage site]], suppressed during the [[English Reformation]].
[[File:John Bull - Walsingham (Fitzwilliam Virginal Book no 1).png|thumb|300px|The "Walsingham" theme, as arranged for keyboard by John Bull]]
The tune provided inspiration for Elizabethan composers, notably  [[William Byrd]]. Byrd wrote a set of [[musical keyboard|keyboard]] variations called '''Have with Yow to Walsingame''' ("Be off to Walsingham"). In some sources it is called "As I went to Walsingham", the first line of the following quatrain.
&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em;"&gt;As I went to Walsingham,
To the shrine with speed,
Met I with a jolly palmer&lt;ref&gt;"Palmer" meant a pilgrim in those days, since pilgrims returning from the [[Holy Land]] traditionally brought back a [[palm branch]].&lt;/ref&gt;
In a pilgrim's weed.&lt;/poem&gt;

==History of the pilgrimage==
[[Walsingham]] is a [[pilgrimage]] site in Norfolk, England, where, according to Catholic belief, a [[Saxon]] noblewoman, [[Richeldis de Faverches]], had a [[Marian apparitions|vision]] of the Virgin Mary. 
The [[shrine]] was dismantled in 1538 during the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. (It has since been revived).  In the sixteenth century attitudes towards pilgrimages varied, reflecting the Catholic/Protestant divide.

==Ballads==
The ballad literature includes on the one hand laments for the lost shrine and, on the other, suggestions that, as alleged by religious reformers, pilgrims were looking for encounters of a sexual nature. [[Ophelia]] in ''[[Hamlet]]'' sings a version of the Walsingham lyrics in which a woman asks about her pilgrim lover.&lt;ref&gt;"Ophelia's Version of the Walsingham Song". F. W. Sternfeld ''[[Music &amp; Letters]]'', Vol. 45, No. 2 (Apr., 1964), pp. 108-113 Published by: Oxford University Press.  Accessed via [[JSTOR]]: article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/732068 (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Byrd's arrangement==
Byrd composed 22 [[variation (music)|variation]]s on the Walsingham tune.  The composition takes about 9 or 10 minutes in performance. It is included in two of the most important collections of keyboard music of the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]], ''[[My Ladye Nevells Booke]]'' and the ''[[Fitzwilliam Virginal Book]]''.
In these variations, which Byrd wrote in the 1570s or 1580s, he shows his mastery of the keyboard, but also includes elements more characteristic of his vocal music.

Musicologist Margaret Gynn described how Byrd had taken what was originally "a love-song of the road" and transformed it by giving it the "serious religious character of a pilgrimage".&lt;ref name="quir" /&gt;
According to [[Bradley Brookshire]], the variations form a sort of "covert speech" addressed to Catholic [[recusant]]s in Elizabethan culture. He argues that it includes "musically encoded symbols of Catholic veneration and lament."&lt;ref name="quir"&gt;Bradley Brookshire, "Bare ruined quiers, where late the sweet birds sang", Covert Speech in William Byrd's Walsingham variations, in ''Walsingham in Literature and Culture from the Middle Ages to Modernity'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2010, pp. 199ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bull's arrangement==
Byrd's younger rival [[John Bull (composer)|John Bull]] also composed variations on Walsingham for keyboard.  It is the first composition in the ''Fitzwilliam Virginal Book'', and with 30 variations is longer than Byrd's version.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10626">The '''''Wetterau Limes''''' is the name given in the field of historical research to that part of the [[Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes]] which enclosed the region that became known later as the  [[Wetterau]] in the German state of [[Hesse]].

== History and route ==
During the two campaigns of the Roman Emperor [[Domitian]] against the [[Chatti]] (83 and 85 AD), the Romans began to cut swathes of open ground through the dense forests of today's Hesse, in order to prevent their columns from being ambushed (e.g. at the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]).

On the crest of the [[Taunus]] mountain range, such a swathe served as a supply and surveillance route. After the end of the Chatti Wars, the Romans began to secure these conquered regions east of the Rhine with a ''[[limes]]'' - a line of forts, fortlets, watchtowers and palisades.&lt;ref&gt;NJE Austin and NB Rankov, ''Exploratio: Military and Political Intelligences in the Roman World...'' Oxford:Routledge, 1995, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; The forest road was guarded by wooden watchtowers to ensure continuous observation. This ensured that the southern slopes of the Taunus mountains and the fertile and strategically important Wetterau became part of the [[Roman Empire]]. In addition to the establishment of this frontier, Domitian turned the two Germanic military territories of Upper and Lower Germanian into Roman provinces. In spite of this rather modest conquest, he was subsequently celebrated in Rome with great pomp as a [[triumphator]] and coins were minted with the ambitious claim ''Germania capta'' ("Germania is conquered"). The propaganda nature of this policy is also evinced by the fact that in the very narrow province of Upper Germania ([[Germania superior]]) there were hardly any Germanii, the area was populated almost entirely by [[Celts]].

The long-held conviction that the [[Neckar-Odenwald Limes]] was erected at the same time as the Wetterau Limes, immediately after the Chatti wars, is now regarded as having been rejected. Although there were [[castra|Roman military outposts]] on the eastern side of the Rhine from the seventies, the border running along the Odenwald-Neckar Line to Donnstetten (see [[Lautertal Limes]]) is now dated by most sources as having not been erected before 98 AD.

The state of preservation of the ''limes'' is poor due to the heavy agricultural use of the Wetterau. Only a few sections on the foothills of the Taunus, at [[Echzell]], [[Limeshain]] and east of [[Hanau]] are visible above ground. In the early days of limes research, this situation meant that the eastern Wetterau section remained undiscovered; it was assumed that a stretch of the limes ran through the [[Vogelsberg]] instead. This was not disproved until the 1880s by excavations of the ''Hanauer Geschichtsverein'' under Albert Duncker and Georg Wolff.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Fabricius]], Felix Hettner, Oscar von Sarwey (ed.): ''Der obergermanisch-raetische Limes des Roemerreiches/Abt. A, Vol. 2,1.'' p.&amp;nbsp;7; Fritz-Rudolf Herrmann: ''Die archäologische Erforschung der Römerzeit in Hesse.'' In: D. Baatz/ F.-R. Hermann (ed.): ''Die Römer in Hesse.'' Theiss, Stuttgart, 1989, pp.&amp;nbsp;13–37; Rainer Braun: ''Frühe Forschungen am Obergermanischen Limes in Baden-Württemberg.'' Kleine Schr. Kenntnis Röm. Besetzungsgeschichte Südwestdeutschlands (Schriften des Limesmuseums Aalen) 45, Stuttgart, 1991, pp.&amp;nbsp;42–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the other sections of the Upper German-Raetian Limes, the Wetterau Limes was gradually reinforced and expanded. Particularly in the eastern Wetterau the dates when the individual forts were first built are not uniform. It is clear that there was initially a defensive line from [[Ober-Florstadt Roman Fort|Oberflorstadt]] via [[Heldenbergen Roman Fort|Heldenbergen]] and [[Hanau-Mittelbuchen]] to [[Salisberg Roman Fort|Hanau-Salisberg]]&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Reuter: ''Die römischen Kleinkastelle von Hanau-Mittelbuchen und der Verlauf des östlichen Wetteraulimes unter Domitian.''

Bad Homburg v.d.H., 2004) pp.&amp;nbsp;97–106 (Saalburg-Schriften 6).&lt;/ref&gt; The forts on the line further east from [[Marköbel Roman Fort|Marköbel]] via [[Rückingen Roman Fort|Rückingen]] to [[Großkrotzenburg Roman Fort|Großkrotzenburg]] were probably not built until the time of [[Trajan]]. The neighbouring Taunus line was reinforced in the second half of the second century by the [[Numerus (Roman military unit)|numerus]] forts of [[Holzhausen Roman Fort|Holzhausen]], [[Kleiner Feldberg Roman Fort|Kleiner Feldberg]] and [[Kapersburg Roman Fort|Kapersburg]].

The further expansion of the ''limes'' defences to the north of the Wetterau was in order to protect its fertile soils on the one hand and to meet the high demand for the supply of the troops stationed on the ''limes'' and legion camps in Mainz ([[Mogontiacum]]). [[Archaeobotany| Archaeobotanical]] studies have calculated that an annual requirement of 3,034 tons of grain (excluding seed production) and 10,371 tons of hay were required to supply for the north-facing bulge of the ''limes'' in the [[Wetterau]].&lt;ref&gt;Angela Kreuz: ''Landwirtschaft und ihre ökologischen Grundlagen in den Jahrhunderten um Christi Geburt. Zum Stand der naturwissenschaftlichen Untersuchungen in Hesse.'' Berichte zur archäologischen Landesforschung in Hesse 3, 1994/95, pp.&amp;nbsp;79–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the Wetterau Limes came in the year 259-260 AD, when Rome abandoned all areas to the east of the [[Rhine]] (the ''[[Limesfall]]'' or "fall of the limes"). Thus, for example, the pottery trade, once flourishing in the Wetterau, largely came to a standstill. Imports of pottery from the [[Rhineland]] dominate archaeological collections from the second third of the 3rd century. Even bricks found in the area do not seem to have been fired as they used to be. More and more often, (sometimes damaged) older building material was used instead. Hypocaust heating was replaced by much simpler heating pipe systems.&lt;ref&gt;Ralf-Peter Märtin: ''Die Rache der Römer'', Titelthema in National Geographic Magazin 06/10, pp. 66-91.&lt;/ref&gt; From the border area, however, there are also other interesting finds which shed further light on the later period of the ''limes''. This includes the treasure of Ober-Florstadt, which was probably concealed during the course of Germanic invasions in AD 233. In 1603, the inscription of a ''collegium iuventutis'' was discovered in the area around [[Altenstadt Roman Fort]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CIL|13|7424}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been a unit set up to act as a local militia. [[Kapersburg Roman Fort]] was considerably reduced during its last days.&lt;ref&gt;Markus Scholz: ''Spätlimeszeitliche Reduktion versus mittelalterlicher Einbau in Limeskastellen.'' In: E. Schallmayer (ed.): ''Limes Imperii Romani. Beiträge zum Fachkolloquium „Weltkulturerbe Limes“ November 2001 in Lich-Arnsburg.'' Bad Homburg v.d.H., 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;135–145. (Saalburg-Schriften 6).&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence of a local unit, a ''numberus nidensium'', which was presumably raised in the ''[[civitas]]'' capital of [[Nida (Roman town)|Nida-Heddernheim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CIL|13|07441 (4, p 125)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
