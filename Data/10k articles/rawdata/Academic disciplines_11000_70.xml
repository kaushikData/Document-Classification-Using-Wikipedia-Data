The '''angular momentum problem''' is a problem in astrophysics identified by [[Leon Mestel]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://academic.oup.com/astrogeo/article/53/5/5.19/208905/Losing-spin-the-angular-momentum-problem|title=Losing spin: the angular momentum problem|last=Ray|first=Tom|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|access-date=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was found that the angular momentum of a [[protoplanetary disk]] is misappropriated when compared to models during stellar birth. The [[Sun]] and other stars are predicted by models to be rotating considerably faster than they actually are. The Sun, for example, only accounts for about 0.3 percent of the total angular momentum of the [[Solar System]] while about 60% is attributed to [[Jupiter]].

[[File:Statues of Hindu Deities at Lord Shiva Temple in Kanipakam 07.jpg|thumb|A statue of a cow at the Lord Shiva Temple in Kanipakam]]
'''Animal worship''' (or '''zoolatry''') refers to rituals involving animals, such as the glorification of '''animal deities''' or [[animal sacrifice]]. When a god is respected or worshipped by means of a representative animal, an animal cult is formed ([[#Reference-idTeeter2002|Teeter et al., 2002]], p.&amp;nbsp;355). Animal cults may be classified according to their outward form or according to their inward meaning, which may of course undergo transformations ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51).

The classical author Diodorus explained the origin of animal worship by recalling the myth in which the gods, supposedly threatened by giants, hid under the guise of animals. The people then naturally began to worship the animals that their gods had disguised themselves as and continued this act even after the gods returned to their normal state ([[#Reference-idLubbock2005|Lubbock, 2005]], p.&amp;nbsp;252). In 1906, Weissenborn suggested that animal worship resulted from man's natural curiosity. Primitive man would observe an animal that had a unique trait and the inexplicability of this trait would appeal to man's curiosity ([[#Reference-idWeissenborn1906b|Weissenborn, 1906b]], p.&amp;nbsp;282). Wonder resulted from primitive man's observations of this distinctive trait and this wonder eventually induced adoration. Thus, primitive man worshipped animals that had inimitable traits ([[#Reference-idWeissenborn1906b|Weissenborn, 1906b]], p.&amp;nbsp;282). Lubbock put forward a more recent view. Lubbock proposed that animal-worship originated from family names. In societies, families would name themselves and their children after certain animals and eventually came to hold that animal above other animals. Eventually, these opinions turned into deep respect and evolved into fully developed worship of the family animal ([[#Reference-idLubbock2005|Lubbock, 2005]], p.&amp;nbsp;253). The belief that an animal is sacred frequently results in [[Taboo food and drink|dietary laws]] prohibiting their consumption. As well as holding certain animals to be sacred, religions have also adopted the opposite attitude, that certain animals are [[unclean animals|unclean]].

The idea that divinity embodies itself in animals, such as a deity incarnate, and then lives on earth among human beings is disregarded by [[Abrahamic]] religions ([[#Reference-idMorris2000|Morris, 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;26). In [[Independent Assemblies of God]] and [[Pentecostal]] churches, animals have very little religious significance ([[#Reference-idMorris2000|Schoffeleers, 1985; Peltzer, 1987; Qtd. in Morris, 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;25). Animals have become less and less important and symbolic in cult rituals and religion, especially among African cultures, as Christianity and Islamic religions have spread. ([[#Reference-idMorris2000|Morris, 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;24).

The [[Egyptian pantheon]] was especially fond of [[zoomorphism]], with many animals sacred to particular deities—[[cat]]s to [[Bastet (mythology)|Bastet]], [[ibis]]es and [[baboon]]s to [[Thoth]], [[crocodile]]s to [[Sobek]] and [[Ra]], fish to [[Set (mythology)|Set]], [[mongoose]], [[shrew]] and [[bird]]s to [[Horus]], dogs and [[jackal]]s to [[Anubis]], serpents and [[eel]]s to [[Atum]], [[beetle]]s to [[Khepera]], bulls to [[Apis (Egyptian mythology)|Apis]]. Animals were often [[Animal Mummies|mummified]] as a result of these beliefs.

==Hunting cults==

===Bear===
{{Main|Bear worship}}
There is evidence that connects the Greek goddess [[Artemis]] with a cult of the bear. Girls danced as "bears" in her honour, and might not marry before undergoing this ceremony ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51). According to mythology, the goddess once transformed a [[nymph]] into a bear and then into the constellation [[Ursa Major]].

The existence of an ancient bear cult among Neanderthals in the Middle Paleolithic period has been a topic of discussion spurred by archaeological findings ([[#Reference-idWunn2000|Wunn, 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;434-435). Ancient bear bones have been discovered in several different caves and their peculiar arrangement are believed by some archaeologists to be evidence of a bear cult during the Paleolithic era. ([[#Reference-idWunn2000|Wunn, 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;435). However, others argue that the placement of these remains, whether it appears to be an identified pattern or not, is due to natural causes such as wind, sediment, or water ([[#Reference-idWunn2000|Wunn, 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;437-438).

[[Image:AinuBearSacrificeCirca1870.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ainu people|Ainu]] ''[[Iomante]]'' ceremony (bear sending). Japanese scroll painting, circa 1870.]]
The [[Ainu people]], who live on select islands in the Japanese archipelago, call the bear "[[kamui]]" in [[Ainu language|their language]], which translates to mean god. While many other animals are considered to be gods in the Ainu culture, the bear is the head of the gods ([[#Reference-idKindaichi1949|Kindaichi, 1949]], p.&amp;nbsp;345). For the Ainu, when the gods visit the world of man, they don fur and claws and take on the physical appearance of an animal. Usually, however, when the term "kamui" is used, it essentially means a bear ([[#Reference-idKindaichi1949|Kindaichi, 1949]], p.&amp;nbsp;345). The Ainu people willingly and thankfully ate the bear as they believed that the disguise (the flesh and fur) of any god was a gift to the home that the god chose to visit ([[#Reference-idKindaichi1949|Kindaichi, 1949]], p.&amp;nbsp;348).

===Whale===
[[Image:Bộ cốt cá voi.jpg|right|thumb|The largest whale skeleton in Vietnam at [[:vi:Vạn Thủy Tú|Vạn Thủy Tú temple]], one of [[:vi:Tục thờ cá Ông|Vietnamese Whale worship]] in [[Vietnamese folk religion]]s]]

Whales were little understood for most of human history as they spend up to 90% of their lives underwater, only surfacing briefly to breathe ([[#Reference-idBird2007|Bird 2007]]). Many cultures, even those that have hunted them, hold whales in awe and feature them in their mythologies.

A prevalent [[whale]] cult in Japan occurs around the coastal area. There are cemeteries with memorial stones dedicated to the whales which were hunted and killed to feed the people ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&amp;nbsp;4).
Buddhist epitaphs mark these stones which implore that Buddha be reborn as a whale ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&amp;nbsp;4). Along with these memorials, there is evidence that whale embryos, found in a deceased mother's womb, were extracted and buried with the same respect as a human being ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&amp;nbsp;5). For certain shrines, the bones of a perished whale were also deposited in the area ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&amp;nbsp;5).

In Alaska, there are cultures that have ceremonial tributes whales after they are captured in a hunt ([[#Reference-idLantis1938|Lantis 1938]], p.&amp;nbsp;445). Some tribes bring the hump, the fins, or the nose of the whale into their camps or the whaler's house. These parts are meant to represent the entirety of the whale and are honored as such during the festival ([[#Reference-idLantis1938|Lantis 1938]], p.&amp;nbsp;445). The bones of a whale are also given ritual treatment. The Alaskan tribes that participate in such acts believe that their ceremonies protect the whale's soul from injury and the soul can then be free to return to the sea ([[#Reference-idLantis1938|Lantis 1938]], p.&amp;nbsp;445).

In China, ''Yu-kiang'', a whale with the hands and feet of a man was said to rule the ocean ([[#Reference-idSiebert2011|Siebert 2011]], pp.&amp;nbsp;15–16).

In the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] region of Austria, it was said that if a sunbeam were to fall on a maiden entering womanhood, she would be carried away in the belly of a whale ([[#Reference-idFrazer1913|Frazer 1913]], p.&amp;nbsp;72).

[[Paikea]] (also maori name for [[humpback whale]]s&lt;ref name=Teara&gt;http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/te-whanau-puha-whales&lt;/ref&gt;), the youngest and favourite son of the chief Uenuku from the island of [[Mangaia]], in the present day [[Cook Islands]], was said by the Kati Kuri people of [[Kaikoura]] to have come from the Pacific Islands on the back of ''Tohora'' (maori name for [[southern right whale]]s&lt;ref name=Teara /&gt;) a whale many centuries before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/exhibitions/whales/EducationResource.aspx?irn=198|title=Whales|last=Anon|work=Tinirau education resource|accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The whale features in [[Inuit]] [[creation myth]]s. When 'Big Raven', a deity in human form, found a stranded whale, he was told by the [[Great Spirit]] where to find special mushrooms that would give him the strength to drag the whale back to the sea and thus return order to the world ([[#Reference-idSiebert2011|Siebert 2011]], pp.&amp;nbsp;15–16).

The [[Tlingit]] people of northern Canada say that the orcas were created when the hunter Natsihlane carved eight fish from yellow cedar, sang his most powerful spirit song and commanded the fish to leap into the water ([[#Reference-idHeimlichBoran2001|Heimlich &amp; Boran 2001]], p.&amp;nbsp;7).

In Icelandic legend a man threw a stone at a [[fin whale]] and hit the blowhole, causing the whale to burst. The man was told not to go to sea for twenty years, but in the nineteenth year he went fishing and a whale came and killed him.&lt;ref name="worldtrans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldtrans.org/creators/whale/myths0.html|title=Whale Mythology from around the World|last=Anon|work=The Creative Continuum|publisher=worldtrans.org|accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In East African legend, King Sulemani asked God that he might permit him to feed all the beings on earth. A whale came and ate until there was no corn left and then told Sulemani that he was still hungry and that there were 70,000 more in his tribe. Sulemani then prayed to God for forgiveness and thanked the creature for teaching him a lesson in humility ([[#Reference-idSiebert2011|Siebert 2011]], pp.&amp;nbsp;15–16).

Some cultures that associate [[divinity]] with whales, such as some Ghanaians and Vietnamese, coastal Chinese except for southernmost region,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=謝婧, 下園知弥, 宮崎克則|year=2015|title=明清時代の中国における鯨資源の利用|url=http://www.seinan-gu.ac.jp/museum/wp-content/uploads/2015/publish/kiyou3.pdf|journal=西南学院大学博物館研究紀要 第3号|pages=9–14|publisher=[[Seinan Gakuin University]]|format=pdf|accessdate=2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese (also known as [[Ebisu (mythology)|Ebisu]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[村上健司]]編著|title=日本妖怪大事典|year=2005|publisher=[[角川書店]]|series=Kwai books|isbn=978-4-04-883926-6|pages=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="大藤1955"&gt;{{Cite book|author=大藤時彦他|editor=民俗学研究所編|others=[[柳田國男]]監修|title=綜合日本民俗語彙|year=1955|publisher=[[平凡社]]|volume=第2巻|pages=763}}&lt;/ref&gt; occasionally hold funerals for beached whales; a throwback to Vietnam's ancient sea-based Austro-Asiatic culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Whale funeral draws 1000 mourners in Vietnam|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/13/1050172476288.html|agency=AFP|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=15 April 2011|date=14 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousand gather for whale's funeral in Vietnam|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/thousand-gather-for-whales-funeral-in-vietnam-1907716.html|agency=Associated Press|work=The Independent|accessdate=15 April 2011|location=London|date=23 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;([[#Reference-idViegas2010|Viegas 2010]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Funeral for a Whale held at Apam|url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=87737|work=Ghana News Agency|publisher=GhanaWeb|accessdate=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also the below-mentioned '''Ebisu''' in fish part for more details. In some lore, whales have been told to work for [[Ryūgū-jō]] as well.

Indigenous [[Ainu people|Ainu]] tribes on Hokkaido refereed [[killer whale]]s as ''[[Repun Kamuy]]'', "God of Sea/Offshore" in their folklore and myths that the deities will bring fortunes (whales) to coastal people.

{{Anchor|Whales in the Bible}}
The Bible mentions whales in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:21, [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] 7:12, [[Ezekiel]] 32:2. The "sea monsters" in Lamentations 4:3 have been taken by some commentators to refer to marine mammals, in particular whales, although most modern versions use the word "jackals" instead ([http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-3.htm Lamentations 4:3]).&lt;!-- "sea monsters" (marine mammals) in the Douay-Rheims, KJV, Webster, AKJV, and English Jubilee 2000 version - KJV margin "sea calves" (seals) --&gt; The story of [[Jonah#Jonah in Islam|Jonah]] being swallowed by a "big Fish" is told both in the Qur'an ({{Cite quran|37|139|e=148|s=ns}}) and in the Bible. The Old Testament contains the [[Book of Jonah]] and in the New Testament, Jesus mentions this story in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 12:40 ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jonah+1-4 Jonah 1-4]).

==Domesticated mammals==

===Cattle and buffalo===

{{Main|bull worship|Cattle in religion}}

Many religions have considered [[cattle in religion|cattle]] to be sacred, most famously [[Hinduism]] from India and Nepal, but also [[Zoroastrianism]], and ancient [[ancient Greek religion|Greek]] and [[ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian]] religion. Cattle and buffalo are respected by many pastoral peoples that rely on the animals for sustenance and the killing of an ox is a sacrificial function ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51).

The [[Toda (tribe)|Toda]] of southern [[India]] abstain from the flesh of their domestic animal, the buffalo. However, once a year they sacrifice a bull calf, which is eaten in the forest by the adult males ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51). The buffalo plays an important part in many Toda rituals. These buffalo are currently endangered.

Conspicuous among Egyptian animal cults was that of the bull, [[Apis (god)|Apis]]. It was distinguished by certain marks, and when the old Apis died a new one was sought. The finder was rewarded, and the bull underwent four months' education at [[Nilopolis]]. Its birthday was celebrated once a year when oxen, which had to be pure white, were sacrificed to it. Women were forbidden to approach it when once its education was finished. Oracles were obtained from it in various ways. After death it was mummified and buried in a rock-tomb. Less widespread was the cult of the [[Mnevis]], also consecrated to [[Osiris]] ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51).

Similar observances are found in our own day on the Upper [[Nile]]. The [[Nuba]] and [[Nuer people|Nuer]] revere cattle. The [[Angoni]] of Central Africa and the [[Sakalava]] of Madagascar keep sacred bulls. In [[India]] respect for the cow is widespread, but is of post-Vedic origin; there is little actual worship, but the products of the cow are important in magic ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51).

While there are several animals that are worshipped in India, the supreme position is held by the cow ([[#Reference-idMargul1968|Margul, 1968]], p.&amp;nbsp;63). The [[humped zebu]], a breed of cow, is central to the religion of Hinduism ([[#Reference-idMargul1968|Margul, 1968]], p.&amp;nbsp;63). Mythological legends have supported the sanctity of the zebu throughout India ([[#Reference-idMargul1968|Margul, 1968]], p.&amp;nbsp;64). Such myths have included the creation of a divine cow mother and a cow heaven by the God, [[Brahma]] and [[Prithu]], the sovereign of the universe, created the earth's vegetation, edible fruits and vegetables, disguised as a cow ([[#Reference-idMargul1968|Margul, 1968]], p.&amp;nbsp;64).

According to Tadeusz Margul, observations of the Hindu religion and the cow has led to a misunderstanding that Hindi have a servile relationship with the zebu, giving prayers and offerings to it daily. Typically, however, only during the Cow Holiday, an annual event, is the cow the recipient of such practices ([[#Reference-idMargul1968|Margul, 1968]], p.&amp;nbsp;65). Margul suggests that sanctity of the cow is based on four foundations: abstaining from cow slaughter, abstaining from beef consumption, control of breeding and ownership, and belief in purification qualities of cow products (milk, curd, ghee, dung, and urine) ([[#Reference-idMargul1968|Margul, 1968]], p.&amp;nbsp;65-66).

===Sheep===
{{Main|Sheep#In religion and folklore}}

[[Amun]], the god of [[Thebes, Egypt]], was represented as ram-headed. His worshippers held the ram to be sacred, however, it was sacrificed once a year. Its fleece formed the clothing of the idol ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52). Another Egyptian ram-headed god was ''Banebdjed'', a form of [[Osiris]].

===Goat===
{{Main|Goat#Religion, mythology, and folklore}}
[[File:Mosaic Pan Genazzano Massimo.jpg|thumb|left|Pavement mosaic with the head of Pan. Roman artwork, Antonine period, 138–192 CE.]]
[[Silenus]], the [[Satyr]]s and the [[Faun]]s were either capriform or had some part of their bodies shaped like that of a goat. In northern Europe the wood spirit, [[Leszi]], is believed to have a goat's horns, ears and legs ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51). A deity known as the Goat of [[Mendes]] is associated with the [[pentagram]].

In Greece, Italy, and Egypt, the goat was worshipped in both goat form and phallic form ([[#Reference-idNeave1988|Neave 1988]], p.&amp;nbsp;8). This type of worship has sometimes been said to have originated from the goat's increased sex drive. One male goat was capable of fertilizing 150 females ([[#Reference-idNeave1988|Neave 1988]], p.&amp;nbsp;8). The Greek god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] was depicted as having goat characteristics, such as hooves, horns, and a beard. Along with Pan, the goat was closely related to Dionysus during the Roman era ([[#Reference-idNeave1988|Neave 1988]], p.&amp;nbsp;8). To honor Dionysus, Romans would tear apart a goat and eat it alive. The goat was commonly associated with dark arts and the devil. This association was amplified in Egypt during the Middle Ages ([[#Reference-idNeave1988|Neave 1988]], p.&amp;nbsp;8).

Excavations in Central Asia have revealed ancient ritual goat-burial that show a religious significance of the goat predominantly in the area ([[#Reference-idSidky1990|Sidky 1990]], p.&amp;nbsp;286). These findings have been used as evidence for a goat-cult of Asia originating either in the Neolithic or Bronze Ages ([[#Reference-idSidky1990|Sidky 1990]], p.&amp;nbsp;286).

===Dog===
[[Image:Dog worship in Hinduism.jpg|thumb|A dog after being decorated in the [[Kukur tihar]] festival in Nepal.]]
{{Main|Dogs in religion}}

Dogs have a major religious significance among the [[Hindu]]s in [[Nepal]] and some parts of [[India]]. The dogs are worshipped as a part of a five-day [[Tihar (festival)|Tihar]] festival that falls roughly in November every year. In [[Hinduism]], it is believed that the dog is a messenger of ''[[Yama]]'', the god of death, and dogs guard the doors of [[Heaven]]. Socially, they are believed to be the protectors of our homes and lives. So, in order to please the dogs they are going to meet at Heaven's doors after death, so they would be allowed in Heaven, people mark the 14th day of the [[lunar cycle]] in November as '''Kukur-tihar''', as known in Nepali language for the dog's day. This is a day when the dog is worshipped by applying ''[[Tilaka|tika]]'' (the holy vermilion dot), incense sticks and garlanded generally with [[Tagetes|marigold]] flower.

Actual dog worship is uncommon. The [[Nosarii]] of western Asia are said to worship a dog. The [[Karang Jiwo|Karang]] of Java had a cult of the red dog, each family keeping one in the house. According to one authority the dogs are images of wood which are worshipped after the death of a member of the family and burnt after a thousand days. In [[Nepal]] it is said that dogs are worshipped at the festival called Khicha Puja. Among the [[Harranian]]s dogs were sacred, but this was rather as brothers of the mystae ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51).

===Horse===

{{Main|Horse worship}}

[[Horse worship]] has been practiced by a number of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] and [[Turkic peoples]]. There is some reason to believe that [[Poseidon]], like other water gods, was originally conceived under the form of a [[horse]]. In the cave of [[Phigalia]] [[Demeter]] was, according to popular tradition, represented with the head and mane of a horse, possibly a relic of the time when a non-specialized [[Vegetation deity|corn-spirit]] bore this form. Her priests were called [[Poloi]] ([[Greek language|Greek]] for "colts") in [[Laconia]]. The mule and the horse are sacred to the Roman god [[Consus]]. In [[Gaul]] we find a horse-goddess, [[Epona]]. There are also traces of a horse-god, [[Rudiobus]]. [[Hayagriva]] is a horse-headed deity that appears in both [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. The [[Gonds]] in India worship a horse-god, [[Koda Pen]], in the form of a shapeless stone, but it is not clear that the horse is regarded as divine. The horse or mare is a common form of the corn-spirit in Europe ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52).

Among the Balkan culture, swaddling an unmarried person in a horse-girth is a typical ritual. It is thought that the sexual potency of the horse is passed to the individual wrapped in its girth ([[#Reference-idVukanović1980|Vukanović 1980]], p.&amp;nbsp;112). Along with the Balkan swaddling, Virgil's Aeneid bases the founding of the great city of Carthage upon a horse ([[#Reference-idBrown1950|Qtd. in Brown 1950]], p.&amp;nbsp;32). When the Phoenicians dug up a horse head from the ground they decided to build their city (Carthage) upon that spot because the horse was a sign of success ([[#Reference-idBrown1950|Qtd. in Brown 1950]], p.&amp;nbsp;32). Thus, Brown argued that the horse was sacred to the Phoenician people ([[#Reference-idBrown1950|Brown 1950]], p.&amp;nbsp;32).

===Elephant===
{{main|Cultural depictions of elephants}}

[[Image:13th century Ganesha statue.jpg|right|upright|thumb|A statue of [[Ganesha]] - the elephant-headed Hindu god of wisdom and obstacle removal]]
In [[Thailand]] it is believed that a white [[elephant]] may contain the soul of a dead person, perhaps a Buddha. When one is taken the capturer is rewarded and the animal brought to the king to be kept ever afterwards. It cannot be bought or sold. It is baptized and fêted and mourned for like a human being at its death. In some parts of Indo-China the belief is that the soul of the elephant may injure people after death; it is therefore fêted by a whole village. In [[Cambodia]] it is held to bring luck to the kingdom. The cult of the white elephant is also found at [[Ennarea]] in southern [[Ethiopia]] ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51). In India, the popular Hindu god [[Ganesha]] has the head of an elephant and a torso of a human.

In [[Surat]], unmarried Anāvil girls participate in a holiday referred to as Alunām ([[#Reference-idNaik1958|Naik, 1958]], p.&amp;nbsp;393). This holiday is to honor the goddess [[Pārvatī]]. During this celebration, a clay elephant is prepared (most likely to celebrate [[Pārvatī]]'s creation of [[Ganesha]] from a paste of either [[turmeric]] or [[sandalwood]]). Every day, the unmarried women worship this elephant by dancing, singing songs, and abstaining from eating salt. On the final day of Alunām, the clay elephant is immersed in some body of water ([[#Reference-idNaik1958|Naik, 1958]], p.&amp;nbsp;393).

Certain cultures also used elephant figurines to display the animal's importance. There was evidence of an ancient elephant cult in [[Sumatra]] ([[#Reference-idSchnitger1938|Schnitger, 1938]], p.&amp;nbsp;41). Stone elephant figurines were built as "seats of the souls" in the Sumatran culture ([[#Reference-idSchnitger1938|Schnitger, 1938]], p.&amp;nbsp;41). In [[North Borneo]], however, wooden elephant figurines were placed on the top of a bamboo pole. This bamboo pole was only erected after the tribe chief had collected a certain number of human heads ([[#Reference-idSchnitger1938|Schnitger, 1938]], p.&amp;nbsp;41).

==Wild mammals==
[[Image:Diane de Versailles Leochares 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Artemis]] with a deer, the ''[[Diana of Versailles]]'' in the Louvre ''Galerie des Caryatides'' that was designed for it]]

In North America the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes had as their chief deity a "mighty great [[hare]]" to whom they went at death. According to one account he lived in the east, according to another in the north. In his anthropomorphized form he was known as [[Nanabozho|Menabosho]] or [[Michabo]] ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51).

The [[Deer in mythology|deer]] is important in the mythology of many peoples. To the Greeks it was sacred to the goddess [[Artemis]], while in [[Hinduism]] it is linked to the goddess [[Saraswati]]. The deer also held spiritual significance to the pastoralist cultures of the [[Eurasian Steppe]]. The golden stag figurine found in the [[Pazyryk burials]] is one of the most famous pieces of Scythian art.

===Wolf===

{{See also|Cultural depictions of lions|Cats in ancient Egypt}}
The cult of the [[leopard]] is widely found in West Africa. Among the [[Ashanti people]] a man who kills one is liable to be put to death; no leopard skin may be exposed to view, but a stuffed leopard is worshipped. On the Gold Coast a leopard hunter who has killed his victim is carried round the town behind the body of the leopard; he may not speak, must besmear himself so as to look like a leopard and imitate its movements. In [[Kingdom of Loango|Loango]] a prince's cap is put upon the head of a dead leopard, and dances are held in its honour ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52).

In [[Ancient Egypt]], the first known cat-headed deity was [[Mafdet]]. During the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]] 2920–2770 BC, she was regarded as protector of the [[Pharaoh]]'s chambers against [[snake]]s, [[scorpion]]s and evil. She was often depicted with a head of a leopard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Divine Cat and the Snake in Egypt |author=Hornblower, G.D. |journal=Man |year=1943 |issue=43 |pages=85−87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[lion]]-headed deity [[Sekhmet]] was considered a daughter of [[Ra]] and was worshipped as protector of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Engels, D.W. |year=2001 |title=Classical Cats.

There was a lion-god at [[Baalbek]]. The [[Arabic mythology|pre-Islamic Arabs]] worshipped the lion-god [[Yaghuth]]. In modern Africa we find a lion-idol among the [[Balonda]] ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52). The lion was also sacred to [[Hebat]], the [[mother goddess]] of the [[Hurrians]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}

In [[Judaism]] the patriarch Jacob refers to his son Judah as a Gur Aryeh גּוּר אַרְיֵה יְהוּדָה, a "Young Lion" (Genesis 49:9) when blessing him. Thus the [[Lion of Judah]] started to be reverenced in some others abrahamic cults, symbolising their prophets, as such as [[Jesus]] and [[Haile Selassie I]], the ''ras'' Tafari.

In Mesoamerica [[Jaguars in Mesoamerican culture|the jaguar was revered]] as a symbol of fertility and warriorship among the [[Aztec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and [[Olmec]], and had an important role in shamanism.

===Tiger===
[[File:Durga Mahisasuramardini.JPG|thumb|upright|The Indian goddess [[Durga]] riding a tiger. Guler school, early 18th century.]]
{{See also|Tiger#Cultural depictions}}
Of great importance in Chinese myth and culture, the [[Tiger (zodiac)|Tiger]] is one of the 12 [[Chinese astrology|Chinese zodiac]] animals. Also in various [[Chinese art]] and martial art, the tiger is depicted as an earth symbol and equal rival of the [[Chinese dragon]]- the two representing matter and spirit respectively. The [[White Tiger (Chinese constellation)|White Tiger]] ({{zh|c=白虎|p=Bái Hǔ}}) is one of the [[Four Symbols (Chinese constellation)|Four Symbols]] of the [[Chinese constellation]]s. It is sometimes called the White Tiger of the West (西方白虎), and it represents the [[west]] and the autumn season ([[#Reference-idCooper1992|Cooper 1992]], pp.&amp;nbsp;226–27).

The tiger replaces the lion as king of the beasts in cultures of eastern Asia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.savechinastigers.org/node/316 |title=Tiger Culture &amp;#124; Save China's Tigers |publisher=English.savechinastigers.org |date= |accessdate=2009-03-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090212165117/http://english.savechinastigers.org/node/316| archivedate= 12 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing royalty, fearlessness and wrath.  In Chinese children stories, it is often depicted that the stripes on a tiger's forehead represent the character 王 ("king") ([[#Reference-idCooper1992|Cooper 1992]], pp.&amp;nbsp;226–27).

Some cultures that celebrated tiger worship are still represented contemporarily. In the suburbs of [[Kunming]], China, there is a tourist attraction where the tiger worship of the Yi is displayed for visitors. This attraction called the Solar Calendar Square is complete with a growling tiger statue, measuring to be five meters high ([[#Reference-idHarrell&amp;Yongxiang2003|Harrell &amp; Yongxiang 2003]], p.&amp;nbsp;380). In Chuxiong of China, a similar attraction exists. A tiger totem is presented for tourists; the totem portrays the Yi belief of the tiger setting the entire world in motion. A tiger dance of the Shuangbai County is also performed at such places explaining the history of the Yi and their worship of tigers ([[#Reference-idHarrell&amp;Yongxiang2003|Harrell &amp; Yongxiang 2003]], p.&amp;nbsp;380).

Along with these tourist attractions that display historical practices of the Yi, there is also additional evidence for tiger worship. Tigers were found depicted on small stones. These stones were pierced and worn as amulets, suggesting that the tiger had a certain power of protection for its wearer ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;76). The Queen Mother deity of the west, [[Queen Mother of the West|Hsi Wang Mu]], sometimes possessed a tail of a tiger in her depictions and, like the tiger, was associated with the mountains ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;76). The tiger was also a deity for both the Tungus and the Black Pottery people ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;80).

In many parts of Vietnam, the [[tiger]] is a revered creature. In each village, there might be a tiger temple. This worshiping practice might have stem from the fear of tigers used to raid human settlements in the ancient time. Tigers are admired for their great strength, ferocity and grace. Tiger is also considered a guardian deity. Tiger statutes are usually seen at the entrance of temples and palaces, keeping evil spirits from entering those places.

The tiger is associated with the [[Hindu]] deities [[Shiva]] and [[Durga]]. In [[Pokhara]], Nepal the tiger festival is known as [[Bagh Jatra]]. Celebrants dance disguised as tigers and "hunted". The [[Warli]] tribe of [[Maharashtra]], [[India]] worship Waghia the lord of tigers in the form of a shapeless stone ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52). In [[Vietnamese folk religion]] and [[Dongbei folk religion]] tiger-gods are also found.

===Monkey===
[[File:Hear speak see no evil Toshogu.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[three wise monkeys]] over the [[Nikkō Tōshō-gū|Tōshō-gū]] shrine in [[Nikkō]], [[Japan]]]]
{{Main|Monkey}}
In Hinduism the monkey deity, [[Hanuman]], is a prominent figure. He is a reincarnation of Shiva, the god of destruction. In orthodox villages monkeys are safe from harm ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52).

[[Chinese religions]] and [[Chinese mythology|mythologies]] give monkeys and apes [[Monkeys in Chinese culture#Religious significance|cultural significance]] as metaphors for people. Chinese deities sometimes appear in the guise of monkeys, for example, [[Sun Wukong]] or "Monkey King" is the main protagonist in [[Wu Cheng'en]]'s picaresque novel ''[[Journey to the West]]''. In traditional [[Chinese folk religion]], monkeys are supernatural beings that could [[shape shift]] into either monkey-demons or were-monkeys, and legends about monkey-human interbreeding are common. In [[Daoism]], monkeys, particularly gibbons, were believed to have longevity like a ''[[xian (Daoism)|xian]]'' "transcendent; immortal", and to be innately adept at circulating and absorbing ''[[qi]]'' "breath; life force" through the Daoist discipline of ''[[daoyin]]'' "guiding and pulling". Similar to Daoism, [[Chinese Buddhism]] paradoxically treats monkeys as both wise and foolish animals. On the one hand, the ''[[Jataka tales]]'' say that [[Gautama Buddha]] was a benevolent monkey king in an earlier incarnation; and on the other hand, monkeys symbolized trickery and ignorance, represented by the [[Chan Buddhist]] "[[mind monkey]]" metaphor for the unsettled, restless nature of human mentality.

Monkeys are said to be worshipped in [[Togo]]. At [[Porto Novo]], in French West Africa, twins have tutelary spirits in the shape of small monkeys ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52).

===Rodent===
In some countries, e.g. India, a small number of temples are dedicated to the worship of wild mice. Whilst widely regarded as a creature to be avoided, for pestilential reasons in such temples the animals are actively encouraged. It is frequently associated with Ganesh. As a creature capable of survival, it is to be revered and respected.

==Birds==

===Crow/raven===
{{Main|Raven in mythology}}

The [[Raven]] is the chief deity of the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] people of [[Alaska]]. All over that region it is the chief figure in a group of myths, fulfilling the office of a culture hero who brings the light, gives fire to mankind, and so on ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51). A raven story from the [[Puget Sound]] region describes the "Raven" as having originally lived in the land of spirits (literally ''bird land'') that existed before the world of humans. One day the Raven became so bored with ''bird land'' that he flew away, carrying a stone in his beak. When the Raven became tired of carrying the stone and dropped it, the stone fell into the ocean and expanded until it formed the firmament on which humans now live.

In the creator role, and in the Raven's role as the [[totem]] and [[Apical ancestor|ancestor]] of one of the four northwest clan houses, the Raven is often addressed as ''Grandfather Raven''. It is not clear whether this form of address is intended to refer to a [[Creator deity|creator]] Raven who is different from the [[trickster]] Raven, or if it is just a vain attempt to encourage the trickster spirit to act respectably.

Together with the eagle-hawk the crow plays a great part in the mythology of southeastern [[Australia]] ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51). Ravens also play a part in some European mythologies, such as in the [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Religions]], where they were connected to [[Bran the Blessed|Bran]] and the [[Morrigan]] in the former and [[Woden]] in the latter.

===Hawk===
North Borneo treated the [[hawk]] as a god, but it was technically the messenger of the people's Supreme God ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;62). There were rituals that involved the hawk when the natives wished to make decisions about certain events, such as journeys from home, major agricultural work, and war ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;62). In North [[Borneo]] we seem to see the evolution of a god in the three stages of the cult of the hawk among the [[Kenyahs]], the [[Kayans]] and the sea [[Dyaks]]. The Kenyahs will not kill it, address to it thanks for assistance, and formally consult it before leaving home on an expedition. It seems, however, to be regarded as the messenger of the supreme god Balli Penyalong. The Kayans have a hawk-god, [[Laki Neho]], but seem to regard the hawk as the servant of the chief god, [[Laki Tenangan]]. [[Singalang Burong]], the hawk-god of the Dyaks, is completely anthropomorphized. He is god of omens and ruler of the omen birds, but the hawk is not his messenger. For he never leaves his house. Stories are, however, told of his attending feasts in human form and flying away in hawk form when all was over ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52).

According to Florance Waterbury, hawk worship was universal ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;26). This particular bird was "a heavenly deity; its wings were the sky, the sun and moon were its eyes" ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;26). The hawk is commonly associated with the Egyptian god [[Horus]]. The souls of former pharaohs were the followers of Horus and therefore, the hawk ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;26). Horus was depicted by the Egyptians as a human body with a hawk head after the Fourth and Fifth Dynasty, but before that he was represented as a hawk ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;27).

Egypt was not the only location of hawk worshippers. There were several other cultures which held the hawk in high regard. The hawk was a deity on the island of Hawaii and symbolized swift justice ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;62). Along with the lone island from the Hawaiian archipelago, the Fiji islands also had some tribes who worshipped a hawk god ([[#Reference-idWaterbury1952|Waterbury 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;62). Furthermore, although animal worshipping is not a part of Sikh culture, a white falcon bird is mostly regarded in Sikhism as it was associated with the sixth guru and especially the tenth guru. The tenth guru would always carry a white falcon perched on his hand when going out to hunt. The tenth guru was known as the Master of White Hawk. Many people believe that the bird carried by Guru Gobind Singh was a hawk, however historians believe that the bird was a gyrfalcon or a saker falcon.

===Frigatebird===
On [[Easter Island]] until the 1860s there was a [[Tangata manu]] (Bird man) cult which has left us Paintings and [[Petroglyphs]] of Birdmen (half men half [[frigatebird]]s). The cult involved an annual race to collect the first [[sooty tern]] egg of the season from the islet of [[Motu Iti (Rapa Nui)|Moto Iti]] and take it to [[Orongo]].

The Frigate Bird Cult is thought to have originated in the Solomon Islands before immigrating to Easter Island where it became obsolete ([[#Reference-idBalfour1917|Balfour 1917]], p.&amp;nbsp;374). The Frigate-Bird was a representation of the god [[Makemake (mythology)|Make-make]], the god of the seabird's egg on Easter Island ([[#Reference-idBalfour1917|Balfour 1917]], p.&amp;nbsp;374).

==Other non-mammals==

===Serpent===
{{Main|Snake worship }}
[[Image:Naga3.jpg|thumb| right|The altar where serpent deities are worshipped in a temple in [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]], [[Karnataka]], India]]
[[Image:Quetzalcoatl telleriano.jpg|thumb|right|Quetzalcoatl depicted as a snake devouring a man, from the [[Codex Telleriano-Remensis]].]]
The worship of the serpent is found in many parts of the [[Old World]], and in the Americas ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52).

In India [[snake worship]] refers to the high status of [[snake]]s in [[Hindu mythology]]. Over a large part of India there are carved representations of cobras ([[Naga (mythology)|nagas]]) or stones as substitutes. To these human food and flowers are offered and lights are burned before the shrines. Among the Dravidians a cobra which is accidentally killed is burned like a human being; no one would kill one intentionally. The serpent-god's image is carried in an annual procession by a celibate priestess ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52).

At one time there were many prevalent different renditions of the serpent cult located in India. In Northern India, a masculine version of the serpent named Nagaraja and known as the "king of the serpents" was worshipped. Instead of the "king of the serpents," actual live snakes were worshipped in South India ([[#Reference-idBhattacharyya1965|Bhattacharyya 1965]], p.&amp;nbsp;1). The Manasa-cult in Bengal, India, however, was dedicated to the anthropomorphic serpent goddess, [[Manasa]] ([[#Reference-idBhattacharyya1965|Bhattacharyya 1965]], p.&amp;nbsp;1).

In Africa the chief centre of [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] worship was [[Dahomey]]. but the cult of the python seems to have been of exotic origin, dating back to the first quarter of the 17th century. By the conquest of Whydah the Dahomeyans were brought in contact with a people of serpent worshippers, and ended by adopting from them the beliefs which they at first despised. At Whydah, the chief centre, there is a serpent temple, tenanted by some fifty snakes. Every python of the ''danh-gbi'' kind must be treated with respect, and death is the penalty for killing one, even by accident. ''Danh-gbi'' has numerous wives, who until 1857 took part in a public procession from which the profane crowd was excluded; a python was carried round the town in a hammock, perhaps as a ceremony for the expulsion of evils. The rainbow-god of the Ashanti was also conceived to have the form of a snake. His messenger was said to be a small variety of boa. but only certain individuals, not the whole species, were sacred. In many parts of Africa the serpent is looked upon as the incarnation of deceased relatives. Among the Amazulu, as among the [[Betsileo]] of Madagascar, certain species are assigned as the abode of certain classes. The [[Maasai people|Maasai]], on the other hand, regard each species as the habitat of a particular family of the tribe ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;52).

The Ancient Egyptians worshiped a number of snake gods, including [[Apep|Apophis]] and [[Set (mythology)|Set]], and the Sumerians before them had a serpent god [[Ningizzida]].

===Fish===
{{Main|Fish in culture}}

[[Image:Dagon1.jpg|thumb|A modern interpretation of Dagon as a "fish-god"]]
According to the [[Jewish]] scholar [[Rashi]], the [[Canaan]]ite god [[Dagon]] was a fish god. This tradition may have originated here, with a misinterpretation, but recently uncovered [[relief]]s suggest a fish-god with human head and hands was worshipped by people who wore fish-skins ([[#CITEREFThomas1911|Thomas 1911]], p.&amp;nbsp;51).

In Japan, there was a deity called Ebisu-gami who, according to Sakurada Katsunori, was widely revered by fishing communities and industries ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Qtd. in Naumann, 1974]], p.&amp;nbsp;1). Ebisu, in later traditions, normally appeared in the form of a fisherman holding a fishing pole and carrying a red tai (a perch), but would sometimes take the form of a whale, shark, human corpse, or rock ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&amp;nbsp;1). The general image of Ebisu, however, appears to be the whale or the shark, according to Sakurada ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Qtd. in Naumann, 1974]], p.&amp;nbsp;2).

During Ebisu-gami festivals, there have been legends told of strange fish creatures which have arrived and been considered sacred. Examples of such fish creatures include familiar species of fish with multiple tails ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&amp;nbsp;2). Sometimes these fish were considered to be simply an offering to the deity. Other times, however, they were considered to be Ebisu himself, visiting on the festival day ([[#Reference-idNaumann1974|Naumann, 1974]], p.&amp;nbsp;2). Large marine [[megafauna]]s such as whales and [[whale shark]]s (also called as "Ebisu-shark") were often referred as Ebisu himself to bring mass of fish among them, and as guardians of fishermen.&lt;ref name="大藤1955" /&gt;

==Oracular animals==
Animals are frequently used for the purposes of [[divination]].
[[Bird]]s are especially common in this role, as by their faculty of flight they offer themselves to the interpretation as messengers between the celestial and human spheres. [[Augury]] was a highly developed practice of telling the future from the flight of birds in [[Classical Antiquity]]. The [[dove]] appears as an oracular animal in the story of [[Noah]], and also in [[Thisbe]] in [[Boeotia]] there was a dove-oracle of [[Zeus]]. Animal imagery was also often employed in the [[oracle|oracular utterances]] in Ancient Greece ([[#Reference-idLightfoot2008|Lightfoot 2008]], p.&amp;nbsp;237,&amp;nbsp;fn.&amp;nbsp;105). [[Parrot astrology]] is a form of divination using [[green parakeet]]s which originated in South India and is still practised in modern times.&lt;ref name=sing&gt;{{cite web|last=Naidu Ratnala|first=Thulaja|title=Parrot astrologers|url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_602_2005-01-04.html|work=National Library Board Singapore|accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Chinese traditional religion]], the [[tortoise]] is an oracular animal.

Notable oracular animals of the modern period include [[Lady Wonder]], [[Punxsutawney Phil]], [[Maggie the Monkey]], [[Lazdeika the Crab]], [[Paul the Octopus]], and [[Sonny Wool]].

==Shamanism and animals==
{{Main|Shamanism}}
Animals were an important aspect of the Shaman religion in Central Asia. Also known as "assistant spirits," "guardian spirits," and "helping spirits," animal spirits are an integral part of a shaman's work. The more animal spirits a shaman had under his control, the more powerful the shaman ([[#Reference-idWaida1983|Waida, 1983]], p.&amp;nbsp;228-229). When a shaman set out to journey spiritually to the outer world, animals were a key component, assisting him in his work. There were three primary reasons for a shaman to take such a journey: to find a lost soul, to bring an animal spirit to the high gods, or to lead a soul to its new resting place in the underworld. All of these were extremely important to followers of shamanism and animals were extremely important in facilitating the shaman's efforts ([[#Reference-idWaida1983|Waida, 1983]], p.&amp;nbsp;231).

An example of animal spirits in Shamanism comes from the Yenisei Ostiaks culture. During a healing procedure, a shaman invokes a number of animal spirits to help him. The spirits arrive and enter his body. The shaman is not possessed by these spirits; he is free to expel them at any time ([[#Reference-idWaida1983|Waida, 1983]], p.&amp;nbsp;223). His body begins to leap all over the place, symbolizing that his soul is rising, leaving the earth and going up to the sky. It is a bird spirit that is lifting him through the atmosphere and he cries for it to take him higher so he can see further. According to Adolf Friedrich, at this point the shaman's essence has, in fact, transformed into the bird spirit that crossed the threshold into his body ([[#Reference-idWaida1983|Waida, 1983]], p.&amp;nbsp;223). He finally spots what he is looking for, the soul of his ill patient. Still assisting him, the animal spirits carry the shaman to the patient's soul. The shaman retrieves it and returns the soul to its rightful place, healing the patient. Without the presence of animal spirits, the shaman could not have accomplished such a feat ([[#Reference-idWaida1983|Waida, 1983]], p.&amp;nbsp;231).

In the Inner Eurasian religion, the transformation of a shaman's essence into an animal spirit is referred to as "becoming animal" ([[#Reference-idBaldick2000|Baldick 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;167). The importance of animals in this shamanic religion is shown by the capabilities that animals grant to human beings. Without the assistance of animals, humans from Inner Eurasia were not capable of reaching the sky, traveling rapidly throughout the earth, or going beneath the earth's outer crust, all of which were important activities to the culture ([[#Reference-idBaldick2000|Baldick 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;167). Heaven was not attainable for a person without the assistance of an eagle. Because of the eagle, an animal, the Inner Eurasians believed that they were capable of achieving their after-life and living in the home of their ancestors and Supreme God after their departure from the earth ([[#Reference-idBaldick2000|Baldick 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;167). Heaven was represented by the people in assemblies of animals, usually grouped in sevens or nines ([[#Reference-idBaldick2000|Baldick 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;167). When participating in hunting or warfare, Inner Eurasians also took on animal qualities because they believed it would increase their success ([[#Reference-idBaldick2000|Baldick 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;167). Animals were a central part of this religion ([[#Reference-idBaldick2000|Baldick 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;167).

==Religion and animals==

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Animals in Buddhism}}
{{see also|Life release|Buddhist vegetarianism}}

One of the most important sanctions of the [[Buddhist]] faith is the concept of [[ahimsa]], or refraining from the destruction of life ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;234). According to Buddhist belief, humans do not deserve preferential treatment over other living beings. Thus, the world is not specifically meant for human use and should be shared equally amongst all creatures ([[#Reference-idEpstein1990|Epstein 1990]]). Buddhists recognize that all animals are sentient and are capable of feeling pain, grief, fear, happiness, and hunger ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], pp.&amp;nbsp;234–235). The [[Dalai Lama]] once said "Even ants and other insects will run away from danger... They have intelligence and want to live too. Why should we harm them?" ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Qtd. in Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;235). Not believing in inflicting harm on any living, sentient being, some Buddhists also follow a [[vegetarian]] diet to avoid causing pain to animals ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;238).

Avoiding the destruction of life can affect aspects beyond a Buddhist's diet, such as travel plans. In order to avoid crushing any living thing, be it plant, insect, or animal, some Buddhist [[monk]]s do not travel during rainy seasons ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;236). Originally, shortly after Buddhism was first founded, monks traveled during all seasons, but public opinion changed this. The people protested that so much life was crushed and destroyed when monks traveled during the wet season. As a result, monks were required to seek shelter during this season and abstain from journeys ([[#Reference-idChapple1993|Chapple 1993]], p.&amp;nbsp;22).

Living creatures, including humans, culminate to form one large, united life-force in the Buddhist religion. Buddhists, therefore, believe that to harm another living creature is to, in fact, harm yourself as all life-forms are interrelated ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;237). There are many tales that depict humans sacrificing their lives so that an animal may live. A [[jataka]], or previous incarnation story, tells how the Buddha, (upon hearing the distraught cries of a lioness struggling to feed her hungry cubs), leapt from a cliff and smashed his body to death as an offering, so that she could feed his flesh to them ([[#Reference-idChapple1993|Chapple 1993]]).

===Hinduism===
{{main|Cow protection movement|Cattle slaughter in India|Elephants in Kerala culture|Lion Capital of Ashoka}}
{{see also|Animal sacrifice in Hinduism|Ashvamedha}}

[[Hinduism]] is one of the six primary [[Religions in India|religions]] of [[India]] ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;221). Hinduism has evolved over several centuries from [[Vedas|Vedic]] times when there was no restriction on animal worship and also animal consumption for food, to later [[Buddhist]] and [[Jainism|Jain]]-influenced [[eras]] that led to a wider concept adoption of [[non-violence]] or [[ahimsa]] and respect for animals,  as a major constituent in [[Dharmic]] belief systems ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;223). Humans and animals are believed to be one family and therefore, humans should treat all living creatures with respect and kindness. It is also believed that human beings themselves [[Re-incarnation|re-incarnate]] as animals based on their deeds or [[karma]]. Pets are often treated as if they are truly members of the family ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;223-224).

There are some exceptions to ahimsa in Hinduism - mainly dealing with religious rituals to please gods on [[Animal sacrifice in Hinduism#Animal sacrifice in contemporary Hindu society|special occasions]] and for daily sustenance. While Hindu belief proscribes the slaughter for human pleasure or lavishness {{citation needed|date=June 2017}}, animal sacrifice has been an accepted ritual in ''some'' parts of India ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;225).An example of such lavishness would be hunting for pleasure, a fur coat made from animal skin, etc. An explanation for this supposed paradox is that a sacrificial animal is not really considered to be an animal, but a symbol. Thus, when the animal is sacrificed, they are sacrificing the symbol and not the animal ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;226).

===Jainism===
{{main|Ahimsa in Jainism}}
{{see also|Jain vegetarianism}}

[[Mahavira]], the founder of [[Jainism]], believed that the only way to be released from the cycle of life (birth, death, and then rebirth), one must follow, like Buddhists, ahimsa and not harm any living creature ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;229). Some Jains will carry a broom with them and sweep their path as they walk to avoid stepping on any living creature. Jains will also wear masks over their mouths to prevent swallowing insects and inspect their fruit for worms. The fruit inspection is not, however, because of their aversion of worms, but for the protection of the worms themselves ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;229-230). Jains are also only allowed to eat during daylight hours, when their vision is not restricted, so that they avoid eating insects or other small creatures that could possibly be in their food ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;230).

Jainism includes a lay form which is somewhat less restrictive ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;231). Basically lay Jains must distinguish between what forms of violence are necessary and unnecessary, but do not have to abstain entirely ([[#Reference-idVallely2002|Vallely 2002]], p.&amp;nbsp;5). This results in avoiding all forms of hunting, tilling the soil (tilling involved disturbing creatures embedded in the earth), and brewing (brewing involved using living organisms such as yeasts) ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;231).

Food will never be prepared especially for them. They beg for food from others believing that because the food was prepared for someone else, they are not the cause of violence towards living creatures ([[#Reference-idVallely2002|Vallely 2002]], p.&amp;nbsp;5).

Lay Jains, who have the financial capacity, will visit animal markets and buy/rescue animals destined for slaughter for the good that it does. ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;232).

The '''arabesque''' is a form of artistic decoration consisting of "surface decorations based on rhythmic linear patterns of scrolling and interlacing foliage, tendrils" or plain lines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Fleming, John |author2=Honour, Hugh |title=Dictionary of the Decorative Arts |year=1977 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-670-82047-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; often combined with other elements. Another definition is "Foliate ornament, used in the Islamic world, typically using leaves, derived from stylised [[half-palmette]]s, which were combined with spiralling stems".&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 236&lt;/ref&gt;  It usually consists of a single design which can be '[[tessellation|tiled]]' or seamlessly repeated as many times as desired.&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{cite book |author=Robinson, Francis |title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-521-66993-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the very wide range of [[Eurasia]]n decorative art that includes [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s matching this basic definition, the term "arabesque" is used consistently as a technical term by [[history of art|art historians]] to describe only elements of the decoration found in two phases: [[Islamic art]] from about the 9th century onwards, and European decorative art from the [[Renaissance]] onwards. [[Interlace (art)|Interlace]] and [[Scroll (art)|scroll]] decoration are terms used for most other types of similar patterns.

Arabesques are a fundamental element of Islamic art but they develop what was already a long tradition by the coming of Islam. The past and current usage of the term in respect of European art can only be described as confused and inconsistent. Some Western arabesques derive from Islamic art, but others are closely based on [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] decorations. In the West they are essentially found in the [[decorative arts]], but because of the generally non-figurative nature of Islamic art, arabesque decoration is there often a very prominent element in the most significant works, and plays a large part in the decoration of [[Islamic architecture|architecture]].

Claims are often made regarding the theological significance of the arabesque, and its origin in a specifically Islamic view of the world; however these are without support from written historical sources as, like most medieval cultures, the Islamic world has not left us documentation of their intentions in using the decorative motifs they did.  At the popular level such theories often appear uninformed as to the wider context of the arabesque.&lt;ref&gt;Tabbaa, 74-77&lt;/ref&gt;  In similar fashion, proposed connections between the arabesque and Arabic knowledge of [[geometry]] remains a subject of debate; not all art historians are persuaded that such knowledge had reached, or was needed by, those creating arabesque designs, although in certain cases there is evidence that such a connection did exist.&lt;ref&gt;Tabbaa, 88&lt;/ref&gt;  The case for a connection with [[Islamic mathematics]] is much stronger for the development of the [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]] with which arabesques are often combined in art.  Geometric decoration often uses patterns that are made up of straight lines and regular angles that somewhat resemble curvilinear arabesque patterns; the extent to which these too are described as arabesque varies between different writers.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabesque is a French term that derived from the Italian word Arabesco, and it means Arabic style. 

The development of this and related terms in the main European languages is complicated, and described in "Western arabesque" below.

== Islamic arabesque ==
The arabesque developed out of the long-established traditions of plant-based [[scroll (art)|scroll]] ornament in the cultures taken over by the early [[Islamic conquests]].  Early Islamic art, for example in the famous 8th century [[mosaic]]s of the [[Umayyad Mosque|Great Mosque of Damascus]], often contained plant-scroll patterns, in that case by Byzantine artists in their usual style.  The plants most often used are stylized versions of the [[Acanthus mollis|acanthus]], with its emphasis on leafy forms, and the vine, with an equal emphasis on twining stems.  The evolution of these forms into a distinctive Islamic type was complete by the 11th century, having begun in the 8th or 9th century in works like the [[Mshatta Facade]]. In the process of development the plant forms became increasing simplified and stylized.&lt;ref&gt;Tabbaa, 75-88; Canby, 26&lt;/ref&gt;  The relatively abundant survivals of [[stucco]] [[relief]]s from the walls of palaces (but not mosques) in [[Abbasid Samarra]], the Islamic capital between 836 and 892, provide examples of three styles, Styles A, B, and C, though more than one of these may appear on the same wall, and their chronological sequence is not certain.&lt;ref&gt;Necipoğlu, Gülru, Payne, Alina, ''Histories of Ornament: From Global to Local'', 88-90, 2016, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|0691167281}}, 978069116728, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9nACCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88 google books]; [https://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/museums/mik/miksamarra.html "Museum of Islamic Art, Berlin: Objects from Samarra"]; Ettinghausen et al, 57-59; examples of styles A,B, and C illustrated.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Though the broad outline of the process is generally agreed, there is a considerable  diversity of views held by specialist scholars on detailed issues concerning the development, categorization and meaning of the arabesque.&lt;ref&gt;Tabbaa's Chapter 4 gives an overview of these questions.&lt;/ref&gt;  The detailed study of Islamic arabesque forms was begun by [[Alois Riegl]] in his [[formalism (art)|formalist]] study ''[[Stilfragen|Stilfragen: Grundlegungen zu einer Geschichte der Ornamentik]]'' (''Problems of style: foundations for a history of ornament'') of 1893, who in the process developed his influential concept of the ''Kunstwollen''.&lt;ref&gt;Tabbaa, 74-75&lt;/ref&gt;  Riegl traced formalistic continuity and development in decorative plant forms from [[ancient Egyptian art]] and other ancient Near Eastern civilizations through the classical world to the Islamic arabesque.  While the ''Kunstwollen'' has few followers today, his basic analysis of the development of forms has been confirmed and refined by the wider ''corpus'' of examples known today.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 24-25; see also [http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/-8220-Style-8221-151-or-whatever-4745 "“Style”—or whatever", J. Duncan Berry], A review of ''Problems of Style'' by Alois Riegl, ''[[The New Criterion]]'', April 1993&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jessica Rawson]] has recently extended the analysis to cover [[Chinese art]], which Riegl did not cover, tracing many elements of Chinese decoration back to the same tradition; the shared background helping to make the assimilation of Chinese motifs into Persian art after the [[History of Iran#Mongol invasion .281219.E2.80.931221.29|Mongol invasion]] harmonious and productive.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, the subject of her book, see Preface, and Chapter 5 on Chinese influences on Persian art.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many arabesque patterns disappear at (or "under" as it often appears to a viewer) a framing edge without ending, and thus can be regarded as infinitely extendable outside the space they actually occupy; this was certainly a distinctive feature of the Islamic form, though not without precedent.  Most but not all foliage decoration in the preceding cultures terminated at the edge of the occupied space, although infinitely repeatable patterns in foliage are very common in the modern world in [[wallpaper]] and [[textile]]s.

Typically, in earlier forms there is no attempt at realism; no particular species of plant is being imitated, and the forms are often botanically impossible or implausible. "Leaf" forms typically spring sideways from the stem, in what is often called a "half-[[palmette]]" form, named after its distant and very different looking ancestor in ancient Egyptian and Greek ornament.  New stems spring from leaf-tips, a type often called [[honeysuckle]], and the stems often have no tips, winding endlessly out of the space.  The early [[Mshatta Facade]] is recognisably some sort of vine, with conventional leaves on the end of short stalks and bunches of grapes or berries, but later forms usually lack these.  Flowers are rare until about 1500, after which they appear more often, especially in Ottoman art, and are often identifiable by species.  In Ottoman art the large and feathery leaves called ''saz'' became very popular, and were elaborated in drawings showing just one or more large leaves.  Eventually floral decoration mostly derived from Chinese styles, especially those of [[Chinese porcelain]], replaces the arabesque in many types of work, such as pottery, textiles and miniatures.

=== Significance in Islam ===

[[File:Alhambra (038).jpg|thumb|upright|Three modes: Arabesques, [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]] and [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]] used together in the [[Court of the Myrtles]], [[Alhambra]].]]

The arabesques and [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]] of Islamic art are often said to arise from the [[Islam]]ic view of the world (see above). The [[Aniconism in Islam|depiction of animals and people is generally discouraged]], which explains the preference for abstract geometric patterns.

There are two modes to arabesque art. The first recalls the principles that govern the order of the world. These principles include the bare basics of what makes objects structurally sound and, by extension, beautiful (i.e. the angle and the fixed/static shapes that it creates—esp. the [[truss]]). In the first mode, each repeating geometric form has a built-in symbolism ascribed to it. For example, the square, with its four [[equilateral]] sides, is symbolic of the equally important elements of nature: [[soil|earth]], [[air]], [[fire]] and [[water]]. Without any one of the four, the physical world, represented by a circle that inscribes the square, would collapse upon itself and cease to exist. The second mode is based upon the flowing nature of [[plant]] forms. This mode recalls the [[female|feminine]] nature of life giving. In addition, upon inspection of the many examples of Arabesque art, some would argue that there is in fact a third mode, the mode of [[Islamic calligraphy]].

Instead of recalling something related to the 'True Reality' (the reality of the spiritual world), Islam considers [[calligraphy]] a visible expression of the highest art of all; the art of the spoken word (the transmittal of thoughts and of history). In Islam, the most important document to be transmitted orally is the [[Qur'an]]. [[Proverb]]s and complete passages from the Qur'an can be seen today in Arabesque art. The coming together of these three forms creates the Arabesque, and this is a reflection of unity arising from diversity; a basic tenet of Islam.

The arabesque may be equally thought of as both [[art]] and [[science]]. The artwork is at the same time [[mathematical]]ly precise, aesthetically pleasing, and symbolic. Due to this duality of creation, the artistic part of this equation may be further subdivided into both [[secular]] and [[religious]] artwork. However, for many Muslims there is no distinction; all forms of art, the natural world, mathematics and science are seen to be creations of God and therefore reflections of the same thing: God's will expressed through his creation. In other words, man can discover the geometric forms that constitute the arabesque, but these forms always existed before as part of God's creation, as shown in this picture.

There is great similarity between arabesque artwork from very different geographic regions.&lt;ref name=Wade&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wade |first1=David |title=The Evolution of Style |url=http://patterninislamicart.com/background-notes/the-evolution-of-style |website=Pattern in Islamic Art |accessdate=19 December 2015 |date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the similarities are so pronounced that it is sometimes difficult for experts to tell where a given style of arabesque comes from. The reason for this is that the science and mathematics that are used to construct Arabesque artwork are universal. Therefore, for most Muslims, the best artwork that can be created by man for use in the [[Mosque]] is artwork that displays the underlying order and unity of nature. The order and unity of the material world, they believe, is a mere [[ghost]]ly approximation of the [[spirit]]ual world, which for many Muslims is the place where the only true reality exists. Discovered geometric forms, therefore, exemplify this perfect reality because God's creation has been obscured by the [[sin]]s of man.

Mistakes in repetitions may be intentionally introduced as a show of humility by artists who believe only Allah can produce perfection, although this theory is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Islamic Textile Art: Anomalies in Kilims |author=Thompson, Muhammad |author2=Begum, Nasima |url=http://www.turkotek.com/salon_00101/salon.html |work=Salon du Tapis d'Orient |publisher=TurkoTek |accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The future of art in a digital age: from Hellenistic to Hebraic consciousness |last=Alexenberg |first=Melvin L. |year=2006 |publisher=Intellect Ltd |isbn=1-84150-136-0 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Only God is Perfect |url=http://www.geometricdesign.co.uk/perfect.htm |work=Islamic and Geometric Art |author=Backhouse, Tim |accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Arabesque art consists of a series of repeating geometric forms which are occasionally accompanied by [[calligraphy]]. Ettinghausen et al. describe the arabesque as a "vegetal design consisting of full...and half [[palmette]]s [as] an unending continuous pattern...in which each leaf grows out of the tip of another."&lt;ref&gt;Ettinghausen et al, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; To the adherents of [[Islam]], the Arabesque is symbolic of their united faith and the way in which traditional Islamic cultures view the world.

==Western arabesque==
[[File:Tapis de Savonnerie Louis XIV apres Charles Le Brun pour la Grande Galerie du Louvre.jpg|thumb|The French sense of arabesque: [[Savonnerie]] carpet after [[Charles Le Brun]] for the ''Grande Galerie'' of the [[Louvre]].]]
[[File:Царское-село,-Екатерининский-дворец.jpg|thumb|What is called the "Arabesque Room" in the [[Catherine Palace]], with [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] [[grotesque]] decoration.|221x221px]]
The term arabesque was first used in the West in [[Italian language|Italian]], where ''rabeschi'' was used in the 16th century as a term for "[[pilaster]] ornaments featuring [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] decoration",&lt;ref name="Osborne, 34"&gt;Osborne, 34&lt;/ref&gt; specifically "running scrolls" that ran vertically up a panel or pilaster, rather than horizontally along a [[frieze]].&lt;ref&gt;Fuhring, 159&lt;/ref&gt;  The book ''Opera nuova che insegna a le donne a cuscire … laqual e intitolata Esempio di raccammi'' (A New Work that Teaches Women how to Sew … Entitled "Samples of Embroidery"), published in Venice in 1530, includes "groppi moreschi e rabeschi", Moorish knots and arabesques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/35.75.3 Met Museum]; the Italian word uses the Latin derived "inceptive" or "inchoative" word ending "-esco" signifying a beginning, thus ''ferveo'', to boil and ''fervesco'' to begin to boil.&lt;/ref&gt;

From there it spread to England, where [[Henry VIII]] owned, in an inventory of 1549, an [[agate]] cup with a "fote and Couer of siluer and guilt enbossed with Rebeske worke",&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Arabesque":"1549 Inventory Henry VIII (1998) 25/2 Item one Cuppe of Agathe the fote and Couer of siluer and guilt enbossed with Rebeske worke";&lt;/ref&gt; and William Herne or Heron, [[Serjeant Painter]] from 1572 to 1580, was paid for painting Elizabeth I's barge with "rebeske work".&lt;ref&gt;"rebeske" being a now disused version of "arabesque", see OED, "Rebesk". Herne payment quoted in [[Erna Auerbach]], ''Tudor Artists'', 1954; not in print OED&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately the styles so described can only be guessed at, although the design by [[Hans Holbein the younger|Hans Holbein]] for a covered cup for [[Jane Seymour]] in 1536 (see gallery) already has zones in both Islamic-derived arabesque/moresque style (see below) and classically derived [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus volutes]].&lt;ref name=marks&gt;Marks, Richard and Williamson, Paul, eds. ''Gothic: Art for England 1400-1547'', 156, 2003, V&amp;A Publications, London, {{ISBN|1-85177-401-7}}.  For other Renaissance ornament from Henry's court, see also no 13 on page 156, and pp. 144-145, 148-149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another related term is [[moresque]], meaning "[[Moors|Moorish]]"; [[Randle Cotgrave]]'s ''A Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues'' of 1611 defines this as: "a rude or anticke painting, or carving, wherin the feet and tayles of beasts, &amp;c, are intermingled with, or made to resemble, a kind of wild leaves, &amp;c."&lt;ref&gt;OED, "Moresque", citing Cotgrave&lt;/ref&gt; and "arabesque", in its earliest use cited in the [[OED]] (but as a French word), as "Rebeske work; a small and curious flourishing".&lt;ref name="OED, Arabesque"&gt;OED, "Arabesque"&lt;/ref&gt;  In France "arabesque" first appears in 1546,&lt;ref&gt;Larrouse dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; and "was first applied in the latter part of the 17th century" to [[grotesque]] ornament, "despite the classical origin of the latter", especially if without human figures in it - a distinction still often made, but not consistently observed,&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, 34 (quoted), see also [[OED]] quoted below and Cotgrave - Osborne says the French usage begins in the "latter part of the 17th century" but in the following paragraphs describes a development beginning rather before this.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the following centuries the three terms grotesque, moresque and arabesque were used largely interchangeably in English, French and German for styles of decoration derived at least as much from the European past as the Islamic world, with "grotesque" gradually acquiring its main modern meaning, related more to Gothic [[gargoyle]]s and [[caricature]] than to either [[Pompeii]]-style Roman painting or Islamic patterns.  Meanwhile, the word "arabesque" was now being applied to Islamic art itself, by 1851 at the latest, when [[John Ruskin]] uses it in ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'', [http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/sov/1.html chapter 1, para 26]&lt;/ref&gt;  Writers over the last decades have attempted to salvage meaningful distinctions between the words from the confused wreckage of historical sources.

Peter Fuhring, a specialist in the history of ornament, says that (also in a French context): &lt;blockquote&gt;The ornament known as moresque in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries (but now more commonly called arabesque) is characterized by bifurcated scrolls composed of branches forming interlaced foliage patterns.  These basic motifs gave rise to numerous variants, for example, where the branches, generally of a linear character, were turned into straps or bands. ... It is characteristic of the moresque, which is essentially a surface ornament, that it is impossible to locate the pattern's beginning or end. ... Originating in the Middle East, they were introduced to continental Europe via Italy and Spain ... Italian examples of this ornament, which was often used for bookbindings and embroidery, are known from as early as the late fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Fuhring, 162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fuhring notes that grotesques were "confusingly called arabesques in eighteenth century France", but in his terminology "the major types of ornament that appear in French sixteenth century etchings and engraving... can be divided into two groups. The first includes ornaments adopted from antiquity: grotesques, architectural ornaments such as the orders, foliage scrolls and self-contained elements such as trophies, terms and vases. A second group, far smaller than the first, comprises modern ornaments: moresques, interlaced bands, strapwork, and elements such as cartouches...", categories he goes on to discuss individually.&lt;ref&gt;Fuhring, 155-156&lt;/ref&gt;

The moresque or arabesque style was especially popular and long-lived in the Western arts of the book: [[bookbinding]]s decorated in gold tooling, borders for illustrations, and printer's ornaments for decorating empty spaces on the page. In this field the technique of gold tooling had also arrived in the 15th century from the Islamic world, and indeed much of the leather itself was imported from there.&lt;ref&gt;Harthan, 10-12&lt;/ref&gt;  Small motifs in this style have continued to be used by conservative book designers up to the present day.

According to Harold Osborne, in France, the "characteristic development of the French arabesque combined bandwork deriving from the moresque with decorative acanthus foliage radiating from C-scrolls connected by short bars".&lt;ref name="Osborne, 34"/&gt; Apparently starting in [[embroidery]], it then appears in garden design before being used in [[Northern Mannerist]] painted decorative schemes "with a central medallion combined with acanthus and other forms" by [[Simon Vouet]] and then [[Charles Lebrun]] who used "scrolls of flat bandwork joined by horizontal bars and contrasting with ancanthus scrolls and [[palmette]]."&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, 34-35&lt;/ref&gt; More exuberant arabesque designs by [[Jean Bérain the Elder]] are an early "intimation" of the [[Rococo]], which was to take the arabesque into three dimensions in reliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of "arabesque" as an English noun first appears, in relation to painting, in [[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]]'s novel ''[[Vathek]]'' in 1786.&lt;ref name="OED, Arabesque"/&gt;
Arabesque is also used as a term for complex freehand pen flourishes in drawing or other graphic media. The ''[[Grove Dictionary of Art]]'' will have none of this confusion, and says flatly: "Over the centuries the word has been applied to a wide variety of winding and twining vegetal decoration in art and meandering themes in music, but it properly applies only to Islamic art",&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford Art Online]], "Arabesque", accessed March 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; so contradicting the definition of 1888 still found in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'': "A species of mural or surface decoration in colour or low relief, composed in flowing lines of branches, leaves, and scroll-work fancifully intertwined. Also fig[uratively]. As used in Moorish and Arabic decorative art (from which, almost exclusively, it was known in the Middle Ages), representations of living creatures were excluded; but in the arabesques of [[Raphael]], founded on the ancient Græco-Roman work of this kind, and in those of Renaissance decoration, human and animal figures, both natural and grotesque, as well as vases, armour, and objects of art, are freely introduced; to this the term is now usually applied, the other being distinguished as Moorish Arabesque, or Moresque."&lt;ref&gt;OED, printed and online editions (accessed March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Printing==
A major use of the arabesque style has been artistic printing, for example of book covers and page decoration. Repeating geometric patterns worked well with traditional printing, since they could be printed from metal type like letters if the type was placed together; as the designs have no specific connection to the meaning of a text, the type can be reused in many different editions of different works. [[Robert Granjon]], a French printer of the sixteenth century, has been credited with the first truly interlocking arabesque printing, but other printers had used many other kinds of ornaments in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Henry Lewis|title=Decorative ornaments and alphabets of the Renaissance : 1,020 copyright-free motifs from printed sources|date=1991|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|isbn=9780486266053}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was rapidly used by many other printers.&lt;ref name="Hoefler Text: Arabesques"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hoefler Text: Arabesques|url=http://www.typography.com/fonts/hoefler-text/features/hoefler-text-arabesques-patterns|publisher=Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="English printers' ornaments"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plomer|first1=Henry R.|title=English printers' ornaments|date=1924|publisher=Martino Pub.|location=Mansfield Center, CT|isbn=9781578987153|url=https://archive.org/details/englishprinterso00plom|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Historic Design in Printing"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Henry Lewis|title=Historic Design in Printing|date=1923|publisher=Graphic Arts Company|location=Boston, MA|url=https://archive.org/details/historicdesignin00john|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a period of disuse in the nineteenth century, when a more minimal page layout became popular with printers like [[Giambattista Bodoni|Bodoni]] and [[Firmin Didot|Didot]], the concept returned to popularity with the arrival of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], Many fine books from the period 1890-1960 have arabesque decorations, sometimes on paperback covers.&lt;ref name="The craftsman and the critic : defining usefulness and beauty in arts and crafts-era Boston"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brandt|first1=Beverly K.|title=The craftsman and the critic : defining usefulness and beauty in arts and crafts-era Boston|date=2009|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|location=Amherst|isbn=9781558496774|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many digital [[serif font]]s include arabesque pattern elements thought to be complementary to the mood of the font; they are also often sold as separate designs.&lt;ref name="Moresque 2D"&gt;{{cite web |title=Moresque 2D |url=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/2d-typo/moreske-2d/ |website=MyFonts |accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''base pair''' ('''bp''') is a unit consisting of two [[nucleobase]]s bound to each other by [[hydrogen bond]]s.  They form the building blocks of the [[DNA]] double helix and contribute to the folded structure of both DNA and [[RNA]]. Dictated by specific [[hydrogen bond]]ing patterns, Watson-Crick base pairs ([[guanine]]-[[cytosine]] and [[adenine]]-[[thymine]]) allow the DNA helix to maintain a regular helical structure that is subtly dependent on its [[nucleotide sequence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sequence-Dependent Variability of B-DNA | doi=10.1007/0-387-29148-2_2 | journal=DNA Conformation and Transcription |pages=18–34|year=2005 |last1=Zhurkin |first1=Victor B | last2=Tolstorukov | first2=Michael Y | last3=Xu | first3=Fei | last4=Colasanti | first4=Andrew V | last5=Olson | first5=Wilma K | isbn=978-0-387-25579-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] nature of this based-paired structure provides a redundant copy of the [[genetic information]] encoded within each strand of DNA. The regular structure and data redundancy provided by the DNA double helix make DNA well suited to the storage of genetic information, while base-pairing between DNA and incoming nucleotides provides the mechanism through which [[DNA polymerase]] replicates DNA and [[RNA polymerase]] transcribes DNA into RNA. Many DNA-binding proteins can recognize specific base pairing patterns that identify particular regulatory regions of genes.

Intramolecular base pairs can occur within single-stranded nucleic acids. This is particularly important in RNA molecules (e.g., [[transfer RNA]]), where Watson-Crick base pairs (guanine-cytosine and adenine-[[uracil]]) permit the formation of short double-stranded helices, and a wide variety of non-Watson-Crick interactions (e.g., G-U or A-A) allow RNAs to fold into a vast range of specific three-dimensional [[RNA structure|structures]]. In addition, base-pairing between [[transfer RNA]] (tRNA) and [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA) forms the basis for the [[molecular recognition]] events that result in the nucleotide sequence of mRNA becoming [[Genetic code|translated]] into the amino acid sequence of [[protein]]s via the [[genetic code]].

The size of an individual [[gene]] or an organism's entire [[genome]] is often measured in base pairs because DNA is usually double-stranded. Hence, the number of total base pairs is equal to the number of nucleotides in one of the strands (with the exception of non-coding single-stranded regions of [[telomere]]s). The [[haploid]] [[human genome]] (23 [[chromosome]]s) is estimated to be about 3.2 billion bases long and to contain 20,000–25,000 distinct protein-coding genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moran |first=Laurence A. |url=http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2011/03/how-big-is-human-genome.html |title=The total size of the human genome is very likely to be ~3,200 Mb |publisher=Sandwalk.blogspot.com |date=2011-03-24 |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicgenomics.com/Genome/index.htm |title=The finished length of the human genome is 2.86 Gb |publisher=Strategicgenomics.com |date=2006-06-12 |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IHSGC2004"&gt;{{cite journal | author = International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium | title = Finishing the euchromatic sequence of the human genome | journal = Nature | volume = 431 | issue = 7011 | pages = 931–45 | date = 2004 | pmid = 15496913 | doi = 10.1038/nature03001 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v431/n7011/full/nature03001.html| bibcode = 2004Natur.431..931H }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[kilobase]] (kb) is a unit of measurement in [[molecular biology]] equal to 1000 base pairs of DNA or RNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Organization of the ribosomal RNA genes of dictyostelium discoideum: Mapping of the nontrascribed spacer regions | last1 = Cockburn | first1 = Andrew F. | last2 = Jane Newkirk | first2 = Mary | last3 = Firtel | first3 = Richard A. | date = 1976 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6WSN-4C8GBDB-4Y/2/0c09db014fb73f4a8e0f3b5af596da01 | journal = Cell | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 605–613 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(76)90043-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total amount of related [[DNA]] base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt; and weighs 50 billion [[tonne]]s.&lt;ref name="NYT-20150718-rn"&gt;{{cite news |last=Nuwer |first=Rachel |date=18 July 2015 |title=Counting All the DNA on Earth |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/21/science/counting-all-the-dna-on-earth.html |work=The New York Times |location=New York |publisher=The New York Times Company |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=2015-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--- PLOS paper cited by NYT used 'tonne' unit. ---&gt; In comparison, the total [[Biomass (ecology)|mass]] of the [[biosphere]] has been estimated to be as much as 4 [[tonnes#Derived units|TtC]] (trillion tons of [[carbon]]).&lt;ref name="AGCI-2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agci.org/classroom/biosphere/index.php |title=The Biosphere: Diversity of Life |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Aspen Global Change Institute |location=Basalt, CO |accessdate=2015-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--- Aspen Global Change Institute (US-based) defined TtC as 'trillion tons of C'. ---&gt;

&lt;div style="border: none; width:282px;"&gt;&lt;div class="thumbcaption"&gt;Top, a '''G.C''' base pair with three [[hydrogen bond]]s. Bottom, an '''A.T''' base pair with two hydrogen bonds. Non-covalent hydrogen bonds between the bases are shown as dashed lines. The wiggly lines stand for the connection to the pentose sugar and point in the direction of the minor groove. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

[[Hydrogen bond]]ing is the chemical interaction that underlies the base-pairing rules described above. Appropriate geometrical correspondence of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors allows only the "right" pairs to form stably. DNA with high [[GC-content]] is more stable than DNA with low GC-content. But, contrary to popular belief, the hydrogen bonds do not stabilize the DNA significantly; stabilization is mainly due to stacking interactions.&lt;ref name="Yakovchuk2006"&gt;Peter Yakovchuk, Ekaterina Protozanova and Maxim D. Frank-Kamenetskii. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkj454 Base-stacking and base-pairing contributions into thermal stability of the DNA double helix]. Nucleic Acids Research 2006 34(2):564–574.&lt;/ref&gt;

The larger [[nucleobase]]s, adenine and guanine, are members of a class of double-ringed chemical structures called [[purine]]s; the smaller nucleobases, cytosine and thymine (and uracil), are members of a class of single-ringed chemical structures called [[pyrimidine]]s. Purines are complementary only with pyrimidines: pyrimidine-pyrimidine pairings are energetically unfavorable because the molecules are too far apart for hydrogen bonding to be established; purine-purine pairings are energetically unfavorable because the molecules are too close, leading to overlap repulsion. Purine-pyrimidine base pairing of AT or GC or UA (in RNA) results in proper duplex structure. The only other purine-pyrimidine pairings would be AC and GT and UG (in RNA); these pairings are mismatches because the patterns of hydrogen donors and acceptors do not correspond. The GU pairing, with two hydrogen bonds, does occur fairly often in [[RNA]] (see [[wobble base pair]]).

Paired DNA and RNA molecules are comparatively stable at room temperature, but the two nucleotide strands will separate above a [[Dna melting|melting point]] that is determined by the length of the molecules, the extent of mispairing (if any), and the GC content. Higher GC content results in higher melting temperatures; it is, therefore, unsurprising that the genomes of [[extremophile]] organisms such as ''[[Thermus thermophilus]]'' are particularly GC-rich. On the converse, regions of a genome that need to separate frequently — for example, the promoter regions for often-[[transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] genes — are comparatively GC-poor (for example, see [[TATA box]]). GC content and melting temperature must also be taken into account when designing  [[primer (molecular biology)|primers]] for [[PCR]] reactions.

===Examples===
The following DNA sequences illustrate pair double-stranded patterns. By convention, the top strand is written from the [[5' end]] to the [[3' end]]; thus, the bottom strand is written 3' to 5'.

==Base analogs and intercalators==

{{Main|Nucleic acid analogues}}
Chemical analogs of nucleotides can take the place of proper nucleotides and establish non-canonical base-pairing, leading to errors (mostly [[point mutation]]s) in [[DNA replication]] and [[Transcription (genetics)|DNA transcription]]. This is due to their [[isosteric]] chemistry. One common mutagenic base analog is [[5-bromouracil]], which resembles thymine but can base-pair to guanine in its [[enol]] form.

Other chemicals, known as [[DNA intercalation|DNA intercalators]], fit into the gap between adjacent bases on a single strand and induce [[frameshift mutation]]s by "masquerading" as a base, causing the DNA replication machinery to skip or insert additional nucleotides at the intercalated site. Most intercalators are large [[polyaromatic]] compounds and are known or suspected [[carcinogen]]s. Examples include [[ethidium bromide]] and [[acridine]].

==Unnatural base pair (UBP)==
{{See also|Artificial gene synthesis|Expanded genetic code|Nucleic acid analogue|Synthetic genomics}}
An unnatural base pair (UBP) is a designed subunit (or [[nucleobase]]) of [[DNA]] which is created in a laboratory and does not occur in nature.  DNA sequences have been described which use newly created nucleobases to form a third base pair, in addition to the two base pairs found in nature, A-T ([[adenine]] – [[thymine]]) and G-C ([[guanine]] – [[cytosine]]).  A few research groups have been searching for a third base pair for DNA, including teams led by [[Steven A. Benner]], [[Philippe Marliere]], [[Floyd Romesberg]] and [[Ichiro Hirao]].&lt;ref name="Fikes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/may/08/tp-life-engineered-with-expanded-genetic-code/|title=Life engineered with expanded genetic code|last=Fikes|first=Bradley J.|date=May 8, 2014|work=San Diego Union Tribune|accessdate=8 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509001048/http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/may/08/tp-life-engineered-with-expanded-genetic-code/|archivedate=9 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some new base pairs have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yang|first=Zunyi|date=August 15, 2011|title=Amplification, Mutation, and Sequencing of a Six-Letter Synthetic Genetic System|journal=J.

In 1989 Steven Benner (then working at the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] in Zurich) and his team led with modified forms of cytosine and guanine into DNA molecules ''in vitro''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Enzymatic incorporation of a new base pair into DNA and RNA | last1 = Switzer | first1 = Christopher | last2 = Moroney | first2 = Simon E. | last3 = Benner | first3 = Steven A. | date = 1989 | journal = J.

Since then, Benner's team has been trying to engineer cells that can make foreign bases from scratch, obviating the need for a feedstock.&lt;ref name="Ewan"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/07/living-organism-artificial-dna_n_5283095.html |title=Scientists Create First Living Organism With 'Artificial' DNA| last=Callaway| first=Ewan |date=May 7, 2014| work=Nature News| publisher=Huffington Post| accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Ichiro Hirao's group in Japan developed an unnatural base pair between 2-amino-8-(2-thienyl)purine (s) and pyridine-2-one (y) that functions in transcription and translation, for the site-specific incorporation of non-standard amino acids into proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hirao | first1 = I. | display-authors = etal   | date = 2002 | title = An unnatural base pair for incorporating amino acid analogs into proteins | journal = Nat.

In 2012, a group of American scientists led by Floyd Romesberg, a chemical biologist at the [[Scripps Research Institute]] in San Diego, California, published that his team designed an unnatural base pair (UBP).&lt;ref name="Malyshev PNAS 20120724"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Efficient and sequence-independent replication of DNA containing a third base pair establishes a functional six-letter genetic alphabet |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=24 July 2012 |last=Malyshev |first=Denis A. |last2=Dhami |first2=Kirandeep |last3=Quach |first3=Henry T. |last4=Lavergne |first4=Thomas |last5=Ordoukhanian |first5=Phillip |volume=109 |issue=30 |pages=12005–12010 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1205176109 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/109/30/12005 |accessdate=2014-05-11 |bibcode=2012PNAS..10912005M |pmid=22773812 |pmc=3409741}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The two new artificial nucleotides or ''Unnatural Base Pair'' (UBP) were named [[d5SICS]] and [[dNaM]]. More technically, these artificial [[nucleotide]]s bearing hydrophobic [[nucleobase]]s, feature two fused [[Aromatic hydrocarbon|aromatic rings]] that form a (d5SICS–dNaM) complex or base pair in DNA.&lt;ref name="Ewan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NATJ-20140507" /&gt; His team designed a variety of ''in vitro'' or "test tube" templates containing the unnatural base pair and they confirmed that it was efficiently replicated with high fidelity in virtually all sequence contexts using the modern standard ''in vitro'' techniques, namely [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR amplification of DNA]] and PCR-based applications.&lt;ref name="Malyshev PNAS 20120724"/&gt; Their results show that for PCR and PCR-based applications, the d5SICS–dNaM unnatural base pair is functionally equivalent to a natural base pair, and when combined with the other two natural base pairs used by all organisms, A–T and G–C, they provide a fully functional and expanded six-letter "genetic alphabet".&lt;ref name="NATJ-20140507"/&gt;

In 2014 the same team from the Scripps Research Institute reported that they synthesized a stretch of circular DNA known as a [[plasmid]] containing natural T-A and C-G base pairs along with the best-performing UBP Romesberg's laboratory had designed and inserted it into cells of the common bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' that successfully replicated the unnatural base pairs through multiple generations.&lt;ref name="Fikes"/&gt; The [[transfection]] did not hamper the growth of the ''E. coli'' cells and showed no sign of losing its unnatural base pairs to its natural [[DNA repair]] mechanisms.

This was in part achieved by the addition of a supportive [[Algae|algal gene]] that expresses a [[Nucleoside triphosphate|nucleotide triphosphate]] transporter which efficiently imports the triphosphates of both d5SICSTP and dNaMTP into ''E. coli'' bacteria.&lt;ref name="NATJ-20140507"/&gt; Then, the natural bacterial replication pathways use them to accurately replicate a [[plasmid]] containing d5SICS–dNaM. Other researchers were surprised that the bacteria replicated these human-made DNA subunits.&lt;ref name = "fox" /&gt;

The successful incorporation of a third base pair is a significant breakthrough toward the goal of greatly expanding the number of [[amino acid]]s which can be encoded by DNA, from the existing 20 amino acids to a theoretically possible 172, thereby expanding the potential for living organisms to produce novel [[protein]]s.&lt;ref name="Fikes"/&gt; The artificial strings of DNA do not encode for anything yet, but scientists speculate they could be designed to manufacture new proteins which could have industrial or pharmaceutical uses.&lt;ref name="Pollack"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/08/business/researchers-report-breakthrough-in-creating-artificial-genetic-code.html?hpw&amp;rref=business&amp;_r=0| title=Scientists Add Letters to DNA’s Alphabet, Raising Hope and Fear |last=Pollack| first=Andrew| date=May 7, 2014| work=New York Times| accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts said the synthetic DNA incorporating the unnatural base pair raises the possibility of life forms based on a different DNA code.&lt;ref name = "fox"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/05/08/scientists-create-organism-using-artificial-dna/| title=Scientists create first living organism containing artificial DNA| date=May 8, 2014| work=The Wall Street Journal |publisher=Fox News| accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pollack" /&gt;

==Length measurements==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[KB]] --&gt;
The following abbreviations are commonly used to describe the length of a D/R[[DNA|NA molecule]]:
* bp  = base pair(s)—one bp corresponds to approximately 3.4 [[Angstrom|Å]] (340 [[picometre|pm]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alberts|first1=Bruce|last2=Johnson|first2=Alexander|last3=Lewis|first3=Julian|last4=Morgan|first4=David|last5=Raff|first5=Martin|last6=Roberts|first6=Keith|last7=Walter|first7=Peter|title=Molecular Biology of the Cell|date=December 2014|publisher=Garland Science, Taylor &amp; Francis Group|location=New York/Abingdon|isbn=978-0-8153-4432-2|page=177|edition=6th|ref=alberts_mboc}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of length along the strand, and to roughly 618 or 643 [[Atomic mass units|daltons]] for DNA and RNA respectively.
* kb (= kbp) = kilo base pairs = 1,000 bp
* Mb (= Mbp) = mega base pairs = 1,000,000 bp
* Gb = giga base pairs = 1,000,000,000 bp.

For single-stranded DNA/RNA, units of [[nucleotide]]s are used—abbreviated nt (or knt, Mnt, Gnt)—as they are not paired.
To distinguish between units of [[computer storage]] and bases, kbp, Mbp, Gbp, etc. may be used for base pairs.

The [[centimorgan]] is also often used to imply distance along a chromosome, but the number of base pairs it corresponds to varies widely. In the Human genome, the centimorgan is about 1 million base pairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/Glossary.aspx?acronym=False#C |title=NIH ORDR – Glossary – C |publisher=Rarediseases.info.nih.gov |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Matthew P Scott|author2=Paul Matsudaira|author3=Harvey Lodish|author4=James Darnell|author5=Lawrence Zipursky|author6=Chris A Kaiser|author7=Arnold Berk|author8=Monty Krieger |title=Molecular Cell Biology |edition=Fifth |publisher=W.

The '''biology of trust''' is the study of [[Physiology|physiological]] mechanisms involved in mediating [[Trust (emotion)|trust]] in social attachments. It has been studied in terms of [[genetics]], [[endocrinology]] and [[neurobiology]].&lt;ref name="riedl"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Riedl|first1=Rene|last2=Javor|first2=Andrija|title=The Biology of Trust: Integrating Evidence From Genetics, Endocrinology, and Functional Brain Imaging|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rene_Riedl2/publication/232431419_The_Biology_of_Trust_Integrating_Evidence_From_Genetics_Endocrinology_and_Functional_Brain_Imaging/links/5644575208ae451880a7147d.pdf|journal=[[Journal of Neuroscience, Psychology, and Economics]]|date=2011|volume=5|issue=2|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trust is the intentional choice to believe the input of strangers because one believes they know the truth and have one's best interest at heart.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK321980/|title=What Is Trust|last=Sciences|first=Roundtable on Public Interfaces of the Life|last2=Sciences|first2=Board on Life|last3=Studies|first3=Division on Earth and Life|last4=Education|first4=Board on Science|last5=Education|first5=Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and|last6=The National Academies of Sciences|first6=Engineering|date=2015-09-23|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trust is important in creating social attachments. 

Social bonds is a characteristic present in many mammals and other vertebrae species.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feldman|first=Ruth|title=The Neurobiology of Human Attachments|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2016.11.007|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=21|issue=2|pages=80–99|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2016.11.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there exists a paradox in the formation of social bonds in humans- while there are benefits, drawbacks, such as judgment, vulnerabilities to harmful physical and emotional hurt do exist.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/897575784|title=Annual review of psychology. Volume 66, 2015|others=Fiske, Susan T.,, Schacter, Daniel L.,, Taylor, Shelley E.,|isbn=9780824302665|location=Palo Alto, California|oclc=897575784}}&lt;/ref&gt; And overarching all of this is [[Trust (emotion)|trust]], which is marked by the intentional choice to rely on another individual for an underlying purpose, despite drawbacks- a factor in social bonds with [[Biology|biological]] implications.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Neural  Mechanisms ==
[[Neuropeptide]]s, specifically [[oxytocin]] (OT) and [[Vasopressin|arginine-vasopressin]] (AVP), have been shown to be involved in physiological mechanisms of social behavior.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lieberwirth|first=Claudia|last2=Wang|first2=Zuoxin|date=2014|title=Social bonding: regulation by neuropeptides|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnins.2014.00171/abstract|journal=Frontiers in Neuroscience|language=English|volume=8|doi=10.3389/fnins.2014.00171|issn=1662-453X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex hormones, have also been correlated.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The involvement of OT and AVP in trust and social attachment can be attributed the fact that both molecules can be released as neurotransmitters or hormones throughout the body.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; OT and AVP act as neurotransmitters when released directly by the [[hypothalamus]]; they act as neurohormones when released peripherally by the [[pituitary gland]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; So, both AVP and OT are peripheral (functioning throughout the body) and central (functioning within the brain).&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Churchland|first=Patricia S.|last2=Winkielman|first2=Piotr|title=Modulating social behavior with oxytocin: How does it work? What does it mean?|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2011.12.003|journal=Hormones and Behavior|volume=61|issue=3|pages=392–399|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2011.12.003|pmc=3312973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both social bonding and social attachment involve OT.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; In female rats that had OT injected directly into the brain, studies found that the OT rats exhibited full maternal behavior towards foster pups.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; In studies involving human subjects, increases in OT were observed in subjects who received intentional trust signals in a controlled trust game.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; When an OT receptor antagonist was injected in rats, it was found that there was a decrease in social recognition and decreased social bonding.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In a similar study, injection of central or peripheral OT in the lateral septum or main [[olfactory bulb]]s showed an increase in social recognition and interaction.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Studies have also shown the integration of OT with [[Dopamine]] (DA) and AVP in social bonding.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Function of DA neurons on OT receptors bound in the [[striatum]] strengthen social attachment by directing the reward pathways in which DA is involved with towards behavioral trust.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

Social recognition memory also involves AVP.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In a study conducted on Brattleboro rats that carried a mutation inhibiting AVP production, injection of central and peripheral AVP was correlated with an improvement in social recognition.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; As with OT, injection of AVP receptor antagonist was followed by impaired social bonding and recognition. In male titi monkeys, injection of AVP increased social behavior towards their female partner.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In human studies, AVP has also shown to increase pro-social behavior towards their significant other.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The effects of AVP are reinforced by its integration with OT.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; In a study in which rats received increased peripheral or central OT and AVP, the rats with increased OT or AVP exhibited an increase in huddling and sharing food with other rats.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Social bonding is mediated several brain areas which respond to OT, AVP, and DA.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Studies using [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] have been used in research to assess associated brain areas in human attachment based on auditory and visual stimuli responses of the brain to attachment target.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; These studies found that the [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA) and [[Striatum|ventral striatum]] in the brain were activated during responses to attachment target.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Further research in [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] studies have shown that the [[amygdala]], [[nucleus accumbens]] (NA), [[hypothalamus]],  sub-cortical and cortical reward neural networks are also involved mediating social attachment.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; These networks and pathways contain receptors that allow OT, AVP, and DA to exert their effects in high and low level processes in the brain that provide a foundation for social trust.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In studies with human subjects who experienced social isolation, there was an increase in activity in the [[Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis|hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal]] (HPA) axis-a neural network involved in the release of [[cortisol]], a stress-response hormone.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; This same research showed a deactivation in brain regions associated with OT and AVP.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

[[Image:Bioswale.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Two bioswales for a [[housing development]]. The foreground one is under construction while the background one is established.]]

'''Bioswales''' are [[Landscape architecture|landscape]] elements designed to concentrate or remove [[debris]] and [[pollution]] out of [[surface runoff]] water.  They consist of a [[wikt:swale|swaled]] drainage course with gently sloped sides (less than 6%) and filled with [[vegetation]], [[compost]] and/or [[riprap]].&lt;ref name="Loechl"&gt;{{cite book |title=Design Schematics for a Sustainable Parking Lot |last=Loechl |first=Paul M. |authorlink= |year=2003 |publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers, Research and Development Center |location=Champaign, IL |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://www.cecer.army.mil/techreports/Stumpf_SustainableParkingLot/Stumpf_SustainableParkingLot__TR.pdf |accessdate= |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602011451/http://www.cecer.army.mil/techreports/Stumpf_SustainableParkingLot/Stumpf_SustainableParkingLot__TR.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-02 |df= }} Construction Engineering Research Laboratory. Document no. ERDC/CERL TR-03-12.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}} The water's flow path, along with the wide and shallow ditch, is designed to maximize the time water spends in the [[Swale (geographical feature)|swale]], which aids the collection and removal of pollutants, silt and debris. Bioswales are also beneficial in groundwater recharge and are great stormwater mitigation tools. Depending upon the topography of the land, a bioswale may have a meandering or almost straight channel alignment. A bioswale's make-up can be influenced by many different variables that include: climate, rainfall patterns, size of the site, budget, and available vegetation that can be planted. 

It is important to maintain bioswales to ensure best possible efficiency and effectiveness in removal of pollutants in the stormwater runoff. Planning for these things is an important step, which can include the introduction of filters or large rocks to prevent clogging. Annual maintenance through soil testing, visual inspection, and mechanical testing are also crucial to the health of a bioswale. 

A common application is around [[parking lot]]s, where substantial [[automotive]] pollution is settled on the paving and then flushed by the first instance of rain, known as the [[first flush]]. The bioswales, or other type of [[biofilter]], can be created around the edges of parking lots to capture and treat the [[stormwater]] runoff before releasing it to the [[drainage basin|watershed]] or [[storm sewer]].

==Contaminants addressed==
Bioswales work to remove pollutants through vegetation and the soil. As the storm water runoff flows through the bioswale, the pollutants are captured and settled by the leaves and stems of the plants. The pollutants then enter the soil where they decompose or can be broken down by bacteria in healthy soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.crd.bc.ca/education/green-stormwater-infrastructure/bioswales|title=Bioswales|date=2013-11-10|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several classes of [[water pollutant]]s that may be collected or arrested with bioswales.  These fall into the categories of silt, inorganic contaminants, organic chemicals and [[pathogen]]s.
* Silt – How bioswales and plants are constructed slow the conveyance of silt and reduce the [[turbidity]] of receiving waters. Filters can be established to capture debris and silt during the process. 
* Organics – Many organic contaminants including [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] will volatilize or degrade over time and Bioswales slow the conveyance of these materials into waterways, and before they can affect aquatic life.  Although not all organic material will be captured, the concentration of organic material is greatly reduced by bioswales.
* Pathogens –  are deprived of a host or from a nutrient supply long enough for them to become the target of a [[heterotroph]].
* Common inorganic compounds are [[macronutrient]]s such as [[phosphate]]s and [[nitrate]]s.  Principal sources of these nutrients comes from agricultural runoff attributed to excess fertilization. Excess [[phosphate]]s and [[nitrate]]s can cause [[eutrophication]] in disposal zones and receiving waters. Specific bioswale plants absorb these excess nutrients.
* Metallic compounds such as [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[lead]], [[chromium]], [[cadmium]] and other heavy metals are concentrated in the structures.  Unfortunately, these metals slowly poison the surrounding soil.   Regular soil removal is required in order to prevent metals from dissolving and releasing back into the environment.   Some bioswales are designed to include [[hyperaccumulator]] plant species.  These plants absorb but do not transform the metals.  Cuttings from these plants often decompose back into the pond or are pruned by gardening services that do not know the compost they are collecting is poisonous.

== Best locations ==
Bioswales can be implemented in areas that require stormwater management to regulate the runoff velocity  and decontaminate the runoff. Bioswales are created to handle the [[first flush]] of pollutants during the event of rain, therefore, locations that have high areas of impervious surface such as roads, parking lots, or rooftops can benefit from additions of bioswales.  They can also be integrated into road medians, curb cutouts, sidewalks, or any public space.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nacto.org/publication/urban-street-design-guide/street-design-elements/stormwater-management/bioswales/|title=Bioswales – National Association of City Transportation Officials|work=National Association of City Transportation Officials|access-date=2018-03-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
Bioswales are useful [[Low-impact development (U.S. and Canada)|low-impact development]] work to decrease the velocity of stormwater runoff while removing pollutants from the discharge. They are extremely beneficial in protecting surface water and local waterways from excessive pollution from stormwater runoff. The longer the runoff stays within the bioswale, the better the pollutant removal outcome. It is also beneficial in removing standing ponds that could potentially attract mosquitos. Bioswales can also be designed to be aesthetically pleasing and attract animals and create habitats. Bioswales can also be beneficial for [[groundwater recharge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/bioswales_can_improve_water_quality_resources|title=Bioswales can improve water quality resources|work=MSU Extension|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maintenance ==
Improper maintenance can lead to high restoration costs to address inefficient bioswales. An accumulation of large sediments, trash, and improper growth of vegetation can all affect the quality and performance of bioswales. It is beneficial at the planning stages to set apart easements to allow for easier maintenance of biowales, whether it be adequate space to locate machinery or safety to those working. Different types of filters can be used to catch sediments. Grass filter strips or rock inlets can be used to filter sediments and particulates; however, without proper maintenance, runoff could flow away from the bioswales due to blockage. Structural inlets have become more common due to the ease of maintenance, use, and its effectiveness. Avoiding the use of floating mulch and selecting the best fit low-maintenance plants ensure better efficiency in the bioswales.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-11/documents/final_gi_maintenance_508.pdf|title=Operation and Maintenance of Green Infrastructure Receiving Runoff from Roads and Parking Lots|last=epa|first=|date=September 2016|website=epa.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on a community's needs for a bioswale, a four step assessment program can be developed. Visual inspection, capacity testing, synthetic runoff, and monitoring are the four steps that can be used to evaluate performance and maintenance of bioswales.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Routine inspection is required to ensure that the performance and aesthetics of bioswales are not compromised. Time and frequency of inspections vary based on different local governments, but should occur at least once a year. Various aspects of inspection can take place, either visually or mechanically. Visual observation of the vegetation, water, and inlets are all crucial to ensure performance. Some organizations utilize checklists to streamline the visual inspection process.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/830293149|title=Optimizing stormwater treatment practices a handbook of assessment and maintenance|last=J.|first=Erickson, Andrew|date=2013|publisher=Springer|others=Weiss, Peter T., Gulliver, John S.|isbn=9781461446248|location=New York|oclc=830293149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different methods to determine if a bioswale needs maintenance. Bioswales are benchmarked to meet a specific level of infiltration to determine if maintenance is required. A staff gauge is used to measure the infiltration rate. Soil chemistry testing is also required to determine if the soil has a certain off-level of any pollutant. [[Phosphorus]] and high levels of [[salinity]] in the soil are two common pollutants that should be attended to. Analysis of inflow and outflow pollutant concentration is also another way to determine the performance level of bioswales.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Maintenance can span to three different levels of care. Aesthetic maintenance is required to remove weeds that affect the performance of the other plants and the bioswale itself, clean and remove trash, and maintaining the looks of the vegetation. Partial restoration is needed when the inlet is blocked by sediments or when vegetation needs to be replaced. Full restoration is required when the bioswales no longer filter pollutants adequately and overall performance is severely lacking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Design ==
Bioswales experience short, potentially intense, periods of rain, flooding and pollutant loading followed by dry seasons. It is important to take into account how the vegetation selected for the bioswales will grow and understanding what types of plants are considered the best fit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

There are four types of bioswales that can be constructed based on the needs of the location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/water/resources_stormwater/bioswales.html|title=An Introduction to Bioswales|last=Caflisch|first=Mary|last2=Giacalone|first2=Katie|date=May 2015|website=Clemson University|publisher=|access-date=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Low grass bioswales utilizes low growing grass that can be landscape, similar to lawns. These types of bioswales tend to be less effective than vegetated bioswales in treating stormwater runoff and sustaining an adequate collection time. 
* Vegetated bioswales are created with taller growing plants, ornamental vegetations, shrubs, and even trees. These types can also be lined with rocks to slow down the velocity of stormwater runoff that is flowing through bioswales to increase collection time for decontamination. Vegetated bioswales can also include vegetation that is highly useful in removing certain chemicals in runoffs very efficiently.  
* Low water use bioswales are helpful in areas that tend to be drier with hotter climate. [[Xeriscape]] bioswales are populated with runoff generally only after rain and storms and stay dry otherwise. 
* Wet bioswales are similar to wetlands in which they retain water for a much longer period of time that allows for infiltration of stormwater instead of simply emptying the water at the end of the bioswale into storm drain inlets. 
Bioswales require a certain soil composition that does not contain more than 5% clay. The soil itself before implementation should not be contaminated. Bioswales should be constructed with a longitudinal slope to allow sediments to settle. Maximum slope of bioswales is 3:1. A minimum clearance is required to ensure that other infrastructure would not be damaged. The overfill drain should be located at least 6 inches above the ground plain to allow for maximum concentration time of stormwater runoff in the bioswales. Rocks can also be used to slow down the runoff velocity. The use of filters is important to prevent inlets from becoming blocked by sediments or trash.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Examples==
Two early examples of scientifically designed bioswales for large scale applications are found in the western US.  In 1996 for Willamette River Park in [[Portland, Oregon]]  a total of 2330 lineal feet of bioswale was designed and installed to capture and prevent pollutant runoff from entering the [[Willamette River]].  Intermittent [[check dam]]s were installed to further abet silt capture, which reduced by 50% suspended solids entering the river system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Water Sensitive Planning and Design |last=France |first=Robert L. |authorlink= |year=2002 |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, Florida |isbn=1-56670-562-2 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second example of a large scale designed bioswale is at the Carneros Business Park, [[Sonoma County, California]].  Starting in 1997 the project design team worked with the [[California Department of Fish and Game]] and County of Sonoma to produce a detailed design to channel surface runoff at the perimeter of a large parking area.  [[Surface runoff]] consists of building roof runoff, parking lot runoff and overland flow from properties to the north of the project site.  A total of two lineal miles of bioswale was designed into the project.  The purpose of the bioswale was to minimize runoff contaminants from entering [[Sonoma Creek]].  The bioswale channel is grass-lined, and nearly linear in form. Downslope gradient is approximately 4% and cross-slope gradient is approximately 6%.&lt;ref&gt;Lumina Technologies (1998). ''Hydrology and biology studies for Carneros Business Park'', prepared for the William A. Saks Company pursuant to requirements of the County of Sonoma. Approximately 2000 bioswales are projected to be installed in New York City to protect the city's combined sewer system.&lt;/ref&gt;

A relatively recent project established was the [[Seattle, Washington]] [[Street Edge Alternatives]] project, completed in 2001. Rather than using traditional piping, SEA's goal was to create a natural landscape that represented what the area was like before development. The street was 11% more pervious than a standard street and was characterized with evergreen trees and bioswales. The bioswales were planted on graded slopes with wetland and upland plants. Other landscaping also focused on native and salmon-friendly plants. SEA provided a strong benefit for stormwater runoff mitigation that helped continue to protect Seattle's creek ecology. The project street also created a more inviting and aesthetically pleasing site as opposed to hard landscaping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seattle.gov/util/EnvironmentConservation/Projects/GreenStormwaterInfrastructure/CompletedGSIProjects/StreetEdgeAlternatives/index.htm|title=Street Edge Alternatives — Seattle Public Utilities|website=www.seattle.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More precisely, choreomusicology grew out of Euro-American performance traditions that considered musical composition and dance choreography as separate specialties. Not all performance genres separate music and dance into separate theoretical categories. The directionality of the relationship between sound and movement is not always fixed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Choreomusicology&lt;/ref&gt; Choreomusicologists hold that studying the variable relationships between sound and movement in diverse performance arts can provide insight into perceptual sensibilities, cultural processes, and interpersonal dynamics. Famous artists whose works exhibit rich choreomusical relationships include: [[John Cage]] and [[Merce Cunningham]], [[Igor Stravinsky]] and [[George Balanchine]], and [[Louis Horst]] and [[Martha Graham]]. Interesting choreomusical relationships also exist in West Sumatran [[Tari Piring]], West Javanese [[Pencak Silat]], and Afro-Brazilian [[Capoeira]] to name but a few examples.&lt;ref&gt;http://jonathanstill.com/2012/03/02/new-choreomusicology-article/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mason | first1 = P.H. | year = 2012 | title = Music, dance and the total art work: choreomusicology in theory and practice | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14647893.2011.651116#preview | journal = Research in Dance Education | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 5–24 | doi=10.1080/14647893.2011.651116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/17411912.2014.926632 | volume=23 | title=Tapping the Plate or Hitting the Bottle: Sound and Movement in Self-accompanied and Musician-accompanied Dance | journal=Ethnomusicology Forum | pages=208–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''conservation-restoration of Thomas Eakins' ''The Gross Clinic''''' refers to the on-going [[conservation-restoration]] treatments of American painter [[Thomas Eakins]]' 1875 painting ''[[The Gross Clinic]]'' throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. These treatments are a testament to the changing methodologies undertaken in the field of [[Conservation and restoration of paintings|paintings conservation]].

The painting portrays surgeon Dr. [[Samuel D. Gross]] performing a surgical debridement on a boy with [[osteomyelitis]] of the [[femur]] for an audience of students in his clinic at [[Jefferson Medical College]].

The painting was subject to several conservation-restoration treatments both prior to Eakins' death and in the decades following, which altered both the structural integrity of the painting as well as its surface composition. Emergency treatment was undertaken in 1960 and 1961 by Theodor Siegel, [[Paintings conservator|conservator]] at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], to correct damage from previous restorations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siegl|first=Theodor|date=Winter 1962|title=The Conservation of the "Gross Clinic"|url=|journal=Philadelphia Museum of Art Bulletin|volume= 57|pages=39–62|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent treatment was performed in 2010 by conservators at the Philadelphia Museum of Art to correct problems resulting from the 1961 restoration as well as the previous restorations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=An Eakins masterpiece restored : seeing The Gross Clinic anew|last=Foster|first=Kathleen A.|date=|publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art in association with Yale University Press|others=Tucker, Mark S.|year=2012|isbn=9780300179798|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=|oclc=830662602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
''[[The Gross Clinic]]'' portrays surgeon [[Samuel D. Gross|Dr. Samuel D. Gross]], the first chief of surgery at [[Jefferson Medical College]], performing surgery on a young man for [[osteomyelitis]] of the [[femur]] in the surgical amphitheater on the top floor of Jefferson's Ely Building in the company of multiple doctors and medical students. Chief of Clinic Dr. James M. Barton can be seen standing over the patient, probing the [[Surgical incision|incision]]. Junior assistant Dr. Charles S. Briggs, seen below Gross, is holding the patient's legs while Dr. Daniel M. Appel, seen bottom right, uses a retractor to hold open the incision. The anesthetist, Dr. W. Joseph Hearn, sits at the head of the operating table, holding a chloroform soaked rag over the patient's face. The clinic's clerk, Dr. Franklin West, records the surgery at a desk behind Gross. Gross' son Dr. Samuel W. Gross and orderly Hughey O'Donnell can be seen standing in the hall leading out of the amphitheater. A woman, possibly the patient's mother, can be seen recoiling at the bottom right. A self-portrait of [[Thomas Eakins|Eakins]] himself can be seen on the right side of the painting, in the front of the theater, taking notes.

== History ==
Work on the painting likely began sometime in April 1875, as evidenced by a letter from Eakins to his friend [[Earl Shinn]] in which he declares, "What elates me more is that I have just got a new picture blocked in and it is very far better than anything I have ever done."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Work on the painting continued throughout summer of 1875, with Eakins holding multiple sessions with Dr. Gross at his home at 1729 Mount Vernon St. to produce studies for the final work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The work was likely finished by Christmas of 1875, evidenced by the gift of a portrait sketch of author and friend Robert C.V. Meyers, who modeled for the painting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Eakins submitted the painting for display at Memorial Hall during the 1876 [[Centennial Exhibition]] in [[Philadelphia]], but was rejected by Selecting Committee, who claimed there was inadequate space to display the painting. However, it was suggested by a correspondent of New York's ''Medical Record'' and by William Clark in the ''Philadelphia Evening Telegraph'' that the painting's graphic nature caused several members of the jury to feel faint.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doyle|first=Jennifer|date=1999-10-01|title=Sex, Scandal, and Thomas Eakins's The Gross Clinic|url=http://rep.ucpress.edu/content/68/1|journal=Representations|language=en|volume=68|pages=1–33|doi=10.2307/2902953|issn=0734-6018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was instead displayed at the model ward of the U.S. Army Post Hospital, a replica created for the Centennial.

In February 1878 the painting was purchased by Alumni Association of Jefferson Medical College for $200.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Acquisition by The Philadelphia Museum of Art and Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts ===
On November 11, 2006 it was announced that the board of [[Thomas Jefferson University]] (formerly Jefferson Medical College) voted to sell the painting to the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C. and to [[Walmart|Wal-Mart]] heiress [[Alice Walton|Alice Walton's]] planned [[Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art]] in Bentonville, Arkansas for a record $68 million.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Due to the painting's connections to [[Philadelphia]], portraying Philadelphians painted in a Philadelphia college by a Philadelphia painter, the announcement of the impending sale caused an uproar.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/11/arts/design/11pain.html|title=Eakins Masterwork Is to Be Sold to Museums|last=Vogel|first=Carol|date=2006-11-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anne d'Harnoncourt|Anne d’Harnoncourt]], director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, remarked that “It’s a painting that really belongs in Philadelphia — his presence still resonates here.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Protests against the sale held in November and December 2006 were organized by Philadelphia artists Stanley Bielen, Charles Cushing, and Patrick Connors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Philadelphia mayor [[John F. Street]] threatened to declare the painting a historic landmark, possibly tying up the sale in court.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The university gave local museums and government agencies the chance to match the $68 million sale price and keep the painting in Philadelphia by December 26, 2006.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/21/AR2006122101793.html|title=Philadelphia Blocks Sale of Eakins Painting by Matching $68 Million Bid|last=Trescott|first=Jacqueline|date=2006-12-22|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a joint effort by the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] and the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]], the funds were raised in 45 days through thousands of donations with the remaining amount loaned by [[Wachovia|Wachovia Bank]]. The remainder of the funding was completed in 2008 by the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art|Philadelphia Museum of Art's]] sale of ''Cowboy Singing'' and two oil sketches of ''Cowboys in the Badlands'' and the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] sale of ''The Cello Player,'' all works by Eakins.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/24/arts/design/24gros.html|title=Philadelphia Raises Enough Money to Retain ‘The Gross Clinic,’ an Eakins Masterpiece|last=Vogel|first=Carol|date=2008-04-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation-restoration treatments ==

=== 1915 ===
The first recorded conservation-restoration treatment to ''[[The Gross Clinic]]'' took place sometime in 1915 by restorer T. H. Stevenson at the behest of [[Jefferson Medical College]]. The canvas on which ''[[The Gross Clinic]]'' was painted had become weak and brittle and was lined with a new piece of linen. A 1916 issue of ''The Jeffersonian'' noted that Stevenson cleaned and treated the painting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== 1917-1925 ===
At some point between 1917 and 1925 a treatment of the painting took place that dramatically altered the composition of the painting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is not known who worked on the painting or when. A comparison of a photograph of the painting taken in October 1917 for the ''Loan Exhibition of the Works of Thomas Eakins'' at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and a reproduction of the painting that appeared as the frontispiece of Jefferson Medical College's 1925 yearbook show major differences in the relative tones of the painting, indicating a major restoration in which paint was removed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The hall leading out of the amphitheater was considerably lighter; Dr. Samuel W. Gross and orderly Hughey O'Donnell originally appeared lighter than the background.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The majority of the painting now had a considerably redder tone.

Thomas Eakins' widow, [[Susan Macdowell Eakins]], upon seeing the 1925 reproduction and thinking the changes had been made for the reproduction rather than to the painting itself, strongly objected to its release. A letter from Eakins to Jefferson Medical College Dean Ross V. Patterson details her frustrations:&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/conservation/14.html|title=Philadelphia Museum of Art - Research:Conservation: Thomas Eakins's The Gross Clinic|last=Philadelphia Museum of Art|first=|date=2010|website=www.philamuseum.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Block quote|text=“The photograph [the color reproduction] presents an operation being done by Dr. Gross under a fancy red light which fills the Clinic Room. The oil painting presents an operation being done by Dr. Gross in daylight. I have been in the Clinic Room as it was in Dr. Gross’s time, also am quite certain at this present time, when artificial lights are the fashion, fancy lights would not be permitted on the serious performances of a Clinic.”|sign=Susan Eakins|source=}}[[File:The gross clinic thomas eakins.jpeg|thumb|''The Gross Clinic'' prior to the 2010 treatment.|left]]

=== 1940 ===
The next recorded treatment of the painting took place in 1940 was by Philadelphia restorer Hannah Mee Horner, at the behest of Jefferson Medical College. Hearing of the college's plans for restoring the painting, Eakins' student [[Charles Bregler]],who frequently treated multiple Eakins paintings at [[Susan Macdowell Eakins|Susan Eakins]] request, attempted to intervene but was rebuffed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Horner removed the linen lining attached by Stevenson in 1915 and replaced it with two, 4 by 6 1/2 foot pieces of [[plywood]] which were butted in the center and nailed to a wooden framework. The painting was then attached using carpenter's glue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Records also indicate that Horner also cleaned and restored the painting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== 1960-1961 ===
The results of the 1940 treatment proved to be disastrous and put the painting in serious need of new treatment. In the spring of 1960 conservator Theodor Siegl of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the first with professional training and credentials to treat the painting, cleaned and restored the painting at Jefferson's request. Varnish, applied by Horner, had become yellowed and darkened while a significant accumulations of grime also built up on the surface. Siegl used a combination of solvents to remove the grime and varnish, removed build up of filling putty used by previous restorers, and retouched areas that had been torn or distorted.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Siegl finally applied a layer of varnish and made minor retouchings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1961 Jefferson again requested Siegl examine the painting prior to its inclusion in an Eakins retrospective that would travel from the [[National Gallery of Art]] to the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] and finally end in [[Philadelphia Museum of Art|Philadelphia]]. Siegl realized that the structure of the painting was in extreme danger from Horner's 1940 treatment. The plywood attached to the back of the painting had begun to warp, creating a crease in the middle of the painting which could have torn it in half. The nails in the plywood also began to move forward, creating bumps in the painting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Siegl's conservation-restoration of the painting moved forward in the summer of 1961. Due to the paintings large size, no table in the conservation department could accommodate the painting, thus a custom working platform with a built in thermostat was created.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To protect the painting in the course of removing the plywood the surface of the painting was covered with tissue paper and strips of [[muslin]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The framework was the first part of the 1940 treatment to be removed, revealing over 500 nails which had been causing a large portion of the damage to the painting's surface. A [[Plane (tool)|planer]], attached to an electric power saw, was used to remove most of the plywood, with the remainder being removed by hand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The carpenter's glue used in the 1940 was then removed. A new linen lining was attached to the canvas, which was then attached to a new stretcher framework. A new, easily removable varnish was used on the painting's surface.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== 2010 ===
[[File:Gross clinic bw.jpg|thumb|1875-1876 India ink and watercolor reproduction by Thomas Eakins.]]
Following the purchase of ''The Gross Clinic'' by the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 2007 and after considerable research and discussion, the decision was made to conserve and restore the painting once more. The ultimate goal of the treatment was to both correct damage done by earlier treatments and restore the tones of the paint to reflect Eakins original intentions, which was made possible my extensive research on Eakins technique not available to earlier conservators.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This treatment was performed by [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]] Mark Tucker, Allen Kosanovich, and Terry Lignelli.

The first step concerned the removal of the varnish applied by Siegl in 1961, a [[synthetic resin]] called poly(n-butyl methacrylate), which was prone to discoloration and loss of [[solubility]], making it more difficult to remove as time went on. Taking place over the course of several weeks, the removal of this varnish allowed conservators to view what was left of Eakins original paint and what had been retouched by earlier treatments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A new, [[Synthetic resin|synthetic resin varnish]], MS2A, was applied to the surface which both evenly saturated the colors of the painting while isolating the original paint from the retouching, should it need to be removed in the future.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A 1875-1876 [[india ink]] and [[Watercolor painting|watercolor]] reproduction created by Eakins, the 1917 photograph, and 1925 reproduction were used as a guide for conservators to retouch the painting. The conservators used paints made of lightfast pigments ground in a colorless synthetic resin to retouch the painting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Smaller areas where paint had been flaked away were the first priority, followed by areas where large swaths of colors and tones had been altered. The area of the amphitheater's opening, in which a dark glaze had been removed, was restored to more closely resemble the small amounts of dark paint that remained as well as the 1917 photograph. Details of the many characters in the painting had been obscured due to earlier aggressive cleanings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The faces of orderly Hughey O'Donnell, Dr. Gross' son Dr. Samuel W. Gross, and Eakins were all restored to their original detail seen in the 1917 photograph.

Following the completion of the treatment an exhibition, ''An Eakins Masterpiece Restored: Seeing The Gross Clinic Anew'', was held between July 23, 2010 and January 9, 2011 at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128721065|title=Eakins' Classic 'Gross Clinic' Gets Another Look|last=Rose|first=Joel|date=July 25, 2010|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-03-30|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/19/arts/design/19eakins.html|title=A Restored ‘Gross Clinic’ at Philadelphia Museum|last=Kennedy|first=Randy|date=2010-07-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discoveries ==
The use of [[Radiography of cultural objects|x-radiography]] and [[infrared reflectography]] prior to the 2010 treatment revealed a wealth of information about Eakins' technique and the creation of ''The Gross Clinic''.

=== Eakins' Technique ===
An x-radiograph of the painting revealed a heavy build-up of paint behind the heads of the principal characters. Rather than building upon dark areas with light paint, as was the convention at the time of the paintings creation, the x-radiograph revealed that Eakins instead built on light areas with dark paint.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The characters featured in the periphery of the painting were not significantly built up in this fashion and were instead painted thinly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Thomas Eakins|last=Sewell|first=Darrel|date=|publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art|others=Foster, Kathleen A.|year=2001|isbn=9780300091113|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=353–365|oclc=47785680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Composition of ''The Gross Clinic'' ===
[[File:Composition study for the portrait of professor gross thomas eakins.jpeg|left|thumb|Sketch for ''The Gross Clinic'']]
Significant changes in the composition of the painting before the final image were revealed using [[Radiography of cultural objects|x-radiography]]. The probe in the hands of Dr. James Barton was initially longer but shortened in the final composition. The clinic's clerk, Dr. Franklin West, was initially seen taking his notes at a lower position but was moved up for the final composition. Dr. Daniel M. Appel, seen bottom right, is shown in the sketch looking more to the right but in the final composition looking more to the left, showing more of his profile. In the final composition his arm was also moved slightly down, showing the patient's buttocks. X-radiography also revealed an initial stripe across the bottom of the painting, likely intended to serve as the wall circling the seats of the amphitheater, which was replaced with a view under the surgeon's table in the final composition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== An Eakins Masterpiece Restored: Seeing ''The Gross Clinic'' Anew ==
Following the completion of the 2010 conservation treatment, the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] opened the exhibition "An Eakins Masterpiece Restored: Seeing ''The Gross Clinic'' Anew", which ran from July 3, 2010 to January 9, 2011. The theme of the exhibition was "Then and Now", an homage to the famed and nearly two hour long lecture by [[Samuel D. Gross|Dr. Samuel D. Gross]], ''Then and Now: Advances in Medical Science in the Past Forty Years: a Discourse Introductory to the Forty-third Course of Lectures in the Jefferson Medical College of Philadelphia''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Autobiography of Samuel D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24708">Objects used in Jewish rituals are known collectively as [[Judaica]]. The '''conservation and restoration of Judaica''' takes into account the collective body of Jewish religious laws derived from the written and oral [[Torah]] known as, [[halacha]] in order to properly care for these materials. This work involves identifying these objects and therefore knowing how any of these objects are traditionally handled, stored, exhibited, and generally cared for based on their use and significance. 

==Definition of culturally sensitive objects==
Traditional [[Judaism]] divides ritual objects into two main categories, those that carry holiness; and those that are essential to the performance of a particular ritual or commandment but that have no intrinsic quality that is defined as sacred or holy. Once they are no longer in ritual use and are in the possession of a museum, only some of the objects in the first category are traditionally treated differently from the way other collections are treated. For these pieces, repair or restoration done by a conservator is not common. It is common for almost all other objects, conservation, repair, or restoration to be carried out without restriction.&lt;ref name="Defining"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greene|first1=Virginia|title=Accessories of Holiness: Defining Jewish Sacred Objects|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic31-01-005.html||website=cool.conservation-us.org|accessdate=9 April 2017|date=January 1, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The way the objects below are handled and preventatively conserved is all based on the laws and thoughts of the most strict sect of Judaism as is recommended.

Below is a list of both types of objects with definitions and descriptions to aid in identifying and therefore knowing how any of these objects might be handled and cared for due to their uses and significance. Additionally, these descriptions will aid in understanding the care and handling methods listed below them. 

References are made to [[Ashkenazi]], [[Sephardi]], and [[Mizrachi Jews]] in this article. Ashkenazi Jews trace their ancestry to communities in central and eastern Europe while Sephardi Jews are those who came originally from the Iberian Peninsula. These Jews were expelled in 1492 during the Spanish Inquisition and settled in places like Greece, Turkey, and what is known as Israel today. Mizrachi Jews are those who trace their ancestry to the Arab world and Iran, as well as those whose families never left Palestine.&lt;ref name=Virtual /&gt;

===Types of sacred and non-sacred objects===
Tashmishey Kedushah is the first category of ritual objects and is defined as "objects which carry holiness" or "accessories of holiness." The most common example of this is the [[Torah]] which is the Five Books of Moses.&lt;ref name=Defining/&gt;  [[File:Open Torah scroll.jpg|thumb|Open Torah scroll]]

The common feature of the objects in this group is that they contain words, specifically the name of God, but by extension, any words "divinely written" or inspired, from which the quality of holiness is derived. Because the nontextual objects surrounding these scrolls all come into contact with them, they also acquire some of the same quality of holiness. The transmission is not indefinite. It extends a maximum of two layers from the text.

Other objects in this category include:
* Torah curtains - Curtains that are in front of the Torah ark and are often decorative in nature but can also be plain. 
* Mantle - A piece of fabric often used to cover a Torah scroll and often made of velvet or another soft material with some type of embroidery. This is used most often by Ashkenazi communities.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt;
* Torah binder - A strip of soft fabric, similar to the mantle, that keeps the Torah scroll closed.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt; In Italy and in the Sephardi communities, the binder is known as a "fascia"; it is made of a costly material or of linen embroidered in silk thread.&lt;ref name="Virtual"&gt;{{cite web|title=Torah Ornaments|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/torah-ornaments|website=Jewish Virtual Library: A Project of AICE|accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rimonim - Silver and gold ornaments that are placed on the wooden rollers or in Hebrew, "atzei chaim" (trees of life). Many times these are adorned with little bells and are very intricate.&lt;ref name="Learning"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shekel|first1=Michal|title=The Making of a Torah Scroll|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/torah-scroll/|website=My Jewish Learning|accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Breastplate - A metal shield placed in front of the mantle of the Torah scroll in Ashkenazi communities. This custom did not develop in Sephardi communities because their Torah scrolls were kept in a case (tik)  which did not lend itself to such additional decoration. Symbolic of, and sometimes similar to, the breastplate prescribed for the high priest, the object is often called "ḥoshen mishpat," the Hebrew word for breastplate.&lt;ref name=Virtual /&gt;
* [[Yad]] - The pointer used by the Torah reader to keep one's place is known as a "yad," in Hebrew, or "hand" in English, in Ashkenazi communities and as the "moreh" or "pointer/teacher" or "Kulmus" or "quill" in Sephardi and Eastern communities. The pointer was originally a narrow rod, tapered at the pointing end, usually with a hole at the other end through which a ring or chain could be passed to hang the pointer on the Torah scroll. Now it looks like a hand with one finger pointing out. This is used so that no hands touch the actual scroll and transfer oils or dirt. Pointers are made for the most part of silver or silver-plated brass, but in a few European communities, they used to be made of wood. In such cases, the pointers were carved in the local folk-art style.&lt;ref name=Virtual /&gt;
* Wood Torah case - Used by Sephardic Jews instead of a fabric mantle allowing the Torah to sit upright when not in use and without the use of a chair or holder as mentioned above. [[File:ShinMezuzahJosephSherman.jpg|thumb|ShinMezuzahJosephSherman]] &lt;ref name="Sephardim"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shurpin|first1=Yehuda|title=Why Do Sephardim Keep Their Torahs in Cylindrical Cases|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3119530/jewish/Why-Do-Sephardim-Keep-Their-Torahs-in-Cylindrical-Cases.htm|website=Chabad.org|accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Chair or holder on which the Torah is placed when it is removed from the ark and not being read. 
* [[Tefillin]]  - Known in English as “phylacteries,” are worn by men in the Orthodox and Conservative movement during morning prayer and on weekdays. This includes a leather case, the biblical texts written on parchment that is inside, the leather straps used to fasten them to the head and arm during prayer (see image of soldier below), and any bag specifically made to hold them and used for that purpose on a regular basis. 
*[[Mezuzah]] - A metal, ceramic, or glass casing in which the handwritten text on parchment or "[[klaf]]" in Hebrew, is held. This object is fastened to the doorpost of a house and, traditionally, to interior doorways as well and marks the home of a Jewish family. 

Bibles, prayer books, volumes of the [[Talmud]], law codes, and commentaries, in a variety of languages, are now also included in this list. In some communities, any document of any kind written in Hebrew letters is also included. This can sometimes also include anything written in [[Yiddish]] which uses the same alphabet.

====Tashmishey Mitzvah====
Tashminey Mitzvah is a category that includes most other ritual objects essential to Jewish life.  Objects include:
*Wine or [[kiddush]] cups used on Sabbath and holidays 
*[[Hanukkah]] [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]] 
*[[Seder plate]] 
*[[Shofar]] 
*[[Tallit]] with knotted fringes, called [[tzitzit]].
*[[Lulav]] or a palm branch in English, tied together with willow and myrtle and [[etrog]] (citron) to be used on the Jewish harvest holiday of [[Sukkot]], 
*[[Etrog]] containers - That keep the etrog safe from the "pitam" or "pitom" breaking off making the fruit less valuable and possibly not kosher. 
*Sabbath candlesticks - Used weekly during [[Shabbat]]
*Spice box and candle holder used for the [[Havdalah]] service that marks the end of the Jewish Sabbath, called [[Shabbat]]. 
*[[Challah]] and [[matzah]] covers - Used to cover bread for Shabbat and the holiday of Passover which tells the story of the exodus from Egypt. 
*[[Chuppah]] - or wedding canopy in English

==Preventative conservation ==
Once holy/sacred objects (tashmishey kedusha) leave the Jewish community and enter the care of a museum, it is common practice that this group of objects is divided into two sections. The first section contains the three written texts including the Torah scroll, tefillin, and klaf for the mezuza. (These all are, or contain, biblical texts that were handwritten on parchment, in a particular script, according to rigid rules, by men who are specially trained as scribes (sofrim)). The second section includes all other material, including printed or handwritten documents, Torah mantles, ark curtains, tefillin bags, Torah ornaments, and mezuza cases (see other section below).

In terms of preventative conservation and conservation itself, Torah scrolls, tefillin, and mezuza scrolls traditionally are left as they are. According to [[halacha]], once they are no longer in use, there is no reason for them to be kosher—in proper condition to be used—and therefore no reason why missing or abraded letters are restored or minor repairs made to the parchment unless the museum wishes to do as they see it necessary for the safety of the object. 

The repair of other books and documents has often been done with the respect that would characterize any professional conservation treatment. In Judaism, the study of traditional texts is considered to be the equivalent of prayer. To restore any text, whether of aesthetic or historical value or not, to a state in which it can be studied is considered an act of merit whatever the religious or cultural affiliation of the person doing the work. This includes when it will just be on view in an exhibition.

===Torah, Klaf===
If, for the safety of a Torah scroll, it is determined that repairs must be done to the rollers on which the scroll is mounted, traditionally, these repairs are done by a scribe, who will then remounts the parchment onto the roller in the traditional manner. It has been proven that a Torah scroll that has a tear in the parchment does best when it is kept rolled to another part of the scroll. According to tradition, if two pages are separated the two parts of the scroll are most often wrapped and stored separately. If it is considered both possible (considering the condition of the parchment) and essential to rejoin the separated leaves.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt;

When Torah scrolls, prayer books, or volumes of the [[Talmud]] are in the possession of a Jewish institution, it is a common practice to only photograph (or making photocopies) of open scrolls or pages only for serious study or publication. Once the books and other documents are in an archive, or museum, the rules of the institution apply. These rules are usually based on condition and value, but restrictions on casual copying do exist in all cases.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt;

===Tefillin - phylacteries===
[[File:IDF soldier put on tefillin.jpg|thumb|IDF soldier put on tefillin]] 
It is against halacha to open tefillin unless it is necessary. According to Jewish tradition, the removal and examination of the klaf within the tefillin only occurs when the tefillin are being repaired. The style of the writing can give clues to the registrar or conservator to the time and place in which they were written. Many institutions exhibit tefillin in damaged condition if there is a special reason such as its association with a famous person, or in an exhibit of Holocaust-related material.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt;

===Other materials===
Objects in this group are commonly treated by any qualified conservator who will treat Jewish ritual material as anthropological material rather than as art, keeping conservation treatment to a minimum, and avoiding extensive restoration. Any ethical treatment is seen as permitted. It is noted that Conservators in private practice, who may not have the option of minimal treatment, may take on greater responsibility as a result of the above. Original fabric or trimming removed from an ark curtain have traditionally given to the owner for proper disposal. If the owner is unwilling to do this is it common for the responsibility to fall on the conservator to make other arrangements.  

===Holocaust related objects===
Alterations of any kind to an object that survived the Holocaust, unless absolutely necessary to ensure its physical survival, are not made out of respect for the victims. Conservators and collections staff traditionally attempt to do the least amount of conservation on an object from the Holocaust as the damaged state is part of what is seen as telling of the history of the object. Any intervention can be seen as causing a loss of historic and perhaps even esthetic information, and the greater the intervention the greater the damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rozdeba|first1=Suzzane|title=Uncertain Future|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/76089/uncertain-future|website=Tablet Magazine Online|accessdate=3 April 2017|date=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Holocaust museums and other museums carrying objects from concentration camps including fragile items like prisoners’ artwork and thousands of documents, shoes, and suitcases, teeth, hair, glasses, luggage, and more, preservation is viewed as an ethical and practical issue. Conservators and registrars alike wrestle with questions about the proper role of restoration. It has been noted that people coming to see these objects don't want to see a replica of how something might have once looked, but they are looking for what it looks like because of what it, and what its owner, went through.&lt;ref name="Holocaust"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sevy|first1=Dr. Rivka|title=Ethics in Conservation of Original Materials|url=https://ehri-project.eu/ethics-conservation-original-materials|website=ehri-project.eu|publisher=European Holocaust Research Infrastructure|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concentration camps themselves are also considered artifacts to be to preserved as close to how they originally looked while still conserving them. This includes the barracks and other buildings that are exposed to natural conditions like atmosphere, rain, cold, etc. When Auschwitz was liberated by the Soviet army in January 1945, it covered 40 square kilometers, with three camps, sub camps, and an additional area that was supervised by SS administration. While some were hesitant to leave the camp as it was because of difficult memories, it was upon the request of former prisoners that the local government keep the former concentration camp intact as a memorial and the Polish government began initiatives to preserve the site, giving the Ministry of Culture and Art the authority to preserve parts of it.&lt;ref name=Holocaust /&gt;

Alternatively, the conservation of audio or visual records (photographs, films, voice records) is different. The audio or visual recordings of past historical events that are caught as images or sound are not the original as there is no physical original. Because they are the only remaining representation of the events of the holocaust, such as the Nazi Book burnings in the Opernplatz in Berlin,  this media is commonly conserved as much as possible.&lt;ref name=Holocaust /&gt;

==Overarching ethical concerns==
Because of certain rules, restrictions, and traditions within the Jewish religion, certain ethical concerns are commonly top-of-mind when caring for sacred Judaica. 

===Kohen restriction===
Many restrictions were designed to maintain what is referred to as ritual purity for Jews who are of the "Priest" holy order in the Temple of Jerusalem. Today, most Jews will know if they come from that [[Kohen]] line, and one might be able to tell from the last name of Cohen, Kohn, Kahn, etc. Many of the laws and practices are still maintained in traditional Judaism. One law that might affect the conservation of objects is that Kohanim are forbidden to be in contact with dead bodies, or be under the same roof as a corpse or any part of one, except in the case of the death of a close relative. This could prevent a conservator or registrar (doing preventative conservation) from caring for objects that are of the human remain nature, but only if it bothers the professional because of his or her background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rozovsky|first1=Lorne|title=Raise Your Hand if You're A Kohen|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/762109/jewish/Raise-Your-Hand-If-Youre-A-Kohen.htm|website=Chabad.org|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Menstruation and women touching objects===
It is the practice in some ultra-orthodox sects of Judaism that women who are menstruating do not touch any sacred texts for purity reasons. This is only a custom and is not written into Jewish law. Because of this, female conservators are able to work with the texts but remain cognizant of this custom. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berkovitz|first1=Rahel|title=Can Women Touch the Torah? A Halackic View|url=https://www.jofa.org/Education/TorahTouching|website=Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Placement of sacred texts and objects on the floor===
Materials containing: (a) God's name, (b) Three consecutive words of a biblical verse, when written on one line with the intent to quote the verse, or (c) Other written or printed Torah ideas or laws are considered to be holy and, according to Jewish law, are not placed on the floor for any reason. Schoolwork, homework and test papers may be included in this category if they contain any of the above. All these materials are considered holy objects whether they are in Hebrew or another language, in Braille, or on microfilm.&lt;ref name="Chabad"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Posner|first1=Menachem|title=Proper Disposal of Holy Objects|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/475304/jewish/Proper-Disposal-of-Holy-Objects.htm%20Chabad.org|website=Chabad.org|accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stacking of sacred texts===
Additionally, any materials with God's name are not, according to halacha, stacked one on top of the other in any type of museum storage. Many consider this to be disrespectful to the holy objects.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

==Exhibition and storage==
While there are few restrictions on the exhibition of Jewish ritual objects and generally none on the examination of this material for purposes of study by anyone of any religion or culture, it is important to mention the exceptions below.

It has been proven that Torah scrolls, tefillin, and mezuza scrolls do best if exhibited in an unrolled fashion unless they are deemed no longer fit for ritual use. These objects are generally stored covered with plain cloth or tissue paper in a dark drawer or cabinet and are separated from their holders if a conservator or registrar feels it is unwise to leave them in the same place. A reason for this is if the mantle is deemed unfit to stay on the Torah scroll. It is common practice for a Tefillin that needs to be separated from its bag to be kept in a plain cloth bag for storage. Small Torah scrolls are commonly stored lying down while large ones are kept upright on a rack specifically made to hold their weight.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt;

Mezuzah scrolls are traditionally kept in their cases or wrapped in tissue.

===Handling and long-term care===
Generally, when taken out for any reason, such as to be examined by a researcher, tashmishey kedusha is treated with respect as any object that is still being used in rituals. The surface on which the objects are placed is covered with a clean cloth or appropriate non-acidic paper, and the objects are covered when not being examined. Any scrolls being examined are re-rolled up when not in use.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt;

It has been proven that if the parchment is in good enough condition, it's best for the preservation of Torah scrolls and other rolled documents to be completely rolled front to back (or vice versa) and back to the center, once every year or two. This is most commonly done by two people who are experienced in this procedure and under the supervision of a conservator.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt;

==Conservation and restoration==
In many Jewish institutions, if it is decided that an object has reached the point of needing conservation, a [[registrar (museum)|museum registrar]] will connect a conservator with an expert in the type of object or in the Judaica field. This pairing of Rabbi with a [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]], a religious expert with conservator, or a professor with conservator, is known to creates a more trustworthy situation where the Museum does not have to worry that all Jewish rules are followed. If the conservator has any questions on process, or on what to do and not do, he or she can refer to the assigned expert. 

Instead of contacting a conservator if there are issues with a Torah, specifically involving the writing on the parchment, a registrar or curator will traditionally connect with a [[Sofer Stam]], or a scribe in English. This expert is trained in transcribing the Torah, tefillin, and mezuzahs, and other religious writings. According to Jewish law, or halacha, they are the only people allowed to touch these texts.  Scribes also assemble the Torah scrolls, sewing the sheets of parchment together and mounting them on the rollers, and make the cases for tefillin.&lt;ref name="Strassfeld"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Siegel|first1=R.|last2=Strassfeld|first2=M.|last3=Strassfeld|first3=S.|title=The Jewish Catalogue|date=1973|publisher=Jewish Publication Society|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==De-accessioning==
When it comes to the deaccessioning process of museum objects that a conservator or other museum professional deems beyond repair, these said objects can be disposed of through destruction. They will be destroyed by the curator or his/her designee. When it comes to disposal of Judaica, there are different rules depending on whether the object is deemed still holy or longer holy and whether they are fit for ritual use, or not fit for ritual use. 

===Holy/sacred objects (Tashmishey Kedushah)===
If collections professionals have artifacts that are holy Jewish objects containing the name of God (tashmishey kedusha) that have been determined to be beyond conservation and the museum no longer wants them in the collection and would otherwise dispose of them, this is, according to halacha, not allowed. Jewish law instructs how these types of objects are to be "put away"  (O.H. 154.3; Mishneh Torah, II 10.3). 

Traditionally, Ashkenazi Jews fulfill this requirement of "putting away" a holy object through burial, either in a specific part of a Jewish cemetery or, in some places, next to or along with a man of exceptional piety and learning.

Many Sephardic/Mizrachi Jewish communities put these objects instead into a special room in the synagogue, called a [[geniza]] (from the root meaning “conceal,” “hide,” or “preserve”). Because this group of objects includes books that are both handwritten and printed, documents, and traditional items, the storage rooms can get quite full.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt; The most famous geniza is in the Ezra Synagogue in Cairo. It held more than 200,000 pages, some dating to the founding of the synagogue in 882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Judaica|date=1971|publisher=Keter Publishing House.|location=Jerusalem, Israel|accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non Holy/sacred objects (Tashmishey Mitzvah)===
For the most part, objects that fall under tashmishey mitzvah are discarded when they are no longer fit for ritual use. This is because they have no intrinsic quality of holiness. even though they have value when it comes to Western aesthetics of beauty. One exception to this law is the [[tallit]]. The Shulchan Arukh, a medieval law code (first published 1565) and still considered authoritative by traditional Jews, states that [[tzitzit]], the strings that hang from a tallit are just as holy as the tallit itself and is treated as such.

'''Convolute''' as a verb literally means to "roll together" or "roll around", from the Latin ''convolvere''. In general application the word can mean to "tangle" or "complicate", but in botanical descriptions convolute usually is an adjective from the Latin ''convolutus'', meaning "rolled around".&lt;ref name= "BotGloss"&gt;Jackson, Benjamin, Daydon; A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent; Published by Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. London, 4th ed 1928&lt;/ref&gt; It commonly refers to a special class of [[imbricate]] structures &amp;mdash; those where the overlapping edges of leaves, scales or similar elements are spirally wrapped, each scale having one edge within the previous scale and one outside the next scale. In the family [[Restionaceae]] the leaf sheaths commonly are convolute in this sense.&lt;ref name= "DyerGen"&gt;Dyer, R. Allen, The Genera of Southern African Flowering Plants”. {{ISBN|0 621 02854 1}}, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; However in structures such as a [[spathe]], where there is only one element, a convolute (or "convolutive") element is spirally wrapped around itself or its branch.&lt;ref name= "BotGloss"/&gt; This is common in the buds of leaves and inflorescences of members of the family [[Araceae]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8671">In [[recursion theory|computability theory]], '''productive sets''' and '''creative sets''' are types of sets of [[natural number]]s that have important applications in [[mathematical logic]].  They are a standard topic in mathematical logic textbooks such as {{harvtxt|Soare|1987}} and {{harvtxt|Rogers|1987}}.

==Definition and example==

For the remainder of this article, assume that &lt;math&gt;\varphi_i&lt;/math&gt; is an acceptable numbering of the [[computable function]]s and ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; the corresponding numbering of the [[recursively enumerable]] sets.

A set ''A'' of natural numbers is called '''productive''' if there exists a [[total function|total]] recursive (computable) function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; so that for all &lt;math&gt;i \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;W_i \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f(i) \in A \setminus W_i.&lt;/math&gt; The function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''productive function''' for &lt;math&gt;A.&lt;/math&gt;

A set ''A'' of natural numbers is called '''creative''' if ''A'' is recursively enumerable and its complement &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}\setminus A&lt;/math&gt; is productive. Not every productive set has a recursively enumerable complement, however, as illustrated below.

The archetypal creative set is &lt;math&gt;K = \{ i \mid i \in W_i \}&lt;/math&gt;, the set representing the [[halting problem]]. Its complement &lt;math&gt;\bar{K} = \{ i \mid i \not \in W_i \}&lt;/math&gt; is productive with productive function ''f''(''i'') = ''i'' (the identity function).

To see this, we apply the definition of productivity function and show separately that &lt;math&gt;i \in \bar{K}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i \not \in W_i&lt;/math&gt;:
* &lt;math&gt;i \in \bar{K}&lt;/math&gt;: suppose &lt;math&gt;i \in K&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;i \in W_i&lt;/math&gt;, now given that &lt;math&gt;W_i \subseteq \bar{K}&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;i \in \bar{K}&lt;/math&gt;, this leads to a contradiction. So &lt;math&gt;i \in \bar{K}&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;i \not \in W_i&lt;/math&gt;: in fact if &lt;math&gt;i \in W_i&lt;/math&gt;, then it would be true that &lt;math&gt;i \in K&lt;/math&gt;, but we have demonstrated the contrary in the previous point. So &lt;math&gt;i \not \in W_i&lt;/math&gt;.

== Properties ==

No productive set ''A'' can be recursively enumerable, because whenever ''A'' contains every number in an r.e. set ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; it contains other numbers, and moreover there is an effective procedure to produce an example of such a number from the index ''i''.  Similarly, no creative set can be [[decidable set|decidable]], because this would imply that its complement, a productive set, is recursively enumerable.

Any productive set has a productive function that is [[injective function|injective]] and [[total function|total]].

The following theorems, due to Myhill (1955), show that in a sense all creative sets are like &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and all productive sets are like &lt;math&gt;\bar{K}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Soare|1987}}; {{harvtxt|Rogers|1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theorem.''' Let ''P'' be a set of natural numbers. The following are equivalent:
*''P'' is productive.
*&lt;math&gt;\bar{K}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Many-one reduction|1-reducible]] to ''P''.
*&lt;math&gt;\bar{K}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Many-one reduction|m-reducible]] to ''P''.

'''Theorem.'''  Let ''C'' be a set of natural numbers. The following are equivalent:
*''C'' is creative.
*''C'' is [[Many-one reduction|1-complete]]
*''C'' is [[Computable isomorphism|recursively isomorphic]] to ''K'', that is, there is a total computable [[bijective function|bijection]] ''f'' on the natural numbers such that ''f''(''C'') = ''K''.

== Applications in mathematical logic ==

The set of all provable sentences in an effective [[axiomatic system]] is always a [[recursively enumerable set]]. If the system is suitably complex, like [[first-order arithmetic]], then the set ''T'' of [[Gödel number]]s of '''true''' sentences in the system will be a productive set, which means that whenever ''W'' is a recursively enumerable set of true sentences, there is at least one true sentence that is not in ''W''.  This can be used to give a rigorous proof of [[Gödel's first incompleteness theorem]], because no recursively enumerable set is productive.   The complement of the set ''T'' will not be recursively enumerable, and thus ''T'' is an example of a productive set whose complement is not creative.

== History ==
The seminal paper of {{harvtxt|Post|1944}} defined the concept he called a Creative set. Reiterating, the set &lt;math&gt; K &lt;/math&gt; referenced above and defined  as the domain of the function &lt;math&gt;d(x)=[[x]](x)+1&lt;/math&gt; that takes the diagonal of all enumerated 1-place  computable partial functions and adds 1 to them is an example of a creative set.&lt;ref name ="test"&gt;{{harvtxt|Enderton|2010}}, pp. 79, 80, 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Post gave a version of Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem using his creative sets, where originally Gödel had in some sense constructed a sentence that could be freely translated as saying "I am unprovable in this axiomatic theory." However, Gödel's proof did not work from the concept of true sentences, and rather used the concept of a consistent theory, which led to the [[Second incompleteness theorem]]. After Post completed his version of incompleteness he then added the following:

"The conclusion  is unescapable that even for such a fixed, well defined body of mathematical propositions, mathematical thinking is, and must remain, essentially creative."&lt;ref name = "test" /&gt;

The usual creative set &lt;math&gt;K &lt;/math&gt; defined using the diagonal function &lt;math&gt;d(x)&lt;/math&gt; has its own historical development. Alan Turing in a 1936  article on the [[Turing machine]] showed the existence of a universal computer that computes the &lt;math&gt; \Phi &lt;/math&gt; function. The function &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is defined such that
&lt;math&gt; \Phi(w,x) =&lt;/math&gt; (''the result of applying the instructions coded by'' &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; ''to the input'' &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; ), and is universal in the sense that any calculable partial function &lt;math&gt;f &lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt; f(x)= \Phi(e,x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; x&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; e &lt;/math&gt; codes the instructions for &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. Using the above notation  &lt;math&gt; \Phi(e,x)= [[e]](x) &lt;/math&gt;, and the diagonal function arises quite naturally as &lt;math&gt; d(x) = [[x]](x)+1&lt;/math&gt;. Ultimately, these ideas are connected to [[Church's thesis]] that says the mathematical notion of computable partial functions is the ''correct'' formalization of an effectively calculable partial function, which can neither be proved or disproved. Church used [[Lambda calculus]], Turing an idealized computer, and later Emil Post  in his approach, all of which are equivalent.

In [[signal processing]], a '''digital biquad filter''' is a second-order [[recursive filter|recursive]] [[linear filter]], containing two [[Pole–zero plot|poles]] and two [[Pole–zero plot|zeros]].  "Biquad" is an abbreviation of "''biquadratic''", which refers to the fact that in the [[Z-transform|Z domain]], its [[transfer function]] is the ratio of two [[quadratic function]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;\ H(z)=\frac{b_0+b_1z^{-1}+b_2z^{-2}} {a_0+a_1z^{-1}+a_2z^{-2} }&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficients are often normalized such that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1:

:&lt;math&gt;\ H(z)=\frac{b_0+b_1z^{-1}+b_2z^{-2}} {1+a_1z^{-1}+a_2z^{-2} }&lt;/math&gt;

High-order [[IIR filter]]s can be highly sensitive to [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]] of their coefficients, and can easily become [[BIBO stability|unstable]].  This is much less of a problem with first and second-order filters; therefore, higher-order filters are typically implemented as serially-cascaded biquad sections (and a first-order filter if necessary). The two poles of the biquad filter must be inside the unit circle for it to be stable. In general, this is true for all discrete filters i.e. all poles must be inside the unit circle in the Z-domain for the filter to be stable.

==Implementation==

===Direct form 1===
The most straightforward implementation is the direct form 1, which has the following [[difference equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\ y[n] = \frac{1}{a_0} \left ( b_0x[n] + b_1x[n-1] + b_2x[n-2] - a_1y[n-1] - a_2y[n-2] \right )&lt;/math&gt;

or, if normalized:

:&lt;math&gt;\ y[n] = b_0x[n] + b_1x[n-1] + b_2x[n-2] - a_1y[n-1] - a_2y[n-2] &lt;/math&gt;

Here the &lt;math&gt;b_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_2&lt;/math&gt; coefficients determine zeros, and &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt; determine the position of the poles.

Flow graph of biquad filter in direct form 1:

[[File:Biquad filter DF-I.svg|400px|]]

===Direct form 2===
The direct form 1 implementation requires four delay registers. An equivalent circuit is the direct form 2 implementation, which requires only two delay registers:

[[File:Biquad filter DF-II.svg|400px|]]

The direct form 2 implementation is called the canonical form, because it uses the minimal amount of delays, adders and multipliers, yielding in the same transfer function as the direct form 1 implementation. The [[difference equation]]s for direct form 2 are:

:&lt;math&gt;\ y[n]=b_0 w[n]+b_1 w[n-1]+b_2 w[n-2],&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\ w[n]=x[n]-a_1 w[n-1]-a_2 w[n-2].&lt;/math&gt;

===Transposed direct forms===
{{expand section|date=October 2015}}
Each of the two direct forms may be transposed by reversing the flow graph without altering the transfer function. Branch points are changed to summers and summers are changed to branch points.&lt;ref&gt;https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/fp/Transposed_Direct_Forms.html&lt;/ref&gt; These provide modified implementations that accomplish the same transfer function which can be mathematically significant in a real-world implementation where precision may be lost in state storage.

The [[difference equation]]s for Transposed Direct Form 2 are:

:&lt;math&gt;\ y[n]=b_0 x[n]+s_1[n-1],&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\ s_1[n]=s_2[n-1]+b_1 x[n]-a_1 y[n]&lt;/math&gt; 
and 
:&lt;math&gt;\ s_2[n]=b_2 x[n]-a_2 y[n].&lt;/math&gt;

===Transposed Direct form 1===
The direct form 1
[[File:Digital Biquad Direct Form 1 Untransformed.svg|Digital Biquad Direct Form 1 Untransformed]]
is transposed into
[[File:Digital Biquad Direct Form 1 Transformed.svg|Flow diagram of Biquad filter Direct Form 1 Transformed for use in article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_biquad_filter]]

===Transposed Direct form 2===
The direct form 2
[[File:Digital Biquad Direct Form 2 Untransformed.svg|Flow diagram of Biquad filter Direct Form 2 for use in article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_biquad_filter]]
is transposed into
[[File:Digital Biquad Direct Form 2 Transformed.svg|Flow diagram of Biquad filter Direct Form 2 for use in article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_biquad_filter]]

===Quantizing Noise===
When a sample of n bits is multiplied by a coefficient of m bits, the product has n+m bits. These products are typically accumulated in a DSP register, the addition of five products may need 3 overflow bits; this register is often large enough to hold n+m+3 bits. The z&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is implemented by storing a value for one sample time; this storage register is usually n bits, the accumulator register is rounded to fit n bits, and this introduced quantizing noise.

In the direct form 1 arrangement, there is a single quantizing/rounding function
[[File:Digital Biquad Direct Form 1 Untransformed with Quantizing.svg|Flow diagram of Biquad filter Direct Form 1 for use in article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_biquad_filter]].

In the direct form 2 arrangement, there is a quantizing/rounding function for an intermediate value. In a cascade, the value may not need rounding between stages, but the final output may need rounding
[[File:Digital Biquad Direct Form 2 Untransformed with Quantizing.svg|Flow diagram of Biquad filter Direct Form 2 with Quantizing for use in article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_biquad_filter]].

Fixed point DSP usually prefers the non transposed forms and has an accumulator with a large number of bits, and is rounded when stored in main memory. Floating point DSP usually prefers the transposed form, each multiplication and potentially each addition are rounded; the additions are higher precision result, when both operands have similar magnitude.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8808">'''Dihydroxy-''E'',''Z'',''E''-PUFA''' are metabolites of [[polyunsaturated fatty acids]] (PUFA) that possess two [[hydroxyl]] residues and three in series [[conjugated double bond]]s having the ''E'',''Z'',''E'' [[cis-trans]] configuration. These recently classified metabolites are distinguished from the many other dihydroxy-PUFA with three conjugated double bonds that do not have this critical ''E'',''Z'',''E'' configuration: they inhibit the function of [[platelets]] and therefore may be involved in controlling and prove useful for inhibiting human diseases which involve the pathological activation of these blood-borne elements.

NPD1 is structurally identical to PDX except that its three conjugated double bonds have the ''E'',''E'',''Z'' configuration as opposed to the ''E'',''Z'',''E'' configuration of PDX.

The '''Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia''' or '''[http://www.eria.org ERIA]''' is an international organization established in Jakarta, Indonesia in 2008 by a formal agreement among Leaders of 16 countries in the East Asian region to conduct research activities and make policy recommendations for further economic integration in the East Asia. '''ERIA''' works very closely with both the ASEAN Secretariat and 16 Research Institutes to undertake and disseminate policy research under the three pillars, namely “Deepening Economic Integration”, ”Narrowing Development Gaps”, and “Sustainable Development” and provide analytical policy recommendations to Leaders and Ministers at their regional meetings. ERIA provides intellectural contributions to East Asian Community building and serves as a Sherpa international organization. ERIA ranks 32nd among the world's "Top 85 International Economics Think Tanks" according to the 2016 Global Go To Think Tanks Index Report conducted by University of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eria.org/2016%20Global%20Go%20To%20Think%20Tank%20Index%20Report.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Establishment ==
ERIA was established by a formal agreement among Leaders of 16 countries in the East Asian at the 3rd East Asia Summit&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asean.org/21127.htm Chairman's Statement of the 3rd East Asia Summit Singapore, 21 November 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316152924/http://www.asean.org/21127.htm |date=16 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Singapore on 21 November 2007. The inaugural ERIA Governor Board meeting was held at the ASEAN Secretariat in Jakarta, Indonesia, on 3 June 2008. A formal agreement was reached between Government of the Republic of Indonesia and the ASEAN Secretariat to recognize ERIA as an international organization on 30 December 2008. As for the preparation for the establishment of ERIA, IDE-JETRO has been appointed to undertake a role as the temporary secretariat of ERIA at ERIA Expert Meeting in manila, March 2007 towards its official establishment.

== Major Works ==
ERIA's works are divided into 3 fields, doing research works, disseminating its works, and providing policy recommendations.

=== Research Works ===
:ERIA's Research Works aims to pursue three pillars of research issues, "Deepening Economic Integration", "Narrowing Development Gaps", and "Sustainable Development".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eria.org/research/activities.html|title=Research Activities {{!}} ERIA|last=|first=|date=|website=Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific research items in FY2010 are listed below.([http://www.eria.org/publications/latest_publications/index.html Latest Publications])

==== Deepening Economic Integration ====
::ERIA will conduct policy studies to promote deepening economic integration through the [[liberalization]] and [[wikt:facilitation|facilitation]] of [[trade]] and investments as well as the improvement of business environment in collaboration with business community in the region, paying special attention to the improvement of cross border business transactions and behind-the-border issues including investment environment and various non-[[tariff]] measures.  The following are the research projects reflecting the regional needs of ASEAN and East Asia;
::*Extend and elaborate more the analysis on linkages between real and financial economies, providing rigorous analysis pursuing [[financial market]] integration through market and institutional reform strategies.
::*Provide assessment on the current fiscal position, the impact of the stimulus package provided to cope with the last financial crisis, and potential fiscal risk as consequences of stimulus issuance both in medium and long term.
::*Continue to support ASEAN Economic [[Minister (government)|Ministers]] Meeting by further developing AEC/ERIA scorecards in cooperation with the ASEAN High Level Task Force and ASEAN Secretariat through rigorous analysis based on objective data collection and the application of quantitative methodologies.
::*Conduct the analysis of safety and environment [[standardization]] and conformity assessment in East Asian countries and propose a desirable system, focusing on accessible design and green technology.

==== Narrowing Development Gaps ====
::ERIA will continue to pursue deepening [[economic integration]] and narrowing development gaps at the same time, by applying a comprehensive approach to cover regional connectivity, maximize regional [[Economic growth|growth]], and expand regional domestic [[demand]]. The following research projects are planned;

=== Providing Policy Recommendations ===
:One of the most important ERIA's works is providing policy recommendations to leaders, ministers in ASEAN and EAS through [[East Asia Summit]] and ASEAN Summit, and another related meetings. As ERIA's mission expands by receiving instructions and task-outs from Summits and Ministerial Meetings, ERIA's role as the "Center of Excellence" in ASEAN and [[East Asia]] becomes increasingly important.
*:At the 5th East Asia Summit and the 17th [[ASEAN Summit]] held on October 2010 in [[Vietnam]]
:Heads of government of [[ASEAN]] Member States commended ERIA's contribution in "Comprehensive [[Asia]] [[International development|Development]] Plan (CADP)" and "Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity".
*:At the 16th ASEAN Transport Ministers Meeting held on November 2010 in [[Brunei Darussalam]]
:The Ministers expressed their high appreciation to the ERIA for its valuable support in conducting the Final Report on the ASEAN Strategic Transport Plan (ASTP) 2011-2015.

== Comprehensive Economic Partnership in East-Asia  ==
The ERIA is tasked with reviewing the proposed [[Comprehensive Economic Partnership for East Asia]] or CEPEA, the Japanese proposed [[trade bloc]] involving the 16 nations of the East Asia Summit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU0803/S00068.htm Japanese Economists To Address NZ Business Leaders]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was decided at the [[Third East Asia Summit]] that the ERIA report on the Comprehensive Economic Partnership in East-Asia would be received at the [[Fourth East Asia Summit]].  The Fourth EAS was delayed for almost a year by reason of difficulties in the host nation [[Thailand]].

With the subsequent change of government in Japan, and the discussion by the new administration of the [[East Asia Community]] the future of CEPEA is not yet clear.

Subsequently the [[Fourth East Asia Summit]] supported further development on trading groupings based around the 13 country [[ASEAN Plus Three]] and the 16 country [[East Asia Summit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.15thaseansummit-th.org/PDF/25-08_EAS%20Statement.pdf Chairman’s Statement of the 4th East Asia Summit Cha-am Hua Hin, Thailand, 25 October 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091127213111/http://www.15thaseansummit-th.org/PDF/25-08_EAS%20Statement.pdf |date=27 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the subsequent [[APEC]] conference [[Australia]] announced a million Australian dollars in funding to ERIA to support research into the 16 country bloc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trademinister.gov.au/releases/2009/sc_091113.html Australia providing $1 million to boost regional integration]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18930">{{about|a form of fixed-precision arithmetic in computing|the invariant points of a mathematical function|Fixed point (mathematics)}}

In [[computing]], a '''fixed-point number''' representation is a [[real data type]] for a number that has a fixed number of digits after (and sometimes also before) the [[radix point]] (after the decimal point '.' in English decimal notation). Fixed-point number representation can be compared to the more complicated (and more computationally demanding) [[floating point|floating-point]] number representation.

Fixed-point numbers are useful for representing [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractional values]], usually in base 2 or base 10, when the executing [[central processing unit|processor]] has no [[floating point unit]] (FPU) or if fixed-point provides improved performance or accuracy for the application at hand. Older or low-cost [[embedded system|embedded]] [[microprocessor]]s and [[microcontroller]]s do not have an FPU.

==Representation==
A value of a fixed-point data type is essentially an [[integer]] that is scaled by an implicit specific factor determined by the type. For example, the value 1.23 can be represented as 1230 in a fixed-point data type with scaling factor of 1/1000, and the value 1,230,000 can be represented as 1230 with a scaling factor of 1000.  Unlike floating-point data types, the scaling factor is the same for all values of the same type, and does not change during the entire computation.

The scaling factor is usually a [[power (mathematics)|power]] of 10 (for human convenience) or a power of 2 (for computational efficiency).  However, other scaling factors may be used occasionally, e.g. a time value in hours may be represented as a fixed-point type with a scale factor of 1/3600 to obtain values with one-second accuracy.

The maximum value of a fixed-point type is simply the largest value that can be represented in the underlying integer type multiplied by the scaling factor; and similarly for the minimum value.

==Operations==
To convert a number from a fixed point type with scaling factor ''R'' to another type with scaling factor ''S'', the underlying integer must be multiplied by ''R'' and divided by ''S''; that is, multiplied by the ratio ''R''/''S''.  Thus, for example, to convert the value 1.23 = 123/100 from a type with scaling factor ''R''=1/100 to one with scaling factor ''S''=1/1000, the underlying integer 123 must be multiplied by (1/100)/(1/1000) = 10, yielding the representation 1230/1000.  If ''S'' does not divide ''R'' (in particular, if the new scaling factor ''S'' is greater than the original ''R''), the new integer will have to be [[rounding|rounded]].  The rounding rules and methods are usually part of the language's specification.

To add or subtract two values of the same fixed-point type, it is sufficient to add or subtract the underlying integers, and keep their common scaling factor.  The result can be exactly represented in the same type, as long as no [[arithmetic overflow|overflow]] occurs (i.e. provided that the sum of the two integers fits in the underlying integer type). If the numbers have different fixed-point types, with different scaling factors, then one of them must be converted to the other before the sum.

To multiply two fixed-point numbers, it suffices to multiply the two underlying integers, and assume that the scaling factor of the result is the product of their scaling factors. This operation involves no rounding. For example, multiplying the numbers 123 scaled by 1/1000 (0.123) and 25 scaled by 1/10 (2.5) yields the integer 123×25 = 3075 scaled by (1/1000)×(1/10) = 1/10000, that is 3075/10000 = 0.3075. If the two operands belong to the same fixed-point type, and the result is also to be represented in that type, then the product of the two integers must be explicitly multiplied by the common scaling factor; in this case the result may have to be rounded, and overflow may occur. For example, if the common scaling factor is 1/100, multiplying 1.23 by 0.25 entails multiplying 123 by 25 to yield 3075 with an intermediate scaling factor of 1/10000.  This then must be multiplied by 1/100 to yield either 31 (0.31) or 30 (0.30), depending on the rounding method used, to result in a final scale factor of 1/100.

To divide two fixed-point numbers, one takes the integer quotient of their underlying integers, and assumes that the scaling factor is the quotient of their scaling factors. The first division involves rounding in general. For example, division of 3456 scaled by 1/100 (34.56) and 1234 scaled by 1/1000 (1.234) yields the integer 3456÷1234 = 3 (rounded) with scale factor (1/100)/(1/1000) = 10, that is, 30.  One can obtain a more accurate result by first converting the [[dividend]] to a more precise type: in the same example, converting 3456 scaled by 1/100 (34.56) to 3,456,000 scaled by 1/100000, before dividing by 1234 scaled by 1/1000 (1.234), would yield 3456000÷1234 = 2801 (rounded) with scaling factor (1/100000)/(1/1000) = 1/100, that is 28.01 (instead of 30).  If both operands and the desired result are represented in the same fixed-point type, then the quotient of the two integers must be explicitly divided by the common scaling factor.

==Binary vs. decimal==
The two most common classes of fixed-point types are decimal and binary. Decimal fixed-point types have a scaling factor that is a power of ten; for binary fixed-point types it is a power of two.

Binary fixed-point types are most commonly used, because the rescaling operations can be implemented as fast [[bit shift]]s. Binary fixed-point numbers can represent fractional powers of two exactly, but, like binary floating-point numbers, cannot exactly represent fractional powers of ten.  If exact fractional powers of ten are desired, then a decimal format should be used.  For example, one-tenth (0.1) and one-hundredth (0.01) can be represented only approximately by binary fixed-point or binary floating-point representations, while they can be represented exactly in decimal fixed-point or decimal floating-point representations.  These representations may be encoded in many ways, including [[binary-coded decimal]] (BCD).

==Notation==
{{main article|Q (number format)}}

There are various notations used to represent word length and radix point in a binary fixed-point number. In the following list, ''f'' represents the number of fractional bits, ''m'' the number of magnitude or integer bits, ''s'' the number of sign bits, and ''b'' the total number of bits.

* '''Q'''''f'': The "Q" prefix. For example, Q15 represents a number with 15 fractional bits. This notation is ambiguous since it does not specify the word length, however it is usually assumed that the word length is either 16 or 32 bits depending on the target processor in use.&lt;ref name="ti"&gt;Texas Instruments, [http://focus.ti.com/lit/ug/spru565b/spru565b.pdf TMS320C64x DSP Library Programmer's Reference], Appendix A.2&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Q'''''m'''''.'''''f'': The unambiguous form of the "Q" notation. Since the entire word is a 2's complement integer, a sign bit is implied.  For example, Q1.30 describes a number with 1 integer bit and 30 fractional bits stored as a 32-bit 2's complement integer.&lt;ref name="ti"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/fixedpoint/ref/bp7g699.html#f6811|title=MathWorks Fixed-Point Toolbox Documentation Glossary|author=|date=|website=mathworks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''fx'''''m'''''.'''''b'': The "fx" prefix is similar to the above, but uses the word length as the second item in the dotted pair. For example, fx1.16 describes a number with 1 magnitude bit and 15 fractional bits in a 16 bit word.&lt;ref name="vsi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vissim.com/products/addons/vissim/fixed-point.html|title=VisSim is now solidThinking Embed|first=solidThinking,|last=Inc.|date=|website=www.vissim.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''s''''':'''''m''''':'''''f'': Yet other notations include a sign bit, such as this one used in the [[PlayStation 2|PS2]] GS User's Guide.&lt;ref&gt;PS2 GS User's Guide, Chapter 7.1 "Explanatory Notes"&lt;/ref&gt; It also differs from conventional usage by using a colon instead of a period as the separator. For example, in this notation, 0:8:0 represents an unsigned 8-bit integer.

==Precision loss and overflow==
Because fixed point operations can produce results that have more bits than the [[operand]]s, information loss is possible. For instance, the result of fixed point multiplication could potentially have as many bits as the sum of the number of bits in the two operands. In order to fit the result into the same number of bits as the operands, the answer must be [[Rounding|rounded]] or [[Truncation|truncated]]. If this is the case, the choice of which bits to keep is very important. When multiplying two fixed point numbers with the same format, for instance with &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; integer bits, and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; fractional bits, the answer could have up to &lt;math&gt;2I&lt;/math&gt; integer bits, and &lt;math&gt;2Q&lt;/math&gt; fractional bits.

For simplicity, many fixed-point multiply procedures use the same result format as the operands. This has the effect of keeping the middle bits; the &lt;var&gt;I&lt;/var&gt;-number of least significant integer bits, and the &lt;var&gt;Q&lt;/var&gt;-number of most significant fractional bits. Fractional bits lost below this value represent a precision loss which is common in fractional multiplication. If any integer bits are lost, however, the value will be radically inaccurate. Some model-based fixed-point packages&lt;ref name="vsi-fp"&gt;VisSim Fixed-Point User Guide|http://www.vissim.com/downloads/doc/EmbeddedControlsDeveloper_UGv80.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; allow you to specify a result format different from the input formats. This allows you to maximize precision and avoid overflow.

Some operations, like divide, often have built-in result limiting so that any positive overflow results in the largest possible number that can be represented by the current format. Likewise, negative overflow results in the largest negative number represented by the current format. This built in limiting is often referred to as ''saturation''.

Some processors support a hardware [[overflow flag]] that can generate an [[Exception handling|exception]] on the occurrence of an overflow, but it is usually too late to salvage the proper result at this point.

==Computer language implementations==
Very few computer languages include built-in support for fixed point values, because for most applications, binary or decimal floating-point representations are usually simpler to use and accurate enough. Floating-point representations are easier to use than fixed-point representations, because they can handle a wider dynamic range and do not require programmers to specify the number of digits after the radix point.  However, if they are needed, fixed-point numbers can be implemented even in programming languages like [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]], which do not commonly include such support.

A common use of fixed-point [[Binary-coded decimal|BCD]] numbers is for storing monetary values, where the inexact values of binary floating-point numbers are often a liability. Historically, fixed-point representations were the norm for decimal data types; for example, in [[PL/I]] or [[COBOL]]. The [[Ada programming language]] includes built-in support for both fixed-point (binary and decimal) and floating-point. [[JOVIAL programming language|JOVIAL]] and [[Coral 66]] also provide both floating- and fixed-point types.

ISO/IEC TR 18037&lt;ref&gt;JTC1/SC22/WG14, [http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/projects#18037 status of TR 18037: Embedded C]&lt;/ref&gt; specifies fixed-point data types for the C programming language; vendors are expected to implement the language extensions for fixed point arithmetic in coming years. Fixed-point support is implemented in [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]].&lt;ref&gt;GCC wiki, [https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/FixedPointArithmetic Fixed-Point Arithmetic Support]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Using GCC, [https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Fixed-Point.html section 5.13 Fixed-Point Types]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[C Sharp language|C#]] includes a decimal type, which supports a precision of 28-29 significant digits.

[[Python (programming language)|Python]] has included the [https://docs.python.org/2/library/decimal.html decimal] module in its standard libraries since version 2.4 (November, 2004).

Almost all relational [[database]]s, and the [[SQL]], support fixed-point decimal arithmetic and storage of numbers. [[PostgreSQL]] has a special &lt;tt&gt;numeric&lt;/tt&gt; type for exact storage of numbers with up to 1000 digits.&lt;ref&gt;PostgreSQL manual, [http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/datatype-numeric.html#DATATYPE-NUMERIC-DECIMAL section 8.1.2. Arbitrary Precision Numbers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software application examples==
{{example farm|section|date=August 2018}}

* [[libfixmath]] is a recent open-source library for the manipulation of fixed point numbers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://code.google.com/p/libfixmath|title=Google Code Archive - Long-term storage for Google Code Project Hosting.|author=|date=|website=code.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; it currently supports [[Q (number format)|Q16.16]] and [[Q (number format)|Q0.32]] formats and provides an interface similar to [[math.h]].
*The [https://github.com/nestlabs/nlutilities Nest Labs Utilities library], provides a limited set of macros and functions for fixed point numbers, particularly when dealing with those numbers in the context of sensor sampling and sensor outputs.
* [[GnuCash]] is an application for tracking money which is written in C. It switched from a floating-point representation of money to a fixed-point implementation as of version 1.6. This change was made to trade the less predictable rounding errors of floating-point representations for more control over rounding (for example, to the nearest [[Cent (currency)|cent]]).
* [[Tremor (software)|Tremor]], [[Toast (GSM)|Toast]] and [[MPEG Audio Decoder|MAD]] are software libraries which decode the [[Vorbis|Ogg Vorbis]], [[Full Rate|GSM Full Rate]] and [[MP3]] audio formats respectively. These codecs use fixed-point arithmetic because many audio decoding hardware devices do not have an FPU (partly to save money, but primarily to save power - integer units are much smaller in silicon area than an FPU) and audio decoding requires performance to the extent a software implementation of floating-point on low-speed devices would not produce output in real time.
* All [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] engines on Sony's original [[PlayStation]], Sega's [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]], Nintendo's [[Game Boy Advance]] (only [[2D computer graphics|2D]]), [[Nintendo DS]] (2D and 3D), [[Nintendo Gamecube]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2014/03/15/pixel-processing-problems/|title=Dolphin Emulator|author=|date=|website=Dolphin Emulator}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[GP2X Wiz]] video game systems use fixed-point arithmetic for the same reason as Tremor and Toast: to gain throughput on an architecture without an FPU (e.g. the PlayStation included hardware support for 4.12bit values in its transformation coprocessor).
* The [[OpenGL ES]] 1.x specification includes a fixed point profile, as it is an API aimed for embedded systems, which do not always have an FPU.
* [[TeX font metric]] files use 32-bit signed fixed-point numbers, with 12 bits to the left of the decimal, extensively.
* The [[dc (computer program)|dc]] and [[bc programming language|bc]] programs are [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic|arbitrary precision]] calculators, but only keep track of a (user-specified) fixed number of fractional digits.
* [[VisSim]] A visually programmed block diagram language supporting a fixed-point block set to allow simulation and automatic code generation of fixed-point operations. Both word size and radix point can be specified on an operator basis.
* [[Fractint]] represents numbers as [[Q (number format)|Q2.29]] fixed-point numbers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://spanky.triumf.ca/www/fractint/periodicity.html#integer_math_anchor Fractint, A Little Code]&lt;/ref&gt; to speed up drawing on old PCs with [[Intel 80386|386]] or [[Intel 80486SX|486SX]] processors, which lacked an FPU.
* ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' was the last [[first-person shooter]] title by [[id Software]] to use a 16.16 fixed point representation for all of its non-integer computations, including map system, geometry, rendering, player movement etc. This was done in order for the game to be playable on 386 and 486SX CPUs without an FPU. For compatibility reasons, this representation is still used in modern [[List of Doom source ports|''Doom'' source port]]s.
* [[SystemC]] provides signed and unsigned fixed point data types.
* [[WavPack|Wavpack]] is a fixed-point, lossless audio compressor. Its creator, David Bryant, justifies the decision to implement fixed instead of floating point: " I believe that integer operations are less susceptible to subtle chip to chip variations that could corrupt the lossless nature of the compression."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = WavPack Technical Description|url = http://www.wavpack.com/technical.htm|website = www.wavpack.com|accessdate = 2015-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* fixed point numbers are sometimes used for storing and manipulating images and video frames. Processors with [[SIMD]] units aimed at image processing may include instructions suitable for handling packed fixed point data.

'''Forensic electrical engineering''' is a branch of [[forensic engineering]], and is concerned with investigating electrical failures and accidents in a legal context.   Many forensic electrical engineering investigations apply to fires suspected to be caused by electrical failures.   Forensic electrical engineers are most commonly retained by insurance companies or attorneys representing insurance companies, or by manufacturers or contractors defending themselves against [[subrogation]] by insurance companies. Other areas of investigation include [[accident]] investigation involving [[electric shock|electrocution]], and [[intellectual property]] disputes such as [[patent]] actions. Additionally, since electrical fires are most often cited as the cause for "suspect" fires an electrical engineer is often employed to evaluate the electrical equipment and systems to determine whether the cause of the fire was electrical in nature.

The ultimate goal of these investigations is often to determine the legal liability for a [[fire]] or other [[accident]] for purposes of [[insurance]] [[subrogation]] or an injury lawsuit.   Some examples include:
* ''Defective appliances'':   If a property fire was caused by an appliance which had a manufacturing or design defect (for example, a [[coffee maker]] overheating and igniting), making it unreasonably hazardous, the insurance company might attempt to collect the cost of the fire damage ("subrogate") from the manufacturer; if the fire caused personal injury or death, the injured party might also attempt an injury lawsuit against the manufacturer, in addition to the carrier of health or life insurance attempting subrogation.
* ''Improper workmanship'':   If, for example, an [[electrician]] made an improper installation in a house, leading to an electrical fault and fire, he or she could likewise be the target of subrogation or an injury lawsuit (for this reason, electricians are required to carry liability insurance).
* ''Electrical injury'':   If an electrical fault or unreasonably hazardous electrical system causes an [[Electric shock|electrical injury]] ("electrocution" if the injury is fatal), the party responsible for the electrical accident can be the target of insurance subrogation or an injury lawsuit.
* ''Equipment failure'': if electrical equipment stops functioning, it can cause a loss of income (such as a factory losing productivity due to inoperative equipment) or additional damage (such as food products spoiling due to loss of refrigeration), and again be the subject of a subrogation or liability case.   Liability in such a case can also include the cost of repairing or replacing the equipment, which can be substantial.

==Applications==
Forensic electrical engineers are also involved in some [[arson]] and set-fire investigations; while it is not common for arsonists to cause electrical failures to ignite fires, the presence of electrical appliances and systems in many fires scenes often requires them to be evaluated as possible accidental causes of the fire.   Some electrical means of ignition, when discovered, are fairly obvious to an [[origin and cause investigator]] and most likely do not require consulting with a forensic electrical engineer.   (Note that "arson" refers specifically to a criminal act, subject to criminal prosecution; a more general term is a "set fire".   A homeowner setting a fire deliberately in order to defraud an insurance company might be prosecuted for arson by a government body; however, the insurance company would concern itself only with denying the insurance claim, possibly leading to a civil lawsuit.)

Patent disputes may also require the expert opinion of an electrical engineer to advise a court. Issues in conflict may include the precise meaning of technical terms, especially in the [[claim (patent)|patent claim]]s, the [[prior art]] in a particular product field and the [[inventive step and non-obviousness|obviousness]] of various patents.

==Liability==
Most states have a statute of ultimate repose (similar to, but not to be confused with, a statute of limitations) that limits the length of time after which a party can legally be held liable for their negligent act or defective product.  Many states have a "useful life" statute of ultimate repose.  Therefore, a determination of the length of time the product would normally be expected to be used before wearing out needs to be made. For example, a refrigerator might have a longer "useful life" than an electric fan; an airplane might have a longer useful life than a car.  Some states pick an arbitrary number of years for the statute of ultimate repose.  It may be short (six or seven years) or longer 15 or 25 years.  If a coffee maker starts on fire after the statute of ultimate repose has expired, the manufacturer can no longer be held liable for manufacturing or design defects.  The statute of ultimate repose is different from the statute of limitations.  In a state with a short statute of ultimate repose, it is common that a person's right to bring a claim in court expires before their injury ever occurs.  Thus, if a defective product (for example a car) caused a collision when the steering failed, but the collision occurred after the expiration of a statute of ultimate repose, no claim could be brought against the manufacturer for selling a defective product.  The right to bring the claim expired before the claim even occurred.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4403">In [[astronomical spectroscopy]], the '''Gunn–Peterson trough''' is a feature of the [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectra]] of [[quasars]] due to the presence of neutral [[hydrogen]] in the [[Intergalactic space|Intergalactic Medium (IGM)]]. The trough is characterized by suppression of [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic emission]] from the quasar at wavelengths less than that of the [[Lyman series|Lyman-alpha]] line at the [[redshift]] of the emitted light. This effect was originally predicted in 1965 by [[James E. Gunn (astronomer)|James E. Gunn]] and [[Bruce Peterson (astronomer)|Bruce Peterson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gunn | first = J.E. |author2=Peterson, B.A. | title=On the Density of Neutral Hydrogen in Intergalactic Space | journal=Astrophysical Journal | date=1965 | volume=142 | pages=1633–1641 | bibcode=1965ApJ...142.1633G | doi=10.1086/148444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First detection==

For over three decades after the prediction, no objects had been found distant enough to show the Gunn–Peterson trough. It was not until 2001, with the discovery of a quasar with a redshift z = 6.28 by Robert Becker and others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Becker | first=R. H. |display-authors=etal | title=Evidence For Reionization at z ~ 6: Detection of a Gunn-Peterson Trough in a z=6.28 Quasar | date=2001 | journal=Astronomical Journal | volume=122 | issue=6 | pages=2850–2857 | bibcode=2001AJ....122.2850B | doi=10.1086/324231|arxiv = astro-ph/0108097 }}&lt;/ref&gt; using data from the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]], that a Gunn–Peterson trough was finally observed. The paper also included quasars at redshifts of z = 5.82 and z = 5.99, and, while each of these exhibited absorption at wavelengths on the blue side of the Lyman-alpha transition, there were numerous spikes in flux as well. The flux of the quasar at z = 6.28, however, was effectively zero beyond the Lyman-alpha limit, meaning that the neutral hydrogen fraction in the IGM must have been larger than ~10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Evidence for reionization==
{{See also|Reionization}}

The discovery of the trough in a z = 6.28 quasar, and the absence of the trough in quasars detected at redshifts just below z = 6 presented strong evidence for the hydrogen in the universe having undergone a transition from neutral to ionized around z = 6. After [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]], the universe was expected to be neutral, until the first objects in the universe started emitting light and energy which would [[reionization|reionize]] the surrounding IGM. However, as the scattering cross section of photons with energies near that of the Lyman-alpha limit with neutral hydrogen is very high, even a small fraction of neutral hydrogen will make the [[optical depth]] of the IGM high enough to cause the suppression of emission observed. Despite the fact that the ratio of neutral hydrogen to ionized hydrogen may not have been particularly high, the low flux observed past the Lyman-alpha limit indicates that the universe was in the final stages of reionization.

Following the first release of data from the [[WMAP]] spacecraft in 2003, the determination by Becker that the end of reionization occurred at z ≈ 6 appeared to conflict with estimates made from the WMAP measurement of the electron column density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kogut |first=A. |display-authors=etal | title=First-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Temperature-Polarization Correlation | date=2003 | journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series | volume=148 | issue=1 | pages = 161–173 | bibcode=2003ApJS..148..161K | doi=10.1086/377219|arxiv = astro-ph/0302213 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the WMAP III data released in 2006 now seems to be in much better agreement with the limits on reionization placed by observation of the Gunn–Peterson trough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Page | first=L. |display-authors=etal | title=Three-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Polarization Analysis | date=2007 | journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series | volume=170 | issue=2 | pages=335–376 | bibcode=2007ApJS..170..335P | doi=10.1086/513699|arxiv = astro-ph/0603450 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plant breeding''' started with [[sedentism|sedentary]] [[agriculture]], particularly the domestication of the first [[agriculture|agricultural]] plants, a practice which is estimated to date back 9,000 to 11,000 years. Initially, early human farmers selected food plants with particular desirable characteristics and used these as a seed source for subsequent generations, resulting in an accumulation of characteristics over time. In time however, experiments began with deliberate hybridization, the science and understanding of which was greatly enhanced by the work of [[Gregor Mendel]]. Mendel's work ultimately led to the new science of [[genetics]]. Modern plant breeding is applied genetics, but its scientific basis is broader, covering [[molecular biology]], [[cell biology|cytology]], [[systematics]], [[physiology]], [[pathology]], [[entomology]], [[chemistry]], and [[statistics]] ([[biometrics]]). It has also developed its own technology. Plant breeding efforts are divided into a number of different historical landmarks.

==Early plant breeding==

===Domestication===
[[Image:Feature2originmap600.png|right|thumb|400px|This map shows the sites of domestication for a number of crops. Places where crops were initially domesticated are called [[centers of origin]]]]
{{main|Domestication}}
{{main|History of agriculture}}

Domestication of plants is an artificial selection process conducted by humans to produce plants that have more desirable traits than wild plants, and which renders them dependent on artificial usually enhanced environments for their continued existence. The practice is estimated to date back 9,000-11,000 years. Many crops in present-day cultivation are the result of domestication in ancient times, about 5,000 years ago in the [[Old World]] and 3,000 years ago in the [[New World]]. In the [[Neolithic]] period, domestication took a minimum of 1,000 years and a maximum of 7,000 years. Today, all principal [[food]] crops come from domesticated varieties. Almost all the domesticated plants used today for food and agriculture were domesticated in the [[centers of origin]]. In these centers there is still a great diversity of closely related wild plants, so-called [[crop wild relatives]], that can also be used for improving modern cultivars by plant breeding.

A plant whose origin or selection is due primarily to intentional human activity is called a [[cultigen]], and a cultivated crop [[species]] that has evolved from [[Wilderness|wild]] populations due to selective pressures from traditional [[farmer]]s is called a [[landrace]]. Landraces, which can be the result of natural forces or domestication, are plants or [[animal]]s that are ideally suited to a particular region or environment. An example are the landraces of [[rice]], ''Oryza sativa'' [[subspecies]] ''indica'', which was developed in [[South Asia]], and ''Oryza sativa'' subspecies ''japonica'', which was developed in [[China]].

For more on the mechanisms of domestication, see [[Hybrid (biology)]].

===Columbian Exchange===
{{main|Columbian exchange}}
{{see also|Economic botany}}
Humans have traded useful plants from distant lands for centuries, and [[plant collecting|plant hunters]] have been sent to bring plants back for cultivation. Human agriculture has had two important results: the plants most favoured by humans came to be grown in many places and (2) gardens and farms have provided some opportunities for plants to interbreed that would not have been possible for their wild ancestors. [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]'s arrival in America in 1492 triggered unprecedented transfer of plant resources between [[Europe]] and the [[New World]].

==Scientific plant breeding==
[[Image:Gartons-1902-Catalogue.jpg|thumb|right|Garton's catalogue from 1902]]
[[Gregor Mendel]]'s experiments with plant [[hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] led to his [[Mendelian inheritance|laws of inheritance]]. This work became well known in the 1900s and formed the basis of the new science of [[genetics]], which stimulated research by many plant scientists dedicated to improving crop production through plant breeding.

However, successful commercial plant breeding concerns began to be founded from the late 19th century. [[Gartons Agricultural Plant Breeders]] in England was established in the 1890s by John Garton, who was one of the first to cross-pollinate agricultural plants and commercialize the newly created varieties. He began experimenting with the artificial cross pollination firstly of cereal plants, then herbage species and root crops and developed far reaching techniques in plant breeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agri.ankara.edu.tr/fcrops/1289__PBARTSCIENCE.doc|title=Plant breeding}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, Warrington Examiner, 11 February 1950&lt;/ref&gt;

William Farrer revolutionized wheat farming in Australia with the widespread release in 1903 of the fungus resistant "Federation" strain of wheat, which was developed as a result of his plant breeding work over a period of twenty years using Mendel's theories.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Farrer]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=February 2017}}

From 1904 to World War II in [[Italy]], [[Nazareno Strampelli]] created a number of wheat hybrids. His work allowed Italy to increase crop production during the so-called "[[Battle for Grain]]" (1925–1940) and some varieties were exported to foreign countries, such as Argentina, Mexico, and China. Strampelli's work laid the foundations for [[Norman Borlaug]] and the [[Green Revolution]].

===Green revolution===
{{main|Green Revolution}}
In 1908, [[George Harrison Shull]] described [[heterosis]], also known as hybrid vigor. Heterosis describes the tendency of the progeny of a specific cross to outperform both parents. The detection of the usefulness of heterosis for plant breeding has led to the development of inbred lines that reveal a heterotic yield advantage when they are crossed. [[Maize]] was the first species where heterosis was widely used to produce hybrids.

By the 1920s, [[statistics|statistical]] methods were developed to analyze gene action and distinguish heritable variation from variation caused by environment. In 1933 another important breeding technique, [[cytoplasmic male sterility]] (CMS), developed in maize, was described by [[Marcus Morton Rhoades]]. CMS is a maternally inherited trait that makes the plant produce sterile [[pollen]]. This enables the production of hybrids without the need for labor-intensive [[detasseling]].

These early breeding techniques resulted in large yield increase in the [[United States]] in the early 20th century. Similar yield increases were not produced elsewhere until after [[World War II]], the [[Green Revolution]] increased crop production in the developing world in the 1960s. This remarkable improvement was based on three essential crops. First came the development of hybrid [[maize]], then high-yielding and input-responsive "[[Norin 10 wheat|semi-dwarf wheat]]" (for which the [[CIMMYT]] breeder N.E. [[Borlaug]] received the [[Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel prize for peace]] in 1970), and third came high-yielding "short statured rice" cultivars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kenji Asano |author2=Masanori Yamasaki |author3=Shohei Takuno |author4=Kotaro Miura |author5=Satoshi Katagiri |author6=Tomoko Ito |author7=Kazuyuki Doi |author8=Jianzhong Wu |author9=Kaworu Ebana |author10=Takashi Matsumoto |author11=Hideki Innan |author12=Hidemi Kitano |author13=Motoyuki Ashikari |author14=Makoto Matsuoka |year= 2011|title=Artificial selection for a green revolution gene during japonica rice domestication|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=108|issue=27|pages=11034–11039|pmid=21646530|doi=10.1073/pnas.1019490108|pmc=3131315}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly notable improvements were achieved in other crops like [[sorghum]] and [[alfalfa]].

===Molecular genetics and bio-revolution===
Intensive research in [[molecular genetics]] has led to the development of recombinant [[DNA]] technology (popularly called [[genetic engineering]]). Advancement in biotechnological techniques has opened many possibilities for [[plant breeding|breeding]] crops. Thus, while mendelian genetics allowed plant breeders to perform genetic transformations in a few crops, molecular genetics has provided the key to both the manipulation of the internal genetic structure, and the "crafting" of new cultivars according to a pre-determined plan.

[[File:PetraAqueduct.jpg|thumb|Aqueduct in [[Petra, Jordan]].]]
The '''history of water supply and sanitation''' is one of a [[logistics|logistical]] challenge to provide [[Water supply|clean water]] and [[sanitation]] systems since the dawn of [[civilization]]. Where water resources, infrastructure or sanitation systems were insufficient, diseases spread and people fell sick or died prematurely. 

Major human settlements could initially develop only where fresh surface water was plentiful, such as near rivers or [[natural springs]]. Throughout history, people have devised systems to make getting water into their communities and households and disposing (and later also treating) [[wastewater]] more convenient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/22932774/The_Art_of_Plumbing_as_Recorded_through_History|title=The Art of Plumbing as Recorded through History|website=www.academia.edu|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical focus of [[sewage treatment]] was on the conveyance of raw sewage to a natural body of water, e.g. a [[river]] or [[ocean]], where it would be diluted and dissipated. Early [[human]] habitations were often built next to water sources. Rivers would often serve as a crude form of natural sewage disposal.

Over the millennia, technology has dramatically increased the distances across which water can be relocated. Furthermore, treatment processes to purify [[drinking water]] and to treat wastewater have been improved.

==Prehistory==
[[File:Skara Brae house 1 5.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Skara Brae]], a Neolithic village in [[Orkney]], Scotland with home furnishings including [[Flush toilet|water-flushing toilets]] 3180 BC–2500 BC]]
 
During the [[Neolithic]], humans dug the first permanent [[water well]]s, from where vessels could be filled and carried by hand. Wells dug around 6500&amp;nbsp;BC have been found in the [[Jezreel Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ashkenazi|first=Eli|title=Ancient well reveals secrets of first Jezreel Valley farmers|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/ancient-well-reveals-secrets-of-first-jezreel-valley-farmers-1.476288|work=haaretz.com|publisher=Haaretz|accessdate=26 March 2014|date=Nov 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of human settlements was largely dependent on nearby available water.

A primitive indoor, tree bark lined, two-channel, stone, fresh and wastewater system appears to have featured in the houses of in [[Skara Brae]], from around 3000 BCE, along with a cell-like enclave in a number of houses, that it has been suggested may have functioned as an early indoor toilet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ginenthal|first1=Charles|title=Pillars of the Past Volume Four|date=2015|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781329747944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indus Valley Civilization ===
{{Further information|Sanitation in the Indus Valley Civilization}}
[[File:WellAndBathingPlatforms-Harappa.jpg|right|thumb|A large well and bathing platforms at [[Harappa]], remains of the city's final phase of occupation from 2200 to 1900&amp;nbsp; BC.]]
The [[Indus Valley Civilization]] in Asia shows [[Sanitation in the Indus Valley Civilization|early evidence of public water supply and sanitation]]. The system the Indus developed and managed included a number of advanced features. A typical example is the Indus city of [[Lothal]] (c. 2350 BCE). In Lothal all houses had their own private toilet which was connected to a covered sewer network constructed of brickwork held together with a gypsum-based mortar that emptied either into the surrounding water bodies or alternatively into [[cesspit]]s, the latter of which were regularly emptied and cleaned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Khan|first1=Saifullah|title=1 Chapter 2 Sanitation and wastewater technologies in Harappa/Indus valley civilization ( ca . 2600-1900 BC)|url=https://www.academia.edu/5937322/Chapter_2_Sanitation_and_wastewater_technologies_in_Harappa_Indus_valley_civilization_ca._26001900_BC|website=Academia.edu|publisher=Academia.edu|accessdate=9 April 2015|ref=https://www.academia.edu/5937322/Chapter_2_Sanitation_and_wastewater_technologies_in_Harappa_Indus_valley_civilization_ca._26001900_BC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maya plumbing: First pressurized water feature found in New World|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100504155421.htm|publisher=Penn State|accessdate=26 March 2014|date=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The urban areas of the Indus Valley civilization included public and private baths. Sewage was disposed through underground drains built with precisely laid bricks, and a sophisticated water management system with numerous reservoirs was established. In the drainage systems, drains from houses were connected to wider public drains.&lt;ref&gt;Rodda, J. C. and Ubertini, Lucio (2004). The Basis of Civilization - Water Science? pg 161. International Association of Hydrological Sciences (International Association of Hydrological Sciences Press 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest evidence of urban sanitation was seen in [[Harappa]], [[Mohenjo-daro]], and the recently discovered [[Rakhigarhi]] of Indus Valley civilization. This urban plan included the world's first urban sanitation systems. Within the city, individual homes or groups of homes obtained water from [[Water well|wells]]. From a room that appears to have been set aside for bathing, waste water was directed to covered drains, which lined the major streets.

Devices such as [[shadoof]]s and [[sakia]]s were used to lift water to ground level. Ruins from the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] like [[Mohenjo-daro]] in Pakistan and [[Dholavira]] in [[Gujarat]] in India had settlements with some of the ancient world's most sophisticated sewage systems. They included drainage channels, rainwater harvesting, and street ducts.

[[Stepwell]]s have mainly been used in the Indian subcontinent.

The earliest covered sewers uncovered by [[archaeologist]]s are in the regularly planned cities of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

=== Wastewater reuse activities ===
Wastewater reuse is an ancient practice, which has been applied since the dawn of human history, and is connected to the development of sanitation provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1994/04/01/000009265_3961006165519/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf|title=Reuse of wastewater in agriculture: A guide for planners|last2=Kalbermatten|first2=J. M.|last3=Bartone|first3=C. R.|last1=Khouri|first1=N|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reuse of untreated [[municipal wastewater]] has been practiced for many centuries with the objective of diverting [[human waste]] outside of urban settlements. Likewise, land application of domestic wastewater is an old and common practice, which has gone through different stages of development.   

Domestic wastewater was used for irrigation by prehistoric civilizations (e.g. [[Mesopotamia]]n, [[Indus Valley|Indus valley]], and [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]) since the Bronze Age (ca. 3200-1100 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Snyder|first2=Shane A.|date=9 September 2015|title=Wastewater Treatment and Reuse: Past, Present, and Future|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/7/9/4887/htm|journal=Water|language=en|volume=7|issue=9|pages=4887–4895|doi=10.3390/w7094887|last1=Angelakis|first1=Andreas N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, wastewater was used for [[Waste disposal|disposal]], [[irrigation]], and [[Fertilizer|fertilization]] purposes by Hellenic civilizations and later by Romans in areas surrounding cities (e.g. Athens and Rome).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Paranychianaki|first2=N.

Some of the earliest evidence of water wells are located in China. The Neolithic Chinese discovered and made extensive use of deep drilled groundwater for drinking. The Chinese text ''[[I Ching|The Book of Changes]]'', originally a divination text of the Western Zhou dynasty (1046 -771 BC), contains an entry describing how the ancient Chinese maintained their wells and protected their sources of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper |last=Kuhn |first=Oliver  |date=2004-06-30 |title=Ancient Chinese Drilling |url=https://csegrecorder.com/articles/view/ancient-chinese-drilling |journal=Canadian Society of Exploration Geophysicists |publisher= Canadian Society of Exploration Geophysicists |volume=29 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological evidence and old Chinese documents reveal that the prehistoric and ancient Chinese had the aptitude and skills for digging deep water wells for drinking water as early as 6000 to 7000 years ago.

==== Ancient Greece ====
The ancient Greek civilization of [[Crete]], known as the [[Minoan civilization]], was the [[first civilization]] to use underground clay pipes for sanitation and water supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Plumbing - CRETE|url=http://www.theplumber.com/crete.html|work=theplumber.com|publisher=theplumber.com|accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their capital, [[Knossos]], had a well-organized water system for bringing in clean water, taking out waste water and storm sewage canals for overflow when there was heavy rain. It was also one of the first uses of a [[flush toilet]], dating back to the 18th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fieldnotes|url=http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10854/knossos.html#fieldnotes|work=themodernantiquarian.com|accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Minoan civilization]] had stone sewers that were periodically flushed with clean water.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} In addition to sophisticated water and sewer systems they devised elaborate heating systems. The Ancient Greeks of [[Athens]] and [[Asia Minor]] also used an indoor plumbing system, used for pressurized showers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Inventions Showers |url=http://www.inventions.org/culture/ancient/showers.html |work=inventions.org |publisher=inventions.org |accessdate=26 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509052435/http://www.inventions.org/culture/ancient/showers.html |archivedate=May 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Greek inventor [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron]] used pressurized piping for fire fighting purposes in the City of [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jaffe|first=Eric|title=Old World, High Tech|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/old-world-high-tech-141284744/?no-ist=|work=smithsonianmag.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mayans were the third earliest civilization to have employed a system of indoor plumbing using pressurized water&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100504155421.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

An inverted siphon system, along with glass covered clay pipes, was used for the first time in the palaces of Crete, Greece. It is still in working condition, after about 3000 years.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==== Ancient Rome ====
{{Further information|Sanitation in Ancient Rome}}
[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pont du Gard]], a [[Roman aqueduct]] in France.]]
In ancient Rome, the [[Cloaca Maxima]], considered a marvel of engineering,{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} disgorged into the [[Tiber]].

Public [[latrine]]s were built over the Cloaca Maxima.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/pstartinventions/a/Plumbing_3.htm|title=The History of Toilets|publisher=Mary Bellis|accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman Empire]] had [[Sanitation in Ancient Rome|indoor plumbing]], meaning a system of [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]] and pipes that terminated in homes and at public wells and fountains for people to use. Rome and other nations used [[lead]] pipes; while commonly thought to be the cause of lead poisoning in the Roman Empire, the combination of running water which did not stay in contact with the pipe for long and the deposition of [[Fouling|precipitation scale]] actually mitigated the risk from lead pipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/wine/leadpoisoning.html |title=Lead Poisoning and Rome |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website= |publisher= |accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hodge|1992|p=308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman towns and garrisons in the [[United Kingdom]] between 46 BC and 400 AD had complex sewer networks sometimes constructed out of hollowed-out [[elm]] logs, which were shaped so that they butted together with the down-stream pipe providing a socket for the upstream pipe.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Ancient Near East===
====Mesopotamia====
The Mesopotamians introduced the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples found in the Temple of Bel at [[Nippur]] and at [[Eshnunna]].&lt;ref name="FLUORIDATED WATER CONTROVERSY"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burke|first1=Joseph|title=FLUORIDATED WATER CONTROVERSY|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fdIoDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=The+Babylonians+introduced+the+world+to+clay+sewer+pipes,+c4000+BCE,+with+the+earliest+examples+found+in+the+Temple+of+Bel+at+Nippur+and+at+Eshnunna,+Babylonia.#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Babylonians%20introduced%20the%20world%20to%20clay%20sewer%20pipes%2C%20c4000%20BCE%2C%20with%20the%20earliest%20examples%20found%20in%20the%20Temple%20of%20Bel%20at%20Nippur%20and%20at%20Eshnunna%2C%20Babylonia.&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 August 2017|isbn=9781365912870|date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clay pipes were later used in the [[Hittites|Hittite]] city of [[Hattusa]]. They had easily detachable and replaceable segments, and allowed for cleaning.

==Middle and early modern age==

[[File:Wismarer Wasserkunst.jpg|thumb|right|Waterworks (''Wasserkunst'') and fountain from 1602 in [[Wismar]], Germany.]]
In medieval European cities, small natural waterways used for carrying off [[wastewater]] were eventually covered over and functioned as sewers. [[London]]'s [[River Fleet]] is such a system. Open drains, or gutters, for waste water run-off ran along the center of some streets. These were known as "kennels" (i.e., canals, channels), and in Paris were sometimes known as “split streets,” as the waste water running along the middle physically split the streets into two halves. The first closed sewer constructed in Paris was designed by Hugues Aubird in 1370 on Monmartre Street, and was 300 meters long. The original purpose of designing and constructing a closed sewer in Paris was less-so for waste management as much as it was to hold back the stench coming from the odorous waste water.&lt;ref name="George Commair 2009"&gt;George Commair, "The Waste Water Network: and underground view of Paris," in Great Rivers History: Proceedings and Invited Papers for the EWRI Congress and History Symposium, May 17–19, 2009, Kansas City, Missouri, ed. Jerry R. Roger, (Reston: American Society of Civil Engineers, 2009), 91-96&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Dubrovnik]], then known as Ragusa (Latin name), Statute from 1272. set out the parameters for the construction of septic tanks and channels for the removal of dirty water. Throughout 14. and 15. century sewage system was completed, and it is still operational today, with minor changes and repairs done in recent centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Medieval Sewerage of the City of Dubrovnik, Ivica Žile ; Ministarstvo kulture Uprava za zaštitu kulturne baštine Konzervatorski odjel u Dubrovniku, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Pail closet]]s, [[outhouse]]s, and [[cesspit]]s were used to collect human waste. The use of human waste as [[fertilizer]] was especially important in China and Japan, where cattle manure was less available. However, most cities did not have a functioning sewer system before the [[Industrial era]], relying instead on nearby rivers or occasional [[rain]] showers to wash away the sewage from the streets. In some places, [[waste water]] simply ran down the streets, which had [[Step-stone bridge|stepping stones]] to keep pedestrians out of the muck, and eventually drained as runoff into the local watershed.

In the 16th century, [[John Harington (writer)|Sir John Harington]] invented a flush toilet as a device for [[Queen Elizabeth I]] (his godmother) that released wastes into [[cesspool]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

After the adoption of [[gunpowder]], municipal outhouses became an important source of raw material for the making of [[saltpeter]] in European countries.&lt;ref&gt;Firearms: A Global History to 1700, Kenneth Chase&lt;/ref&gt;

In London, the contents of the city's outhouses were collected every night by commissioned wagons and delivered to the nitrite beds where it was laid into specially designed soil beds to produce earth rich in mineral nitrates. The nitrate rich-earth would be then further processed to produce saltpeter, or [[potassium nitrate]], an important ingredient in [[black powder]] that played a part in the making of gunpower.&lt;ref&gt;Instructions for the Manufacture of Saltpetre, Joseph LeConte, 1823-1901&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classic and Early Modern Mesoamerica===
The [[Classic Maya]] at [[Palenque]] had underground aqueducts and [[flush toilet]]s; the Classic Maya even used household water filters using locally abundant limestone carved into a porous cylinder, made so as to work in a manner strikingly similar to Modern [[ceramic water filter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Environmental and Water Resources Milestones in Engineering History|date=March 15–19, 2007|publisher=ASCE Publications|location=Tampa, Florida, USA|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_tS1Zb_5KKsC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=palenque+aqueduct+water+engineering|isbn=9780784471968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Penn State"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maya plumbing: First pressurized water feature found in New World|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100504155421.htm|work=Science Daily|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sewage farms for disposal and irrigation=== 

“[[Sewage farm|Sewage farms]]” (i.e. wastewater application to the land for disposal and agricultural use) were operated in Bunzlau (Silesia) in 1531, in Edinburgh (Scotland) in 1650, in Paris (France) in 1868, in Berlin (Germany) in 1876 and in different parts of the USA since 1871, where wastewater was used for beneficial crop production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1999/09/17/000178830_98101911161131/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf|title=Wastewater Irrigation in Developing Countries: Health Effects and Technical Solutions|last2=Adin|first2=A|last3=Fattal|first3=B|last1=Shuval|first1=H.I|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.iwapublishing.com/books/9781780404844/evolution-sanitation-and-wastewater-technologies-through-centuries|title=Evolution of sanitation and wastewater technologies through the centuries|last=|first=|date=2014|publisher=IWA (International Water Association)|isbn=9781780404844|location=[S.l.]|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following centuries (16th and 18th centuries) in many rapidly growing countries/cities of Europe (e.g. Germany, France) and the United States, “sewage farms” were increasingly seen as a solution for the disposal of large volumes of the wastewater, some of which are still in operation today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Bahri|first2=A|last3=Brissaud|first3=F|last4=Angelakis|first4=A.

=== Sewer systems===
{{further information|Combined_sewer#History}}
[[File:BrisbaneSuburbanOuthouses1950.jpg|thumb|Many industrialized cities had incomplete public sanitation well into the 20th century. Outhouses in [[Brisbane]], Australia, around 1950.]]
A significant development was the construction of a network of sewers to collect wastewater. In some cities, including [[Rome]], [[Istanbul]] ([[Constantinople]]) and [[Fustat]], networked ancient sewer systems continue to function today as collection systems for those cities' modernized sewer systems. Instead of flowing to a river or the sea, the pipes have been re-routed to modern sewer treatment facilities.

However, until the [[Enlightenment era]], little progress was made in water supply and sanitation and the engineering skills of the Romans were largely neglected throughout Europe. This began to change in the 17th and 18th centuries with a rapid expansion in waterworks and [[pumping station|pumping systems]].

The tremendous [[Urbanization|growth of cities]] during the [[Industrial Revolution]] quickly led to terribly [[Pollution|overpolluted]] streets, which acted as a constant source for the outbreak of disease.{{sfn|Abellán|2017|pp=4-8}}

People wealthy enough to enjoy 19th century flush [[toilet]]s often had the political power to allow them to drain into public sewers; and the practice became the norm as indoor plumbing became more common, based on large-scale supply networks such as the [[Croton Aqueduct]] in New York.

As cities grew in the 19th century, increasing concerns were raised about [[public health]].&lt;ref name="Burian"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burian|first=Steven J.|last2=Nix|first2=Stephan J.|last3=Pitt|first3=Robert E.|last4=Durrans|first4=S.

Initially these systems discharged sewage directly to [[surface water]]s without treatment.{{sfn|Abellán|2017|p=12}} Later, cities attempted to treat the sewage before discharge in order to prevent [[water pollution]] and [[waterborne diseases]]. During the half-century around 1900, these [[public health]] interventions succeeded in drastically reducing the incidence of water-borne diseases among the urban population, and were an important cause in the increases of [[life expectancy]] experienced at the time.&lt;ref name="nber.org"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cutler |first=David M. |first2=Grant |last2=Miller |title=The Role of Public Health Improvements in Health Advances: The 20th Century United States |journal=[[Demography (journal)|Demography]] |volume=42 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=1–22 |doi=10.1353/dem.2005.0002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early techniques involved land application of sewage on agricultural land.{{sfn|Abellán|2017|p=12}} The use of the land treatment systems continued into the nineteenth/twentieth century in central Europe, USA, and other locations all over the world, but not without causing serious public health concerns and negative environmental impacts. During the 1840s and 1850s, this practice resulted in disastrous spread of waterborne diseases like cholera and typhoid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Wastewater reclamation and reuse, Water Quality Management Library|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9vAGkleP234C&amp;pg=PR29 |via=[[Google Books]] |last1=Asano|first1=T|accessdate=29 July 2016|isbn=9781566766203|date=1998-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the water supply links with these diseases became clear, engineering solutions were implemented that include the development of alternative water sources using reservoirs and aqueduct systems, relocation of water intakes, and water and wastewater treatment systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.eolss.net/ebooks/sample%20chapters/c07/e2-14-01.pdf|title=RECYCLE AND REUSE OF DOMESTIC WASTEWATER|last2=Sundaravadivel|first2=M|last1=Vigneswaran|first1=S|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century some cities began to add chemical treatment and [[Sewage treatment#Primary treatment|sedimentation]] systems to their sewers.&lt;ref name="Metcalf 19142" /&gt;{{rp|28}} Most cities in the Western world added more expensive systems for [[sewage treatment]] in the 20th century, after scientists at the [[University of Manchester]] discovered the sewage treatment process of [[activated sludge]] in 1912.&lt;ref name="Benidickson, Jamie 2011"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_v0WjdM6sLoC|title=The Culture of Flushing: A Social and Legal History of Sewage|publisher=UBC Press|year=2011|author=Benidickson, Jamie|accessdate=2013-02-07|isbn=9780774841382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[storm drain|Storm]] and [[sanitary sewer]]s were necessarily developed along with the growth of cities. By the 1840s the luxury of [[indoor plumbing]], which mixes human waste with water and flushes it away, eliminated the need for [[cesspool]]s.  The odor was considered the big problem in waste disposal and to address it, sewage could be drained to a [[aerated lagoon|lagoon]], or "settled" and the solids removed, to be disposed of separately.  This process is now called "primary treatment" and the settled solids are called "sludge."

==== London and other cities, UK ====
As recently as the late 19th-century sewerage systems in some parts of the rapidly industrializing [[United Kingdom]] were so inadequate that [[water-borne disease]]s such as [[cholera]] and [[typhoid]] remained a risk.

From as early as 1535 there were efforts to stop polluting the [[River Thames]] in [[London]]. Beginning with an Act passed that year that was to prohibit the dumping of excrement into the river. Leading up to the Industrial Revolution the River Thames was identified as being thick and black due to sewage, and it was even said that the river “smells like death.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title="Filthy River" in Thames: Sacred River|date=2007|publisher=Nan A. Talese/Doubleday|location=New York|pages=270–275|last1=Ackroyd|first1=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Britain was the first country to industrialize, it was also the first to experience the disastrous consequences of major [[urbanisation]] and was the first to construct a modern sewerage system to mitigate the resultant unsanitary conditions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} During the early 19th century, the River Thames was effectively an open sewer, leading to frequent outbreaks of [[cholera]] epidemics. Proposals to modernize the sewerage system had been made during 1856 but were neglected due to lack of funds. However, after the ''[[Great Stink]]'' of 1858, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] realized the urgency of the problem and resolved to create a modern sewerage system.{{sfn|Abellán|2017|p=9}}

[[Joseph Bazalgette]], a [[civil engineer]] and Chief Engineer of the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]], was given responsibility for the work. He designed an extensive underground sewerage system that diverted waste to the [[Thames Estuary]], downstream of the main center of population. Six main interceptor sewers, totaling almost 100 miles (160&amp;nbsp;km) in length, were constructed, some incorporating stretches of [[Subterranean rivers of London|London's 'lost' rivers]]. Three of these sewers were north of the river, the southernmost, low-level one being incorporated in the [[Thames Embankment]]. The Embankment also allowed new roads, new public gardens, and the [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle Line]] of the [[London Underground]].

The intercepting sewers, constructed between 1859 and 1865, were fed by 450 miles (720&amp;nbsp;km) of main sewers that, in turn, conveyed the contents of some 13,000 miles (21,000&amp;nbsp;km) of smaller local sewers. Construction of the interceptor system required 318 million bricks, 2.7 million cubic metres of excavated earth and 670,000 cubic metres of [[concrete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=European Cities and Technology|last=Goodman|first=David C.|last2=Chant|first2=Colin|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=9780415200790|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gravity]] allowed the sewage to flow eastwards, but in places such as [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], [[Deptford]] and [[Abbey Mills Pumping Station|Abbey Mills]], pumping stations were built to raise the water and provide sufficient flow. Sewers north of the Thames feed into the [[Northern Outfall Sewer]], which fed into a major treatment works at [[Beckton]]. South of the river, the [[Southern Outfall Sewer]] extended to a similar facility at [[Crossness Pumping Station|Crossness]]. With only minor modifications, Bazalgette's engineering achievement remains the basis for sewerage design up into the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0gBwjLTUzEMC|title=100 Greatest Science Inventions of All Time|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|year=2006|pages=148–149|author=Kendall F. Haven|isbn=9781591582649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Merthyr Tydfil]], a large town in [[South Wales]], most houses discharged their sewage to individual [[cess-pit]]s which persistently overflowed causing the pavements to be awash with foul sewage.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Principal Officer of Health, Glamorgan County Council, 1889&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Paris, France ====
{{Main article|Paris_sewers#History}}
In 1802 [[Napoleon]] built the [[Ourcq canal]] which brought 70,000 cubic meters of water a day to Paris, while the [[Seine]] river received up to 100,000 cubic meters of wastewater per day. The Paris cholera epidemic of 1832 sharpened the public awareness of the necessity for some sort of drainage system to deal with sewage and wastewater in a better and healthier way. Between 1865 and 1920 Eugene Belgrand lead the development of a large scale system for water supply and wastewater management. Between these years approximately 600 kilometers of aqueducts were built to bring in potable spring water, which freed the poor quality water to be used for flushing streets and sewers. By 1894 laws were passed which made drainage mandatory. The treatment of Paris sewage, though, was left to natural devices as 5,000 hectares of land were used to spread the waste out to be naturally purified. Further, the lack of sewage treatment left Parisian sewage pollution to become concentrated downstream in the town of Clichy, effectively forcing residents to pack up and move elsewhere.&lt;ref name="George Commair 2009"/&gt;

The 19th century brick-vaulted [[Paris sewers]] serve as a tourist attraction nowadays.

The first comprehensive sewer system in a German city was built in [[Hamburg, Germany]] in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name="Metcalf 19142"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g5cJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=American Sewerage Practice|last2=Eddy|first2=Harrison P.|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1914|isbn=|location=New York|page=|pages=|last1=Metcalf|first1=Leonard|authorlink=|accessdate=}} Vol. I: Design of Sewers.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref name="Burian2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burian|first=Steven J.|last2=Nix|first2=Stephan J.|last3=Pitt|first3=Robert E.|last4=Durrans|first4=S.

In 1863, work began on the construction of a modern sewerage system for the rapidly growing city of [[Frankfurt am Main]], based on design work by  [[William Lindley]]. 20 years after the system's completion, the [[death rate]] from [[typhoid]] had fallen from 80 to 10 per 100,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Metcalf 19142" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burian2" /&gt;{{rp|43}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DNBSupp|wstitle=Lindley, William}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Memphis sewers 1880.jpg|thumb|Map of the sewer system of [[Memphis, Tennessee]] in 1880]]
==== USA ====
The first sewer systems in the United States were built in the late 1850s in [[Chicago]] and [[Brooklyn]].&lt;ref name="Burian2" /&gt;{{rp|43}}

In the United States, the first sewage treatment plant using [[Precipitation (chemistry)|chemical precipitation]] was built in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] in 1890.&lt;ref name="Metcalf 19142" /&gt;{{rp|29}}

=== Sewage treatment plants ===
At the end of the 19th century, since primary treatment still left odor problems, it was discovered that bad odors could be prevented by introducing oxygen into the decomposing sewage. This was the beginning of the biological aerobic and anaerobic treatments which are fundamental to wastewater processes.

As [[Water pollution|pollution]] of water bodies became a concern, cities attempted to treat the sewage before discharge.{{sfn|Abellán|2017|p=12-13}} In the late 19th century some cities began to add chemical treatment and [[Sewage treatment#Primary treatment|sedimentation]] systems to their sewers.&lt;ref name="Metcalf 19142" /&gt;{{rp|28}} In the United States, the first sewage treatment plant using [[Precipitation (chemistry)|chemical precipitation]] was built in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] in 1890.&lt;ref name="Metcalf 19142" /&gt;{{rp|29}} Most cities in the Western world added more expensive systems for [[sewage treatment]] in the early 20th century, after scientists at the [[University of Manchester]] discovered the sewage treatment process of [[activated sludge]] in 1912.&lt;ref name="Benidickson, Jamie 2011" /&gt; During the half-century around 1900, these [[public health]] interventions succeeded in drastically reducing the incidence of water-borne diseases among the urban population, and were an important cause in the increases of [[life expectancy]] experienced at the time.&lt;ref name="nber.org" /&gt;

=== Toilets ===
{{Further information|Toilet#History}}
With the onset of the industrial revolution and related advances in technology, the [[flush toilet]] began to emerge into its modern form. It needs to be connected to a [[Sanitary sewer|sewer system]] though. Where this is not feasible or desired, [[dry toilet]]s are an alternative option.

===Water supply===
[[File:Chelsea Waterworks 1752.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Chelsea Waterworks Company|Chelsea Waterworks]], 1752. Two Newcomen beam engines pumped Thames water from a canal to reservoirs at [[Green Park]] and [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]].]]
An ambitious engineering project to bring fresh water from [[Hertfordshire]] to [[London]] was undertaken by [[Hugh Myddleton]], who oversaw the construction of the [[New River (England)|New River]] between 1609 and 1613. The [[New River Company]] became one of the largest private water companies of the time, supplying the [[City of London]] and other central areas.&lt;ref name="waterhistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waterhistory.org/histories/london/ |title=Water-related Infrastructure in Medieval London |publisher=waterhistory.org |accessdate=2007-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in the 18th century that a rapidly growing population fueled a boom in the establishment of private water supply networks in [[London water supply infrastructure|London]]. The [[Chelsea Waterworks Company]] was established in 1723 "for the better supplying the [[City of Westminster|City]] and [[Liberty of Westminster|Liberties]] of [[Westminster]] and parts adjacent with water".&lt;ref name="London Encyclopaedia"&gt;''The London Encyclopaedia'', Ben Weinreb &amp; Christopher Hibbert, Macmillan, 1995, {{ISBN|0-333-57688-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/page44.asp Royal Charters, Privy Council website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824225331/http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/page44.asp |date=2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company created extensive ponds in the area bordering [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] and [[Pimlico]] using water from the [[Tideway|tidal Thames]]. Other waterworks were established in London, including at [[West Ham]] in 1743, at [[Lea Bridge]] before 1767, [[Lambeth Waterworks Company]] in 1785, [[West Middlesex Waterworks Company]] in 1806&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/1859map/westmiddlesex_waterworks_a2.html UCLA Department of Epidemiology ''West Middlesex Waterworks history'']&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Grand Junction Waterworks Company]] in 1811.&lt;ref name="ph.ucla.edu"&gt;[http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/1859map/lambeth_waterworks_a2.html UCLA Department of Epidemiology ''Lambeth Waterwork history'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[trap (plumbing)|S-bend]] [[pipe (material)|pipe]] was invented by [[Alexander Cummings]] in 1775 but became known as the U-bend following the introduction of the U-shaped trap by [[Thomas Crapper]] in 1880. The first screw-down [[Tap (valve)|water tap]] was patented in 1845 by Guest and Chrimes, a brass foundry in [[Rotherham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plumber.whangarei.biz/a-little-about-tap-history/|title=A Little About Tap History|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water treatment===
Founders of [[microscopy]], [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] and [[Robert Hooke]], used the newly invented [[microscope]] to observe for the first time small material particles that were suspended in the water, laying the groundwork for the future understanding of waterborne pathogens and [[waterborne diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyofwaterfilters.com/microscope-in-water.html|title=The Use of the Microscope in Water Filter History|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sand filter====
[[File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Original map by [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] showing the [[Cluster (epidemiology)|clusters]] of [[cholera]] cases in the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak|London epidemic of 1854]].]]
Sir [[Francis Bacon]] attempted to [[desalination|desalinate]] sea water by passing the flow through a [[sand filter]]. Although his experiment didn't succeed, it marked the beginning of a new interest in the field.

The first documented use of [[sand filter]]s to purify the water supply dates to 1804, when the owner of a bleachery in [[Paisley, Scotland]], John Gibb, installed an experimental filter, selling his unwanted surplus to the public.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/ssf2.pdf|title=Filtration of water supplies|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buchan, James. (2003). Crowded with genius: the Scottish enlightenment: Edinburgh's moment of the mind. New York: Harper Collins.&lt;/ref&gt; This method was refined in the following two decades by engineers working for private water companies, and it culminated in the first treated public water supply in the world, installed by engineer [[James Simpson (engineer)|James Simpson]] for the [[Chelsea Waterworks Company]] in London in 1829.&lt;ref name="History of the Chelsea Waterworks"&gt;[http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/1859map/chelsea_waterworks_a2.html History of the Chelsea Waterworks]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christman, Keith. (1998). The history of chlorine. Waterworld, 14 (8), 66-67.&lt;/ref&gt; This installation provided filtered water for every resident of the area, and the network design was widely copied throughout the [[United Kingdom]] in the ensuing decades.

The practice of water treatment soon became mainstream, and the virtues of the system were made starkly apparent after the investigations of the physician [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] during the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]]. Snow was sceptical of the then-dominant [[miasma theory]] that stated that diseases were caused by noxious "bad airs". Although the [[germ theory of disease]] had not yet been developed, Snow's observations led him to discount the prevailing theory. His 1855 essay ''On the Mode of Communication of Cholera'' conclusively demonstrated the role of the water supply in spreading the cholera epidemic in [[Soho]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t1exE1cfKXIC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=%22institut+de+france%22+and+%22john+snow%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=4Kx7TNabHdOeOM_xgdQG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22institut%20de%20france%22%20and%20%22john%20snow%22&amp;f=false ''Concepts and practice of humanitarian medicine'' (2008) Par S. William Gunn, M. Masellis] {{ISBN|0-387-72263-7}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=NSHXLkgFBBQC&amp;pg=PA290&amp;dq=%22institut+de+france%22+and+snow&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=0Kd7TLfkGMSOOIrs2a4P&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBA]&lt;/ref&gt; with the use of a [[dot distribution map]] and statistical proof to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases. His data convinced the local council to disable the water pump, which promptly ended the outbreak.

The [[Metropolis Water Act 1852|Metropolis Water Act]] introduced the regulation of the [[water supply]] companies in [[London]], including minimum standards of water quality for the first time. The Act "made provision for securing the supply to the Metropolis of pure and wholesome water", and required that all water be "effectually filtered" from 31 December 1855.&lt;ref&gt;''An Act to make better Provision respecting the Supply of Water to the Metropolis'', (15 &amp; 16 Vict. C.84)&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed up with legislation for the mandatory inspection of water quality, including comprehensive chemical analyses, in 1858. This legislation set a worldwide precedent for similar state public health interventions across [[Europe]]. The [[Metropolitan Commission of Sewers]] was formed at the same time, water filtration was adopted throughout the country, and new water intakes on the [[Thames]] were established above [[Teddington Lock]]. Automatic pressure filters, where the water is forced under pressure through the filtration system, were innovated in 1899 in England.&lt;ref name="WHO" /&gt;

====Water chlorination====
In what may have been one of the first attempts to use chlorine, William Soper used chlorinated lime to treat the sewage produced by [[typhoid]] patients in 1879.

In a paper published in 1894, [[Moritz Traube]] formally proposed the addition of chloride of lime ([[calcium hypochlorite]]) to water to render it "germ-free."  Two other investigators confirmed Traube’s findings and published their papers in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Turneaure, F.E. |author2=H.L. Russell | year = 1901 | title = Public Water-Supplies:  Requirements, Resources, and the Construction of Works | edition = 1st | location = New York | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | page = 493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early attempts at implementing water chlorination at a water treatment plant were made in 1893 in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]] and in 1897 the city of [[Maidstone]] [[England]] was the first to have its entire water supply treated with chlorine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Typhoid Epidemic at Maidstone|date=October 1897|journal=Journal of the Sanitary Institute|volume=18|page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Permanent water chlorination began in 1905, when a faulty [[slow sand filter]] and a contaminated water supply led to a serious typhoid fever epidemic in [[Lincoln, England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icis.com/Articles/2008/08/25/9150211/chlorine-cleans-water-for-millions-but-comes-under-attack-after-health.html|title=A miracle for public health?|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Alexander Cruickshank Houston used chlorination of the water to stem the epidemic. His installation fed a concentrated solution of chloride of lime to the water being treated. The chlorination of the water supply helped stop the epidemic and as a precaution, the chlorination was continued until 1911 when a new water supply was instituted.&lt;ref&gt;Reece, R.J. (1907). "Report on the Epidemic of Enteric Fever in the City of Lincoln, 1904-5." In the Thirty-Fifth Annual Report of the Local Government Board, 1905-6:  Supplement Containing the Report of the Medical Officer for 1905-6. London:Local Government Board.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manual Control Chlorinator.jpg|300px|thumb|Manual Control Chlorinator for the liquefaction of chlorine for water purification, early 20th century. From ''Chlorination of Water'' by Joseph Race, 1918.]]
The first continuous use of chlorine in the [[United States]] for disinfection took place in 1908 at Boonton Reservoir (on the [[Rockaway River]]), which served as the supply for [[Jersey City, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Leal, John L. (1909). "The Sterilization Plant of the Jersey City Water Supply Company at Boonton, N.J." ''Proceedings'' American Water Works Association. pp. 100-9.&lt;/ref&gt;   Chlorination was achieved by controlled additions of dilute solutions of chloride of lime ([[calcium hypochlorite]]) at doses of 0.2 to 0.35 ppm.  The treatment process was conceived by Dr. John L. Leal and the chlorination plant was designed by [[George W. Fuller|George Warren Fuller.]]&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, George W. (1909). "Description of the Process and Plant of the Jersey City Water Supply Company for the Sterilization of the Water of the Boonton Reservoir." ''Proceedings'' AWWA. pp. 110-34.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the next few years, chlorine disinfection using chloride of lime were rapidly installed in drinking water systems around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hazen, Allen. (1916). ''Clean Water and How to Get It.'' New York:Wiley. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique of purification of drinking water by use of compressed liquefied chlorine gas was developed by a British officer in the [[Indian Medical Service]], Vincent B. Nesfield, in 1903. According to his own account, "It occurred to me that chlorine gas might be found satisfactory ... if suitable means could be found for using it.... The next important question was how to render the gas portable. This might be accomplished in two ways: By liquefying it, and storing it in lead-lined iron vessels, having a jet with a very fine capillary canal, and fitted with a tap or a screw cap. The tap is turned on, and the cylinder placed in the amount of water required. The chlorine bubbles out, and in ten to fifteen minutes the water is absolutely safe. This method would be of use on a large scale, as for service water carts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= V. B. Nesfield|title=A Chemical Method of Sterilizing Water Without Affecting its Potability|url=http://www.publichealthjrnl.com/article/S0033-3506%2802%2980142-1/abstract|journal=Public Health|year=1902|pages=601–3|doi=10.1016/s0033-3506(02)80142-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[U.S. Army]] [[Major]] [[Carl Rogers Darnall]], Professor of Chemistry at the [[Army Medical School]], gave the first practical demonstration of this in 1910. Shortly thereafter, Major William J. L. Lyster of the [[Army Medical Department (United States)|Army Medical Department]] used a solution of [[calcium hypochlorite]] in a linen bag to treat water. For many decades, Lyster's method remained the standard for U.S. ground forces in the field and in camps, implemented in the form of the familiar Lyster Bag (also spelled Lister Bag). This work became the basis for present day systems of municipal water ''purification''.

====Fluoridation====
{{Further information|History of water fluoridation}}
[[Water fluoridation]] is a practice that has been carried out since the early 20th century for the purpose of decreasing [[tooth decay]].

==Today (21st century and beyond)==

Decentralization of water infrastructure has grown extensively as a viable solution including [[rainwater harvesting]] and [[stormwater harvesting]] where policies are eventually tending towards a more rational use and sourcing of water incorporation concepts such as "Fit for Purpose".

The [[Sustainable Development Goals]] formulated in 2015 include targets on access to water supply and sanitation at a global level.

During the beginning of the 21st century, especially in areas of urban and suburban population centers, traditional centralized infrastructure has not been able to supply sufficient quantities of water to keep up with growing demand. One option is the use of [[desalination]] technology; this is especially prevalent in coastal areas and in "dry" countries like [[List of desalination plants in Australia|Australia]].

'''''In vitro'' [[toxicology testing|toxicity testing]]''' is the [[scientific]] [[Scientific method|analysis]] of the effects of [[toxic]] [[chemical substance]]s on cultured [[bacteria]] or [[mammalian]] [[cell (biology)|cells]].  ''[[In vitro]]'' (literally 'in glass') testing methods are employed primarily to identify potentially hazardous chemicals and/or to confirm the lack of certain toxic properties in the early stages of the development of potentially useful new substances such as therapeutic [[Medication|drugs]], [[agricultural]] chemicals and food additives.

''In vitro'' assays for xenobiotic toxicity are recently carefully considered by key government agencies (e.g. EPA; NIEHS/NTP; FDA), to better assess human risks.  There are substantial activities in using in vitro systems to advance mechanistic understanding of toxicant activities, and the use of human cells and tissue to define human-specific toxic effects.&lt;ref&gt;

==Improvement over animal testing==

Most toxicologists believe that ''in vitro'' toxicity testing methods can be more useful, more time and cost-effective than toxicology studies in living animals (which are termed ''in vivo'' or "in life" methods). However, the [[In vitro to in vivo extrapolation|extrapolation from ''in vitro'' to ''in vivo'']] requires some careful consideration and is an active research area.

Due to regulatory constraints and ethical considerations, the quest for alternatives to animal testing has gained a new momentum. In many cases the in vitro tests are better than animal tests because they can be used to develop safer products.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:Microtiter plate.JPG|thumb|A 96-well [[microtiter plate]] being used for ELISA.]]

==Example cell viability (cytotoxicity) assays used for ''in-vitro'' toxicology==
Many methods of analysis exist for [[assay]]ing test substances for cytotoxicity and other cellular responses.

===MTT===
MTT assay is used often in determining cell [[Viability assay|viability]] and has been validated for use by international organisations.  MTT assay involves two steps of introducing the assay to the chemicals and then a solubilisation step.

===MTS===
The [[colorimetric]] MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2Htetrazolium) in vitro assay is an updated version of the validated MTT method, MTS assay has the advantage of being soluble. Hence, no solubilisation step is required.

===ATP===
[[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] assay has the main advantage of providing results quickly (within 15 minutes) and only requires fewer sample cells.  The assay performs lysis on the cells and the following chemical reaction between the assay and ATP content of cells produces luminescence.  The amount of luminescence is then measured by a photometer and can be translated into number cells alive since
*ATP assay assumes alive cells still have ATP inside them, and
*Luminescence level recorded is proportional to the ATP content in the sample cells.

===Neutral Red===
Another cell viability endpoint can be [[Neutral Red]] (NR) uptake.  Neutral Red, a weak cationic dye penetrates cellular membranes by non-diffusion and accumulates intercelluarly in lysosomes.  Viable cells take up the NR dye, damaged or dead cells do not.

===Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)===
[[ELISA]] kits can be used to examine up and down regulation of proinflammatory mediators such as cytokines (IL-1, TNF alpha, PGE2)....

Measurement of these types of cellular responses can be windows into the interaction of the test article on the test models (monolayer cell cultures, 3D tissue models, tissue explants).

== Types of ''in vitro'' studies ==
Broadly speaking, there are two different types of ''in vitro'' studies depending on the type system developed to perform the experiment. The two types of systems generally used are : a) Static well plate system and b) the multi-compartmental perfused systems.

=== Static well plate system ===
The static well plate or layer systems are the most traditional and simplest form of assays widely used for in vitro study. These assays are quite beneficial as they are quite simple and provide a very accessible testing environment for monitoring chemicals in the culture medium as well as in the cell. However the disadvantage of using these simple static well plate assays is that, they cannot represent the cellular interactions and physiologic fluid flow conditions taking place inside the body.

=== Multi-compartmental perfused systems ===
New testing platforms are now developed to solve problems related to cellular interactions. These new platforms are much more complex based on multi-compartmental perfused systems.&lt;ref&gt;

|issue=2-3
|pages=143–148
|doi=10.1016/j.bej.2003.09.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The main objective of these systems is  to reproduce in vivo mechanisms more reliably by providing cell culture environment close to the in vivo situation. Each compartment in the system represent a specific organ of the living organism and thus each compartment has a specific characteristics and criteria. Each compartment in these systems are connected by tubes and pumps through which the fluid flows thus mimicking the blood flow in the in vivo situation. The draw back behind the use of these perfused systems is that, the adverse effects ( influence of both the biological and non-biological components of the system on the fate of the chemical under study) are more compared to the static systems. In order to reduce the effect of non-biological components of the system, all the compartments are made of glass and the connecting tubes are made up of teflon. A number of kinetic models have been proposed to take care of these non-specific bindings taking place in these in vitro systems.&lt;ref&gt;

To improve the biological difficulties arising from the use of different culture in vitro conditions, the traditional models used in flasks or micro-well plates has to be modified. With parallel development in micro-technologies and tissue engineering, these problems are solved using new pertinent tools called "micro-fluidic biochips".&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Lempel-Ziv complexity''' was first presented in the article ''On the Complexity of Finite Sequences'' (IEEE Trans. On IT-22,1 1976), by two Israeli computer scientists, [[Abraham Lempel]] and [[Jacob Ziv]]. This complexity measure is related to [[Kolmogorov complexity]], but the only function it uses is the recursive copy (i.e., the shallow copy).

The underlying mechanism in this complexity measure is the starting point for some algorithms for [[lossless data compression]], like [[LZ77 and LZ78|LZ77, LZ78]] and [[Lempel–Ziv–Welch|LZW]]. Even though it is based on an elementary principle of words copying, this complexity measure is not too restrictive in the sense that it satisfies the main qualities expected by such a measure: sequences with a certain regularity do not have a too large complexity, and the complexity grows as the sequence grows in length and irregularity.

The Lempel-Ziv complexity can be used to measure the repetitiveness of binary sequences and text, like song lyrics or prose.

== Principle ==
Let S be a binary sequence, of length n, for which we have to compute the Lempel-Ziv complexity, denoted C(S). The sequence is read from the left.

Imagine you have a delimiting line, which can be moved in the sequence during the calculation. At first, this line is set just after the first symbol, at the beginning of the sequence. This initial position is called position 1, from where we have to move it to a position 2, which is considered the initial position for the next step (and so on). We have to move the delimiter (starting in position 1) the further possible to the right, so that the sub-word between position 1 and the delimiter position be a word of the sequence that starts before the position 1 of the delimiter.

As soon as the delimiter is set on a position where this condition is not met, we stop, move the delimiter to this position, and start again by marking this position as a new initial position (i.e., position 1). Keep iterating until the end of the sequence. The Lempel-Ziv complexity corresponds to the number of iterations needed to finish this procedure.

Said differently, the Lempel-Ziv complexity is the number of different sub-strings (or sub-words) encountered as the binary sequence is viewed as a stream (from left to right).

== Formal explanations ==
The method proposed by Lempel and Ziv uses three notions: reproducibility, producibility and exhaustive history of a sequence, that we defined here.

=== Notations ===
Let S be a binary sequence of length n (i.e., n symbols taking value 0 or 1). Let S(i,j), with &lt;math&gt;1\leq i,j\leq n&lt;/math&gt;, be the sub-word of S from index i to index j (if j&lt;i, S(i,j) is the empty string). The length n of S is denoted l(S), and a sequence Q is said to be a fixed prefix of S if:

&lt;math&gt;\exists j&lt;{\text{l(S), s.t. S(1,j) = Q .}}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Reproducibility and producibility ===
&lt;imagemap&gt;Image:Reproductibilité1.svg|200px|thumb|Example of reproducibility [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Reproductibilit%C3%A91.svg Click here] &lt;/imagemap&gt;

On the one hand, a sequence S of length n is said to be reproducible from its prefix S(1,j) when S(j+1,n) is a sub-word of S(1,n-1). This is denoted S(1,j)→S.

Said differently, S is reproducible from its prefix S(1,j) if the rest of the sequence, S(j+1,n), is nothing but a copy of another sub-word (starting at an index i &lt; j+1) of S(1,n-1).

To prove that the sequence S can be reproduced by one of its prefix S(1,j), you have to show that:

&lt;math&gt;\exists p\leq j, {\text{ s.t.  }}S(j+1,n)=S(p,l(S(j+1,n))+p-1)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;imagemap&gt;Image:Productibilité.svg|200px|thumb|Example of Productibility [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Productibilit%C3%A9.svg Click here] &lt;/imagemap&gt;

On the other hand, the producibility, is defined from the reproducibility : a sequence S is producible from its prefix S(1,j) if S(1,n-1) is reproducible from S(1,j). This is denoted S(1,j)⇒S. Said differently, S(j+1,n-1) has to be a copy of another sub-word of S(1,n-2). The last symbol of S can be a new symbol (but could not be), possibly leading to the production of a new sub-word (hence the term producibility).

&lt;imagemap&gt;Image:Prod_reprod1.svg|200px|thumb|Comparison between reproducibility and producibility [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Prod_reprod1.svg Click here] &lt;/imagemap&gt;

=== Exhaustive history and complexity ===
From the definition of productibility, the empty string Λ=S(1,0) ⇒ S(1,1). So by a recursive production process, at step i we have S(1,hi) ⇒ S(1,hi+1), so we can build S from its prefixes. And as S(1,i) ⇒ S(1,i+1) (with hi+1 =hi + 1) is always true, this production process of S takes at most n=l(S) steps. Let m, &lt;math&gt;1\leq {\text{m}}\leq l(S)&lt;/math&gt;, be the number of steps necessary for this product process of S. S can be written in a decomposed form, called history of S, and denoted H(S), defined like this:

&lt;math&gt;H(S)=S(1,h_{1})S(h_{1}+1,h_{2})\dotsm S(h_{{m-1}}+1,h_{m})&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;H_{i}(S)=S(h_{{i-1}}+1,h_{i}),i=1,2\dotsm m,
{\text{where}  }\; h_{0}=0,h_{1}=1,h_{m}=l(S),{\text{ is called component of } H(S)}.
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;imagemap&gt;Image:Hist_exh&amp;complexite1.svg|200px|thumb|Comparison between reproductibility and productibility [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Hist_exh%26complexite1.svg Click here] &lt;/imagemap&gt;

A component of S, Hi(S), is said to be exhaustive if S(1,hi) is the longest sequence produced by S(1,hi-1) (i.e., S(1,hi-1) ⇒ S(1,hi)) but so that S(1,hi-1) does not produce S(1,hi) (denoted ).&lt;math&gt;S(1,h_{i}-1)\nrightarrow S(1,h_{i})&lt;/math&gt; The index p which allows to have the longest production is called pointer.

The history of S is said to be exhaustive if all its component are exhaustive, except possibly the last one. From the definition, one can show that any sequence S has only one exhaustive history, and this history is the one with the smallest number of component from all the possible histories of S. Finally, the number of component of this unique exhaustive history of S is called the Lempel-Ziv complexity of S.

== Algorithm ==
Hopefully, there exists a very efficient method for computing this complexity, in a linear number of operation (&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(n)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n=l(S)&lt;/math&gt; length of the sequence S).

A formal description of this method is given by the following [[algorithm]]:
* i = p - 1, p is the pointer (see above)
* u is the length of the current prefix
* v is the length of the current component for the current pointer p
* vmax is the final length used for the current component (largest on all the possible pointers p)
* and C is the Lempel-Ziv Complexity, incremented iteratively.

&lt;syntaxhighlight line lang="pascal"&gt;
// S is a binary sequence of size n
i := 0
C := 1
u := 1
v := 1
vmax := v
while u + v &lt;= n do
   if S[i + v] = S[u + v] then
      v := v + 1
   else
      vmax := max(v, vmax)
      i := i + 1
      if i = u then  // all the pointers have been treated
         C := C + 1
         u := u + vmax
         v := 1
         i := 0
         vmax := v
      else
         v := 1
      end if
   end if
end while
if v != 1 then
    C := C+1
end si
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Transformation of [[three phase]] electrical quantities to two phase quantities is a usual practice to simplify analysis of three phase electrical circuits. Polyphase a.c machines can be represented by an equivalent two phase model provided the rotating polyphases winding in rotor and the stationary polyphase windings in stator can be expressed in a fictitious two axes coils. The process of replacing one set of variables to another related set of variable is called winding transformation or simply transformation or linear transformation. The term linear transformation means that the transformation from old to new set of variable and vice versa is governed by linear equations.&lt;ref&gt;P.S. Bimbhra, Generalised Theory of Electrical Machines, Khanna Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;
The equations relating old variables and new variables are called transformation equation and the following general form:
                [new Variable] = [transformation matrix][old variable]
                [old Variable] = [transformation matrix][new variable]
Transformation matrix is a matrix containing the coefficients that relates new and old variables. Note that the second transformation matrix in the above-mentioned general form is inverse of first transformation matrix.
''The transformation matrix should account for power invariance in the two frames of reference. In case power invariance is not maintained, then torque calculation should be from original machine variables only.''

==Benefits of transformation==

Linear transformation in rotating machines is generally carried out for the purpose of obtaining new sets of equations governing the machine model that are fewer in number and less complex in nature compared to original machine model. When referred to new frame of reference performance analysis of machine becomes much simpler, smoother and faster. All machine quantities like voltage, current, power, torque, speed etc. can be solved in the transformed model in a less laborious way without losing originality of machine properties.
''The most striking feature of transformation, which accounts for its high popularity, is that time varying inductances in voltage and current equations of machine are eliminated.''

==Popular Transformation techniques==

Two most widely used transformation methods are dqo (or qdo or odq or simply d-q) transformation and αβϒ (or α-β) transformation. In d-q transformation the three phase quantities of machine in the abc reference frame is referred to d-q reference frame. Transformation equation has the general form [F&lt;sub&gt;dqo&lt;/sub&gt;] = [K][F&lt;sub&gt;abc&lt;/sub&gt;], where K is the transformation matrix, for detail refer [[Dqo transformation]]. The d-q reference frame may be stationary or rotating at certain angular speed. Based on speed of reference frame there are four major type of reference frame.
For detail on abc to αβ transformation refer [[αβγ transform]]

==Commonly used reference frames==

Based on speed of reference frame there are four major type of reference frame.&lt;ref&gt;P.C. Krause,O. Wasynczuk, S. D. Sudhoff, Analysis of Electric Machinery and Drives System, Second edition&lt;/ref&gt;

	
* '''Arbitrary reference frame''': Reference frame speed is unspecifie(ω), variables denoted by f&lt;sub&gt;dqos&lt;/sub&gt;  or f&lt;sub&gt;ds&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;qs&lt;/sub&gt; and f&lt;sub&gt;os&lt;/sub&gt;, transformation matrix denoted by K&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;.
* 	'''Stationary reference frame''': Reference frame speed is zero(ω=0), variables denoted by f&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;dqo&lt;/sub&gt; or f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; and f&lt;sub&gt;os&lt;/sub&gt;, transformation matrix denoted by K&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;.
* 	'''Rotor reference frame''': Reference frame speed is equal to rotor speed(ω= ω&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;), variables denoted by f&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;dqo&lt;/sub&gt; or f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;, f&lt;sup&gt;q&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt; and f&lt;sub&gt;os&lt;/sub&gt;, transformation matrix denoted by K&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;.
* 	'''Synchronous reference frame''': Reference frame speed is equal to synchronous speed(ω= ω&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;), variables denoted by f&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;dqo&lt;/sub&gt; or f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; and f&lt;sub&gt;os&lt;/sub&gt;, transformation matrix denoted by K&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;.
The choice of reference frame is not restricted but otherwise deeply influenced by the type of analysis that is to be performed so as to expedite the solution of the system equations or to satisfy system constraints. The best suited choice of reference frame for simulation of induction machine for various cases of analysis are listed here under:&lt;ref&gt;R.J. Lee, P. Pillay and R.G. Harley, " D,Q Reference Frames for simulation of Induction Motors", Electric Power Systems Research, 8(1984/85) 15-26&lt;/ref&gt;
	
* '''''Stationary reference frame''''' is best suited for '''studying stator variables''' only, for example variable speed stator fed IM drives, because stator d-axis variables are exactly identical to stator phase a-variable.
* 	'''''Rotor reference frame''''' is best suited when '''analysis is confined to rotor variables''' as rotor d-axis variable is identical to phase-a rotor variables.
* 	'''''Synchronously rotating reference frame''''' is suitable '''when analog computer is employed''' because both stator and rotor d-q quantities becomes steady DC quantities. It is also best suited for studying '''multi-machine system'''.
''It is worthwhile to note that all three types of reference frame can be obtained from arbitrary reference frame by simply changing ω. Modeling in arbitrary reference frame is therefore beneficial when a wide range of analysis is to be done.
''

==Restrictions==
There are some restrictions in representing a rotating electrical machine by its d-q axes equivalent, as listed below:
	

* This method cannot be used on machine in which both stator and rotor are salient, for example induction alternator.
* This method cannot be applied on machine in which non salient element have unbalanced windings.
* Brush contact phenomena, commutation effects and surge phenomena cannot be represented in this model so they have to be accounted for separately.

The Lloyd Center’s {{convert|55|acre|m2}} of [[estuary]] and maritime forest in South [[Dartmouth, Massachusetts]], was donated to the Dartmouth Natural Resources Trust in 1978 by Karen Lloyd as a living memorial to her mother, Katharine Nordell Lloyd. Lloyd Center programming began in 1981.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lloydcenter.org/history/ |title=History |publisher=Lloyd Center for the Environment |accessdate=December 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five walking trails offer scenic views of the [[Slocum River]], [[Buzzards Bay]], [[Demarest Lloyd State Park]], [[Mishaum Point]], and [[Cuttyhunk]] Island.  The [[Chaypee]] Woods Trail snakes its way through stone walls that hearken back to farming days when dairy cattle, ducks, and chickens were raised there.  Steep steps and slopes mix with the vistas of the [[salt marsh]], oak-hickory forest, freshwater [[wetlands]], [[Kettle (geology)|kettleholes]], [[moraine]], and a Native American [[midden]] site.

The Obukhov length is used to describe the effects of buoyancy on turbulent flows, particularly in the lower tenth of the [[atmospheric boundary layer]].  It was first defined by [[Alexander Obukhov]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacobson|first=Mark Z.|title=Fundamentals of Atmospheric Modeling|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WPwEf-1f73wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=2|year=2005|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Obukhov |first1=A.M.|year=1946|title=Turbulence in an atmosphere with a non- uniform temperature.|journal= Tr. Inst. Teor. Geofiz. Akad. Nauk. SSSR|volume=1|pages=95–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Obukhov |first1=A.M.|year=1971|title=Turbulence in an atmosphere with a non-uniform temperature (English Translation)| journal=Boundary-Layer Meteorology|volume=2| pages=7–29|bibcode = 1971BoLMe...2....7O |doi = 10.1007/BF00718085 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as the Monin–Obukhov length because of its important role in the similarity theory developed by [[Andrei Monin|Monin]] and Obukhov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Monin|first1=A.S.|last2=Obukhov |first2=A.M.|year=1954|title=Basic laws of turbulent mixing in the surface layer of the atmosphere.|journal= Tr. Akad. Nauk SSSR Geofiz. Inst|volume=24|pages=163–187}}&lt;/ref&gt; A simple definition of the Monin-Obukhov length is that height at which turbulence is generated more by buoyancy than by wind shear.

The '''Obukhov length''' is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
L = - \frac{u^3_*\bar\theta_v}{kg(\overline {w^'\theta^'_v})_s}\ 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u_*&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Friction velocity|frictional velocity]], &lt;math&gt;\bar\theta_v&lt;/math&gt; is the mean virtual [[potential temperature]], &lt;math&gt;(\overline{w^'\theta^'_v})_s&lt;/math&gt; is the surface virtual potential temperature flux, k is the [[von Kármán constant]]. The virtual potential temperature flux is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\overline {w^'\theta^'_v}=\overline {w^'\theta^'}+0.61\overline{T}\; \overline {w^'q^'}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is potential temperature, &lt;math&gt;\overline{T}&lt;/math&gt; is absolute temperature and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is specific humidity. 


By this definition, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is usually negative in the daytime since &lt;math&gt;\overline {w^'\theta^'_v}&lt;/math&gt; is typically positive during the daytime over land, positive at night when &lt;math&gt;\overline {w^'\theta^'_v}&lt;/math&gt; is typically negative, and becomes infinite at dawn and dusk when &lt;math&gt;\overline {w^'\theta^'_v}&lt;/math&gt; passes through zero.

A physical interpretation of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is given by the [[Monin–Obukhov similarity theory]]. During the day &lt;math&gt;-L&lt;/math&gt; is the height at which the buoyant production of [[turbulence kinetic energy]] (TKE) is equal to that produced by the shearing action of the wind (shear production of TKE).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3430">'''Oak-hickory forest''' is a type of [[North America]]n forest ecosystem, and an [[ecoregion]] of the [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]] [[Biome]].

==Geography==
It has a range extending from [[Rhode Island]] and southern [[New York (state)|New York]], west to [[Iowa]], and south to Northern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Smaller, isolated Oak-Hickory communities can also be found as far west as [[North Dakota]], south in [[Florida]] and in northeast [[Texas]], and north to southern [[Maine]] and [[Ontario]]. 

Dominated by nut-bearing [[oak]] and [[hickory]] species of trees, the Oak-hickory forest has the largest range of any deciduous forest ecosystem in eastern and central North America.

==Natural history==
The current oak-hickory forest includes the former range of the '''Oak-Chestnut Forest''' region, which encompassed the northeast portion of the current oak-hickory range. When the [[American Chestnut]] population succumbed to invasive fungal blight in the early 20th century, those forests shifted to an oak and hickory dominated ecosystem. 

===Biota===
Key indicator tree and shrub species of the oak-hickory forest include [[Quercus rubra|red oak]], [[Quercus velutina|black oak]], [[scarlet oak]], [[white oak]], [[Quercus prinus|Chestnut oak (''Quercus prinus'')]], [[Carya glabra|Pignut hickory (''Carya glabra'')]], [[Carya cordiformis|Bitternut hickory (''Carya cordiformis'')]], [[Carya ovata|Shagbark hickory (''Carya ovata'')]], [[Cornus florida|flowering dogwood (''Cornus florida'')]], [[blueberry]], [[Kalmia latifolia|Mountain laurel (''Kalmia latifolia'')]], and [[Crataegus|hawthorn]].&lt;ref name="biota oak hickory mtu"&gt;{{cite web|title=What Are the Common Plants, Animals, and Insects in the Oak-Hickory Ecosystem?|url=http://techalive.mtu.edu/meec/module11/Oak-HickoryPlantsandAnimals.htm|website=Michigan Environmental Education Curriculum|publisher=[[ Michigan Technological University]]|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bird and animal species include the [[Eastern gray squirrel|gray squirrel]], [[flying squirrel]], [[chipmunk]], [[blue jay]], and [[wild turkey]].&lt;ref name="biota oak hickory mtu"/&gt;

==History==
Operation Icarus was launched in 2013 by West Mercia Police (WMP) following the recovery by the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] (MPS) of several stolen religious artefacts. The MPS had received information from [[HM Revenue and Customs]] relating to the illegal importation of a gorilla's head by an art collector in [[South London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rare artefacts fall prey to mystery church raider|first=Steven|last=Morris|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=21 May 2015|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; When police confronted the collector they also found two 15th century decorative oak panels and a 13th-century stone memorial.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt; The oak panels, depicting [[Victor of Marseilles|St Victor of Marseille]] and [[Margaret the Virgin|St Margaret of Antioch]], were identified as priceless parts of a [[medieval]] [[rood screen]] from Holy Trinity Church, [[Torbryan]], [[Devon]], and had been stolen in August 2013.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Priceless Medieval panels 'hacked' from Torbryan Church have been recovered by police|url=http://www.torquayheraldexpress.co.uk/Priceless-Medieval-panels-hacked-Torbrayn-Church/story-26553642-detail/story.html|first=Ginny|last=Ware|date=22 May 2015|work=[[Herald Express]]|location=Torquay|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fifteenth-century icons stolen from Devon church|first=Maev|last=Kennedy|date=13 August 2013|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/aug/13/15th-century-icons-stolen-devon-church|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stone was identified as a "heart stone" which had marked the place where the [[Bishop of Hereford]] [[John de Breton]]'s heart was interred in the wall of [[Dore Abbey]], [[Golden Valley (Herefordshire)|Golden Valley]], [[Herefordshire]].&lt;ref name=morris/&gt; It had been stolen in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Church effigies targeted by gangs who steal them to order and smuggle artefacts abroad|first=Kerry|last=McDermott|date=11 September 2012|work=[[Daily Mail]]|location=London|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2201586/Church-effigies-targeted-gangs-steal-order-smuggle-artefacts-abroad.html|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the force responsible for Herefordshire, WMP took over and interviewed the collector, widening the investigation to include art dealers and internet sales. The operation discovered that "for at least six years, and more likely for a decade, a person — or persons — had been targeting remote, often unlocked, churches and stripping them of precious artefacts."&lt;ref name=morris/&gt; Searching [[eBay]], police discovered at least one stolen artefact for sale on the internet auction site: a 14th-century stone carving depicting the head of Robert de Wakering, stolen from All Saints Church, [[Newland, Gloucestershire]], in 2012.&lt;ref name="gloucester"&gt;{{cite news|title=Church's stolen statue head found on eBay after two years and returned to Forest of Dean|work=[[Gloucester Citizen]]|location=Gloucester|date=9 June 2015|url=http://www.gloucestercitizen.co.uk/Church-s-stolen-statue-head-ebay-years-returned/story-26663015-detail/story.html|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detective Sergeant Andy Bennett said that while some thieves are "taking pot luck and taking whatever they can steal" others are stealing specific items to order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Theft-to-order threat to historic church treasures|first=John|last=Bingham|date=1 May 2015|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/11641729/Theft-to-order-threat-to-historic-church-treasures.html|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; DI Barnes said that art dealers purchasing stolen artefacts "were not doing enough to ensure that objects were on the market legitimately.... Our general consensus is that their records are woefully inadequate. They say they comply with the law and they probably do — just — but do they turn a blind eye? I would say, yes they do."&lt;ref name=hallett/&gt;

==Recovered artefacts==

Police raids in London, Wales and Kent led to the recovery of around 60 stolen artefacts including stonework, tombstone lids, friezes, statues, paintings, brasses, stained glass panels and 17th-century Bibles.&lt;ref name=gloucester/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sacred haul of thief who raided churches|first=Simon|last=de Bruxelles|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/crime/article4448652.ece|date=23 May 2015|accessdate=28 June 2015|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=10 May 2015|work=[[The Sunday Telegraph]]|location=London|title=Stolen church treasures recovered|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detective Constable Tony Lewis said that by mid-2015 police were holding over 60 recovered items which were still to be identified and may not even have been reported stolen, adding: "Some items are very small and some have been removed from dark corners or high up in walls. As such, the thefts may not have been noticed. In some cases attempts have been made to cover a theft, with a different item placed where the stolen item was taken from."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Collector's tip-off helps police rescue big stash of church relics|date=26 May 2015|first=Tom|last=Derbyshire|work=Antiques Trade Gazette|location=London|url=http://www.antiquestradegazette.com/news/2015/may/26/collectors-tip-off-helps-police-rescue-big-stash-of-church-relics/|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Herefordshire Historic Churches Trust has expressed concerns that some artefacts stolen to order may have already left the country and that while "ownership reverts to the rightful owner in Britain, this is not always the case overseas where a collector who may have bought in good faith can take title."&lt;ref name="hhct"&gt;{{cite news|title=Priceless artifacts recovered|work=Herefordshire Historic Churches Trust|url=http://www.hhct.co.uk/2015/05/20/priceless-artifacts-recovered/|date=20 May 2015|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012 a brass [[eagle lectern]] stolen from Holy Cross Church, [[Ashton Keynes]], [[Wiltshire]], was found on sale at an antiques fair in [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brass lectern stolen from Wiltshire church turns up at Romanian antique fair|first=Donna|last=Bowater|date=8 January 2012|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9000914/Brass-lectern-stolen-from-Wiltshire-church-turns-up-at-Romanian-antique-fair.html|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lectern stolen from Wiltshire church spotted in Romania|date=5 January 2012|work=[[BBC News]]|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-16411884|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recovered objects that have been identified and returned to churches by the operation include a 13th-century stone effigy of a knight, stolen from St Michael's Church, Castle Frome, Herefordshire; [[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Saxon]] stonework stolen from St David's Church, [[Much Dewchurch]], Herefordshire; and a set of 15th-century [[misericord]]s stolen from [[St Cuthbert's Church, Holme Lacy]], Herefordshire.&lt;ref name=hhct/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police recover stolen church treasure feared lost for ever|first=Simon|last=de Bruxelles|date=20 May 2015|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/faith/article4445453.ece|accessdate=29 June 2015|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The misericords were reportedly stolen for sale to collectors in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stolen Church Relics Returned One Year Later|work=[[Sunday Mercury]]|location=Birmingham|date=10 May 2015|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-412893973/stolen-church-relics-returned-one-year-later|accessdate=30 June 2015|via=[[Questia Online Library]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following an appeal to the public a 13th-century carved stone head was identified as one stolen from Holy Cross Church in [[Moreton Morrell]], Warwickshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police trace stolen sculpture to Moreton Morrell|date=10 July 2015|accessdate=10 July 2015|url=http://www.leamingtoncourier.co.uk/news/local-news/police-trace-stolen-sculpture-to-moreton-morrell-1-6843291|work=The Courier|location=Leamington Spa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecutions==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9045">'''Project engineering''' includes all parts of the design of manufacturing or processing facilities, either new or modifications to and expansions of existing facilities.  A "project" consists of a coordinated series of activities or tasks performed by engineers, designers, [[drafter]]s and others from one or more engineering disciplines or departments.  Project tasks consist of such things as performing calculations, writing specifications, preparing bids, reviewing equipment proposals and evaluating or selecting equipment and preparing various lists, such as equipment and materials lists, and creating drawings such as electrical, [[piping and instrumentation diagram]]s, physical layouts and other drawings used in design and construction. A small project may be under the direction of a project engineer. Large projects are typically under the direction of a [[project manager]] or management team.  Some facilities have in house staff to handle small projects, while some major companies have a department that does internal project engineering. Large projects are typically contracted out to engineering companies.  Staffing at engineering companies varies according to the work load and duration of employment may only last until an individual's tasks are completed.

==Overview==

===Responsibilities===
The role of the project engineer can often be described as that of a liaison between the project manager and the technical disciplines involved in a project. The distribution of "liasing" and performing tasks within the technical disciplines can vary wildly from project-to-project.  This often depends on the type of product, it's maturity, and the size of the company, to name a few.  It is important for a Project Engineer to understand that balance.  The Project Engineer should be knowledgeable enough to be able to speak intelligently within the various disciplines, and not purely be a liaison -- such project engineers who only "liaise" can more accurately be characterized as "lazy".  The project engineer is also often the primary technical point of contact for the consumer.

A project engineer's responsibilities include schedule preparation, pre-planning and resource forecasting for engineering and other technical activities relating to the project. They may also be in charge of performance management of [[vendor]]s. They assure the accuracy of financial forecasts, which tie-in to project schedules.  They ensure projects are completed according to project plans. Project engineers manage project team resources and training and develop extensive project management experience and expertise. 

When project teams are structured so that multiple specialty disciplines report to the project engineer, then two important responsibilities of the project engineer are inter-discipline coordination and overall quality control of the work.&lt;ref name=Herbst&gt;{{cite conference |last=Herbst |first=Andrew |author2=Hans Verwijs |title=Project Engineering: Interdisciplinary Coordination and Overall Engineering Quality Control |book-title=Proc. of the Annual IAC conference of the American Society for Engineering Management |date=Oct 19–22, 2011 |volume=1 |isbn=9781618393616 |pages=15–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engineering companies===
When used, an engineering company is generally contracted to design a project to achieve some specific objective, ranging in scope from simple modifications to new factories or expansions costing hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars.  The client usually provides the engineering company with a scoping document listing the details of the objective in terms of such things as production rate and product specifications and general to specific information about processes and equipment to be used and the expected deliverables, such as calculations, drawings, lists, specifications, schedules, etc. The client is typically involved in the entire design process and makes decisions throughout, including the technology, type of equipment to use, bid evaluation and supplier selection, the layout of equipment and operational considerations.  Depending on the project the engineering company may perform material and energy balances to size equipment and to quantify inputs of materials and energy (steam, electric power, fuel). This information is used to write specifications for the equipment.  The equipment specifications are sent out for bids.  The client, the engineering company or both select the equipment.  The equipment suppliers provide drawings of the equipment, which are used by the engineering company's mechanical engineers, designers and [[drafter]]s to make general arrangement drawings, which show how the pieces of equipment are located in relation to other equipment. Layout drawings show specific information about the equipment, electric motors powering the equipment and such things as auxiliary equipment (pumps, fans, air compressors), piping and buildings. The engineering company maintains an equipment list with major equipment, auxiliary equipment, motors, etc. Electrical engineers are involved with power supply to motors and equipment.  Process engineers perform material and energy balances and design the [[piping and instrumentation diagram]]s to show how equipment is supplied with process fluids, water, air, gases, etc. and the type of control loops used.   The instrumentation and controls engineers specify the instrumentation and controls and handle any computer controls and control rooms.  Civil and structural engineers deal with site layout and engineering and structural concerns like foundations, pads, structures, supports and bracing for equipment.  Environmental engineers deal with any air emissions and treatment of liquid effluent.

===Fields and topics===

The various fields and topics that projects engineers are involved with include:

*[[Work breakdown structure]]: a deliverable-oriented breakdown of a project into smaller components
*[[Gantt chart]]:  type of bar chart that illustrates a project schedule
*[[Critical Path Analysis]]: an algorithm for scheduling a set of project activities
*[[Program evaluation and review technique]]: a statistical tool which was designed to analyze and represent the tasks involved in completing a given project
*[[Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique]]: network analysis technique that allows probabilistic treatment both network logic and estimation of activity duration
*[[Petri Nets]]: one of several mathematical modeling languages for the description of distributed systems

==Construction industry==
Project engineers are often project managers with qualifications in engineering or [[construction management]]. Other titles include field engineer, [[Construction engineering|construction engineer]], or construction project engineer. In smaller projects, this person may also be responsible for contracts and will be called an assistant project manager. A similar role is undertaken by a client's engineer or [[owner's engineer]], but by inference, these often act more in the interests of the commissioning company.

Project engineers do not necessarily do [[Design engineer|design]] work, but instead represent the contractor or client out in the field, help [[tradesman|tradespeople]] interpret the job's designs, ensure the job is constructed according to the project plans, and assist [[Cost engineering|project controls]], including budgeting, scheduling, and planning. In some cases a project engineer is responsible for assisting the assigned project manager with regard to design and a project and with the execution of one or more simultaneous projects in accordance with a valid, executed contract, per company policies and procedures and work instructions for customized and standardized plants.

Typical responsibilities may include: daily operations of field work activities and organization of [[subcontractor]]s; coordination of the implementation of a project, ensuring it is being built correctly; project schedules and forecasts; interpretation of drawings for [[tradesmen]]; review of engineering deliverables; redlining drawings; regular project status reports; budget monitoring and trend tracking; bill of materials creation and maintenance; effective communications between engineering, technical, construction, and project controls groups; and assistance to the project manager.

'''Rae Linda Brown''' (1953 &amp;ndash; 2017) was an American [[musicologist]].

As a scholar, archivist and editor Rae Linda Brown conducted research on topics in [[American classical music]], [[Black Music]] and African-American classical music. Brown authored books and academic treatises on [[Florence Price]] and [[William Grant Still]]. As a professor and administrator Brown led in the creation of new academic programs at the [[University of California, Irvine]], [[Loyola Marymount University]], and [[Pacific Lutheran University]].

Brown grew up in Hartford Connecticut and earned degrees at the [[University of Connecticut]] and [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obituary: Rae Linda Brown|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/latimes/obituary.aspx?n=rae-linda-brown&amp;pid=186557965|website=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=23 March 2018|ref=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown's doctoral work at Yale catalogued sheet music and scores in the [[James Weldon Johnson]] memorial collection at the [[Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library]] and comprises Volume 23 of the Garland Critical Studies on Black Life and Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Rae Linda|title=Music, printed and manuscript, in the James Weldon Johnson Memorial Collection of Negro Arts and Letters: an annotated catalog|date=1982|publisher=Garland|isbn=978-0824093198|url=https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780824093198|accessdate=23 March 2018|ref=Dissertation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s Brown rediscovered, edited, and published critical analyses of [[Florence Price]]'s music. Brown's work in this area became the basis for a wider recognition of Price's role in and contribution to American music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Price|first1=Florence|title=Price: Symphonies Nos. 1 and 3|date=2007|publisher=A-R Editions|isbn=978-0-89579-638-7|url=https://www.areditions.com/price-symphonies-nos-1-and-3-mu19-a066.html|accessdate=23 March 2018|ref=Price: Symphonies Nos. 1 and 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Woman's Symphony Orchestra of Chicago and Florence B.

Exposed group has smaller risk of adverse outcome, with RR = 0.5.|thumb|The group exposed to treatment (left) has half the risk (RR = 0.5) of an adverse outcome (black) compared to the unexposed group (right).]]
In [[epidemiology]], '''risk ratio''' (RR) or '''relative risk''' is the ratio of the [[probability]] of an outcome in an exposed group to the probability of an outcome in an unexposed group. It is computed as &lt;math&gt;I_e / I_u&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;I_e&lt;/math&gt; is the incidence in the exposed group, and &lt;math&gt;I_u&lt;/math&gt; is the incidence in the unexposed group.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book | veditors = Porta M | url = http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199976720.001.0001/acref-9780199976720 |title=Dictionary of Epidemiology | edition = 6th | publisher = Oxford University Press |pages=245, 252  | isbn = 978-0-19-939006-9 |doi=10.1093/acref/9780199976720.001.0001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with [[risk difference]] and [[odds ratio]], risk ratio measures the association between the exposure and the outcome.&lt;ref name="pmid14695382"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sistrom CL, Garvan CW | title = Proportions, odds, and risk | journal = Radiology | volume = 230 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–9 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14695382 | doi = 10.1148/radiol.2301031028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistical use and meaning==
Risk ratio is used in the statistical analysis of the data of [[Randomized controlled trial|experimental]], [[Cohort study|cohort]] and [[Cross-sectional study|cross-sectional]] studies, to estimate the strength of the association between treatments or risk factors, and outcome.&lt;ref name="pmid14695382" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Studying a study and testing a test: how to read the medical evidence |last=Riegelman |first=Richard K. | name-list-format = vanc |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-7817-4576-5 |edition=5th |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Philadelphia|pages=389|oclc=56415070}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it is used to compare the risk of an adverse outcome when receiving a medical treatment versus no treatment (or placebo), or when exposed to an environmental risk factor versus not exposed.

Assuming the causal effect between the exposure and the outcome, values of RR can be interpreted as follows:

*RR = 1 means that exposure does not affect the outcome;
*RR &lt;&amp;nbsp;1 means that the risk of the outcome is decreased by the exposure;
*RR &gt;&amp;nbsp;1 means that the risk of the outcome is increased by the exposure.

== Usage in reporting ==
Risk ratio is commonly used to present the results of randomized controlled trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakayama T, Zaman MM, Tanaka H | title = Reporting of attributable and relative risks, 1966-97 | journal = Lancet | volume = 351 | issue = 9110 | pages = 1179 | date = April 1998 | pmid = 9643696 | doi = 10.1016/s0140-6736(05)79123-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be problematic, if risk ratio is presented without the absolute measures, such as [[absolute risk]], or risk difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Noordzij M, van Diepen M, Caskey FC, Jager KJ | title = Relative risk versus absolute risk: one cannot be interpreted without the other | journal = Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation | volume = 32 | issue = suppl_2 | pages = ii13-ii18 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28339913 | doi = 10.1093/ndt/gfw465 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case when the base rate of the outcome is low, large or small values of risk ratio may not translate to significant effect, and the importance of the effect to the public health can be overestimated. Equivalently, in the case when the base rate of the outcome is high, values of the risk ratio close to 1 may still result in a significant effect and can be underestimated. Thus, presentation of both absolute and relative measures is recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moher D, Hopewell S, Schulz KF, Montori V, Gøtzsche PC, Devereaux PJ, Elbourne D, Egger M, Altman DG | title = CONSORT 2010 explanation and elaboration: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials | journal = BMJ | volume = 340 | pages = c869 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20332511 | pmc = 2844943 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.c869 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inference ==
Risk ratio can be estimated from a 2x2 [[contingency table]]:
{| class="wikitable"
! rowspan="2" |&amp;nbsp;
! colspan="2" |Group
|-
! Experimental (E)
![[Scientific control|Control]] (C)
|-
| Events (E)
| EE
| CE
|-
| Non-events (N)
| EN
| CN
|}

The point estimate of the risk ratio is

:&lt;math&gt;RR = \frac{EE/(EE + EN)}{CE/(CE + CN)} = \frac{EE(CE + CN)}{CE(EE + EN)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The sampling distribution of the &lt;math&gt;\log(RR)&lt;/math&gt;is approximately normal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stata.com/support/faqs/stat/2deltameth.html|title=Standard errors, confidence intervals, and significance tests|work=StataCorp LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; with standard error

:&lt;math&gt;SE(\log(RR)) = \sqrt{\frac{EN}{EE(EE + EN)} + \frac{CN}{CE(CE + CN)}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;1 - \alpha&lt;/math&gt; confidence interval for the &lt;math&gt;\log(RR)&lt;/math&gt; is then

:&lt;math&gt;CI_{1 - \alpha}(\log(RR)) = \log(RR)\pm SE(\log(RR))\times z_\alpha,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;z_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the [[standard score]] for the chosen level of [[statistical significance|significance]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1019839414|title=Epidemiology : beyond the basics|last=Szklo|first=Moyses|last2=Nieto|first2=F.

In regression models, the exposure is typically included as a [[dummy variable (statistics)|indicator variable]] along with other factors that may affect risk. The risk ratio is usually reported as calculated for the [[mean]] of the sample values of the explanatory variables.

== Comparison to the odds ratio ==
Risk ratio is different from the [[odds ratio]], although it asymptotically approaches it for small probabilities of outcomes. If EE is substantially smaller than ''EN'', then EE/(EE&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;EN) &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\approx&lt;/math&gt; EE/EN. Similarly, if CE is much smaller than CN, then CE/(CN + CE) &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\approx&lt;/math&gt; CE/CN. Thus, under [[the rare disease assumption]]

:&lt;math&gt; RR = \frac{EE(CE + CN)}{CE(EE + EN)} \approx \frac{EE \cdot CN}{EN \cdot CE} = OR.&lt;/math&gt;

In epidemiological research, the [[odds ratio]] is commonly used for [[case-control study|case-control studies]], as the risk ratio cannot be estimated.&lt;ref name="pmid14695382" /&gt;

In fact, the odds ratio has much broader use in statistics, since [[logistic regression]], often associated with [[clinical trial]]s, works with the log of the odds ratio, not risk ratio. Because the (natural log of the) odds of a record is estimated as a linear function of the explanatory variables, the estimated odds ratio for 70-year-olds and 60-year-olds associated with the type of treatment would be the same in logistic regression models where the outcome is associated with drug and age, although the risk ratio might be significantly different. In cases like this, statistical models of the odds ratio often reflect the underlying mechanisms more efficiently.

Since risk ratio is a more intuitive measure of effectiveness, the distinction is important especially in cases of medium to high probabilities.  If action A carries a risk of 99.9% and action B a risk of 99.0% then the risk ratio is just over 1, while the odds associated with action A are more than 10 times higher than the odds with B.

In statistical modelling, approaches like [[poisson regression]] (for counts of events per unit exposure) have risk ratio interpretations: the estimated effect of an explanatory variable is multiplicative on the rate and thus leads to a risk ratio. [[Logistic regression]] (for binary outcomes, or counts of successes out of a number of trials) must be interpreted in odds-ratio terms: the effect of an explanatory variable is multiplicative on the odds and thus leads to an odds ratio.

== Bayesian interpretation ==

We could assume a disease noted by &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, and no disease noted by &lt;math&gt;\neg D&lt;/math&gt;, exposure noted by &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, and no exposure noted by &lt;math&gt;\neg E&lt;/math&gt;. Risk ratio can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;RR = \frac {P(D\mid E)}{P(D\mid \neg E)} = \frac {P(E\mid D)/P(\neg E\mid D)}{P(E)/P(\neg E)}. &lt;/math&gt;

This way the risk ratio can be interpreted in Bayesian terms as the posterior ratio of the exposure (i.e. after seeing the disease) normalized by the prior ratio of exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Statistical Methods in Medical Research|vauthors=Armitage P, Berry G, Matthews JN|date=2002|publisher=Blackwell Science Ltd|isbn=978-0-470-77366-6|edition=Fourth|doi=10.1002/9780470773666}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the posterior ratio of exposure is similar to that of the prior, the effect is approximately 1, indicating no association with the disease, since it didn't change beliefs of the exposure. If on the other hand, the posterior ratio of exposure is smaller or higher than that of the prior ratio, then the disease has changed the view of the exposure danger, and the magnitude of this change is the risk ratio.

[[File:IAPSO Standard Seawater.jpg|thumb|upright|right|International Association for the Physical Sciences of the Oceans (IAPSO) standard seawater.]]
'''Salinity''' ({{IPAc-en|s|eɪ|ˈ|l|ɪ|n|ə|t|i}}) is the saltiness or amount of [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] dissolved in a body of [[water]] (see also [[soil salinity]]). This is usually measured in &lt;math&gt;\frac{g \ \textrm{salt}}{kg \  \textrm{sea} \  \textrm{water}}&lt;/math&gt; (note that this is technically dimensionless). Salinity is an important factor in determining many aspects of the [[chemistry]]
of natural waters and of [[biological]] processes within it, and is a [[state function|thermodynamic state variable]] that, along with [[temperature]] and [[pressure]], governs physical characteristics like the [[density]] and [[heat capacity]] of the water.

A [[contour line]] of constant salinity is called an ''isohaline'', or sometimes ''isohale''.

==Definitions==
Salinity in rivers, lakes, and the ocean is conceptually simple, but technically challenging to define and measure precisely. Conceptually the salinity is the quantity of dissolved salt content of the water. Salts are compounds like [[sodium chloride]], [[magnesium sulfate]], [[potassium nitrate]], and [[sodium bicarbonate]] which dissolve into ions. The concentration of dissolved chloride ions is sometimes referred to as chlorinity. Operationally, dissolved matter is defined as that which can pass through a very fine filter (historically a filter with a pore size of 0.45 μm, but nowadays usually 0.2 μm).&lt;ref name=key&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pawlowicz|first=R.|title=Key Physical Variables in the Ocean: Temperature, Salinity, and Density|journal=Nature Education Knowledge|year=2013|volume=4|issue=4|pages=13|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/key-physical-variables-in-the-ocean-temperature-102805293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salinity can be expressed in the form of a [[Mass fraction (chemistry)|mass fraction]], i.e. the mass of the dissolved material in a unit mass of solution.

Seawater typically has a mass salinity of around 35&amp;nbsp;g/kg, although lower values are typical near coasts where rivers enter the ocean. Rivers and lakes can have a wide range of salinities, from less than 0.01&amp;nbsp;g/kg&lt;ref name=dilute&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eilers|first1=J. M.|last2=Sullivan|first2=T. J.|last3=Hurley|first3=K. C.|title=The most dilute lake in the world?|journal=Hydrobiologia|year=1990|volume=199|pages=1–6|doi=10.1007/BF00007827}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a few g/kg, although there are many places where higher salinities are found. The [[Dead Sea]] has a salinity of more than 200&amp;nbsp;g/kg.&lt;ref name=anati&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anati|first=D. A.|title=The salinity of hypersaline brines: concepts and misconceptions|journal=Int. J. Salt Lake. Res.| year=1999|volume=8|pages=55–70|doi=10.1007/bf02442137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rainwater before touching the ground typically has a TDS of 20 mg/L or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salinitymanagement.org/Salinity%20Management%20Guide/ls/ls_3d.html | title=Learn about salinity and water quality | accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever pore size is used in the definition, the resulting salinity value of a given sample of natural water will not vary by more than a few [[percent]] (%). Physical oceanographers working in the [[Abyssal zone|abyssal ocean]], however, are often concerned with precision and intercomparability of measurements by different researchers, at different times, to almost five significant digits.&lt;ref name="teos10"/&gt; A bottled seawater product known as IAPSO Standard Seawater is used by oceanographers to standardize their measurements with enough precision to meet this requirement.

===Composition===
Measurement and definition difficulties arise because natural waters contain a complex mixture of many different elements from different sources (not all from dissolved salts) in different molecular forms. The chemical properties of some of these forms depend on temperature and pressure. Many of these forms are difficult to measure with high accuracy, and in any case complete chemical analysis is not practical when analyzing multiple samples. Different practical definitions of salinity result from different attempts to account for these problems, to different levels of precision, while still remaining reasonably easy to use.

For practical reasons salinity is usually related to the sum of masses of a subset of these dissolved chemical constituents (so-called ''solution salinity''), rather  than to the unknown mass of salts that gave rise to this composition (an exception is when [[artificial seawater]] is created).  For many purposes this sum can be limited to a set of eight major ions in natural waters,&lt;ref name=wetzel&gt;{{cite book|last=Wetzel|first=R. G.|title=Limnology: Lake and River Ecosystems, 3rd ed.|year=2001|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-744760-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=limteos&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pawlowicz|first1=R.|first2=R.|last2=Feistel|title=Limnological applications of the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10)|journal=Limnology and Oceanography: Methods|year=2012|volume=10|issue=11|pages=853–867| doi=10.4319/lom.2012.10.853}}&lt;/ref&gt; although for seawater at highest precision an additional seven minor ions are also included.&lt;ref name=teos10&gt;{{cite book|last=IOC, SCOR, and IAPSO|title=The international thermodynamic equation of seawater – 2010: Calculation and use of thermodynamic properties |year=2010 |publisher=Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, UNESCO (English) |pages=196pp |url=http://www.TEOS-10.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The major ions dominate the inorganic composition of most (but by no means all) natural waters. Exceptions include some [[Cenote|pit lake]]s and waters from some [[hydrothermal spring]]s.

The concentrations of dissolved gases like [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]] are not usually included in descriptions of salinity.&lt;ref name=key /&gt; However, [[carbon dioxide]] gas, which when dissolved is partially converted into [[carbonates]] and [[bicarbonates]], is often included. [[Silicon]] in the form of [[silicic acid]], which usually appears as a neutral molecule in the [[pH]] range of most natural waters, may also be included for some purposes (e.g., when salinity/density relationships are being investigated).

The term 'salinity' is, for oceanographers, usually associated with one of a set of specific measurement techniques. As the dominant techniques evolve, so do different descriptions of salinity. Salinities were largely measured using [[titration]]-based techniques before the 1980s. Titration with [[silver nitrate]] could be used to determine the concentration of [[halide]] ions (mainly [[chlorine]] and [[bromine]]) to give a [[chlorinity]]. The chlorinity was then multiplied by a factor to account for all other constituents. The resulting 'Knudsen salinities' are expressed in units of parts per thousand (ppt or [[Per mille|‰]]).

The use of [[electrical conductivity]] measurements to estimate the ionic content of seawater led to the development of the scale called the ''practical salinity scale 1978'' (PSS-78).&lt;ref name="pss78a"&gt;Unesco (1981). The Practical Salinity Scale 1978 and the International Equation of State of Seawater 1980. ''Tech. Pap. Mar. Sci.'', 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pss78b"&gt;Unesco (1981). [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0004/000479/047932eb.pdf Background papers and supporting data on the Practical Salinity Scale 1978]. ''Tech. Pap. Mar. Sci.'', 37&lt;/ref&gt; Salinities measured using PSS-78 do not have units. {{anchor|PSU}}The suffix '''psu''' or '''PSU''' (denoting ''practical salinity unit'') is sometimes added to PSS-78 measurement values.&lt;ref name=rant&gt;{{cite journal|last=Millero|first=F. J.|journal=Oceanography| year=1993|volume=6| issue=3| pages=67|title=What is PSU?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 a new standard for the properties of seawater called the ''thermodynamic equation of seawater 2010'' (TEOS-10) was introduced, advocating absolute salinity as a replacement for practical salinity, and [[conservative temperature]] as a replacement for [[potential temperature]].&lt;ref name="teos10"/&gt; This standard includes a new scale called the ''reference composition salinity scale''. Absolute salinities on this scale are expressed as a mass fraction, in grams per kilogram of solution. Salinities on this scale are determined by combining electrical conductivity measurements with other information that can account for regional changes in the composition of seawater. They can also be determined by making direct density measurements.

A sample of seawater from most locations with a chlorinity of 19.37&amp;nbsp;ppt will have a Knudsen salinity of 35.00&amp;nbsp;ppt, a PSS-78 practical salinity of about 35.0, and a TEOS-10 absolute salinity of about 35.2&amp;nbsp;g/kg. The electrical conductivity of this water at a temperature of 15&amp;nbsp;°C is 42.9 mS/cm.&lt;ref name="teos10"/&gt;&lt;ref name=culk&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Culkin|first1=F.|last2=Smith|first2=N. D.|title=Determination of the Concentration of Potassium Chloride Solution Having the Same Electrical Conductivity, at 15C and Infinite Frequency, as Standard Seawater of Salinity 35.0000‰ (Chlorinity 19.37394‰)|journal=IEEE J. Oceanic Eng.|year=1980|volume=OE-5|issue=1|pages=22–23|doi=10.1109/JOE.1980.1145443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lakes and rivers===

[[Limnologist]]s and chemists often define salinity in terms of mass of salt per unit volume, expressed in units of mg per litre or g per litre.&lt;ref name=wetzel/&gt; It is implied, although often not stated, that this value applies accurately only at some reference temperature. Values presented in this way are typically accurate to the order of 1%. Limnologists also use [[electrical conductivity]], or "reference conductivity", as a proxy for salinity. This measurement may be corrected for temperature effects, and is usually expressed in units of μS/cm.

A river or lake water with a salinity of around 70&amp;nbsp;mg/L will typically have a specific conductivity at 25&amp;nbsp;°C of between 80 and 130&amp;nbsp;μS/cm. The actual ratio depends on the ions present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Niekerk|first1=Harold|last2=Silberbauer|first2=Michael|last3=Maluleke|first3=Mmaphefo|title=Geographical differences in the relationship between total dissolved solids and electrical conductivity in South African rivers|journal=Water SA|date=2014|volume=40|issue=1|pages=133|doi=10.4314/wsa.v40i1.16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual conductivity usually changes by about 2% per degree Celsius, so the measured conductivity at 5&amp;nbsp;°C might only be in the range of 50–80&amp;nbsp;μS/cm.

Direct density measurements are also used to estimate salinities, particularly in highly [[saline lake]]s.&lt;ref name="anati"/&gt; Sometimes density at a specific temperature is used as a proxy for salinity. At other times an empirical salinity/density relationship developed for a particular body of water is used to estimate the salinity of samples from a measured density.

Marine waters are those of the ocean, another term for which is ''euhaline seas''. The salinity of euhaline seas is 30 to 35. ''Brackish seas'' or waters have salinity in the range of 0.5 to 29 and ''metahaline seas'' from 36 to 40. These waters are all regarded as ''thalassic'' because their salinity is derived from the ocean and defined as ''homoiohaline'' if salinity does not vary much over time (essentially constant). The table on the right, modified from Por (1972),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF00373210|title=Hydrobiological notes on the high-salinity waters of the Sinai Peninsula|year=1972|last1=Por|first1=F. D.|journal=Marine Biology|volume=14|pages=111–119|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; follows the "Venice system" (1959).&lt;ref&gt;Venice system (1959). The final resolution of the symposium on the classification of brackish waters. ''Archo Oceanogr. Limnol.'', 11 (suppl): 243–248.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to homoiohaline environments are certain ''poikilohaline'' environments (which may also be ''thalassic'') in which the salinity variation is biologically significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dahl, E. |year=1956|title=Ecological salinity boundaries in poikilohaline waters|journal=Oikos|volume=7|pages=1–21|doi=10.2307/3564981|issue=1|jstor=3564981}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Poikilohaline'' water salinities may range anywhere from 0.5 to greater than 300. The important characteristic is that these waters tend to vary in salinity over some biologically meaningful range seasonally or on some other roughly comparable time scale. Put simply, these are bodies of water with quite variable salinity.

Highly saline water, from which salts crystallize (or are about to), is referred to as [[brine]].

===Environmental considerations===
Salinity is an ecological factor of considerable importance, influencing the types of organisms that live in a body of water. As well, salinity influences the kinds of [[plant]]s that will grow either in a water body, or on land fed by a water (or by a [[groundwater]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kalcic, Maria|first=Turowski, Mark; Hall, Callie|title=Stennis Space Center Salinity Drifter Project. A Collaborative Project with Hancock High School, Kiln, MS|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20110008620|work=Stennis Space Center Salinity Drifter Project|publisher=NTRS|accessdate=2011-06-16|date=2010-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A plant adapted to saline conditions is called a [[halophyte]]. A halophyte which is tolerant to [[residual sodium carbonate index|residual sodium carbonate]] salinity are called  [[glasswort]] or [[saltwort]] or [[barilla]] plants. Organisms (mostly bacteria) that can live in very salty conditions are classified as [[extremophile]]s, or [[halophile]]s specifically. An organism that can withstand a wide range of salinities is [[euryhaline]].

Salt is expensive to remove from water, and salt content is an important factor in water use (such as [[drinking water|potability]]).  Increases in salinity have been observed in lakes and rivers in the United States, due to common [[road salt]] and [[De-ice#Chemical de-icers|other salt de-icers]] in runoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbur.org/news/2018/01/29/road-salt-environmental-dangers|title=Hopes To Hold The Salt, And Instead Break Out Beet Juice And Beer To Keep Roads Clear|website=www.wbur.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree of salinity in oceans is a driver of the [[Thermohaline circulation|world's ocean circulation]], where density changes due to both salinity changes and temperature changes at the surface of the ocean produce changes in buoyancy, which cause the sinking and rising of water masses. [[Paleosalinity|Changes in the salinity of the oceans]] are thought to contribute to global changes in carbon dioxide as more saline waters are less soluble to carbon dioxide. In addition, during glacial periods, the [[hydrography]] is such that a possible cause of reduced circulation is the production of stratified oceans. Hence it is difficult in this case to subduct water through the thermohaline circulation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13503">'''Shared historical authority''' is a current trend in [[museums]] and [[cultural institutions|historical institutions]] which aims to open the interpretation of [[history]] to the public.

== Definition ==
The concept of shared historical [[authority]] is defined by the premise that traditional institutions of historical authority, such as museums and [[historical society|historical societies]], are increasingly inviting non-professionals (the general public) to share their historical [[Perspective (cognitive)|viewpoints]] and [[experience]]s with the public. It is argued that this trend toward sharing authority is changing the nature of public historical experience in significant ways.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Shared authority removes the hierarchy commonly practiced within cultural institutions. Moving away from a top down approach, shared authority is geared towards collaboration that includes dialogue, and participatory engagement.  

Typical examples of shared historical authority include:
* A museum inviting a community artist to create and install a work of historically inspired public art on their site.
* A historical society providing gallery space for community groups to display their own exhibitions.
* Web-based projects that invite and display user-generated components.
* Using oral and written histories contributed by individuals outside the strictly academic community in conjunction with more traditional scholarly essays, text panels or exhibit labels.
* A historic house tour where visitors are encouraged to explore on their own and draw their own conclusions.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}
* Community curation - "crowdsourcing" related content from [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] groups

In each case the institution serves as a catalyst for non-traditional participants to contribute to a body of information presented to the public.  The institution uses its resources - e.g. staff expertise, collections, public space - to help non-traditional participants share their contributions in publicly accessible and engaging ways.  At its most basic, shared authority turns people who would otherwise be historical consumers (visitors and audiences) into participants and co-generators of historical content for public display. Museums who coordinate programs that share historical authority often wish to imbue a sense of democratization to the historical narrative, in contrast to the top-down historical narratives that sometimes emerge in museums. In addition, shared authority projects frequently try to involve communities who have traditionally been disenfranchised or underrepresented in historical narratives and institutions, providing a platform for alternative voices to engage in a public historical dialogue.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} The role of shared historical authority continues to be debated in the field of [[public history]].

== History of the idea ==

The need for museums and other historical institutions to "share authority" with their audiences and surrounding communities is rooted in the ideologies of [[social history|New Social History]] and social constructivism.  Both paradigms reject the concept of a "master narrative" for describing historical events, finding it an inadequate method for representing the multiple experiences and perspectives of individuals involved.  Arising from the work of folklorists such as [[John Lomax]] and [[Alan Lomax]], [[New Deal]]-era [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) programs such as the [[Federal Writers' Project]] and the work of [[Studs Terkel]], the social history movement of the 1960s placed new academic emphasis on the experiences of people not represented in traditional or "official" historical narratives, and gave further impetus to projects focused on collecting and sharing those experiences.&lt;ref name="Bill Adair, Benjamin Filene, and Laura Koloski 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bill Adair, Benjamin Filene, and Laura Koloski|first=eds.|title= Letting Go? Sharing Historical Authority in a User-Generated World|year=2011|publisher=The Pew Center for Arts and Heritage|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-9834803-0-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Frisch, a professor at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York]], popularized the term "shared authority" in his 1990 book ''A Shared Authority: Essays on the Craft and Meaning of Oral and Public History.'' In recent years, Frisch has distinguished between "sharing authority" and "''a'' shared authority." The former suggests that historians possess authority and have a responsibility to share it, reinforcing a traditional, top-down view of history. "A shared authority", by contrast, recognizes that traditional historical authorities and the public share in the interpretive and [[meaning-making]] process "''by definition''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frisch|first=Michael|title="From A Shared Authority to the Digital Kitchen, and Back" in Bill Adair, Benjamin Filene, and Laura Koloski, eds., Letting Go? Sharing Historical Authority in a User-Generated World|year=2011|publisher=The Pew Center for Arts and Heritage|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-9834803-0-3|pages=126–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the early 2000s, the proliferation of [[Web 2.0]] technologies that allow users to easily create and share content on digital platforms offered historical institutions a variety of new tools to facilitate public participation.

==Case Studies==
[[File:97 Orchard Street Front.jpg|thumb|The [[Lower East Side Tenement Museum]] in New York's Manhattan district is a good example of how an urban museum can share historical authority]]

Other examples of shared historical authority include [[StoryCorps]], City of Memory, and Philaplace, an internet based neighborhood history project produced by the Historical Society of Philadelphia that combines scholarly essays with stories from anyone who cares to submit one.  Staff members then curate the submitted stories. [[Dennis Severs' House|Dennis Severs House]] is a historic townhouse in [[London]] (18 Folgate St.) that was restored by Dennis Severs.  The house is filled with historic objects alongside modern touches, sound clips of carriages and crying babies, and plates of real food set out each day by the staff.  Visitors are encouraged to roam the house on their own, sit down on the furniture, interact with other visitors and draw their own conclusions. The experience is meant to blur the lines between art and history.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The [[Lower East Side Tenement Museum]] is the first museum to focus on the lives of [[Urban area|urban]], [[immigrant]] [[tenement]] dwellers.  It shares authority by inviting the families of former residents to contribute objects, photographs, documents, interviews and oral histories to the museum tours.  Part of the museum's mission is to address today's immigrant issues. This provides another avenue for sharing authority through public programs that connect speakers with varied backgrounds to public audiences. The museum invites sharing on one of its tours, ''Sweatshop Workers'', with the words:

:"Spend extended time inside the Levine and Rogarshevsky apartments and join in a discussion about themes arising from the tour. Share your experiences, thoughts and family histories with your educator and fellow visitors."&lt;ref name="LESTMtours"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tenement.org/tours.php | title=Sweatshop Workers: Tour &amp; Discussion | publisher=Lower East Side Tenement Museum | work=Tour the Building | year=2011 | accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Open House: If These Walls Could Talk is an exhibition that was produced by the [[Minnesota Historical Society]] in 2006. The exhibition traced the stories of families in a single house in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] between 1888 and 2006.  The curators did not want to show patterns or people as part of aggregate groups.  Instead, they chose to emphasize singularity and individuality.  To accomplish this, the Minnesota Historical Society built a house for visitors to walk through.  Instead of reading large panels of wall texts, visitors had to interact with objects to hear, read, or see information.  Unlike projects in which the content is produced in conjunction with a group of community members, here authority was shared at the level of [[narrative]] creation.  Curators controlled the objects in the house, recordings of former residents, and the setup of the space.  Without an overarching structure, visitors could wander through at random, co-creating their own narratives. There was no clear beginning and end beyond entering and exiting the house.&lt;ref&gt;Filene, B. (2011). Make Yourself At Home-- Welcoming Voices in Open House: If These Walls Could Talk.''Letting Go? Sharing Historical Authority in a User-Generated World''. in Bill Adair, Benjamin Filene, and Laura Koloski (eds.),''Letting Go? Sharing Historical Authority in a User-Generated World'', pp. 138-155.  Philadelphia, PA: Pew Center for Arts and Heritage. {{ISBN|978-0-9834803-0-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black Bottom Performance Project is a partnership between the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and residents of [[Black Bottom, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Black Bottom]], an historically black neighborhood destroyed by [[urban renewal]] policies and the University of Pennsylvania's expansion in the 1960s.  Billy Yalowitz, a theater professor working at the university, invited Penn students as well as student and teacher partners from University City High School—a school built in the former Black Bottom neighborhood—and former residents of the neighborhood to work together on the telling of the neighborhood's history, ultimately creating "Black Bottom Sketches" in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Yalowitz, B. (2011). "The Black Bottom: Making Community-Based Performance in West Philadelphia." in Bill Adair, Benjamin Filene, and Laura Koloski (eds.),''Letting Go? Sharing Historical Authority in a User-Generated World'', pp. 156-173.  Philadelphia, PA: Pew Center for Arts and Heritage. {{ISBN|978-0-9834803-0-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wing_Luke_Museum_of_the_Asian_Pacific_American_Experience|Wing Luke Museum]] is an example of a museum in which shared authority is a core component of its programming policies.

==Criticism==

Despite the interest and affirmation that sharing authority is currently receiving in museum and public humanities circles, there are scholars and practitioners who criticise the practice.  Generally, these criticisms are aimed at one of two levels.  First, some scholars suggest that the phrase itself is wrong. "Sharing authority" implies that the process is something museums/archives do rather than something that just "is."  In his essay for ''Letting Go?'', Michael Frisch suggests that a more appropriate formulation of the concept is "a shared authority."&lt;ref name=Frisch/&gt;

:"a shared authority"... suggests something that 'is'-- that in the nature of oral and public history, we are not the sole interpreters.  Rather, the interpretive and meaning-making process is in fact shared by definition-- it is inherent in the dialogic nature of an interview, and in how audiences receive and respond to exhibitions and public history interchanges in general.&lt;ref name=Frisch&gt;Frisch in ''Letting Go?'', p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars and artists also worry that sharing authority devalues the hard-won expertise of professionals. The artist [[Fred Wilson (artist)|Fred Wilson]], whose 1992-1993 exhibit "Mining the Museum" at the [[Maryland Historical Society]] is considered a landmark moment in museums' assessments of their role as historical arbiters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Letting Go?|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; has expressed, "I don't think people should share authority to the degree that you devalue your own scholarship, your own knowledge. That's not sharing anything. You're not giving what you have. That is highly problematic. You have to be realistic about your years of experience, what you can give, and what others can give."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fred Wilson, Paula Marincola, and Marjorie Schwarzer|first= "Mining the Museum Revisited: A Conversation"|title= in Letting Go?|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and influence ==

He was born in the village of Konaka in present-day [[Sano, Tochigi|Sano]], [[Tochigi Prefecture]], and was the son of the village [[Village head|headman]]. In 1857, he became headman after his father and served for twelve years.&lt;ref name="Perspectives"/&gt;{{rp|113}} In 1879, he founded the ''Tochigi Shimbun'', a periodical in which he discussed human rights and contemporary issues.&lt;ref name="n"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Nihon Daihyakka Zensho (Nipponika) |title=田中正造 |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |accessdate=2013-11-08 |year=2013 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |language=Japanese |trans-title=Shōzō Tanaka |oclc=153301537 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archivedate=August 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tanaka became a member of the Tochigi Prefectural Assembly in 1880, and its Chairman in 1886.&lt;ref name="NDL"/&gt; In the [[Japanese general election, 1890|general election of 1890]], the first ever held in Japan, he was elected to the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] as a member of the [[Rikken Kaishintō]], a liberal political party.&lt;ref name="NDL"/&gt;
 
Tanaka is best known for his advocacy in connection with the pollution caused by waste from the [[Ashio Copper Mine]].&lt;ref name="Letter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timescolonist.com/anti-nuclear-japanese-lawmaker-attacked-from-all-sides-for-handing-letter-to-emperor-akihito-1.687774|title=Anti-nuclear Japanese lawmaker attacked from all sides for handing letter to Emperor Akihito|author=Mari Yamaguchi|publisher=Associated Press|date=November 7, 2013|accessdate=November 8, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224125726/http://www.timescolonist.com/anti-nuclear-japanese-lawmaker-attacked-from-all-sides-for-handing-letter-to-emperor-akihito-1.687774|archivedate=February 24, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from the mid-1880s, rivers near the mine became highly polluted and in 1890 a large flood carried poisonous wastes from the mine into surrounding areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/uu35ie/uu35ie04.htm|title=The Ashio Copper mine pollution case: The origins of environmental destruction, Ch. 1, Sec.

'''Synchrony''' and '''diachrony''' are two different and complementary viewpoints in [[linguistic]] analysis. A synchronic approach (from Greek συν- "together" and χρόνος "time") considers a language at a moment in time without taking its history into account. Synchronic linguistics aims at describing a language at a specific point of time, usually the present. By contrast, a [[historic linguistics|diachronic]] approach (from δια- "through" and χρόνος "time") considers the development and evolution of a language through history. [[Historical linguistics]] is typically a diachronic study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9027272077 |title=Synchrony and Diachrony: A dynamic interface |editor1-last=Giacalone Ramat |editor1-first=Anna |editor2-last=Mauri |editor2-first=Caterina |editor3-last=Molinelli |editor3-first=Piera |isbn=9027272077 |pages=17, 18 |publisher=John Benjamins North America |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |date=2013 |access-date=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts were theorized by the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], professor of general linguistics in [[Geneva]] from 1896 to 1911, and appeared in writing in his posthumous ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]'' published in 1916. In contrast with most of his predecessors, who focused on historical evolution of languages, Saussure emphasized the primacy of synchronic analysis of languages to understand their inner functioning, though never forgetting the importance of complementary diachrony. This dualistic opposition has been carried over into [[philosophy]] and [[sociology]], for instance by [[Roland Barthes]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. [[Jacques Lacan]] also used it for [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Four_Fundamental_Concepts_of_Psycho.html?id=5guFfqA6l0UC&amp;redir_esc=y|title=The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis |author-last=Lacan |author-first=Jacques |editor1-last=Miller |editor1-first=Jacques-Alain |isbn=0393317757 |pages=46 |publisher=Éditions du Seuil |location=France |date=1978 |access-date=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to de Saussure, many similar concepts were also developed independently by [[Poland|Polish]] linguists [[Jan Baudouin de Courtenay]] and [[Mikołaj Kruszewski]] of the [[Kazan school]], who used the terms '''statics''' and '''dynamics''' of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=BQfDosHckzEC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;dq|title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Linguistics |author-last=Allan |author-first=Keith  |isbn= 9780199585847 |pages=172 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=United Kingdom |date=2013 |access-date=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5288">Technology for Peace is a Cyprus-based peoples' initiative launched in 1995 to serve the needs of peace pioneers on the divided island.

==History==
The peace portal &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mirror.undp.org/cyprus/projects/project_details.asp?ProjectID=105 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724203325/http://mirror.undp.org/cyprus/projects/project_details.asp?ProjectID=105 |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was born because it was deemed needed. What led to its birth was neither the availability of relevant technology nor the availability of funding, because both were not there. The ban of bi-communal meetings imposed by the Turkish Cypriot Authorities following the EU’s decision to postpone accession negotiations with Turkey (summit meeting in Luxembourg, December 1997) stopped face-to-face dialogues (during the time window 1994-1997) and threatened to nullify all peace building efforts on the island. The idea came out of several (# 9, 10 &amp; 11) of the 15 peace promoting projects, which made it to the final [[Cyprus_Conflict_Resolution_Trainers_Group#Cyprus_Peace_Bazaar|Cyprus Peace Bazaar]] organized by the [[Cyprus Conflict Resolution Trainers Group]] in 1995.

==Tech4Peace vision==
The vision, which underpinned the project Technology For Peace (Tech4Peace) was to enhance in Cyprus
one of the most basic human rights, the right of communication, by applying modern technology in the service of peace with emphasis on the usage of Internet and Internet-based applications. A promising and creative way to enhance inter-communal communication where there exist substantial hindrances to direct contact between peoples is through the use of the Internet. Cyberspace and Internet provide an efficient, fast, tractable, confidential, organized, time and space independent means of communication. As individuals and organizations throughout the world continue to demonstrate, the Internet can overcome the challenge posed by physical separation, whether due to geographic, political or other reasons, by effectively moving discourse into "cyberspace."

==Activities==
The Tech4Peace team organized a series of trainings in the usage of the net to communicate across the dividing line in the years 1996-1998. In 1998, with USAID funding given to Dr. [[Hrach Gregorian]], cyber peace cafes on the northern and southern parts of Nicosia have been set up within CYBER KIDS centers, from where peace builders could communicate with their peers on the other side. Participants were also exposed to the ICONS project&lt;ref&gt;https://www.icons.umd.edu ICONS Project&lt;/ref&gt;, developed at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], using simulations and scenario-driven exercises to advance their understanding of complex problems and strengthen their ability to make decisions, navigate crises, think strategically, and negotiate collaboratively. In the next years, the project team developed theory of how technology in general can serve bridge the divides,&lt;ref&gt;Laouris, Y. and Laouri, R. (2008). Can Information and mobile technologies serve close the economic, educational, digital and social gaps and accelerate development? World Futures, 64(4), 254-275.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as how technology can support the ethical engagement of all stakeholders in a dialogue which concerns their own futures&lt;ref&gt;Laouris, Y., Laouri, R. and Christakis, A. (2008). Communication praxis for ethical accountability; The ethics of the tree of action. Syst Res Behav Sci 25(2), 331–348.&lt;/ref&gt;
.

==Contributions==
The Tech4Peace project has been evaluated by Nathan Associates &lt;ref&gt;Nathan Associates, FINAL REPORT, CYPRUS BI-COMMUNAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM EVALUATION. Prepared for the United States Agency for International Development. IQC No. AEP-I-00-00-00023-00. Evaluation team: Richard Blue (Team Leader), Vivikka Molldrem, Craig Webster, Alejandro Gonzales, Mine Yucel, Yiorghos Leventis&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[United States Agency for International Development]] as a project that has contributed towards Peace and Reconciliation in Cyprus. It was one of few projects, which received support multiple times and were funded by the [[UNOPS]], [[United Nations]] funding scheme during the very first funding cycle.

==Founding members==
The Tech4Peace project was founded as one of the selected [[Cyprus_Conflict_Resolution_Trainers_Group#Cyprus_Peace_Bazaar|Cyprus Peace Bazaar]] Projects in 1997. The members of the founding team were [[Yiannis Laouris]], [[Harry Anastasiou]], Dervis Besimler and Bekir Azgin. They were all members of the [[Cyprus Conflict Resolution Trainers Group]].

The '''terminal web''' is a filamentous structure found at the apical surface of epithelial cells that possess [[microvilli]].  It is composed primarily of [[actin]] filaments stabilized by [[spectrin]], which also anchors the terminal web to the apical cell membrane. The presence of [[myosin II]] and [[tropomyosin]] helps to explain the contractile ability of the terminal web. When contracted, the terminal web causes a decrease in diameter of the apex of the cell, causing the microvilli, which are anchored into the terminal web through their stiff actin fibers, to spread apart. This spreading apart of the microvilli aids cells in absorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Hirokawa N, Tilney LG, Fujiwara K, Heuser JE | title = Organization of actin, myosin, and intermediate filaments in the brush border of intestinal epithelial cells. | journal = J Cell Biol | volume = 94 | issue = 2 | pages = 425–43 | year = 1982 | pmid = 7202010 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.94.2.425 | pmc = 2112874}} [http://www.jcb.org/cgi/reprint/94/2/425 link]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Keller TC 3rd, Mooseker MS | title = Ca++-calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of myosin, and its role in brush border contraction in vitro. | journal = J Cell Biol | volume = 95 | issue = 3 | pages = 943–59 | year = 1982 | pmid = 6897550 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.95.3.943 | pmc = 2112925}} [http://www.jcb.org/cgi/reprint/95/3/943 link]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Keller TC 3rd, Conzelman KA, Chasan R, Mooseker MS | title = Role of myosin in terminal web contraction in isolated intestinal epithelial brush borders. | journal = J Cell Biol | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 1647–55 | year = 1985 | pmid = 3988804 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.100.5.1647 | pmc = 2113869}} [http://www.jcb.org/cgi/reprint/100/5/1647 link]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Michael H., and Wojciech Pawlina.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5927">'''Thorngate's postulate of commensurate complexity''',&lt;ref name="Weick01"/&gt; also referred to as '''Thorngate's impostulate of theoretical simplicity'''&lt;ref name=Weick03/&gt; is the description of a phenomenon in [[social science]] theorizing. [[Karl E. Weick]] maintains that research in the field of social psychology can – at any one time – achieve only two of the three [[Metatheory|meta-theoretical]] virtues of "Generality", "Accuracy" and "Simplicity." One of these aspects therefore must always be subordinated to the others.&lt;ref name="DBO"/&gt; The postulate is named for the Canadian social psychologist Warren Thorngate of the [[University of Alberta]], whose work is quoted by Weick.&lt;ref name="DBO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thorngate76"/&gt;

Thorngate described the problem this way: 
{{Quotation|'“In order to increase both ''generality'' and ''accuracy'', the ''complexity'' of our theories must necessarily be increased.”&lt;ref name=Weick03/&gt;}}

== Background ==
The postulate was a response to the debate among sociologists – mainly between [[Kenneth J. Gergen]]&lt;ref name="Gergen73"/&gt; and [[Barry R. Schlenker]]&lt;ref name="Schlenker74"/&gt; – revolving around the meaning of sociological research. Whilst Schlenker appeared to maintain the position, that context only superficially influenced social behavior, Gergen appeared to maintain that context penetrated everything in social behavior, rendering observations as specific to the very situation observed. Thus, simplifying the discussion, the observation of social behavior would be no more than collecting historical data, since context would never be the same and the results would remain unique. In fact, sociology would be some specialized kind of historical research.&lt;ref name="Thorngate76"/&gt; Considering this, Thorngate writes

{{Quotation|''It is impossible for a theory of social behaviour to be simultaneously general, simple or parsimonious, and accurate.''|Warren Thorngate&lt;ref name="Thorngate76"/&gt;}}

The statement was confirmed by Gergen:

{{Quotation|''The more general a simple theory, the less accurate it will be in predicting specifics.''|Kenneth J. Gergen&lt;ref name ="Gergen76"/&gt;}}

== Weick's Interpretation ==
Weick represents this model “as a clockface with general at 12:00, accurate at 4:00, and simple at 8:00 to drive home the point that an explanation that satisfies any two characteristics is least able to satisfy the third characteristic.”&lt;ref name=Weick03/&gt;

According to Weick, research operates in this continuum: 
* if research that aims to be accurate and simple (6-o'clock), results would not be generally applicable.
* if research that aims to be general and simple (10-o'clock), results would not be accurate and
* if research that aims to be general and accurate (2-o'clock), results would not be simple any more.

Basically, Weick maintains, that there is a "trade-off" between these three virtues in such a way that only two can be achieved at any given time. Research therefore must operate in different modes to capture reality in sufficient precision and granularity.&lt;ref name="Weick02"/&gt; The postulate therefore becomes descriptive of research and prescriptive of research methodology.

== Criticism ==
Though confirming the postulate in general, Fred Dickinson, Carol Blair and Brian L. Ott criticized Weicks use of the word "accurate".&lt;ref name="DBO"/&gt; Accuracy is hard to achieve, especially if the topic is difficult to qualify, e.&amp;nbsp;g. in researching memory. They suggest replacing the term "accurate" with "interpretive utility".&lt;ref name="DBO"/&gt;

In [[Hydrology]], '''throughfall''' is the process which describes how wet leaves shed excess [[water]] onto the ground surface. These drops have erosive power because they are larger than [[rain]] drops, however, if they travel a shorter distance their erosive power is reduced. In the case of a high canopy, higher than what is required for the drops to reach [[terminal velocity]], about {{convert|8|m|ft}}, the erosive power is increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Stuart | first = Gordon W. | last2 = Edwards | first2 = Pamela J. | title = Concepts about Forests and Water | journal = Northern Journal of Applied Forestry | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–19 | year = 2006 | url = http://www.fs.fed.us/ne/newtown_square/publications/other_publishers/OCR/ne_2006_stuart001.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rates of throughfall are higher in areas of [[forest]] where the leaves are broad-leaved. This is because the flat leaves allow water to collect. [[Drip-tip]]s also facilitate throughfall. Rates of throughfall are lower in [[coniferous]] forests as conifers can only hold individual droplets of water on their needles.

'''Torulene''' (3',4'-didehydro-β,γ-carotene) is a carotene (a hydrocarbon [[carotenoid]]) which is notable for being synthesized by red [[pea aphid]]s (''[[Acyrthosiphon pisum]]''), imparting the natural red color to the aphids, which aids in their camouflage and escape from predation. The aphids have gained the ability to synthesize torulene by [[horizontal gene transfer]] of a number of genes for carotenoid synthesis, apparently from fungi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/328/5978/574.summary] Accessed Dec. 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Plants, fungi, and microorganisms can synthesize carotenoids, but torulene made by pea aphids is the only carotenoid known to be synthesized by an organism in the animal kingdom.&lt;ref name="moran2010"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nancy A.
