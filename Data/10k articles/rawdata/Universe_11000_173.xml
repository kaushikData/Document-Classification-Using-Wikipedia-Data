The '''2009 southeast Queensland oil spill''' occurred  off the coast of southeast [[Queensland]], [[Australia]] on 11 March 2009, when 230 tonnes of [[fuel oil]], 30 tonnes of other fuel and 31 [[Intermodal container|shipping container]]s containing 620 tonnes of [[ammonium nitrate]] spilled into the [[Coral Sea]], north of [[Moreton Bay]] during [[Cyclone Hamish (2009)|Cyclone Hamish]]. It happened after unsecured cargo on {{MV|Pacific Adventurer}} damaged other cargo, causing the spillage.&lt;ref name=abc20090313&gt;{{cite news | title=Oil spill: Qld beaches declared disaster zones | work=ABC News | publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date=13 March 2009| url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/03/13/2514943.htm | accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following days, the spill washed ashore along {{convert|60|km}} of coastline encompassing the [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine Coast]], [[Moreton Bay]], [[Bribie Island]] and [[Moreton Island]].

The ship proceeded through Moreton Bay and docked at the [[Port of Brisbane]] where it continued to spread a {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}} long slick in the mouth of the [[Brisbane River]].&lt;ref name="CourierMail"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ironside |first=Robyn |author2=Caldwell, Anna |author3=Williams, Brian |title=Pacific Adventurer oil spill a disaster says Anna Bligh |work=The Courier Mail |publisher=News Limited |date=13 March 2009 |url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,25179213-952,00.html |accessdate=13 March 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314001803/http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0%2C23739%2C25179213-952%2C00.html |archivedate=14 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Queensland government declared a state of emergency. Premier [[Anna Bligh]] described the spill as the "worst environmental disaster Queensland has ever seen."&lt;ref name="CourierMail"/&gt; It took over 1,425 people 16 months to clean up the affected areas.&lt;ref name="moscfd"&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/environment/moreton-oil-spill-clean-up-finally-declared-over-20100723-10ng8.html Moreton oil spill clean up finally declared over]. The Age. Retrieved 24 July&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause and initial responses==
MV ''Pacific Adventurer'' was sailing from [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] to the [[Port of Brisbane]] in [[Moreton Bay]]. [[Cyclone Hamish (2009)|Cyclone Hamish]] had formed off the coast of Queensland. Subsequently, the improperly stowed cargo dislodged from the deck damaging other cargo and containers, causing various substances to spill into the ocean. The ship was damaged at and below the waterline and began to leak fuel and lubricant oil.

Over the following days the spill washed ashore over a 60&amp;nbsp;km stretch of coastline. In an interview, crew members stated that the captain, Bernardino Santos, was to blame for the incident. The captain decided to stay on course, directly through the storm. As the ship encountered heavy swells, the 20 crew members went below deck, fearing for their lives. At 3:12&amp;nbsp;a.m., a wave broke the restraints for the cargo and sent 31 containers of ammonium nitrate overboard. The Queensland maritime safety authorities estimated that the ship was at a 25-degree angle at the time the containers were knocked off.  When the ship came back down, one of the containers damaged the hull. After rolling to the opposite side, it crashed onto another container, creating a large hole underneath the ship, which was not noticed until it docked in Brisbane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kelmeny Fraser and Daryl Passmore |publisher=''Sunday Herald Sun'' |date=15 March 2009 |accessdate=16 March 2009 |title=Skipper blamed |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25187797-662,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316002358/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0%2C21985%2C25187797-662%2C00.html |archivedate=16 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Swire Group|Swire Shipping]] initially reported that only 20 tonnes had been spilled. This was later revised to 30 tonnes, 100 tonnes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Swire Shipping|date=13 March 2009|accessdate=13 March 2009|title=Pacific Adventurer Incident|url=http://www.swireshipping.com/web/news.jsp?fid=368| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090318021110/http://www.swireshipping.com/web/news.jsp?fid=368| archivedate= 18 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 230 tonnes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff Writer|publisher=ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)|date=14 March 2009|accessdate=14 March 2009|title=Oil spill crisis multiplied tenfold|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/03/14/2516277.htm| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090317054815/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/03/14/2516277.htm| archivedate= 17 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 250 tonnes.&lt;ref name="BT6"&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew Wight|publisher=''Brisbane Times''|date=15 March 2009|accessdate=15 March 2009|title=Clean-up efforts continue|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/queensland/cleanup-efforts-continue/2009/03/15/1237054623644.html| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090319062020/http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/queensland/cleanup-efforts-continue/2009/03/15/1237054623644.html| archivedate= 19 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Queensland Government reacted to the situation based on the initial information of 20 tonnes, which was later discovered to be inaccurate, leading to claims of an inadequate initial clean-up response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff Writer |publisher=AFP |date=13 March 2009 |accessdate=13 March 2009 |title=Australian beaches a 'disaster zone' after oil spill |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hDAWjR6F0vfnjnrMO4zP6Mj_7vkQ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5fEplZAMe?url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hDAWjR6F0vfnjnrMO4zP6Mj_7vkQ |archivedate=13 March 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; After divers inspected the ship for the source of the spill, two holes were found. One, located just above the waterline, was 10&amp;nbsp;mm (0.4&amp;nbsp;in) long 15&amp;nbsp;mm (0.6&amp;nbsp;in) wide. The second and larger hole was underneath the ship and measured about 1&amp;nbsp;m (3.3&amp;nbsp;ft) long and 300&amp;nbsp;mm (12&amp;nbsp;in) wide.&lt;ref name="TA1"/&gt;

==Affected areas==
In the days following the spill, substances washed ashore along a {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} stretch of coastline. Oil covered beaches, rocky reefs, coastal wetlands and [[Australian mangroves|mangrove wetlands]].&lt;ref name="moscfd"/&gt; Most of these areas were declared restricted zones and public access was limited. Radar satellite images acquired in preparation for cyclone damage captured the extent of the spill before it hit the coastline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff Writer |publisher=Apogee Imaging International |date=16 March 2009 |accessdate=16 March 2009 |title=TerraSAR-X monitoring oil spill in Queensland |url=http://www.apogee.com.au/blog/?p=220 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318010425/http://www.apogee.com.au/blog/?p=220 |archivedate=18 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clean-up==
Following the oil spill Queensland Premier [[Anna Bligh]] declared two islands and parts of the Sunshine Coast disaster areas.&lt;ref name="BN2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Angela Macdonald-Smith|publisher=Bloomberg News|date=13 March 2009|accessdate=13 March 2009|title=Australia’s Queensland Declares Disaster as Oil Coats Beaches|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&amp;sid=aZMInXpC.QLU&amp;refer=asia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clean-up efforts were reportedly going to cost at least [[Australian Dollar|A$]]100,000 a day and last more than a week as the oil continued to spread. Several search parties have been sent to the spill area to attempt to find the potentially explosive materials that were in the 31 containers. Press reports stated that if the ammonium nitrate were to mix with the heavy fuel, the mixture could ignite and cause a large explosion. If the chemical did not react with the fuel but still leaked out, marine life could be threatened by large blooms of algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff Writer |publisher=Transport and Logistics News |date=12 March 2009 |accessdate=12 March 2009 |title=Hazardous Cargo Ship Sent Into Savage Storm |url=http://tandlnews.com.au/2009/03/12/article/URKMGGLKSW.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318064115/http://tandlnews.com.au/2009/03/12/article/URKMGGLKSW.html |archivedate=18 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 15 March, the cost of the spill jumped to $A10&amp;nbsp;million ($6.6&amp;nbsp;million USD).&lt;ref name="CM2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Brian Williams, Patrick Lion and Alison Sandy |work=The Courier Mail |date=15 March 2009 |title=Oil spill ship skipper Bernadino Santos has passport seized |url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,27574,25191367-3102,00.html |accessdate=14 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319161345/http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0%2C27574%2C25191367-3102%2C00.html |archivedate=19 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A team of 88 people were sent out to begin the clean-up process and a further 58 were expected to join within the following days.&lt;ref name="BT7"&gt;{{cite news | author=Christine Kellett | work=The Brisbane Times | date=13 March 2009 | title=Oil slick puts Moreton Island drinking water at risk | url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/queensland/oil-slick-threatens-water-supply/2009/03/13/1236447442720.html| accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 March, the Royal Australian Navy began searching for the 31 containers of ammonium nitrate that were knocked off the ship. A navy minehunter was sent to look for the containers to reduce the amount of impact the chemical could cause.&lt;ref name="AP2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dennis Passa |publisher=Associated Press |date=16 March 2009 |accessdate=16 March 2009 |title=Australian navy to help spill clean up |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hyxN0-euQHg86qF7mqlLLPeUgn-QD96UVS580 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5fJqrOMpZ?url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hyxN0-euQHg86qF7mqlLLPeUgn-QD96UVS580 |archivedate=16 March 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clean-up was a delicate operation, because high tides had already eroded beaches after ex-tropical cyclone Hamish battered the coast over the previous week. At the same time, high tides carried off some of the fuel oil initially deposited along shorelines and dispersed it back into the sea. By 15 March, the federal government reported that 50% of the oil had been contained and that the slick had been removed from about 95% of Bribie Island, 85% of the Sunshine Coast and 25% of the waters around Moreton Island.&lt;ref name="TA1"&gt;{{cite news | author=AAP | work=The Age | date=15 March 2009 | accessdate=15 March 2009 | title=Government says it has oil spill under control | url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/government-says-it-has-oil-spill-under-control-20090315-8yq7.html?page=-1| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090318001901/http://www.theage.com.au/national/government-says-it-has-oil-spill-under-control-20090315-8yq7.html?page=-1| archivedate= 18 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Moreton Island,  290 people worked to clean up the oil, with most focusing on Middle Creek and Cape Moreton.&lt;ref name="BT6"/&gt; Even though hundreds of people had worked on cleaning the spill, the average amount of oil cleaned each day was 1&amp;nbsp;km (0.6&amp;nbsp;mi) per day. At that rate, it would have taken more than a month to clean all the affected areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Connie Levett|publisher=''The Age''|date=15 March 2009|accessdate=15 March 2009|title=Oil spill could take a month to clean|url=http://www.theage.com.au/environment/oil-spill-could-take-a-month-to-clean-20090314-8yhd.html?page=2| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090318213835/http://www.theage.com.au/environment/oil-spill-could-take-a-month-to-clean-20090314-8yhd.html?page=2| archivedate= 18 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Government promised to provide $A2&amp;nbsp;million ($1.3&amp;nbsp;million USD) to help with the clean-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephanie Peatling|publisher=''The Sydney Morning Herald''|date=17 March 2009|accessdate=17 March 2009|title=Navy joins search for containers|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/navy-joins-search-for-containers-20090316-8zyl.html| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090318002701/http://www.smh.com.au/national/navy-joins-search-for-containers-20090316-8zyl.html| archivedate= 18 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clean-up in process ===
In late July 2010, the clean-up effort was declared "complete". Federal Environment Minister [[Peter Garrett]] attended clean-up sites to celebrate the end of clean-up efforts.&lt;ref name="moscfd"/&gt; 1,425 personnel took 16 months to clean up 155&amp;nbsp;hectares of coastal area and included installation of 21,220 plants and 2.6&amp;nbsp;km of fencing to protect recovering vegetation.&lt;ref name="moscfd"/&gt;

==Effects and consequences==
{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=May 2012}}

===Disaster declaration===
Shortly after the slick washed ashore the Queensland government declared a state of emergency.&lt;ref name="CourierMail"/&gt; The disaster declaration will restrict public access to beaches affected by the oil slick and allow clean-up teams unobstructed access. The declaration covers:
*All of Moreton Island.
*Coastal waters and beaches in the Sunshine Coast, Redcliffe and Brisbane disaster districts.
*The southern tip of Bribie Island to Point Arkwright.

===Local economy===
Several of the local restaurants which receive shipments of fish from the waters off the Queensland coast refused to stock any more fish due to the spill. The cost of the clean-up also hurt the economy, costing at least A$10&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="CM2"/&gt; In July 2009 the total bill was estimated to be A$34 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Gray and Jessica Marszalek|publisher=''The Age''|date=5 July 2009|accessdate=10 November 2009|title=Qld unlikely to recover oil spill costs|url=http://news.theage.com.au/breaking-news-national/qld-unlikely-to-recover-oil-spill-costs-20090705-d8oy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Australian Government provided A$750,000 to help jump-start the tourist industry. Fourteen of the 19 beaches affected along the Sunshine Coast that had been cleaned were reopened in March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Daniel Hurst|publisher=''Brisbane Times''|date=17 March 2009|accessdate=17 March 2009|title=Govt allocates $750k to keep tourism afloat after oil spill|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/queensland/750k-campaign-to-keep-tourism-afloat-after-oil-spill/2009/03/17/1237054808103.html| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090318152538/http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/queensland/750k-campaign-to-keep-tourism-afloat-after-oil-spill/2009/03/17/1237054808103.html| archivedate= 18 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fines and legal implications===
Once the ship was at port, Captain Santos was forced to surrender his passport to Australian officials and he was to remain in Brisbane for at least two weeks to help with the investigation. On 14 October 2011, Swire Navigation and Bluewind Shipping were fined $A600,000 each and ordered to publish a public apology after earlier pleading guilty to causing the spill. The court heard the two companies have already paid $A17.5 million under a limitation order in the Federal Court, as well as an additional $A7.5 million to help cover the $A31 million cost of cleaning up the damage. Charges against Santos were dropped earlier in the week.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smh.com.au/environment/conservation/oilspill-companies-fined-12-million-20111014-1loqd.html#ixzz2uFxx61oA&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wildlife===
The [[Environmental Protection Agency (Queensland)|Environmental Protection Agency]] reports that the full extent of wildlife affected by the spill has yet to be realised. "The flow-on effects of oil spills can be substantive," according to a spokesperson for the agency. "The longer-term impacts are yet to be realised." Several birds have been found covered with oil.&lt;ref name="CourierMail"/&gt; By 17 March, about 30 animals had been recovered after being covered with oil. All of the animals were immediately treated and cleaned.&lt;ref name="TA2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Adam Morton and Cosima Marriner|publisher=''The Age''|date=17 March 2009|accessdate=17 March 2009|title=Oil spill to require lengthy eco-monitoring|url=http://www.theage.com.au/environment/oil-spill-to-require-lengthy-ecomonitoring-20090316-8zwn.html| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090317171856/http://www.theage.com.au/environment/oil-spill-to-require-lengthy-ecomonitoring-20090316-8zwn.html| archivedate= 17 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oiled animals included pelicans, ghost crabs and sea snakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.news.com.au/national/saving-wildlife-from-a-man-made-disaster/story-e6frfkvr-1225699433381|title = Queensland oil spill: saving wildlife from a man-made disaster|last = |first = |date = 2009-03-14|work = |accessdate = 2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2290">An '''anabatic wind''', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[wikt:anabasis|anabatos]]'', verbal of ''anabainein'' meaning moving upward, is a warm wind which blows up a steep slope or [[mountain]] side, driven by heating of the slope through [[insolation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knmi.nl/~koek/glossary.html Marine Meteorological Glossary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211112917/http://www.knmi.nl/~koek/glossary.html |date=December 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AMS&gt;[http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/browse?p=49&amp;s=A American Meteorology Society Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as an upslope flow. These winds typically occur during the daytime in calm sunny weather. A [[hill]] or mountain top will be [[heat transfer|radiatively]] warmed by the [[Sun]] which in turn [[heat]]s the [[air]] just above it.  Air at a similar [[altitude]] over an adjacent [[valley]] or [[plain]] does not get warmed so much because of the greater distance to the ground below it.  The effect may be enhanced if the lower lying ground is shaded by the mountain and so receives less heat.

The air over the hill top is now warmer than the air at a similar altitude around it and will rise through [[convection]].  This creates a lower pressure region into which the air at the bottom of the slope flows, causing the wind. It is common for the air rising from the tops of large mountains to reach a height where it cools [[adiabatic process|adiabatically]] to below its [[dew point]] and forms [[cumulus cloud]]s.  These can then produce [[rain]] or even [[thunderstorm]]s.&lt;ref name=AMS/&gt;

Anabatic winds are particularly useful to soaring [[Glider (sailplane)|glider]] pilots who can use them to increase the aircraft's altitude. Anabatic winds can be detrimental to the maximum downhill speed of cyclists.

Conversely, [[Katabatic wind|Katabatic winds]] are down-slope winds, frequently produced at night by the opposite effect, the air near to the ground losing heat to it faster than air at a similar altitude over adjacent low-lying land.
 
[[Monsoon]] winds are similarly generated, but on a continental scale and seasonal cycle.

{{infobox barium}}
'''Barium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&amp;nbsp;'''Ba''' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;56. It is the fifth element in group 2 and is a soft, silvery [[alkaline earth metal]]. Because of its high chemical [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]], barium is never found in nature as a free element. Its hydroxide, known in pre-modern times as [[Barium hydroxide|baryta]], does not occur as a [[mineral]], but can be prepared by heating barium carbonate.

The most common naturally occurring minerals of barium are [[Baryte|barite]] (now called baryte&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mindat.org/min-549.html |website=www.mindat.org |title=Baryte: Baryte mineral information and data.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://nrmima.nrm.se&lt;/ref&gt;) ([[barium sulfate]], BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[witherite]] ([[barium carbonate]], BaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), both insoluble in water. The name ''barium'' originates from the alchemical derivative "baryta", from [[Greek language|Greek]] βαρύς (''barys''), meaning "heavy." ''Baric'' is the adjectival form of barium. Barium was identified as a new element in 1774, but not reduced to a metal until 1808 with the advent of [[electrolysis]].

Barium has few industrial applications.  Historically, it was used as a [[getter]] for [[vacuum tube]]s and in oxide form as the emissive coating on [[Hot cathode#Oxide-coated cathodes|indirectly heated cathodes]]. It is a component of [[Yttrium barium copper oxide|YBCO]] ([[High-temperature superconductivity|high-temperature superconductors]]) and electroceramics, and is added to steel and cast iron to reduce the size of carbon grains within the microstructure. Barium compounds are added to fireworks to impart a green color. [[Barium sulfate]] is used as an insoluble additive to [[oil well]] [[drilling fluid]], as well as in a purer form, as X-ray [[radiocontrast agent]]s for imaging the human gastrointestinal tract. The soluble barium [[ion]] and soluble compounds are poisonous, and have been used as [[rodenticide]]s.

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===
[[File:Barium 1.jpg|thumb|left|Oxidized barium]]
Barium is a soft, silvery-white metal, with a slight golden shade when ultrapure.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kresse, Robert |author2=Baudis, Ulrich |author3=Jäger, Paul |author4=Riechers, H. Hermann |author5=Wagner, Heinz |author6=Winkler, Jocher |author7=Wolf, Hans Uwe |chapter=Barium and Barium Compounds |editor=Ullman, Franz |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |date=2007 |publisher=Wiley-VCH |doi=10.1002/14356007.a03_325.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} The silvery-white color of barium metal rapidly vanishes upon [[redox|oxidation]] in air yielding a dark gray [[Barium oxide|oxide]] layer. Barium has a medium [[specific weight]] and good electrical conductivity. Ultrapure barium is very difficult to prepare, and therefore many properties of barium have not been accurately measured yet.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|2}}

At room temperature and pressure, barium has a [[body-centered cubic]] structure, with a barium–barium distance of 503 [[picometer]]s, expanding with heating at a rate of approximately 1.8{{e|-5}}/°C.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|2}} It is a very soft metal with a [[Mohs hardness]] of 1.25.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|2}} Its melting temperature of {{convert|1000|K|C F}}&lt;ref name="Lide2004"&gt;{{cite book|last = Lide |first= D. R. |title = CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics |edition = 84th |location = Boca Raton (FL) |publisher = CRC Press |date = 2004 |isbn = 978-0-8493-0484-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4–43}} is intermediate between those of the lighter strontium ({{convert|1050|K|C F|disp=or}})&lt;ref name="Lide2004" /&gt;{{rp|4–86}} and heavier radium ({{convert|973|K|C F|disp=or}});&lt;ref name="Lide2004" /&gt;{{rp|4–78}} however, its boiling point of {{convert|2170|K|C F}} exceeds that of strontium ({{convert|1655|K|C F|disp=or}}).&lt;ref name="Lide2004" /&gt;{{rp|4–86}} The density (3.62&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;ref name="Lide2004" /&gt;{{rp|4–43}} is again intermediate between those of strontium (2.36&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;ref name="Lide2004" /&gt;{{rp|4–86}} and radium (~5&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="Lide2004" /&gt;{{rp|4–78}}

===Chemical reactivity===
Barium is chemically similar to magnesium, calcium, and strontium, but even more reactive. It always exhibits the oxidation state of +2, except in a few rare and unstable molecular species that are only characterised in the gas phase such as BaF.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|2}} Reactions with [[chalcogen]]s are highly [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]] (release energy); the reaction with oxygen or air occurs at room temperature, and therefore barium is stored under oil or in an inert atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|2}} Reactions with other [[nonmetal]]s, such as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, silicon, and hydrogen, are generally exothermic and proceed upon heating.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|2–3}} Reactions with water and alcohols are very exothermic and release hydrogen gas:&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}}
: Ba + 2 ROH → Ba(OR)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;↑ (R is an alkyl group or a hydrogen atom)

Barium reacts with [[ammonia]] to form complexes such as Ba(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}}

The metal is readily attacked by most acids. [[Sulfuric acid]] is a notable exception because [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] stops the reaction by forming the insoluble [[barium sulfate]] on the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Müller, Hermann|chapter=Sulfuric Acid and Sulfur Trioxide|editor=Ullman, Franz|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|date=2007|publisher=Wiley-VCH|doi=10.1002/14356007.a03_325.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barium combines with several metals, including [[aluminium]], [[zinc]], [[lead]], and [[tin]], forming [[intermetallics|intermetallic phases]] and alloys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Ferro, Riccardo|author2= Saccone, Adriana|last-author-amp= yes|page=355|title=Intermetallic Chemistry|publisher=Elsevier|date=2008|isbn=978-0-08-044099-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barium salts are typically white when solid and colorless when dissolved, and barium ions provide no specific coloring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=87|title=Qualitative analysis and the properties of ions in aqueous solution|author=Slowinski, Emil J.|author2=Masterton, William L.|publisher=Saunders|date=1990|edition=2nd|isbn=978-0-03-031234-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are denser than the [[strontium]] or [[calcium]] analogs, except for the [[halide]]s (see table; [[zinc]] is given for comparison).

[[Barium hydroxide]] ("baryta") was known to alchemists, who produced it by heating barium carbonate. Unlike calcium hydroxide, it absorbs very little CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in aqueous solutions and is therefore insensitive to atmospheric fluctuations. This property is used in calibrating pH equipment.

Volatile barium compounds burn with a green to pale green [[flame test|flame]], which is an efficient test to detect a barium compound. The color results from [[spectral line]]s at 455.4, 493.4, 553.6, and 611.1&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}} &lt;!---BaO forms a peroxide when heated in air.&lt;ref name=O2/&gt;---&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of barium}}

Barium found in the Earth's crust is a mixture of seven primordial nuclides, barium-130, 132, and 134 through 138.&lt;ref name="iso"/&gt; Barium-130 undergoes very slow [[radioactive decay]] to [[xenon]]-130 by double [[Beta decay|beta plus decay]], and barium-132 theoretically decays similarly to xenon-132, with half-lives a thousand times greater than the [[age of the Universe]].&lt;ref name="NUBASE"&gt;{{cite journal| first = Audi| last = Georges|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties| journal = Nuclear Physics A| volume = 729| pages = 3–128| publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center| date = 2003| doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001| bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A| last2 = Bersillon| first2 = O.| last3 = Blachot| first3 = J.| last4 = Wapstra| first4 = A.

P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The radioactivity of these isotopes is so weak that they pose no danger to life.

Of the stable isotopes, barium-138 composes 71.7% of all barium, and the lighter the isotope, the less abundant.&lt;ref name="iso" /&gt;

In total, barium has about 50 known isotopes, ranging in mass between 114 and 153. The most stable metastable isotope is barium-133 with a half-life of approximately 10.51&amp;nbsp;years.  Five other isotopes have half-lives longer than a day.&lt;ref name="NUBASE" /&gt; Barium also has 10 [[meta state]]s, out of which barium-133m1 is the most stable with a half-life of about 39 hours.&lt;ref name="NUBASE" /&gt;&lt;!---&lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Ba is a standard calibrant for [[gamma-ray]] detectors in nuclear physics studies.---&gt;

==History==
[[File:Humphry Davy Engraving 1830.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Humphry Davy|Sir Humphry Davy]], who first isolated barium metal]]
Alchemists in the early Middle Ages knew about some barium minerals. Smooth pebble-like stones of mineral baryte were found in volcanic rock near [[Bologna]], [[Italy]], and so were called "Bologna stones." Alchemists were attracted to them because after exposure to light they would glow for years.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; The phosphorescent properties of baryte heated with organics were described by V. Casciorolus in 1602.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

[[Carl Scheele]] determined that baryte contained a new element in 1774, but could not isolate barium, only [[barium oxide]]. [[Johan Gottlieb Gahn]] also isolated [[barium oxide]] two years later in similar studies. Oxidized barium was at first called "barote" by [[Guyton de Morveau]], a name that was changed by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] to ''baryta.'' Also in the 18th century, English mineralogist [[William Withering]] noted a heavy mineral in the lead mines of [[Cumberland]], now known to be [[witherite]]. Barium was first isolated by electrolysis of molten barium salts in 1808 by Sir [[Humphry Davy]] in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;Davy, H. (1808) "[https://books.google.com/books?id=gpwEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=102 Electro-chemical researches on the decomposition of the earths; with observations on the metals obtained from the alkaline earths, and on the amalgam procured from ammonia]," ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', vol. 98, pp. 333–370.&lt;/ref&gt; Davy, by analogy with [[calcium]], named "barium" after baryta, with the "-ium" ending signifying a metallic element.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite book| page = 80| url = https://books.google.com/?id=yb9xTj72vNAC| title = The history and use of our earth's chemical elements: a reference guide| author = Krebs, Robert E. | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| date = 2006| isbn = 0-313-33438-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Bunsen]] and [[Augustus Matthiessen]] obtained pure barium by electrolysis of a molten mixture of [[barium chloride]] and [[ammonium chloride]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1002/jlac.18550930301|title = Masthead|date = 1855|journal = Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie|volume = 93|issue = 3|pages = fmi–fmi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi =10.1002/prac.18560670194|title =Notizen|date =1856|last1 =Wagner|first1 =Rud|last2 =Neubauer|first2 =C.|last3 =Deville|first3 =H.

The production of pure oxygen in the [[Brin process]] was a large-scale application of barium peroxide in the 1880s, before it was replaced by electrolysis and [[fractional distillation]] of liquefied air in the early 1900s. In this process barium oxide reacts at {{convert|500|-|600|C|F}} with air to form barium peroxide, which decomposes above {{convert|700|C}} by releasing oxygen:&lt;ref name=O2&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Jensen|first1 = William B.|title = The Origin of the Brin Process for the Manufacture of Oxygen|journal = Journal of Chemical Education|volume = 86|pages = 1266|date = 2009|doi = 10.1021/ed086p1266|issue = 11 |bibcode = 2009JChEd..86.1266J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=34KwmkU4LG0C&amp;pg=PA681|page = 681|title = The development of modern chemistry|isbn = 978-0-486-64235-2|author1 = Ihde, Aaron John|date = 1984-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barium sulfate was first applied as a [[radiocontrast]] agent in [[medical imaging|X-ray imaging]] of the digestive system in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc = 1081520|title = Some Observations on the History of the Use of Barium Salts in Medicine|date = 1974|volume = 18|issue = 1|author=Schott, G.

==Occurrence and production==
The abundance of barium is 0.0425% in the Earth's crust and 13&amp;nbsp;µg/L in sea water. The primary commercial source of barium is baryte (also called barytes or heavy spar), a barium sulfate mineral.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|5}} with deposits in many parts of the world. Another commercial source, far less important than baryte, is witherite, a barium carbonate mineral. The main deposits are located in England, Romania, and the former USSR.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

The baryte reserves are estimated between 0.7 and 2 billion [[tonne]]s. The maximum production, 8.3 million tonnes, was produced in 1981, but only 7–8% was used for barium metal or compounds.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|5}} Baryte production has risen since the second half of the 1990s from 5.6 million tonnes in 1996 to 7.6 in 2005 and 7.8 in 2011. China accounts for more than 50% of this output, followed by India (14% in 2011), Morocco (8.3%), US (8.2%), Turkey (2.5%), Iran and Kazakhstan (2.6% each).&lt;ref&gt;Miller, M. M.

The mined ore is washed, crushed, classified, and separated from quartz. If the quartz penetrates too deeply into the ore, or the iron, zinc, or lead content is abnormally high, then [[froth flotation]]&lt;!--https://books.google.com/books?id=zNicdkuulE4C&amp;pg=PA223--&gt; is used. The product is a 98% pure baryte (by mass); the purity should be no less than 95%, with a minimal content of iron and [[silicon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|7}} It is then reduced by carbon to barium sulfide:&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|6}}
:BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 C → BaS + 2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;↑

The water-soluble barium sulfide is the starting point for other compounds: reacting BaS with oxygen produces the sulfate, with nitric acid the nitrate, with carbon dioxide the carbonate, and so on.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|6}} The nitrate can be thermally decomposed to yield the oxide.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|6}} Barium metal is produced by reduction with [[aluminium]] at {{convert|1100|C}}. The [[intermetallic compound]] BaAl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is produced first:&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}}
:3 BaO + 14 Al → 3 BaAl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

BaAl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is an intermediate reacted with barium oxide to produce the metal. Note that not all barium is reduced.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}}
:8 BaO + BaAl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → Ba&amp;darr; + 7 BaAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

The remaining barium oxide reacts with the formed aluminium oxide:&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}}
:BaO + Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → BaAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

and the overall reaction is&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}}
:4 BaO + 2 Al → 3 Ba&amp;darr; + BaAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

Barium vapor is condensed and packed into molds in an atmosphere of argon.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}} This method is used commercially, yielding ultrapure barium.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}} Commonly sold barium is about 99% pure, with main impurities being strontium and calcium (up to 0.8% and 0.25%) and other contaminants contributing less than 0.1%.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|4}}

A similar reaction with silicon at {{convert|1200|C}} yields barium and [[barium metasilicate]].&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}} Electrolysis is not used because barium readily dissolves in molten halides and the product is rather impure.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}}

===Gemstone===
The barium mineral, [[benitoite]] (barium titanium silicate), occurs as a very rare blue fluorescent gemstone, and is the official state gem of [[California]].

==Applications==

===Metal and alloys===
Barium, as a metal or when alloyed with aluminium, is used to remove unwanted gases ([[getter]]ing) from vacuum tubes, such as TV picture tubes.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|4}} Barium is suitable for this purpose because of its low [[vapor pressure]] and reactivity towards oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water; it can even partly remove noble gases by dissolving them in the crystal lattice. This application is gradually disappearing due to the rising popularity of the tubeless LCD and plasma sets.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|4}}

Other uses of elemental barium are minor and include an additive to [[silumin]] (aluminium–silicon alloys) that refines their structure, as well as&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|4}}
* [[bearing alloy]]s;
* lead–tin [[solder]]ing alloys – to increase the creep resistance;
* alloy with nickel for [[spark plug]]s;
* additive to steel and cast iron as an inoculant;
* alloys with calcium, manganese, silicon, and aluminium as high-grade steel deoxidizers.

===Barium sulfate and baryte===
[[File:BariumXray.jpg|thumb|left|[[Amoebiasis]] as seen in a radiograph of a barium-filled colon]]
[[Barium sulfate]] (the mineral baryte, BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is important to the petroleum industry as a [[drilling fluid]] in [[oil well|oil and gas wells]].&lt;ref name="Lide2004" /&gt;{{rp|4–5}} The precipitate of the compound (called "blanc fixe", from the French for "permanent white") is used in paints and varnishes; as a filler in ringing ink, plastics, and rubbers; as a paper coating pigment; and in [[nanoparticle]]s, to improve physical properties of some polymers, such as epoxies.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|9}}

Barium sulfate has a low toxicity and relatively high density of ca. 4.5&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (and thus opacity to X-rays). For this reason it is used as a [[radiocontrast]] agent in [[medical imaging|X-ray imaging]] of the digestive system ("[[barium meal]]s" and "[[Lower gastrointestinal series|barium enemas]]").&lt;ref name="Lide2004" /&gt;{{rp|4–5}} [[Lithopone]], a [[pigment]] that contains barium sulfate and [[zinc sulfide]], is a permanent white with good covering power that does not darken when exposed to sulfides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| page = 102| url = https://books.google.com/?id=uEJHsZWyO-EC| title= Medicinal applications of coordination chemistry| author = Jones, Chris J.| author2 = Thornback, John| last-author-amp = yes | publisher =Royal Society of Chemistry| date = 2007| isbn =0-85404-596-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other barium compounds===
[[File:2006 Fireworks 1.JPG|thumb|Green barium fireworks]]
Other compounds of barium find only niche applications, limited by the toxicity of Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions (barium carbonate is a [[rat poison]]), which is not a problem for the insoluble BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

To avoid a potentially vigorous chemical reaction, barium metal is kept in an argon atmosphere or under mineral oils. Contact with air is dangerous and may cause ignition. Moisture, friction, heat, sparks, flames, shocks, static electricity, and exposure to oxidizers and acids should be avoided. Anything that may contact with barium should be electrically grounded. Anyone who works with the metal should wear pre-cleaned non-sparking shoes, flame-resistant rubber clothes, rubber gloves, apron, goggles, and a gas mask. Smoking in the working area is forbidden. Thorough washing is required after handling barium.&lt;ref name=bariumtoxic/&gt;

'''Botswana Power Corporation (BPC)''' is a state owned company for electrical power generation, transmission and distribution in Botswana. It was established in 1970 and is currently the only electricity supplier in the country. BPC produced an estimated 1,052&amp;nbsp;GWh in 2007, while demand was estimated to 2,648&amp;nbsp;GWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bc.html |title=CIA factbook - Botswana |accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; BPC represents Botswana in the [[Southern African Power Pool]]. [[Morupule Power Station]] (coal-fired) in [[Palapye]] supplies 80% of domestically generated electricity, however the country is dependent on importing energy from its neighbours. Its capacity is estimated to be around 132&amp;nbsp;MW. Since the regions main power generator [[South Africa]] is experiencing its own problems with undercapacity blackouts are a problem. A plan to boost Morupule station with four new 150&amp;nbsp;MW units is underway and gathering financial support from several sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201002221996.html |title=allafrica.com - Botswana: Construction of 600&amp;nbsp;MW Morupule B Power Station Begins |accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Coloured, textured craft card.jpg|thumb|250px|Card stock for [[craft]] use comes in a wide variety of textures and colors.]]
[[File:Art of Bookbinding p239 Oscar Friedheim.png|thumb|An Oscar Friedheim card cutting and scoring machine from 1889]]
'''Card stock''', also called '''cover stock''' or '''pasteboard''', is a [[paperboard|paper stock]] that is thicker and more durable than normal writing or printing [[paper]], but thinner and more flexible than other forms of [[paperboard]]. 

Card stock is often used for [[business card]]s, [[postcard]]s, [[playing cards]], catalogue covers, [[scrapbooking]], and other uses which require higher durability than regular paper. The texture is usually smooth, but can be textured, metallic, or glossy. When card stock is labeled as '''cover stock''' it often has a coated finish on one side or both sides (''C1S'' or ''C2S'', for "coated: one side" or "coated: two sides") to produce a glossy look and smooth texture, especially in use for the printing of business cards and book covers.&lt;ref name="Paper Weight, Paper Size, Coated Paper, Matte Paper"&gt;{{cite news|title=Paper Weight, Paper Size, Coated Paper, Matte Paper|url=http://www.printindustry.com/Newsletters/Newsletter-40.aspx|newspaper=Printing Industry Exchange, LLC|date=Nov 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurements==
Most countries use the term [[grammage]] to describe the weight of the paper in grams per square metre.  The term ''card stock'' is used to describe paper with weights from 50&amp;nbsp;lb to 110&amp;nbsp;lb (about 135 to 300&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="Paper Weight Demystified"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paper and Card Stock Comparison Chart |url=https://blog.thepapermillstore.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/paperweightsdemystified_11.pdf|work=The Paper Mill Store |date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, grammage can be expressed in terms of the weight per number of sheets, [[Paper density#Basis weight|pound weight]] – the weight of 500 sheets of {{convert|17|by|22|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} paper.{{cn|date=January 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;This differs from how text stock is determined, which assumes 500 sheets of {{convert|20|by|38|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} paper.{{cn|date=January 2016}} Because of the difference in the way text and card stock pound weight is determined, a sheet of 65# card stock is actually thicker and heavier than a sheet of 80# text.{{cn|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the U.S., card stock thickness is usually measured in ''[[thou (length)|point]]s'' or ''mils'' which is the thickness of the sheet in [[Thousandth of an inch|thousandths of an inch]]. For example, a 10 pt. card is {{convert|0.010|in|mm|3|abbr=on}} thick (roughly corresponding to a weight of 250&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and 12 pt. is {{convert|0.012|in|mm|4|abbr=on}}. The U.S. Card Stock Thickness Point size is 0.001"&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.paper-paper.com/weight.html "Let's End the "Paper Weight" Confusion"].
&lt;/ref&gt; – not to be confused with [[Point (typography)|typographical point size]], where 1 point = 1/ 12 traditional [[Pica (typography)|pica]] = exactly 0.01383 [[inch]] = 0.35136&amp;nbsp;mm.
 
[[Paper sizes]] using the [[ISO]] system are often used for card stock. Card stock sizes can be labeled as A3 (420 &amp;times; 297&amp;nbsp;mm or 16.5 &amp;times; 11.7&amp;nbsp;in) referencing the ISO Standard system, instead of using the physical dimensions to describe its size.&lt;ref name="Paper Sizes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paper Sizes|url=http://www.papersizes.org/a-paper-sizes.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Card Stock Weights Explained"&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding Card Stock Weights|url=http://www.paper-papers.com/paper-weights.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''compression set''' ([[ASTM]] D395) of a material is the permanent [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]] remaining when a [[force]] (that was applied to it) is removed. The term is normally applied to soft materials such as [[elastomers]]. There are two ways this is normally measured; ''compression set'' '''''A''''' and ''compression set'' '''''B'''''.&lt;ref&gt;Compression Set - ASTM D395 Plastic Test Standard, http://www.ides.com/property_descriptions/ASTMD395.asp, 15 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compression Set A==
This has the formal name '''compression set under constant force in air'''. In ''compression set A'' a force of 1.8 [[kilo Newtons|kN]] is applied to the specimen for a set time at a set temperature. ''Compression set A'' is defined as the percentage of original specimen thickness after the specimen has been left in normal conditions for 30 minutes.  '''C&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''', the ''compression set A'' is given by C&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = [(t&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; - t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) / t&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;] * 100 
where '''t&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the original specimen thickness and '''t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the specimen thickness after testing.&lt;ref&gt;Compression Set - ASTM D395 Plastic Test Standard, http://www.ides.com/property_descriptions/ASTMD395.asp, 15 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Compression Set A Diagram.gif|thumb|150px|right|alt=Compression Set A Diagram|A diagram of the ''compression set A'' experiment (under constant force in air).]]

==Compression Set B==
This has the formal name '''compression set under constant deflection in air'''. The specimen is compressed to 75% of its original height for a set time and at a set temperature (sample is compressed to .75 of its original height) ''Compression set B'' is (like ''Compression set A'') defined as the percentage of original specimen thickness after it has been left in normal conditions for 30 minutes.  '''C&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''', the ''compression set B'' is given by C&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = [(t&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; - t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) / (t&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; - t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)] * 100 
where '''t&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the original specimen thickness, '''t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the specimen thickness after testing and '''t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the spacer thickness or the specimen thickness during the test.&lt;ref&gt;Compression Set - ASTM D395 Plastic Test Standard, http://www.ides.com/property_descriptions/ASTMD395.asp, 15 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The natural frequency mode tends to be around 1&amp;nbsp;Hz, leading the often graceful periodic motion to also be known as '''conductor dancing'''.&lt;ref name="g&amp;p"&gt;{{citation | title=Electrical Power Systems, volume I | last= Guile A. &amp; Paterson W. | page=138 | publisher=Pergamon | isbn=0-08-021729-X | year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pansini"&gt;{{citation | title=Power Transmission and Distribution |first=Anthony J. |last=Pansini |publisher=Fairmont Press |year=2004 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hd5JncHGcLMC&amp;pg=RA2-PA204&amp;lpg=RA2-PA204&amp;dq=transmission+conductor+dancing |isbn=0-88173-503-5 |pages=204–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oscillations can exhibit amplitudes in excess of a metre, and the displacement is sometimes sufficient for the [[Polyphase system|phase conductors]] to infringe operating clearances (coming too close to other objects), and causing [[Electric arc|flashover]].&lt;ref name="hv_testing"&gt;{{citation|title=High Voltage Engineering and Testing |first=Hugh |last=Ryan |publisher=IET | year=2001 |isbn=0-85296-775-6 |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forceful motion also adds significantly to the loading stress on [[Insulator (electrical)|insulators]] and [[electricity pylon]]s, raising the risk of mechanical failure of either.

The mechanisms that initiate gallop are not always clear, though it is thought to be often caused by asymmetric conductor [[aerodynamics]] due to ice build up on one side of a wire.&lt;ref name="pansini"/&gt; The crescent of encrusted ice approximates an [[aerofoil]], altering the normally round profile of the wire and increasing the tendency to oscillate.&lt;ref name="pansini"/&gt;

Gallop can be a significant problem for [[transmission system operator]]s, particularly where lines cross open, windswept country and are at risk to ice loading. If gallop is likely to be a concern, designers can employ smooth-faced conductors, whose improved icing and aerodynamic characteristics reduce the motion.&lt;ref name="hv_testing"/&gt; Additionally, anti-gallop devices may be mounted to the line to convert the lateral motion to a less damaging twisting one. Increasing the [[Tension (physics)|tension]] in the line and adopting more rigid insulator attachments have the effect of reducing galloping motion. These measures can be costly, are often impractical after the line has been constructed, and can increase the tendency for the line to exhibit high frequency oscillations.&lt;ref name="McCombe"&gt;

If ice loading is suspected, it may be possible to increase power transfer on the line, and so raise its temperature by [[Joule heating]], melting the ice.&lt;ref name="pansini"/&gt; The sudden loss of ice from a line can result in a phenomenon called "jump", in which the [[overhead lines|catenary]] dramatically rebounds upwards in response to the change in weight.&lt;ref name="bicc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="g&amp;p"/&gt; If the risk of trip is high, the operator may elect to pre-emptively switch out the line in a controlled manner rather than face an unexpected fault. The risk of mechanical failure of the line remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kw.knack.be/west-vlaanderen/nieuws/algemeen/delen-van-diksmuide-en-kortemark-zonder-stroom/article-4000248066347.htm |title=Delen van Diksmuide en Kortemark zonder stroom (In Dutch, mechanical failure due to galloping effect)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conductor gallop analysis ==
Conductor gallop analysis overlaps several academic disciplines.  Mechanical vibrations covers the laws of motion of the conductor and the long conductor acts as a mass suspended by an elastic spring obeying Hooke's law.  Within the discipline of Mechanical vibration, conductor gallop is categorized as a self-excited vibration because the forces which generate conductor gallop are generated by the motion itself.  One of the early leaders in modern mechanical vibrations, J. P. Den Hartog, described conductor gallop in a chapter on self-excited vibrations in his text book ''Mechanical Vibrations'', copyrighted in 1956 and reprinted by Dover Publications, where he develops general stability criteria for conductor gallop but without a complete mathematical solution.  However, conductor gallop analysis also relates to Civil engineering because the electric conductors are carried by towers and the study of wind influences on structures, including any kind of vibration, has been much studied, especially after the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows bridge due to flutter from the structural members.  In fact, perfectly round electrical conductors experience vortex shedding in certain ranges of the [[Reynolds number]].  The underlying behavior in the conductor gallop phenomenon also applies to other civil engineering structural elements such as cables and stays on bridges.  A more recent reference related to the analysis of conductor gallop is ''Flow-Induced Vibrations, An Engineering Guide'', by Eduard Naudascher and Donald Rockwell copyrighted in 1994 and still published by Dover Publications in 2005, in which experimental data related to vortex shedding frequencies as well as the aerodynamic forces on various structure shapes including cylinder models for a conductor or cable.  Another book titled ''Flow-Induced Vibration'' by Robert D. Blevins, 2nd Edition published by Van Nostrand-Reinhold in 1990, also treats conductor gallop while reporting experimental data related to vortex shedding and aerodynamic forces on various structural shapes.  Both of the last-mentioned works include references to scientific and engineering journal articles, many of which directly relate to conductor gallop.  In aeronautical engineering the term "flutter" is used to describe conductor gallop and analogous other phenomena involving aerodynamic forces interacting with elastic structures having inertial mass.

== Flutter ==
A similar aeolian phenomenon is '''flutter''', caused by [[vortex|vortices]] on the [[Windward and leeward|leeward]] side of the wire, and which is distinguished from gallop by its high-frequency (10&amp;nbsp;Hz), low-amplitude motion.&lt;ref name="g&amp;p"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pansini"/&gt; To control flutter, transmission lines may be fitted with [[tuned mass damper]]s (known as [[Stockbridge damper]]s) clamped to the wires close to the towers.&lt;ref name="McCombe"/&gt; The use of bundle conductor spacers can also be of benefit.

Glued closure produces less scarring and is less prone to infection than sutured or stapled closure.  There is also no residual closure to remove, so follow-up visits for removal are not required.

Some research is ongoing on making biodegradable glue for use inside the body, which can thus be broken down safely by the body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/9/410/eaai7466 Engineering a highly elastic human protein–based sealant for surgical applications]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diphthamide''' is a post-translationally modified [[histidine]] [[amino acid]] found in archaeal and [[EEF2|eukaryotic elongation factor 2]] (eEF-2).

==Structure==
Diphthamide is proposed to be a 2-[3-carboxyamido-3-(trimethylammonio)propyl histidine. Though this structure has been confirmed by [[X-ray crystallography]], its stereochemistry is uncertain.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The life and death of translation elongation factor 2.|last = Jorgensen|first = R|date = 2006|journal = Biochem Soc Trans|doi = 10.1042/BST20060001|pmid = 16246167|volume=34|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological function==
Diphthamide ensures translation fidelity.&lt;ref name=pmc4280834&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The biosynthesis and biological function of diphthamide|journal = Critical Reviews in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology|date = 2013-11-01|issn = 1040-9238|pmc = 4280834|pmid = 23971743|pages = 515–521|volume = 48|issue = 6|doi = 10.3109/10409238.2013.831023|first = Xiaoyang|last = Su|first2 = Zhewang|last2 = Lin|first3 = Hening|last3 = Lin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Elsbett''' engine is a 89 HP, direct-injection [[diesel engine]] designed to run on  [[straight vegetable oil]]. The engine is also known as '''Elko engine''' (for "Elsbett Konstruktion") and was invented by [[Ludwig Elsbett]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.be/books?id=QFYKqzNP8FwC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=elsbett+engine+and+horsepower&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Xo0ZHAb2FL&amp;sig=p9myMi3ioDd3tsIAh8GygWW9Ln4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iwaYVauoLoX0UPXUhtgK&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=elsbett%20engine%20and%20horsepower&amp;f=false Popular Science magazine article on the Elko engine]&lt;/ref&gt;

The design limits the loss of energy as heat by a variety of technologies;
* the fuel charged is injected in such a manner as to 'blend perfectly with the air' and combust within a central core of hot air, not contacting the chamber walls, which is necessary for good air/fuel with other designs examined. The Elsbett engine has a deep bowl which has a slight lip
* the engine also doesn't use any water cooling. Instead, only oil is used as a coolant fluid. No water cooling of the engine block was required, and only an oil cooler was used to cool down the oil circulating.

It had a 25% fuel efficiency advantage over contemporary designs in the 1980s. Several revolutionary improvements were achieved in this design, such as a new piston design and combustion process.

The technology was adopted by some companies in the former Soviet Union and a major project by Grupo Garavelo, one of the 50th largest corporations in Brazil in the 80s,Pres. Luiz Garavelo, VP Marco Garavelo and MKT Dir Julio Garavelo, with the Consorcio Nacional Garavelo (140 sales points and 280.000 clients, Banco Garavelo, Hunday-Garavelo , gave vieculos, Lagpar, Mag, Fazenda Nova Viena, Garavelo Agropecuaria, Garavelo Oleos, Garavelo Publicidade, Lojas Garavelo, Garavelo Agropecuaria, Grafica Garavelo, Coryntho Corretora de Seguros, Garavelo Imobiliaria and others, was undertaken in [[Brazil]]. Although work continues on the dedicated multi-fuel Elsbett engine, the company now also sells conversion kits for existing diesel engines to run on vegetable oil.

Elsbett AG is based in [[Thalmaessing]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]].

[[Image:Mineral casting.jpg|thumb|right|Mineral casting]]

'''Epoxy granite''', also known as '''synthetic granite''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/0141-6359(79)90104-1| title = Epoxy granite: a structural material for precision machines| year = 1979| last1 = McKeown | first1 = P.| last2 = Morgan | first2 = G.| journal = Precision Engineering| volume = 1| issue = 4| pages = 227}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[mixture]] of [[epoxy]] and [[granite]] commonly used as an alternative material for [[machine tool]] bases. Epoxy granite is used instead of [[cast iron]] and [[steel]] for better [[vibration damping]], longer tool life, and lower assembly cost.

== Machine tool base ==
Machine tools and other high-precision machines rely upon high stiffness, long-term stability, and excellent damping characteristics of the base material for their static and dynamic performance. The most widely used materials for these structures are cast iron, welded steel fabrications, and natural granite.  Due to the lack of long-term stability and very poor damping properties, steel fabricated structures are seldom used where high precision is required.  Good-quality cast iron that is stress-relieved and annealed will give the structure dimensional stability, and can be cast into complex shapes, but needs an expensive machining process to form  precision surfaces after casting.

Good-quality natural granite is becoming more and more difficult to find, but has a higher damping capacity than cast iron. Again, as with cast iron, the machining of natural granite is labour-intensive and expensive.

== Process ==
[[Image:Aggregate.jpg|thumb|Epoxy granite aggregate]]

Precision granite castings are produced by mixing granite aggregates (which are crushed, washed, and dried) with an epoxy resin system at ambient temperature (i.e., cold curing process). Quartz aggregate filler can also be used in the composition. Vibratory compaction during the molding process tightly packs the aggregate together.

Threaded inserts, steel plates, and coolant pipes can be cast-in during the casting process. To achieve an even higher degree of versatility, linear rails, ground slide-ways and motor mounts can be replicated or grouted-in, therefore eliminating the need for any post-cast machining. The [[surface finish]] of the casting is as good as the mould surface.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Advantages include:

* Vibration damping.
* Flexibility: custom linear ways, [[hydraulic fluid]] tanks, threaded inserts, cutting fluid, and conduit piping can all be integrated into the polymer base.
* Inclusion of inserts etc. allows greatly reduced machining of the finished casting.
* Assembly time is reduced by incorporating multiple components into one casting.
* Does not require a uniform wall thickness, allowing for greater design  flexibility of your base.
* Chemical resistance to most common solvents, acids, alkalis, and cutting fluids.
* Does not require painting.
* Composite has a density approximately the same as aluminum (but pieces are thicker to achieve equivalent strength).
* The composite polymer concrete casting process uses much less energy than metallic castings.  Polymer cast resins use very little energy to produce, and the casting process is done at room temperature.

Epoxy granite material has an internal damping factor up to ten times better than cast iron, up to three times better than natural granite, and up to thirty times better than steel fabricated structure. It is unaffected by [[cutting fluid|coolants]], has excellent long-term stability, improved [[thermal stability]], high torsional and dynamic [[stiffness]], excellent noise absorption, and negligible [[internal stress]]es.

== History ==
Although new to many machine tool builders, especially those in the [[United States]], the composite base has been available in [[Europe]] for several years. Fritz Studer AG of [[Switzerland]] first came up with its Granitan S-100 technology in the early 1970s. The Granitan base is a mixture of reactable epoxy-resin binder developed by Ciba-Geigy Ltd., Switzerland, and granite or gravel. Granitan produced with sand and gravel was developed specifically for the requirements of machine structure manufacturing.

[[Image:Hierarchical Communication Network.png|thumb|A diagram of a hierarchical communications network. '''Feeder lines''' (in red) provide communication with important nodes.]]
A '''feeder line''' is a peripheral route or branch in a [[:wikt:network|network]], which connects smaller or more remote nodes with a route or branch carrying heavier traffic. The term is applicable to any system based on a [[hierarchical network]].

In [[telecommunications]], a feeder line branches from a main line or [[trunk line]].

In [[electrical engineering]], a feeder line is a type of [[transmission line]]. In radio engineering, a feeder connects radio equipment to an [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]], usually ''open wire'' (air-insulated wire line) or [[twin-lead]] from a [[shortwave transmitter]]. In [[power engineering]], a feeder line is part of an [[electric distribution network]], usually a radial circuit of intermediate voltage.

The concept of feeder lines is also important in [[public transportation]]. The term is particularly used in US [[air travel]] and [[rail transport]]. Efficient, high-capacity routes connect important nodes while feeder lines connect these nodes to departure and destination points.

[[File:Coal.jpg|thumb|right|[[Coal]], one of the fossil fuels]]

A '''fossil fuel''' is a [[fuel]] formed by natural processes, such as [[anaerobic decomposition]] of buried dead [[organism]]s, containing energy originating in ancient [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name="thermochemistry of formation"&gt;{{cite web|title=thermochemistry of fossil fuel formation|url=http://www.geochemsoc.org/files/6214/1261/1770/SP-2_271-284_Sato.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The age of the organisms and their resulting fossil fuels is typically millions of years, and sometimes exceeds 650 million years.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Mann, Lisa Gahagan, and Mark B. Gordon, "Tectonic setting of the world's giant oil and gas fields," in [[Michel T. Halbouty]] (ed.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=mrghwzjeU-AC&amp;pg=PA50 ''Giant Oil and Gas Fields of the Decade, 1990–1999''], Tulsa, Okla.: [[American Association of Petroleum Geologists]], p. 50, accessed 22 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Fossil fuels contain high percentages of [[carbon]] and include [[petroleum]], [[coal]], and [[natural gas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fossil fuel |url= https://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/f/fossil_fuel.htm |work= ScienceDaily |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510063436/https://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/f/fossil_fuel.htm|archivedate=2012-05-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Other commonly used derivatives include [[kerosene]] and [[propane]]. 
Fossil fuels range from [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] materials with low [[carbon]] to [[hydrogen]] ratios like [[methane]], to liquids like petroleum, to nonvolatile materials composed of almost pure carbon, like [[anthracite]] coal. 
Methane can be found in [[hydrocarbon]] fields either alone, associated with [[oil field|oil]], or in the form of [[methane clathrates]].

The theory that fossil fuels formed from the [[fossil|fossilized remains]] of dead plants by exposure to heat and pressure in the Earth's crust over millions of years was first introduced by [[Andreas Libavius]] “in his 1597 Alchemia [Alchymia]” and later by [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] “as early as 1757 and certainly by 1763”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Springer Handbook of Petroleum Technology |edition=2nd, illustrated |first1=Chang Samuel |last1=Hsu |first2=Paul R. |last2=Robinson |publisher=Springer |year=2017 |isbn=978-3-319-49347-3 |page=360 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mgxEDwAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=mgxEDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA360 Extract of page 360]&lt;/ref&gt;.  The first use of the term "fossil fuel" was by the German chemist [[Caspar Neumann]], in English translation in 1759.&lt;ref name="NeumannLewis1773"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Caspar Neumann|author2=William Lewis|title=The Chemical Works of Caspar Neumann ... (1773 printing)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OBUAAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA492|year=1759|publisher=J. and F. Rivington|pages=492–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States [[Energy Information Administration]] estimates that in 2007 the world's [[primary energy]] sources consisted of petroleum (36.0%), coal (27.4%), natural gas (23.0%), amounting to an 86.4% share for fossil fuels in [[world energy consumption|primary energy consumption in the world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/IEDIndex3.cfm|title=U.S. EIA International Energy Statistics|accessdate=2010-01-12|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6GDV3MMDx?url=http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/IEDIndex3.cfm|archive-date=2013-04-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Non-fossil sources in 2006 included [[Nuclear power|nuclear]] (8.5%), [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] (6.3%), and others ([[Geothermal power|geothermal]], [[Solar energy|solar]], [[Tidal power|tidal]], [[Wind power|wind]], [[Wood fuel|wood]], [[Waste-to-energy|waste]]) amounting to 0.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/iea/overview.html |title=International Energy Annual 2006 |accessdate=2009-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205035658/http://www.eia.doe.gov/iea/overview.html |archivedate=2009-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
World energy consumption was growing at about 2.3% per year.

Although fossil fuels are continually being formed via natural processes, they are generally considered to be [[non-renewable resources]] because they take millions of years to form and the known viable reserves are being depleted much faster than new ones are being made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=AJ4SnHbb-ZcC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=fossil+fuels+depleted+much+faster+than+renewal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=i44RC-FU6L&amp;sig=jiYif0JITyWRqnl112Rgro2Zfp0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi59d22r_7RAhVLGsAKHV47COQQ6AEIPzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=fossil+fuels+depleted+much+faster+than+renewal&amp;f=false|title=Environmental Science: Problems, Connections and Solutions|first1=G.|last1=Miller|first2=Scott|last2=Spoolman|date=28 September 2007|publisher=Cengage Learning|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=DHKDBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA278&amp;lpg=PA278&amp;dq=fossil+fuels+depleted+much+faster+than+renewal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DCef6lEBXr&amp;sig=HRFYnyQw1COFPBekmu__ZtONtNM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi59d22r_7RAhVLGsAKHV47COQQ6AEINTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=fossil+fuels+depleted+much+faster+than+renewal&amp;f=false|title=Food, Energy, and Water: The Chemistry Connection|first=Satinder|last=Ahuja|date=25 January 2015|publisher=Elsevier|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of fossil fuels raises serious environmental concerns. 
The burning of fossil fuels produces around 21.3&amp;nbsp;billion [[tonnes]] (21.3 [[gigatonne]]s) of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) per year. 
It is estimated that natural processes can only absorb about half of that amount, so there is a net increase of 10.65 billion tonnes of atmospheric carbon dioxide per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/ggccebro/chapter1.html|title=What Are Greenhouse Gases?|work=US Department of Energy |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Carbon dioxide is a [[greenhouse gas]] that increases [[radiative forcing]] and contributes to [[global warming]]. 
A global movement towards the generation of low-carbon [[renewable energy]] is underway to help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.

==Origin==
[[File:Countries by Oil Production in 2013.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Since [[crude oil|oil fields]] are located only at certain places on earth,&lt;ref&gt;[http://quakeinfo.ucsd.edu/~gabi/sio15/energy/supps/globalmap-oil.jpg Oil fields map] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806212614/http://quakeinfo.ucsd.edu/~gabi/sio15/energy/supps/globalmap-oil.jpg |date=2012-08-06 }}. quakeinfo.ucsd.edu&lt;/ref&gt; only some countries are oil-independent; the other countries depend on the oil-production capacities of these countries]]

Aquatic [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] that died and sedimented in large quantities under [[anoxic sea water|anoxic conditions]] millions of years ago began forming petroleum and natural gas as a result of [[anaerobic decomposition]]. Over [[geologic time scale|geological time]] this [[organic compound|organic]] [[matter]], mixed with [[mud]], became buried under further heavy layers of inorganic sediment. The resulting high levels of [[heat]] and [[pressure]] caused the organic matter to chemically [[diagenesis|alter]], first into a waxy material known as [[kerogen]] which is found in [[oil shale]]s, and then with more heat into liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons in a process known as [[catagenesis (geology)|catagenesis]]. Despite these heat driven transformations (which may increase the energy density compared to typical organic matter), the embedded energy is still photosynthetic in origin.&lt;ref name="thermochemistry of formation"/&gt;

[[Terrestrial plant]]s, on the other hand, tended to form [[coal]] and methane. Many of the coal fields date to the [[Carboniferous]] period of [[History of Earth|Earth's history]]. Terrestrial plants also form [[Kerogen#Type III|type III kerogen]], a source of [[natural gas]].

There is a wide range of organic, or hydrocarbon, compounds in any given fuel mixture. The specific mixture of hydrocarbons gives a fuel its characteristic properties, such as boiling point, melting point, density, viscosity, etc. Some fuels like natural gas, for instance, contain only very low boiling, gaseous components. Others such as gasoline or diesel contain much higher boiling components.

Fossil fuels are of great importance because they can be burned ([[oxidized]] to [[carbon dioxide]] and water), producing significant amounts of energy per unit mass. The use of [[coal]] as a fuel predates recorded history. Coal was used to run furnaces for the melting of [[metal ore]]. Semi-solid hydrocarbons from seeps were also burned in ancient times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-50695 |title=Encyclopædia Britannica, use of oil seeps in ancient times|accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these materials were mostly used for waterproofing and [[embalming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Bilkadi| first = Zayn| year =1992| title = BULLS FROM THE SEA : Ancient Oil Industries| publisher = Aramco World|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113215013/http://www.gr8dubai.com/oil2.htm|archivedate=2007-11-13|url=http://www.gr8dubai.com/oil2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial exploitation of [[petroleum]] began in the 19th century, largely to replace oils from animal sources (notably [[whale oil]]) for use in [[oil lamp]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ball |first=Max W. |authorlink= |author2=Douglas Ball |author3=Daniel S. Turner  |title=This Fascinating Oil Business |year=1965 |publisher=Bobbs-Merrill |location=Indianapolis |isbn=0-672-50829-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Natural gas]], once flared-off as an unneeded byproduct of petroleum production, is now considered a very valuable resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = Rashad, Director Oil, Gas, Mining and Chemicals Dept, World Bank  | last = Kaldany | date = December 13, 2006 | title = Global Gas Flaring Reduction: A Time for Action! | conference = Global Forum on Flaring &amp; Gas Utilization | location = Paris | url = http://www.worldbank.org/html/fpd/ggfrforum06/kadany.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2007-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural gas deposits are also the main source of the element [[helium]].

[[Heavy crude oil]], which is much more viscous than conventional crude oil, and [[tar sands]], where [[bitumen]] is found mixed with sand and clay, began to become more important as sources of fossil fuel as of the early  2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.prlog.org/10026386-oil-sands-global-market-potential-2007.html|title=Oil Sands Global Market Potential 2007|accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oil shale]] and similar materials are [[sedimentary]] rocks containing [[kerogen]], a complex mixture of high-molecular weight organic compounds, which yield [[synthetic fuel|synthetic crude oil]] when heated ([[pyrolysis|pyrolyzed]]). These materials had yet to be fully exploited commercially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fossil.energy.gov/programs/reserves/npr/NPR_Oil_Shale_Program.html|title= US Department of Energy plans for oil shale development|accessdate=2007-09-09|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070813012953/http://www.fossil.energy.gov/programs/reserves/npr/NPR_Oil_Shale_Program.html |archivedate = August 13, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; With additional processing, they can be employed in lieu of other already established fossil fuel deposits. More recently, there has been [[disinvestment]] from exploitation of such resources due to their high [[Carbon footprint|carbon cost]], relative to more easily processed reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/12/insurance-giant-axa-dumps-investments-tar-sands-pipelines|title= Insurance giant Axa dumps investments in tar sands pipelines|accessdate=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the latter half of the 18th century, [[windmill]]s and [[watermill]]s provided the energy needed for industry such as milling [[flour]], [[sawmill|sawing wood]] or pumping water, and burning wood or [[peat]] provided domestic heat. The widescale use of fossil fuels, coal at first and petroleum later, to fire [[steam engine]]s enabled the [[Industrial Revolution]]. At the same time, [[Gas lighting|gas lights]] using natural gas or [[coal gas]] were coming into wide use. The invention of the [[internal combustion engine]] and its use in [[automobile]]s and [[truck]]s greatly increased the demand for [[gasoline]] and [[Diesel fuel|diesel oil]], both made from fossil fuels. Other forms of transportation, [[rail transport|railways]] and [[aircraft]], also required fossil fuels. The other major use for fossil fuels is in [[Electrical power industry|generating electricity]] and as [[feedstock]] for the [[petrochemical industry]]. [[Tar]], a leftover of petroleum extraction, is used in [[road construction|construction of roads]].

==Limits and alternatives==
{{Main|Peak oil|Hubbert peak theory|Renewable energy|Energy development}}

P. E. Hodgson, a senior research fellow emeritus in physics at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, expects the world energy use is doubling every fourteen years and the need is increasing faster still and he insisted in 2008 that the world oil production, a main resource of fossil fuel, is expected to peak in ten years and thereafter fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hodgson|first=P.E|title=Nuclear Power and Energy Crisis|journal=Modern Age|year=2008|volume=50|issue=3|page=238|url=http://www.firstprinciplesjournal.com/articles.aspx?article=1110&amp;loc=qs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle of [[supply and demand]] holds that as hydrocarbon supplies diminish, prices will rise. Therefore, higher prices will lead to increased alternative, [[renewable energy]] supplies as previously uneconomic sources become sufficiently economical to exploit. Artificial gasolines and other [[renewable energy]] sources currently require more expensive production and processing technologies than conventional [[petroleum reserves]], but may become economically viable in the near future.
Different [[alternative energy|alternative sources of energy]] include [[Nuclear power|nuclear]], [[hydroelectric]], [[Solar energy|solar]], [[wind energy|wind]], and [[Geothermal power|geothermal]].

One of the more promising energy alternatives is the use of inedible feed stocks and biomass for carbon dioxide capture as well as biofuel. While these processes are not without problems, they are currently in practice around the world. Biodiesels are being produced by several companies and source of great research at several universities. Some of the most common and promising processes of conversion of renewable lipids into usable fuels is through [[hydrotreating]] and [[renewable fuels by decarboxylation|decarboxylation]].

==Environmental effects==

{{Main|Environmental impact of the coal industry}}

The United States holds less than 5% of the world's population, but due to large houses and private cars, uses more than 25% of the world's supply of fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The State of Consumption Today|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/810|publisher=Worldwatch Institute|accessdate=March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the largest source of U.S. [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, CO2 from fossil fuel combustion, accounted for 80 percent of [its] weighted emissions in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-12/documents/00es.pdfl Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–1998], Rep. EPA 236-R-00-01. US EPA, Washington, DC|accessdate=2017-12-24&lt;/ref&gt; Combustion of fossil fuels also produces other air pollutants, such as [[nitrogen oxides]], [[sulfur dioxide]], [[volatile organic compounds]] and [[heavy metals]].

According to Environment Canada:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The [[electricity industry|electricity sector]] is unique among industrial sectors in its very large contribution to emissions associated with nearly all air issues. Electricity generation produces a large share of Canadian nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide emissions, which contribute to smog and [[acid rain]] and the formation of fine particulate matter. It is the largest uncontrolled industrial source of mercury emissions in Canada. Fossil fuel-fired electric power plants also emit [[carbon dioxide]], which may contribute to climate change. In addition, the sector has significant impacts on water and habitat and species. In particular, [[hydropower]] [[dam]]s and [[transmission line]]s have significant effects on water and [[biodiversity]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/energie-energy/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=C00AD28F-1|title=Electricity Generation|accessdate=2007-03-23|work=Environment Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Carbon Dioxide 400kyr.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Carbon dioxide variations over the last 400,000 years, showing a rise since the industrial revolution]]
According to U.S. Scientist Jerry Mahlman and USA Today: Mahlman, who crafted the IPCC language used to define levels of scientific certainty, says the new report will lay the blame at the feet of fossil fuels with "virtual certainty," meaning 99% sure. That's a significant jump from "likely," or 66% sure, in the group's last report in 2001, Mahlman says. His role in this year's effort involved spending two months reviewing the more than 1,600 pages of research that went into the new assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2007-01-30-ipcc-report_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Fossil fuels are to blame, world scientists conclude | first1=Patrick | last1=O'Driscoll | first2=Dan | last2=Vergano | date=2007-03-01 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combustion of fossil fuels generates [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric]], [[carbonic acid|carbonic]], and [[nitric acid]]s, which fall to Earth as acid rain, impacting both natural areas and the built environment. Monuments and sculptures made from [[marble]] and [[limestone]] are particularly vulnerable, as the acids dissolve [[calcium carbonate]].

Fossil fuels also contain radioactive materials, mainly [[uranium]] and [[thorium]], which are released into the atmosphere. In 2000, about 12,000 [[tonnes]] of thorium and 5,000 tonnes of uranium were released worldwide from burning coal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev26-34/text/colmain.html Coal Combustion: Nuclear Resource or Danger] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205103749/http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev26-34/text/colmain.html |date=February 5, 2007 }} – Alex Gabbard&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that during 1982, US coal burning released 155 times as much radioactivity into the atmosphere as the [[Three Mile Island accident]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~aubrecht/coalvsnucMarcon.pdf#page=8 Nuclear proliferation through coal burning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327101806/http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~aubrecht/coalvsnucMarcon.pdf |date=2009-03-27 }} – Gordon J. Aubrecht, II, Ohio State University&lt;/ref&gt;

Burning coal also generates large amounts of [[bottom ash]] and [[fly ash]]. These materials are used in a wide variety of [[Fly ash#Fly ash reuse|applications]], utilizing, for example, about 40% of the US production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = American Coal Ash Association| title = CCP Production and Use Survey| url = http://acaa.affiniscape.com/associations/8003/files/2004_CCP_Survey(9-9-05).pdf| format = PDF}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvesting, processing, and distributing fossil fuels can also create environmental concerns. [[Coal mining]] methods, particularly [[mountaintop removal mining|mountaintop removal]] and [[strip mining]], have negative environmental impacts, and [[offshore drilling|offshore oil drilling]] poses a hazard to aquatic organisms. [[Oil refinery|Oil refineries]] also have negative environmental impacts, including air and water pollution. Transportation of coal requires the use of diesel-powered locomotives, while crude oil is typically transported by tanker ships, each of which requires the combustion of additional fossil fuels.

[[Environmental regulation]] uses a variety of approaches to limit these emissions, such as command-and-control (which mandates the amount of pollution or the technology used), economic incentives, or voluntary programs.

An example of such regulation in the USA is the "EPA is implementing policies to reduce airborne mercury emissions. Under regulations issued in 2005, coal-fired power plants will need to reduce their emissions by 70 percent by 2018.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/promotions/change_light/downloads/Fact_Sheet_Mercury.pdf|format=PDF|title=Frequently Asked Questions, Information on Proper Disposal of Compact Fluorescent Light Bulbs (CFLs)|accessdate=2007-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In economic terms, pollution from fossil fuels is regarded as a negative [[externality]]. Taxation is considered one way to make societal costs explicit, in order to 'internalize' the cost of pollution. This aims to make fossil fuels more expensive, thereby reducing their use and the amount of pollution associated with them, along with raising the funds necessary to counteract these factors.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

According to Rodman D. Griffin, "The burning of coal and oil have saved inestimable amounts of time and labor while substantially raising living standards around the world".&lt;ref name="CQ Researcher"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Griffin|first=Rodman|title=Alternative Energy|date=10 July 1992|volume=2|issue=2|pages=573–596}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the use of fossil fuels may seem beneficial to our lives, this act is playing a role on global warming and it is said to be dangerous for the future.&lt;ref name="CQ Researcher"/&gt;

Moreover, these environmental pollutions impacts on the human beings because its particles of the fossil fuel on the air cause negative health effects when inhaled by people. These health effects include premature death, acute respiratory illness, aggravated asthma, chronic bronchitis and decreased lung function. So, the poor, undernourished, very young and very old, and people with preexisting respiratory disease and other ill health, are more at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liodakis|first=E|title=The nuclear alternative|journal=Energy Production within Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia|year=2011|volume=1342|issue=1|page=91|doi=10.1063/1.3583174|series=AIP Conference Proceedings|last2=Dashdorj|first2=Dugersuren|last3=Mitchell|first3=Gary E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic effects===
Europe spent €406 billion on importing fossil fuels in 2011 and €545 billion in 2012. This is around three times more than the cost of the [[European Financial Stability Facility#Greek bailout|Greek bailout]] up to 2013. In 2012 [[wind energy in Europe]] avoided €9.6 billion of fossil fuel costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewea.org/fileadmin/files/library/publications/reports/Avoiding_fossil_fuel_costs.pdf  Avoiding fossil fuel costs with wind energy] [[EWEA]] March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 report by the [[International Energy Agency]] said that the fossil fuels industry collects $550 billion a year in global government [[fossil fuel subsidies]].&lt;ref name=taxrebate2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-musk-subsidies-20150602-story.html |title=Elon Musk: 'If I cared about subsidies, I would have entered the oil and gas industry' |author= Jerry Hirsch|date=2 June 2015|work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=29 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--direct source preferred--&gt; This amount was  $490 billion in 2014, but would have been $610 billion without agreements made in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/media/weowebsite/2015/WEO2015_Factsheets.pdf|title=World Energy Outlook|author=|date=|website=www.worldenergyoutlook.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 report studied 20 fossil fuel companies and found that, while highly profitable, the hidden economic cost to society was also large.&lt;ref name="hope-etal-2015"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The report spans the period 2008–2012 and notes that: "For all companies and all years, the economic cost to society of their {{CO2}} emissions was greater than their after‐tax profit, with the single exception of [[ExxonMobil]] in 2008."&lt;ref name="hope-etal-2015"/&gt;{{rp|4}}  Pure coal companies fare even worse: "the economic cost to society exceeds total revenue in all years, with this cost varying between nearly $2 and nearly $9 per $1 of revenue."&lt;ref name="hope-etal-2015"/&gt;{{rp|5}}  In this case, total revenue includes "employment, taxes, supply purchases, and indirect employment."&lt;ref name="hope-etal-2015"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

'''''Gagetown''''' is a 2009 [[documentary film]] that looks into the massive [[defoliant]] spray program that was used at [[CFB Gagetown]] since 1956. The chemical [[herbicides]] used include
50/50 mixtures of [[2,4-D]]/ [[2,4,5-T]], and [[Tordon 101]], also known as [[Agent Orange]] and [[Agent White]]. 

These chemicals have been known to produce extremely toxic byproducts, including [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]] and [[hexachlorobenzene]]s.

Exposure to these byproducts has been linked to increased cases in [[cancer]] and [[blood diseases]], especially [[Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma]] and [[leukemia]].

According to a Canadian Department of National Defence document acquired through the Access to Information Act, over 3.2 million liters and kilograms of chemical defoliants 
were used at the base between the years 1956 to 1984.

'''''Game Wars''''' is a 1991 non-fiction book by [[Marc Reisner]] which gives accounts of several [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] sting operations.  First published in 1991, the book centers on undercover agent Dave Hall as he infiltrates groups of [[poacher]]s and gathers evidence to prosecute them.  The three chapters of the book focus on poaching of [[alligators]] in [[Louisiana]], [[ivory]] in [[Alaska]], and [[crappie|sacalait]] in the [[Southern United States]].  The book highlights the debate over whether declines in wildlife populations should be attributed to over-hunting or loss of habitat.  The book also highlights and details several cases and operations that Special Agent Hall conducted along with [[game warden]]s from the [[Louisiana Department of Wildlife &amp; Fisheries – Enforcement Division]].

The title was reviewed in ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-08-04/entertainment/9103250546_1_undercover-pursuit-game-wars-wildlife-poachers|date=1991-08-04|accessdate=2014-12-27|first1=Rick|last1=Bass|publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]|title=Under Fire At The Environmental Battlefront}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Rough translation|German|Deutsch|date=September 2018|listed=yes}}

'''Gliding''' is an [[energy-efficient driving]] operating mode of a [[motor vehicle]] that involves turning off the [[internal combustion engine]] while the vehicle is still moving in order to save fuel. This is differentiated from '''coasting''', which is running the vehicle in idle mode by disengaging the engine from the wheels, either by disengaging the clutch or setting the transmission or gearbox to neutral position.&lt;ref name="reif"&gt;Konrad Reif, Karl E. Noreikat, Kai Borgeest: ''Kraftfahrzeug-Hybridantriebe''.&lt;/ref&gt; Coasting uses the accelerated [[kinetic energy]] to keep the vehicle going, but loses speed to the existing drag. This functionality is integral to the concept of [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s and is performed automatically by the engine controller. For vehicles with a conventional internal combustion engine, coasting can be performed manually; gliding requires having a gear box.&lt;ref name="bosch"&gt;[http://www.bosch-presse.de/presseforum/details.htm?txtID=5287 bosch-presse.de] ''Erweitertes Start/Stopp-System von Bosch spart noch mehr Kraftstoff'', retrieved 14 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It is illegal in some states. An extra button to stop the engine was shown in 1979 on [[International Motor Show Germany]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PrYpRUcc4s#t=36m44s ''IAA 1979 - Porsche 928 S''], uploaded 11 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; but newer standard in any vehicle. A so-called ''eClutch'' (electronic controlled clutch) uses an [[actuator]] to disengage the clutch when the driver leaves the accelerator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://presseservice.pressrelations.de/pressemitteilung/die-eclutch-spart-sprit-und-erhoeht-den-komfort-541345.html pressrelations.de] ''Die eClutch spart Sprit und erhöht den Komfort'', retrieved 19 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[start-stop system]] turns the engine off when the vehicle is stopped. Gliding is turning off the engine while the vehicle is still moving. Safety relevant components like [[power steering]] or [[vacuum servo]] required to be operated electric, but most vehicles drive it by the combustion engine, only. The fuel saving is depending more on the road and traffic conditions, and less on the altitude profile of the road. It is assumed to save up to 7% fuel in the NEFZ [[driving cycle]]; in real road traffic conditions, the savings is estimated to be  up to 10%.

== Coasting ==
Idle coasting is driving the vehicle at a higher speed than the idle speed of the engine and then disengaging the engine from the wheels by setting the transmission or gearbox to neutral position or disengaging the clutch, maintaining the engine in idle mode.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/pressclub/p/de/pressDetail.html?title=bmw-modellpflege-ma%C3%9Fnahmen-zum-sommer-2013&amp;outputChannelId=7&amp;id=T0141144DE&amp;left_menu_item=node__2223 bmwgroup.com] Publication to the Press on 6 May 2013, retrieved 15 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.porsche.com/microsite/ipad/assets/downloads/kataloge/de/911.pdf porsche.com] (PDF; 10,7&amp;nbsp;MB) 911, retrieved 15 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BMW offers gliding on [[manual transmission]]s, Porsche on [[dual-clutch transmission]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gliding a conventional vehicle ==
Pushing the clutch pedal disengages the engine from the powertrain like wheels, drive shafts and gearbox. Releasing the accelerator makes the engine slow down to idle. Turning off the ignition has further effects. Pulling the key causes locking the steering wheel. Some vehicles drop headlights or breaklights when the ignition is turned off. After the engine is stopped, applying the brake takes a longer time or giving a few pushes to the brake releases the reserve of the [[vacuum servo]], causing a loss of the brake support. A belt-driven [[power steering]] fails immediately. Real hybrid vehicles have electric-driven support of power steering and brake. Bigger engines and engines with higher [[compression ratio]] can cause damage to components of the [[powertrain]] at a rough start over clutch from gliding vehicles kinetic power or trailing drag. Using a higher gear decreases the torque force on the powertrain. By turning off the ignition the [[engine control unit]] (ECU) needs to detect the engine shafts position. Some ECUs need several rotations of the [[camshaft]] to detect ignition and injection timing points. Starting the engine in [[Cold start (automotive)|coldstart]] temporarily takes more fuel until operation temperature of the engine is detected by the ECU.

Gliding vehicles equipped with [[torque converter]]-based [[automatic transmission]]s might cause damage. Also restarting the engine by clutch from the vehicle's kinetic energy or drag is not possible. It is required to use the [[Starter (engine)|starter]].

{{For|the pipeline between the UK and Belgium named Interconnector|Interconnector (North Sea)}}

An '''interconnector''' is a structure which enables energy to flow between networks. The term is used more specifically to refer to international connections between [[Electric power transmission|electricity]] and [[Natural gas pipeline|natural gas networks]].

==Economy==
Interconnectors allow the [[Trade|trading]] of energy between territories. For example, the [[Interconnector (North Sea)|North Sea Interconnector]] allows the trading of natural gas between the UK and Belgium&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21897715&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[East–West Interconnector]] allows the trading of electricity between the UK and the [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. A territory which generates more energy than it requires for its own activities can therefore sell surplus energy to a neighbouring territory.

Interconnectors also provide increased [[Energy_development#Resilience|resilience]]. Within the [[European Union]] there is a movement towards a [[single market]] for energy, which makes interconnectors viable.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, http://ec.europa.eu/energy/gas_electricity/internal_market_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the Nordic and Baltic energy exchange [[Nord Pool Spot]] rely on multiple interconnectors. The fullest possible implementation of this is the proposed [[European super grid]] which would include numerous interconnectors between national networks.

==Infrastructure==
Interconnectors may run across a land border or connect two land areas separated by water.

The '''Jersey-Atlantic Wind Farm''' in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], in [[Atlantic County, New Jersey|Atlantic County]], [[New Jersey]], is the first coastal [[wind farm]] in the United States and the first wind farm in New Jersey.  It became operational in March 2006&lt;ref name="Infigen Energy"&gt;{{cite web|title=4th Annual Australian Microcap Investment Conference|url=http://www.infigenenergy.com/media/docs/Presentation-to-the-Australian-Microcap-Investment-Conference-8a218fe5-292a-416b-865c-e9ba66dcfa40-0.pdf|work=Infigen Energy website|publisher=Infigen Energy|pages=28|date=22 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191856/http://www.infigenenergy.com/media/docs/Presentation-to-the-Australian-Microcap-Investment-Conference-8a218fe5-292a-416b-865c-e9ba66dcfa40-0.pdf|archivedate=29 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and consists of five 1.5 [[Megawatt|MW]] turbines built by [[General Electric]].

The wind farm is located at the [[Atlantic County Utilities Authority|Atlantic County Utilities Authority (ACUA)]] Wastewater Treatment Plant on [[U.S. Route 30 in New Jersey|US 30]] and is visible from highways approaching [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]].  The treatment plant uses approximately 50% of the wind-generated capacity from the wind turbines, providing about 60% of the wastewater plant's electricity needs, with the remaining energy being provided to the main power grid for resale as premium renewable electricity.

'''Krypton''' (from {{lang-grc|κρυπτός|translit=kryptos}} "the hidden one") is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&amp;nbsp;'''Kr''' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;36. It is a member of [[Noble gas|group 18 (noble gases)]] elements. A colorless, odorless, tasteless [[noble gas]], krypton occurs in [[Trace element|trace amounts]] in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and is often used with other rare gases in [[fluorescent lamp]]s. With rare exceptions, krypton is chemically [[Chemically inert|inert]].

Krypton, like the other [[noble gases]], is used in lighting and [[photography]]. Krypton light has many [[spectral lines]], and krypton [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] is useful in bright, high-powered gas lasers (krypton ion and  [[excimer laser]]s), each of which resonates and amplifies a single spectral line. [[krypton fluoride laser|Krypton fluoride]] also makes a useful laser medium. From 1960 to 1983, the official length of a [[metre|meter]] was defined by the 605&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength of the orange spectral line of krypton-86, because of the high power and relative ease of operation of krypton discharge tubes.

==History==
[[File:William Ramsay working.jpg|thumb|left|Sir William Ramsay, the discoverer of Krypton]]
Krypton was discovered in [[Great Britain|Britain]] in 1898 by [[William Ramsay|Sir William Ramsay]], a Scottish chemist, and [[Morris Travers]], an English chemist, in residue left from evaporating nearly all components of liquid air. [[Neon]] was discovered by a similar procedure by the same workers just a few weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 1960, the [[Bureau International des Poids et Mesures|International Conference on Weights and Measures]] defined the meter as 1,650,763.73 [[wavelength]]s of light emitted by the krypton-86 [[isotope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The BIPM and the evolution of the definition of the metre|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/measurement-units/history-si/evolution-metre.html|publisher=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures|date=2014-07-26|accessdate=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Time Line for the Definition of the Meter|url=https://www.nist.gov/pml/div683/museum-timeline.cfm|first=William B.|last=Penzes |date=2009-01-08|accessdate=2016-06-23|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; This agreement replaced the 1889 international prototype meter located in [[Paris]], which was a metal bar made of a [[platinum]]-[[iridium]] alloy (one of a series of standard meter bars, originally constructed to be one ten-millionth of a quadrant of the [[Earth]]'s polar circumference). This also obsoleted the 1927 definition of the [[ångström]] based on the red [[cadmium]] spectral line,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=On the new determination of the meter |journal=Measurement Techniques |volume=1 |issue=3 |date=1958 |doi=10.1007/BF00974680 |pages=259–264 |first=G.

==Characteristics==
Krypton is characterized by several sharp emission lines ([[spectral signature]]s) the strongest being green and yellow.&lt;ref name=colours&gt;{{cite web|url=http://astro.u-strasbg.fr/~koppen/discharge/|title=Spectra of Gas Discharges}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krypton is one of the products of [[uranium]] [[nuclear fission|fission]].&lt;ref name=ANL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ead.anl.gov/pub/doc/krypton.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mA1KLs2g?url=http://www.ead.anl.gov/pub/doc/krypton.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-20 |title=Krypton |accessdate=2007-03-17 |date=2005 |publisher=Argonne National Laboratory, EVS |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Solid krypton is white and has a face-centered [[Cubic (crystal system)|cubic]] [[crystal structure]], which is a common property of all noble gases (except [[helium]], which has a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure).

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of krypton}}
Naturally occurring krypton in Earth's atmosphere is composed of five [[Stable nuclide|stable]] [[isotopes]], plus one isotope (&lt;sup&gt;78&lt;/sup&gt;Kr) with such a long [[half-life]] (9.2×10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;years) that it can be considered stable. (This isotope has the second-longest known half-life among all isotopes for which decay has been observed; it undergoes [[double electron capture]] to &lt;sup&gt;78&lt;/sup&gt;[[selenium|Se]]).&lt;ref name=Patrignani2016/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gavrilyuk |first1=Yu. M. |last2=Gangapshev |first2=A. M. |last3=Kazalov |first3=V. V. |last4=Kuzminov |first4=V. V. |last5=Panasenko |first5=S. I. |last6=Ratkevich |first6=S.

Krypton is highly volatile and does not stay in solution in near-surface [[water]], but &lt;sup&gt;81&lt;/sup&gt;Kr has been used for dating old (50,000–800,000 years) [[groundwater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/809813-0zMCV1/native/809813.pdf |title=Development of Laser-Based Resonance Ionization Techniques for 81-Kr and 85-Kr Measurements in the Geosciences |accessdate=2007-03-20 |last=Thonnard |first=Norbert |author2=Larry D. MeKay |author3=Theodore C. Labotka  |date=2001-02-05 |publisher=University of Tennessee, Institute for Rare Isotope Measurements |pages=4–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Krypton-85|&lt;sup&gt;85&lt;/sup&gt;Kr]] is an inert radioactive noble gas with a half-life of 10.76 years. It is produced by the [[nuclear fission|fission]] of [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]], such as in [[nuclear bomb]] testing and [[nuclear reactor]]s. &lt;sup&gt;85&lt;/sup&gt;Kr is released during the reprocessing of [[fuel rod]]s from nuclear reactors. Concentrations at the [[North Pole]] are 30% higher than at the [[South Pole]] due to convective mixing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwwrcamnl.wr.usgs.gov/isoig/period/kr_iig.html |title=Resources on Isotopes |accessdate=2007-03-20 |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemistry===
[[File:Krypton hydride crystal.jpg|thumb|left|Kr(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solids formed in a [[diamond anvil cell]].&lt;ref name=KrH/&gt;]]
[[File:Krypton hydride structure.png|thumb|left|Structure of Kr(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Krypton octahedra (green) are surrounded by randomly oriented hydrogen molecules.&lt;ref name=KrH/&gt;]]

Like the other noble gases, krypton is highly chemically unreactive. The rather restricted chemistry of krypton in its only known nonzero oxidation state of +2 parallels that of the neighboring element [[bromine]] in the +1 oxidation state; due to the [[scandide contraction]] it is difficult to oxidize the 4p elements to their group oxidation states. Before the 1960s, no noble gas compounds had been synthesized.&lt;ref name=S&amp;E&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/80th/noblegases.html|title=The Noble Gases|accessdate=2006-07-02 |last=Bartlett |first=Neil |date=2003|publisher=Chemical &amp; Engineering News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, following the first successful synthesis of [[xenon]] compounds in 1962, synthesis of [[krypton difluoride]] ({{chem|KrF|2}}) was reported in 1963. In the same year, {{chem|KrF|4}} was reported by Grosse, ''et al.'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.139.3559.1047 | title = Krypton Tetrafluoride: Preparation and Some Properties | year = 1963 | last1 = Grosse | first1 = A.

::Kr + F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → KrF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Compounds with krypton bonded to atoms other than [[fluorine]] have also been discovered. There are also unverified reports of a [[barium]] [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] of a krypton [[oxoacid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.143.3603.242| pmid = 17753149| year = 1964| last1 = Streng | first1 = A.| last2 = Grosse | first2 = A.| title = Acid of Krypton and Its Barium Salt| volume = 143| issue = 3603| pages = 242–243| journal = Science |bibcode = 1964Sci...143..242S }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[argon|Ar]]Kr&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Kr[[hydrogen|H]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; [[polyatomic ions]] have been investigated and there is evidence for Kr[[xenon|Xe]] or KrXe&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bu.edu/ehs/ih/pdf/periodic_table.pdf |title=Periodic Table of the Elements|accessdate=2007-04-05 |publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory's Chemistry Division |pages=100–101 |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20061125134307/http://www.bu.edu/ehs/ih/pdf/periodic_table.pdf |archivedate = November 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reaction of {{chem|KrF|2}} with {{chem|B(OTeF|5|)|3}} produces an unstable compound, {{chem|Kr(OTeF|5|)|2}}, that contains a krypton-[[oxygen]] bond. A krypton-[[nitrogen]] bond is found in the [[cation]] [HC≡N–Kr–F]{{su|p=+}}, produced by the reaction of {{chem|KrF|2}} with [HC≡NH]{{su|p=+}}[AsF{{su|b=6|p=−}}] below −50&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Advances in Inorganic Chemistry|author = Holloway, John H. |author2 = Hope, Eric G. |editor = Sykes, A.

===Natural occurrence===
Earth has retained all of the noble gases that were present at its formation except [[helium]]. Krypton's concentration in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] is about 1 [[part per million|ppm]]. It can be extracted from liquid air by [[fractional distillation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-4/Krypton.html|title=How Products are Made: Krypton|accessdate=2006-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of krypton in space is uncertain, because measurement is derived from meteoric activity and solar winds. The first measurements suggest an abundance of krypton in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Abundance of Interstellar Krypton|volume=477|last=Cardelli|first=Jason A.|year=1996|publisher=[[The American Astronomical Society]]|pages=L57–L60|doi=10.1086/310513|author2=Meyer, David M.|work=The [[Astrophysical Journal]] Letters|bibcode=1997ApJ...477L..57C}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2007-04-05 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:KrTube.jpg|left|thumb|Krypton gas discharge tube]]
Krypton's multiple emission lines make ionized krypton gas discharges appear whitish, which in turn makes krypton-based bulbs useful in photography as a brilliant white light source. Krypton is used in some photographic flashes for high speed [[photography]]. Krypton gas is also combined with other gases to make luminous signs that glow with a bright greenish-yellow light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capecodextension.org/pdfs/Mercury%20Lighting.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929085332/http://www.capecodextension.org/pdfs/Mercury%20Lighting.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-09-29 |title=Mercury in Lighting |accessdate=2007-03-20 |publisher=Cape Cod Cooperative Extension }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krypton is mixed with [[argon]] in energy efficient fluorescent lamps, reducing the power consumption, but also reducing the light output and raising the cost.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100912181537/http://www.anaheim.net/utilities/ea/PA_11.html Lighting: Full-Size Fluorescent Lamps]. McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Krypton costs about 100 times as much as argon. Krypton (along with xenon) is also used to fill incandescent lamps to reduce filament evaporation and allow higher [[operating temperature]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uigi.com/rare_gases.html Properties, Applications and Uses of the "Rare Gases" Neon, Krypton and Xenon].

Krypton's white discharge is often used to good effect in colored gas discharge tubes, which are simply painted or stained to create the desired color (for example, "[[neon]]" type multi-colored advertising signs are often entirely krypton-based). Krypton produces much higher light power than neon in the red spectral line region, and for this reason, red lasers for high-power laser light-shows are often krypton lasers with mirrors that select the red spectral line for laser amplification and emission, rather than the more familiar helium-neon variety, which could not achieve the same multi-watt outputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameops.com/content/pdf/laser_terms.pdf|title=Laser Devices, Laser Shows and Effect|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-04-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221093633/http://www.gameops.com/content/pdf/laser_terms.pdf|archive-date=2007-02-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[krypton fluoride laser]] is important in nuclear fusion energy research in confinement experiments. The [[laser]] has high beam uniformity, short [[wavelength]], and the spot size can be varied to track an imploding pellet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aries.ucsd.edu/LIB/MEETINGS/IAEAIFECRP/PDF/Sethian.pdf |title=Krypton Fluoride Laser Development for Inertial Fusion Energy |accessdate=2007-03-20 |last=Sethian |first=J. |author2=M.

In experimental [[particle physics]], liquid krypton is used to construct quasi-homogeneous electromagnetic [[Calorimeter (particle physics)|calorimeters]]. A notable example is the calorimeter of the [[NA48]] experiment at [[CERN]] containing about 27 [[tonne]]s of liquid krypton. This usage is rare, since liquid [[argon]] is less expensive. The advantage of krypton is a smaller [[Molière radius]] of 4.7&amp;nbsp;cm, which provides excellent spatial resolution with little overlapping. The other parameters relevant for calorimetry are: [[radiation length]] of X&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=4.7&amp;nbsp;cm, and density of 2.4&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

The sealed spark gap assemblies in ignition exciters in some older jet engines contain a small amount of krypton-85 to produce consistent ionization levels and uniform operation.

Krypton-83 has application in [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) for imaging airways. In particular, it enables the radiologist to distinguish between [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] and hydrophilic surfaces containing an airway.&lt;ref name="Pavlovskaya"&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=4 |author=Pavlovskaya, GE |author2=Cleveland, ZI |author3=Stupic, KF |author4=Basaraba, RJ |author5=Meersmann, T |title=Hyperpolarized krypton-83 as a contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=102 |issue=51 |pages=18275–9 |date=2005|pmid=16344474 |pmc=1317982 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0509419102|bibcode = 2005PNAS..10218275P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although xenon has potential for use in [[computed tomography]] (CT) to assess regional ventilation, its anesthetic properties limit its fraction in the breathing gas to 35%. A breathing mixture of 30% xenon and 30% krypton is comparable in effectiveness for CT to a 40% xenon fraction, while avoiding the unwanted effects of a high partial pressure of xenon gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=4 |author=Chon, D |author2=Beck, KC |author3=Simon, BA |author4=Shikata, H |author5=Saba, OI |author6=Hoffman, EA |title=Effect of low-xenon and krypton supplementation on signal/noise of regional CT-based ventilation measurements |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology |volume=102 |issue=4 |pages=1535–44 |date=2007 |pmid=17122371 |doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.01235.2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[metastable isotope]] krypton-81m is used in [[nuclear medicine]] for lung [[ventilation/perfusion scan]]s, where it is inhaled and imaged with a [[gamma camera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bajc|first1=M.|last2=Neilly|first2=J.

Krypton-85 in the atmosphere has been used to detect clandestine nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities in [[North Korea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-6961236.html|title = N.

Krypton is used occasionally as an insulating gas between window panes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ayre|first1=James|title=Insulated Windows 101 — Double Glazing, Triple Glazing, Thermal Performance, &amp; Potential Problems|url=https://cleantechnica.com/2018/04/28/insulated-windows-101-double-glazing-triple-glazing-thermal-performance-potential-problems/|website=cleantechnica.com|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precautions==
Krypton is considered to be a non-toxic [[asphyxiant gas|asphyxiant]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pt.chemicalstore.com/Kr%20-%20Krypton.html Properties of Krypton] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219024551/http://pt.chemicalstore.com/Kr%20-%20Krypton.html |date=2009-02-19 }}. Pt.chemicalstore.com. Retrieved on 2015-11-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Krypton has a [[narcotic]] potency seven times greater than air, and breathing an atmosphere of 50% krypton and 50% natural air (as might happen in the locality of a leak) causes narcosis in humans similar to breathing air at four times atmospheric pressure. This is comparable to scuba diving at a depth of {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} (see [[nitrogen narcosis]]) and could affect anyone breathing it. At the same time, that mixture would contain only 10% oxygen (rather than the normal 20%) and [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] would be a greater concern.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9525">This is a selected list of the oldest [[river]]s on Earth for which there is knowledge about their existence in past times.

== Determination of age ==
Generally, the age is estimated based primarily upon the age of any mountains it '''dissects'''; the age of the [[sea]] or [[ocean]] to which it eventually outflows can be irrelevant; for example, several rivers of the east side of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], which did not exist 130 million years ago. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}} If a river fully dissects a mountain range, then this generally indicates that the river existed at least at the time that the mountain range rose.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2195">The '''mass-flux fraction''' (or '''Hirschfelder-Curtiss variable''' or '''Kármán-Penner variable''') is the ratio of mass-flux of a particular chemical species to the total mass flux. It includes both the convectional mass flux and diffusional mass flux. It was introduced by [[Joseph O. Hirschfelder]] and [[:de:Charles Francis Curtiss|Charles F. Curtiss]] in 1948&lt;ref&gt;Hirschfelder, J. O., &amp; Curtiss, C. F. (1948, January). Theory of propagation of flames. Part I: General equations. In Symposium on Combustion and Flame, and Explosion Phenomena (Vol. 3, No. 1, pp. 121-127). Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt; and later by [[Theodore von Kármán]] and [[Sol Penner]] in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;von Karman, T., &amp; Penner, S. S. (1954). Fundamental approach to laminar flame propagation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;von Karman, T., &amp; Penner, S. S. (1954). The thermal theory of constant-pressure deflagration for first-order global reactions.&lt;/ref&gt; The mass-flux fraction of species i is defined as&lt;ref&gt;Williams, F. A. (2018). Combustion theory. CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_i = \frac{\rho_i (v+ V_i)}{\rho v} = Y_i\left(1+\frac{V_i}{v}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt;Y_i=\rho_i/\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Mass fraction (chemistry)|mass fraction]]
*&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the mass average velocity of the gaseous mixture
*&lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt; is the average velocity with which the species i diffuse relative to &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\rho_i&lt;/math&gt; is the density of species i
*&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the gas density.

It satisfies the identity

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_i \epsilon_i =1&lt;/math&gt;

similar to mass fraction, but, the mass-flux fraction can take positive and negative values. This variable is used in steady, one-dimensional [[combustion]] problems in place of mass fraction.&lt;ref&gt;Penner, S. S. (1957). Chemistry problems in jet propulsion (Vol. 1). Pergamon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For one-dimensional (&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; direction) steady flows, the conservation equation for the mass-flux fraction reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\epsilon_i}{dx} = \frac{w_i}{\rho v}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; is the mass production rate of species i.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3835">'''Metal hydride fuel cells''' are a subclass of [[alkaline]] [[fuel cell]]s that are in the research and development phase. A notable feature is their ability to [[Chemical bond|chemically bond]] and [[Hydrogen storage|store hydrogen]] within the cell. This feature is shared with [[direct borohydride fuel cell]]s, although the two differ in that MHFCs are refueled with pure hydrogen. Though the absorption characteristic of metal hydrides (around 2%) is far lower than sodium-borohydrides and other "light" metal hydrides (around 10.8%),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3012/is_10_183/ai_109505535]&lt;/ref&gt; prototypes have been claimed to demonstrate a number of interesting characteristics:
* The ability to be recharged with electrical energy (similar to [[Nickel metal hydride battery|NiMH batteries]]);
* Low operating temperatures (down to −20°C);
* Fast kinetics;
* Extended shelf life;
* Fast "cold start" properties;
* Ability to operate for limited periods of time with no external hydrogen source, enabling "hot swapping" of fuel canisters.

Metal hydrides fuel cells are being researched by ECD Ovonics, as well as by the Japanese [[National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology]] (AIST). Though similar, the two MHFC concepts use different catalysts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ovonic.com/PDFs/fuel_cell/fuel-cell-report_ovonic-fuel-cell_mar05_reprint.pdf][http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V3F-44PKMJ2-1&amp;_coverDate=09%2F30%2F2002&amp;_alid=426776402&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_qd=1&amp;_cdi=5729&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=970b74a00a609e7e2a5cdd1d5b3aa6a7]&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus far, neither research project has produced a demonstrable model outside of a laboratory – only publications and patents – and significant efficiency hurdles have yet to be overcome. The Ovonics and AIST metal hydride fuel cells claim current densities of 250&amp;nbsp;mA/cm² and 20&amp;nbsp;mA/cm², respectively, versus typical [[PEMFC]] performance at 1&amp;nbsp;A/cm².

'''Molybdenum disulfide''' is an [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic compound]] composed of [[molybdenum]] and [[sulfur]]. Its [[chemical formula]] is '''{{chem|MoS|2}}'''.

The compound is classified as a [[transition metal dichalcogenide]]. It is a silvery black solid that occurs as the mineral [[molybdenite]], the principal ore for molybdenum.&lt;ref name=ullmann&gt;Sebenik, Roger F. ''et al''. (2005) "Molybdenum and Molybdenum Compounds", ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology''. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI| 10.1002/14356007.a16_655}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{chem|MoS|2}} is relatively unreactive. It is unaffected by dilute [[acid]]s and [[oxygen]]. In appearance and feel, molybdenum di[[sulfide]] is similar to [[graphite]]. It is widely used as a [[dry lubricant]] because of its low [[friction]] and robustness.  Bulk {{chem|MoS|2}} is a diamagnetic, [[indirect bandgap]] semiconductor similar to [[silicon]], with a bandgap of 1.23 eV.&lt;ref name=band/&gt;

== Production ==
[[File:Molly Hill molybdenite.JPG|thumb|left|Molybdenite]]MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is naturally found as either [[molybdenite]], a crystalline mineral, or jordisite, a rare low temperature form of molybdenite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mindat.org/min-2114.html|title=Jordesite on Mindat.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molybdenite ore is processed by [[Froth flotation|flotation]] to give relatively pure {{chem|MoS|2}}. The main contaminant is carbon. {{chem|MoS|2}} also arises by thermal treatment of virtually all molybdenum compounds with [[hydrogen sulfide]] or elemental sulfur and can be produced by metathesis reactions from [[molybdenum pentachloride]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Murphy, Donald W. |author2= Interrante, Leonard V. | year = 1995 | title = Metathetical Precursor Route to Molybdenum Disulfide  | volume = 30 | pages = 33–37 | doi = 10.1002/9780470132616.ch8 |series= Inorganic Syntheses |last3= Kaner |last4= Mansuktto |isbn= 9780470132616 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crystalline phases ===
All forms of {{chem|MoS|2}} have a layered structure, in which a plane of molybdenum atoms is sandwiched by planes of sulfide ions. These three strata form a monolayer of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Bulk MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consists of stacked monolayers, which are held together by weak [[Van der Waals force|van der Waals]] interactions.

Crystalline MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is found in nature as one of two phases, 2H-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 3R-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where the "H" and the "R" indicate hexagonal and rhombohedral symmetry, respectively.  In both of these structures, each molybdenum atom exists at the center of a [[trigonal prism]]atic [[coordination sphere]] and is covalently bonded to six sulfide ions. Each sulfur atom has pyramidal coordination and is bonded to three molybdenum atoms. Both the 2H- and 3R-phases are semiconducting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/series/562|title=Gmelin Handbook of Inorganic and Organometallic Chemistry - 8th edition|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third, metastable crystalline phase known as 1T-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was discovered by intercalating 2H-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with alkali metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wypych|first=Fernando|last2=Schöllhorn|first2=Robert|date=1992-01-01|title=1T-MoS2, a new metallic modification of molybdenum disulfide|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/is/content/articlehtml/1992/c3/c39920001386|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, Chemical Communications|volume=0|language=en|issue=19|pages=1386–1388|doi=10.1039/C39920001386|issn=0022-4936}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This phase has tetragonal symmetry and is metallic. The 1T-phase can be stabilized through doping with electron donors like rhenium,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Enyashin|first=Andrey N.|last2=Yadgarov|first2=Lena|last3=Houben|first3=Lothar|last4=Popov|first4=Igor|last5=Weidenbach|first5=Marc|last6=Tenne|first6=Reshef|last7=Bar-Sadan|first7=Maya|last8=Seifert|first8=Gotthard|date=2011-12-22|title=New Route for Stabilization of 1T-WS2 and MoS2 Phases|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry C|volume=115|issue=50|pages=24586–24591|doi=10.1021/jp2076325|issn=1932-7447|arxiv=1110.3848}}&lt;/ref&gt; or converted back to the 2H-phase by microwave radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xu|first=Danyun|last2=Zhu|first2=Yuanzhi|last3=Liu|first3=Jiapeng|last4=Li|first4=Yang|last5=Peng|first5=Wenchao|last6=Zhang|first6=Guoliang|last7=Zhang|first7=Fengbao|last8=Fan|first8=Xiaobin|date=2016|title=Microwave-assisted 1T to 2H phase reversion of MoS 2 in solution: a fast route to processable dispersions of 2H-MoS 2 nanosheets and nanocomposites|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0957-4484/27/i=38/a=385604|journal=Nanotechnology|language=en|volume=27|issue=38|pages=385604|doi=10.1088/0957-4484/27/38/385604|pmid=27528593|issn=0957-4484|bibcode=2016Nanot..27L5604X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allotropes===
[[Carbon nanotube|Nanotube]]-like and [[buckyball]]-like molecules composed of {{chem|MoS|2}} are known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1039/B901466G| pmid = 20419198| title = Recent progress in the research of inorganic fullerene-like nanoparticles and inorganic nanotubes| journal = Chemical Society Reviews| volume = 39| issue = 5| pages = 1423–34| year = 2010| last1 = Tenne | first1 = R. | last2 = Redlich | first2 = M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exfoliated MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; flakes===
While bulk MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the 2H-phase is known to be an indirect-band gap semiconductor, monolayer MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a direct band gap. The layer-dependent optoelectronic properties of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have promoted much research in 2-dimensional MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based devices. 2D MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be produced by exfoliating bulk crystals to produce single-layer to few-layer flakes either through a dry, micromechanical process or through solution processing.

Micromechanical exfoliation, also pragmatically called "Scotch-tape exfoliation", involves using an adhesive material to repeatedly peel apart a layered crystal by overcoming the van der Waals forces. The crystal flakes can then be transferred from the adhesive film to a substrate. This facile method was first used by Novoselov and Geim to obtain graphene from graphite crystals. However, it can not be employed for a uniform 1-D layers because of less adhesion of MoS2 with the substrate (either Si, glass or quartz). The aforementioned scheme is good for Graphene only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Novoselov|first=K. S.|last2=Geim|first2=A. K.|last3=Morozov|first3=S.

Liquid-phase exfoliation can also be used to produce monolayer to multi-layer MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in solution.

=== Mechanical properties ===
MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; excels as a lubricating material (see below) due to its layered structure and low [[Friction|coefficient of friction]]. Interlayer sliding dissipates energy when a shear stress is applied to the material. Extensive work has been performed to characterize the coefficient of friction and shear strength of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in various atmospheres.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donnet|first=C.|last2=Martin|first2=J. M.|last3=Le Mogne|first3=Th.|last4=Belin|first4=M.|date=1996-02-01|title=Super-low friction of MoS2 coatings in various environments|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0301679X9500094K|journal=Tribology International|volume=29|issue=2|pages=123–128|doi=10.1016/0301-679X(95)00094-K}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[shear strength]] of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increases as the coefficient of friction increases. This property is called [[superlubricity]]. At ambient conditions, the coefficient of friction for MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was determined to be 0.150, with a corresponding estimated shear strength of 56.0 MPa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Direct methods of measuring the shear strength indicate that the value is closer to 25.3 MPa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oviedo|first=Juan Pablo|last2=KC|first2=Santosh|last3=Lu|first3=Ning|last4=Wang|first4=Jinguo|last5=Cho|first5=Kyeongjae|last6=Wallace|first6=Robert M.|last7=Kim|first7=Moon J.|date=2015-02-24|title=In Situ TEM Characterization of Shear-Stress-Induced Interlayer Sliding in the Cross Section View of Molybdenum Disulfide|journal=ACS Nano|volume=9|issue=2|pages=1543–1551|doi=10.1021/nn506052d|pmid=25494557|issn=1936-0851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wear resistance of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in lubricating applications can be increased by doping MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with chromium. Microindentation experiments on [[nanopillar]]s of Cr-doped MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; found that the yield strength increased from an average of 821 MPa for pure MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (0 at. % Cr) to 1017 MPa for 50 at. % Cr.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tedstone|first=Aleksander A.|last2=Lewis|first2=David J.|last3=Hao|first3=Rui|last4=Mao|first4=Shi-Min|last5=Bellon|first5=Pascal|last6=Averback|first6=Robert S.|last7=Warrens|first7=Christopher P.|last8=West|first8=Kevin R.|last9=Howard|first9=Philip|date=2015-09-23|title=Mechanical Properties of Molybdenum Disulfide and the Effect of Doping: An in Situ TEM Study|journal=ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces|volume=7|issue=37|pages=20829–20834|doi=10.1021/acsami.5b06055|pmid=26322958|issn=1944-8244}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in yield strength is accompanied by a change in the failure mode of the material. While the pure MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanopillar fails through a plastic bending mechanism, brittle fracture modes become apparent as the material is loaded with increasing amounts of dopant.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The widely used method of micromechanical exfoliation has been carefully studied in MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to understand the mechanism of delamination in few-layer to multi-layer flakes. The exact mechanism of cleavage was found to be layer dependent. Flakes thinner than 5 layers undergo homogenous bending and rippling, while flakes around 10 layers thick delaminated through interlayer sliding. Flakes with more than 20 layers exhibited a kinking mechanism during micromechanical cleavage. The cleavage of these flakes was also determined to be reversible due to the nature of van der Waals bonding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tang|first=Dai-Ming|last2=Kvashnin|first2=Dmitry G.|last3=Najmaei|first3=Sina|last4=Bando|first4=Yoshio|last5=Kimoto|first5=Koji|last6=Koskinen|first6=Pekka|last7=Ajayan|first7=Pulickel M.|last8=Yakobson|first8=Boris I.|last9=Sorokin|first9=Pavel B.|date=2014-04-03|title=Nanomechanical cleavage of molybdenum disulphide atomic layers|url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140403/ncomms4631/full/ncomms4631.html|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=5|pages=3631|doi=10.1038/ncomms4631|pmid=24698887|bibcode=2014NatCo...5E3631T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lubricant ===

Due to weak [[van der Waals force|van der Waals]] interactions between the sheets of sulfide atoms, {{chem|MoS|2}} has a low [[coefficient of friction]]. {{chem|MoS|2}} in particle sizes in the range of 1–100&amp;nbsp;µm is a common [[dry lubricant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last=Claus| first= F.

{{chem|MoS|2}} is often a component of blends and composites that require low friction. For example, it is added to graphite to improve sticking.&lt;ref name=moly/&gt; A variety of [[oil]]s and [[grease (lubricant)|grease]]s are used, because they retain their lubricity even in cases of almost complete oil loss, thus finding a use in critical applications such as [[aircraft engine]]s. When added to [[plastic]]s, {{chem|MoS|2}} forms a [[composite material|composite]] with improved strength as well as reduced friction. Polymers filled with {{chem|MoS|2}} include [[nylon]] ([[trade name]] [[Nylatron]]), [[Teflon]] and [[Vespel]]. Self-lubricating composite coatings for high-temperature applications consist of molybdenum disulfide and [[titanium nitride]], using [[chemical vapor deposition]].

Examples of applications of {{chem|MoS|2}}-based lubricants include [[two-stroke engine]]s (such as motorcycle engines), bicycle [[coaster brakes]], automotive [[Constant-velocity joint|CV]] and [[universal joint]]s, ski waxes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| accessdate = 2011-01-06| url = http://www.swixsport.com/dav/8dde5f4784.pdf| title = On dry lubricants in ski waxes| publisher = Swix Sport AX| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110716174041/http://www.swixsport.com/dav/8dde5f4784.pdf| archivedate = 2011-07-16| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[bullet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| accessdate = 2009-06-06| url = http://www.norma.cc/en/Ammunition-Academy/Barrel-wear/| title = Barrels retain accuracy longer with Diamond Line| publisher=Norma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Catalysis ===
[[File:Molybdenum disulfide - 17.jpg|thumb|[[Fingerprint]] revealed by molybdenum disulfide]]
{{chem|MoS|2}} is employed as a co[[catalyst]] for desulfurization in [[petrochemistry]], for example, [[hydrodesulfurization]].The effectiveness of the {{chem|MoS|2}} catalysts is enhanced by [[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]] with small amounts of [[cobalt]] or [[nickel]]. The intimate mixture of these sulfides is [[catalyst support|supported]] on [[alumina]]. Such catalysts are generated in situ by treating molybdate/cobalt or nickel-impregnated alumina with {{chem|H|2|S}} or an equivalent reagent.  Catalysis does not occur at the regular sheet-like regions of the crystallites, but instead at the edge of these planes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1= Topsøe| first1= H.| last2=  Clausen| first2= B.

The sensitivity of a graphene [[field-effect transistor]] (FET) biosensor is fundamentally restricted by the zero band gap of graphene, which results in increased leakage and reduced sensitivity. In digital electronics, transistors control current flow throughout an integrated circuit and allow for amplification and switching.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1221">A '''national oil company''' ('''NOC''') is an [[oil]] and gas company fully or in the majority owned by a national government. According to the [[World Bank]], NOCs accounted for 75% global oil production and controlled 90% of proven oil reserves in 2010.&lt;!--

Due to their increasing dominance over global reserves, the importance of NOCs relative to [[Supermajor|International Oil Companies]] (IOCs), such as [[ExxonMobil]], [[BP]], or [[Royal Dutch Shell]], has risen dramatically in recent decades. NOCs are also increasingly investing outside their national borders.

[[File:AC powered NE-2 type neon lamp close-up.jpg|thumb|200px|right|NE-2 type neon lamp powered by [[alternating current]] (AC)]]
A '''neon lamp''' (also '''neon glow lamp''') is a miniature [[gas discharge lamp]]. The lamp typically consists of a small glass capsule that contains a mixture of [[neon]] and [[Penning mixture|other gases]] at a low pressure and two [[electrode]]s (an [[anode]] and a [[cold cathode|cathode]]).  When sufficient voltage is applied and sufficient current is supplied between the electrodes, the lamp produces an orange [[glow discharge]].  The glowing portion in the lamp is a thin region near the cathode; the larger and much longer [[neon sign]]s are also glow discharges, but they use the [[wikt:positive column|positive column]] which is not present in the ordinary neon lamp.  Neon glow lamps are widely used as [[indicator lamp]]s in the displays of electronic instruments and appliances.

==History==
[[Image:NE-34 LAMP.JPG|thumb|right|A [[General Electric]] NE-34 glow lamp, manufactured circa 1930]]
[[Neon]] was discovered in 1898 by [[William Ramsay]] and [[Morris W. Travers]]. The characteristic, brilliant red color that is emitted by gaseous neon when excited electrically was noted immediately; Travers later wrote, "the blaze of crimson light from the tube told its own story and was a sight to dwell upon and never forget."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Discovery of the Elements: Third Edition (reprint) |last=Weeks |first=Mary Elvira |authorlink=Mary Elvira Weeks |year=2003 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SJIk9BPdNWcC&amp;pg=PA287 |page=287 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322191804/http://books.google.com/books?id=SJIk9BPdNWcC&amp;pg=PA287 |archivedate=2015-03-22 |df= }}&lt;!--The probable original source for this quote is Travers' 1928 book: {{cite book |title=The Discovery of the Rare Gases |last=Travers |first=Morris W. |publisher=Edward Arnold &amp; Co. |location=London |year=1928}}--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Neon's scarcity precluded its prompt application for electrical lighting along the lines of [[Moore tube]]s, which used electric discharges in nitrogen. Moore tubes were commercialized by their inventor, [[Daniel McFarlan Moore]], in the early 1900s. After 1902, [[Georges Claude]]'s company, [[Air Liquide]], was producing industrial quantities of neon as a byproduct of his air liquefaction business, and in December 1910 Claude demonstrated modern [[neon light]]ing based on a sealed tube of neon. In 1915 a U.S. patent was issued to Claude covering the design of the electrodes for neon tube lights;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=1125476 |title=Systems of Illuminating by Luminescent Tubes |invent1=Georges Claude |gdate=1915-01-19 |fdate=1911-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; this patent became the basis for the monopoly held in the U.S. by his company, Claude Neon Lights, through the early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Claude Neon Lights Wins Injunction Suit: Also Gets Rights to Recover Profits and Damages Resulting From Patent Infringement |work=The New York Times |date=November 28, 1928}} Paid access.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1917, Daniel Moore developed the neon lamp while working at the [[General Electric Company]]. The lamp has a very different design from the much larger neon tubes used for [[neon lighting]]. The difference in design was sufficient that a U.S. patent was issued for the lamp in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{ref patent| country=US |number=1316967 |status=patent |title=Gaseous Conduction Lamp |pubdate= |gdate=1919-09-23 |fdate=1917-11-30 |pridate= |invent1=Daniel McFarlan Moore |invent2= |assign1=General Electric Company |assign2= |class= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Smithsonian Institution website notes, "These small, low power devices use a physical principle called [[coronal discharge]]. Moore mounted two electrodes close together in a bulb and added neon or argon gas. The electrodes would glow brightly in red or blue, depending on the gas, and the lamps lasted for years. Since the electrodes could take almost any shape imaginable, a popular application has been fanciful decorative lamps.&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite web |title=Lamp Inventors 1880-1940: Moore Lamp |publisher=The Smithsonian Institution |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/lighting/bios/moore.htm |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050304005429/http://americanhistory.si.edu/lighting/bios/moore.htm |archivedate=2005-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--There is a long history for these lamps that needs to be developed here. The neon lamp ultimately leads to modern plasma displays.--&gt;

Glow lamps found practical use as indicators in instrument panels and in many home appliances until the widespread commercialization of [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs) in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;

== Description ==
[[Image:Doutnavka.svg|thumb|Graph showing the relationship between current and voltage across a neon lamp.{{dubious|reason=even GE Manual does not show continuous curve (unstable region)|date=March 2015}}&lt;ref name = "Glow Lamp Manual"&gt;C.R. Dougherty, T.D. Foulke, J.D. Harden, T.L. Hewitt, F.N. Peters, R.D. Smith, and J.W. Tuttle, ''General Electric Glow Lamp Manual'', 2nd ed. (General Electric Company, 1966), Chapter 1:  Physics and characteristics of glow lamps:  Theory of gaseous conduction in the glow lamp, pages 1-3; see Fig. 1.1, Characteristic curve of the neon lamp.  In the current vs. voltage curve in this article, the portion of the curve between points A and B correspond to the points E and F in Fig. 1.1.  From p. 2:  "After breakdown occurs the lamp passes through a transition region EF which is an unstable region of operation.  The shaded portion indicates the region in which oscillation can occur.  This region is often referred to as the ''negative resistance region'', since voltage decreases as current increase[s], contrary to normal behavior in a resistive element. [...] As the current through the lamp is allowed to increase further, the lamp enters the ''normal glow'' discharge region represented by section FG [where the point G corresponds to the point C in the current vs. voltage graph of this article] in Fig. 1.1 where voltage changes a minimum amount with a change in current. … In the normal glow region the glow is confined to a portion of the cathode surface and the amount of cathode surface covered by the glow is somewhat proportional to the tube current."&lt;/ref&gt; |alt=Graph.]]
A small [[electric current]] (for a 5&amp;nbsp;mm bulb diameter NE-2 lamp, the quiescent current is about 400 µA), which may be [[alternating current|AC]] or [[direct current|DC]], is allowed through the tube, causing it to glow orange-red.  The gas is typically a [[Penning mixture]], 99.5% [[neon]] and 0.5% [[argon]], which has lower [[Breakdown voltage#Gases and vacuum|striking voltage]] than pure neon, at a pressure of 1-20 [[torr]].  The lamp [[glow discharge]] lights at its striking voltage. The striking voltage is reduced by ambient light or radioactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book 
|title=using and understanding miniature NEON LAMPS

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The voltage required to sustain the discharge is significantly (~30%) lower than the striking voltage. This is due to the organization of positive ions near the cathode.  Neon lamps operate using a low current [[glow discharge]]. Higher power devices, such as [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s or [[metal halide lamp]]s use a higher current [[arc discharge]]. Low pressure [[sodium-vapor lamp]]s use a neon Penning mixture for warm up and can be operated as giant neon lamps if operated in a low power mode.

Once the neon lamp has reached breakdown, it can support a large current flow. Because of this characteristic, electrical circuitry external to the neon lamp must limit the current through the circuit or else the current will rapidly increase until the lamp is destroyed. For indicator-sized lamps, a [[resistor]] typically limits the current. In contrast, larger sized lamps often use a specially constructed high voltage [[transformer]] with high [[leakage inductance]] or other [[electrical ballast]] to limit the available current (see [[neon sign]]).

When the current through the lamp is lower than the current for the highest-current discharge path, the [[glow discharge]] may become unstable and not cover the entire surface of the electrodes.&lt;ref name = "Glow Lamp Manual"/&gt; This may be a sign of aging of the indicator bulb, and is exploited in the decorative "flicker flame" neon lamps. However, while too low a current causes flickering, too high a current increases the wear of the electrodes by stimulating [[sputtering]], which coats the internal surface of the lamp with metal and causes it to darken.

The potential needed to strike the discharge is higher than what is needed to sustain the discharge. When there is not enough current, the glow forms around only part of the electrode surface. Convective currents make the glowing areas flow upwards, not unlike the discharge in a [[Spark gap#Spark gaps as entertainment|Jacob's ladder]]. A [[photoionization]] effect can also be observed here, as the electrode area covered by the glow discharge can be increased by shining light at the lamp.

In comparison with [[incandescent lamp|incandescent light bulbs]], neon lamps have much higher [[luminous efficacy]]. [[Incandescence]] is heat-driven light emission, so a large portion of the electric energy put into an incandescent bulb is converted into heat. Non-incandescent light sources such as neon light bulbs, [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent light bulbs]], and [[light emitting diodes]] are therefore much more energy efficient than normal incandescent light bulbs. [[Green]] neon bulbs&lt;ref&gt;"Other emitted colors such as green, yellow and blue are available through secondary emission by coating the inside surface of the envelope with phosphor." — [http://www.intl-lighttech.com/products/light-sources/lamps/neon International Light Technology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626131441/http://intl-lighttech.com/products/light-sources/lamps/neon |date=2014-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; can produce up to 65 lumens per watt of power input, while white neon bulbs have an efficacy of around 50 lumens per watt. In contrast, a standard incandescent light bulb only produces around 13.5 lumens per watt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Marcus|last=Thielen|title=LED or Neon|url=http://www.signweb.com/index.php/channel/12/id/138/|date=2006-02-10|accessdate=2008-12-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409004409/http://www.signweb.com/index.php/channel/12/id/138|archivedate=2008-04-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
[[Image:Socket 5.jpg|thumb|150px|Switch on a [[power strip]], illuminated by a neon lamp]]

=== Visual indicator ===
Small neon lamps are most widely used as visual indicators in electronic equipment and appliances, due to their low power consumption, long life, and ability to operate on mains power.

=== Voltage surge suppression ===
Neon lamps are commonly used as low-voltage [[surge protector]]s, but they are generally inferior to [[Surge protector#Gas discharge tube .28GDT.29|gas discharge tube (GDT)]] surge protectors (which can be designed for higher voltage applications). Neon lamps have been used as an inexpensive method to protect RF receivers from voltage spikes (lamp connected to RF input and chassis ground), but they are not suitable for higher-power RF transmitters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Let's Use Neon Bulbs|url=http://www.rfcafe.com/references/qst/neon-bulbs-qst-july-1953.htm|publisher=QST Magazine|accessdate=October 2, 2017|date=July 1953|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002165635/http://www.rfcafe.com/references/qst/neon-bulbs-qst-july-1953.htm|archivedate=October 2, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Voltage tester ===
[[Image:Neonlamp3.JPG|right|thumb|250px|+DC (left), -DC (center), AC (right) supplied to NE-2 type neon lamps|alt=Photograph of 3 small glass capsules. Each capsule has 2 parallel wires that pass through the glass. Inside the left capsule, the right electrode is glowing orange. In the middle capsule, the left electrode is glowing. In the right capsule, both electrodes are glowing.]]

Most small neon (indicator-sized) lamps, such as the common '''NE-2''', have a [[Breakdown voltage#Gases and vacuum|break-down voltage]] of around 90&amp;nbsp;[[volt]]s.  When driven from a DC source, only the negatively charged electrode ([[cathode]]) will glow. When driven from an AC source, both electrodes will glow (each during alternate half cycles). These attributes make neon bulbs (with series resistors) a convenient low-cost [[Test light|voltage tester]].  By examining which electrode is glowing they can reveal whether a given voltage source is AC or DC, and if DC, the polarity of the points being tested.

=== Voltage regulation ===
The breakdown characteristic of glow-discharge lamps allows them to be used as [[voltage regulator]]s or [[overvoltage]] protection devices.&lt;ref name="Miller2"&gt;Miller, W.G. (1969) ''[http://www.tiffe.de/roehren/neon.pdf Using and Understanding Miniature Neon Lamps] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517085459/http://www.tiffe.de/roehren/neon.pdf |date=2017-05-17 }}'', p.25-35&lt;/ref&gt; Starting around the 1930s, [[General Electric]] (GE), Signalite, and other firms made voltage regulator tubes. A voltage regulator tube was used in the [[Mark 6 exploder]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These applications were sufficiently common that manufacturers made neon bulbs specifically for this use, sometimes called "circuit-component" lamps.  At least some of these lamps have a glow concentrated into a small spot on the cathode, which made them unsuited to use as indicators.  A variant of the NE-2 type lamp for circuit applications, the NE-77, have three wire electrodes in the bulb (in a plane) instead of the usual two, the third for use as a control electrode.

=== Detector ===
Neon lamps have been historically used as microwave and millimeter-wave detectors ('plasma diodes' or GDDs- Glow Discharge Detectors) up to about 100&amp;nbsp;GHz or so and in such service were said to exhibit comparable sensitivity (of the order of a few 10s to perhaps 100 microvolts) to the familiar 1N23-type catwhisker-contacted silicon diodes{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} once ubiquitous in microwave equipment. More recently it has been found that these lamps work well as detectors even at sub-millimeter ('terahertz') frequencies and they have been successfully used as pixels in several experimental imaging arrays at these wavelengths.

In these applications the lamps are operated either in 'starvation' mode (to reduce lamp-current noise) or in normal glow discharge mode; some literature references their use as detectors of radiation up into the optical regime when operated in abnormal glow mode. Coupling of microwaves into the plasma may be in free space, in waveguide, by means of a parabolic concentrator (e.g., [[Winston cone]]), or via capacitive means via a loop or dipole antenna mounted directly to the lamp.

Although most of these applications use ordinary off-the-shelf dual-electrode lamps, in one case it was found that special 3 (or more) electrode lamps, with the extra electrode acting as the coupling antenna, provided even better results (lower noise and higher sensitivity). This discovery received a US patent

Neon lamps with several shaped electrodes were used as alphanumerical displays known as [[Nixie tube]]s. These have since been replaced by other display devices such as [[light emitting diode]]s, [[vacuum fluorescent display]]s, and [[liquid crystal display]]s.

Since at least the 1940s, argon, neon, and [[phosphor]]ed ''glow [[thyratron]]'' [[Flip-flop (electronics)|latching]] indicators (which would light up upon an impulse on their starter electrode and extinguish only after their anode voltage was cut) were available for example as self-displaying [[shift registers]] in large-format, crawling-text [[dot-matrix display]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tubedata.milbert.com/sheets/013/z/ZC1050.pdf |title=Philips, 1968: ''ZC1050'' data sheet |format=PDF |accessdate=10 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012022948/http://tubedata.milbert.com/sheets/013/z/ZC1050.pdf |archivedate=12 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or, combined in a 4x4, four-color phosphored-thyratron matrix, as a stackable 625-color RGBA pixel for large video graphics arrays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.decadecounter.com/vta/pdf2/ITM2Mdatasheet.PDF |title=Melz, 1944: ''ИНДИКАТОР ИТМ2-М'' data sheet |format=PDF |accessdate=9 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012031227/http://www.decadecounter.com/vta/pdf2/ITM2Mdatasheet.PDF |archivedate=12 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Multiple-cathode and/or anode ''glow thyratrons'' called [[Dekatron]]s could count forwards and backwards while their count state was visible as a glow on one of the numbered cathodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tubedata.milbert.com/sheets/022/g/GCA10G.pdf |title=ETL: ''GCA10G/GSA10G'' data sheet |format=PDF |accessdate=10 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221541/http://tubedata.milbert.com/sheets/022/g/GCA10G.pdf |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These were used as self-displaying [[Frequency divider#Digital dividers|divide-by-n counter/timer/prescalers]] in counting instruments, or as [[Adder (electronics)|adder/subtracters]] in [[Calculator#Development of electronic calculators|calculators]].

=== Other ===
In 1930s radio sets, neon lamps were used as tuning indicators, called "tuneons" and would give a brighter glow as the station was tuned in correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tuneon|url=http://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_tuneon.html|website=Radiomuseum|accessdate=12 October 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016220126/http://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_tuneon.html|archivedate=16 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/060/t/TUNEON.pdf TuneOn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114235507/http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/060/t/TUNEON.pdf |date=2018-01-14 }} and [http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/060/t/TUNEON-BUTTON.pdf Tuneon-Button] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114235507/http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/060/t/TUNEON-BUTTON.pdf |date=2018-01-14 }} data sheets&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their comparatively short response time, in the early development of [[television]] neon lamps were used as the light source in many [[Mechanical television|mechanical-scan TV]] displays.

[[Aerolux Light Corporation|Novelty glow lamps]] with shaped electrodes (such as flowers and leaves), often coated with phosphors, have been made for artistic purposes. In some of these, the glow that surrounds an electrode is part of the design.

Neon indicator lamps are normally orange, and are frequently used with a colored filter over them to improve contrast and change their color to red or a redder orange, or less often green.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

[[Image:NE2COLORED.JPG|thumb|right|Phosphor-colored neon lamps]]
They can also be filled with [[argon]], [[krypton]], or [[xenon]] rather than neon, or mixed with it. While the electrical operating characteristics remain similar, these lamps light with a bluish glow (including some [[ultraviolet]]) rather than neon's characteristic reddish-orange glow. Ultraviolet radiation then can be used to excite a [[phosphor]] coating inside of the bulb and provide a wide range of various colors, including white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Phosphor handbook |last1=Yen |first1=William M. |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Hajime |publisher=CRC Press |year=2007 |page=442 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I9O1K20-uo4C&amp;pg=PA442 |isbn=978-0-8493-3564-8 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114235507/https://books.google.com/books?id=I9O1K20-uo4C&amp;pg=PA442 |archivedate=2018-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A mixture of 95% neon, 2.5% [[krypton]], and 2.5% argon can be used for a green glow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bogard|first1=Scott|title=Plasma Globe Colors|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/sdb229/Plasma%20ball%20colors.html|website=Scott Bogard's E-Profile|accessdate=22 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509030653/http://www.personal.psu.edu/sdb229/Plasma%20ball%20colors.html|archivedate=9 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but nevertheless "green neon" lamps are more commonly phosphor-based.

'''Operation Free''' is a coalition of veterans and national security organizations founded in August 2009 by the [[Truman National Security Project]], The National Security Initiative, [[VoteVets.org]], and VetPAC.  Operation Free, in collaboration with other organizations, works to raise awareness, among policymakers and the public, of the national security threat posed by climate change and the United States' reliance on oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.wnct.com/nct/news/local/military/article/operation_free_veterans_group_makes_stop_in_raleigh/65695/#|title="Operation Free" veterans group makes stop in Raleigh|author=Amy Kibler|date=October 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.argusleader.com/article/20091016/NEWS/91016023/1001/news|title=Vets tour to promote climate change bill|author=John Hult|date=October 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
In the Fall of 2009, with [[Alexander Cornell du Houx]]  in charge, Operation Free launched a 29-state bus tour designed to give veterans the opportunity to talk directly to the American people about how climate change is "undermining our safety and why we need to pass clean energy and climate legislation as quickly as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/fbeinecke/young_veterans_tell_congress_c.html|title=Military vets with Operation Free stop Friday in South Bend|date=October 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009, Operation Free flew in 150 veterans to attend the White House Administration's Clean Energy Briefing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/video/Operation-Free-Clean-Energy-Briefing|title=Operation Free Clean Energy Briefing|date=September 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These veterans met with 26 US Senators and/or Staff to discuss the national security threats of climate change and America's current energy posture. In February 2010, Operation Free hosted a similar event in which it flew 80 veterans into Washington DC to meet with policymakers and members of the press.

On September 20, 2010 Operation Free announced its sponsorship of race car driver Leilani Munter, who is also a clean energy advocate and environmental activist. On September 30, Leilani’s car (#59) which featured Operation Free’s logo, drove in the ARCA Series Kansas Lottery 150 race at the Kansas Speedway.&lt;ref name="nascar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.operationfree.net/news-and-events/news/|title=Operation Free NASCAR announcement|date=September 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sturman Industries cosponsored Leilani in an effort to promote its “Powered By Sturman” American engine modifications that "address national energy and security needs by using technology to transform engine efficiency and facilitate the nations’ effort to replace foreign oil with alternative American fuels"."&lt;ref name="nascar" /&gt;

==Controversy==
The group has been criticized for "lending their name, to promote the leftist propaganda of global warming and climate change..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delcotimes.com/articles/2009/10/21/news/doc4ade73bcc76d7582618359.txt|title=Lentz, Operation Free irate over rep.'s e-mail|author=Alex Rose|date=October 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rep.

'''Pellet fuels''' (or '''pellets''') are [[biofuel]]s made from compressed organic matter or biomass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biomass Energy|url=http://www.altenergy.org/renewables/biomass.html/|publisher=Alternate Energy|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pellets can be made from any one of five general categories of biomass: industrial waste and co-products, [[food waste]], [[Crop residue|agricultural residues]], [[Energy crop|energy crops,]] and virgin [[lumber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sources of biomass|url=http://www.biomassenergycentre.org.uk/portal/page?_pageid=75,15174&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|publisher=BIOMASS Energy Centre|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  '''Wood pellets''' are the most common type of pellet fuel and are generally made from compacted [[sawdust]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.organicenergy.co.uk/wood-pellets.html|title=Organic Energy Ltd|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and related industrial wastes from the [[Lumber mill|mill]]ing of lumber, manufacture of [[wood]] products and [[furniture]], and [[construction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/biofuels/biomass/#about|title=About the Densified Biomass Fuel Report|last=|first=|date=October 17, 2018|website=U.S. EIA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other industrial waste sources include empty fruit bunches, [[palm kernel]] shells, [[coconut]] shells, and tree tops and branches discarded during [[logging]] operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Use EFB Pellet as Renewable Energy|url=http://www.biofuelresource.com/use-efb-pellet-as-renewable-energy/|publisher=Biofuel Resource|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Wood Pellets from PKS  |author2=Coconut Shell |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Wood Pellets from PKS and Coconut Shell|url=http://www.supremecarbon.com/wood.htm|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; So-called "black pellets" are made of [[biomass]], refined to resemble hard [[coal]] and were developed to be used in existing coal-fired [[Power station|power plants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pretty weird and awfully clever|url= http://news.vattenfall.com/en/article/pretty-weird-and-awfully-clever/|publisher=News from Vattenfall|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pellets are categorized by their [[Heat of combustion|heating value]], [[moisture]] and [[Wood ash|ash]] content, and dimensions.

Further, their regular geometry and small size allow automatic feeding with very fine calibration. They can be fed to a burner by [[Screw conveyor|auger]] feeding or by [[Pneumatics|pneumatic]] conveying. Their high density also permits compact storage and transport over long distance. They can be conveniently blown from a tanker to a storage bunker or silo on a customer's premises.&lt;ref name=pellets101&gt;{{cite web|title=Wood Pellet Central-Heating Solution for Homeowners and Small Industry|url=http://www.mywoodpelletsolution.com/overview/|publisher=MY WOOD PELLET SOLUTION|accessdate=30 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123051857/http://www.mywoodpelletsolution.com/overview/|archivedate=23 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A broad range of [[pellet stove]]s, central heating furnaces, and other heating appliances have been developed and marketed since the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of Dr. Jerry Whitfield|url=http://www.opalco.com/news_article/dr-jerry-whitfield-of-shaw-island-to-fill-district-4-board-vacancy/|accessdate=16 February 2015|date=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 fully automatic wood [[pellet boiler]]s with similar comfort level as oil and gas boilers became available in [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Turkel|first=Tux|title=Maine Energy Systems finalizes deal with Austrian pellet-boiler company|url=http://www.pressherald.com/news/maine-energy-systems-finalizes-deal-with-austrian-pellet-boiler-company_2012-07-07.html|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the surge in the price of [[fossil fuel]]s since 2005, the demand for pellet heating has increased in [[Europe]] and [[North America]], and a sizable industry is emerging.

== Production ==
[[File:8. Station - Holzpelletproduktion der WestPellets GmbH and Co. KG (6219816410).jpg|thumbnail|left|Pellet truck being filled at a plant in Germany.]]
Pellets are produced by compressing the wood material which has first passed through a [[hammer mill]] to provide a uniform dough-like mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fuller|first=Ron|title=Pelleting Process|url=http://bioenergy.illinois.edu/news/biomass/06Fuller_cpm.pdf|publisher=University of Illinois|accessdate=8 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718052854/http://www.bioenergy.illinois.edu/news/biomass/06Fuller_cpm.pdf|archivedate=18 July 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mass is fed to a press, where it is squeezed through a die having holes of the size required (normally 6&amp;nbsp;mm diameter, sometimes 8&amp;nbsp;mm or larger).  The high pressure of the [[wood pellet press|press]] causes the temperature of the wood to increase greatly, and the [[lignin]] plasticizes slightly, forming a natural "glue" that holds the pellet together as it cools.&lt;ref name="Manomet"/&gt;

Pellets can be made from [[grass]] and other non-woody forms of biomass that do not contain lignin: [[Distillers grains|distiller's dried grains]] (a brewing industry byproduct) can be added to provide the necessary durability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steelhammer|first=Rick|title=A penchant for pellets|url=http://wvgazette.com/News/201202040036|publisher=The Charleston Gazette|accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2005 news story from [[Cornell University]] News suggested that grass pellet production was more advanced in Europe than North America. It suggested the benefits of grass as a feedstock included its short growing time (70 days), and ease of cultivation and processing. The story quoted Jerry Cherney, an agriculture professor at the school, stating that grasses produce 96% of the heat of wood and that "any mixture of grasses can be used, cut in mid- to late summer, left in the field to leach out minerals, then baled and pelleted. Drying of the hay is not required for pelleting, making the cost of processing less than with wood pelleting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/march05/grass.fuel.ssl.html |title= Don't let grass grow under your feet -- burn it as economical, environmentally friendly biofuel, Cornell expert urges |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120819052854/http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/March05/grass.fuel.ssl.html |archivedate=2012-08-19|accessdate=2015-06-14|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, the Department of Agriculture of [[Nova Scotia]] announced as a demonstration project conversion of an oil-fired [[boiler]] to grass pellets at a research facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.trurodaily.com/Business/2012-11-27/article-3129131/Grass-pellet-heating-system-intended-to-provide-new-cash-crop-for-farmers/1|title= Grass pellet heating system intended to provide new cash crop for farmers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rice-husk fuel-pellets are made by compacting rice-husk obtained as by-product of [[rice]]-growing from the fields. It also has similar characteristics to the wood-pellets and more environment-friendly, as the raw material is a [[Waste|waste-product]]. The energy content is about 4-4.2 kcal/kg and moisture content is typically less than 10%. The size of pellets is generally kept to be about 6 mm diameter and 25 mm length in the form of a cylinder; though larger cylinder or briquette forms are not uncommon. It is much cheaper than similar energy-pellets and can be compacted/manufactured from the husk at the farm itself, using cheap machinery. They generally are more environment-friendly as compared to wood-pellets.&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.vikaco.com/en/export-rice-husk-pellet/146-rice-husk-pellet-vietnam.html, http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ef201271b, http://www.tis-gdv.de/tis_e/ware/futter/pellets/weizenkl/weizenkl.htm, http://factory.dhgate.com/agricultural-wastage/rice-husk-pellets-for-fuel-p40985821.html, http://www.chatdotcongnghiep.com/rice-husk-pallets, http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/rkb/index.php/rice-milling/byproducts-and-their-utilization/rice-husk, http://fwci.com/publications/tech_papers/files/TP_CFB_08_05.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; In the regions of the world where [[wheat]] is the predominant food-crop, wheat husk can also be compacted to produce energy-pellets, with characteristics similar to rice-husk pellets.

A report by [[CORRIM]] (Consortium On Research on Renewable Industrial Material) for the Life-Cycle Inventory of Wood Pellet Manufacturing and Utilization estimates the energy required to dry, pelletize and transport pellets is less than 11% of the energy content of the pellets if using pre-dried industrial wood waste. If the pellets are made directly from forest material, it takes up to 18% of the energy to dry the wood and additional 8% for transportation and manufacturing energy. An environmental impact assessment of exported wood pellets by the Department of Chemical and Mineral Engineering, [[University of Bologna]], [[Italy]] and the Clean Energy Research Centre, at the [[University of British Columbia]], published in 2009, concluded that the energy consumed to ship Canadian wood pellets from [[Vancouver]] to [[Stockholm]] (15,500&amp;nbsp;km via the [[Panama Canal]]), is about 14% of the total energy content of the wood pellets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forgreenheat.org/blog/An%20environmental%20impact%20assessment%20of%20exported%20wood%20pellets%20from%20Canada%20to%20Europe.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.corrim.org/pubs/articles/2012/FPJ_vol62_num04/06_FPJ-vol62-num04-2012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pellet standards===
Pellets conforming to the norms commonly used in Europe (DIN 51731 or Ö-Norm M-7135) have less than 10% water content, are uniform in density (higher than 1 ton per cubic meter, thus it sinks in water)(bulk density about 0.6-0.7 ton per cubic meter), have good structural strength, and low dust and ash content.&lt;ref name=Alakangas /&gt; Because the wood fibres are broken down by the hammer mill, there is virtually no difference in the finished pellets between different wood types.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  Pellets can be made from nearly any wood variety, provided the pellet press is equipped with good instrumentation, the differences in feed material can be compensated for in the press regulation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}. In Europe, the main production areas are located in south [[Scandinavia]], [[Finland]], [[Central Europe]], [[Austria]], and the [[Baltic states|Baltic]] countries.&lt;ref name="Selkimäki M., Mola-Yudego, B., Röser D, Prinz R, Sikanen L. 2010 3068–3075"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Present and future trends in pellet markets, raw materials, and supply logistics in Sweden and Finland | journal = Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews | volume = 14 | issue = 9 | pages = 3068–3075 | year =2010 | url = | format = PDF | doi = 10.1016/j.rser.2010.06.009 | author = Selkimäki M., Mola-Yudego, B., Röser D, Prinz R, Sikanen L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Spatial analysis of the wood pellet production for energy in Europe | journal = Renewable Energy | volume = | issue = | pages = | year =2013 | url = | format = PDF | doi =10.1016/j.renene.2013.08.034 | author =Mola-Yudego, B.; Selkimäki M., González-Olabarria J. R. |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pellets conforming to the European standards norms which contain recycled wood or outside contaminants are considered Class B pellets.&lt;ref name=Alakangas /&gt; [[Recycling|Recycled materials]] such as particle board, treated or painted wood, [[melamine resin]]-coated panels and the like are particularly unsuitable for use in pellets, since they may produce noxious [[Air pollution|emissions]] and uncontrolled variations in the burning characteristics of the pellets.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Standards used in the [[United States]] are different, developed by the [[Pellet Fuels Institute]] and, as in Europe, are not mandatory.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Still, many manufacturers comply, as warranties of US-manufactured or imported combustion equipment may not cover damage by pellets non-conformant with regulations.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Prices for US pellets surged during the [[fossil fuel]] price [[inflation]] of 2007–2008, but later dropped markedly and are generally lower on a per-[[British thermal unit|BTU]] basis than most fossil fuels, excluding [[coal]].

Regulatory agencies in Europe and North America &lt;!--Australia/NZ/etc anyone????--&gt; are in the process of tightening the emissions standards for all forms of wood heat, including wood pellets and pellet stoves. These standards will become mandatory, with independently certified testing to ensure compliance.&lt;ref name="IntelligentEnergyEurope"&gt;{{cite web|title=Advancement of pellets-related European standards |url=http://www.bape.com.pl/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=zv64RqEj-5E%3D&amp;tabid=312&amp;mid=697 |publisher=WIP Renewable Energies |accessdate=11 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426085811/http://www.bape.com.pl/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=zv64RqEj-5E=&amp;tabid=312&amp;mid=697 |archivedate=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EPA36&gt;{{cite web|title=Revision of New Source Performance Standards for New Residential Wood Heaters|url=http://www.epa.gov/rfa/residential-wood-heaters.html|publisher=US EPA|accessdate=2 January 2012|date=2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the new rules initiated in 2009 have completed the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] regulatory review process,&lt;ref name="EPA revision"&gt;{{cite web|title=Revision of New Source Performance Standards for New Residential Wood Heaters|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/opei/rulegate.nsf/byRIN/2060-AP93#1|publisher=US EPA|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with final new rules issued for comment on June 24, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Revised NSPS for New Residential Wood Heaters|url=http://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0734|publisher=regulations.gov|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pfi&gt;{{cite web|title=PFI Standards Program|url=http://www.pelletheat.org/pfi-standards-program|publisher=Pellet Fuels Institute|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/residential-wood-heaters/proposed-new-source-performance-standards-residential-wood-heaters|title=Standards of Performance for New Residential Wood Heaters|author=|date=|website=epa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The American Lumber Standard Committee will be the independent certification agency for the new pellet standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacobs|first=Scott|title=PFI Standards Program Major Developments|url=http://pelletheat.org/pfi-standards-program-major-developments/|publisher=Pellet Fuels Institute|accessdate=2 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113230750/http://pelletheat.org/pfi-standards-program-major-developments/|archivedate=13 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pellet stove operation==
{{main|Pellet stove}}
There are three general types of pellet heating appliances, free standing pellet stoves, pellet stove inserts and [[pellet boiler]]s.  ''Pellet stoves'' "look like traditional [[wood stove]]s but operate more like a modern [[furnace]].  [Fuel, wood or other biomass pellets, is stored in a storage bin called a hopper.  The hopper can be located on the top of the appliance, the side of it or remotely.]  A mechanical auger [automatically feeds] the pellets into a burn pot, where they are incinerated at such a high temperature that they create no vent-clogging creosote and very little ash or emissions… “Heat-exchange tubes”: Send air heated by fire into room… “Convection fan”: Circulates air through heat-exchange tubes and into room… The biggest difference between a pellet stove and … a woodstove, is that, inside, the pellet stove is a high-tech device with a circuit board, a thermostat, and fans—all of which work together to [regulate temperature and] heat your space efficiently.”&lt;ref name="Morell"&gt;Morell, J.; Hill, K. (2012). All About Pellet Stoves. This Old House Magazine. [http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/photos/0,,20654453,00.html] Retrieved 16 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''pellet stove insert'' is a stove that is inserted into an existing masonry or prefabricated wood [[fireplace]]. See [[Fireplace insert]]

''[[Pellet boiler]]s'' are standalone central heating and hot water systems designed to replace traditional fossil fuel systems in residential, commercial and institutional applications.  Automatic or ''auto-pellet boilers'' include silos for bulk storage of pellets, a fuel delivery system that moves the fuel from the silo to the hopper, a logic controller to regulate temperature across multiple heating zones and an automated ash removal system for long-term automated operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.maineenergysystems.com/OkoFEN_AutoPellet_Boilers.htm |title= Wood Pellet Central Heating Systems |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150217052322/http://www.maineenergysystems.com/OkoFEN_AutoPellet_Boilers.htm |archivedate= 2015-02-17 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Energy output and efficiency ==
[[File:Wood-pellet heater.jpg|Wood-pellet heater|thumb|right]]
The [[energy]] content of wood pellets is approximately 4.7 – 5.2 [[MWh]]/[[tonne]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.biomassenergycentre.org.uk/portal/page?_pageid=75,59188&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|title=  Fuel prices per kWh (excluding VAT) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BERC-pellets&gt;{{cite web|last=Sherman|first=Adam|title=Pellet Fuel Quality, Delivery, and Storage|url=http://www.biomasscenter.org/images/stories/2012prez_sherman.pdf|work=2012 Vermont Woodchip and Pellet Heating Conference|publisher=Biomass Energy Resource Center|accessdate=23 January 2012|date=16 January 2012|quote=PFI min std is 8000 BTU/lb =&gt; 5.2 MWh/t}}&lt;/ref&gt; (~7450 BTU/lb).

High-efficiency wood pellet [[pellet stove|stoves]] and [[boiler]]s have been developed in recent years, typically offering combustion efficiencies of over 85%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Case for Pellets|url=http://www.biomasscenter.org/images/stories/2012prez_bissex.pdf|work=2012 VT Wood Chip &amp; Pellet Heating Conference|accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newest generation of wood pellet boilers can work in condensing mode and therefore achieve 12% higher efficiency values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.okofen.co.uk/en/pellematic_plus#tab2|title= Okofen condesing pellet boiler}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood pellet boilers have limited control over the rate and presence of combustion compared to liquid or gaseous-fired systems; however, for this reason they are better suited for [[hydronic]] heating systems due to the hydronic system's greater ability to store heat.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Pellet burners capable of being retrofitted to oil-burning boilers are also available.&lt;ref name=pellets101 /&gt;

==Air pollution emissions==
Emissions such as [[nitrogen oxide|NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[sulfur dioxide|SO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[volatile organic compound]]s from pellet burning equipment are in general very low in comparison to other forms of combustion heating.&lt;ref name=CU2009&gt;{{cite web|title=Buyer's guide to pellet- and wood-burning stoves The pros, cons and costs vs. natural gas, oil, and coal|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/appliances/heating-cooling-and-air/wood-stoves/buyers-guide-to-pellet-and-wood-burning-stoves-1-07/overview/0701_pellet-stove.htm|publisher=Consumer Reports|accessdate=8 December 2011|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recognized problem is the emission of fine [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] to the air, especially in urban areas that have a high concentration of [[pellet stove|pellet heating]] systems or coal or oil heating systems in close proximity. This [[PM2.5|PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;]] emissions of older pellet stoves and boilers can be problematic in close quarters, especially in comparison to [[natural gas]] (or renewable [[biogas]]), though on large installations [[electrostatic precipitator]]s, [[Cyclonic separation|cyclonic separators]], or [[baghouse|baghouse particle filters]] can control particulates when properly maintained and operated.&lt;ref name=BERC10&gt;{{cite web|title=BERC at 10 Years &amp; 2011 Annual Report|url=http://www.biomasscenter.org/images/stories/BERC_2010_annual_report.pdf|publisher=Biomass Energy Resource Center|accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global warming==

A report&lt;ref name="Manomet"/&gt; by the [[Manomet Center for Conservation Sciences]], "Biomass Sustainability and [[Carbon]] Policy Study" issued in June 2010 for the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources, concludes that burning biomass such as wood pellets or wood chips releases a large amount of [[Carbon dioxide|CO2]] into the air, creating a "carbon debt" that is not retired for 20–25 years and after which there is a net benefit.&lt;ref name="Manomet"/&gt; In June 2011 the department was preparing to file its final regulation, expecting to significantly tighten controls on the use of biomass for energy, including wood pellets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biofuelmachines.com/Download/complete-guide-on-wood-pellet-production.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Biomass energy proponents have disputed the Manomet report's conclusions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futuremetrics.net/papers/Manomet+Got+it+Backwards.pdf|title=FutureMetrics|author=|date=|website=www.futuremetrics.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futuremetrics.net/papers/Response+to+Manomet+Comments.pdf|title=FutureMetrics|author=|date=|website=www.futuremetrics.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; and scientists have pointed out oversights in the report, suggesting that climate impacts are worse than reported.&lt;ref name="Booth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moomaw, W. 2011. Should we get our electricity by burning trees? Presentation at Williams College. [http://sustainability.williams.edu/files/2011/02/BillMoomaw-Biomass.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Until ca. 2008 it was commonly assumed, even in scientific papers, that biomass energy (including from wood pellets) is carbon neutral, largely because regrowth of vegetation was believed to recapture and store the carbon that is emitted to the air.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dovetailinc.org/files/DovetailLCABioenergy0711.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Then, scientific papers studying the climate implications of biomass began to appear which refuted the simplistic assumption of its [[carbon neutrality]].&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;&lt;ref

Biomass and Bioenergy (33:3, p.434-441). [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V22-4TT1G1X-2/2/51c9e5b7a7055acfc24bcd001116bf56]&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Biomass Energy Resource Center, the assumption of carbon neutrality "has shifted to a recognition that the carbon implications of biomass depend on how the fuel is harvested, from what forest types, what kinds of forest management are applied, and how biomass is used over time and across the landscape.”&lt;ref name="BERC10" /&gt;

In 2011 twelve prominent U.S. environmental organizations adopted policy setting a high bar for government incentives of biomass energy, including wood pellets. It states in part that, "[b]iomass sources and facilities qualifying for (government) incentives must result in lower life-cycle, cumulative and net [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] and ocean acidifying emissions, within 20 years and also over the longer term, than the energy sources they replace or compete with."&lt;ref name="ENGOs"&gt;Principles of Sustainable Biomass; policy of 12 large U.S. environmental organizations.

==Sustainability==

The wood products industry is concerned that if large-scale use of wood energy is instituted, the supply of raw materials for construction and manufacturing will be significantly curtailed.&lt;ref name="Manomet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Large-scale biomass ‘risks UK jobs and carbon emissions.’ Carbon Offsets Daily, 2 July 2010. [http://www.carbonoffsetsdaily.com/news-channels/uk-carbonmarketnews/large-scale-biomass-‘risks-uk-jobs-and-carbon-emissions’-40081.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cost ==
Due to the rapid increase in popularity since 2005, pellet availability and cost may be an issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nef.org.uk/logpile/pellets/production.htm|title= Wood Pellet Fuel Production}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an important consideration when buying a pellet stove, furnace, pellet baskets or other devices known in the industry as Bradley Burners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bradleyburner.com/|title= The Bradley Burner}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, current pellet production is increasing and there are plans to bring several new pellet mills online in the US in 2008–2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/fplrp/fpl_rp656.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of the pellets can be affected by the building cycle leading to fluctuations in the supply of sawdust and offcuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Development and promotion of a transparent European Pellets Market Creation of a European real-time Pellets Atlas|url=https://create-cdn.net/sitefiles/11/1/3/111316/Development_European_Pellets_Market.pdf|website=http://www.liverpoolwoodpellets.co.uk|publisher=Pellets @las|accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Per the [[New Hampshire]] [http://www.nh.gov/oep/ Office of Energy and Planning] release on Fuel Prices updated on 5 Oct 2015, the cost of #2 [[Fuel oil|Fuel Oil]] delivered can be compared to the cost of Bulk Delivered Wood Fuel Pellets using their BTU equivalent:  1 [[ton]] pellets = 118.97 [[gallon]] of #2 Fuel Oil. This assumes that one ton of pellets produces 16,500,000 BTU and one gallon of #2 Fuel Oil produces 138,690 BTU. Thus if #2 Fuel Oil delivered costs $1.90/Gal, the breakeven price for pellets is $238.00/Ton delivered.

Usage across Europe varies due to government regulations. In the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], and the [[United Kingdom|UK]], pellets are used mainly in large-scale power plants.  The UK's largest power plant, the [[Drax power station]], converted some of its units to pellet burners starting in 2012; by 2015 Drax had made the UK the largest recipient of exports of wood pellets from the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK’s renewable energy targets drive increases in U.S. wood pellet exports|url=https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=20912|publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration|language=en|date=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]], pellets are used in large-scale power plants, medium-scale district heating systems, and small-scale residential heat.  In [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Italy]], and [[France]], pellets are used mostly for small-scale residential and industrial heat.&lt;ref name=IHB2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Main pellet consumers in Europe|url=http://www.ihb.de/wood/news/Pellet_consumers_Europe_33987.html|publisher=IHB|accessdate=14 September 2013|date=September 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK has initiated a grant scheme called the [[Renewable Heat Incentive]] (RHI) allowing non-domestic and domestic wood pellet boiler installations to receive payments over a period of between 7–20 years It is the first such scheme in the world and aims to increase the amount of renewable energy generated in the UK, in line with [[European Union|EU]] commitments. [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] have separate but similar schemes. From Spring 2015, any biomass owners—whether domestic or commercial—must buy their fuels from BSL (Biomass Suppliers List) approved suppliers in order to receive RHI payments.&lt;ref&gt;

Pellets are widely used in Sweden, the main pellet producer in Europe,&lt;ref name="Selkimäki M., Mola-Yudego, B., Röser D, Prinz R, Sikanen L. 2010 3068–3075"/&gt; mainly as an alternative to oil-fired central heating. In Austria, the leading market for pellet central heating furnaces (relative to its population), it is estimated that {{frac|2|3}} of all new domestic heating furnaces are pellet burners. In Italy, a large market for automatically fed pellet stoves has developed. Italy's main usage for pellets is small-scale private residential and industrial boilers for heating.&lt;ref name="IHB"&gt;

In 2014 in Germany the overall wood pellet consumption per year comprised 2,2 mln tones. These pellets are consumed predominantly by residential small scale heating sector. The co-firing plants which use pellet sector for energy production are not widespread in the country. The largest amount of wood pellets is certified with DINplus and these are the pellets of the highest quality. As a rule, the pellets of lower quality are exported.&lt;ref name="GBP"&gt;

=== New Zealand ===
The total sales of wood pellets in [[New Zealand]] was 3–5,000 tonnes in 2003. Recent construction of new wood pellet plants has given a huge increase in production capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nielsen|first=S |author2=George A. Estcourt |author3=Carolyn J.

=== United States ===
Some companies import European-made boilers. As of 2009, about 800,000 Americans were using wood pellets for heat.&lt;ref name=CU2009 /&gt;  It is estimated that 2.33 million tons of wood pellets will be used for heat in the US in 2013.&lt;ref name=BioMag2013&gt;{{cite web|last=Retka Schill|first=Sue|title=PFI conference: Continued growth expected in pellet market|url=http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/9276/pfi-conference-continued-growth-expected-in-pellet-market|publisher=Biomass Magazine|accessdate=16 September 2013|date=July 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US wood pellet export to Europe grew from 1.24 million ton in 2006 to 7 million ton in 2012, but forests grew even more.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aebiom.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DG-ENVI-study-imports-from-US-Final-report-July-2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==

===Horse bedding===
When small amounts of water are added to wood pellets, they expand and revert to sawdust. This makes them suitable to use as a [[horse]] bedding. The ease of storage and transportation are additional benefits over traditional bedding. However, some species of wood, including walnut, can be [[Toxicity|toxic]] to horses and should never be used for bedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hooser, DVM PhD|first=Stephen B.|title=Laminitis Caused by Black Walnut Wood Residues|url=http://www.ces.purdue.edu/extmedia/FNR/FNR-254.pdf|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=20 October 2012|date=Jan 2005|quote=Because of the possible severe consequences of poisoning, stall bedding for horses should never contain black walnut wood.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614205517/http://www.ces.purdue.edu/extmedia/FNR/FNR-254.pdf|archivedate=14 June 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Thailand]], rice husk pellets are being produced for animal bedding. They have a high absorption rate which makes them ideal for the purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalbioltd.com|title=Global Bio Ltd|author=|date=|website=Global Bio Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Absorbents===
Wood pellets are also used to absorb [[Water pollution|contaminated water]] when drilling oil or gas wells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tulley|first1=Reid|title=Confluence Energy acquires Rocky Mountain Pellet Company in Walden |url=http://www.skyhidailynews.com/article/20130320/NEWS/130319951 |publisher=Sky-Hi News|accessdate=4 February 2015|date=March 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cooking===
Wood [[pellet grill]]s have gained popularity as a versatile way to grill, bake, and smoke. The size of the pellets makes it useful for creating a wood fired grill that still controls its temperature precisely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barbecuebible.com/2015/02/20/new-pellet-grills/|title=A Guide to Pellet Grills - Barbecuebible.com|author=|date=|website=barbecuebible.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25402">'''Plasma acceleration''' is a technique for accelerating [[charged particle]]s, such as [[electron]]s, [[positron]]s, and [[ion]]s, using the [[electric field]] associated with [[plasma oscillation|electron plasma wave]] or other high-gradient plasma structures (like shock and sheath fields). The plasma acceleration structures are created either using ultra-short [[laser]] pulses or energetic particle beams that are matched to the plasma parameters. These techniques offer a way to build high performance [[particle accelerator]]s of much smaller size than conventional devices. The basic concepts of plasma acceleration and its possibilities were originally conceived by [[Toshiki Tajima]] and Prof. [[John M. Dawson]] of [[UCLA]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Tajima |first1= T. |last2= Dawson |first2= J. M. |year= 1979 |title= Laser Electron Accelerator |url= |journal= Phys. Rev.

Plasma accelerators have immense promise for innovation of affordable and compact accelerators for various applications ranging from high energy physics to medical and industrial applications. Medical applications include [[betatron]] and [[free-electron laser|free-electron]] light sources for diagnostics or [[radiotherapy|radiation therapy]] and protons sources for [[particle therapy|hadron therapy]]. Plasma accelerators generally use wakefields generated by plasma density waves. However, plasma accelerators can operate in many different regimes depending upon the characteristics of the plasmas used.

For example, an experimental laser plasma accelerator at [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] accelerates electrons to 1 GeV over about 3.3&amp;nbsp;cm (5.4x10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; [[standard gravity|g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Leemans | first=W.

==Concept==

A [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] consists of a fluid of positive and negative charged particles, generally created by heating or photo-ionizing (direct / tunneling / multi-photon / barrier-suppression) a dilute gas. Under normal conditions the plasma will be macroscopically neutral (or quasi-neutral), an equal mix of [[electron]]s and [[ion]]s in equilibrium. However, if a strong enough external electric or electromagnetic field is applied, the plasma electrons, which are very light in comparison to the background ions (by a factor of 1836), will separate spatially from the massive ions creating a charge imbalance in the perturbed region. A particle injected into such a plasma would be accelerated by the charge separation field, but since the magnitude of this separation is generally similar to that of the external field, apparently nothing is gained in comparison to a conventional system that simply applies the field directly to the particle. But, the plasma medium acts as the most efficient transformer (currently known) of the transverse field of an electromagnetic wave into longitudinal fields of a plasma wave. In existing accelerator technology various appropriately designed materials are used to convert from transverse propagating extremely intense fields into longitudinal fields that the particles can get a kick from. This process is achieved using two approaches: standing-wave structures (such as resonant cavities) or traveling-wave structures such as disc-loaded waveguides etc. But, the limitation of materials interacting with higher and higher fields is that they eventually get destroyed through ionization and breakdown. Here the plasma accelerator science provides the breakthrough to generate, sustain, and exploit the highest fields ever produced by science in the laboratory.

What makes the system useful is the possibility of introducing waves of very high charge separation that propagate through the plasma similar to the traveling-wave concept in the conventional accelerator. The accelerator thereby phase-locks a particle bunch on a wave and this loaded space-charge wave accelerates them to higher velocities while retaining the bunch properties. Currently, plasma wakes are excited by appropriately shaped [[laser]] pulses or electron bunches. Plasma electrons are driven out and away from the center of wake by the [[ponderomotive force]] or the electrostatic fields from the exciting fields (electron or laser). Plasma ions are too massive to move significantly and are assumed to be stationary at the time-scales of plasma electron response to the exciting fields. As the exciting fields pass through the plasma, the plasma electrons experience a massive attractive force back to the center of the wake by the positive plasma ions chamber, bubble or column that have remained positioned there, as they were originally in the unexcited plasma. This forms a full wake of an extremely high longitudinal (accelerating) and transverse (focusing) electric field. The positive charge from ions in the charge-separation region then creates a huge gradient between the back of the wake, where there are many electrons, and the middle of the wake, where there are mostly ions. Any electrons in between these two areas will be accelerated (in self-injection mechanism). In the external bunch injection schemes the electrons are strategically injected to arrive at the evacuated region during maximum excursion or expulsion of the plasma electrons.

A beam-driven wake can be created by sending a relativistic proton or electron bunch into an appropriate plasma or gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Caldwell |first1= A. |year= 2016 |title= Path to AWAKE: Evolution of the concept |url= http://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/56629/ |journal= Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A |volume= 829 |issue= |pages= 3–16 |doi= 10.1016/j.nima.2015.12.050 |arxiv= 1511.09032 |bibcode= 2016NIMPA.829....3C|hdl= 11858/00-001M-0000-002B-2685-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the gas can be ionized by the electron bunch, so that the electron bunch both creates the plasma and the wake. This requires an electron bunch with relatively high charge and thus strong fields. The high fields of the electron bunch then push the plasma electrons out from the center, creating the wake.

Similar to a beam-driven wake, a laser pulse can be used to excite the plasma wake. As the pulse travels through the plasma, the electric field of the light separates the electrons and nucleons in the same way that an external field would.

If the fields are strong enough, all of the ionized plasma electrons can be removed from the center of the wake: this is known as the "blowout regime". Although the particles are not moving very quickly during this period, macroscopically it appears that a "bubble" of charge is moving through the plasma at close to the speed of light. The bubble is the region cleared of electrons that is thus positively charged, followed by the region where the electrons fall back into the center and is thus negatively charged. This leads to a small area of very strong potential gradient following the laser pulse.

In the linear regime, plasma electrons aren't completely removed from the center of the wake. In this case, the linear plasma wave equation can be applied. However, the wake appears very similar to the blowout regime, and the physics of acceleration is the same.

[[File:Illustration Plasma Wakefield Acceleration.png|thumb|400px|Wake created by an electron beam in a plasma]]

It is this "wakefield" that is used for particle acceleration. A particle injected into the plasma near the high-density area will experience an acceleration toward (or away) from it, an acceleration that continues as the wakefield travels through the column, until the particle eventually reaches the speed of the wakefield. Even higher energies can be reached by injecting the particle to travel across the face of the wakefield, much like a [[surfing|surfer]] can travel at speeds much higher than the wave they surf on by traveling across it. Accelerators designed to take advantage of this technique have been referred to colloquially as "surfatrons".

==Comparison with RF acceleration==

The advantage of plasma acceleration is that its acceleration field can be much stronger than that of conventional radio-frequency (RF) [[particle accelerator|accelerators]]. In RF accelerators, the field has an upper limit determined by the threshold for [[electrical breakdown|dielectric breakdown]] of the acceleration tube. This limits the amount of acceleration over any given area, requiring very long accelerators to reach high energies. In contrast, the maximum field in a plasma is defined by mechanical qualities and turbulence, but is generally several orders of magnitude stronger than with RF accelerators. It is hoped that a compact particle accelerator can be created based on plasma acceleration techniques or accelerators for much higher energy can be built, if long accelerators are realizable with an accelerating field of 10 GV/m.

Plasma acceleration is categorized into several types according to how the electron plasma wave is formed:
*''plasma wakefield acceleration'' '''(PWFA)''': The electron plasma wave is formed by an electron or proton bunch.
*''laser wakefield acceleration'' '''(LWFA)''': A laser pulse is introduced to form an electron plasma wave.
*''laser beat-wave acceleration'' '''(LBWA)''': The electron plasma wave arises based on different frequency generation of two laser pulses. The "Surfatron" is an improvement on this technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Katsouleas |first1= T. |last2= Dawson |first2= J. M. |year= 1983 |title= A Plasma Wave Accelerator - Surfatron I |url= |journal= IEEE Trans. Nucl.

*''self-modulated laser wakefield acceleration'' '''(SMLWFA)''': The formation of an electron plasma wave is achieved by a laser pulse modulated by [[Raman scattering|stimulated Raman forward scattering]] instability.

The first experimental demonstration of wakefield acceleration, which was performed with PWFA, was reported by a research group at [[Argonne National Laboratory]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rosenzweig | first=J.

==Formula==
The acceleration gradient for a linear plasma wave is:
:&lt;math&gt;E= c \cdot \sqrt{\frac{m_e \cdot n_e}{\varepsilon_0}}.&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electric field]], &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum, &lt;math&gt;m_e&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the [[electron]], &lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt; is the plasma electron density (in particles per metre cubed), and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[permittivity#Vacuum permittivity|permittivity of free space]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1673">A '''propellant tank''' is a container which is part of a vehicle, where [[propellant]] is stored prior to use. Propellant tanks vary in construction, and may be a [[fuel tank]] in the case of many [[aircraft]].

In [[rocket]] vehicles, propellant tanks are fairly sophisticated since weight is on a premium.

==Rocket propellant tanks==
Rocket propellant tanks are [[pressure vessel]]s where liquid fuels are stored prior to use. They have to store the propellant, while minimizing slosh and particularly when the tank is nearly empty, minimizing [[vortexing]].

Rocket propellant tanks are often constructed of materials such as [[aluminium alloy]]s, steels or carbon fibre wound tanks.

These kinds of tanks are usually constructed using [[monocoque]] construction techniques. [[Balloon tank]]s are the most extreme of these, they are held rigid only by internal pressurisation, but are extremely lightweight.
Rocket propellant tanks are of many shapes but the optimum shape of a tank is spherical, because for  given volume it results in a tank with least weight.
Normally, propellant in the tank is stored at a pressure of about 1-4 bar, if the system uses turbopump to deliver high pressure to the combustion chamber. This method reduces the wall thickness and hence the weight of the tank.
If the propellant in the tank is stored at very high pressure, then the wall thickness of the tank is increased and hence the weight of the tank

The '''quintal''' or '''centner''' is a historical unit of [[mass]] in many countries which is usually defined as 100 base units of either [[pound (mass)|pound]]s or [[kilogram]]s. It is commonly used for [[grain]] prices in wholesale markets in [[India]], where 1 quintal = 100 kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quintal - Merriam Webster Dictionary|publisher=Merriam Webster Dictionary|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/quintal|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[British English]], it referred to the [[hundredweight]]; in [[American English]], it formerly referred to an uncommon measure of 100&amp;nbsp;[[kilograms]]. 
{{anchor|Etymology}}

==Name==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
Both terms share their roots in the [[Classical Latin]] ''centenarius'', meaning ''hundredlike'', but the ''quintal'' has a convoluted etymology: It became [[Late Latin]] ''centenarium pondus'', then in succession, [[Byzantine Greek]] κεντηνάριον (''kentenarion'') and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''qintar'' قنطار. The ''qintar'' was reimported to Europe by traders during the Middle Ages, where it became [[Medieval Latin]] ''quintale'', and finally [[Old French]] ''quintal'' before passing into the [[English language]] from French.

The word ''centner'', on the other hand, is simply a [[Germanic languages|Germanicized]] form of its original Latin name ''centenarius''.

Languages drawing its cognate name for the weight from Arabic ''qintar'' include French, Portuguese and Spanish ''quintal'', Italian ''quintale'', Esperanto ''kvintalo''. Languages taking their cognates from Germanicized ''centner'' include German ''[[Zentner]]'', Lithuanian ''centneris'', Swedish ''centner'', Polish ''cetnar'', Russian ''центнер'' (tsentner),  Ukrainian ''це́нтнер'' (tséntner), Estonian ''tsentner'' and Spanish ''centena''.

Many European languages have come to translate both the [[imperial units|imperial]] and [[US customary units|American]] [[hundredweight]] as their cognate form of ''quintal'' or ''centner''.

The concept has resulted in two different series of masses: Those based on the local pound (which after [[metrication]] was considered equivalent to half a kilogram), and those uprated to being based on the kilogram.

In [[India]] and [[Albania]] (kuintal), the quintal as equivalent to 100&amp;nbsp;kilogram was imported via Arabic influence and is a standard measurement of mass for agricultural products.

In [[French units of measurement|France]] it used to be defined as 100 ''livres'' (pounds), about 48.95&amp;nbsp;kg, and has been redefined as 100&amp;nbsp;kg (''[[mesures usuelles]]''), thus called ''metric quintal'' with symbol ''qq''.

In [[Spain]], the ''centena'' is still defined as 100 ''libras'', or about 46&amp;nbsp;kg, but the ''metric quintal'' is also defined as 100&amp;nbsp;kg;&lt;ref&gt;[[Real Academia Española]]'s [http://lema.rae.es/drae/?val=quintal definition of ''quintal'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Portugal]] a quintal is 128 [[arrátel]]s or about 58.75&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;!-- source? --&gt;

The German ''Zentner'' is pound-based, and thus since metrication is defined as 50&amp;nbsp;kg, whereas the Austrian and Swiss ''Zentner'' since metrication has been re-defined as 100&amp;nbsp;kg. In Germany a measure of 100&amp;nbsp;kg is named a Doppelzentner.

Common agricultural units used in the [[Soviet Union]] were the 100-kilogram centner (центнер) and the term "centner per [[hectare]]". These are still used by countries that were part of the Soviet Union.

==English use==

In [[English unit|English]] both terms ''quintal'' and ''centner'' were once alternative names for the [[hundredweight]] and thus defined either as 100&amp;nbsp;[[Avoirdupois|lb]] (exactly 45.359237&amp;nbsp;kg) or as 112&amp;nbsp;lb (about 50.84&amp;nbsp;kg). Also, in the [[Dominican Republic]] it is about 125&amp;nbsp;lb. The German ''Zentner'' was introduced to the English language via [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic trade]] as a measure of the weight of certain [[agriculture|crops]] including [[hops]] for [[beer]] production.

The '''quintal''' was defined in the United States in 1866&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/205-  Act of July 28, 1866, codified in 15 U.S.C. §205]&lt;/ref&gt; as 100&amp;nbsp;kilograms. However, it is no longer used in USA or by [[NIST]] though it still appears in the statute.&lt;ref&gt;"Metric System of Measurement: Interpretation of the International System of Units for the United States", [[Federal Register]] notice of July 28, 1998, 63 F.R. 40333 {{cite web|url=http://ts.nist.gov/ts/htdocs/200/202/SIFedReg.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 28, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930114423/http://ts.nist.gov/ts/htdocs/200/202/SIFedReg.pdf |archivedate=September 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Indonesia]] and in India, it is still in daily use by farmers. In [[Brazil]] and other South American countries, it is used under its alternative spelling of "''kintal''". It is also used in some African countries including [[Angola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The use of Quintal for weight measurements|url=https://sizes.com/units/quintal.htm|website=https://sizes.com|accessdate=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RecycleBot is an open-source hardware project  – thus its plans are freely available on the Internet.
* RecycleBot curated by academics in Canada and the U.S. on [[Appropedia]] ([http://www.appropedia.org/Recyclebot here]) and at the RepRap Wiki ([http://reprap.org/wiki/Recyclebot  here]).

== History ==

The history of the RecycleBot was largely derived from the work on the RepRap Wiki under [[GNU Free Documentation License]]1.2.&lt;ref&gt;http://reprap.org/wiki/Recyclebot&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recyclebot was developed by students at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hackaday.com/2010/08/05/recyclebot-digests-milk-jugs-to-feed-makerbot/ |title=Recyclebot digests milk jugs to feed MakerBot  |last1=Burgess |first1=Phil |date=5 August 2010 |website=hackaday.com/ |publisher=hackaday |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shapeways.com/blog/archives/536-recyclebot-greening-the-makerbot.html |title=RecycleBot: Greening the MakerBot |last1=Duann |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=3 August 2010 |website=The Shapeways Blog |publisher=shapeways |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.makerbot.com/blog/2010/08/03/recyclebot-makes-hdpe-for-your-makerbot-from-milk-jugs |title=Recyclebot makes HDPE for your MakerBot from Milk Jugs! |last1=Pettis |first1=Bre |last2= |first2= |date=3 August 2010 |website=makerbot.com blog |publisher=makerbot |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design was a proof of concept and was a hand-powered design, which thus had a good environmental or [[ecological footprint]], but did not create filament of high enough quality to be useful for [[3D printers]]. The design for the [http://www.appropedia.org/Waste_plastic_extruder waste plastic extruder] (Recyclebot v2.0 and v2.1) developed at [[Queen's University]] Canada and [[Michigan Tech]] was heavily influenced by the Web4Deb extruder, which extrudes [[HDPE]] for use as a growth medium in aquaponics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web4deb.blogspot.com/2010/12/plastic-extruder-for-growing-media.html  Web4Deb's blog].&lt;/ref&gt; This design for the recyclebot was developed, tested and published in the peer-reviewed [[rapid prototyping]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baechler | first1 = Christian | last2 = DeVuono | first2 = Matthew | last3 = Pearce | first3 = Joshua M. | year = | title = Distributed Recycling of Waste Polymer into RepRap Feedstock | doi = 10.1108/13552541311302978 | journal = Rapid Prototyping Journal | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 118–125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This device proved viable for producing [[3D printing filament]].

'''Roselle''' (''Hibiscus sabdariffa'') is a species of ''[[Hibiscus]]'' probably native to West Africa,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/509866/roselle "Roselle" Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; used for the production of [[bast fibre]] and as an [[infusion]], in which it may be known as '''carcade'''. It is an annual or perennial [[herb]] or woody-based [[subshrub]], growing to {{Convert|2|-|2.5|m|ft|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} tall. The [[leaf|leaves]] are deeply three- to five-lobed, {{Convert|8|-|15|cm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} long, arranged alternately on the stems.

The [[flower]]s are {{Convert|8|-|10|cm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} in diameter, white to pale yellow with a dark red spot at the base of each petal, and have a stout fleshy [[calyx (flower)|calyx]] at the base, {{Convert|1|-|2|cm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} wide, enlarging to {{Convert|3|-|3.5|cm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}, fleshy and bright red as the [[fruit]] matures. They take about six months to mature.

==Names==
[[File:Roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa).png|thumb|Roselle capsule.]]
[[File:Roselle 2, Hibiscus sabdariffa, 2014.JPG|thumb|Roselle plant at Wave Hill]]
The roselle is known as the ''rosella'' or ''rosella fruit'' in Australia.
It is known as '''Belchanda''' among [[Nepalis|Nepalese]], '''Tengamora''' among [[Assamese people|Assamese]], '''Gal•da''' among [[Garo people|Garos]], '''Amile''' among [[Chakma people|Chakmas]], '''Hanserong''' among [[Karbi people|Karbi]], '''Sougri''' among [[Meitei people|Meitei]] and ''mwita'' among the Bodos. The [[Atong language (Sino-Tibetan)|Atongs]] call it "dachang" or "datchang". It is called as "gongura" by Telugu-speaking people from India. It also has a local name ''Saril'' or ''flor de Jamaica'' in Central America.

*In [[Mandarin Chinese|Chinese]], roselle is known as ''luo shen hua''  (洛神花).
*In [[Thai language|Thai]], roselle is known as ''grà jíap.'' ''Kraceī́yb'' (กระเจี๊ยบ).
*In [[Burmese language|Burmese]], roselle is known as ''chin baung'' (ချဉ်ပေါင်).

==Uses==
The plant is primarily cultivated for the production of [[bast fibre]] from the stem. The fibre may be used as a substitute for [[jute]] in making [[burlap]].&lt;ref name="www_hort_purdue_edu1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/duke_energy/Hibiscus_sabdariffa.html | title = hort.purdue.edu | accessdate = 2007-08-25 | publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Hibiscus]]'', specifically roselle, has been used in folk medicine as a diuretic and mild [[laxative]].&lt;ref name="www_drugs_com"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.drugs.com/npp/roselle.html | title = drugs.com | accessdate = 2008-05-11 | publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The red [[sepal|calyces]] of the plant are increasingly exported to the United States and Europe, particularly [[Germany]], where they are used as [[food colouring]]s.

===Vegetable===
In [[Maharashtra]], roselle is called [[Ambadi]]. The Ambadi leaves are mixed with green chillies, salt, some [[garlic]] to prepare a chutney which is served with [[Jowar]] or [[Pearl millet|bajra]] made [[bhakri]]. This is eaten by Farmers as breakfast to start their day. A dry vegetable or Sukhi Sabzi made of Ambadi leaves tastes good with Bhakri.{{according to whom|date=September 2018}}

In [[Andhra cuisine]], roselle is called ''[[gongura]]'' and is extensively used. The leaves are steamed with lentils and cooked with [[dal]]. Another unique dish is prepared by mixing fried leaves with spices and made into a [[gongura pacchadi]], the most famous dish of Andhra cuisine, often described as king of all Andhra foods.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In [[Burmese cuisine]], called ''chin baung ywet'' (lit. sour leaf), the roselle is widely used and considered affordable. It is perhaps the most widely eaten and popular vegetable in Burma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-10-07/food/fo-42908_1_chin-baung | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Barbara | last=Hansen | title=Uncommon Herbs : In a Burmese Garden | date=1993-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaves are fried with garlic, dried or fresh prawns and green chili or cooked with fish. A light soup made from roselle leaves and dried prawn stock is also a popular dish.

Among the Paites tribe of the Manipur ''Hibiscus sabdariffa'' and ''Hibiscus cannabinus'' locally known as ''anthuk'' are cooked along with chicken, fish, crab or pork or any meat, and cooked as a soup as one of their traditional cuisines.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.zomidaily.org/kelsa-hau-za-cin/&lt;/ref&gt;
In the Khasi Hills of Meghalaya, the plant is locally known as ''jajew'', and the leaves are used in local cuisine, cooked with both dried and fresh fish. The Bodos of north east India cook its leaves with fish, shrimp or pork which is much relished. Sometimes they add native lye called ''karwi'' to bring down its tartness and add flavour.

In the Philippines, the leaves and flowers are used to add sourness to the chicken dish ''tinola'' (chicken stew).{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In Vietnam, the young leaves, stems and fruits are used for cooking soups with fish or eel.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | first1=Yoshitaka | last1=Tanaka | first2=Nguyen | last2=Van Ke | date=2007 | title=Edible Wild Plants of Vietnam: The Bountiful Garden | publisher=Thailand: Orchid Press | isbn=9745240893 | page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mali, the dried and ground leaves, also called ''djissima'', are commonly used in Songhaï cuisine, in the regions of Timbuktu, Gao and their surroundings. It is the main ingredient in at least two dishes, one called ''djissima-gounday'', where rice is slowly cooked in a broth containing the leaves and lamb, and the other dish is called ''djissima-mafé'', where the leaves are cooked in a tomato sauce, also including lamb. Note that djissima-gounday is also considered an affordable dish.

[[Image:Mbo.jpg|left|thumb|A roselle drink]]

In the Caribbean, sorrel drink is made from [[sepal]]s of the roselle.  It is prepared by boiling dried sepals and calyces of the sorrel/flower of the plant in water for 8 to 10 minutes (or until the water turns red), then adding sugar. It is often served chilled. This is  done in [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Guyana]], [[Antigua]], [[Barbados]], [[Belize]], [[St. Lucia]], [[Dominica]], [[Grenada]], [[Jamaica]] and [[St. Kitts and Nevis]] where it is called ''sorrel''. The drink is one of several inexpensive beverages (''aguas frescas'') commonly consumed in Mexico and Central America; they are typically made from fresh fruits, juices or extracts. In Mexican restaurants in the US, the beverage is sometimes known simply as ''Jamaica'' ({{IPA-es|xaˈmai.ka}} HAH-MY-CAH). It is very popular in Trinidad and Tobago especially as a seasonal drink at Christmas where cinnamon, cloves and bay leaves are preferred to ginger.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.simplytrinicooking.com/sorrel-drink/]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also popular in Jamaica, usually flavored with rum.

In [[Mali]], [[Senegal]], [[The Gambia]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Ivory Coast]] and [[Benin]] calyces are used to prepare cold, sweet drinks popular in social events, often mixed with mint leaves, dissolved menthol candy, and/or fruit flavors.

The Middle Eastern and Sudanese "Karkade" (كركديه) is a cold drink made by soaking the dried Karkade calyces in cold water overnight in a refrigerator with sugar and some lemon or lime juice added. It is then consumed with or without ice cubes after the flowers have been strained.&lt;ref&gt;[http://honestcooking.com/karkadeh-a-sweet-hibiscus-tea/ Karkadeh: A Sweet Hibiscus Tea]&lt;/ref&gt; In Lebanon, toasted pine nuts are sometimes added.

Roselle is used in Nigeria to make a refreshing drink known as Zobo and natural fruit juices of pineapple and watermelon are added. Ginger is also sometimes added to the refreshing drink.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allnigerianrecipes.com/drinks/zobo-drink.html How to Make Nigerian Zobo Drink aka Zoborodo]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent in the U.S. of interest in south-of-the-border cuisine, the calyces are sold in bags usually labeled "flor de Jamaica" and have long been available in health food stores in the U.S. for making [[tea]]. In addition to being a popular homemade drink, [[Jarritos]], a popular brand of Mexican soft drinks, makes a flor de Jamaica flavored carbonated beverage. Imported Jarritos can be readily found in the U.S.

In the US, a beverage known as '''hibiscus cooler''' is made from the tea, a sweetener, and sometimes juice of apple, grape or lemon. The beverage is sold by some juice companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rwknudsenfamily.com/products/juice-blends/hibiscus-cooler|title=Hibiscus Cooler|website=R.W. Knudsen Family|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the dried calyces and ready-made sorrel syrup are widely and cheaply available in Caribbean and Asian grocers. The fresh calyces are imported mainly during December and January to make Christmas and New Year infusions, which are often made into cocktails with rum. They are very perishable, rapidly developing fungal rot, and need to be used soon after purchase — unlike the dried product, which has a long shelf-life.

In [[Africa]], especially the [[Sahel]], roselle is commonly used to make a sugary [[herbal tea]] that is sold on the street. The dried flowers can be found in every market. Roselle tea is quite common in [[Italy]] where it spread during the first decades of the 20th century as a typical product of the Italian colonies. The [[Carib Brewery Trinidad Limited]], a [[Trinidad and Tobago]] brewery, produces a '[[Shandy]] Sorrel' in which the tea is combined with beer.

In Thailand, roselle is generally drunk as a cool drink,&lt;ref&gt;[http://picpost.mthai.com/view/34192 Thai Roselle cool drink]&lt;/ref&gt; and it can be made into a wine.

Hibiscus flowers are commonly found in commercial herbal teas, especially teas advertised as berry-flavoured, as they give a bright red colouring to the drink.

Rosella flowers are sold as wild hibiscus flowers in syrup in Australia as a gourmet product. Recipes include filling them with goats cheese; serving them on baguette slices baked with brie; and placing one plus a little syrup in a champagne flute before adding the champagne — the bubbles cause the flower to open.

===Jam and preserves===

In Nigeria, rosella jam has been made since colonial times and is still sold regularly at community fetes and charity stalls. It is similar in flavour to plum jam, although more acidic. It differs from other jams in that the [[pectin]] is obtained from boiling the interior buds of the rosella flowers. It is thus possible to make rosella jam with nothing but rosella buds and sugar.

In Burma, the buds of the roselle are made into 'preserved fruits' or jams. Depending on the method and the preference, the seeds are removed or included. The jams, made from roselle buds and sugar, are red and tangy.

In India, Roselle is commonly made into a type of [[South Asian pickles|pickle]].

"Sorrel jelly" is manufactured in Trinidad.

Rosella jam is made in [[Queensland]], [[Australia]] as a home-made or speciality product sold at fetes and other community events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ezimerchant Professional |url=http://www.bushtuckershop.com/prod30.htm |title=Rosella Jam 120g |publisher=Bushtuckershop.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Herbal medicine (high blood pressure)===
Although a 2010 [[meta-analysis]] conducted by the [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane]] hypertension group concluded "No studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Ngamjarus C, Pattanittum P, Somboonporn C | title = Roselle for hypertension in adults |journal = [[Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews]] | date = 2010 | issue = 1 | id = CD007894 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007894.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; a more recent meta-survey (2015) in the [[Journal of Hypertension]] suggests a typical reduction in blood pressure of around 7.5/3.5 units (systolic/diastolic).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Serban C, Sahebkar A, Ursoniu S, Andrica F, Banach M | title = Effect of sour tea (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) on arterial hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials |journal = [[Journal of Hypertension]] | date = 2015 | issue = 33.6 | doi = 10.1097/HJH.0000000000000585}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[China]] and [[Thailand]] are the largest producers and control much of the world supply. Thailand invested heavily in roselle production, and their product is of superior quality. China's product, with less stringent quality control practices, is less reliable and reputable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/3/a-av006e.pdf HIBISCUS Post-harvest Operations page 4]&lt;/ref&gt; The world's best roselle comes from the [[Sudan]], but the quantity is low and poor processing hampers quality. Mexico, Egypt, Senegal, Tanzania, Mali and Jamaica are also important suppliers but production is mostly used domestically.&lt;ref name="www_fao_org1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fao.org/inpho/content/compend/text/ch28/ch28.htm | title = fao.org | accessdate = 2007-08-25 | publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Indian subcontinent]] (especially in the [[Ganges Delta]] region), roselle is cultivated for vegetable fibres. Roselle is called meśta (or meshta, the ''ś'' indicating an ''sh'' sound) in the region. Most of its fibres are locally consumed. However, the fibre (as well as cuttings or butts) from the roselle plant has great demand in natural fibre using industries.

Roselle is a relatively new crop to create an industry in Malaysia. It was introduced in the early 1990s and its commercial planting was first promoted in 1993 by the Department of Agriculture in Terengganu. The planted acreage was {{Convert|12.8|ha|acre|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} in 1993 and steadily increased to peak at {{Convert|506|ha|acre|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} by 2000. The planted area is now less than {{Convert|150|ha|acre|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} annually, planted with two main varieties.{{Citation needed|reason=date-June 2009|date=June 2009}}&lt;!-- Are these figures correct? They seem very small for a whole country... If correct, is Malasia worth mentioning at all..?--&gt; Terengganu state used to be the first and the largest producer, but now the production has spread more to other states. Despite the dwindling hectarage over the past decade or so, roselle is becoming increasingly known to the general population as an important pro-health drink. To a small extent, the calyces are also processed into sweet pickle, jelly and jam.

==Crop research==

In the initial years, limited research work was conducted by University Malaya and Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute (MARDI). Research work at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) was initiated in 1999. In many respects, the amount of research work is considered{{by whom|date=November 2015}} meagre in supporting a growing roselle industry in Malaysia.

===Crop genetic resources and improvement===

Genetic variation is important for plant breeders to increase crop productivity. Being an introduced species in Malaysia, there is a very limited number of germplasm accessions available for breeding.

UKM maintains a working germplasm collection and conducts agronomic research and crop improvement.

===Mutation breeding===

Conventional hybridization is difficult to carry out in roselle due to its [[cleistogamy|cleistogamous]] nature of reproduction. Because of this, a mutation breeding programme was initiated to generate new genetic variability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fnca.mext.go.jp/english/mb/e_ws_2005.html |title=FNCA 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of induced mutations for its improvement was initiated in 1999 in cooperation with MINT (now called Malaysian Nuclear Agency) and has produced some promising breeding lines. Roselle is a tetraploid species; thus, segregating populations require longer time to achieve fixation as compared to diploid species. In April 2009, UKM launched three new varieties named UKMR-1, UKMR-2 and UKMR-3. These new varieties were developed using Arab as the parent variety in a mutation breeding programme which started in 2006.

===Natural outcrossing under local conditions===

A study was conducted to estimate the amount of outcrossing under local conditions in Malaysia. It was found that outcrossing occurred at a very low rate of about 0.02%. However, this rate is much lower in comparison to estimates of natural cross-pollination of between 0.20% and 0.68% as reported in Jamaica.

==Phytochemicals==
The ''Hibiscus'' leaves are a good source of [[Polyphenol|polyphenolic compounds]]. The major identified compounds include [[neochlorogenic acid]], [[chlorogenic acid]], [[cryptochlorogenic acid]], [[caffeoylshikimic acid]] and [[flavonoid]] compounds such as [[quercetin]], [[kaempferol]] and their derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;Zhen, Jing, et al. "Phytochemistry, antioxidant capacity, total phenolic content and anti-inflammatory activity of Hibiscus sabdariffa leaves." Food chemistry 190 (2016): 673-680&lt;/ref&gt; The flowers are rich in [[anthocyanin]]s, as well as [[protocatechuic acid]]. The dried calyces contain the [[flavonoids]] [[gossypetin]], [[hibiscetine]] and [[sabdaretine]]. The major pigment, formerly reported as [[hibiscin]], has been identified as [[daphniphylline]]. Small amounts of [[myrtillin]] (delphinidin 3-monoglucoside), [[chrysanthenin]] (cyanidin 3-monoglucoside), and [[delphinidin]] are present. Roselle seeds are a good source of lipid-soluble antioxidants, particularly [[gamma-tocopherol]].&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed R. Fernandez J. Pineda M. Aguilar M.."Roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa) seed oil is a rich source of gamma-tocopherol." ''Journal of Food Science''. 72(3):S207-11, 2007 Apr.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=September 2015}}

In the broadest definition, a '''sensor''' is a device, module, or subsystem whose purpose is to detect events or changes in its environment and send the information to other electronics, frequently a [[computer processor]].  A sensor is always used with other electronics.

Sensors are used in everyday objects such as touch-sensitive elevator buttons ([[tactile sensor]]) and lamps which dim or brighten by touching the base, besides innumerable applications of which most people are never aware. With advances in [[micromachinery]] and easy-to-use [[microcontroller]] platforms, the uses of sensors have expanded beyond the traditional fields of temperature, pressure or flow measurement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Control Engineering 1930–1955 |last=Bennett |first=S. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1993 |publisher=Peter Peregrinus Ltd. on behalf of the Institution of Electrical Engineers |location=London |isbn=0-86341-280-7 |pages= |postscript=&lt;The source states "controls" rather than "sensors", so its applicability is assumed. Many units are derived from the basic measurements to which it refers, such as a liquid's level measured by a differential pressure sensor.&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example into [[Attitude and heading reference system|MARG sensors]]. Moreover, analog sensors such as [[potentiometer]]s and [[force-sensing resistor]]s are still widely used. Applications include manufacturing and machinery, airplanes and aerospace, cars, medicine, robotics and many other aspects of our day-to-day life.

A sensor's sensitivity indicates how much the sensor's output changes when the input quantity being measured changes. For instance, if the mercury in a thermometer moves 1&amp;nbsp; cm when the temperature changes by 1&amp;nbsp;°C, the sensitivity is 1&amp;nbsp;cm/°C (it is basically the slope Dy/Dx assuming a linear characteristic). Some sensors can also affect what they measure; for instance, a room temperature thermometer inserted into a hot cup of liquid cools the liquid while the liquid heats the thermometer.  Sensors are usually designed to have a small effect on what is measured; making the sensor smaller often improves this and may introduce other advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Jihong Yan| title=Machinery Prognostics and Prognosis Oriented Maintenance Management| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbzlBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA107| page=107| year=2015| publisher=Wiley &amp; Sons Singapore Pte. Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Technological progress allows more and more sensors to be manufactured on a [[microscopic scale]] as microsensors using [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] technology. In most cases, a microsensor reaches a significantly higher speed and sensitivity compared with [[macroscopic]] approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Jihong Yan| title=Machinery Prognostics and Prognosis Oriented Maintenance Management| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbzlBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA108| page=108| year=2015| publisher=Wiley &amp; Sons Singapore Pte. Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Ganesh Kumar| title=Modern General Knowledge| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DbnFSqKSVb0C&amp;pg=PA194| page=194| isbn=81-7482-180-5| publisher=Upkar Prakashan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification of measurement errors==
[[File:Infrared Transceiver Circuit.jpg|thumb|An infrared sensor]]

A good sensor obeys the following rules: {{citation needed|date=August 2014}}:
* it is sensitive to the measured property
* it is insensitive to any other property likely to be encountered in its application, and
* it does not influence the measured property.

Most sensors have a [[Linearity|linear]] [[transfer function]].  The [[sensitivity (electronics)|sensitivity]] is then defined as the ratio between the output signal and measured property. For example, if a sensor measures temperature and has a voltage output, the sensitivity is a constant with the units [V/K].  The sensitivity is the slope of the transfer function.  Converting the sensor's electrical output (for example V) to the measured units (for example K) requires dividing the electrical output by the slope (or multiplying by its reciprocal).  In addition, an offset is frequently added or subtracted.  For example, -40 must be added to the output if 0 V output corresponds to -40 C input.

For an analog sensor signal to be processed, or used in digital equipment, it needs to be converted to a digital signal, using an [[analog-to-digital converter]].

===Sensor deviations===
Since sensors cannot replicate an ideal [[transfer function]], several types of deviations can occur which limit sensor [[Accuracy and precision|accuracy]]:
* Since the range of the output signal is always limited, the output signal will eventually reach a minimum or maximum when the measured property exceeds the limits. The [[full scale]] range defines the maximum and minimum values of the measured property. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
* The [[sensitivity (electronics)|sensitivity]] may in practice differ from the value specified. This is called a sensitivity error.  This is an error in the slope of a linear transfer function.
* If the output signal differs from the correct value by a constant, the sensor has an offset error or [[bias]]. This is an error in the [[y-intercept]] of a linear transfer function.
* [[Nonlinearity]] is deviation of a sensor's transfer function from a straight line transfer function. Usually, this is defined by the amount the output differs from ideal behavior over the full range of the sensor, often noted as a percentage of the full range.
* Deviation caused by rapid changes of the measured property over time is a [[dynamics (physics)|dynamic]] error. Often, this behavior is described with a [[bode plot]] showing sensitivity error and phase shift as a function of the frequency of a periodic input signal.
* If the output signal slowly changes independent of the measured property, this is defined as [[drift (telecommunication)|drift]]. Long term drift over months or years is caused by physical changes in the sensor.
* [[Noise]] is a random deviation of the signal that varies in time.
* A [[hysteresis]] error causes the output value to vary depending on the previous input values.  If a sensor's output is different depending on whether a specific input value was reached by increasing vs. decreasing the input, then the sensor has a hysteresis error.
* If the sensor has a digital output, the output is essentially an approximation of the measured property. This error is also called [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]] error.
* If the signal is monitored digitally, the [[sampling frequency]] can cause a dynamic error, or if the input variable or added noise changes periodically at a frequency near a multiple of the sampling rate, [[aliasing]] errors may occur.
* The sensor may to some extent be sensitive to properties other than the property being measured. For example, most sensors are influenced by the temperature of their environment.

All these deviations can be classified as [[systematic error]]s or [[random errors]]. Systematic errors can sometimes be compensated for by means of some kind of [[calibration]] strategy. Noise is a random error that can be reduced by [[signal processing]], such as filtering, usually at the expense of the dynamic behavior of the sensor.

===Resolution===&lt;!-- This section is redirected to from [[Sensor resolution]] --&gt;
{{See also|Accuracy and precision}}
The resolution of a sensor is the smallest change it can detect in the quantity that it is measuring. The resolution of a sensor with a digital output is usually the resolution of the digital output. The resolution is related to the [[accuracy and precision|precision]] with which the measurement is made, but they are not the same thing.  A sensor's accuracy may be considerably worse than its resolution.

==Sensors in nature==
{{Further|Sense|Ion channel|Receptor (biochemistry)}}
All living organisms contain biological sensors with functions similar to those of the mechanical devices described. Most of these are specialized cells that are sensitive to:

* Light, motion, temperature, [[magnetic field]]s, [[gravity]], [[humidity]], [[moisture]], [[oscillation|vibration]], pressure, [[electrical field]]s, [[sound]], and other physical aspects of the external environment
* Physical aspects of the internal environment, such as [[stretching|stretch]], motion of the organism, and position of appendages ([[proprioception]])
* Environmental molecules, including [[toxin]]s, [[nutrient]]s, and [[pheromone]]s
* Estimation of biomolecules interaction and some kinetics parameters
* Internal metabolic indicators, such as [[glucose]] level, [[oxygen]] level, or [[osmolality]]
* Internal signal molecules, such as [[hormone]]s, [[neurotransmitter]]s, and [[cytokine]]s

==Chemical sensor==
A chemical sensor is a self-contained analytical device that can provide information about the chemical composition of its environment, that is, a [[liquid]] or a [[gas phase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bǎnicǎ|first=Florinel-Gabriel|title=Chemical Sensors and Biosensors:Fundamentals and Applications|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Chichester, UK|isbn=978-1-118-35423-0|page=576}}&lt;/ref&gt; The information is provided in the form of a measurable physical signal that is correlated with the [[concentration]] of a certain chemical species (termed as [[analyte]]). Two main steps are involved in the functioning of a chemical sensor, namely, recognition and [[Signal transduction|transduction]]. In the recognition step, analyte molecules interact selectively with [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor molecules]] or sites included in the structure of the recognition element of the sensor. Consequently, a characteristic physical parameter varies and this variation is reported by means of an integrated [[transducer]] that generates the output signal.
A chemical sensor based on recognition material of biological nature is a [[biosensor]]. However, as synthetic [[biomimetic]] materials are going to substitute to some extent recognition biomaterials, a sharp distinction between a biosensor and a standard chemical sensor is superfluous. Typical biomimetic materials used in sensor development are [[molecularly imprinted polymer]]s and [[aptamer]]s.

==Biosensor==
{{Main|Biosensor}}
In biomedicine and biotechnology, sensors which detect analytes thanks to a biological component, such as cells, protein, nucleic acid or biomimetic polymers, are called [[biosensor]]s.
Whereas a non-biological sensor, even organic (=carbon chemistry), for biological analytes is referred to as sensor or nanosensor. This terminology applies for both in-vitro and in vivo applications.
The encapsulation of the biological component in biosensors, presents a slightly different problem that ordinary sensors; this can either be done by means of a [[semipermeable membrane|semipermeable barrier]], such as a [[dialysis]] membrane or a [[hydrogel]], or a 3D polymer matrix, which either physically constrains the sensing macromolecule or chemically constrains the macromolecule by bounding it to the scaffold.

'''Bobby Stanley Pons''' (born August 23, 1943) is an American electrochemist known for his work with [[Martin Fleischmann]] on [[cold fusion]] in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/421667/nuclear-fusion/259125/Cold-fusion-and-bubble-fusion#ref917674 "Nuclear fusion"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2011, accessed May 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Pons was born in [[Valdese, North Carolina]]. He attended Valdese High School, then Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where he studied chemistry. He began his PhD studies in chemistry at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, but left before completing his PhD. His thesis resulted in a paper, co-authored in 1967 with Harry B. Mark, his adviser. ''The New York Times'' wrote that it pioneered a way to measure the spectra of chemical reactions on the surface of an electrode.&lt;ref name=broad /&gt;

He decided to finish his PhD in England at the [[University of Southampton]], where in 1975 he met Martin Fleischmann. Pons was a student in Professor [[Alan Bewick]]'s group; he earned his PhD in 1978.&lt;ref name=broad /&gt;

==Career==
On March 23, 1989, while Pons was the chairman of the chemistry department at the [[University of Utah]],&lt;ref name="broad"&gt;{{cite news | title = Brilliance and Recklessness Seen in Fusion Collaboration | author = William J.

'''Starting fluid''' is a [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]], [[flammable liquid]] which is used to aid the starting of [[internal combustion engine]]s, especially during cold weather or in engines that are difficult to start using conventional starting procedures. It is typically available in an [[aerosol spray]] can, and may sometimes be used for starting direct injected diesel engines or [[lean burn]] spark engines running on [[alcohol fuel]]. Some modern starting fluid products contain mostly volatile [[hydrocarbon]]s such as [[heptane]], (the main component of natural gasoline) with a small portion of diethyl ether, and [[carbon dioxide]] (as a propellant).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crcindustries.com/faxdocs/msds/5671.pdf|title=CRC JUMP START Starting Fluid }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://s7d9.scene7.com/is/content/GenuinePartsCompany/716677pdf?$PDF$ |title=NAPA Premium Starting Fluid}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some formulations contain [[butane]] or [[propane]] as both propellant and starting fuel. Historically, [[Diethyl ether]], with a small amount of oil, a trace amount of a [[Diethyl ether#Safety and Stability|stabilizer]] and a hydrocarbon propellant has been used to help start internal combustion engines because of its low {{convert|160|C|F}} [[autoignition temperature]]. &lt;ref name="MSDS"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hazard.com/msds/mf/baker/baker/files/e2340.htm | title = Ethyl Ether MSDS | publisher = J.T. Baker | accessdate = 2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diethyl ether is distinct from [[petroleum ether]] (a crude oil distillate consisting mostly of [[pentane]] and other [[alkanes]]) which has also been used for starting engines.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Usage==

===Four stroke engines===
Starting fluid is sprayed into the engine intake near the air filter, or into the carburetor bore or a spark plug hole of an engine to get added fuel to the combustion cylinder quickly. Using starting fluid to get the engine running faster avoids wear to starters and fatigue to one's arm with pull start engines, especially on rarely used machines. Other uses include cold weather starting, vehicles that run out of fuel and thus require extra time to restore fuel pressure, and sometimes with flooded engines. Mechanics sometimes use it to diagnose starting problems by determining whether the spark and ignition system of the vehicle is functioning; if the spark is adequate but the fuel delivery system is not, the engine will run until the starting fluid vapors are consumed.  It is used more often with [[carburetor|carbureted]] engines than with [[fuel injection]] systems.  Caution is required when using starting fluid with [[diesel engines]] that have preheat systems in the intake or glow-plugs installed, as the starting fluid may pre-ignite, leading to engine damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The immediate engine damage that can result from ether starting fluid use|url=http://www.thetruckstop.us/forum/threads/the-immediate-engine-damage-that-can-result-from-ether-starting-fluid-use.46065/|website=The Truck Stop|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WikiHow&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Start a Diesel Truck|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Start-a-Diesel-Truck|work=WikiHow|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two stroke engines===
Starting fluid is not recommended for regular use with some [[two-stroke engines]] because it does not possess lubricating qualities by itself. [[Two-stroke_engine#Lubrication|Lubrication for two-stroke engines]] is achieved using oil that is either mixed into the fuel by the user or injected automatically into the fuel supply; engines requiring premixed fuel that are run solely on starting fluid do not receive an adequate supply of lubrication to their crankcase and cylinder(s). Engines that haven't been run recently are especially vulnerable to damage from oil starvation; starting fluid, a strong solvent, tends to strip residual oil off of cranks and cylinder walls, further reducing lubrication during the period of fuel starvation. [[WD-40]] was previously recommended for use on two stroke engines because it has lubricating qualities,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} however, the formulation with non-flammable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as propellant instead of propane no longer has the same propulsive effect.

===Abuse===
Diethyl ether has a long history as a medical [[Diethyl ether#Anesthetic use|anesthetic]]; when starting fluid was mostly ether, a similar effect could be obtained using it.  Use at the present time directly as an [[inhalant]] includes the effect of the petroleum solvents, which are more toxic as inhalants than diethyl ether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncadi.samhsa.gov/govpubs/PHD631/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208154546/http://ncadi.samhsa.gov/govpubs/phd631/ |archivedate=2008-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medem.com/medlib/article/ZZZ5B6O2B7C&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes referred to as "passing the shirt," the starting fluid is sprayed on a piece of cloth and held up to one's face for inhalation. This trend has gradually picked up since the turn of the century, as phrases such as "etherized" and "ethervision" have gained popularity. The effects of inhalation vary, but have been known to include lightheadedness, loss of coordination, paranoia, and sometimes hallucinations.

A '''steam hammer''', also called a '''drop hammer''', is an industrial [[power hammer]] driven by steam that is used for tasks such as shaping [[forging]]s and driving piles. Typically the hammer is attached to a [[piston]] that slides  within a fixed [[Pneumatic cylinder|cylinder]], but in some designs the hammer is attached to a cylinder that slides along a fixed piston.

The concept of the steam hammer was described by [[James Watt]] in 1784, but it was not until 1840 that the first working steam hammer was built to meet the needs of forging increasingly large iron or steel components. In 1843 there was an acrimonious dispute between [[François Bourdon]] of France and [[James Nasmyth]] of Britain over who had invented the machine. Bourdon had built the first working machine, but Nasmyth claimed it was built from a copy of his design.

Steam hammers proved to be invaluable in many industrial processes. Technical improvements gave greater control over the force delivered, greater longevity, greater efficiency and greater power. A steam hammer built in 1891 by the [[Bethlehem Iron Company]] delivered a 125-ton blow. In the 20th century steam hammers were gradually displaced in forging by mechanical and hydraulic presses, but some are still in use. Compressed air power hammers, descendants of the early steam hammers, are still manufactured.

==Mechanism==
[[File:Steam hydraulic hammer (Rankin Kennedy, Modern Engines, Vol VI).jpg|thumb|A single-frame double-acting steam hammer]]
A single-acting steam hammer is raised by the pressure of steam injected into the lower part of a cylinder and drops under gravity when the pressure is released. With the more common double-acting steam hammer, steam is also used to push the ram down, giving a more powerful blow at the die.{{sfn|Das|2010|p=548}}
The weight of the ram may range from {{convert|225|to|22500|kg|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}.{{sfn|Kaushish|2010|p=720}}
The piece being worked is placed between a bottom die resting on an anvil block and a top die attached to the ram (hammer).{{sfn|Sharma|2007|p=239-240}}

Hammers are subject to repeated concussion, which could cause fracturing of cast iron components. The early hammers were therefore made from a number of parts bolted together. 
This made it cheaper to replace broken parts, and also gave a degree of elasticity that made fracture less likely.{{sfn|Winton|Millar|1883|p=50}}

A steam hammer may have one or two supporting frames. The single frame design lets the operator move around the [[Die (manufacturing)|dies]] more easily, while the double frame can support a more powerful hammer. The frame(s) and the anvil block are mounted on wooden beams that protect the concrete foundations by absorbing the shock.{{sfn|Sharma|2007|p=239-240}}
Deep foundations are needed, but a large steam drop hammer will still shake the building that holds it. 
This may be solved with a counterblow steam hammer, in which two converging rams drive the top and bottom dies together. The upper ram is driven down and the lower ram is pulled or driven up. These hammers produce a large impact and can make large forgings.{{sfn|Sharma|2007|p=243-244}}
They can be installed with smaller foundations than anvil hammers of similar force.{{sfn|Altan|2005|p=137}}
Counterblow hammers are not often used in the United States, but are common in Europe.{{sfn|Altan|2005|p=136}}

With some early steam hammers an operator moved the valves by hand, controlling each blow. With others the valve action was automatic, allowing for rapid repetitive hammering. Automatic hammers could give an elastic blow, where steam cushioned the piston towards the end of the down stroke, or a dead blow with no cushioning. The elastic blow gave a quicker rate of hammering, but less force than the dead blow.{{sfn|Winton|Millar|1883|p=52}}
Machines were built that could run in either mode according to the job requirement.{{sfn|Winton|Millar|1883|p=53}}
The force of the blow could be controlled by varying the amount of steam introduced to cushion the blow.{{sfn|Rajput|2007|p=155}}
A modern air/steam hammer can deliver up to 300 blows per minute.{{sfn|Sharma|2007|p=243}}

==History==
[[File:James Watt by Henry Howard.jpg|thumb|[[James Watt]] (1736–1819) described the concept of a steam hammer]]

===Concept===
The possibility of a steam hammer was noted by [[James Watt]] (1736–1819) in his 28 April 1784 patent for an improved steam engine.{{sfn|Whitlow|2011}}
Watt described "Heavy Hammers or Stampers, for forging or stamping iron, copper, or other metals, or other matters without the intervention of rotative motions or wheels, by fixing the Hammer or Stamper to be so worked, either directly to the piston or piston rod of the engine."{{sfn|Rowlandson|1875|p=10}}
Watt's design had the cylinder at one end of a wooden beam and the hammer at the other. 
The hammer did not move vertically, but in the arc of a circle.{{sfn|Brande|Cox|1867|p=593}}
On 6 June 1806 W. Deverell, engineer of Surrey, filed a patent for a steam-powered hammer or stamper.
The hammer would be welded to a piston rod contained in a cylinder. Steam from a boiler would be let in under the piston, raising it and compressing the air above it. The steam would then be released and the compressed air would force the piston down.{{sfn|Rowlandson|1875|p=10}}

In August 1827 John Hague was awarded a patent for a method of working cranes and tilt-hammers driven by a piston in an oscillating cylinder where air power supplied the motive force. A partial vacuum was made in one end of a long cylinder by an air pump worked by a steam engine or some other power source, and atmospheric pressure drove the piston into that end of the cylinder. When a valve was reversed, the vacuum was formed in the other end and the piston forced in the opposite direction.{{sfn|Patent granted to John Hague 1827}}
Hague made a hammer to this design for planishing frying pans. Many years later, when discussing the advantages of air over steam for delivering power, it was recalled that Hague's air hammer "worked with such an extraordinary rapidity that it was impossible to see where the hammer was in working, and the effect was seemed more like giving one continuous pressure." However, it was not possible to regulate the force of the blows.{{sfn|Grimshaw|1865|p=331}}

===Invention===
[[File:PSM V38 D349 The nasmyth steam hammer.jpg|thumb|The Nasmyth steam hammer]]
It seems probable that the Scottish Engineer [[James Nasmyth]] (1808–1890) and his French counterpart [[François Bourdon]] (1797–1865) reinvented the steam hammer independently in 1839, both trying to solve the same problem of forging shafts and cranks for the increasingly large steam engines used in locomotives and paddle boats.{{sfn|Chomienne|1888|p=254}}
In Nasmyth's 1883 "autobiography", written by [[Samuel Smiles]], he described how the need arose for a paddle shaft for [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'s new translatlantic steamer ''[[SS Great Britain]]'', with a {{convert|30|in}} diameter shaft, larger than any that had been previously forged. He came up with his steam hammer design, making a sketch dated 24 November 1839, but the immediate need disappeared when the practicality of screw propellers was demonstrated and the ''Great Britain'' was converted to that design.
Nasmyth showed his design to all visitors.{{sfn|Boutany|1885|p=59}}

Bourdon came up with the idea of what he called a "Pilon" in 1839 and made detailed drawings of his design, which he also showed to all engineers who visited the works at [[Le Creusot]] owned by the brothers [[Adolphe Schneider|Adolphe]] and [[Eugène Schneider]].{{sfn|Boutany|1885|p=59}}
However, the Schneiders hesitated to build Bourdon's radical new machine.
Bourdon and Eugène Schneider visited the Nasmyth works in England in the middle of 1840, where they were shown Nasmyth's sketch.
This confirmed the feasibility of the concept to Schneider.{{sfn|Chomienne|1888|p=254}} 
In 1840 Bourdon built the first steam hammer in the world at the [[Schneider &amp; Cie]] works at Le Creusot.
It weighed {{convert|2500|kg}} and lifted to {{convert|2|m}}. The Schneiders patented the design in 1841.{{sfn|François BOURDON: Archives Côte d’Or}}

Nasmyth visited Le Creusot in April 1842. By his account, Bourdon took him to the forge department so he might, as he said, "see his own child".  Nasmyth said "there it was, in truth&amp;ndash;a thumping child of my brain!"{{sfn|Boutany|1885|p=59}}
After returning from France in 1842 Nasmyth built his first steam hammer in his [[Patricroft]] foundry in [[Manchester]], [[England]], adjacent to the (then new) [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] and the [[Bridgewater Canal]].{{sfn|Nasmyth|Smiles|1883|p=259}}
In 1843 a dispute broke out between Nasmyth and Bourdon over priority of invention of the steam hammer. Nasmyth, an excellent publicist, managed to convince many people that he was the first.{{sfn|Nasmyth steam hammer}}

===Early improvements===
[[File:Steam hammer, Bolton University - geograph.org.uk - 1741851.jpg|thumb|Nasmyth &amp; Wilson steam hammer at the [[University of Bolton]]]]
Nasmyth's first steam hammer, described in his patent of 9 December 1842, was built for the [[Low Moor Works]] at Bradford.
They rejected the machine, but on 18 August 1843 accepted an improved version with a self-acting gear.{{sfn|Evans|2004|p=58}}
[[Robert Wilson (engineer)|Robert Wilson]] (1803–1882), who had also invented the screw propeller and was manager of Nasmyth's Bridgewater works, invented the self-acting motion that made it possible to adjust the force of the blow delivered by the hammer &amp;ndash; a critically important improvement.{{sfn|Rowlandson|1875|p=34}}
An early writer said of Wilson's gear, "... I would be prouder to say that I was the inventor of that motion, then to say I had commanded a regiment at Waterloo..."{{sfn|Evans|2004|p=58}}
Nasmyth's steam hammers could now vary the force of the blow across a wide range.  
Nasmyth was fond of breaking an egg placed in a wineglass without breaking the glass, followed by a blow that shook the building.{{sfn|Nasmyth|Smiles|1883|p=259}}

By 1868 engineers had introduced further improvements to the original design. John Condie's steam hammer, built for Fulton in Glasgow, had a stationary piston and a moving cylinder to which the hammer was attached. The piston was hollow, and was used to deliver steam to the cylinder and then remove it. 
The hammer weighed 6.5 tons with a stroke of {{convert|7.5|ft}}.{{sfn|Artizan Club (Great Britain)|1868|p=301}}
Condie steam hammers were used to forge the shafts of Isambard Kingdom Brunel's ''[[SS Great Eastern]]''.{{sfn|Condie|1860|p=142}}
A high-speed compressed-air hammer was described in ''[[The Mechanics' Magazine]]'' in 1865, 
a variant of the steam hammer for use where steam power was not available or a very dry environment was required.{{sfn|Grimshaw|1865|p=329}}

The [[Bowling Ironworks]] steam hammers had the steam cylinder bolted to the back of the hammer, thus reducing the height of the machine.{{sfn|Artizan Club (Great Britain)|1868|p=301}}
These were designed by John Charles Pearce, who took out a patent for his steam hammer design several years before Nasmyth's patent expired.{{sfn|Cudworth|1891|p=234}}
[[Marie-Joseph Farcot]] of Paris  proposed a number of improvements including an arrangement so the steam acted from above, increasing the striking force, improved valve arrangements and the use of springs and material to absorb the shock and prevent breakage.{{sfn|Artizan Club (Great Britain)|1868|p=301}}{{sfn|Patent office|1871|p=1900}}
[[John Ramsbottom (engineer)|John Ramsbottom]] invented a duplex hammer, with two rams moving horizontally towards a forging placed between them.{{sfn|Tomkins|1878|p=343}}

Using the same principles of operation, Nasmyth developed a steam-powered [[pile driver|pile-driving machine]].  At its first use at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]], a dramatic contest was carried out.  His engine drove a pile in four and half minutes compared to the twelve hours that the conventional method required.{{sfn|Nasmyth|Smiles|1883|p=263}}
It was soon found that a hammer with a relatively short fall height was more effective than a taller machine. The shorter machine could deliver many more blows in a given time, driving the pile faster even though each blow was smaller. It also caused less damage to the pile.{{sfn|Rajapakse|2011|p=350}}

Riveting machines designed by Garforth and Cook were based on the steam hammer.{{sfn|Artizan Club (Great Britain)|1868|p=302}}
The catalog for [[the Great Exhibition]] held in London in 1851 said of Garforth's design, "With this machine, one man and three boys can rivet with perfect ease, and in the firmest manner, at the rate of six rivets per minute, or three hundred and sixty per hour."{{sfn|1851 Great Exhibition: Official Catalogue}}
Other variants included crushers to help extract iron ore from quartz and a hammer to drive holes in the rock of a quarry to hold gunpowder charges.{{sfn|Artizan Club (Great Britain)|1868|p=302}}
An 1883 book on modern steam practice said 
{{blockquote|The direct application of steam to forging hammers is beyond question the greatest improvement that has ever been made in forging machinery; not only has it simplified the operations that were carried on before its invention, but it has added many branches, and extended the art of forging, to purposes that could never have been attained except by the steam hammer. ... The steam hammer ... seems to be so perfectly adapted to fill the different conditions of power hammering that there seems nothing left to be desired...{{sfn|Winton|Millar|1883|p=51}} }}

===Later development===
[[File:Le Creusot - Marteau Pilon 5.jpg|thumb|The giant [[Creusot steam hammer]] built in 1877 by [[Schneider et Cie]] in [[Le Creusot]] ]]
Schneider &amp; Co. built 110 steam hammers between 1843 and 1867 with different sizes and strike rates, but trending towards ever larger machines to handle the demands of large cannon, engine shafts and armor plate, with steel increasingly used in place of wrought iron.
In 1861 the "Fritz" steam hammer came into operation at the [[Krupp]] works in [[Essen]], Germany.
With a 50-ton blow, for many years it was the most powerful in the world.{{sfn|Vogel|Shayt|1981|p=2}}

There is a story that the Fritz steam hammer took its name from a machinist named Fritz whom Alfred Krupp presented to the [[William I, German Emperor|Emperor William]] when he visited the works in 1877. Krupp told the emperor that Fritz had such perfect control of the machine that he could let the hammer drop without harming an object placed on the center of the block. The Emperor immediately put his watch, which was studded with diamonds, on the block and motioned Fritz to start the hammer. When the machinist hesitated, Krupp told him "Fritz let fly!" He did as he was told, the watch was unharmed, and the emperor gave Fritz the watch as a gift. Krupp had the words "Fritz let fly!" engraved on the hammer.{{sfn|Fritz Let Fly 1884}}

The Schneiders eventually saw a need for a hammer of colossal proportions.{{sfn|Vogel|Shayt|1981|p=2}}
The [[Creusot steam hammer]] was a giant steam hammer built in 1877 by [[Schneider and Co.]] in the French industrial town of [[Le Creusot]]. 
With the ability to deliver a blow of up to 100 tons, the Creusot hammer was the largest and most powerful in the world.{{sfn|Vogel|Shayt|1981|p=3}}
A wooden replica was built for the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)]] in Paris.
In 1891 the [[Bethlehem Iron Company]] of the [[United States]] purchased patent rights from Schneider and built a steam hammer of almost identical design but capable of delivering a 125-ton blow.{{sfn|Vogel|Shayt|1981|p=3}}

Eventually the great steam hammers became obsolete, displaced by hydraulic and mechanical presses. The presses applied force slowly and at a uniform rate, ensuring that the internal structure of the forging was uniform, without hidden internal flaws.{{sfn|Vogel|Shayt|1981|p=4}}
The 1877 Creusot steam hammer now stands as a monument in the Creusot town square.{{sfn|Vogel|Shayt|1981|p=4}}
An original Nasmyth hammer stands facing his foundry buildings (now a 'business park').  
A larger Nasmyth &amp; Wilson steam hammer stands in the campus of the [[University of Bolton]].

Steam hammers continue to be used for driving piles into the ground.{{sfn|Das|2010|p=548}}
Steam supplied by a circulating steam generator is more efficient than air.{{sfn|Venkatramaiah|1995|p=759}}
However, today compressed air is often used rather than steam.{{sfn|Rajapakse|2011|p=350}}
As of 2013 manufacturers continued to sell air/steam pile-driving hammers.{{sfn|Vulcan Single/Acting Hammers}}
Forging services suppliers also continue to use steam hammers of varying sizes based on classical designs.{{sfn|Hammers: Scot Forge}}

A '''thermoelectric battery''' stores energy when charged by converting heat into chemical energy and produces electricity when discharged. Such systems potentially offer an alternative means of disposing of [[waste heat]] from plants that burn fossil fuels and/or nuclear energy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gizmag.com/ammonia-battery-waste-heat-electricity/35089 |title=Ammonia-based battery system to convert low-grade waste heat into electricity |first= Colin |last= Jeffrey |date=December 7, 2014 |accessdate=February 2015|work = Gizmag}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Thomas Johann Seebeck]] (1780-1831) discovered the [[thermoelectric effect]] in 1821. The symmetrical [[Peltier Effect]] ([[Jean Charles Athanase Peltier|Jean Charles Athanse Peltier]], 1785-1845) uses an electric current to produce temperature differences. In the middle part of the twentieth century the thermo-electric generator was often used in place of [[galvanic cell|galvanic batteries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://physics.kenyon.edu/EarlyApparatus/Thermodynamics/Thermoelectric_Battery/Thermoelectric_Battery.html|title = Thermoelectric battery|date = 2014|accessdate = February 2015|website = |publisher =Kenyon College }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Copper/ammonia ==

In 2014 researchers demonstrated a prototype system that uses copper electrodes and ammonia as the electrolyte. The device converted some 29 percent of the battery's chemical energy into electricity.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

The ammonia [[electrolyte]] is only used as an [[anolyte]] (electrolyte surrounding an anode) that reacts with the copper electrode as waste heat warms the ammonia, generating electricity. When the reaction uses up the ammonia or depletes the copper ions in the electrolyte near the cathode the reaction stops.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Waste heat then is used to distill the ammonia from the used anolyte. The ammonia is then added to the cathode chamber. The battery's polarity reverses and the anode becomes the cathode and vice versa.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

The system's [[power density]] was some maximum power density of 60+-3 1 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;(based on a single electrode), with a  maximum energy density of 453 W h m&lt;sup&gt;−3 &lt;/sup&gt;(normalized to the electrolyte volume), substantially higher than that of other liquid-centered thermal-electrics.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2015/ee/c4ee02824d#!divAbstract|title = A thermally regenerative ammonia-based battery for efficient harvesting of low-grade thermal energy as electrical power|author1=Fang Zhang |author2=Jia Liu |author3=Wulin Yanga |author4=Bruce E.

Volatilization of ammonia from the spent anolyte by heating (simulating distillation), and re-addition of this ammonia to the spent catholyte chamber with subsequent operation of this chamber as the anode (to regenerate copper on the other electrode), produced a maximum power density of 60 ± 3 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, with an average discharge energy efficiency of 29% (electrical energy captured ''versus'' chemical energy in the starting solutions). An acid added to the catholyte increased power 126 ± 5 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Telluride ==

[[Telluride (chemistry)|Telluride]] based batteries convert 15 to 20 percent of heat to energy.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Fulvalene diruthenium ==
[[Fulvalene]] di[[ruthenium]] promises greater efficiency, but is too expensive for commercial use.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

'''Tungsten borides''' are compounds of [[tungsten]] and [[boron]]. Their most remarkable property is high hardness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4441">[[File:Vector inversion generator.png|alt=Vector inversion generator|thumb|A 3-stage discrete component vector inversion generator.]]
A '''vector inversion generator''' ('''VIG''') is an electric pulse compression and voltage multiplication device, allowing shaping a slower, lower voltage pulse to a narrower, higher-voltage one. VIGs are used in military technology, e.g. some [[directed-energy weapon]]s, as a secondary stage of another pulsed power source, commonly an [[explosive-driven ferroelectric generator]].

==Construction==
Discrete component VIGs (pictured) consist of a stack of well-coupled common mode chokes interconnected with a stack of capacitors. The inductors present a high inductance to currents that are in-phase in the two windings, and a far lower inductance when the winding currents are flowing in opposite directions.  The capacitors are charged with alternating polarity and when the switch (usually a triggered or free running spark gap in practice) is closed the voltage across every second capacitor rapidly inverts as a half cycle of oscillation at a frequency set by the capacitance resonating with the differential mode inductance of the chokes. At the same time the other capacitors discharge very slowly due to not having a differential current flowing to cancel the reactance.
So after a half period, all the capacitors are in series and the voltages add. 
This arrangement has a conceptual equivalence to the spiral VIG, with the alternating capacitors being equivalent to the capacitance between the windings and the common mode chokes being equivalent to the inductance of a winding.
Discrete components allow large lumped capacitors to be used thus storing much more energy, but have difficulty replicating the high voltage multiplication ratios and extremely short rise times of spiral transmission line types.

A spiral VIG consists of four alternating conductor-insulator-conductor-insulator sheets, wound into a cylinder, forming a [[capacitor]] also acting as a single-ended [[transmission line]], connected to a  [[spark gap]] switch. The capacitor is charged from a power source, e.g. an [[Explosive-driven ferroelectric generator|EDFEG]], then the spark gap fires after its [[breakdown voltage]] is reached. The [[electromagnetic wave]] created by the [[electric spark]] discharge travels along the transmission line, converting [[electrostatic field]] to [[electromagnetic field]], then after reflecting from the open end converts back to electrostatic field. A pulse of output amplitude 2nU (where n is the number of turns of the capacitor and U is the initial voltage it was charged to) and a rise time equal to twice the [[electrical length (transmission medium)|electrical length]] of the transmission line.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarsmine.mst.edu/post_prints/pdf/physics_09007dcc80588630.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boliven.com/patent/US7151330/drawings&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://shadaly.com/vector_inversion_generator_4507567.html&lt;/ref&gt; The device acts as a distributed [[pulse forming network]].

[[Ferrite (magnet)|Ferrite]]s can be attached to the VIG construction to modify its characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.findthatpatent.com/Apparatus_and_method_for_generating_high_voltages_using_a_voltage,7151330.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
VIGs are advantageous due to their simplicity and the very short pulse [[rise time]]s in range of nanoseconds. Some VIGs can be configured as part of a [[tuned circuit]], acting as [[oscillator]]s with practical upper limit of about 700 MHz, generating energy that can be radiated from a suitable [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]], allowing construction of very simple explosion-generated [[electromagnetic pulse]] generators.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.armysbir.com/Technologies/View.aspx?pk=45430111-708f-463e-8fe1-cf1392a6bf99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | url = http://www.devileye.net/catalog/rope_fastener/spiral_line_oscillator.html | title = Spiral line oscillator | accessdate = 2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of VIGs includes [[directed-energy weapon]]s, [[x-ray]] pulse power supplies, [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] generators, etc.

VIGs are simple enough to be constructed by high-voltage hobbyists.&lt;ref&gt;http://4hv.org/e107_plugins/forum/forum_viewtopic.php?43795.last&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencemadness.org/talk/viewthread.php?action=printable&amp;fid=6&amp;tid=6032&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2117">A '''very long chain fatty acid''' (VLCFA) is a [[fatty acid]] with 22 or more carbons.  Their biosynthesis occurs in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]].&lt;ref&gt;Jakobsson, Andreas; Westerberg, Rolf; Jacobsson, Anders "Fatty acid elongases in mammals: their regulation and roles in metabolism"  Progress in Lipid Research 2006, volume 45, pp. 237-249. {{DOI|10.1016/j.plipres.2006.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  VLCFA's can represent up to a few percent of the total fatty acid content of a cell.&lt;ref&gt;"Very-long-chain fatty acids from the animal and plant kingdoms" Rezanka, Tomas Progress in Lipid Research 1989, volume 28, pp. 147-87.  {{DOI|10.1016/0163-7827(89)90011-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most fatty acids, VLCFAs are too long to be metabolized in the [[mitochondria]], and must be metabolized in [[peroxisome]]s.

Certain peroxisomal disorders, such as [[adrenoleukodystrophy]] and [[Zellweger syndrome]], can be associated with an accumulation of VLCFAs.&lt;ref name=x-ald&gt;{{cite web|last=Kemp|first=Stephan and Watkins, Paul|title=Very long-chain fatty acids|url=http://www.x-ald.nl/biochemistry-genetics/vlcfa/|publisher=X-ald Database|accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vlcad-def&gt;{{cite web|title=Very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency|url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/very-long-chain-acyl-coa-dehydrogenase-deficiency|publisher=Genetics Home Reference, National Institutes of Health|accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Vintage (design)|Vintage]] musical equipment''' is older music gear, including [[musical instrument|instruments]], [[guitar amplifier|amplifiers and speaker]]s,  [[sound recording]] equipment and [[effects pedal]]s, sought after, maintained and used by [[record producer]]s, [[audio engineer]]s and musicians who are interested in historical music genres.  While any piece of equipment of sufficient age can be considered [[vintage]], in the 2010s the term is typically applied to instruments and gear from the 1970s and earlier. Guitars, amps, pedals, electric keyboards, [[sound recording]] equipment (e.g., [[reel to reel tape deck]]s and [[microphone]]s) from the 1950s to 1970s are particularly sought. Musical equipment from the 1940s and prior eras is often expensive, and sought out mainly by museums or collectors.

Older gear is often known for its unique tonal or sound-shaping qualities. The cost of vintage gear may be higher than the reissued model or its 2010s-era equivalent, depending on the rarity of the item, how high the demand is for it, and the condition.

As early as the 1970s, musicians began to recognize the value of older instruments from the 1940s and 1950s.  Among guitar aficionados, the mass production of both acoustic and electric guitars served to highlight the quality hand workmanship, crafting, finishing and materials of older instruments.  Historians such as [[George Gruhn]] helped to codify both the monetary value and sound quality of these instruments.

Examples of well-known vintage electric guitars include 1950s and 1960s era models like the [[Fender Stratocaster]] and [[Telecaster]], and the [[Gibson Les Paul]].  Although less well-known and not as financially valuable, older electric guitars under the names of [[Harmony Company|Harmony]], [[Danelectro]] or [[Kay Musical Instrument Company|Kay]] are becoming increasingly collectible.

Examples of well-known vintage acoustic guitars include [[C. F. Martin &amp; Company|Martin]] and [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] models typically built prior to the 1970s, 1920s to 1930s [[National String Instrument Corporation|Nationals]] and [[Dobro]]s, and 1930s era [[Recording King]]s, among others.

Prior to the popularity of [[electronic music]] in the 1980s and 1990s, electro-mechanical instruments such as the [[Fender Rhodes]] electric piano and the [[Hammond organ]] were widely used. The Hammond organ was a staple instrument in [[jazz]], [[blues]] and early [[rock and roll]] up through the 1970s.  [[Booker T. Jones]] famously played in on many recordings for [[Stax Records]] that helped define the sound of [[soul music]] in the 1960s that later musicians would want to achieve by adopting a Hammond of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Musical synthesizer]]s first came to [[popular music]] in the mid- to late-1960s and evolved through the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1970s, synthesizers were rare and expensive, and they were generally only owned by major [[recording studio]]s, [[record producer]]s and celebrity artists (e.g., [[Stevie Wonder]]). It was not until the release of Yamaha's [[DX-7]] that an affordable, mass-market digital synth became available to the general public. Because the technology was changing so quickly, many synthesizers were manufactured for a very short period of time and would later by sought after by musicians and collectors seeking unique or unusual sounds.

[[File:Orange AD30HTC and PPC412.jpg|thumb|165px|Orange [[amplifier]] and cabinet from the 2000s with a look reminiscent of the 1960s and 70s.]]

The first [[guitar amplifier]]s were made in the 1920s and 1930s using [[vacuum tube]]s and speakers to amplify an instrument's sound.  These tube amps remained the standard until the 1970s when transistors became cheaper to manufacture and maintain and lighter in weight.  During the 1980s, when most guitar amps being manufactured used "solid state" [[semiconductor]] technology, many musicians seeking an older style of sound favored older amps that used [[vacuum tube]]s (called "valves" in the UK).&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Gerald, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fvUVBP3wW1gC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+Desktop+Reference+of+Hip+Vintage+Guitar+Amps "A Desktop Reference of Hip Vintage Guitar Amps"], Hal Leonard Corporation, 1994. {{ISBN|0-9641060-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Popular vintage models include the [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] [[Fender Showman|Showman]], [[Fender Bassman|Bassman]] and [[Fender Vibroverb|Vibroverb]] amps, and older models made by [[Ampeg]], [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]], [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]], and [[Vox (musical equipment)#The AC30|Vox]],&lt;ref name="Fargen: 10 Amps"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fargen|first=Ben|title=10 Classic Guitar Amps &amp; The Songs That Made Them Famous|url=http://www.myrareguitars.com/10-classic-guitar-amps|publisher=My Rare Guitars.com|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other smaller companies such as [[Valco]], [[Danelectro]], and [[Multivox Premier|Premier]]. By the 1990s, many of these amplifiers had become so popular and sought after, that manufacturers began to [[reissue]] some models, while newer, smaller companies built new amps that boasted a "vintage sound". Some [[recording studio]]s have a selection of the most popular vintage guitar combo amps, amp heads and speaker stacks, so that performers can get a retro sound.

==Effects pedals==
{{Main|Effects unit}}
When electronic [[transistor]]s began to replace vacuum tubes, it became possible to fit aural effects [[electronic circuit|circuit]]s into a portable device.  These first [[effects pedal]]s —or "stompboxes", so called because a guitarist would stomp on one to activate it—were manufactured in the early 1960s and became popular through groups like [[The Kinks]] and [[The Rolling Stones]] by the middle of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Art of the Stompbox|year=2010|url=http://www.museumofmakingmusic.org/stompbox-birth|accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FuzzEffect: The Fuzz Story and Photos|url=http://www.fuzzeffect.com/|accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early pedals mainly created a [[distortion (music)|distortion]] or "fuzz-tone" effect, but with the arise of [[psychedelic rock]], more [[esoteric]] effects became popular.  Warwick Electronics manufactured the first [[wah-wah pedal]] in 1967 and that same year [[Roger Mayer (engineer)|Roger Mayer]] issued the first [[octave effect]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drozdowski|first=Ted|title=The Accidental Birth of the Wah-wah Pedal and How It Became the Signature Sound of Psychedelic Rock|url=http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/the-accidental-birth-of-the-wa/|date=June 30, 2008|accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayer|first=Roger|title=Octavia|url=http://www.roger-mayer.co.uk/octavia.htm|accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Photocell modulator deliver glorious vintage-vibed tones|url=https://audiobuyreviews.blogspot.in/2015/07/jhs-unicorn-analog-uni-vibe-pedal_43.html|accessdate=17 July 2016|work=audiobuyreviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year saw the arrival of [[Univox]]'s [[phase shift]]er and [[Chorus effect|chorus]] effect.  These pedals became favorite effects of guitarists like [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Robin Trower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Molenda|first1=Mike|last2=Pau|first2=Les|title=The Guitar Player Book: 40 Years of Interviews, Gear, and Lessons from the World's Most Celebrated Guitar Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zu3owmYkpZ0C|year=2007|publisher=Hal Leonard|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1970s a variety of solid-state effects pedals including [[flanger]]s, [[chorus pedal]]s, [[ring modulator]]s and [[phase shifter]]s were available.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, D (2004).

While digitized [[Effects unit#Rackmounts|rack units]] became the standard for popular artists in the 1980s, older effects pedals were preferred by [[punk rock|punk]] and [[garage rock]] bands.  [[Seattle]] [[grunge rock]]ers [[Mudhoney]] celebrated these roots on their 1988 EP ''[[Superfuzz Bigmuff]]'', named for two of the band's favorite guitar [[effects pedal]]s: the [[Univox Super-Fuzz]] and the [[Electro-Harmonix]] [[Big Muff]], which helped to provide the band's signature "dirty" sound.  When fellow grungers [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] made it big in 1991', interest in vintage pedals grew among their fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Atria|first=Travis|title=Stephen Malkmus – Talks Real Emotional Trash|url=http://www.glidemagazine.com/articles/53170/stephen-malkmus-talks-real-emotional-trash.html|periodical=Glide Magazine|date=6 March 2008|accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''water tunnel''' is an experimental facility used for testing the [[hydrodynamic]] behavior of submerged bodies in flowing water.  It is very similar to a recirculating [[wind tunnel]] but with water as the working fluid, and related phenomena are investigated, such as measuring the forces on scale models of [[submarines]] or lift and drag on [[hydrofoil]]s. Water tunnels are sometimes used in place of wind tunnels to perform measurements because techniques like [[particle image velocimetry]] (PIV) are easier to implement in water. For many cases as long as the [[Reynolds number]] is equivalent, the results are valid, whether a submerged water vehicle model is tested in air or an aerial vehicle is tested in water. For low Reynolds number flows, tunnels can be made to run oil instead of water. The advantage is that the increased [[kinematic viscosity]] will allow the flow to be a faster speed (and thus easier to maintain stably) for a lower Reynolds number.

Whereas in [[wind tunnel]]s the driving force is usually sophisticated multiblade [[propellers]] with adjustable [[blade pitch]], in water and oil tunnels the fluid is circulated with pumps, effectively using a net [[pressure head]] difference to move the fluid rather than imparting [[momentum]] on it directly. Thus the return section of water and oil tunnels does not need any flow management; typically it is just a pipe sized for the pump and desired flow speeds. The upstream section of a water tunnels generally consists of a pipe (outlet from the pump) with several holes along its side and with the end open followed by a series of coarse and fine screens to even the flow before the contraction into the test section. Wind tunnels may also have screens before the contraction, but in water tunnels they may be as fine as the screen used in window openings and screen doors.

Additionally, many water tunnels are sealed and can reduce or increase the internal static [[pressure]], to perform [[cavitation]] studies.  These are referred to as '''cavitation tunnels'''.

==Methods==
Because it is a high-speed phenomenon, a special procedure is needed to visualize cavitation. The propeller, attached to a [[dynamometer]], is placed in the inflow, and its thrust and torque is measured at different ratios of propeller speed (number of revolutions) to inflow velocity. A [[stroboscope]] synchronized with the propeller speed "freezes" the cavitation bubble. By this, one can observe if the propeller would be damaged by cavitation. To ensure [[Similitude (model)|similarity]] to the full-scale propeller, the pressure is lowered, and the gas content of the water is controlled.

Often, a tunnel will be co-located with other experimental facilities such as a [[wave flume]] at a [[Ship model basin]].
