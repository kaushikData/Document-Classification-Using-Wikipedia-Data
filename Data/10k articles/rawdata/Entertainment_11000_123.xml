'''''9''''' is a 2005 [[computer animated]] [[short film]] created by [[Shane Acker]] as a student project at the [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA Animation Workshop]]. [[Tim Burton]] saw the film and was so impressed by its artistic vision that he went on to produce a feature-length adaptation also titled ''[[9 (2009 animated film)|9]]'', directed by Acker and distributed by [[Focus Features]]. The film was presented at the [[Indianapolis International Film Festival]]. It was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|best animated short film]], but lost to ''[[The Moon and the Son: An Imagined Conversation]]'', although it did win a [[Student Academy Award]] for Best Animation.

==Plot==
9 is a [[sentience|sentient]] [[rag doll]] who appears to be the last of his kind, living in the ruins of a decaying, [[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] Earth. He is first seen making simple constructs out of refuse – a swinging [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] of [[scrap metal]], an upright book with string tied around it, and a dummy rag doll full of [[tar]], though the purpose behind these things is unclear at first. Hunting 9 relentlessly is the Cat Beast, a mechanical monster wearing a cat's skull for a head. It appears to be guided by a small glowing [[amulet|talisman]] which it holds in its claws. Sitting quietly, 9 stares into the mirrored surface of his own strange talisman and has a flashback.

In the flashback, 9 searches the ruins with his mentor, 5, a one-eyed rag doll. They gather useful bits and pieces and store them in the cloth linings of their own skin. With 9's help, 5 is able to salvage a light bulb and operate it using pieces of wire and a watch battery. 5 gives the functional bulb to 9 for safe-keeping.

Almost immediately after, 5 draws the mirrored talisman from inside his chest. It glows green, warning of danger. 5 gives the talisman to 9 then pushes him into cover. Extending a homemade folding spear, 5 steps out to confront the threat. But the Cat Beast circles behind him and snatches him up with a metal pincer, shearing off his right arm. Though he struggles, 5 can not break free, and the Cat Beast sucks 5's soul out through his mouth using its talisman, leaving 5 lifeless. Horrified, 9 escapes in panic, almost giving away his location to the Cat Beast by scraping the light bulb against a rock.

9 is woken from the memory by the warning green glow of the mirrored talisman. Taking the light bulb, which he has attached to the end of a staff, 9 flees into a ruined house. The Cat Beast follows and we see that it has not just taken the other rag dolls' souls: it also wears their numbered skins like a garment. The number 5 shows prominently on its back.

The Beast pounces on what it thinks is 9, but which turns out to be a marionette – the dummy created by 9 at the beginning of the film. The Beast's claws stick in the tar and 9 is able to hop onto its back and steal the Beast's talisman. 9 leads the Beast on a panicked chase through the house and finally runs out onto the end of a broken plank, which extends over a several-story drop. Thinking it has 9 cornered, the Beast walks out onto the plank. But it has fallen into 9's trap.

Nearby is the metal armature, and the upright book. 9 leaps off the plank onto the armature, which swings him around to the book. He kicks it and it falls into the pit. The string, tied at one end to the book, has its other end tied to the plank. The weight of the falling book drags the plank into the pit, and the Beast with it. The Beast crashes through a hole in the cellar floor and is presumably impaled by the sharp end of the falling plank. This all reveals that all the things that 9 has built was a cleverly-made trap for the Beast.

Now free from fear, 9 salvages the skins of the other rag dolls and prepares them to be ceremonially burned. As he looks sadly at the skin of 5, the two talismans begin to glow. 9 realizes that they are two halves of a whole and puts them together. A beam of green light erupts from the united talisman, and the [[spirit]]s of the eight slain rag dolls 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 emerge, returning to their rag doll skins to be at peace. Before disappearing, 5's soul turns to 9 and nods in approval.

In the morning, when the ashes have cooled, 9 – bearing the light bulb staff, a symbol of the persistent light of knowledge and learning – walks off into the wasteland, leaving the empty talisman behind in the sand.

==Production==
The short film took four and a half years, on and off, to create. Originally, Acker wanted to make it as [[stop motion]], but then went for CGI when realizing it would have turned out too expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael |last=Avila |date={{Date|2009-09-08|mdy}} |title=Film '9' May Set New Animation Standard |url=http://www.newsarama.com/film/090908-9-director.html |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |accessdate={{Date|2010-01-15|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]] 1.5&amp;ndash;5.5 for 3D modeling, [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] for the textures, [[Adobe After Effects|After Effects]] for [[compositing]], and [[Adobe Premiere|Premiere]] for editing. There are homages to Acker's influences like [[Brothers Quay]] and [[Pixar]] placed throughout. Most of it was [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendered]] at 720x540 [[pixel]]s on a three-computer dual-processor [[render farm]]. For distribution at [[film festival]]s like [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]], [[Rhythm and Hues Studios]] offered to print the short film to [[35mm]] using their film printer and image resizing techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Steven |last=Churchill |url=http://www.animationtrip.com/item.php?id=742 |title=Shane Acker discusses his award winning film '9' |publisher=AnimationTrip.com |accessdate={{Date|2010-01-15|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The credits show that beyond Acker, there were five other animators and three other [[lighting|lighters]] that worked on the film. The music was provided by Eric Olsen and his band the Earganic.

The edited videos were published on [[Andrew Breitbart]]'s website [[BigGovernment.com]] from September through November 2009. They generated extensive, negative publicity for ACORN, and led to the U.S. [[Census Bureau]] and the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] ending their contracts with ACORN, the U.S. Congress suspending its funding,&lt;ref name="FOX"/&gt; and ACORN losing most of its private funding.

==Hannah Giles and James O'Keefe==
Hannah Giles (born March 15, 1989) is an American conservative activist. Her father is a conservative Christian pastor, Doug Giles. She came to national attention with James O'Keefe in the United States in September 2009 as a featured player in videos they had filmed secretly in encounters at offices of the [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now]] (ACORN). At the time, Giles was studying journalism at [[Florida International University]]. Following the videos' release and extensive media coverage, she dropped out of college to "pursue demands to keep up with public appearances and job offers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/click/stories/0911/citizen_journalists_path_to_celebrity_paved_with_ups_downs_.html [[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]] "Citizen Journalists' Path to Celebrity Paved With Ups, Downs" by Erika Lovely, 11-30-2009; retrieved 12-02-2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Giles and O'Keefe spent $1,300 to accomplish what ''Washington Post'' reporters called a "Mission to Fell ACORN".&lt;ref name="WAPost"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/17/AR2009091704805_2.html?sid=ST2011020203536|first1= Darryl |last1=Fears|last2=Leonnig|first2=Carol D.|authorlink2=Carol D.

===September 2009===
Edited videos from the visits to ACORN offices in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Brooklyn, San Bernardino, and San Diego were released between September 10 and September 17, 2009, and were used to launch [[Andrew Breitbart]]'s [[BigGovernment.com]] website.&lt;ref name="nyt20090926"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoyt|first=Clark|title=Tuning In Too Late|work=The New York Times|date=2009-09-26|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/opinion/27pubed.html|accessdate=2009-09-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110513203234/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/opinion/27pubed.html| archivedate=May 13, 2011&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediaite.com/online/could-andrew-breitbart-become-the-rights-arianna-huffington "Why Big Government Could Make Andrew Breitbart the Right's Huffington"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/ombudsman/2009/09/the_acorn_videos_did_npr_ignor.html "The ACORN Videos: Did NPR Ignore Them?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the videos, O'Keefe included segments in which he wore a fur coat, top hat, sunglasses, and wielded a cane, giving viewers, including the media, the impression that he had dressed that way when he visited the ACORN offices and spoke to its workers.&lt;ref name="TheLens"/&gt; As part of the deception and distortion of the released videos, O'Keefe added that portion as a lead-in, but he was dressed professionally during his ACORN visits. He never revealed himself on camera in the visits to the ACORN offices.&lt;ref name="TheLens"/&gt;

In the Baltimore office, the released video lets viewers hear O'Keefe saying that he and Giles were bringing up thirteen girls from [[El Salvador]] "like 15" years of age to live in their house and work as prostitutes "just to get them on their feet so they can do this type of thing."&lt;ref&gt;Baltimore ACORN Transcript, pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; Giles remarks, "they are kind of dependent."&lt;ref&gt;Baltimore ACORN Transcript, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Baltimore ACORN staffer pointed out their plans were illegal, after O'Keefe says, "we are going to be putting a roof over [their] head", the ACORN employee states, "well then you know what you can always claim them as dependents."&lt;ref&gt;Baltimore ACORN Transcript, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the employee says, "you are gonna use three of them they are gonna be under 16 so you is eligible to get child tax credit and additional child tax credit."&lt;ref&gt;Baltimore ACORN Transcript, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; When O'Keefe asks, "what if they are going to be making money because they are performing tricks too?" the employee replies, "but if they making money and they are underage, then you shouldn't be letting anybody know anyway."&lt;ref&gt;Baltimore ACORN Transcript, pp. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt; The Baltimore employees were fired by ACORN after the video was released.&lt;ref name=nytimesvideo&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2009/09/10/us/AP-US-ACORN-Hidden-Camera.html|title=ACORN Fires 2 After Hidden-Camera Footage Aired|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=2009-09-10|accessdate=2009-09-10}} {{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bmoresunvideo&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bal-md.ci.acorn11sep11,0,7738162.story|title=Video prompts ACORN firings|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|author=Justin Fenton|date=2009-09-11|accessdate=2009-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Washington, D.C., office, Giles and O'Keefe ask about how to account for Giles' anticipated prostitution income on tax forms. Giles asks, "is there a way I can make up two years of tax returns?" The ACORN employee replies, "no you can't make it up", but tells Giles that she could form a business and state that she provides a service.&lt;ref&gt;Washington DC ACORN Transcript, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The employee says, "you can have a business. She's not going to put down that she's doing prostitution", and "you don't have to sit back and tell people what it is you do."&lt;ref&gt;Washington DC ACORN Transcript, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DCACORN"/&gt; Giles later tells an ACORN employee that she will be giving the money earned from prostitution to O'Keefe. The employee says, "when the police ask you – you don't know where it's coming from."&lt;ref name="DCACORN"&gt;[http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local-beat/Pimp-Sting-Taints-ACORN-Obama-Supporters-59069402.html "'Pimp Sting' Taints ACORN, Obama Supporters"], September 11, 2010, [[NBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Washington DC ACORN Transcript, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Brooklyn office, Giles and O'Keefe tell a loan counselor they want to buy a house, and that an abusive pimp is "aggressively" pursuing Giles. She "wanted to leave because it is scary being subjected to a huge man who has control over your life."&lt;ref&gt;Brooklyn ACORN Transcript, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The ACORN counselor advises her "you get a tin if [he] is going to come beat you... you get a tin and bury it down in there and you put the money right in and you put grass over it and you don't tell a single soul."&lt;ref&gt;Brooklyn ACORN Transcript, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; When discussing getting a house and Giles' earnings, O'Keefe says that Giles is very honest and an ACORN counselor replies, "honest is not going to get you the house that is why you probably been denied cause you probably going in saying."&lt;ref&gt;Brooklyn ACORN Transcript, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYPACORN"&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/item_Js4YPEcsCcxLZhAEehLhmL/1 "'Pimp &amp; hooker' catch B'klyn staff"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421001504/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/item_Js4YPEcsCcxLZhAEehLhmL/1 |date=2010-04-21 }} ''[[New York Post]]''; September 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Another stated to Giles, "you can't say what you do for a living."&lt;ref name="NYPACORN"/&gt; For tax and banking purposes, and to establish a legitimate income and credit history, Giles was told she needed to start saying she was a "freelancer".&lt;ref name="NYPACORN"/&gt; The ACORN employee also suggested that Giles open two accounts at separate banks, depositing no more than $500 each a week to ensure few eyebrows are raised.&lt;ref name="NYPACORN"/&gt;

In the San Bernardino office, ACORN employee Tresa Kaelke told O'Keefe and Giles they could classify the underage brothel as a "group home" to avoid detection; she suggested the pair "invest in a line of vitamins" to disguise the location's true purpose.&lt;ref name="FoxKaelke"&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/us/2009/09/16/fourth-videotape-reveals-acorn-advising-pimp-prostitute-california/ Fourth Videotape Reveals ACORN Advising 'Pimp', 'Prostitute' in California], September 16, 2010, [[Fox News]]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Kaelke stated she believed the activists were joking and made a variety of absurd or joking statements to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[ABC News]]|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/09/blowback-in-the-acorn-wars.html|title=Blowback in the ACORN Wars|date=2009-09-16|accessdate=2009-09-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090918065611/http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/09/blowback-in-the-acorn-wars.html| archivedate= 18 September 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Politics Daily]]|url=http://www.politicsdaily.com/2009/09/16/police-acorn-employees-murder-confession-not-factual|title=Police: ACORN Employee's Murder Confession Not 'Factual'|date=2009-09-16|accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said they were "somewhat entertaining, but they weren't even good actors."&lt;ref&gt;FOX, September 16, 2009, [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,550562,00.html Fourth Videotape Reveals ACORN Advising 'Pimp', 'Prostitute' in California]&lt;/ref&gt; Office supervisor Christina Spach said Kaelke "pretended to cooperate with O'Keefe and Giles because she feared for her safety."

==ACORN response==
In response to release of the first videos, ACORN CEO [[Bertha Lewis (activist)|Bertha Lewis]] said on Fox News on September 20, 2009, "[i]n a way, this was good for us, so what it did was show up to us what weaknesses we have, and we have moved swiftly ... in order to correct that."

===October 2009===
On October 21, O'Keefe and Giles released video footage of their visit to the Philadelphia office of ACORN at a [[National Press Club (United States)|National Press Club]] conference. They claimed it was to show they had received help there, after an ACORN spokesman had said that the pair had been asked to leave the Philadelphia office.&lt;ref name="PressClub"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/21/AR2009102103284_pf.html Susan Kinzie, "Duo release another video of their meeting with ACORN worker; latest footage has audio of two conservatives but not of the staff member"], ''The Washington Post,'' 22 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Washington Post'' "obtained a July 24 police report that showed police were called when O'Keefe and Giles attempted their sting at ACORN's Philadelphia offices—and that the couple were escorted out of those offices." Susan Kinzie of ''The Washington Post'' noted that "the heavily edited footage includes audio of the two conservatives but none of the ACORN Housing Corp. worker's responses to their questions."&lt;ref name="PressClub"/&gt; Junette Marcano, a board member of Philadelphia ACORN, said, "This is a targeted assault to disenfranchise our members because ... the right-wing agenda is to stop us from empowering people of low and moderate incomes. When you make the poor powerful, the powerful feel threatened."&lt;ref name="PressClub"/&gt;

[[Carol Leonnig]], a ''[[Washington Post]]'' staff writer who attended the press conference, said in an interview that day on [[Fox News]] that, in explaining why the audio portion did not include the worker's responses, O'Keefe said, "on the one hand, the pair are concerned about the legal ramifications."&lt;ref name="OntheRecord"&gt;Interview of [[Carol Leonnig]] by [[Greta Van Susteren]], ''On the Record with Greta Van Susteren'', October 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; O'Keefe claimed secondly "that the tape battery died."&lt;ref name="OntheRecord" /&gt; Commenting on the Philadelphia video, Leonnig said "when you go to this office, and you see this tape, I don't think he's got the goods to say that ACORN lied."&lt;ref name="OntheRecord" /&gt; Both Giles and O'Keefe declined to answer questions after the release of the October video.&lt;ref name="PressClub" /&gt;

On March 19, 2010, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that ACORN was on the verge of filing for bankruptcy; 15 of the group's 30 state chapters had disbanded over the past six months, and other chapters (including the largest, in New York and California) had renamed themselves and severed all ties to the national organization.&lt;ref name=bankruptcy&gt;{{cite news|first=Ian|last=Urbina|date=March 19, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/20/us/politics/20acorn.html|title=Acorn on Brink of Bankruptcy, Officials Say|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=2010-03-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100323024816/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/20/us/politics/20acorn.html| archivedate= 23 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two unnamed ACORN officials told the ''Times'' that the following weekend, a teleconference was planned to discuss a bankruptcy filing; "private donations from foundations to Acorn [had] all but evaporated." The federal government had ended contracts with the group related to organizing counts in urban areas for the Census and work for the IRS.&lt;ref name=bankruptcy/&gt; "[L]ong before the activist videos delivered what may become the final blow, the organization was dogged for years by financial problems and accusations of fraud."&lt;ref name=bankruptcy/&gt; Former co-chairwoman of ACORN's Maryland chapter Sonja Merchant-Jones said: "That 20-minute video ruined 40 years of good work. But if the organization had confronted its own internal problems, it might not have been taken down so easily."&lt;ref name=bankruptcy/&gt;

On March 22, 2010, National ACORN spokesman Kevin Whelan says the organization's board decided to close remaining state affiliates and field offices by April 1 because of falling revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ben|last=Smith|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0310/Acorn_folds.html?showall|title=ACORN Folds|publisher=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]|date=March 22, 2010|accessdate=2010-03-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100325012201/http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0310/Acorn_folds.html?showall| archivedate= 25 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 20, the ACORN CEO [[Bertha Lewis (activist)|Bertha Lewis]] reported that ACORN was "still alive.

It had forced the group to spend money to respond to "one investigation after another."&lt;ref name="AP 4-20"/&gt;

==Investigations of ACORN and the videos==

===Independent external investigation by Proskauer Rose===
On September 16, 2009, ACORN suspended advising new clients and initiated an independent review process, headed by [[Scott Harshbarger]], an attorney from the [[Proskauer Rose]] firm and a former Massachusetts Attorney General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Embattled ACORN orders independent investigation |author=Sharon Theimer |agency=[[Associated Press]] |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jxhq8CPN8LdLntDEDtE5NrEBQ2IgD9AOK3DO0 |accessdate=2009-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924084738/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jxhq8CPN8LdLntDEDtE5NrEBQ2IgD9AOK3DO0 |archivedate=September 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rutenberg"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/us/politics/23brfs-ACORNHIRESFO_BRF.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Acorn Hires Former State Law Enforcer|first=Jim|last=Rutenberg|date=2009-09-23|accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 16, [[Bertha Lewis (activist)|Bertha Lewis]], ACORN's [[chief executive officer|CEO]], froze admission to all of ACORN's service programs and instituted a review committee to implement organizational reforms.&lt;ref name=nbcwashington&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/politics/ACORN-59498812.html|title=ACORN Suspends Key Services Amid Probe|date=September 16, 2009|work=[[WRC-TV]]|publisher=nbcwashington.com|accessdate=September 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reforms&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,550941,00.html|title=ACORN Announces Reforms After 'Pimp', 'Prostitute' Videos|date=September 16, 2009|work=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]]|publisher=foxnews.com|accessdate=September 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The independent external investigation found that while some of the counsel given by employees and volunteers was "unprofessional and inappropriate", the videos that had been released appeared to have been edited, "in some cases substantially", and ACORN employees had taken no illegal actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proskauer.com/files/uploads/report2.pdf An Independent Governance Assessment of ACORN] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908055244/http://www.proskauer.com/files/uploads/report2.pdf |date=2010-09-08 }}; Proskauer; December 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Report by the Congressional Research Service===
On December 22, 2009, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) released a report on ACORN activities, commissioned by the House Judiciary Committee. It stated that ACORN has not been found to violate any federal regulations in the past five years. The report's other findings included that there were no instances of voter fraud by individuals who were allegedly registered to vote improperly by ACORN or its employees, and no instances where ACORN violated terms of federal funding in the last 5 years. The CRS found that O'Keefe and Giles may have violated Maryland and California laws banning the recording of face-to-face conversations without consent of both parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1209/30919.html CRS report: ACORN didn't break law] ''Politico''; December 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://judiciary.house.gov/news/091222.html Conyers Releases CRS Report on ACORN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103100442/http://judiciary.house.gov/news/091222.html |date=2010-11-03 }}, House Judiciary Committee; December 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigation by New York attorney general===
The New York [[Attorney General]], [[Andrew Cuomo]], began an investigation on September 15, 2009, to ensure that state grants given to ACORN were properly spent.&lt;ref name="NEW YORK POST"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[New York Post]]

Hynes Makes Statement Regarding Investigation Into ACORN], Kings County District Attorney; March 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigation by California attorney general===
On September 25, 2009, in response to Governor Schwarzenegger's request to investigate the incidents, the [[California Attorney General]]'s office opened an investigation "into the controversy surrounding videos that purportedly show members of community organizing group ACORN giving advice on how to open a brothel."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.sacbee.com/capitolalertlatest/2009/10/ag-opens-probe.html AG opens probe into ACORN video flap] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125011708/http://blogs.sacbee.com/capitolalertlatest/2009/10/ag-opens-probe.html |date=2010-11-25 }}; ''Sacramento Bee''; October 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1, 2010, Attorney General [[Jerry Brown]] announced the office's findings, based on its review of new unedited videotapes recorded in the California offices of ACORN, as well as other evidence.&lt;ref name="CA AG Release" /&gt; The AG had granted O'Keefe and Giles immunity from prosecution in exchange for the raw videotapes. The report noted that the terms of the exchange did not exempt O'Keefe or Giles from being sued separately by the ACORN members filmed in the videos.&lt;ref name="CA AG Report" /&gt; Citing the 1967 Invasion of Privacy Act, Attorney General Office's report stated, "an application of these principles to the facts presented here strongly suggests that O'Keefe and Giles violated state privacy laws and provides fair warning to them and others that this type of activity can be prosecuted in California."&lt;ref name="CA AG Report" /&gt;

The Attorney General Office criticized O'Keefe for not acting as a journalist trying to objectively report a story from the facts, noting instead that O'Keefe stated he "was out to make a point and to damage ACORN."&lt;ref name="CA AG Report" /&gt; The report said:&lt;blockquote&gt;The video releases were heavily edited to feature only the worst or most inappropriate statements of the various ACORN employees and to omit some of the most salient statements by O'Keefe and Giles. Each of the ACORN employees recorded in California was a low level employee whose job was to help the needy individuals who walked in the door seeking assistance. Giles and O'Keefe lied to engender compassion, but then edited their statements from the released videos.&lt;ref name="CA AG Report" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;For instance, one much-publicized recording had shown O'Keefe and Giles at the San Diego office. They show a worker purportedly seeking information from a contact in Mexico to help them smuggle underage girls from Mexico into the United States to work as prostitutes. The video did not show that the worker's "contact" in Mexico was a police official. The employee collected as much specific information from Giles and O'Keefe as possible during their visit. The worker then contacted Mexican police to warn them of the plot.&lt;ref name="Maddow"&gt;{{cite news|last=Maddow|first=Rachel|title=Raw ACORN tapes tell a very different story|work=MSNBC.com|date=2010-04-06|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/36204129#36204129|accessdate=2010-04-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100410094636/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/36204129| archivedate= 10 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AG Office's report stated, "ACORN was not the criminal enterprise described by O'Keefe in his 'Chaos for Glory' statement – it did not receive billions in federal funds and did not control elections. ACORN is, however, disorganized and its operations were far from transparent, leaving it vulnerable to allegations of illegal activity and misuse of funds."&lt;ref name="CA AG Report" /&gt; The report also noted that despite O'Keefe's appearing in the released videos in "stereotypical 1970s pimp garb", in his actual taped sessions with ACORN workers, he was dressed in a shirt and tie, presented himself as a law student, and said he planned to use the prostitution proceeds to run for Congress, and never claimed he was a pimp.&lt;ref name="CA AG Report" /&gt;

The report of the Attorney General Office concluded, "Even if O'Keefe and Giles had truly intended to break the law, there is no evidence that any of the ACORN employees had the intent to aid and abet such criminal conduct or agreed to join in that illegal conduct." While faulting a few of the recorded ACORN members for "terrible judgment and highly inappropriate behavior",&lt;ref name="CA AG Report" /&gt; the investigation report also concluded that "ACORN could determine that the conduct of its employees in California was inappropriate, but that is an employment matter, which does not rise to the level of a law enforcement or governmental concern". The report determined that the employees did not commit prosecutable crimes in California. Regarding this contrast between the publicity related to the videos and what actually transpired, Attorney General Brown stated, "The evidence illustrates that things are not always as partisan zealots portray them through highly selective editing of reality. Sometimes a fuller truth is found on the cutting room floor."&lt;ref name="CA AG Release" /&gt;

===Investigation by the U.S. Government Accountability Office===
On June 14, 2010, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) released its findings on ACORN, by then disbanded. It said that there was no evidence that the group, or any of its related organizations, mishandled any of the $40 million in federal money that they had received in recent years.&lt;ref name="cnn.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-atlas/acorn-vindicated-of-wrong_b_612265.html?page=3&amp;show_comment_id=50563828 "ACORN Vindicated of Wrongdoing by the Congressional Watchdog Office,”] ''The Huffington Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Alexandra Fenwick of the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' on September 18, 2009, journalist Mark Bowden of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' said about the case:&lt;blockquote&gt;The young woman and filmmaker who visited those ACORN offices were political activists, and they put together what is, in essence, a very effective political protest against an organization they would like to damage. And they've done a very effective job of doing that. But I think they're clearly not journalists.&lt;ref name="Fenwick"&gt;[http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/acorns_family_tree.php?page=1 Alexandra Fenwick, "ACORN's Family Tree: Was the Baltimore video journalism? Does it matter?"], ''Columbia Journalism Review'', 18 September 2009, accessed 29 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The next spring, on March 20, 2010, [[Clark Hoyt]], [[ombudsman|public editor]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote an op-ed column conceding some errors in the paper's reporting. ACORN and its supporters had complained "that ''The Times'' got the story wrong and, by failing to correct it, has played into the hands of a campaign that has pushed the group near extinction." Hoyt acknowledged that it was by then known that it was not likely that O'Keefe went into the ACORN offices dressed as a pimp, as at the beginning and end of most of the videos. O'Keefe had presented himself "as a clean-cut young man, sometimes a college student, trying to rescue his girlfriend and under-age girls from an abusive pimp."&lt;ref name="Hoyt"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Acorn Sting Revisited|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/opinion/21pubed.html|date=2010-03-20|work=The New York Times|first=Clark|last=Hoyt}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, Hoyt wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;ACORN's supporters appear to hope that the whole story will fall apart over the issue of what O'Keefe wore: if that was wrong, everything else must be wrong. The record does not support them. If O'Keefe did not dress as a pimp, he clearly presented himself as one: a fellow trying to set up a woman — sometimes along with under-age girls — in a house where they would work as prostitutes.&lt;ref name="Hoyt" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;His article appeared before the release on April 1, 2010, of the California AG Report, which found that O'Keefe's videos had all been heavily edited to misrepresent the ACORN workers and present them in the worst possible light. The pair had set up the workers rather than doing investigative journalism.&lt;ref name="CA AG Release" /&gt; Investigations by the California AG, Brooklyn U.S. Attorney and the U.S. GAO found that ACORN workers had not participated in criminal activities.

==Criticisms of the undercover videos==
In September 2009, before the investigations revealed the selective and heavy editing of the videos, Alexandra Fenwick of the ''Columbia Journalism Review'' described the video ensemble as a politically motivated piece that lacked context and did not present accurate information. She characterized the work as raw information instead of journalism. She said some elements of the ACORN videos seemed "shadows of journalism's muckraking past" and were commendable.&lt;ref name="CJR1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fenwick|first=Alexandra|title=ACORN's Family Tree: Was the Baltimore video journalism?|work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|date=2009-09-18|url=http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/acorns_family_tree.php?page=1|accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The videos were criticized by MSNBC's [[Norah O'Donnell]], who suggested the use of hidden cameras was a form of entrapment.

''[[Washington Post]]'' staff writers [[Darryl Fears]] and [[Carol D. Leonnig]] wrote: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Giles and O'Keefe have been criticized for accuracy problems. Their videos include the oft-repeated conservative claim that ACORN is expected to get up to $8.5 billion in government funds. But that's a bold exaggeration, as it includes $3 billion in stimulus funds set aside for revitalization efforts nationwide, and $5.5 billion in federal community development grants.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The more than $8 billion number was based on the false assumption that ACORN would apply for and win every project and grant in the country, and in fact ACORN did not apply for any of the stimulus funds.&lt;ref name="FearsLeonnig"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fears|first=Darryl|title=The $1,300 Mission to Fell ACORN: Duo in Sting Video Say Their Effort Was Independent|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2009-09-18|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/17/AR2009091704805.html?hpid=topnews&amp;sid=ST2009091704852|accessdate=2009-09-18|last2=Leonnig|first2=Carol D.|authorlink2=Carol D. Leonnig}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonnig also observed:&lt;blockquote&gt;the videos, in some cases, left out what I would call some [[Exculpatory evidence|exculpatory]] material ... for example, in one, a San Berna[r]dino employee at ACORN explains that there is no way ACORN would support what the couple were proposing, and she asks if they are putting her on, [[Candid Camera|candid-camera]] style.&lt;ref name="Leonnig1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Leonnig|first=Carol D.|authorlink=Carol D. Leonnig|title=Latest Developments in ACORN Story|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2009-09-23|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2009/09/23/DI2009092302081.html|accessdate=2009-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;During a September 14 television appearance on FOX, O'Keefe appeared dressed in a fur coat, sunglasses, and holding a cane. The host announced: "[O'Keefe] is dressed exactly in the same outfit that he wore to these ACORN offices up and down the eastern seaboard." He asked, "[I]s that what you think a pimp looks like?" O'Keefe answered yes. Within weeks, political journalist Mike Stark revealed that O'Keefe did not wear such clothing to the ACORN offices, but rather he wore subdued clothing and a tie, and in one instance posed as a candidate for Congress.&lt;ref name="HuffPOStark"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stark|first=Mike|title=All You Need to Know About the ACORN Scandal and Who Is Behind It|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=2009-10-22|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-stark/all-you-need-to-know-abou_b_330643.html|accessdate=2009-10-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091026170941/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-stark/all-you-need-to-know-abou_b_330643.html| archivedate= 26 October 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stark said, "If they really wanted the truth out there, why do they need to edit these tapes in the first place? Why aren't the unedited videos already in the public domain?"&lt;ref name="HuffPOStark" /&gt;

The Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes cleared ACORN employees in the local office of criminal wrongdoing on March 1, 2010, after a five-month investigation. The ''[[New York Daily News|Daily News]]'' quoted a law enforcement source saying that "They edited the tape to meet their agenda".&lt;ref name="NEW YORK DAILY" /&gt; The ACORN lawyer Arthur Schwartz commented that ACORN was "gratified that the DA has concluded something we knew all along." He said that O'Keefe and Giles had "used subterfuge to convince Congress and the media to vilify an organization that didn't deserve it."&lt;ref name="ABAJournal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/ny_prosecutor_clears_acorn_workers_in_pimp_and_hooker_incident/?from=widget|title=NY Prosecutor Clears ACORN Workers in Pimp and Hooker Incident|last=McDonough|first=Molly|date=2010-03-02|work=[[ABA Journal]]|accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The group's first show was called ''Om mens og menn'' (About Menstruation and Men).&lt;ref name="VG"/&gt; The show premiered at Trindheim's Veita Scene concert venue in May 1998. It was a success, and it played for an additional two months in Trondheim that fall. In 1999, the group released the album ''.no'' on the record label Norske Gram.&lt;ref name="VG"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Myhr|first1=Kjell-Ivar|title=Pop med pupp|url=https://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/pop-med-pupp/65589263|accessdate=January 2, 2018|work=Dagbladet|date=March 26, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this, the trio was the trio was expanded with three musicians: [[Sola Jonsen]] (from [[DumDum Boys]]), [[Truls Waagø]] (from the [[Trondheim Symphony Orchestra]]), and Jostein Ansnes (from [[Dadafon]]).&lt;ref name="Adamsepler"/&gt;

In March 2000, Adamseplene premiered the show ''Full Pupp'' (Full Ti(l)t), which was also a success in the [[Trondheim og omland|Trondheim area]]. In 2001 the show was made into a six-episode television series that was broadcast on [[NRK]] that fall: ''Adamseplene: Full pupp''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adamseplene: Full pupp|url=https://tv.nrk.no/program/pdst78001101/adamseplene-full-pupp|publisher=NRK|accessdate=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group also appeared on NRK radio.

In the fall of 2006, the group performed the show ''Alle tiders julebord'' (The Christmas Table of All Time) at the [[Trøndelag Teater|Trøndelag Theater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alle tiders julebord.

On December 29, 2008, during the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]], Israeli aircraft repeatedly bombed the al-Aqsa television station headquarters in [[Gaza City]]. The building was completely destroyed,&lt;ref name=cnn_bombing&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/12/27/gaza.israel.strikes/index.html| accessdate=2008-12-28 |title=Hundreds dead, injured in Gaza as Israeli airstrikes continue | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=2008-12-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081230143944/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/12/27/gaza.israel.strikes/index.html| archivedate= 30 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the station continued to broadcast from a mobile TV unit{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

On July 29, 2014, during the [[2014 Israel-Gaza conflict]], an Israeli air strike hit a media building housing al-Aqsa TV and al-Aqsa Radio channel in the centre of Gaza City early on in the morning.

==Criticism==
In May 2013, Al-Aqsa TV became the focus of media scrutiny after a decision by the [[Newseum]] to honor two Al-Aqsa TV members as part of its ongoing memorial to journalists who lost their lives in the line of duty in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spotlight On Al Aqsa Television|url=http://blog.adl.org/international/spotlight-on-al-aqsa-television|publisher=Anti-Defemation League|accessdate=13 May 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816044531/http://blog.adl.org/international/spotlight-on-al-aqsa-television|archivedate=16 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.S. government classifies Al-Aqsa TV as being controlled by Hamas, a "Specially Designated Global Terrorist," and states that it "will not distinguish between a business financed and controlled by a terrorist group, such as Al-Aqsa Television, and the terrorist group itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/tg594.aspx|title=Treasury Designates Gaza-Based Business, Television Station for Hamas Ties|website=www.treasury.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006091936/http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/tg594.aspx|archivedate=2014-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to the American Jewish organisation, the Anti-Defamation League, Al-Aqsa TV promotes terrorist activity and incites hatred of Jews and Israelis&lt;ref name=adl_al_aqsa_tv/&gt; and much of its programming glorifying violence is geared towards children.&lt;ref name=adl_al_aqsa_tv/&gt;

In regards to Al-Aqsa's television programme ''[[Tomorrow's Pioneers]]'',&lt;ref name=gulfnews_tomorrows&gt;[http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/07/05/13/10124830.html Al Aqsa TV defies Hamas government] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207060357/http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/07/05/13/10124830.html |date=2008-12-07 }}, [[Reuters]], May 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  following complaints by Israeli watchdog groups that triggered international scrutiny, [[Information Minister of the Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Information Minister]] [[Mustafa Barghouti]] said he had asked Al-Aqsa TV to stop the broadcasts so the content could be reviewed. Despite Barghouti's call, ''Tomorrow's Pioneers'' went on the air as usual.&lt;ref name=gulfnews_tomorrows/&gt; In later episodes the co-host, a Mickey Mouse-like character named Farfour was killed by an Israeli interrogator, and was replaced by a bee named Naoul, who also died and was replaced by a rabbit character named Assoud.  Assoud, in turn, was martyred and replaced by Nassur the bear.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

In May 2008, Bassem Naeem, the [[Ministry of Health (Palestinian)|minister of health]] in the [[Hamas Government in Gaza|Hamas government in Gaza]], responded to allegations of [[antisemitism]] in Al-Aqsa TV programmes.&lt;ref name="guardian_naeem"/&gt; In his letter to ''[[The Guardian]]'', Naeem stated that the Al-Aqsa Channel is an independent media institution that often does not express the views of the Hamas government or the Hamas movement.&lt;ref name="guardian_naeem"&gt;{{cite news | first= Bassem | last= Naeem | title= Hamas condemns the Holocaust | date= 2008-05-15 | publisher= [[The Guardian]] | url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/12/hamascondemnstheholocaust/ | location= London | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161201173227/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/12/hamascondemnstheholocaust | archivedate= 2016-12-01 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, ''Guardian'' columnist [[Alan Johnson (political theorist)|Alan Johnson]] wrote that Al-Aqsa TV cannot be a media institution independent of Hamas,&lt;ref name="guardian_johnson"&gt;{{cite news | first=Alan | last=Johnson | title=Hamas and antisemitism | date=2008-05-15 | publisher=[[The Guardian]] | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/15/hamasandantisemitism | location=London | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170119091754/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/15/hamasandantisemitism | archivedate=2017-01-19 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; because it is headed by [[Fathi Hamad]], chairman of a Hamas-run company that also produces the Hamas radio station and its bi-weekly newspaper,&lt;ref name="guardian_johnson"/&gt; and because, since 2007, Hamas had blocked [[Palestinian National Authority]] broadcasts into [[Gaza City|Gaza]], which indicated that there is no independent media in Gaza.&lt;ref name="guardian_johnson"/&gt;

About reporting, Ibrahim Daher, a director at Al-Aqsa media operation, said they may not broadcast certain news. He said “If there was bad news during the war, or something went wrong, we just kept silent about it” and “now we mostly keep silent about the blockade, and that Hamas wasn't able to lift it during the war”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/hamas-radio-station-in-gaza-reports-on-the-sunny-side-of-islamist-movements-rule/2014/09/28/cf533106-c8b2-47ab-9c6f-1f1acc075ca3_story.html|title=Hamas radio station in Gaza reports on the sunny side of Islamist movement’s rule|accessdate=14 January 2015|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=29 September 2014|last=McCoy|first=Terrence|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224000209/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/hamas-radio-station-in-gaza-reports-on-the-sunny-side-of-islamist-movements-rule/2014/09/28/cf533106-c8b2-47ab-9c6f-1f1acc075ca3_story.html|archivedate=24 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1148">A '''balloon helicopter''' is a flying toy consisting of a latex [[toy balloon]] and a plastic [[propeller (aircraft)|propeller]], derived from the simple [[balloon rocket]]. The most important feature is the hollow propeller hub which directs air into a passage in each propeller blade. The air passages channel air to the blade tips such that air escapes in a fine jet tangentially. The air jets on the blade tips causes the entire toy to spin, the blades have a positive angle of attack so the blades experience a lifting force as they push air downwards. It can attain a height of approximately 12 meters (40&amp;nbsp;feet). Full-scale helicopters have been built around this [[tip jet]] configuration.

'''''Blueprint 3D''''' is a [[puzzle video game]] for [[iOS]] mobile devices, developed by German studio [[FDG Entertainment]] and published in November 2011.

The object of the game is to rotate a seemingly random jumble of dots and lines in three dimensions until they resolve into a [[blueprint]], a line drawing of an object. The player's [[Score (game)|score]] for each of the 240 [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] is calculated based on the time needed to solve the puzzle.

Critics reviewed ''Blueprint 3D'' favorably.

The '''Chronophone''' is an apparatus patented by [[Léon Gaumont]] in 1902 to synchronise the [[Cinématographe]] (Chrono-Bioscope) with a disc [[Phonograph]] (Cyclophone) using a "Conductor" or "Switchboard". This [[sound-on-disc]] display was used as an experiment from 1902 to 1910. In January 1911, the industrial exploitation started at the [[Olympia (Paris)|Olympia]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter by Léon Gaumont to Charles Delac, 10 december 1938&lt;/ref&gt; Chronophone would show [[Phonoscènes]] (an early forerunner of [[music videos]]) and [[Filmparlants]] ("Talking Films") almost every week from 1911 until 1917 at the [[Gaumont Palace]], "the Greatest Cinema Theatre in the World", previously known as the Paris Hippodrome.

In the [[United States]], the early rival of the Chronophone was the Cameraphone.

== Additional projects ==
Since 2013, Club Guy &amp; Roni takes in a new dance group every year under the name of Club Guy &amp; Roni's Poetic Disasters Club. This is a platform for young dancers who are about to graduate or who have just graduated. With this project, Club Guy &amp; Roni wants to create a platform for young dancers, so they can get acquainted with the dance world. 

In 2011 Club Guy &amp; Roni initiated the 'Duizend Dansjes Festival', to raise money for the UMCG Cancer Research Fund in Groningen. Eventually, €15.140,- were raised for the Fund.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umcg.nl/NL/UMCG/niet_medisch/UMCG_kanker_researchfonds/Inspirerende_acties/Pages/Obrengst_1000_Dansjes_Festival_15140_euro.aspx UMCG Kanker Researchfonds - Opbrengst 1000 Dansjes Festival 15.140 euro]&lt;/ref&gt;

Move it! is a participation project from 2011 in which Club Guy &amp; Roni and the Noord Nederlands Orkest teach a group of youths a choreography based on orchestral work. 

Every year Club Guy &amp; Roni organizes the Club Guy &amp; Roni Weekend Break Festival, a festival full of dance, theatre, live music, film and art. Club Guy &amp; Roni seek contact with young, local talents for the production of this festival. The first edition was in 2013 in the Grand Theatre in Groningen.

The '''Computerspielemuseum Berlin''' (Computer Games Museum Berlin) was founded in 1997. From 1997 to 2000, it had a permanent exhibition in [[Berlin]]. Afterwards, it became an online only museum. In 2011, it reopened its permanent exhibition in Berlin's neighborhood of [[Friedrichshain]] in the [[Karl-Marx-Allee]]. During the first month of its permanent exhibition, it had 12,000 visitors.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==General==
[[Image:Computerspielemuseum-pong.jpg|thumb|Exhibited consoles including arcade machines]]
The Computerspielemuseum opened the first permanent exhibition in the world for digital interactive entertainment culture in 1997 in Berlin. After that, it became responsible for 30 national and international exhibitions. Among these was the project "pong.mythos" sponsored by the [[German Federal Cultural Foundation]], Germany's most successful traveling exhibition in the history of computer games. In the last five years, over 470,000 visitors have seen this exhibition. The museum contains around 25,000 data storage devices with games, around 12,000 technical magazines, many historical [[Arcade game]]s, home computers and console systems and an extensive amount of other documents, for example: videos, posters and handbooks. It contains one of the largest collections of entertainment software and hardware in Europe.

The Computerspielemuseum's collection is the property of the Booster Club for Youth and Social Work. The new museum itself is run by Gameshouse gGmbH. Building the new permanent exhibition was financed by the German Lottery Fund in Berlin and from the [[Cultural Investment Program]] of Berlin's Cultural Affairs Department, so the [[European Regional Development Fund|ERDF]].

There are over 300 interactive exhibits illustrating the cultural history of [[computer gaming]].  One is the highlights is an actual [[video arcade]] from the 1980s with authentic arcade games from the decade that launched video games into popular culture.  All console game systems are on display from the original [[Magnavox Odyssey]] from 1972 to more recent household devices like the [[Nintendo]] systems and all versions of the [[PlayStation]] family.  An original exhibit in the museum is called the "PainStation", where the loser of the game is subject to physical punishment such as heat or a mild electric shock.&lt;ref&gt;amusingplanet.com May 15, 2011 Worlds's Largest Video Game Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

The Computerspielemuseum is a member of the [[International Council of Museums]] (ICOM) as well as the [[Nestor (Archive Network)|Nestor]] project, which is financed by the [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)]].

== Projects ==
The museum is a cooperative partner of the EU research project ''''[[Planets Project|PLANETS]]'' (Preservation and Long-term Access through Networked Services). Besides that, it is also a contributor to the EU research project [[Keeping Emulation Environments Portable]].

In fiction, '''continuity''' is consistency of the characteristics of people, plot, objects, and places seen by the reader or viewer over some period of time. It is relevant to several media.

Continuity is particularly a concern in the production of film and television due to the difficulty of rectifying an error in continuity after shooting has wrapped up. It also applies to other art forms, including novels, comics, and [[video games]], though usually on a smaller scale.  It also applies to fiction used by persons, corporations, and governments in the public eye.

Most productions have a [[script supervisor]] on hand whose job is to pay attention to and attempt to maintain continuity across the chaotic and typically non-linear production shoot. This takes the form of a large amount of paperwork, photographs, and attention to and memory of large quantities of detail, some of which is sometimes assembled into the [[Bible (writing)|story bible]] for the production. It usually regards factors both within the scene and often even technical details including meticulous records of camera positioning and equipment settings. The use of a [[Polaroid camera]] was standard but has since been replaced by [[digital camera]]s. All of this is done so that, ideally, all related shots can match, despite perhaps parts being shot thousands of miles and several months apart. It is an inconspicuous job because if done perfectly, no one will ever notice.
 
In comic books, continuity has also come to mean a [[canon (fiction)|set of contiguous events]], sometimes said to be "set in the same [[fictional universe|universe]]."

==Continuity errors==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Futurama]] --&gt;
Most continuity errors are subtle and minor, such as changes in the level of drink in a character's glass or the length of a cigarette, and can be permitted with relative indifference even to the final cut. Others can be more noticeable, such as sudden drastic changes in appearance of a character. Such errors in continuity can ruin the illusion of realism and affect [[suspension of disbelief]].

In cinema, special attention must be paid to continuity because films are rarely shot in the order in which they are presented. The shooting schedule is often dictated by location permit issues. For example, a character may return to [[Times Square]] in New York City several times throughout a movie, but as it is extraordinarily expensive to close off Times Square, those scenes will likely be filmed all at once to reduce permit costs. Weather, the ambience of natural light, cast and crew availability, or any number of other circumstances can also influence a shooting schedule.

=== {{anchor|Attempts to prevent continuity errors in film}} Measures against continuity errors in film ===

Film production companies use various techniques to prevent continuity errors. First would be to film all the shots for a particular scene together, and all shots of consecutive scenes together (if the scenes take place together, with no break between them in the film's timeline). This allows actors to remain in costume, in character, and in the same location (and with the same weather, if shooting on location).

The second major technique is for costume designers, production designers, prop masters, and make-up artists to take instant photographs of actors and sets at the beginning and end of each day's shooting (once made possible by [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] cameras, now done with digital cameras and cell phones as well). This allows the various workers to check each day's clothing, set, props, and make-up against a previous day's.

The third is to avoid shooting on location entirely, but instead film everything on a studio set. This allows weather and lighting to be controlled (as the shooting is indoors), and for all clothing and sets to be stored in one place to be hauled out the next day from a secure location.

===Editing errors===
Editing errors can occur when a character in a scene references a scene or incident that has not occurred yet, or of which they should not yet be aware.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

An example of an editing error can be seen in the film ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), where a scene of people climbing a slope at the start is seen from below and then replayed from above.

===Visual errors===
Visual errors are instant ''discontinuities'' occurring in visual media such as film and television. Items of clothing change colors, shadows get longer or shorter, items within a scene change place or disappear, etc.

One of the earliest examples of a ''visual error'' appears in [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s [[1914 in film|1914]] movie ''[[The Property Man]]''. Here, in a supposedly smooth step from one room to another, [[the Tramp]] loses his hat in one room, but it is instantly back on his head as he enters the next room. Rather "loose" plots and a lack of [[continuity editing]] made most early films rife with such errors.

Another example occurs in the [[1998 in film|1998]] film ''[[Waking Ned]]'', when two of the film's characters, Jackie and Michael, are walking through a storm towards Ned's house. The umbrella they are under is black during their conversation as they walk towards the house (filmed from slightly above and to the front), yet after cutting to a lower shot (filmed from behind Jackie), Michael walks onscreen from the right holding an [[umbrella]] that is not black but beige, with a brown band at the rim.

Yet another glaring example of poor continuity occurs in the Disney film ''[[Pete’s Dragon]]'' (filmed in 1976). During the song "Brazzle Dazzle Day" when Lampie (Mickey Rooney), Pete (Sean Marshall), and Nora (Helen Reddy) climb the stairs to the top of the lighthouse, Pete's shirt beneath his overalls is orange. But after descending to the bottom again and coming out of the lighthouse door, his shirt is now grey.

Though visual continuity errors are logically confined to visual media, parallel mistakes can occur in text. In "[[The Miller's Prologue and Tale|The Miller's Tale]]" in [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', a door is ripped off its hinges only to be slowly closed again in the next scene.

===Plot errors===
{{main|Plot hole}}

A plot error, or a plot hole as it's commonly known, reflects a failure in the consistency of the created fictional world. A character might state he was an only child, yet later mention a sibling. In the TV show ''[[Cheers]]'', Frasier Crane's wife Lilith mentions Frasier's parents are both dead. When the character was spun off into ''[[Frasier]]'', his father became a central character with, in a case of [[retroactive continuity]], the explanation that Frasier was embarrassed about his father's lowbrow attitudes and thus claimed his death. This is a frequent occurrence in sitcoms, where networks may agree to continue a show, but only if a certain character is emphasized, leading other minor characters to written out of the show with no further mention of the character's existence, while the emphasized character (usually a [[breakout character]], as in the case of [[Frasier Crane]]) develops a more complete back story that ignores previous, more simplified back stories.

===Homeric Nod===
{{Wiktionary|Homer nods}}
A '''Homeric nod''' (sometimes heard as 'Even Homer nods') is a continuity error. It has its origins in [[Homer]]ic [[epic poetry|epic]].

The [[proverbial phrase]] for it was coined by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] poet [[Horace]] in his ''[[Ars poetica]]'':&lt;ref&gt;Lines 358-359.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''... et idem'' &lt;br /&gt; ''indignor quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;... and yet I also become annoyed whenever the great Homer [[wikt:nod|nod]]s off.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are numerous continuity errors in Homer that resemble "nods", as for example:

*In ''[[Iliad]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Book V Lines 576-579&lt;/ref&gt; [[Menelaos]] kills a minor character, Pylaimenes, in combat; who is later&lt;ref&gt;Book XIII Lines 643-659&lt;/ref&gt; still alive to witness the death of his son.
*In ''Iliad'' 9.165-93 three characters, [[Phoenix (son of Amyntor)|Phoinix]], [[Odysseus]], and [[Telamonian Aias|Aias]] set out on an embassy to [[Achilleus]]; however, at line 182 the poet uses a verb in the [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] form to indicate that there are only two people going; at lines 185ff. verbs in the [[plural]] form are used, indicating more than two; but another dual verb appears at line 192 ("the two of them came forward").

In modern [[Homeric scholarship]] many of Homer's "nods" are explicable as the consequences of the poem being retold and improvised by generations of oral poets. So in the second case cited above, it is likely that two different versions are being conflated: one version with an embassy of three people, another with just two people.

[[Alexander Pope]] was inclined to give Homeric nods the benefit of the doubt:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those oft are Stratagems which Errors seem,&lt;br /&gt;Nor is it Homer Nods, but We that Dream. - ''[[Essay on Criticism]]'' &lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Modern usage====
In his online column, ''Best of The Web Today'', [[James Taranto]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' often used the phrase "Homer Nods" as the title of a retraction or correction.

===Aging discrepancies===
The practice of accelerating the age of a television character (usually a child or teenager) in conflict with the timeline of a series and/or the real-world progression of time is popularly known as [[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome]], or SORAS.&lt;ref name="Rising Stars"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tonight.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3215940&amp;fSectionId=434&amp;fSetId=204 |title=Soaps' rising stars |first=Kim |last=Clayton-Millar |date=April 24, 2006 |work=Tonight |publisher=Independent News &amp; Media |accessdate=December 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children unseen on screen for a time might reappear portrayed by an actor several years older than the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bird |first1=S. Elizabeth |title=The Audience in Everyday Life: Living in a Media World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JtkAqUHwtrIC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=%22soap+opera+sudden+aging+syndrome%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IrVYVYSWxl&amp;sig=dKEAjt43NsvvEgea73UF-lIt1zw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=V0sjS6SHCIj-nAeZ9JzuCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22soap%20opera%20sudden%20aging%20syndrome%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=December 12, 2009 |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=0-415-94259-4 |page=135 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually coinciding with a recast, this rapid aging is typically done to open up the character to a wider range of storylines, and to attract younger viewers.&lt;ref name="Rising Stars"/&gt; A recent example of this occurring is in the BBC's ''[[Merlin (TV series)|Merlin]]'' series, in which Mordred is initially played by a young child in Season 4, yet suddenly grows up into his late teens in time for the start of Season 5, with the rest of the characters aging by only three years.

The reverse can also happen. On ''[[Lost (TV Series)]]'', the character of 10-year-old [[Walt Lloyd]] was played by 12-year-old [[Malcolm David Kelley]]. The first few seasons took place over the course of just a few months, but by that point Lloyd looked much older than 10. In his remaining few appearances, special effects were used to make him look younger, or the scene took place years later.

==Deliberate continuity errors==

Sometimes a work of fiction may deliberately employ continuity errors, usually for comedy. For example, the [[Marx Brothers]]' classic film ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'', at the climax of the film, the camera shows a [[shot (filmmaking)|shot]] of [[Groucho Marx]] speaking a line, followed by a shot of something else happening, followed by another shot of Groucho. Each time, Groucho's hat changes, usually to something more outrageous than before (a [[Napoleon]]ic hat, a [[Prussia]]n hat, etc.).

==Dealing with errors==
When continuity mistakes have been made, explanations are often proposed by either writers or fans to smooth over discrepancies. Fans sometimes make up explanations for such errors that may or may not be integrated into [[canon (fiction)|canon]]; this has come to be colloquially known as ''fanwanking'' (a term originally coined by the author [[Craig Hinton]] to describe excessive use of continuity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=AHistory: An Unauthorized History of the ''Doctor Who'' universe |last=Parkin |first=Lance |authorlink=Lance Parkin  |year=2007 |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Mad Norwegian Press]] |location=Des Moines, Iowa |isbn=978-0-9759446-6-0 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often when fans do not agree with one of the events in a story (such as the death of a favorite character), they will choose to ignore the event in question so that their enjoyment of the franchise is not diminished. When the holder of the intellectual property discards all existing continuity and starts from scratch it is known as [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooting]]. Fans call a less extreme literary technique that erases one episode the [[reset button technique|reset button]]. See also [[Canon (fiction)#Fanon|fanon]].

Discrepancies in past continuity are sometimes made deliberately; this is known as [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]]ning. Retcons are also sometimes used to either correct or cover up a perceived error. These changes may be made either by the same writer who made it, or more commonly by an author that has taken over the creative lead of a corporate owned show or publication.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Not to be confused with the continuance of a reality (continuality).

==Real time programs vs traditional films==
Television programs like ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', in which actors have to appear as if it is the same day for 24 consecutive episodes, have raised public recognition of continuity. However, traditional films have frequently had much of the same sort of the issues to deal with; film shoots may last several months and as scenes are frequently shot out of story sequence, footage shot weeks apart may be edited together as part of the same day's action in the completed film. In some ways, ''24'' presents a simpler situation, as costumes and hairstyles generally should ''not'' change very frequently; in many feature films a range of different hairstyles and costumes must be created, changed, and then recreated exactly, as various scenes are shot.

== Overview ==
CrowdRise's fundraising model is based upon the notion of making giving back fun,&lt;ref name="Wallace2015"&gt;{{cite book |author=Patricia Wallace |title=The Psychology of the Internet |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IIOpCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA161 |date=26 November 2015 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-07913-7 |pages=161– |quote=Actor Edward Norton promotes the site called Crowdrise.com, which takes an offbeat and often humorous approach to crowdfunding for good causes.

Its primary model is donation-based, and the campaign defaults to keep-what-you-raise.

Their default "Starter" pricing is to charge the non-profit a 5% platform fee from each donation, plus a payment processing fee (credit card fee) of 2.9% + $0.30 per donation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fundraising.crowdrise.com/nonprofit-pricing|title=Non-profit pricing|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Crowdrise.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=July 18, 2018|quote="Free to get started.  5% platform fee.  2.9% + 0.30 payment processing."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donors may choose whether to pay the fee in addition to the amount of their donation or to have the fee subtracted from their donation amount before being delivered.&lt;ref name="fees"&gt;{{cite web|title=What are these fees for?

'''Daisy Violet Rose Wood''' (15 September 1877 &amp;ndash; 19 October 1961), was an English [[music hall]] singer.

==Life and career==
Wood was born in [[Hoxton]], [[London]], the fifth of nine children, the oldest being Matilda Alice Victoria Wood (1870–1922), who performed under the stage name [[Marie Lloyd]]. Seven of the siblings took up stage careers. In their earliest years, costumed by their mother (Matilda Mary Caroline), they performed as ''The Fairy Bells Minstrels'', singing temperance songs in local missions and church halls.&lt;ref&gt;In 1881 the family appear to have lived at 3 Bath Place, St Lukes. John Wood is 33, born in [[Bethnal Green]]. Matilda, 29, born in [[Shoreditch]] ''FHL Film 1341078 PRO Ref RG11 Piece 0361 Folio 103 Page 33''&lt;/ref&gt; This ceased when the eldest sister made her professional debut at the age of fifteen.&lt;ref&gt;Gracie and Alice met a young girl named (Leah) Bella Orchard, while all performing in pantomime, at the [[Pavilion Theatre, Whitechapel]], they took the 11-year-old home for tea. By the following year, she was living with the family and worked as Marie's dresser. Later, she performed with Rosie, as the ''Sisters Lloyd'', and became known as Bella Lloyd.&lt;/ref&gt; The children were entranced by music hall, their father (John, an artificial florist) working in the evenings at the nearby Royal Eagle Tavern.

Daisy made her own first professional appearance in a play entitled ''My Willie'' at the South London Palace, on 17 March 1890. She went on to perform a solo musical act, making the most of her petite and dainty figure. She was thought to have been the prettiest of the sisters.

On 26 April 1899 she married Donald Alexander Munro, an insurance broker and chairman of the Crown Theatre. She was only 21, and her husband 26, when she retired from the theatre. They had two children, Donald (1902) and Dorothy Grace (1906). They moved to [[Kensington]], but Donald fell ill the following year, and their fortunes were under pressure.

In her late twenties, Daisy returned to the stage, and due to the increasing fame of her sisters, at the top of the bill. In 1908 she was offered an immense sum to tour [[New York (state)|New York]] with her sisters (Marie, Alice and Rosie), by the [[William Morris Agency]], and in the autumn they performed in New York, to great acclaim.

Her husband died on 24 September 1911, aged 39. She continued to tour throughout the British Isles and internationally, until she finally retired in 1928, but occasionally returned to the stage with her sisters Alice and Rosie during the 1930s and [[World War II]].

Daisy Wood died on 19 October 1961, aged 84 at her home in [[Banstead]], [[Surrey]].

Jahn is best known for his louche MC persona Sonny Vargas&lt;ref name="PPost"&gt;Johnston, R., [http://www.praguepost.com/142-culture/42008-review-prague-burlesque-at-cafe-royal "Cabaret-style shows takes the striptease back in time"], ''[[Prague Post]]'', Oct. 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; with the stage troupe Prague Burlesque, which he founded in 2007 and developed into a local institution and international touring company. According to Prague TV, "his aim is to continue the long tradition of burlesque, and to make this concept popular once again."&lt;ref&gt;Anon., [http://prague.tv/en/s72/Directory/c206-Art-and-Culture/n2242-the-prague-burlesque-show "Royal presents the Prague Burlesque show"], Prague TV, Sept. 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the stage debut of Prague Burlesque in September 2007, the last burlesque performance in Prague had taken place in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Edge, B., [http://www.praguepost.cz/archivescontent/5247-bring-on-the-dancing-girls.html "Bring on the dancing girls"], ''Prague Post'', Feb. 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by the [[Weimar culture]] of interwar Berlin, as well as by Michelle Carr's 1990s Los Angeles revival troupe Velvet Hammer Burlesque and by [[Dita Von Teese]], Jahn maintains that the genre adheres to a strict set of rules. "For instance, I never reveal a woman's entire nude body. Rather, I indicate what lay beyond her undergarments, always working with the feeling that more will follow. The essence of burlesque is in parodying [[Courtesan#As_primary_employment|courtesanal]] modes of conduct, which I like to unfold—''gangasrotogati''—in what might be called the gentle spirit of sarcastic orgasm. By and large, our work is erotic comedy," he told [[Česká televize|Czech Television]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Anon., [http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/kultura/1200721-burleska-nabizi-cistou-kabaretni-zabavu "Burleska nabízí čistou kabaretní zábavu"], [[Česká televize]], Dec. 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, burlesque resonates with Jahn's childhood—two of his grandparents were opera singers, and as an adult he enjoys watching this erotic form of operetta make its return to the European stage.&lt;ref name="PPost" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bezr, O., [http://kultura.zpravy.idnes.cz/video-prazska-burleska-sonny-vargas-d7v-/hudba.aspx?c=A150828_180851_hudba_ob "Štítí se burleska pokleslosti? Podívejte se na klip jejího zpěváka"], ''[[:cs:iDNES.cz|iDNES.cz]]'', Aug. 29, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
As a filmmaker, Jahn directs and produces music videos, television commercials and documentaries. His best-known directorial work is the 2009 feature documentary ''H.R. Giger Revealed'', which he also coproduced through his company Deep Side Production s.r.o.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.dokweb.net/en/documentary-network/czech-docs/-h.r.-giger-revealed-3448/ ''H.R.

'''Dramatic monologue''', also known as a [[persona]] poem, is a type of poetry written in the form of a speech of an individual character. [[M.H. Abrams]] notes the following three features of the ''dramatic monologue'' as it applies to poetry:
{{Quotation|
# A single person, who is patently ''not'' the poet, utters the speech that makes up the whole of the poem, in a specific situation at a critical moment […].
# This person addresses and interacts with one or more other people; but we know of the auditors' presence, and what they say and do, only from clues in the discourse of the single speaker.
# The main principle controlling the poet's choice and formulation of what the lyric speaker says is to reveal to the reader, in a way that enhances its interest, the speaker's temperament and character.&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Abrams, gen. ed. "Dramatic Monologue." ''A Glossary of Literary Terms.'' 8th ed. Boston: Thomson Wadsworth, 2005. 70-71.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Types of dramatic  monologue==

One of the most important influences on the development of the dramatic monologue  is [[romantic poetry]]. However, the long, personal lyrics typical of the Romantic period are not dramatic monologues, in the sense that they do not, for the most part, imply a concentrated narrative. Poems such as [[William Wordsworth]]'s ''[[Tintern Abbey (poem)|Tintern Abbey]]'' and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s ''[[Mont Blanc (poem)|Mont Blanc]]'', to name two famous examples, offered a model of close psychological observation and philosophical or pseudo-philosophical inquiry described in a specific setting.  The [[conversation poems]] of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] are perhaps a better precedent. The genre was also developed by [[Felicia Hemans]] and [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]], beginning in the latter's case with her long poem ''The Improvisatrice''.&lt;ref&gt;Serena Baiesi. ''Letitia Elizabeth Landon and Metrical Romance'', 2009, p.56-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel and plays have also been important influences on the dramatic monologue, particularly as a means of characterization. Dramatic monologues are a way of expressing the views of a character and offering the audience greater insight into that character's feelings. Dramatic monologues can also be used in novels to tell stories, as in [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'', and to implicate the audience in moral judgments, as in [[Albert Camus]] ''[[The Fall (Albert Camus novel)|The Fall]]'' and [[Mohsin Hamid]]'s ''[[The Reluctant Fundamentalist]]''.

== Examples ==

The [[Victorian era|Victorian]] period represented the high point of the dramatic monologue in English poetry.

*[[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]'s ''[[Ulysses (poem)|Ulysses]]'', published in 1842, has been called the first true dramatic monologue. After ''Ulysses'', Tennyson's most famous efforts in this vein are ''Tithonus'', ''The Lotos-Eaters,'' and ''St. Simon Stylites,'' all from the 1842 ''[[Poems (Tennyson, 1842)|Poems]]''; later monologues appear in other volumes, notably ''[[Idylls of the King]]''.
*[[Matthew Arnold]]'s ''[[Dover Beach]]'' and ''Stanzas from the Grand Chartreuse'' are famous, semi-autobiographical monologues. The former, usually regarded as the supreme expression of the growing [[scepticism (philosophy)|scepticism]] of the mid-Victorian period, was published along with the latter in 1867's ''New Poems.''
*[[Robert Browning]] produced his most famous work in this form. While ''[[My Last Duchess]]'' is the most famous of his monologues, the form dominated his writing career. ''[[The Ring and the Book]]'', ''[[Fra Lippo Lippi (poem)|Fra Lippo Lippi]]'', ''[[Caliban upon Setebos]]'', ''[[Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister]]'' and ''[[Porphyria's Lover]]'', as well as the other poems in ''[[Men and Women (poetry collection)|Men and Women]]'' are just a handful of Browning's monologues.

Other Victorian poets also used the form.  [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] wrote several, including ''Jenny'' and ''The Blessed Damozel''; [[Christina Rossetti]] wrote a number, including ''The Convent Threshold.'' [[Augusta Webster]]'s ''A Castaway,'' ''Circe'', and ''The Happiest Girl In The World'', [[Amy Levy]]'s ''Xantippe'' and ''A Minor Poet,'' and [[Felicia Hemans]]'s ''Arabella Stuart'' and ''Properzia Rossi'' are all exemplars of this technique. [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]'s ''[[Hymn to Proserpine]]'' has been called a dramatic monologue vaguely reminiscent of Browning's work. Some American poets have also written poems in the genre- famous examples include [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s [[The Raven]] and [[Sylvia Plath]]'s [[Daddy (poem)|Daddy]].

Post-Victorian examples include [[William Butler Yeats]]'s ''The Gift of Harun al-Rashid'', [[Elizabeth Bishop]]'s ''Crusoe in England'', and [[T.S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]'' and ''[[Gerontion]]''.

'''Henry Evans''' (c. 1832 – 17 June 1905) was a conjurer, [[ventriloquist]] and humorist, born in Kennington, South London, who used the stage name '''''Evanion'''''. Performances in front of members of the British Royal Family, including Queen Victoria at Sandringham, and the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) and Princess Alexandra at Marlborough House, enabled him to use the name "The Royal Conjuror" in his publicity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portico.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/evancoll/t/014eva000000000u04441000.html Ticket for a "Wonderful and Amusing Entertainment" by M. Evanion.] [[British Library]] 2011. Retrieved 21 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Evans had a successful career of over fifty years from 1849, performing in theatres and [[music hall]]s in London and the English provinces and at private functions. He was an inveterate collector who created a collection of around 5000 items of [[ephemera]] relating to popular Victorian entertainment and daily life that is now in the [[British Library]] as [[Evanion Collection|The Evanion Collection]]. The collection was purchased by the British Museum Library in 1895.&lt;ref name=bl&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/ephemera/evanionvictorianephemera/evanionvictorianephemera.html The Evanion Collection.] British Library 2011. Retrieved 21 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He was acquainted with [[Harry Houdini]] who purchased a quantity of items related to magic and illusions from Evans in 1904. According to Houdini, Evans spent every spare hour at the British Museum collecting information about the history of magic.&lt;ref name=hh&gt;Houdini, Harry. ''The Unmasking of Robert-Houdin''. New York: The Publishers Printing Co., 1908, pp. 20-26. [http://openlibrary.org/books/OL6996054M/The_unmasking_of_Robert-Houndin Electronic version here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Evans died, impoverished, of cancer of the throat at Lambeth Infirmary on 17 June 1905. He was survived by his wife who died not long afterwards.&lt;ref name=hh/&gt;

It is one of Denmark's biggest amusement parks and has the largest [[water park]] of any amusement park in the country. The park currently has six [[roller coaster]]s and many other rides as well.

==History==
Opened on June 21, 1975 by the Kragelund family which had been in the wholesale business in [[Aalborg]] for 90 years when Anders Kragelund decided to sell and start a new business - an amusement park. He chose for the site of this venture North Jutland, a beautiful and popular holiday area in Denmark. The amusement park opened small with only a handful of children´s rides and attracted about 40.000 guests in its first operating season in 1975. Over the years the park has grown in popularity and been expanded in area as well, by 1983 many new rides had been added and about 350.000 people visited the park that year. In 1989 a water park was added ([[Djurs Sommerland]] had added a water park in 1985). Since 2001 the park has added 5 new roller coasters to its slate, most recently in 2012 and 2013.

The majority of the rides in this park cater to every member of the family making this a very child-friendly amusement park. The park is nicely landscaped with plenty of trees everywhere and a lake separating the amusement park area from the water park. Even though some of the rides are themed the park itself is not divided into specifically themed areas. The Aqua Park is included in the admission price.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13871">'''Gregangelo’s Velocity Circus/Arts and Entertainment''' is a [[San Francisco]]-based [[circus]] troupe and entertainment company that incorporates the arts, technology, [[Astrophysics|astrophysical]] concepts and cultural diversity into their performance acts. The circus and entertainment company was founded in 1993 by Gregangelo Herrera, a [[whirling dervish]], aerial arts choreographer and drummer. The company’s signature performances incorporate multiculturalism, ensemble aerial acts, optical illusions and interactive play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deyoung.famsf.org/calendar/performances-gregangelo-and-velocity-circus|title=Performances by Gregangelo and Velocity Circus|date=1 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operating as one-out shows, the troupe and entertainment company create performances with a cast of local San Francisco and Bay Area artists, including several artists they have sponsored from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;TEDxYouth@Castilleja-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=737HdHJYzOQ&lt;/ref&gt;

For twenty-five years, Velocity Circus has remained an independent company, without federal or private grants or program funding. Though an independent, entrepreneurial set up is unusual for most circus troupes, the troupe has experienced a range of financial and commercial success. Gregangelo’s Velocity Circus/Arts and Entertainment is commissioned by non-profits, festivals, museums, corporate events and tech startup events for its hour long shows and three hour immersive experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baymusic.com/gregangelo-velocity-circus-troupe-2/|title=Gregangelo &amp; Velocity Circus Troupe -  Bay Music &amp; Entertainment|website=www.baymusic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregangelo’s Velocity Arts and Entertainment Company has created performances and installations, interalia, for [[Warner Bros.]], [[Microsoft]], [[Lucasfilm]], [[Lexus]], [[Univision]], [[Yelp]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yelp.com/events/phoenix-yelp-in-bloom-at-desert-botanical-garden|title=Yelp In Bloom at Desert Botanical Garden, Phoenix, AZ|website=Yelp}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cisco Systems]], and [[Mercedes-Benz]]. For every show, performers double as crew members for Velocity Arts and Entertainment, tailor the costumes and pitch ideas. The arts and entertainment company supports the circus, providing all of the multi-media, motion media, music, costume, makeup, hair and wigs, technology, writing, scenic, lighting, special effects, installations, infrastructure, photography, painters, sculptors, makers, and any other in-house visual support and aesthetic supporting.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=737HdHJYzOQ|title=TEDxYouth@Castilleja - GREGANGELO|first=|last=TEDxYouth|date=12 December 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gregangelo Museum]] serves as the companies headquarters.

==Origins==
Gregangelo Herrera was seventeen when he started his Saturday night show at the Pasha Club as a whirling dervish, drummer, and folkloric dancer. The supper club had a Moroccan fantasy aesthetic, and was a metropolitan spin on Sahara City, a small Middle Eastern circus in [[Cairo]]. Gregangelo Herrera developed the act in a direction that was more futuristic and modern than the traditional Dervish act he was hired to perform and was consequently fired three times. However, they rehired him three times as well. During this period in his adolescence, he trained in dance and developed his whirling dervish act with Amina Goodyear, a cultural dance and music teacher who owned Aswan Dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keynotespeakers.com/speaker_detail.php?speakerid=4727|title=Gregangelo Gregangelo - Speaker Profile|website=keynotespeakers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susu Pampanin, one of the Aswan Dance teachers in drumming, locally produced the Cairo Cat performance, where Herrera performed as an ensemble drummer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/dancing-drums-mw0000579907/credits|title=Dancing Drums - Susu Pampanin, Susu Pampanin and the Cairo Cats - Credits - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community performances gave Herrera exposure at a young age and was formative to his philosophy about money and art.

At the age of eighteen, Herrera declared an individualized major at [[California College of the Arts]], which incorporated multimedia, textiles, cultural studies, videography, woodworking, and drawing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/His-Velocity-Circus-is-so-named-for-good-reason-2670602.php|title=His Velocity Circus is so named for good reason -- its founder is a whirling dervish on and offstage|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major he created allowed him to produce shows later on. Paying for school as he attended, Herrera worked at a contemporary art gallery called Japonesque. He also traveled to the remote areas in the Middle East with school grant money and earned credits for cultural studies while he continued to develop his solo career.

Gregangelo Herrera was training at the San Francisco School of Circus Arts ([[Circus Center]]) to develop his aerial arts skills when he met Zeina Asfour, another circus performer of Lebanese descent. While training together, surrounding circus performers began to collaborate with Herrera, gaining an interest in his artist for-profit mentality.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Herrera began choreographing circus acts that employed a Middle Eastern sensibility while incorporating aspects of astrophysics. Herrera provides in many of his interviews and through his museum tours that he attempts to reveal how momentum, velocity and the natural elements interplay in the circus field. For example, he still employs the laws of physics into the themes and titles of his choreographed performances.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.upout.com/blog/san-francisco-3/a-look-inside-san-franciscos-hidden-cosmic-wonderland-the-gregangelo-museum&lt;/ref&gt;

Herrera became aware of the [[Big Bang]] theory in the 1990s;&lt;ref&gt;Notes from in person tour&lt;/ref&gt; in 1992 scientists witnessed through a telescope what they thought was a universe coming into existence. Obsessed with the Big Bang theory, Herrera wanted a company name that described the force of everything that exists in the universe. Thus, Herrera thought the equation for velocity (velocity equals distance over time) fit the kinetic nature of circus arts, performance arts, and the arts in general. Finding that art comes into existence through movement is very characteristic of the traditional Whirling Dervish philosophy.

==Productions (Circus and Arts and Entertainment)==
===Neptune Act===
With an early start at the Circus Center, Herrera produced multiple aerial acts. During the Neptune Act, aerial artists performed in pitch black lighting, wearing [[UV]] reactive costuming. Appearing on the apparatus at abnormal times gave viewers the idea that the performers were appearing and disappearing.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Herrera would continue to employ this multimedia technique throughout other shows.

===Heliosphere and Heliosphere Jr.===
Velocity Circus Arts and Entertainment company’s global and continental exposure increased after the show '''Heliosphere''' went on tour to county festivals around the United States as a for-hire circus troupe. Paul Del Bene co-wrote the show, which attempted to look at the [[Solar System|solar system]] and beyond the solar system, and was composed of stand alone acts based in astrophysics, such as a double contortion act called Eclipse, a fire act called Solar, and the whirling dervish act called Vortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imafool.com/pages/directing.html|title=Imafool Productions: Directing. Dirigere|website=www.imafool.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Encapsulating the company's arabic and physics based aesthetic, the show attracted regional and national festivals and theaters. Though it started as a show geared towards adult viewers for its revealing costumes, mature humor and concepts, Velocity Circus was commissioned to tighten up Heliosphere for a family audience.

'''Heliosphere Jr.''' was created as an adaptation to the original Heliosphere featuring the same interactive and immersive tactics. Another purpose of the acts were to introduce world culture all over the United States, in an effort to bring San Francisco multiculturalism to small towns in middle America.&lt;ref&gt;The Cincinnati Enquirer. Cincinnati, Ohio. Friday, May 21, 2004. Page 131.&lt;/ref&gt; The show was assembled with the goal of engaging youth while serving as an educational platform, though they have no formal educators in training, the Legion of Honor has employed the circus troupe many times to continue performances that double as educational platforms.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heliopolis===
Heliopolis was commissioned for the [[Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs]] exhibition at the [[De Young (museum)|de Young Museum]] in San Francisco. The production attempted to provide a panorama of Egyptian history, mythology, folklore and fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wn.com/velocity_circus_contortion|title=Velocity Circus Contortion|website=World News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performance featured hypnotic hand dances, hoops of fire, contortionists, aerialists, and snake charmers. The cast included 20 artists.

===Fa Femina Miss India Pageant===
Velocity Circus’ India show at Fa [[Femina Miss India]] Pageant adopted some of the acts from Heliosphere while incorporating new acts that featured an Indian inspired dance act, a Persian fire act, and an Egyptian whirling dervish act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beautypageants.indiatimes.com/And-the-Femina-Miss-India-Universe-2002-is-Neha/articleshow/22560450.cms|title='And the Femina Miss India - Universe 2002 is... Neha' - Beauty Pageants - Indiatimes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performance in [[Hyderabad]], India, attracted Velocity Circus' largest television audience to date.

==Immersive Experiences==
===Illuminated Garden Performance and Installation===
The Illuminated Garden was commissioned by tech companies and took place in a park in [[Palo Alto, California]]. The performance followed the arc of the day, starting at noon and ending at midnight. The show was an interactive performance where the audience became the characters in the show, flying on the trapeze, climbing and crawling through interactive installations and investigating the world through a circus experience. Audience members’ faces were projected onto a 16-foot tall video sculpture titled the PyramID. Velocity Circus scheduled a brief break for dinner, during which, the garden became illuminated in glow-in-the-dark [[LED lights]]. Audience members wore 3D glasses and walked through a 3-dimensional labyrinth, wading through grass reeds and flowers as floating aerial artists swung overhead in lit-up orbs.

===Human Logos===
In a rebranding campaign, Mercedes-Benz and Univision commissioned Herrera to recreate their logos by using aerial artists to hang suspended in mid-air.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gregangelo.com/entertainment/corporate-branding/attachment/1-acrobat-mercedes-benz-logo/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaborators and Competitors===
Gregangelo Herrera has collaborated with some of his would be competitors, but Velocity Circus is still not completely competitor free. The circus arts have been popular in San Francisco, and long time standing circus arts organizations like Acrosports and the San Francisco Circus Center, that were once collaborators now compete for show bookings.

Other close relatives of the circus arts compete for commissions and have similar platforms to Velocity Circus. Vau de Vire Society is a San Francisco born company that features burlesque aesthetics, musicians that double as circus performers, and provocative music. As Velocity Circus has honed in its skills to appeal to younger audiences and family events for example the kid's section at the Parade of Tall Ships,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baycrossings.com/dispnews.php?id=2016&lt;/ref&gt; Vau de Vire is just one of the circus troupes that appeals to adult life that is booming in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/mommyfiles/article/Many-families-leave-San-Francisco-but-what-about-10887001.php&lt;/ref&gt; The circus can be very sexual in many respects, and Velocity Circus shows employ mature jokes that seem harmless on the surface, using rhetoric like "deflowering" and "seeds" at county festivals where the towns are known for their produce.&lt;ref&gt;http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2012/03/27/1016260/0/en/Asparagus-Festival-Includes-Deluge-of-Entertainment-Near-Downtown-Stockton-Hotels.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A circus troupe in Pennsylvania, Double Blind Productions, has very similar concepts as Velocity Circus, including a narrative show much like Velocity Circus' shows, called Escape Velocity.&lt;ref&gt;https://doubleblindproductions.wordpress.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The troupe is  self proclaimed comedians, artisans, Ariel artists and musicians.

Kinetic Arts Center is a Bay Area based circus troupe that also offers classes to the general public and competes with Velocity Circus in marketing their shows.

Herrera himself believes in collaboration, and avidly makes a point on his CCA alumnus page about the benefits of artistic collaboration especially as funding for the arts decline in today's political atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cca.edu/news/2008/11/21/alumnus-spotlight-gregangelo-herrera&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Herrera's collaborators are Trapeze Arts Incorporated, Earth Circus and Trapeze World.

==Incidents and Contentions==
In 2015, Velocity Circus had a problem with their generator and an ice rink show had to be cancelled. Since then Lighting of the Embarcadero Ice Rink has only used Disney on Ice.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sfmta.com/blog/union-square-winter-walk-back&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hangame''' ({{lang-ko|한게임}}) is a popular [[South Korea]]n [[online game]] portal operated by NHN Entertainment Corporation (formerly known as NHN Corporation). Launched in December 1999, Hangame offers casual, first-person shooter, [[MMORPG]]s, sports, and other genres. With over 20 million members and a peak concurrent user base of 290,000 in South Korea, it is the country's largest game portal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhncorp.com/nhnen/service/hangame.nhn&lt;/ref&gt; Hangame also has affiliates in Japan (NHN PlayArt). It also offers channeling and publishing services for many popular online games.

==History==
Hangame was launched in December 1999 as the online game service of Hangame Communications, which changed its name to NHN in September 2001. In 2000, Hangame entered the Japanese online market with Hangame, Japan. The following year, Hangame became an [[video game publisher|online game publisher]]. In 2003, [[mobile game]]s were also started to be offered by Hangame. In 2004, it moved into the Chinese market with Ourgame, a joint venture company with Sea Rainbow Holdings Corp however discontinued the service in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhncorp.com/nhnen_/ir/AnnualReport/2012/NHN_2011_AR_ENG.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, it entered the U.S. market with the launch of the English service ijji.com however sold the stake of ijji.com on December 2011. In June 2012 NHN created a strategic partnership with [[InnoSpark]] for global publishing of smartphone games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamechosun.co.kr/article/view.php?no=90185 |title=한게임-이노스파크, 스마트폰 게임 퍼블리싱 계약 체결 |publisher=Gamechosun.co.kr |date= |accessdate=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 1, 2013 NHN was re-split into NHN Entertainment Corporation and Naver Corporation for strategic reasons and Hangame is currently serviced by NHN Entertainment.

==Features==
Hangame provides both casual titles, like board games and card games, as well as hard-core games like first-person shooters and massively multi-player online role-playing games. All games offer the use of [[Avatar (computing)|avatars]] and community services, allowing players to interact with each other. Many games also offer in-game items - such as clothing, armor, and weapons - that can be purchased for a small fee. Hangame offers both for-fee and free-to-play games.

==Toast.com==
Toast.com is the international game web portal for NHN Entertainment Corporation's mobile games. The web portal was created during its expansion to the United States in 2013 and is updated regularly when new mobile games get released either in "Soft Launch" or Global Launch. Toast.com is considered to be the new branding name for NHN Entertainment Corporation's mobile game division as they expand beyond its Hangame web game portal outside of the South Korean market.

The Toast.com portal acts as a base ecosystem to present its mobile games, community and pre-registration events, multimedia, and art assets, while acting as redirect to its licensed mobile games both on the Apple iTunes App Store and Google Play app store.

As of 2015, 16 mobile games are present either on the Apple IOS application or on Google's Android application.

'''Jimmy Nelson''' (born December 15, 1928) is an American [[ventriloquist]] who appeared on [[television]] in the 1950s and 1960s. He is most famous for commercials for [[Nestlé]] chocolate featuring [[Farfel the Dog]]. He also hosted a children's show sponsored by Nestlé.

==Early life==
Jimmy Nelson was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] on December 15, 1928. When he was ten years old, his aunt won a toy [[ventriloquist's dummy]] named "Dummy Dan" in a [[Bingo (card game)|Bingo]] game and gave it to her nephew for [[Christmas]]. He learned ventriloquism, and a year later, his father upgraded the dummy's mouth control from a simple string-and-loop to a lever-system like those used in professional ventriloquist's dummies.&lt;ref name=TalkingComedy&gt;{{cite web

   |publisher  = Talking Comedy.com
   |year       = 2005
   |accessdate = 2010-11-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nelson began taking "Dan" to school, where his fourth-grade teacher allowed him to use the dummy when speaking in front of the class. In this way, Nelson taught himself to overcome his fear of public speaking. He soon started using jokes in his presentation, discovering he could make his classmates laugh.&lt;ref name=TalkingComedy/&gt;

He then started performing for church groups, schools and American Legion posts. By the time he was a teenager, he started earning money competing in amateur talent contests held at the local movie theatres, where the prize was five dollars for the most popular act.

==Professional career==
In 1945, Nelson asked famed Chicago ventriloquist figure maker Frank Marshall to make him a professional-quality dummy. Marshall, who had made [[Edgar Bergen|Edgar Bergen's]] ''Charlie McCarthy'' and [[Paul Winchell|Paul Winchell's]] ''Jerry Mahoney'', would only do this after seeing the ventriloquist's work. He came to one of Nelson's theatre performances and was impressed, so sold Nelson a custom-made dummy, which he always carved to bear a resemblance to the ventriloquist.

Nelson gave Dummy Dan's replacement the full name ''Danny O'Day'', which he chose because it contained none of the [[consonants]] impossible for ventriloquists to say without moving the lips, unlike "McCarthy" and "Mahoney". He then hired a manager and started touring professionally.&lt;ref name=TalkingComedy/&gt;

By 1947, Nelson was a professional success and Danny O'Day began to show signs of wear, so Nelson hired Marshall to build him a second one. However, Marshall's hand-carved originals (which he tailored to the personality of the ventriloquist) were impossible to duplicate identically, and Nelson felt the second dummy didn't look sufficiently like Danny to replace him. So he decided to maintain Danny, and added heavy eyebrows, eyeglasses and a beret to the new dummy, creating a foil for Danny named ''Humphrey Higsbye''.

In September 1950, Nelson made his first appearance with Danny on [[The Ed Sullivan Show]].

In the late 1950s, Jimmy Nelson released two LP records, One being "Pinocchio", which involved his four major dummies, which was released on Cricket Records in 1959, and the other being "Jokes and Riddles", which was done before a live audience of children, released on Rocking Horse Records.

===Farfel the dog===
One night that year, while working a late show in a [[Wichita, Kansas]] nightclub, he picked up a stuffed dog a patron had left on the piano, and improvised a low-pitched voice to make it talk. This gave him the idea for a new character which he had Marshall build. He named it [[Farfel the Dog|Farfel]], after the [[Farfel|Jewish pasta dish]] he had seen on the menu of the [[Borscht Belt]] resorts in [[upstate New York]] where he performed.  His famous line was : "No, I wouldn't say that"

===Television career===
In 1950, Nelson was hired as a regular on the [[Texaco Star Theatre]] TV show hosted by [[Milton Berle]]. Nelson and Danny O'Day would appear in [[Texaco]] [[gas jockey]] uniforms.

At one point, he added another animal dummy to his character repertoire, a cat named Ftatateeta after a character in [[George Bernard Shaw|George Bernard Shaw's]] play ''[[Caesar and Cleopatra (play)|Caesar and Cleopatra]]''. The cat's voice was based on Ed Wynn's.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} In 1954, Nelson served as emcee on the game shows ''[[Bank on the Stars]]'' and ''Come Closer''.&lt;ref name="BrooksMarsh"&gt;

===Nestlé commercials===
In 1955, the Nestlé company hired Nelson to do commercials selling their chocolate candy and [[Nesquik|Nestlé's Quik]] chocolate milk flavoring. The Nestlé executives had him audition by spontaneously performing their newly written [[jingle]]. Nelson sang the first two (musical) lines in Danny's voice:
:''N-E-S-T-L-E-S,''
:''Nestlé's makes the very best...''
He finished with Farfel slowly singing the last word "chocolate", in two syllables. Nelson was so nervous that his hands sweated, and when Farfel was finished, his finger slipped off the control, causing the mouth to audibly snap shut, a mistake no ventriloquist should make. Nelson left the audition thinking he had blown it, but was surprised to learn he was hired; in fact, the executives actually liked the mouth-snapping effect and asked that he keep it. This became his trademark as the commercials ran for ten years.

When advertising Nestlé's Quik, Danny O'Day would say it "makes milk taste...like a ''million''" (dollars), again slowly and pausing for effect.

===Film career===
In 2009 Nelson was featured in the ventriloquist comedy documentary ''I'm No Dummy'',&lt;ref name="I'm No Dummy"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0926091/] IMDB: I'm No Dummy https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0926091/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Digital Cinema Report"&gt;[http://digitalcinemareport.com/node/1165] Digital Cinema Report http://digitalcinemareport.com/node/1165&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Bryan W. Simon]].

==Later years==

Nelson and his wife Betty have been residents of Cape Coral, Florida since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Jimmy Nelson is moving to Cape Coral http://ufdc.ufl.edu/SW10000983/00001&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared with Danny and Farfel at local schools and was a long time spokesperson for First Federal Savings and Loan of Fort Myers.

Nelson was dubbed "The Dean of American Ventriloquists" in 2011.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Nelson collaborated in 2011 with maker of professional ventriloquist figures [[Tim Selberg]] to produce a character that pays homage to his Danny O'Day.

==Family==
Nelson and Margot's three children were twins Larry and Lee, and a third son Jerry. They lived for many years in Forest Hills, NY and later in Jamaica, NY.

'''''La Chauve-Souris''''' (French: '''''The Bat''''') was the name of a touring [[revue]] during the early 1900s. Originating in Moscow and then Paris, and directed by [[Nikita Balieff]], the revue toured the United States, Europe, and South Africa. The show consisted of songs, dances, and sketches, most of which had been originally performed in Russia.&lt;ref name=Altman&gt;{{cite book

==Early production history in Moscow, Paris, and London==
In 1906, [[Armenia]]n actor [[Nikita Balieff]] moved to Moscow, and took a job at the [[Moscow Art Theatre]] under [[Constantin Stanislavski]]. After years of only non-speaking roles, and with a desire to perform comedy rather than drama, Balieff, along with theatre devotee [[Nikolai Tarasov]], co-created his own theatre group in a basement near the Moscow Art Theatre. He named the cabaret and troupe ''The Bat'', after a well-known cabaret in Vienna called ''Fledermaus''. 

''The Bat'' enjoyed much success and popularity in Moscow, until the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917. Balieff then went into exile in western Europe, and began presenting vaudeville shows there with other Russian [[émigré]]s. ''La Chauve-Souris'' opened in Paris in December 1920. The spectacle was noticed by the British theatrical producer [[Charles B. Cochran]], who brought Balieff and his troupe and show to London.

==In the United States==
In 1922 ''La Chauve-Souris'' made its first tour to America, through an arrangement with the producer [[Morris Gest]]. ''La Chauve Souris'' performed on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] from February 1922 to June 1922 (153 performances) and January 1925 to March 1925 (61 performances) in productions produced by [[F. Ray Comstock]] and Morris Gest. Balieff and his company also toured from Washington, D.C. to [[California]] for 65 consecutive weeks. 

Between 1922 and 1929, Balieff returned to America to tour six times, appearing on Broadway in 1922, 1923, 1925, 1927, and 1929, with one final show billed as ''New Chauve-Souris'' in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The shows consisted of songs, dances, and sketches, most of which had been originally performed in Russia. Balieff, as master of ceremonies for the show, was known for his feigned lack of English on stage. His monologues and introductions were delivered in a mix of Russian, French, and English language and slang coupled with much gesticulation. However, in private Balieff's English was better than that of his stage persona.

[[File:Rockettes 4158770026 4a61916952.jpg|thumb|290px|right|[[The Rockettes]]' annual "Parade of the Wooden Soldiers" mimics the original ''Chauve-Souris'' choreography.]]
One of ''La Chauve-Souris''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s most popular acts, ''[[The Parade of the Wooden Soldiers]]'', which used the delightful [[Leon Jessel]] tune "''Die Parade der Zinnsoldaten''" ("The Parade of the Tin Soldiers"), referenced a story regarding [[Paul I of Russia|Tsar Paul I]]. The legend claims the Tsar left his parade grounds without issuing a "halt" order to the marching soldiers. Without one, the soldiers marched to [[Siberia]] before being remembered and ordered back. The Balieff vaudeville version with its popular tune was a mainstay in ''Chauve-Souris'', and later became part of [[The Rockettes]] repertoire as well in their [[Radio City Christmas Spectacular]]. The ''Chauve-Souris'' "Parade of the Wooden Soldiers" was also filmed, and premiered on April 15, 1923 at the Rivoli Theater. 

''La Chauve-Souris'' also toured Europe and South Africa, appearing in major capital cities. 

In 1934 Balieff created a new ''Chauve-Souris'' production, which proved to be his last theatrical venture.

==Phonograph records==
Several recordings were made of ''Sauve-Chouris'' numbers.

Part of the ''La Chauve-Souris'' revue was recorded by British [[Columbia Graphophone Company]], AX 2717, 2719 - 9220, speed 80 rpm, under the title ''Chauves Souris'':
* Side A: "Round the Hay Wain" 
* Side B: "A Russian [[Barcarole]]" In Russian. With Mmes. Birse &amp; Ershova. Mm. Dedovitch &amp; Shevtchenko. Introduction by Nikita Balieff. With the Vaudeville Theatre Orchestra conducted by S. Kogan.

==Film version==
[[Lee DeForest]] filmed ''[[Parade of the Wooden Soldiers]]'' (to the music ''Die Parade der Zinnsoldaten'' by [[Leon Jessel]]), a popular segment from the stage production performed by Nikita Balieff and ''La Chauve-Souris'', in DeForest's [[Phonofilm]] sound-on film process. 
[[File:Parade of the Wooden Soldiers.pdf|thumb|170px|right|1922 U.S. sheet music of ''[[The Parade of the Wooden Soldiers]]'']]
The short film premiered 15 April 1923 as part of a program of 18 Phonofilms at the Rivoli Theater in New York City, and then in England, Japan, and Australia. The film, shown under the title ''Parade of the Wooden Soldiers'' with two-color [[Technicolor]] sequences, is now in the Maurice Zouary collection of the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/C/ChauveSouris1925.html SilentEra entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parody==
''La Chauve-Souris'' inspired a parody called ''No Sirree!'' (subtitled "An Anonymous Entertainment by the Vicious Circle of the Hotel Algonquin"), written and performed by [[Robert Benchley]] and other members of the [[Algonquin Round Table]] for one night only in April 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

''No Sirree!'' had its genesis at the studio of [[Neysa McMein]], which served as something of a [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] for Round Tablers away from the [[Algonquin Hotel]]. Acts included: "Opening Chorus" featuring [[Alexander Woollcott]], [[John Peter Toohey]], [[George S. Kaufman]], [[Marc Connelly]], [[Franklin P. Adams]], and Benchley, with violinist [[Jascha Heifetz]] providing offstage, off-key accompaniment; "He Who Gets Flapped," a musical number featuring the song "The Everlastin' Ingenue Blues" written by [[Dorothy Parker]] and performed by [[Robert E. Sherwood]] accompanied by "chorus girls" including [[Tallulah Bankhead]], [[Helen Hayes]], [[Ruth Gillmore]], [[Lenore Ulric]], and Mary Brandon; "Zowie, or the Curse of an [[Zoë Akins|Akins]] Heart"; "The Greasy Hag, an [[Eugene O'Neill|O'Neill]] Play in One Act" with Kaufman, Connelly and Woollcott; and "Mr. Whim Passes By - An [[A. A. Milne]] Play."&lt;ref&gt;Altman, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Naked Came the Stranger.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Cover of reissue of ''Naked Came the Stranger'']]
{{Italic title}}
'''''Naked Came the Stranger''''' is a 1969 novel written as a [[literary hoax]] poking fun at the American literary culture of its time. Though credited to "Penelope Ashe," it was in fact written by a group of twenty-four journalists led by ''[[Newsday]]'' columnist [[Mike McGrady]].&lt;ref name="TRR-20170405"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=‘Naked Came the Stranger’ (1975): The Hoax, The Film |url=http://www.therialtoreport.com/2017/04/05/naked-came-the-stranger-2/ |date=April 5, 2017 |work=[[The Rialto Report]] |accessdate=April 5, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McGrady's intention was to write a book that was both deliberately terrible and contained a lot of descriptions of sex, to illustrate the point that popular American literary culture had become mindlessly vulgar. The book fulfilled the authors' expectations and became a [[bestseller]] in 1969; they revealed the hoax later that year, further spurring the book's popularity.&lt;ref name="McGradyobit"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Margalit|title=Mike McGrady, Known for a Literary Hoax, Dies at 78|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/15/business/media/mike-mcgrady-known-for-a-literary-hoax-dies-at-78.html|accessdate=18 September 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 15, 2012|page=B12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hoax==
Mike McGrady was convinced that popular American literary culture had become so base&amp;mdash;with the best-seller lists dominated by the likes of [[Harold Robbins]] and [[Jacqueline Susann]]&amp;mdash;that any book could succeed if enough sex was thrown in. To test his theory, in 1966 McGrady recruited a team of ''Newsday'' colleagues (according to Andreas Schroder,&lt;ref&gt;Schroder, Andreas. ''Cheats, Charlatans, and Chicanery'' McClelland &amp; Stewart, Toronto, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; nineteen men and five women) to collaborate on a sexually explicit novel with no literary or social value whatsoever.&lt;ref name="TRR-20170405" /&gt; McGrady co-edited the project with his ''Newsday'' colleague [[Harvey Aronson]], and among the other collaborators were well-known writers including [[1965 Pulitzer Prize]] winner Gene Goltz, [[1970 Pulitzer Prize]] winner [[Robert W. Greene]], and journalist [[Marilyn Berger]].&lt;ref name="Schudel"&gt;Matt Schudel, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-31373689.html "Journalist was ringleader of popular literary spoof"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', May 16, 2012 {{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The group wrote the book as a deliberately inconsistent hodge-podge, with each chapter written by a different author. Some of the chapters had to be heavily edited, because they were originally too well written. The book was submitted for publication under the pseudonym "Penelope Ashe". (She was portrayed by Billie Young, McGrady's own sister-in-law, for photographs and meetings with publishers.)

The publisher, [[Lyle Stuart]], was an independent publisher then known for controversial books, many with sexual content. According to Stuart, he had appropriated the cover photo (a kneeling nude woman with very long hair down her back, photographed from behind) from a Hungarian [[Naturism|nudist]] magazine; the model and photographer later demanded and received payment.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Ramirez, [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/26/arts/26stuart.html "Lyle Stuart, Publisher of Renegade Titles, Dies at 83"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Reed, [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jun/29/guardianobituaries.media "Lyle Stuart: US publisher who challenged the constitution and the boundaries of taste"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', June 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Gillian and William Blake are the hosts of a popular [[New York City]] breakfast radio chat show, ''The Billy &amp; Gilly Show'', where they play the perfect couple.  When Gillian finds out that her husband is having an affair, she decides to cheat on him with a variety of men from their [[Long Island]] neighborhood.  Most of the book is taken up by [[Vignette (literature)|vignettes]] describing Gilly's adventures with a variety of men, from a [[Progressivism|progressive]] [[rabbi]] to a [[mobster]].&lt;ref name="TRR-20170405" /&gt;

==Reception==
The book fulfilled McGrady's cynical expectations, and sales soon reached 20,000 copies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/15/business/media/mike-mcgrady-known-for-a-literary-hoax-dies-at-78.html|title=Mike McGrady, Known for a Literary Hoax, Dies at 78|date=15 May 2012|work=The New York Times|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereupon the co-authors decided to go public, in August 1969. The male authors gave their confession on ''The [[David Frost]] Show'', after being introduced as "Penelope Ashe" and walking out on stage, single file, as the orchestra played the song "[[A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody]]".{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The revelation of the true origins of the book prompted more sales with the book selling approximately 90,000 copies by 13 October 1969.&lt;ref&gt;This figure, with according date, is quoted on the [http://www3.isrl.illinois.edu/~unsworth/courses/bestsellers/search.cgi?title=Naked+Came+the+Stranger 20th-Century American Bestsellers' ''Naked Came the Stranger''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928023016/http://www3.isrl.illinois.edu/~unsworth/courses/bestsellers/search.cgi?title=Naked+Came+the+Stranger |date=2011-09-28 }} page.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the year, the book had spent 13 weeks on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best-Seller List]],&lt;ref name="McGradyobit"/&gt; although by that time its authorship was common knowledge. It is unclear how much of the book's success was due to its content and how much to publicity about its unusual origin. As of May 2012, the book's publisher reported the book had sold 400,000 copies.&lt;ref name="McGradyobit"/&gt;

In 1970, McGrady published ''Stranger Than Naked, or How to Write Dirty Books for Fun and Profit'', which told the story of the hoax.&lt;ref name="TRR-20170405" /&gt;''Naked Came the Stranger'' later became the basis for an [[Naked Came the Stranger (1975 film)|adult film of the same title]] in 1975 directed by [[Radley Metzger]] and starring [[Darby Lloyd Rains]].&lt;ref name="TRR-20170405" /&gt; As reported by ''[[The Washington Post]]'', "Mr. McGrady and the other writers had nothing to do with a [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] 1975 film with the same title. They did, however, see the movie at a [[Times Square]] theater. During one vivid scene, Aronson told ''[[The Charlotte Observer]]'', someone shouted 'Author, Author!' 'Seventeen of us stood up.{{' "}}&lt;ref name="Schudel"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9654">The '''National Society of Arts and Letters''', known as the NSAL, is an American non-profit group founded in 1944 as a [[women's organization]] to assist promising young artists through arts [[competitions]], [[scholarships]] and other [[career]] opportunities.&lt;ref name="NSAL-history"&gt;NSAL, [http://www.arts-nsal.org/history.shtml "The History of NSAL"] (NSAL website, last visited July 16, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara McCormick, [http://www.bocaratontribune.com/national-society-of-arts-and-letters-hosts-afternoon-tea/ "National Society of Arts and Letters Hosts Afternoon Tea"], ''Boca Raton Tribune'', March 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomington-proclamation"&gt;[http://bloomington.in.gov/documents/viewDocument.php?document_id=2719 "National Society of Arts and Letters Day"] (May 13, 2008) - Proclamation by City of Bloomington, Indiana, dated May 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Men were later admitted to the organization, and have been an important and enriching addition.

==National Career Awards Competition==
The National Career Awards Competition, organized by the NSAL is held each year in one of the following categories: visual arts, [[dance]], [[drama]], [[literature]], [[music]] or [[musical theater]]. Participants in the National Career Awards Competition compete at the local chapter level for a series of monetary awards. First-place winners of the Local Chapter Competitions are sent to the NSAL National Competition, which is held each spring during the Society’s annual meeting. Participants in the National Competition compete for a first place award of $15,000, and a series of other awards that can total another $10,000 or more.

The competitions are designed to offer exposure for young artists who want to be heard and seen by professional critics, managers, producers, teachers, the media, and patrons of the arts.

During its history, the competitions organized by the NSAL have benefitted Oscar-winning actress and dancer [[Shirley MacLaine]] and international opera star [[Jessye Norman]] among others. In 1998, non-citizens were permitted full membership privileges, thereby extending a more inviting, inclusive image to the organization.

All competitions are adjudicated by nationally recognized men and women in the arts. A [[master class]] is conducted by judges for the National Career Awards Competitions. Opportunities for one-on-one sessions and individual critiques are also encouraged.

==History==
Begun by a group of civic-minded women who wanted to encourage young talent in the arts, the National Society of Arts and Letters determined from its inception that the best way to accomplish that goal was to sponsor competitions and offer scholarships in the categories of art, music and literature.&lt;ref name="NSAL-history" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dance.uiuc.edu/events/national-society-of-arts-and-letters "National Society of Arts and Letters"], "Events" (Announcements), University of Illinois Dept. of Dance (last visited July 15, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 21, 1944, they met at the home of the future first National President, Mollie Davis Nicholson, to found a group that specified it was non-partisan, non-political and non-profit-making. The [[Chevy Chase]], [[Maryland]] Chapter was organized that year and became the Washington, D.C. Chapter on March 31, 1945, with Dorothy Nicholson Bates Stabell as its first president and founder.

A second chapter, the [[Chicago]] Chapter, was started by Francesca Falk Miller Nielsen, also in October 1944. In 1945, both chapters awarded scholarships: one in piano, three in voice (Washington) and one in pipe organ (Chicago).

On June 30, 1945, the first national conference of the National Society of Arts and Letters was held in Chicago. By this time, eight chapters had been formed: [[Washington, D.C.]], Chicago, [[Florida]], [[Colorado]], [[North Dakota]], [[California]], [[Texas]] and [[Kentucky]]. The bylaws provided membership to women qualified in the arts who were U.S. citizens. Artist member Emma W. Slack designed the insignia. Young artists were to be encouraged by receipt of donor gifts, chapter prizes, scholarships and exhibitions of their work or talent arranged by a chapter.

By 1946 four more chapters had started: [[Arkansas]], [[Indiana]], [[Ohio]] and [[New Jersey]]. A convention was held in Washington, D.C., between April 15–16 of that year, at the [[Mayflower Hotel]] in Washington, D.C. [[First Lady of the United States|American First Lady]] [[Bess Truman]], initiated the festivities with a reception at the [[White House]].&lt;ref name="NSAL-history" /&gt;

As growth continued, Francesca Falk Miller Nielsen, the second National President, introduced and edited the newsletter. It was planned to issue it three times a year. A [[Certificate of Incorporation]], was issued July 29, 1949 and [[tax-exempt status]], was recorded November 7, 1949. By 1949 both dance and drama categories had been added to the competitions. By 1951, 25 chapters had been started.

In October 1994 members gathered together for a gala celebration of the Societies' 50th anniversary. The Central [[Illinois]] Chapter hosted the 60th Anniversary celebration in 2005 with performances by former contestants from 1959-2002. There was also a video featuring Dorothy Nicholson Stabell, daughter of one of the founders.

Today there are 20 NSAL Chapters in 17 states.

==Master classes==
Part of the National competitions are the master classes conducted by judges in each art category. One-on-one sessions are also offered and encouraging critiques of each contestant are provided by the judges.

The National Society of Arts and Letters classifies the arts into six different categories: Art, Dance, Drama, Literature, Music and Musical Theatre; various sub-categories exist within each category. The annual National Competitions rotate among these six categories with the particular sub-category selected by the membership.

Master classes have been conducted in all the arts categories beginning in 2000. They have been conducted for NSAL by their judges and guest teachers including:
* Larry Leichman (co-owner of [[Arbor Books]]), literature
* Joel Revzen, [[Nathan Gunn]] and Gayletha Nichols, singing
* Robert and Louise McCall, art
* Brian Palmer, assistant professor of dance and Chair of the Division of Theatre and Dance at [[Jacksonville University]], dance
* [[Terence Knapp]], acting and theater
* Mark Hoebee, Associate Director of [[Paper Mill Playhouse]], theater
* [[George Pinney]] co-creator of Blast!
* Jane Alderman
* Karen Azenberg, [[choreographer]], dance
* Marek Cholewa, dance
* [[Lucine Amara]] of the [[Metropolitan Opera]], music
* Sarah Caldwell [[Dramatic Soprano]], Maestra, opera
* Alfonso Montecino, concert pianist, music
* Lori Belilove, [[modern dance]]
* Cynthia Bringle, pottery
* Professor [[Josip Novakovich]], writing.

==Awards==
Since the first national competition in 1951, NSAL has presented more than 4,000 awards to young artists. Chapter competitions are usually held in various artistic categories including the one special category specified for the National Competition for that year; only the first-place winners from the chapter competitions in this category advance to the National Competition.

Early on in the history of NSAL, the Nicholson/Nielsen Trust Fund was established to provide permanent support for awards to be given annually to ranking finalists in the National Career Award Competition. The principal of the Fund remains intact while the income is used to provide awards each year in one of the six rotating art categories which NSAL highlights in its National Competition.

Individuals and corporations may also endow a named award by contributing to the Fund. Current awards available from tax-exempt gifts to this Fund totaling $10,000 or more include:

NSAL First Place Award of $10,000 or more is in memory of Mollie Davis Nicholson and Francesca Falk Miller Nielson, founders of the Society. The Estelle Campbell Award is presented to the second-place winner. The Mary Peery Fife Memorial Award is given in the category of Dance. The Catherine A. M. Cavanaugh Award is given in the Literature Category. Other awards include the Dorothy and Bruce Strong Award and the Mollie Davis Nicholson Award

A second important activity of NSAL is the annual Winston Scholarship Program for visual artists and vocalists. Each year, scholarships totaling $18,000 - $20,000 are awarded to artists in these fields who are sixteen to twenty-two years of age. Supported by an endowment from Shirley Rabb Winston, these scholarships are used for special study in the recipient’s field.

Notable recipients of NSAL awards have included [[Malcolm Frager]] (pianist),&lt;ref name="bloomington-proclamation" /&gt; [[Shirley MacLaine]] (actor),&lt;ref name="NSAL-history" /&gt; [[Jessye Norman]] (opera singer; winner of a NSAL contest),&lt;ref name="NSAL-history" /&gt; [[Menahem Pressler]] (Gold Medal of Merit from the National Society of Arts and Letters),&lt;ref&gt;[http://menahempressler.org/?page_id=381 MenahemPressler.org], last visited 2012/07/16.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Balanchine]] (1980 Gold Medal of Merit recipient&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sab.org/school/history/balanchine_biography.php Balanchine Biography], School of American Ballet at Lincoln Center] (last visited July 16, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NPS''' ('''Nederlandse Programma Stichting''') (English: '''Dutch Programme Foundation''') was a Dutch government-funded radio and TV broadcasting foundation.

In the [[Dutch public broadcasting system]], broadcasters – in the Dutch context, listener and viewer associations – do not have their own stations but are allotted time on the three public television and eight public radio networks broadly in relation to the size of their respective memberships. The NPS, however, does not have any members. It was created on April 28, 1994, following a split-up of the responsibilities of the [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting]] (NOS). The NPS took over the NOS's culture, information, minorities and youth programming, allowing the NOS to concentrate on its role of providing impartial news coverage. On September 1, 2010, the NPS merged with [[Teleac (broadcaster)|Teleac]] and [[Radio Volks Universiteit|RVU]] into [[Omroep NTR|NTR]].

==Proposed abolition==
In the summer of 2005, [[Balkenende II|Jan Peter Balkenende's second cabinet]] presented plans to renovate the broadcasting system, including abolition of the NPS by 2007. The proposal was met with fierce resistance from many viewers and listeners, given the dedicated and fairly sizeable audience for the NPS's output. The idea was that other broadcasters would take over the type of programming that the NPS had previously provided. 

There was little confidence among viewers, however, that this would actually happen. It was speculated at the time that the real motive for the proposed abolition was that the governing parties (Christian Democrat and liberal conservative) saw the foundation's output as being too [[left wing|left-wing]]. The plans were in the end withdrawn following the elections of November 2006.

Octane is the Decepticons' fueler, in charge of storing and distributing [[fuel]] among Decepticons with vehicle modes. He is characterized as a mean-spirited bully, cheater, and liar who takes delight in seeing others suffer. In jet mode, he is said to make other planes (even other Decepticons) crash-land for fun. Being one of the three Decepticon [[Triple Changer]]s, Octane can transform between a robot mode and two other modes: a [[tanker truck]] and a [[Boeing 767]] [[fixed-wing aircraft|jet]]. After losing the rights to the original trademark many years after his introduction, Hasbro assigned the name '''[[Tankor]]''' to the character. He uses a rifle and tailfin-shield as weapons.

===Animated series===
In the original Generation 1 cartoon, Octane only appeared in the third season. It is implied, however, that he existed in the Decepticon ranks during and even prior to ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'', though he is not seen in the feature. Octane first appears in "Five Faces of Darkness Pt. 1" where it is presumed that he is among the Decepticons exiled from Cybertron during the movie. His eventual alliance with [[Starscream]], in which the two refer to each other as old friends, further implies Octane's status as having originally served under [[Megatron]].

In the episode "Thief in the Night", Octane deserted the Decepticons and fled to the Socialist Democratic Federated Republic of Carbombya and there he discovered [[Trypticon]]. The city-sized Decepticon had been knocked into the ocean after his last battle with [[Metroplex (Transformers)|Metroplex]]. Repairing him, Octane used Trypticon as a bargaining chip, securing enough oil to convert to energon for himself, attacking Carbombya's enemies in return. When Trypticon's energon consumption spiraled out of control, Octane was forced to blow his cover by sending him to steal various world monuments to pacify Carbombya's dictator. This alerted Autobot leader [[Rodimus Prime]], who was able to foil his scheme. Even more worryingly for Octane, it attracted the attention of his former leader [[Galvatron]], who put a price on his head for his treachery.

During his desertion, Octane collaborated with the Autobot Triple Changer [[Sandstorm (Transformers)|Sandstorm]] to avoid getting captured. The two unlikely allies would end up dodging both Galvatron's troops and hired [[bounty hunter]]s on Octane's trail. Sandstorm would help him escape to [[Cybertron]].

His respite did not last long. In the episode "Starscream's Ghost", Octane fled into the Decepticon crypt, followed by [[Cyclonus]], [[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]] and the [[Sweeps (Transformers)|Sweeps]]. About to be caught and executed, the Triple Changer received help from an unlikely source — the [[vengeful ghost]] of [[Starscream]], who had been killed by Galvatron in ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]''. Possessing Cyclonus, Starscream allowed Octane to escape, and the two formed a scheme to eliminate Galvatron by tricking and abandoning him alone with [[Rodimus Prime]], [[Ultra Magnus]] and several other Autobots. The scheme failed, as Galvatron successfully fought his way out of the trap and sent the duo fleeing once more. Octane does not appear in the follow-up episode also featuring the ghost of Starscream, "Ghost in the Machine." He does make a background appearance in "The Ultimate Weapon," but this may be an animation error ([[Blitzwing]] also makes an appearance in this episode, and both Decepticons had been exiled from the ranks by Galvatron for their treachery).

According to officials who worked on the series, the storylines spotlighting Octane in the end of season three were originally written for Blitzwing. It was Blitzwing who was estranged from the Decepticons at the beginning of the third season, and Octane getting stuck in mid-transformation when meeting Starscream would have been more appropriate for Blitzwing, who is known to suffer from this problem. [[Hasbro]] requested that Octane be substituted for Blitzwing in the story because Octane was a newer toy that they wanted to promote. Later in the U.S. cartoon series, Octane became an Autobot, but he is seen to be a Decepticon again in the [[Transformers: The Headmasters|Headmasters]] series.

===Comics===

====Marvel Comics====
In the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] U.S. Generation 1 series, Octane debuted along with Astrotrain and Blitzwing, serving as workers in [[Ratbat]]'s new "[[Wash'n'Roll]]" project. Unfortunately, the [[starship|spaceship]] that had brought the parts of Wash'n'Roll from [[Cybertron]] to [[Earth]] was infected by [[Scraplets]]. The infection spread to the Triple Changers and almost killed them, but [[Throttlebots|Goldbug]] and his human friend [[Charlie Fong]] saved them along with the infected Autobots.

After participating in the attack on the Autobots to recover captive Decepticons, Octane was amongst those Decepticons on the front-line of offensive against invaders believed to be the Autobots in the [[Arctic]] (in reality it was [[Scorponok]]'s faction of Decepticons) and was present during the meeting between Ratbat and Scorponok. Octane was responsible for being the Decepticon that informed Ratbat, that Scorponok's troops were attacking their base caused by the secret of the [[Underbase]] being revealed in error. As he rushed into battle with the rest of his fellow warriors, Octane was seen to be attacking the [[Terrorcon]] [[Rippersnapper]]. After the battle, Octane was amongst those Decepticons carrying their fallen comrades back to the base to be repaired he was pushing the remains of [[Predacons|Tantrum]] within a wheeled [[cart|trolley]]. Then after the Autobots had attacked, he deactivated [[Mirage (Transformers)|Mirage]]. Later, once the Underbase-powered Starscream had begun attacking the cities of Earth, Octane was deactivated by Starscream and was not seen again in the rest of the comics run. He did put in a further appearance in an alternate universe as part of [[Galvatron]]'s forces in a nightmare alternate universe where Unicron had destroyed Cybertron, and Galvatron and the Decepticons ruled Earth.

Although not explicitly identified as Octane, a dead Transformer with a similar appearance appears in issue 10 of the [[Transformers: Generation 2 (comic)|Transformers: Generation 2]] series amidst a pile of Decepticon corpses on the [[Warworld (Transformers)|Warworld]] following a raid by a boarding party of [[Transformers: Generation 2 (comics)|Jhiaxus]]'s troops, led by Starscream.

Octane's first appearance in the Marvel U.K. comic was in the ''Target 2006'' story arc.  He, along with the other Triple Changers, the three [[Insecticons]], and [[Dirge (Transformers)|Dirge]], [[Thrust (Transformers)|Thrust]], [[Ramjet (Transformers)|Ramjet]] and [[Macabre (Transformers)|Macabre]], are the Decepticons' most feared killers and have to be taken out before a major Autobot uprising can take place. Megatron inadvertently scuppered the plan by summoning the Insecticons to Earth.

Octane also appeared in issue #99, where he was a guard for [[Straxus]], who had been reduced to a disembodied head after his battle with [[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]]. Things changed when a teleportation mishap delivered both [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] and [[Optimus Prime]] to Cybertron. Megatron quickly linked up with Straxus, and sent Octane to hunt down the escaped Prime while spreading misinformation that he was a failed Decepticon spy. When the [[Wreckers (Transformers)|Wreckers]] realized that it was the real Prime and teamed up with him, Octane delivered this news to Megatron and Straxus, exaggerating his own role in the events to curry favor with the Decepticon leaders.

He appeared again much later in the story "Maneuvers." Octane was tired of constant work, stealing fuel for the Decepticons and wanted to have some fun by himself. To amuse himself, he chased the Autobot [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]] for miles who led Octane into a U.S. Army testing range, knowing full well he was full of fuel and would explode if hit. Octane called for help from his fellow Triple Changers, Blitzwing and Astrotrain, who managed to protect Octane for a while but were getting damaged themselves because of it. A forced confession from the terrified Octane to Blitzwing led to him and Astrotrain leaving Octane alone to deal with the Army. It is unclear whether this story is supposed to be set in the period where [[Ratbat]] was leading the Decepticons or the ''Earthforce'' stories surrounding it.

====Devil's Due Publishing====
In the third crossover between [[G.I. Joe]] and the Transformers from [[Devil's Due Publishing]], Octane appeared as part of the Decepticon air attack on the Autobot Capital City, led by [[Sixshot]], but was driven off by [[Omega Supreme]]. He was one of the Decepticons that tried to stop Optimus Prime from attacking [[Serpentor]], but was punched out by the Autobot leader.

====Dreamwave Productions====
The Triple Changers would appear again in Dreamwave's reinterpretation of the Generation One universe — this time with a greatly expanded origin. Octane originally appeared as part of [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]]'s assault force attacking Iacon, and would later join [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]]'s Predacon faction during the period following the disappearance of Megatron.

During the civil war on Cybertron, Shockwave envisioned a Transformer with multiple alternate modes, studying Astrotrain and Blitzwing. However, the Great Shutdown meant his plans could go no further — until [[Unicron]]'s servant [[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]] located Cybertron and reactivated Shockwave for study.  Shockwave was attacked by [[Sharkticon]]s, Scourge saved his life, only to be shot in the back by Shockwave. Shockwave then proceeded to examine and study Scourge, using the secrets gleaned to create first the [[Duocons]] and then the Triple Changers — Astrotrain, Blitzwing, Octane and at least two others — appearing to be the Autobots [[Sandstorm (Transformers)|Sandstorm]] and Broadside.  In the ''[[Micromasters]]'' mini-series by Dreamwave, Blitzwing and Astrotrain are suffering from severe physical changes. As this is before the Great Shutdown this might imply that the change was a natural one rather than a result of experiments.

The Triple-Changers later served as Shockwave's bodyguards, accompanying him to Earth to capture [[Optimus Prime]] and Megatron's troops. However, with the Earthbound Transformers captive, things began to go wrong. [[Grimlock]] had escaped and was intent on reactivating his fellow [[Dinobots]]. Shockwave sent Octane to investigate, but the Dinobots jumped him, beheaded him and stole his shuttle.

====Fun Publications====
''Classicverse'' Octane appears among [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]]'s troops in the story ''At Fight's End'' by [[Fun Publications]]. Although depicted as the new "Tankor" toy, he retains the Octane name in the story.

''Wings of Honor'' Octane appears in the Botcon 2013 story ''Machine Wars: Termination''. In this story he has his ''Universe'' Tankor body, but is still called Octane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.botcon.com/BotCon2013/bc13comic.cfm|title=The Transformers Collectors' Convention - BotCon 2013!|website=www.botcon.com|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====IDW Publishing====
After the Transformers license passed to [[IDW Publishing]], Octane appeared as one of the Decepticons under [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]]'s command in the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] ''[[The Transformers: Evolutions|Evolutions]]'' tale "Hearts of Steel". He was seen quizzing Tobias Muldoon about the possibilities of flight. He did not appear after this, but he was most likely destroyed when [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] and [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] diverted the Decepticon train convoy into a chasm.

He made his first appearance in the main G1 IDW continuity in issue #2 of ''[[The Transformers: Megatron Origin]]'', where a series of video broadcasts showing underground gladiator battles (being watched by [[Ratbat]]) showed him battling alongside [[Slag (Transformers)|Slag]] and [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] himself.

In the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] television series ''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2001 TV series)|Transformers: Robots in Disguise]]'', '''Mega-Octane''' is portrayed as the cool, calculating leader of the Commandos. He is cruel and unfair, and uses his four subordinates as if they were his own limbs - he expects them to carry out his orders without question, and he has no tolerance with delays or mistakes. He is somewhat envious of Scourge, who snatched leadership of the Commandos directly from him. In missile trailer mode, Mega-Octane can launch missiles with a range of {{convert|65|mi|km}}. In robot mode, he carries a laser rifle. He can also transform into a combat station and perform maintenance on his teammates. He forms the torso and head of [[Ruination (Transformers)|Ruination]].

===Animated series===
Mega-Octane was one of five Transformers that actually began life as Autobots, sent to Earth along with a sixth to lead them in a mission to reactivate the legendary Autobot battle station known as [[Fortress Maximus#Robots in Disguise|Fortress Maximus]]. However, their craft malfunctioned and crashed, and the six Autobots were entombed in [[Spark (Transformers)|protoform]] state, joining Fortress Maximus in slumber until their ship was unearthed by [[Megatron (Robots in Disguise)|Megatron]] and his [[Predacon (Transformers)|Predacons]]. Absconding with the Autobot protoforms right under [[Optimus Prime (Robots in Disguise)|Optimus Prime]]'s nose, Megatron took them to a nearby military base, intending to scan alternate modes for them. Mega-Octane was the first to be reactivated, infused with a portion of Megatron's own spark energy to create the first of a new breed of Transformer that Megatron dubbed the "Decepticons." The other four members of the team followed, and eventually the sixth, [[Scourge (Transformers)#Robots in Disguise|Scourge]], who took leadership of the team from Mega-Octane with a show of force.

Simply referred to as the '''Commandos''', they soon demonstrated their skills by blowing up dams across the country, debuting their combining abilities against Rail Racer and later attempting to harness the energies of a volcano on Montrose Island. As part of a string of failed attempts to locate the Autobots' hidden base, Movor was launched into orbit to track Side Burn from space, and the Decepticons then pretended to have reverted to their original Autobot selves in an effort to make the Autobots take them in. Later, Decepticon corruption of the Autobots' global spacebridge led Ruination into conflict with Landfill.

It soon became apparent that Scourge sought to overthrow Megatron's leadership, and the discovery of Fortress Maximus, buried beneath the Earth's surface accelerated the process as exposure to his energies, and those of the O-Parts - the keys to Maximus's resurrection - awoke memories of Scourge's original mission. His new Decepticon programming turned it on its head, however, as he now wished to command Maximus's power for his own, and soon had the other Decepticons thinking the same way, conspiring with Mega-Octane to get Cerebros, the power key of Fortress Maximus, under his control. As a series of chases to acquire control of Maximus began, Scourge eventually revealed his treachery by trying to have the giant attack Galvatron (Megatron, in a new form), only for the plan to fail. In retribution, Galvatron again brainwashed the Decepticons, turning them back into his loyal servants, who followed him so completely that they were even willing to take his orders after he attempted to kill them as a belated punishment. With Galvatron's defeat, the Decepticons and Predacons were all taken back to Cybertron for imprisonment.

===3H Enterprises===
Mega-Octane would make one further appearance in the [[BotCon]] 2004 voice actor play. Here, he was one of the Decepticons under the command of [[Reptilion]], alongside [[Sunstorm (Transformers)|Sunstorm]] and [[Perceptor]]. He battled [[Silverbolt]], [[Rattrap (Transformers)|Rattrap]] and [[Waspinator]] in order to secure two groups of dimensionally displaced Autobots from the [[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2001 TV series)|RiD]] universe. However, the three groups of Autobots, together with a time-lost Autobot shuttle from the Great War, were able to defeat the Decepticons.

All toys were identical to their individual Japanese releases, but the set only came with a bio card for the combined form.

==Transformers: Cybertron==
According to Hasbro sources some proposed names for ''Cybertron'' Sky Shadow were Octane and Spacewarp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seibertron.com/news/view.php?id=6101&amp;f_cat=&amp;f_year=&amp;f_keyword=spacewarp In and out of package images of the Cybertron Jetfire repaint!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In this incarnation, Octane is renamed '''Fuselage''', a Decepticon from the brick-built world of ''[[Kre-O]]'' who turns into a cargo plane. Fuselage is an homage to the ''Generation 1'' Octane (particularly his [[Boeing 767]] mode). His appearance in the comic is vastly different from that of his later Kreon toy, the comic renders him in a G1-faithful color scheme, sports a [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]] helmet, and uses a Firestrike wing backpack.

In "Treasure Competition! Defeat with Block Power!", Fuselage was seen fleeing in terror along with his fellow Decepticons as [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]] attacked using a giant Mega-Jazz robot.

[[United States]] [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] (March 6, 2007). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; Several hundred women were registered as prostitutes with the National Health Service.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; 

Although illegal, brothels are set up in the more remote areas of [[Chile]] in ports, mining towns, logging areas or anywhere where there are men working away from home.&lt;ref name="escape"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cotton|first1=John|title=Quasi-Legalized Prostitution in Chile|url=http://escapeamericanow.info/legalized-prostitution-in-chile/|website=Escape America Now|accessdate=5 December 2017|date=9 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal situation==
The promotion and facilitation ([[Procuring (prostitution)|procuring]] and advertising) of prostitution is prohibited,&lt;ref name=report/&gt; as well as everything related to those under 18 (although the age of sexual consent for consensual and non-commercial acts for [[heterosexuals]] is 14 years). Until 1998 [[Male prostitution|male homosexual prostitution]] was banned as [[sodomy]] was considered a crime in Article 365 of the Penal Code. 

The same code in articles 373 and 495 sanctions "offences to modesty, morals and good manners", which is been applied to those who perform sexual acts in public of any nature, whether or not there is a commercial purpose. However, prostitution may be an aggravating factor of public order order, depending on the criteria of [[Carabineros]]. However, police often detain prostitutes (usually as a result of complaints by neighbourhood residents) on charges of "offences against morality," which could lead to a 50,000 pesos fine or five days in prison.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; 

The Sanitary Code refers to prostitution in Paragraph II of [[venereal diseases]], which specifically prohibits brothels, but legitimises the existence of prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sernac.cl/wp-content/uploads/leyes/dfl/DFL725_Codigo_Sanitario.pdf Código Sanitario.] Artículo 41. Para las personas que se dedican al comercio sexual, se llevará una estadística sanitaria, no permitiéndose su agrupación en prostíbulos cerrados o casas de tolerancia.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chilean law requires sex workers to register with the Health Registry of the [[Ministry of Health (Chile)|Ministry of Health]] (Minsal), and to undergo periodic medical.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt; The Regulation on [[sexually transmitted infections]] and the Minsal's management and treatment guidelines includes specific sections on sex workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reglamento sobre infecciones de transmisión sexual y las normas de manejo y tratamiento|url=http://juridico1.minsal.cl/DECRETO_206_05.doc|trans-title= Regulation on sexually transmitted infections and the rules of management and treatment"  |publisher=[[Ministry of Health (Chile)]]|accessdate=4 December 2017|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex workers have reported that law is frequently not enforced and there is corruption within the police.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Chile}}
Most [[human trafficking]] victims are women and minors trafficked internally for sexual exploitation.

'''''Radio Days''''' is a 1987 American [[Comedy-drama|comedy-drama film]] written and directed by [[Woody Allen]], who also narrates. The film looks back on an American family's life during the [[Golden Age of Radio]] using both music and memories to tell the story. It stars an [[ensemble cast]].

==Plot==
Joe, the narrator, relates how two burglars got involved in a radio game after picking up the phone. He goes on to explain that he associates old radio songs with childhood memories. 

During the late 1930s and early 1940s young Joe lived in a modest [[Jewish-American]] family in [[Rockaway Beach, Queens|Rockaway Beach]]. His mother always listened to ''Breakfast with Irene and Roger''. His father, who regularly gave him a beating, kept his occupation secret. Joe later found out that he was ashamed of being a taxi driver. Other family members were Uncle Abe and Aunt Ceil, grandpa and grandma, and Aunt Bea. The latter was a serial dater, always on the lookout for a potential husband. 

Joe's own favourite radio show was ''The Masked Avenger''. It made him dream of buying a [[secret decoder ring]]. In Joe's fantasy the Masked Avenger looked like a hero, but in reality the voice actor was short and bald. Other radio memories are stories about sporting heroes, news bulletins about [[World War II]], a report of an extraterrestrial invasion, and a live report of the search for a little girl who fell into a well.

With his friends from school Joe was searching for German aircraft, but instead they saw a woman undressing in her bedroom. She later turned out to be their substitute teacher. Alone on the coast Joe saw a German [[U-boat]], but he decided not to tell anyone because they wouldn't believe him.

Joe was fascinated by the glitz and glamour of [[Manhattan]], where the radio broadcasts were made. He visited the [[Radio City Music Hall]], and described it as the most beautiful thing he ever saw. 

Joe collected stories of radio stars, including that of Sally White, whose dreams of becoming famous were hampered by her bad voice and accent. Starting as a cigar salesgirl she got stuck on the roof of the radio building with Roger, who was cheating on Irene. After she witnessed a crime the gangster Rocco wanted to kill her, but following his mother's advice he ended up using his connections to further her career. She finally became a reporter of celebrity gossip.

On New Year's Eve Joe was brought down from his room to celebrate the transition to 1944. Simultaneously the radio stars gathered on the roof of their building. The narrator concludes that he will never forget those radio voices, although with each passing of a New Year's Eve they seem to grow dimmer and dimmer.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
''Radio Days'' currently holds a "Fresh" 88% positive rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with an average score of 7.9/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|radio_days|Radio Days}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his four-star review, noted critic [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' described ''Radio Days'' as Allen’s answer to [[Federico Fellini]]’s ''[[Amarcord]]'' and referred to it as "so ambitious and so audacious that it almost defies description. It's a kaleidoscope of dozens of characters, settings and scenes - the most elaborate production Allen has ever made - and it's inexhaustible, spinning out one delight after another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/radio-days-1987 | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | title=Radio Days | date=January 30, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' referred to Allen as the "prodigal cinema resource" and spoke of the film saying, "''Radio Days'' [...] is as free in form as it is generous of spirit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |title=Woody Allen's Fond Remembrances Of 'Radio Days' |work=The New York Times |publisher= |date=January 30, 1987 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B0DE0D81E31F933A05752C0A961948260 |accessdate=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Denby]] wrote for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' that: "[...] The real glue, however, is the lullingly beautiful popular music of the period — [[Cole Porter]], [[Al Dubin|Dubin]] and [[Harry Warren|Warren]], big-band jazz, crooners, torch singers, [[Carmen Miranda]]. The music, perfectly matched to images of old wood and brick buildings and old glamour spots, produces a mood of distanced, bittersweet nostalgia. ''Radio Days'' becomes a gently satiric commemorations of forgotten lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Denby |first=David |authorlink=David Denby|title=Woody Allen's nostalgic Radio Days is exquisitely crafted, but the picture is suffused with mediocrity|work=[[New York Magazine]] |publisher= |date=February 9, 1987 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J-UCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=radio+days+carmen+miranda&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kF8HVML_BrjLsQTjwYHgDA&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=radio%20days%20carmen%20miranda&amp;f=false|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a poll held by ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine of the 500 greatest films ever made, ''Radio Days'' was voted number 304.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/500/38.asp|title=Empire Features|work=empireonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his brother-in-law [[Jan Harlan]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] loved ''Radio Days'' so much that he watched it "twice within two days, because 'it was like watching a home movie,' he told me... He absolutely adored it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAeZhRwZwRM&amp;index=24&amp;list=LL_GZCLYe6eEKgQ2rDxT1DVw | work=[[YouTube]] | publisher=Blueprint Cinema | title=The Life and Legend of Stanley Kubrick: A Panel | date=July 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''"Repertory" redirects here. For the set of works one is ready to perform or are typically performed, see [[repertoire]].

A '''repertory theatre''' (also called '''repertory,''' '''rep''' or '''stock''') can be a Western [[theatre]] or [[opera]] production in which a resident company presents works from a specified repertoire, usually in alternation or rotation. In the British system, however, it used to be that even quite small towns would support a rep and the resident company would present a different play every week, either a revival from the full range of classics or, if given the chance, a new play, once the rights had been released after a [[West End theatre|West End]] or [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] run. However the companies were not known for trying out untried new work. The methods, now seldom seen, would  be also used in the United States, Canada, and Australia.

==Resident company==

The acting company would usually consist of a leading lady, a leading man, a set of juveniles (one male and one female [[Ingenue (stock character)|ingenue]] for the young often romantic role(s)), a [[character actor]] and actress (for the older or eccentric parts) and perhaps a vain and girlish [[soubrette]].  The company might occasionally bring in a [[guest star]] to increase interest, albeit in exchange for a cost increase often large enough to offset the rise in revenues brought by any increase in attendance.  The resident cast would number seven, plus the resident director, usually serving as the artistic director in charge of the whole enterprise. Additionally there would be the [[stage director]], the [[assistant stage manager]] (ASM), some unpaid apprentices and light and sound technicians. Newcomers to the profession would often start their careers in this fashion and members would gain a foundation upon which to base their future careers. Paid members could also be sure of a steady income for one or more seasons which might last for six months. Examples of performers who went on to universal recognition are [[Errol Flynn]], [[John Gielgud|Sir John Gielgud]], [[Ralph Richardson|Sir Ralph Richardson]], [[Laurence Olivier|Lord Olivier]], [[Jeremy Brett]], [[Judi Dench|Dame Judi Dench]], [[Rosemary Harris]], [[Ian McKellen|Sir Ian McKellen]], [[Peter O'Toole]], [[Christopher Plummer]], [[Harold Pinter]], [[Imelda Staunton]], [[Lynn Redgrave]], [[Arthur Lowe]], [[Vanessa Redgrave]], [[Patrick Stewart|Sir Patrick Stewart]], [[Geraldine McEwan]] and [[Ronnie Barker]]. [[Dirk Bogarde]] wrote about his start at tiny [[Amersham]] rep in 1939, and [[Michael Caine|Sir Michael Caine]] recounts his time spent at [[Horsham]] rep in the early fifties.

==Weekly rehearsal schedule==
For weekly rep and for a typical 3-act play, the actors' week would start on Tuesday and go as follows: Tuesday: notes on last night's opening from the director, then a sit-down read-through of the next play with some discussion by the [[Theatre director|director]], on-the-feet [[Blocking (stage)|blocking]] of the moves for Act I with a few questions from the actors and there are performances of last week's play each night. Wednesday: run Act I and start to block Act II, but break early because there's a [[wikt:matinée|matinée]]. Thursday: finish blocking Act II, run Act II and block Act III. Friday: run Act III, run through of entire play, no scripts in hand and technicals – meaning lights and sound – to watch and write down cues. Saturday: run through again, stop and go to test lighting and sound cues, costumes may be used if ready. Two shows today, the evening one closing the current play. After the show, the set is struck (taken down) by the crew - usually [[apprentice]]s – and the [[stage manager]].

Sunday is an opportunity to brush up on lines and moves and private rehearsals. But for the crew it means putting up the new sets, hanging and focusing lights and setting sound equipment. Monday: morning, run through, usually without costumes (save wear and tear), mainly for the techs. In the afternoon there's a  "Full Perfect" dress [[rehearsal]], maybe a few friends in front to gauge reaction, then copious notes. In the evening, 8 o'clock opening night, followed by notes from the director, visits with friends from the audience and maybe a party nearby. The process starts all over again on Tuesday.

==Audience and management==
From the audience's point of view, local communities would become fans and champion their favourites who would be treated as [[celebrities]]. And sometimes entire families would make a visit to their local rep as part of the weekly routine like going to church, and for the young ones, it became a part of their future appreciation for live "legitimate" theatre.

During the forties, fifties and sixties, two impresarios dominated the field of British rep, mostly in the North.  They were Harry Hanson and his Court players, and Frank H. Fortescue's Famous Players, with [[Arthur Brough]] in Folkestone for the South. Their system was the toughest of all, for if you joined one of their companies, it could mean "twice-nightly" shows, and a new play to learn every week. Rosemary Harris tells of her 50 consecutive weeks of doing just that at [[Bedford]] rep. It cannot happen any more, due to the restrictions of [[Equity (trade union)|British Equity]] which came to mandate just 8 shows a week, including perhaps two matinées. Fortescue, who died in 1957, was known to be a strict and upright man. When ''Pygmalion'' was playing at one of his theatres, because Eliza says "''Not bloody likely!"'',  "FOR ADULTS ONLY!" would be posted in the [[Front of House|front of house]]. Or perhaps he was afraid of the [[Lord Chamberlain]], Her Majesty's official [[Censorship|censor]] whose duties were abolished in 1968.

==Today's practice==
Not to be overlooked is a form of touring repertory theatre known as "bus and truck", which involves transporting the actors and sets for about five different plays which can be performed in smaller communities on consecutive nights.

In [[Russia]] and much of [[Eastern Europe]] repertory theatre is based on the idea that each company maintains a number of productions which are performed on a rotating basis. Each production’s life span is determined by its success with the audience. However, many productions remain in repertory for years as this approach presents each piece a few times in a given season, not enough to exhaust the potential audience pool. After the fall of the Soviet regime and the substantial diminution of government subsidy, the repertory practice has required re-examination. [[Moscow Art Theatre]] and [[Lev Dodin]]’s Maly Drama Theatre of [[St. Petersburg]] are the world’s most notable practitioners of this approach.

In [[D-A-CH|German-speaking]] countries, most opera companies function in a similar way, too.

===UK===
Today in the UK, the practice of "rep" is more likely to be seen in large cities in the manner applied by such well-known established companies as [[Birmingham Rep]] in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] of England which states in its programmes: "''"The REP" presents a season with each play generally having an unbroken run of between three and six weeks. This is the form of repertory theatre that the majority of theatres like The REP — which are also called producing theatres — now follow.''"  Actors have the luxury of at least 3 weeks of rehearsal, and audiences see better shows.  Repertory can still be found in the UK in a variation of guises; in [[Sidmouth]] (12 plays), [[Wolverhampton]] (8 plays), [[Burslem]] and [[Taunton]] (4 each). The [[Sheringham Little Theatre]] produces an in-house repertory season each summer, running from June until September. Weekly Repertory theatre is also produced by the Summer Theatre season at [[Frinton-on-Sea]]. This season has been running for seventy seven seasons now, and until recently maintained its links with the oldest traditions of British commercial theatre by being run by the actor [[Jack Watling]], his son Giles and his son-in-law [[Seymour Matthews]]. In 2004 it was taken over by Edward Max, who ran it alone until 2012. For the next two years it was run by mtp Ltd. Now Clive Brill is the producer, working with Edward as General Manager. The recent 75th anniversary season was marked with a stage appearance by Richard Wilson, who has since become the Patron of the Friends of Frinton Theatre. 
Frinton saw the early launch of actors such as [[Michael Denison]], [[Vanessa Redgrave]], [[David Suchet]], [[Jack Klaff]], [[Neil Dudgeon]], [[Owen Teale]] and [[Lynda Bellingham]]. Theatre practices like this remain popular within theatre communities and continue to give first jobs to graduating drama students.
The Company season at the [http://www.everymanplayhouse.com/content/resident-acting-company-at-the-everyman-2017 Liverpool Everyman] will launch in January 2017 and run until July, with 14 actors performing a season of five shows.

===United States===

In the United States, the repertory system has also found a base to compete with commercial theatre.  Repertory theatre with mostly changing casts and longer running plays, perhaps better classed as "provincial" or "non-profit" theatre, has made a big come-back, in cities such as [[Little Rock, AR]], [[Washington, DC]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Indianapolis]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Chicago]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Nashville]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Houston]], [[Boston]], [[San Francisco]], [[San Diego]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Kansas City]], and [[Seattle]].  [[Theatre festival|Festival theatre]] now provides actors with work in the summer.

America's oldest resident repertory theatre, [[Hedgerow Theatre]], is located in Rose Valley, Pennsylvania. It was founded by actor Jasper Deeter in 1923. The present Producing Artistic Director is actress and director Penelope Reed. Other notable repertory theatres include the [[Guthrie Theater|Guthrie Theatre]], which was set up as regional repertory theatre concept that is free from commercial constraints in the choice of repertoire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Continuum Companion to Twentieth Century Theatre|last=Chambers|first=Colin|publisher=Continuum|year=2002|isbn=9781847140012|location=London|pages=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is aligned in objectives to the repertory and resident theatre movement that emerged in the United States in the 1960s. This sought to establish an alternative and decentralized theater network outside of New York, one with [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit-making]] status and focused instead on the art of the theatre as well as the development of artists, craftsmen, and administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Paperback Guide to Theatre|last=Stanton|first=Sarah|last2=Banham|first2=Martin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1996|isbn=0521446546|location=Cambridge|pages=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publicly-funded theatres that belong to this type have been receiving erratic support since the 1980s.

The [[Association of Producing Artists]] (APA) was one of the most successful repertory theatres in the United States, touring for four years and holding residencies in several cities before finally joining the [[Phoenix Theatre (New York City)|Phoenix Theatre]] in New York, where it was known for staging plays with modest prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge History of American Theatre|last=Wilmeth|first=Don|last2=Bigsby|first2=Christopher | author2link = Christopher Bigsby|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1998|isbn=0521651794|location=Cambridge|pages=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presently, the [[American Repertory Theatre]] is considered one of the most distinguished repertory theatres in the United States. Since its foundation in 1979, it has earned several awards including a [[Pulitzer Prize]] (1982), a [[Tony Award]] (1986), and a [[Jujamcyn Award]] (1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/26/theater/jujamcyn-award-to-american-repertory-theater.html|title=JUJAMCYN AWARD TO AMERICAN REPERTORY THEATER|last=Mitgang|first=Herbert|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
The crowning achievement of repertory theatres in Canada are the world-renowned [[Stratford Shakespeare Festival]], founded in 1953 to primarily present productions of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays and the [[Shaw Festival]], founded in 1962, which presents plays written or set during the lifetime of [[George Bernard Shaw]] or following Shaw's ideal of socially provactive theatre.

The Vagabond Repertory Theatre Company was formed in March 2009 by artistic directors Nathaniel Fried and Ryan LaPlante, and currently resides and performs in Kingston, Ontario. But the old English-style repertory theatres such as Ottawa's CRT (Canadian Repertory Theatre), and Toronto's Crest Theatre no longer exist. Although they did have a version of [[summer stock theatre|summer theatre]] in smaller holiday districts, such as the "Straw Hat" players of Gravenhurst and Port Carling at [[Ontario]]'s vacation  [[Muskoka Lakes, Ontario|Muskoka Lakes]] area.

==Pros and cons==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2011}}
Among the benefits of such a system are increased variety and better quality, due to fresh actors and shopped in directors. The theatre can afford to take risks, and a show that is likely to attract a large audience will effectively subsidize a show that is less likely, especially if season tickets are sold.

Drawbacks to the repertoire system are increased production costs as each show will need separate sets, props, costumes and actors, (although sometimes an actor will be engaged to play in more than one production). Many such companies are large, and are able to have a smaller space available to [[workshop]] an experimental production or present playreadings. But the standard should be higher than under the old-time repertory system, because there will be more time for rehearsal. Also many repertoire companies today have [[non-profit]] status, so that budgets and income should be higher because they will not just depend upon ticket sales. However, the downside is that promotional costs will also be much higher due to having to employ a separate staff.

In April 2017, [[Glenda Jackson]] blamed the increase in TV viewers being unable to understand what actors are saying on the decline of the repertory system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Rainbird | first = Ashleigh | title = Oscar winner Glenda Jackson says BBC's 'mumblegate' is result of young actors' missing out on stage work | newspaper = [[Daily Mirror]] | date = 2017-04-07 | url = https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/oscar-winning-actress-glenda-jackson-10180749 | access-date = 2017-04-08 | quote = “Clearly for young, up and coming actors there is far less opportunity to them to work on the stage because the old rep system has been gone for decades,” Glenda explains.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42864">{{for|the economic concept|Risk aversion}}
'''Risk aversion''' is a preference for a sure outcome over a gamble with higher or equal expected value. Conversely, the rejection of a sure thing in favor of a gamble of lower or equal expected value is known as [[risk-seeking]] behavior.&lt;ref name="KT 1984"&gt;{{cite journal |journal= American Psychologist| year=1984 |volume=39 | issue=4 |pages=341–350|title= Choices, values, and frames |author=Kahneman, D., &amp; Tverksy, A. |pmid= |doi= 10.1037/0003-066X.39.4.341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[psychophysics]] of chance induce overweighting of sure things and of improbable events, relative to events of moderate probability.&lt;ref name="KT 1984" /&gt; Underweighting of moderate and high probabilities relative to sure things contributes to risk aversion in the realm of gains by reducing the attractiveness of positive gambles.&lt;ref name="KT 1984" /&gt; The same effect also contributes to risk seeking in losses by attenuating the aversiveness of negative gambles.&lt;ref name="KT 1984" /&gt; Low probabilities, however, are overweighted, which reverses the pattern described above: low probabilities enhance the value of long-shots and amplify aversion to a small chance of a severe loss.&lt;ref name="KT 1984" /&gt; Consequently, people are often risk seeking in dealing with improbable gains and risk averse in dealing with unlikely losses.&lt;ref name="KT 1984" /&gt;

==Related theories==
Most theoretical analyses of risky choices depict each option as a gamble that can yield various outcomes with different probabilities.&lt;ref name="Rotten"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Psychological Science| year=2001 |volume=12 | issue=3 |pages=185–190|title=Money, Kisses, and Electric Shocks: On the Affective Psychology of Risk|author=Rottenstreich, Y., &amp; Hsee, C.K. |doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00334| pmid=11437299 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Widely accepted risk-aversion theories, including [[Expected utility hypothesis|Expected Utility Theory]] (EUT) and [[Prospect theory|Prospect Theory]] (PT), arrive at risk aversion only indirectly, as a side effect of how outcomes are valued or how probabilities are judged.&lt;ref name="simonsohn"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simonsohn|first1=U.|title=Direct Risk Aversion: Evidence From Risky Prospects Valued Below Their Worst Outcome|journal=Psychological Science|volume=20|issue=6|year=2009|pages=686–692|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02349.x|url=http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~uws/papers/uncertainty_effect_published.pdf|pmid=19422629}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these analyses, a value function indexes the attractiveness of varying outcomes, a weighting function quantifies the impact of probabilities, and value and weight are combined to establish a utility for each course of action.&lt;ref name="Rotten" /&gt; This last step, combining the weight and value in a meaningful way to make a decision, remains sub-optimal in EUT and PT, as people’s psychological assessments of risk do not match objective assessments.

===Expected utility theory===

[[Expected utility hypothesis|Expected Utility Theory]] (EUT) poses a utility calculation linearly combining weights and values of the probabilities associated with various outcomes. By presuming that decision-makers themselves incorporate an accurate weighting of probabilities into calculating expected values for their decision-making, EUT assumes that people’s subjective probability-weighting matches objective probability differences, when they are, in reality, exceedingly disparate.&lt;ref name="Rotten" /&gt;

''Consider the choice between a prospect that offers an 85% chance to win $1000 (with a 15% chance to win nothing) and the alternative of receiving $800 for sure. A large majority of people prefer the sure thing over the gamble, although the gamble has higher (mathematical) expected value (also known as expectation). The expected value of a monetary gamble is a weighted average, in which each possible outcome is weighted by its probability of occurrence. The expected value of the gamble in this example is .85 X $1000 + .15 X $0 = $850, which exceeds the expected value of $800 associated with the sure thing.'' &lt;ref name="KT 1984" /&gt; 
				
Research suggests that people do not evaluate prospects by the expected value of their monetary outcomes, but rather by the expected value of the subjective value of these outcomes (see also [[Expected utility]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Econometrica| year=1954 |volume=22| issue=1 |pages=23–36|title= Exposition of a new theory on the measurement of risk|author=Bernoulli, D.|doi=10.2307/1909829| jstor=1909829 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In most real-life situations, the probabilities associated with each outcome are not specified by the situation, but have to be subjectively estimated by the decision-maker.&lt;ref name="Stan 2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stanovich |first=K. E. |year=2010 |title=Decision Making and Rationality in the Modern World |location=New York |publisher=Oxford |isbn=9780195328127|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subjective value of a gamble is again a weighted average, but now it is the subjective value of each outcome that is weighted by its probability.&lt;ref name="KT 1984" /&gt; To explain risk aversion within this framework, Bernoulli proposed that subjective value, or utility, is a concave function of money. In such a function, the difference between the utilities of $200 and $100, for example, is greater than the utility difference between $1,200 and $1,100. It follows from concavity that the subjective value attached to a gain of $800 is more than 80% of the value of a gain of $1,000.&lt;ref name="KT 1984" /&gt; Consequently, the concavity of the utility function entails a risk averse preference for a sure gain of $800 over an 80% chance to win $1,000, although the two prospects have the same monetary expected value.&lt;ref name="KT 1984" /&gt;

While EUT has dominated the analysis of decision-making under risk and has generally been accepted as a normative model of rational choice (telling us how we ''should'' make decisions), descriptive models of how people actually behave deviate significantly from this normative model.&lt;ref name="Stan 2010" /&gt;

===Prospect theory and gain-loss asymmetry (S-shaped value function)===

Prospect Theory (PT) claims that fair gambles (gambles in which the expected value of the current option and all other alternatives are held equal) are unattractive on the gain side but attractive on the loss side. In contrast to EUT, PT is posited as an alternative theory of choice, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets (total wealth), and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights.&lt;ref name="K&amp;T 1979"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Econometrica| year=1979 |volume=47 | issue=2 |pages=263–291|title=Prospect Theory: An analysis of decision under risk|author=Kahneman, D., &amp; Tverksy, A. |doi=10.2307/1914185| jstor=1914185 | citeseerx=10.1.1.407.1910 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to capture inconsistencies in our preferences, PT offers a non-linear, S-shaped probability-weighted value function, implying that the decision-maker transforms probabilities along a diminishing sensitivity curve, in which the impact of a given change in probability diminishes with its distance from impossibility and certainty.&lt;ref name="KT 1984" /&gt;

The value function shown is: 
[[File:Valuefun.jpg|thumb|Predicted utility curve of prospect theory]]
A. Defined on gains and losses rather than on total wealth.&lt;ref name="KT 1984" /&gt; Prospects are coded as gains and losses from a zero point (e.g. using current wealth, rather than total wealth as a reference point), leading people to be risk averse for gains and risk seeking for losses.&lt;ref name="Stan 2010" /&gt;

B. Concave in the domain of gains (risk aversion) and convex in the domain of losses (risk seeking).&lt;ref name="KT 1984" /&gt; The negatively accelerated nature of the function implies that people are risk averse for gains and risk seeking for losses.&lt;ref name="Stan 2010" /&gt;

C. Considerably steeper for losses than for gains (''see also [[loss aversion]]'').&lt;ref name="KT 1984" /&gt; Steepness of the utility function in the negative direction (for losses over gains) explains why people are risk-averse even for gambles with positive expected values.&lt;ref name="Stan 2010" /&gt;  
				
While risk aversion is not part of PT per se, a pertinent part of PT is gain-loss asymmetry with regard to risk. PT’s S-shaped probability-weighted, non-linear value function deems risk aversion context-dependent, as the gain-loss asymmetry illustrated above, results from our psychological assessments of risk hardly matching objective assessments of risk. One conceivable component of risk aversion in the framework of PT is that the degree of risk aversion apparent will vary depending on where along the curve our decision lies.

''Example: Participants are indifferent between receiving a lottery ticket offering a 1% chance at $200 and receiving $10 for sure. Additionally, people are indifferent between receiving a lottery ticket offering a 99% chance at $200 and receiving $188 for sure.'' &lt;ref name="T&amp;K 1992"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty| year=1992 |volume=5 | issue=4 |pages=297–323| title=Advances in prospect theory: Cumulative representations of uncertainty|author=Tversky, A., &amp; Kahneman, D. |doi=10.1007/bf00122574| citeseerx=10.1.1.320.8769 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with diminishing sensitivity, the first hundredth of probability is worth $10, and the last hundredth is worth $12, but the 98 intermediate hundredths are worth only $178, or about $1.80 per hundredth. PT captures this pattern of differentially weighting (objective) probabilities subjectively with an S-shaped weighting function.&lt;ref name="T&amp;K 1992" /&gt;

==Framing effects==

A framing effect occurs when transparently and objectively identical situations generate dramatically different decisions depending on whether the situations are presented or perceived as either potential losses or gains.&lt;ref name="T&amp;K 1981"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Science| year=1981 |volume=211 |pages=453–458| title=The framing of decisions and the psychology of choice|author=Tversky, A., &amp; Kahneman, D. |doi=10.1126/science.7455683 |pmid=7455683 |issue=4481}}&lt;/ref&gt; Framing effects play an integral role in risk -aversion, as an extension of PT’s S-shaped value function, which illustrates the differences in how gains and losses are valued relative to a reference point. 
				
Risky prospects are characterized by their possible outcomes and by the probabilities of these outcomes.&lt;ref name="T&amp;K 1981" /&gt; The same, possible outcomes of a gamble can be framed either as gains or as losses relative to the status quo. The following pair of problems attests to the power of framing effects in manipulating either risk-averse or risk-seeking behavior.

''The total number of respondents in each problem is denoted by N, and the percentage who chose each option is indicated in parentheses.&lt;blockquote&gt;Problem 1 (N = 152): Imagine that the U.S. is preparing for the outbreak of an unusual disease, which is expected to kill 600 people. Two alternative programs to combat the disease have been proposed. Assume that the exact scientific estimates of the consequences of the programs are as follows:&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If Program A is adopted, 200 people will be saved. (72%)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If Program B is adopted, there is a one-third probability that 600 people will be saved and a two-thirds probability that no people will be saved. (28%)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Which of the two programs would you favor?''.&lt;ref name="KT 1984" /&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;The formulation of Problem 1 implicitly adopts as a reference point a state of affairs in which the disease is allowed to take its toll of 600 lives. The outcomes of the programs include the reference state and two possible gains, measured by the number of lives saved. As expected, preferences are risk averse: a clear majority of respondents prefer saving 200 lives for sure over a gamble that offers a one-third chance of saving 600 lives.

Now consider another problem in which the same cover story is followed by a different description of the prospects associated with the two programs:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Problem 2 (N = 155): If Program C is adopted, 400 people will die. (22%)''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If Program D is adopted, there is a one-third probability that nobody will die and a two-thirds probability that 600 people will die. (78%)&lt;/blockquote&gt;It is easy to verify that options C and D in Problem 2 are indistinguishable in real terms from options A and B in Problem 1, respectively. The second version, however, assumes a reference state in which no one dies of the disease. The best outcome is the maintenance of this state and the alternatives are losses measured by the number of people that will die of the disease. People who evaluate options in these terms are expected to show a risk-seeking preference for the gamble (option D) over the sure loss of 400 lives. Of course, the “sure loss” of 400 lives that participants found so unattractive is exactly the same outcome as the “sure gain” of 200 subjects found so attractive in the Problem 1.&lt;ref name="Stan 2010" /&gt; The public health problem illustrates a formulation effect in which a change of wording from "lives saved" to "lives lost" induced a marked shift of preference from risk aversion to risk seeking.&lt;ref name="KT 1984" /&gt;

If preferences reverse based on inconsequential aspects of how the problem is framed, people cannot possibly be maximizing expected utility.&lt;ref name="Stan 2010" /&gt; Latent here is the unsettling idea that people’s preferences come from the outside (from whomever has the power to shape the environment and determine how questions are phrased), rather than from their own psychological makeup.&lt;ref name="Stan 2010" /&gt; Decision-making in matters as important as lives saved or lives lost can reverse risk preference. This may be based on a rephrasing of the outcomes that conveys no differential information about the treatments and that changes nothing about the outcomes themselves.&lt;ref name="Stan 2010" /&gt;

==Phenomena==

While risk aversion is commonly explained through EUT and PT, observed risk-aversion behavior remains solely an artifact of these two theories, and extends beyond the bounds of what each theory can explain.

===Direct risk aversion===

Both EUT and PT make the following falsifiable prediction: an individual cannot be so risk averse as to value a risky prospect less than the prospect’s worst possible outcome.&lt;ref name="simonsohn" /&gt; On the contrary, several between-participant studies have found that people are willing to pay less, on average, for a binary lottery than for its worse outcome, a finding coined the uncertainty effect (UE).&lt;ref name="Gneezy"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics| year=2006 |volume=121| issue=4 |pages=1283–1309|title= The uncertainty effect: When a risky prospect is valued less than its worse outcome|author=Gneezy, U., List, J.A., Wu, G.|doi=10.1093/qje/121.4.1283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''For example, people are willing to pay an average of $26 for a $50 gift certificate, but only $16 for a lottery that pays either a $50 or $100 gift certificate, with equal probability.'' &lt;ref name="Gneezy" /&gt;

UE, valuing a risky prospect below the value of its worse possible outcome, occurs as the result of a phenomenon known as direct risk aversion, a literal distaste for uncertainty, as uncertainty itself enters directly into people’s utility function.&lt;ref name="simonsohn" /&gt;

====Societal applications====

EUT and PT predict that people should not purchase insurance for small-stakes risks, yet such forms of insurance (e.g., electronic warranties, insurance policies with low deductibles, mail insurance, etc.) are very popular.&lt;ref name="simonsohn" /&gt; Direct risk aversion may explain why, as people demonstrate their literal distaste for any and all levels of uncertainty. By paying a premium (often higher than the cost of replacement) for the possibility that insurance may come in handy, people display direct risk aversion by valuing a risky prospect below the value of its worst possible outcome (replacement at face-value).	
			
''Suppose you are undecided whether or not to purchase earthquake insurance because the premium is quite high. As you hesitate, your friendly insurance agent comes forth with an alternative offer: "For half the regular premium you can be fully covered if the quake occurs on an odd day of the month. This is a good deal because for half the price you are covered for more than half the days."''

Why do most people find such probabilistic insurance distinctly unattractive? Starting anywhere in the region of low probabilities, the impact on the decision weight of a reduction of probability from p to p/2 is considerably smaller than the effect of a reduction from p/2 to 0. Reducing the risk by half, then, is not worth half the premium.

The aversion to probabilistic insurance is significant for three reasons. First, it undermines the classical explanation of insurance in terms of a concave utility function.&lt;ref name="KT 1984" /&gt; According to EUT, probabilistic insurance should be definitely preferred to normal insurance when the latter is just acceptable.&lt;ref name="K&amp;T 1979" /&gt; Second, probabilistic insurance represents many forms of protective action, such as having a medical checkup, buying new tires, or installing a burglar alarm system.&lt;ref name="KT 1984" /&gt; Such actions typically reduce the probability of some hazard without eliminating it altogether.&lt;ref name="KT 1984" /&gt; Third, the acceptability of insurance can be manipulated by the framing of the contingencies.&lt;ref name="KT 1984" /&gt; An insurance policy that covers fire but not flood, for example, could be evaluated either as full protection against a specific risk, (e.g., fire) or as a reduction in the overall probability of property loss.&lt;ref name="KT 1984" /&gt; People greatly undervalue a reduction in the probability of a hazard in comparison to the complete elimination of that hazard.&lt;ref name="KT 1984" /&gt; Hence, insurance should appear more attractive when it is framed as the elimination of risk than when it is described as a reduction of risk.&lt;ref name="KT 1984" /&gt;

Further, Slovic, Fischhoff, and Lichtenstein (1982)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Slovic, P.; Fischhoff, B.; Lichtenstein, S.|chapter=Response mode, framing, and information-processing effects in risk assessment|pages=21–36| editor-last=Hogarth |editor-first=R. |year=1982 |title=New directions for methodology of social and behavioral science: Question framing and response consistency |location=San Francisco|publisher=Jossey-Bass}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that a hypothetical vaccine that reduces the probability of contracting a disease from 20% to 10% is less attractive if it is described as effective in half of the cases than if it is presented as fully effective against one of two exclusive and equally probable virus strains that produce identical symptoms.&lt;ref name="slov"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Health Psychology| year=2005 |volume=24 | issue=4, Suppl |pages=S35–S40| title=Affect, Risk, and Decision Making|author=Slovic, P., &amp; Peters, E., &amp; Finucane, M.L., &amp; MacGregor, D.G. |doi=10.1037/0278-6133.24.4.s35| pmid=16045417 | hdl=1794/22607 | citeseerx=10.1.1.335.734 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Affective psychology of risk===

The earliest studies of risk perception also found that, whereas risk and benefit tend to be positively correlated in the world, they are negatively correlated in people’s minds, and, therefore, judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Policy Sciences| year=1978 |volume=9| issue=2 |pages=127–152|title=How safe is safe enough? A Psychometric study of attitudes toward technological risks and benefits|author=Fischhoff, B., Slovic, P., Lichtenstein, S., Read, S., &amp; Combs, B.|doi=10.1007/bf00143739}}&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of this finding was not realized until a study by Alhakami and Slovic (1994) found that the inverse relation between perceived risk and perceived benefit of an activity (e.g., using pesticides) was linked to the strength of positive or negative affect associated with that activity as measured by rating the activity on bipolar scales such as good/bad, nice/awful, dread/not dread, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Risk Analysis| year=1994 |volume=14| issue=6 |pages=1085–1096|title= A psychological study of the inverse relationship between perceived risk and perceived benefit|author=Alhakami, A.S., &amp; Slovic, P.|doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.1994.tb00080.x| hdl=1794/22415 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This result implies that people base their judgments of an activity or a technology not only on what they think about it but also on how they feel about it.&lt;ref name="slov" /&gt; If their feelings toward an activity are favorable, they are moved toward judging the risks as low and the benefits as high; if their feelings toward it are unfavorable, they tend to judge the opposite— high risk and low benefit (''see also [[affect heuristic]]'').&lt;ref name="slov" /&gt;

Both EUT and PT are probability-outcome independent theories, as they posit separate functions for the evaluation of outcomes and probabilities.&lt;ref name="Rotten" /&gt; Both assume that the impact of a given probability is a function of that probability but not of the outcome to which it’s attached.&lt;ref name="Rotten" /&gt; Further, neither theory distinguishes one source of value from another.&lt;ref name="Rotten" /&gt; While probability-outcome independence may hold across outcomes of different monetary values, it is unlikely to hold across outcomes of varying ''affects''.&lt;ref name="Rotten" /&gt;

====Realm of gains====

In 2001, two researchers from the University of Chicago, Rottenstreich and Hsee, conducted a series of three experiments to illustrate probability-outcome dependence, using an affective approach.&lt;ref name="Rotten" /&gt;

''Experiment 1: In an experiment observing probability-outcome interactions, a lottery ticket offers you a chance to meet and kiss your favorite movie-star as a prize (affect-rich) or $50 in cash (affect-poor). Each of the two conditions poses a 1% probability of the respective gamble occurring.''

''Results &amp; Implications: 70% of participants preferred the cash to the kiss under certainty, whereas 65% (nearly the reverse) preferred the kiss to the cash under low probability. This indicates that we weight what should be an objectively equal 1% probability in each scenario differently: a 1% probability is greater for the affect-rich kiss than for the affect-poor cash.''

''Experiment 2: In a subsequent, and more realistic study, two similar and financially equivalent prizes - a $500 coupon redeemable toward payments associated with a European vacation (affect-rich) and a $500 coupon redeemable toward payment of tuition (affect-poor) were presented. For each prize, some participants were told they had a 1% chance of winning, and others a 99% chance of winning. Participants then had to indicate how much money they would have to be offered for them to be indifferent between receiving that dollar amount for sure and having the specified chance of winning the prize.''

''Results &amp; Implications: Although the two coupons had equivalent redemption values, the median price of the 1% chance of winning the European vacation was $20, but $5 for the tuition coupon, indicating that the weight of 1% we place on affect-rich prizes is greater than for affect-poor prizes. Based on results from the 1% condition, PT would predict that at a 99% chance of winning, the European coupon would still be priced higher than the tuition coupon. On the contrary, the affective approach found that in the 99% chance of winning condition, the median price of the European coupon was $450, whereas that of the tuition coupon was $478. Our weighting of the 99% probability as smaller for the affect-rich European coupon than the affect-poor tuition coupon indicates probability-outcome dependence for affect-rich outcomes. Affect-rich outcomes yield more pronounced overweighting of small probabilities, but more pronounced underweighting of large probabilities.''

Both examples indicate probability-outcome dependence, as based on affect-rich outcomes, which changes the shape of PT’s S-shaped curve.

In Experiment 2, the size of the affect-rich jump in the weighting function is much greater ($500 – $450 = $50) than the size of the affect-poor jump ($500 – $478 = $22).&lt;ref name="Rotten" /&gt; Thus, weighting functions will be more S-shaped for lotteries involving affect-rich than affect-poor outcomes.&lt;ref name="Rotten" /&gt; That is, people will be more sensitive to departures from impossibility and certainty (from hope and fear), but less sensitive to intermediate probability variations for affect-rich outcomes, resulting in larger jumps at the endpoints of the weighting function.&lt;ref name="Rotten" /&gt; Results from this study suggest that the assumption of probability-outcome independence adopted by both EUT and PT may hold across outcomes of different monetary values, but not different affective values.&lt;ref name="Rotten" /&gt;

====Realm of losses====

The outcomes studies in Experiments 1 and 2 were gains above the status quo. When a positive outcome is available, any departure from impossibility may engender hope (affect-rich and positive), and any deviation from certainty may produce fear (affect-rich but negative). The following study demonstrates that the opposite pattern is also true: when the available outcome is negative, departures from impossibility engender fear, and deviations from certainty produce hope.

''Experiment 3: Participants were told to imagine themselves in a hypothetical experiment entailing either a certain, 1% or 99% chance of a short, painful but not dangerous electric shock (affect-rich), and others were told that the experiment entailed either a 1% or 99% chance of a cash penalty (affect-poor, relatively). They were then asked to indicate how much money they would have to pay for them to be indifferent between paying that amount for sure and participating in the hypothetical experiment.

Certainty condition: The median price paid to avoid an electric shock was $19.86. Most participants (24/30) preferred receiving the shock over paying more than $20.

Low-probability condition: The median price paid to avoid a 1% chance of a shock was $7, substantially greater than the median price paid to avoid a 1% chance of a $20 penalty. As before, the weight of a 1% probability is greater for the affect-rich shock than for the affect-poor cash payment.

High-probability condition: The median price paid to avoid a 99% chance of shock, $10, was substantially lower than the median price paid to avoid a 99% chance of cash penalty, $18.

Results: Taken together, for the affect-rich electric shock, the size of the right-hand jump in the weighting function is about $10 ($19.86 - $10), but for the affect-poor cash penalty, the size of this jump is much smaller at $2 ($20 - $18). Again, we see that the weight of the 99% is smaller for the affect-rich shock than for the affect-poor cash.''
 
Both Experiments 1 and 2 investigated outcomes that were gains over the status quo. Experiment 3 studied negative outcomes and also found evidence of a weighting function that is more S-shaped for affect-rich that affect-poor prizes. Therefore, probability-outcome dependence based on the affect-rich psychology of risk applies in the domains of both gains and losses.&lt;ref name="Rotten" /&gt;

==Neuropsychology of risk aversion==

===Negativity bias===
Do you remember the worst thing that has happened to you? What about the best? At what frequency are you able to recall memories that are negative in comparison to those that are positive? Does it seem like negative information is remembered with more ease and clarity than positive information? Why is it easier to know the percentage of fatal car accidents each year, as opposed to the percentage of accidents without fatalities?
 
The human brain demonstrates a partiality for the processing of negative information. In comparison with their positive counterparts, negative stimuli receive a larger allocation of attention and a swifter response once recognized by the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Neuropsychologia| year=2003 |volume=41 | issue = 2 |pages=171–183| title=May I have your attention, please: Electrocortical responses to positive and negative stimuli|author=Smith, N., &amp; Larsen, J., &amp; Chartrand, T. | doi=10.1016/s0028-3932(02)00147-1| citeseerx=10.1.1.322.5967 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology| year=1988 |volume=75 | issue = 4 |pages=887–900|title= Negative information weighs more heavily on the brain: The negativity bias in evaluative categorizations|author=Ito, T. A., Larsen, J. T., Smith, N. K., &amp; Cacioppo, J. T. |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.75.4.887 |pmid=9825526| citeseerx=10.1.1.316.2348 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This bias for negative information occurs very early on in the stages of processing, seen in the appearance of a P1, a component of the event-related potentials (ERP) gathered from an EEG (electroencephalography) output. Researchers localized this particular ERP to the ventrolateral occipital cortex. Given that a greater amount of attention is allotted to the processing of negative stimuli, the negativity bias may also be indicative of an attentional bias.
 
The negativity bias is noticeable in a plethora of situations related to the formation of risk-averse behaviour. Notably, any stimuli that evokes the expression of fear encourages risk -aversion. The human brain has adapted to easily parse out these stimuli from a sea of benign stimuli. In the laboratory, participants report and respond more quickly to negative stimuli; Photos of negative and threatening pictures jump out of an array of photos, capturing participants’ attention more than positive or neutral pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Öhman, A., Flykt, A., &amp; Lundqvist, D.|chapter=Unconscious emotion: Evolutionary perspectives, psychophysiological data and neuropsychological mechanisms|editor-last1=Lane|editor-first1=R. D.|editor-last2=Nadel|editor-first2=L.|title=Cognitive Neuroscience of Emotion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A2s963AzymYC&amp;pg=PA296|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-515592-1|page=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-tangibles, such as personality traits, also demonstrate a similar impact for eliciting risk-averse behaviour. Carleston &amp; Skowronski (1989) found that negative traits form a stronger impression on an individual than positive traits, thus affecting the overall impression of the individual being evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Psychological Bulletin| year=1989 |volume=105 | issue = 1 |pages=131–142| title=Negativity and extremity biases in impression formation: A review of explanations|author=Skowronski, J. J., &amp; Carlston, D. E. | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.105.1.131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emotion and decision making===

An individual’s affect often determines the extent to which one’s behaviour is effective in obtaining their goal. Decision making and emotion, intertwined, cannot be separated from each other, as emotion can either benefit or hinder the attainment of maximized utility.

====Influence of emotion on decision making====
Three different emotional states influence decision making:
Your current emotional state (i.e. How do you feel while you are making a decision?)
Your past emotional state (i.e. How did you feel anticipating your decision?)
Your future emotional state (i.e. How will your decision affect how you feel in the future; What effect will the decision have on your emotional well-being?)

====Iowa gambling task====
Researching decision-making and affect, Antoine Bechara, Antonio Damasio and colleagues (2000; 2005) discovered that damage to a brain area associated with emotional processing impairs effective decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Cerebral Cortex| year=2000 |volume=10 | issue = 3|pages=295–307|title=Emotion, decision making and the orbitofrontal cortex|author=Bechara, A., Damasio, H., &amp; Damasio, A. R. |doi=10.1093/cercor/10.3.295 |pmid=10731224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences| year=2005 |volume=9 | issue = 4|pages=159–162|title=The Iowa Gambling Task and the somatic marker hypothesis: some questions and answers|author=Bechara, A., Damasio, H., Tranel, D., &amp; Damasio, A. R. |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2005.02.002 |pmid=15808493}}&lt;/ref&gt; After discovering that damage to the orbitofrontal cortex impaired participants from making goal-oriented decisions in social and professional contexts, Damasio and his colleagues designed the Iowa Gambling Task. In creating this task, Damasio wondered whether decision-making was afflicted because emotion was a necessary component to making effective decisions.

In the task, participants continuously draw from one out of four possible decks – participants may switch decks at any point during the study.

Each card possesses monetary value, resulting in either gains or losses.

Participants are unaware that 2 of the decks correspond to net winnings – low payoffs and even lower losses. The other 2 decks correspond to net losses – high payoffs and even higher losses.

Researchers instruct participants to maximize their utility – gain the most money by the end of the task. In order to complete this task successfully, participants must discern that the decks associated with net winning, yet low payoffs, maximize their utility.''

'''Results'''. Damasio noticed that participants with damage to their orbitofrontal cortex were unable to realize that the deck associated with low payoffs yielded higher reward. From his discovery using the Iowa Gambling Task, Damasio formulated a [[Somatic marker hypothesis]].

'''Alternate Conclusions'''. Other researchers suggest that the difficulty encountered by patients with orbitofrontal cortex damage on Iowa Gambling Task is because the task requires participants to change their initial perception of potential gains and losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Neuropsychologia| year=2005 |volume=43 | issue = 8|pages=1214–1221|title=Dissociable elements of human foresight: a role for the ventromedial frontal lobes in framing the future, but not in discounting future rewards|author=Fellows, L. K., &amp; Farah, M. J |doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.07.018 |pmid=15817179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants are lured in by appealing rewards, then confronted with devastating losses. Thus, orbitofrontal cortex damage inhibits the adaptation to changing patterns of rewards and punishment. This conclusion has been replicated in primates, where orbitofrontal damage prevented the extinction of a learned association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Experimental Neurology| year=1972 |volume=36 | issue = 2 |pages=362–377|title= Limbic lesions and the problem of stimulus—reinforcement associations|author=Jones, B., &amp; Mishkin, M. |doi=10.1016/0014-4886(72)90030-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Somatic marker theory====
{{Main|Somatic marker hypothesis}}
Damasio posited that emotional information in the form of physiological arousal, is needed to inform decision making. When confronted with a decision, we may react emotionally to the situation, a reaction that manifests as changes in physiological arousal in the body, or somatic markers. Given data collected from the Iowa Gambling Task, Damasio postulated that the orbitofrontal cortex assists individuals in forming an association between somatic markers and the situations that trigger them. Once an association is made, the orbitofrontal cortex and other brain areas evaluate an individual’s previous experiences eliciting similar somatic markers. Once recognized, the orbitofrontal cortex can determine an adequate and swift behavioural response, and its likeliness for reward.

===Neuroscience of risk aversion===

====Regret and risk aversion====
Several brain areas are observed in the expression of risk-averse behaviour. The previously mentioned orbitofrontal cortex is amongst these brain areas, supporting the feeling of regret. Regret, an emotion which heavily influences decision making, leads individuals to make decisions which circumvent encountering this emotion in the future.

Studying brain activity associated with regret, researcher Georgio Coricelli and his colleagues (2005) triggered feelings of regret in healthy participants, by having them complete a gambling task in which they were informed that the best choice was the unchosen option.&lt;ref name="Coricelli"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Nature Neuroscience| year=2005 |volume=8 | issue = 9|pages=1255–1262|title=Regret and its avoidance: a neuroimaging study of choice behavior|author=Coricelli, G., Critchley, H. D., Joffily, M., O'Doherty, J. P., Sirigu, A., &amp; Dolan, R. J. |doi=10.1038/nn1514 |pmid=16116457| hdl=21.11116/0000-0001-A327-B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), Coricelli found that increasing regret correlated with increased activity in the medial orbitofrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the anterior hippocampus.&lt;ref name="Coricelli" /&gt; The higher the activation in the medial orbitofrontal cortex, the greater the reported regret. After repeated trials, researchers began to observe risk averse behaviour by their participants, a behaviour echoed in intensified activity within the medial orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala.

====Brain areas of risk aversion====
Risk-averse behaviors are the culmination of several neural correlates. While avoiding negative stimuli, perceived or real, is a simple enough action, it requires anticipation, motivation and reasoning. How do you know a stimulus is malevolent? What information leads you to ultimately behave in a manner consistent with ensuring or endangering your well-being? Each of these questions recruit a different brain area, playing a poignant role in whether a decision is beneficial to an individual.

'''''Fear-Conditioning'''''. Over time, individuals learn that a stimulus is not benign through personal experience. Implicitly, a fear of a particular stimulus can develop, resulting in risk-averse behaviour. Traditionally, fear-conditioning is not associated with decision-making, but rather the pairing of a neutral stimulus with an aversive situation. Once an association is formed between the neutral stimulus and aversive event, a startle response is observed each time the neutral stimulus is presented. An aversion to the presentation of the neutral stimulus is observed after repeated trials.

Essential to understanding risk aversion is the implicit learning that occurs during fear-conditioning. Risk aversion is the culmination of implicitly or explicitly acquired knowledge that informs an individual that a particular situation is aversive to their psychological well-being. Similarly, fear-conditioning is the acquisition of knowledge that informs an individual that a particular neutral stimulus now predicts an event that endangers their psychological or physical well-being.

Researchers such as Mike Davis (1992) and Joseph LeDoux (1996), have deciphered the neural correlates responsible for the acquisition of fear-conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |journal=Progress in Brain Research| year=1996 |volume=107 |pages=437–446|title=Emotional networks and motor control: a fearful view|author=LeDoux, J. |doi=10.1016/s0079-6123(08)61880-4| isbn=9780444819628 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience| year=1992 |volume=15 | issue = 1|pages=353–375|title=The role of the amygdala in fear and anxiety|author=Davis, M. |doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.15.1.353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amygdala, previously mentioned as a region showing high activity for the emotion of regret, is the central recipient for brain activity concerning fear-conditioning. Several streams of information from multiple brain areas converge on the lateral amygdala, allowing for the creation of associations that regulate fear-conditioning; Cells in the superior dorsal lateral amygdala are able to rapidly pair the neutral stimulus with the aversive stimulus. Cells that project from the lateral amygdala to the central amygdala allow for the initiation of an emotional response if a stimulus is deemed threatening.

'''''Cognitive Control''.''' Evaluating a gamble and calculating its expected value requires a certain amount of cognitive control. Several brain areas are dedicated to monitoring the congruence between expected and actual outcomes. Evidence by Ridderinkhof et al. (2004) suggests that the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) and the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) are involved in goal-directed performance monitoring and behaviour modulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Science| year=2004 |volume=306 | issue = 5695 |pages=443–447|title=The role of the medial frontal cortex in cognitive control|author=Ridderinkhof, K. R., Ullsperger, M., Crone, E. A., &amp; Nieuwenhuis, S. |doi=10.1126/science.1100301 |pmid=15486290| hdl=1871/17182 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pMPC monitors response conflicts (any situation that activates more than one response tendency), decision uncertainty, and any deviation from the anticipated outcome. Activation in the pMPC increases significantly after an error, response conflict, or unfavorable outcome is detected. As a result, the pMFC can signal a need for performance adjustment; there is a lack of evidence, however, indicating that the pMFC controls modulatory behaviour. Behaviour control processes in the LPFC have been implicated in the modulatory behaviour observed by researchers.

==Summary==
The field of neuroeconomics is emerging as a unified branch of knowledge, intending to merge information from psychology, economics and neuroscience with hopes of better understanding human behaviour. Risk aversion poses a mystifying question that intrigues experts in all three disciplines. Why is it that humans do not act in accord with their anticipated outcome? Whilst negative outcomes retain more value than positive outcome, human beings do not make logical decisions. Parsing out emotion and fear of loss from decision making would result in more implementation of mathematical calculations, thus maximizing expected utility. While activation in specific brain areas can highlight the mechanisms of decision making, evidence continues to support the prevalence of risk-averse behaviour.

'''''The Royal Albatross''''' is a four-masted [[Barquentine]] privately owned, built as a luxury vessel. She operates from her home berth at [[Resorts World Sentosa]] on the island of [[Sentosa]] in [[Singapore]].
[[File:RAatRWS.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Royal Albatross'' at her home berth in Singapore.]]

The ''Royal Albatross'' is a unique luxury [[tall ship]] with four masts, 22-sails, more than 200 ropes, three decks and is comparable with a [[luxury yacht]]; but unlike the typical super-yacht, it looks and operates like an old-world galleon or pirate ship. After a 5.5 year reconstruction inside out, the Royal Albatross is one of Singapore’s premier hospitality venues with a passenger capacity of 200 (alongside) and 149 (sailing) all of which can be accommodated on a continuous upper deck.

The ''Royal Albatross'' started its operating life in Chicago where it was known at '''''Windy II''''', cruising the Great Lakes prior to a journey in 2008 that brought it over 15,000 kilometres from the moderate climes of North America to the tropical waters of South East Asia. She was the first U.S. certified four-masted barquentine since about 1920.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoonerman.com/windy_ii_Grandhaven.htm Schooner Man]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since arriving in Singapore, approximately 360,000 man hours were invested re-designing, re-fitting and certifying the ''Royal Albatross''. It features 22 sails, over 650 square meters of canvas and over 60,000 RGB lights.

== Sunset Sail City Lights ==
In October 2016, the Royal Albatross launched its first Sunset Sail on the weekends to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tallship.com.sg/events/sunset-sail-city-lights/ Tallship.com.sg]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bryna Singh, [https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/sail-away-for-a-sunset-party "Sail and dine on Batman's yacht from $195 a person"], ''Straits Times'', 14 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The harbour cruise starting from Resorts World Sentosa, is a 2.5-hour dinner cruise with live entertainment on board, sailing towards the outskirts of Marina Bay with the city skyline in the distance, and then heading back between the Southern Islands of Singapore to Sentosa. The Royal Albatross sailing tickets can be purchased on its website and other resellers like SISTIC.

The '''Singapore Airshow''', formerly known as ''Changi International Airshow'', is a biennial [[Aerospace|aerospace]] event held in [[Singapore]], debuted in 2008. The event was launched as a partnership between Singaporean agencies [[Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore]] and the [[Defence Science and Technology Agency]] after the relocation of [[Asian Aerospace]] from [[Singapore]]. It hosts high-level government and military delegations, as well as senior corporate executives around the world, while serving as a global event for leading aerospace companies and budding players (including [[Startup company|start-ups]]) to make their mark in the [[Aerospace manufacturer|international aerospace and defence market]]. The event offers a unique platform for [[Thought leader|industry thought leadership]] through its high-level conferences, forums and co-located events. Leading industry players, government and military chiefs gather here bi-annually to contribute to dialogues, exchange ideas and seek solutions and strategies to advance the interests of the global aerospace and defence sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singapore Airshow 2018 {{!}} About Singapore Airshow 2018 {{!}} Aviation Events And Exhibition|url=https://www.singaporeairshow.com/trade/about-sgairshow.html|website=www.singaporeairshow.com|language=en|access-date=18 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306042436/http://www.singaporeairshow.com/trade/about-sgairshow.html|archive-date=6 March 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is cited to be the third largest air show in the world after [[Paris Air Show|Le Bourget]] and [[Farnborough Air Show|Farnborough]], as well as [[Asia]]'s largest air show, although this is disputed by the [[Dubai Air Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/aerospace/2017-11-08/2017-dubai-airshow-expected-be-largest-yet |title= 2017 Dubai Airshow Expected To Be Largest Yet |author= Peter Shaw-Smith |date= November 8, 2017 |work= AIN |access-date= 10 November 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171110225252/https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/aerospace/2017-11-08/2017-dubai-airshow-expected-be-largest-yet |archive-date= 10 November 2017 |dead-url= no |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Choudhury|first1=Saheli Roy|title=Most airlines did not buy new planes at Asia's largest airshow — manufacturers are still optimistic|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/08/singapore-airshow-plane-makers-are-upbeat-about-asia-pacific-demand.html|work=CNBC|date=8 February 2018|access-date=18 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219031224/https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/08/singapore-airshow-plane-makers-are-upbeat-about-asia-pacific-demand.html|archive-date=19 February 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Asia's biggest air show kicks off in Singapore|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/278631-asias-biggest-air-show-begins-in-singapore|work=www.thenews.com.pk|language=en|access-date=18 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219090137/https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/278631-asias-biggest-air-show-begins-in-singapore|archive-date=19 February 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venue==
The selected venue for the permanent site of '''Singapore Airshow''' is situated on a plot of land just beyond the northern edge [[perimeter fencing]] of [[Changi Air Base (East)|Changi Air Base]], which was itself located due east of the nearby [[Singapore Changi Airport]]. In 2006, a contract worth [[S$]]60 million was awarded to Eng Lim Construction to begin the building of the new exhibition site to replace the [[Changi International Exhibition and Convention Centre]], including a main exhibition hall with 40,000 square metres of space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Changi Exhibition Centre===
When completed in September 2007, the new site boasted a 40,000 square metres of fully air-conditioned exhibition hall, 2,000 [[parking lots]] for trade visitors and motorists as well as 100,000 square metres of outdoor space for exhibitions and functions. Upon its completion, the hall was promptly named as the [[Changi Exhibition Centre]] to set it apart from the [[Changi International Exhibition and Convention Centre]] which had been in use by the [[Asian Aerospace]] exhibitions from 1988 to 2006. Note that the old site is a good 2 kilometres due west of the current one.

==2008==
[[Image:RSAFBlackKnights-F16-200802.jpg|thumb|F-16Cs of [[RSAF Black Knights]] in formation flight during the inaugural show.]]

The inaugural show was held from 19 to 24 February 2008, with the first four days reserved for trade visitors at the purpose-built Changi Exhibition Centre in [[Changi]]. Besides the usual exhibits and static displays, the event saw the return of aerobatic flying displays put up by the [[Airbus A380]], [[RSAF Black Knights|Black Knights]] of the [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]] and the [[Roulettes]] of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]]. Also held concurrently are several seminars and conferences, including the Singapore Airshow Aviation Leadership Summit, the Global Air Power Conference, the International Defence Procurement Conference, the [[C4I Asia Conference]] and the Global Space and Technology Convention. The static displays included several themed exhibition pavilions, including the Airport Pavilion and the Integrated Land Defence Pavilion. The ATW Airline Industry Achievement Awards was also held during the Airshow.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17068">'''''TCM Underground''''' is a weekly late-night [[cult film]] showcase airing on [[Turner Classic Movies]]. Developed by former TCM marketing director Eric Weber, it was originally hosted by [[industrial rock]]/[[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] musician and independent [[Film director|filmmaker]] [[Rob Zombie]]. The movies were programmed by Eric Weber until 2007 when TCM programmer Millie De Chirico took over the role.

The series was launched in an attempt to attract more young viewers to Turner's older-skewing audience.&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey, John.

URL retrieved 2006-12-02.&lt;/ref&gt; TCM began airing a new program titled ''Friday Night Spotlight'' and, in effect, ''TCM Underground'' was moved from its Friday time slot to Saturdays beginning April 6, 2013 (a TCM broadcast day runs from 6am-5:59am EST the following day, making ''Underground'', in fact, airing on Sunday), but as of March 10, 2018, the series has returned to its original Friday night time slot.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.turner.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=6338&lt;/ref&gt; Promotional bumper material and opening credit sequences were created by [http://www.raygun.com/ Raygun].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/061212/20061212005125.html?.v=1|title=Raygun Goes Underground With Turner Classic Movies (TCM)|date=2006-12-12|work=Yahoo! Finance|accessdate=2006-12-13}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series is periodically pre-empted by special month-long or seasonal scheduling themes, such as February's "[[31 Days of Oscar]]" film series and the month-long "Summer Under the Stars".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/movienews/index/?cid=148290|title=TCM 2006-2007 Programming Slate|date=2006-12-01|work=TCM Movie News|accessdate=2006-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When it does not conflict with a special theme, ''TCM Underground'' airs in its usual slot early on Saturday morning.

The cult films featured in ''TCM Underground'' belong to a number of genres, including but not limited to [[blaxploitation]] films (''[[Coffy]]'', ''[[Darktown Strutters]]'', ''[[The Mack]]''), horror, slasher, and [[giallo]] films (''[[Let's Scare Jessica to Death]]'', ''[[Black Christmas (1974 film)|Black Christmas]]'', ''[[Hatchet for the Honeymoon]]''), and [[counterculture]] films (''[[An American Hippie in Israel]]'', ''[[Ciao!

[[File:TheHerosJourney.jpg|thumb|First edition]]
'''''The Hero's Journey: Joseph Campbell on His Life and Work''''' is a biography of the mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]] 1904-1987. In the form of a series of conversations, the book was drawn from the film, [[The Hero's Journey (film)|''The Hero's Journey: A Biographical Portrait'']]

This book was originally published by [[HarperCollins]] in 1990. A second edition was published in 1999 by [[Element Books]]—which closed within weeks of the book's rerelease, leaving it out of print again until another new edition was published by [[New World Library]] in 2003 in anticipation of the centennial of Campbell's birth. This edition was the seventh title in the [[Joseph Campbell Foundation]]'s [[Collected Works of Joseph Campbell]] series.

==Critical reception==
Publishers Weekly said that readers of Campbell's previous works would enjoy ''The Hero's Journey''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Stuttaford |first=Genevieve |date=13 April 1990 |title=The Hero's Journey: Joseph Campbell on His Life and Work |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-06-250171-4 |magazine=Publishers Weekly |volume=237 |issue=15 |page=50 |access-date=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Library Journal said the book built upon previous known information about Campbell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Patrick |first=Lucy |date=15 May 1990 |title=The Hero's Journey: Joseph Campbell on His Life and Work |magazine=Library Journal |volume=115 |issue=9 |page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Nairobi Trio''' was a [[sketch comedy]] skit that [[Ernie Kovacs]] performed many times for his [[TV shows]]. It combined several existing concepts and visuals in a novel and creative way.

People in [[gorilla suit]]s had long been a comedy staple. The ploy of well-known, predictable music pieces gone awry had been practiced by artists as diverse as [[Stan Freberg]], [[Spike Jones]], and [[P. D. Q. Bach]]. The "slow burn" of one character being annoyed by another, resulting in eventual retaliation, was not new. But the combination of '''all''' of those ingredients, combined with impeccable timing, produced a unique and memorable result.

==Origins==

The skit was a live-action version of a child's [[animatronic]] wind-up [[music box]], performed to the tune "Solfeggio" by [[Robert Maxwell (songwriter)|Robert Maxwell]]. According to an interview with [[Edie Adams]] in [[John Barbour (actor)|John Barbour]]'s 1982 documentary ''Ernie Kovacs: Television's Original Genius'', Barry Shear, Kovacs's director at [[DuMont Television Network]], brought the tune to Kovacs's attention in 1954.&lt;ref name=Moderation&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zzXtobwmRZAC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=I0KoU9esIumV8gGs5oCwAg&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ernie%20kovacs&amp;f=false|title=Ernie Kovacs &amp; Early TV Comedy: Nothing in Moderation|editor-last=Horton|editor-first=Andrew|year=2010|publisher=University of Texas|accessdate=June 23, 2014|isbn=9780292779624|pages=46–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Kovacs first heard "Solfeggio," as recorded in 1953 by harpist [[Robert Maxwell]] and [[The Ray Charles Singers]], he immediately came up with a mental image of what would become The Nairobi Trio:&lt;ref name="Internet Movie Database"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083898|title=Ernie Kovacs: Television's Original Genius|date=November 17, 1982|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=August 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell's composition was popular enough with audiences that Maxwell recorded a new version (as The Fortune-Tellers) and released it as "Song of the Nairobi Trio".

==Cast members and skit scenarios==
[[Image:Nairobi trio masks.JPG|150px|thumb|The original Nairobi Trio masks, wigs and hats are on display at the [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]] in Chicago.]]
Of the three gorillas shown, all wearing hats, long coats, and white gloves, the middle gorilla, always played by Kovacs with a cigar, conducted the musicians with either a baton or a banana.{{sfn|Greene|2007|pp=62-63}} To the viewer's left stood a gorilla holding two oversized [[timpani]] mallets. The identity of this ape varied, but among Kovacs's celebrity friends both [[Jack Lemmon]]&lt;ref name="Internet Movie Database"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cxEiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=m3MFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4900,998264&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs&amp;hl=en|title=Minstrel Show Raises $150,000|date=1 May 1961|publisher=The Day|accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frank Sinatra]] are known to have performed the character. Seated at a piano at screen right was a female simian, variously played by [[Barbara Loden]], [[Jolene Brand]], and Kovacs's wife, [[Edie Adams]], who robotically thumped her hands up and down on the keys.&lt;ref name=Moderation/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No=7004&amp;Lot_No=49375&amp;src=pr|title=Ernie Kovacs' "Nairobi Trio" Timpani Mallets-Auction Description|publisher=Heritage Auction Galleries|accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all of the Nairobi Trio skits operated in the same fashion. As "Solfeggio" plays, the gorilla with the mallets repeatedly uses the center gorilla's (Kovacs's) head like a drum at the end of every phrase, punctuating the song's sharp "ba-da-BUM" [[Bongo drum|bongo]] [[riff]]. Every time this happens it brings a slightly changed and escalating response from the victim, who eventually tries to anticipate the mallet assaults and outwit the perpetrator. Ultimately staring him down, Kovacs, in the gorilla suit, is eventually distracted by the third gorilla, which allows the drummer to give him three final blows. The victimized gorilla then stands up and smashes a prop vase over the percussionist's head.{{sfn|Greene|2007|pp=62-63}} The sketch was repeated many times over the course of Kovacs's career. The audio was always "Solfeggio" but the staging changed occasionally; one variation had the first and second gorillas handling building blocks in tempo, with the third gorilla pounding at a xylophone.

The Nairobi Trio became so popular that M-G-M Records reissued Robert Maxwell's "Solfeggio" as "Song of the Nairobi Trio" in 1957. Edie Adams later said that the skits were simple enough for any one of Kovacs's friends and associates to step into the drummer's role without needing a rehearsal, and that the gorilla masks provided anonymity.&lt;ref name=Moderation/&gt;

The last time the routine was performed was on one of Kovacs's 1960s ABC specials shortly before his untimely death. On this occasion the combination of a bigger budget, the use of [[videotape]], and the luxury of retakes helped him to perfect the timing of the sketch.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} But the Nairobi Trio wasn't always confined to silence with "Solfeggio" playing; they went into outer space&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ernie Kovacs - The Nairobi Trio (sans one) in Space|accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also became safe crackers on a US Steel special, ''Private Eye, Private Eye'', which aired on CBS on March 8, 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=--UQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0uIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6904,1154759&amp;dq=ernie+kovacs+private+eye&amp;hl=en|title=Private Eye-Private Eye Stars Kovacs Tonight|date=8 March 1961|publisher=Eugene Register-Guard|accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* A popular [[New Zealand]] [[jazz]] group adopted the name, as did a radio-played Los Angeles jazz group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nairobi Trio (aka: Donavan/Muradian Quintet)|url=http://www.cdbaby.com/Artist/TheNairobiTrioakaDonavanMuradi}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The music video for the [[Harry Nilsson]] song "[[Coconut (song)|Coconut]]" features a similar arrangement as the trio.  The [[instrumental]] [[cover band]] [[Hot Butter]] includes a [[Moog synthesizer]] version of "Solfeggio" in its 1972 [[album]] ''Popcorn'' (Musicor MS-3242; 1972).  On the album, the song is retitled "Song of the Narobi Trio" with ''Nairobi'' having the variant spelling of ''Narobi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/6543695|title=Worldcat entry for: ''Popcorn''|date=1972|publisher=Musicor Records|accessdate=December 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Waltz with Bashir''''' ({{lang-he|ואלס עם באשיר}}, [[Transliteration|translit.]]&amp;nbsp;'''''Vals Im Bashir''''') is a 2008 Israeli [[Animation|animated]] [[War film|war]] [[documentary film]] written and directed by [[Ari Folman]]. It depicts Folman in search of his lost memories of his experience as a soldier in the [[1982 Lebanon War]].&lt;ref name=Hillel/&gt;

This film and ''[[$9.99]]'', also released in 2008, are the first Israeli animated feature-length films released theatrically since Alina and [[Yoram Gross]]'s ''[[Ba'al Hahalomot]]'' (1962). ''Waltz with Bashir'' [[Film premiere|premiered]] at the [[2008 Cannes Film Festival]] where it entered the competition for the [[Palme d'Or]], and since then has won and been nominated for many additional important awards while receiving wide acclaim from critics. It won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], an [[National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Film|NSFC Award for Best Film]], a [[César Award for Best Foreign Film]] and an [[International Documentary Association|IDA]] Award for Feature Documentary, and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], a [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language]] and an [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature]].

==Plot==
In 1982, [[Ari Folman]] was a 19-year-old IDF infantry soldier. In 2006, he meets with a friend from that period, who tells him of the nightmares he's having connected to his experiences from the [[1982 Lebanon War|Lebanon War]]. Folman is surprised to find that he recalls nothing from that period. Later that night he has a vision from the night of the [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]], the reality of which he is unable to clearly recall. In his memory, he and his soldier comrades are bathing at night by the seaside in [[Beirut]] under the light of flares descending over the city.

Folman rushes off to meet a childhood friend, who advises him to seek out others who were in Beirut at the same time, to understand what happened there and to revive his own memories. Folman converses with friends and other soldiers who served in the war, among others a psychologist, and Israeli TV reporter [[Ron Ben-Yishai]], who covered Beirut at the time. Folman eventually realizes that he "was in the second or third ring" of soldiers surrounding the [[Palestinian refugee camp]] where the carnage was perpetrated, and that he was among those soldiers firing flares into the sky to illuminate the refugee camp for the [[Lebanese Christian]] [[Kataeb Party|Phalange]] militia perpetrating the massacre inside. He concludes that his amnesia stemmed from his feeling as a teenage soldier that he was as guilty of the massacre as those who actually carried it out. The film ends with animation dissolving into actual footage of the aftermath of the massacre.

==Cast==
The film contains both fictional composites of real-life figures and actual living people.
* Ari Folman, an Israeli film-maker who recently finished his [[military reserve]] service. Some twenty years before, he served in the IDF during the Lebanon War.
* Miki Leon as Boaz Rein-Buskila, an accountant and Israeli Lebanon War veteran suffering from nightmares.
* [[Ori Sivan]], an Israeli filmmaker who previously co-directed two films with Folman and is his long-time friend.
* [[Yehezkel Lazarov]] as Carmi Can'an, an Israeli Lebanon War veteran who once was Folman's friend and now lives in the [[Netherlands]].
* Ronny Dayag, an Israeli Lebanon War veteran and high food engineer. During the war, he was a Merkava tank crewman.
* Shmuel Frenkel, an Israeli Lebanon War veteran. During this war he was the commander of an infantry unit.
* Zahava Solomon, an Israeli psychologist and researcher in the field of [[psychological trauma]].
* [[Ron Ben-Yishai]], an Israeli journalist who was the first to cover the massacre.
* Dror Harazi, an Israeli Lebanon War veteran. During the war, he commanded a tank stationed outside the [[Shatila refugee camp]].

==Title==
[[File:Chopin-waltz-op-64-no-2-in-c-sharp-minor.oga|thumbnail|Chopin's Waltz in C-sharp minor, Op. 64 no. 2 performed by L. Faulkner]]
The film takes its title from a scene in which Shmuel Frenkel, one of the interviewees and the commander of Folman's infantry unit at the time of the film's events, grabs a [[FN MAG|general purpose machine gun]] and "dances an insane [[waltz]]" (to the tune of [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]]'s [[Waltz in C-sharp minor, Op. 64, No. 2 (Chopin)|Waltz in C-sharp minor]]) amid heavy enemy fire on a Beirut street festooned with huge posters of [[Bachir Gemayel|Bashir Gemayel]]. Thematically, the film's title is a symbolic description of the "Waltz", which is a dance for a couple, that Folman is "dancing" with his memories from the war in Lebanon.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} The title also refers to Israel's short-lived political waltz with Bashir Gemayel as president of Lebanon.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Others have speculated that the title is a reference to [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s satirical novel ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]], or The Children's Crusade: A Duty-Dance with Death''.

==Production==
The film took four years to complete. It is unusual in it being a feature-length [[Documentary film|documentary]] made almost entirely by the means of [[animation]]. It combines [[classical music]], 1980s music, realistic graphics, and surrealistic scenes together with illustrations similar to [[comics]]. The entire film is animated, excluding one short segment of news archive footage.

The animation, with its dark hues representing the overall feel of the film, uses a unique style invented by [[Yoni Goodman]] at the Bridgit Folman Film Gang studio in Israel. The technique is often confused with [[rotoscoping]], an animation style that uses drawings over live footage, but is actually a combination of [[Adobe Flash]] cutouts and classic animation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dgdesignnetwork.com.au/dgdn/dg-magazine-131/waltz-with-bashir/ Waltz with Bashir] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622195620/http://www.dgdesignnetwork.com.au/dgdn/dg-magazine-131/waltz-with-bashir/ |date=22 June 2009 }}, [http://www.dgdesignnetwork.com.au DG Design]&lt;/ref&gt; Each drawing was sliced into hundreds of pieces which were moved in relation to one another, thus creating the illusion of movement. The film was first shot in a sound studio as a 90-minute video and then transferred to a storyboard. From there 2,300 original illustrations were drawn based on the storyboard, which together formed the actual film scenes using Flash animation, classic animation, and 3D technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://israel21c.org/culture/israeli-filmmakers-head-to-cannes-with-animated-documentary-video/ Israeli filmmakers head to Cannes with animated documentary [VIDEO&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;], Israel21c.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The original soundtrack was composed by minimalist electronic musician [[Max Richter]] while the featured songs are by [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark|OMD]] ("[[Enola Gay (song)|Enola Gay]]"), [[Public Image Ltd.|PiL]] ("[[This Is Not a Love Song (song)|This is Not a Love Song]]"), Navadey Haukaf (נוודי האוכף
)("Good Morning Lebanon", written for the film), Haclique ("Incubator"), and Zeev Tene (a remake of the [[Cake (band)|Cake]] song "I Bombed Korea", retitled "Beirut"). Some reviewers have viewed the music as playing an active role as commentator on events instead of simple accompaniment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/63/63waltz.html | title=The Responsible Dream: On Waltz with Bashir by Jayson Harsin | publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal | accessdate=6 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception of the film===
As of March 2017, the film holds a 96% "fresh" rating on review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 149 critics for an average of 8.4/10; the general consensus states: "A wholly innovative, original, and vital history lesson, with pioneering animation, ''Waltz With Bashir'' delivers its message about the Middle East in a mesmerizing fashion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/waltz_with_bashir/ | title=Waltz with Bashir | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=[[Flixster]] | accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Metacritic, the film holds a 91/100 based on 33 critics, indicating “universal acclaim”.

''[[indieWire]]'' named the film the tenth best of the year, based on the site's annual survey of 100 film critics. Xan Brooks of ''[[The Guardian]]'' called it "an extraordinary, harrowing, provocative picture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Brooks | first=Xan | title=Bring on the light relief | work=Cannes diary | publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' | date=15 May 2008 | url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/cannes2008/story/0,,2280032,00.html | accessdate=15 May 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was praised for "inventing a new cinematographic language" at the [[Tokyo Filmex]] festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=festivals&amp;jump=story&amp;id=1061&amp;articleid=VR1117996638&amp;cs=1 | title='Bashir' wins big at Tokyo Filmex |publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' |accessdate=4 February 2009 | first=Mark | last=Schilling | date=1 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Socialist Web Site's David Walsh described it as a "painfully honest" anti-war film and "one of the most extraordinary and haunting films at the Toronto film festival."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2008/12/walt-d24.html|title=Waltz With Bashir: 'Memory takes us where we need to go'|last=Walsh|first=David|date=24 December 2008|website=World Socialist Web Site|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the positive critical reception, the film was only moderately commercially successful in Israel itself.&lt;ref name=Hillel&gt;[http://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/the--waltz-with-bashir--two-step-15082 The "Waltz with Bashir" Two-Step].

===Lebanon screening===
The film is banned in some Arab countries (including Lebanon), with the most harsh critics in Lebanon, as the film depicts a vague and violent time in Lebanon's history. A movement of bloggers, among them the Lebanese Inner Circle, +961 and others have rebelled against the Lebanese government's ban of the film, and have managed to get the film seen by local Lebanese critics, in defiance of their government's request on banning it. The film was privately screened in January 2009 in [[Beirut]] in front of 90 people.&lt;ref name=beirut&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.haaretz.com/1.5065340 | title=Israeli film on Lebanon War 'Waltz with Bashir' shown in Beirut | publisher=''[[Haaretz]]'' | accessdate=30 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then many screenings have taken place. Unofficial copies are also available in the country. Folman saw the screening as a source of great pride: "I was overwhelmed and excited. I wish I could have been there. I wish one day I'll be able to present the film myself in Beirut. For me, it will be the happiest day of my life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1233304842933&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |title= 'Waltz with Bashir' breaks barriers in Arab world |publisher= The Jerusalem Post |date= 22 February 2009 |accessdate= 23 February 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110917051443/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1233304842933&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |archive-date= 17 September 2011 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
