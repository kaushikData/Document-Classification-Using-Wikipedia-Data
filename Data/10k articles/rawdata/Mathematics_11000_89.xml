      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1207">In mathematics, the '''axiom of finite choice''' is a weak version of the [[axiom of choice]] which asserts that if &lt;math&gt;(S_\alpha)_{\alpha \in A}&lt;/math&gt; is a family of non-empty ''finite sets'', then
:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{\alpha \in A} S_\alpha \neq \emptyset &lt;/math&gt; ([[Cartesian product#Infinite products|set-theoretic product]]).&lt;ref name="herrlich" /&gt;{{rp|14}}
If every set can be [[total order|linearly ordered]], the axiom of finite choice follows.&lt;ref name="herrlich" /&gt;{{rp|17}}

== Applications ==
An important application is that when &lt;math&gt;(\Omega, 2^\Omega, \nu)&lt;/math&gt; is a measure space where &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the counting measure and &lt;math&gt;f: \Omega \to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is a function s.t.
:&lt;math&gt;\int_\Omega |f| d \nu &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;,

[[Image:Code Biquinaer reflektiert.svg|thumb|Reflected biquinary code]]
'''Bi-quinary coded decimal''' is a [[numeral system|numeral encoding scheme]] used in many [[abacus]]es and in some early computers, including the [[Colossus computer|Colossus]].  The term '''''bi-quinary''''' indicates that the code comprises both a two-state (''bi'') and a five-state (''quin''ary) component. The encoding resembles that used by many abaci, with four beads indicating either 0 through 4 or 5 through 9 and another bead indicating which of those ranges.

Several human languages, most notably [[Khmer numerals|Khmer]] and [[Wolof language|Wolof]], also use biquinary systems.  For example, the Khmer word for 6, ''pram muoy'', literally means ''five [plus] one''. The numerals from 0 to 9 in [[Japanese Sign Language]] is based on bi-quinary, with the thumb acting as 5 units, and the rest of the fingers each standing for 1 unit.

== Examples ==
Several different representations of bi-quinary coded decimal have been used by different machines.  The two-state component is encoded as one or two [[bit]]s, and the five-state component is encoded using three to five bits.  Some examples are:

* Roman and Chinese [[abacus]]es [[File:RomanAbacusRecon.jpg|thumb|Copy of a [[Roman abacus]]]] [[File:abacus 6.png|thumb|[[Suanpan]] (the number represented in the picture is 6,302,715,408)]]
* [[George Stibitz|Stibitz]] relay calculators at Bell Labs from [[Bell_Labs#Calculators|Model II]] onwards
* [[IBM 650]] &amp;ndash; seven bits
: Two ''bi'' bits: 0 5 and five ''quinary'' bits: 0 1 2 3 4, with error checking.
: Exactly one ''bi'' bit and one ''quinary'' bit is set in a valid digit. In the pictures of the front panel below and in close-up, the bi-quinary encoding of the internal workings of the machine are evident in the arrangement of the lights &amp;ndash; the ''bi'' bits form the top of a T for each digit, and the ''quinary'' bits form the vertical stem.
: (the machine was running when the photograph was taken and the active bits are visible in the close-up and just discernible in the full panel picture)

: One ''quinary'' bit (tube) for each of 1, 3, 5, and 7 - only one of these would be on at the time.

The '''British Mathematical Olympiad''' ('''BMO''') forms part of the selection process for the UK [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] team. It is organised by the [[British Mathematical Olympiad Subtrust]], which is part of the [[United Kingdom Mathematics Trust]]. There are two rounds, the BMO1 and the BMO2.&lt;ref name="bmoc.maths.org"&gt;http://www.bmoc.maths.org/home/bmo.shtml, BMO website, list of papers&lt;/ref&gt;

==BMO Round 1==
The first round of the BMO is held in December, and from 2006 is an open entry competition, costing £17 to enter.&lt;ref name="fees"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmoc.maths.org/news/20090929-00-bmofees.shtml|publisher=BMOS/BMOC|title=News: BMO entry fees|date=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this fee is waived for those who
(1) achieve the qualifying mark in the [[Senior Mathematical Challenge]] '''and''' 
(2) are British citizens, or will have studied for 3 full years of full-time secondary education in the UK by the time they leave school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmoc.maths.org/home/eligibility.shtml|publisher=BMOS/BMOC|title=Policy on Eligibility}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The paper lasts 3½ hours, and consists of six questions (from 2005), each worth 10 marks.&lt;ref name="bmo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmoc.maths.org/home/bmo.shtml|publisher=BMOS/BMOC|title=The British Mathematical Olympiads}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidates are encouraged to write full proofs to the questions they attempt, as a full answer to a question is worth many more marks than incomplete answers to several questions. This is because of the marking scheme: an answer is marked on either a "0+" or a "10-" mark scheme, depending on whether the answer looks generally complete or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmoc.maths.org/home/bmomarking.pdf|publisher=BMOS/BMOC|title=BMO Marking}}&lt;/ref&gt; So if an answer is judged incomplete or unfinished, it is awarded a few marks for progress and relevant observations, whereas if it is presented as complete and correct, marks are deducted for faults, poor reasoning, or unproven assumptions. As a result, it is quite uncommon for an answer to score a middling mark (i.e. 4–6).

Roughly 1300 students sit the BMO1 paper each year,&lt;ref name="bmo"/&gt; and many of these attain a very low score as a percentage of the total number of marks available—the [[median]] score in 2004 was approximately 5 or 6 (out of 50). However, the paper is meant to be a way of selecting the best young mathematicians in the country, and is therefore very difficult. In addition to the British students, there is a history of about 20 students from New Zealand being invited to take part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathsolympiad.org.nz/2009/12/bmo-round-1-new-zealand-results|title=BMO1 New Zealand results|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208174841/http://www.mathsolympiad.org.nz/2009/12/bmo-round-1-new-zealand-results/|archivedate=8 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally only about 30–40 students will score more than 50% in BMO1, with perhaps only 1 or 2 scoring above 90%.

In 2005, UKMT changed the system and added an extra easier question meaning the median is now raised. In 2008, 23 got over 40 out of 60&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmoc.maths.org/news/20081214-00-bmo1results.shtml|publisher=BMOS/BMOC|title=News: BMO Round 1 marked (12–14 December 2008)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and around 50 got over 30. 31 was the mark needed to get into the BMO2.

For the December 2010 paper, the mark needed for a year 13 pupil to automatically qualify for BMO2 was 28;  it was 22 for a year 12 pupil and 17 for a pupil in year 11 and below.

From the results of BMO1, 100 students are chosen to be invited to sit BMO2—generally from amongst the top scorers, although younger students scoring slightly less than their older counterparts are often chosen also.&lt;ref name="bmo"/&gt; It is possible to pay £22 to sit BMO2, but the candidate must have sat BMO1.&lt;ref name="fees"/&gt;

==BMO Round 2==
BMO2 (known as the ''Further International Selection Test, FIST'' from 1972 to 1991) is normally held in early February, and is significantly more difficult than BMO1. BMO2 also lasts 3½ hours, but consists of only four questions, each worth 10 marks. Like the BMO1 paper, it is not designed to test knowledge of advanced mathematics, but rather the candidate's ability to apply basic ideas to unusual problems.

Half of the candidates score less than 10, and it is rare for someone to score more than 35.

Twenty of the top scorers from BMO2 are subsequently invited to the training camp at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] for the first stage of the [[International Mathematical Olympiad|IMO]] UK team selection.&lt;ref name="bmoc.maths.org"/&gt;

==IMO Selection Papers==
''For more information about IMO selection in other countries, see [[International Mathematical Olympiad selection process]]''

Since 1985, further selection tests have been used after BMO2 to select the [[International Mathematical Olympiad|IMO]] team. (The team was selected following the single BMO paper from 1967 to 1971, then following the FIST paper for some years from 1972.) Initially these third-stage tests resulted in selection of both team and reserve; from 1993 a squad (team plus reserve) was selected following these tests with the team being separated from the reserve after further correspondence training, and after further selection tests from 2001 onwards. The third-stage tests have had names including FIST 2 (1985), [[Second International Selection Test]] (SIST), [[Reading Selection Test]] (1987), [[Final Selection Test]] (FST, 1992 to 2001) and [[First Selection Test]] (FST, from 2002); the fourth-stage tests have been [[Team Selection Test]] (TST, 2001) and [[Next Selection Test]] (NST, 2002 onwards). These tests have been held at training and selection camps in several locations, recently [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] and [[Oundle School]].&lt;ref name="bmoc.maths.org"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14655">The '''bulk synchronous parallel''' ('''BSP''') [[Abstract machine|abstract computer]] is a [[bridging model]] for designing [[parallel algorithm]]s.  It serves a purpose similar to the [[parallel random access machine]] (PRAM) model. BSP differs from PRAM by not taking communication and synchronization for granted. An important part of analyzing a BSP algorithm rests on quantifying the synchronization and communication needed.

==History==

The BSP model was developed by [[Leslie Valiant]] of [[Harvard University]] during the 1980s. The definitive article&lt;ref name="CACM_Valiant"&gt;Leslie G. Valiant, A bridging model for parallel computation, Communications of the ACM, Volume 33 Issue 8, Aug. 1990 [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=79173.79181]&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1990.

Between 1990 and 1992, Leslie Valiant and Bill McColl of [[Oxford University]] worked on ideas for a distributed memory BSP programming model, in Princeton and at Harvard. Between 1992 and 1997, McColl led a large research team at Oxford that developed various BSP programming libraries, languages and tools, and also numerous massively parallel BSP algorithms. With interest and momentum growing, McColl then led a group from Oxford, Harvard, Florida, Princeton, Bell Labs, Columbia and Utrecht that developed and published the BSPlib Standard for BSP programming in 1996.

Valiant developed an extension to the BSP model in the 2000s, leading to the publication of the Multi-BSP model&lt;ref name="JCSS_Valiant"&gt;Valiant, L. G. (2011). A bridging model for multi-core computing. Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 77(1), 154-166 [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcss.2010.06.012]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2011.

In 2017, McColl developed a major new extension of the BSP model that provides fault tolerance and tail tolerance for large-scale parallel computations in AI, Analytics and HPC. &lt;ref name="McC2017"&gt;A Bridging Model for High Performance Cloud Computing
by Bill McColl in 18th SIAM Conference on Parallel Processing for Scientific Computing (2018), http://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_talk.cfm?p=88973.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The model==

A BSP computer consists of
# components capable of processing and/or local memory transactions (i.e., processors),
# a network that routes messages between pairs of such components, and
# a hardware facility that allows for the synchronisation of all or a subset of components.
This is commonly interpreted as a set of processors which may follow different [[thread (computer science)|threads]] of computation, with each processor equipped with fast local memory and interconnected by a communication network.
A BSP algorithm relies heavily on the third feature; a computation proceeds in a series of global ''supersteps'', which consists of three components:
* ''Concurrent computation'': every participating processor may perform local computations, i.e., each process can only make use of values stored in the local fast memory of the processor. The computations occur asynchronously of all the others but may overlap with communication.
* ''Communication'': The processes exchange data between themselves to facilitate remote data storage capabilities.
* ''[[Barrier (computer science)|Barrier synchronisation]]'': When a process reaches this point (the ''barrier''), it waits until all other processes have reached the same barrier.

The computation and communication actions do not have to be ordered in time. Communication typically takes the form of the one-sided ''put'' and ''get'' Direct Remote Memory Access (DRMA) calls, rather than paired two-sided ''send'' and ''receive'' message passing calls.
The barrier synchronization concludes the superstep: it ensures that all one-sided communications are properly concluded. Systems based  on two-sided communication include this synchronisation cost implicitly for every message sent. The method for barrier synchronisation relies on the hardware facility of the BSP computer. In Valiant's original paper,&lt;ref name="CACM_Valiant"/&gt; this facility periodically checks if the end of the current superstep is reached globally. The period of this check is denoted by &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;.

The figure below shows this in a [[diagrammatic form]]. The processes are not regarded as having a particular linear order (from left to right or otherwise), and may be mapped to processors in any way.

[[Image:bsp.wiki.fig1.svg|thumb|400px]]

The BSP model is also well-suited to enable automatic memory management for distributed-memory computing through overdecomposition of the problem and oversubscription of the processors. The computation is divided into more logical processes than there are physical processors, and processes are randomly assigned to processors. This strategy can be shown statistically to lead to almost perfect load balancing, both of work and communication.

==Communication==
In many parallel programming systems, communications are considered at the level of individual actions: sending and receiving a message, memory to memory transfer, etc. This is difficult to work with, since there are many simultaneous communication actions in a parallel program, and their interactions are typically complex. In particular, it is difficult to say much about the time any single communication action will take to complete.

The BSP model considers communication actions ''en masse''. This has the effect that an upper bound on the time taken to communicate a set of data can be given. BSP considers all communication actions of a superstep as one unit, and assumes all individual messages sent as part of this unit have a fixed size.

The maximum number of incoming or outgoing messages for a superstep is denoted by &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;. The ability of a communication network to deliver data is captured by a parameter &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, defined such that it takes time &lt;math&gt;hg&lt;/math&gt; for a processor to deliver &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; messages of size 1.

A message of length &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; obviously takes longer to send than a message of size 1.  However, the BSP model does not make a distinction between a message length of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; messages of length 1. In either case the cost is said to be &lt;math&gt;mg&lt;/math&gt;.

The parameter &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is dependent on the following factors:
* The protocols used to interact within the communication network.
* Buffer management by both the processors and the communication network.
* The routing strategy used in the network.
* The BSP runtime system.

In practice, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is determined empirically for each parallel computer. Note that &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is not the normalised single-word delivery time, but the single-word delivery time under continuous traffic conditions.

==Barriers==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2013}}

The one-sided communication of the BSP model requires [[Barrier (computer science)|barrier synchronization]]. 
[[Barrier (computer science)|Barriers]] are potentially costly, but avoid the possibility of [[deadlock]] or [[Deadlock|livelock]], 
since barriers cannot create circular data dependencies.&lt;!-- link to deadlock detection? --&gt; Tools to detect them and deal with them are unnecessary. Barriers also permit novel forms of [[Fault-tolerant system|fault tolerance]]{{Citation needed|reason=Checkpointing is an obvious example, but this is not novel. What is being referred to here?|date=February 2014}}.

The cost of barrier synchronization is influenced by a couple of issues:
# The cost imposed by the variation in the completion time of the participating concurrent computations. Take the example where all but one of the processes have completed their work for this superstep, and are waiting for the last process, which still has a lot of work to complete. The best that an implementation can do is ensure that each process works on roughly the same problem size.
# The cost of reaching a globally consistent state in all of the processors. This depends on the communication network, but also on whether there is special-purpose hardware available for synchronizing, and on the way in which interrupts are handled by processors.

The cost of a barrier synchronization is denoted by &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt;l&lt;L&lt;/math&gt; if the synchronisation mechanism of the BSP computer is as suggested by Valiant.&lt;ref name=CACM_Valiant/&gt; 
&lt;!-- What could you measure to determine l? --&gt;
In practice, a value of &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is determined empirically.

On large computers barriers are expensive, and this is increasingly so on large scales. There is a large body of literature on removing synchronization points from existing algorithms, both in the context of BSP computing and beyond. For example, many algorithms allow for the local detection of the global end of a superstep simply by comparing local information to the number of messages already received. This drives the cost of a global synchronisation, compared to the minimally required latency of communication, to zero.&lt;ref name="Alpert"&gt;Alpert, R., &amp; Philbin, J. (1997). cBSP: Zero-cost synchronization in a modified BSP model. NEC Research Institute, 4 Independence Way, Princeton NJ, 8540, [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.36.7784&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; Yet also this minimal latency is expected to increase further for future supercomputer architectures and network interconnects; the BSP model, along with other models for parallel computation, require adaptation to cope with this trend. Multi-BSP&lt;ref name=JCSS_Valiant/&gt; is one BSP-based solution.

==The cost of a BSP algorithm==
The cost of a superstep is determined as the sum of three terms;  the cost of the longest running local computation, the cost of global communication between the processors, and the cost of the barrier synchronisation at the end of the superstep. The cost of one superstep
for &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; processors:

&lt;math&gt;
max_{i = 1}^{p}(w_i) + max_{i=1}^{p}(h_i g) + l 
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; is the cost for the local computation in process &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;h_i&lt;/math&gt; is the number of messages sent or received by process &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that homogeneous processors are assumed here. It is more common for the expression to be written as &lt;math&gt;w + hg + l&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; are maxima. The cost of the algorithm then, is the sum of the costs of each superstep.

&lt;math&gt;
W + Hg + Sl = \sum_{s=1}^{S}w_s + g \sum_{s=1}^{S}h_s + Sl
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the number of supersteps.

&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; are usually modelled as functions, that vary with problem size. These three characteristics of a BSP algorithm are usually described in terms of [[asymptotic notation]], e.g. &lt;math&gt;H \in O(n/p)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Extensions and uses==

Interest in BSP has soared in recent years, with Google adopting it as a major technology for graph analytics at massive scale via technologies like Pregel and MapReduce. Also, with the next generation of Hadoop decoupling the MapReduce model from the rest of the Hadoop infrastructure, there are now active open source projects to add explicit BSP programming, as well as other high performance parallel programming models, on top of Hadoop. Examples are [[Apache Hama]]&lt;ref name="hama"&gt;[http://hama.apache.org/ Apache Hama]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Apache Giraph]].

BSP has been extended by many authors to address concerns about BSP's unsuitability for modelling specific architectures or computational paradigms. One example of this is the decomposable BSP model. The model has also been used in the creation of a number of new programming languages and interfaces, such as Bulk Synchronous Parallel ML (BSML), BSPLib,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsp-worldwide.org/implmnts/oxtool/bsplib.html BSPlib]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apache Hama]],&lt;ref name="hama"/&gt; and Pregel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1582723 Pregel]&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable implementations of the BSPLib standard are the Paderborn University BSP library&lt;ref name=PUB&gt;The Paderborn University BSP (PUB) Library - Design, Implementation and Performance

MulticoreBSP for C is especially notable for its capability of starting nested BSP runs, thus allowing for explicit Multi-BSP programming.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5924">In [[computational geometry]], a '''CC system''' or '''counterclockwise system''' is a [[ternary relation]] {{math|''pqr''}} introduced by [[Donald Knuth]] to model the clockwise ordering of triples of points in [[general position]] in the [[Euclidean plane]].{{sfnp|Knuth|1992}}

==Axioms==
A CC system is required to satisfy the following axioms, for all distinct points ''p'', ''q'', ''r'', ''s'', and ''t'':{{sfnp|Knuth|1992|p=4}}

# Cyclic symmetry: If {{math|''pqr''}} then {{math|''qrp''}}.
# Antisymmetry: If {{math|''pqr''}} then not {{math|''prq''}}.
# Nondegeneracy: Either {{math|''pqr''}} or {{math|''prq''}}.
# Interiority: If {{math|''tqr''}} and {{math|''ptr''}} and {{math|''pqt''}}, then {{math|''pqr''}}.
# Transitivity: If {{math|''tsp''}} and {{math|''tsq''}} and {{math|''tsr''}}, and {{math|''tpq''}} and {{math|''tqr''}}, then {{math|''tpr''}}.

Triples of points that are not distinct are not considered as part of the relation.

==Construction from planar point sets==
A CC system may be defined from any set of points in the [[Euclidean plane]], with no three of the points collinear, by including in the relation a triple {{math|''pqr''}} of distinct points whenever the triple lists these three points in counterclockwise order around the triangle that they form. Using the [[Cartesian coordinate]]s of the points, the triple ''pqr'' is included in the relation exactly when{{sfnp|Knuth|1992|p=3}}
:&lt;math&gt;\det\left( \begin{array}{ccc}
x_p &amp; y_p &amp; 1 \\
x_q &amp; y_q &amp; 1 \\
x_r &amp; y_r &amp; 1 \end{array} \right) &gt; 0.&lt;/math&gt;
The condition that the points are in general position is equivalent to the requirement that this matrix [[determinant]] is never zero for distinct points ''p'', ''q'', and ''r''.

However, not every CC system comes from a Euclidean point set in this way.{{sfnp|Knuth|1992|pp=25–26}}

==Equivalent notions==
CC systems can also be defined from [[Arrangement of lines|pseudoline arrangement]]s, or from [[sorting network]]s in which the compare-exchange operations only compare adjacent pairs of elements (as in for instance [[bubble sort]]), and every CC system can be defined in this way.{{sfnp|Knuth|1992|pp=29–35}} This relation is not one-to-one, but the numbers of nonisomorphic CC systems on ''n'' points, of pseudoline arrangements with ''n'' lines, and of sorting networks on ''n'' values, are within polynomial factors of each other.{{sfnp|Knuth|1992|p=35}}

There exists a two-to-one correspondence between CC systems and uniform acyclic [[oriented matroid]]s of [[matroid rank|rank]] 3.{{sfnp|Knuth|1992|p=40}} These matroids in turn have a 1-1 correspondence to topological equivalence classes of pseudoline arrangements with one marked cell.{{sfnp|Knuth|1992|p=35}}

==Algorithmic applications==
The information given by a CC system is sufficient to define a notion of a [[convex hull]] within a CC system. The convex hull is the set of ordered pairs ''pq'' of distinct points with the property that, for every third distinct point ''r'', ''pqr'' belongs to the system. It forms a cycle, with the property that every three points of the cycle, in the same cyclic order, belong to the system.{{sfnp|Knuth|1992|pp=45–46}} By adding points one at a time to a CC system, and maintaining the convex hull of the points added so far in its cyclic order using a [[binary search tree]], it is possible to construct the convex hull in time ''O''(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n''), matching the known time bounds for convex hull algorithms for Euclidean points.{{sfnp|Knuth|1992|p=47}}

It is also possible to find a single convex hull vertex, as well as the combinatorial equivalent of a bisecting line through a system of points, from a CC system in [[linear time]]. The construction of an extreme vertex allows the [[Graham scan]] algorithm for convex hulls to be generalized from point sets to CC systems, with a number of queries to the CC system that matches (to within lower-order terms) the number of comparisons needed in [[comparison sort]]ing.{{sfnp|Aichholzer|Miltzow|Pilz|2013}}

==Combinatorial enumeration==
The number of non-isomorphic CC systems on ''n'' points is{{sfnp|Knuth|1992|p=35}}{{sfnp|Beygelzimer|Radziszowski|2002}}
:1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 20, 242, 6405, 316835, 28627261 ... {{OEIS|A006246}}

These numbers grow exponentially in ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;;{{sfnp|Knuth|1992|p=37}} in contrast, the number of realizable CC systems grows exponentially only in &amp;Theta;(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'').{{sfnp|Knuth|1992|p=40}}

More precisely, the number ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' of non-isomorphic CC systems on ''n'' points is at most{{sfnp|Knuth|1992|p=39}}
:&lt;math&gt;3^{\binom{n}{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;
Knuth conjectures more strongly that these numbers obey the recursive inequality
:&lt;math&gt;C_n\le n2^{n-2} C_{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

{{refimprove|date=March 2016}}

In [[mathematics]], the '''Cauchy principal value''', named after [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]], is a method for assigning values to certain [[improper integral]]s which would otherwise be undefined.

==Formulation==

Depending on the type of [[Mathematical singularity|singularity]] in the integrand ''f'', the Cauchy principal value is defined according to the following rules:

:'''1) For a singularity at the finite number ''b'':'''

:::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0^+} \left[\int_a^{b-\varepsilon} f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x+\int_{b+\varepsilon}^c f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x\right]&lt;/math&gt;

::where ''b'' is a point at which the behavior of the function ''f'' is such that

:::&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x=\pm\infty&lt;/math&gt; for any ''a'' &lt; ''b'' and

:::&lt;math&gt;\int_b^c f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x=\mp\infty&lt;/math&gt; for any ''c'' &gt; ''b'' 
:::(see [[Plus-minus sign#Minus-plus sign|plus or minus]] for precise usage of notations&amp;nbsp;±,&amp;nbsp;∓).

:'''2)  For a singularity at infinity:'''

:::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{a\rightarrow\infty}\int_{-a}^a f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt;

:::where &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^0 f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x=\pm\infty&lt;/math&gt;

:::and &lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x=\mp\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

In some cases it is necessary to deal simultaneously with singularities both at a finite number ''b'' and at infinity.  This is usually done by a limit of the form

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\varepsilon \rightarrow 0^+} \left[\int_{b-\frac{1}{\varepsilon}}^{b-\varepsilon} f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x+\int_{b+\varepsilon}^{b+\frac{1}{\varepsilon}}f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x \right].&lt;/math&gt;
 
The Cauchy principal value can also be defined in terms of [[Methods of contour integration|contour integrals]] of a complex-valued function ''f''(''z''); ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''iy'', with a pole on a contour ''C''. Define  ''C''(''ε'') to be the same contour where the portion inside the disk of radius ''ε'' around the pole has been removed. Provided the function ''f''(''z'') is integrable over ''C(ε)'' no matter how small ε becomes, then the Cauchy principal value is the limit:&lt;ref name=Kanwal&gt;{{cite book |author= Ram P. Kanwal |title=Linear Integral Equations: theory and technique |page= 191 |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=-bV9Qn8NpCYC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;lpg=PA194&amp;dq=+%22Poincar%C3%A9-Bertrand+transformation%22#PPA191,M1
|isbn=0-8176-3940-3 |year=1996 |publisher=Birkhäuser |location=Boston |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \int_{C} f(z) \ \mathrm{d}z = \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0^+} \int_{C( \varepsilon)} f(z)\ \mathrm{d}z, &lt;/math&gt;

In the case of [[Lebesgue integral|Lebesgue-integrable]] functions, that is, functions which are integrable in [[absolute value]], these definitions coincide with the standard definition of the integral.

If the function ''f''(''z'') is [[meromorphic]], the [[Sokhotski–Plemelj theorem]] relates the principal value of the integral over ''C'' with the mean-value of the integrals with the contour displaced slightly above and below, so that the [[residue theorem]] can be applied to those integrals.

Principal value integrals play a central role in the discussion of Hilbert transforms.&lt;ref name=King&gt;{{cite book |author= Frederick W. King |title = Hilbert Transforms|isbn=978-0-521-88762-5 |year=2009| publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution theory ==

Let &lt;math&gt; {C_{c}^{\infty}}(\mathbb{R}) &lt;/math&gt; be the set of [[bump function]]s, i.e., the space of [[smooth function]]s with [[compact support]] on the [[real number|real line]] &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;. Then the map

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{p.\!v.} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \,:\, {C_{c}^{\infty}}(\mathbb{R}) \to \mathbb{C} &lt;/math&gt;

defined via the Cauchy principal value as

:&lt;math&gt; \left[ \operatorname{p.\!v.} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right](u) = \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0^{+}} \int_{\mathbb{R} \setminus [- \varepsilon;\varepsilon]} \frac{u(x)}{x} \, \mathrm{d} x = \int_{0}^{+ \infty} \frac{u(x) - u(- x)}{x} \, \mathrm{d} x \quad \text{for } u \in {C_{c}^{\infty}}(\mathbb{R}) &lt;/math&gt;

is a [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]]. The map itself may sometimes be called the '''principal value''' (hence the notation '''p.v.'''). This distribution appears, for example, in the Fourier transform of the [[Sign function]] and the [[Heaviside step function]].

===Well-definedness as a distribution===
To prove the existence of the limit 
:&lt;math&gt; \int_{0}^{+ \infty} \frac{u(x) - u(- x)}{x} \, \mathrm{d} x &lt;/math&gt;
for a [[Schwartz function]] &lt;math&gt; u(x) &lt;/math&gt;, first observe that &lt;math&gt; \frac{u(x) - u(-x)}{x} &lt;/math&gt;  is continuous on  &lt;math&gt; [0, \infty) &lt;/math&gt;, as
 
:&lt;math&gt; \lim\limits_{x \searrow 0} u(x) - u(-x) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;  and hence 
:&lt;math&gt; \lim\limits_{x\searrow 0} \frac{u(x) - u(-x)}{x} = \lim\limits_{x\searrow 0} \frac{u'(x) + u'(-x)}{1} = 2u'(0), &lt;/math&gt;

since &lt;math&gt; u'(x) &lt;/math&gt; is continuous and [[L'Hospital's rule]] applies.

Therefore,  &lt;math&gt; \int\limits_0^1 \frac{u(x) - u(-x)}{x} \, \mathrm dx&lt;/math&gt; exists and by applying the [[mean value theorem]] to &lt;math&gt; u(x) - u(-x) &lt;/math&gt;, we get that

:&lt;math&gt; \left| \int\limits_0^1 \frac{u(x) - u(-x)}{x} \,\mathrm dx \right| \leq \int\limits_0^1 \frac{|u(x)-u(-x)|}{x} \,\mathrm dx  \leq \int\limits_0^1 \frac{2x}{x} \sup\limits_{x \in \mathbb R} |u'(x)| \,\mathrm dx \leq 2 \sup\limits_{x \in \mathbb R} |u'(x)| &lt;/math&gt;.

As furthermore

:&lt;math&gt; \left| \int\limits_1^\infty \frac {u(x) - u(-x)}{x} \,\mathrm dx \right| \leq 2 \sup\limits_{x\in\mathbb R} |x\cdot u(x)| \int\limits_1^\infty \frac 1{x^2} \,\mathrm dx = 2 \sup\limits_{x\in\mathbb R} |x\cdot u(x)|, &lt;/math&gt;

we note that the map &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{p.\!v.} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \,:\, {C_{c}^{\infty}}(\mathbb{R}) \to \mathbb{C} &lt;/math&gt; is bounded by the usual seminorms for [[Schwartz functions]] &lt;math&gt; u&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, this map defines, as it is obviously linear, a continuous functional on the [[Schwartz space]] and therefore a [[distribution (mathematics)#Tempered distributions and Fourier transform|tempered distribution]].

Note that the proof needs &lt;math&gt; u&lt;/math&gt; merely to be continuously differentiable in a neighbourhood of &lt;math&gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; xu&lt;/math&gt; to be bounded towards infinity. The principal value therefore is defined on even weaker assumptions such as  &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt; integrable with compact support and differentiable at 0.

===More general definitions===

The principal value is the inverse distribution of the function &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; and is almost the only distribution with this property:
:&lt;math&gt; x f = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad f = \operatorname{p.\!v.} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) + K \delta, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; K &lt;/math&gt; is a constant and &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; the Dirac distribution.

In a broader sense, the principal value can be defined for a wide class of [[singular integral]] [[integral kernel|kernels]] on the Euclidean space &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^{n} &lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt; K &lt;/math&gt; has an isolated singularity at the origin, but is an otherwise "nice" function, then the principal-value distribution is defined on compactly supported smooth functions by
:&lt;math&gt; [\operatorname{p.\!v.} (K)](f) = \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \int_{\mathbb{R}^{n} \setminus B_{\varepsilon(0)}} f(x) K(x) \, \mathrm{d} x. &lt;/math&gt;
Such a limit may not be well defined, or, being well-defined, it may not necessarily define a distribution. It is, however, well-defined if &lt;math&gt; K &lt;/math&gt; is a continuous [[homogeneous function]] of degree &lt;math&gt; -n &lt;/math&gt; whose integral over any sphere centered at the origin vanishes. This is the case, for instance, with the [[Riesz transform]]s.

==Examples==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
Consider the difference in values of two limits:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{a\rightarrow 0+}\left(\int_{-1}^{-a}\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{x}+\int_a^1\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{x}\right)=0,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{a\rightarrow 0+}\left(\int_{-1}^{-2 a}\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{x}+\int_{a}^1\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{x}\right)=\ln 2.&lt;/math&gt;

The former is the Cauchy principal value of the otherwise ill-defined expression

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-1}^1\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{x}{\  }
\left(\mbox{which}\  \mbox{gives}\  -\infty+\infty\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{a\rightarrow\infty}\int_{-a}^a\frac{2x\,\mathrm{d}x}{x^2+1}=0,&lt;/math&gt;

but

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{a\rightarrow\infty}\int_{-2a}^a\frac{2x\,\mathrm{d}x}{x^2+1}=-\ln 4.&lt;/math&gt;

The former is the principal value of the otherwise ill-defined expression

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{2x\,\mathrm{d}x}{x^2+1}{\  }
\left(\mbox{which}\  \mbox{gives}\  -\infty+\infty\right).&lt;/math&gt;

==Notation==

Different authors use different notations for the Cauchy principal value of a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, among others:

: &lt;math&gt;PV \int f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x,&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{p.v.} \int f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x,&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\int_L^*  f(z)\, \mathrm{d}z,&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; -\!\!\!\!\!\!\int f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x,&lt;/math&gt;

: as well as &lt;math&gt;P,&lt;/math&gt; P.V., &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P},&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;P_v,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(CPV),&lt;/math&gt; and&amp;nbsp;V.P.

'''Chain linking''' is a statistical method, defined by the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] as:

{{quote|text=Joining together two indices that overlap in one period by rescaling one of them to make its value equal to that of the other in the same period, thus combining them into single time series. More complex methods may be used to link together indices that overlap by more than period.|sign=Glossary of Statistical Terms|source=[http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=5605 OECD]}}

Chain linking is popularly used with [[GDP]]/[[GNP]] data, to measure changes over time, giving a [[chained volume series]].&lt;ref&gt;United States, Bureau of Economic Analysis, [https://www.bea.gov/national/pdf/NIPAhandbookch1-4.pdf ''Concepts and methods of the United States National Income and Production Accounts''], {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108104038/https://www.bea.gov/national/pdf/NIPAhandbookch1-4.pdf# |date=2017-11-08 }} July 2008. Chapter 4, pages 11 - 23 contains much information on the chain linking method, including mathematical principles.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3833">In [[mathematics]], particularly in [[set theory]], if &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Regular cardinal|regular]] [[uncountable]] [[Cardinal number|cardinal]] then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{club}(\kappa)&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Filter (mathematics)|filter]] of all [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] containing a [[Club set|club subset]] of &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;, is a &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-complete filter closed under [[diagonal intersection]] called the '''club filter'''.

To see that this is a filter, note that &lt;math&gt;\kappa\in\operatorname{club}(\kappa)&lt;/math&gt; since it is thus both closed and unbounded (see [[club set]]). If &lt;math&gt;x\in\operatorname{club}(\kappa)&lt;/math&gt; then any [[subset]] of &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is also in &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{club}(\kappa)&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore anything containing it, contains a club set.

It is a &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-complete filter because the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of fewer than &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; club sets is a club set. To see this, suppose &lt;math&gt;\langle C_i\rangle_{i&lt;\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[sequence]] of club sets where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;. Obviously &lt;math&gt;C=\bigcap C_i&lt;/math&gt; is closed, since any sequence which appears in &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; appears in every &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore its [[Direct limit|limit]] is also in every &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt;. To show that it is unbounded, take some &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\langle \beta_{1,i}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; be an increasing sequence with &lt;math&gt;\beta_{1,1}&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_{1,i}\in C_i&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;i&lt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. Such a sequence can be constructed, since every &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt; is unbounded. Since &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is regular, the limit of this sequence is less than &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;. We call it &lt;math&gt;\beta_2&lt;/math&gt;, and define a new sequence &lt;math&gt;\langle\beta_{2,i}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; similar to the previous sequence. We can repeat this process, getting a sequence of sequences &lt;math&gt;\langle\beta_{j,i}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; where each element of a sequence is greater than every member of the previous sequences. Then for each &lt;math&gt;i&lt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\langle\beta_{j,i}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is an increasing sequence contained in &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt;, and all these sequences have the same limit (the limit of &lt;math&gt;\langle\beta_{j,i}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;). This limit is then contained in every &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, and is greater than &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

To see that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{club}(\kappa)&lt;/math&gt; is closed under diagonal intersection, let &lt;math&gt;\langle C_i\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i&lt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of club sets, and let &lt;math&gt;C=\Delta_{i&lt;\kappa} C_i&lt;/math&gt;. To show &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is closed, suppose &lt;math&gt;S\subseteq \alpha&lt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bigcup S=\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. Then for each &lt;math&gt;\gamma\in S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma\in C_\beta&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;.  Since each &lt;math&gt;C_\beta&lt;/math&gt; is closed, &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in C_\beta&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in C&lt;/math&gt;. To show &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is unbounded, let &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;, and define a sequence &lt;math&gt;\xi_i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i&lt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; as follows: &lt;math&gt;\xi_0=\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\xi_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; is the minimal element of &lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{\gamma&lt;\xi_i}C_\gamma&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\xi_{i+1}&gt;\xi_i&lt;/math&gt;.  Such an element exists since by the above, the intersection of &lt;math&gt;\xi_i&lt;/math&gt; club sets is club. Then &lt;math&gt;\xi=\bigcup_{i&lt;\omega}\xi_i&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\xi\in C&lt;/math&gt;, since it is in each &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;i&lt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1683">In [[mathematics]], a [[series (mathematics)|series]] or [[integral]] is said to be '''conditionally convergent''' if it converges, but it does not [[Absolute convergence|converge absolutely]].

==Definition==
More precisely, a series &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; is said to '''converge conditionally''' if 
&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\lim_{m\rightarrow\infty}\,\sum_{n=0}^m a_n&lt;/math&gt; exists and is a finite number (not &amp;infin; or &amp;minus;&amp;infin;), but &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty \left|a_n\right| = \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

A classic example is the [[alternating series]] given by &lt;math display="block"&gt;1 - {1 \over 2} + {1 \over 3} - {1 \over 4} + {1 \over 5} - \cdots =\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty {(-1)^{n+1}  \over n},&lt;/math&gt; which converges to  &lt;math&gt;\ln (2)&lt;/math&gt;, but is not absolutely convergent (see [[Harmonic series (mathematics)|Harmonic series]]).

[[Bernhard Riemann]] proved that a conditionally convergent series of real numbers may be rearranged to converge to any value at all, including &amp;infin; or &amp;minus;&amp;infin;; see ''[[Riemann series theorem]]''. The [[Lévy–Steinitz theorem]] identifies the set of values to which a series of terms in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; can converge.

A typical conditionally convergent integral is that on the non-negative real axis of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sin (x^2)&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Fresnel integral]]).

By definition, a (real) ''1-cycle'' on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a formal [[linear combination]] &lt;math&gt;C=\sum a_iC_i&lt;/math&gt; of irreducible, reduced and proper curves &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt;, with coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_i \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. ''Numerical equivalence'' of 1-cycles is defined by intersections: two 1-cycles &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt; are numerically equivalent if &lt;math&gt;C \cdot D = C' \cdot D&lt;/math&gt; for every Cartier [[Divisor (algebraic geometry)|divisor]] &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Denote the [[real vector space]] of 1-cycles modulo numerical equivalence by &lt;math&gt;N_1(X)&lt;/math&gt;.

We define the ''cone of curves'' of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to be

: &lt;math&gt;NE(X) = \left\{\sum a_i[C_i], \ 0 \leq a_i \in \mathbb{R} \right\} &lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt; are irreducible, reduced, proper curves on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;[C_i]&lt;/math&gt; their classes in &lt;math&gt;N_1(X)&lt;/math&gt;. It is not difficult to see that &lt;math&gt;NE(X)&lt;/math&gt; is indeed a [[Cone_(linear_algebra)#Convex_cone|convex cone]] in the sense of convex geometry.

==Applications==
One useful application of the notion of the cone of curves is the '''[[Steven Kleiman|Kleiman]] condition''', which says that a (Cartier) divisor &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; on a complete variety &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is [[ample line bundle|ample]] if and only if &lt;math&gt;D \cdot x &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; for any nonzero element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\overline{NE(X)}&lt;/math&gt;, the closure of the cone of curves in the usual real topology. (In general, &lt;math&gt;NE(X)&lt;/math&gt; need not be closed, so taking the closure here is important.)

A more involved example is the role played by the cone of curves in the theory of [[minimal model (birational geometry)|minimal model]]s of algebraic varieties. Briefly, the goal of that theory is as follows: given a (mildly singular) projective variety &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, find a (mildly singular) variety &lt;math&gt;X'&lt;/math&gt; which is [[birational]] to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and whose [[canonical divisor]] &lt;math&gt;K_{X'}&lt;/math&gt; is [[numerically effective|nef]]. The great breakthrough of the early 1980s (due to [[Shigefumi Mori|Mori]] and others) was to construct (at least morally) the necessary birational map from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;X'&lt;/math&gt; as a sequence of steps, each of which can be thought of as contraction of a &lt;math&gt;K_X&lt;/math&gt;-negative extremal ray of &lt;math&gt;NE(X)&lt;/math&gt;. This process encounters difficulties, however, whose resolution necessitates the introduction of the [[flip (algebraic geometry)|flip]].

==A structure theorem==
The above process of contractions could not proceed without the fundamental result on the structure of the cone of curves known as the '''Cone Theorem'''. The first version of this theorem, for [[smooth varieties]], is due to [[Shigefumi Mori|Mori]]; it was later generalised to a larger class of varieties by [[János_Kollár|Kollár]], [[Miles Reid|Reid]], [[Vyacheslav_Shokurov|Shokurov]], and others. Mori's version of the theorem is as follows:

'''Cone Theorem.''' Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a smooth [[projective variety]]. Then

1. There are [[countably many]] [[rational curve]]s &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, satisfying &lt;math&gt;0&lt; -K_X \cdot C_i \leq \operatorname{dim} X +1 &lt;/math&gt;, and 

: &lt;math&gt;\overline{NE(X)} = \overline{NE(X)}_{K_X\geq 0} + \sum_i \mathbf{R}_{\geq0} [C_i].&lt;/math&gt;

2. For any positive real number &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and any [[ample divisor]] &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt;\overline{NE(X)} = \overline{NE(X)}_{K_X+\epsilon H\geq0} + \sum \mathbf{R}_{\geq0} [C_i],&lt;/math&gt;

where the sum in the last term is finite.

The first assertion says that, in the [[closed half-space]] of &lt;math&gt;N_1(X)&lt;/math&gt; where intersection with &lt;math&gt;K_X&lt;/math&gt; is nonnegative, we know nothing, but in the complementary half-space, the cone is spanned by some countable collection of curves which are quite special: they are [[Rational variety|rational]], and their 'degree' is bounded very tightly by the dimension of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. The second assertion then tells us more: it says that, away from the hyperplane &lt;math&gt;\{C : K_X \cdot C = 0\}&lt;/math&gt;, extremal rays of the cone cannot accumulate. 

If in addition the variety &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is defined over a field of characteristic 0, we have the following assertion, sometimes referred to as the '''Contraction Theorem''':

3. Let &lt;math&gt;F \subset \overline{NE(X)}&lt;/math&gt; be an extremal face of the cone of curves on which &lt;math&gt;K_X&lt;/math&gt; is negative. Then there is a unique [[morphism]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{cont}_F : X \rightarrow Z&lt;/math&gt; to a projective variety ''Z'', such that &lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{cont}_F)_* \mathcal{O}_X = \mathcal{O}_Z&lt;/math&gt; and an irreducible curve &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is mapped to a point by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{cont}_F&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;[C] \in F&lt;/math&gt;.
(See also: [[contraction morphism]]).

A '''cross-figure''' (also variously called '''cross number puzzle''' or '''figure logic''') is a [[puzzle]] similar to a [[crossword]] in structure, but with entries which consist of numbers rather than words, with individual digits being entered in the blank cells. The numbers can be clued in various ways:

* The clue can make it possible to find the number required directly, by using general knowledge (e.g. "Date of the Battle of Hastings") or arithmetic (e.g. "27 times 79") or other mathematical facts (e.g. "Seventh prime number")
* The clue may require arithmetic to be applied to another answer or answers (e.g. "25 across times 3" or "9 down minus 3 across")
* The clue may indicate possible answers but make it impossible to give the correct one without using [[crosslight]]s (e.g. "A prime number")
* One answer may be related to another in a non-determinate way (e.g. "A multiple of 24 down" or "5 across with its digits rearranged")
* Some entries may either not be clued at all, or refer to another clue (e.g. 7 down may be clued as "See 13 down" if 13 down reads "7 down plus 5")
* Entries may be grouped together for clueing purposes, e.g. "1 across, 12 across and 17 across together contain all the digits except 0"
* Some cross-figures use an algebraic type of clue, with various letters taking unknown values (e.g. "A - 2B, where neither A nor B is known in advance)
* Another special type of puzzle uses a real-world situation such as a family outing and base most clues on this (e.g. "Time taken to travel from Ayville to Beetown")

Cross-figures which use mostly the first type of clue may be used for educational purposes, but most enthusiasts would agree that this clue type should be used rarely, if at all. Without this type a cross-figure may superficially seem to be impossible to solve, since no answer can apparently be filled in until another has first been found, which without the first type of clue appears impossible. However, if a different approach is adopted where, instead of trying to find complete answers (as would be done for a crossword) one gradually narrows down the possibilities for individual cells (or, in some cases, whole answers) then the problem becomes tractable. For example, if 12 across and 7 down both have three digits and the clue for 12 across is "7 down times 2", one can work out that (i) the last digit of 12 across must be even, (ii) the first digit of 7 down must be 1, 2, 3 or 4, and (iii) the first digit of 12 across must be between 2 and 9 inclusive. (It is an implicit rule of cross-figures that numbers cannot start with 0; however, some puzzles explicitly allow this) By continuing to apply this sort of argument, a solution can eventually be found. Another implicit rule of cross-figures is that no two answers should be the same (in cross-figures allowing numbers to start with 0, 0123 and 123 may be considered different.)

A curious feature of cross-figures is that it makes perfect sense for the setter of a puzzle to try to solve it him or herself. Indeed, the setter should ideally do this (without direct reference to the answer) as it is essentially the only way to find out if the puzzle has a single unique solution. Alternatively, there are computer programs available that can be used for this purpose; however, they may not make it clear how difficult the puzzle is. 

Given that some basic mathematical knowledge is needed to solve cross-figures, they are much less popular than crosswords. As a result, very few books of them have ever been published. [[Dell Magazines]] publishes a magazine called ''[[Math Puzzles and Logic Problems]]'' six times a year which generally contains as many as a dozen of these puzzles, which they name "Figure Logics". A magazine called ''Figure it Out'', which was dedicated to number puzzles, included some, but it was very short-lived. This also explains why cross-figures have fewer established conventions than crosswords (especially cryptic crosswords). One exception is the use of the semicolon (;) to attach two strings of numbers together, for example 1234;5678 becomes 12345678. Some cross-figures voluntarily ignore this option and other "non-mathematical" approaches (e.g. [[palindromic number]]s and [[repunit]]s) where same result can be achieved through algebraic means.

Informally, the Damerau–Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of operations (consisting of insertions, deletions or substitutions of a single character, or [[transposition (mathematics)|transposition]] of two adjacent characters) required to change one word into the other.

The Damerau–Levenshtein distance differs from the classical [[Levenshtein distance]] by including transpositions among its allowable operations in addition to the three classical single-character edit operations (insertions, deletions and substitutions).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Levenshtein|first=Vladimir I.|title=Binary codes capable of correcting deletions, insertions, and reversals|date=February 1966|url=&lt;!-- copylink? http://profs.sci.univr.it/~liptak/ALBioinfo/files/levenshtein66.pdf--&gt;|journal=Soviet Physics Doklady|volume=10|issue=8|pages=707–710}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bard" /&gt;

== Definition ==
To express the Damerau–Levenshtein distance between two strings &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; a function &lt;math&gt;d_{a,b}(i,j)&lt;/math&gt; is defined, whose value is a distance between an &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;–symbol prefix (initial substring) of string &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and a &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;–symbol prefix of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''restricted distance'' function is defined recursively as:,&lt;ref name="Boytsov" /&gt;{{rp|A:11}}

&lt;math&gt;\qquad d_{a,b}(i,j) = 
\min 
\begin{cases}
0 &amp; \text{if } i = j = 0 \\
d_{a,b}(i-1,j) + 1 &amp; \text{if } i &gt; 0 \\
d_{a,b}(i,j-1) + 1 &amp; \text{if } j &gt; 0 \\
d_{a,b}(i-1,j-1) + 1_{(a_i \neq b_j)} &amp;  \text{if } i, j &gt; 0\\
d_{a,b}(i-2,j-2) + 1 &amp; \text{if } i, j &gt; 1 \text{ and } a[i] = b[j-1] \text{ and } a[i-1] = b[j]\\
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt;1_{(a_i \neq b_j)}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[indicator function]] equal to 0 when  &lt;math&gt;a_i = b_j&lt;/math&gt; and equal to 1 otherwise.

Each recursive call matches one of the cases covered by the Damerau–Levenshtein distance:
* &lt;math&gt;d_{a,b}(i-1,j) + 1&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to a deletion (from a to b).
* &lt;math&gt;d_{a,b}(i,j-1) + 1&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to an insertion (from a to b).
* &lt;math&gt;d_{a,b}(i-1,j-1) + 1_{(a_i \neq b_j)} &lt;/math&gt; corresponds to a match or mismatch, depending on whether the respective symbols are the same.
* &lt;math&gt;d_{a,b}(i-2,j-2) + 1 &lt;/math&gt; corresponds to a [[transposition (mathematics)|transposition]] between two successive symbols.

The Damerau–Levenshtein distance between {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} is then given by the function value for full strings: &lt;math&gt;d_{a,b}(|a|,|b|)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;i=|a|&lt;/math&gt; denotes the length of string {{mvar|a}} and &lt;math&gt;j=|b|&lt;/math&gt; is the length of {{mvar|b}}.

== Algorithm ==
Presented here are two algorithms: the first,&lt;ref name="oommen"&gt;{{cite journal |first1= B. J. |last1=Oommen |first2=R. K. S. |last2=Loke |title=Pattern recognition of strings with substitutions, insertions, deletions and generalized transpositions |citeseerx=10.1.1.50.1459 |doi=10.1016/S0031-3203(96)00101-X |volume=30 |journal=Pattern Recognition |pages=789–800}}&lt;/ref&gt; simpler one, computes what is known as the ''optimal string alignment distance'' or ''restricted edit distance'',&lt;ref name="Boytsov"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boytsov |first=Leonid |title=Indexing methods for approximate dictionary searching |journal=Journal of Experimental Algorithmics |volume=16 |page=1 |publisher=Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) |date=May 2011 |doi=10.1145/1963190.1963191}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the second one&lt;ref name="LW75"&gt;{{Citation |first1=Roy |last1=Lowrance |first2=Robert A. |last2=Wagner |title=An Extension of the String-to-String Correction Problem |journal=J ACM |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=177–183 |date=April 1975 |doi=10.1145/321879.321880}}&lt;/ref&gt; computes the Damerau–Levenshtein distance with adjacent transpositions. Adding transpositions adds significant complexity. The difference between the two algorithms consists in that the ''optimal string alignment algorithm'' computes the number of edit operations needed to make the strings equal under the condition that '''no substring is edited more than once''', whereas the second one presents no such restriction.

Take for example the edit distance between '''CA''' and '''ABC'''. The Damerau–Levenshtein distance LD('''CA''','''ABC''') = 2 because '''CA''' → '''AC''' → '''ABC''', but the optimal string alignment distance OSA('''CA''','''ABC''') = 3 because if the operation '''CA''' → '''AC''' is used, it is not possible to use '''AC''' → '''ABC''' because that would require the substring to be edited more than once, which is not allowed in OSA, and therefore the shortest sequence of operations is '''CA''' → '''A''' → '''AB''' → '''ABC'''. Note that for the optimal string alignment distance, the [[triangle inequality]] does not hold: OSA('''CA''','''AC''') + OSA('''AC''','''ABC''') &lt; OSA('''CA''','''ABC'''), and so it is not a true metric.

=== Optimal string alignment distance ===
Optimal string alignment distance can be computed using a straightforward extension of the [[Wagner–Fischer algorithm|Wagner–Fischer]] [[dynamic programming]] algorithm that computes [[Levenshtein distance]]. In [[pseudocode]]:

 '''algorithm''' OSA-distance '''is'''
     '''input''': strings a[1..length(a)], b[1..length(b)]
     '''output''': distance, integer
     
     '''let''' d[0..length(a), 0..length(b)] be a 2-d array of integers, dimensions length(a)+1, length(b)+1
     ''// note that d is zero-indexed, while a and b are one-indexed.''
     
     '''for''' i := 0 '''to''' length(a) '''inclusive''' '''do'''
         d[i, 0] := i
     '''for''' j := 0 '''to''' length(b) '''inclusive''' '''do'''
         d[0, j] := j
     
     '''for''' i := 1 '''to''' length(a) '''inclusive''' '''do'''
         '''for''' j := 1 '''to''' length(b) '''inclusive''' '''do'''
             '''if''' a[i] = b[j] '''then'''
                 cost := 0
             '''else'''
                 cost := 1
             d[i, j] := minimum(d[i-1, j] + 1,     ''// deletion''
                                d[i, j-1] + 1,     ''// insertion''
                                d[i-1, j-1] + cost)  ''// substitution''
             '''if''' i &gt; 1 and j &gt; 1 and a[i] = b[j-1] and a[i-1] = b[j] '''then'''
                 d[i, j] := minimum(d[i, j],
                                    d[i-2, j-2] + cost)  ''// transposition''
     '''return''' d[length(a), length(b)]

The difference from the algorithm for Levenshtein distance is the addition of one recurrence:

 '''if''' i &gt; 1 and j &gt; 1 and a[i] = b[j-1] and a[i-1] = b[j] '''then'''
     d[i, j] := minimum(d[i, j],
                        d[i-2, j-2] + cost)  ''// transposition''

=== Distance with adjacent transpositions ===
The following algorithm computes the true Damerau–Levenshtein distance with adjacent transpositions; this algorithm requires as an additional parameter the size of the alphabet {{math|Σ}}, so that all entries of the arrays are in {{math|[0, {{!}}Σ{{!}})}}:&lt;ref name="Boytsov" /&gt;{{Rp|A:93}}

     '''input''': strings a[1..length(a)], b[1..length(b)]
     '''output''': distance, integer
     
     da := new array of |Σ| integers
     '''for''' i := 1 '''to''' |Σ| '''inclusive''' '''do'''
         da[i] := 0
     
     '''let''' d[−1..length(a), −1..length(b)] be a 2-d array of integers, dimensions length(a)+2, length(b)+2
     ''// note that d has indices starting at −1, while a, b and da are one-indexed.''
     
     maxdist := length(a) + length(b)
     d[−1, −1] := maxdist
     '''for''' i := 0 '''to''' length(a) '''inclusive''' '''do'''
         d[i, −1] := maxdist
         d[i, 0] := i
     '''for''' j := 0 '''to''' length(b) '''inclusive''' '''do'''
         d[−1, j] := maxdist
         d[0, j] := j

             ℓ := db
             '''if''' a[i] = b[j] '''then'''
                 cost := 0
                 db := j
             '''else'''
                 cost := 1
             d[i, j] := minimum(d[i−1, j−1] + cost,  ''//substitution''
                                d[i,   j−1] + 1,     ''//insertion''
                                d[i−1, j  ] + 1,     ''//deletion''
                                d[k−1, ℓ−1] + (i−k−1) + 1 + (j-ℓ−1)) ''//transposition''
         da[a[i]] := i
     '''return''' d[length(a), length(b)]

To devise a proper algorithm to calculate unrestricted Damerau–Levenshtein distance note that there always exists an optimal sequence of edit operations, where once-transposed letters are never modified afterwards. (This holds as long as the cost of a transposition, &lt;math&gt;W_T&lt;/math&gt;, is at least the average of the cost of an insertion and deletion, i.e., &lt;math&gt;2W_T \ge W_I+W_D&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="LW75"/&gt;) Thus, we need to consider only two symmetric ways of modifying a substring more than once: (1) transpose letters and insert an arbitrary number of characters between them, or (2) delete a sequence of characters and transpose letters that become adjacent after deletion. The straightforward implementation of this idea gives an algorithm of cubic complexity: &lt;math&gt;O\left (M \cdot N \cdot \max(M, N) \right )&lt;/math&gt;, where ''M'' and ''N'' are string lengths. Using the ideas of Lowrance and Wagner,&lt;ref name="LW75"/&gt; this naive algorithm can be improved to be &lt;math&gt;O\left (M \cdot N \right)&lt;/math&gt; in the worst case.

It is interesting that the [[bitap algorithm]] can be modified to process transposition. See the information retrieval section of{{ref|itman}} for an example of such an adaptation.

== Applications ==
Damerau–Levenshtein distance plays an important role in [[natural language processing]]. In natural languages, strings are short and the number of errors (misspellings) rarely exceeds 2. In such circumstances, restricted and real edit distance differ very rarely. Oommen and Loke&lt;ref name="oommen"/&gt; even mitigated the limitation of the restricted edit distance by introducing ''generalized transpositions''. Nevertheless, one must remember that the restricted edit distance usually does not satisfy the [[triangle inequality]] and, thus, cannot be used with [[metric tree]]s.

=== DNA ===
Since [[DNA]] frequently undergoes insertions, deletions, substitutions, and transpositions, and each of these operations occurs on approximately the same timescale, the Damerau–Levenshtein distance is an appropriate metric of the variation between two strands of DNA. More common in DNA, protein, and other bioinformatics related alignment tasks is the use of closely related algorithms such as [[Needleman–Wunsch algorithm]] or [[Smith–Waterman algorithm]].

=== Fraud detection ===
The algorithm can be used with any set of words, like vendor names. Since entry is manual by nature there is a risk of entering a false vendor. A fraudster employee may enter one real vendor such as "Rich Heir Estate Services" versus a false vendor "Rich Hier State Services". The fraudster would then create a false bank account and have the company route checks to the real vendor and false vendor. The Damerau–Levenshtein algorithm will detect the transposed and dropped letter and bring attention of the items to a fraud examiner.

=== Export control ===

The U.S. Government uses the Damerau–Levenshtein distance with its Consolidated Screening List API.&lt;ref&gt;http://developer.trade.gov/consolidated-screening-list.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12656">In [[mathematics]], the '''Dickson polynomials''', denoted {{math|''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'',''α'')}}, form a [[polynomial sequence]] introduced by {{harvs|txt=yes|authorlink=Leonard Eugene Dickson|first=L. E. |last=Dickson|year= 1897}}. They were  rediscovered by {{harvtxt|Brewer|1961}} in his study of [[Brewer sum]]s and have at times, although rarely, been referred to as '''Brewer polynomials'''.

Over the complex numbers, Dickson polynomials are essentially equivalent to [[Chebyshev polynomial]]s with a change of variable, and, in fact, Dickson polynomials are sometimes called Chebyshev polynomials.

Dickson polynomials are generally studied over [[finite fields]], where they sometimes may not be equivalent to Chebyshev polynomials.  One of the main reasons for interest in them is that for fixed {{math|''α''}}, they give many examples of ''[[permutation polynomial]]s''; polynomials acting as [[permutation]]s of finite fields.

==Definition==
===First kind===
For integer {{math|''n'' &gt; 0}} and {{mvar|α}} in a [[commutative ring]] {{mvar|R}} with identity (often chosen to be the finite field {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} GF(''q'')}}) the '''Dickson polynomials''' (of the first kind) over {{mvar|R}} are given by&lt;ref name=LN355&gt;{{harvnb|Lidl|Niederreiter|1983|loc=p. 355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;D_n(x,\alpha)=\sum_{i=0}^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor}\frac{n}{n-i} \binom{n-i}{i} (-\alpha)^i x^{n-2i} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The first few Dickson polynomials are

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
D_1(x,\alpha) &amp;= x \\
D_2(x,\alpha) &amp;= x^2 - 2\alpha \\
D_3(x,\alpha) &amp;= x^3 - 3x\alpha \\
D_4(x,\alpha) &amp;= x^4 - 4x^2\alpha + 2\alpha^2 \\
D_5(x,\alpha) &amp;= x^5 - 5x^3\alpha + 5x\alpha^2 \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

They may also be generated by the [[recurrence relation]] for {{math|''n'' ≥ 2}},

:&lt;math&gt;D_n(x,\alpha) = xD_{n-1}(x,\alpha)-\alpha D_{n-2}(x,\alpha) \,,&lt;/math&gt;
with the initial conditions {{math|''D''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''α'') {{=}} 2}} and {{math|''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''α'') {{=}} ''x''}}.

===Second kind===
The  Dickson polynomials of the second kind, {{math|''E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'',''α'')}}, are defined by
:&lt;math&gt;E_n(x,\alpha)=\sum_{i=0}^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor}\binom{n-i}{i} (-\alpha)^i x^{n-2i}. &lt;/math&gt;
They have not been studied much, and have properties similar to those of Dickson polynomials of the first kind.
The first few Dickson polynomials  of the second kind are

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
E_0(x,\alpha) &amp;= 1 \\
E_1(x,\alpha) &amp;= x \\
E_2(x,\alpha) &amp;= x^2 - \alpha \\
E_3(x,\alpha) &amp;= x^3 - 2x\alpha \\
E_4(x,\alpha) &amp;= x^4 - 3x^2\alpha + \alpha^2 \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

They may also be generated by the recurrence relation for {{math|''n'' ≥ 2}},

:&lt;math&gt;E_n(x,\alpha) = xE_{n-1}(x,\alpha)-\alpha E_{n-2}(x,\alpha) \,,&lt;/math&gt;
with the initial conditions {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''α'') {{=}} 1}} and {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''α'') {{=}} ''x''}}.

==Properties==
The {{math|''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are the unique monic polynomials satisfying the functional equation

:&lt;math&gt;D_n\left(u + \frac{\alpha}{u},\alpha\right) = u^n + \left(\frac{\alpha}{u}\right)^n, &lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''α'' ∈ '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''u'' ≠ 0 ∈ '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=MP283&gt;{{harvnb|Mullen|Panario|2013|loc=p. 283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also satisfy a composition rule,&lt;ref name=MP283 /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;D_{mn}(x,\alpha) = D_m\bigl(D_n(x,\alpha),\alpha^n\bigr) \,= D_n\bigl(D_m(x,\alpha),\alpha^m\bigr) \, . &lt;/math&gt;

The {{math|''E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} also satisfy a functional equation&lt;ref name=MP283 /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_n\left(y + \frac{\alpha}{y}, \alpha\right) = \frac{y^{n+1} - \left(\frac{\alpha}{y}\right)^{n+1}}{y - \frac{\alpha}{y}} \,,&lt;/math&gt;
for {{math|''y'' ≠ 0}}, {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≠ ''α''}}, with {{math|''α'' ∈ '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''y'' ∈ '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

The Dickson polynomial {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is a solution of the [[ordinary differential equation]]
:&lt;math&gt;\left(x^2-4\alpha\right)y'' + xy' - n^2y=0 \,, &lt;/math&gt;
and the Dickson polynomial {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is a  solution of the differential equation
:&lt;math&gt;\left(x^2-4\alpha\right)y'' + 3xy' - n(n+2)y=0 \,. &lt;/math&gt;
Their [[Generating function#Ordinary generating function|ordinary generating function]]s are
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sum_n D_n(x,\alpha)z^n &amp;= \frac{2-xz}{1-xz+\alpha z^2} \\
\sum_n E_n(x,\alpha)z^n &amp;= \frac{1}{1-xz+\alpha z^2} \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Links to other polynomials ==
By the recurrence relation above, Dickson polynomials are [[Lucas sequence|Lucas sequences]].  Specifically, for {{math|''α'' {{=}} −1}}, the Dickson polynomials of the first kind are [[Fibonacci polynomials|Fibonacci]] polynomials, and Dickson polynomials of the second kind are [[Lucas polynomials]].

By the composition rule above, when α is [[Idempotent (ring theory)|idempotent]], composition of Dickson polynomials of the first kind is commutative.
* The Dickson polynomials with parameter {{math|''α'' {{=}} 0}} give [[Monomial|monomials]].  

&lt;math&gt;D_n(x,0) = x^n \, . &lt;/math&gt;

* The Dickson polynomials with parameter {{math|''α'' {{=}} 1}} are related to [[Chebyshev polynomial]]s {{math|''T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') {{=}} cos (''n'' arccos ''x'')}} of the first kind by&lt;ref name="LN355" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;D_n(2x, 1) = 2T_n(x) \,.&lt;/math&gt;
* Since the Dickson polynomial {{math|''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'',''α'')}} can be defined over rings with additional idempotents, {{math|''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'',''α'')}} is often not related to a Chebyshev polynomial.

==Permutation polynomials and Dickson polynomials==
A '''permutation polynomial''' (for a given finite field) is one that acts as a permutation of the elements of the finite field.

The Dickson polynomial {{math|''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'', α)}} (considered as a function of {{math|''x''}} with α fixed) is a permutation polynomial for the field with {{math|''q''}} elements if and only if {{math|''n''}} is coprime to {{math|''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}.&lt;ref name="LN356"&gt;{{harvnb|Lidl|Niederreitter|1983|loc=p. 356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{harvtxt|Fried|1970}} proved that any integral polynomial that is a permutation polynomial for infinitely many prime fields is a composition of Dickson polynomials and linear polynomials (with rational coefficients).  &lt;!-- See talk page.---&gt;  This assertion has become known as Schur's conjecture, although in fact Schur did not make this conjecture. &lt;!-- See talk page ---&gt;  Since Fried's paper contained numerous errors, a corrected account was given by {{harvtxt|Turnwald|1995}}, and subsequently {{harvtxt|Müller|1997}} gave a simpler proof along the lines of an argument due to Schur.

Further, {{harvtxt|Müller|1997}} proved that any permutation polynomial over the finite field {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;}} whose degree is simultaneously coprime to {{math|''q''}} and less than {{math|''q''&lt;sup&gt;{{sfrac|1|4}}&lt;/sup&gt;}} must be a composition of Dickson polynomials and linear polynomials.

==Generalization==
Dickson polynomials of both kinds over finite fields can be thought of as initial members of a sequence of generalized Dickson polynomials referred to as Dickson polynomials of the {{math|(''k'' + 1)}}th kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Q.|last1=Wang|first2=J. L.|last2=Yucas|title=Dickson polynomials over finite fields|journal=Finite Fields and their Applications|volume=18|year=2012|pages=814–831}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, for {{math|''α'' ≠ 0 ∈ '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;}} with {{math|''q'' {{=}} ''p&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;''}} for some prime {{mvar|p}} and any integers {{math|''n'' ≥ 0}} and {{math|0 ≤ ''k'' &lt; ''p''}}, the '''{{mvar|n}}th Dickson polynomial of the {{math|(''k'' + 1)}}th kind''' over {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, denoted by {{math|''D''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''α'')}}, is defined by&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mullen|Panario|2013|loc=p. 287}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;D_{0,k}(x,\alpha) = 2 - k&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;D_{n,k}(x,\alpha)=\sum_{i=0}^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor}\frac{n - ki}{n-i}\binom{n-i}{i} (-\alpha)^i x^{n-2i} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

{{math|''D''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''α'') {{=}} ''D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'',''α'')}} and {{math|''D''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''α'') {{=}} ''E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'',''α'')}}, showing that this definition unifies and generalizes the original polynomials of Dickson.

The significant properties of the Dickson polynomials also generalize:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mullen|Panario|2013|loc=p. 288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3316">An '''entitative graph''' is an element of the [[diagram]]matic [[syntax]]  for [[logic]] that [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] developed under the name of '''qualitative logic''' beginning in the 1880s, taking the coverage of the [[formal system|formalism]] only as far as the [[propositional calculus|propositional or sentential]] aspects of logic are concerned.  See 3.468, 4.434, and 4.564 in Peirce's ''Collected Papers''.

The [[syntax]] is:
*The blank page;
*Single letters, phrases;
*Objects (subgraphs) enclosed by a [[simple closed curve]] called a ''cut''. A cut can be empty.

The [[semantics]] are:
*The blank page denotes '''False''';
*Letters, phrases, subgraphs, and entire graphs can be '''True''' or '''False''';
*To surround objects with a cut is equivalent to Boolean [[Complement (order theory)|complementation]]. Hence an empty cut denotes '''Truth''';
*All objects within a given cut are tacitly joined by [[disjunction]].

A "proof" manipulates a graph, using a short list of rules, until the graph is reduced to an empty cut or the blank page. A graph that can be so reduced is what is now called a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] (or the complement thereof). Graphs that cannot be simplified beyond a certain point are analogues of the [[satisfiable]] [[formula]]s of [[first-order logic]].

Peirce soon abandoned the entitative graphs for the [[existential graph]]s, whose sentential (''alpha'') part is [[duality (mathematics)|dual]] to the entitative graphs. He developed the existential graphs until they became another formalism for what are now termed [[first-order logic]] and [[normal modal logic]].

The [[Laws of form|primary algebra]] of [[G. Spencer-Brown]] is isomorphic to the entitative graphs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3359">In [[mathematics]], a '''functional calculus''' is a theory allowing one to apply [[mathematical function]]s to [[mathematical operator]]s. It is now a branch (more accurately, several related areas) of the field of [[functional analysis]], connected with [[spectral theory]]. (Historically, the term was also used synonymously with [[calculus of variations]]; this usage is obsolete, except for [[functional derivative]]. Sometimes it is used in relation to types of [[functional equations]], or in logic for systems of [[predicate calculus]].)

If ''f'' is a function, say a numerical function of a [[real number]], and ''M'' is an operator, there is no particular reason why the expression

:''f''(''M'')

should make sense. If it does, then we are no longer using ''f'' on its original [[function domain]]. In the tradition of [[operational calculus]], algebraic expressions in operators are handled irrespective of their meaning.  This passes nearly unnoticed if we talk about 'squaring a matrix', though, which is the case of ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''M'' an ''n''&amp;times;''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. The idea of a functional calculus is to create a ''principled'' approach to this kind of [[Function overloading|overloading]] of the notation. 

The most immediate case is to apply [[polynomial function]]s to a [[square matrix]], extending what has just been discussed. In the finite-dimensional case, the polynomial functional calculus yields quite a bit of information about the operator. For example, consider the family of polynomials which annihilates an operator ''T''. This family is an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] in the ring of polynomials. Furthermore, it is a nontrivial ideal: let ''n'' be the finite dimension of the algebra of matrices, then {''I'', ''T'', ''T''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;...''T&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''} is linearly dependent. So ∑ ''α&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; T&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' = 0 for some scalars ''α&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', not all equal to 0. This implies that the polynomial ∑ ''α&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; x&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' lies in the ideal. Since the ring of polynomials is a [[principal ideal domain]], this ideal is generated by some polynomial ''m''. Multiplying by a unit if necessary, we can choose ''m'' to be monic. When this is done, the polynomial ''m'' is precisely the [[Minimal polynomial (linear algebra)|minimal polynomial]] of ''T''. This polynomial gives deep information about ''T''. For instance, a scalar ''α'' is an eigenvalue of ''T'' if and only if ''α'' is a root of ''m''. Also, sometimes ''m'' can be used to calculate the [[Exponential function|exponential]] of ''T'' efficiently. 

The polynomial calculus is not as informative in the infinite-dimensional case. Consider the [[unilateral shift]] with the polynomials calculus; the ideal defined above is now trivial. Thus one is interested in functional calculi more general than polynomials. The subject is closely linked to [[spectral theory]], since for a [[diagonal matrix]] or [[multiplication operator]], it is rather clear what the definitions should be.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2212">In [[mathematics]], the '''method of descent''' is the term coined by the French [[mathematician]] [[Jacques Hadamard]] as a method for solving a [[partial differential equation]] in several [[Function of a real variable|real]] or [[complex variable]]s, by regarding it as the specialisation of an equation in more variables, constant in the extra parameters. This method has been used to solve the [[wave equation]], the [[heat equation]] and other versions of the [[Cauchy initial value problem]].

As {{harvtxt|Hadamard|1923}} wrote:

{{cquote|We thus have a first example of what I shall call a 'method of descent'. Creating a phrase for an idea which is merely childish and has been used since the first steps of the theory is, I must confess, rather ambitious; but we shall come across it rather frequently, so that it will be convenient to have a word to denote it. It consists in noticing that he who can do more can do less: if we can integrate equations with ''m'' variables, we can do the same for equations with (''m''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1) variables.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4136">A '''hidden semi-Markov model''' (HSMM) is a statistical model with the same structure as a [[hidden Markov model]] except that the unobservable process is [[semi-Markov process|semi-Markov]] rather than [[Markov process|Markov]]. This means that the probability of there being a change in the hidden state depends on the amount of time that has elapsed since entry into the current state. This is in contrast to hidden Markov models where there is a constant probability of changing state given survival in the state up to that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Shun-Zheng|last=Yu|title=Hidden Semi-Markov Models|journal=Artificial Intelligence|volume=174|issue=2|pages=215–243|doi=10.1016/j.artint.2009.11.011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance {{harvtxt|Sanson|Thomson|2001}} modelled daily rainfall using a hidden semi-Markov model.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=J.|last1=Sansom|first2=P. J.|last2=Thomson|title=Fitting hidden semi-Markov models to breakpoint rainfall data|journal=J. Appl. Probab.|volume=38A|year=2001|pages=142–157|doi=10.1239/jap/1085496598}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If the underlying process (e.g. weather system) does not have a [[geometric distribution|geometrically distributed]] duration, an HSMM may be more appropriate.

The model was first published by [[Leonard E. Baum]] and Ted Petrie in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Barbu | first1 = V. | last2 = Limnios | first2 = N. | chapter = Hidden Semi-Markov Model and Estimation | doi = 10.1007/978-0-387-73173-5_6 | title = Semi-Markov Chains and Hidden Semi-Markov Models toward Applications | series = Lecture Notes in Statistics | volume = 191 | pages = 1 | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-387-73171-1 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Baum | first1 = L.

Statistical inference for hidden semi-Markov models is more difficult than in hidden Markov models, since algorithms like the [[Baum-Welch algorithm]] are not directly applicable, and must be adapted requiring more resources.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2879">The '''Hilbert basis''' of a [[convex cone]] ''C'' is a minimal set of integer [[vector (mathematics)|vector]]s such that every integer vector in ''C'' is a [[conical combination]] of the vectors in the Hilbert basis with integer coefficients.

== Definition ==
[[File:Hilbert basis.gif|thumb|Hilbert basis visualization]]
Given a [[Lattice (group)|lattice]] &lt;math&gt;L\subset\mathbb{Z}^d&lt;/math&gt;  and a convex polyhedral cone with generators &lt;math&gt;a_1,\ldots,a_n\in\mathbb{Z}^d&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C=\{ \lambda_1 a_1 + \ldots + \lambda_n a_n \mid \lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n \geq 0, \lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n \in\mathbb{R}\}\subset\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt;

we consider the [[monoid]] &lt;math&gt;C\cap L&lt;/math&gt;. By [[Gordan's lemma]] this monoid is finitely generated, i.e., there exists a finite set of lattice points &lt;math&gt;\{x_1,\ldots,x_m\}\subset C\cap L&lt;/math&gt; such that every lattice point &lt;math&gt;x\in C\cap L&lt;/math&gt; is an integer conical combination of these points:

:&lt;math&gt; x=\lambda_1 x_1+\ldots+\lambda_m x_m, \quad\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_m\in\mathbb{Z}, \lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_m\geq0&lt;/math&gt;

The cone ''C'' is called pointed, if &lt;math&gt;x,-x\in C&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;. In this case there exists a unique minimal generating set of the monoid &lt;math&gt;C\cap L&lt;/math&gt; - the '''Hilbert basis''' of ''C''. It is given by set of irreducible lattice points: An element &lt;math&gt;x\in C\cap L&lt;/math&gt; is called irreducible if it can not be written as the sum of two non-zero elements, i.e., &lt;math&gt;x=y+z&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;y=0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;z=0&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20238">The '''Hobbes–Wallis controversy''' was a polemic debate that continued from the mid-1650s well into the 1670s, between the philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] and the mathematician [[John Wallis]]. It was sparked by ''[[De corpore]]'', a philosophical work by Hobbes in the general area of [[physics]]. The book contained not only a theory of mathematics subordinating it to [[geometry]] and geometry to [[kinematics]], but a claimed proof of the [[squaring of the circle]] by Hobbes. While Hobbes retracted this particular proof, he returned to the topic with other attempted proofs. A pamphleteering exchange continued for decades. It drew in the newly formed [[Royal Society]], and its experimental philosophy, to which Hobbes was (on principle) opposed.

The sustained nature of the exchanges can be attributed to several strands of the intellectual situation of the time. In mathematics there were open issues, namely the priority (pedagogic, or theoretical) to be assigned to geometry and [[algebra]]; and the status of algebra itself, which (from an English standpoint) had been pulled together by the text of [[William Oughtred]], as more than a collection of symbolic abbreviations. Socially, the formation of the group of Royal Society members, and the status of the publication ''Philosophical Transactions'', was brought to a point as the quarrel proceeded, with Hobbes playing the outsider versus the self-selecting guild. 

Hobbes was an easy target, on the ground chosen by Wallis. The failure of his attempts to solve the impossible problems he set himself were inevitable, but he neither backed down completely, nor applied adequate self-criticism. And on the level of character, Wallis was as intransigent as Hobbes was dogmatic, and this inflicted damage on both of their reputations. [[Quentin Skinner]] writes: "There is no doubt that at the personal level Wallis behaved badly (as was widely conceded at the time)."&lt;ref name = Skinner&gt;[[Quentin Skinner]], ''Visions of Politics'' (2002), p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the significance of the controversy is that Hobbes felt that, in the later stages, the Royal Society was in some way complicit in the attacks from Wallis, despite the fact that he had many friends as Fellows in it. This attitude presented one of the obstacles to Hobbes himself becoming a member, though not the only one.

==Hobbes attacks the universities==

Hobbes in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651) joined others in attacks on the existing [[Oxbridge]] academic system, essentially a monopoly in England of university teaching. These attacks, especially that of [[John Webster (1610-1682)|John Webster]] in ''Examen academiarum'', stung replies from [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] professors. Wallis joined in, but the first wave of rebuttals came from other major names.

The issue of the universities was heavily loaded at the time, and the orthodox Presbyterian minister [[Thomas Hall (minister)|Thomas Hall]] lined up with ''Vindiciae literarum'' (1654). He had been arguing since ''The Pulpit Guarded'' (1651) that university learning was the bastion of defence against proliferating unorthodoxy and [[heresy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]], ''Change and Continuity in 17th Century England'' (1974), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allen G. Debus, ''The Chemical Philosophy: Paracelsian Science and Medicine in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries'' (2002), pp. 406-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Webster had put the other side of the argument, in ''The Saints Guide'' (1653), casting doubt on the need for a university-educated clergy.

In 1654 [[Seth Ward (bishop)|Seth Ward]] (1617–1689), the [[Savilian Professor of Astronomy]], replied in ''Vindiciae academiarum'' to the assaults. It was an anonymous publication of Ward and [[John Wilkins]], but not intended to conceal its authorship (JohN WilkinS signed N.S. and SetH WarD signed H.D.).&lt;ref&gt;Margery Purver, ''The Royal Society: Concept and Creation'' (1967), note 12 p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The agenda and tone for the controversy was first set by Ward when he launched a general attack on Hobbes. Wilkins wrote a preface to ''Vindiciae academiarum''; the main text by Ward mentioned Hobbes, who was the particular target of an appendix. Ward claimed in both places that Hobbes had plagiarised [[Walter Warner]].&lt;ref&gt;Aloysius Martinich, ''Hobbes: A Biography'' (1999), p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; Before ''Leviathan'', Wilkins certainly was not hostile to Hobbes, and in fact wrote a Latin poem for the 1650 ''Humane Nature; or the Fundamental Elements of Policy'', an edition of part of the ''Elements of Law'' of Hobbes; and the preface to that book has been attributed to Ward. But the emergence of the full scope of the philosophy of Hobbes in ''Leviathan'' lost him allies who may have shared somewhat in his starting assumptions, but who felt a need to distance themselves from his conclusions, as Ward did in his ''Philosophicall Essay'' of 1652. &lt;ref&gt;Parkin, pp. 154-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Ward went on to make a full-dress attack on Hobbes the philosopher, the ''In Thomae Hobbii philosophiam exercitatio epistolica'' of 1656, dedicated to Wilkins.&lt;ref&gt;Parkin, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early controversy on mathematics==

Errors in ''De Corpore'', in the mathematical sections, opened Hobbes to criticism also from John Wallis, [[Savilian Professor of Geometry]]. 

===The ''Elenchus''===

Wallis's ''Elenchus geometriae Hobbianae'', published in 1655, contained an elaborate criticism of Hobbes's attempt to put the foundations of mathematical science in its place within knowledge. Hobbes had limited his interest to geometry, restricting the scope of mathematics. 

The book was dedicated to [[John Owen (theologian)|John Owen]], and in prefatory remarks Wallis (a [[Presbyterian]]) avows that his differences with Hobbes are largely rooted in theology.&lt;ref&gt;T. Koetsier, L. Bergmans, ''Mathematics and the Divine: A Historical Study'' (2005), p. 445.&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes himself wrote to [[Samuel de Sorbière]] in the same year, saying the controversy was not merely scientific. He regarded the use of infinite quantities as the thin end of the wedge for a return of [[scholasticism]], and behind Wallis he saw "all the Ecclesiastics of England".&lt;ref&gt;Parkin, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; Sorbière visited Wallis in Oxford; but his analysis of Wallis as stereotypical pedant helped not at all in the quarrel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shpltd.co.uk/sarasohn-sorbiere.pdf Lisa T. Sarasohn, ''Who was then the Gentleman?: Samuel Sorbière, Thomas Hobbes and the Royal Society'', Hist. Sci., xlii (2004); (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobbes took care to remove some mistakes exposed by Wallis, before allowing an English translation of the ''De Corpore'' to appear in 1656. But he still attacked Wallis in a series of ''Six Lessons to the Professors of Mathematics'', included with the ''De Corpore'' translation. Wallis defended himself, and re-confronted Hobbes with his mathematical inconsistencies. Hobbes responded with ''Marks of the Absurd Geometry, Rural Language, Scottish Church Politics, and Barbarisms of John Wallis, Professor of Geometry and Doctor of Divinity''. It has been suggested that Hobbes was still trying to cultivate John Owen at this point: Owen was both the leading Independent theologian and [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]]'s choice as Vice-Chancellor of Oxford, and Hobbes softened his critical line on the universities while stoking up the quarrel with Wallis. Further, the religious dimension (''Scottish Church Politics'' refers to the Presbyterianism of Wallis, not shared by Owen) has been seen as a presage of later analysis of ''[[Behemoth (Hobbes book)|Behemoth]]'', the book Hobbes wrote in 1668 as a post-mortem on the [[English Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Serjeantson, ''Hobbes and the Universities'', p. 133-5 in Conal Condren, [[Stephen Gaukroger]], Ian Hunter (editors), ''The Philosopher in Early Modern Europe: The Nature of a Contested Identity'' (2006); [http://www.ched.uq.edu.au/docs/personapapers/serjeantson-persona.pdf PDF].&lt;/ref&gt; The various thrusts were parried by Wallis in a reply (''Hobbiani puncti dispunctio'', 1657).

===Controversy over foundational matters===

Wallis published a comprehensive treatise on the general principles of calculus (''Mathesis universalis'', 1657). Here he strongly advocated giving priority to the approach through arithmetic and algebra. This was quite contrary to the arguments of both Hobbes and [[Isaac Barrow]].&lt;ref&gt;Paolo Mancosu, ''Philosophy of Mathematics and Mathematical Practice in the Seventeenth Century'' (1996), pp. 86-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes set store on the "demonstrable" status of geometry, in the ''Six Lessons''.&lt;ref&gt;Helena Mary Pycior, ''Symbols, Impossible Numbers, and Geometric Entanglements: British Algebra Through the Commentaries on Newton's Universal Arithmetick'' (1997), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Jon Parkin writes:

{{cquote|For Hobbes, his new form of geometrical demonstration was the finest example of what a [[nominalist]] science could achieve. It offered demonstrably certain knowledge. The creation and interaction of lines could clearly be conceived as a product of matter in motion, whose properties could be demonstrated with the highest level of certainty.[...] Wallis, by contrast was the foremost exponent of Cartesian [[analytical geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;Parkin, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mathematicians sympathetic to Hobbes included [[François du Verdus]] and [[François Pelau]], and some of his works were later translated into English for pedagogic use by [[Venterus Mandey]]; but he was not backed up by a "school".&lt;ref&gt;Jesseph, note p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side as critics were [[Claude Mylon]], [[Laurence Rooke]], [[Viscount Brouncker]], [[John Pell]], [[Christiaan Huyghens]]; much of the criticism Hobbes received was by private correspondence, or in the case of Pell direct contact. [[Henry Stubbe]], later a vehement critic of the Royal Society, assured Hobbes in 1657 he had some (unnamed) supporters in Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;Jesseph, Ch. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobbes decided again to attack the new methods of [[mathematical analysis]] and by the spring of 1660, he had put his criticism and assertions into five dialogues under the title ''Examinatio et emendatio mathematicae hodiernae qualis explicatur in libris Johannis Wallisii'', with a sixth dialogue so called, consisting almost entirely of seventy or more propositions on the circle and [[cycloid]]. Wallis, however, would not take the bait.

===Hobbes and duplicating the cube===

Hobbes then tried another tack, having solved, as he thought, another ancient problem, the [[duplication of the cube]]. He had his solution brought out anonymously in French, so as to put his critics off the scent. He slipped in algebraic terms in early efforts, by cubing {{radic|2}} to the answer 2. While Hobbes would withdraw some arguments as erroneous, he distinguished between "errors of negligence" and "errors of principle", and found the latter much harder to admit. He was led to argue that the doctrine of ''n''th roots in algebra (one contribution of Wallis) did not adequately model the geometric notions based on area and volume. [[René François Walter de Sluse]] walked through Hobbes's proof in one version, clearing the radicals to come down to a numerical assertion it implied (97,336 = 97,556), which could only be accepted as an approximation.&lt;ref&gt;Jesseph, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes replied with an idiosyncratic appeal to a form of [[dimensional analysis]], where algebraic quantities are non-dimensional.&lt;ref&gt;Jesseph, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, his positions hardened after 1660.

Wallis publicly refuted the solution, but Hobbes claimed the credit of it. He republished it (in modified form), with his remarks, at the end of the 1661 ''Dialogus Physicus''.

==Second phase: the ''Dialogus physicus'' of 1661==

The ''Dialogus physicus, sive De natura aeris'' attacked [[Robert Boyle]] and other friends of Wallis who were forming themselves into a society (incorporated as the [[Royal Society]] in 1662) for experimental research. The full Latin title of the book&lt;ref&gt;''Dialogus physicus, sive, De natura aeris conjectura sumpta ab experimentis nuper Londini habitis in Collegio Greshamensi, item de duplicatione cubi''&lt;/ref&gt; mentioned [[Gresham College]] as the experimental base of Boyle's group (see [[Gresham College and the formation of the Royal Society]]), followed immediately by a reference to the duplication of the cube, which in Hobbes's latest version was included as an appendix. Hobbes chose to take as the manifesto of the new academy Boyle's ''[[New Experiments touching the Spring of the Air]]'' (1660). Hobbes saw the whole approach as a direct contravention of the method of physical inquiry enjoined in the ''De Corpore''. He had reasoned out his own conclusions years before from speculative principles, and he warned them that if they were not content to begin where he had left off, their work would come to naught. This attack from Hobbes was one of several at the time: other opponents of Boyle were [[Franciscus Linus]] and [[Henry More]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Shapin]] and [[Simon Schaffer]], ''[[Leviathan and the Air-Pump]]'' (1985), p. 155, and translation of the ''Dialogus, pp. 345-391.&lt;/ref&gt; The issues at stake now had broadened out, and this was a choice Hobbes made, with their implications reaching beyond those of the first phase.&lt;ref&gt;http://science.jrank.org/pages/9292/Experiment-Boyle-Hobbes-Dispute.html&lt;/ref&gt;

To Hobbes, Boyle replied himself, in the ''Examen of Mr T. Hobbes'', which appeared as an appendix to a second edition (1662) of the ''New Experiments'', along with an answer to Linus.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin and Schaffer, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; But first Wallis was drawn in again, with the satire ''Hobbius heauton-timorumenos'' (1662). It included the accusation that Hobbes used purely verbal tactics, preferring his own semantics of a term such as "air", to cast doubt on the existence of a [[vacuum]].&lt;ref&gt;Shapin and Schaffer, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hobbes reacted to personal attack by keeping aloof from scientific controversy for some years. He did write a letter about himself in the third person, ''Considerations upon the Reputation, Loyalty, Manners and Religion of Thomas Hobbes's''. In this biographical piece, he told his own and Wallis's "little stories during the time of the [[English Civil War|late rebellion]]". Wallis did not attempt a reply.

==Hobbes and the Royal Society==

Hobbes never became a Fellow of the Royal Society, which was formally founded right at the time when the controversy drew in Boyle, and it has been debated why. Possible explanations are that he was difficult (cantakerous, even), and in other ways incompatible with the Society as club; or that the attacks by Wallis had successfully diminished his reputation, by showing that he was a lightweight in mathematics, part of a bigger polemic plan to show his thought generally as unoriginal, coming secondhand from others.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin and Schaffer, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Another simple explanation is that Hobbes was too "controversial" in the modern sense: he was excluded for reasons of image management.

It is possible that Hobbes's objections to academia extended to the Society. [[John Aubrey]] reports that Hobbes thought he had a small group of enemies there.&lt;ref&gt;http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/econ/ugcm/3ll3/hobbes/life&lt;/ref&gt; Wallis, Ward and Wilkins were indeed key members of the early Royal Society, having been in the precursor group ("[[Oxford Philosophical Club]]") in Oxford.

Quentin Skinner therefore proposed, in a 1969 paper ''Hobbes and the politics of the early Royal Society'',&lt;ref name = Skinner/&gt; that small-group politics explained enough: those three kept Hobbes out of the Royal Society at the start; and that his continuing absence is sufficiently explained by Hobbes's resentment at such treatment. Certainly Hobbes took it badly that Wallis could use the ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]'' to publish his critical views, for example in a review of Hobbes's ''Rosetum geometricum'', and complained about this in 1672 to [[Henry Oldenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Jesseph, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Recent scholarly explanations are more complex. It is argued by [[Noel Malcolm]] that the general position of Hobbes, in 'mechanistic philosophy', was close enough to that current in the Royal Society to be compatible (even given the debate with Boyle), but that his reputation from the political and religious side made him untouchable, and the Society kept him at arm's length for that reason.&lt;ref&gt;[[Noel Malcolm]], ''Hobbes and the Royal Society'', at p. 45-6 and p. 60 in  Graham Alan John Rogers, Alan Ryan (editors), ''Perspectives on Thomas Hobbes'' (1988); also in ''Aspects of Hobbes'', November 2002, pp. 317-336 (20).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later publications==

After a time Hobbes began a further period of controversial activity, which he dragged out until his ninetieth year. The first piece, published in 1666, ''De principiis et ratiocinatione geometrarum'', was an attack on geometry professors. Three years later he brought his three mathematical achievements together in ''Quadratura circuli, Cubatio sphaerae, Duplicitio cubii'', and as soon as they were once more refuted by Wallis, reprinted them with an answer to the objections. Wallis, who had promised to leave him alone, refuted him again before the year was out. The exchange dragged on through numerous other papers until 1678.

A '''hyperbolic geometric graph (HGG)''' or '''hyperbolic geometric network (HGN)''' is a special type of [[spatial network]] where (1) latent coordinates of nodes are sprinkled according to a [[probability density function]] into a
[[hyperbolic space]] of [[constant function|constant]] negative [[Constant curvature|curvature]] and (2)  an [[Edge (graph theory)|edge]] between two nodes is present if they are close according to a function of the [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]]&lt;ref name=RefSpatialReview&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barthélemy|first1=Marc|title=Spatial networks|journal=Physics Reports|volume=499|issue=1–3|pages=1–101|doi=10.1016/j.physrep.2010.11.002|arxiv=1010.0302|bibcode=2011PhR...499....1B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RefDimaPre&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krioukov|first1=Dmitri|last2=Papadopoulos|first2=Fragkiskos|last3=Kitsak|first3=Maksim|last4=Vahdat|first4=Amin|last5=Boguñá|first5=Marián|title=Hyperbolic geometry of complex networks|journal=Physical Review E|volume=82|issue=3|arxiv=1006.5169|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.82.036106|bibcode=2010PhRvE..82c6106K}}&lt;/ref&gt; (typically either a [[Heaviside step function]] resulting in deterministic connections between vertices closer than a certain threshold distance, or a decaying function of hyperbolic distance yielding the connection probability). A HGG generalizes a [[random geometric graph]] (RGG) whose embedding space is [[Euclidean space|Euclidean.]]

== Mathematical formulation ==
Mathematically, a '''HGG''' is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] &lt;math&gt;G(V,E)&lt;/math&gt; with a vertex [[set (mathematics)|set]] ''V'' ([[cardinality]] &lt;math&gt;N=|V|&lt;/math&gt;) and a edge set ''E'' constructed by considering the nodes as points placed onto a 2-dimensional hyperbolic space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}^2_\zeta&lt;/math&gt; of constant negative [[Gaussian curvature]], &lt;math&gt;-\zeta^2&lt;/math&gt; and cut-off radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.&amp;nbsp;the radius of the [[Poincaré disk model|Poincaré disk]] which can be visualized using a [[hyperboloid model]].
Each point &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; has hyperbolic polar coordinates &lt;math&gt;(r_i,\theta_i)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;0\leq r_i\leq R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0\leq \theta_i &lt; 2\pi&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[hyperbolic law of cosines]] allows to measure the distance &lt;math&gt;d_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; between two points &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name=RefDimaPre /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cosh(\zeta d_{ij})=\cosh(\zeta r_i)\cosh(\zeta r_j)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;-\sinh(\zeta r_i)\sinh(\zeta r_j)\cos\bigg(\underbrace{\pi\!-\!\bigg|\pi-|\theta_i\!-\!\theta_j|\bigg|}_{\Delta}\bigg).&lt;/math&gt;
The angle&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is the (smallest) angle between the two
[[Position (vector)|position vectors]].

In the simplest case, an edge &lt;math&gt;(i,j)&lt;/math&gt; is established iff (if and only if) two nodes are within a certain ''neighborhood radius''&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d_{ij}\leq r&lt;/math&gt;, this corresponds to an influence threshold.

=== Connectivity decay function ===
In general, a link will be established with a probability depending on the distance&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;d_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;. 
A ''connectivity decay function'' &lt;math&gt;\gamma(s): \mathbb{R}^+\to[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; represents the probability of assigning an edge to a pair of nodes at distance &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;. 
In this framework, the simple case of ''[[Depletion force#Hard-sphere potential|hard-code]]'' neighborhood like in [[random geometric graph]]s is referred to as ''truncation decay function''.&lt;ref name=RefConnectivityDecay&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=L.|last2=Di Paolo|first2=E.|last3=Bullock|first3=S.|title=Spatially embedded random networks|journal=Physical Review E|volume=76|issue=5|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.76.056115|bibcode=2007PhRvE..76e6115B}}&lt;!--|accessdate=17 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Findings ==
For &lt;math&gt;\zeta=1&lt;/math&gt; (Gaussian curvature &lt;math&gt;K=-1&lt;/math&gt;), HGGs form an [[Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|ensemble]] of networks for which is possible to express the [[degree distribution]] [[Closed-form expression|analytically as closed form]] for the [[Limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]] of large number of nodes.&lt;ref name=RefDimaPre /&gt; This is worth mentioning since this is not true for many ensembles of graphs.

== Applications ==
HGGs have been suggested as promising model for [[social networks]] where the hyperbolicity appears through a competition between ''similarity'' and ''popularity'' of an individual.&lt;ref name=RefPapaNature&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Papadopoulos|first1=Fragkiskos|last2=Kitsak|first2=Maksim|last3=Serrano|first3=M.

[[File:Infinite.svg|thumb|200px|right|The [[infinity symbol]]]]
'''Infinity''' (symbol: {{math|∞|size=150%}}) is a concept describing something without any bound or larger than any [[natural number]]. Philosophers have speculated about the nature of the infinite, for example [[Zeno of Elea]], who proposed many [[paradox]]es involving infinity, and [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]], who used the idea of infinitely small quantities in his [[method of exhaustion]]. Modern mathematics uses the general concept of infinity in the solution of many practical and theoretical problems, such as in [[calculus]] and [[set theory]], and the idea is also used in [[physics]] and the other sciences.

In mathematics, "infinity" is often treated as a [[number]] (i.e., it counts or measures things: "an infinite number of terms") but it is not the same sort of number as either a [[natural number|natural]] or a [[real number|real]] number.

[[Georg Cantor]] formalized many ideas related to infinity and [[infinite set]]s during the late&amp;nbsp;19th and early 20th&amp;nbsp;centuries. In the theory he developed, there are infinite sets of different sizes (called [[cardinality|cardinalities]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the set of [[integer]]s is [[Countable set|countably infinite]], while the infinite set of real numbers is [[Uncountable set|uncountable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maddox|2002|loc=pp. 113 –117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Infinity (philosophy)}}
Ancient cultures had various ideas about the nature of infinity. The [[Maurya Empire|ancient Indians]] and [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] did not define infinity in precise formalism as does modern mathematics, and instead approached infinity as a philosophical concept.

===Early Greek===
The earliest recorded idea of infinity comes from [[Anaximander]], a [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] Greek philosopher who lived in [[Miletus]]. He used the word [[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]] which means infinite or limitless.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wallace|2004|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the earliest attestable accounts of mathematical infinity come from [[Zeno of Elea]] (born {{circa|490 BCE}}), a [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] Greek philosopher of southern Italy and member of the [[Eleatics|Eleatic]] School founded by [[Parmenides]]. [[Aristotle]] called him the inventor of the [[dialectic]].&lt;ref name="Zeno's paradoxes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/ |title=Zeno's Paradoxes | author= |date=October 15, 2010 |website=Stanford University |accessdate=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zeno-elea/|title=Zeno of Elea| author= |date=January 5, 2017 |website=Stanford University |accessdate=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for [[Zeno's paradoxes|his paradoxes]],&lt;ref name="Zeno's paradoxes" /&gt; described by [[Bertrand Russell]] as "immeasurably subtle and profound".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Russell|1996|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with the traditional view of Aristotle, the [[Hellenistic]] Greeks generally preferred to distinguish the potential infinity from the [[actual infinity]]; for example, instead of saying that there are an infinity of primes, [[Euclid]] prefers instead to say that there are more prime numbers than contained in any given collection of [[prime number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Euclid. [[Euclid's Elements]], Book&amp;nbsp;IX, Proposition&amp;nbsp;20.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, recent readings of the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]] have found that [[Archimedes]] had an understanding about actual infinite quantities. According to ''Nonlinear Dynamic Systems and Controls'', Archimedes has been found to be "the first to rigorously address the science of infinity with infinitely large sets using precise mathematical proofs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wassim M. Haddad|author2=VijaySekhar Chellaboina|title=Nonlinear Dynamical Systems and Control: A Lyapunov-Based Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F8rRb33X-E8C&amp;pg=PAxxv|date=February 17, 2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-13329-8|page=xxv|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404054122/https://books.google.com/books?id=F8rRb33X-E8C&amp;pg=PAxxv|archivedate=April 4, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Indian===
The [[Indian mathematics|Jain mathematical]] text [[Sūryaprajapti|Surya Prajnapti]] (c. 4th–3rd century BCE) classifies all numbers into three sets: [[enumerable]], innumerable, and infinite. Each of these was further subdivided into three orders:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Stewart|title=Infinity: a Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iewwDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117|date=March 23, 2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-875523-4|page=117|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403200429/https://books.google.com/books?id=iewwDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117|archivedate=April 3, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Enumerable: lowest, intermediate, and highest
* Innumerable: nearly innumerable, truly innumerable, and innumerably innumerable
* Infinite: nearly infinite, truly infinite, infinitely infinite

In this work, two basic types of infinite numbers are distinguished. On both physical and [[Ontology|ontological]] grounds, a distinction was made between [[Asaṃkhyeya|{{IAST|''asaṃkhyāta''}}]] ("countless, innumerable") and ''[[Ananta (infinite)|ananta]]'' ("endless, unlimited"), between rigidly bounded and loosely bounded infinities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dutta|first1=Bidyarthi|title=Ranganathan's elucidation of subject in the light of 'Infinity (∞)'|journal=Annals of Library and Information Studies|date=December 2015|volume=62 |pages=255–264 |url=http://op.niscair.res.in/index.php/ALIS/article/view/11415/0|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===
European mathematicians started using infinite numbers and expressions in a systematic fashion in the 17th century. In 1655 [[John Wallis]] first used the notation &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; for such a number in his ''De sectionibus conicis'' and exploited it in area calculations by dividing the region into [[infinitesimal]] strips of width on the order of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{\infty}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cajori|1993|loc=Sec. 421, Vol. II, pg. 44}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in ''Arithmetica infinitorum'' (1655 also) he indicates infinite series, infinite products and infinite continued fractions by writing down a few terms or factors and then appending "&amp;c." For example, "1, 6, 12, 18, 24, &amp;c."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cajori|1993|loc=Sec. 435, Vol. II, pg. 58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1699 [[Isaac Newton]] wrote about equations with an infinite number of terms in his work ''[[De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Landmark Writings in Western Mathematics 1640-1940 |first1=Ivor |last1=Grattan-Guinness |publisher=Elsevier |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-08-045744-4 |page=62 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UdGBy8iLpocC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603085825/https://books.google.com/books?id=UdGBy8iLpocC |archivedate=2016-06-03 |df= }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=UdGBy8iLpocC&amp;pg=PA62 Extract of page 62]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematics==
[[Hermann Weyl]] opened a mathematico-philosophic address given in 1930 with:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Hermann|last=Weyl|title=Levels of Infinity / Selected Writings on Mathematics and Philosophy|editor=Peter Pesic|year=2012|publisher=Dover|isbn=978-0-486-48903-2|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=Mathematics is the science of the infinite.}}

===Infinity symbol===
{{main|Infinity symbol}}
The infinity symbol &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes called the [[lemniscate]]) is a mathematical symbol representing the concept of infinity. The symbol is encoded in [[Unicode]] at {{unichar|221E|infinity|html=}} and in [[LaTeX]] as &lt;code&gt;\infty&lt;/code&gt;.

It was introduced in 1655 by [[John Wallis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Calculus===

[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], one of the co-inventors of [[infinitesimal calculus]], speculated widely about infinite numbers and their use in mathematics. To Leibniz, both infinitesimals and infinite quantities were ideal entities, not of the same nature as appreciable quantities, but enjoying the same properties in accordance with the [[Law of Continuity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=continuity |title=Continuity and Infinitesimals |last=Bell |first=John Lane |author-link=John Lane Bell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

====Real analysis====

In [[real analysis]], the symbol &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, called "infinity", is used to denote an unbounded [[limit of a function|limit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1955|loc=p. 63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notation &lt;math&gt;x \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt; means that&amp;nbsp;''x'' grows without bound, and &lt;math&gt;x \to -\infty&lt;/math&gt; means that &amp;nbsp;''x'' decreases without bound. If ''f''(''t'') ≥ 0 for every&amp;nbsp;''t'', then&lt;ref&gt;These uses of infinity for integrals and series can be found in any standard calculus text, such as, {{harvnb|Swokowski|1983|pp=468–510}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{b} f(t)\, dt = \infty&lt;/math&gt; means that ''f''(''t'') does not bound a finite area from &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t)\, dt = \infty&lt;/math&gt; means that the area under ''f''(''t'') is infinite.
* &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t)\, dt = a&lt;/math&gt; means that the total area under ''f''(''t'') is finite, and equals &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;

Infinity is also used to describe [[infinite series]]:
* &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} f(i) = a&lt;/math&gt; means that the sum of the infinite series [[convergent series|converges]] to some real value &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} f(i) = \infty&lt;/math&gt; means that the sum of the infinite series [[divergent series|diverges]] in the specific sense that the partial sums grow without bound.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Infinity can be used not only to define a limit but as a value in the extended real number system. Points labeled &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; can be added to the [[topological space]] of the real numbers, producing the two-point [[compactification (mathematics)|compactification]] of the real numbers. Adding algebraic properties to this gives us the [[extended real number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; We can also treat &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; as the same, leading to the one-point compactification of the real numbers, which is the [[real projective line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gemignani|1990|loc=p. 177}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Projective geometry]] also refers to a [[line at infinity]] in plane geometry, a [[plane at infinity]] in three-dimensional space, and a [[hyperplane at infinity]] for general [[Dimension (mathematics and physics)|dimensions]], each consisting of [[Point at infinity|points at infinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Albrecht|last1=Beutelspacher|first2=Ute|last2=Rosenbaum|title=Projective Geometry / from foundations to applications|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-48364-3|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Complex analysis====
[[File:Riemann sphere1.svg|thumb|right|250px|By [[stereographic projection]], the complex plane can be "wrapped" onto a sphere, with the top point of the sphere corresponding to infinity. This is called the [[Riemann sphere]].]]

In [[complex analysis]] the symbol &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, called "infinity", denotes an unsigned infinite [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]]. &lt;math&gt;x \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt; means that the magnitude&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;|x|&lt;/math&gt; of&amp;nbsp;''x'' grows beyond any assigned value. A [[point at infinity|point labeled &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;]] can be added to the complex plane as a [[topological space]] giving the one-point [[compactification (mathematics)|compactification]] of the complex plane. When this is done, the resulting space is a one-dimensional [[complex manifold]], or [[Riemann surface]], called the extended complex plane or the [[Riemann sphere]]. Arithmetic operations similar to those given above for the extended real numbers can also be defined, though there is no distinction in the signs (therefore one exception is that infinity cannot be added to itself). On the other hand, this kind of infinity enables division by zero, namely &lt;math&gt;z/0 = \infty&lt;/math&gt; for any nonzero complex number&amp;nbsp;''z''. In this context it is often useful to consider [[meromorphic function]]s as maps into the Riemann sphere taking the value of &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; at the poles. The domain of a complex-valued function may be extended to include the point at infinity as well. One important example of such functions is the group of [[Möbius transformation]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Nonstandard analysis===
[[File:Números hiperreales.png|450px|thumb|Infinitesimals (ε) and infinites (ω) on the hyperreal number line (1/ε = ω/1)]]

The original formulation of [[infinitesimal calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] used [[infinitesimal]] quantities. In the twentieth century, it was shown that this treatment could be put on a rigorous footing through various [[logical system]]s, including [[smooth infinitesimal analysis]] and [[nonstandard analysis]]. In the latter, infinitesimals are invertible, and their inverses are infinite numbers. The infinities in this sense are part of a [[hyperreal number|hyperreal field]]; there is no equivalence between them as with the Cantorian [[transfinite number|transfinites]]. For example, if&amp;nbsp;H is an infinite number, then H&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;H&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2H and H&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 are distinct infinite numbers. This approach to [[non-standard calculus]] is fully developed in {{harvtxt|Keisler|1986}}.

===Set theory===
{{Main|Cardinality|Ordinal number}}

[[File:Infinity paradoxon - one-to-one correspondence between infinite set and proper subset.gif|thumb|One-to-one correspondence between infinite set and proper subset]]

A different form of "infinity" are the [[Ordinal number|ordinal]] and [[cardinal number|cardinal]] infinities of set theory. [[Georg Cantor]] developed a system of [[transfinite number]]s, in which the first transfinite cardinal is [[aleph-null]] (&lt;span style="font-family:'Cambria Math';"&gt;&lt;big&gt;ℵ&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--&lt;math&gt;(\aleph_0)&lt;/math&gt;--&gt;), the cardinality of the set of [[natural number]]s. This modern mathematical conception of the quantitative infinite developed in the late nineteenth century from work by Cantor, [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Richard Dedekind]] and others, using the idea of collections, or sets.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Dedekind's approach was essentially to adopt the idea of [[one-to-one correspondence]] as a standard for comparing the size of sets, and to reject the view of Galileo (which derived from [[Euclid]]) that the whole cannot be the same size as the part (however, see [[Galileo's paradox]] where he concludes that positive integers which are squares and all positive integers are the same size). An infinite set can simply be defined as one having the same size as at least one of its [[proper subset|proper]] parts; this notion of infinity is called [[Dedekind infinite]]. The diagram gives an example: viewing lines as infinite sets of points, the left half of the lower blue line can be mapped in a one-to-one manner (green correspondences) to the higher blue line, and, in turn, to the whole lower blue line (red correspondences); therefore the whole lower blue line and its left half have the same cardinality, i.e. "size".{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Cantor defined two kinds of infinite numbers: ordinal numbers and cardinal numbers. Ordinal numbers may be identified with [[well-ordered]] sets, or counting carried on to any stopping point, including points after an infinite number have already been counted. Generalizing finite and the ordinary infinite [[sequence]]s which are maps from the positive [[integers]] leads to [[Map (mathematics)|mappings]] from ordinal numbers, and transfinite sequences. Cardinal numbers define the size of sets, meaning how many members they contain, and can be standardized by choosing the first ordinal number of a certain size to represent the cardinal number of that size. The smallest ordinal infinity is that of the positive integers, and any set which has the cardinality of the integers is [[countable set|countably infinite]]. If a set is too large to be put in one to one correspondence with the positive integers, it is called ''uncountable''. Cantor's views prevailed and modern mathematics accepts actual infinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2014}}  Certain extended number systems, such as the [[hyperreal number]]s, incorporate the ordinary (finite) numbers and infinite numbers of different sizes.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

====Cardinality of the continuum====
{{Main|Cardinality of the continuum}}

One of Cantor's most important results was that the cardinality of the continuum &lt;math&gt;\mathbf c&lt;/math&gt; is greater than that of the natural numbers &lt;math&gt;{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;; that is, there are more real numbers '''R''' than natural numbers '''N'''. Namely, Cantor showed that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c} = 2^{\aleph_0} &gt; {\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Cantor's diagonal argument]] or [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Dauben

The [[continuum hypothesis]] states that there is no [[cardinal number]] between the cardinality of the reals and the cardinality of the natural numbers, that is, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c} = \aleph_1 = \beth_1 &lt;/math&gt;  (see [[Beth number#Beth one|Beth one]]).  This hypothesis can neither be proved nor disproved within the widely accepted [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], even assuming the [[Axiom of Choice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|1963|p=1143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cardinal arithmetic]] can be used to show not only that the number of points in a [[real number line]] is equal to the number of points in any [[line segment|segment]] of that line, but that this is equal to the number of points on a plane and, indeed, in any [[finite-dimensional]] space.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

[[File:Peanocurve.svg|thumb|The first three steps of a fractal construction whose limit is a [[space-filling curve]], showing that there are as many points in a one-dimensional line as in a two-dimensional square.]]
The first of these results is apparent by considering, for instance, the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangent]] function, which provides a [[one-to-one correspondence]] between the [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] (−π/2, π/2) and&amp;nbsp;'''R''' (see also [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]]). The second result was proved by Cantor in&amp;nbsp;1878, but only became intuitively apparent in&amp;nbsp;1890, when [[Giuseppe Peano]] introduced the [[space-filling curve]]s, curved lines that twist and turn enough to fill the whole of any square, or [[cube]], or [[hypercube]], or finite-dimensional space. These curves can be used to define a one-to-one correspondence between the points on one side of a square and the points in the square.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sagan|1994|pp=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geometry and topology===
{{Main|Dimension (vector space)}}

Infinite-[[dimension]]al spaces are widely used in [[geometry]] and [[topology]], particularly as [[classifying space]]s, such as [[Eilenberg−MacLane space]]s. Common examples are the infinite-dimensional [[complex projective space]] [[K(Z,2)]] and the infinite-dimensional [[real projective space]] K(Z/2Z,1).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Fractals===
The structure of a [[fractal]] object is reiterated in its magnifications. Fractals can be magnified indefinitely without losing their structure and becoming "smooth"; they have infinite perimeters—some with infinite, and others with finite surface areas. One such fractal curve with an infinite perimeter and finite surface area is the [[Koch snowflake]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Mathematics without infinity===
[[Leopold Kronecker]] was skeptical of the notion of infinity and how his fellow mathematicians were using it in the 1870s and 1880s. This skepticism was developed in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] called [[finitism]], an extreme form of mathematical philosophy in the general philosophical and mathematical schools of [[Mathematical constructivism|constructivism]] and [[intuitionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kline|1972|pp=1197–1198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physics==

In [[physics]], approximations of [[real number]]s are used for [[Continuum (theory)|continuous]] measurements and [[natural number]]s are used for [[countable|discrete]] measurements (i.e. counting). It is therefore assumed by physicists that no [[observable|measurable quantity]] could have an infinite value, {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} for instance by taking an infinite value in an [[extended real number line|extended real number]] system, or by requiring the counting of an infinite number of events. It is, for example, presumed impossible for any type of body to have infinite mass or infinite energy. Concepts of infinite things such as an infinite [[plane wave]] exist, but there are no experimental means to generate them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doriclenses.com/administrer/upload/pdf/NOT_AXI_ENG_070212_doricl97_doricle_kvgwQP.pdf Doric Lenses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124011604/http://www.doriclenses.com/administrer/upload/pdf/NOT_AXI_ENG_070212_doricl97_doricle_kvgwQP.pdf |date=2013-01-24 }} – Application Note – Axicons – 2. Intensity Distribution. Retrieved 7 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theoretical applications of physical infinity===
The practice of refusing infinite values for measurable quantities does not come from ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' or ideological motivations, but rather from more methodological and pragmatic motivations {{Disputed inline|date=November 2015}} {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}. One of the needs of any physical and scientific theory is to give usable formulas that correspond to or at least approximate reality. As an example, if any object of infinite gravitational mass were to exist, any usage of the formula to calculate the gravitational force would lead to an infinite result, which would be of no benefit since the result would be always the same regardless of the position and the mass of the other object. The formula would be useful neither to compute the force between two objects of finite mass nor to compute their motions. If an infinite mass object were to exist, any object of finite mass would be attracted with infinite force (and hence acceleration) by the infinite mass object, which is not what we can observe in reality. Sometimes infinite result of a physical quantity may mean that the theory being used to compute the result may be approaching the point where it fails. This may help to indicate the limitations of a theory.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

This point of view does not mean that infinity cannot be used in physics. For convenience's sake, calculations, equations, theories and approximations often use [[infinite series]], unbounded [[function (mathematics)|functions]], etc., and may involve infinite quantities. Physicists however require that the end result be physically meaningful. In [[quantum field theory]] infinities arise which need to be interpreted in such a way as to lead to a physically meaningful result, a process called [[renormalization]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

However, there are some theoretical circumstances where the end result is infinity. One example is the [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] in the description of [[black holes]]. Some solutions of the equations of the [[general theory of relativity]] allow for finite mass distributions of zero size, and thus infinite density. This is an example of what is called a [[mathematical singularity]], or a point where a physical theory breaks down. This does not necessarily mean that physical infinities exist; it may mean simply that the theory is incapable of describing the situation properly. Two other examples occur in inverse-square force laws of the gravitational force equation of [[Newtonian gravity]] and [[Coulomb's law]] of electrostatics. At&amp;nbsp;r=0 these equations evaluate to infinities.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Cosmology===
The first published proposal that the universe is infinite came from Thomas Digges in 1576.&lt;ref&gt;John Gribbin (2009), ''In Search of the Multiverse: Parallel Worlds, Hidden Dimensions, and the Ultimate Quest for the Frontiers of Reality'', {{isbn|9780470613528}}. p.&amp;nbsp;88&lt;/ref&gt; Eight years later, in 1584, the Italian philosopher and astronomer [[Giordano Bruno]] proposed an unbounded universe in ''On the Infinite Universe and Worlds'': "Innumerable suns exist; innumerable earths revolve around these suns in a manner similar to the way the seven planets revolve around our sun. Living beings inhabit these worlds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Alien Life Imagined: Communicating the Science and Culture of Astrobiology |edition=illustrated |first1=Mark |last1=Brake |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-521-49129-7 |page=63 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sWGqzfL0snEC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=sWGqzfL0snEC&amp;pg=PA63 Extract of page 63]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cosmology|Cosmologists]] have long sought to discover whether infinity exists in our physical [[universe]]: Are there an infinite number of stars? Does the universe have infinite volume? Does space [[Shape of the universe|"go on forever"]]? This is an open question of [[physical cosmology|cosmology]]. The question of being infinite is logically separate from the question of having boundaries. The two-dimensional surface of the Earth, for example, is finite, yet has no edge. By travelling in a straight line with respect to the Earth's curvature one will eventually return to the exact spot one started from. The universe, at least in principle, might have a similar [[topology]]. If so, one might eventually return to one's starting point after travelling in a straight line through the universe for long enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In Quest of the Universe |edition=illustrated |first1=Theo |last1=Koupelis |first2=Karl F. |last2=Kuhn |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7637-4387-1 |page=553 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6rTttN4ZdyoC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=6rTttN4ZdyoC&amp;pg=PA553 Extract of page 553]&lt;/ref&gt;

The curvature of the universe can be measured through [[multipole moments]] in the spectrum of the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|cosmic background radiation]]. As to date, analysis of the radiation patterns recorded by the [[WMAP]] spacecraft hints that the universe has a flat topology. This would be consistent with an infinite physical universe.&lt;ref name="NASA_Shape"&gt;{{cite web| title=Will the Universe expand forever?| url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_shape.html| publisher=NASA| date=24 January 2014| accessdate=16 March 2015| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601032707/http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_shape.html| archivedate=1 June 2012| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fermi_Flat"&gt;{{cite web| title=Our universe is Flat| url=http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/april-2015/our-flat-universe?email_issue=725| publisher=FermiLab/SLAC| date=7 April 2015| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410200411/http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/april-2015/our-flat-universe?email_issue=725| archivedate=10 April 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Unexpected connections|author=Marcus Y. Yoo|journal=Engineering &amp; Science|publisher=[[Caltech]]|volume=LXXIV1|date=2011|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the universe could be finite, even if its curvature is flat. An easy way to understand this is to consider two-dimensional examples, such as video games where items that leave one edge of the screen reappear on the other. The topology of such games is toroidal and the geometry is flat. Many possible bounded, flat possibilities also exist for three-dimensional space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weeks|first=Jeffrey|title=The Shape of Space|date=December 12, 2001|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0824707095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of infinity also extends to the [[multiverse]] hypothesis, which, when explained by astrophysicists such as [[Michio Kaku]], posits that there are an infinite number and variety of universes.&lt;ref&gt;Kaku, M. (2006). Parallel worlds. Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logic==
In [[logic]] an [[infinite regress]] argument is "a distinctively philosophical kind of argument purporting to show that a thesis is defective because it generates an infinite series when either (form&amp;nbsp;A) no such series exists or (form&amp;nbsp;B) were it to exist, the thesis would lack the role (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;of justification) that it is supposed to play."&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'', Second Edition, p.&amp;nbsp;429&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computing==
The [[IEEE&amp;nbsp;floating-point]] standard (IEEE 754) specifies the positive and negative infinity values (and also [[NaN|indefinite]] values). These are defined as the result of [[arithmetic overflow]], [[division by zero]], and other exceptional operations.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt; allow the programmer an explicit access to the positive and negative infinity values as language constants. These can be used as [[Greatest element|greatest and least elements]], as they compare (respectively) greater than or less than all other values. They have uses as [[sentinel value]]s in [[algorithm]]s involving [[sorting]], [[Search algorithm|searching]], or [[window function|windowing]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In languages that do not have greatest and least elements, but do allow [[operator overloading|overloading]] of [[relational operator]]s, it is possible for a programmer to ''create'' the greatest and least elements. In languages that do not provide explicit access to such values from the initial state of the program, but do implement the floating-point [[data type]], the infinity values may still be accessible and usable as the result of certain operations.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Arts, games, and cognitive sciences==
[[Perspective (graphical)|Perspective]] artwork utilizes the concept of [[vanishing point]]s, roughly corresponding to mathematical [[point at infinity|points at infinity]], located at an infinite distance from the observer. This allows artists to create paintings that realistically render space, distances, and forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1486">'''Julius Richard Büchi''' (1924–1984) was a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[logician]] and [[mathematician]].

He received his Dr. sc. nat. in 1950 at the [[ETH Zürich]] under supervision of [[Paul Bernays]] and [[Ferdinand Gonseth]]. Shortly afterwards he went to [[Purdue University]], [[Lafayette (Indiana)|Lafayette]], [[Indiana]]. He and his first student [[Lawrence Landweber]] had a major influence on the development of [[theoretical computer science]].

Together with his friend [[Saunders Mac Lane]], a student of [[Paul Bernays]] as well, Büchi published numerous celebrated works. He invented what is now known as the [[Büchi automaton]], a [[finite state automaton]] accepting certain collections of [[infinite word]]s known as [[omega-regular languages]]. The "''n'' squares' problem", known also as [[Büchi's Problem|Büchi's problem]], is an open problem from [[number theory]], closely related to [[Hilbert's tenth problem]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1408">In mathematics, an '''LLT polynomial''' is one of a family of [[symmetric function]]s introduced by [[Alain Lascoux]], Bernard Leclerc, and Jean-Yves Thibon (1997) as [[q-analog|''q''-analogues]] of products of [[Schur polynomial|Schur functions]].

J. Haglund, [[M. Haiman]], N. Loehr (2005) showed how to expand [[Macdonald polynomial]]s in terms of LLT polynomials. [[Ian Grojnowski]] and [[Mark Haiman]] (preprint) proved a positivity conjecture for LLT polynomials that combined with the previous result implies the [[Macdonald positivity conjecture]] for [[Macdonald polynomials]], and extended the definition of LLT polynomials to arbitrary finite root systems.

LP-type problems include many important optimization problems that are not themselves linear programs, such as the problem of finding the [[Smallest circle problem|smallest circle]] containing a given set of planar points. They may be solved by a combination of [[randomized algorithm]]s in an amount of time that is [[linear time|linear]] in the number of elements defining the problem, and subexponential in the dimension of the problem.

==Definition==
LP-type problems were defined by {{harvtxt|Sharir|Welzl|1992}} as problems in which one is given as input a finite set {{mvar|S}} of elements, and a function {{mvar|f}} that maps subsets of {{mvar|S}} to values from a totally ordered set. The function is required to satisfy two key properties:
*Monotonicity: for every two sets {{math|''A'' ⊆ ''B'' ⊆ ''S''}}, ''f''(''A'') ≤ ''f''(''B'') ≤ ''f''(''S'').
*Locality: for every two sets {{math|''A'' ⊆ ''B'' ⊆ ''S''}} and every element {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|S}}, if {{math|1=''f''(''A'') = ''f''(''B'') = ''f''(''A'' ∪ {''x''})}}, then {{math|1=''f''(''A'') = ''f''(''B'' ∪ {''x''})}}.

A ''basis'' of an LP-type problem is a set {{math|''B'' ⊆ ''S''}} with the property that every proper subset of {{mvar|B}} has a smaller value of {{mvar|f}} than {{mvar|B}} itself, and the ''dimension'' (or ''combinatorial dimension'') of an LP-type problem is defined to be the maximum [[cardinality]] of a basis.

It is assumed that an optimization algorithm may evaluate the function {{mvar|f}} only on sets that are themselves bases or that are formed by adding a single element to a basis. Alternatively, the algorithm may be restricted to two primitive operations: a ''violation test'' that determines, for a basis {{mvar|B}} and an element {{mvar|x}} whether {{math|1=''f''(''B'') = ''f''(''B'' ∪ {''x''})}}, and a ''basis computation'' that (with the same inputs) finds a basis of {{math|''B'' ∪ {''x''}}}. The task for the algorithm to perform is to evaluate {{math|''f''(''S'')}} by only using these restricted evaluations or primitives.

==Examples and applications==
A [[linear program]] may be defined by a system of {{mvar|d}} non-negative [[Function of a real variable|real variables]], subject to {{mvar|n}} linear inequality constraints, together with a non-negative linear objective function to be minimized. This may be placed into the framework of LP-type problems by letting {{mvar|S}} be the set of constraints, and defining {{math|''f''(''A'')}} (for a subset {{mvar|A}} of the constraints) to be the minimum objective function value of the smaller linear program defined by {{mvar|A}}. With suitable general position assumptions (in order to prevent multiple solution points having the same optimal objective function value), this satisfies the monotonicity and locality requirements of an LP-type problem, and has combinatorial dimension equal to the number {{mvar|d}} of variables.&lt;ref name="msw96"&gt;{{harvtxt|Matoušek|Sharir|Welzl|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, an [[integer program]] (consisting of a collection of linear constraints and a linear objective function, as in a linear program, but with the additional restriction that the variables must take on only integer values) satisfies both the monotonicity and locality properties of an LP-type problem, with the same general position assumptions as for linear programs. Theorems of {{harvtxt|Bell|1977}} and {{harvtxt|Scarf|1977}} show that, for an integer program with {{mvar|d}} variables, the combinatorial dimension is at most&amp;nbsp;{{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="msw96"/&gt;

Many natural optimization problems in [[computational geometry]] are LP-type:
[[Image:Smallest circle problem.svg|thumb|240px|Smallest circle problem]]
*The [[smallest circle problem]] is the problem of finding the minimum radius of a circle containing a given set of {{mvar|n}} points in the plane. It satisfies monotonicity (adding more points can only make the circle larger) and locality (if the smallest circle for set {{mvar|A}} contains {{mvar|B}} and {{mvar|x}}, then the same circle also contains {{math|''B'' ∪ {''x''}}}). Because the smallest circle is always determined by some three points, the smallest circle problem has combinatorial dimension three, even though it is defined using two-dimensional Euclidean geometry.&lt;ref&gt;Although the smallest circle problem was first stated to be an LP-type problem by {{harvtxt|Matoušek|Sharir|Welzl|1996}}, several earlier papers described algorithms for this problem based on ideas from low-dimensional linear programming, including {{harvtxt|Megiddo|1983}} and {{harvtxt|Welzl|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, the smallest enclosing ball of points in {{mvar|d}} dimensions forms an LP-type problem of combinatorial dimension {{math|''d'' + 1}}. The smallest circle problem can be generalized to the smallest ball enclosing a set of balls,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fischer|Gärtner|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to the smallest ball that touches or surrounds each of a set of balls,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Löffler|van Kreveld|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to the weighted [[1-center problem]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Dyer|1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or to similar smaller enclosing ball problems in non-Euclidean spaces such as the space with distances defined by [[Bregman divergence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nielsen|Nock|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The related problem of finding the smallest enclosing [[ellipsoid]] is also an LP-type problem, but with a larger combinatorial dimension, {{math|''d''(''d'' + 3)/2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Matoušek|Sharir|Welzl|1996}}; {{harvtxt|Welzl|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Let {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ...}} be a sequence of {{mvar|n}} [[convex set]]s in {{mvar|d}}-dimensional Euclidean space, and suppose that we wish to find the longest [[Prefix (computer science)|prefix]] of this sequence that has a common intersection point. This may be expressed as an LP-type problem in which {{math|1=''f''(''A'') = &amp;minus;''i''}} where ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the first member of ''A'' that does not belong to an intersecting prefix of ''A'', and where {{math|1=''f''(''A'') = &amp;minus;''n''}} if there is no such member. The combinatorial dimension of this system is {{math|''d'' + 1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Chan|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Suppose we are given a collection of axis-aligned rectangular boxes in three-dimensional space, and wish to find a line directed into the positive octant of space that cuts through all the boxes. This may be expressed as an LP-type problem with combinatorial dimension 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Amenta|1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The problem of finding the closest distance between two [[convex polytope]]s, specified by their sets of vertices, may be represented as an LP-type problem. In this formulation, the set {{mvar|S}} is the set of all vertices in both polytopes, and the function value {{math|''f''(''A'')}} is the negation of the smallest distance between the [[convex hull]]s of the two subsets {{mvar|''A''}} of vertices in the two polytopes. The combinatorial dimension of the problem is {{math|''d'' + 1}} if the two polytopes are disjoint, or {{math|''d'' + 2}} if they have a nonempty intersection.&lt;ref name="msw96"/&gt;
*Let {{math|1=''S'' = {''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ...}}} be a set of [[quasiconvex function]]s. Then the pointwise maximum {{math|max&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is itself quasiconvex, and the problem of finding the minimum value of {{math|max&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is an LP-type problem. It has combinatorial dimension at most {{math|2''d'' + 1}}, where {{mvar|d}} is the dimension of the domain of the functions, but for sufficiently smooth functions the combinatorial dimension is smaller, at most {{math|''d'' + 1}}. Many other LP-type problems can also be expressed using quasiconvex functions in this way; for instance, the smallest enclosing circle problem is the problem of minimizing {{math|max&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} where each of the functions {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} measures the Euclidean distance from one of the given points.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Amenta|Bern|Eppstein|1999}}; {{harvtxt|Eppstein|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

LP-type problems have also been used to determine the optimal outcomes of certain games in [[algorithmic game theory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Halman|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; improve vertex placement in [[finite element method]] meshes,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Amenta|Bern|Eppstein|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; solve [[facility location]] problems,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Puerto|Rodríguez-Chía|Tamir|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; analyze the time complexity of certain exponential-time search algorithms,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Eppstein|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and reconstruct the three-dimensional positions of objects from their two-dimensional images.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Li|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algorithms==

===Seidel===
{{harvtxt|Seidel|1991}} gave an algorithm for low-dimensional linear programming that may be adapted to the LP-type problem framework. Seidel's algorithm takes as input the set {{mvar|S}} and a separate set {{mvar|X}} (initially empty) of elements known to belong to the optimal basis. It then considers the remaining elements one-by-one in a random order, performing violation tests for each one and, depending on the result, performing a recursive call to the same algorithm with a larger set of known basis elements. It may be expressed with the following pseudocode:

&lt;source lang="python"&gt;def seidel(S,f,X):
    R = empty set
    B = X
    for x in a random permutation of S:
        if f(B) ≠ f(B ∪ {x}):
            B = seidel(R,f, basis(X ∪ {x}))
        R = R ∪ {x}
    return B&lt;/source&gt;

In a problem with combinatorial dimension {{mvar|d}}, the violation test in the {{mvar|i}}th iteration of the algorithm fails only when {{mvar|x}} is one of the {{math|''d'' &amp;minus; {{mabs|''X''}} }} remaining basis elements, which happens with probability at most {{math|(''d'' &amp;minus; {{mabs|''X''}})/''i''}}. Based on this calculation, it can be shown that overall the expected number of violation tests performed by the algorithm is {{math|O(''d''! n)}}, linear in {{mvar|n}} but worse than exponential in {{mvar|d}}.

===Clarkson===
{{harvtxt|Clarkson|1995}} defines two algorithms, a recursive algorithm and an iterative algorithm, for linear programming based on random sampling techniques, and suggests a combination of the two that calls the iterative algorithm from the recursive algorithm. The recursive algorithm repeatedly chooses random samples whose size is approximately the square root of the input size, solves the sampled problem recursively, and then uses violation tests to find a subset of the remaining elements that must include at least one basis element:

&lt;source lang="python"&gt;def recursive(S,f):
    X = empty set
    repeat:
        R = a random subset of S with size d√n
        B = basis for R ∪ X, computed recursively
        V = {x | f(B) ≠ f(B ∪ {x})}
        X = X ∪ V
    until V is empty
    return B&lt;/source&gt;

In each iteration, the expected size of {{mvar|V}} is {{math|O({{radic|''n''}})}},&lt;ref&gt;Tail bounds on the size of {{mvar|V}} are also known: see {{harvtxt|Gärtner|Welzl|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and whenever {{mvar|V}} is nonempty it includes at least one new element of the eventual basis of {{mvar|S}}. Therefore, the algorithm performs at most {{mvar|d}} iterations, each of which performs {{mvar|n}} violation tests and makes a single recursive call to a subproblem of size {{math|O(''d''{{radic|''n''}})}}.

Clarkson's iterative algorithm assigns weights to each element of {{mvar|S}}, initially all of them equal. It then chooses a set {{mvar|R}} of {{math|9''d''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} elements from {{mvar|S}} at random, and computes the sets {{mvar|B}} and {{mvar|V}} as in the previous algorithm. If the total weight of {{mvar|V}} is at most {{math|2/(9''d'' &amp;minus; 1)}} times the total weight of {{mvar|S}} (as happens with constant probability) then the algorithm doubles the weights of every element of {{mvar|V}}, and as before it repeats this process until {{mvar|V}} becomes empty. In each iteration, the weight of the optimal basis can be shown to increase at a greater rate than the total weight of {{mvar|S}}, from which it follows that the algorithm must terminate within {{math|O(log ''n'')}} iterations.

By using the recursive algorithm to solve a given problem, switching to the iterative algorithm for its recursive calls, and then switching again to Seidel's algorithm for the calls made by the iterative algorithm, it is possible solve a given LP-type problem using {{math|O(''dn'' + ''d''! ''d''&lt;sup&gt;O(1)&lt;/sup&gt; log ''n'')}} violation tests.

When applied to a linear program, this algorithm can be interpreted as being a dual [[simplex method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kalai|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With certain additional computational primitives beyond the violation test and basis computation primitives, this method can be made deterministic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Chazelle|Matoušek|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Matoušek, Sharir, and Welzl===
{{harvtxt|Matoušek|Sharir|Welzl|1996}} describe an algorithm that uses an additional property of linear programs that is not always held by other LP-type problems, that all bases have the same cardinality of each other. If an LP-type problem does not have this property, it can be made to have it by adding {{math|''d''}} new dummy elements and by modifying the function {{mvar|f}} to return the [[ordered pair]] of its old value {{math|''f''(''A'')}} and of the number {{math|min(''d'',{{!}}''A''{{!}})}}, ordered [[lexicographic order|lexicographically]].

Rather than adding elements of ''S'' one at a time, or finding samples of the elements, {{harvtxt|Matoušek|Sharir|Welzl|1996}} describe an algorithm that removes elements one at a time. At each step it maintains a basis {{mvar|C}} that may initially be the set of dummy elements. It may be described with the following pseudocode:

&lt;source lang="python"&gt;def msw(S,f,C):
    if S = C:
        return C
    choose a random element x of S \ C
    B = msw(S \ x, f, C)
    if f(B) ≠ f(B ∪ {x}):
        B = basis(B ∪ {x})
        B = msw(S, f, B)
    return B&lt;/source&gt;

In most of the recursive calls of the algorithm, the violation test succeeds and the if statement is skipped. However, with a small probability the violation test fails and the algorithm makes an additional basis computation and then an additional recursive call. As the authors show, the expected time for the algorithm is linear in ''n'' and exponential in the square root of {{math|''d'' log ''n''}}. By combining this method with Clarkson's recursive and iterative procedures, these two forms of time dependence can be separated out from each other, resulting in an algorithm that performs O(''dn'') violation tests in the outer recursive algorithm and a number that is exponential in the square root of {{math|''d'' log ''d''}} in the lower levels of the algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Matoušek|Sharir|Welzl|1996}}. A very similar time bound for linear programming was also given by {{harvtxt|Kalai|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==

===Optimization with outliers===
{{harvtxt|Matoušek|1995}} considers a variation of LP-type optimization problems in which one is given, together with the set {{mvar|S}} and the objective function {{mvar|f}}, a number {{mvar|k}}; the task is to remove {{mvar|k}} elements from {{mvar|S}} in order to make the objective function on the remaining set as small as possible. For instance, when applied to the smallest circle problem, this would give the smallest circle that contains all but {{mvar|k}} of a given set of planar points. He shows that, for all non-degenerate LP-type problems (that is, problems in which all bases have distinct values) this problem may be solved in time {{math|O(''nk''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, by solving a set of {{math|O(''k''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} LP-type problems defined by subsets of {{mvar|S}}.

===Implicit problems===
Some geometric optimization problems may be expressed as LP-type problems in which the number of elements in the LP-type formulation is significantly greater than the number of input data values for the optimization problem. As an example, consider a collection of {{mvar|n}} points in the plane, each moving with constant velocity. At any point in time, the [[diameter]] of this system is the maximum distance between two of its points. The problem of finding a time at which the diameter is minimized can be formulated as minimizing the pointwise maximum of {{math|O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} quasiconvex functions, one for each pair of points, measuring the Euclidean distance between the pair as a function of time. Thus, it can be solved as an LP-type problem of combinatorial dimension two on a set of {{math|O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} elements, but this set is significantly larger than the number of input points.&lt;ref&gt;The LP-type formulation of this problem was given by {{harvtxt|Chan|2004}}, but it was studied earlier using other algorithmic methods by {{harvtxt|Gupta|Janardan|Smid|1996}}. Chan also cites an unpublished manuscript by Clarkson for an {{math|O(''n'' log ''n'')}} time algorithm, matching the time that can be achieved by the implicit LP-type approach.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{harvtxt|Chan|2004}} describes an algorithm for solving implicitly defined LP-type problems such as this one in which each LP-type element is determined by a {{mvar|k}}-tuple of input values, for some constant {{mvar|k}}. In order to apply his approach, there must exist a ''decision algorithm'' that can determine, for a given LP-type basis {{mvar|B}} and set {{mvar|S}} of {{mvar|n}} input values, whether {{mvar|B}} is a basis for the LP-type problem determined by {{mvar|S}}.

Chan's algorithm performs the following steps:
*If the number of input values is below some threshold value, find the set of LP-type elements that it determines and solve the resulting explicit LP-type problem.
*Otherwise, partition the input values into a suitable number greater than {{mvar|k}} of equal-sized subsets {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.
*If {{mvar|f}} is the objective function for the implicitly defined LP-type problem to be solved, then define a function {{mvar|g}} that maps collections of subsets {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} to the value of {{mvar|f}} on the union of the collection. Then the collection of subsets {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and the objective function {{mvar|g}} itself defines an LP-type problem, of the same dimension as the implicit problem to be solved.
*Solve the (explicit) LP-type problem defined by {{mvar|g}} using Clarkson's algorithm, which performs a linear number of violation tests and a polylogarithmic number of basis evaluations. The basis evaluations for {{mvar|g}} may be performed by recursive calls to Chan's algorithm, and the violation tests may be performed by calls to the decision algorithm.

With the assumption that the decision algorithm takes an amount of time {{math|O(''T''(''n''))}} that grows at least polynomially as a function of the input size {{mvar|n}}, Chan shows that the threshold for switching to an explicit LP formulation and the number of subsets in the partition can be chosen in such a way that the implicit LP-type optimization algorithm also runs in time {{math|O(''T''(''n''))}}.

For instance, for the minimum diameter of moving points, the decision algorithm needs only to calculate the diameter of a set of points at a fixed time, a problem that can be solved in {{math|O(''n'' log ''n'')}} time using the [[rotating calipers]] technique. Therefore, Chan's algorithm for finding the time at which the diameter is minimized also takes time {{math|O(''n'' log ''n'')}}.
Chan uses this method to find a point of maximal [[Centerpoint (geometry)|Tukey depth]] among a given collection of {{mvar|n}} points in {{mvar|d}}-dimensional Euclidean space, in time {{math|O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;''d'' &amp;minus; 1&lt;/sup&gt; + ''n'' log ''n'')}}. A similar technique was used by {{harvtxt|Braß|Heinrich-Litan|Morin|2003}} to find a point of maximal Tukey depth for the uniform distribution on a convex polygon.

==History and related problems==
The discovery of linear time algorithms for linear programming and the observation that the same algorithms could in many cases be used to solve geometric optimization problems that were not linear programs goes back at least to {{harvs|last=Megiddo|year=1983|year2=1984|txt}}, who gave a linear expected time algorithm for both three-variable linear programs and the smallest circle problem. However, Megiddo formulated the generalization of linear programming geometrically rather than combinatorially, as a [[convex optimization]] problem rather than as an abstract problem on systems of sets. Similarly, {{harvtxt|Dyer|1986}} and Clarkson (in the 1988 conference version of {{harvnb|Clarkson|1995}}) observed that their methods could be applied to convex programs as well as linear programs. {{harvtxt|Dyer|1992}} showed that the minimum enclosing ellipsoid problem could also be formulated as a convex optimization problem by adding a small number of non-linear constraints.  The use of randomization to improve the time bounds for low dimensional linear programming and related problems was pioneered by Clarkson and by {{harvtxt|Dyer|Frieze|1989}}.

The definition of LP-type problems in terms of functions satisfying the axioms of locality and monotonicity is from {{harvtxt|Sharir|Welzl|1992}}, but other authors in the same timeframe formulated alternative combinatorial generalizations of linear programs. For instance, in a framework developed by {{harvtxt|Gärtner|1995}}, the function {{mvar|f}} is replaced by a total ordering on the subsets of {{mvar|S}}. It is possible to break the ties in an LP-type problem to create a total order, but only at the expense of an increase in the combinatorial dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Matoušek|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, as in LP-type problems, Gärtner defines certain primitives for performing computations on subsets of elements; however, his formalization does not have an analogue of the combinatorial dimension.

Another abstract generalization of both linear programs and [[linear complementarity problem]]s, formulated by {{harvtxt|Stickney|Watson|1978}} and later studied by several other authors, concerns orientations of the edges of a [[hypercube]] with the property that every face of the hypercube (including the whole hypercube as a face) has a [[unique sink orientation|unique sink]], a vertex with no outgoing edges. An orientation of this type may be formed from an LP-type problem by corresponding the subsets of ''S'' with the vertices of a hypercube in such a way that two subsets differ by a single element if and only if the corresponding vertices are adjacent, and by orienting the edge between neighboring sets {{math|''A'' ⊆ ''B''}} towards {{mvar|B}} if {{math|''f''(''A'') ≠ ''f''(''B'')}} and towards {{mvar|A}} otherwise. The resulting orientation has the additional property that it forms a [[directed acyclic graph]], from which it can be shown that a randomized algorithm can find the unique sink of the whole hypercube (the optimal basis of the LP-type problem) in a number of steps exponential in the square root of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|n}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Szabó|Welzl|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The more recently developed framework of [[violator space]]s generalizes LP-type problems, in the sense that every LP-type problem can be modeled by a violator space but not necessarily vice versa. Violator spaces are defined similarly to LP-type problems, by a function {{mvar|f}} that maps sets to objective function values, but the values of {{mvar|f}} are not ordered. Despite the lack of ordering, every set {{mvar|S}} has a well-defined set of bases (the minimal sets with the same value as the whole set) that can be found by variations of Clarkson's algorithms for LP-type problems. Indeed, violator spaces have been shown to exactly characterize the systems that can be solved by Clarkson's algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gärtner|Matoušek|Rüst|Škovroň|2008}}; {{harvtxt|Brise|Gärtner|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[information theory]], the '''limiting density of discrete points''' is an adjustment to the formula of [[Claude Shannon]] for [[differential entropy]].

It was formulated by [[Edwin Thompson Jaynes]] to address defects in the initial definition of differential entropy.

== Definition ==
Shannon originally wrote down the following formula for the [[entropy]] of a continuous distribution, known as '''differential entropy''':
: &lt;math&gt;h(X)=-\int p(x)\log p(x)\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;
Unlike Shannon's formula for the discrete entropy, however, this is not the result of any derivation (Shannon simply replaced the summation symbol in the discrete version with an integral) and it turns out to lack many of the properties that make the discrete entropy a useful measure of uncertainty.  In particular, it is not invariant under a [[change of variables]] and can even become negative. In addition, it is not even dimensionally correct. Since &lt;math&gt; P(x) &lt;/math&gt; would be dimensionless, &lt;math&gt; p(x) &lt;/math&gt; must have units of &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{dx} &lt;/math&gt;, which means that the argument to the logarithm is not dimensionless as required.

Jaynes (1963, 1968) argued that the formula for the continuous entropy should be derived by taking the limit of increasingly dense discrete distributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Edwin Thompson Jaynes|author=Jaynes, E. T.|url=http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/brandeis.pdf|year=1963|chapter=Information Theory and Statistical Mechanics|title=Statistical Physics|editor=K. Ford|publisher=Benjamin, New York|pages=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jaynes, E. T.|year=1968|title=Prior Probabilities|journal=IEEE Trans. on Systems Science and Cybernetics|volume=SSC-4|pages=227|url=http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/prior.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Suppose that we have a set of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; discrete points &lt;math&gt;\{x_i\}&lt;/math&gt;, such that in the limit &lt;math&gt;N \to \infty&lt;/math&gt; their density approaches a function &lt;math&gt;m(x)&lt;/math&gt; called the "invariant measure".  
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{N \to \infty}\frac{1}{N}\,(\mbox{number of points in }a&lt;x&lt;b)=\int_a^b m(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

Jaynes derived from this the following formula for the continuous entropy, which he argued should be taken as the correct formula:
: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} H_{N}(X) = \log(N) - \int p(x)\log\frac{p(x)}{m(x)}\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

Typically, when this is written, the term &lt;math&gt; \log(N) &lt;/math&gt; is omitted, as that would typically not be finite. So the actual common definition is

: &lt;math&gt; H(X)=- \int p(x)\log\frac{p(x)}{m(x)}\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

Where it is unclear whether or not the &lt;math&gt; \log(N) &lt;/math&gt; term should be omitted, one could write

: &lt;math&gt; H_{N}(X) \sim \log(N) + H(X) &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that in Jaynes' formula, &lt;math&gt; m(x) &lt;/math&gt; is a probability density. It is clear that for any finite &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; that &lt;math&gt; m(x) &lt;/math&gt; is simply a uniform density over the quantization of the continuous space that is used in the Riemann sum. In the limit, &lt;math&gt; m(x) &lt;/math&gt; is the continuous limiting density of points in the quantization used to represent the continuous variable &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose one had a number format that took on &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; possible values, distributed as per &lt;math&gt; m(x) &lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt; H_{N}(X)&lt;/math&gt; (if &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is large enough that the continuous approximation is valid) is the discrete entropy of the variable &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; in this encoding. This is equal to the average number of bits required to transmit this information, and is no more than &lt;math&gt;\log(N)&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt; H(X) &lt;/math&gt; may be thought of as the amount of information gained by knowing that the variable &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; follows the distribution &lt;math&gt; p(x) &lt;/math&gt;, and is not uniformly distributed over the possible quantized values, as would be the case if it followed &lt;math&gt; m(x) &lt;/math&gt;. It should come as no surprise that &lt;math&gt;H(X)&lt;/math&gt; is actually the (negative) [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]] from &lt;math&gt;m(x)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; p(x) &lt;/math&gt;, which is thought of as the information gained by learning that a variable previously thought to be distributed as &lt;math&gt; m(x) &lt;/math&gt; is actually distributed as &lt;math&gt; p(x) &lt;/math&gt;.

Jaynes' continuous entropy formula has the property of being invariant under a change of variables, provided that &lt;math&gt;m(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; are transformed in the same way. (This motivates the name "invariant measure" for ''m''.) This solves many of the difficulties that come from applying Shannon's continuous entropy formula. Jaynes himself dropped the &lt;math&gt; \log(N) &lt;/math&gt; term as it was not relevant to his work (maximum entropy distributions), and it is somewhat awkward to have an infinite term in the calculation. Unfortunately, this cannot be helped if the quantization is made arbitrarily fine, as would be the case in the continuous limit. Note that &lt;math&gt; H(X) &lt;/math&gt; as defined here (without the &lt;math&gt;\log(N)&lt;/math&gt; term) would always be non-positive, because a KL divergence would always be non-negative.

If it is the case that &lt;math&gt; m(x) &lt;/math&gt; is constant over some interval of size &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; p(x) &lt;/math&gt; is essentially zero outside that interval, then the limiting density of discrete points (LDDP) is closely related to the differential entropy &lt;math&gt;h(X)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; H_{N}(X) \approx \log(N) - \log(r) + h(X) &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19537">'''Mathematical finance''', also known as '''quantitative finance''', is a field of [[applied mathematics]], concerned with mathematical modeling of [[financial market]]s. Generally, mathematical finance will derive and extend the [[Mathematical model|mathematical]] or [[Numerical analysis|numerical]] models without necessarily establishing a link to financial theory, taking observed market prices as input. Mathematical consistency is required, not compatibility with economic theory. Thus, for example, while a [[financial economist]] might study the structural reasons why a company may have a certain [[share price]], a financial mathematician may take the share price as a given, and attempt to use [[stochastic calculus]] to obtain the corresponding value of [[Derivative (finance)|derivative]]s of the [[stock]] (''see: [[Valuation of options]]; [[Financial modeling#Quantitative finance|Financial modeling]]; [[Asset pricing]]''). The [[fundamental theorem of arbitrage-free pricing]] is one of the key theorems in mathematical finance, while the [[Black–Scholes]] equation and formula are amongst the key results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Tim|title=What is financial mathematics?|url=http://plus.maths.org/content/what-financial-mathematics|publisher=+Plus Magazine|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematical finance also overlaps heavily with the fields of [[computational finance]] and [[financial engineering]]. The latter focuses on applications and modeling, often by help of [[stochastic asset model]]s (''see: [[Quantitative analyst]]''), while the former focuses, in addition to analysis, on building tools of implementation for the models. In general, there exist two separate branches of finance that require advanced quantitative techniques: derivatives pricing on the one hand, and [[risk management|risk-]] and [[Investment management#Investment managers and portfolio structures|portfolio management]] on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quantitative Finance|url=http://finance.laws.com/quantitative-finance|publisher=About.com|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French mathematician [[Louis Bachelier]] is considered the author of the first scholarly work on mathematical finance, published in 1900. But mathematical finance emerged as a discipline in the 1970s, following the work of [[Fischer Black]], [[Myron Scholes]] and [[Robert C. Merton|Robert Merton]] on option pricing theory.

Today many universities offer degree and research programs in mathematical finance.

==History: Q versus P==
There are two separate branches of finance that require advanced quantitative techniques: derivatives pricing, and risk and portfolio management. One of the main differences is that they use different probabilities, namely the risk-neutral probability (or arbitrage-pricing probability), denoted by "Q", and the actual (or actuarial) probability, denoted by "P".

The goal of derivatives pricing is to determine the fair price of a given security in terms of more [[market liquidity|liquid securities]] whose price is determined by the law of [[supply and demand]]. The meaning of "fair" depends, of course, on whether one considers buying or selling the security. Examples of securities being priced are [[option (finance)|plain vanilla]] and [[exotic options]], [[convertible bonds]], etc.

Once a fair price has been determined, the sell-side trader can make a market on the security. Therefore, derivatives pricing is a complex "extrapolation" exercise to define the current market value of a security, which is then used by the sell-side community. 
Quantitative derivatives pricing was initiated by [[Louis Bachelier]] in ''The Theory of Speculation'' ("Théorie de la spéculation", published 1900), with the introduction of the most basic and most influential of processes, the [[Brownian motion]], and its applications to the pricing of options.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53289874|title=Stochastic calculus for finance|last=E.|first=Shreve, Steven|date=2004|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780387401003|location=New York|oclc=53289874}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/868286679|title=Introduction to Quantitative Finance.|last=Stephen.|first=Blyth,|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|year=|isbn=9780199666591|location=|pages=157|oclc=868286679}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brownian motion is derived using the [[Langevin equation]] and the discrete [[random walk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57743436|title=Quantitative finance for physicists : an introduction|last=B.|first=Schmidt, Anatoly|date=2005|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|isbn=9780080492209|location=San Diego, Calif.|oclc=57743436}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachelier modeled the [[time series]] of changes in the [[logarithm]] of stock prices as a [[random walk]] in which the short-term changes had a finite [[variance]]. This causes longer-term changes to follow a [[Gaussian distribution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bachelir|first=Louis|title=The Theory of Speculation|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5LLDy7-d3SKNGI0M2E0NGItYzFlMS00NGU2LWE2ZDAtODc3MDY3MzdiNmY0/edit?hl=en_GB&amp;pli=1|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory remained dormant until [[Fischer Black]] and [[Myron Scholes]], along with fundamental contributions by [[Robert C. Merton]], applied the second most influential process, the [[geometric Brownian motion]], to [[option pricing]]. For this M. Scholes and R. Merton were awarded the 1997 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]]. Black was ineligible for the prize because of his death in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindbeck|first=Assar|title=The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1969-2007|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/themes/economic-sciences/lindbeck/index.html|publisher=Nobel Prize|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next important step was the [[fundamental theorem of asset pricing]] by Harrison and Pliska (1981), according to which the suitably normalized current price ''P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' of a security is arbitrage-free, and thus truly fair, only if there exists a [[stochastic process]] ''P&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' with constant [[expected value]] which describes its future evolution:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Angus|title=A risky business: How to price derivatives|url=http://plus.maths.org/content/risky-business-how-price-derivatives|accessdate=28 March 2014|newspaper=Price+ Magazine|date=1 Dec 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;P_{0} = \mathbf{E}_{0} (P_{t}) &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}} }}
A process satisfying ({{EquationNote|1}}) is called a "martingale". A martingale does not reward risk. Thus the probability of the normalized security price process is called "risk-neutral" and is typically denoted by the [[Blackboard bold|blackboard font]] letter "&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;".

The relationship ({{EquationNote|1}}) must hold for all times t: therefore the processes used for derivatives pricing are naturally set in continuous time.

The [[Quantitative analyst|quants]] who operate in the Q world of derivatives pricing are specialists with deep knowledge of the specific products they model.

Securities are priced individually, and thus the problems in the Q world are low-dimensional in nature.
Calibration is one of the main challenges of the Q world: once a continuous-time parametric process has been calibrated to a set of traded securities through a relationship such as (1), a similar relationship is used to define the price of new derivatives.

The main quantitative tools necessary to handle continuous-time Q-processes are [[Itō calculus|Itō’s stochastic calculus]], [[Monte Carlo methods in finance|simulation]] and [[partial differential equations]] (PDE’s).

Risk and portfolio management aims at modeling the statistically derived probability distribution of the market prices of all the securities at a given future investment horizon. &lt;br /&gt;
This "real" probability distribution of the market prices is typically denoted by the blackboard font letter "&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}&lt;/math&gt;", as opposed to the "risk-neutral" probability "&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;" used in derivatives pricing. Based on the P distribution, the buy-side community takes decisions on which securities to purchase in order to improve the prospective profit-and-loss profile of their positions considered as a portfolio.

For their pioneering work, Markowitz and Sharpe, along with Merton Miller, shared the 1990 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], for the first time ever awarded for a work in finance.

The portfolio-selection work of Markowitz and Sharpe introduced mathematics to [[investment management]]. With time, the mathematics has become more sophisticated. Thanks to Robert Merton and Paul Samuelson, one-period models were replaced by continuous time, [[Brownian Model of Financial Markets|Brownian-motion models]], and the quadratic utility function implicit in mean–variance optimization was replaced by more general increasing, concave utility functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karatzas|first1=Ioannis|last2=Shreve|first2=Steve|title=Methods of Mathematical Finance|location=Secaucus, NJ, USA|publisher=Springer-Verlag New York, Incorporated|year=1998|isbn=9780387948393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in more recent years the focus shifted toward estimation risk, i.e., the dangers of incorrectly assuming that advanced time series analysis alone can provide completely accurate estimates of the market parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meucci|first1=Attilio|title=Risk and Asset Allocation|publisher=Springer|year=2005|isbn=9783642009648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much effort has gone into the study of financial markets and how prices vary with time. [[Charles Dow]], one of the founders of [[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] and [[The Wall Street Journal]], enunciated a set of ideas on the subject which are now called [[Dow Theory]]. This is the basis of the so-called [[technical analysis]] method of attempting to predict future changes. One of the tenets of "technical analysis" is that [[market trends]] give an indication of the future, at least in the short term. The claims of the technical analysts are disputed by many academics.

Over the years, increasingly sophisticated mathematical models and derivative pricing strategies have been developed, but their credibility was damaged by the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]].
Contemporary practice of mathematical finance has been subjected to criticism from figures within the field notably by [[Paul Wilmott]], and by [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]], in his book [[The Black Swan (Taleb book)|''The Black Swan'']].&lt;ref name="Black Swan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taleb|first1=Nassim Nicholas|authorlink=Nassim Nicholas Taleb|year=2007|title=The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable|publisher=Random House Trade|isbn=978-1-4000-6351-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taleb claims that the prices of financial assets cannot be characterized by the simple models currently in use, rendering much of current practice at best irrelevant, and, at worst, dangerously misleading. Wilmott and [[Emanuel Derman]] published the ''[[Financial Modelers' Manifesto]]'' in January 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilmott.com/blogs/paul/index.cfm/2009/1/8/Financial-Modelers-Manifesto|publisher=Paul Wilmott's Blog|title=Financial Modelers' Manifesto|date=January 8, 2009|accessdate=June 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which addresses some of the most serious concerns.
Bodies such as the [[Institute for New Economic Thinking]] are now attempting to develop new theories and methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cfb9c43a-48b7-11df-8af4-00144feab49a.html |title=Mathematicians must get out of their ivory towers |author=Gillian Tett |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |date=April 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, modeling the changes by distributions with finite variance is, increasingly, said to be inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Svetlozar T. Rachev|author2=[[Frank J. Fabozzi]]|author3=Christian Menn|year=2005|title=Fat-Tailed and Skewed Asset Return Distributions: Implications for Risk Management, Portfolio Selection, and Option Pricing |publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]] |isbn=978-0471718864 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s it was discovered by [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] that changes in prices do not follow a [[Gaussian distribution]], but are rather modeled better by Lévy alpha-[[stable distribution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benoit Mandelbrot|B. Mandelbrot]], [http://web.williams.edu/Mathematics/sjmiller/public_html/341Fa09/econ/Mandelbroit_VariationCertainSpeculativePrices.pdf "The variation of certain Speculative Prices"], ''The Journal of Business'' 1963&lt;/ref&gt; The scale of change, or volatility, depends on the length of the time interval to a [[power law|power]] a bit more than 1/2. Large changes up or down are more likely than what one would calculate using a Gaussian distribution with an estimated [[standard deviation]]. But the problem is that it does not solve the problem as it makes parametrization much harder and risk control less reliable.&lt;ref name="Black Swan" /&gt; See also [[Variance gamma process #Option pricing]].

'''Mulgara''' is a [[triplestore]] and [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of the original Kowari project. It is [[Open Source]], scalable, and transaction-safe.&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;[http://docs.mulgara.org/overview/faq.html Mulgara | Semantic Store - Frequently Asked Questions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Mulgara instances can be queried via the [[iTQL]] [[query language]] and the [[SPARQL]] query language.&lt;ref name="Welcome to the new Mulgara project!"&gt;[http://mulgara.org/ Welcome to the new Mulgara project!]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Kowari was first made available for download in beta form on October 26, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2003Oct/0173.html Kowari Developer Beta Release]&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/2004/04/13-swdd/TucanaWWW2004DevDay.ppt '''Massive Scalability for RDF Storage and Analysis''', David Wood, Tom Adams, Andrew Newman]&lt;/ref&gt; Tucana Technologies Inc demonstrated the Tucana Knowledge Server (TKS), a proprietary RDF database relying on Kowari as the basis. A steady number of releases occurred throughout 2004, including [http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2004Oct/0066.html version 1.0.5] and [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=89874&amp;package_id=94357&amp;release_id=291698 1.1 pre-release]. The development of TKS stalled due to difficulties with funding at the end of 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebiquity.umbc.edu/blogger/2004/12/29/changes-at-tucana-technologies/ Changes at Tucana Technologies]&lt;/ref&gt; while the development of Kowari continued on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=kowari-developers Kowari Developers Archive]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005, Tucana was bought by [[Northrop Grumman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irconnect.com/noc/press/pages/news_releases.html?d=86459 Northrop Grumman Acquires Proprietary Software from Tucana Technologies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2006, Northrop Grumman threatened a Kowari developer with legal action if he released any new version of Kowari.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_name=6CF735F1-043E-4626-8115-B6D46FC7F183%40internode.on.net Kowari-developers '''In hope of resolution.''']&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, Kowari was [[Fork (software development)|forked]] in July 2006. It was renamed to Mulgara as Northrop Grumman owned the Kowari trademark. All development on Kowari has stopped&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/projects/kowari/ SourceForge.net: Kowari&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the community moved to Mulgara.   The legal cloud surrounding Kowari was eventually resolved,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topazproject.org/trac/ticket/26 Kowari Legal Status] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707065614/http://www.topazproject.org/trac/ticket/26 |date=2010-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the outcomes was the adoption of the [[Open Software License]] [http://www.opensource.org/licenses/osl-3.0.php3.0 3.0]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}. Since 2008 all new code is being licensed with the [[Apache License|Apache 2.0 License]].&lt;ref name="Welcome to the new Mulgara project!"/&gt;

Since 2006 Mulgara 1.0.0 has been released, significant changes to the transaction architecture was made to support [[Java Transaction API|JTA]], [[SPARQL]] support, a [[Jena (framework)|Jena]] API, and integration with [[Sesame (framework)|Sesame]] has been added.  As of January 10, 2012 the latest version is 2.1.13.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mulgara.org/news.html Mulgara News]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internals==
Mulgara is not based on a relational database due to the large numbers of table joins encountered by relational systems when dealing with metadata. Instead, Mulgara is a completely new database optimized for metadata management. Mulgara models hold metadata in the form of short subject-predicate-object statements, much like the [[W3C]]'s [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF) standard. Metadata may be imported into or exported from Mulgara in RDF or [[Notation 3]] form.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt;

&lt;!-- [[File:EulerCircle3.gif|thumb|You can change the vertices of the triangle, and Euler's circle persists.]] --&gt;
[[File:EulerCircle4.gif|thumb|Even if the orthocenter and circumcenter fall outside of the triangle, the construction still works.]]

In [[geometry]], the '''nine-point circle''' is a [[circle]] that can be constructed for any given [[triangle]]. It is so named because it passes through nine significant [[concyclic points]] defined from the triangle. These nine [[point (geometry)|points]] are:

* The [[midpoint]] of each side of the triangle
* The [[Perpendicular|foot]] of each [[altitude (triangle)|altitude]]
* The midpoint of the [[line segment]] from each [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]] of the triangle to the [[orthocenter]] (where the three altitudes meet; these line segments lie on their respective altitudes).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Altshiller-Court|1925|pp=103–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kay|1969|pp=18,245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nine-point circle is also known as  '''Feuerbach's circle''', '''Euler's circle''',  [[Olry Terquem|'''Terquem's''']] '''circle''', the '''six-points circle''', the '''twelve-points circle''', the '''''n''-point circle''', the '''medioscribed circle''', the '''mid circle''' or the '''circum-midcircle'''. Its center is the [[nine-point center]] of the triangle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kocik, Jerzy|author2=Solecki, Andrzej|title=Disentangling a Triangle|journal=Amer. Math.

Ford Award]]) give a proof of the Nine-Point Circle Theorem.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Casey, John|authorlink=John Casey (mathematician)|title=''Nine-Point Circle Theorem, in'' A Sequel to the First Six Books of Euclid|page=58|year=1886|edition=4th|location=London|publisher=Longmans, Green, &amp; Co|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hn6mqv;view=1up;seq=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significant nine points ==

[[File:Nine-point circle.svg]]

The diagram above shows the nine significant points of the nine-point circle. Points ''D'', ''E'', and ''F'' are the midpoints of the three sides of the triangle. Points ''G'', ''H'', and ''I'' are the feet of the altitudes of the triangle. Points ''J'', ''K'', and ''L'' are the midpoints of the line segments between each altitude's [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]] intersection (points ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'') and the triangle's orthocenter (point ''S'').

For an [[acute triangle]], six of the points (the midpoints and altitude feet) lie on the triangle itself; for an [[obtuse triangle]] two of the altitudes have feet outside the triangle, but these feet still belong to the nine-point circle.

==Discovery==

Although he is credited for its discovery, [[Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach]] did not entirely discover the nine-point circle, but rather the six point circle, recognizing the significance of the midpoints of the three sides of the triangle and the feet of the altitudes of that triangle. (''See Fig. 1, points'' D, E, F, G, H, ''and'' I.)  (At a slightly earlier date, [[Charles Brianchon]] and [[Jean-Victor Poncelet]] had stated and proven the same theorem.) But soon after Feuerbach, mathematician [[Olry Terquem]] himself proved the existence of the circle.  He was the first to recognize the added significance of the three midpoints between the triangle's vertices and the orthocenter. (''See Fig. 1, points'' J, K, ''and'' L.)  Thus, Terquem was the first to use the name nine-point circle.

==Tangent circles==
[[File:Circ9pnt3.svg|right|thumb|250px|The nine-point circle is tangent to the incircle and excircles]]
In 1822 Karl Feuerbach discovered that any triangle's nine-point circle is externally [[Tangent circles|tangent]] to that triangle's three [[excircle]]s and internally tangent to its [[incircle]]; this result is known as [[Feuerbach's theorem]].  He proved that:
:''... the circle which passes through the feet of the altitudes of a triangle is tangent to all four circles which in turn are tangent to the three sides of the triangle...'' {{harv|Feuerbach|1822}}

The [[triangle center]] at which the incircle and the nine-point circle touch is called the [[Feuerbach point]].

==Other properties of the nine-point circle==

* The radius of a triangle's [[circumscribed circle|circumcircle]] is twice the radius of that triangle's nine-point circle.&lt;ref name=PL/&gt;{{rp|p.153}}
[[File:9pcircle03.svg]]
''Figure 3''

* A nine-point circle bisects a line segment going from the corresponding triangle's orthocenter to any point on its circumcircle.
[[File:9pcircle 04.png]]
''Figure 4''

* The center ''N'' of the nine-point circle bisects a segment from the orthocenter ''H'' to the [[circumscribed circle|circumcenter]] ''O'' (making the orthocenter a center of [[homothetic center|dilation]] to both circles):&lt;ref name=PL&gt;Posamentier, Alfred S., and Lehmann, Ingmar. ''The Secrets of Triangles'', Prometheus Books, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.152}}

::''ON'' = ''NH''.

* The nine-point center ''N'' is one-fourth of the way along the [[Euler line]] from the centroid ''G'' to the orthocenter ''H'':&lt;ref name=PL/&gt;{{rp|p.153}}

::''HN'' = 3''NG''.

* The nine-point circle of a reference triangle is the circumcircle of both the reference triangle's [[medial triangle]] (with vertices at the midpoints of the sides of the reference triangle) and its [[orthic triangle]] (with vertices at the feet of the reference triangle's altitudes).&lt;ref name=PL/&gt;{{rp|p.153}}
* The center of all [[rectangular hyperbola]]s that pass through the vertices of a triangle lies on its nine-point circle. Examples include the well-known rectangular hyperbolas of Keipert, [[Václav Jeřábek|Jeřábek]] and Feuerbach. This fact is known as the Feuerbach conic theorem.

[[File:Tangent circles in Feuerbach's theorem.jpg|thumb|The nine point circle and the 16 tangent circles of the orthocentric system]]

* If an [[orthocentric system]] of four points ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' and ''H'' is given, then the four triangles formed by any combination of three distinct points of that system all share the same nine-point circle. This is a consequence of symmetry: the ''sides'' of one triangle adjacent to a vertex that is an orthocenter to another triangle are ''segments'' from that second triangle. A third midpoint lies on their common side. (The same 'midpoints' defining separate nine-point circles, those circles must be concurrent.)
* Consequently, these four triangles have circumcircles with identical radii. Let ''N'' represent the common nine-point center and ''P'' be an arbitrary point in the plane of the orthocentric system. Then

::''NA''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''NB''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''NC''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''NH''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''3R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

:where ''R'' is the common [[circumradius]]; and if

::''PA''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''PB''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''PC''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''PH''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''K''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,

:where ''K'' is kept constant, then the locus of ''P'' is a circle centered at ''N'' with a radius &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{K^2-3R^2}&lt;/math&gt;. As ''P'' approaches ''N'' the locus of ''P'' for the corresponding constant ''K'', collapses onto ''N'' the nine-point center. Furthermore the nine-point circle is the locus of ''P'' such that

::''PA''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''PB''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''PC''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''PH''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''4R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

* The centers of the incircle and excircles of a triangle form an orthocentric system. The nine-point circle created for that orthocentric system is the circumcircle of the original triangle. The feet of the altitudes in the orthocentric system are the vertices of the original triangle.
* If four arbitrary points ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'' are given that do not form an orthocentric system, then the nine-point circles of ''ABC'', ''BCD'', ''CDA'' and ''DAB'' concur at a point. The remaining six intersection points of these nine-point circles each concur with the midpoints of the four triangles. Remarkably, there exists a unique nine-point conic, centered at the centroid of these four arbitrary points, that passes through all seven points of intersection of these nine-point circles. Furthermore because of the Feuerbach conic theorem mentioned above, there exists a unique rectangular [[circumconic]], centered at the common intersection point of the four nine-point circles, that passes through the four original arbitrary points as well as the orthocenters of the four triangles.
* If four points ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'' are given that form a [[cyclic quadrilateral]], then the nine-point circles of ''ABC'', ''BCD'', ''CDA'' and ''DAB'' concur at the [[Cyclic quadrilateral#Anticenter and collinearities|anticenter]] of the cyclic quadrilateral. The nine-point circles are all congruent with a radius of half that of the cyclic quadrilateral's circumcircle. The nine-point circles form a set of four [[Johnson circles]]. Consequently the four nine-point centers are cyclic and lie on a circle congruent to the four nine-point circles that is centered at the anticenter of the cyclic quadrilateral. Furthermore the cyclic quadrilateral formed from the four nine-pont centers is [[Homothetic transformation|homothetic]] to the reference cyclic quadrilateral ''ABCD'' by a factor of &amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;  and its homothetic center ''(N)'' lies on the line connecting the circumcenter ''(O)'' to the anticenter ''(M)'' where

::''ON'' = ''2NM''.

* The [[orthopole]] of lines passing through the circumcenter lie on the nine-point circle.
* A triangle's circumcircle, its nine-point circle, its [[polar circle (geometry)|polar circle]], and the circumcircle of its [[tangential triangle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Altshiller-Court|1925|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; are [[coaxal circles|coaxal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Altshiller-Court|1925|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Trilinear coordinates]] for the center of the [[Kiepert hyperbola]] are

::(''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''a'' : (''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''b'' : (''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''c''

* Trilinear coordinates for the center of the Jeřábek hyperbola are

::cos ''A'' sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''B''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''C'') : cos ''B'' sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''C''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''A'') : cos ''C'' sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''A''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''B'')

*  Letting ''x'' : ''y'' : ''z'' be a variable point in trilinear coordinates, an equation for the nine-point circle is

:: ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;sin&amp;nbsp;''2A'' + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;sin&amp;nbsp;2''B'' + ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;sin&amp;nbsp;2''C''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2(''y''z sin&amp;nbsp;''A'' + ''zx'' sin&amp;nbsp;''B'' + ''xy'' sin&amp;nbsp;''C'') = 0.

==Generalization==
{{Main|Nine-point conic}}
The circle is an instance of a [[conic section]] and the nine-point circle is an instance of the general nine-point conic that has been constructed with relation to a triangle ''ABC'' and a fourth point ''P'', where the particular nine-point circle instance arises when ''P'' is the orthocenter of ''ABC''. The vertices of the triangle and ''P'' determine a [[complete quadrilateral]] and three "diagonal points" where opposite sides of the quadrilateral intersect. There are six "sidelines" in the quadrilateral; the nine-point conic intersects the midpoints of these and also includes the diagonal points. The conic is an [[ellipse]] when ''P'' is interior to ''ABC'' or in a region sharing [[vertical angles]] with the triangle, but a [[nine-point hyperbola]] occurs when ''P'' is in one of the three adjacent regions, and the hyperbola is rectangular when P lies on the circumcircle of ''ABC''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3332">In [[computational complexity theory]], a '''PTAS reduction''' is an [[approximation-preserving reduction]] that is often used to perform [[Reduction (complexity)|reductions]] between solutions to [[optimization problem]]s. It preserves the property that a problem has a [[polynomial time approximation scheme]] (PTAS) and is used to define [[complete (complexity)|completeness]] for certain classes of optimization problems such as [[APX]]. Notationally, if there is a PTAS reduction from a problem A to a problem B, we write &lt;math&gt;\text{A} \leq_{\text{PTAS}} \text{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

With ordinary [[polynomial-time many-one reduction]]s, if we can describe a [[reduction (complexity)|reduction]] from a problem A to a problem B, then any polynomial-time solution for B can be composed with that reduction to obtain a polynomial-time solution for the problem A. Similarly, our goal in defining PTAS reductions is so that given a PTAS reduction from an optimization problem A to a problem B, a PTAS for B can be composed with the reduction to obtain a PTAS for the problem A.

Formally, we define a PTAS reduction from A to B using three polynomial-time computable functions, ''f'', ''g'', and ''&amp;alpha;'', with the following properties:

* ''f'' maps instances of problem A to instances of problem B.
* ''g'' takes an instance ''x'' of problem A, an approximate solution to the corresponding problem &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; in B, and an error parameter &amp;epsilon; and produces an approximate solution to ''x''.
* ''&amp;alpha;'' maps error parameters for solutions to instances of problem A to error parameters for solutions to problem B.
* If the solution ''y'' to &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; (an instance of problem B) is at most &lt;math&gt;1 + \alpha(\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; times worse than the optimal solution, then the corresponding solution &lt;math&gt;g(x,y,\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; to ''x'' (an instance of problem A) is at most &lt;math&gt;1 + \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; times worse than the optimal solution.

==Properties==

From the definition it is straightforward to show that:
* &lt;math&gt;\text{A} \leq_{\text{PTAS}} \text{B}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\text{B} \in \text{PTAS} \implies \text{A} \in \text{PTAS}&lt;/math&gt;

A '''physical symbol system''' (also called a [[formal system]]) takes physical patterns (symbols), combining them into structures (expressions) and manipulating them (using processes) to produce new expressions.

The '''physical symbol system hypothesis''' ('''PSSH''') is a position in the [[philosophy of artificial intelligence]] formulated by [[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]]. They wrote:
{{Quotation|"A physical symbol system has the [[sufficient|necessary and sufficient means]] for general intelligent action."&lt;ref name=NS&gt;{{Harvnb|Newell|Simon|1976|p=116}} and {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]]}}
This claim implies both that human thinking is a kind of symbol manipulation (because a symbol system is necessary for intelligence) and that machines can be intelligent (because a symbol system is [[sufficient]] for intelligence).&lt;ref name="Nilsson 2007 p=1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nilsson|2007|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea has philosophical roots in [[Hobbes]] (who claimed reasoning was "nothing more than reckoning"), [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] (who attempted to create a logical calculus of all human ideas),  [[David Hume|Hume]] (who thought perception could be reduced to "atomic impressions") and even [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] (who analyzed all experience as controlled by formal rules).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1979|p=156}}, {{Harvnb|Haugeland|pp=15&amp;ndash;44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest version is called the [[computational theory of mind]], associated with philosophers [[Hilary Putnam]] and [[Jerry Fodor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Horst|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis has been criticized strongly by various parties, but is a core part of AI research. A common critical view is that the hypothesis seems appropriate for higher-level intelligence such as playing chess, but less appropriate for commonplace intelligence such as vision. A distinction is usually made between the kind of high level symbols that directly correspond with objects in the world, such as &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;dog&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;tail&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and the more complex "symbols" that are present in a machine like a [[neural network]].

== Examples ==
Examples of physical symbol systems include:
* [[Formal logic]]: the symbols are words like "and", "or", "not", "for all x" and so on. The expressions are statements in formal logic which can be true or false.  The processes are the rules of logical deduction.
* [[Elementary algebra|Algebra]]: the symbols are "+", "×", "''x''", "''y''", "1", "2", "3", etc. The expressions are equations. The processes are the rules of algebra, that allow one to manipulate a mathematical expression and retain its truth.
* A [[digital computer]]: the symbols are zeros and ones of computer memory, the processes are the operations of the [[CPU]] that change memory.
* [[Chess]]: the symbols are the pieces, the processes are the legal chess moves, the expressions are the positions of all the pieces on the board.

The physical symbol system hypothesis claims that both of these are also examples of physical symbol systems:
* Intelligent human thought: the symbols are encoded in our brains. The expressions are [[thought]]s. The processes are the mental operations of thinking.
* A running [[artificial intelligence]] program: the symbols are data. The expressions are more data. The processes are programs that manipulate the data.

== Arguments in favor of the physical symbol system hypothesis ==
=== Newell and Simon ===
Two lines of evidence suggested to [[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]] that "symbol manipulation" was the essence of both human and machine intelligence: the development of [[artificial intelligence]] programs and psychological experiments on human beings.

First, in the early decades of AI research there were a number of very successful programs that used high level symbol processing, such as [[Allen Newell|Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]]'s [[General Problem Solver]] or [[Terry Winograd]]'s [[SHRDLU]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1979|pp=130&amp;ndash;148}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Haugeland]] named this kind of AI research "Good Old Fashioned AI" or [[GOFAI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haugeland|1985|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Expert system]]s and [[logic programming]] are descendants of this tradition. The success of these programs suggested that symbol processing systems could simulate any intelligent action.

And second, [[Psychology|psychological]] experiments carried out at the same time found that, for difficult problems in logic, planning or any kind of "puzzle solving", people used this kind of symbol processing as well. AI researchers were able to simulate the step by step problem solving skills of people with computer programs. This collaboration and the issues it raised eventually would lead to the creation of the field of [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1979|pp=91&amp;ndash;129, 170&amp;ndash;174}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This type of research was called "[[cognitive simulation]]".) This line of research suggested that human problem solving consisted primarily of the manipulation of high level symbols.

=== Symbols vs. signals ===
In Newell and Simon's arguments, the "symbols" that the hypothesis is referring to are physical objects that represent things in the world, symbols such as &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;dog&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; that have a recognizable [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] or [[denotation]] and can be [[compositionality|composed]] with other symbols to create more complex symbols.

However, it is also possible to interpret the hypothesis as referring to the simple abstract 0s and 1s in the memory of a digital computer or the stream of 0s and 1s passing through the perceptual apparatus of a robot.  These are, in some sense, symbols as well, although it is not always possible to determine exactly what the symbols are standing for. In this version of the hypothesis, no distinction is being made between "symbols" and "signals", as [[David Touretzky]] and [[Dean Pomerleau]] explain.&lt;ref name=TouretzkyPomerleau1994&gt;
Reconstructing Physical Symbol Systems
David S. Touretzky and Dean A. Pomerleau

Carnegie Mellon University
Cognitive Science 18(2):345&amp;ndash;353, 1994.
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/pubs/simon-reply-www.ps.gz
&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this interpretation, the physical symbol system hypothesis asserts merely that intelligence can be ''digitized''. This is a weaker claim. Indeed, [[David Touretzky|Touretzky]] and [[Dean Pomerleau|Pomerleau]] write that if symbols and signals are the same thing, then  "[s]ufficiency is a given, unless one is a dualist or some other sort of mystic, because physical symbol systems are [[Turing completeness|Turing-universal]]."&lt;ref name=TouretzkyPomerleau1994/&gt; The widely accepted [[Church&amp;ndash;Turing thesis]] holds that any [[Turing completeness|Turing-universal]] system can simulate any conceivable process that can be digitized, given enough time and memory. Since any digital computer is [[Turing completeness|Turing-universal]], any digital computer can, in theory, simulate anything that can be digitized to a sufficient level of precision, including the behavior of intelligent organisms. The necessary condition of the physical symbol systems hypothesis can likewise be finessed, since we are willing to accept almost any signal as a form of "symbol" and all intelligent biological systems have signal pathways.

== Criticism ==

[[Nils Nilsson (researcher)|Nils Nilsson]] has identified four main "themes" or grounds in which the physical symbol system hypothesis has been attacked.&lt;ref name="Nilsson 2007 p=1"/&gt;
#The "erroneous claim that the [physical symbol system hypothesis] lacks [[symbol grounding]]" which is presumed to be a requirement for general intelligent action.
#The common belief that AI requires non-symbolic processing (that which can be supplied by a connectionist architecture for instance).
#The common statement that the brain is simply not a computer and that "computation as it is currently understood, does not provide an appropriate model for intelligence".
#And last of all that it is also believed in by some that the brain is essentially mindless, most of what takes place are chemical reactions and that human intelligent behaviour is analogous to the intelligent behaviour displayed for example by ant colonies.

=== Dreyfus and the primacy of unconscious skills ===
{{Main|Dreyfus' critique of artificial intelligence}}

[[Hubert Dreyfus]] attacked the necessary condition of the physical symbol system hypothesis, calling it "the psychological assumption" and defining it thus:
* ''The mind can be viewed as a device operating on bits of information according to formal rules.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1979|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dreyfus refuted this by showing that human intelligence and expertise depended primarily on unconscious instincts rather than conscious symbolic manipulation. Experts solve problems quickly by using their intuitions, rather than step-by-step trial and error searches. Dreyfus argued that these unconscious skills would never be captured in formal rules.&lt;ref name=D&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1972}}, {{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1979}}, {{Harvnb|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|1986}}. See also {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=950&amp;ndash;952}}, {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|120&amp;ndash;132}} and {{Harvnb|Hearn|2007|pp=50&amp;ndash;51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Searle and his Chinese room ===
{{Main|Chinese room}}

[[John Searle]]'s [[Chinese room]] argument, presented in 1980, attempted to show that a program (or any physical symbol system) could not be said to "understand" the symbols that it uses; that the symbols themselves have no meaning or semantic content, and so the machine can never be truly intelligent from symbol manipulation alone. &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980}}, {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=269&amp;ndash;271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brooks and the roboticists ===
{{Main|Artificial intelligence, situated approach|Moravec's paradox}}
In the sixties and seventies, several laboratories attempted to build [[robot]]s that used symbols to represent the world and plan actions (such as the [[Stanford Cart]]). These projects had limited success. In the middle eighties, [[Rodney Brooks]] of [[MIT]] was able to build robots that had superior ability to move and survive without the use of symbolic reasoning at all. Brooks (and others, such as [[Hans Moravec]]) discovered that our most basic skills of motion, survival, perception, balance and so on did not seem to require high level symbols at all, that in fact, the use of high level symbols was more complicated and less successful.

In a 1990 paper [http://people.csail.mit.edu/brooks/papers/elephants.pdf Elephants Don't Play Chess], robotics researcher [[Rodney Brooks]] took direct aim at the physical symbol system hypothesis, arguing that symbols are not always necessary since "the world is its own best model. It is always exactly up to date. It always has every detail there is to be known. The trick is to sense it appropriately and often enough."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks 1990|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Connectionism ===
{{Main|Connectionism}}

=== Embodied philosophy ===
{{Main|Embodied philosophy}}

[[George Lakoff]], [[Mark Turner (cognitive scientist)|Mark Turner]] and others have argued that our abstract skills in areas such as [[mathematic]]s, [[ethic]]s and [[philosophy]] depend on unconscious skills that derive from the body, and that conscious symbol manipulation is only a small part of our intelligence.

[[File:Latécoère 28.svg|thumb|320px|Three view plan of [[Latécoère 28]] for presentation purpose.]]
'''Plans''' are a set of  [[technical drawing|drawings]] or two-dimensional [[diagram]]s used to describe a [[Location (geography)|place]] or [[Object (philosophy)|object]], or to communicate [[building]] or [[Manufacturing|fabrication]] instructions. Usually plans are drawn or printed on paper, but they can take the form of a digital file.

These plans are used in a range of fields from [[architecture]], [[urban planning]], [[landscape architecture]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[civil engineering]], [[industrial engineering]] to [[systems engineering]].

== Overview ==
Plans are often for [[Technology|technical]] purposes such as [[architecture]], [[engineering]], or [[urban planning|planning]]. Their purpose in these disciplines is to accurately and unambiguously capture all the geometric features of a site, building, product or component. Plans can also be for presentation or orientation purposes, and as such are often less detailed versions of the former. The end goal of plans is either to portray an existing place or object, or to convey enough information to allow a builder or manufacturer to realize a design.

The term "plan" may casually be used to refer to a single view, sheet, or drawing in a set of plans. More specifically a [[plan view]] is an [[orthographic projection]] looking down on the object, such as in a [[floor plan]].

The process of producing plans, and the skill of producing them, is often referred to as [[technical drawing]]. A working drawing is a type of technical drawing, which is part of the documentation needed to build an [[engineering]] product or [[architecture]]. Typically in architecture these could include [[civil drawing]]s, [[architectural drawing]]s, [[structural drawing]]s, [[mechanical drawing]]s, [[electrical drawing]]s, and [[plumbing drawing]]s. In engineering, these drawings show all necessary data to [[manufacture]] a given object, such as [[dimension]]s and [[angle]]s.

== Plan features ==

=== Format ===
Plans are often prepared in a "set". The set includes all the information required for the purpose of the set, and may exclude views or projections which are unnecessary. A set of plans can be on standard office-sized paper or on large sheets. It can be stapled, folded or rolled as required. A set of plans can also take the form of a digital file in a proprietary format such as [[DWG]] or an exchange file format such as [[DXF]] or [[PDF]].

Plans are often referred to as "[[blueprint]]s" or "[[whiteprint|bluelines]]". However, the terms are rapidly becoming an [[anachronism]], since these copying methods have mostly been superseded by reproduction processes that yield black or multicolour lines on white paper, or by electronic representations of information.

=== Scale ===
{{Main|Architect's scale|Engineer's scale|Metric scale}}
Plans are usually "scale drawings", meaning that the plans are drawn at a specific [[ratio]] relative to the actual size of the place or object. Various scales may be used for different drawings in a set. For example, a floor plan may be drawn at 1:48 (or 1/4"=1'-0") whereas a detailed view may be drawn at 1:24 (or 1/2"=1'-0"). Site plans are often drawn at 1" = 20' (1:240) or 1" = 30' (1:360).

In the [[metric system]] the ratios commonly are 1:5, 1:10, 1:20, 1:50, 1:100, 1:200, 1:500, 1:1000, 1:2000 and 1:5000

=== Views and projections ===
[[Image:Convention placement vues dessin technique.svg|thumb|right|Symbols used to define whether a projection is either Third Angle (right) or First Angle (left).]]
[[File:Graphical projection comparison.png|thumb|right|Comparison of several types of [[graphical projection]].]]
Because plans represent three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional plane, the use of [[Graphical projection|views]] or [[Graphical projection|projections]] is crucial to the legibility of plans. Each projection is achieved by assuming a vantage point from which to see the place or object, and a type of projection. These projection types are:

*[[Parallel projection]]
**[[Orthographic projection]]
***[[Multiview projection]], including:
****Plan view or floor plan view
****Elevation, usually a side view of an exterior
****[[Cross section (geometry)|Section]], a view of the interior at a particular cutting plane
***[[Axonometric projection]], including:
****[[Isometric projection]]
****[[Dimetric projection]]
****[[Trimetric projection]]
**[[Oblique projection]], and
*[[Perspective projection]], including:
**One-point perspective
**Two-point perspective
**Three-point perspective

=== Planning approach ===
There is no universal standard for sheet order, however the following describes a common approach:

* General Information : The first sheets in a set may include notes, assembly descriptions, a rendering of the project, or simply the project title.
* Site : [[Site plan]]s, including a key plan, appear before other plans and on smaller projects may be on the first sheet. A project could require a [[landscape plan]], although this can be integrated with the site plan if the drawing remains clear.
* Specific plans : [[Floor plan]]s, starting with the lowest floor and ending with the roof plan usually appear near the beginning of the set. Further, for example, reflected Ceiling Plans (RCP)s showing ceiling layouts appear after the floor plans.
* [[Elevation (view)|Elevation]]s : Starting with the principal, or front elevation, all the building elevations appear after the plans. Smaller residential projects may display the elevations before the plans. Elevation details may appear on the same sheets as the building elevations.
* [[Cross section (geometry)|Section]]s: Building sections that describe views cut through the entire building appear next, followed by wall sections, then detail sections.
* Details: Details may appear on any of the previous sheets, or may be collected to appear on detail sheets. These details may include construction details that show how the components of the building fit together. These details may also include [[Millwork (building material)|millwork]] drawings or other interior details.
* Schedules: Many aspects of a building must be listed as schedules on larger projects. These include schedules for windows, doors, wall or floor finishes, hardware, landscaping elements, rooms, and areas.

Where additional systems are complex and require many details for installation, specialized additional plan drawings may be used, such as:
* [[Structural drawing|Structural]]: While smaller projects may only show structural information on the plans and sections, larger projects have separate sheets describing the structure of the building.
* [[Mechanical drawing|Mechanical]]: Mechanical drawings show plumbing, [[heating, ventilation and air conditioning]] systems, or fire protection systems.
* [[Electrical drawing|Electrical]] :Electrical plan drawings may include equipment and cable tray layout, lighting and power, [[ground (electrical)|grounding]], telephone, local area network, special communications or signal systems, or a reflected lighting plan.

'''Promise Theory''', in the context of [[information science]], is a model of voluntary cooperation between individual, [[autonomous agent|autonomous actors or agents]] who publish their intentions to one another in the form of promises. It is a form of labelled graph theory, describing discrete networks of agents joined by the unilateral promises they make.

A '''promise''' is a declaration of intent whose purpose is to increase the recipient's certainty about a claim of past, present or future behaviour.&lt;ref name="Burgess" &gt;[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F11568285_9 M. Burgess, An Approach to Understanding Policy Based on Autonomy and Voluntary Cooperation]&lt;/ref&gt; For a promise to increase certainty, the recipient needs to trust the promiser, but trust can also be built on the [[verification theory|verification]] (or '''assessment''') that previous promises have been kept, thus trust plays a symbiotic relationship with promises. Each agent assesses its belief in the promise's outcome or intent. Thus Promise Theory is about the [[wikt:relativity|relativity]] of autonomous agents.

One of the goals of Promise Theory is to offer a model that unifies the physical (or dynamical) description of an information system with its intended meaning, i.e. its [[semantics]]. This has been used to describe [[configuration management]] of resources in information systems, amongst other things.

== History ==

Promise Theory was proposed by [[Mark Burgess (computer scientist)|Mark Burgess]] in 2004, in the context of computer science, in order to solve problems present in obligation-based computer management schemes for [[policy-based management]].&lt;ref name="Burgess" /&gt; However its usefulness was quickly seen to go far beyond computing. The simple model of a promise used in Promise Theory (now called 'micro-promises') can easily address matters of Economics and Organization. Promise Theory has since been developed by Burgess in collaboration with Dutch computer scientist [[Jan Bergstra]], resulting in a book: Promise Theory: Principles and Applications.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Promise-Theory-Principles-Applications-Volume/dp/1495437779/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1391713533&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=promise+theory Promise Theory: Principles and Applications]&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2013.

Interest in promise theory has grown in the IT industry, with several products citing it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://markburgess.org/TIpromises.html Thinking in Promises, O'Reilly, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkworld.com/article/2449562/sdn/promise-theory-mark-burgess-cfengine-sdn-cisco-aci-apic-opflex.html Promise Theory: Can you really trust the network to keep promises?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://jmplank.wordpress.com/tag/promise-theory/ ACI Policy Model: Introduction to some of the fundamentals of an ACI Policy and how it’s enforced]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nojitter.com/post/240169790/why-you-need-to-know-about-promise-theory Why you need to know about promise theory]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vmiss.net/infrastructure/opflex-ing-your-cisco-application-centric-infrastructure/ OpFlex-ing Your Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2016/06/chef-just-took-big-step-quest-make-code-work-like-biology/ The Quest to Make Code Work Like Biology Just Took A Big Step (Wired 2016)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Autonomy ==

Obligations, rather than promises have been the traditional way of guiding behaviour.&lt;ref name="ArXiv 3294" &gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.3294 [0810.3294&amp;#93; A static theory of promises&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Promise Theory's point of departure from [[Deontological ethics|obligation logics]] is the idea that all agents in a system should have autonomy of control—i.e. that they cannot be coerced or forced into a specific behaviour. Obligation theories in computer science often view an obligation as a deterministic command that causes its proposed outcome. In Promise Theory an agent may only make promises about its own behaviour. For autonomous agents it is meaningless to make promises about another's behaviour.

Although this assumption could be interpreted morally or ethically, in Promise Theory this is simply a pragmatic `engineering' principle, which leads to a more complete documentation of the intended roles of the actors or agents within the whole. The reason for this is that, when one is not allowed to make assumptions about others' behaviour, one is forced to document every promise more completely in order to make predictions; thus it leads to a more complete documentation which in turn points out the possible failure modes by which cooperative behaviour could fail.

Command and control systems like those that motivate obligation theories can easily be reproduced by having agents voluntarily promise to follow the instructions of another agent (this is also viewed as a more realistic model of behaviour). Since a promise can always be withdrawn, there is no contradiction between voluntary cooperation and command and control.

In Philosophy and Law a promise is often viewed as something that leads to an obligation. Promise Theory rejects that point of view. Bergstra and Burgess have shown that the concept of a promise is quite independent of that of obligation and indeed is simpler.&lt;ref name="ArXiv 3294" /&gt;

The role of obligations in increasing certainty is unclear, since obligations can come from anywhere and an aggregation of non-local constraints cannot be resolved by a local agent: this means that obligations can actually increase uncertainty. In a world of promises, all constraints on an agent are self-imposed and local (even if they are suggested by outside agents), thus all contradictions can be resolved locally.

== Multi-agent systems and commitments ==

The theory of commitments in [[multi-agent system]]s has some similarities with aspects of promise theory, but there are key differences. In Promise Theory a commitment is a subset of intentions. Since a promise is a published intention, a commitment may or may not be a promise. A detailed comparison of Promises and Commitments in the senses intended in their respective fields is forthcoming, and not a trivial matter.

== Economics ==

Promises can be valuable to the promisee or even to the promiser. They might also lead to costs. There is thus an economic story to tell about promises. The economics of promises naturally motivate `selfish agent' behaviour and Promise Theory can be seen as a motivation for game theoretical decision making, in which multiple promises play the role of strategies in a game.&lt;ref&gt;http://project.iu.hio.no/papers/pcm.2.pdf{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of promises as applied to [[organization]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Laws of Human-Computer Behaviour and Collective Organization}} http://research.iu.hio.no/papers/organization.pdf{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; bears some resemblance to the theory of Institutional Diversity by [[Elinor Ostrom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Institutional Diversity |last=Ostrom |first=Elinor |year=2005 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |location= |isbn=0-691-12238-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several of the same themes and consideration appear; the main difference is that Ostrom focuses, like many authors, on the role of external rules and obligations. Promise Theory takes the opposite viewpoint that obeyance of rules is a voluntary act and hence it makes sense to focus on those voluntary promises. An attempt to force obeyance without a promise is considered to constitute an attack.
One benefit of a Promise Theory approach is that it does not require special structural elements (e.g. Ostrom's institutional "Positions") to describe different roles in a collaborate network—these may also be viewed as promises in Promise Theory; thus there is a parsimony that helps to avoid an explosion of concepts, and perhaps more importantly admits mathematical formalization. The algebra and calculus of promises allows simple reasoning in a mathematical framework.

== CFEngine ==

In spite of the generality of Promise Theory, it was originally proposed by Burgess as a way of modelling the computer management software [[CFEngine]] and its autonomous behaviour. Existing theories based on obligation were unsuitable. CFEngine uses a model of autonomy both as a way of avoiding distributed inconsistency in policy and as a security principle against external attack: no agent can be forced to receive information or instructions from another agent, thus all cooperation is voluntary. For many users of the software, this property has been instrumental in both keeping their systems safe and adapting to the local requirements.

== Emergent behaviour ==

In [[computer science]], the '''Promise theory''' describes policy governed services, in a framework of completely autonomous agents, which assist one another by voluntary cooperation alone. It is a framework for analyzing realistic models of modern networking, and as a formal model for [[swarm intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Burgess, S. Fagernes (2006), ''Promise theory - a model of autonomous objects for pervasive computing and swarms'', Oslo University College, {{ISBN|0-7695-2622-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Promise theory may be viewed as a logical and graph theoretical framework for understanding complex relationships in networks, where many constraints have to be met, which was developed at [[Oslo University College]], by drawing on ideas from several different lines of research conducted there, including policy based management, graph theory, logic and [[configuration management]]. It uses a constructivist approach that builds conventional management structures from graphs of interacting, autonomous agents. Promises can be asserted either from an agent to itself or from one agent to another and each promise implies a constraint on the behavior of the promising agent. The atomicity of the promises makes them a tool for finding contradictions and inconsistencies.

== Agency as a model of systems in space and time ==

The promises made by autonomous agents lead to a mutually approved [[graph (data structure)|graph]] structure, which in turn leads to spatial structures in which the agents represent point-like locations. This allows models of '''smart spaces''', i.e. semantically labeled or even functional spaces, such as databases, knowledge maps, warehouses, hotels, etc., to be unified with other more conventional descriptions of space and time. The model of [[semantic spacetime]] uses promise theory to discuss these spacetime concepts.

Promises are more mathematically primitive than graph adjacencies, since a link requires the mutual consent of two autonomous agents, thus the concept of a connected space requires more work to build structure. This makes them mathematically interesting as a notion of space, and offers a useful way of modeling physical and virtual information systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5563 M. Burgess, Spacetimes with Semantics]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1460">The '''promptuary''' was a [[calculating machine]] invented by the 16th-century Scottish mathematician [[John Napier]] and described in the second edition of his book ''[[Rabdology|Rabdologiae]]'' in which he also described [[Napier's bones]].

It is an extension of Napier's Bones, using two sets of rods to achieve multi-digit multiplication.  The rods for the multiplicand are similar to Napier's Bones, with repetitions of the values.  The set of rods for the multiplier are shutters or masks for each digit placed over the multiplicand rods.  The results are then tallied from the digits showing as with other [[lattice multiplication]] methods.
 
The final form described by Napier took advantage of symmetries to compact the rods, and used the materials of the day to hold system of metal plates, placed inside a wooden frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Age of Genius: 1300 to 1800|first=Michael John|last=Bradley|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8160-5424-4|page=36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VS66a1siE4YC&amp;pg=PA36}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Randomness''' is the lack of [[pattern]] or [[predictability]] in events.&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines "random" as "Having no definite aim or purpose; not sent or guided in a particular direction; made, done, occurring, etc., without method or conscious choice; haphazard."&lt;/ref&gt;  A random sequence of events, [[symbol]]s or [[Procedure (term)|steps]] has no [[:wikt:order|order]] and does not follow an intelligible pattern or combination. Individual random events are by definition unpredictable, but in many cases the frequency of different outcomes over a large number of events (or "trials") is predictable.  For example, when throwing two [[dice]], the outcome of any particular roll is unpredictable, but a sum of 7 will occur twice as often as 4.  In this view, randomness is a measure of uncertainty of an outcome, rather than haphazardness, and applies to concepts of chance, [[probability]], and [[information entropy]].

The fields of mathematics, probability, and statistics use formal definitions of randomness.  In statistics, a [[random variable]] is an assignment of a numerical value to each possible outcome of an event space.  This association facilitates the identification and the calculation of probabilities of the events. Random variables can appear in [[random sequence]]s. A [[random process]] is a sequence of random variables whose outcomes do not follow a [[determinism|deterministic]] pattern, but follow an evolution described by [[probability distribution]]s.  These and other constructs are extremely useful in [[probability theory]] and the various [[applications of randomness]].

Randomness is most often used in [[statistics]] to signify well-defined statistical properties. [[Monte Carlo method]]s, which rely on random input (such as from [[random number generation|random number generators]] or [[pseudorandom number generator]]s), are important techniques in science, as, for instance, in [[Scientific computing|computational science]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~junliu/Workshops/workshop2007/ Third Workshop on Monte Carlo Methods], Jun Liu, Professor of Statistics, Harvard University&lt;/ref&gt; By analogy, [[quasi-Monte Carlo method]]s use [[low-discrepancy sequence|quasirandom number generators]].

'''Random selection''', when narrowly associated with a [[simple random sample]], is a method of selecting items (often called units) from a population where the probability of choosing a specific item is the proportion of those items in the population.  For example, with a bowl containing just 10 red marbles and 90 blue marbles, a random selection mechanism would choose a red marble with probability 1/10.  Note that a random selection mechanism that selected 10 marbles from this bowl would not necessarily result in 1 red and 9 blue.  In situations where a population consists of items that are distinguishable, a random selection mechanism requires equal probabilities for any item to be chosen.  That is, if the selection process is such that each member of a population, of say research subjects, has the same probability of being chosen then we can say the selection process is random.

== History ==
{{Main|History of randomness}}
[[File:Pompeii - Osteria della Via di Mercurio - Dice Players.jpg|thumb|Ancient [[fresco]] of dice players in [[Pompei]].]]
In ancient history, the concepts of chance and randomness were intertwined with that of fate. Many ancient peoples threw [[dice]] to determine fate, and this later evolved into games of chance. Most ancient cultures used various methods of [[divination]] to attempt to circumvent randomness and fate.&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook to life in ancient Rome'' by Lesley Adkins 1998 {{isbn|0-19-512332-8}} page 279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Religions of the ancient world'' by Sarah Iles Johnston 2004 {{isbn|0-674-01517-7}} page 370&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese of 3000 years ago were perhaps the earliest people to formalize odds and chance. The Greek philosophers discussed randomness at length, but only in non-quantitative forms. It was only in the 16th century that Italian mathematicians began to formalize the odds associated with various games of chance. The invention of the [[calculus]] had a positive impact on the formal study of randomness. In the 1888 edition of his book ''The Logic of Chance'' [[John Venn]] wrote a chapter on ''The conception of randomness'' that included his view of the randomness of the digits of the number [[pi]] by using them to construct a [[random walk]] in two dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;''Annotated readings in the history of statistics'' by Herbert Aron David, 2001 {{isbn|0-387-98844-0}} page 115. Note that the 1866 edition of Venn's  book (on Google books) does not include this chapter.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early part of the 20th century saw a rapid growth in the formal analysis of randomness, as various approaches to the mathematical foundations of probability were introduced. In the mid- to late-20th century, ideas of [[algorithmic information theory]] introduced new dimensions to the field via the concept of [[algorithmic randomness]].

Although randomness had often been viewed as an obstacle and a nuisance for many centuries, in the 20th century computer scientists began to realize that the ''deliberate'' introduction of randomness into computations can be an effective tool for designing better algorithms. In some cases such [[randomized algorithms]] outperform the best deterministic methods.

=== In the physical sciences ===
In the 19th century, scientists used the idea of random motions of molecules in the development of [[statistical mechanics]] to explain phenomena in [[thermodynamics]] and [[gas laws|the properties of gases]].

According to several standard interpretations of [[quantum mechanics]], microscopic phenomena are objectively random.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v446/n7138/abs/nature05677.html Nature.com] in [[Bell's aspect experiment]]: ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''&lt;/ref&gt; That is, in an experiment that controls all causally relevant parameters, some aspects of the outcome still vary randomly. For example, if a single unstable [[atom]] is placed in a controlled environment, it cannot be predicted how long it will take for the atom to decay—only the probability of decay in a given time.&lt;ref&gt;"Each nucleus decays spontaneously, at random, in accordance with the blind workings of chance." ''Q for Quantum'', [[John Gribbin]]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, quantum mechanics does not specify the outcome of individual experiments but only the probabilities.  [[Hidden variable theory|Hidden variable theories]] reject the view that nature contains irreducible randomness: such theories posit that in the processes that appear random, properties with a certain statistical distribution are at work behind the scenes, determining the outcome in each case.

=== In biology ===
The [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]] ascribes the observed diversity of life to random genetic [[mutation]]s followed by [[natural selection]]. The latter retains some random mutations in the [[gene pool]] due to the systematically improved chance for survival and reproduction that those mutated genes confer on individuals who possess them.

Several authors also claim that evolution and sometimes development require a specific form of randomness, namely the introduction of qualitatively new behaviors. Instead of the choice of one possibility among several pre-given ones, this randomness corresponds to the formation of new possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Longo|first=Giuseppe|last2=Montévil|first2=Maël|last3=Kauffman|first3=Stuart|date=2012-01-01|year=|title=No Entailing Laws, but Enablement in the Evolution of the Biosphere|url=https://www.academia.edu/11720588/No_entailing_laws_but_enablement_in_the_evolution_of_the_biosphere|journal=Proceedings of the 14th Annual Conference Companion on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation|series=GECCO '12|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|volume=|pages=1379–1392|doi=10.1145/2330784.2330946|isbn=9781450311786|via=|arxiv=1201.2069}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Longo|first=Giuseppe|last2=Montévil|first2=Maël|date=2013-10-01|year=|title=Extended criticality, phase spaces and enablement in biology|url=https://www.academia.edu/11720575/Extended_criticality_phase_spaces_and_enablement_in_biology|journal=Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals|series=Emergent Critical Brain Dynamics|volume=55|pages=64–79|doi=10.1016/j.chaos.2013.03.008|via=|bibcode=2013CSF....55...64L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristics of an organism arise to some extent deterministically (e.g., under the influence of genes and the environment) and to some extent randomly. For example, the ''density'' of [[freckles]] that appear on a person's skin is controlled by genes and exposure to light; whereas the exact location of ''individual'' freckles seems random.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Breathnach |first= A. S. |year= 1982 |title= A long-term hypopigmentary effect of thorium-X on freckled skin |journal= British Journal of Dermatology |volume= 106 |issue= 1 |pages= 19–25 |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2133.1982.tb00897.x |quote= The distribution of freckles seems entirely random, and not associated with any other obviously punctuate anatomical or physiological feature of skin. |pmid= 7059501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as behavior is concerned, randomness is important if an animal is to behave in a way that is unpredictable to others. For instance, insects in flight tend to move about with random changes in direction, making it difficult for pursuing predators to predict their trajectories.

=== In mathematics ===
The mathematical theory of [[probability]] arose from attempts to formulate mathematical descriptions of chance events, originally in the context of [[gambling]], but later in connection with physics. [[Statistics]] is used to infer the underlying [[probability distribution]] of a collection of empirical observations. For the purposes of [[simulation]], it is necessary to have a large supply of [[Random sequence|random numbers]] or means to generate them on demand.

[[Algorithmic information theory]] studies, among other topics, what constitutes a [[random sequence]]. The central idea is that a string of [[bit]]s is random if and only if it is shorter than any computer program that can produce that string ([[Kolmogorov randomness]])—this means that random strings are those that cannot be [[data compression|compressed]]. Pioneers of this field include [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] and his student [[Per Martin-Löf]], [[Ray Solomonoff]], and [[Gregory Chaitin]]. For the notion of infinite sequence, one normally uses [[Per Martin-Löf]]'s definition.
That is, an infinite sequence is random if and only if it withstands all recursively enumerable null sets. The other notions of random sequences include (but not limited to): recursive randomness and Schnorr randomness which are based on recursively computable martingales. It was shown by [[Yongge Wang]] that these randomness notions are generally different.&lt;ref&gt;Yongge Wang: Randomness and Complexity. PhD Thesis, 1996. http://webpages.uncc.edu/yonwang/papers/thesis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Randomness occurs in numbers such as [[binary logarithm|log (2)]] and [[pi]]. The decimal digits of pi constitute an infinite sequence and "never repeat in a cyclical fashion." Numbers like pi are also considered likely to be [[normal number|normal]], which means their digits are random in a certain statistical sense.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Pi certainly seems to behave this way. In the first six billion decimal places of pi, each of the digits from 0 through 9 shows up about six hundred million times. Yet such results, conceivably accidental, do not prove normality even in base 10, much less normality in other number bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/pi-random.html |title=Are the digits of pi random? researcher may hold the key |publisher=Lbl.gov |date=2001-07-23 |accessdate=2012-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== In statistics ===
{{main|Statistical randomness}}
In statistics, randomness is commonly used to create [[simple random samples]]. This lets surveys of completely random groups of people provide realistic data. Common methods of doing this include drawing names out of a hat or using a random digit chart. A random digit chart is simply a large table of random digits.

=== In information science ===
In information science, irrelevant or meaningless data is considered noise. Noise consists of a large number of transient disturbances with a statistically randomized time distribution.

In [[communication theory]], randomness in a signal is called "noise" and is opposed to that component of its variation that is causally attributable to the source, the signal.

In terms of the development of random networks, for communication randomness rests on the two simple assumptions of [[Paul Erdős]] and [[Alfréd Rényi]] who said that there were a fixed number of nodes and this number remained fixed for the life of the network, and that all nodes were equal and linked randomly to each other.{{Clarify|date=March 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;Laszso Barabasi, (2003), Linked, Rich Gets Richer, P81&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In finance ===
The [[random walk hypothesis]] considers that asset prices in an organized [[Market (economics)|market]] evolve at random, in the sense that the expected value of their change is zero but the actual value may turn out to be positive or negative. More generally, asset prices are influenced by a variety of unpredictable events in the general economic environment.

== In politics ==

Random selection can be an official method to resolve [[Tie (draw)|tied]] elections in some jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;Municipal Elections Act (Ontario, Canada) 1996, c. 32, Sched., s. 62 (3) : "If the recount indicates that two or more candidates who cannot both or all be declared elected to an office have received the same number of votes, the clerk shall choose the successful candidate or candidates by lot."&lt;/ref&gt; Its use in politics is very old, as office holders in [[Ancient Athens]] were chosen by lot, there being no voting.

== Randomness and religion ==
Randomness can be seen as conflicting with the [[deterministic]] ideas of some religions, such as those where the universe is created by an omniscient deity who is aware of all past and future events. If the universe is regarded to have a purpose, then randomness can be seen as impossible. This is one of the rationales for religious opposition to [[evolution]], which states that [[non-random]] selection is applied to the results of random genetic variation.

[[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] philosophies state that any event is the result of previous events, as reflected in the concept of [[karma]], and as such there is no such thing as a random event or a first event{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}.

In some religious contexts, procedures that are commonly perceived as randomizers are used for divination. [[Cleromancy]] uses the casting of bones or dice to reveal what is seen as the will of the gods.

== Applications ==
{{main|Applications of randomness}}

In most of its mathematical, political, social and religious uses, randomness is used for its innate "fairness" and lack of bias.

'''Politics''': [[Athenian democracy]] was based on the concept of [[isonomia]] (equality of political rights) and used complex allotment machines to ensure that the positions on the ruling committees that ran Athens were fairly allocated. [[Sortition|Allotment]] is now restricted to selecting jurors in Anglo-Saxon legal systems and in situations where "fairness" is approximated by [[randomization]], such as selecting [[juror]]s and military [[Conscription|draft]] lotteries.

'''Games''': Random numbers were first investigated in the context of [[gambling]], and many randomizing devices, such as [[dice]], [[shuffling playing cards]], and [[roulette]] wheels, were first developed for use in gambling. The ability to produce random numbers fairly is vital to electronic gambling, and, as such, the methods used to create them are usually regulated by government [[Gaming Control Board]]s. Random drawings are also used to determine [[lottery]] winners.  Throughout history, randomness has been used for games of chance and to select out individuals for an unwanted task in a fair way (see [[drawing straws]]).

'''Sports''': Some sports, including [[American football]], use [[coin toss]]es to randomly select starting conditions for games or [[seed (sports)|seed]] tied teams for [[playoffs|postseason play]].  The [[National Basketball Association]] uses a weighted [[NBA Draft Lottery|lottery]] to order teams in its draft.

'''Mathematics''': Random numbers are also employed where their use is mathematically important, such as sampling for [[opinion poll]]s and for statistical sampling in [[quality control]] systems. Computational solutions for some types of problems use random numbers extensively, such as in the [[Monte Carlo method]] and in [[genetic algorithm]]s.

'''Medicine''': Random allocation of a clinical intervention is used to reduce bias in controlled trials (e.g., [[randomized controlled trials]]).

'''Religion''': Although not intended to be random, various forms of [[divination]] such as [[cleromancy]] see what appears to be a random event as a means for a divine being to communicate their will. (See also [[Free will]] and [[Determinism]]).

== Generation ==
{{main|Random number generation}}
[[File:Roulette wheel.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The ball in a [[roulette]] can be used as a source of apparent randomness, because its behavior is very sensitive to the initial conditions.]]
It is generally accepted that there exist three mechanisms responsible for (apparently) random behavior in systems:

# ''Randomness'' coming from the environment (for example, [[Brownian motion]], but also [[hardware random number generator]]s)
# ''Randomness'' coming from the initial conditions. This aspect is studied by [[chaos theory]] and is observed in systems whose behavior is very sensitive to small variations in initial conditions (such as [[pachinko]] machines and [[dice]]).
# ''Randomness'' intrinsically generated by the system. This is also called [[pseudorandomness]] and is the kind used in [[pseudo-random number generator]]s. There are many algorithms (based on [[arithmetics]] or [[cellular automaton]]) to generate pseudorandom numbers. The behavior of the system can be determined by knowing the [[random seed|seed state]] and the algorithm used. These methods are often quicker than getting "true" randomness from the environment.

The many [[applications of randomness]] have led to many different methods for generating random data. These methods may vary as to how unpredictable or [[statistical randomness|statistically random]] they are, and how quickly they can generate random numbers.

Before the advent of computational [[random number generator]]s, generating large amounts of sufficiently random numbers (important in statistics) required a lot of work. Results would sometimes be collected and distributed as [[random number table]]s.

== Measures and tests ==
{{main|Randomness tests}}
There are many practical measures of randomness for a binary sequence. These include measures based on frequency, [[discrete transform]]s, and [[complexity]], or a mixture of these. These include tests by Kak, Phillips, Yuen, Hopkins, Beth and Dai, Mund, and Marsaglia and Zaman.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Ritter, Randomness tests: a literature survey. [http://www.ciphersbyritter.com/RES/RANDTEST.HTM ciphersbyritter.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Quantum Non-Locality has been used to certify the presence of genuine randomness in a given string of numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pironio et.al|first1=S.|title=Random Numbers Certified by Bell's Theorem|journal=Nature|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature09008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Misconceptions and logical fallacies ==
{{main|Gambler's fallacy}}
Popular perceptions of randomness are frequently mistaken, based on fallacious reasoning or intuitions.

=== A number is "due" ===
{{See also|Coupon collector's problem}}

This argument is, "In a random selection of numbers, since all numbers eventually appear,  those that have not come up yet are 'due', and thus more likely to come up soon."  This logic is only correct if applied to a system where numbers that come up are removed from the system, such as when [[playing card]]s are drawn and not returned to the deck. In this case, once a jack is removed from the deck, the next draw is less likely to be a jack and more likely to be some other card. However, if the jack is returned to the deck, and the deck is thoroughly reshuffled, a jack is as likely to be drawn as any other card. The same applies in any other process where objects are selected independently, and none are removed after each event, such as the roll of a die, a coin toss, or most [[lottery]] number selection schemes. Truly random processes such as these do not have memory, making it impossible for past outcomes to affect future outcomes.

=== A number is "cursed" or "blessed" ===
{{See also|Benford's law}}
In a random sequence of numbers, a number may be said to be cursed because it has come up less often in the past, and so it is thought that it will occur less often in the future. A number may be assumed to be blessed because it has occurred more often than others in the past, and so it is thought likely to come up more often in the future. This logic is valid only if the randomisation is biased, for example with a loaded die. If the die is fair, then previous rolls give no indication of future events.

In nature, events rarely occur with perfectly equal frequency, so observing outcomes to determine which events are more probable makes sense. It is fallacious to apply this logic to systems designed to make all outcomes equally likely, such as shuffled cards, dice, and roulette wheels.

=== Odds are never dynamic ===
In the beginning of a scenario, one might calculate the probability of a certain event. The fact is, as soon as one gains more information about that situation, they may need to re-calculate the probability.

[[File:Monty open door.svg|thumb|100px|When the host reveals one door that contains a goat, this is new information.]]
Say we are told that a woman has two children. If we ask whether either of them is a girl, and are told yes, what is the probability that the other child is also a girl? Considering this new child independently, one might expect the probability that the other child is female is ½ (50%). But by building a [[probability space]] (illustrating all possible outcomes), we see that the probability is actually only ⅓ (33%). This is because the possibility space illustrates 4 ways of having these two children: boy-boy, girl-boy, boy-girl, and girl-girl. But we were given more information. Once we are told that one of the children is a female, we use this new information to eliminate the boy-boy scenario. Thus the probability space reveals that there are still 3 ways to have two children where one is a female: boy-girl, girl-boy, girl-girl. Only ⅓ of these scenarios would have the other child also be a girl.&lt;ref name=NYOdds&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/08/books/review/Johnson-G-t.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | first=George | last=Johnson | title=Playing the Odds | date=8 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a probability space, we are less likely to miss one of the possible scenarios, or to neglect the importance of new information. For further information, see [[Boy or girl paradox]].

This technique provides insights in other situations such as the [[Monty Hall problem]], a game show scenario in which a car is hidden behind one of three doors, and two goats are hidden as [[booby prize]]s behind the others. Once the contestant has chosen a door, the host opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a goat, eliminating that door as an option. With only two doors left (one with the car, the other with another goat), the player must decide to either keep their decision, or switch and select the other door. Intuitively, one might think the player is choosing between two doors with equal probability, and that the opportunity to choose another door makes no difference. But probability spaces reveal that the contestant has received new information, and can increase their chances of winning by changing to the other door.&lt;ref name=NYOdds/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4817">In [[quantum mechanics]], and especially [[quantum information]] and the study of [[open quantum system]]s, the '''trace distance''' ''T'' is a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] on the space of [[density matrix|density matrices]] and gives a measure of the distinguishability between two states. It is the quantum generalization of the [[Kolmogorov–Smirnov test|Kolmogorov distance]] for classical probability distributions.

== Definition ==
The trace distance is just half of the [[trace norm]] of the difference of the matrices:

:&lt;math&gt;T(\rho,\sigma) := \frac{1}{2}||\rho - \sigma||_{1} = \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{Tr} \left[ \sqrt{(\rho-\sigma)^\dagger (\rho-\sigma)} \right] .&lt;/math&gt; 

(The trace norm is the [[Schatten norm]] for ''p''=1.)  The purpose of the factor of two is to restrict the trace distance between two normalized density matrices to the range [0,&amp;nbsp;1] and to simplify formulas in which the trace distance appears.

Since density matrices are [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian]], 

:&lt;math&gt;T(\rho,\sigma) = \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{Tr} \left[ \sqrt{(\rho-\sigma)^2} \right] = \frac{1}{2} \sum_i | \lambda_i | , &lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; are eigenvalues of the Hermitian, but not necessarily positive, matrix &lt;math&gt;(\rho-\sigma)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Physical interpretation ==
It can be shown that the trace distance satisfies the equation&lt;ref name="nielsen"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Nielsen|first=Michael A.|authorlink1=Michael Nielsen|last2=Chuang|first2=Isaac L.|authorlink2=Isaac Chuang|title=[[Quantum Computation and Quantum Information (book)|Quantum Computation and Quantum Information]]|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=2010|edition=2nd|oclc=844974180|isbn=978-1-107-00217-3|chapter=9. Distance measures for quantum information}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
T(\rho,\sigma) = \frac{1}{2}\max_{\{P_i\}} \Sigma_{P_i} \mathrm{Tr}[P_i(\rho-\sigma)],
&lt;/math&gt;
where the maximization can be carried out over all [[POVM|POVMs]] &lt;math&gt;\{P_i\}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Tr}[P(\rho-\sigma)]&lt;/math&gt; is the difference in probability that the outcome of the measurement be &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, depending on whether the system was in the state &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the trace distance is the probability difference maximized over all possible measurements: it gives a measure of the maximum probability of distinguishing between two states with an optimal measurement.

For example, suppose [[Alice and Bob|Alice]] prepares a system in either the state &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, each with probability &lt;math&gt;\frac 12&lt;/math&gt; and sends it to Bob who has to discriminate between the two states. It is easy to show that with the optimal measurement, Bob has the probability
:&lt;math&gt;
p_{\text{max}} = \frac 12 (1 + T(\rho,\sigma))
&lt;/math&gt;
of correctly identifying in which state Alice prepared the system.&lt;ref&gt;S. M. Barnett, "Quantum Information", Oxford University Press, 2009, Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
The trace distance has the following properties&lt;ref name="nielsen" /&gt;
* It is a metric on the space of density matrices, i.e. it is non-negative, symmetric, and satisfies the [[triangle inequality]], and &lt;math&gt;T(\rho,\sigma) = 0 \Leftrightarrow \rho=\sigma&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;0 \leq T(\rho,\sigma) \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T(\rho,\sigma)=1 &lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; have orthogonal supports
* It is preserved under [[unitary operator|unitary transformations]]: &lt;math&gt;T(U\rho U^\dagger,U\sigma U^\dagger) = T(\rho,\sigma) &lt;/math&gt;
* It is contractive under [[Quantum operation|trace-preserving CP maps]], i.e. if &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is a CPT map, then &lt;math&gt;T(\Phi(\rho),\Phi(\sigma))\leq T(\rho,\sigma)&lt;/math&gt;
* It is convex in each of its inputs. E.g. &lt;math&gt;T(\sum_i p_i \rho_i,\sigma) \leq \sum_i p_i T(\rho_i,\sigma)&lt;/math&gt;

For [[qubits]], the trace distance is equal to half the [[Euclidean distance]] in the [[Bloch sphere|Bloch representation]].

=== Relationship to other distance measures ===
==== Fidelity ====
The [[Fidelity of quantum states|fidelity]] of two quantum states &lt;math&gt;F(\rho,\sigma)&lt;/math&gt; is related to the trace distance &lt;math&gt;T(\rho,\sigma)&lt;/math&gt; by the inequalities

:&lt;math&gt;
1-F(\rho,\sigma) \le T(\rho,\sigma) \le\sqrt{1-F(\rho,\sigma)^2} \, .
&lt;/math&gt;

The upper bound inequality becomes an equality when &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; are [[quantum state#pure states|pure states]].

==== Total variation distance ====

The trace distance is a generalization of the [[Total variation distance of probability measures|total variation distance]], and for two commuting density matrices, has the same value as the total variation distance of the two corresponding probability distributions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5086">A '''variational principle''' is a scientific principle used within the [[calculus of variations]], which develops general methods for finding functions which extremize the value of quantities that depend upon those functions. For example, to answer this question: "What is the [[Catenary|shape of a chain]] suspended at both ends?" we can use the variational principle that the shape must minimize the gravitational potential energy.

==Overview==
Any physical law which can be expressed as a variational principle describes a [[self-adjoint operator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Cornelius |last=Lanczos |author-link=Cornelius Lanczos |orig-year=1st published 1970, [[University of Toronto Press]] |title=The Variational Principles of Mechanics |publisher=Dover |date=1974 |ISBN=0-8020-1743-6 |edition=4th, paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; These expressions are also called [[Hermitian]]. Such an expression describes an [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under a Hermitian transformation.

==History==
{{main|History of variational principles in physics}}
[[Felix Klein]]'s [[Erlangen program]] attempted to identify such invariants under a group of transformations. In what is referred to in physics as [[Noether's theorem]], the [[Poincaré group]] of transformations (what is now called a [[gauge group]]) for [[general relativity]] defines symmetries under a group of transformations which depend on a variational principle, or [[Action (physics)|action principle]].

'''Water pouring puzzles''' (also called '''water jug problems''' or '''measuring puzzles''') are a class of [[puzzle]] involving a finite collection of [[Jug|water jug]]s of known [[integer]] capacities (in terms of a [[Units of volume|liquid measure]] such as [[liter]]s or [[gallon]]s).
Initially each jug contains a known integer volume of liquid, not necessarily equal to its capacity.
Puzzles of this type ask how many steps of pouring water from one jug to another (until either one jug becomes empty or the other becomes full) are needed to reach a goal state, specified in terms of the volume of liquid that must be present in some jug or jugs.

==Rules==
It is a common assumption, stated as part of these puzzles, that the jugs in the puzzle are irregularly shaped and unmarked, so that it is impossible to accurately measure
any quantity of water that does not completely fill a jug. Other assumptions of these problems may include that no water can be spilled, and that each step pouring water from a source
jug to a destination jug stops when either the source jug
is empty or the destination jug is full, whichever happens first.

==Standard example==
The standard puzzle of this kind works with three jugs of capacity 8, 5 and 3 liters. These are initially filled with 8, 0 and 0 liters. In the goal state they should filled with 4, 4 and 0 liters.
The puzzle may be solved in seven steps, passing through the following sequence of states (denoted as a bracketed triple of the three volumes of water in the three jugs):
:[8,0,0] → [3,5,0] → [3,2,3] → [6,2,0] → [6,0,2] → [1,5,2] → [1,4,3] → [4,4,0].

{{harvtxt|Cowley|1926}} writes that this particular puzzle "dates back to mediaeval times" and notes its occurrence in [[Claude Gaspard Bachet de Méziriac|Bachet]]'s 17th-century mathematics textbook. 

==Variant with taps and sinks==
[[File:Die.hard.water.puzzle.jpg|thumb|The solution to the puzzle, using two containers, a tap and a drain]]
The rules are sometimes formulated by adding a 
source (tap) and a drain (sink) which provide an infinite amount
of additional water and an opportunity to pour all liquid from any jug into the
sink. Filling a jug to the rim from the tap or pouring the entire 
contents of jug into the drain each count as one step while
solving the problem. This version of the puzzle was featured in a scene of the 1995 movie ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://puzzles.nigelcoldwell.co.uk/twentytwohint.htm Hint to Riddle #22: The 3 &amp; 5 Litre Die Hard Water Puzzle]. Puzzles.nigelcoldwell.co.uk. Retrieved on 2017-07-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

This variant is identical to the original, as a third container capable of holding the contents of the first two is mathematically equivalent to a tap or drain capable of filling or emptying both containers.

==Three jugs==
If the number of jugs is three, the filling status after
each step can be described in a diagram of barycentric coordinates,
because the sum of all three integers stays the same throughout
all steps. In consequence the steps can be visualized as some
kind of billard moves in the (clipped) coordinate system on a
triangular lattice.

In mathematics, the '''''Zahlbericht''''' (number report) was a report on [[algebraic number theory]] by {{harvs|txt|last=Hilbert|authorlink=David Hilbert|year1=1897|year2=1998|loc2=(English translation)}}.

==History==
In 1893 the German mathematical society invited Hilbert and [[Hermann Minkowski|Minkowski]] to write reports on the theory of numbers. They agreed that Minkowski would cover the more elementary parts of number theory while Hilbert would cover algebraic number theory. Minkowski eventually abandoned his report, while Hilbert's report was published in 1897. It was reprinted in volume 1 of his collected works, and republished in an English translation in 1998.
{{harvtxt|Corry|1996}} and {{harvtxt|Schappacher|2005}} and the English introduction to {{harv|Hilbert|1998}} give detailed discussions of the history and influence of Hilbert's ''Zahlbericht''. 

Some earlier reports on number theory include the report by [[H. J. S. Smith]] in 6 parts between 1859 and 1865, reprinted in {{harvtxt|Smith|1965}}, and the report by {{harvtxt|Brill|Noether|1894}}. {{harvs|txt|last=Hasse|year1=1926|year2=1927|year3=1930}} wrote an update of Hilbert's Zahlbericht that covered [[class field theory]] (republished in 1 volume as {{harv|Hasse|1970}}).

==Contents==
Part 1 covers the theory of general [[number field]]s, including ideals, [[discriminant]]s, differents, units, and ideal classes. 

Part 2 covers [[Galois extension|Galois number field]]s, including in particular [[Hilbert's theorem 90]].

Part 3 covers [[quadratic number field]]s, including the theory of genera, and [[Ideal class group|class number]]s of quadratic fields.

Part 4 covers [[cyclotomic field]]s, including the [[Kronecker–Weber theorem]] (theorem 131), the [[Hilbert–Speiser theorem]] (theorem 132), and the [[Eisenstein reciprocity law]] for ''l''th power residues (theorem 140) .

Part 5 covers [[Kummer extension|Kummer number fields]], and ends with Kummer's proof of Fermat's last theorem for [[regular prime]]s.
