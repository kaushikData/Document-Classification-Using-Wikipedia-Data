      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17100">'''Agency''' (also referred to as '''free agency''' or '''moral agency'''), in [[Beliefs and practices of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saint theology]], is "the privilege of choice which was introduced by God the Eternal Father to all of his spirit children in the premortal state".&lt;ref name="stapley"/&gt;  Mortal life is viewed as a test of faith, where our choices are central to the [[Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|plan of salvation]] in Mormon teaching. "It was essential for their eternal progression that they be subjected to the influences of both good and evil".&lt;ref name="stapley" /&gt; Mormons believe that Lucifer presented an alternative plan, which resulted in a [[war in heaven]], with Lucifer being cast out of heaven and becoming Satan.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Abraham |abr|3|24|28}}; {{lds|Revelation|rev|12|7|9}}; {{lds|Isaiah|isa|14|12|15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mormons believe that all individuals have the ability to differentiate between good and evil&lt;ref&gt;See {{lds|Moroni|moro|7|18|19}}; {{lds|Moroni|moro|8|9|10}}; {{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|88|6|7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and that Satan and his followers are not able to tempt people beyond the point where they can resist.&lt;ref&gt;See {{lds|1 Corinthians|1-cor|10|13}}; {{lds|Alma|alma|13|28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that mortals can be held accountable for their actions;&lt;ref name="Self-Accountability and Human Progress"/&gt; mortals will be judged by God based on a combination of one's faith and works (with salvation coming only through the power, mercy, and grace of Jesus Christ).&lt;ref name="Faith and Good Works"/&gt;

==Pre-Earth life==
{{See also|Pre-mortal existence#Latter Day Saints}}
A major difference between the beliefs of Latter-day Saints and many other Christians involves the belief of a life before mortality, referred to as the pre-earth life, pre-mortal life, or [[pre-existence]]. Latter-day Saints believe that before the earth was created, all mankind lived as spirit children of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Hebrews|heb|12|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, God nurtured, taught and provided means for their development. This preparation would allow them to later become the men and women of Earth, to be further educated and tested in the schoolhouse of mortality in order to return to God's presence and become like him. Thus, the pre-existent life is believed to have been a period of unknown length of progression, and schooling. Mormons believe that there came a time when we could not progress further without being born into a body and experiencing earthly life.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/2002/01/the-choice-that-began-mortality |title= The Choice That Began Mortality |first= Jess L. |last= Christensen |date=January 2002 |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mormon beliefs, God proposed a plan whereby further progression could take place, a [[plan of salvation]]. Because agency would allow all people to fall in sin, a savior was necessary to [[Atonement in Christianity|atone]] for the sins of each person so that they could return to live with their Father in Heaven. [[Jesus]] volunteered to follow the plan as outlined, which preserved agency, accountability for action, and the necessary result that some of Heavenly Father's children would never to return to Heavenly Father as a consequence of sin. The second volunteer, [[Lucifer]], attempted to amend the plan by proposing that all mankind would return to Heavenly Father despite their sins—essentially defeating agency and the divine principle of accountability for action. God the Father chose the plan that he proposed with Jesus as the Savior. Lucifer and his followers rebelled against this plan and were eventually cast out of heaven. Lucifer became [[Satan]].&lt;ref&gt;Much of this is discussed in {{lds|Abraham|abr|3|22|28}}. Latter-day Saints also believe {{lds|Isaiah|isa|14|12|15}} refers to this incident.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreordination===
Mormons believe that another aspect of agency occurred during the pre-mortal life. Some of the spirit children of God exercised their agency and conformed to God's law and became "noble and great". This doctrine is called "[[Predestination|foreordination]]". God foreordained some of these spirits to particular stations in life in order to advance his plan to lead humanity back to his presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Abraham|abr|22|23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mormons believe that these foreordinations were not unalterable decrees, but rather callings from God for man to perform specific missions in mortality. Even these who were foreordained for greatness could fall and transgress the laws of God. Therefore, mortality is simply a state wherein progression and testing is continued from what began in the pre-existence.

Mormon doctrine states that God's plan includes the foreordination of prophets and teachers who have gifts and callings among men to teach and re-teach correct principles so that agency can be used wisely.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Jeremiah|jer|1|5}}&lt;/ref&gt; God's plan includes the important role of parents to teach their children the path of righteousness and happiness,&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Deuteronomy|deut|6|7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the blessing of the holy scriptures to give a foundation of gospel knowledge, including the knowledge of the saving role of Jesus Christ and the importance of ordinances and covenants of the gospel.

==Earth life==
In essence, agency is the ability to make choices for oneself, as well as the ability to learn the difference between right and wrong and to make ethical and moral decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/study/topics/agency |title= Gospel Topics: Agency |work= lds.org |publisher= LDS Church }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David O. McKay]], a [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President of the Church]], stated, "It is the purpose of the Lord that man become like him. In order for man to achieve this it was necessary for the Creator first to make him free."&lt;ref&gt;''Conference Report'', April 1950, 32. As quoted in {{citation|url=http://institute.lds.org/content/languages/english/Institute%20of%20Religion%20Materials/Student%20Manuals/Religion%20430-431,%20Doctrines%20of%20the%20Gospel%20Student%20Manual~eng.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514133833/http://institute.lds.org/content/languages/english/Institute%20of%20Religion%20Materials/Student%20Manuals/Religion%20430-431,%20Doctrines%20of%20the%20Gospel%20Student%20Manual~eng.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-05-14 |chapter=Chapter 11: The Agency of Man |title=Doctrines of the Gospel: Student Manual, Religion 430 and 431 |publisher=[[Institute of Religion|Institute]] program, [[Church Educational System]], LDS Church |edition=Second |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without agency, mortality would be useless. Men are ultimately responsible for their own destiny, through their faith and obedience to the commandments of God. "Free agency" therefore should not be interpreted to mean that actions are without consequences; "free"  means that it is a gift from God and consequences must necessarily come as a result of choices made. Free agency and accountability are complementary and cannot be separated.

This principle holds that it is wrong to deny someone of his or her free agency unless they have abused it to infringe against the agency of another, as it would bind a person from their own choices. Such offenses logically include crimes such as [[murder]], [[rape]] and [[slavery]]. Furthermore, a person who prevents an individual from doing what they have been commanded to do (e.g., force them to do something they believe is wrong) will be held responsible for any offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= James E. |last= Talmage |authorlink= James E. Talmage |origyear= 1899 |year= 1981 |title= [[Articles of Faith (Talmage)|Articles of Faith]] |location= Salt Lake City, Utah |publisher= Deseret Book |page= {{Page needed|date=February 2012}} |isbn= 0-87747-838-4 |oclc= 6708594 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 20th century, church leaders often equated governments led by dictatorships as being under the influence and control of Satan.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} For example, [[apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] [[Ezra Taft Benson]] often spoke of the "evil" communist or socialist movements that threatened the free agency of mankind: "it is realized that communism is turning out to be the earthly image of the plan which Satan presented in the preexistence. The whole program of socialistic communism is essentially a war against God and the plan of salvation—the very plan which we fought to uphold during 'the war in heaven.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Ezra Taft |last= Benson |authorlink= Ezra Taft Benson |year= 1974 |chapter= The American Heritage of Freedom |title= God, Family, Country: Our Three Great Loyalties |location= Salt Lake City |publisher= [[Deseret Book]] |page= 356 |oclc= 1130226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other 
leaders contradicted these statements, often pointing to the church's belief in the "[https://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/consecrate-law-of-consecration Law of Consecration]" which is a form of socialism practiced by early church members in which all property was held in common and distributed by church leaders based on the needs of each individual. The church is [http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/official-statement/political-neutrality officially politically neutral] and today church members around the world subscribe to a variety of political beliefs including communism and socialism.

Mormon doctrine teaches that many men and women since the beginning of mortal time have used their agency unwisely, limiting their own progress and their opportunity to receive light and knowledge. Beginning with [[Cain and Abel|Cain]], some have used their agency to inflict harm, abuse, tyranny, slavery, or death upon others, contrary to the will and commandments of God.

The fact that God allows these actions does not mean that He condones them. LDS doctrine holds that agency is an eternal principle, and that God has provided the way through the atonement of Jesus Christ whereby men and women can repent of their wrongful acts of commission or of omission, and come back into the path of receiving further light and knowledge through making right choices. The atonement of Christ and the plan of compassion among men also provides a way whereby those who have been harmed by the sinful actions of others may be healed in a spiritual sense, although this may take great patience and long-suffering, and often requires the help of others.

[[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|The Pearl of Great Price]], one of the scriptures of the LDS church, states that Satan, the great deceiver, sought during premortal life to destroy the agency of man,&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Moses|moses|4|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he continues to seek to enslave men, women and children in whatever ways that he can in this world, to "lead them captive at his will."&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Moses|moses|4|4}}&lt;/ref&gt; LDS doctrine teaches that whatever leads in this world to enslavement, addiction, or forced behavior is ultimately instigated by Satan. God allows these conditions because of the agency he has given to man, but He expects men to overcome evil by doing good among the society in which they live. God holds men and women responsible and accountable in relation to the light and knowledge they have. Every person born into the world is given the light of Christ, also called conscience, to guide each person in choosing good from evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Moroni|moro|7|18|19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LDS doctrine also holds that whenever gospel knowledge has been lost or limited among portions of mankind, this has come about because of the unrighteousness of the people and their leaders, as described by the prophet Isaiah in the Bible.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

LDS leaders teach that family and societal relationships are a part of mortal life for many purposes, including the need to learn to show love, acceptance, and compassion in ways that continue to allow agency. They teach that unrighteous dominion is never acceptable to God, and that with the agency given to men is the expectation that when they marry, they will treat their wife and children with love, respect, tenderness, and material and emotional support.  LDS leaders teach that men should treat women as equal partners in all decisions in the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|121|34|46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Free" agency===

The term free agency is commonly used, and has traditionally been interpreted as meaning that individuals have the ability to choose their actions freely. Many leaders of the LDS Church have pointed out that the term "free agency" should not be interpreted to mean that agency does not have consequences, but rather that agency is fraught with risk and choices (the result of the exercise of agency) determine eternal destination. Some church manuals avoid the term "free agency" and instead refer simply "agency."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter= Lesson 2: Agency: The Power to Choose |chapter-url= http://www.lds.org/manual/preparing-for-exaltation-teachers-manual/lesson-2-agency-the-power-to-choose |title= Preparing for Exaltation: Teacher’s Manual |year= 1998 |publisher= LDS Church |quote= Note that although the term 'free agency' is often used, the correct, scriptural term is simply 'agency'. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some church leaders favor the term "moral agency".&lt;ref&gt;E.g., {{citation |first= Dallin H. |last= Oaks |authorlink= Dallin H. Oaks |url= http://www.lds.org/liahona/2000/03/weightier-matters |title= Weightier Matters |journal= [[Liahona (magazine)|Liahona]] |date=March 2000 |page= 15 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adam and Eve===
{{see also|Fall of man}}
It is said that [[Adam and Eve (LDS Church)|Adam and Eve]] were the first of God’s children to come to Earth. They were created in God’s image, with bodies of flesh and bones. God placed them in the Garden of Eden. Here they did not remember their former existence though they were still able to enjoy God's presence and could have lived forever.

As it is believed the Heavenly Father has blessed all of His children with the freedom to choose, Adam and Eve were given agency to make their own choices on the earth.  He commanded them not to eat the forbidden fruit, or the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, warning that such would result in death. Obeying this commandment meant they could remain in the garden forever, but they could not progress by experiencing opposition in mortality and would remain innocent; they could not know joy because they could not experience sorrow and pain. Thus, as a part of the plan, Satan was allowed to tempt Adam and Eve to eat the forbidden fruit and they chose to do so. As a consequence, they were separated from God's presence physically and spiritually. Adam and Eve then became mortal; subject to sin and death, and were unable to return to Heavenly Father without his help. They could now experience disease and all types of suffering. They had moral agency, or the ability to choose between good and evil, which made it possible for them to learn and progress. It also made it possible for them to make wrong choices and to sin. In addition, they could now have children, so the rest of God’s spirit children could come to Earth, obtain physical bodies, and be proven. All this was in accordance with the plan of God. Only in this way could God's children progress and become like him.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lds.org {{specify|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alan Minter''' (born 17 August 1951) is a British former [[professional boxer]] who competed from 1972 to 1981. He held the [[undisputed champion|undisputed]] [[middleweight]] title in 1980, having previously held the [[British Boxing Board of Control|British]] middleweight from 1975 to 1976, and the [[European Boxing Union|European]] middleweight title twice between 1977 and 1979. As an [[amateur boxing|amateur]], Minter won a bronze medal in the [[light-middleweight]] division at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]].

== Amateur career ==
Minter was the 1971 [[Amateur Boxing Association of England]] Middleweight Champion. He won the bronze medal at the 1972 [[Munich]] [[Olympic Games]]. Minter began his professional career in London on 31 October 1972 by knocking out [[Maurice Thomas]] in six rounds.

=== Olympic results ===
* 1st round bye
* Defeated [[Reggie Ford (boxer)|Reggie Ford]] (Guyana) KO 2
* Defeated [[Valeri Tregubov]] (Soviet Union) 5–0
* Defeated [[Loucif Hamani]] (Algeria) 4–1
* Lost to [[Dieter Kottysch]] (West Germany) 2–3

== Professional career ==
Minter won five fights in a row by knockout and, in 1973, [[Patrick Dwyer (boxer)|Pat Dwyer]] became the first boxer to go the distance with him, over eight rounds in London. Minter won his next five fights, three by knockout, before tasting defeat for the first time after the referee stopped the fight in the eighth round to [["Scottish" Don McMillan]] due to bad cuts suffered by Minter. Two more wins followed before facing [[Jan Magziarz]], who beat him twice in a row (once in the eighth and once in the sixth) again due to cuts.

1974 was a mixed year for Minter, beating [[Tony Byrne (boxer)|Tony Byrne]] by a decision in eight, losing in two to [[Ricky Torres]] (again on cuts), having a third fight with Magziarz result in a no contest in four rounds and closing the year with a win in eight rounds by decision in his first international fight, against [[Shako Mamba]] in Hamburg, Germany.

In 1975, he won four fights in a row, including another bout in Hamburg and, by the end of the year, he challenged [[Kevin Finnegan]] for the British [[Middleweight]] title, winning it by a 15-round decision. In 1976 he won six fights, to extend his streak to ten consecutive wins. Among the boxers he beat were Billy Knight by a knockout in two and Finnegan once again, by decision in 15, both in defence of his British title, along with former world title challenger [[Tony Licata]], knocked out in six and American Olympic Games Gold medal winner [[Sugar Ray Seales]], beaten in five. These wins gave Minter a ranking among the top ten Middleweight challengers.

In 1977, he won the European Middleweight title by beating [[Germano Valsecchi]] by a knockout in five in Italy. But in his next fight his winning streak ended when he lost to former world title challenger [[Ronnie Harris (American boxer, born 1948)|Ronnie Harris]] by a knockout in eight. Minter returned to top ten challenger status by upsetting the former World [[Welterweight]] and [[Light Middleweight]] Champion [[Emile Griffith]] with a ten-round decision win in [[Monte Carlo]], but then he lost his European title to [[Gratien Tonna]] by a knockout in eight at [[Milan]]. He closed '77 with a third 15-round decision win over Finnegan to retain his British title.

1978 was a sad year for Minter, although he won all three of his bouts. On 15 February, at the [[Muhammad Ali]]–[[Leon Spinks]] I undercard in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], he won his first bout in the United States by knocking out [[Sandy Torres]] in five. Then, he went to Italy once again to regain his European Middleweight title by knocking out [[Angelo Jacopucci]] in twelve rounds. Jacopucci died a few days afterwards, due to injuries sustained in the bout. Minter finished his year by avenging his loss to Tonna with a six-round knockout.

In 1979, Minter won all four of his fights, two of them by knockout. On 16 March 1980, in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], he was given a shot at [[List of lineal boxing world champions#Middleweight|World Middleweight]] Champion [[Vito Antuofermo]]'s title at the [[Caesars Palace]]. He won the title by a 15-round decision and, in a rematch, he retained the world title by a TKO in eight rounds. Minter's run as world champion came to an end on 27 September of that year, when he was stopped on cuts in three rounds to [[Marvin Hagler]] at [[Wembley Arena]] in London. After the fight was stopped, Minter's supporters caused a riot, throwing beer cans and bottles into the ring and both boxers had to be ushered away by the police.

Minter beat fringe contender [[Ernie Singletary]] in London, in 1981, but after losses to future Hagler challengers [[Mustafa Hamsho]] in Las Vegas and [[Tony Sibson]] in London, he retired for good.

He left boxing with a record of 39 wins, 9 losses and 1 no contest, with 23 wins by knockout.

'''Ali Ashraf Darvishian''' ({{lang-fa|علی‌اشرف درویشیان}}&amp;lrm;; 25 August 1941 – 26 October 2017) was an Iranian story writer and scholar. After finishing teacher-training college, he taught at the poverty-stricken villages of Gilan-e-Gharb and Shah Abad (nowadays called Islam Abad). This atmosphere is featured in most of his stories. Later, he moved to Tehran and continued his studies in Persian literature.
As of 2006, Ali Ashraf Darvishian was in [[Australia]] as a guest of the [[Iranian Centre for Democracy]] and presented a number of lectures on a broad range of social and cultural issues.

[[File:Ali-Ashraf Darwishiyan. 2.jpg|Left|thumb|Ali-Ashraf Darvishian]]

[[Marjane Satrapi]], an Iranian-French author, mentions Darvishian in her graphic novel ''Persepolis''.

[[File:Tremisse di ariperto II con s. michele, ticinum-pavia 701-712, 03.jpg|thumb|''[[Tremissis]]'' minted at Pavia, bearing an effigy of Aripert II.]]
'''Aripert II''' (also spelled ''Aribert'') was the king of the [[Lombards]] from 701 to 712.  Duke of [[Turin]] and son of King [[Raginpert]], and thus a scion of the [[Bavarian Dynasty]], he was associated with the throne as early as 700.  He was removed by [[Liutpert]], who reigned from 700 to 702, with the exception of the year 701, when Raginpert seized the throne.  After his father's death, he tried to take the throne, too.  He defeated Liutpert and the [[regent]] [[Ansprand]]'s men at [[Pavia]] and captured the king, whom he later had strangled in his bath.  He seized the capital and forced Ansprand over the [[Alps]].  He was firmly in power by 703.

He thence reigned uninterrupted until his death.  His reign was a troubled one.  In 703, [[Faroald II of Spoleto|Faroald]], [[duke of Spoleto]], attacked the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]], but Aripert refused to assist him, for he wanted good relations with [[papacy]] and [[Byzantine Empire|empire]].  He tried nevertheless to assert his authority over Spoleto and [[Benevento]] in the [[Mezzogiorno]].  He nursed friendship with [[Pope John VI]] by donating vast tracts of land in the [[Cottian Alps]] to the Holy See.  This friendship helped him little, for he had many rebellions to deal with and many [[Slovenia|Slovene]] raids into [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]].

In 711, [[Ansprand]], whom he had exiled, returned with a large army from the [[duke of Bavaria]], [[Theodbert of Bavaria|Theudebert]].  Many Austrians (the men of Venetia and the east) joined the returning regent and battle was joined by Pavia.  Aripert fled to his capital when the tide went against him, but he hoarded the treasures and tried to cross over into [[Gaul]] by night.  He drowned in the River [[Ticino]] and Ansprand was acclaimed sovereign.  He was the last Bavarian to wear the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|Iron Crown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Arnold Hague''' (December 3, 1840, [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] – May 14, 1917, [[Washington, D.C.]]) was a [[United States]] [[geologist]] who did many geological surveys in the U.S., of which the best known was that for [[Yellowstone National Park]]. He also had assignments in [[China]] and [[Guatemala]]. He became a member of the [[United States Geological Survey|U. S. Geological Survey]] in 1879 when it was first organized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Hague, Arnold|magazine=International Who's Who|year=1912|page=558|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89097340061;view=1up;seq=576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Hague was the son of William Hague, a clergyman. He graduated from [[Sheffield Scientific School]] at [[Yale University]] in 1863. He then spent three years in Germany, studying at the universities of [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] and [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], and at the [[Freiberg Mining Academy]].

In 1867 he returned to the United States, and was appointed assistant geologist on the U. S. geological exploration of the 40th parallel under [[Clarence King]]. He then went to [[California]], and spent the winter of 1867/68 in [[Virginia City, Nevada]], studying the surface geology of the [[Comstock Lode]] and the [[chemistry]] of the amalgamation process as practised there, and known as the “[[Washoe process]]”. The results of this study were published in volume iii. of the report of the exploration, under the title of “Chemistry of the Washoe Process.” He also contributed to the same volume a chapter on the geology of the White Pine mining district, in which there was first brought to notice the great development of [[Devonian]] rocks in the Great Basin of Utah and Nevada. In volume ii. — “Descriptive Geology” — of the report of the exploration, which was the joint work of Hague and [[Samuel Franklin Emmons|Samuel F. Emmons]], there is given the results of a detailed geological survey across the Cordilleras of North America, from the Great Plains to the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] range in California. This work included a geological atlas of maps and sections, which was completed after a great deal of hardship, the map of the Great Basin being accomplished before the completion of either the [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union]] or [[Central Pacific Railroad]].

On the termination of this work in 1877, he received the appointment of government geologist of [[Guatemala]], and traveled extensively over the republic, visiting the principal mining regions and the centres of volcanic activity. In 1878 he was engaged by the [[China|Chinese]] government to examine [[gold]], [[silver]], and [[Lead (metal)|lead]] mines in northern China. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

On the organization of the [[United States Geological Survey|U. S. Geological Survey]] in 1879, he returned to the United States, and became one of its geologists. He was sent to [[Nevada]], and made a report on the “Geology of the Eureka District.” In 1883 he was made geologist of the [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone Park]] division, and assigned to the study of the [[geyser]]s of that district in connection with the extinct volcanic regions of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

He was a member of scientific societies both in the United States and Europe and in 1885 was elected to the [[National Academy of Sciences]]. He received an [[Sc.D.]] degree from [[Columbia University]] in 1901, and an [[LL.D.]] degree from [[Aberdeen University]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

He was a member of the commission appointed by the National Academy of Sciences at the request of the United States Government in 1896 to prepare plans for the [[U.S. National Forest|National Forest]] preserves. He was vice president of the International Congresses of Geologists held in [[Paris]] in 1900, in [[Stockholm]] in 1910 and in [[Toronto]] in 1913. He became president of the [[Geological Society of America]] in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Fairchild, Herman LeRoy, 1932, The Geological Society of America 1888-1930, a Chapter in Earth Science History: New York, The Geological Society of America, 232 p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eckel, Edwin, 1982, GSA Memoir 155, The Geological Society of America — Life History of a Learned Society: Boulder, Colorado, Geological Society of America Memoir 155, 168 p., {{ISBN|0-8137-1155-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
He made numerous contributions to scientific journals, on [[lithology]] and geology, and was the principal author of the following memoirs:

* ''The Volcanoes of California, Oregon, and Washington Territory'' (1883)
* ''The Volcanic Rocks of the Great Basin'' (1884)
* ''On the Development of Crystallization in the Igneous Rocks of Washoe'' (1885)

[[File:Barzakh light in Doorway.jpg|thumbnail|Barzakh: The "isthmus" between this world and the Next]]
'''Barzakh''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: برزخ, from [[Persian language|Persian]] ''barzakh'', "barrier, partition"&lt;ref name=presence&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=39XZDnOWUXsC&amp;pg=PA49|page=49|title=The Persian Presence in the Islamic World|editors=Richard G. Hovannisian, Georges Sabagh|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an Arabic word meaning "obstacle", "hindrance", "separation",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Islam|year=1960|pages=1071–1072}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or "barrier".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ali|first=Abdullah Yusuf|title=The Qu'ran|publisher=Tahrike Tarsile Qu'ran, Inc|location=Elmhurst, NY. Sur 23: 99-100}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Islamic eschatology]], although largely up to interpretation, ''al-Barzakh'' is generally viewed as the barrier between the physical and spiritual worlds. Barzakh designates a place between [[Jahannam|hell]] and [[Jannah|heaven]], where the soul resides after death, and experiences his own heaven or hell, until the resurrection on ''[[Qiyamah]]'' ([[Last Judgement|Judgement Day]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sayyid Moustafa Al-Qazwini ''Discovering Islam'' Lulu Press 2014 {{ISBN|978-1-312-63111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barzakh may, according to [[Ghazali]], also be the place for those, who go neither to hell or to heaven, resembling to the [[Christian]] concept of [[limbo]].&lt;ref&gt;BRILL ''Islam and Rationality: The Impact of al-Ghazālī. Papers Collected on His 900th Anniversary, Band 1'' {{ISBN|978-9-004-29095-2}} page 100&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The Arabic word ''barzakh'' is derived from the Persian ''barzakh'', "barrier, partition", which is in its turn traced back to the combination ''bar+zax(v)'' ("high existence"), similar to the Persian word for hell, ''dūzakh'' &lt; ''dūžax(v)'' ("evil existence").&lt;ref name=presence/&gt;

== Sources in Quran and hadith ==

Mentioned only three times in the [[Quran]], and just once specifically as the barrier between the corporeal and ethereal, Barzakh is portrayed as a place in which, after death, the spirit is separated from the body – freed to contemplate the wrongdoing of its former life. Despite the gain of recognizance, it cannot utilize action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ali|first=Abdullah Yusuf|title=The Qur'an|publisher=Tahrike Tarsile Qur'an, Inc|location=Elmhurst, NY. Sur 23: 99-100}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The other two occurrences refer to Barzakh as an impenetrable barrier between fresh and salt water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ali|first=Abdullah Yusuf|title=The Qur'an|publisher=Tahrike Tarsile Qur'an, Inc|location=Elmhurst, NY. Sur 25: 53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ali|first=Abdullah Yusuf|title=The Qur'an|publisher=Tahrike Tarsile Qur'an, Inc|location=Elmhurst, NY. Sur 55: 19-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; While fresh and salt water may intermingle, an ocean remains distinct from a river.

In Hadith, Ibn al-Qayyim cites that, albeit not mentioned in the Quran, souls in Al-Barzakh would be grouped with others matching in purity or impurity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=al-Qayyim|first=Ibn|title=Section 63. Burial|url=http://hadithcollection.com/fiqh-ussunnah/386-Fiqh-us%20Sunnah%20Section%2063.%20Burial/21458-fiqh-us-sunnah-volume-004-funerals-and-dhikr-fiqh-4095.html|work=Fiqh-us Sunnah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance of body and soul separation ==

In [[Islam]], the soul and the body are independent of each other. This is significant in Barzakh, because only a person's soul goes to Barzakh and not their physical body.&lt;ref name="Part 12"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khan|first=Sir Muhammad|title=The Philosophy of the Teachings of Islam- Part12|journal=The Review of Religions|date=December 2011|url=http://www.reviewofreligions.org/5307/the-philosophy-of-the-teachings-of-islam-part-12/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since one's soul is divorced from their body in Barzakh, the belief is that no progress or improvements to one's past life can be made.&lt;ref name="Part 12" /&gt; If a person experienced a life of sin and worldly pleasures, one cannot try to perform good deeds in order to reach ''[[Jannah]]''. Whatever one does in his or her lifetime is final and cannot be changed or altered in Barzakh.

==Barzakh and Christian purgatory==

The idea of [[purgatory]] is that it is a place where people go after death that holds punishment and purification for those who are not fit to enter Paradise just yet. People who are in this place do not have enough sins to warrant their entrance into Hell, but they do not have enough good deeds to go to Paradise. This is a temporary place, similar to barzakh.&lt;ref name=Gale&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Jane I.|title=Afterlife: An Overview|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;inPS=true&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;userGroupName=nysl_ce_colgul&amp;tabID=T003&amp;searchId=R1&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;contentSegment=&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=2&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX3424500061&amp;&amp;docId=GALE{{!}}CX3424500061&amp;docType=GALE|work=Encyclopedia of Religion|publisher=GaleGroup Online|accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because they have this in common, some believe that they are the same idea or concept.&lt;ref name=Moussa&gt;{{cite journal|last=Qader|first=Nasrin|title=Fictional Testimonies or Testimonial Fictions: Moussa Ould Ebnou's Barzakh|journal=Research in African Literatures|date=Fall 2002|volume=33|issue=3|pages=14–31|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/ral/summary/v033/33.3qader.html|accessdate=28 November 2012|doi=10.1353/ral.2002.0088}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barzakh is actually closer to the idea of [[limbo]], a place that is between life and the true afterlife.&lt;ref name=Moussa /&gt;  In this place, people await their final judgment, much like in barzakh. The Quranic idea of [[Araf (Islam)|aʿrāf]] (“the heights”) is closer to that of Christian purgatory. Aʿrāf is also thought of as a place where souls go whose good and bad deeds are too evenly matched to go directly to Paradise or the Fire.&lt;ref name=Gale /&gt;

== Interpretations ==

=== Mainstream discourse ===
Some [[Muslim]] scholars stress the importance of Barzakh, while others simply ignore it. 
* Modern Muslim thinkers de-emphasize Barzakh, and focus instead on a person's individual life and the [[Day of Judgment]]. In this view, the state of Barzakh is simply looked past and skipped once a person dies.&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Barzakh, al-|work=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Muslim scholars who do believe in Barzakh still have varying interpretations of this intermediate state based on different traditions.  Some traditions suggest that a person's deeds in their life will affect their experience in Barzakh. In these traditions, there are two states of Barzakh. In the state known as "Azhlaabul-Qabr," a person will be punished for his or her deeds in their past life.&lt;ref name="Two states"&gt;{{cite web|last=Islam|first=Maulana|title=Al Barzakh - The Realm After Death in Islam|url=http://www.islamicinformation.net/2008/06/al-barzakh-realm-after-death-in-islam.html|work=IslamicInformation.net|accessdate=June 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the other state known as "Tan'eemu Ahlit-Taa'ah Fil Qabr," a person will receive the blessings and bounties of Allah because of his or her faith and good deeds.&lt;ref name="Two states" /&gt;  Other traditions suggest that people in Barzakh are given temporary bodies.  In this view, a person is either given a bright body or a dark body.  These bodies are believed to be prepared from either the light or darkness of their deeds.&lt;ref name="Part 12" /&gt;  If a person is given a bright body then this indicates that a person will go to heaven, while a dark body represents hell.&lt;ref name="Part 12" /&gt;   In these traditions, Muslim scholars believe that once a person is given their body in Barzakh, they will already know their fate for the Day of Judgment.  It is worth noting that in these traditions where Muslim scholars believe in Barzakh, they are basically saying that a person will be familiar with his or her fate prior to the Day of Judgment. This is based on what a person experiences in this intermediate state.
* [[Al-Ghazali|Al-Ghazālī]] states, "After the First Blast, all created beings shall abide for forty (it is unknown if it is a year or month or etc.) in the Intermediate Realm [barzakh]. Then shall God quicken Seraphiel, and command him to deliver the Second Blast, as He has said (Exalted is He!): ''Then shall it be blown again, and lo! they stand, beholding'' : they shall be on their feet, watching the Resurrection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ghazali|first=Al-|title=The Remembrance of Death and the Afterlife|year=1989|publisher=The Islamic Text Society|pages=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Al-Zamakhshari]] explains Barzakh to mean hā'il, "an obstacle." His adaptation of the meaning of the word coincides with mentions of Barzakh in Quran literature: 25:53.
* [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]] referred to a Barzakh state as a "quiescent state." The soul lies in a resting state until [[Yawm al-Qiyāmah]].

=== Sufism ===

In [[Sufism]] the Barzakh or ''Alam-e-Araf'' is not only where the human soul resides after death but it is also a place that the soul can visit during sleep and meditation. [[Ibn 'Arabi]], defines Barzakh as the intermediate realm or "isthmus". It is between the World of Corporeal Bodies and the [[Alam al Jabarut|World of Spirits]], and is a means of contact between the two worlds. Without it, there would be no contact between the two and both would cease to exist. It is described as simple and luminous, like the World of Spirits, but also able to take on many different forms just like the World of Corporeal Bodies can. In broader terms Barzakh, “is anything that separates two things”. It has been described as the dream world in which the dreamer is in both life and death.&lt;ref name="Ibn Al-Arabi 2006 29n,50n, 59,64–8, 73,75–8, 82, 102"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ibn Al-Arabi|first=Muhyiddin|title=The Universal Tree and The Four Birds|year=2006|publisher=Anqa Publishing|pages=29n,50n, 59, 64–8, 73, 75–8, 82, 102|editor=Angela Jaffray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barzakh can also refer to a person. Chronologically between [[Jesus]] and [[Mohammad]] is the contested Prophet Khalid. Ibn 'Arabi considers this man to be a “Barzakh” or the Perfect Human Being. Chittick explains that the Perfect Human acts as the ''Barzakh'' or "isthmus" between God and the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chittick|first=William C.|title=The Perfect Man as the Prototype of the Self in the Sufism of Jāmi|journal=Studia Islamica|year=1979|issue=49|pages=135–157|publisher=Maisonneuve &amp; Larose}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ibn 'Arabi's story of Prophet Khalid is a story of Perfect Human being.

Khalid's story is of a Prophet whose message never emerged because before he died, he told his sons to open his tomb forty days after his death to receive the message of Barzakh. The sons, however, feared they would be looked down upon for opening their dead father's tomb, therefore they decided not to exhume their father. Thus, his message was never shared. An Ottoman Scholar explained that for Khalid to give the knowledge of Barzakh he would have to travel through the different worlds and then return, but because he was not exhumed, his message was never heard. Ibn 'Arabi explains that because this mission ended in failure, it does not conflict with The Prophet [[Mohammed]]’s statement: “ am nearest of men to Jesus son of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], for there is no prophet between him and me."&lt;ref name="Ibn Al-Arabi 2006 29n,50n, 59,64–8, 73,75–8, 82, 102"/&gt;

=== Shia ===

The idea of Barzakh in Shia is significant though in a perspective and manner different from Sufism. The Prophet and Shia Imams, particularly the 6th Imam - Imam Jafar As-Sadiq, have explained through various hadiths the treatment, condition, processes, and other intricate details regarding the passage of Barzakh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ayatullah Shaheed Sayyid Abdul Husain Dastghaib|title=Barzakh is the Veil of this World|url=http://shiastudies.net/article/english/Article.php?id=163|accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Shia theology, there are 7 checkpoints in Barzakh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shirazie|first1=Ayatullah Sayyid Abdul Husayn Dastghaib|title=The Hereafter|url=http://www.al-islam.org/the-hereafter-maad-ayatullah-dastaghaib-shirazi|website=Al-Islam.org|publisher=Ansariyan Publications|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first being kindness/trust/wilayah. Second is salaat. Third is zakaat/khums. Fourth is fasting. Fifth is hajj. Sixth is cleanliness. Seventh is rights. It is believed that the terms and conditions to understand Barzakh are limited in scope and full comprehension because it is Shia's belief that it is incomprehensible, to a certain degree, until one actually reaches the realm beyond our physical world. A common analogy used is that of a baby in the womb. Just as the baby cannot possibly begin to understand the vast outside world until they experience it for themselves, we cannot hope to understand what Barzakh entails until we transition there ourselves. Though despite this obstacle, the Shia Imams, as cited through various sayings, have explained Barzakh to a significant degree as compared to other sects within&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Qummi|first1=Sheikh Abbas|title=MANAZELUL AKHERAH|url=http://www.ziyaraat.net/books/ManazilulAakhira.pdf|website=ziyaraat.net|publisher=Madinatul Ilm Islamic Centre|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam.

=== Contemporary interpretations and uses ===

The term has also found its way into more contemporary, non-religious sectors of life. At least three bands have adopted the name Barzakh, including an Indonesian Jakarta black metal band, a Tunisian Oriental metal band and Naqash Ali Shawkat band.  Additionally, Barzakh was used as the title of a 2011 documentary following citizens of a war-torn Chechan community searching for a lost friend who they believe may have transitioned from our physical world to the realm of Barzakh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barzakh|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1813175/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1|accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blondy's Dude''' (1957–1981) was an influential [[Quarter Horse]] show horse and [[sire]].

==Life==

Blondy's Dude was a 1957 [[Sorrel (horse)|sorrel]] [[stallion]] sired by Small Town Dude and out of Blondy Queen.&lt;ref name=QHR&gt;Wagoner ''Quarter Horse Reference 1974 Edition'' p. 66-67&lt;/ref&gt; His sire was a son of [[King (horse)|King P-234]] and his dam was a descendant of Plaudit.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.allbreedpedigree.com/blondys+dude Pedigree of Blondy's Dude]" ''All Breed Pedigree Database''&lt;/ref&gt;

Blondy's Dude was an [[American Quarter Horse Association]] (or AQHA) Champion and a Performance Register of Merit earner.&lt;ref name=QHR /&gt; Morgan Freeman bought him in 1961, after seeing him at a [[reining]] competition as well as at an informal [[Cutting (sport)|cutting]]. The horse earned 45 [[Halter (horse show)|Halter]] points as well as four cutting and eight reining points with the AQHA. Morgan's son Jerald said that Blondy's Dude was very much a people horse, that he liked to follow people around.&lt;ref name=Working2&gt;Thornton ''The Working Lines Volume II'' p. 85-91]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Blondy's Dude's famous offspring were Mighty Blonde, Small Town Babe, Dude's Ann, Okie Star Dude, Hy Fashion Blond, and Dude's Baby Doll.&lt;ref name=Pitzer&gt;Pitzer ''The Most Influential Quarter horse Sires'' p. 15-16&lt;/ref&gt; Among his famous grandget was [[Diamonds Sparkle]].&lt;ref&gt;Close ''Legends 4'' p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; His offspring earned twenty-five AQHA Championships, along with Superior Performance horse awards and many Performance Register of Merits.&lt;ref name=QHR/&gt; Three of his foals earned year end High Point Awards with the AQHA, and one was a multiple times World Champion at the Youth World Show.&lt;ref name=Pitzer/&gt; His offspring excelled in many different disciplines, having earned Superior Performance awards in [[Western pleasure|Western Pleasure]], [[Reining]], [[Barrel racing|Barrel Racing]], [[Hunt Seat|Hunter Under Saddle]], Trail, [[Team Roping|Roping]], and [[Pole bending|Pole Bending]].&lt;ref name=Pitzer/&gt;

Blondy's Dude was inducted into the [[American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame|AQHA Hall of Fame]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Blondy's Dude |url=https://www.aqha.com/museum/hall-of-fame/horses/b/blondys-dude/ |work= AQHA Hall of Fame |author=American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) |publisher=American Quarter Horse Association |accessdate=August 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aqha.com/museum/pages/about/hall-of-fame/|title=Hall of Fame Inductees |work= AQHA Hall of Fame |author=American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) |publisher=American Quarter Horse Association |accessdate=August 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 1981 and was buried in Morgan Freeman's front yard in the town of [[Skiatook, Oklahoma]] with a marker stating "God gives his best to those that leave the choice to him. Owned and Loved by Morgan Freeman."&lt;ref name=LastRites&gt;Wohlfarth "Last Rites" ''Quarter Horse Journal'' p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''blood substitute''' (also called '''artificial blood''' or '''blood surrogate''') is a substance used to mimic and fulfill some functions of [[biology|biological]] [[blood]]. It aims to provide an alternative to [[blood transfusion]], which is transferring blood or [[blood-based product]]s from one person into another. Thus far, there are no well-accepted ''oxygen-carrying'' blood substitutes, which is the typical objective of a [[red blood cell]] transfusion; however, there are widely available non-blood [[volume expander]]s for cases where only volume restoration is required. These are helping doctors and surgeons avoid the risks of disease transmission and immune suppression, address the chronic blood donor shortage, and address the concerns of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and others who have religious objections to receiving transfused blood.

The main categories of 'oxygen-carrying' blood substitutes being pursued are hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOC) and [[perfluorocarbon]]-based oxygen carriers (PFBOC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Henkel-Honke | first1 = T. | last2 = Oleck | first2 = M. | title = Artificial oxygen carriers: A current review | journal = AANA Journal | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = 205–211 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17591302 | url = http://www.aana.com/newsandjournal/Documents/henkelhanke205-211.pdf | access-date = 2016-02-09 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304185434/http://www.aana.com/newsandjournal/Documents/henkelhanke205-211.pdf | archive-date = 2016-03-04 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxygen therapeutics are in clinical trials in the [[united States|U.S.]] and [[Europe]], and [[Biopure|Hemopure]] is available in [[South Africa]].

==History==
After [[William Harvey]] discovered blood pathways in 1616, many people tried to use fluids such as beer, urine, milk, and non-human animal blood as blood substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sarkar | first1 = S. | title = Artificial Blood | doi = 10.4103/0972-5229.43685 | journal = Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 140–144 | year = 2008 | pmid =  19742251| pmc =2738310 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sir Christopher Wren]] (17th century) suggested wine and opium as blood substitute.&lt;ref name="pmid11834811"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Squires JE |title=Artificial blood |journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=295 |issue=5557 |pages=1002–5 |year=2002 |pmid=11834811 |doi=10.1126/science.1068443 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11834811}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, the development of modern transfusion medicine initiated through the work of Landsteiner and co-authors opened the possibility to understanding the general principle of blood group serology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boulton|first1=FE|title=Blood transfusion; additional historical aspects.

Restrictions in applied transfusion medicine, especially in disaster situations such as World War Two, laid the grounds for accelerated research in the field of blood substitutes.&lt;ref name="pmid12559026"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reid TJ |title=Hb-based oxygen carriers: are we there yet? |journal=[[Transfusion (journal)|Transfusion]] |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=280–7 |year=2003 |pmid=12559026 |doi= 10.1046/j.1537-2995.2003.00314.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early attempts and optimism in developing blood substitutes were very quickly confronted with significant side effects, which could not be promptly eliminated due to the level of knowledge and technology available at that time. The [[HIV#Discovery|emergence of HIV]] in the 1980s renewed impetus for development of infection-safe blood substitutes.&lt;ref name="pmid11834811"/&gt; Public concern about the safety of the blood supply was raised further by [[mad cow disease]].&lt;ref name="pmid11834811"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9971869"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goodnough LT, Brecher ME, Kanter MH, AuBuchon JP |title=Transfusion medicine.

Efforts to develop blood substitutes have been driven by a desire to replace [[blood transfusion]] in emergency situations, in places where infectious disease is endemic and the risk of [[Contaminated haemophilia blood products|contaminated blood products]] is high, where refrigeration to preserve blood may be lacking, and where it might not be possible or convenient to find [[blood type]] matches.&lt;ref name=Alayash2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alayash|first1=AI|title=Hemoglobin-Based Blood Substitutes and the Treatment of Sickle Cell Disease: More Harm than Help?|journal=Biomolecules|date=4 January 2017|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.3390/biom7010002|pmid=28054978|pmc=5372714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches==
Efforts having focused on molecules that can carry [[oxygen]], and most work has focused on recombinant [[hemoglobin]], which normally carries oxygen, and [[perfluorocarbons]] (PFC), chemical compounds which can carry and release oxygen.&lt;ref name=Alayash2017/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid10695091"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Remy B, Deby-Dupont G, Lamy M |title=Red blood cell substitutes: fluorocarbon emulsions and haemoglobin solutions |journal=[[Br. Med. Bull.]] |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=277–98 |year=1999 |pmid=10695091 |doi= 10.1258/0007142991902259|url=http://bmb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10695091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first approved oxygen-carrying blood substitute was a perfluorocarbon-based product called [[Fluosol]]-DA-20, manufactured by [[Green Cross (Japan)|Green Cross]] of Japan. It was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1989. Because of limited success, complexity of use and side effects, it was withdrawn in 1994. However, Fluosol-DA remains the only oxygen therapeutic ever fully approved by the FDA.  As of 2017 no haemoglobin-based product had been approved.&lt;ref name=Alayash2017/&gt;

===Perfluorocarbon based===
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2014}}
Perfluorochemicals are not [[water soluble]], so will not mix with blood, therefore [[emulsion]]s must be made by dispersing small drops of PFC in [[water]]. This liquid is then mixed with [[antibiotics]], [[vitamin]]s, [[nutrient]]s and [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s, producing a mixture that contains about 80 different components, and performs many of the vital functions of natural blood. PFC particles are about {{sfrac|1|40}}th the size of the diameter of a [[red blood cell]] (RBC). This small size can enable PFC particles to traverse [[capillaries]] through which no RBCs are flowing. In theory this can benefit damaged, blood-starved [[biological tissue|tissue]], which conventional red cells cannot reach. PFC solutions can carry oxygen so well that [[mammal]]s, including [[human]]s, can survive breathing liquid PFC solution, called [[liquid breathing]].

Perfluorocarbon-based blood substitutes are completely man-made; this provides advantages over blood substitutes that rely on modified haemoglobin, such as unlimited manufacturing capabilities, ability to be heat-sterilized, and PFCs' efficient oxygen delivery and carbon dioxide removal. PFCs in solution act as an intravascular oxygen carrier to temporarily augment oxygen delivery to tissues. PFCs are removed from the bloodstream within 48 hours by the body's normal clearance procedure for particles in the blood – exhalation. PFC particles in solution can carry several times more oxygen per cubic centimeter (cc) than blood, while being 40 to 50 times smaller than haemoglobin.

Fluosol was made mostly of [[perfluorodecalin]] or [[perfluorotributylamine]] suspended in an [[albumin]] emulsion. It was developed in [[Japan]] and first tested in the [[United States]] in November 1979. In order to "load" sufficient amounts of oxygen into it, people who had been given it had to breathe pure oxygen by mask or in a [[hyperbaric chamber]].&lt;ref&gt;Marieb, Elaine Nicpon. &lt;u&gt;Human Anatomy &amp; Physiology&lt;/u&gt;. 4th ed.

===Haemoglobin based===
[[Haemoglobin]] is the main component of red blood cells, comprising about 33% of the cell mass. Haemoglobin-based products are called haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs).

Unmodified cell-free haemoglobin is not useful as a blood substitute because its oxygen affinity is too high for effective tissue oxygenation, the half-life within the intravascular space that is too short to be clinically useful, it has a tendency to undergo dissociation in dimers with resultant kidney damage and toxicity, and because free haemoglobin tends to take up nitric oxide, causing vasoconstriction.&lt;ref name="pmid11834811"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Amberson|first=William|author2=Jennings J.|author3=Rhode C.|title=Clinical Experience with Hemoglobin-Saline Solutions|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|year=1949|volume=1|issue=7|pages=469–489|pmid=18104040|url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/1/7/469.long}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Clinics (Sao Paulo) |date=August 2009 |volume=64 |issue=8  |pages=803–813 |title=A Review of Blood Substitutes: Examining The History, Clinical Trial Results, and Ethics of Hemoglobin-Based Oxygen Carriers |author1=Jiin-Yu Chen |author2=Michelle Scerbo |author3=George Kramer |doi=10.1590/S1807-59322009000800016|pmc=2728196 |pmid=19690667}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NatansonJAMA2008&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Natanson C, Kern SJ, Lurie P, Banks SM, Wolfe SM |title=Cell-free hemoglobin-based blood substitutes and risk of myocardial infarction and death: a meta-analysis |journal=JAMA |volume=299 |issue=19 |pages=2304–12 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18443023 |doi=10.1001/jama.299.19.jrv80007 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to overcome this toxicity have included making [[genetically engineered]] versions, [[cross-link]]ing, [[polymerization]], and encapsulation.&lt;ref name=Alayash2017/&gt;

HemAssist, a diaspirin cross-linked haemoglobin (DCLHb) was developed by [[Baxter Healthcare]]; it was the most widely studied of the haemoglobin-based blood substitutes, used in more than a dozen animal and clinical studies.&lt;ref name="pmid12559026"/&gt;   It reached Phase III clinical trials, in which failed due to increased mortality in the trial arm, mostly due to severe vasoconstriction complications.&lt;ref name=Alayash2017/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12559026"/&gt;   The results were published in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sloan|first1=EP|last2=Koenigsberg|first2=M|last3=Weir|first3=WB|last4=Clark|first4=JM|last5=O'Connor|first5=R|last6=Olinger|first6=M|last7=Cydulka|first7=R|title=Emergency Resuscitation of Patients Enrolled in the US Diaspirin Cross-linked Hemoglobin (DCLHb) Clinical Efficacy Trial.|journal=Prehospital and disaster medicine|date=February 2015|volume=30|issue=1|pages=54–61|doi=10.1017/S1049023X14001174|pmid=25499006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemolink (Hemosol, Inc., Mississauga, Canada) was a haemoglobin solution that contained cross-linked an o-rafinose polymerised human haemoglobin,&lt;ref name=Alayash2017/&gt; which struggled after Phase II trials were halted in 2003 on safety concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zehr|first1=Leonard|title=Tests leave Hemosol in critical condition|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/tests-leave-hemosol-in-critical-condition/article1162984/|work=Globe and Mail|date=June 21, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It declared bankruptcy in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hemosol declares insolvency; shares under review by TSX|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/hemosol-declares-insolvency-shares-under-review-by-tsx-1.550185|work=CBC News|date=November 25, 2005|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemopure was developed by Biopure Corp and was a chemically stabilized, cross-linked bovine (cow) haemoglobin in a salt solution intended for human use; the company developed the same product under the trade name Oxyglobin for veterinary use in dogs.  Oxyglobin was approved in the US and Europe and was introduced to veterinary clinics and hospitals in March 1998. Hemopure was approved in South Africa but that approval was revoked and Biopure filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000511202648/http://prnewswire.com/gh/cnoc/comp/131224.html Biopure files for relief] PR Newswire, July 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Its assets were subsequently purchased by OPK Biotech.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

PolyHeme was developed over 20 years by [[Northfield Laboratories]] and began as a military project following the Vietnam War. It is human haemoglobin, extracted from red blood cells, then polymerized, then incorporated into an electrolyte solution. In April 2009, the FDA rejected Northfield's [[Biologic License Application]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FDA rejects Northfield's blood substitute|url=https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/fda-rejects-northfield-s-blood-substitute|work=FierceBiotech|date=May 1, 2009|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in June 2009, Northfield filed for bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/northfieldlaboratories/northfield-laboratories-to-liquidate-under-chapter-11-idUSBNG20947820090602|title=Northfield Laboratories to liquidate under Chapter 11|date=2 June 2009|work=Reuters|accessdate=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dextran-Haemoglobin was developed by Dextro-Sang Corp as a veterinary product, and was a conjugate of the polymer dextran with human haemoglobin.

Hemotech was developed by HemoBiotech and was a chemically modified haemoglobin.

Somatogen developed a genetically engineered and crosslinked tetramer it called Optro. It failed in a phase II trial that was published in 2014 and development was halted.&lt;ref name=Alayash2017/&gt;

A pyridoxylated Hb conjugated with [[polyoxyethylene]] was created by scientists at Ajinomoto and eventually developed by Apex Biosciences, a subsidiary of Curacyte AG; it was called "PHP" and failed in a Phase III trial published in 2014, due to increased mortality in the control arm,&lt;ref name=Alayash2017/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vincent|first1=JL|last2=Privalle|first2=CT|last3=Singer|first3=M|last4=Lorente|first4=JA|last5=Boehm|first5=E|last6=Meier-Hellmann|first6=A|last7=Darius|first7=H|last8=Ferrer|first8=R|last9=Sirvent|first9=JM|last10=Marx|first10=G|last11=DeAngelo|first11=J|title=Multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled phase III study of pyridoxalated hemoglobin polyoxyethylene in distributive shock (PHOENIX).|journal=Critical care medicine|date=January 2015|volume=43|issue=1|pages=57–64|doi=10.1097/CCM.0000000000000554|pmid=25083980}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to Curacyte shutting down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Curacyte|url=http://www.curacyte.eu/|publisher=Curacyte|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Hemospan was developed by Sangart, and was a [[PEGylation|pegylated]] haemoglobin provided in a powdered form. While early trials were promising Sangart ran out of funding and closed down.&lt;ref name=Alayash2017/&gt;

===Stem cells===
[[Stem cell]]s offer a possible means of producing transfusable blood. A study performed by Giarratana et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rousseau GF, Giarratana MC, Douay L | date = Jan 2014 | title = Large-scale production of red blood cells from stem cells: what are the technical challenges ahead? | url = | journal = Biotechnol. J. | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 28–38 | doi = 10.1002/biot.201200368 }}&lt;/ref&gt; describes a large-scale ex-vivo production of mature human blood cells using [[hematopoietic stem cell]]s. The cultured cells possessed the same haemoglobin content and morphology as native red blood cells. The authors contend that the cells had a near-normal lifespan, when compared to natural red blood cells.

Scientists from the experimental arm of the [[United States Department of Defense]] began creating artificial blood for use in remote areas and transfuse blood to wounded soldiers more quickly in 2010.&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;Edwards, L. (July 13, 2010). [http://www.physorg.com/news198221258.html Artificial blood developed for the battlefield]. Retrieved November 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The blood is made from the [[hematopoietic]] stem cells removed from [[umbilical cord]] between the mother and fetus of humans after birth using a method called blood pharming. Pharming has been used in the past on animals and plants to create medical substances in large quantities. Each cord can produce approximately 20 units of blood or three blood transfusions. The blood is being produced for the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] by Arteriocyte. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] has examined and approved the safety of this blood from previously submitted O-negative blood. Using this particular artificial blood will reduce the costs per unit of blood from $5,000 to equal or less than $1,000.&lt;ref name="Edwards" /&gt; This blood will also serve as a blood donor to all [[blood types]]. Pharmed blood may be used in human trials in 2013.

'''Bruno Bianchi''' ({{IPA-it|ˈbruːno ˈbjaŋki}}, 1955 – 2 December 2011) was a French [[cartoonist]] and animation director. Bianchi worked extensively as an artist, director and producer on animated television productions; including ''[[Heathcliff (1984 TV series)|Heathcliff]]'', ''[[Iznogoud]]'' and most notably, ''[[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Inspector Gadget]]'', which he also co-created.&lt;ref name=cartoonbrew&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris|last=Arrant|title=French Animator Bruno Bianchi ("Inspector Gadget") Passes Away |url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/biz/french-animator-bruno-bianchi-inspector-gadget-passes-away.html |work=[[Cartoon Brew]] |publisher= |date=2 December 2011 |accessdate=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=animag&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=French TV Animator Bruno Bianchi Passes Away |url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/people/french-tv-animator-bruno-bianchi-passes-away/ |work=[[Animation Magazine]] |publisher= |date=2 December 2011 |accessdate=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bianchi started his career at DiC Audiovisuel (later [[DiC Entertainment]]) in 1977 as a cel painter, then gradually assumed creative positions. His first director's credit was on the 1980 edutainment mini-series ''[[Archibald le Magi-chien|Archibald le Magichien]]'' (directly translated: ''Archibald the Magic Dog''). In 1983, Bianchi scored his first major directing job on ''[[Inspector Gadget]]'', a series he co-created with [[Andy Heyward]] and DiC's founder [[Jean Chalopin]].&lt;ref name=lemonde/&gt; Bianchi served as main character designer and supervising director on the show, which became one of the most iconic series produced by DiC.

Subsequently, Bianchi worked as a director, producer and designer on numerous other [[DiC Entertainment]], [[Saban Entertainment]] and [[SIP Animation]] television animation productions from the 1980s until the mid-2000s. His credits include ''[[Heathcliff (1984 TV series)|Heathcliff]]'' (where he co-created the ''Cats and Company'' characters together with Jean Chalopin), ''[[Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors]]'', ''[[M.A.S.K. (TV series)|M.A.S.K.]]'', ''[[Rainbow Brite (1984 TV series)|Rainbow Brite]]'', ''[[Diplodos]]'' (which he co-created and co-wrote with Jean Chalopin), ''[[Iznogoud]]'', ''[[Princess Sissi (1997 TV series)|Princess Sissi]]'' and ''[[Gadget &amp; the Gadgetinis]]'' (a spinoff of ''Inspector Gadget'').&lt;ref name=animag/&gt;

In 2008, following the closure of SIP Animation, Bianchi founded his own studio, Ginkgo Animation.&lt;ref name=animag/&gt; One of Ginkgo's projects had been ''George and Me'' (French title ''Georges et Moi''),&lt;ref name=Maroin_Eluasti /&gt; an adaptation of a 2006 [[Soleil Productions]] comic series that had first been picked up by SIP Animation as early as December 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animation-france.fr/newsletter/13/|title=des NEWS de l'anim - N°13|website=www.animation-france.fr|accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had been planned to start production at SIP at the beginning of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2008/06/01/upnext-20080601/|title=UpNext-What’s developing in kids production|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by April 2011 this venture of Ginkgo's was considered unsuccessful due to changing priorities in the French animation industry,&lt;ref name=Maroin_Eluasti&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maroin.canalblog.com/archives/2011/04/01/20787613.html|title=Georges et moi, le projet de série télé par ginkgo-animation - Maroin Eluasti.マロワン・エリュアスティ|date=1 April 2011|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to one of the authors of the original comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.fr/dp/2849465437|title=Georges et moi, Tome 1 : Bubble-gum et croquettes|first1=résultats de|last1=recherche|first2=résultats de|last2=recherche|date=17 August 2006|publisher=Soleil Productions|accessdate=23 October 2018|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|the form of asexual reproduction|other uses|Budding (disambiguation)}}
[[File:S cerevisiae under DIC microscopy.jpg|thumb|''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' reproducing by budding]]
'''Budding''' is a type of [[asexual reproduction]] in which a new organism develops from an outgrowth or bud due to cell division at one particular site. The small bulb like projection coming out from the yeast cell is called a bud. The new organism remains attached as it grows, separating from the parent organism only when it is mature, leaving behind scar tissue. Since the reproduction is asexual, the newly created organism is a clone and is genetically identical to the parent organism.

Organisms such as [[Hydra (genus)|hydra]] use regenerative cells for reproduction in the process of budding.
In hydra, a bud develops as an outgrowth due to repeated cell division at one specific site. These buds develop into tiny individuals and, when fully mature, detach from the parent body and become new independent individuals.

Internal budding or endodyogeny is a process of asexual reproduction, favoured by parasites such as ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]''. It involves an unusual process in which two daughter cells are produced inside a mother cell, which is then consumed by the offspring prior to their separation.&lt;ref name=smyth&gt;{{cite book |author=James Desmond Smyth, Derek Wakelin |title=Introduction to animal parasitology |year=1994 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=101–102 |edition=3 |isbn=0-521-42811-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Endopolygeny is the division into several organisms at once by internal budding.&lt;ref name=smyth /&gt;

==Cellular reproduction==
Some cells [[cell division|divide]] asymmetrically by budding, for example ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', the yeast species used in baking and brewing. This process results in a 'mother' cell and a smaller 'daughter' cell. Cryo-electron tomography recently revealed that mitochondria in cells divide by budding.

==Animal reproduction==
[[File:Hydra_oligactis.jpg|thumb |[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]] with two buds]]
[[File:Hydra Budding.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' budding:&lt;br&gt;

1. Non-reproducing&lt;br&gt;

2. Creating a bud&lt;br&gt;

3. Daughter growing out&lt;br&gt;

4. Beginning to cleave&lt;br&gt;

5. Daughter broken off&lt;br&gt;

6. Daughter [[Clone (cell biology)|clone]] of parent]]
In some multicellular [[animal]]s, offspring may develop as outgrowths of the mother. Animals that reproduce by budding include [[coral]]s, some [[sponge]]s, some acoel flatworms (e.g., ''[[Convolutriloba]]''), and [[echinoderm#Asexual reproduction|echinoderm]] larvae.

==Colony division==
Colonies of some bee species have also exhibited budding behavior, such as ''[[Apis dorsata]]''. Although budding behavior is rare in this bee species, it has been observed when a group of workers leave the natal nest and construct a new nest usually near the natal one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oldroyd|first1=B.P.|title=Colony relatedness in aggregations of ''Apis dorsata'' Fabricius (Hymenoptera, Apidae)|journal=Insectes Sociaux|volume=47|issue=47|pages=94–95|doi=10.1007/s000400050015 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Virology==
In [[virology]], ''budding'' is a form of [[viral shedding]] by which enveloped [[virus]]es acquire their external [[viral envelope|envelope]] from the host [[cell membrane]], which bulges outwards and encloses the [[virus#Structure|virion]].

==Plant multiplication==
{{See also|Shield budding|Vegetative reproduction}}
In [[agriculture]] and [[horticulture]], budding refers to [[grafting]] the bud of one plant onto another.

'''''Carpinus putoensis''''' ('''Putuo hornbeam''', {{zh|c=普陀鹅耳枥}}) is a species of [[plant]] in the [[Corylaceae]] family. It is a small tree, up to {{convert|15|m}} tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=601&amp;taxon_id=200006196 |title=''Carpinus putoensis'' |author=eFloras |work=Flora of China |publisher=Missouri Botanical Garden, St. Louis, MO &amp; Harvard University Herbaria, Cambridge, MA |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[Zhoushan]] archipelago in [[China]] where it survives as a single tree on [[Putuoshan|Putuo Island]]. It is [[monoecious]], thereby in principle still able to reproduce sexually in the wild.&lt;ref name=IUCN&gt;{{IUCN| id = 32303| taxon = ''Carpinus putoensis''| assessor = World Conservation Monitoring Centre| assessment_year = 1998| version = 2011.2| accessdate = 11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Edward O.

'''''Casshan: Robot Hunter''''', known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Robot Hunter Casshern'''''|ロボット・ハンター・キャシャーン|Robotto Hantā Kyashān}} or simply {{nihongo|'''''Casshern'''''|キャシャーン|Kyashān|romanized as '''''Casshan''''' in the official logo}}, is an [[original video animation]] (OVA) series that was directed by Hiroyuki Fukushima, produced by [[Tatsunoko Productions|Tatsunoko]] and [[Gainax]], and animated by [[Artmic]]. The OVA was later adapted into an English-language dubbed film that was directed by Carl Macek. This series is based on Tatsunoko Productions' 1973 [[anime]] series ''[[Neo-Human Casshern]]''.

==Premise==
Enslaved by an army of rebellious super-robots originally designed to help civilization avert a complete ecological cataclysm, mankind's only hope is Casshan, a legendary hero who wages a solitary war to defeat the NEOROIDS and restore the Earth to its rightful order. Casshan's father is the scientist who engineered the race of super androids now threatening to destroy all of mankind. On a crusade to save humankind and clear his father's name, Casshan must sacrifice his own humanity in order to attain the powers he needs. Haunted by the memories of his murdered mother and forced to deal with a super robot that has absorbed the consciousness of his father, Casshan must put aside his own emotions and fight to preserve the survival of the human race.&lt;ref name="Tatsunoko"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tatsunoko.co.jp/works/archive/ova_casharn.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703225049/http://www.tatsunoko.co.jp/works/archive/ova_casharn.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-07-03 |title=作品データベース |date=2009-07-03 |accessdate=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2016}}
''Casshan: Robot Hunter'' was originally released as a four-volume series in Japan between August 21, 1993 and February 21, 1994. The American publisher [[Harmony Gold USA]] edited the four episodes into a single feature film for its English-language debut in 1995. In 2003, [[ADV Films]] re-released the four-episode series on [[DVD]]. The title sequence for the [[OVA]] translates the [[katakana]]  "''キャシャーン''" as "''Casshan''". This was repeated in the [[United states of America|American]] adaptation by [[Harmony Gold USA|Harmony Gold]].

Meanwhile, Casshan and Luna are ambushed by robot scouts, which Casshan and Friender defeat; Casshan hacks into a scout and learns the Black King is initiating the Sigma Project to replace humans with eco-friendly androids. While struggling with what to do, Casshan's mother appears to him and tells him to stop the Black King. Luna meets up with the resistance and Casshan stops them as the train crosses the bridge, but immediately regrets it.  The bomb explodes too late, but Casshan redeems himself by destroying the train and vows to never again lose his way.

Victory seems at hand but Casshan's mother warns that the Black King is biding his time. Luna tries to comfort Casshan who rebuffs her, and leaves with Friender to battle the Black King.  The Black King launches his offensive and gains control of the world's nuclear missiles. Friender sacrifices himself during a battle and Casshan is shot by a female robot commander who realizes he was more than human or machine. Casshan fights the Black King and – after the Black King claims to possess his father's soul – gathers enough strength to kill the Black King, dying himself afterwards. A failsafe shuts down all the other robots, securing human victory and a future for Luna.

In [[developmental biology]], '''cellular  differentiation''' is the process where a [[cell (biology)|cell]] changes from one [[cell type]] to another.&lt;ref&gt;Slack, J.M.W. (2013) Essential Developmental Biology. Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Slack | first1 = J.M.W. | year = 2007 | title = Metaplasia and transdifferentiation: from pure biology to the clinic | url = | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 5| pages = 369–378 | doi=10.1038/nrm2146 | pmid=17377526}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly the cell changes to a more specialized type. Differentiation occurs numerous times during the development of a [[multicellular organism]] as it changes from a simple [[zygote]] to a complex system of [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] and cell types.  Differentiation continues in adulthood as [[adult stem cell]]s divide and create fully differentiated [[Cell division|daughter cells]] during tissue repair and during normal cell turnover.  Some differentiation occurs in response to [[antigen]] exposure. Differentiation dramatically changes a cell's size, shape, [[membrane potential]], [[metabolism|metabolic activity]], and responsiveness to signals.  These changes are largely due to highly controlled modifications in [[gene expression]] and are the study of [[epigenetics]].  With a few exceptions, cellular differentiation almost never involves a change in the [[DNA]] sequence itself.  Thus, different cells can have very different physical characteristics despite having the same [[genome]].

A specialized type of differentiation, known as 'terminal differentiation', is of importance in some tissues, for example vertebrate nervous system, striated muscle, epidermis and gut. During terminal differentiation a precursor cell formerly capable of cell division, permanently leaves the cell cycle, dismantles the cell cycle machinery and often expresses a range of genes characteristic of the cell's final function (e.g. myosin and actin for a muscle cell).  Differentiation may continue to occur after terminal differentiation if the capacity and functions of the cell undergo further changes.

Among dividing cells, there are multiple levels of [[cell potency]], the cell's ability to differentiate into other cell types. A greater potency indicates a larger number of cell types that can be derived. A cell that can differentiate into all cell types, including the placental tissue, is known as ''[[totipotent]]''.  In mammals, only the zygote and subsequent [[blastomere]]s are totipotent, while in plants many differentiated cells can become totipotent with simple laboratory techniques. A cell that can differentiate into all cell types of the adult organism is known as ''[[pluripotent]]''.  Such cells are called [[meristem|meristematic cells]] in higher plants and [[embryonic stem cell]]s in animals, though some groups report the presence of adult pluripotent cells. Virally induced expression of four transcription factors [[Oct4]], [[Sox2]], [[c-Myc]], and [[KIF4]] ([[Yamanaka factors]]) is sufficient to create pluripotent (iPS) cells from adult fibroblasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 16904174|year= 2006|author1= Takahashi|first1= K|title= Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors|journal= Cell|volume= 126|issue= 4|pages= 663–76|last2= Yamanaka|first2= S|doi= 10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[multipotent]] cell is one that can differentiate into multiple different, but closely related cell types.&lt;ref name=Schoeler&gt;{{cite book |title=Humanbiotechnology as Social Challenge |editor1=Nikolaus Knoepffler |editor2=Dagmar Schipanski |editor3=Stefan Lorenz Sorgner |page=28 |chapter=The Potential of Stem Cells: An Inventory |author=Schöler, Hans R. |publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7546-5755-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cell potency#Oligopotent|Oligopotent cells]] are more restricted than multipotent, but can still differentiate into a few closely related cell types.&lt;ref name=Schoeler/&gt; Finally, [[unipotent]] cells can differentiate into only one cell type, but are capable of self-renewal.&lt;ref name=Schoeler/&gt;  In [[cytopathology]], the level of cellular differentiation is used as a measure of [[cancer]] progression.

==Mammalian cell types==
{{see also|List of distinct cell types in the adult human body}}

Three basic categories of cells make up the mammalian body: [[germ cell]]s, [[somatic cell]]s, and [[stem cell]]s. Each of the approximately 37.2 trillion (3.72x10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;) cells in an adult human has its own copy or copies of the [[genome]] except certain cell types, such as [[red blood cell]]s, that lack nuclei in their fully differentiated state. Most cells are [[diploid]]; they have two copies of each [[chromosome]]. Such cells, called somatic cells, make up most of the human body, such as skin and muscle cells. Cells differentiate to specialize for different functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Molecular Cell Biology|last = Lodish|first = Harvey|publisher = New York: W. H. Freeman|year = 2000|isbn = 0-7167-3136-3|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21618/|edition = 4th|at = Section 14.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germ line cells are any line of cells that give rise to [[gametes]]&amp;mdash;eggs and sperm&amp;mdash;and thus are continuous through the generations. Stem cells, on the other hand, have the ability to divide for indefinite periods and to give rise to specialized cells. They are best described in the context of normal human development.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} 
            
Development begins when a [[sperm]] fertilizes an [[egg (biology)|egg]] and creates a single cell that has the potential to form an entire organism. In the first hours after fertilization, this cell divides into identical cells. In humans, approximately four days after fertilization and after several cycles of cell division, these cells begin to specialize, forming a hollow sphere of cells, called a [[blastocyst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blastocyst has an outer layer of cells, and inside this hollow sphere, there is a cluster of cells called the [[inner cell mass]]. The cells of the inner cell mass go on to form virtually all of the tissues of the human body. Although the cells of the inner cell mass can form virtually every type of cell found in the human body, they cannot form an organism. These cells are referred to as [[pluripotent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Neuroscience|last = D.

Pluripotent stem cells undergo further specialization into [[multipotent]] [[progenitor cell]]s that then give rise to functional cells. Examples of stem and progenitor cells include:{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

A pathway that is guided by the cell adhesion molecules consisting of four amino acids, [[arginine]], [[glycine]], [[asparagine]], and [[serine]], is created as the cellular blastomere [[gastrulation|differentiates]] from the single-layered [[blastula]] to the three primary [[germ layer|layers of germ cells]] in mammals, namely the [[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]] and [[endoderm]] (listed from most distal (exterior) to proximal (interior)). The ectoderm ends up forming the skin and the nervous system, the mesoderm forms the bones and muscular tissue, and the endoderm forms the internal organ tissues.

==Dedifferentiation==

Dedifferentiation, or integration is a cellular process often seen in more [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] life forms such as [[worm]]s and [[amphibian]]s in which a partially or terminally differentiated cell reverts to an earlier developmental stage, usually as part of a [[Regeneration (biology)|regenerative]] process.&lt;ref name="dediff1"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stocum DL |title=Amphibian regeneration and stem cells |journal=Curr.

Some believe dedifferentiation is an aberration of the normal development cycle that results in [[cancer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3431838 |author=Sell S |title=Cellular origin of cancer: dedifferentiation or stem cell maturation arrest? |journal=Environ.

==Mechanisms==
[[Image:Cell Differentiation.jpg|400px|thumbnail|Mechanisms of cellular differentiation.]]
Each specialized [[cell type]] in an organism [[Gene expression|expresses]] a [[subset]] of all the [[gene]]s that constitute the [[genome]] of that [[species]]. Each cell type is defined by its particular pattern of [[regulation of gene expression|regulated gene expression]]. Cell differentiation is thus a transition of a cell from one cell type to another and it involves a switch from one pattern of gene expression to another. Cellular differentiation during development can be understood as the result of a [[gene regulatory network]].  A regulatory gene and its cis-regulatory modules are nodes in a gene regulatory network; they receive input and create output elsewhere in the network.&lt;ref name=DeLeon&gt;{{cite journal

|pages=191–212}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[systems biology]] approach to developmental biology emphasizes the importance of investigating how developmental mechanisms interact to produce predictable patterns ([[morphogenesis]]). (However, an alternative view has been proposed recently. Based on [[stochastic]] gene expression, cellular differentiation is the result of a Darwinian selective process occurring among cells. In this frame, protein and gene networks are the result of cellular processes and not their cause. See: [http://www.scitopics.com/Cellular_Darwinism_stochastic_gene_expression_in_cell_differentiation_and_embryo_development.html Cellular Darwinism])

[[File:Signal transduction pathways.svg|thumb|left|240px|An overview of major signal transduction pathways.]] 
A few [[evolution]]arily conserved types of molecular processes are often involved in the cellular mechanisms that control these switches. The major types of molecular processes that control cellular differentiation involve [[cell signaling]]. Many of the signal molecules that convey information from cell to cell during the control of cellular differentiation are called [[growth factor]]s. Although the details of specific [[signal transduction]] pathways vary, these pathways often share the following general steps.  A ligand produced by one cell binds to a receptor in the extracellular region of another cell, inducing a conformational change in the receptor.  The shape of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor changes, and the receptor acquires enzymatic activity.  The receptor then catalyzes reactions that phosphorylate other proteins, activating them.  A cascade of phosphorylation reactions eventually activates a dormant transcription factor or cytoskeletal protein, thus contributing to the differentiation process in the target cell.&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;{{cite book |author=Knisely, Karen |author2=Gilbert, Scott F. |title=Developmental Biology |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland, Mass |year=2009 |page=147 |isbn=0-87893-371-9 |edition=8th }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cells and tissues can vary in competence, their ability to respond to external signals.&lt;ref name=Rudel&gt;Rudel and Sommer; The evolution of developmental mechanisms. ''Developmental Biology'' 264, 15-37, 2003 {{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/S0012-1606(03)00353-1| title = The evolution of developmental mechanisms| year = 2003| last1 = Rudel | first1 = D.| last2 = Sommer | first2 = R. J.| journal = Developmental Biology| volume = 264| pages = 15–37| pmid = 14623229| issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Signal induction refers to cascades of [[cell signaling|signaling]] events, during which a cell or tissue signals to another cell or tissue to influence its developmental fate.&lt;ref name=Rudel/&gt;  Yamamoto and Jeffery&lt;ref name=Yamamoto&gt;Yamamoto Y and WR Jeffery; Central role for the lens in cave fish eye degeneration.

Other important mechanisms fall under the category of [[asymmetric cell division]]s, divisions that give rise to daughter cells with distinct developmental fates. Asymmetric cell divisions can occur because of asymmetrically expressed maternal '''cytoplasmic determinants''' or because of signaling.&lt;ref name=Rudel/&gt; In the former mechanism, distinct daughter cells are created during [[cytokinesis]] because of an uneven distribution of regulatory molecules in the parent cell; the distinct cytoplasm that each daughter cell inherits results in a distinct pattern of differentiation for each daughter cell. A well-studied example of pattern formation by asymmetric divisions is [[Drosophila embryogenesis#Anterior-posterior axis patterning in Drosophila|body axis patterning in Drosophila]]. [[RNA]] molecules are an important type of intracellular differentiation control signal. The molecular and genetic basis of asymmetric cell divisions has also been studied in green algae of the genus ''[[Volvox]]'', a model system for studying how unicellular organisms can evolve into multicellular organisms.&lt;ref name=Rudel/&gt;  In ''Volvox carteri'', the 16 cells in the anterior hemisphere of a 32-cell embryo divide asymmetrically, each producing one large and one small daughter cell.

===Epigenetic control===
{{Main|Epigenetics in stem cell differentiation}}

Since each cell, regardless of cell type, possesses the same [[genome]], determination of cell type must occur at the level of [[gene]] expression. While the [[regulation of gene expression]] can occur through [[Cis-regulatory element|cis-]] and [[trans-regulatory element]]s including a gene's [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] and [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancers]], the problem arises as to how this expression pattern is maintained over numerous generations of [[cell division]]. As it turns out, [[epigenetic]] processes play a crucial role in regulating the decision to adopt a stem, progenitor, or mature cell fate. This section will focus primarily on [[mammalian]] [[stem cells]].

In systems biology and mathematical modeling of gene regulatory networks, cell-fate determination is predicted to exhibit certain dynamics, such as attractor-convergence (the attractor can be an equilibrium point, limit cycle or [[strange attractor]]) or oscillatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Rabajante JF, Babierra AL | title=Branching and oscillations in the epigenetic landscape of cell-fate determination | journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology | volume=117 | issue=2–3 | pages=240–9 | date=January 30, 2015 | pmid=25641423 | doi =10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2015.01.006 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079610715000073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Importance of epigenetic control====

The first question that can be asked is the extent and complexity of the role of epigenetic processes in the determination of cell fate. A clear answer to this question can be seen in the 2011 paper by Lister R, ''et al.'' &lt;ref name = "Lister"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21289626 |doi=10.1038/nature09798 |author=Lister R |title=Hotspots of aberrant epigenomic reprogramming in human induced pluripotent stem cells |journal=Nature |year=2011 |volume= 471 |issue=7336 |pages=68–73 |pmc=3100360|bibcode = 2011Natur.471...68L |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; on aberrant epigenomic programming in [[human]] [[induced pluripotent stem cells]]. As induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are thought to mimic [[embryonic stem cells]] in their pluripotent properties, few epigenetic differences should exist between them. To test this prediction, the authors conducted whole-genome profiling of [[DNA methylation]] patterns in several human embryonic stem cell (ESC), iPSC, and progenitor cell lines.

Female [[adipose]] cells, [[lung]] [[fibroblasts]], and foreskin fibroblasts were reprogrammed into induced pluripotent state with the [[OCT4]], [[SOX2]], [[KLF4]], and [[MYC]] genes. Patterns of DNA methylation in ESCs, iPSCs, somatic cells were compared. Lister R, ''et al.'' observed significant resemblance in methylation levels between embryonic and induced pluripotent cells. Around 80% of [[CpG site|CG dinucleotides]] in ESCs and iPSCs were methylated, the same was true of only 60% of CG dinucleotides in somatic cells. In addition, somatic cells possessed minimal levels of cytosine methylation in non-CG dinucleotides, while induced pluripotent cells possessed similar levels of methylation as embryonic stem cells, between 0.5 and 1.5%. Thus, consistent with their respective transcriptional activities,&lt;ref name= "Lister"/&gt; DNA methylation patterns, at least on the genomic level, are similar between ESCs and iPSCs.

However, upon examining methylation patterns more closely, the authors discovered 1175 regions of differential CG dinucleotide methylation between at least one ES or iPS cell line. By comparing these regions of differential methylation with regions of cytosine methylation in the original somatic cells, 44-49% of differentially methylated regions reflected methylation patterns of the respective progenitor somatic cells, while 51-56% of these regions were dissimilar to both the progenitor and embryonic cell lines. [[In vitro]]-induced differentiation of iPSC lines saw transmission of 88% and 46% of hyper and hypo-methylated differentially methylated regions, respectively.

Two conclusions are readily apparent from this study. First, epigenetic processes are heavily involved in cell fate determination, as seen from the similar levels of cytosine methylation between induced pluripotent and embryonic stem cells, consistent with their respective patterns of [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. Second, the mechanisms of de-differentiation (and by extension, differentiation) are very complex and cannot be easily duplicated, as seen by the significant number of differentially methylated regions between ES and iPS cell lines. Now that these two points have been established, we can examine some of the epigenetic mechanisms that are thought to regulate cellular differentiation.

====Mechanisms of epigenetic regulation====

=====[[Pioneer factor|Pioneering factors]] (Oct4, Sox2, Nanog)=====
Three transcription factors, OCT4, SOX2, and [[Homeobox protein NANOG|NANOG]] – the first two of which are used in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming, along with [[Klf4]] and [[c-Myc]] – are highly expressed in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells and are necessary for the maintenance of their [[pluripotency]].&lt;ref name = "Christophersen"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid= 20975044 |doi=10.1084/jem.20101438 |vauthors=Christophersen NS, Helin K |title=Epigenetic control of embryonic stem cell fate |journal=J Exp Med |year=2010 |volume=207 |issue=11 |pages=2287–95 |pmc= 2964577}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that they achieve this through alterations in [[chromatin]] structure, such as [[histone modification]] and DNA methylation, to restrict or permit the transcription of target genes. While highly expressed, their levels require a precise balance to maintain pluripotency, perturbation of which will promote differentiation towards different lineages based on how the gene expression levels change. Differential regulation of [[Oct-4]] and [[SOX2]] levels have been shown to precede germ layer fate selection.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 21663792|year= 2011|author1= Thomson|first1= M|title= Pluripotency factors in embryonic stem cells regulate differentiation into germ layers|journal= Cell|volume= 145|issue= 6|pages= 875–89|last2= Liu|first2= S. J.|last3= Zou|first3= L. N.|last4= Smith|first4= Z|last5= Meissner|first5= A|last6= Ramanathan|first6= S|doi= 10.1016/j.cell.2011.05.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased levels of Oct4 and decreased levels of Sox2 promote a [[Gastrulation|mesendodermal]] fate, with Oct4 actively suppressing genes associated with a neural [[neurulation|ectodermal]] fate. Similarly, Increased levels of Sox2 and decreased levels of Oct4 promote differentiation towards a neural ectodermal fate, with Sox2 inhibiting differentiation towards a mesendodermal fate. Regardless of the lineage cells differentiate down, suppression of [[Homeobox protein NANOG|NANOG]] has been identified as a necessary prerequisite for differentiation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=====Polycomb repressive complex (PRC2)=====
In the realm of [[gene silencing]], [[PRC2|Polycomb repressive complex 2]], one of two classes of the [[Polycomb-group proteins|Polycomb group]] (PcG) family of proteins, catalyzes the di- and tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me2/me3).&lt;ref name= "Christophersen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jiang"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Zhu, J.  |title=Genome-wide chromatin state transitions associated with developmental and environmental cues |journal=Cell |volume=152|issue= 3|pages=642–654 |year=2013 |pmid=23333102 |pmc=3563935 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2012.12.033|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Guenther"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20616255 |doi=10.1126/science.1193995 |vauthors=Guenther MG, Young RA |title=Repressive Transcription |journal=Science |year=2010 |volume=329 |issue=5988 |pages=150–1 |pmc=3006433|bibcode = 2010Sci...329..150G |url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/81257/1/Young_Repressive%20transcription.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; By binding to the H3K27me2/3-tagged nucleosome, PRC1 (also a complex of PcG family proteins) catalyzes the mono-ubiquitinylation of histone H2A at lysine 119 (H2AK119Ub1), blocking [[RNA polymerase II]] activity and resulting in transcriptional suppression.&lt;ref name= "Christophersen"/&gt; PcG knockout ES cells do not differentiate efficiently into the three germ layers, and deletion of the PRC1 and PRC2 genes leads to increased expression of lineage-affiliated genes and unscheduled differentiation.&lt;ref name= "Christophersen"/&gt; Presumably, PcG complexes are responsible for transcriptionally repressing differentiation and development-promoting genes.

=====Trithorax group proteins (TrxG)=====
Alternately, upon receiving differentiation signals, PcG proteins are recruited to promoters of pluripotency transcription factors. PcG-deficient ES cells can begin differentiation but cannot maintain the differentiated phenotype.&lt;ref name= "Christophersen"/&gt; Simultaneously, differentiation and development-promoting genes are activated by Trithorax group (TrxG) chromatin regulators and lose their repression.&lt;ref name= "Christophersen"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Guenther"/&gt; TrxG proteins are recruited at regions of high transcriptional activity, where they catalyze the trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 ([[H3K4me3]]) and promote gene activation through histone acetylation.&lt;ref name = "Guenther"/&gt; PcG and TrxG complexes engage in direct competition and are thought to be functionally antagonistic, creating at differentiation and development-promoting loci what is termed a "bivalent domain" and rendering these genes sensitive to rapid induction or repression.&lt;ref name = "Meissner"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20944600 |doi=10.1038/nbt.1684 |author=Meissner A |title=Epigenetic modifications in pluripotent and differentiated cells |journal=Nat Biotechnol |year= 2010 |volume=28 |issue=10 |pages=1079–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====DNA methylation=====
Regulation of gene expression is further achieved through DNA methylation, in which the [[DNA methyltransferase]]-mediated methylation of cytosine residues in CpG dinucleotides maintains heritable repression by controlling DNA accessibility.&lt;ref name = "Meissner"/&gt; The majority of CpG sites in embryonic stem cells are unmethylated and appear to be associated with H3K4me3-carrying nucleosomes.&lt;ref name= "Christophersen"/&gt; Upon differentiation, a small number of genes, including OCT4 and NANOG,&lt;ref name = "Meissner"/&gt; are methylated and their promoters repressed to prevent their further expression. Consistently, DNA methylation-deficient embryonic stem cells rapidly enter [[apoptosis]] upon in vitro differentiation.&lt;ref name= "Christophersen"/&gt;

=====Nucleosome positioning=====
While the [[nucleic acid sequence|DNA sequence]] of most cells of an organism is the same, the binding patterns of transcription factors and the corresponding gene expression patterns are different. To a large extent, differences in transcription factor binding are determined by the chromatin accessibility of their binding sites through [[histone modification]] and/or [[pioneer factor]]s. In particular, it is important to know whether a [[nucleosome]] is covering a given genomic binding site or not. This can be determined using a [[chromatin immunoprecipitation]] (ChIP) assay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bio.brandeis.edu/haberlab/jehsite/chIP.html ChIP Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;

======Histone acetylation and methylation======
DNA-nucleosome interactions are characterized by two states: either tightly bound by nucleosomes and transcriptionally inactive, called [[heterochromatin]], or loosely bound and usually, but not always, transcriptionally active, called [[euchromatin]]. The epigenetic processes of histone methylation and acetylation, and their inverses demethylation and deacetylation primarily account for these changes. The effects of acetylation and deacetylation are more predictable. An acetyl group is either added to or removed from the positively charged Lysine residues in histones by enzymes called [[histone acetyltransferase]]s or [[histone deacteylase]]s, respectively. The acetyl group prevents Lysine's association with the negatively charged DNA backbone. Methylation is not as straightforward, as neither methylation nor demethylation consistently correlate with either gene activation or repression. However, certain methylations have been repeatedly shown to either activate or repress genes. The trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone 3 (H3K4Me3) is associated with gene activation, whereas trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 represses genes&lt;ref name="pmid12667454"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krogan NJ, Dover J, Wood A, Schneider J, Heidt J, Boateng MA, Dean K, Ryan OW, Golshani A, Johnston M, Greenblatt JF, Shilatifard A | title = The Paf1 complex is required for histone H3 methylation by COMPASS and Dot1p: linking transcriptional elongation to histone methylation | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 721–9 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12667454 | doi = 10.1016/S1097-2765(03)00091-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12667453"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ng HH, Robert F, Young RA, Struhl K | title = Targeted recruitment of Set1 histone methylase by elongating Pol II provides a localized mark and memory of recent transcriptional activity | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 709–19 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12667453 | doi = 10.1016/S1097-2765(03)00092-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15680324"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernstein BE, Kamal M, Lindblad-Toh K, Bekiranov S, Bailey DK, Huebert DJ, McMahon S, Karlsson EK, Kulbokas EJ, Gingeras TR, Schreiber SL, Lander ES | title = Genomic maps and comparative analysis of histone modifications in human and mouse | journal = Cell | volume = 120 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–81 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15680324 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2005.01.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

======In stem cells======
During differentiation, [[stem cell]]s change their gene expression profiles. Recent studies have implicated a role for nucleosome positioning and histone modifications during this process.&lt;ref name = "Teif_et_al"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=23085715 | doi=10.1038/nsmb.2419 |vauthors=Teif VB, Vainshtein Y, Caudron-Herger M, Mallm JP, Marth C, Höfer T, Rippe K |title= Genome-wide nucleosome positioning during embryonic stem cell development |journal=Nat Struct Mol Biol  |year= 2012 | volume=19 |issue=11 |pages=1185–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two components of this process: turning off the expression of embryonic stem cell (ESC) genes, and the activation of cell fate genes. Lysine specific demethylase 1 ([[LSD1|KDM1A]]) is thought to prevent the use of [[enhancer (genetics)|enhancer]] regions of pluripotency genes, thereby inhibiting their transcription.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 22297846|pmc= 4144424|year= 2012|author1= Whyte|first1= W. A.|title= Enhancer decommissioning by LSD1 during embryonic stem cell differentiation|journal= Nature|volume= 482|issue= 7384|pages= 221–5|last2= Bilodeau|first2= S|last3= Orlando|first3= D.

====Role of signaling in epigenetic control====

A final question to ask concerns the role of [[cell signaling]] in influencing the epigenetic processes governing differentiation. Such a role should exist, as it would be reasonable to think that extrinsic signaling can lead to epigenetic remodeling, just as it can lead to changes in gene expression through the activation or repression of different transcription factors. Little direct data is available concerning the specific signals that influence the [[epigenome]], and the majority of current knowledge about the subject consists of speculations on plausible candidate regulators of epigenetic remodeling.&lt;ref name = "Mohammad"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20944593 |doi=10.1038/nbt1010-1033 |vauthors=Mohammad HP, Baylin SB |title=Linking cell signaling and the epigenetic machinery |journal=Nat Biotechnol |year=2010 |volume=28 |issue=10 |pages=1033–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; We will first discuss several major candidates thought to be involved in the induction and maintenance of both embryonic stem cells and their differentiated progeny, and then turn to one example of specific signaling pathways in which more direct evidence exists for its role in epigenetic change.

The first major candidate is [[Wnt signaling pathway]]. The Wnt pathway is involved in all stages of differentiation, and the ligand Wnt3a can substitute for the overexpression of c-Myc in the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells.&lt;ref name = "Mohammad"/&gt; On the other hand, disruption of [[Beta-catenin|ß-catenin]], a component of the Wnt signaling pathway, leads to decreased proliferation of neural progenitors.

[[Growth factors]] comprise the second major set of candidates of epigenetic regulators of cellular differentiation. These morphogens are crucial for development, and include [[bone morphogenetic proteins]], [[transforming growth factors]] (TGFs), and [[fibroblast growth factors]] (FGFs). TGFs and FGFs have been shown to sustain expression of OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG by downstream signaling to [[SMAD (protein)|Smad]] proteins.&lt;ref name = "Mohammad"/&gt; Depletion of growth factors promotes the differentiation of ESCs, while genes with bivalent chromatin can become either more restrictive or permissive in their transcription.&lt;ref name = "Mohammad"/&gt;

Several other signaling pathways are also considered to be primary candidates. Cytokine [[leukemia inhibitory factor]]s are associated with the maintenance of mouse ESCs in an undifferentiated state. This is achieved through its activation of the Jak-STAT3 pathway, which has been shown to be necessary and sufficient towards maintaining mouse ESC pluripotency.&lt;ref name = "Niwa"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9649508 |doi=10.1101/gad.12.13.2048 |vauthors=Niwa H, Burdon T, Chambers I, Smith A |title=Self-renewal of pluripotent embryonic stem cells is mediated via activation of STAT3 |journal=Genes Dev |year=1998 |volume=12 |issue=13 |pages=2048–60 |pmc=316954}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Retinoic acid]] can induce differentiation of human and mouse ESCs,&lt;ref name = "Mohammad"/&gt; and [[Notch signaling]] is involved in the proliferation and self-renewal of stem cells. Finally, [[Sonic hedgehog]], in addition to its role as a morphogen, promotes embryonic stem cell differentiation and the self-renewal of somatic stem cells.&lt;ref name = "Mohammad"/&gt;

The problem, of course, is that the candidacy of these signaling pathways was inferred primarily on the basis of their role in development and cellular differentiation. While epigenetic regulation is necessary for driving cellular differentiation, they are certainly not sufficient for this process. Direct modulation of gene expression through modification of transcription factors plays a key role that must be distinguished from heritable epigenetic changes that can persist even in the absence of the original environmental signals. Only a few examples of signaling pathways leading to epigenetic changes that alter cell fate currently exist, and we will focus on one of them.

Expression of Shh (Sonic hedgehog) upregulates the production of [[BMI1]], a component of the PcG complex that recognizes H3K27me3. This occurs in a Gli-dependent manner, as [[Gli1]] and [[Gli2]] are downstream effectors of the [[Hedgehog signaling pathway]]. In culture, Bmi1 mediates the Hedgehog pathway's ability to promote human mammary stem cell self-renewal.&lt;ref name = "Liu"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16778178 |pmc=4386278 |doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-0054 |author=Liu S |title=Hedgehog Signaling and Bmi-1 Regulate Self-renewal of Normal and Malignant Human Mammary Stem Cells |journal=Cancer Res |year=2006 |volume=66 |issue=12 |pages=6063–71|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both humans and mice, researchers showed Bmi1 to be highly expressed in proliferating immature cerebellar granule cell precursors. When Bmi1 was knocked out in mice, impaired cerebellar development resulted, leading to significant reductions in postnatal brain mass along with abnormalities in motor control and behavior.&lt;ref name = "Leung"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15029199 |doi=10.1038/nature02385 |author=Leung C |title=Bmi1 is essential for cerebellar development and is overexpressed in human medulloblastomas |journal=Nature |year=2004 |volume=428 |issue=6980 |pages=337–41|bibcode = 2004Natur.428..337L |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate study showed a significant decrease in neural stem cell proliferation along with increased astrocyte proliferation in Bmi null mice.&lt;ref name = "Zencak"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15958744 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3452-04.2005 |author=Zencak D |title=Bmi1 loss produces an increase in astroglial cells and a decrease in neural stem cell population and proliferation |journal=J Neurosci |year=2005 |volume=25 |issue=24 |pages=5774–83|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A alternative model of cellular differentiation during embryogenesis is that positional information is based on mechanical signalling by the cytoskeleton using [[Embryonic differentiation waves]]. The mechanical signal is then epigenetically transduced via signal transduction systems (of which specific molecules such as Wnt are part) to result in differential gene expression.

In summary, the role of signaling in the epigenetic control of cell fate in mammals is largely unknown, but distinct examples exist that indicate the likely existence of further such mechanisms.

=== Effect of matrix elasticity ===
In order to fulfill the purpose of regenerating a variety of tissues, adult stems are known to migrate from their niches, adhere to new extracellular matrices (ECM) and differentiate. The ductility of these microenvironments are unique to different tissue types. The ECM surrounding brain, muscle and bone tissues range from soft to stiff. The transduction of the stem cells into these cells types is not directed solely by chemokine cues and cell to cell signaling. The elasticity of the microenvironment can also affect the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs which originate in bone marrow.) When MSCs are placed on substrates of the same stiffness as brain, muscle and bone ECM, the MSCs take on properties of those respective cell types.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867406009615|title=Matrix Elasticity Directs Stem Cell Lineage Specification|access-date=2016-04-22|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.06.044|volume=126|issue=4|pages=677–689|journal=Cell|pmid=16923388|date=August 2006 | last1 = Engler | first1 = AJ | last2 = Sen | first2 = S | last3 = Sweeney | first3 = HL | last4 = Discher | first4 = DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Matrix sensing requires the cell to pull against the matrix at focal adhesions, which triggers a cellular mechano-transducer to generate a signal to be informed what force is needed to deform the matrix.  To determine the key players in matrix-elasticity-driven lineage specification in MSCs, different matrix microenvironments were mimicked. From these experiments, it was concluded that focal adhesions of the MSCs were the cellular mechano-transducer sensing the differences of the matrix elasticity. The non-muscle myosin IIa-c isoforms generates the forces in the cell that lead to signaling of early commitment markers. Nonmuscle myosin IIa generates the least force increasing to non-muscle myosin IIc. There are also factors in the cell that inhibit non-muscle myosin II, such as blebbistatin. This makes the cell effectively blind to the surrounding matrix.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Researchers have obtained some success in inducing stem cell-like properties in HEK 239 cells by providing a soft matrix without the use of diffusing factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guo|first=Jun|last2=Wang|first2=Yuexiu|last3=Sachs|first3=Frederick|last4=Meng|first4=Fanjie|date=2014-12-09|title=Actin stress in cell reprogramming|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/49/E5252|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=111|issue=49|pages=E5252–E5261|doi=10.1073/pnas.1411683111|issn=0027-8424|pmc=4267376|pmid=25422450|bibcode=2014PNAS..111E5252G}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stem-cell properties appear to be linked to tension in the cells' actin network. One identified mechanism for matrix-induced differentiation is tension-induced proteins, which remodel chromatin in response to mechanical stretch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guilak|first=Farshid|last2=Cohen|first2=Daniel M.|last3=Estes|first3=Bradley T.|last4=Gimble|first4=Jeffrey M.|last5=Liedtke|first5=Wolfgang|last6=Chen|first6=Christopher S.|date=2009-07-02|title=Control of Stem Cell Fate by Physical Interactions with the Extracellular Matrix|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1934590909002938|journal=Cell Stem Cell|volume=5|issue=1|pages=17–26|doi=10.1016/j.stem.2009.06.016|pmc=2768283|pmid=19570510}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RhoA pathway is also implicated in this process.

[[File:Vice President Joe Biden writing condolence message at Polish Embassy in Washington.jpg|alt=Joe Biden sits at a desk, writing in a book|thumb|Diplomatic message of condolence at an embassy]]
'''Condolences''' (from Latin ''con'' (with) + ''dolere'' (sorrow)) are an expression of sympathy to someone who is experiencing pain arising from death, deep mental anguish, or misfortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/condolence | title=condolence | publisher=Merriam-Webster | accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the word "condolences", in plural, is more common than "condolence". The reason for this habit is unclear,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;searchmode=none&amp;search=condolence etymonline.com search for "condolence"] accessed 2016-06-16&lt;/ref&gt; but it resembles our habit to send someone our 'regards', 'best wishes', greetings'  (all plural), etc.

When individuals condole, or offer their condolences to a particular situation or person, they are offering active, conscious [[Moral support|support]] of that person or activity. This is often expressed by saying, "Sorry". Often, the [[English language]] expression "My condolences" will be in a context, such as [[death]] of a friend's loved one, in which the one offering condolences is communicating a feeling of [[pity]] towards the unfortunate party. Expressions of condolence may also be used as [[sarcasm]] if one considers the complaining person to be exaggerating their suffering, especially when they appear to consider as tragic something that is relatively insignificant.

Condolence is not always expressed in sorrow or grievance, as it can also be used to acknowledge a fellow feeling or even a common opinion.

There are various ways of expressing condolences to the victims. Examples include donating money to the charity nominated by the person who has just died, writing in a condolences book or supporting the friends and family of the loved one by making meals and looking after them in various ways in times of need.

'''David Howard Murdock''' (born April 11, 1923) is an American businessman and philanthropist.

==Early career==
Murdock was born on April 11, 1923, in Kansas City, Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2V4WAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22David+Howard+Murdock%22+1923&amp;dq=%22David+Howard+Murdock%22+1923&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAGoVChMIubq9o_G2yAIVBzOICh1mPQVW]&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a traveling salesman, while his mother took up laundry and scrubbed floors to make ends meet. He is the middle child of three; he had two sisters. He was particularly close to his mother, who died at 42 from cancer.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; He grew up in [[Montgomery Township, Wood County, Ohio|Montgomery Township, Ohio]], and dropped out of high school in the 9th grade.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2000/07/13/mu4.html|title=Gates Buys Into Pineapple Paradise|date=July 13, 2000|publisher=''[[Forbes]]''|accessdate=January 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was drafted by the [[United States Army]] in 1943 during [[World War II]].

After relocating to [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] after the war, Murdock was homeless and destitute.  Due to a chance encounter with a [[good samaritan]], however, he got a $1,200 loan to buy a closing [[diner]], flipping it for a $700 profit ten months later.&lt;ref&gt;Source BBC GlobalBiz Podcast : Food for Thought 01 Feb 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[Phoenix, Arizona]], and began working there first in housing and then commercial real estate.

When the real estate market collapsed in the 1960s, he moved to [[Los Angeles]] where he continued developing real estate opportunities, leading to a string of acquisitions. In 1978 he acquired control of International Mining. In early 1980s he became the largest shareholder in L.A. based [[Occidental Petroleum]], by selling the corporation his 18% share of the [[Iowa Beef Packers]] company.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

==Businesses==
Murdock owned [[Cannon Mills]] in [[Kannapolis, North Carolina]], from 1982, after the death of Charles Cannon, until 1985, when he sold the company to [[Fieldcrest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=

In 1985 Murdock took over the nearly bankrupt Hawaiian firm [[Castle &amp; Cooke]], which owned pineapple and banana producer [[Dole Food Company]]. He developed Castle &amp; Cooke's real estate portfolio into residential and commercial properties and turned Dole into the world's largest producer of fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref name="taxdollars.ocregister"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://taxdollars.ocregister.com/2011/01/24/state-elsinore-failed-to-regulate-mines-owned-by-legendary-developer-david-murdock/72568/ | title=State: Elsinore failed to regulate mines owned by legendary developer David Murdock | publisher=The Orange County Register | date=January 24, 2011 | accessdate=August 29, 2012 | author=Knap, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acquiring Dole privately in 2003, Murdock completed a $446 million initial public offering in October 2009 and the company traded on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] under the ticker DOLE until a private merger agreement was approved October 31, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/aug/12/business/la-fi-mo-murdock-dole-sale-20130812 | title=David H.

He is believed to have been born in [[Scotland]] around 1745. In 1767, he was named [[English Language|English]] clerk for the Court of Common Pleas of Quebec and register of the [[Vice admiralty court]]. He served as a lieutenant in the militia during the [[United States|American]] invasion of Quebec in 1775-6. In 1777, he was named clerk of the peace and clerk of the crown.

In 1789, with others, he built a toll bridge over the [[Saint-Charles River]]. He was elected to the [[1st Parliament of Lower Canada]] for [[Quebec County, Quebec|Quebec County]] in 1792. In 1794, Lynd was named prothonotary and register of the court for Quebec District and, in 1795, clerk for the Court of General Sessions of the Peace. Lynd owned [[slavery|slave]]s{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} and voted against a bill in 1793 which would have abolished slavery in Lower Canada.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} He owned a number of properties near the [[Quebec City|town of Quebec]].

He died at Quebec in 1802.

He also indulged in the age old tradition of cheese wheel rolling.

The death of [[Alexander the Great]] and subsequent related events have been the subjects of debates. According to a [[Babylonian astronomical diaries|Babylonian astronomical diary]], Alexander died between the evening of June 10 and the evening of June 11, 323 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexander/alexander_t41.html|title=A contemporary account of the death of Alexander|publisher =[[Livius.org]]|accessdate=Aug 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of thirty-two. This happened in the palace of [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] in [[Babylon]].

[[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]] and local residents wept at the news of the death, while [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] subjects shaved their heads.&lt;ref name ="Freeman"&gt;{{cite book | last =Freeman| first = Philip|title = Alexander the Great| publisher = Simon and Schuster| year = 2011| page = 320| isbn =1-4165-9280-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mother of [[Darius III]], [[Sisygambis]], having learned of Alexander's death, refused sustenance and died a few days later.&lt;ref name ="Quest"&gt;{{cite book | last =Chugg| first = Andrew|title = The Quest for the Tomb of Alexander the Great | publisher = Lulu.com| year = 2007| page = 25| isbn =0-9556790-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians vary in their assessments of primary sources about Alexander's death, which results in different views.

==Background==
In February 323 BC, Alexander ordered his armies to prepare for the march to [[Babylon]].&lt;ref name ="Lendering"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexander/alexander16.html|title=Death in Babylon|publisher =[[Livius.org]]|author=[[Jona Lendering]]|accessdate=Aug 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Arrian]], after crossing the [[Tigris]] Alexander was met by [[Chaldea]]ns, who advised him not to enter the city because their deity [[Bel (mythology)|Bel]] had warned them that to do so at that time would be fatal for Alexander.&lt;ref name ="Arrian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexander/alexander_t63.html#2|title=Alexander and the Chaldaeans|publisher =[[Livius.org]]|accessdate=Aug 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chaldeans also warned Alexander against marching westwards as he would then look to the setting sun, a symbol of decline.&lt;ref name ="Arrian"/&gt; It was suggested that he entered Babylon via the Royal Gate, in the western wall, where he would face to the east. Alexander followed this advice, but the route turned to be unfavorable because of swampy terrain.&lt;ref name ="Arrian"/&gt; According to [[Jona Lendering]], "it seems that in May 323" the Babylonian [[astrology|astrologers]] tried to avert the misfortune by substituting Alexander with an ordinary person on the Babylonian throne, who would take the brunt of the omen.&lt;ref name ="Lendering"/&gt; The Greeks, however, did not understand that ritual.&lt;ref name ="Lendering"/&gt;

===Prophecy of Calanus===

[[Calanus of India|Calanus]] was likely to be a [[Hindu]] [[Naga sadhu]], whom Greeks called [[gymnosophists]]. He had accompanied the Greek army back from [[Punjab region|Punjab]], upon request by Alexander. He was seventy-three years of age at that time. However, when Persian weather and travel fatigue weakened him, he informed Alexander that he would rather die than live disabled. He decided to take away his life by [[self-immolation]]. Although Alexander tried to desist him from doing so but upon the insistence of Calanus, Alexander relented and the job of building a [[pyre]] was entrusted to [[Ptolemy (son of Seleucus)|Ptolemy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alexander the Great|year=1973|publisher=Robin Lane Fox|pages=416|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UGApAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The place where this incident took place was [[Susa]] in the year 323 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yādnāmah-ʾi Panjumīn Kungrih-ʾi Bayn al-Milalī-i Bāstānshināsī va Hunar-i Īrān|year=1972|publisher=Ministry of Culture and Arts, Iran. Vizārat-i Farhang va Hunar|pages=224|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s8ufAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Calanus is mentioned also by Alexander's admiral, [[Nearchus]] and [[Chares of Mytilene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sháhnáma of Firdausí  By Arthur George Warner, Edmond Warner|year=2001|pages=61|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CixkKv_ywoMC&amp;pg=PA61}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not flinch as he burnt to the astonishment of those who watched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Defending the West: a critique of Edward Said's Orientalism Front Cover by Ibn Warraq|year=2007|publisher=Prometheus Books|pages=108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JoJtAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy  edited by Keimpe Algra|year=1999|pages=243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9lRD6feR3hEC&amp;pg=PA243}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Before immolating himself alive on the pyre, his last words to Alexander were "We shall meet in Babylon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Philosophy  By Silvano Borruso|year=2007|pages=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wiA0NIf14ZAC&amp;pg=PA50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=My library My History Books on Google Play National Geographic, Volume 133|year=1968|pages=64|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=V71kT4nULM-mrAf8p5y9Bw&amp;id=M8YvAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=+calanus+meet+babylon#search_anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus he is said to have prophesied the death of Alexander in Babylon. At the time of the death of Calanus, Alexander, however, did not have any plan to go to Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Geographic , Volume 133|year=1968|pages=64|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=V71kT4nULM-mrAf8p5y9Bw&amp;id=M8YvAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=meet+babylon#search_anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The philosophical books of Cicero|year=1989|publisher=Duckworth|pages=186|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L1MEAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; No one understood the meaning of his words "We shall meet in Babylon". It was only after Alexander fell sick and died in Babylon, that the Greeks came to realize what Calanus intended to convey.

Proposed causes of Alexander's death included alcoholic liver disease, fever, and [[strychnine]] poisoning, but little data support those versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=15081504|title=The death of Alexander the Great: malaria or typhoid fever.|publisher =Infectious Disease Clinics of North America 2004 Mar;18(1):53-63|author=Cunha BA|doi=10.1016/S0891-5520(03)00090-4|volume=18|issue=1|date=March 2004|journal=Infect.

In the week before Alexander's death, historical accounts mention chills, sweats, exhaustion and high fever, typical [[symptom]]s of infectious diseases, including typhoid fever.&lt;ref name ="UMM"/&gt; According to David W. Oldach from the [[University of Maryland Medical Center]], Alexander also had "severe [[abdominal pain]], causing him to cry out in agony".&lt;ref name ="UMM"/&gt; The associated account, however, comes from the unreliable ''[[Alexander romance]]''. According to Andrew N. Williams and Robert Arnott, in Alexander the Great's last days he became mute. He became mute because of a previous injury to his neck from the Siege of Cyropolis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.research-db.letu.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=0&amp;sid=5da10bd1-41cf-46cf-ae69-9e9833230a4d%40sessionmgr4008|title=A Stone at the Siege of Cyropolis and the Death of Alexander the Great|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other popular theories hold that Alexander either died of malaria or was poisoned. Other [[Retrospective diagnosis|retrodiagnoses]] include noninfectious diseases as well.&lt;ref name ="CDC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol9no12/03-0288.htm#1|title=Alexander the Great and West Nile Virus Encephalitis|author1=John S.

Calisher |publisher =[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]|accessdate=Aug 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to author Andrew Chugg, there is evidence Alexander died of malaria, having contracted it two weeks before his death while sailing in the marshes to inspect flood defences.&lt;ref name ="Chugg"/&gt; Chugg based his argument on ''Ephemerides'' by otherwise unknown Diodotus of Erythrae, although the authenticity of this source has been questioned.&lt;ref name ="Chugg"/&gt; It was also noted that the absence of the signature fever curve of ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' (the expected parasite, given Alexander's travel history) diminishes the possibility of malaria.&lt;ref name ="CDC"/&gt; The malaria version was nonetheless supported by [[Paul Cartledge]].&lt;ref name ="Chugg"/&gt;

Throughout the centuries suspicions of possible poisoning have fallen on a number of alleged perpetrators, including one of Alexander's wives, his generals, his illegitimate half-brother or the royal cup-bearer.&lt;ref name ="Chugg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alexanderstomb.com/main/deathofalexander/IoS6on7Aug05b.JPG|title=Disease, not conflict, ended the reign of Alexander the Great|publisher =''[[The Independent on Sunday]]''|accessdate=Aug 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poisoning version is featured particularly in politically motivated ''Liber de Morte Testamentoque Alexandri'' (''The Book On the Death and Testament of Alexander''), which tries to discredit the family of [[Antipater]]. It was argued that the book was compiled in [[Polyperchon]]'s circle, not before c. 317 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Alexander%27s+last+days%3A+malaria+and+mind+games%3F-a0221920136|title=Alexander's last days: malaria and mind games?|publisher =''[[Acta Classica]]''|author1=John Atkinson |author2=Elsie Truter |author3=Etienne Truter |date=Jan 1, 2009|accessdate=Aug 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Alexander the Great: The Death of a God'', [[Paul C. Doherty]] claimed that Alexander was poisoned with [[arsenic]] by his possibly illegitimate half-brother [[Ptolemy I Soter]].&lt;ref name ="Chugg"/&gt; However, this was disputed by New Zealand National Poisons Centre toxicologist Dr Leo Schep who discounted arsenic poisoning and instead suggested that he could have been poisoned by a wine made from the plant ''[[Veratrum album]]'', known as white hellebore.&lt;ref name=schep&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schep LJ, Slaughter RJ, Vale JA, Wheatley P |title=Was the death of Alexander the Great due to poisoning?

The article was published in the peer-reviewed medical journal ''[[Clinical Toxicology]]'' and suggested that if Alexander was poisoned, ''Veratrum album'' offers the most plausible cause.&lt;ref name=schep/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bennett-Smith  |first=Meredith  | date= 14 January 2014 | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/13/alexander-the-great-poisoned-toxic-wine_n_4591553.html |title= Was Alexander The Great Poisoned By Toxic Wine?  | accessdate=15 January 2014| location =  | work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is backed by the writings of Ancient Greek historian, [[Diodorus]], who had recorded Alexander becoming "stricken with pain after drinking a large bowl of wine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wolfe  |first=Sarah  | date= 13 January 2014 | url = https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-01-13/alexander-great-was-killed-toxic-wine-says-scientist|title= Alexander the Great was killed by toxic wine, says scientist  | accessdate=5 March 2018| work=Public Radio International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epidemiologist John Marr and Charles Calisher put forward the [[West Nile fever]] as possible cause of Alexander's death. This version was deemed as "fairly compelling" by the [[University of Rhode Island]] epidemiologist Thomas Mather, who nonetheless noted that the West Nile virus tends to kill the elders or those with weakened [[immune systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gideononline.com/reviews/nature2003/|title=Nature-Alexander the Great|publisher =[[Global Infectious Disease Epidemiology Network|GIDEON]]|accessdate=Aug 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The version of Marr and Calisher was also criticized by Burke A. Cunha from [[Winthrop University Hospital]].&lt;ref name ="Cunha"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol10no7/04-0039_104_396_320.htm|title=Alexander the Great and West Nile Virus Encephalitis|publisher =[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]|accessdate=Aug 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to analysis of other authors in response to Marr and Calisher, the West Nile virus could not have infected humans before the 8th century AD.&lt;ref name ="Cunha"/&gt;

Other causes that have been put forward include [[acute pancreatitis]] provoked by "heavy alcohol consumption and a very rich meal",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=9252868|title=Did Alexander the Great die of acute pancreatitis?|publisher =''Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology'' 1997 Jun;24(4):294-6|author=Sbarounis CN|doi=10.1097/00004836-199706000-00031|volume=24|issue=4|date=June 1997|journal=J.

When Alexander's symptoms were entered to the [[Global Infectious Disease Epidemiology Network]], [[influenza]] gained the highest probability (41.2%) on the list of [[Differential diagnosis|differential diagnoses]].&lt;ref name ="CDC"/&gt; However, according to Cunha, the symptoms and time course of Alexander's disease are inconsistent with influenza, as well as with malaria, schistosomiasis and poisoning in particular.&lt;ref name ="Cunha"/&gt;

Another theory moves away from disease and hypothesizes that Alexander's death was related to a congenital scoliotic syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;Hutan Ashrafian, "The Death of Alexander the Great - A Spinal Twist of Fate", ''Journal of the History of the Neurosciences'', Vol. 13, 2004, pg. 138&lt;/ref&gt; It has been discussed that Alexander had structural neck deformities and oculomotor deficits,&lt;ref&gt;Hutan Ashrafian, "The Death of Alexander the Great - A Spinal Twist of Fate", ''Journal of the History of the Neurosciences'', Vol. 13, 2004, pg.139&lt;/ref&gt; and this could be associated with Klippel-Feil Syndrome, a rare congenital scoliotic disorder.&lt;ref name="Hutan Ashrafian 2004, pg. 140"&gt;Hutan Ashrafian, "The Death of Alexander the Great - A Spinal Twist of Fate", ''Journal of the History of the Neurosciences'', Vol. 13, 2004, pg. 140&lt;/ref&gt; His physical deformities and symptoms leading up to his death are what lead experts to believe this. Some believe that as Alexander fell ill in his final days, he suffered from progressive epidural spinal cord compression, which left him quadriplegic.&lt;ref&gt;George K. York, David A. Steinberg, "Commentary. The Diseases of Alexander the Great", ''Journal of the History of the Neurosciences'', Vol. 13, 2004, pg. 154&lt;/ref&gt; However this hypothesis cannot be proven without a full analysis of Alexander's body.&lt;ref name="Hutan Ashrafian 2004, pg. 140"/&gt;

Egyptian and [[Chaldea]]n embalmers who arrived on June 16 are said to have attested to Alexander's lifelike appearance.&lt;ref name ="Quest"/&gt; This was interpreted as a complication of [[typhoid fever]], known as [[ascending paralysis]], which causes a person to appear dead prior to death.&lt;ref name ="UMM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umm.edu/news/releases/bug.htm|title=INTESTINAL BUG LIKELY KILLED ALEXANDER THE GREAT|publisher =[[University of Maryland Medical Center]]|accessdate=Aug 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resting place==
{{main|Tomb of Alexander the Great}}
On its way back to Macedonia, the funerary cart with Alexander's body was met in [[Syria]] by one of Alexander's generals, the future ruler [[Ptolemy I Soter]]. In late 322 or early 321 BC Ptolemy diverted the body to Egypt where it was interred in [[Memphis, Egypt]]. In the late 4th or early 3rd century BC Alexander's body was transferred from the Memphis tomb to [[Alexandria]] for reburial&lt;ref name ="Bianchi"/&gt; (by [[Ptolemy Philadelphus]] in c. 280 BC, according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]).

[[File:Vaucanson Automata.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Three of Vaucanson's automata: the Flute Player, the Digesting Duck and the Tambourine Player]]
The '''''Canard Digérateur''''', or '''Digesting Duck''', was an [[automaton]] in the form of a [[duck]], created by [[Jacques de Vaucanson]] and unveiled on May 30, 1739 in France.  The mechanical duck appeared to have the ability to eat kernels of grain, and to metabolize and defecate them. While the duck did not actually have the ability to do this—the food was collected in one inner container, and the pre-stored feces were "produced" from a second, so that no actual digestion took place—Vaucanson hoped that a truly digesting automaton could one day be designed.

[[Voltaire]] wrote in 1741 that ''"sans la voix de la le Maure, &amp; le canard de Vaucanson, vous n'auriez rien qui fit ressouvenir de la gloire de la France."'' ("Without the voice of [[Catherine-Nicole Lemaure|le Maure]] and Vaucanson's duck, you would have nothing to remind you of the glory of [[France]].")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W2JfAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA491&amp;lpg=PA491&amp;dq=%22sans+la+voix+de+la+le+Maure,%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WtbePesp0k&amp;sig=aP4QTf2ebDyOTiLa7SV9s7BhUNg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjgkfqZ3PHeAhUp74MKHZUtD7UQ6AEwBnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sans%20la%20voix%20de%20la%20le%20Maure,%22&amp;f=false|title=Œuvres complètes de Voltaire|last=Voltaire|first=(pseud van François-Marie Arouet)|date=|publisher=P. Plancher|year=1819|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=491|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Duck is thought to have been destroyed in a fire at a museum in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;Wood (2003). "In 1882, someone wrote a letter to a German newspaper claiming they had seen the duck in a private museum in Krakow during the summer of 1879. But within days the museum had burnt down".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

== Operation ==
[[Image:Vaucanson1.jpeg|thumb|left|Poster]]
[[Image:Duck of Vaucanson.jpg|thumb|An American artist's (mistaken) drawing of how the Digesting Duck may have worked]]

The Duck was the size of a living duck, and was cased in gold-plated copper. As well as quacking and muddling water with its bill, it appeared capable of drinking water, and of taking food from its operator's hand, swallowing it with a gulping action and excreting what appeared to be a digested version of it.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wood|first1=Gaby|title=Living Dolls: A Magical History Of The Quest For Mechanical Life by Gaby Wood|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/feb/16/extract.gabywood|accessdate=21 November 2016|work=The Guardian|date=15 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaucanson described the Duck's interior as containing a small "chemical laboratory" capable of breaking down the grain.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; When the stage magician and automaton builder [[Jean-Eugène Robert-Houdin]] examined the Duck in 1844, he found that Vaucanson had faked the mechanism, and the Duck's excreta consisted of pre-prepared breadcrumb pellets, dyed green. Robert-Houdin described this as "a piece of artifice I would happily have incorporated in a conjuring trick".&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

== Modern influence ==
A replica of Vaucanson's mechanical duck, created by [[Ian Huynh]], was part of the collection of the (now defunct) [[Grenoble, France|Grenoble]] Automata Museum. Another replica was commissioned privately from [[David Secrett]], an automaton maker known for his archer figure.

The duck is mentioned by the hero of [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s [[short story]] "The Artist of the Beautiful", and is referenced and discussed in [[John Twelve Hawks]]' novel "Spark". In [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s historical novel ''[[Mason &amp; Dixon]]'', Vaucanson's duck attains consciousness and pursues an exiled Parisian chef across the United States. The duck is referred to in [[Peter Carey (novelist)|Peter Carey]]'s novel, ''The Chemistry of Tears''.&lt;ref name=Morrison&gt;{{cite web|last=Morrison|first=Rebecca K.|title=The Chemistry of Tears, By Peter Carey|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-chemistry-of-tears-by-peter-carey-7600562.html|work=The Independent|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=19 May 2012|date=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaucanson and his duck are referred to in [[Lawrence Norfolk]]'s 1991 novel ''[[Lempriere's Dictionary]]''.  The Duck is featured in [[Lavie Tidhar]]'s ''The Bookman'', in the Egyptian Hall, alongside [[the Turk]].

In 2006, Belgian conceptual artist [[Wim Delvoye]] introduced the world to his "Cloaca Machine", a mechanical art work that actually digests food and turns it into excrement, finally fulfilling Vaucanson's wish for a working digestive automation. Many iterations of the Cloaca Machine have since been produced; the current iteration sits vertically, mimicking the human digestive system. The excrement produced by the machine is vacuum-sealed in Cloaca-branded bags and sold to art collectors and dealers; every series of excrements produced has sold out.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The '''February 28 incident''' or the '''February 28 massacre''', also known as the '''2.28 incident''' (from {{zh|c=二二八事件|p=Èr’èrbā shìjiàn}}), was an anti-government uprising in Taiwan that was violently suppressed by the [[Kuomintang]]-led [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] [[Nationalist government|government]], which killed thousands of civilians beginning on 28 February 1947. The number of Taiwanese deaths from the massacre was estimated to be between 18,000 to 28,000.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news |last=Forsythe |first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Forsythe |date=July 14, 2015 |title=Taiwan Turns Light on 1947 Slaughter by Chiang Kai-shek’s Troops |newspaper=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/asia/taiwan-turns-light-on-1947-slaughter-by-chiang-kai-sheks-troops.html?_r=1 |accessdate=2006-04-22 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060424070637/http://www.taiwandc.org/hst-1947.htm| archivedate= 24 April 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The massacre marked the beginning of the [[White Terror (Taiwan)|White Terror]] in which tens of thousands of other Taiwanese went missing, died or were imprisoned. The incident is one of the most important events in Taiwan's modern history and was a critical impetus for the [[Taiwan independence movement]].

In 1945, following the [[surrender of Japan]] at the [[End of World War II in Asia|end of World War II]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] handed temporary administrative control of Taiwan to the Republic of China (ROC), thus ending 50 years of [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese colonial rule]]. Local inhabitants became resentful of what they saw as high-handed and frequently corrupt conduct on the part of the Kuomintang (KMT) authorities, including arbitrary seizure of private property and their economic mismanagement. The flashpoint came on 27 February 1947 in [[Taipei]], when a dispute between a cigarette vendor and an officer of the Office of Monopoly triggered civil disorder and an open rebellion that lasted for days.{{sfnp|Kerr|Stuart|1947|p=4|ps=: "On the evening of February 27 certain armed Monopoly Bureau agents and special police agents set upon and beat a female cigarette vendor, who with her two small children had protested the seizure of her small cash as well as her allegedly untaxed cigarettes. She is reported to have died soon after as a result of the beating at police hands. An angered crowd set after the agents, who shot at random, killing one person before they escaped into a civil police station."}} The violence spread and led to indiscriminate lynching of Mainlanders. The uprising was violently put down by the [[National Revolutionary Army]], and the island was placed under [[martial law]].

The subject was officially taboo for decades. On the anniversary of the event in 1995, [[President of the Republic of China|President]] [[Lee Teng-hui]] addressed the subject publicly, a first. The event is now openly discussed and details of the event have become the subject of government and academic investigation. February 28 has been designated '''Peace Memorial Day''' ({{zh|c=和平紀念日|p=hépíng jìniànrì|labels=no}}), an official public holiday. Every February 28, the president of the ROC gathers with other officials to ring a commemorative bell in memory of the victims. The president bows to family members of 2/28 victims and gives each one a certificate officially exonerating any victims previously [[blacklist]]ed as [[enemies of the state]]. Monuments and memorial parks to the victims of 2/28 have been erected in a number of Taiwanese cities, including [[Kaohsiung]] and Taipei.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gio.gov.tw/info/festival_c/228/monument.htm 二二八紀念碑] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606013017/http://www.gio.gov.tw/info/festival_c/228/monument.htm |date=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.new7.com.tw/journal/weekly/old/521/article075.html 新新聞521期:比較全台灣各地二二八紀念碑的碑文與形式]{{dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taipei's former "Taipei New Park" was rededicated as [[228 Peace Memorial Park]] and houses the National 228 Memorial Museum to commemorate the incident.

==Naming==
The "two-two-eight incident" name derives from the "year-month-day" [[date format]] convention used for [[dates in Chinese]]. [[Chinese languages]] do not have common names for the months, so months are given as numbers and dates are given in the form "''a''-''b''-''c''-''d'' year, ''x'' month, ''y'' day, with all numbers being read out as cardinals without any leading zeroes. With the incident dated February 28, 1947, the name is rendered "one nine four seven year, two month, two (tens) eight day". For brevity just the numbers are given, and, as a date of significance, the day and month without the year suffices as the name. Other historical events named using the same conventions as the "two-two-eight incident" include the [[May Fourth Movement]] (4 May 1919) the "Five-Four Movement", the [[Tiananmen Incident]] (5 April 1976) the "four-five movement" and the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tianamen Square protests]] (4 June 1989) the "six-four incident".

==Background==
{{See also|Chinese Civil War|Taiwan under Japanese rule}}
[[Image:Taiwan Literature Magazine.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Cover of the first issue of Taiwan Literature Magazine ({{zh|c=臺灣文藝|p=Táiwān wényì|labels=no}}) printed in 1934, during Japanese rule]]

During the 50 years of Japanese rule in Taiwan (1895&amp;ndash;1945), Japan developed Taiwan's economy and raised the standard of living for most Taiwanese people, building up Taiwan as a supply base for the Japanese main islands. Consequently, Taiwanese perceptions of the Japanese rule were more favourable than perceptions in other parts of [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. Taiwanese adopted Japanese names and practised [[Shinto]], while the schools instilled a sense of "Japanese spirit" in students. By the time World War II began, many Taiwanese were proficient in the Japanese language.

[[Image:Taiwan-1M-Yuan.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Severe inflation led the Bank of Taiwan to issue of bearer's checks in denominations of 1 million Taiwan Dollars (TW$1,000,000) in 1949.]]

After World War II, Taiwan was placed under the administrative control of the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] to provide stability until a permanent arrangement could be made. [[Chen Yi (Kuomintang)|Chen Yi]], the Governor-General of Taiwan, arrived on 24 October 1945, and received the last Japanese governor, [[Ando Rikichi]], who signed the document of surrender on the next day. Chen Yi then proclaimed the day as [[Retrocession Day]] to make Taiwan part of the Republic of China, although there were questions about the legality of doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Charter of the United Nations | work = Chapter XII: International Trusteeship System | publisher = United Nations | date = June 26, 1945 | url = https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter12.shtml | accessdate = September 15, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100828023233/http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter12.shtml| archivedate= 28 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) troops from [[Mainland China]] were initially welcomed by local inhabitants, but their behaviour and the KMT maladministration led to Taiwanese discontent during the immediate postwar period. As Governor-General, Chen Yi took over and sustained the Japanese system of [[state monopoly|state monopolies]] in [[tobacco]], [[sugar]], [[camphor]], [[tea]], [[paper]], [[chemical]]s, [[petroleum refining]], [[mining]] and [[cement]], just the way the Nationalist treated people in other former Japan-control areas (people nicknamed him robber "劫收").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ixueshu.com/document/9418c49ad68ded70.html|title=大「劫收」与上海民营工业|publisher= 檔案與史學|date= 1998-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He [[eminent domain|confiscated]] some 500 Japanese-owned factories and mines, and homes of former Japanese residents. Economic mismanagement led to a large [[black market]], runaway [[inflation]] and [[famine|food shortages]]. Many commodities were compulsorily bought cheaply by the KMT administration and shipped to Mainland China to meet the [[Chinese Civil War|Civil War]] shortages where they were sold at very high profit furthering the general shortage of goods in Taiwan. The price of [[rice]] rose to 100 times its original value between the time the Nationalist took over to the spring of 1946, increasing to nearly 4 times the price in Shanghai. It inflated further to 400 times the original price by January 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| year= 2003| title= Formosa After the War| work= Reflection on the 228 Event—The first gunshot| url= http://www.2003hr.net/English/cul_xb0101.php| accessdate= 2006-03-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060306231303/http://www.2003hr.net/English/cul_xb0101.php| archivedate= 6 March 2006| deadurl= yes| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carpetbaggers]] from Mainland China dominated nearly all industry, political and judicial offices, displacing the Taiwanese who were formerly employed. Many of the ROC garrison troops were highly undisciplined, looting, stealing and contributing to the overall breakdown of infrastructure and public services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=This Is the Shame |date=1946-06-10 |publisher=Time Magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,792979,00.html}} (Subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;
Because the Taiwanese elites had met with some success with self-government under Japanese rule, they had expected the same system from the incoming ruling Chinese Nationalist Government. However, the Chinese Nationalists opted for a different route, aiming for the centralization of government powers and a reduction in local authority. The KMT's nation-building efforts followed this ideology based on unpleasant experiences with the centrifugal forces during the [[Warlord Era]] in 1916–1928 that had torn the government in China. Mainland Communists were even preparing to bring down the government like the [[Ili Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

On the evening of 27 February 1947, a Tobacco Monopoly Bureau enforcement team in Taipei went to the district of {{nihongo|{{ill|Taiheichō|zh|太平町}}|太平町}}, [[Twatutia]] (present-day [[Nanjing Road (Taipei)|Nanjing West Road]]), where they confiscated contraband cigarettes from a 40-year-old widow named Lin Jiang-mai (林江邁) at the [[Tianma Tea House]]. When she demanded their return, one of the men holding a gun hit Lin's head with a pistol, prompting the surrounding Taiwanese crowd to challenge the Tobacco Monopoly agents. As they fled, one agent shot his gun into the crowd, killing one bystander. The crowd, which had already been harboring many feelings of frustration from unemployment, inflation and corruption of the Nationalist government, reached its breaking point. The crowd protested to both the police and the gendarmes, but was mostly ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |script-title=zh:延平路昨晚查緝私煙隊，開槍擊斃老百姓 (民報社) |language=Chinese |journal=民報社 |publisher=Taiwan Ministry of Culture:National Repository of Cultural Heritage |date=1947-02-28 |url=http://nrch.cca.gov.tw/ccahome/search/search_meta.jsp?xml_id=0001716464&amp;dofile=getImage.jsp?d=1241951145639&amp;id=0001648015&amp;filename=cca100003-np-mingpo19470228-03-i.jpg |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120715052919/http://nrch.cca.gov.tw/ccahome/search/search_meta.jsp?xml_id=0001716464&amp;dofile=getImage.jsp%3Fd=1241951145639&amp;id=0001648015&amp;filename=cca100003-np-mingpo19470228-03-i.jpg |archivedate=2012-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violence flared the following morning on February 28. Security forces at the Governor-General's Office tried to disperse the crowd. Some fired on the protesters who were calling for the arrest and trial of the agents involved in the previous day's shooting, resulting in several deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| year= 2003| title= Seizing-cigarettes incident| work= Reflection on the 228 Event—The first gunshot| url= http://www.2003hr.net/English/cul_xb0102.php| accessdate= 2006-03-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060306231311/http://www.2003hr.net/English/cul_xb0102.php| archivedate= 6 March 2006| deadurl= yes| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Formosans took over the administration of the town and military bases on March 4 and forced their way into local radio station to protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal |last=Durdin |first=Peggy |date=May 24, 1947 |title=Terror in Taiwan |magazine=[[The Nation]] |url=http://www.taiwandc.org/hst-1947.htm |accessdate=2006-04-22 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060424070637/http://www.taiwandc.org/hst-1947.htm |archivedate= 24 April 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith08&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Craig A |date=2008 |title=Taiwan's 228 Incident and the Politics of Placing Blame |url=https://ejournals.library.ualberta.ca/index.php/pi/article/view/4228 |journal=Past Imperfect |publisher=University of Alberta |volume=14 |issn=1711-053X |pages=143–163 |accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By evening, [[martial law]] had been declared and curfews were enforced by the arrest or shooting of anyone who violated curfew.

For several weeks after the February 28 incident, the Taiwanese civilians controlled much of Taiwan. The initial riots were spontaneous and somewhat violent. Within a few days the Taiwanese were generally coordinated and organized, and public order in Taiwanese-held areas was upheld by volunteer civilians organized by students, and unemployed former Japanese army soldiers. Local leaders formed a Settlement Committee, which presented the government with a list of [[32 Demands]] for reform of the provincial administration. They demanded, among other things, greater autonomy, free elections, surrender of the ROC Army to the Settlement Committee, and an end to governmental corruption.&lt;ref name=Smith08 /&gt; Motivations among the various Taiwanese groups varied; some demanded greater autonomy within the ROC, while others wanted UN trusteeship or full independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Durdin |first=Tillman |date=1947-03-30 |title=Formosans' Plea For Red Aid Seen |newspaper=New York Times |url=http://228.lomaji.com/news/033047.html |accessdate=2006-03-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215114430/http://228.lomaji.com/news/033047.html |archivedate=15 February 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taiwanese also demanded representation in the forthcoming peace treaty negotiations with Japan, hoping to secure a plebiscite to determine the island's political future.

Outside of Taipei, it was less peaceful. Mainland Chinese received revenge attacks of violence. Public places like banks and post offices were looted. Some had to flee for Military Police protection. A few smaller groups formed, including the [[Communist Party of China|Communist]]-inspired "[[27 Brigade]]". They looted 3 machine guns, 300 rifles, and hand grenades from military arsenals in Taichung and Pingtung.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |script-title=zh:反抗蔣家暴虐統治，臺灣人民武裝起義 蔣政府駐臺機關普遍遭受襲撃 起義人民已奪取了中南部政権（東北日報） |language=Chinese |journal=東北日報 |publisher=東北日報社|date=1947-03-13 |url=http://www.997788.com/s_175_7330794/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The armed Taiwanese shot or injured around 200 Nationalist Army soldiers which quickly precipitated the house arrest or execution of those who participated in the rebellion.

The [[Nationalist Government (China)|Nationalist Government]], under [[Chen Yi (Kuomintang)|Chen Yi]], stalled for time while it assembled a large military force in [[Fujian]]. Upon its arrival on March 8, the [[National Revolutionary Army|ROC troops]] launched a crackdown. The New York Times reported, "An American who had just arrived in China from [[Taipei|Taihoku]] said that troops from the mainland China arrived there on March&amp;nbsp;7 and indulged in three days of indiscriminate killing and looting. For a time everyone seen on the streets was shot at, homes were broken into and occupants killed. In the poorer sections the streets were said to have been littered with dead. There were instances of beheadings and mutilation of bodies, and women were raped, the American said."&lt;ref name=nytimes /&gt;

{{Refimprove section|date=August 2010}}
By the end of March, Chen Yi had ordered the imprisonment or execution of the leading Taiwanese organizers he could identify. His troops reportedly executed, according to a Taiwanese delegation in [[Nanjing]], between 3,000 and 4,000 people throughout the island. The exact number is still undetermined, as only 300 Taiwanese families applied for another compensation as recently as 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date={{date|2012-02-29|mdy}} |title=DPP questions former Premier Hau's 228 victim figures |url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2012/02/29/333129/DPP-questions.htm |newspaper=The China Post |location=Taipei |accessdate={{date|2014-11-14|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;Detailed records kept by the KMT have been reported as "lost". Some of the killings were random, while others were systematic. Taiwanese elites were among those targeted, and many of the Taiwanese who had formed self-governing groups during the reign of the Japanese were also victims of the 228 incident. A disproportionate number of the victims were Taiwanese high school students. Many had recently served in the [[Imperial Japanese Army]], having volunteered to serve to maintain order. Mainland Chinese civilians who fled were often beaten by Taiwanese.&lt;ref name=Smith08 /&gt;

Some Taiwan political organizations participated in the uprising, for example [[Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League]], was announced "communist" and illegal. Many members were arrested and executed. Some of these organizations had to move to Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |last1=Wang |first1=Xiaobo |date=February 2004 |title=Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League and the February 28 Incident|location=Taipei|publisher=Straits Academic Press}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial 228 purge was followed by discovery of communist infiltrators from communist mainland China under one-party rule, in what was termed "[[White Terror (Taiwan)|White Terror]]," which lasted until the end of 1987. Thousands of people, including both mainland Chinese and Taiwanese, were imprisoned or executed for their dissent, leaving the Taiwanese with a deep-seated bitterness towards what they term the Nationalist regime and, by extension, all Chinese not born in Taiwan or anyone supporting the KMT or CCP. Disappearances were common, and the people feared being be captured and executed. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

For several decades, it was taboo to openly criticize the 228 massacre incident. The government hoped that the execution of Governor Chen Yi and financial compensation for the victims had quelled resentment. In the 1970s the 228 Justice and Peace Movement was initiated by several citizens' groups to ask for a reversal of this policy, and, in 1992, the [[Executive Yuan]] promulgated the "February 28 Incident Research Report."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/03/world/taipei-journal-the-horror-of-2-28-taiwan-rips-open-the-past.html | title=Taipei Journal; The Horror of 2-28: Taiwan Rips Open the Past | work=The New York Times | date={{date|1992-04-03|mdy}} | accessdate={{date|2014-11-20|mdy}} | author=Kristof, Nicholas D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then-President and KMT-chairman [[Lee Teng-hui]], who had participated in the incident and was arrested as an instigator and a Communist sympathizer made a formal apology on behalf of the government in 1995 and declared February 28 a day to commemorate the victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mo |first=Yan-chih |date={{date|2006-02-28|mdy}} |title=Remembering 228: Ghosts of the past are yet to be laid to rest |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/print/2006/02/28/2003295019 |newspaper=Taipei Times |page=4 |accessdate={{date|2014-11-14|mdy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other memorials erected, Taipei New Park was renamed [[228 Memorial Park]].

Since the lifting of martial law in 1987, the government has set up the 228 Incident Memorial Foundation, a civilian reparations fund supported by public donations for the victims and their families. Many descendants of victims remain unaware that their family members were victims, while many of the families of victims from Mainland China did not know the details of their relatives' mistreatment during the riot.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}  Those who have received compensation more than two times are demanding trials of the still-living soldiers and officials who were responsible for the summary executions and deaths of their loved ones.

Prior to the 228 massacre, many Taiwanese hoped for a greater autonomy from China.  The failure of conclusive dialogue with the ROC administration in early March, combined with the feelings of betrayal felt towards the government and China in general are widely believed to have catalyzed today's [[Taiwan independence]] movement and subsequently the [[Taiwan Name Rectification Campaign]] after democratization.&lt;ref name=Smith08 /&gt;

On 28 February 2004, thousands of Taiwanese participated in the [[228 Hand-in-Hand Rally]].  They formed a {{convert|500|km|mi|adj=on|sp=us}} long [[human chain]], from Taiwan's northernmost city to its southern tip, to commemorate the 228 incident, to call for peace, and to protest the [[People's Republic of China]]'s deployment of [[missile]]s aimed at Taiwan along the coast of Taiwan Strait.

In 2006, the ''Research Report on Responsibility for the 228 Massacre'' was released after several years of research. The 2006 report was not intended to overlap with the prior (1992) 228 Massacre Research Report commissioned by the Executive Yuan. Chiang Kai-shek is specifically named as bearing the largest responsibility in the 2006 report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.228.org.tw/ResponsibilityReport/eng/06.htm |title=Research Report on Responsibility for the 228 Massacre, Chapter II: Responsibility on the part of the decision-makers in Nanjing |last=Chen |first=Yi-shen |date=February 2005 |website=228.org.tw |publisher=The 228 Memorial Foundation |accessdate={{date|2014-11-14|mdy}} |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228042753/http://www.228.org.tw/ResponsibilityReport/eng/06.htm |archive-date=2015-02-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some hardline academics have tried to confuse these conclusions, stating the departing Japanese colonial government was responsible by creating food shortages and causing inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shih |first=Hsiu-chuan |title=Hardline academics blame Japan for 228 Incident |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2007/02/28/2003350325 |accessdate={{date|2014-11-14|mdy}} |newspaper=Taipei Times |date={{date|2007-02-28|mdy}} |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===
A number of artists in Taiwan have addressed the subject of the 2-28 incident since the taboo was lifted on the subject in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taiwandc.org/228-60.htm|title=228 Massacre, 60th Commemoration|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident has been the subject of music by [[Fan-Long Ko]] and [[Tyzen Hsiao]] and a number of literary works.

===Film===
[[Hou Hsiao-hsien]]'s ''[[A City of Sadness]]'', the first movie dealing with the events, won the [[Golden Lion]] at the 1989 [[Venice Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096908/awards|title=A City of Sadness|date=21 October 1989|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2017|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2009 thriller ''[[Formosa Betrayed (film)|Formosa Betrayed]]'' also relates the incident as part of the motivation behind [[Taiwan independence]] activist characters.

===Literature===
[[Taiwanese-American]] [[Julie Wu]]'s novel ''The Third Son'' describes the event and its aftermath from the viewpoint of a Taiwanese boy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Winterton |first=Bradley |title=Book review: The Third Son |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2013/05/07/2003561643 |accessdate={{date|2014-11-14|mdy}} |newspaper=Taipei Times |date={{date|2014-05-07|mdy}} |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her 2013 novel, ''The 228 Legacy'', author Jennifer J. Chow brings to light the emotional ramifications for those who lived through the events yet suppressed their knowledge out of fear. It focuses on how there was such an impact that it permeated throughout multiple generations within the same family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bloom |first=Dan |title=US author probes 'legacy' of the 228 Incident in novel |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2013/08/19/2003570059 |accessdate=7 May 2014 |newspaper=Taipei Times |date=Aug 19, 2013 |page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shawna Yang Ryan]]'s novel, ''Green Island'' (2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knopfdoubleday.com/book/246332/green-island/|title=Green Island by Shawna Yang Ryan - PenguinRandomHouse.com|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; tells the story of the incident as it affects three generations of a Taiwanese family.

===Game===
In 2017, Taiwanese game developer Red Candle Games launched [[Detention (video game)|Detention]], a survival horror video game created and developed for [[Steam (software)|Steam]]. It is a 2D atmospheric horror side-scroller set in 1960s Taiwan under martial law following the 228 incident. The game also incorporates religious elements based on Taiwanese culture and mythology. The game has received favourable reviews from critics. Rely On Horror gave the game a 9 out of 10, saying that "every facet of Detention moves in one harmonious lockstep towards an unavoidable tragedy, drowning out the world around you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.relyonhorror.com/reviews/detentionreview/|title=Review: Detention - Rely on Horror|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
Taiwanese metal band [[Chthonic (band)|Chthonic]]'s album [[Mirror of Retribution]] also makes several lyrical references to the 228 massacre.

'''Francis Wheatley''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|VC|DCM}} (1826 – 21 May 1865) was a [[British Army]] soldier and a [[Crimean War]] recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces.

He was born in [[Ruddington]], [[Nottinghamshire]], England. His father was a frame work [[knit]]ter, a trade which Francis took up before joining the army. He was enlisted at [[Daventry]] on 5 November 1839 (for a bounty of £3.17s.6d) into the 1st Battalion [[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)]].

==Victoria Cross==
He was awarded his Victoria Cross (VC) for duty in the Crimean War on 12 October 1854. The day before his VC action, another act of gallantry earned him the [[Distinguished Conduct Medal]]. The citation for his VC reads:
On 12 October 1854 Wheatley and some other Riflemen were occupying a section of the trenches before Sevastopol when a live Russian shell fell amongst the men. Without hesitation Wheatley seized hold of the shell and endeavoured to knock the fuse out with the butt of his rifle. He was unsuccessful at the first attempt and so, with great presence of mind and deliberation he managed somehow to heave it over the parapet of the trench. It had scarcely fallen outside when it exploded. Had it not been for his coolness, presence of mind and supreme courage and discipline, the shell would have inevitably exploded amongst the party causing serious casualties, but instead not a man was hurt.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=21971 |date=24 February 1857 |page=662 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His VC was presented by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] in person at the first investiture at [[Hyde Park, London]] on 26 June 1857.

==Death==
He died on 21 May 1865 at Westminster Hospital, [[London]] from acute [[myelitis]] (inflammation of the spinal cord) and [[asphyxia]]. He was buried in a common grave in [[Brompton Cemetery]], on which a memorial has now been placed. His medals are on view at the [[Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum]] and his name is on the memorial in [[Winchester Cathedral]].

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross and other medals are displayed at the [[Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum]], [[Winchester]], England.

His other medals are:
* [[South Africa Medal (1854)|South Africa Medal]]
* Crimea War medal with 3 clasps
* [[Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal]]
* Turkish War Medal
* French Legion of Honour

'''''Homegoings''''' is a 2013 documentary film directed by Christine Turner about the Owens Funeral Home on [[Lenox Avenue]] in [[Harlem]], exploring African-American death rituals through the work of funeral home director Isaiah Owens. The film premiered February 28 at the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s 'Documentary Fortnight 2013' showcase, before airing on PBS-TV's ''[[POV (TV series)|POV]]'' series and screening for a week at the [[Maysles Cinema]].&lt;ref name="Richardson"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/uptown/uptown-talk-harlem-funeral-director-stars-documentary-article-1.1263655|title=Harlem funeral director Isaiah Owens stars in ‘Homegoings,’ a documentary about African-American death rituals|last=Richardson|first=Clem|date=14 February 2013|accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Webster"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/24/movies/homegoings-honors-a-harlem-undertaker.html|title=Finding Honor in the Final Send-Off|last=Webster|first=Andy|work=The New Times|accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Brooklyn-based documentary filmmaker and child of a Chinese-American mother and African-American father, Turner has stated she initially became interested in death rituals after both of her grandmothers died within two weeks of each other. She subsequently contacted Owens—known as "Fix Em" for his ability to repair corpses ravaged by disease, accident or violence—after reading a newspaper article about his work. Filming began in 2009.&lt;ref name="Richardson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/24/homegoings-documentary-explores-african-american-funeral-tradition_n_3149700.html|title='Homegoings' Documentary Explores African-American Funeral Traditions|date=24 April 2013|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Individualist anarchism]] refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the [[individual]] and his or her [[will (philosophy)|will]] over external determinants such as groups, society, traditions, and ideological systems.&lt;ref name="ryner"&gt;"What do I mean by individualism?
I mean by individualism the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, no tradition, no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience."[http://www.marx.org/archive/ryner/1905/mini-manual.htm ''Mini-Manual of Individualism'' by Han Ryner]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tucker"&gt;"I do not admit anything except the existence of the individual, as a condition of his sovereignty. To say that the sovereignty of the individual is conditioned by Liberty is simply another way of saying that it is conditioned by itself.""Anarchism and the State" in ''Individual Liberty''&lt;/ref&gt; '''European individualist anarchism''' proceeded from the roots laid by [[William Godwin]],&lt;ref name=woodcock20&gt;
[[George Woodcock|Woodcock, George]]. 2004. ''[[Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements]]''. Broadview Press. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Individualist anarchism expanded and diversified through Europe, incorporating influences from [[Individualist anarchism in the United States|American individualist anarchism]].

Early European individualist anarchism was influenced by many philosophers, including [[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]], [[Max Stirner]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]].&lt;ref name="tesisenxarxa1923"/&gt; Proudhon was an early pioneer of [[anarchism]] as well as of the important individualist anarchist current of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Americana"&gt;{{Citation |title=[[Encyclopedia Americana]] |editor=George Edward Rines |year=1918 |publisher=Encyclopedia Americana Corp. |location=New York |oclc=7308909 |page=624 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton 1995 79"&gt;{{Citation |last=Hamilton |first=Peter |title=Emile Durkheim |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1995 |isbn=0-415-11047-5 |page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stirner became a central figure of [[individualist anarchism]] through the publication of his seminal work ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' which is considered to be "a founding text in the tradition of individualist anarchism."&lt;ref name=stirnersep&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=max-stirner |title=Max Stirner |last=Leopold  |first=David|date=2006-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[philosophy of Max Stirner]] supports the individual doing exactly what he pleases – taking no notice of God, state, or moral rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller |first=David |title=The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought |year=1987 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Stirner, rights were ''[[Reification (fallacy)|spooks]]'' in the mind, and he held that society does not exist but "the individuals are its reality"– he supported property by force of might rather than moral right.&lt;ref&gt;"What my might reaches is my property; and let me claim as property everything I feel myself strong enough to attain, and let me extend my actual property as fas as ''I'' entitle, that is, empower myself to take…" From ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'', quoted in {{cite book|last=Ossar |first=Michael |year=1980 |title=Anarchism in the Dramas of Ernst Toller |publisher=[[State University of New York Press]] |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw "[[Union of egoists]]" drawn together by respect for each other's self-ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=George Woodcock|last=Woodcock |first=George |year=2004 |title=Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements |publisher=Broadview Press |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thoreau emphasized the promotion of [[simple living]], environmental stewardship, and [[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|civil disobedience]] were influential in European individualist anarchists.&lt;ref name="tesisenxarxa1923"/&gt;

An important tendency within European individualist anarchism in general is the emphasis on individual subjective exploration and defiance of social conventions. Individualist anarchist philosophy attracted "amongst artists, intellectuals and the well-read, urban middle classes in general."&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;[https://archive.org/download/bonnot_gang/bonnotgangfull.pdf Richard Parry. ''The Bonnot Gang: The Story of the French Illegalists'']&lt;/ref&gt; As such [[Murray Bookchin]] describes a lot of individualist anarchism as people who "expressed their opposition in uniquely personal forms, especially in fiery tracts, outrageous behavior, and aberrant lifestyles in the cultural ghettos of fin de siecle New York, Paris, and London. As a credo, individualist anarchism remained largely a [[bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle, most conspicuous in its demands for sexual freedom ('free love') and enamored of innovations in art, behavior, and clothing.".&lt;ref name="bohemian individualism"&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/socanlifean2 "2.

Other important currents common within European individual anarchism include [[free love]],&lt;ref name="spain"&gt;[http://www.acracia.org/xdiez.html "Voluntary non-submission.

Individualist anarchist activity spanned the full spectrum of alternatives to [[authoritarian]] society, subverting it by undermining its way of life facet by facet." Thus theft, [[counterfeiting]], swindling, and robbery became a way of life for hundreds of individualists, as it was already for countless thousands of [[proletarian]]s. The wave of anarchist bombings and assassinations of the 1890s ([[Auguste Vaillant]], Ravachol, [[Émile Henry (anarchist)|Émile Henry]], [[Sante Caserio]]) and the practice of illegalism from the mid-1880s to the start of the First World War ([[Clément Duval]], Pini, [[Marius Jacob]], the [[Bonnot gang]]) were twin aspects of the same proletarian offensive, but were expressed in an individualist practice, one that complemented the great collective struggles against capital."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[freethought]].&lt;ref name="viruseditorial.net"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120324044614/http://www.viruseditorial.net/pdf/anarquismo%20individualista.pdf Xavier Diez.

==Early influences==
===William Godwin===
{{Main|William Godwin}}
[[File:WilliamGodwin.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Northcote (painter)|James Northcote]], ''[[William Godwin]]'', oil on canvas, 1802, the [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]], William Godwin, a radical liberal and [[utilitarian]] was one of the first to espouse what became known as IA.]]
William Godwin was an individualist anarchist&lt;ref name="woodcock20"/&gt; and [[philosophical anarchist]] who was influenced by the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment]],&lt;ref name=Encarta&gt;"Anarchism", ''[[Encarta]] Online Encyclopedia'' 2006 (UK version)&lt;/ref&gt; and developed what many consider the first expression of [[anarchist schools of thought|modern anarchist thought]].&lt;ref name="godwinsep"&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=godwin |title=William Godwin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin was, according to [[Peter Kropotkin]], "the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work."&lt;ref name="EB1910"&gt;Peter Kropotkin, [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/britanniaanarchy.html "Anarchism"], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], 1910&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Godwin himself attributed the first anarchist writing to [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[A Vindication of Natural Society]]''. "Most of the above arguments may be found much more at large in Burke's ''Vindication of Natural Society''; a treatise in which the evils of the existing political institutions are displayed with incomparable force of reasoning and lustre of eloquence…" – footnote, Ch. 2 ''[[Political Justice]]'' by William Godwin.&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin advocated extreme individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labor be eliminated.&lt;ref name=godwineb&gt;"[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9037183 Godwin, William]". (2006). In Britannica Concise Encyclopaedia. Retrieved December 7, 2006, from ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' Online.&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin, a utilitarian, believed that not all individuals are of equal value, with some of us "of more worth and importance' than others depending on our utility in bringing about social good. Godwin believed that the person whose life was the most conducive to the general good should be favored, eschewing equal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Paul |last=McLaughlin |title=Anarchism and Authority: A Philosophical Introduction to Classical Anarchism |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, |year=2007 |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin opposed government because it infringes on the individual's right to "private judgement" to determine which actions most maximize utility, but also objected to all authority over the individual's judgement. This aspect of Godwin's philosophy, minus the utilitarianism, was developed into a more extreme form later by Stirner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Paul |last=McLaughlin |title=Anarchism and Authority: A Philosophical Introduction to Classical Anarchism |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, |year=2007 |page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Godwin even opposed individuals performing together in orchestras, writing in ''[[Political Justice]]'' that "everything understood by the term co-operation is in some sense an evil."&lt;ref name=godwineb/&gt; The only apparent exception to this opposition to cooperation is the spontaneous association that may arise when a society is threatened by violent force. One reason he opposed cooperation is he believed it to interfere with an individual's ability to be benevolent for the greater good. Godwin opposes the idea of government, but wrote that a [[Limited government|minimal state]] is a present "necessary evil"&lt;ref name=pj&gt;{{Citation |title=[[Political Justice|Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Modern Morals and Manners]] |last=Godwin |first=William |authorlink=William Godwin |year=1796 |publisher=G.G. and J. Robinson |oclc=2340417 |origyear=1793}}&lt;/ref&gt; that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge.&lt;ref name="godwinsep"/&gt; He expressly opposed democracy, fearing oppression of the individual by the majority (though he preferred democracy to dictatorship).

[[File:PoliticalJustice3.png|thumb|right|Title page from the third edition of ''[[Political Justice]]'']]

Godwin supported individual ownership of property, defining it as "the empire to which every man is entitled over the produce of his own industry."&lt;ref name=pj/&gt; But he also suggested that individuals give each other their surplus property when the other needed it, without involving trade (e.g. ''[[gift economy]]''). Thus, while people have the right to [[private property]], they ''should'' give it away as enlightened [[altruists]]. Godwin explained this approach stating, "[e]very man has a right to that, the exclusive possession of which being awarded to him, a greater sum of benefit or pleasure will result than could have arisen from its being otherwise appropriated."&lt;ref name=pj/&gt; Yet to Godwin, benevolence was not to be enforced but instead a matter of free individual "private judgement." He did not advocate a [[common ownership|community of goods]] or assert [[collective ownership]] as is embraced in communism, but his belief that individuals ought to share with those in need was influential on the later development of [[anarchist communism]].

Godwin's political views were diverse and do not perfectly agree with any of the ideologies that claim his influence; writers of the ''[[Socialist Standard]]'', organ of the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]], consider Godwin both an individualist and a communist;&lt;ref name="Godwin"&gt;"William Godwin, Shelly and Communism" by ALB, The Socialist Standard&lt;/ref&gt; [[anarcho-capitalist]] [[Murray Rothbard]] did not regard Godwin as an individualist, referring to him as the "founder of communist anarchism";&lt;ref name="rothbard/burke"&gt;Rothbard, Murray. "[http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard11.html Edmund Burke, Anarchist]."&lt;/ref&gt; and historian [[Albert Weisbord]] considers him an individualist anarchist without reservation.&lt;ref name="conquest8"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers see a conflict between Godwin's advocacy of "private judgement" and utilitarianism, as he says that ethics requires that individuals give their surplus property to each other resulting in an egalitarian society, but, at the same time, he insists that all things be left to individual choice.&lt;ref name="godwinsep"/&gt; Many of Godwin's views changed over time, as noted by [[Peter Kropotkin]].

===Pierre-Joseph Proudhon===
[[File:Pierre Joseph Proudhon.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], the first self-identified anarchist.]]
{{Main|Pierre-Joseph Proudhon}}
Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809–1865) was the first philosopher to label himself an "anarchist."&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime_20061207.shtml "Anarchism"], [[BBC Radio 4]] program, [[In Our Time (BBC Radio 4)|In Our Time]], Thursday December 7, 2006. Hosted by [[Melvyn Bragg]] of the BBC, with John Keane, Professor of Politics at [[University of Westminster]], [[Ruth Kinna]], Senior Lecturer in Politics at [[Loughborough University]], and [[Peter Marshall (author)|Peter Marshall]], philosopher and historian.&lt;/ref&gt; Some consider Proudhon to be an individualist anarchist,&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Americana"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton 1995 79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Faguet 1970 147"&gt;{{Citation |last=Faguet |first=Emile |title=Politicians &amp; Moralists of the Nineteenth Century |publisher=Books for Libraries Press |location=Freeport |year=1970 |isbn=0-8369-1828-2 |page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others regard him to be a [[social anarchism|social anarchist]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, James &amp; Purkis, Jon. 2004. ''Changing Anarchism: Anarchist Theory and Practice in a Global Age''. [[Manchester University Press]]. p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knowles, Rob. "Political Economy from below : Communitarian Anarchism as a Neglected Discourse in Histories of Economic Thought". ''History of Economics Review'', No.31 Winter 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators reject this, noting his preference for association in large industries, rather than individual control.&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock, George. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements'', Broadview Press, 2004, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he was influential among American individualists; in the 1840s and 1850s, [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]],&lt;ref&gt;Dana, Charles A. [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/proudhon/dana.html Proudhon and his "Bank of the People"] (1848).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William B. Greene]] introduced Proudhon's works to the United States. Greene adapted Proudhon's mutualism to American conditions and introduced it to [[Benjamin R. Tucker]].&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin R., "On Picket Duty", ''Liberty (Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order)'' (1881–1908); January 5, 1889; 6, 10; APS Online pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Proudhon opposed government privilege that protects capitalist, banking and land interests, and the accumulation or acquisition of property (and any form of [[coercion]] that led to it) which he believed hampers competition and concentrates wealth. Proudhon favored the right of individuals to retain the product of their labor as their own property, but believed that all other property was illegitimate. Thus, he saw private property as both essential to liberty and a road to tyranny, the former when it resulted from labor and was required for labor and the latter when it resulted in/from exploitation (profit, interest, rent, tax). He generally termed the former "possession" and the latter "property." For large-scale industry, he supported workers associations to replace wage labor and opposed land ownership.

Proudhon maintained that workers should retain the entirety of what they produce, and that [[monopoly|monopolies]] on credit and land are the forces that prohibit this. He advocated an economic system he called [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] that included possession and exchange of private property but without profit. [[Joseph Dejacque]] explicitly rejected Proudhon's philosophy, instead preferring [[anarchist-communism]], asserting directly to Proudhon in a letter that "it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature." An individualist rather than [[anarchist communist]],&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia Americana"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton 1995 79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Faguet 1970 147"/&gt; Proudhon said that "communism...is the very denial of society in its foundation..."&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. ''The Philosophy of Misery: The Evolution of Capitalism''. BiblioBazaar, LLC (2006). {{ISBN|1-4264-0908-7}} pp. 217&lt;/ref&gt; and famously declared that "[[property is theft]]!" in reference to his rejection of ownership rights to land being granted to a person who is not using that land.

After Dejacque and others split from Proudhon, the relationship between individualists, and anarcho-communists was characterized by various degrees of antagonism and harmony. For example, individualists like Tucker at once translated and reprinted the works of [[collectivist anarchism|collectivists]] like [[Mikhail Bakunin]] while rejecting the economic aspects of collectivism and communism as incompatible with anarchist ideals.

====Mutualism====
{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}
Proudhon originated mutualism, an [[anarchist school of thought]], envisioning a society where each person might possess a [[means of production]], either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the [[free market]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mutualist.org/ Mutualist.org Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank which would lend to producers at an interest rate only high enough to cover the costs of administration.&lt;ref&gt;
Miller, David. 1987. "Mutualism." The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought. Blackwell Publishing. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualism is based on a [[labor theory of value]] which holds that when labor or its product is sold, in exchange, it ought to receive goods or services embodying "the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility".&lt;ref&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''[[Voluntary Socialism]]'', chapter 6, paragraph 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Some mutualists believe that if the state did not intervene, as a result of increased competition in the marketplace, individuals would receive no more income than that in proportion to the amount of labor they exert.&lt;ref&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''[[Voluntary Socialism]]'', chapter 6, paragraphs 9, 10 &amp; 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Kevin, 2004, ''Studies in Mutualist Political Economy'', chapter 2 (after Meek &amp; Oppenheimer).&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualists oppose the idea of individuals receiving income through loans, investments, and [[renting|rent]], as they believe these individuals are not laboring. Some of them argue that if state intervention ceased, these types of incomes would disappear due to increased competition in capital.&lt;ref&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''[[Voluntary Socialism]]'', chapter 6, paragraph 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Kevin, 2004, ''Studies in Mutualist Political Economy'', chapter 2 (after Ricardo, Dobb &amp; Oppenheimer).&lt;/ref&gt; Though Proudhon opposed this type of income, he expressed: "... I never meant to ... forbid or suppress, by sovereign decree, ground rent and interest on capital. I believe that all these forms of human activity should remain free and optional for all."&lt;ref&gt;''Solution of the Social Problem'', 1848–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Proudhonpropietat.JPG|thumb|left|200px|''[[What is Property? Or, an Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government by Pierre Joseph Proudhon]]'' by [[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]]]]

Insofar as they ensure workers' rights to the full product of their labor, mutualists support markets and [[private property]]. However, they argue for conditional title to land, whose private ownership is legitimate only so long as it remains in use or occupation (which Proudhon called "possession.")&lt;ref&gt;Swartz, Clarence Lee. [http://www.panarchy.org/swartz/mutualism.6.html What is Mutualism? VI. Land and Rent]&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon's Mutualism supports [[Worker cooperative|labor-owned cooperative firms]] and associations&lt;ref&gt;Hymans, E., ''Pierre-Joseph Proudhon'', pp. 190–1,&lt;br&gt;Woodcock, George. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements'', Broadview Press, 2004, pp. 110 &amp; 112&lt;/ref&gt; for "we need not hesitate, for we have no choice. . . it is necessary to form an ASSOCIATION among workers . . . because without that, they would remain related as subordinates and superiors, and there would ensue two . . . castes of masters and wage-workers, which is repugnant to a free and democratic society" and so "it becomes necessary for the workers to form themselves into democratic societies, with equal conditions for all members, on pain of a relapse into feudalism."&lt;ref&gt;''General Idea of the Revolution'', Pluto Press, pp. 215–216 and p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualist opinions differs on whether [[capital goods]] (man-made, non-land, "[[means of production]])" should be commonly managed public assets or private property.

Mutualists originally considered themselves to be libertarian socialists. However, "some mutualists have abandoned the labor theory of value, and prefer to avoid the term "socialist." But they still retain some cultural attitudes, for the most part, that set them off from the [[libertarian right]]."&lt;ref name="mutualist.org"&gt;[http://www.mutualist.org/id32.html A Mutualist FAQ: A.4. Are Mutualists Socialists?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609075437/http://www.mutualist.org/id32.html |date=June 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualists have distinguished themselves from [[state socialism]], and don't advocate social control over the means of production. Benjamin Tucker said of Proudhon, that "though opposed to socializing the ownership of capital, [Proudhon] aimed nevertheless to socialize its effects by making its use beneficial to all instead of a means of impoverishing the many to enrich the few...by subjecting capital to the natural law of competition, thus bringing the price of its own use down to cost."&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin, ''State Socialism and Anarchism'', [http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/tucker/tucker2.html State Socialism and Anarchism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990117030925/http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/tucker/tucker2.html |date=January 17, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Max Stirner===
{{main|Max Stirner}}
[[File:Stirner02.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Max Stirner]]. Portrait by [[Friedrich Engels]].]]Johann Kaspar Schmidt (October 25, 1806 – June 26, 1856), better known as Max Stirner (the ''[[nom de plume]]'' he adopted from a schoolyard nickname he had acquired as a child because of his high brow, in German 'Stirn'), was a German philosopher, who ranks as one of the literary fathers of [[nihilism]], [[existentialism]], [[post-modernism]] and [[anarchism]], especially of individualist anarchism. Stirner's main work is ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'', also known as ''The Ego and His Own'' (''Der Einzige und sein Eigentum'' in German, which translates literally as ''The Only One and his Property''). This work was first published in 1844 in [[Leipzig]], and has since appeared in numerous editions and translations.

Authors, philosophers and artists have cited, quoted or otherwise referred to Max Stirner. They include [[Albert Camus]] in ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]'' (the section on Stirner is omitted from the majority of English editions including [[Penguin books|Penguin]]'s), [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Dora Marsden]], [[Emma Goldman]],&lt;ref&gt;See Goldman, Anarchism and Other Essays, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg Brandes]], [[Rudolf Steiner]], [[John Cowper Powys]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2004/11/01/do0106.xml | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=World of books | first=A N | last=Wilson | date=November 1, 2004 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Armand]], [[Han Ryner]], [[Renzo Novatore]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Robert Anton Wilson]], Italian individualist anarchist [[Enrico Arrigoni|Frank Brand]], Russian-American philosopher [[Ayn Rand]],&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Letters of Ayn Rand]]'', pg. 176, Dutton, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bob Black]], [[anti-art|antiartist]] [[Marcel Duchamp]], several writers of the [[Situationist International]], and [[Max Ernst]], who titled a 1925 painting ''L'unique et sa propriété''.

''The Ego and Its Own'' has seen periodic revivals of popular, political and academic interest, based around widely divergent translations and interpretations—emphasizing psychological or political views. Today, many ideas associated with [[post-left anarchy]]'s criticism of ideology and uncompromising [[individualism]] are clearly related to Stirner's. [[Individualist feminism]] claims him as a pioneer, since his objection to any absolute concept also counts [[gender role]]s as "spooks". His ideas were also adopted by [[post-anarchism]], with [[Saul Newman]] largely agreeing with many of Stirner's criticisms of [[classical anarchism]], including his rejection of revolution and [[essentialism]].

Stirner's philosophy, sometimes called "egoism", is the most extreme&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|authorlink=David Goodway|last=Goodway |first=David |title=[[Anarchist Seeds Beneath the Snow]] |publisher=Liverpool University Press |year=2006 |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; form of IA. He was a [[Young Hegelians|Hegelian]] philosopher whose "name appears with familiar regularity in historically-orientated surveys of anarchist thought as one of the earliest and best-known exponents of IA."&lt;ref name=stirnersep/&gt; Stirner does not recommend that the individual try to eliminate the state but simply exploit it to further the individual's interests.&lt;ref&gt;
Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; He says that the egoist rejects pursuit of devotion to "a great idea, a good cause, a doctrine, a system, a lofty calling", saying that the egoist has no political calling but rather "lives themselves out" without regard to "how well or ill humanity may fare thereby."&lt;ref&gt;Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Stirner held that the only limitation on the rights of the individual is his power to obtain what he desires.&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia Americana: A Library of Universal Knowledge. Encyclopedia Corporation. p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; He proposes that most commonly accepted social institutions—including the notion of State, property as a right, natural rights in general, and the very notion of society—were mere ''spooks'' in the mind. Stirner wanted to "abolish not only the state but also society as an institution responsible for its members."&lt;ref&gt;Heider, Ulrike. ''Anarchism: Left, Right and Green'', San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1994, pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt; He advocated self-assertion and foresaw "associations of egoists" where respect for ruthlessness drew people together.&lt;ref name=woodcock20/&gt; Even murder is permissible "if it is right for me."&lt;ref&gt;Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Stirner Der Einzige und sein Eigentum.djvu|thumb|left|200px|Original edition of ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' in German]]

Stirner claimed that property comes about through might: "Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property." "What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing." "I do not step shyly back from your property, but look upon it always as my property, in which I respect nothing. Pray do the like with what you call my property!".&lt;ref&gt;Stirner, Max. The Ego and Its Own, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; His concept of "egoistic property" not only rejects moral restraint on how one obtains and uses ''things'', but includes other people as well.&lt;ref&gt;Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; His embrace of [[Ethical egoism|egoism]] is in stark contrast to Godwin's [[altruism]]. Stirner was opposed to communism, seeing it as a form of authority over the individual.

&lt;!--this article is on Europe. This material belongs elsewhere.
This position on property is much different from the native American, natural law, form of individualist anarchism, which defends the inviolability of the private property that has been earned through labor&lt;ref&gt;Weir, David. Anarchy &amp; Culture. University of Massachusetts Press. 1997. p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; and trade. In 1886 American Benjamin Tucker rejected the natural rights philosophy and adopted Stirner's egoism, with several others joining with him. This split the American individualists into fierce debate, "with the natural rights proponents accusing the egoists of destroying libertarianism itself."&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, Wendy. [http://oll.libertyfund.org/Texts/LiteratureOfLiberty0352/0353-15_1981v3.html Benjamin Tucker, Individualism, &amp; Liberty: Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order]. Literature of Liberty: A Review of Contemporary Liberal Thought (1978–1982). Institute for Human Studies. Autumn 1981, VOL. IV, NO. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Other egoists include [[James L. Walker]], [[Sidney Parker (anarchist)|Sidney Parker]], [[Dora Marsden]], [[John Beverley Robinson (anarchist)|John Beverly Robinson]], and [[Benjamin Tucker]] (later in life).--&gt;

In Russia, IA inspired by Stirner combined with an appreciation for [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] to attract a small following of [[bohemian]] artists and intellectuals such as [[Lev Chernyi]], as well as a few lone wolves who found self-expression in crime and violence.&lt;ref name=levy&gt;Levy, Carl.

They claimed this belief to be fundamental to anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul. "The Anarchists in the Russian Revolution". ''Russian Review'', Vol. 26, No. 4. (Oct. 1967). p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; This type of IA inspired [[anarcho-feminist]] [[Emma Goldman]]&lt;ref name=levy/&gt;

Though Stirner's philosophy is individualist, it has influenced some [[libertarian socialism|libertarian communists]] and [[anarcho-communist]]s. "For Ourselves Council for Generalized Self-Management" discusses Stirner and speaks of a "communist egoism", which is said to be a "synthesis of individualism and collectivism", and says that "greed in its fullest sense is the only possible basis of communist society."&lt;ref&gt;For Ourselves, {{cite web|url=http://home.teleport.com/~rasputin/RTBGreedy-v1_2_5-en.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228054533/http://home.teleport.com/~rasputin/RTBGreedy-v1_2_5-en.htm |archivedate=December 28, 2008 |df=mdy-all }} ''The Right to Be Greedy: Theses On The Practical Necessity Of Demanding Everything'', 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Forms of libertarian communism such as [[Situationist International|situationism]] are influenced by Stirner.&lt;ref&gt;see, for example, Christopher Gray, ''Leaving the Twentieth Century'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-communist [[Emma Goldman]] was influenced by both Stirner and [[Peter Kropotkin]] and blended their philosophies together in her own.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Goldman, ''Anarchism and Other Essays'', p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development by country==
===France===
{{Main|Individualist anarchism in France}}
[[File:L'anarchie (1907).png|thumb|right|''L'Anarchie'', January 3, 1907, French individualist anarchist publication edited by [[Albert Libertad]]]]Proudhon and Stirner stimulated a strong response in France. An early important example was [[Anselme Bellegarrigue]]. He participated in the French Revolution of 1848, was author and editor of ''Anarchie, Journal de l'Ordre'' and ''Au fait ! Au fait ! Interprétation de l'idée démocratique''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Anselme_Bellegarrigue__To_the_Point__To_Action___An_Interpretation_of_the_Democratic_Idea.html ''To the Point! To Action!! An Interpretation of the Democratic Idea'' by [[Anselme Bellegarrigue]]]&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote the important early [[Anarchist Manifesto]] in 1850. Catalan historian of individualist anarchism Xavier Diez reports that during his travels in the United States "he at least contacted [[Henry David Thoreau|(Henry David) Thoreau]] and, probably [[Josiah Warren|(Josiah) Warren]]."&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Diez. ''El anarquismo individualista en España (1923–1938).'' Virus editorial. Barcelona. 2007. pg. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Jean-Baptiste Louiche, Charles Schæffer and Georges Deherme edited the individualist anarchist publication ''Autonomie Individuelle'' that ran from 1887 to 1888.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la-presse-anarchiste.net/spip.php?rubrique258 Autonomie Individuelle (1887–1888)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectuals such as [[Albert Libertad]], André Lorulot, [[Émile Armand]], [[Victor Serge]], [[Zo d'Axa]] and [[Rirette Maitrejean]] extended the theory in France's main individualist anarchist journal, ''[[L'Anarchie]]''&lt;ref&gt;"On the fringe of the movement, and particularly in the individualist faction which became relatively strong after 1900 and began to publish its own sectarian paper, −315- L'Anarchie ( 1905–14), there were groups and individuals who lived largely by crime. Among them were some of the most original as well as some of the most tragic figures in anarchist history." Woodcock, George. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements. 1962''&lt;/ref&gt; in 1905 and later in ''[[EnDehors]]''. Outside this journal, [[Han Ryner]] wrote ''Petit Manuel individualiste'' (1903).

French individualist anarchists espoused diverse positions. For example, Émile Armand rejected violence and embraced mutualism while advocating [[free love]]. Albert Libertad and Zo d'Axa championed violent [[propaganda by the deed]] while adhering to [[communitarianism]] or [[anarcho-communism]]&lt;ref name="libertadcommuniste"&gt;"Libertad était un révolté, qui luttait non-en dehors (tel les communautaires/colonies) ni à côté de la société (les éducationnistes), mais en son sein. Il sera énoncé comme une figure de l'anarchisme individualiste, néanmoins, il ne se revendiquera jamais ainsi, même si il ne rejetait pas l'individualisme, et que Libertad se revendiquait du communisme ; plus tard, Mauricius, qui était un des éditeurs du journal "l'Anarchie" dira "Nous ne nous faisions pas d'illusions, nous savions bien que cette libération totale de l'individu dans la société capitaliste était impossible et que la réalisation de sa personnalité ne pourrait se faire que dans une société raisonnable, dont le communisme libertaire nous semblait être la meilleure expression.".

Libertad s'associait à la dynamique de révolte individuelle radicale au projet d'émancipation collective. Il insistait sur la nécessité de développer le sentiment de camaraderie, afin de remplacer la concurrence qui était la morale de la société bourgeoise. "[http://savoir.pingouin.org/index.php/Albert_Libertad "Albert Libertad"]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Refusal of work|rejecting work]]. Han Ryner on the other side conciled anarchism with [[stoicism]]. Nevertheless, French individualist circles displayed a strong sense of personal libertarianism and experimentation. [[Anarchist naturism]] and [[free love]] concepts influenced individualist anarchists circles in France and Spain and expanded to the rest of anarchism.&lt;ref name="frenchexperimentation"/&gt;
[[File:Zo d'Axa portrait.jpg|180px|left|thumb|[[Zo d'Axa]], founder of French individualist anarchist magazine ''L'[[EnDehors]]'']]
[[Henri Zisly]], [[Emile Gravelle]] and Georges Butaud promoted [[anarchist naturism]].&lt;ref name="naturismo2" /&gt; Butaud was an individualist "partisan of the ''[[intentional communities|milieux libres]]'', publishing "Flambeau" ("an enemy of authority") in 1901 in [[Vienna]]. He focused on creating and participating in anarchist colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eskimo.com/~recall/bleed/0226.htm "1926 – France: Georges Butaud (1868–1926) dies, in Ermont."]&lt;/ref&gt;

"In this sense, the theoretical positions and the vital experiences of french individualism are deeply [[iconoclastic]] and scandalous, even within libertarian circles. The call of nudist [[naturism]], the strong defense of [[birth control]] methods, the idea of "[[Union of egoists|unions of egoists]]" with the sole justification of sexual practices, that will try to put in practice, not without difficulties, will establish a way of thought and action, and will result in sympathy within some, and a strong rejection within others."&lt;ref name="frenchexperimentation"&gt;[http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=2044944 "La insumisión voluntaria.

Influenced by Stirner's [[Ethical egoism|egoism]] as well as Proudhon's "property is theft", [[Clément Duval]] and [[Marius Jacob]] proposed the theory of la [[individual reclamation]].

Illegalism first rose to prominence among a generation of Europeans inspired by the unrest of the 1890s. [[Ravachol]], [[Émile Henry (anarchist)|Émile Henry]], [[Auguste Vaillant]], and [[Sante Geronimo Caserio|Caserio]] committed daring crimes in anarchism's name.&lt;ref name="illegalanticap"&gt;"Pre-World War I France was the setting for the only documented anarchist revolutionary movement to embrace all illegal activity as revolutionary practice. Pick-pocketing, theft from the workplace, robbery, confidence scams, desertion from the armed forces, you name it, illegalist activity was praised as a justifiable and necessary aspect of class struggle."[http://www.defenestrator.org/roblosricos/writings/illegalism.htm "Illegalism" by Rob los Ricos] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120083916/http://www.defenestrator.org/roblosricos/writings/illegalism.htm |date=November 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; France's [[Bonnot Gang]] was the most famous group to embrace illegalism.

==== Albert Libertad ====
{{main|Albert Libertad}}
[[File:Albert libertad.jpg|left|thumb|180px|[[Albert Libertad]], editor of the French individualist anarchist journal ''[[L'Anarchie]]'']]Joseph Albert (known as Albert Libertad or Libertad)&lt;ref&gt;Libertad, Le Culte de la charogne. Anarchisme, un état de révolution permanente (1897–1908), Éditions Agone, 2006. {{ISBN|2-7489-0022-7}} (see also [http://atheles.org/agone/memoiressociales/lecultedelacharogne/].&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[individualist anarchist]] militant and writer from France who edited the influential anarchist publication ''[[L'Anarchie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/l/i.htm#libertad "Libertad (1875–1908)" at marxists.org]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Dreyfus affair]], he founded the Anti-Militarist League (1902) "and, along with Paraf-Javal, founded the "Causeries populaires", public discussions that met with great interest throughout the country, contributing to the opening of a bookstore and various clubs in different quarters of Paris".&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Various_Authors__Articles_from__Machete___1.html#toc1 "Machete" #1. "Bonnot and the Evangelists"]&lt;/ref&gt; On the occasion of July 14 anniversary, ''[[L'Anarchie]]'' "printed and distributed the manifesto "The Bastille of Authority" in one hundred thousand copies. Along with feverish activity against the social order, Libertad was usually also organizing feasts, dances and country excursions, in consequence of his vision of anarchism as the "[[joy of living]]" and not as militant sacrifice and death instinct, seeking to reconcile the requirements of the individual (in his need for autonomy) with the need to destroy authoritarian society. In fact, Libertad overcame the false dichotomy between individual revolt and social revolution, stressing that the first is simply a moment of the second, certainly not its negation. Revolt can only be born from the specific tension of the individual, which, in expanding itself, can only lead to a project of social liberation. For Libertad, anarchism doesn't consist in living separated from any social context in some cold ivory tower or on some happy communitarian isle, nor in living in submission to social roles, putting off the moment when one puts one's ideas into practice to the bitter end, but in living as anarchists here and now, without any concessions, in the only way possible: by rebelling. And this is why, in this perspective, individual revolt and social revolution no longer exclude each other, but rather complement each other."&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"/&gt;

====Émile Armand====
{{main|Émile Armand}}
[[File:Emilearmand01.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[Émile Armand]]]]
Émile Armand was an influential French individualist anarchist, [[free love]]/[[polyamory]] and [[pacifist]]/[[antimilitarist]] propagandist and activist. He wrote for such anarchist magazines as ''[[L'Anarchie]]'' and ''[[EnDehors]]''. His thought was mainly influenced by such thinkers as Stirner, [[Benjamin Tucker]], and American [[Transcendentalism]]. Outside France he was an important influence in Spanish anarchist movements, above all in the individualist publications ''[[Iniciales]]'', ''Al Margen'' and ''Nosotros''.&lt;ref name="spain"/&gt; He defended the [[ido (language)|Ido]] [[constructed language]] over [[Esperanto]] with the help of José Elizalde.

Armand contrasted his IA with social anarchist currents, rejecting revolution. He argued that waiting for revolution meant delaying the enjoyment of liberty until the masses gained awareness and will. Instead he advocated living under one's own conditions in the present time, revolting against social conditioning in daily life and living with those with an [[Affinity group|affinity to oneself in accord to the values and desire they share]].&lt;ref name="lifeactivity"&gt;[http://www.spaz.org/~dan/individualist-anarchist/library/emile-armand/life-activity.html "Anarchist Individualism as a Life and Activity" by Emile Armand]&lt;/ref&gt; He says the individualist is a "presentist" and "he could not, without bad reasoning and illogic, think of sacrificing his being, or his having, to the coming of a state of things he will not [[Immediatism|immediately enjoy]]".&lt;ref name="immediatism"&gt;[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/worldwidemovements/armand.html "The future society" by Emile Armand]&lt;/ref&gt; He applies this rule to friendship, love, sexual encounters and economic transactions. He adheres to an ethics of [[reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity]] and advocated propagandizing one's values to enable association with others to improve the chances of self-realization.&lt;ref name="lifeactivity"/&gt;&lt;!--so...make noise so you can meet girls and achieve "self-realization". clever, and so French!--&gt;

Armand advocated [[free love]], [[naturism]] and [[polyamory]] in what he termed ''la camaraderie amoureuse''.&lt;ref name="armand"&gt;
Émile Armand and la camaraderie amourouse. [http://www.iisg.nl/womhist/manfreuk.pdf ''Revolutionary sexualism and the struggle against jealousy." by Francis Rousin]&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote many propagandist articles on this subject advocating not only a vague free love but also multiple partners, which he called "plural love."&lt;ref name="armand"/&gt; "'The camaraderie amoureuse thesis,' he explained, 'entails a free contract of association (that may be annulled without notice, following prior agreement) reached between anarchist individualists of different genders, adhering to the necessary standards of sexual hygiene, with a view toward protecting the other parties to the contract from certain risks of the amorous experience, such as rejection, rupture, exclusivism, possessiveness, unicity, coquetry, whims, indifference, flirtatiousness, disregard for others, and prostitution.'".&lt;ref name="armand"/&gt;

[[File:Han Ryner.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Han Ryner]]]]

Han Ryner was a French [[individualist anarchist]] philosopher and activist and a novelist.  He wrote for publications such as ''L'Art social'', ''L'Humanité nouvelle'', ''L'Ennemi du Peuple'', ''L'Idée Libre de Lorulot''; and ''L'En dehors'' and ''L'Unique''. His thought is mainly influenced by [[stoicism]] and [[epicureanism]].

He defines individualism as "the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, no tradition, no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience.".&lt;ref name="manual"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/ryner/1905/mini-manual.htm "Mini-Manual of Individualism" by Han Ryner]&lt;/ref&gt; He distinguishes "conquering and aggressive egoists who proclaim themselves to be individualists" from what he called "harmonic individualists" who respected others. He admired [[Epicurus]]' temperance and that "he showed that very little was needed to satisfy hunger and thirst, to defend oneself against heat and the cold. And he liberated himself from all other needs, that is, almost all the desires and all the fears that enslave men.".&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt; He celebrated how Jesus "lived free and a wanderer, foreign to any social ties. He was the enemy of priests, external cults and, in general, all organizations."&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt;

In 2002, an anarchist, Libertad organized a new version of the ''[[L'EnDehors]]'', collaborating with ''[[Green Anarchy]]'' and including contributors such as [[Lawrence Jarach]], [[Patrick Mignard]], [[Thierry Lodé]], [[Ron Sakolsky]], and Thomas Slut. Articles about capitalism, human rights, [[free love]] and social fights were published. ''The EnDehors'' continues now as a website, EnDehors.net.

The prolific contemporary French philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] has been writing from an individualist anarchist&lt;ref name="regards.fr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revue-interrogations.org"/&gt; perspective influenced by Nietzsche, French [[post-structuralists]] thinkers such as [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Gilles Deleuze]]; and Greek classical schools of philosophy such as the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]] and [[Cyrenaics]]. Among the books which best expose Onfray's individualist anarchist perspective include ''La sculpture de soi : la morale esthétique'' (The sculpture of oneself: aesthetic morality), ''La philosophie féroce : exercices anarchistes'', ''La puissance d'exister'' and ''Physiologie de Georges Palante, portrait d'un nietzchéen de gauche'' which focuses on French individualist philosopher [[Georges Palante]].

====Renzo Novatore====
{{main|Renzo Novatore}}
[[File:Novatore.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Renzo Novatore]]]]
Renzo Novatore was influenced by [[Stirner]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Georges Palante]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Henrik Ibsen]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and [[Charles Baudelaire]]. He collaborated in numerous anarchist journals and participated in [[futurism]] avant-garde currents.

He proclaimed "revolution is the fire of our will and a need of our solitary minds; it is an obligation of the libertarian aristocracy. To create new ethical values. To create new aesthetic values. To communalize material wealth. To individualize spiritual wealth. Because we violent celebralists and passional sentimentalists at the same time-understand and know that revolution is a necessity of the silent sorrow that suffers at the bottom and a need of the free spirits who suffer in the heights."&lt;ref name="creativenothing"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.novatore.it/Toward_nothing.htm |title="Towards the creative Nothing" by Renzo Novatore |access-date=May 21, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528004859/http://www.novatore.it/Toward_nothing.htm |archive-date=May 28, 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He summarizes the three options in life as "The stream of slavery, the stream of tyranny, the stream of freedom! With revolution, the last of these streams needs to burst upon the other two and overwhelm them. It needs to create spiritual beauty, teach the poor the shame of their poverty, and the rich the shame of their wealth."&lt;ref name="creativenothing"/&gt; These views justified his practice of illegalism and later active resistance to fascism.

Novatore collaborated in the individualist anarchist journal ''Iconoclasta!'' alongside the young Stirnerist illegalist [[Bruno Filippi]]&lt;ref name="wolfi"&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Bruno_Filippi__The_rebel_s_dark_laughter__the_writings_of_Bruno_Filippi.html ''The rebel's dark laughter: the writings of Bruno Filippi'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, a poet, Novatore belonged to the leftist section of the [[avant-garde]] movement of futurism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.novatore.it/Una_biografia.html |title=Novatore: una biografia |access-date=February 12, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722043805/http://www.novatore.it/Una_biografia.html |archive-date=July 22, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside others individualist anarchists such as [[Dante Carnesecchi]], [[Leda Rafanelli]], Auro d'Arcola, and Giovanni Governato.

==== Post-war and contemporary times ====
In Italy in 1945 during the Founding Congress of the [[Italian Anarchist Federation]], individualists anarchists were led by Cesare Zaccaria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ita.anarchopedia.org/Storia_del_movimento_libertario_in_Italia "Storia del movimento libertario in Italia" in anarchopedia in italian]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.katesharpleylibrary.net/73n6nh Cesare Zaccaria (August 19, 1897 – October 1961) Pier Carlo Masini and Paul Sharkey&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1965 IX Congress of the Italian Anarchist Federation in [[Carrara]] a splinter group created the ''Gruppi di Iniziativa Anarchica''. In the 1970s, it was mostly composed of "veteran individualist anarchists with an orientation of [[anarcho-pacifism|pacifism]], [[anarcho-naturism|naturism]], etc,...".&lt;ref&gt;"Los anarco-individualistas, G.I.A...Una escisión de la FAI producida en el IX Congreso (Carrara, 1965) se pr odujo cuando un sector de anarquistas de tendencia humanista rechazan la interpretación que ellos juzgan disciplinaria del ''pacto asociativo" clásico, y crean los GIA (Gruppi di Iniziativa Anarchica) .

Egoism had a strong influence on [[insurrectionary anarchism]], as can be seen in the work of [[Alfredo Bonanno]] and Michele Fabiani.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.anarchaos.it/?p=184 |title="Critica individualista anarchica alla modernità" by Michele Fabiani |access-date=February 16, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909052618/http://www.anarchaos.it/?p=184 |archive-date=September 9, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonanno has written on Stirner in works such as ''Max Stirner'' and "Max Stirner und der Anarchismus".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://raforum.info/spip.php?article330&amp;lang=fr |title=BONANNO, Alfredo Maria |access-date=February 16, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710093815/http://raforum.info/spip.php?article330&amp;lang=fr |archive-date=July 10, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the famous Italian insurrectionary anarchist anonymous essay, "At Daggers Drawn with the Existent, its Defenders and its False Critics" is "The workers who, during a wildcat strike, carried a banner saying, 'We are not asking for anything' understood that the defeat is in the claim itself ('the claim against the enemy is eternal').

===Spain===
Spanish individualist anarchists was influenced by American individualist anarchism but mainly it was connected to the French currents.&lt;ref name="frenchexperimentation"/&gt; At the turn of the 20th century people such as Dorado Montero, [[Ricardo Mella]], [[Federico Urales]], Mariano Gallardo and J. Elizalde translated French and American individualists.&lt;ref name="frenchexperimentation"/&gt; Important in this respect were also magazines such as ''La Idea Libre'', ''[[La Revista Blanca]]'', ''Etica'', ''[[Iniciales]]'', ''Al margen'', ''Estudios'' and ''Nosotros''. The most influential thinkers there were [[Stirner]], [[Émile Armand]] and [[Han Ryner]]. Just as in France, [[Esperanto]], [[anationalism]], anarcho-naturism and [[free love]] were present.&lt;ref name="frenchexperimentation"/&gt; Later Armand and Ryner started publishing in the Spanish individualist press. Armand's concept of amorous camaraderie had an important role in motivating [[polyamory]] as realization of the individual.&lt;ref name="frenchexperimentation"/&gt;

Recently historian Xavier Diez wrote on the subject in ''El anarquismo individualista en España: 1923–1938''&lt;ref name="spanish"&gt;
[http://www.cgt.es/fedens/El-anarquismo-individualista-en?lang=es Xavier Diez ''El anarquismo individualista en España.'' by Xavier Diez]&lt;/ref&gt; y ''Utopia sexual a la premsa anarquista de Catalunya.

There were also the cases of prominent individualist anarchists such as [[Federico Urales]] and [[Miguel Gimenez Igualada]] who were members of the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] and J. Elizalde who was a founding member and first secretary of the [[Iberian Anarchist Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Diez.

L'anarquisme Individualista a Espanya 1923–1938]&lt;/ref&gt; The individualist anarchism&lt;ref name="tesisenxarxa1923"/&gt; of Urales was influenced by [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Charles Darwin]]. He saw science and reason as a defense against blind servitude to authority. He was critical of influential individualist thinkers such as [[Nietzsche]] and [[Stirner]] for promoting an asocial egoist individualism and instead promoted an individualism with solidarity as a way to guarantee social equality and harmony.&lt;ref name="tesisenxarxa1923"/&gt; In the subject of organization he was highly critical of [[anarcho-syndicalism]] as he saw it plagued by too much bureaucracy and thought that it tended towards reformism.&lt;ref name="tesisenxarxa1923"/&gt; Instead he favored small groups based on ideological alignment.&lt;ref name="tesisenxarxa1923"/&gt; He supported the establishmente of the [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|Iberian Anarchist Federation (FAI)]] in 1927 and participated in it.&lt;ref name="tesisenxarxa1923"/&gt;

[[Jesús Huerta de Soto]] is a Spanish economist of the [[Austrian School]], professor in the Department of Applied Economics at [[King Juan Carlos University]] of Madrid, Senior Fellow at the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] and a reference of [[anarcho-capitalism]] in Spain. He has defended the theoretical superiority of anarcho-capitalism over [[classical liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jesús Huerta de Soto. ''Classical Liberalism versus Anarchocapitalism'' http://mises.org/library/classical-liberalism-versus-anarchocapitalism&lt;/ref&gt; In his work ''The Theory of Dynamic Efficiency'' he states that the analysis of the social reality must combine adequately three different standpoints: theoretical ([[Ludwig von Mises]]), historical-evolutionary ([[Friedrich Hayek]]), and ethical ([[Murray Rothbard]]).

He will propose the creation of a [[union of egoists]], which will be a Federation of Individualist Anarchists in Spain, but did not succeed.&lt;ref&gt;"A partir de la década de los treinta, su pensamiento empieza a derivar hacia el individualismo, y como profundo estirneriano tratará de impulsar una federación de individualistas"[http://www.acracia.org/xdiez.html "La insumisión voluntaira: El anarquismo individualista español durante la dictadura y la segunda reppública(1923–1938) por Xavier Diez] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526224800/http://www.acracia.org/xdiez.html |date=May 26, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 publishes an extensive treatise on Stirner which he dedicates to fellow individualist anarchist [[Émile Armand]]&lt;ref name="comyr1"&gt;[http://www.kclibertaria.comyr.com/lpdf/l147.pdf "Stirner" por Miguel Gimenez Igualada]&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards he will travel and live in Argentina, Uruguay and Mexico.&lt;ref name="tesisenxarxa.net"/&gt;

In his major work ''Anarchism''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kclibertaria.comyr.com/lpdf/l125.pdf ''Anarquismo'' by Miguel Gimenez Igualada]&lt;/ref&gt; Igualada states that "[[humanism]] or anarchism,...for me are the same thing".&lt;ref&gt;"humanismo o
anarquismo, que, para mí, son una y misma cosa." pg.36 [http://www.kclibertaria.comyr.com/lpdf/l125.pdf ''Anarquismo'' by Miguel Gimenez Igualada]&lt;/ref&gt; He sees the anarchist as one who "does not accept the imposition of a thought on us and who does not allows one's own thought to be imposed over another brain, oppressing it...since anarchy is not for me a mere negation, but a twofold activity of consciousness; in the first instance a consciousness of the individual on its meaning within the human world, defending his personality against every external imposition; on a second instance, and here is present the whole great beauty of its ethic, it defends, stimulates and enhances the other's personality....&lt;ref&gt;"a la de no aceptar que nos sea impuesto un pensamiento y a la de no permitir que un pensamiento nuestro pese sobre ningún cerebro, oprimiéndolo, es a lo que yo llamo anarquismo, ya que anarquía no es para mí sólo una negación, sino una doble actividad de la conciencia: por la primera, consciente el individuo de lo que es y significa en el concierto del mundo humano, defiende su personalidad contra toda exterior imposición; por la segunda, y aquí radica toda la gran belleza de su ética, defiende y ampara y estimula y realza la personalidad ajena, no queriendo imponérsele."[http://www.kclibertaria.comyr.com/lpdf/l125.pdf ''Anarquismo'' by Miguel Gimenez Igualada]&lt;/ref&gt; Igualada exposes a radical [[pacifist]] view when he thinks that "When I say that through war humanity will never find peace, I sustain my affirmation in the fact that those who are more peaceful are the least believers, and so...one can affirm that the day of happiness in which war (religiosity is bellicosity) is extirpated from consciousness, peace will exists in the home of men, and since from consciousness these beliefs will not be extracted but only through an act of transcendental education, our labor is not of killing, but of education having it well present that to educate is not in any case [[domestication]].&lt;ref&gt;"Cuando digo que por medio de la guerra no hallará nunca la paz la humanidad, fundamento mi afirmación en el hecho de que los más pacíficos son los menos creyentes, por lo que, deduciendo, se puede asegurar que el día feliz y dichoso en que el acto bélico (religiosidad es belicosidad) sea extirpado de las conciencias, la paz existirá en la casa del hombre, y como de las conciencias no se arrancan las creencias sino por un acto trascendentalmente educativo, nuestra labor no es de matanza, sino de educación, teniendo bien presente que educar no es en ningún caso
domesticar."[http://www.kclibertaria.comyr.com/lpdf/l125.pdf ''Anarquismo'' by Miguel Gimenez Igualada]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freethought ===
{{Main|Freethought}}
Freethought as a philosophical position and as activism was important in European individualist anarchism. "Anticlericalism, just as in the rest of the libertarian movement, in another of the frequent elements which will gain relevance related to the measure in which the (French) Republic begins to have conflicts with the church...Anti-clerical discourse, frequently called for by the French individualist [[André Lorulot]], will have its impacts in ''Estudios'' (a Spanish individualist anarchist publication). There will be an attack on institutionalized religion for the responsibility that it had in the past on negative developments, for its irrationality which makes it a counterpoint of philosophical and scientific progress. There will be a criticism of proselitism and ideological manipulation which happens on both believers and agnostics.".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120324044614/http://www.viruseditorial.net/pdf/anarquismo%20individualista.pdf Xavier Diez.

In the Spanish individualist anarchist magazine ''Ética'' and ''[[Iniciales]]'' "there is a strong interest in publishing scientific news, usually linked to a certain [[atheist]] and [[anti-theist]] obsession, philosophy which will also work for pointing out the incompatibility between science and religion, faith and reason. In this way there will be a lot of talk on Darwin's theories or on the negation of the existence of the soul.".&lt;ref name="viruseditorial.net"/&gt;

This relationship between anarchism and naturism was quite important at the end of the 1920s in Spain.&lt;ref name="naturismo.org"&gt;[http://www.naturismo.org/adn/ediciones/2003/invierno/7e.html "Anarchism – Nudism, Naturism" by Carlos Ortega at Asociacion para el Desarrollo Naturista de la Comunidad de Madrid. Published on Revista ''ADN''. Winter 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; "The linking role played by the 'Sol y Vida' group was very important. The goal of this group was to take trips and enjoy the open air. The Naturist athenaeum, 'Ecléctico', in Barcelona, was the base from which the activities of the group were launched. First ''Etica'' and then ''[[Iniciales]]'', which began in 1929, were the publications of the group, which lasted until the [[Spanish Civil War]]. We must be aware that the naturist ideas expressed in them matched the desires that the libertarian youth had of breaking up with the conventions of the bourgeoisie of the time. That is what a young worker explained in a letter to 'Iniciales' He writes it under the odd pseudonym of 'silvestre del campo', (wild man in the country). "I find great pleasure in being naked in the woods, bathed in light and air, two natural elements we cannot do without. By shunning the humble garment of an exploited person, (garments which, in my opinion, are the result of all the laws devised to make our lives bitter), we feel there no others left but just the natural laws. Clothes mean slavery for some and tyranny for others. Only the naked man who rebels against all norms, stands for anarchism, devoid of the prejudices of outfit imposed by our money-oriented society."".&lt;ref name="naturismo.org"/&gt; "The relation between Anarchism and Naturism gives way to the Naturist Federation, in July 1928, and to the lV Spanish Naturist Congress, in September 1929, both supported by the Libertarian Movement. However, in the short term, the Naturist and Libertarian movements grew apart in their conceptions of everyday life. The Naturist movement felt closer to the Libertarian individualism of some French theoreticians such as Henri Ner than to the revolutionary goals proposed by some Anarchist organisations such as the FAI, ([[Federación Anarquista Ibérica]])".&lt;ref name="naturismo.org"/&gt;

==== Individualist anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche ====
{{See also|Anarchism_and_Friedrich_Nietzsche#Individualist_anarchism}}
The thought of German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] has been influential in individualist anarchism specifically in thinkers such as the French [[Émile Armand]],&lt;ref&gt;"The life of Émile Armand (1872–1963) spanned the history of anarchism. He was influenced by Leo Tolstoy and Benjamin Tucker, and to a lesser extent by Whitman and Emerson. Later in life, Nietzsche and Stirner became important to his way of thinking."[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Emile_Armand__The_Anarchism_of_Emile_Armand.html Introduction to ''The Anarchism of Émile Armand'' by [[Emile Armand]]]&lt;/ref&gt; the Italian [[Renzo Novatore]],&lt;ref name="novatore"&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Renzo_Novatore__Toward_the_Creative_Nothing.html ''Toward the Creative Nothing'' by [[Renzo Novatore]]]&lt;/ref&gt; the Russian [[Lev Chernyi]],&lt;ref name=Avrich180&gt;{{Harvnb|Avrich|2006|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Colombians|Colombian]] [[Biofilo Panclasta]], and also "translations of Nietzsche's writings in the United States very likely appeared first in ''Liberty'', the anarchist journal edited by [[Benjamin Tucker]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://learning.berkeley.edu/robertholub/research/ Robert C.

====John Henry Mackay====
{{main|John Henry Mackay}}
In Germany the Scottish-born German John Henry Mackay became the most important individualist anarchist propagandist. He fused Stirnerist egoism with the positions of Benjamin Tucker and translated Tucker into German. Two semi-fictional writings of his own ''[[Die Anarchisten]]'' and ''[[Der Freiheitsucher]]'' contributed to individualist theory, updating egoist themes with respect to the anarchist movement. His writing were translated into English as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/tariley.html "New England Anarchism in Germany" by Thomas A. Riley] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/660zyRMXN?url=http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/tariley.html |date=2012-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mackay is also an important European early activist for [[LGBT]] rights.

{{Main|Adolf Brand|Der Eigene}}
Adolf Brand (1874–1945) was a German writer, Stirnerist [[Anarchism|anarchist]] and pioneering [[campaigner]] for the acceptance of male [[bisexuality]] and homosexuality. Brand published the world's first ongoing homosexual publication, ''[[Der Eigene]]'' in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] had begun a journal called ''Prometheus'' in 1870, but only one issue was published. Kennedy, Hubert, ''Karl Heinrich Ulrichs: First Theorist of Homosexuality'', In: 'Science and Homosexualities', ed. Vernon Rosario (pp. 26–45). New York: Routledge, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The name was taken from Stirner, who had greatly influenced the young Brand, and refers to Stirner's concept of "[[self-ownership]]" of the individual. ''[[Der Eigene]]'' concentrated on cultural and scholarly material, and may have averaged around 1500 subscribers per issue during its lifetime. Contributors included [[Erich Mühsam]], [[Kurt Hiller]], [[John Henry Mackay]] (under the pseudonym Sagitta) and artists [[Wilhelm von Gloeden]], [[Fidus]] and [[Sascha Schneider]]. Brand contributed many poems and articles himself. [[Benjamin Tucker]] followed this journal from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"Among the egoist papers that Tucker followed were the German [[Der Eigene]], edited by [[Adolf Brand]]..."http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=796&amp;Itemid=259 "Benjamin Tucker and Liberty: A Bibliographical Essay" by Wendy McElroy&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Anselm Ruest (Ernst Samuel) and Mynona (Salomo Friedlaender) ====
{{Main|Der Einzige}}
''Der Einzige'' was the title of a German [[individualist anarchist]] magazine. It appeared in 1919, as a weekly, then sporadically until 1925 and was edited by cousins Anselm Ruest (pseud. for Ernst Samuel) and Mynona (pseud. for [[Salomo Friedlaender]]). Its title was adopted from the book ''Der Einzige und sein Eigentum'' (engl. trans. ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'') by [[Max Stirner]]. Another influence was the thought of German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantin Parvulescu.

===Russia===
Individualist anarchism was one of the three categories of [[anarchism in Russia]], along with the more prominent [[anarchist communism]] and [[anarcho-syndicalism]].&lt;ref name=avruss&gt;{{Citation | authorlink=Paul Avrich |last = Avrich | first = Paul | title = [[The Russian Anarchists]] | publisher = [[AK Press]] | location = Stirling | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-904859-48-8 |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ranks of the Russian individualist anarchists were predominantly drawn from the [[intelligentsia]] and the working class.&lt;ref name=avruss/&gt; For anarchist historian [[Paul Avrich]] "The two leading exponents of individualist anarchism, both based in Moscow, were [[Alexei Borovoi|Aleksei Alekseevich Borovoi]] and [[Lev Chernyi]] (Pavel Dmitrievich Turchaninov). From [[Nietzsche]], they inherited the desire for a complete overturn of all values accepted by bourgeois societypolitical, moral, and cultural. Furthermore, strongly influenced by [[Max Stirner]] and [[Benjamin Tucker]], the German and American theorists of individualist anarchism, they demanded the total liberation of the human personality from the fetters of organized society."&lt;ref name=avruss/&gt;

Some Russian [[Illegalism|individualists anarchists "found the ultimate expression of their social alienation in violence and crime]], others attached themselves to avant-garde literary and artistic circles, but the majority remained [[Philosophical anarchism|"philosophical" anarchists]] who conducted animated parlor discussions and elaborated their individualist theories in ponderous journals and books."&lt;ref name=avruss/&gt;

==== Lev Chernyi ====
{{Main|Lev Chernyi}}
[[Lev Chernyi]] was an important individualist anarchist involved in resistance against the rise to power of the Bolchevik Party. He adhered mainly to Stirner and the ideas of [[Benjamin Tucker]]. In 1907, he published a book entitled ''Associational Anarchism'', in which he advocated the "free association of independent individuals.".&lt;ref name="chernyi"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/libertarians.html |title="Prominent Anarchists and Left-Libertarians" |access-date=May 21, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028163000/http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/libertarians.html |archive-date=October 28, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On his return from Siberia in 1917 he enjoyed great popularity among Moscow workers as a lecturer. Chernyi was also Secretary of the Moscow Federation of Anarchist Groups, which was formed in March 1917.&lt;ref name="chernyi"/&gt; He was an advocate "for the seizure of private homes",&lt;ref name="chernyi"/&gt; which was an activity seen by the anarchists after the October revolution as direct expropriation on the bourgoise. He died after being accused of participation in an episode in which this group bombed the headquarters of the Moscow Committee of the Communist Party. Although most likely not being really involved in the bombing, he might have died of torture.&lt;ref name="chernyi"/&gt;

Chernyi advocated a [[Nietzschean]] [[transvaluation of values|overthrow of the values]] of bourgeois Russian society, and rejected the voluntary [[Mir (social)|communes]] of [[anarcho-communist]] [[Peter Kropotkin]] as a threat to the freedom of the individual.&lt;ref name="Avrich180"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Avrich|2006|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aa&gt;{{Citation |last=Chernyi |first=Lev |title=Novoe Napravlenie v Anarkhizme: Asosiatsionnii Anarkhism |origyear=1907 |edition=Moscow; 2nd |year=1923 |publisher=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars including Avrich and Allan Antliff have interpreted this vision of society to have been greatly influenced by the [[individualist anarchist]]s [[Max Stirner]], and [[Benjamin Tucker]].&lt;ref name=sub&gt;{{Citation |last=Antliff |first=Allan |year=2007 |title=Anarchy, Power, and Poststructuralism |journal=SubStance |volume=36 |issue=113 |pages=56–66 |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/substance/v036/36.2antliff.pdf |accessdate=March 10, 2008 |doi=10.1353/sub.2007.0026 |ref=harv |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent to the book's publication, Chernyi was imprisoned in [[Siberia]] under the Russian [[Czar]]ist regime for his revolutionary activities.&lt;ref name=match&gt;{{Citation|last=Phillips |first=Terry |date=Fall 1984 |journal=[[The Match!]] |url=http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/ChernyiLev.htm |issue=79 |accessdate=March 10, 2008 |title=Lev Chernyi |ref=harv |postscript=. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211173334/http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/ChernyiLev.htm |archivedate=February 11, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Rooum]] is an English anarchist [[cartoonist]] and writer with a long association with [[Freedom Press]]. Rooum stated that for his thought "The most influential source is [[Max Stirner]]. I am happy to be called a Stirnerite anarchist, provided 'Stirnerite' means one who agrees with Stirner's general drift, not one who agrees with Stirner's every word."&lt;ref&gt;Donald Rooum: ''Anarchism and Selfishness.'' In: The Raven. Anarchist Quarterly (London), vol. 1, n. 3 (nov. 1987), pp. 251–259 (here 259)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'' reports that "From meeting anarchists in Glasgow during the Second World War, long-time anarchist activist and artist Donald Rooum likewise combined Stirner and anarcho-communism." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionG6 "G.6.

In the hybrid of [[post-structuralism]] and anarchism called [[post-anarchism]] the British [[Saul Newman]] has written a lot on Stirner and his similarities to post-structuralism. He writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Max Stirner's impact on contemporary political theory is often neglected. However in Stirner's political thinking there can be found a surprising convergence with poststructuralist theory, particularly with regard to the function of power. [[Andrew Koch]], for instance, sees Stirner as a thinker who transcends the Hegelian tradition he is usually placed in, arguing that his work is a precursor poststructuralist ideas about the foundations of knowledge and truth.&lt;ref name="newman"&gt;

==== Oscar Wilde ====
{{Main|Oscar Wilde}}
The Irish [[anarchism|anarchist]] writer of the [[Decadent movement]] [[Oscar Wilde]] influenced individualist anarchists such as [[Renzo Novatore]]&lt;ref&gt;"We must kill the christian philosophy in the most radical sense of the word. How much mostly goes sneaking inside the democratic civilization (this most cynically ferocious form of christian depravity) and it goes more towards the categorical negation of human Individuality. "Democracy! By now we have comprised it that it means all that says Oscar Wilde Democracy is the people who govern the people with blows of the club for love of the people"." "Towards the Hurricane" by [[Renzo Novatore]]&lt;/ref&gt; and gained the admiration of [[Benjamin Tucker]].&lt;ref&gt;"When Oscar Wilde's plea for penal reform, The Ballad of Reading Gaol, was widely criticized, Tucker enthusiastically endorsed the poem, urging all of his subscribers to read it. Tucker, in fact, published an American edition. From its early championing of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass to a series of short stories by Francis du Bosque in its last issues, ''Liberty'' was a vehicle of controversial, avant-garde literature."[http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1300&amp;chapter=100896&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 "Benjamin Tucker, Individualism, &amp; Liberty: Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order" by Wendy McElroy]&lt;/ref&gt; In his important essay ''[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]'' from 1891 he defended socialism as the way to guarantee individualism and so he saw that "With the abolition of private property, then, we shall have true, beautiful, healthy Individualism.  Nobody will waste his life in accumulating things, and the symbols for things.  One will live.  To live is the rarest thing in the world.  Most people exist, that is all."&lt;ref&gt;[http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/hist_texts/wilde_soul.html The soul of man under Socialism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914032335/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/hist_texts/wilde_soul.html |date=September 14, 2013 }} by [[Oscar Wilde]]&lt;/ref&gt; For anarchist historian [[George Woodcock]] "Wilde's aim in ''The Soul of Man under Socialism'' is to seek the society most favorable to the artist...for Wilde art is the supreme end, containing within itself enlightenment and regeneration, to which all else in society must be subordinated...Wilde represents the anarchist as [[aesthete]]."&lt;ref name="autogenerated447"&gt;[[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements.'' 1962. (pg. 447)&lt;/ref&gt; Woodocock finds that "The most ambitious contribution to literary anarchism during the 1890s was undoubtedly Oscar Wilde ''The Soul of Man under Socialism''" and finds that it is influenced mainly by the thought of William Godwin.&lt;ref name="autogenerated447"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13810">'''Jean-François Papillon''' (died in the early 1800s) was one of the principal leaders in the [[Haitian Revolution]] against slavery and French rule. He led the initial uprising of enslaved workers and later allied with Spain against the French.

He was born in Africa but [[slavery|enslaved]] and taken in captivity to the North Province of [[Saint-Domingue]] (the future nation of [[Haiti]]). There he worked in the plantation of Papillon in the last decades of the 18th Century. He escaped from that plantation and became a [[Maroon (people)|maroon]], so when the revolution started in August 1791 he had already enjoyed a direct experience of freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saint-Rémy|first=Joseph|title=Mémoires du général Toussaint L'Ouverture, écrits par lui même|year=1850|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ascent to power ==

Right after the tragic death of [[Dutty Boukman|Boukman Dutty]], the insurgent slaves’ first leader, Jean-François Papillon imposed his authority over the other black generals, especially [[Georges Biassou]], Jeannot Bullet and Toussaint Bréda (later [[Toussaint Louverture]]), and became commander-in-chief of the Haitian former slaves.   By late 1791, some weeks after the revolutionary outbreak, Jean-François and Biassou set their rivalry aside in order to oppose Jeannot, who not only massacred the French but also all the black soldiers that contested his authority. For that reason, Biassou and Jean-François arrested and executed him by November 1791.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dalmas|first=M.|title=Histoire de la Révolution de Saint-Domingue, depuis le commencement des troubles, jusqu'à la prise de Jérémie et du Mole S.

It has often been assumed that Jean-François and his men rose up in rebellion to win universal freedom, but their real intention was to gain as much power as possible and return the rest of the slaves to the plantations when the revolution was over and the generals had already achieved power. Jean-François confessed his convictions to the North American agents in Le [[Cap-Haïtien|Cap Français]]: “[...] that General told us that he had not created himself General of the negroes, that those who had that power had confered [sic] upon him that title; that in taking up arms, he never pretended to fight for General Liberty, which he knew to be an illusion”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Archives and Record Administration (NARA), Record Group (RG) 59, M 9, Dispatches from the United States Consuls in Cap Haïtien, 1797-1906, Roll (R.) 1/1797-1799, "Observations on the French Part of Hispaniola and the West India Islands worth perhaps to be noticed by the Government of the United States of America"|year=1797|location=[Le Cap]|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation with Spain ==

There are many chances that the Spaniards backed the Haitian revolution from the beginning, providing the insurgents with food and weapons: they knew that the episode would cause chaos in Saint-Domingue, giving Spain the chance to send troops to that territory and re-annex it, since it had been a Spanish possession taken by the French in the [[Treaty of Ryswick|Peace Treaty of Ryswick]] (1697). In October 1791, the black General Toussaint Bréda admitted his contacts with the Spaniards, who had promised them provisions.  As Spain was officially neutral towards the [[French revolution]], of which Saint-Domingue’s revolution was regarded as a mere echo, it kept its contacts with the black leaders in secret.

Spain’s attitude changed from late January 1793, when the [[National Convention|French National Convention]] executed [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]. From then on, the Spanish government considered that it was unnecessary to stay officially neutral towards France and both countries declared war on each other in March 1793. As a consequence, [[Charles IV of Spain]] issued his instructions to the Dominican authorities, which needed to begin official dealings with Saint-Domingue’s black generals to persuade them to join the Dominican army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Archivo General de Simancas (AGS), Secretaría del Despacho de Guerra (SGU), box (b.) 7157, expedient (e.) 22, document (d.) 343.

Negotiations, which were carried out by the mulatto priest José Vázquez, finished on May 6, 1793 with Jean-François’ oath of loyalty to the Spanish King in his name and in the name of his soldiers. The said oath was confirmed by Jean-François some days later, in an official letter addressed to the Dominican Archbishop, [[Fernando del Portillo y Torres]]. Nevertheless, the slave leaders made it clear that they did not support the Spanish King as an end in itself, but as a means of avenging the French King, the Spanish sovereign’s cousin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=AGS, SGU, b. 7157, e. 22, d. 368. Jean-François' letter to the Dominican Archbishop, transmitting his oath of loyalty to the Spanish Crown|date=May 28, 1793|location=La Mine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Triumphs and problems at the service of Spain ==

Jean-François and his collaborators became [[Charles IV of Spain|Carlos IV]]’s black auxiliary troops, since the colour of their skin prevented the Spaniards from considering them part of the colonial regular army. Their alliance to Spain was crucial for the Spanish army to make important progress in Hispaniola against the French, conquering important positions like [[Gonaïves]], [[Gros-Morne, Haiti|Gros-Morne]], [[Plaisance, Nord|Plaisance]], Acul, [[Limbé, Nord|Limbé]], [[Port-Margot]], [[Borgne]], Petit-Saint-Louis and [[Terre-Neuve, Artibonite|Terre-Neuve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ardouin|first=Beaubrun|title=Études sur l'histoire d'Haïti, vol. II|year=1853|publisher=Dezobry et E. Magdeleine, Lib. Éditeurs, Rue des Maçons-Sorbonne|location=Paris|pages=328–329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there had always existed a strong tension between Jean-François and Biassou that led to an armed confrontation in September 1793. Both generals confronted each other and the French took advantage of the instability within the black auxiliaries to re-conquer the Tannerie fort, recently occupied by Jean-François’ troops. That episode convinced the Dominican government of the necessity to put an end to the internal tension of the black army, which was achieved thanks to the intervention of the Dominican Brigadier [[Matías de Armona]], who persuaded them to meet in [[Dondon]] and come to an agreement by late November 1793.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=AGS, SGU, b. 7157, e. 22, d. 466. Jean-François' letter to José Vázquez, telling him about the agreement with Biassou|date=November 17, 1793|location=Dondon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following weeks, the black auxiliaries achieved many other victories at the service of Spain, especially the conquest of Port Margot at the beginning in 1794, which earned them several golden and silver medals given by the Spanish Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Victoria Ojeda|first=Jorge|title=De "libertad, excepciones, goces y prerrogativas".

== Bayajá ==

The prestige of the black auxiliaries started to decay in July 1794, after the massacre of Bayajá. This place had been a French possession ([[Fort-Liberté|Fort Dauphin]]) until the Spaniards conquered it in January 1794. At that moment, the authorities of the village asked the Spaniards to not let Jean-François’ troops enter the place in the future, because they were afraid that the latter would massacre them, provided that most of its inhabitants were the former owners of Jean-François’ collaborators, and also that one of the officers that surrendered the city to Spain was the mulato Candy, Jean-François’ former subordinate that had deserted to the French camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ardouin|first=Beaubrun|title=Études sur l'histoire d'Haïti, vol. II|year=1853|publisher=Dezobry et E. Magdeleine, Lib. Éditeurs, Rue des Maçons-Sorbonne|location=Paris|pages=410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the described circumstances, on July 7, 1794 Jean-François entered the place with his troops and massacred the French inhabitants, mostly, though many Spaniards died also in the episode. The Spanish garrison of the place did not interfere to stop the killing, for which they were criticised by other foreign governments that even accused Spain of supporting the killing from the shadow.

From that moment on, not only did the Spaniards realise that the black auxiliaries were dangerous, but they also prevented them from taking part in any other important campaign in the future, so that such abuses would not occur again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geggus|first=David|title=Haitian Revolutionary Studies|year=2002|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington &amp; Indianapolis|pages=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basel and the diaspora of the auxiliaries ==

The Spaniards’ awareness of the black auxiliaries’ “natural savagery” as well as Santo Domingo’s cession to France in the [[Peace of Basel|Peace Treaty of Basel]], persuaded them to get rid of Jean-François and his troops, since the circumstances that had justified their alliance to the former slaves, that is, Spain’s plan to conquer the western part of Hispaniola, had failed.

First, Jean-François and his main collaborators were taken to [[Havana]]. But the Cuban governor, [[Luis de las Casas]], was so afraid that their presence there would provoke a massive black insurrection in that island, that he pressured the Spanish government to throw them out of his colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Archivo General de Indias (AGI), Estado (E.), e. 24, d. 1. Luis de las Casas' report about the arrival of Jean-François|date=January 8, 1796|location=La Habana}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geggus|first=David|title=Haitian Revolutionary Studies|year=2002|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington &amp; Indianapolis|pages=183–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1796 they arrived to the Spanish city of [[Cadiz|Cádiz]], where they were kept almost as prisoners. Their situation in that city was dramatic: the generals lost their military ranks and their right to any economic compensation after their retirement and, in addition, Jean-François had to use the few resources he had to assist his family and his companions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geggus|first=David|title=Haitian Revolutionary Studies|year=2002|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington &amp; Indianapolis|pages=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1813, the Spanish Council of Regency decided to throw them out of that city and take them to the Coast of the Flies. Unfortunately, Jean-François never saw the resolution of the conflict that concerned his troops, as he had already died in the early days of the 19th Century, maybe in 1805, totally forgotten by the Spanish government, which “rewarded” him for his loyal services by denying any official link with him or any other slave general in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Victoria Ojeda|first=Jorge|title=De "libertad, excepciones, goces y prerrogativas".

[[File:Jimmy Savile PICT6249a gaussian blur.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Savile in July 2006, attending the [[Highland games]] in [[Lochaber]]]]
'''[[Jimmy Savile]]''' (1926&amp;ndash;2011) was an English media personality who was well known in the United Kingdom for his eccentricities and, at the time of his death, was generally respected for his charitable work. He was [[knighthood|knighted]] in 1990. In late 2012, almost a year after his death, reports surfaced indicating that Savile had committed [[sexual abuse]] throughout his 50-year career, his alleged victims ranging from [[Puberty|prepubescent]] girls and boys to adults.&lt;!--following a 2007 police interview and 2008 allegations by ''The Sun''--&gt;

By 11 October 2012, allegations had been made to thirteen British [[List of police forces of the United Kingdom|police forces]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Martin |last=Evans |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9601922/Sir-Jimmy-Savile-fourth-British-TV-personality-accused-in-sex-allegations.html |title=Sir Jimmy Savile: fourth British TV personality accused in sex allegations |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location =London |date=11 October 2012 |accessdate=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the setting-up of inquiries into practices at the [[BBC]] and within the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]]. On 19 October 2012, [[London]]'s [[Metropolitan Police Service]] launched a formal criminal investigation, [[Operation Yewtree]], into historic allegations of [[child sexual abuse]] by Savile and other individuals, some still living, over four decades. The Metropolitan Police stated that it was pursuing over 400 lines of inquiry, based on the claims of 200 witnesses, via fourteen police forces across the UK. It described the alleged abuse as being "on an unprecedented scale", and the number of potential victims as "staggering".&lt;ref name="bbc191012"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20006049 |title=Savile abuse claims: Met Police launch criminal inquiry |publisher=BBC News |date=19 October 2012 |accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph 191012"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/jimmy-savile/9620149/Jimmy-Savile-police-launch-criminal-investigation-after-victims-claim-some-abusers-are-still-alive.html |title=Jimmy Savile: police launch criminal investigation after victims claim some abusers are still alive |work=The Daily Telegraph |location =London |date=19 October 2012 |accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 19 December, eight people had been questioned as part of the investigation. The Met stated that the total number of alleged victims was 589, of whom 450 alleged abuse by Savile.&lt;ref name=bbc111212&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20686219 |publisher= BBC News |title= Savile abuse part of Operation Yewtree probe 'complete' |date= 11 December 2012 |accessdate= 11 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc121212&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20697738 |publisher= BBC News |title= Jimmy Savile abuse: Number of alleged victims reaches 450 |date=12 December 2012 |accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report of the investigations undertaken jointly by the police and the [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]] (NSPCC), ''[[Giving Victims a Voice]]'', was published on 11 January 2013. It reported allegations covering a period of 50 years, including 214 alleged acts by Savile which, though uncorroborated, have been formally recorded as crimes, some involving children as young as eight. The report states "within the recorded crimes there are 126 indecent acts and 34 [[sex offence|rape/penetration offences]]."&lt;ref name="Giving Victims a Voice"/&gt; Alleged offences took place at thirteen hospitals as well as on BBC premises, according to the report.&lt;ref name="Giving Victims a Voice"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nspcc.org.uk/news-and-views/our-news/child-protection-news/13-01-11-yewtree-report/yewtree-report-pdf_wdf93652.pdf |title=Giving Victims a Voice |publisher=Crown Prosecution Service |date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc110113&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20981611 |publisher= BBC News |title= Jimmy Savile scandal: Report reveals extent of abuse |date=11 January 2013 |accessdate=11 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013 it was announced that inquiries had been extended to other hospitals.&lt;ref name="bbc 24520001"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24520001 |publisher= BBC News |title= NHS Savile abuse probe widened|date=14 October 2013 |accessdate=14 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 June 2014, the [[Secretary of State for Health]], [[Jeremy Hunt (politician)|Jeremy Hunt]], reported on the findings of the investigations led by [[Kate Lampard]]. He said that Savile had sexually assaulted victims aged between 5 and 75 in NHS hospitals, and he apologised to the victims.&lt;ref name=bbc260614&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-28034427 |publisher= BBC News |title= Jimmy Savile NHS abuse victims aged five to 75 |date=26 June 2014 |accessdate=30 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further investigations, in hospitals and elsewhere, led to additional allegations of sexual abuse by Savile.

Much of Savile's career involved working with children and young people, including visiting schools and hospital wards. He spent 20 years presenting ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' before a teenage audience, and an overlapping 20 years presenting ''[[Jim'll Fix It]]'', in which he helped the wishes of viewers, mainly children, come true. During his lifetime, two police investigations had looked into reports about Savile, the earliest known being in 1958, but none had led to charges; the reports had each concluded that there was insufficient evidence for any charges to be brought related to sexual offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-19802630 |title=Jimmy Savile named in Jersey children's home abuse inquiry |publisher= BBC News |date=2 October 2012 |accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Sam |last1=Marsden |first2=Richard |last2=Alleyne |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/9578870/Jimmy-Savile-interviewed-under-caution-over-indecent-assault-allegation.html |title=Jimmy Savile interviewed under caution over indecent assault allegation |work=The Daily Telegraph |location =London |date=1 October 2012 |accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mendick |first=Robert |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/jimmy-savile/9606494/Jimmy-Savile-police-officers-repeatedly-failed-sex-victims.html |title=Jimmy Savile: police officers repeatedly failed sex victims |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location= London |date=13 October 2012 |accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012 it was announced that the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]], [[Keir Starmer]], would investigate why proceedings against Savile in 2009 were dropped.

The scandal was a major factor leading to the establishment of the wider-ranging [[Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse]] which was announced by then-[[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]] in July 2014. In February 2015, the inquiry was reconfigured as a [[statutory inquiry]] to be chaired by [[Judge|Justice]] [[Lowell Goddard]].

==Background==
[[Jimmy Savile]] claimed the key to his success on ''[[Jim'll Fix It]]'' had been that he disliked children, although he later admitted to saying it to deflect scrutiny of his private life. He did not own a computer as, he claimed, he did not want people to think he was downloading [[child pornography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8857428/Sir-Jimmy-Savile.html |title=Sir Jimmy Savile |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location= London |date=29 October 2011 |accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1990 interview for ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'', [[Lynn Barber]] asked him about rumours that he liked "little girls". Savile said: &lt;blockquote&gt;"...the young girls in question don't gather round me because of me – it's because I know the people they love, the stars...  I am of no interest to them."&lt;ref name=lynnbarberinterview&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/lynn-barber-i-was-nervous-when-i-told-jimmy-savile-people-say-you-like-little-girls-8193169.html |title=Lynn Barber: I was nervous when I told Jimmy Savile, 'People say you like little girls' |first=Lynn |last= Barber| work= Independent on Sunday |location =London |date=2 October 2012 |accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In April 2000, Savile was the subject of an in-depth documentary&lt;ref name="observer2014mar23"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2014/mar/23/louis-theroux-inhabit-intimate-space-jimmy-savile |title=Louis Theroux: 'You get to inhabit quite an intimate space' |newspaper=The Guardian |date=22 March 2014 |accessdate=20 March 2015 |last=Lewis |first=Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Louis Theroux]], in the ''[[When Louis Met...]]'' series. In it, Theroux asked about rumours he was a [[pedophilia|paedophile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Jonathan |last=Jones |url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/04/jimmy-savile-hiding-in-the-light |title= Jimmy Savile was hiding in the light |newspaper=The Guardian |date=4 October 2012 |accessdate=11 October 2012 |location =London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savile said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/culture/2012/10/when-louis-asked-jimmy-about-being-paedophile |title=When Louis asked Jimmy about being a paedophile |first=Alex |last=Hern| newspaper=[[New Statesman]] |location =London |date=3 October 2012 |accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"[We] live in a very funny world. And it's easier for me, as a single man, to say "I don't like children" because that puts a lot of salacious tabloid people off the hunt.... How do they know whether I am [a paedophile] or not?

Broadcaster and journalist Orla Barry, on the Irish radio station [[Newstalk]] in 2007, asked Savile about allegations aired during the original Theroux documentary. When asked about the paedophilia rumours, Savile responded, "What rumours?".{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} In 2012, Barry expressed surprise that other journalists had not pursued the matter, saying, "Maybe in the UK they were slightly closer to him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Niamh |last=Horan |url= http://www.independent.ie/national-news/i-dont-know-why-nobody-took-him-on-sooner-barry-3258561.html |title=I don't know why nobody took him on sooner – Barry |newspaper=Sunday Independent |location =Dublin |date=14 October 2012 |accessdate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Savile was interviewed [[Right to silence in England and Wales|under caution]] by police investigating an allegation of indecent assault at the now-closed [[Approved School|Duncroft Approved School for Girls]] near [[Staines]], [[Surrey]] in the 1970s, when he was a regular visitor.

In March 2008, Savile started legal proceedings against ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, which had linked him in several articles to child abuse at the [[Jersey]] children's home [[Jersey child abuse investigation 2008|Haut de la Garenne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thelawyer.com/jimmy-savile-turns-to-fox-hayes-for-action-against-the-sun/131780.article |title= Jimmy Savile turns to Fox Hayes for action against The Sun |work=The Lawyer |author= Goswami, Nina |location =London |date=17 March 2008 |accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savile denied visiting Haut de la Garenne, but admitted doing so after a photograph was published showing him at the home surrounded by children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Richard |last=Alleyne |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9583373/Sir-Jimmy-Savile-He-raped-me-as-a-teenager-claims-woman.html |title=Sir Jimmy Savile: He raped me as a teenager claims woman |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location =London |date=3 October 2012|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[States of Jersey Police]] said an allegation of indecent assault by Savile at the home in the 1970s had been investigated in 2008, but there had been insufficient evidence to proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-19802630 |title= Jimmy Savile named in Jersey children's home abuse inquiry |publisher=BBC News |date=2 October 2012 |accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aborted ''Newsnight'' report===

Savile died on 29 October 2011, aged 84. At the time of his death and the funeral in [[Leeds Cathedral]], he was widely praised for his charity and voluntary activities as well as his entertainment work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15507374 |title=DJ and TV presenter Jimmy Savile dies, aged 84 |publisher=BBC News |date=29 October 2011 |accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-15647363 |title=Sir Jimmy Savile's funeral takes place at Leeds Cathedral |publisher=BBC News |date=9 November 2011 |accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after Savile's death, [[Meirion Jones]] and [[Liz Mackean]] from the [[BBC]] programme ''[[Newsnight]]'' began to investigate reports that he had sexually abused children. They interviewed one alleged victim on camera and talked to a number of others who were willing to be quoted about alleged abuse at Duncroft Approved School, the BBC, and [[Stoke Mandeville Hospital]]. The former headmistress of Duncroft was Jones' own aunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/jimmy-savile/9623803/Jimmy-Savile-Newsnight-producer-is-nephew-of-abuse-school-headmistress.html|title=Jimmy Savile: Newsnight producer is nephew of abuse school headmistress |date=21 October 2012|work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Newsnight'' team, which included former police detective [[Mark Williams-Thomas]], also found out about a 2009 [[Surrey Police]] investigation into Savile. The report was scheduled for broadcast on 7 December 2011, but a decision was taken to cancel its transmission, which ultimately developed into a major crisis for the BBC when the allegations against Savile were made public in October 2012. The subsequent [[Nick Pollard|Pollard Review]] found that Jones and MacKean had assembled cogent evidence that Savile had a history of abusing young women and ''Newsnight'' had been in a position to break the story in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC releases Pollard report into axed Jimmy Savile Newsnight investigation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/dec/19/bbc-report-jimmy-savile-newsnight|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, the ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' reported that ''Newsnight'' had investigated allegations of sexual abuse immediately after Savile's death but that the report had been shelved.&lt;ref name ="timeline"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jimmy Savile: timeline of his sexual abuse and its uncovering|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jun/26/jimmy-savile-sexual-abuse-timeline|first=Josh|last=Halliday|newspaper=The Guardian|date=26 June 2014|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article by [[Miles Goslett]] in the March 2012 edition of ''[[The Oldie]]'' alleged a cover-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Oldie scoop that exposed Jimmy Savile|url=https://www.theoldie.co.uk/blog/savile-row-1|first=Miles|last=Goslett|newspaper=The Oldie|date=5 March 2018|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC showed two Savile tributes over the 2011 [[Christmas]] period, and it was alleged that the ''Newsnight'' report had been dropped because its content would have compromised the showing of the tributes. A joint submission to the [[Leveson Inquiry#Witnesses|Leveson Inquiry]] from Anna van Heeswijk (Object), Jacqui Hunt ([[Equality Now]]), Heather Harvey (Eaves) and Marai Larasi ([[End Violence Against Women Coalition|End Violence against Women]]) was titled "Just the Women", a phrase which was reportedly written by ''Newsnight'' editor [[Peter Rippon]] in an email to a colleague concerning the lack of other authorities [than the alleged female victims] for evidence of Savile's abuse.&lt;ref name=Eaves_EQ&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.endviolenceagainstwomen.org.uk/data/files/resources/51/Just-the-Women-Nov-2012.pdf |title=Just the Women |publisher=End Violence Against Women |date=24 November 2012 |accessdate=7 March 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327055327/http://www.endviolenceagainstwomen.org.uk/data/files/resources/51/Just-the-Women-Nov-2012.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Newsnight'' spokesman said, "Any suggestion that a story was dropped for anything other than editorial reasons is completely untrue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/9073142/BBC-buried-Savile-sex-abuse-claims-to-save-its-reputation.html |author=Singh, Anita |title=BBC 'buried Savile sex abuse claims to save its reputation' |work=The Daily Telegraph |location =London |date=10 February 2012 |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, the transcript of Surrey Police's interview with Savile in 2009 was published after a request under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of information Act]]. Savile denied the sexual abuse allegations relating to Duncroft Approved School put to him by the police, saying, "I've never, ever done anything wrong" and stating that the accusers wanted a "few quid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Quinn, Ben |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/15/jimmy-savile-boasted-police-abuse |newspaper=The Guardian |location =London |title=Jimmy Savile boasted to police of his 'policy' he used to halt abuse claims |date=15 October 2013  |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131016220234/http://www.surrey.police.uk/tabid/2980/InfoItemId/197/Default.aspx ]&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] documentary, ''[[Exposure (UK TV series)|Exposure: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile]]'', was broadcast on 3 October 2012.&lt;ref name ="timeline" /&gt; It was researched and presented by Mark Williams-Thomas, a former police investigator who had been involved in the shelved ''Newsnight'' investigation.

Several women interviewed by ''Exposure'' said that, as teenagers, they had been sexually abused by Savile.&lt;ref name ="timeline" /&gt; It was also said Savile obtained access to teenage girls through his television programmes ''Top of the Pops'' and ''Clunk, Click'' (1973–74), and his charity work. Savile's former colleagues said he made no attempt to hide his interest in girls from them, while another said she had walked in on him [[french kiss]]ing an underage girl.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} One woman who said Savile had sexually assaulted her in 1970, when she was 14, explained she had not pursued her complaint to police in 2008 after being told it would lead to a "[[media circus]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19820017 |title= Jimmy Savile: Sussex police confirm 2008 assault claim |publisher=BBC News |date=3 October 2012 |accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founder of [[ChildLine]], [[Esther Rantzen]], was shown the interviews by Williams-Thomas and commented that, "There were always rumours that [Savile] behaved very inappropriately sexually with children."&lt;ref name="rantzen"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.sky.com/story/991538/esther-rantzen-rumours-followed-jimmy-savile |title=Esther Rantzen: Rumours Followed Jimmy Savile |publisher=[[Sky News]] |date=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BBC comments and investigations===
Newspaper reports claimed [[Douglas Muggeridge]], controller of [[BBC Radio 1]] in the early 1970s, was aware of allegations against Savile, and asked for a report in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Liam |last=O'Brien |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/boss-of-radio-1-knew-jimmy-savile-was-abusing-young-girls-8196555.html |title=Boss of Radio 1 'knew Jimmy Savile was abusing young girls' |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |location =London |date=4 October 2012 |accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Derek Chinnery]], controller of Radio 1 from 1978 to 1985, recalled an occasion when he confronted Savile, saying, "I asked, 'What's all this, these rumours we hear about you Jimmy?'

On 8 October, the [[Director-General of the BBC]], [[George Entwistle]], apologised for what had happened and said further internal investigations would take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19867830 |title=Jimmy Savile abuse claims: BBC apologises and pledges inquiry |publisher=BBC News |date=8 October 2012 |accessdate=8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chairman of the [[BBC Trust]], [[Chris Patten|Lord Patten]], said the investigation would be set up as soon as police enquiries had been completed, and would be chaired by a figure from outside the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19899354 |title= Jimmy Savile abuse claims: Outsider to head BBC inquiry |publisher=BBC News |date=10 October 2012 |accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the shelving of the ''Newsnight'' investigation into Savile's activities ([[#Aborted Newsnight report|see above]]), there were complaints on ''[[Newswatch (UK TV series)|Newswatch]]''.

The BBC was criticised in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] for its handling of the affair. [[Harriet Harman]] said the allegations "cast a stain" on the corporation. [[Culture Secretary]] [[Maria Miller]] said she was satisfied the BBC was taking the allegations very seriously, and dismissed calls for an independent inquiry. [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] leader [[Ed Miliband]] said an independent inquiry was the only way to ensure justice for those involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19957143 |title= Ed Miliband calls for 'outsider' to probe over Savile scandal |publisher=BBC News |date=15 October 2012 |accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entwistle offered to appear before the [[Culture, Media and Sport Committee]] to explain the BBC's position and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19948782 |title= MPs say Jimmy Savile claims are 'stain on BBC' |publisher=BBC News |date=15 October 2012 |accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 October, the BBC appointed heads of two inquiries into events surrounding Savile.

Savile had appeared on the telethon in 1984, 1987 and 1989 before Jones became chairman.&lt;ref name=bbc-news-jimmy-saville-banned-from-children-in-need&gt;{{cite web |title= Jimmy Savile: Children in Need had ban – Sir Roger Jones |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-20120302 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=29 October 2012 |date=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph-creepy-jimmy-saville-banned-from-children-in-need&gt;{{cite news |title= 'Creepy' Jimmy Savile was banned from Children in Need |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/jimmy-savile/9640407/Creepy-Jimmy-Savile-was-banned-from-Children-in-Need.html |accessdate=29 October 2012 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location =London |date=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report by Pollard into the BBC's handling of the affair was published on 19 December 2012. It concluded that the decision to drop the ''Newsnight'' report on the allegations against Savile in December 2011 was "flawed", but that it had not been done to protect the Savile tribute programmes. However, it criticised Entwistle for apparently failing to read emails warning him of Savile's "dark side",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Halliday |first= Josh |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/dec/19/pollard-report-george-entwistle-jimmy-savile |title=Pollard report: George Entwistle 'did not read emails' about Jimmy Savile |newspaper=The Guardian |location =London |date=19 December 2012 |accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that, after the allegations against Savile eventually became public, the BBC fell into a "level of chaos and confusion [that] was even greater than was apparent at the time".&lt;ref name=gdn191212ps&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sabbagh |first1=Dan |last2=Plunkett |first2=John |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/dec/19/pollard-inquiry-bbc-jimmy-savile |title=Pollard inquiry: BBC 'incapable' of dealing with Jimmy Savile affair |newspaper=The Guardian |location= London |date=19 December 2012 |accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC announced that Rippon and ''Newsnight'' deputy editor Liz Gibbons would be replaced.&lt;ref name=gdn191212ps/&gt; Transcripts of evidence to the Pollard inquiry, together with emails and other submissions, were published on 22 February 2013.&lt;ref name=telegraph220213&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Mahony |first=Jennifer |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/jimmy-savile/9887449/BBC-releases-Pollard-report-into-the-Savile-inquiry-live.html |title=BBC releases Pollard report into the Savile inquiry |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location= London |date=22 February 2013 |accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gdn220213&gt;{{cite news |last1=Halliday |first1=Josh |last2=Kiss |first2= Jemima |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/feb/22/bbc-jimmy-savile-scandal-transcripts |title=BBC releases Jimmy Savile scandal transcripts |newspaper=The Guardian |location= London |date=22 February 2013 |accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dame Janet Smith review====
{{Main article|Dame Janet Smith Review}}
In November 2012, Dame Janet Smith called for evidence, from people who were the subject of inappropriate sexual conduct by Savile on BBC premises, or on location for the BBC; people who knew of or suspected such conduct; anyone who raised concerns about Savile's conduct within the BBC; people who worked for or with Savile on programmes at the BBC between about 1964 and 2007, or who were familiar with "the culture or practices of the BBC during that time insofar as they may have been relevant to preventing or enabling the sexual abuse of children, young people or teenagers"; and people who held senior positions at the BBC who may have relevant information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.damejanetsmithreview.com/ |title=Appeal for witnesses – Jimmy Savile |publisher=The Dame Janet Smith Review |date=November 2012 |accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20325913 |title=Jimmy Savile scandal: Dame Janet Smith seeks witnesses |publisher=BBC News |date=14 November 2012 |accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 5 December 2012, the review's team had been contacted by "over 290" individuals, including many former or current BBC employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.damejanetsmithreview.com/updates/ |title=Update: 5 December 2012 |publisher= The Dame Janet Smith Review |date=5 December 2012 |accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 May 2015 it was announced that the review report was finished, but it could not be published as it might prejudice ongoing police investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.damejanetsmithreview.com/updates/ |title=Updates |publisher=Dame Janet Smith Review |date= |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The review was published 25 February 2016. The review, which totalled more than 700 pages, found Savile had sexually abused 72 people and had [[rape]]d eight people, including an eight-year-old, at "virtually every one of the BBC premises at which he worked". Smith stated that some BBC staff members were aware of complaints against Savile but did not pass the information to senior management due to the "culture of not complaining." She described an "atmosphere of fear" still existing at the BBC and said that some of those interviewed for the inquiry did so only after being assured their names would not be published, as they feared reprisal. A separate report into the offending of [[Stuart Hall (presenter)|Stuart Hall]], another BBC presenter, was released the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bilefsky|first1=Dan|title=Jimmy Savile Inquiry Accuses BBC of Failing to Report Sexual Abuse|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/world/europe/jimmy-savile-report-bbc.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=25 February 2016|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New allegations==
Following the broadcast of the ITV documentary, many people came forward to make allegations about Savile's conduct towards young people. Some abuse was said to have taken place on BBC premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Jennifer |last=O'Mahony |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9603743/Jimmy-Savile-BBC-did-nothing-when-director-caught-him-in-the-act.html |title=Jimmy Savile: BBC did nothing when director caught him in the act |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location =London |date=12 October 2012 |accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed that Savile had abused at least one boy as well as numerous girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Martin |last=Beckford |first2=Richard |last2=Alleyne |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9588692/Met-investigate-Sir-Jimmy-Savile-as-dozens-more-abuse-allegations-are-made.html |title=Met investigate Sir Jimmy Savile as dozens more abuse allegations are made |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location =London |date=5 October 2012 |accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims were made about Savile's activities in hospitals. It was claimed that he sexually abused a 13-year-old patient during a visit to [[Stoke Mandeville Hospital]] in 1971 and an eight-year-old girl in the same hospital recovering from an operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=John Hall |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/status-quo-frontman-francis-rossi-jimmy-savile-invited-me-to-sex-party-in-his-dressing-room-8282508.html |title=Status Quo frontman Francis Rossi: Jimmy Savile invited me to 'sex party' in his dressing room |publisher=The Independent |date=5 November 2012 |accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Staff reported he searched the wards for young patients to abuse, and they instructed patients in the children's ward to feign sleep during his visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Beckford, Martin |author2= Marsden, Sam |author3= Furness, Hannah |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9600123/Jimmy-Savile-did-ward-rounds-at-Stoke-Mandeville-to-find-young-girls-to-abuse.html |title=Jimmy Savile did 'ward rounds' at Stoke Mandeville to find young girls to abuse |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location =London |date=10 October 2012 |accessdate=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hospital spokesman said, though it was working with the police, it had no record of inappropriate behaviour by Savile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19907206 |title= Jimmy Savile: Stoke Mandeville patient's abuse claim |publisher=BBC News |date=11 October 2012 |accessdate=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC carried statements from a retired detective inspector of the local police force that a nurse at Stoke Mandeville hospital had reported Savile's abuse of patients there to him in the 1970s and he had repeatedly informed his superiors about this, but they did not believe him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Addley |first=Ester |title= Jimmy Savile's Broadmoor role came with a bedroom and keys |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/12/jimmy-savile-broadmoor-volunteer-role?newsfeed=true |accessdate=3 July 2014 |work=The Guardian |location= London |date=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A former nurse said she saw Savile molest a brain-damaged patient at Leeds hospital, saying, "He kissed her, and I thought he was a visitor coming to see her, and he started rubbing his hands down her arms and then I don't know of a nice way to put it but he molested her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Martin |last1=Beckford |first2=Sam |last2=Marsden |first3=Hannah |last3=Furness |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9600881/Sir-Jimmy-Savile-new-allegations-presenter-abused-sick-children.html |title=Sir Jimmy Savile: new allegations presenter abused sick children |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location =London |date=11 October 2012 |accessdate=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Savile was a volunteer at the adult high-security psychiatric [[Broadmoor Hospital]], and in August 1988 was appointed to chair an interim task force overseeing the management of the hospital, after its management board had been suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1988/nov/07/mentally-ill-offenders-treatment-1#S5LV0501P0_19881107_HOL_188 |title=Mentally Ill Offenders: Treatment |author=[[Alexander Scrymgeour, 12th Earl of Dundee|The Earl of Dundee]] |publisher=Hansard (Lords) |id=HL Deb 7 November 1988 vol 501 c525 |date=7 November 1988 |accessdate=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is alleged that Savile had hospital keys and access to patients' rooms. In a separate allegation, a lawyer said a client had been abused by Savile when he was a 10-year-old at the [[Haut de la Garenne]] children's home in Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-jersey-19932105 |title= Jimmy Savile 'assaulted 10-year-old boy in Jersey' |publisher=BBC News |date=12 October 2012 |accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julie Fernandez]], who later appeared in BBC television programmes ''[[Eldorado (TV series)|Eldorado]]'' and ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'', was invited to a BBC studio to appear on ''Jim'll Fix It''. She recalled her experience in a radio interview: "I was in my wheelchair, but I just remember [Savile's] hands being everywhere and just lingering those two, three, four seconds slightly too long in places they shouldn't [...] It was in a busy room full of people in a studio so it was quite discreetly done and you don't kind of realise what's happening at the time, especially when you're 14 and it's the first time you've ever been in a studio and you're very excited. But I do remember feeling uncomfortable and he had these huge rings on his fingers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19925372 |title=Jimmy Savile 'groped Julie Fernandez when she was 14' |publisher=BBC News |date=12 October 2012 |accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/1012/breaking54.html |title=Savile 'groped' The Office actor |newspaper=[[The Irish Times]] |location=Dublin |agency=Press Association |date=12 October 2012 |accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Seymour |url= http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/local/tv-star-speaks-to-pt-about-jimmy-savile-s-wandering-hands-1-4365243 |title=TV star speaks to PT about Jimmy Savile's 'wandering hands' |newspaper=[[Peterborough Evening Telegraph]] |date=13 October 2012 |accessdate=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singer [[Coleen Nolan]] said Savile invited her to a hotel when she was 14 and had been involved in a TV recording at the ''Top of the Pops'' studio and that it made her "uncomfortable", "But you didn't talk about those things then."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Martin |last1=Beckford |first2=Hannah |last2=Furness |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9585196/Jimmy-Savile-invited-me-to-hotel-when-I-was-14-claims-Coleen-Nolan.html |title=Coleen Nolan: Jimmy Savile invited me to hotel when I was 14 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location =London |date=3 October 2012 |accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savile's [[Nephew and niece|great-niece]] Caroline Robinson said she had been sexually abused by him twice at family gatherings. She believed some members of the family knew about his abuse but had turned a blind eye to it.&lt;ref name=guardian-gary-glitter-arrested/&gt;

The British Prime Minister, [[David Cameron]], said that he was "truly shocked" by the published allegations, which should be "properly investigated".&lt;ref name="bbc 7 oct"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19863322 |title= Jimmy Savile abuse claims: Charity 'may change name' |publisher=BBC News |date=7 October 2012 |accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust]] stated that it was considering giving funds to those working with victims of sexual abuse, and that it may change its name because of the allegations;&lt;ref name="bbc 7 oct"/&gt; the trust later announced that it would close.&lt;ref name="bbc-news-jimmy-savile-charities-have-no-future"/&gt; As part of the investigations, enquiries would be made into allegations of abuse when Savile worked as a volunteer at [[Leeds General Infirmary]].&lt;ref name="bbc 10 oct"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-19894010 |title= Jimmy Savile sex abuse inquiry 'to focus on Leeds hospital' |publisher=BBC News |date=10 October 2012 |accessdate=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, it was reported that the ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' had decided not to publish allegations of sexual abuse at a children's home by two women against Savile. [[Paul Connew]], who was the newspaper's editor when the women came forward in 1994, described the allegations as "credible and convincing", but said that lawyers had advised against publication.&lt;ref name="connew"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/oct/10/jimmy-savile-bbc |first=Roy |last=Greenslade |title= Jimmy Savile: why the tabloids were unable to publish and be damned |newspaper=The Guardian |location= London |date=10 October 2012 |accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, Connew said that he believed that the newspaper would have lost a [[defamation|libel]] action over the allegations, as the two women, who had been pupils at Duncroft Approved School, did not want to be named. He also expressed concern that a jury would have been "starstruck" by Savile.&lt;ref name="connew_2"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/savile-story-dropped-sunday-mirror-because-paper-could-not-afford-lose-libel-battle |first=William |last=Turvill |title= Savile story dropped by Sunday Mirror because paper could not afford to lose libel battle |work= PressGazette |location= London |date=15 July 2013 |accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014 the Health Secretary [[Jeremy Hunt (politician)|Jeremy Hunt]] announced that the enquiry had been widened, with the number of NHS organisations investigating allegations of abuse by Savile extended to 41.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-29932391|title=BBC News - Jimmy Savile NHS hospital abuse inquiry widens|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Police and related investigations==

===Operation Yewtree===
{{main article|Operation Yewtree}}
The [[Metropolitan Police Service]] stated on 4 October 2012 that its Child Abuse Investigation Command would lead a process of assessing the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19837906 |title=Met Police to assess Jimmy Savile claims |publisher=BBC News |date=4 October 2012 |accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 9 October the Metropolitan Police had formally recorded eight allegations against Savile, but announced that it was following up 120 lines of inquiry, addressing up to 25 alleged victims of abuse, mainly girls aged between 13 and 16. These covered a period spanning four decades, from 1959 until the 1980s, and were on "a national scale". An inquiry process, known as [[Operation Yewtree]], was set up jointly with the [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]] (NSPCC), and involving other organisations including the BBC and ITV. Commander Peter Spindler, head of specialist crime investigations, said: "At this stage it is quite clear from what women are telling us that Savile was a predatory sex offender."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19887019 |title=Savile abuse claims: Police pursue 120 lines of inquiry |publisher=BBC News |date=9 October 2012 |accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 October 2012 the Metropolitan Police launched a formal criminal investigation into historic allegations of child sex abuse by Savile over four decades. It stated that it was pursuing over 400 separate lines of inquiry based on evidence of 200 witnesses via 14 police forces across the UK. Commander Spindler said: "We are dealing with alleged abuse on an unprecedented scale. The profile of this operation has empowered a staggering number of victims to come forward to report the sexual exploitation which occurred during their childhood." John Cameron of the NSPCC said that Savile was "a well-organised prolific sex offender, who's used his power, his authority, his influence to procure children and offend against them."&lt;ref name="bbc191012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph 191012"/&gt;

On 25 October the police reported that the number of possible victims was "fast approaching 300".&lt;ref name=B300&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20081021 |title= Jimmy Savile: Number of victims reach 300, police say |date=25 October 2012 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also reported that police were looking at allegations that three doctors in hospitals with which Savile had been associated had been involved in the abuse of young people in their care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/24/jimmy-savile-sex-abuse-doctors |title= Jimmy Savile inquiry looking at alleged sexual abuse by three doctors |newspaper=The Guardian |location =London |author1= Laville, Sandra |author2= O'Carroll, Lisa |date=24 October 2012 |accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2013, comedian [[Jim Davidson]] and two unnamed men were arrested as part of the inquiry, bringing the total to 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21333623 |publisher=BBC News |title= Operation Yewtree: Man, 65, arrested in London |date=5 February 2013 |accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; De'Ath was later told that he would not face any charges, and said that the police action had been "overzealous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21936350 |publisher=BBC News |title= Police's Savile Yewtree inquiry 'has gone too far' |date=26 March 2013 |accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, it was reported that Ted Beston would not face prosecution due to insufficient evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22526051 |publisher=BBC News |title= Savile producer Ted Beston 'relieved' as police drop action |date=14 May 2013 |accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 December, Commander Peter Spindler said that the investigation had been completed and that the report of Operation Yewtree was being prepared for publication early in 2013. He said that a total of 589 alleged victims of abuse had come forward in the inquiry, of whom 450 alleged abuse by Savile. Of the alleged victims, 82% were female and 80% were children or young people. There were 31 allegations of rape by Savile across seven [[Police area#Current police areas of Great Britain|police force areas]]. Commander Spindler said: "Savile's offending peaked in the 70s and what we... will be showing... is how he used his position in society... to get his sexual gratification."&lt;ref name="bbc121212"/&gt; The operation had involved 30 police officers, and its cost so far was estimated at about £2 million.&lt;ref name="bbc111212"/&gt;

On 11 January 2013, ''[[Giving Victims a Voice]]'', a report into allegations of sexual abuse made against Jimmy Savile under Operation Yewtree by the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] and the NSPCC was published under the logo of the Crown Prosecution Service.&lt;ref name="Giving Victims a Voice"/&gt; Among its conclusions are that "It is now clear that Savile was hiding in plain sight and using his celebrity status and fundraising activity to gain uncontrolled access to vulnerable people across six decades. For a variety of reasons the vast majority of his victims did not feel they could speak out and it's apparent that some of the small number who did had their accounts dismissed by those in authority including parents and carers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nspcc.org.uk/news-and-views/our-news/child-protection-news/13-01-11-yewtree-report/yewtree-report-pdf_wdf93652.pdf |title=Giving Victims a Voice |publisher=Crown Prosecution Service |date=January 2013}}{{rp|6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document was given wide publicity throughout the media. Journalist [[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]] wrote in ''The Daily Telegraph'' that he had read the whole report and it did not reveal the extent of abuse as the BBC website had stated in the lead headline "Jimmy Savile scandal: Report reveals extent of abuse". He remarked that there was no evidence in the report which a court would recognise. Instead it assumed that because uncorroborated allegations had been made, the offences were committed, and, treating allegations as facts, it declared that 214 incidents had now been "formally recorded" as crimes. Moore commented that by doing so the report undermined justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Moore, Charles |url=

In March 2013 Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary reported that 214 of the complaints that had been made against Savile after his death would have been criminal offences if they had been reported at the time. Sixteen persons reported being raped by Savile under the age of 16 and four of those were under the age of ten. Thirteen others reported serious sexual abuse by Savile, including four under-ten-year-olds. Another ten reported being raped by Savile while over the age of sixteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmic.gov.uk/media/review-into-allegations-and-intelligence-material-concerning-jimmy-savile.pdf |title="Mistakes were made."

DJ and friend of Savile [[Ray Teret]] was found guilty of seven rapes and 11 indecent assaults in December 2014; while Teret was cleared of aiding and abetting Savile to rape a 15-year-old girl, he was found guilty of raping the same complainant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Jimmy Savile's friend Ray Teret guilty of raping one of BBC presenter's victims |author= Evans, Martin |date=5 December 2014 |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/jimmy-savile/11255050/Jimmy-Saviles-friend-Ray-Teret-guilty-of-raping-one-of-BBC-presenters-victims.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location= London |accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An attorney for 169 of Savile's alleged victims stated that Teret's guilty verdicts represent "the closest the victims of Jimmy Savile will get to a conviction against their attacker".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Lawyer: Savile victims will take comfort from Teret verdict |url= http://www.itv.com/news/update/2014-12-05/lawyer-savile-victims-will-take-comfort-from-teret-verdict/ |work=ITV News |date=5 December 2014 |accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crown Prosecution Service===
On 24 October 2012 the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] said the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]], [[Keir Starmer]], would review the service's decisions not to prosecute Savile in 2009 in relation to four claims against him for sexual abuse dating back to the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/jimmy-savile/9630550/Jimmy-Savile-What-George-Entwistle-told-MPs-about-Panorama-justthewomen-Newsnight-and-the-conversation-at-the-Hilton-Hotel.html |author=Furness, Hannah |title=Jimmy Savile: Director of Public Prosecutions to review why CPS did not prosecute |work=The Daily Telegraph |location =London |date=24 October 2012 |accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report, prepared by the principal legal advisor to the DPP, Alison Levitt QC, was published on 11 January 2013. It found that, if police and prosecutors had taken a different approach towards the allegations, prosecutions could have been possible in relation to three of the claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20992789 |title= Jimmy Savile scandal: Chances to prosecute 'were missed' |publisher=BBC News |date=11 January 2013 |accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/press_statements/dpp_statement_about_savile_cases/executive_summary_on_jimmy_savile_cases_report/ |publisher=Crown Prosecution Service |title= In the matter of the late Jimmy Savile: Report to the Director of Public Prosecutions by Alison Levitt Q.C. |accessdate=12 January 2013 |date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keir Starmer apologised for the shortcomings of the CPS and criticised two police forces for taking an "unjustifiably cautious" approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/jimmy-savile/9795128/Jimmy-Savile-police-missed-three-chances-to-take-case-to-trial-DPP-admits.html |title=Jimmy Savile police missed three chances to take case to trial, DPP admits |work=The Daily Telegraph |location =London |date=11 January 2013 |accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, shortly after he left the position of [[Director of Public Prosecutions]], Keir Starmer called for mandatory reporting which would compel all professionals such as teachers, doctors and social workers to report suspicions of child abuse or face legal consequences in the light of the scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kunal Dutta |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/without-a-change-in-the-law-therell-be-another-savile--keir-starmer-says-professionals-should-be-forced-to-report-suspected-child-abuse-8920031.html |title=‘Without a change in the law, there’ll be another Savile’ - Keir Starmer says professionals should be forced to report suspected child abuse |publisher=The Independent |date=4 November 2013 |accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HMIC assessment of police investigations===
The [[Home Secretary]], [[Theresa May]], announced on 6 November 2012 that [[Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary]] would also carry out an assessment of all the investigations relating to Savile undertaken by police forces across the country, examine whether allegations were properly investigated, and identify any related issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/media-centre/news/historic-abuse-allegations |publisher=Home Office |title= Home Secretary's statement on historic allegations of child abuse in north Wales |date=6 November 2012 |accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 March 2013, a report entitled "Mistakes were made: HMIC's review into allegations and intelligence material concerning Jimmy Savile between 1964 and 2012" was published, which included material showing that police had received intelligence about Savile's sexual conduct dating back to 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21756150|title=The missed chances to get Jimmy Savile |publisher=BBC News |date=12 March 2013 |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigations in Jersey===
On 7 November 2012 it was announced that an inquiry would also be undertaken, by a senior legal figure from outside the island, into allegations that Savile had abused children at Haut de la Garenne in [[Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John-Paul Ford Rojas |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/jimmy-savile/9661795/Independent-inquiry-to-examine-claims-of-Jersey-abuse.html |title=Independent inquiry to examine claims of Jersey abuse |publisher=Telegraph |date=7 November 2012 |accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Yorkshire Police report===
On 10 May 2013, [[West Yorkshire Police]] published a report into the relationship of the force with Savile. It concluded that he had not been protected from arrest or prosecution, but that there had been an "over-reliance on personal friendships" between Savile and some officers. The report states that there are "currently 76 crimes involving 68 victims committed in the West Yorkshire area relating to Savile", but none of them were reported to the police before his death. Nine of the incidents relate to persons under the age of nine, the youngest being aged five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-22476937 |title=Jimmy Savile 'not protected' from arrest, West Yorkshire Police say |publisher=BBC News |date=10 May 2013 |accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A copy of the report was to be passed to the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/may/09/west-yorkshire-police-jimmy-savile-report |title=West Yorkshire police to publish findings of Jimmy Savile report |agency=Press Association |work=The Guardian |location= London |date=9 May 2013 |accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Yorkshire Police report===
On 18 December 2014, [[North Yorkshire Police]] published a report of an internal inquiry into its actions.  The inquiry, termed Operation Hibiscus, found no evidence of misconduct by officers, but also concluded that opportunities had been missed to prosecute both Savile and Peter Jaconelli, a former mayor of [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] who died in 1999, for child sex abuse.  The report stated that 32 allegations had been made against Jaconelli, and five against Savile.  Jaconelli was stripped of civic honours earlier in 2014 after allegations against him were first published by the ''North Yorks Enquirer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tim Hicks |url=http://nyenquirer.uk/vindicated-savile-jaconelli-cover-starts-unravel/ |title=North Yorks Enquirer Vindicated!

===Surrey Police report===
On 29 April 2015, [[Surrey Police]] published a report stating that Savile had sexually assaulted 22 students and a visitor at the Duncroft Approved School for Girls in [[Staines-upon-Thames]] between 1974 and 1979. The report said that Savile had committed at least 46 offences at the school, including one which would have been classed as rape under current law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-32510543 |title=Surrey school pupils abused by Savile, police report says|work=BBC News |date=29 April 2015 |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Department of Health investigations==
The [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] announced that former [[barrister]] [[Kate Lampard]] would chair the department's investigations into Savile's activities at [[Stoke Mandeville Hospital]], [[Leeds General Infirmary]], [[Broadmoor Hospital]] and other hospitals and facilities in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19980979 |title=Jimmy Savile scandal: Kate Lampard to lead NHS investigation |publisher=BBC News |date=17 October 2012 |accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013 the [[Secretary of State for Health]], [[Jeremy Hunt (politician)|Jeremy Hunt]], announced that inquiries had been extended to other, unnamed, hospitals.&lt;ref name="bbc 24520001"/&gt; As at November 2013, the list of hospitals investigated included:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25153968|title=Jimmy Savile: 19 more hospitals to investigate links|publisher=BBC News|date=29 November 2013|accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Findings===
The results of the investigations were made public by Hunt on 26 June 2014.  The report concluded that Savile sexually assaulted victims in NHS hospitals over several decades.  At Leeds General Infirmary, 60 people, including both staff and patients, stated that they had been abused by Savile, with their ages ranging from 5 to 75.  It reported a number of organisational failures which had allowed him to continue unchallenged.  Hunt apologised to the victims of the assaults, and said that the findings "will shake our country to the core".&lt;ref name=bbc260614/&gt;

It was reported that Savile had boasted to nurses and other staff that he performed sex acts on the bodies of recently deceased persons in the mortuary of Leeds General Hospital and claimed to have removed glass eyes from corpses and made them into rings. The report says "We have no way of proving Savile's claims that he interfered with the bodies of the deceased patients in the mortuary in this way" but that Savile did have unsupervised access to the mortuary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Halliday |first1=Josh |title=Jimmy Savile told hospital staff he performed sex acts on corpses in Leeds mortuary |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jun/26/savile-bodies-sex-acts-corpses-glass-eyes-mortuary |accessdate=25 June 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |location= London |date=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Davies |first1=Caroline |title=Jimmy Savile's victims were aged five to seventy-five at Leeds Hospital, inquiry finds |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jun/26/jimmy-savile-victims-leeds-general-infirmary-investigators |accessdate=25 June 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |location= London |date=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A separate report on Savile's activities at [[Stoke Mandeville Hospital]], prepared by independent investigator Dr Androulla Johnstone and published on 26 February 2015, found that he had sexually abused more than 50 people there, including staff, patients and visitors.  One was an 8-year-old child.  Savile had full access to all parts of the hospital.   The report stated that it was widely known at the hospital that Savile was a "sex pest", and that 10 complaints had been made at the time, but no action was taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Titheradge |first1=Noel  |title=Savile abuse: Stoke Mandeville staff 'were told' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31611191 |accessdate=26 February 2015 |publisher=BBC News |date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also published on 26 February 2015 was Kate Lampard's report into lessons to be learned from the health service's handling of the Savile scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Savile 'abused 63 people at Stoke Mandeville Hospital' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31637320 |accessdate=26 February 2015 |publisher=BBC News |date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She concluded that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/407187/KL_lessons_learned_report_FINAL.pdf |title=Independent oversight of NHS and Department of Health investigations into matters relating to Jimmy Savill |publisher=GOV.UK |date=19 February 2015 |accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Savile was a highly unusual personality whose lifestyle, behaviour and offending patterns were equally unusual. As a result of his celebrity, his volunteering, and his fundraising he had exceptional access to a number of NHS hospitals and took the opportunities that that access gave him to abuse patients, staff and others on a remarkable scale. Savile’s celebrity and his roles as a volunteer and fundraiser also gave him power and influence within NHS hospitals which meant that his behaviour, which was often evidently inappropriate, was not challenged as it should have been. Savile’s ability to continue to pursue his activities without effective challenge was aided by fragmented hospital management arrangements; social attitudes of the times, including reticence in reporting and accepting reports of sexual harassment and abuse, and greater deference than today towards those in positions of influence and power; and less bold and intrusive media reporting.  While it might be tempting to dismiss the Savile case as wholly exceptional, a unique result of a perfect storm of circumstances, the evidence we have gathered indicates that there are many elements of the Savile story that could be repeated in the future. There is always a risk of the abuse, including sexual abuse, of people in hospitals. There will always be people who seek to gain undue influence and power within public institutions including in hospitals. And society and individuals continue to have a weakness for celebrities. Hospital organisations need to be aware of the risks posed by these
matters and manage them appropriately."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Department for Education==
A report for the [[Department for Education]] reached no firm conclusions over whether Savile had abused children or staff when visiting schools and children's homes, or hosting shows at which they had been invited to attend, between the 1960s and 1980s.  The report, published on 26 February 2015, brought together the findings of various investigations carried out by local authorities, charities and schools.  The Children's Minister, [[Edward Timpson]], said that, though information had been received from credible sources, there was insufficient corroborating evidence to draw firm conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='No conclusions' on Savile in schools |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-31640591 |accessdate=26 February 2015 |publisher=BBC News |date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 November 2012 the [[Shadow Home Secretary]], [[Yvette Cooper]], called in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] for a single, overarching public inquiry to examine all recent allegations of child abuse, including those relating to the [[North Wales child abuse scandal]] and those related to Savile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/house_of_commons/newsid_9766000/9766976.stm |work=BBC Democracy Live |title=May announces details of child abuse investigations |date=6 November 2012 |accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was supported by former minister [[Tim Loughton]] and the NSPCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/nov/08/david-cameron-warns-witch-hunt-paedophilia |title=David Cameron warns against 'witch-hunt' amid paedophilia allegations &amp;#124; Society |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[2014 United Kingdom child sexual abuse panel inquiry|overarching panel inquiry]] was announced by the [[Home Secretary]], [[Theresa May]], in July 2014, to examine how the country's institutions had handled their [[Duty of care in English law|duty of care]] to protect children from sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=BBCJul814&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-28203914 |title=Ex-senior judge Butler-Sloss to head child sex abuse inquiry |publisher=BBC News |date=8 July 2014 |accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is to be led by an independent panel of experts, and was to be chaired by [[Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, Baroness Butler-Sloss|Baroness Butler-Sloss]].

==Aftermath==
[[File:Jimmy Savile, Headstone.jpg|thumb|right|Savile's ornate black [[granite]] and steel [[headstone]] stood for just 19 days.

Savile's family asked "out of respect to public opinion" that his gravestone be taken from the cemetery where his body is buried.

On 23 October 2012 two [[registered charities in England and Wales|registered charities]], the Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust and the Jimmy Savile Stoke Mandeville Hospital Trust, set up to "provide funds for the relief of poverty and sickness and other charitable purposes beneficial to the community", announced they would close and have their funds redistributed to other charities.&lt;ref name=bbc-news-jimmy-savile-charities-have-no-future&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20001588 |title=Jimmy Savile charities have no future, say trustees |publisher=BBC News |date=23 October 2012 |accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported on 28 October 2012 that Savile's cottage in [[Glen Coe]] had been spray-painted with slogans and the door damaged.&lt;ref name=guardian-gary-glitter-arrested/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc-news-savilles-glencoe-home-vandalised&gt;{{cite web |title=Savile's Glencoe home vandalised |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-20116281 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=29 October 2012 |date=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cottage had been searched by police looking for evidence of others involved with him in abuse.&lt;ref name=guardian-gary-glitter-arrested/&gt; Plans to sell the cottage early in 2012 were halted by Savile's charitable trust, which had planned to turn it into a respite centre for the disabled. These plans were in turn halted when the trust announced it would close.&lt;ref name=bbc-news-savilles-glencoe-home-vandalised/&gt; The cottage was sold at auction on 30 May 2013.&lt;ref name="scotsman may13"&gt;{{cite news |last= Smith |first= Steve |title= Jimmy Savile's Glencoe home on sale for £310k |url= http://www.scotsman.com/news/scottish-news/top-stories/jimmy-savile-s-glencoe-home-on-sale-for-310k-1-2932120 |accessdate=16 May 2013 |newspaper=The Scotsman |location=Edinburgh |date=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cottagebbc"&gt;{{cite news |title= Jimmy Savile cottage in Glencoe sells for £212,000 |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-22713282 |accessdate=31 May 2013 |publisher=BBC News |date=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 November it was reported that letters had been sent to Savile's estate, the BBC, Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Broadmoor, and Leeds General Infirmary by solicitors acting on behalf of 20 clients who claimed to have been abused by Savile, and that legal action against them was being considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20184715 |title=Freddie Starr faces further questioning |publisher=BBC News |date=2 November 2012 |accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012 the BBC confirmed that it would no longer be airing further repeats of ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' on [[BBC Four]] featuring Savile as a presenter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a435261/bbc-axes-jimmy-savile-top-of-the-pops-reruns.html |title= BBC axes Jimmy Savile 'Top of the Pops' reruns |work= Digital Spy |date= 2 November 2012|accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 January 2013 the BBC apologised after it had screened a 2001 episode of the children's programme ''[[Tweenies]]'' on [[CBeebies]], in which the character Max had presented a parody of ''Top of The Pops'', dressed up and with a hairstyle similar to Savile's, and also using some of his catchphrases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jan/20/bbc-jimmy-savile-parody-cbeebies |title=BBC apologises over Jimmy Savile parody on CBeebies |work=The Guardian |location= London |agency=Press Association |date=20 January 2013 |accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015 a stage play about Savile and the abuse scandal was premiered at [[Park Theatre (London)|Park Theatre]] in [[Finsbury Park (area)|Finsbury Park]], London. Titled ''An Audience with Jimmy Savile'', it was written by [[Jonathan Maitland]] and starred  [[Alistair McGowan]] as Savile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lyn |last=Gardner |authorlink=Lyn Gardner |url= https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jun/12/an-audience-with-jimmy-savile-review-alistair-mcgowan-is-repellently-convincing |title= An Audience with Jimmy Savile review – Alistair McGowan is repellently convincing |work= The Guardian |date= 12 June 2015|accessdate= 12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kindness''' is a behavior marked by [[ethics|ethical]] characteristics, a pleasant [[disposition]], and concern and consideration for others. It is considered a [[virtue]], and is recognized as a [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]] in many cultures and religions (see [[ethics in religion]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Khazan |first=Olga |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/06/it-pays-to-be-nice/396512/ |title=It Pays to Be Nice |publisher=[[The Atlantic]] |date=Jun 23, 2015 |accessdate=August 16, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Book II of "[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]", Aristotle defines kindness as "helpfulness towards someone in need, not in return for anything, nor for the advantage of the helper himself, but for that of the person helped".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.public.iastate.edu/~honeyl/Rhetoric/rhet2-7.html |title=Kindness |author=Aristotle (translated by Lee Honeycutt) |work=Rhetoric, book 2, chapter 7 |accessdate=2005-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041213221951/http://www.public.iastate.edu/~honeyl/Rhetoric/rhet2-7.html |archivedate=December 13, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] considered kindness and love to be the "most curative herbs and agents in human intercourse".&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm.

University of Nebraska Press: First Printing, Bison Books, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Kindness is considered to be one of the [[Knightly Virtues]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=NnHHpCuox2IC&amp;pg=PT20&amp;lpg=PT20&amp;dq=Kindness%20is%20considered%20to%20be%20one%20of%20the%20Knightly%20Virtues&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NS9zXyFTUX&amp;sig=-8H0ZlxWtVpFffgkNUXl7JBeGOM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-8DiVPWxOuWwmwWtkIHADw&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAg|title=The Manual of Life - Character|publisher=Parvesh singla|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Meher Baba]]'s teachings, God is synonymous with kindness: "God is so kind that it is impossible to imagine His unbounded kindness!"&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, Bhau (1986). ''Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher'', '''11''', Myrtle Beach: Manifestation, Inc., p. 3918.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In society==
In human [[mating choice]], studies suggest that both men and women value kindness and intelligence in their prospective mates, along with physical appearance, attractiveness, social status, and age.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, David M., et al.

===Nice guy===
{{main|Nice guy}}
A "nice guy" is an informal and usually stereotypical term for an (often young) adult male who portrays himself as gentle, compassionate, sensitive, and/or vulnerable.&lt;ref name="McDaniel"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McDaniel |first=A. K. |year=2005 |title=Young Women's Dating Behavior: Why/Why Not Date a Nice Guy? |journal=Sex Roles |volume=53 |issue=5–6 |pages=347–359 |doi=10.1007/s11199-005-6758-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used both positively and negatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://divalion.livejournal.com/163615.html |title=No More Mr. Nice Guy |first= |last=divalion |date=12 July 2005 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117015253/http://divalion.livejournal.com/163615.html |archivedate=17 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When used positively, and particularly when used as a preference or description by someone else, it is intended to imply a male who puts the needs of others before his own, avoids confrontations, does favors, gives emotional support, tries to stay out of trouble, and generally acts nicely towards others.&lt;ref&gt;Glover, Dr. Robert, http://nomoremrniceguy.com&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of a relationship, it may also refer to traits of honesty, loyalty, romanticism, courtesy and respect. When used negatively, a nice guy implies a male who is unassertive, does not express his true feelings and, in the context of dating (in which the term is often used&lt;ref name="McDaniel" /&gt;), uses acts of [[Wiktionary:ostensible#English|ostensible]] friendship with the unstated aim of progressing to a romantic or sexual relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/opinion/2014/4/2/when-nice-guys-are-sexist-with-a-smile | title=When nice guys are sexist with a smile | publisher=Berkeley Beacon | date=2 April 2014 | accessdate=9 December 2014 | author=Blomquist, Daniel | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320074725/http://www.berkeleybeacon.com/opinion/2014/4/2/when-nice-guys-are-sexist-with-a-smile | archivedate=20 March 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maneater"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dasgupta|first1=Rivu|title=The Friend Zone is Sexist|url=http://www.themaneater.com/stories/2014/2/13/friend-zone-sexist/|website=The Maneater|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In psychology==
Based on experiments at Yale University using games with babies, some studies concluded that kindness is inherent to human beings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/video/magazine/1247467772000/can-babies-tell-right-from-wrong-.html Can Babies Tell Right From Wrong?, Babies at Yale University's Infant Cognition Center respond to "naughty" and "nice" puppets., May 5, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; There are similar studies about the root of empathy in babies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/28/science/researchers-trace-empathy-s-roots-to-infancy.html?pagewanted=all Researchers Trace Empathy's Roots to Infancy, Daniel Goleman, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
* The ''[[Tirukkuṛaḷ]],'' an ancient [[Indian literature|Indian work]] on [[ethics]] and [[morality]], dedicates a separate chapter on kindness (Chapter 8, verses 71–80), furthering the value in other chapters, such as [[hospitality]] (verses 81–90), uttering pleasant words (verses 91–100), [[compassion]] (verses 241–250), [[vegetarianism]] (verses 251–260), [[non-violence]] (verses 311–320), [[non-killing]] (verses 321–330), and [[benignity]] (verses 571–580), among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/content.htm Tirukkuṛaḷ]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216064046/http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/content.htm |date=2014-12-16 }} verses 71-80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/pdf/pm0153.pdf |title=Thirukkural English Translation and Commentary |publisher=W.H. Allen, &amp; Co |first=GU |last=Pope &lt;!--|authorlink=Thirukkural English Translation--&gt; |year=1886 |pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mark Twain]] from a [[compassion]] point of view considered "Kindness [as a] language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lorette M. Enochs|title=Seeds of Recovery: A Journal of 101 Mental Health Reflections|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aFafDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT76|date=21 November 2016|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-5246-5181-7|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It has been suggested that 'most of [[Shakespeare]]'s opus could be considered a study of human kindness'.&lt;ref&gt;Lagrette Tallent Lenker, ''Fathers and Daughters in Shakespeare and Shaw'' (2001) p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] considered that 'the essence of love is kindness; and indeed it may best be defined as passionate kindness: kindness, so to speak, run mad and become importunate and violent'.&lt;ref&gt;robert Louis Stevenson, ''Virginibus Puerisque'' (London 1909) p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Christian apostle Paul lists kindness as one of the nine traits considered to be the "[[fruit of the Spirit]]" &lt;ref&gt;Galatians 5:22, New International Version&lt;/ref&gt; in Galatians 5:22. In [[1_Corinthians_13#English_translation|1 Corinthians 13:4]] he states, "Love is patient, love is kind."&lt;ref&gt;1 Corinthians 13:4, New International Version&lt;/ref&gt;

==In media==
Based on the [[Pay It Forward (novel)|novel of the same name]] written in 1999 by author [[Catherine Ryan Hyde]], the motion picture [[Pay It Forward (film)|''Pay it Forward'']], which starred [[Kevin Spacey]], [[Helen Hunt]], [[Haley Joel Osment]] and [[Jon Bon Jovi]], illustrates the power one person can have to impact a chain reaction of kind deeds. The philosophy of Pay It Forward is that through acts of kindness among strangers, we all foster a more caring society. In the book and film, Reuben St. Clair, a [[social studies]] teacher in [[Atascadero, California]], challenges his students to "change the world". One of his students, Trevor, takes the challenge to heart. He starts by showing kindness to a stranger which ripples further than he could have ever imagined.

In October 2011, [[Life Vest Inside]] posted a video called "Kindness Boomerang".&lt;ref name="Kindness Boomerang"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwAYpLVyeFU|title=Kindness Boomerang|publisher=[[YouTube]]/Life Vest Inside|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;It shows how one [[Random kindness|act of kindness]] passes seamlessly from one person to the next and boomerangs back to the person who set it into motion. Orly Wahba, Life Vest Inside Founder and Director of Kindness Boomerang explains that each scene was based on real life experiences she personally went through; moments of kindness that left a lasting impression on her life. Within several months after its release, Kindness Boomerang went viral; reaching over 20 million people globally and eventually landing Wahba spot on the TED2013&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn9VxUPlC5g "TED Talk - Kindness - Orly Wahba"], ''YouTube/TED Conferences''. Retrieved January 14, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; stage to speak about the power of kindness.

Listed below are '''the worst disasters in Poland's history''', listed '''by death toll'''. This list excludes warfare and intentional acts of destruction, but may include accidents in which the military, Polish or foreign, was involved (e.g. Osiecznica bus disaster - a collision between a Polish bus and a [[Northern Group of Forces|Soviet Army's]] truck).

Some of the disasters listed here occurred outside of current Polish borders (e.g. the [[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash|Smolensk Tu-154 crash]]) or in times when Poland was not internationally recognized (e.g. during the [[partitions of Poland]]), but the predominant number of victims were either Poles or Polish citizens.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2864">'''Lucius Aelius Lamia Plautius Aelianus''' (c. 45 - 81/96) was a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Roman senate|senator]], described by Brian W. Jones as "the most eminent of the consular victims" of [[Domitian]].&lt;ref name=Jones-184&gt;Jones, ''The Emperor Domitian'' (London: Routlege, 1993), p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juvenal]] used his family as representative of Domitian's most noble victims;&lt;ref&gt;''Satires'', IV.152&lt;/ref&gt; Lamia was [[Roman consul|consul suffect]] in 80 with three different colleagues: [[Aulus Didius Gallus Fabricius Veiento]], [[Quintus Aurelius Pactumeius Fronto]], and [[Gaius Marius Marcellus Octavius Publius Cluvius Rufus]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gallivan, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/638472 "The Fasti for A. D. 70-96"], ''[[Classical Quarterly]]'', 31 (1981),pp. 189, 215&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of scholars have concluded that Lamia was most likely a son of [[Tiberius Plautius Silvanus Aelianus]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederik Juliaan Vervaet provides a list: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/44079808 "A Note on Syme's Chronology of Vistilia's Children"], ''Ancient Society'', 30 (2000), p. 103 n. 23&lt;/ref&gt; He married [[Domitia Longina]], the daughter of the general [[Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo]] and Cassia Longina. Their son is thought to have been [[Lucius Fundanius Lamia Aelianus]], born before Domitian forced them to divorce.&lt;ref name=Jones-184/&gt;

Domitia was seduced by Domitian while his father [[Vespasian]] was still in [[Roman Egypt]] (AD 70); Domitian afterwards forced Lamia to divorce her so he could have her for himself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dio Cassius]], 66.3.4&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Lamia retained his sense of humor. Jones suspects it was his sense of humor, in the form of harmless jokes directed at the emperor, that led to his execution. Domitian was unable to handle personal criticism of any sort, and there was ample precedent for the laws of treason to be applied to writings of this kind.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, ''Domitian'', p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ludlow Massacre''' emanated from a labor conflict: the Colorado National Guard and Colorado Fuel and Iron Company guards attacked a tent colony of 1,200 striking [[coal miner]]s and their families at [[Ludlow, Colorado]], on April 20, 1914, with the National Guard using machine guns to fire into the colony. Approximately twenty-one people, including miners' wives and children, were killed. The chief owner of the mine, [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]], was widely excoriated for having orchestrated the massacre.&lt;ref name="DU"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The massacre, the seminal event in the [[Colorado Coalfield War|Colorado Coal Wars]] resulted in the deaths of an estimated twenty-one people; accounts vary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBEclayBCdc|title=The Invention of Public Relations|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Ludlow was the deadliest single incident in the southern Colorado Coal Strike, which lasted from September 1913 through December 1914.  The strike was organized by the miners against coal mining companies in Colorado. The three largest companies involved were [[Colorado Fuel &amp; Iron Company]], owned by the powerful Rockefeller family; [[Rocky Mountain Fuel Company]], and Victor-American Fuel Company.

In retaliation for the massacre at Ludlow, the miners armed themselves and attacked dozens of anti-union establishments over the next ten days, destroying property and engaging in several skirmishes with the Colorado National Guard along a 40-mile front from [[Trinidad, Colorado|Trinidad]] to [[Walsenburg, Colorado|Walsenburg]].&lt;ref name="DU"&gt;[http://www.du.edu/ludlow/cfhist3.html "Ludlow Massacre"], Denver University&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 69 to 199 deaths occurred during the entire strike. Thomas G. Andrews described it as the "deadliest strike in the history of the United States",&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 2008, 1&lt;/ref&gt; and it is commonly referred to as the [[Colorado Coalfield War]].

The Ludlow Massacre was a watershed moment in American labor relations. Historian [[Howard Zinn]] described this as "the culminating act of perhaps the most violent struggle between corporate power and laboring men in American history".&lt;ref&gt;Zinn 1990, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Congress responded to public outrage by directing the [[United States House Committee on Mines and Mining|House Committee on Mines and Mining]] to investigate the events.&lt;ref&gt;House Report&lt;/ref&gt; Its report, published in 1915, was influential in promoting [[Child labor laws in the United States|child labor laws]] and an eight-hour work day.

The Ludlow site, 18 miles northwest of [[Trinidad, Colorado]], is now a [[ghost town]].  The [[massacre]] site is owned by the United Mine Workers of America, which erected a granite [[Ludlow Monument|monument]] in memory of the miners and their families who died that day.&lt;ref name="McPhee"&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_12705764 McPhee, Mike. "Mining Strike Site in Ludlow Gets Feds' Nod."] ''[[Denver Post]].'' June 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Ludlow Tent Colony Site|Ludlow tent colony site]] was designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]] on January 16, 2009, and dedicated on June 28, 2009.&lt;ref name="McPhee"/&gt;  Evidence from modern [[archeology|archeological]] investigation largely supports the strikers' reports of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nps.gov/archeology/months/NP_NHL_Nomination_Ludlow.pdf|title=National Historic Landmark Nomination: Ludlow Tent Colony|last=R.

==Background==
[[Image:Ludlowtentcolonyfromthesurvey.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Ludlow Tent Colony Site|Ludlow tent colony]] prior to the massacre. The caption reads: "Ludlow, a canvas community of 900 souls, was riddled with machine guns shooting 400 bullets a minute. Then the tents were burned. The site is private property leased by the miners' union, which has supported the colony seven months."]]
Areas of the [[Rocky Mountains]] have veins of coal close to the surface of the land, providing significant and relatively accessible reserves. In 1867, these coal deposits caught the attention of [[William Jackson Palmer]], then leading a survey team planning the route of the [[Kansas Pacific Railway]]. The rapid expansion of [[rail transport in the United States]] made coal a highly valued commodity, and it was rapidly commercialized.

At its peak in 1910, the coal mining industry of Colorado employed 15,864 people, accounting for 10 percent of those employed in the state.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 2008, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Colorado's coal industry was dominated by a handful of operators. [[Colorado Fuel and Iron]], was the largest coal operator in the west, as well as one of the nation's most powerful corporations, at one point employing 7,050 individuals and controlling {{convert|71837|acre|km2}} of coal land.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 2008, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Colorado Fuel &amp; Iron Company was purchased by [[John D. Rockefeller]] in 1902, and nine years later he turned over his controlling interest in the company to his son, [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]], who managed the company from his offices at [[26 Broadway]] in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Zinn 1990, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mining was dangerous and difficult work. [[Coal Mining|Colliers]] in Colorado were at constant risk for explosion, suffocation, and collapsing mine walls. In 1912, the death rate in Colorado's mines was 7.055 per 1,000 employees, compared to a national rate of 3.15.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 2008, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, the [[United States House Committee on Mines and Mining]] reported that
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Colorado has good mining laws and such that ought to afford protection to the miners as to safety in the mine if they were enforced, yet in this State the percentage of fatalities is larger than any other, showing there is undoubtedly something wrong in reference to the management of its coal mines.&lt;ref name="Martelle 2008, p. 19"&gt;Martelle 2008, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Miners were generally paid according to tonnage of coal produced, while so-called "dead work", such as shoring up unstable roofs, was often unpaid.&lt;ref name="Martelle 2008, p. 19"/&gt; According to historian Thomas G. Andrews, the tonnage system drove many poor and ambitious colliers to gamble with their lives by neglecting precautions and taking on risk, with consequences that were often fatal.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 2008, p. 138–139&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1884 and 1912, mining accidents claimed the lives of more than 1,700 in Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 2008, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913 alone, "104 men would die in Colorado's mines, and 6 in the mine workings on the surface, in accidents that widowed 51 and left 108 children fatherless."&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 2008, p. 236–237&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ludlow striker family in front of tent.jpg|thumb|upright|Three women, wives of striking coal miners, and their children stand outside of a tent at the Ludlow colony.|left]]
Colliers had little opportunity to air their grievances. Many colliers resided in [[company town]]s, in which all land, real estate, and amenities were owned by the mine operator, and which were expressly designed to inculcate loyalty and squelch dissent.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 2008, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; [[Welfare capitalism|Welfare capitalists]] believed that anger and unrest among the workers could be placated by raising colliers' standard of living, while subsuming it under company management. Company towns indeed brought tangible improvements to the lives of many colliers and their families, including larger houses, better medical care, and broader access to education.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 2008, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; But, ownership of the towns provided companies considerable control over all aspects of workers' lives, and they did not always use this power to augment public welfare. Historian [[Philip S. Foner]] has described company towns as "[[Feudalism|feudal]] domain[s], with the company acting as lord and master. ... The 'law' consisted of the company rules. Curfews were imposed. Company guards – brutal thugs armed with machine guns and rifles loaded with [[soft-point bullet]]s – would not admit any 'suspicious' stranger into the camp and would not permit any miner to leave." Miners who came into conflict with the company were liable to find themselves and their families summarily evicted from their homes.&lt;ref&gt;Foner 1990, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frustrated by working conditions which they believed were unsafe and unjust, colliers increasingly turned to [[Trade union|union]]ism. Nationwide, organized mines boasted 40 percent fewer fatalities than nonunion mines.&lt;ref&gt;Martelle 2008, pg. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Colorado miners had repeatedly attempted to unionize since the state's first strike in 1883. The [[Western Federation of Miners]] organized primarily hard-rock miners in the [[gold mining|gold]] and [[silver mining|silver]] camps during the 1890s.

Beginning in 1900, the [[United Mine Workers of America]] began organizing coal miners in the [[western states]], including southern Colorado. The union decided to focus on the Colorado Fuel &amp; Iron Company because of its harsh management tactics under the conservative and distant Rockefellers and other investors. To break or prevent strikes, the coal companies hired [[strike breaker]]s, mainly from Mexico and southern and eastern Europe. The Colorado Fuel &amp; Iron Company's management mixed immigrants of different nationalities in the mines, a practice which discouraged communication that might lead to organization.

==Strike==

Despite attempts to suppress union activity, secret organizing by the United Mine Workers of America continued in the years leading up to 1913. Eventually, the union presented a list of seven demands on behalf of the miners:
[[File:Speakers at the Ludlow strike.png|thumb|Speakers at the Ludlow strike stand in an open top car and rally the striking workers.]]
#Recognition of the union as [[bargaining unit|bargaining agent]]
#Compensation for digging coal at a ton-rate based on 2,000 pounds&lt;ref&gt;[https://libcom.org/history/1914-the-ludlow-massacre]&lt;/ref&gt; (Previous ton-rates were of long-tons of 2,200 pounds)
#Enforcement of the [[Eight-hour day#United States|eight-hour work-day law]]
#Payment for "dead work" (laying track, [[Timber framing|timbering]], handling impurities, etc.)
#Weight-checkmen elected by the workers (to keep company weightmen honest)
#Right to use any store, and to choose their [[boarding house]]s and doctors
#Strict enforcement of Colorado's laws (such as mine safety rules, abolition of [[scrip]]), and an end to the company guard system

The major coal companies rejected the demands. In September 1913, the United Mine Workers of America called a strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zinn|first=Howard|year=1997|pp=187|title=[[The Zinn Reader]]|publisher=[[Seven Stories Press]]|isbn=978-1-583229-46-0|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who went on strike were evicted from their company homes, and they moved to tent villages prepared by the union.  The tents were built on wood platforms and furnished with cast iron stoves on land leased by the union in preparation for a strike.
[[File:Ludlow Death Car.jpg|thumb|Baldwin–Felts armored car known as the "Death Special" with mounted [[M1895 Colt–Browning machine gun|M1895 machine gun]].|left]]
When leasing the sites, the union had strategically selected tent locations near the mouths of canyons that led to the coal camps, for the purpose of blocking any [[Strikebreakers|strikebreakers']] traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lowry|first1=Sam|title=1914: The Ludlow massacre|url=https://libcom.org/files/1914%20Ludlow%20Massacre.pdf|website=Libcom.org|accessdate=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confrontations between striking miners and working miners, referred to as "scabs" by the union, sometimes resulted in deaths. The company hired the [[Baldwin–Felts Detective Agency]] to protect the new workers and harass the strikers.

Baldwin–Felts had a reputation for aggressive [[strike breaking]]. Agents shone searchlights on the tent villages at night and fired bullets into the tents at random, occasionally killing and maiming people. They used an improvised [[armored car (military)|armored car]], mounted with a [[M1895 Colt–Browning machine gun|machine gun]] the union called the "[[:File:Ludlow Death Car.jpg|Death Special]]" to patrol the camp's perimeters. The steel-covered car was built in the Colorado Fuel &amp; Iron Company plant in [[Pueblo, Colorado]] from the chassis of a large [[Touring car|touring sedan]]. Frequent [[sniper]] attacks on the tent colonies drove the miners to dig pits beneath the tents where they and their families could be better protected. Armed battles also occurred between (mostly Greek) strikers and sheriffs recently deputized to suppress the strike, thus earning the title "[[Colorado Coalfield War]]."&lt;ref&gt;Anthony R. DeStefanis, "The Road to Ludlow: Breaking the 1913-14 Southern Colorado Coal Strike," Journal of the Historical Society, 12 no. 2 (September 2012): 341-390.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:K E Linderfelt and troops ludlow massacre.png|thumb|[[Karl Linderfelt|Lt. Karl Linderfelt]] and the Colorado state militia, ride in on horseback to suppress the strike.]]
As strike-related violence mounted, Colorado governor [[Elias M. Ammons]] called in the Colorado National Guard on October 28. At first, the Guard's appearance calmed the situation, but the sympathies of Guard leaders lay with company management. Guard Adjutant-General [[John Chase (doctor and soldier)|John Chase]], who had served during the violent [[Cripple Creek, Colorado#History|Cripple Creek]] strike 10 years earlier, imposed a harsh regime. On March 10, 1914, the body of a replacement worker was found on the railroad tracks near Forbes, Colorado. The National Guard said that the man had been murdered by the strikers.&lt;ref name="DeStefanis, The Road to Ludlow."/&gt; In retaliation, Chase ordered the Forbes tent colony destroyed. The attack was launched while the residents were attending a funeral of two infants who had died a few days earlier. The attack was witnessed by photographer Lou Dold, whose images of the destruction appear often in accounts of the strike.&lt;ref name="DeStefanis, The Road to Ludlow."&gt;DeStefanis, "The Road to Ludlow."&lt;/ref&gt;

The strikers persevered until the spring of 1914. By then, according to historian Anthony DeStefanis, the National Guard had largely broken the strike by helping the mine operators bring in non-union workers. The state had also run out of money to maintain the Guard, and Governor Ammons decided to recall them.  The governor and the mining companies, fearing a breakdown in order, left one company of National Guardsmen in southern Colorado. They formed a new company called "Troop A", which consisted largely of Colorado Fuel &amp; Iron Company mine camp guards and mine guards hired by Baldwin–Felts, who were given National Guard uniforms to wear.&lt;ref name="DeStefanis, The Road to Ludlow."/&gt;

==Massacre==
[[File:The real insult to the flag.jpg|thumb|Sketch of the massacre from 1914, by Morris Hall Pancoast. Woman gasps for air while tents burn and Colorado state militiamen fire their rifles.|left]]
On the morning of April 20, the day after the Orthodox Easter was celebrated by some in the tent colony, three Guardsmen appeared at the camp ordering the release of a man they claimed was being held against his will. The camp leader, [[Louis Tikas]], left to meet with a local militia commander at the train station in Ludlow village, a half mile (0.8&amp;nbsp;km) from the colony. While this meeting was progressing, two companies of militia installed a machine gun on a ridge near the camp and took a position along a rail route about half a mile south of Ludlow. Anticipating trouble, Tikas ran back to the camp. The miners set out to flank the militia positions and a gunfight soon broke out. When two dynamite explosions by the militia alerted the Ludlow tent colony, the miners took up positions at the bottom of the hill. When the militia opened fire, hundreds of miners and their families ran for cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nps.gov/archeology/months/NP_NHL_Nomination_Ludlow.pdf|title=National Historic Landmark Nomination: Ludlow Tent Colony|last=R. Laurie Simmons|first=|last2=Thomas H. Simmons|last3=Charles Haecker|last4=Erika Martin Siebert|publisher=National Park Service|year=May 2008|isbn=|location=|pages=41-42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fighting raged for the entire day. The militia was reinforced by non-uniformed mine guards later in the afternoon. At dusk, a passing freight train stopped on the tracks in front of the Guards' machine-gun placements, allowing many of the miners and their families to escape to an outcrop of hills to the east called the "Black Hills." By 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., the camp was in flames, and the militia descended on it and began to search and loot the camp. Tikas had remained in the camp the entire day and was still there when the fire started. Tikas and two other men were captured by the militia. Tikas and Lt. [[Karl Linderfelt]], commander of one of two Guard companies, had confronted each other several times in the previous months. While two militiamen held Tikas, Linderfelt broke a rifle butt over his head. Tikas and the other two captured miners were later found shot dead. Tikas had been shot in the back.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 2008, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/ludlowmassacrere00finkrich|title=The Ludlow Massacre|last=Fink|first=Walter H.|date=1914|publisher=Denver, Williamson-Haffner|others=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their bodies lay along the [[Colorado and Southern Railway]] tracks for three days in full view of passing trains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/ludlowmassacrere00finkrich|title=The Ludlow Massacre|last=Fink|first=Walter H.|date=1914|publisher=Denver, Williamson-Haffner, printers|others=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The militia officers refused to allow them to be moved until a local of a railway union demanded the bodies be taken away for burial.

During the battle, four women and eleven children had been hiding in a pit beneath one tent, where they were trapped when the tent above them was set on fire. Two of the women and all of the children suffocated. These deaths became a rallying cry for the United Mine Workers of America, who called the incident the "Ludlow Massacre."&lt;ref&gt;Zinn, H. [http://www.spunk.org/texts/places/us/sp000937.txt "The Ludlow Massacre"], Excerpt from ''A People's History of the United States''. pgs 346–349.&lt;/ref&gt;

Julia May Courtney reported different numbers in her contemporaneous article "Remember Ludlow!" for the magazine ''[[Mother Earth (magazine)|Mother Earth]]''. She said that, in addition to men who were killed, a total of 55 women and children had died in the massacre. According to her account, the militia:

From the blazing tents rushed the women and children, only to be beaten back into the fire by the rain of bullets from the militia. The men rushed to the assistance of their families; and as they did so, they were dropped as the whirring messengers of death sped surely to the mark... into the cellars—the pits of hell under their blazing tents—crept the women and children, less fearful of the smoke and flames than of the nameless horror of the spitting bullets. One man counted the bodies of nine little children, taken from one ashy pit, their tiny fingers burned away as they held to the edge in their struggle to escape... thugs in State uniform hacked at the lifeless forms, in some instances nearly cutting off heads and limbs to show their contempt for the strikers. Fifty-five women and children perished in the fire of the Ludlow tent colony. Relief parties carrying the Red Cross flag were driven back by the gunmen, and for twenty-four hours the bodies lay crisping in the ashes, while rescuers vainly tried to cross the firing line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BmQMrzppDU0C&amp;pg=PA280&amp;lpg=PA280&amp;dq=Julia+May+Courtney+remember+ludlow+anarchist+colorado&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=guyf9eld9F&amp;sig=TD9nzfxvKdfY85OMVRr5S0yR9jE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZ05_D_prUAhVLziYKHRBEC7wQ6AEIJjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Julia%20May%20Courtney%20remember%20ludlow%20anarchist%20colorado&amp;f=false|title=Voices of a People's History of the United States|last=Zinn|first=Howard|last2=Arnove|first2=Anthony|date=2004|publisher=Seven Stories Press|year=|isbn=9781583226285|location=|pages=280–282|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zstCAQAAMAAJ|title=Mother Earth|last=Julia|first=Courtney|date=May 1914|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=73|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In the aftermath of the massacre, the Ten Day War ensued which was part of the wider [[Colorado Coalfield War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8o6dAwAAQBAJ|title=Disasters and Tragic Events: An Encyclopedia of Catastrophes in American History [2 volumes]|last=Newton-Matza|first=Mitchell|date=2014-03-26|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=|isbn=9781610691666|location=|pages=223|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As news of the deaths of women and children spread, the leaders of organized labor issued a call to arms. They urged union members to get "all the arms and ammunition legally available". Subsequently, a wide-scale guerrilla war by the coal miners began against the mine guards and facilities located throughout Colorado's southern coalfields. In the town of [[Trinidad, Colorado|Trinidad]], the United Mine Workers of America openly and officially distributed arms and ammunition to strikers at union headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T6bqCQAAQBAJ|title=Strikebreaking and Intimidation: Mercenaries and Masculinity in Twentieth-Century America|last=Norwood|first=Stephen H.|date=2003-04-03|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|year=|isbn=9780807860465|location=|pages=148|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next ten days, 700 to 1,000 strikers "attacked mine after mine, driving off or killing the guards and setting fire to the buildings." At least fifty people, including those at Ludlow, were killed during the ten days of fighting between the mine guards and miners. Hundreds of state militia reinforcements were rushed to the coalfields to regain control of the situation.&lt;ref&gt;Norwood 2002, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; The fighting, however, only ended after President [[Woodrow Wilson]] sent in federal troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A1C4W2IVHcMC|title=Revolts, Protests, Demonstrations, and Rebellions in American History: An Encyclopedia|last=Danver|first=Steven Laurence|date=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=|isbn=9781598842210|location=|pages=710|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The troops, who reported directly to Washington, DC, disarmed both sides, displacing and often arresting the militia in the process.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} The Colorado Coalfield War produced a total death toll of approximately 75 people.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bBHpAwAAQBAJ|title=Violence in the West: The Johnson County Range War and the Ludlow Massacre—A Brief History with Documents|last=Johnson|first=Marilynn S.|date=2014-06-05|publisher=Waveland Press|year=|isbn=9781478623045|location=|pages=28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Mine Workers of America finally ran out of money, and called off the strike on December 10, 1914.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the end, the strikers failed to obtain their demands, the union did not obtain recognition, and many striking workers were replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v76N-1KkrgwC|title=Three Strikes: Miners, Musicians, Salesgirls, and the Fighting Spirit of Labor's Last Century|last=Zinn|first=Howard|last2=Frank|first2=Dana|last3=Kelley|first3=Robin D.

==Legacy==
[[Image:Ludlow Monument Cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ludlow Monument]] was erected by the United Mine Workers of America.]]

Although the UMWA failed to win recognition by the company, the strike had a lasting effect both on conditions at the Colorado mines and on labor relations nationally. John D. Rockefeller, Jr. engaged [[W. L. Mackenzie King]], a labor relations expert and future Canadian Prime Minister, to help him develop reforms for the mines and towns. Improvements included paved roads and recreational facilities, as well as worker representation on committees dealing with [[working conditions]], safety, health, and recreation. He prohibited discrimination against workers who had belonged to unions, and ordered the establishment of a [[company union]]. The Rockefeller plan was accepted by the miners in a vote.

Rockefeller also brought in pioneer public relations expert [[Ivy Lee]], who warned that the Rockefellers were losing public support and developed a strategy that Junior followed to repair it. Junior had to overcome his shyness, go personally to Colorado to meet with the miners and their families, inspect the conditions of the homes and the factories, attend social events, and especially to listen closely to the grievances. This was novel advice, and attracted widespread media attention. The Rockefellers were able both to resolve the conflict, and present a more humanized versions of their leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Heath, ed.. ''Encyclopedia of Public Relations'' (2005) 1:485&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, Ludlow has assumed "a striking centrality in the interpretation of the nation's history developed by several of the most important left-leaning thinkers of the twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 2008, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Howard Zinn]] wrote his master's thesis and several book chapters on Ludlow. While in graduate school, [[George McGovern]] (1922-2012) wrote his doctoral dissertation on the subject, later published in book form as ''The Great Coalfield War''. He was a historian, former United States Senator and Democratic presidential nominee.

A United States [[Commission on Industrial Relations]] (CIR), headed by labor lawyer [[Frank P. Walsh|Frank Walsh]], conducted hearings in Washington, DC, collecting information and taking [[testimony]] from all the principals, including John D. Rockefeller, Sr.  He testified that, even after knowing that guards in his pay had committed atrocities against the strikers, he "would have taken no action" to prevent his hirelings from attacking them.&lt;ref&gt;Beverly Gage, ''The Day Wall Street Exploded,'' Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; The commission's report suggested many reforms sought by the unions, and provided support for bills establishing a national [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour workday]] and a ban on [[child labor]].

In 1916, the United Mine Workers of America bought the site of the Ludlow tent colony. Two years later, they erected the Ludlow Monument to commemorate those who had died during the strike. The monument was damaged in May 2003 by unknown vandals. The repaired monument was unveiled on June 5, 2005, with slightly altered faces on the statues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rebelgraphics.org/ludlow.html Picture of Ludlow Monument]&lt;/ref&gt; On January 16, 2009, the [[Ludlow Tent Colony Site|Ludlow tent colony site]] was declared a U.S. [[National Historic Landmark]]. The citation describes the Ludlow Massacre as "a pivotal event in American history" and notes that its site is the first of its kind to be investigated by archeologists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doi.gov/news/pressreleases/2009_01_16_releaseC.cfm?renderforprint=1&amp; News Release: Interior Secretary Kempthorne Designates 9 National Historic Landmarks in 9 States (01/16/2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The last survivor of the Ludlow Massacre, Ermenia "Marie" Padilla Daley, was 3 months old during the event. She celebrated her 104th birthday on January 13, 2018. Her father was a miner and she was born in the camp. Her mother took her and her siblings away as violence escalated; they traveled by train to Trinidad, Colorado. The evacuation resulted in the family having to split up afterward. Daley was cared for by various families, and also was placed for a time in orphanages in Pueblo and Denver. She worked as a housekeeper, then married a consultant whose work allowed them to travel the world. Even with a difficult start, she kept a positive attitude about life. She sang happily at her 104th birthday party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.9news.com/article/life/one-of-the-last-living-survivors-of-the-ludlow-massacre-celebrates-104th-birthday/73-507622133]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation in other media==
Several popular songs have been written and recorded about the events at Ludlow. Among them is "[[Ludlow Massacre (song)|Ludlow Massacre]]" by American folk singer [[Woody Guthrie]], "Ludlow" by [[Texas country music|Texas country]] singer [[Jason Boland &amp; The Stragglers|Jason Boland]], "Ludlow" by [[New Albany, Indiana]] band [[Houndmouth]], and "The Monument (Lest We Forget)" by Irish musician [[Andy Irvine (musician)|Andy Irvine]].

The novel [[King Coal (book)|''King Coal'']] by [[Upton Sinclair]] is loosely based on the origin and aftermath of the Ludlow Massacre. [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s 2006 novel, ''[[Against the Day]]'', contains a chapter on the massacre.

American writer and Colorado Poet Laureate [[David Mason (writer)|David Mason]] wrote what he calls a verse-novel, ''[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/811251.LUDLOW Ludlow]'' (2007), that was inspired by this labor dispute. Composer [[Lori Laitman]] is composing an opera ''Ludlow'', in conjunction with Mason and based on his book. The University of Colorado's New Opera Works presented Act I of the opera in June 2012, directed by Beth Greenberg.

==Centennial recognition==
On April 19, 2013, Colorado Governor [[John Hickenlooper]] signed an executive order to create the Ludlow Centennial Commemoration Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gov. Hickenlooper creates Ludlow Centennial Commemoration Commission|url=http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite/GovHickenlooper/CBON/1251641764396|website=Colorado: The Official State Web Portal|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group worked to develop programming in the state, such as lectures and exhibits, to commemorate the Ludlow workers' struggle and raise awareness of the massacre. It worked with Colorado museums, historical societies, churches and art galleries, and supplied programming in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saitta|first1=Dean|title=Deadly Ludlow strike resonates 100 years later|url=http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_23976508/deadly-ludlow-strike-resonates-100-years-later|accessdate=21 July 2014|agency=Denver Post|date=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical investigation==

===Archaeology===
In 1996, the 1913&amp;ndash;1914 [[Colorado Coalfield War]] Project began under the leadership of [[Randall H. McGuire]] of [[Binghamton University]], Dean Saitta of [[University of Denver]], and Philip Duke of [[Fort Lewis College]], who later formed the Ludlow Collective. Their team conducted excavations of the territory of the former tent colony and surrounding areas.&lt;ref name="McGuire 189"&gt;{{harvnb|McGuire|2008|p=189}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Man-eater''' is a colloquial term for an individual animal that preys on humans as a pattern of hunting behavior. This does not include the scavenging of corpses, a single attack born of opportunity or desperate hunger, or the incidental eating of a human that the animal has killed in self-defense. However, all three cases (especially the last two) may habituate an animal to eating human flesh or to [[animal attacks|attacking humans]], and may foster the development of man-eating behavior.

Although human beings can be attacked by many kinds of animals, man-eaters are those that have incorporated human flesh into their usual diet and actively hunt and kill humans. Most reported cases of man-eaters have involved [[lion]]s, [[tiger]]s, [[leopard]]s,&lt;ref name="CC"&gt;{{cite book| last = Corbett
|first = Jim| title = Man-eaters of Kumaon| pages = viii–xiii| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Time Magazine Canadian edition, Saving The Big Cats, issue August 23, 2004, p.38, pp.40-41.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[crocodilian]]s. However, they are by no means the only predators that will attack humans if given the chance; a wide variety of species have also been known to adopt humans as usual prey, including [[bear]]s, [[Komodo dragon]]s and [[hyena]]s.

===Tigers===
{{main|Man-eating tigers}}
&lt;!--[[File:Tigress-Jowlagiri.jpg|thumb|The [[Tigress of Jowlagiri]], responsible for the deaths of 15 people, killed by [[Kenneth Anderson (writer)|Kenneth Anderson]]]]--&gt;
Tigers are recorded to have killed more people than any other big cat, and tigers have been responsible for more human deaths through direct attack than any other wild mammal.&lt;ref name="Nowak, Ronald M 1983"&gt;Nowak, Ronald M; and Paradiso, John L. Walker's Mammals of the World. 4th ed. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press; 1983. p1088&lt;/ref&gt; About 1,000 people were reportedly killed each year in India during the early 1900s, with [[Champawat tigress|one individual tiger]] killing 430 people in India.&lt;ref name="Nowak, Ronald M 1983"/&gt; Tigers killed 129 people in the Sundarbans mangrove forest from 1969 to 1971.&lt;ref name="Nowak, Ronald M 1983"/&gt;  Unlike leopards and lions, man-eating tigers rarely enter human habitations in order to acquire prey. The majority of victims are reportedly in the tiger's territory when the attack takes place.&lt;ref name="GC"/&gt; Additionally, tiger attacks mostly occur during daylight hours, unlike those committed by leopards and lions.&lt;ref name="GC"&gt;{{cite book | author = John Seidensticker and Susan Lumpkin| title = Great Cats | year = 1991 | page = 240 | isbn = 978-0-87857-965-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Sundarbans]] is home to approximately 600 [[royal Bengal tiger]]s&lt;ref name="Maneaters"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maneaters: The Sundarbans|url=http://www.lairweb.org.nz/tiger/maneating7.html|publisher=lairweb|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who before modern times used to "regularly kill fifty or sixty people a year".&lt;ref name="Maneaters" /&gt; In 2008, a loss of habitat due to the [[Cyclone Sidr]] led to an increase in the number of attacks on humans in the Indian side of the Sunderbans, as tigers were crossing over to the Indian side from Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=tiger_2008&gt;{{cite news|title=Tiger attacks on rise in Indian Sundarbans|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-tiger-attacks-on-rise-in-indian-sundarbans-1180734|accessdate=11 March 2014|newspaper=[[DNA India]]|date=30 July 2008|agency=[[Indo-Asian News Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A theory promoted to explain this suggests that since tigers drink [[fresh water]], the [[salinity]] of the area waters serve as a destabilizing factor in the diet and life of tigers of Sundarbans, keeping them in constant discomfort and making them extremely aggressive. Other theories include the sharing of their habitat with human beings and the consumption of human corpses during floods.&lt;ref name="Maneaters" /&gt;

===Lions===
{{See also|Lion#Man-eating}}
[[File:Lionsoftsavo2008.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Tsavo maneaters]] on display in the [[Field Museum of Natural History]].]]
Man-eating lions have been recorded to actively enter human villages at night as well as during the day to acquire prey. This greater assertiveness usually makes man-eating lions easier to dispatch than tigers. Lions typically become man-eaters for the same reasons as tigers: starvation, old age and illness, though as with tigers, some man-eaters were reportedly in perfect health.&lt;ref name="GC"/&gt;

The lion's proclivity for man-eating has been systematically examined. American and Tanzanian scientists report that man-eating behavior in rural areas of Tanzania increased greatly from 1990 to 2005. At least 563 villagers were attacked and many eaten over this period—a number far exceeding the more famed "Tsavo" incidents of a century earlier. The incidents occurred near [[Selous Game Reserve|Selous National Park]] in [[Rufiji River|Rufiji District]] and in [[Lindi Region|Lindi Province]] near the Mozambican border. While the expansion of villagers into bush country is one concern, the authors argue that conservation policy must mitigate the danger because, in this case, conservation contributes directly to human deaths. Cases in Lindi have been documented where lions seize humans from the centre of substantial villages. It is estimated that over 250 people are killed by lions every year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/wildlife/5149977/Top-10-deadliest-animals-on-the-planet.html Top 10 deadliest animals on the planet], [[The Daily Telegraph]], April 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Man-eating lions studies indicate that [[African lion]]s eat humans as a supplement to other food, not as a last resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/04/man-eating-lions-teeth-kenya|title=Why Man-Eating Lions Prey on People—New Evidence|date=2017-04-19|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DeSantis|first=Larisa R.

Man-eating leopards are a small percentage of all leopards, but have undeniably been a menace in some areas;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Nowak, Ronald M; and Paradiso, John L. Walker's Mammals of the World. 4th ed. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press; 1983. p1090&lt;/ref&gt; one leopard in India killed over 200 people.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Jim Corbett]] was noted to have stated that unlike tigers, which usually became man-eaters because of infirmity, leopards more commonly did so after scavenging on human corpses. In the area that Corbett knew well, dead people are usually [[cremated]] completely, but when there is a bad disease epidemic, the death rate outruns the supply of cremation [[pyre]] wood and people burn the body a little and throw it over the edge of the [[burning ghat]].&lt;ref&gt;books by [[Jim Corbett]]&lt;/ref&gt; In Asia, man-eating leopards usually attack at night, and have been reported to break down doors and thatched roofs in order to reach human prey. Attacks in Africa are reported less often, though there have been occasions where attacks occurred in daylight. Both Corbett and Kenneth Anderson have written that hunting the man eating panther presented more challenges than any other animal.

===Jaguars===
{{See also|Jaguar#Man-eating}}
Jaguar attacks on humans are rare nowadays.&lt;ref name="AHT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=787643&amp;CategoryId=12393 |title=Latin American Herald Tribune - Jaguar Kills Fisherman on Colombia's Caribbean Coast |publisher=Laht.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, they were more frequent, at least after the arrival of [[Conquistador]]s in the [[Americas]]. The risk to humans would increase if there were fewer [[capybara]]s, which the jaguars mainly preyed on.&lt;ref name="Porter1894"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/wildbeastsstud00port#page/n197/mode/2up |title=Wild beasts; a study of the characters and habits of the elephant, lion, leopard, panther, jaguar, tiger, puma, wolf, and grizzly bear |author=John Hampden Porter |year=1894 |page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cougars===
{{Main|List of fatal cougar attacks in North America}}
Due to the expanding human population, cougar ranges increasingly overlap with areas inhabited by humans. Attacks on humans are very rare, as cougar prey recognition is a learned behavior and they do not generally recognize humans as prey.&lt;ref&gt;Time Magazine Canadian edition, Saving The Big Cats, issue August 23, 2004, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt; Attacks on people, livestock, and pets may occur when a puma habituates to humans or is in a condition of severe starvation. Attacks are most frequent during late spring and summer, when juvenile cougars leave their mothers and search for new territory. Unlike other big cat man-eaters, cougars do not kill humans as a result of old age or food preference, but in defense of their territory. Such behavior has been documented in hunts by humans, where the cougar is flushed out by dogs which it either outruns or mauls some distance away. Then, the cougar circles around and mauls the hunter in ambush attack. Cougars living close to human habitat will view the humans as passing livestock, and attack women and children on occasion.

==Primates==
The only documented man-eaters among the [[great ape]]s are [[Human cannibalism|humans themselves]] and [[common chimpanzee]]s, who prey on human infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2004/demonicapetrans.shtml|title=BBC - Science &amp; Nature - Horizon - Demonic Ape|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0304/feature4/online_extra2.html |title=Online Extra: Frodo @ National Geographic Magazine |publisher=Ngm.nationalgeographic.com |date=2002-05-15 |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

===Wolves===
{{main|Wolf attacks on humans}}
[[File:Wolves of Perigord.jpg|thumb|Two of the [[Wolves of Périgord]], responsible for the deaths of 18 people in February 1766, on display at the chateau of Razac in [[Thiviers]].]]
Contrasted to other carnivorous mammals known to attack humans for food, the frequency with which wolves have been recorded to kill people is rather low, indicating that, though potentially dangerous, wolves are among the least threatening for their size and predatory potential, except for the dog which poses [[dog attack|lethal hazards for reasons other than predation]]. In the rare cases in which man-eating wolf attacks occur, the majority of victims are children.&lt;ref name="Attacks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nina.no/archive/nina/Publikasjoner/oppdragsmelding/NINA-OM731.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Fear of Wolves: A Review of Wolf Attacks on Humans |publisher=Norsk Institutt for Naturforskning |accessdate=26 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927173051/http://www.nina.no/archive/nina/Publikasjoner/oppdragsmelding/NINA-OM731.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Habituation]] is a known factor contributing to some man-eating wolf attacks which results from living close to human habitations, causing wolves to lose their fear of humans and consequently approach too closely, much like urban coyotes. Habituation can also happen when people intentionally encourage wolves to approach them, usually by offering them food, or unintentionally, when people do not sufficiently intimidate them.&lt;ref name="Attacks" /&gt; This is corroborated by accounts demonstrating that wolves in protected areas are more likely to show [[boldness]] toward humans than ones in areas where they are actively hunted.&lt;ref name="WOLVES"&gt;{{cite book | author= L. David Mech &amp; Luigi Boitani | title=Wolves: Behaviour, Ecology and Conservation | year=2001 | page= 448 | isbn= 978-0-226-51696-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dingoes===
{{Main|Azaria Chamberlain disappearance}}
Attacks on humans by [[dingo]]es are rare, with only two recorded fatalities in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New turn in 1980 dingo death mystery |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5378661/ns/world_news/t/new-turn-dingo-death-mystery/ |website=msnbc.com |accessdate=12 November 2018 |language=en |date=6 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dingoes are normally shy of humans and avoid encounters with them. The most famous record of a dingo attack was the disappearance of nine-week-old Azaria Chamberlain. Her parents reported that they both saw a dingo taking Azaria out of their tent when she and her family were out on a camping trip to [[Uluru]].

===Domestic dogs===
{{Main|Dog attack}}
Much like other large land carnivores, domestic dogs have the power, strength, speed, agility, voraciousness, intelligence, cunning, and bite force of mammalian species generally understood as man-eaters. Add to this the sort of organization that one associates with lions, hyenas, and wolves, and even a pack of small dogs is potentially as lethal as a single large predator.  Predatory attacks by dogs (like wolves) on livestock and wildlife larger than humans demonstrate the potential of a dog as a man-eater. A large dog or a pack of dogs of adequate number depending on size of the dogs has the capacity to kill a human even without predatory intent, and most fatal [[dog attack]]s do not result from hunger. Self-extrication from a dog attack is extremely difficult. Of the larger predatory land animals, the dog is arguably the least likely to kill humans as prey. Pet dogs are ordinarily too well fed to contemplate humans as food, and even strays are likely to find food through scavenging or begging.

Predatory acts by dogs upon humans have occurred, and many such incidents were the result of human misconduct. Guards such as [[Irma Grese]] and [[Kurt Franz]] reportedly set dogs upon live prisoners in Nazi concentration camps with the dog killing the victim and partially devouring the corpse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/irma.html |title=Irma Grese |publisher=Capitalpunishmentuk.org |date= |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arad&gt;[[Yitzhak Arad]] (1987). ''Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka: The Operation Reinhard Death Camps'', Bloomington: Indiana University Press, pp. 189-190.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coyotes===
Although there have been a number of them, almost all known predatory [[coyote attacks on humans]] have failed.  To date, other than the [[Kelly Keen coyote attack]] and the [[Taylor Mitchell coyote attack]], all known victims have survived by fighting, fleeing, or being rescued, and only in the latter case was the victim partially eaten, although that case occurred in [[Nova Scotia]] where the local animals are [[eastern coyote]]s ([[coywolves]]).

==Bears==
{{Main|Bear attacks}}
Polar bears, being almost completely unused to the presence of humans and therefore having no ingrained fear of them, will hunt people for food, though with the right precautions they are easily deterred.  Although bears rarely attack humans, bear attacks often cause devastating injuries due to the size and immense strength of the giant land and shoreline carnivores. As with dogs, predatory intent is not necessary; territorial disputes and protection of cubs can result in death by bear attack. Truly man-eating bear attacks are uncommon, but are known to occur when the animals are diseased or natural prey is scarce, often leading them to attack and eat anything they are able to kill. In July 2008, dozens of starving bears killed two geologists working at a [[fish hatchery|salmon hatchery]] in [[Kamchatka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Russian bears trap geology survey crew |first=Alexei |last=Dovbysh |publisher=Reuters |date=22 July 2008 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL22583868 |accessdate=24 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the partially eaten remains of the two workers were discovered, authorities responded by dispatching hunters to cull or disperse the bears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bears eat two men in Russia's eastern wilderness |first=Luke |last=Harding |publisher=The Guardian |date=23 July 2008 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/23/russia.animalbehaviour |accessdate=24 April 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lone, predatory black bears are responsible for most human attacks in the United States and Canada, according to a study from 2011.  Unlike female bears, motivated to attack humans to protect cubs, male black bears actually prey on humans, viewing them as a potential food source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Herrero | first1 = S. | last2 = Higgins | first2 = A. | last3 = Cardoza | first3 = J.

==Hyenas==
Although [[hyena]]s readily feed upon human corpses, they are generally very wary of humans and less dangerous than the big cats whose territory overlaps with theirs. Nonetheless, both the [[spotted hyena]] and the smaller [[striped hyena]] are powerful predators quite capable of killing an adult human, and are known to attack people when food is scarce. Like most predators, hyena attacks tend to target women, children, and infirm men, though both species can and do attack healthy adult males on occasion. The spotted hyena is the more dangerous of the two species, being larger, more predatory, and more aggressive than the striped hyena. The [[brown hyena]] and [[aardwolf]] are not known to prey on humans.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Pigs===

Although not true carnivores, [[pig]]s are competent predators and can kill and eat helpless humans unable to escape them.&lt;ref name=pig_mafia&gt;{{cite news|title=Mafia fed rival to pigs while he was still alive|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/10480945/Mafia-fed-rival-to-pigs-while-he-was-still-alive.html|accessdate=11 March 2014|newspaper=[[Telegraph Media Group|The Telegraph]]|date=28 November 2013|location=London|first=Nick|last=Squires}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason = A mobster might not be the most reliable source.|date=December 2015}} Numerous [[animal trial]]s in the [[Middle Ages]] involved pigs accused of eating children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/criminalprosecut00evaniala|title=The criminal prosecution and capital punishment of animals|first=E.

Despite small individual size, [[rat]]s in large numbers can kill helpless people by eating humans alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=May 9, 2013 13:52 BST |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/german-man-frank-herrmann-dies-eaten-alive-466227 |title=Homeless Man Eaten Alive by Rats in Majorca |publisher=Ibtimes.co.uk |date=2013-05-09 |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the bite of one rat is unlikely to kill a person except through disease, the collective damage of dozens of rats can cause death by shock and damage to vital organs. Although not true carnivores, rats are unfussy eaters and social predators should the opportunity arise.

[[Rat torture]] has been used upon political prisoners,{{cn|date=January 2018}} and not only in such fiction as ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.

==Reptiles==
[[File:Crocodile in Kachikali kevinzim.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Nile crocodile]] is one of the species involved in the most unprovoked fatal attacks on humans.]]

===Crocodiles===
{{Main|Crocodile attack}}
Crocodile attacks on people are common in places where crocodiles are native. The [[Saltwater crocodile|saltwater]] and [[Nile crocodile]]s are responsible for more attacks and more deaths than any other wild predator that attacks humans for food. Each year, hundreds of deadly attacks are attributed to the Nile crocodile within [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. Because many relatively healthy populations of Nile crocodiles occur in East Africa, their proximity to people living in poverty and/or without infrastructure has made it likely that the Nile crocodile is responsible for more attacks on humans than all other species combined.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} In Australia crocodiles have also been responsible for several deaths in the tropical north of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/recent-crocodile-deaths-in-australia-20090411-a3b2.html |title=Recent crocodile deaths in Australia |website=Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax Media |date=11 April 2009 |access-date=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mugger crocodile]] is another man-eater that kills many people in Asia each year, although not to the same level as the Saltwater and Nile crocodiles. A lot of other crocodile species are also dangerous to humans, but most of the others will usually not actively try to hunt them.

===Alligators===
{{main|List of fatal alligator attacks in the United States by decade}}
Despite their manifest ability to kill prey similar to or larger than humans in size and their commonness in an area of dense human settlement (the southeastern United States, especially Florida), [[American alligator]]s rarely prey upon humans.  Even so, there have been several notable instances of alligators opportunistically attacking humans, especially the careless, small children, and elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/2a1e6528c6e74f0084988e2aa0d00a34/deputies-gator-drags-toddler-water-near-disney-resort|title=Body of boy snatched by gator found in Disney lagoon|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the far-more dangerous saltwater and Nile crocodiles, the majority of alligators avoid contact with humans if possible, especially if they have been hunted. Incidents have happened,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.aol.com/story/_a/aggressive-gator-kills-burglary-suspect/20071113224509990001?ncid=NWS00010000000001 |title='Aggressive' Gator Kills Burglary Suspect - AOL News |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-11-16 |accessdate=2016-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116160533/http://news.aol.com/story/_a/aggressive-gator-kills-burglary-suspect/20071113224509990001?ncid=NWS00010000000001 |archivedate=16 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and they may not all have been predatory in nature.

===Snakes===
Only very few species of snakes are physically capable of swallowing an adult human. Although quite a few claims have been made about giant snakes swallowing adult humans, only a limited number have been confirmed. Large constricting snakes will sometimes constrict and kill prey that are too large to swallow. Also, multiple cases are documented of medium-sized ({{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}}) captive [[Burmese python]]s constricting and killing humans, including several nonintoxicated, healthy adult men, one of whom was a "student" zookeeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Herszenhorn |first=David |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/10/nyregion/13-foot-long-pet-python-kills-its-caretaker.html |title=13-Foot-Long Pet Python Kills Its Caretaker |location=New York City |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=1996-10-10 |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/pet-snake-eyed-death-python-found-body-article-1.732513 |title=Pet Snake Eyed In Death Python Found With Body |publisher=NY Daily News |date=1996-10-10 |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Animal Attack Files Archives |url=http://igorilla.com/gorilla/animal/2002/python_strangles_owner2.html |title=Owner Killed by Snake had been Warned in '98 |publisher=Igorilla.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|author=2:07AM BST 26 Aug 2008 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2622427/Python-kills-careless-student-zookeeper-in-Caracas.html |title=Python kills careless student zookeeper in Caracas |publisher=Telegraph |date=2008-08-26 |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the zookeeper case, the python was attempting to swallow the zookeeper's head when other keepers intervened.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;  In addition, at least one Burmese python as small as {{convert|2.7|m|ft|abbr=on}} constricted and killed an intoxicated adult man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidehalton.com/news-story/3925857-brampton-inquest-called-for-python-ban-20-years-ago/ |title=Brampton inquest called for python ban 20 years ago |publisher=Insidehalton.com |date=2013-08-06 |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large constricting snake may constrict or swallow an infant or a small child, a threat that is legitimate and empirically proven.

In the [[Philippines]], more than a quarter of [[Aeta peoples|Aeta]] men (a modern forest-dwelling hunter-gatherer group) have reported surviving [[reticulated python]] predation attempts.&lt;ref name="Headland&amp;Greene2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Headland |first1=T.

In South Africa in 2002, a 10-year-old boy was swallowed whole by a 20-foot-long African Rock Python. (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/1414171/Hunt-for-giant-snake-that-ate-10-year-old-Durban-boy-whole.html)

The only group of snakes able to eat an adult human being are the largest constrictors (pythons and anacondas, all nonvenomous), which include the [[largest snakes in the world]]:
*[[Green anaconda]]
*[[Reticulated python]]
*[[Burmese python]]
*[[African rock python]]
*[[Amethystine python]]
*[[Indian python]]

In 2017 in Indonesia, an [[Akbar Salubiro|adult was discovered inside of a 7 metre long python]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/missing-man-found-dead-in-belly-of-7m-long-python-report|title=Missing man found dead in belly of 7m-long python in Indonesia: Report|last=paulam@st|date=2017-03-29|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2017-06-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on June 14, 2018 a 54 year old women named Wa Tiba was eaten by a reticulated python, which had slithered into her garden at her home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/7-meter-long-python-swallows-indonesian-woman|title=7-meter-long python swallows Indonesian woman|date=2018-06-16|work=National Post|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lizards===
Large [[Komodo dragon]]s are the only known lizard species to occasionally attack and consume humans. Because they live on remote islands, attacks are infrequent and may go unreported. Despite their large size, attacks on people are often unsuccessful and the victims manage to escape (although severe wounds are usually sustained).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/10/13/komodo-dragon-bites-elderly-woman-rinca-island.html |title=Komodo dragon bites elderly woman on Rinca Island |accessdate=12 February 2014 |date=13 October 2012 |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |publisher=Niskala Media Tenggara}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most instances, humans consumed by Komodos are corpses dug from shallow graves by the lizards.

==Birds==
Some evidence supports the contention that the [[Crowned eagle|African crowned eagle]] occasionally views human children as prey, with a witness account of one attack (in which the victim, a seven-year-old boy, survived and the eagle was killed),&lt;ref&gt;Steyn, P. 1982. Birds of prey of southern Africa: their identification and life histories. David Phillip, Cape Town, South Africa.&lt;/ref&gt; and the discovery of part of a human child skull in a nest. This would make it the only living bird known to prey on humans, although other birds such as ostriches and cassowaries have killed humans in self-defense and a [[lammergeier]] might have killed [[Aeschylus]] by accident.&lt;ref&gt;el Hoyo, J.; Elliott, A.; Sargatal, J., eds. (1994). Handbook of the Birds of the World. 2. Barcelona: Lynx Edicions. p. 107. {{ISBN|84-87334-15-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Various large raptors like [[golden eagles]] are reported attacking human beings,&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson, Rachel (2009). Falconer on the Edge. Houghton Mifflin-Harcourt. {{ISBN|978-0-618-80623-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but its unclear if they intend to eat them or if they have ever been successful in killing one.

Some fossil evidence indicates large [[birds of prey]] occasionally preyed on prehistoric hominids. The [[Taung Child]], an early human found in Africa, is believed to have been killed by an eagle-like bird similar to the [[crowned eagle]]. The extinct [[Haast's eagle]] may have preyed on humans in [[New Zealand]], and this conclusion would be consistent with [[Maori folklore]]. ''[[Leptoptilos robustus]]''&lt;ref&gt;Meijer and Due (2010). "A new species of giant marabou stork (Ave: Ciconiiformes) from the Pleistocene of Liang Bua, Flores (Indonesia)". Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society. 160: 707–724. doi:10.1111/j.1096-3642.2010.00616.x.&lt;/ref&gt; might have preyed on both ''[[Homo floresiensis]]'' and anatomically modern humans, and the [[Malagasy crowned eagle]], [[teratorns]], [[Woodward's eagle]] and ''[[Caracara major]]''&lt;ref&gt;"Body Mass Estimations and Paleobiological Inferences on a New Species of Large Caracara (Aves, Falconidae) from the Late Pleistocene of Uruguay". ResearchGate. doi:10.2307/23353814. Retrieved 2016-04-22.&lt;/ref&gt; are similar in size to the Haast's eagle, implying that they similarly could pose a threat to a human being.

===Sharks===
{{Main|Shark attack}}
[[File:Shark warning - Salt Rock South Africa.jpg|thumb|Sign warning bathers of the danger of shark attacks]]

Contrary to popular belief,{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} only a limited number of shark species are known to pose a serious threat to humans. The species that are most dangerous can be indiscriminate and will take any potential meal they happen to come across (as an oceanic whitetip might eat a person floating in the water after a shipwreck), or may bite out of curiosity or mistaken identity (as with a great white shark attacking a human on a surfboard possibly because it resembles its favoured prey, a seal).

Of more than 568 [[List of sharks|shark species]], only four have been involved in a significant number of fatal unprovoked attacks on humans: the [[great white shark]], [[tiger shark]], [[bull shark]],&lt;ref name="isaf"&gt;ISAF [http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/statistics/species2.htm Statistics on Attacking Species of Shark]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[oceanic whitetip shark]].&lt;ref name="howstuffdangerous4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animals.howstuffworks.com/fish/most-dangerous-shark2.htm |title=9: Oceanic Whitetip Shark - The 10 Most Dangerous Sharks &amp;#124; HowStuffWorks |publisher=Animals.howstuffworks.com |date=2008-06-05 |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sharks, being large, powerful predators, may sometimes attack and kill humans; it is worth noting that they have all been filmed in open water by unprotected divers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/2015/12/26/editorial/article-about-monsanto-was-right-thing-to-do/|title=Article about Monsanto was 'right thing to do'|first1=Posted on December|last1=26|first2=2015 1:30|last2=Am|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[1992 Cageless shark-diving expedition]] by Ron and Valerie Taylor.&lt;/ref&gt; Many other species of shark have caused relatively minor, or nonfatal injuries to humans on rare occasions.

===Piranhas===

Due to its small size, no individual [[piranha]] could ever kill a human even if it can take a painful bite of flesh. The ability of a shoal of piranhas to overwhelm and devour a [[capybara]] similar in size to human demonstrates the potential of piranhas as man-eaters.

Some controversy, however, exists over whether and to what degree piranha "attacks" represent true predation as opposed to a violent defense of spawning areas or refuges.

Attacks resulting in deaths have occurred in the Amazon basin. In 2011, a drunk 18-year-old man was attacked and killed in Rosario del Yata, [[Bolivia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://noticias.terra.com.br/mundo/noticias/0,,OI5507003-EI8140,00-Homem+bebado+morre+apos+ser+atacado+por+piranhas+na+Bolivia.html |title=Homem bêbado morre após ser atacado por piranhas na Bolívia |date=7 December 2011|work=terra.com.br}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, a five-year-old Brazilian girl was attacked and killed by a shoal of ''P. nattereri''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvuol.uol.com.br/assistir.htm?video=menina-e-atacada-por-piranhas-e-morre-no-amazonas-0402CD183464C4A13326&amp;tagIds=1793&amp;orderBy=mais-recentes&amp;edFilter=editorial&amp;time=all&amp; |date=25 October 2012 |title=Menina é atacada por piranhas e morre no Amazonas|work=tvuol.uol.com.br}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Brazilian rivers have warning signs about lethal piranhas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://g1.globo.com/mato-grosso/noticia/2011/11/banhistas-sao-atacados-por-piranhas-em-rio-no-pantanal-de-mato-grosso.html |title=Praia no Rio Paraguai tem quase um ataque de piranhas por dia em MT |author=Martins, Kelly |work=globo.com|date=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marine microorganisms''' are defined by their habitat as the [[microorganism]]s living in a [[Marine habitat|marine environment]], that is, in the [[saline water|saltwater]] of a sea or ocean or the [[brackish]] water of a coastal [[estuary]].

A [[virus]] is a small [[pathogen|infectious agent]] that [[Replicate (biology)|replicates]] only inside the living [[Cell (biology)|cells]] of other [[organism]]s. Viruses can infect all types of [[life forms]], from [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s to [[microorganism]]s, including [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]].&lt;ref name="pmid16984643"&gt;{{vcite journal

When not inside an infected cell or in the process of infecting a cell, viruses exist in the form of independent particles. These viral particles, also known as ''virions'', consist of two or three parts: (i) the [[genetic material]] made from either [[DNA]] or [[RNA]], long [[molecule]]s that carry genetic information; (ii) a [[protein]] coat, called the [[capsid]], which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases (iii) an [[viral envelope|envelope]] of [[lipid]]s that surrounds the protein coat when they are outside a cell. The shapes of these virus particles range from simple [[helix|helical]] and [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] forms for some virus species to more complex structures for others. Most virus species have virions that are too small to be seen with an [[optical microscope]]. The average virion is about one one-hundredth the size of the average [[bacterium]].

The origins of viruses in the [[evolutionary history of life]] are unclear: some may have [[evolution|evolved]] from [[plasmid]]s—pieces of DNA that can move between cells—while others may have evolved from bacteria. In evolution, viruses are an important means of [[horizontal gene transfer]], which increases [[genetic diversity]].&lt;ref name="Canchaya" /&gt; Viruses are considered by some to be a life form, because they carry genetic material, reproduce, and evolve through [[natural selection]]. However, they lack key characteristics (such as cell structure) that are generally considered necessary to count as life. Because they possess some but not all such qualities, viruses have been described as "organisms at the edge of life"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{vcite journal|author = Rybicki, EP|year = 1990|title = The classification of organisms at the edge of life, or problems with virus systematics|journal = South African Journal of Science |volume = 86|pages = 182–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as replicators.&lt;ref name="Koonin and Starokadomskyy"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Are viruses alive?

This can have consequent effects for the [[biological pump]], the process whereby [[carbon]] is [[Carbon sequestration|sequestered]] into the deep ocean.&lt;ref name="pmid17853907"/&gt; Viruses can also be a primary factor in the rapid destruction of [[algal bloom]]s&lt;ref name="pmid16163346"/&gt;; such blooms can be detrimental to other marine life.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"&gt;{{vcite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/hab/redtide/ |title=Harmful Algal Blooms: Red Tide: Home|CDC HSB |publisher=www.cdc.gov |accessdate=2014-12-19

===Marine bacteria===
[[File:Vibrio vulnificus 01.png|thumb|right|''[[Vibrio vulnificus]]'', a virulent bacterium found in [[estuaries]] and along coastal areas]]

[[Bacteria]] constitute a large [[domain (biology)|domain]] of [[prokaryotic]] [[microorganism]]s. Typically a few [[micrometre]]s in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on [[Earth]], and are present in most of its [[habitat]]s. Bacteria inhabit soil, water, [[Hot spring|acidic hot springs]], [[radioactive waste]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fredrickson JK, Zachara JM, Balkwill DL, Kennedy D, Li SM, Kostandarithes HM, Daly MJ, Romine MF, Brockman FJ | title = Geomicrobiology of high-level nuclear waste-contaminated vadose sediments at the Hanford site, Washington state | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology | volume = 70 | issue = 7 | pages = 4230–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15240306 | pmc = 444790 | doi = 10.1128/AEM.70.7.4230-4241.2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the deep portions of [[Crust (geology)|Earth's crust]]. Bacteria also live in [[symbiotic]] and [[parasitic]] relationships with plants and animals.

Once regarded as [[plant]]s constituting the class ''Schizomycetes'', bacteria are now classified as [[prokaryotes]]. Unlike cells of animals and other [[eukaryote]]s, bacterial cells do not contain a [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] and rarely harbour [[cell membrane|membrane-bound]] [[organelle]]s. Although the term ''bacteria'' traditionally included all prokaryotes, the [[scientific classification]] changed after the discovery in the 1990s that prokaryotes consist of two very different groups of organisms that [[evolution|evolved]] from an ancient common ancestor. These [[domain (biology)|evolutionary domains]] are called ''Bacteria'' and ''[[Archaea]]''.&lt;ref name="Woese"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Woese CR, Kandler O, Wheelis ML | title = Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 87 | issue = 12 | pages = 4576–9 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2112744 | pmc = 54159 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576 | bibcode = 1990PNAS...87.4576W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancestors of modern bacteria were unicellular microorganisms that were the [[Abiogenesis|first forms of life]] to appear on Earth, about 4 billion years ago.

The [[archaea]] (Greek for ''ancient'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=a&amp;p=41 Archaea] ''Online Etymology Dictionary''. Retrieved 17 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;) constitute a [[Domain (biology)|domain]] and [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] of [[Unicellular organism|single-celled]] [[microorganism]]s. These microbes are [[prokaryotes]], meaning they have no [[cell nucleus]] or any other membrane-bound [[organelle]]s in their cells.

Archaea were initially classified as [[bacteria]], but this classification is outdated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pace NR |title=Time for a change |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue=7091 |page=289 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16710401 |doi=10.1038/441289a|bibcode = 2006Natur.441..289P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeal cells have unique properties separating them from the other two domains of life, [[Bacteria]] and [[Eukaryota]]. The Archaea are further divided into multiple recognized [[phylum|phyla]]. Classification is difficult because the majority have not been isolated in the laboratory and have only been detected by analysis of their [[nucleic acid]]s in samples from their environment.

Archaea and bacteria are generally similar in size and shape, although a few archaea have very strange shapes, such as the flat and square-shaped cells of ''[[Haloquadratum|Haloquadratum walsbyi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stoeckenius W |title=Walsby's square bacterium: fine structure of an orthogonal procaryote |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=148 |issue=1 |pages=352–60 |date=1 October 1981|pmid=7287626 |url=http://jb.asm.org/content/148/1/352.long |pmc=216199 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this morphological similarity to bacteria, archaea possess [[gene]]s and several [[metabolic pathway]]s that are more closely related to those of eukaryotes, notably the [[enzyme]]s involved in [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[translation (biology)|translation]]. Other aspects of archaeal biochemistry are unique, such as their reliance on [[ether lipid]]s in their [[cell membrane]]s, such as [[archaeol]]s. Archaea use more energy sources than eukaryotes: these range from [[organic compounds]], such as sugars, to [[ammonia]], [[ion|metal ions]] or even [[hydrogen|hydrogen gas]]. Salt-tolerant archaea (the [[Haloarchaea]]) use sunlight as an energy source, and other species of archaea [[carbon fixation|fix carbon]]; however, unlike plants and [[cyanobacteria]], no known species of archaea does both. Archaea [[asexual reproduction|reproduce asexually]] by [[binary fission]], [[Fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmentation]], or [[budding]]; unlike bacteria and eukaryotes, no known species forms [[spore]]s. Unlike viruses and bacteria, no known archaea is a pathogen.

Archaea are particularly numerous in the oceans, and the archaea in [[plankton]] may be one of the most abundant groups of organisms on the planet. Archaea are a major part of Earth's life and may play roles in both the [[carbon cycle]] and the [[nitrogen cycle]].

Marine fungi can be classified as:&lt;ref name="Sridhar2009" /&gt;
* Lower fungi - adapted to marine habitats ([[Zoospore|zoosporic]] fungi, including mastigomycetes: [[oomycete]]s and [[chytridiomycetes]])
* Higher fungi - filamentous, modified to planktonic lifestyle ([[hyphomycetes]], [[Ascomycota|ascomycetes]], [[Basidiomycota|basidiomycetes]])

Most mycoplankton species are higher fungi.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Lichen]]s are [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] associations between a fungus, usually an ascomycete, and an alga or a [[Cyanobacteria|cyanobacterium]]. Several lichens are found in marine environments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocean.otr.usm.edu/~w529014/index_files/Page2025.htm Species of Higher Marine Fungi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130422084649/http://ocean.otr.usm.edu/~w529014/index_files/Page2025.htm |date=22 April 2013 }} University of Mississippi.

===Marine microanimals===
{{see also|Microanimal|Ichthyoplankton}}

At least one microscopic animal group, the [[parasite|parasitic]] [[cnidaria]]n [[Myxozoa]], is unicellular in its adult form, and includes marine species. Other marine [[microanimal]]s are multicellular. Microscopic [[arthropod]]s are more commonly found inland in freshwater, but there are marine species as well. Microscopic marine [[crustacean]]s include some [[copepod]]s, [[cladocera]] and [[tardigrade|water bears]]. Some marine [[nematode]]s and [[rotifer]]s are also too small to be seen with the naked eye, as are many [[loricifera]], including the recently discovered [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] species that spend their lives in an [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Janet Fang |date=6 April 2010 |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100406/full/464825b.html |title=Animals thrive without oxygen at sea bottom |journal=Nature |volume=464 |doi=10.1038/464825b |pmid=20376121 |pages=825 |issue=7290}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/58154/description/Multicelled_animals_may_live_oxygen-free|title=Briny deep basin may be home to animals thriving without oxygen|work=Science News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copepods contribute more to the [[secondary productivity]] and [[carbon sink]] of the world oceans than any other group of organisms.

&lt;!--Please only include examples of miraculous births in faith-based, legendary, or mythological traditions. Do NOT include births of non-spiritual figures.--&gt;

Stories of '''miraculous births''' often include conceptions by [[miracle|miraculous]] circumstances and features such as intervention by a [[deity]], [[supernatural]] elements, [[Astronomy|astronomical]] signs, hardship or, in the case of some mythologies, complex plots related to creation.

==Near Eastern mythology==
The [[Assyria]]n and [[Babylonia]]n concept of origins expressed procreation first in “relationships between gods and goddesses resulting in other gods and goddesses," such as [[Ea (Babylonian god)|Ea]] and [[Damkina]] assisted by [[Apsu]] giving birth to [[Marduk]]. The [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''[[Enûma Eliš]]'' describes the birth of Marduk as follows: "Ea, having overheard the plan of the primordial deities to destroy the other gods, deceived [[Apsu]] and [[Mummu]] and put them to death. 'Ea, his triumph over his enemies secured, in his sacred chamber in profound peace he rested.' (ANET, p.&amp;nbsp;61, lines 74—75.)  Then he took over the place which Apsu had used for his cult and dwelt there with his spouse, Damkina." It was here that Marduk, the "most potent and wisest of gods" was created in the heart of Apsu and "He who begot him was Ea, his father, she who conceived him was Damkina, his mother".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/mesopotamian/enuma.html |title=Enuma Elish, The Sumerian Epic of Creation |publisher=Ancienttexts.org |date=2001-06-07 |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Norman Lockyer]], Ea, Ia, or [[Oannes (mythology)|Oannes]] was the primal god of Babylon. He was a ‘Great God, Maker of Men, Potter, Artist and Workman.’  He formed a Triad with [[Anu]] and [[Bil]]—the two poles of heaven and the equator.&lt;ref name="Lockyer, Norman, Sir"&gt;Lockyer, Norman, The dawn of astronomy : a study of temple worship and mythology of the ancient Egyptians. With a preface by Giorgio de Santillana, Mineola, NY. : Dover Publications, Inc., 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Oannes first appeared from the sea to teach the Babylonians the art of writing, sciences and crafts, the building of cities, the surveying of land, the observation of the stars, and the sowing and harvesting of all kinds of grains and plants.  He was believed to have been "reincarnated" several times.  [[Berossos]], priest of the Temple of [[Bel (god)|Bel]], in Babylon, knew of as many as six such reincarnations.&lt;ref name="Eisler, Robert"&gt;Orpheus the fisher; comparative studies in Orphic and early Christian cult symbolism, J. M. Watkins, London, 1921&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, “procreative deities, either male or female, played a part in the birth of other deities or great personages, such as the [[Ugaritic]] tradition of Lady [[Asherah]], ‘the Progenitress of the gods’; [[Mami (goddess)|Mami]], 'the Mother-womb, the one who creates mankind'; Father [[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]], the 'begetter of gods and men'; the Assyrian traditions that Tukulti-Urta was created by the gods in the womb of his mother and that [[Sennacherib]]'s birth was assisted by Ea, who provided a 'spacious womb', and [[Assur]], 'the god, my begetter'; and the North Arabian myth of the mother goddess who was responsible for [[Dusares]]."&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"&gt;Boslooper, Thomas, The Virgin Birth, The Westminster Press, Library of Congress Catalog Card No. 62-7941.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hittite mythology]], the god [[Anu]] was overthrown by his son [[Kumarbi]];&lt;ref name=Puhvel1987&gt;{{cite book|last=Puhvel|first=Jaan|authorlink=Jaan Puhvel|title=Comparative Mythology|date=1987|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Maryland|isbn=0-8018-3938-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleman|first1=J.

{{Further|Myth of Osiris and Isis|Horus}}
[[File:Abydos Tempelrelief Sethos I. 36.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Isis, in the form of a bird, copulates with the deceased Osiris. At either side are Horus, although he is as yet unborn, and Isis in human form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1-last=Meeks|author1-first=Dimitri|author2-last=Favard-Meeks|author2-first=Christine|others=Translated by G.

&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The belief in the conception of [[Horus]] by [[Isis]] is traced to the beginning of Egyptian history.  Horus' conception and birth were understood in terms of the Egyptian doctrine of [[parthenogenesis]], which was connected with the goddess Neith of Sais. (page 220)&lt;ref name="Budge, E. A. Wallis"&gt;[[Budge, E. A. Wallis]], ''The Gods of the Egyptians'', II, Dover Publications, New York, 1904&lt;/ref&gt;  In Upper Egypt, Net was worshipped at Seni and represented with the head of a lioness painted green, with the titles: "Father of fathers and Mother of mothers," and "net-Menhit, the great lady, lady of the south, the great cow who gave birth to the sun, who made the germ of gods and men, the mother of [[Ra]], who raised up [[Atum|Tem]] in primeval time, who existed when nothing else had being, and who created that which exists after she had come into being."(page 150)&lt;ref name="Erman, Adolf"&gt;Erman, Adolf, The Literature of the Ancient Egyptians, B. Blom, New York, 1971, 1927&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Many of the attributes of Isis, the God-mother, the mother of Horus; and of [[Neith]], the goddess of [[Sais]] are identical with those of Mary the Mother of Christ." (page 161)&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt;  Early Christian stories in the [[Apocrypha]]l Gospels, which record the wanderings of the Virgin and Child in Egypt are similar to stories found on the [[Metternich Stela]] texts about the life of Isis. (page 161)&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt; Also, the pictures and sculptures of Isis suckling her child Horus are the foundation for Christian figurines and paintings of the Madonna and Child.  Of course, the legend of the birth of Horus has many elements not found even in the Apocryphal Gospels.  Egyptian texts mention numerous forms of Horus.  In one he is "Heru-sa Ast, sa-Asar, or Horus, son of Isis, son of [[Osiris]]."  Isis is described in the Hymn to Osiris, as finding and restoring the body of her dead husband, and using magical words given her by [[Thoth]] to restore him to life.  Then, by uniting with Osiris she conceives Horus.  Horus represented the rising sun and in this respect was comparable to the Greek [[Apollo]].&lt;ref name="hammerwood.mistral.com.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hammerwood.mistral.co.uk/apollo.htm |title=Apollo. Hammerwood. Parthenon. Borghese Vase Plaques. Dionysus. Python. Egyptian Horus. Isis. Ra. Amon. Set. Helios. Delphi. Prophecy. Know Thyself. Delphic Oracle. National Curriculum: Ancient Greece, Greeks |publisher=Hammerwood.mistral.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There were at least fifteen other Horuses in the Egyptian pantheon,&lt;ref name="egyptianmyths.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptianmyths.net/horus.htm |title=Ancient Egypt: the Mythology - Horus |publisher=Egyptianmyths.net |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; so in the story of Isis and Osiris Horus is "sometimes known as Harsiesis, to distinguish him from the others.  He is depicted as a falcon, or with a falcon's head.  He eventually avenged Osiris' death and reclaimed the throne, ruling peacefully...Herakhty, or 'Horus of the Horizon', was a sun god who rose each morning on the eastern horizon.  He was often identified with the sun god, Ra, and was eventually absorbed by him, forming Ra-Herakhty."&lt;ref name="egyptianmyths.net"/&gt;

Lineal descent from Ra, whether by birth or by marriage, was claimed by all kings of Egypt at least since User-ka-f, first king of the V Dynasty, who was high priest of Ra at [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]].  An important part of this tradition was the legend of the God Re generating with the wife of a priest.  "The newborn child was regarded as a god incarnate, and later with appropriate ceremonies he was presented to [[Ra|Re]] or Amen-Re, in his temple, where the god accepted it and acknowledged it to be his child."  This tradition was later inscribed in a stereotyped form in temple reliefs.&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt;

Many texts mention different attributes of Isis.  These were combined into a single narrative by [[Plutarch]] in the 1st century AD. In her aspect of protector of Egypt and its people, Isis is depicted with huge outspread wings.  She taught women to grind corn, to spin and to weave, and she taught the people how to cure illnesses. She instituted the rite of marriage.  When her consort, Osiris, left Egypt to travel the world, Isis ruled the country in his absence.  "The [[hieroglyph]] for her name is the image of a throne, and her lap came to be seen as the throne of Egypt.  Because of her fame Isis eventually absorbed the qualities of almost all the other goddesses; "she was a great mother goddess, a bird goddess, a goddess of the underworld who brought life to the dead, and a goddess of the primeval waters...Her following spread beyond Egypt to Greece and throughout the Roman Empire...(lasting) from before 3000 BC until well into Christian times.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.roman-empire.net/religion/isis.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unrv.com/culture/isis.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharaohs===
{{Further|Stories of divine birth in the eighteenth dynasty}}
There is a myth on the birth of [[Hatshepsut]]. In this myth, [[Amun]] goes to [[Queen Ahmose]] in the form of the Pharaoh [[Thutmose I]] and awakens her with pleasant odors. At this point Amun places the ''[[ankh]]'', a symbol of life, to Ahmose's nose, and Hatshepsut is conceived by Ahmose.&lt;ref&gt;Gay Robins, ''Women in Ancient Egypt'', Harvard University Press, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Another myth on divine birth concerns [[Amenhotep III]]: he is conceived by [[Amun]] which has gone to queen [[Mutemwiya]] in form of [[Thutmosis IV]].&lt;ref&gt;O' Connor, David and Cline, Eric H.: ''Amenhotep III:Perspectives of his reign'', University of Michigan Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tyldesley, Joyce: ''Chronicle of the Queens of Egypt'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
In the Hebrew Bible, and in later Jewish tradition there are stories of matriarchs giving birth where the God of Israel miraculously intervenes. For example, within the Rabbinic literature expansions were made on the birth of the matriarch [[Sarah]] on the earlier Old Testament traditions.

===Isaac===
{{Main|Isaac|Sarah}}
[[File:Abraham renvoyant Agar.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Banishment of Hagar'', Etching. À Paris chez Fr. Fanet, Éditeur, Rue des Saints Pères n° 10. 18th century. Sarah is seen on the left side, looking]]
Due to her old age, Sarai was infertile, but a miracle was vouchsafed to her ([[Genesis Rabbah]] xlvii. 3) after her name was changed from "Sarai" to "Sarah" (R. H. 16b). When her youth had been restored and she had given birth to [[Isaac]] the people would not believe in the miracle, saying that the patriarch and his wife had adopted a foundling and pretended that it was their own son. Abraham thereupon invited all the notables to a banquet on the day when Isaac was to be weaned. Sarah invited the women, who brought their infants with them, and on this occasion she gave milk from her breasts to all the children, thus convincing the guests of the miracle (B. M. 87a; comp. Gen. R. liii. 13).

===Immanuel===
According to [[Isaiah 7:14]], around 735 BC King [[Ahaz]] of Judah received a message from the prophet [[Isaiah]] during the [[Syro-Ephraimite War]] with Aram (Syria) and Israel, "Therefore, the Lord, of His own, shall give you a sign; behold, the young woman is with child, and she shall bear a son, and she shall call his name Immanuel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15938/showrashi/true |title=Yeshayahu - Chapter 7 - Texts &amp; Writings |publisher=Chabad.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is generally taken by Judaic commentators to be a reference to the non-miraculous birth of [[Hezekiah]] or another contemporary child, as indicated in Isaiah's following indication of the timing.

The Greek [[Septuagint]] and some later Christian translations, following the application of Isaiah 7 in Matthew 1, use the word "virgin". The Hebrew word ''alma'' actually translates as a young woman of childbearing age who had not yet given birth and who might or might not be a virgin, whereas the Hebrew ''betulah'', used elsewhere in Isaiah, is the word that means "virgin." If the reference is to Ahaz's betrothed, [[Abijah (queen)|Abi]], daughter of the [[High Priest]], no miraculous birth is implied, merely chastity. The Christian world believes that the verse is a messianic prediction of the miraculous birth of Jesus, as described in various gospels of the New Testament of the Bible.

===Melchizedek===
The [[Second Book of Enoch]] contains a section, called ''Exaltation of Melchizedek'', which says that [[Melchizedek]] was born of a virgin, Sofonim (or Sopanima), the wife of Nir, a brother of [[Noah]]. The child came out from his mother after she had died and sat on the bed beside her corpse, already physically developed, clothed, speaking and blessing the Lord, and marked with the badge of priesthood. Forty days later, Melchizedek was taken by the archangel [[Gabriel]] ([[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] in some manuscripts) to the [[Garden of Eden]] and was thus preserved from the [[Deluge myth|Deluge]] without having to be in [[Noah's Ark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ueberallesdownload.com/enoch7.html |title=THE SECOND BOOK OF ENOCH - Page 7 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2010-01-29 |accessdate=2015-02-24 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129084437/http://www.ueberallesdownload.com/enoch7.html |archivedate=January 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Book of the Secrets of Enoch| author= Morfill, W R (translator)| url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/3678772/The-Book-of-the-Secrets-of-Enoch-WR-Morfill  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zoroaster==
{{Further|Zoroastrianism|Zoroaster}}
Zoroaster’s name has been adopted from the Greek and [[Latin]] Zoroastres.  The ancient form of his name in the Avesta is [[Zarathustra]].  His native country was probably [[Median Empire|Media]] in Western Iran, (possibly in modern [[Azerbaijan]]), but his ministry took place in eastern Iran, especially in the region of [[Bactria]], about 1200 BC. [[Zoroaster]] was originally a Magian priest, and under the reforms he instituted, Mithra became one of the [[Yazata]]s (Worshipful Ones), the angels or lesser divine beings.

"It was said that (Zoroaster's) birth was foretold from the beginning of time, and that the moment he was born, he burst out laughing and the whole universe rejoiced with him."  After his birth evil demons tried to destroy him, but with Ahura Mazda's protection, he survived all attempts on his life.&lt;ref name="Storm, Rachel"/&gt;  The Zoroastrian tradition differs from the Christian one because the divine only assists in the preservation of [[Zoroaster]]’s seed.  "The central scripture, the [[Avesta]] and also the Pahlavi texts include the tradition that the 'kingly glory' is handed onward from ruler to ruler and from saint to saint for the purpose of illuminating ultimately the soul of the Zarathushtra."  Also the scriptures clearly allude to conjugal relations between his parents, during which evil spirits try to prevent his conception.&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt;  But according to later tradition, Zoroaster's mother, Dughdova, was a virgin when she conceived Zoroaster by a shaft of light.&lt;ref name="Storm, Rachel"&gt;Egyptian mythology, Lorenz, London, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greco-Roman and Hellenistic mythology==
===Gods===
[[File:René-Antoine Houasse - Minerva.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''The Birth of [[Minerva]]'' by [[René-Antoine Houasse]] (before 1688)]]

[[Greco-Roman]] and [[Hellenistic]] literature is rich in the tradition of birth among the gods. In his poem ''[[Theogony]]'', the Greek poet [[Hesiod]] tells a story that Zeus had once lain with the goddess [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], impregnating her, but, fearing that she might bear a child mightier than he himself, he swallowed her.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' 886&lt;/ref&gt; Their daughter [[Athena]] was born fully grown from Zeus's forehead, fully armed and clad in armor.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' 929a&lt;/ref&gt; Hesiod also relates that the goddess [[Aphrodite]] was born from the foam of the sea after [[Ouranos]]'s castrated testicles were thrown into it.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' 176&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Helios]] was a child of Zeus by [[Euryphaessa]].  He was also called "the son of Earth and starry Heaven," and the son of [[Hyperion (mythology)|Hyperion]]. [[Dionysus]] was dithyrambus, "he who entered life by a double door." His first birth took place prematurely. His mother, Semele, died when Zeus appeared to her in a flash of lightning, and so Zeus opened his own flesh and enclosed the infant.  In time, Dionysus was born "perfect" from Zeus' thigh.  Dionysus [[Zagreus]] was important in Orphic theology. In Protrepticus ii. 14 ff. by Clement of Alexandria, this child had the form of a bull.  Zeus intended to make him the ruler of the universe but the jealous Titans lured the child away, tore him to pieces, cooked him and ate him.  Athena preserved his heart, however, which Zeus swallowed.  According to Boslooper, Clement omitted one part of the myth that forms a connection between his account and the Theban legend of Dionysus.  Because Zeus swallowed the heart of Dionysus Zagreus, when Semele bore Dionysus the new god was Zagreus reborn.&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt;

===Mithra and Mithras===
{{Main|Mithras|Mithra|Mitra}}
[[File:MithrasIMG 5339.JPG|thumb|right|325px|Roman statue showing Mithras born from the rock from the Diocletian Baths Museum]]

In Indian mythology, [[Mithra]] is known as Mitra.  He was originally a god of contracts and friendship and was a forerunner of the Graeco-Roman god [[Mithras]].  In [[Iran]], he developed into the protector of truth.  Before the time of Zoroaster, he was associated with [[Ahura Mazda]], the principle of good. As a consequence of Zoroaster's reforms to Iranian religion, Mithra was ousted from power and Ahura Mazda became supreme.&lt;ref name="Storm, Rachel"/&gt;  In the more ancient Indian [[Vedas]] Mithra was the god of light, invoked under the name of [[Varuna]], and was called "the Light of the World." He was the mediator between heaven and Earth.

"The light bursting from the heavens, which were conceived as a solid vault, became, in the mythology of the [[Magi]], Mithra born from the rock."&lt;ref name="Boerie, C. George, Dr."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/romanempire.html |title=The Roman Empire |publisher=Webspace.ship.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mithraism absorbed [[astrology]] from the [[Babylon|Chaldeans]] after the Chaldean conquest, and continued as an astronomical religion.  In the Hellenistic period it took on its final form.  Mithra was assimilated into [[Graeco-Roman]] beliefs in the 1st century BC as Mithras.  He was an ancient and highly honored god of [[Roman mythology|Roman]] Paganism, where he was worshipped for more than 300 years as "the soldier's god."&lt;ref name="Newadvent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10402a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Mithraism |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1911-10-01 |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mythological heroes===
[[File:Danae gold shower Louvre CA925.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Ancient [[Boeotia]]n [[bell-krater]] showing Zeus impregnating [[Danaë]] in the form of a shower of gold, circa 450-425 BC]]

The love of a god for a mortal, resulting in the birth of a hero, is one notable deviation from the tradition of the origin of gods. The legend of [[Perseus]], whose mother conceived him when [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] came to her in the form of a golden shower, is one example of this type (cf. Ovid, Metamorphoses, Book IV).  The ''[[Greek Anthology]]'' has the following: [[Zeus]], turned to gold, piercing the brazen chamber of Danae, cut the knot of intact virginity.

Heroes created by generation of a god with a mortal include [[Ion (play)|Ion]] by Apollo and [[Creusa]], [[Romulus]] by Mars and Aemila, [[Asclepius]] by Apollo and [[Coronis (Greek mythology)|Coronis]], and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] by Zeus and [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]].   [[Plutarch]] records how Theseus and [[Romulus]] were both born out of wedlock and of uncertain parentage and at the same time had the reputation of being sprung from the gods.  He said that Theseus' grandfather [[Pittheus]] invented the story that Theseus was the child of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] to conceal Theseus' lineage as the son of Pittheus' daughter [[Aethra (Greek mythology)|Aethra]] and [[Aegeus]] ("Lives", Vol. 1, p.&amp;nbsp;2; pp.&amp;nbsp;3 ff.).  But there were other stories about the birth of Romulus and his brother Remus.  The story of Romulus' divine origin says that his mother was the mortal daughter of Aeneas and Lavinia, and his father was Mars.

In his "Hymn to Asclepius", [[Homer]] attributes his origin to the god Apollo and the daughter of a renowned soldier, King Phlegyas.  As the divine patron of the healing art, [[Asclepius]] became the most popular of the hero gods of Greece.  The belief that religion was concerned with sickness and disease was central to his cult.  His sanctuaries in the Greco-Roman world became so famous there was a movement to make him a god of the first rank and identify him with Zeus himself.  Asclepius was "the one who leads and controls all things, the savior of the whole world, and the guardian of mortals."

Helen of Troy was worshiped as a heroine in several parts of the ancient world during the early historical epoch.  [[Euripides]]' play "Helen" depends on a tradition begun in the early 6th century B.C. by the Greek poet Stesichorus that Helen was the daughter of Zeus (who took the form of a swan) and Leda.  But this might simply be a poetic way of saying that she was hatched from an egg.

There are two versions of the birth of [[Oedipus]].  He was given a semidivine status in [[Sophocles]]' "Oedipus the King," where he was said to be the son of either [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], Loxias, "or the Bacchants' god, dweller on the hilltops ..." and one of the nymphs of Helicon.  But in Euripides' "Phoenissae," his mother, Jocasta, says Oedupus is the son of Laius, a mortal, who was warned by the god Phoebus not to have children.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"King of Thebes for horses famed! seek not to beget children against the will of heaven; for if thou beget a son, that child will slay thee, and all thy house shall wade in blood."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Laius ignored the warning, but after the child was born he gave him to shepherds to expose on Mount Cithaeron.  The child was found and raised among the keepers of the horses of Polybus.  As a grown man, Oedipus did indeed kill his father, not realizing who he was, and then married his mother.  When he discovered the truth he blinded himself.  In this story, he is clearly considered to be the son of Laius and Jocasta.  This is also obvious in Sophocles' "Oedipus the King".&lt;ref name="Eds. Oates and O'Neill"&gt;The Complete Greek Drama, Eds. Oates and O'Neill, Vol. 1, p. 409, Random House, New York, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Boslooper, "The two passages indicate that in the Greek mind the thoughts of divine and human paternal participation in conception were not mutually exclusive."&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;178)

[[File:Mignard - The Shepherd Faustulus Bringing Romulus and Remus to His Wife.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''The Shepherd Faustulus Bringing Romulus and Remus to His Wife'' by [[Nicolas Mignard]] (1654)]]

[[Romulus and Remus]], the legendary twin founders of the city of [[Rome]], were said to have been born to a [[Vestal Virgin]], [[Rhea Silvia]].  Rhea Silvia had been forced to become a Vestal Virgin against her will and claimed to have been impregnated through divine intervention.  [[Livy]] attests that she was instead raped by an unknown man.  In any case [[Amulius|King Amulius]] ordered the twins to be drowned as death through the elements would not trigger divine punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Romulus_and_Remus/|title=Romulus and Remus|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical figures===
Alexander, the Ptolemies, and the Caesars were said by some scholars to have been "virgin-born."  [[Alexander the Great]], " journeyed to the Oasis of Amon in order that he might be recognized as the god’s son and thus become a legitimate and recognized king of Egypt.  Inscriptions show that he and the [[Ptolemies]] after him had the incidents of their birth regularly depicted in temple reliefs.”&lt;ref name="Breasted"&gt;Breasted, Ancient Records of Egypt, Vol. 2, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; (As cited by Boslooper)  Norden calls this the Hellenistic virgin motif.  However, evidence shows that Alexander must have had a double tradition of origin.  It is recorded that "Alexander the Great and Augustus are deemed to have been conceived of a serpent god, and they claimed between them [[Phoebus]] and [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] as their progenitors."&lt;ref name="Sidonius Apollinaris"&gt;Sidonius Apollinaris, Carmina II, 121, Testimonies 289 in Asclepius, E. J. and Ludwig Edelstein (1945)&lt;/ref&gt;

“The Emperor [[Augustus]] was praised as the Savior of the world …[but] the idea of Savior was not unique or original with Augustus himself.  Before him the same title was given to [[Seleucid]] and other Hellenistic kings.  Throughout this period there were frequent longings for a savior from the present troubles.”  Augustus was said to have had a miraculous birth and a childhood filled with many portents and signs.  A few months before he was born a portent was observed at Rome which gave warning that nature was pregnant with a king for the Roman People.  "Thereupon the Senate in consternation decreed that no male child born that year should be reared; but those whose wives were with child saw to it that the decree was not filed in the treasury, since each one appropriated the prediction to his own family."  Boslooper relates several additional stories.  In one, Suetonius narrates what he learned from Asclepias of Mendes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When Atia had come in the middle of the night to the solemn service of Apollo, she had her litter set down in the temple and fell asleep, while the rest of the matrons also slept.  On a sudden a serpent glided up to her and shortly went away.  When she awoke, she purified herself, as if after the embraces of her husband, and at once there appeared on her body a mark in colors like a serpent, and she could never get rid of it; so that presently she ceased ever to go to the public baths.  In the tenth month after that Augustus was born and was therefore regarded as the son of Apollo.  Atia too, before she gave him birth, dreamed that her vitals were borne up to the stars and spread over the whole extent of land and sea, while Octavius dreamed that the sun rose from Atia's womb."&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt; (p. 180)&lt;/blockquote&gt;The hope for a savior was expressed in [[Virgil]]’s “Fourth Eclogue".  The Church fathers later claimed this was a reference to Jesus Christ, however, the poem was dedicated to Pollio, one of the great influential men at the time of the civil wars and Virgil's patron and friend.  The hero of the poem is a child born or to be born in 40 B.C., at the time of Pollio's consulate.  A new era was expected, in fulfillment of an older oracle.&lt;blockquote&gt;"... Now the last age by Cumae's Sibyl sung

Has come and gone, and the majestic roll

Of circling centuries begins anew:

Justice returns, returns old Saturn's reign,

With a new breed of men sent down from heaven.

Only do thou, at the boy's birth in whom

The iron shall cease, the golden race arise,

Befriend him, chaste Lucina; 'tis thine own

Apollo reigns ...

"For thee, O boy,

First shall the earth, untilled, pour freely forth

Her childish gifts, the gadding ivy-spray

With foxglove and Egyptian bean-flower mixed,

And laughing-eyed acanthus. Of themselves,

Untended, will the she-goats then bring home

Their udders swollen with milk, while flocks afield

Shall of the monstrous lion have no fear..."&lt;ref name="classics.mit.edu"&gt;

==Hinduism==
{{Main|Hinduism}}
In the story of [[Krishna]] the deity is the agent of conception and also the offspring.  Because of his sympathy for the earth, the divine [[Vishnu]] himself descended into the womb of [[Devaki]] and was born as her son, Krishna. The Hindu Vishnu Purana relates: "Devaki bore in her womb the lotus-eyed deity...before the birth of Krishna, no one “could bear to gaze upon Devaki, from the light that invested her, and those who contemplated her radiance felt their minds disturbed.” This reference to light is reminiscent of the Vedic hymn "To an Unknown God," which refers to a Golden Child.  According to F. M. Müller this term means "the golden germ of child" and is an attempt at naming the sun.&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt;

This is  occasionally brought up as evidence for the hypothesis that "virgin birth" tales are a fairly common phenomenon in non-Christian religions around the world.&lt;ref name="Hitchens, Christopher"&gt;Christopher Hitchens, God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything (Paperback), 2007, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen, Chapman"&gt;Chapman Cohen, Essays in Freethinking, 1927, "Monism and Religion"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joseph, Peter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vimeo.com/13726978 |title=Private Video on Vimeo |publisher=Vimeo.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is nothing in Hindu scriptures to suggest that it was a "virgin" birth. By the time of conception and birth of Krishna, Devaki was married to [[Vasudeva]] and had already borne seven children.&lt;ref name="Vishnu Puran"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Vishnupurana-English-MnDutt#page/n307/mode/2up/search/devaki |title=VishnuPurana - English - MN Dutt |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some Hindus believe that when the emanations of the Supreme Being are [[pratyaksha]], or obvious to the sight, they become sacara, or embodied. Krishna was such an embodiment and usually bore a human form. In that mode of appearance the deities are generally supposed to be born of a woman, but without any carnal intercourse. This belief is not adhered to by those who follow the Purva Mimansa, or the philosophy of Jaimini. They insist that the Devas were mere mortals whom the Supreme Being endowed with qualities similar to his own. In general, the Hindus perform acts of worship to some of their ancient monarchs and sages, who were deified on account of their eminent virtues.&lt;ref name="On Egypt and the Nile"&gt;Wilford, On Egypt and the Nile, Asiatic Researches, Vol. III p. 374&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
{{Main|Buddha#Conception and birth}}
[[File:Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita Queen Maya Birth.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Maya (mother of the Buddha)|Māyā]] miraculously giving birth to Siddhārtha. [[Sanskrit]], [[palm-leaf manuscript]]. [[Nalanda|Nālandā]], [[Bihar]], India. [[Pala Empire|Pāla period]]]]

The stories of Buddha’s unusual birth developed through the centuries. Two accounts cited by Boslooper tell of the descent of the future Bodhisattva from the "Tusita Body" into the mother’s womb, the appearance of the [[Buddha]] in the mother as a shining gem, and the accompanying wonders in the natural world.  These are the Majjhima-Nikāya, 123 Acchariyabbhutadhammasuta III. 119-124; (I. B. Horner, 1959, pp.&amp;nbsp;164–169); and Māhapadānasutta, Dīgha ii. 12.&lt;ref name="Davids, T. W. rhys"&gt;Davids, T. W. Rhys, Dialogues of the Buddha, Part II, Sacred Books of the Buddhists, Vol. III (1910), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Mahapadana-sutra, Digha ii. 12, is the description of the incarnation of the [[Vipassī Buddha]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Now Vipassi, brethren, when, as Bodhisat, he ceased to belong to the hosts of the heaven of Delight, descended into his mother’s womb mindful and self-possessed."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to this text, the [[Vipassī Buddha]] was the first of six incarnations to precede [[Gautama Buddha|Gautama]]. The others listed are [[Sikhī Buddha|Sikhī]], [[Vessabhū Buddha|Vessabhū]], [[Kakusandha Buddha|Kakusandha]], [[Koṇāgamana Buddha|Koṇāgamana]], and [[Kassapa Buddha|Kassapa]]. The most popular legendary account of the birth of Buddha is in the Nidanakatha Jataka (see, [[Jataka tales]]) which accounted for the lives of Buddha in previous incarnations.  In this account, the “Great Being” chose the time and place of his birth, the tribe into which he would be born, and who his mother would be.  In the time chosen by him, Maya, his mother, fell asleep and dreamed that four archangels carried her to the [[Himalayan Mountains]] where their queens bathed and dressed her.  In her dream the Great Being soon entered her womb from her side, in the form of a white elephant. When she woke, she told her dream to the Raja, who summoned sixty-four eminent [[Brahman]]s to interpret it.

"Then is described how at his birth he took seven great steps and at the seventh he shouted, 'I am the chief of the world,' how he at birth held in his hand some medicine that became for him the drug by which he later healed the sick and blind and deaf, how at birth he wished to give a gift but was presented one himself by his mother, and how lastly he sang the song of victory.'

The [[Yellow Emperor]] is sometimes said to have been the fruit of extraordinary birth, as his mother Fubao conceived him as she was aroused, while walking in the country, by a lightning bolt from the [[Big Dipper]].&lt;ref&gt;Yves Bonnefoy, ''Asian Mythologies''. University of Chicago Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0226064565}}. p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

Qi, the Abandoned One, who later became known as [[Houji]] {{ndash}} a [[culture hero]] or [[god of agriculture]] {{ndash}} was held in some accounts to have been miraculously conceived when his mother, the consort [[Jiang Yuan]], stepped into a footprint left by the supreme god [[Shangdi]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. "Hou Ji".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laozi===
Some [[Taoism|Taoist]] schools held that [[Laozi]] was conceived when his mother gazed upon a falling star. He was born while his mother was leaning against a [[plum tree]]. Laozi was said to have emerged as an old man with a full grey beard. This may be because his name {{ndash}} "Old Master" ({{lang|zh|老子}}) {{ndash}} can also be read as "Old Child".&lt;ref&gt;Morgan Diane, ''The Best Guide to Eastern Philosophy and Religion'', New York, St. Martin's Griffin, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abaoji===
There are some legends about the birth of [[Abaoji]] (also known as Yi), the Emperor Taizu of Liao. According to the legends, his mother dreamed that the sun fell from the sky and into her bosom, from which pregnancy followed.  When she gave birth, the room is said to have become filled with a mysterious light and extraordinary fragrance.  As a newborn, his body was that of a three-year-old, and the legends go on to say that he was walking at the age of three months.&lt;ref&gt;Mote, F.W.

==Christianity==
Mainstream scholars agree that the [[nativity of Jesus]], if not taken as [[Historical Jesus|historically accurate]], should be interpreted within the context of first-century Judaism, not in the context of foreign mythologies, which contain only remote similarities.&lt;ref&gt;[[James D.G.

===Mary===

According to tradition of the Catholic church, the Virgin Mary's parents, [[St. Anne]] and [[St. Joachim]], were childless, when an angel came to them and [[Joachim and Anne Meeting at the Golden Gate|told them]] they would give birth to a daughter. During the [[Immaculate Conception|conception of Mary]], she was preserved from the stain of [[original sin]].

===Jesus===
{{Main|Nativity of Jesus|Virgin birth of Jesus}}
[[File:Iconnativity.jpg|thumb|right|[[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian]] [[icon]] of the Nativity.]]
The [[Gospel of Luke]] and the [[Gospel of Matthew]] describe the nativity of [[Jesus]]. In the account in the Gospel of Luke, [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] learns from the [[angel]] [[Gabriel]] that she will conceive and bear a child. When she asks how this can be, since she is a virgin, he tells her that the [[Holy Spirit]] would "come upon her" and that "nothing will be impossible with God". She responds: "Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|1:31-38|131}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time that Mary is due to give birth, she and her husband [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] travel from their home in [[Nazareth]] to Joseph's ancestral home in [[Bethlehem]] to register in the [[Census of Quirinius]]. Finding no place for themselves in the inn, Mary gives birth to Jesus and she places him in a [[manger]] (feeding trough).&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|2:1-7|131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Annunciation to the shepherds|angel of the Lord visits the shepherds]] guarding their flocks in nearby fields and brings them "good news of great joy": "to you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is the Messiah, the Lord." The angel tells them they will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger.

In the Gospel of Matthew, the impending birth is announced to Joseph in a dream, in which he is instructed to name the child Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|1:21|131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Star of Bethlehem|star]] reveals the birth of Jesus to a number (traditionally three) of [[Biblical Magi|''magi'']], Greek ''μάγος'', commonly translated as "wise man" but in this context probably meaning "astronomer" or "astrologer",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Brown | first=Raymond Edward | authorlink=Raymond E.

After the 1st century, traditions flourished that represented the thinking of that time, and also preserved source material for many of the ideas in the "theological writings of the church fathers." In their present form the [[pseudepigrapha]]l writings contained in the [[Sibylline Oracles]] include literature written from the 2nd century BC through the 6th century of the Christian era. They contain some material relevant to the birth and infancy of Jesus. But this passage in the Oracles, Book III, probably represents the hopes of pre-Christian Alexandrian Jews.&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Be of good cheer, O maiden, and exult; for the Eternal, who made heaven and earth, has given thee joy, and he will dwell in thee, and for thee shall be an immortal light.
And wolves and lambs promiscuously shall eat grass in the mountains, and among the kids shall leopards graze,
And wandering bears shall lodge among the calves, and the carnivorous lion
shall eat straw in the manger like the ox,
and little children lead them with a band. For tame will be on earth the beasts he made,
And with young babes will dragons fall asleep, and no harm, for God’s hand will be on them."&lt;ref name="Terry, Milton Spenser"&gt;Terry, Milton Spenser, Aloisius Rzach, The Sibylline Oracles, Eaton &amp; Mains, Cincinnati:: Curtis &amp; Jennings, 1899 (page 93, lines 975-984).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later, the church fathers refer to subsequent books in the Oracles that are clear allusions to Christ, and probably dated from the close of the second or beginning of the 3rd century AD.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The first Christian theologians demonstrated in their writings their knowledge of such non-canonical sources.

The [[New Testament apocrypha#Non-canonical gospels|non-canonical gospels]] contain much that is pertinent. The apocryphal literature departs from the Christian canon and its legends have many elements similar to [[pagan]] stories representing popular beliefs of the church from the second Christian century on through the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt;

==Islam==
[[File:Virgin Mary and Jesus (old Persian miniature).jpg|thumb|left|Mary and Jesus in old [[Persian miniature|Persian Shi'a miniature]].]]

===Jesus in Islam===
The [[Qur'an]] and other Islamic literature contain reports of a number of miraculous births of biblical characters. The [[Qur'an]] describes [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virginal conception]] of Jesus by Mary (Arabic: ''Maryam''), which is recounted throughout several passages in the Qur'an. The narrative goes that Mary was visited by the angel Gabriel that she will give birth to a holy son, named Isa' (Jesus), the Messiah and that he will be a great prophet, to whom God will give the Injil (Gospel) and he will speak in infancy and maturity and will be a companion to the most righteous. When this news was given to Mary, she asked the angel how she can have a baby as she was a [[virgin]].&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an, Chapter 3, Verse 43&lt;/ref&gt; To this, the angel replied "Even though when God wants to create a matter, he merely wills (Kun-fa-yakun) it and the things come into being".&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an, Chapter 3, verse 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

After giving birth, while resting near the trunk of a palm tree Jesus spoke to Mary from the cradle instructing her to shake the tree and obtain its fruits. After showing Jesus as a newborn to her family Jesus again spoke "Lo, I am God's servant; God has given me the Book, and made me a Prophet. Blessed he has made me, wherever I may be; and He has enjoined me to pray, and to give alms, so long as I live and likewise to cherish my mother" in order to dispel rumours of conception.&lt;ref name="EoI-Isa"&gt;"Isa", Encyclopedia of Islam&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc-range|19|30|e=31|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; This birth narrative draws strong parallels to the apocryphal tradition of Jesus' birth within the ''[[Infancy Gospel of Thomas]]'' and ''[[Arabic Infancy Gospel]]''.

===Muhammad===
After the death of the [[Abdullah ibn Abdul-Muttalib|Abdullah]] his wife [[Aminah]] had a vision where angels visited her and informed that soon she will give birth to a boy and told her to name him [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;https://seekerofthesacredknowledge.wordpress.com/2013/01/16/miracles-that-took-place-at-the-time-of-beloved-prophets-blessed-birth%E2%80%8F/&lt;/ref&gt; When Prophet Muhammad was about to be born, Aminah was visited by [[Eve|Hawa]], [[Asiya, wife of the Pharaoh|Asiya]] and [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] with angels to help her.&lt;ref&gt;http://eng.islam-today.ru/society/aminah-the-mother-of-muhammad-peace-be-upon-him/&lt;/ref&gt; All the pagan idols of [[Kaaba]] fall down and bright light appeared.&lt;ref&gt;https://islamicmisconceptions.wordpress.com/2014/01/12/miracles-on-birth-of-prophet-mohammed-s-a-w/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kabir===
{{Main|Sufism}}
In 1440,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/309270/Kabir |title=Kabir &amp;#124; biography - Indian mystic and poet &amp;#124; Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2015-02-18 |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the poet [[Kabir]] was also said to have been born of a virgin widow (a Hindu), through the palm of her hand. Like [[Karna]], Kabir was sent down the river in a basket; he was found and adopted by a family of Muslim weavers, downstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsfinder.org/site/more/kabir/ |title=Kabir presented in Philosophy section |publisher=Newsfinder.org |date=2003-05-24 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/8319260/Images-of-Kabir |title=Images of Kabir |publisher=Scribd.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This (presumably posthumous) account—which depicts Kabir as secretly descended from Hindus—was intended to legitimise Kabir's religious authority in the eyes of the Hindu population who venerated his works. This story is absent from Muslim and Sikh accounts of Kabir's work.

==Other traditions==
===Aztec mythology===

====Huitzilopochtli====
The myth of [[Huitzilopochtli]] is uniquely [[Aztec]]. Huitzilopochtli is therefore considered to be the cult god or the patron god of the [[Aztec]]. As a solar deity, Huitzilopochtli is closely related to and overlaps with [[Tonatiuh]]. Huitzilopochtli’s mother was [[Coatlicue]], or She of the Serpent Skirt. Coatlicue, known for her devout nature and virtuous qualities, was at Mount Coatepec or Coatepetl ("Serpent Hill"; near [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]], [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]]) one day, sweeping and tending to her penance, when she discovered a bundle of feathers on the ground. She decided to save them and placed them in her bosom. Without her realizing, the feathers impregnated her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Diposkan oleh Blue Roland |url=http://aztecgods.blogspot.com/2008/06/birth-of-huitzilopochtli.html |title=Aztec Gods - Resources for all gods, goddesses and deities of Aztec Mythology |publisher=Aztecgods.blogspot.com |date=2007-02-19 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=193tKPdM-ykC&amp;pg=PA584&amp;lpg=PA584&amp;dq=Coatlicue+coatepetl&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5uVmbQvFbA&amp;sig=aRdAaNKf_MVzlH19VbFdfLU4irI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjlj7OB57vOAhXIPZoKHdAsDE4Q6AEIODAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Coatlicue%20coatepetl&amp;f=false |title=The History of the Indies of New Spain |first=Fray Diego |last=Durán |authorlink=Diego Durán |page=584 |origyear=1581 |publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]] |date=October 1994 |others=Translated by [[Doris Heyden|Heyden, Doris]] |isbn=978-0806126494 |accessdate=August 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pages.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/nahuatl/ReadingCoatlicue.html |title=Readings in Classical Nahuatl: The Murders of Coatlicue and Coyolxauhqui |website=[[UCSD]] |first=David K. |last=Jordan |date=January 23, 2016 |accessdate=August 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Quetzalcoatl====
There are several stories about the birth of [[Quetzalcoatl]]. In the first story, Quetzalcoatl was born by a virgin named [[Chimalman]], to whom the god [[Ometeotl]] appeared in a dream.&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Bierlein, ''Living Myths. How Myth Gives Meaning to Human Experience'', Ballantine Books, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In another story, the virgin Chimalman conceived Quetzalcoatl by swallowing an emerald.&lt;ref&gt;David Carrasco, ''Quetzalcoatl and the Irony of Empire'', The University of Chicago Press, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; A third story narrates that Chimalman was hit in the womb by an arrow bolted by [[Mixcoatl]] and nine months later she gave birth to Quetzalcoatl.&lt;ref&gt;J. F. Bierlein, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2016|talk=Bierlein_cite_about_Quetzalcoatl}} A fourth story narrates that Quetzalcoatl was born from [[Coatlicue]], who already had four hundred children who formed the stars of the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;J. F. Bierlein 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mongolian mythology===
According to a legend narrated by ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]'', a Mongol woman named [[Alan Gua]] had a son, named [[Bodonchar Munkhag|Bodonchar]], some years after her husband has died. She claimed a radiant yellow person visited her at night and impregnated her. She believed the visitor was the god [[Tengri]]. Bodonchar became the founder of the [[Borjigin]] tribe and a direct ancestor of [[Genghis Khan]].&lt;ref&gt;Lococo Paul, ''Genghis Khan: History's Greatest Empire Builder'', Potomac Books, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese mythology===
Miraculous births are common in Japanese folklore, and include [[Momotarō]] the Peach Boy (who was found inside a giant peach floating on a river), [[Kintarō]] (about whom several origin myths are told), and [[The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter|Kaguya-hime]] (who was born inside the stalk of a glowing bamboo plant).

===Native American mythology===
The [[Great Peacemaker]], sometimes referred to as Deganawida or Dekanawida ([[Iroquois]]) was born a Huron, and by some accounts, his mother was a virgin, so the birth was miraculous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Discovery TV |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFIgq8D3oRk|location= Location 14:00min |title=War of the American Indians : Documentary on the History of the Iroquois |date=2013-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ray Frank Gricar''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|r|iː|k|ɑr}}; born October 9, 1945, missing April 15, 2005) was an [[United States|American]] [[lawyer|attorney]] who served as the [[district attorney]] of [[Centre County, Pennsylvania|Centre County]], [[Pennsylvania]], from 1985 until 2005. On April 15, 2005, Gricar went [[missing person|missing]] under mysterious circumstances and has not been heard from since.   After he had been missing for over six years with no trace of his whereabouts, Centre County authorities declared Gricar [[declared death in absentia|legally dead]] on July 25, 2011.

Born in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], Gricar received his [[Juris Doctor]] degree from [[Case Western Reserve University School of Law]] and began his career as a [[prosecutor]] for [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga County]]. He moved to [[State College, Pennsylvania]], around 1980 and, after a brief stint as an assistant district attorney, was elected district attorney of Centre County in 1985. He was re-elected four times before announcing that he would not run for re-election in the 2005 campaign.

Gricar was reported missing to authorities after failing to return home from a road trip. His car was found in [[Lewisburg, Pennsylvania]] with his [[cell phone]] inside, and his [[laptop]] computer was found in the adjacent [[Susquehanna River]]; other than that, no trace of Gricar has been found.

==Early life and career==
Gricar was born in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], and grew up in the city's [[Collinwood]] neighborhood.&lt;ref name=Renner&gt;{{cite book|last=Renner|first=James|title=The Serial Killer's Apprentice: And 12 Other True Stories of Cleveland's Most Intriguing Unsolved Crimes|year=2008|publisher=Gray &amp; Company|isbn=1-59851-046-0|pages=51&amp;ndash;64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LcLBGdkLI0EC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended high school at the [[Gilmour Academy]], a prestigious [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] school in [[Gates Mills, Ohio|Gates Mills]].&lt;ref name=Renner /&gt; He went on to attend the [[University of Dayton]], where he became interested in studying law after working as an [[internship|intern]] for the prosecutor's office. After graduating, he moved back to Cleveland to study law at [[Case Western Reserve University School of Law]]. He obtained his [[Juris Doctor]] and subsequently took a job as a prosecutor for [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga County]], specializing in prosecuting cases of [[rape]] and [[murder]].&lt;ref name=Renner /&gt;&lt;ref name=GricarCV&gt;{{cite news|title=Ray Gricar, Curriculum Vita|url=http://www.centredaily.com/2009/06/11/2396902/ray-gricar-curriculum-vita.html|accessdate=March 30, 2011|date=June 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319220931/http://www.centredaily.com/2009/06/11/2396902/ray-gricar-curriculum-vita.html#|archive-date=2012-03-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Gricar moved to [[State College, Pennsylvania]], when his wife took a job at [[Pennsylvania State University]].&lt;ref name=Renner /&gt; He opted to become a [[stay-at-home dad]] to his young daughter following the move. However, [[Centre County, Pennsylvania|Centre County]] District Attorney David E. Grine offered Gricar an assistant position, which he accepted.&lt;ref name=Renner /&gt; In 1985, the incumbent district attorney, Robert Mix (Grine's successor), chose not to run for re-election, and Gricar ran for the open position. He won the election by a margin of 600 votes.&lt;ref name=GricarCV /&gt;

Gricar's office was part-time when he was elected, and he successfully campaigned to make it full-time in 1996.&lt;ref name=GricarCV /&gt;&lt;ref name=ReadingEagle20050417&gt;{{cite news|title=Police search by land and air for Centre County prosecutor|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=in4xAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5789,304024&amp;dq=ray+gricar|accessdate=March 30, 2011|newspaper=Reading Eagle|date=April 17, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was re-elected in 1989, 1993, 1997, and 2001.&lt;ref name=GricarCV /&gt; During his tenure, Gricar prosecuted the perpetrator of the 1996 Hetzel Union Building shooting.&lt;ref name=ReadingEagle20050417 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyPenn19960919&gt;{{cite news|last=Fiore|first=Mark|title=Woman charged in PSU murder|url=http://www.dailypennsylvanian.com/node/8165|accessdate=March 30, 2011|newspaper=The Daily Pennsylvanian|date=September 19, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Gricar declined to press charges against longtime [[Penn State Nittany Lions|Penn State]] assistant football coach [[Jerry Sandusky]] following allegations of [[sexual abuse]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ganim|first=Sara|title=Penn State Scandal: Gricar had final say in ending inquiry|url=http://www.centredaily.com/2011/11/06/2976046/gricar-had-final-say-in-ending.html|accessdate=November 8, 2011|newspaper=Centre Daily Times|date=November 6, 2011|location=State College, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandusky was charged and convicted of [[Penn State sex abuse scandal|multiple counts of child sexual abuse]] thirteen years later. In 2004, Gricar announced he would not run for re-election, and would retire from practicing law altogether in December 2005, shortly after his 60th birthday.&lt;ref name=GricarCV/&gt;&lt;ref name=ReadingEagle20050417 /&gt;

==Personal life==
Gricar met Barbara Gray during his undergraduate study at the University of Dayton. She moved to Cleveland with him after graduation and they married in 1969.&lt;ref name="Renner" /&gt; They adopted a baby girl, Lara, in 1978.&lt;ref name="Renner" /&gt; Ray and Barbara Gricar divorced in 1991; Ray married again in 1996, but divorced in 2001.&lt;ref name="PPG20050419"&gt;{{cite news|last=Reed Ward|first=Paula|title=Mystery surrounds missing Centre County DA|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05109/490420-85.stm|accessdate=March 30, 2011|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=April 19, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 or 2003, Gricar moved in with his girlfriend Patty Fornicola, an employee of the Centre County District Attorney's office.&lt;ref name="GricarCV" /&gt; He was living with Fornicola in her childhood home in [[Bellefonte, Pennsylvania|Bellefonte]] at the time of his disappearance.&lt;ref name="PPG20050419" /&gt;

Ray Gricar's older brother Roy disappeared from his [[West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio|West Chester, Ohio]], home in May 1996. His body was found a week later in the [[Great Miami River]]; authorities ruled his death a [[suicide]].&lt;ref name="PPG20050419" /&gt;

==Disappearance==
At 11:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. ([[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]) on April 15, 2005, Gricar called Fornicola to inform her that he was driving through the Brush Valley area northeast of [[Centre Hall]].&lt;ref name=DailyTimes20110330&gt;{{cite news|last=Ganim|first=Sara|title=Gricar disappearance at 5 years: Trail growing cold|url=http://www.centredaily.com/2010/04/15/1915225/trail-growing-cold.html|accessdate=March 30, 2011|newspaper=Centre Daily Times|date=April 15, 2010|location=State College, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gricar failed to return home, and late that evening, Fornicola reported him [[missing person|missing]].&lt;ref name=DailyTimes20110330 /&gt;

The following day, investigators identified Gricar's red [[Mini (marque)|Mini Cooper]] in an antique-store parking lot in [[Lewisburg, Pennsylvania|Lewisburg]].&lt;ref name=REagle20050419&gt;{{cite news|title=Expanded search gives no clues on missing Centre County DA|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jH4xAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3826,3070043&amp;dq=ray+gricar+car|accessdate=April 11, 2011|newspaper=Reading Eagle|date=April 19, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car contained his county-issued cell phone but not his [[laptop computer]], keys, or wallet.&lt;ref name="PPG20050419" /&gt; Investigators identified no signs of [[Crime|foul play]].&lt;ref name=PPG20050419 /&gt; Police and family members noted that the location of the vehicle, adjacent to two bridges over the [[Susquehanna River]], bore some similarities to the location of the vehicle of Gricar's older brother Roy when he committed suicide in 1996.&lt;ref name=REagle20050419 /&gt; In the days following the discovery of Ray Gricar's vehicle, authorities searched the river and its banks but found no sign of him.&lt;ref name="PPG20050419" /&gt; Police also noted that a sniffer dog's behaviour around where Gricar's car was found suggested that he might have got into another vehicle with someone else.&lt;ref name="seattletimes.com"&gt;https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/missing-da-is-it-foul-play-or-did-he-commit-suicide/&lt;/ref&gt; Pennsylvania authorities asked the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] to analyze his bank accounts, credit card records, and cell phone records, but found no clues as to where he may have been.&lt;ref name="PPG20050419" /&gt;

On July 30, fishermen discovered Gricar's county-issued laptop in the Susquehanna River beneath a bridge between Lewisburg and [[Milton, Pennsylvania|Milton]], but its [[hard drive]] was missing.&lt;ref name="PPG20050802"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ward|first=Paula Reed|title=Missing DA's laptop found|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iZYNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5334,210533&amp;dq=ray+gricar+laptop|accessdate=April 11, 2011|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=August 2, 2005|pages=B-1, B-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divers searched the area of the river near where it was found over the next several days, but found nothing else.&lt;ref name="PPG20050802" /&gt; Two months later, someone recovered a hard drive on the banks of the Susquehanna River about {{convert|100|yd|m}} from the location of the laptop, and investigators hypothesized that it had come from his computer;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Missing DA's Hard Drive Found|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/local&amp;id=3575298|publisher=WPVI-TV|accessdate=April 11, 2011|location=Philadelphia|date=October 26, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it was badly damaged, and analysis by the FBI, the [[United States Secret Service|U.S. Secret Service]], and the data-recovery firm [[Kroll Ontrack]] failed to recover anything from it.&lt;ref name="CDT20080923"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ganim|first=Sara|title=Gricar hard drive yields no clues|url=http://www.centredaily.com/2008/09/23/857207/gricar-hard-drive-yields-no-clues.html|accessdate=April 11, 2011|newspaper=Centre Daily Times|date=September 23, 2008|location=State College, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2009, Bellefonte police revealed that before Gricar's disappearance, someone had used the home computer at the couple's residence to perform [[internet search]]es on topics such as "how to wreck a hard drive", "how to fry a hard drive" and "water damage to a notebook computer".&lt;ref name="unidenfified"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.centredaily.com/2011/07/06/2818532/family-seeks-closure.html|title=RAY GRICAR DISAPPEARANCE: Judge asked to declare ex-DA ‘legally dead’|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709151400/http://www.centredaily.com/2011/07/06/2818532/family-seeks-closure.html|archivedate=July 9, 2011|date=July 6, 2011|author=Cliff White|work=Centre Daily Times}}

In June 2011, Gricar's daughter Lara, who was trustee of his [[Estate (law)|estate]], petitioned Centre County to declare him dead. County President Judge David E.

==Theories==
There are three main theories as to what happened to Gricar.

The primary theory is he committed suicide just as his brother had done, something supported by the similarities between the two cases.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jH4xAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QKMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3826,3070043&amp;dq=ray+gricar+car&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt; Police working on the case believed this theory to be most likely, although his family did not believe this. Although Gricar was a poor swimmer, he had no medical history of depression or of suicidal thoughts. He was also reportedly looking forward to his upcoming retirement.&lt;ref name="seattletimes.com"/&gt;

The second theory is foul play. Early on it was suggested that Gricar's disappearance might be linked to the unsolved death of Assistant U.S. Attorney [[Jonathan Luna]], a drug investigator who was found dead in a Lancaster County creek in December 2003. Gricar had recently been involved in a police operation busting a heroin dealing ring, and the criminals concerned were investigated for any links to his disappearance, but none were found. Suggestions were also made that Gricar's decision to decline to prosecute Penn State football coach [[Jerry Sandusky]] for alleged sexual assault of a minor might be linked to his disappearance. Gricar's own family came under suspicion: both his girlfriend and his stepdaughter were asked to take polygraphs by the police, which they both passed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2015/04/ten_years_later_ray_gricars_di.html&lt;/ref&gt; A senior former member of [[Hell's Angels]] claimed in 2012 that Gricar was killed by another member of the gang as payback for having previously given him a lengthy prison sentence for aggravated assault. He stated that the body was hidden in a mine shaft, but declined to give a specific location.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The third theory is that he wished to start a new life and therefore engineered his disappearance. Gricar allegedly expressed interest in the case of a Cleveland police chief who had disappeared in order to start a new life. Multiple sightings of Gricar were reported after his disappearance, most notably in a bar in [[Wilkes-Barre]], where both the bartender and an off-duty police officer claimed to have seen Gricar watching a baseball game.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/article_0217fd2e-833c-58b2-bc37-3492adc0cd07.html&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that Gricar may have taken off to Eastern Europe. He was semi-fluent in Russian and fluent in Slovak. He had relatives in Slovenia and had made trips to this region of the world in the past.&lt;ref&gt;https://happyvalleycitizen.wordpress.com/2018/03/23/ray-gricar-is-alive-and-well-in-slovenia/&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Gricar's disappearance was the subject of television documentary programs, including episodes of ''[[Haunting Evidence]]'' on [[Court TV]] in June 2006, ''[[Disappeared (TV series)|Disappeared]]'' on [[Investigation Discovery]] in February 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investigation.discovery.com/tv/disappeared/the-missing/ray-gricar.html |title=Ray Gricar |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and news magazine ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' in December 2011. An episode of the drama ''[[Without a Trace]]'' on [[CBS]] referred to the case.&lt;ref name="CBSVideo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Missing D.A. Left Few Clues|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/i_video/main500251.shtml?id=2608135n|work=The Early Show|publisher=CBS|accessdate=April 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''reasonable person model''' ('''RPM''') is a psychological framework which argues that people are at their best when their informational needs are met. Positing that unreasonableness is not a human trait, but rather the result of environment (context and circumstances), the RPM attempts to define the environments/actions that foster reasonableness,  defining three key areas that assist with this: model building, being effective, and meaningful action.

The RPM was developed by environmental psychologists [[Rachel and Stephen Kaplan|Stephen and Rachel Kaplan]] and integrates principles from [[environmental psychology|environmental]], [[cognitive psychology|cognitive]], and [[evolutionary psychology]].

== Overview ==
[[File:Reasonable Person Model Diagram 2.png|alt=RPM Diagram|thumb|RPM diagram (&amp;copy; 2011, Rachel Kaplan)]]
The RPM is a psychological framework that posits human functioning is improved when the following three domains of informational needs are met:&lt;ref name="Kaplan2008"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.01010.x | volume = 22 | pages = 826–829 | last = Kaplan | first = Rachel | last2 = Kaplan | first2 = Stephen | title = Bringing out the best in people: A psychological perspective | journal = Conservation Biology | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Model building''' –  RPM posits that a central informational need is to build [[mental model]]s (also known as [[cognitive map]]s) in order to function effectively in the world. It suggests that mental models help people recognize objects and circumstances, predict and evaluate possible future outcomes and decide on actions.
* '''Being effective''' – This focuses on helping people utilize knowledge effectively by developing the necessary skills, also maintaining a clear head in order to function effectively.
* '''Meaningful action''' – RPM suggests that people wish to use their skills to make a difference, meaning they wish to be listened to and be given opportunities to participate.

RPM states that an environment or context supportive of informational needs can foster reasonable behavior that will "bring out the best in people".&lt;ref name="Kaplan2008"/&gt;

==Conceptualizing reasonableness==
The use of the term ''reasonable'' in RPM has commonalities and differences with the colloquial use of the word. In RPM, reasonableness refers to the ways in which "one would hope people behave".&lt;ref name="Kaplan2000"&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 56 | pages = 491–508 | last = Kaplan | first = Stephen | title = Human nature and environmentally responsible behavior | journal = Journal of Social Issues | date = 2000 | doi = 10.1111/0022-4537.00180}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept is partially conveyed by what it is not, unreasonable states such as incivility, aggression, irritability and impatience. Examples may also include "...demanding fairness for oneself while denying it to others, displaying intolerance and disrespect for others, willingness to harm or kill because of differences in beliefs, and attempting to extract the earth’s resources for personal gain without regard for the needs of future generations".&lt;ref name="Kaplan2009"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jenvp.2008.10.005 | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 329–339 | last = Kaplan | first = Stephen | last2 = Kaplan | first2 = Rachel | title = Creating a larger role for environmental psychology: The Reasonable Person Model as an integrative framework | journal = Journal of Environmental Psychology | date = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparison to theories on rationality ===
The RPM may be viewed as a contrary theory to [[Homo economicus|rational man theory]] (also known as [[Homo economicus|Homo Economicus]]) or related [[rational choice theory]], in that it describes a landscape of mutual dependencies, such as the manner in which people treat one another. RPM assumes that information is often misunderstood, overwhelming, and unavailable. It also assumes that people are not interested in maximizing personal gain, but rather [[satisficing]]. RPM further asserts that people often have multiple concerns which cannot be reduced to a single monetary value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Cornell University Press | last = Midgley | first = Mary | title = Beast and Man: Roots of Human Nature | date = 1978 |isbn = 0203626508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparison to subjective well-being ===
Reasonableness shares some themes with [[subjective well-being]], including emphasis on positive/negative affect and quality of life. However, whereas SWB addresses self-directed feelings, RPM also considers the contexts that foster civil behavior and improve relationships between people.&lt;ref name="Basu2014"&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Edward Elgar | editors = Timo J.

==Model building==
The world, as [[William James]] described it, is a "blooming buzzing confusion".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Principles of Psychology|last = James|first = William|publisher = Dover|year = 1890|isbn = 0-486-20381-6|location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Mental models are neural structures, made of [[neuron]]s and [[synapse]]s, that organize our experiences into a usable form and allow us to
#[[Object Recognition in Cognitive Neuroscience|recognize objects]], situations, and other patterns,
#predict possible future outcomes,
#evaluate those outcomes offline, and
#take appropriate action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Aldine | pages = 63–78 | editors = R. M. Downs, D. Stea (eds.) | last = Kaplan | first = Stephen | title = Image and Environment | chapter = Cognitive maps in perception and thought | location = Chicago, IL | date = 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, [[Kenneth Craik]] described these affordances:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If the organism carries a “small-scale model” of external reality and of its own possible actions within its head, it is able to try out various alternatives, conclude which is the best of them, react to future situations before they arise, utilize the knowledge of past events in dealing with the present and future, and in every way to react in a much fuller, easier, and more competent manner to the emergencies which face it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Nature of Explanation|last = Craik|first = Kenneth J. W.|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1943|isbn = 9780521094450|location = London|pages = 61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Mechanisms of model building ===
Mental models are built through repetition, variation, and association. Experiencing something multiple times is said to lead to an [[Mental representation|internal representation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Ulrich's Press | isbn = 0030623448 | last = Kaplan | first = Stephen | last2 = Kaplan | first2 = Rachel | title = Cognition and environment: functioning in an uncertain world | location = Ann Arbor, MI | date = 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiencing sequences of things [[Association (psychology)|associates]] our internal representations in a mental map according to how those things occur in reality. [[Donald O. Hebb|Donald Hebb's]] [[Hebbian theory|rule]] put it as: Things that fire together, wire together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Organization of Behavior|last = Hebb|first = Donald O.|publisher =Wiley &amp; Sons |year =1949 |isbn = |location =New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Being effective==
This refers to the skills needed over and above basic knowledge to accomplish goals and refers to a state of mind that is capable of attending to and managing information. Lack of clearheadedness is described within [[attention restoration theory]], which states there are two attentional systems: one for attending to naturally fascinating stimuli and another that allows us to intentionally direct our attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url = |title = The restorative benefits of nature: toward an integrative frame-work |last = Kaplan|first = Stephen|date = 1995|journal = Journal of Environmental Psychology|accessdate = |doi = 10.1016/0272-4944(95)90001-2|pmid = |volume = 15|pages = 169–182}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Louv]]'s notion of [[nature deficit disorder]] describes some of the symptoms associated with a younger generation who do not spend time outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Last Child in the Woods|last = Louv|first = Richard|publisher =Algonquin Books |year =2005 |isbn =9781565126053 |location =Chapel Hill |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaningful action==
RPM's third domain argues that people have a desire to use their knowledge and skills to make a difference. Fewer people have work that is directly connected to their survival yet the evolutionary desire to make a difference remains. The inability to do so can lead to [[learned helplessness]] and feeling hopeless and alone in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges.  Such a state is not amenable to effective human functioning, yet there continues to be, as Kaplan describes, a "pervasive malaise of helplessness".&lt;ref name="Kaplan2000" /&gt; Goldschmidt described what he termed The Human Career as: one in which humans are primarily seeking the respect of others".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Human Career: The self in the symbolic world|last = Goldschmidt|first = Walter|authorlink1=Walter Goldschmidt|publisher = Basil Blackwell|year = 1990|isbn = |location = Cambridge, MA, USA|pages = |publication-place = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that, in participatory contexts, the most effective strategies are ones that help people feel like they can make a difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Environmental Locus of Control, Sympathy, and Proenvironmental Behavior A Test of Geller’s Actively Caring Hypothesis|last = Allen|first = James B.|date = 1999|journal = Environment and Behavior|accessdate = |doi = 10.1177/00139169921972137|pmid = |last2 = Ferrand|first2 = Jennifer L.|volume = 31|issue = 3|pages = 338–353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Russian tortoise''' (''Agrionemys horsfieldii''), also commonly known as the '''Afghan tortoise''', the '''Central Asian tortoise''', '''Horsfield's tortoise''', and the '''steppe tortoise''', is a [[threatened species]] of [[tortoise]] in the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Testudinidae]]. The species is [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[Central Asia]]. Human activities in its native habitat contribute to its threatened status.

==Etymology==
Both the [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]], ''horsfieldii'', and the common name "Horsfield's tortoise" are in honor of the [[Americans|American]] [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[Thomas Horsfield]].&lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). ''The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. {{ISBN|978-1-4214-0135-5}}. (''Agrionemys horsfieldii'', p. 126).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systematics==
This species is traditionally placed in ''[[Testudo (genus)|Testudo]]''. Due to distinctly different [[comparative anatomy|morphological]] characteristics, the [[monotypic]] [[genus]] ''Agrionemys'' was proposed for it in 1966. Today, ''Agrionemys horsfieldii'' is currently being accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Khozatsky &amp; Mlynarski (1966)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nucleic acid sequence|DNA sequence]] analysis generally concurs, but not too robustly so.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Fritz ''et al.'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources also list three separate [[subspecies]] of Russian tortoise, but they are not widely accepted by [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomists]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reptile-database.reptarium.cz/species.php?genus=Testudo&amp;species=horsfieldii |title=''Testudo horsfieldii ''|website=[[Reptile Database]] |access-date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The Russian tortoise is a small tortoise species, with a size range of {{convert|13|-|25|cm|0|abbr=on}}. [[Female]]s grow slightly larger ({{convert|15|-|25|cm|0|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) to accommodate more eggs. Males average {{convert|13|-|20|cm|0|abbr=on}}.
 
Russian tortoises are [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. [[Male]]s tend to have longer [[tail]]s generally tucked to the side, and longer claws; females have a short, fat tail, with shorter claws than the males. The male has a slit-shaped vent (cloaca) near the tip of its tail; the female has an asterisk-shaped vent (cloaca).
Russian tortoises have four toes. Coloration varies, but the shell is usually a ruddy brown or black, fading to yellow between the scutes, and the body is straw-yellow and brown depending on the subspecies.

The male Russian tortoise courts a female through head bobbing, circling, and biting her forelegs. When she submits, he mounts her from behind, making high-pitched squeaking noises during mating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://russiantortoise.net/breeding.htm |title=Breeding Russian Tortoises |website=The Russian Tortoise |access-date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The species can spend as much as 9 months of the year in dormancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://animals.net/russian-tortoise/ |title=Russian Tortoise - Description, Habitat, Image, Diet, and Interesting Facts |publisher=Animals Network |accessdate=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In captivity==
In captivity, diet typically consists of [[Valerianella locusta|lamb's lettuce]], [[Ture plantain|plantains]] and [[geranium]]s. The diet should be varied and may include juvenile [[Taraxacum|dandelion]]s and different species of lettuce, though like very many plants, they should be fed rarely due to potentially harmful side effects (for the former) or a lack of nutritional value (for the latter).{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} &lt;!-- &lt;ref name="diet"/&gt; --&gt;
Water is important for all species, but the tortoise, being an arid species, will typically get water from their food, but they still need a constant supply. Tortoises should be soaked in warm water up to the mid shell. Tortoises typically empty their bowels in water as to hide their scent, this is an instinct, and it also helps keep their enclosure cleaner.&lt;ref name="diet"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://russiantortoise.org/russiantortoisediet.htm|title=Russian Tortoise Diet|last=|first=|date=2002|website=russiantortoise.org|publisher=Joe Heinen|access-date=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian tortoises do not require a [[CITES]] Article X certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tortoise &amp; the Law|url=http://www.faunaimportuk.com/info/sale-of-tortoises-the-law|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1968 Moon flight==
In September 1968 two Russian tortoises flew to the Moon, circled it, and returned safely to Earth on the Russian [[Zond 5]] mission. Accompanied by mealworms, plants, and other lifeforms, they were the first Earth creatures to travel to the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/12/who-was-first-in-the-race-to-the-moon-the-tortoise/266665/ |title=Who Was First in the Race to the Moon?

In the [[social science]]s, '''social structure''' is the patterned social arrangements in [[society]] that are both [[emergence|emergent]] from and determinant of the [[Structure and agency|actions of the individuals]]. On the [[Macrosociology|macro]] scale, social structure is the system of socioeconomic [[social stratification|stratification]] (e.g., the class structure), [[social institutions]], or, other patterned relations between large social groups. On the meso scale, it is the structure of [[social network]] ties between individuals or organizations. On the micro scale, it can be the way [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] shape the behavior of individuals within the [[social system]].

[[Norm (social)|Social norms]] influence social structure through relations between the majority and the minority.  Because those who align with the majority are considered [[normality (behavior)|normal]] while those who align with the minority are considered [[Abnormality (behavior)|abnormal]], majority-minority relations create a [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] stratification within social structures that favors the majority in all aspects of society.

These scales are not always kept separate. For example, recent scholarship by [[John Levi Martin]] has theorized that certain macro-scale structures are the [[emergent properties]] of micro-scale cultural institutions (this meaning of "structure" resembles that used by anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]). Likewise, another recent study, in ethnography, describes how indigenous social structure in the Republic of Panama changed macro social structures and impeded a planned Panama Canal expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Müller-Schwarze|first1=Nina K.|title=The Blood of Victoriano Lorenzo: An Ethnography of the Cholos of Northern Coclé Province.|date=2015|publisher=McFarland Press|location=Jefferson, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Marxist sociology]] also has a history of mixing different meanings of social structure, though it has done so by simply treating the cultural aspects of social structure as [[epiphenomena]] of its economic ones.

Since the 1920s, the term has been in general use in social science,&lt;ref&gt;Merton, Robert. 1938. ''Social Structure and Anomie''. American Sociological Review, Vol. 3, No.5, pp.672-682&lt;/ref&gt; especially as a variable whose sub-components needed to be distinguished in relationship to other sociological variables.

==Overview==
The notion of social structure ''as relationship between different entities or groups'' or as ''enduring and relatively stable patterns of relationship''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Olanike|first=Deji|title=Gender and Rural Development  By|pages=71|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Friw38mN7-kC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=as+relationships+between+different+entities+or+groups+or+as+enduring+and+relatively+stable+patterns+of+relationship+emphasises#v=onepage&amp;q=as%20relationships%20between%20different%20entities%20or%20groups%20or%20as%20enduring%20and%20relatively%20stable%20patterns%20of%20relationship%20emphasises&amp;f=false|isbn=9783643901033|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasises the idea that society is grouped into structurally related groups or sets of [[role]]s, with different functions, meanings or purposes. One example of social structure is the idea of "[[social stratification]]", which refers to the idea that most societies are separated into different strata (levels), guided (if only partially) by the underlying structures in the social system. This approach has been important in the academic literature with the rise of various forms of [[structuralism]]. It is important in the modern study of organizations, because an organization's structure may determine its flexibility, capacity to change, and many other factors. Therefore, structure is an important issue for [[management]].

Social structure may be seen to influence important social systems including the [[economic system]], [[legal system]], [[political system]], [[cultural system]], and others. [[Family]], [[religion]], [[law]], [[economy]], and [[Social class|class]] are all social structures. The "social system" is the parent system of those various systems that are embedded in it.

==History==
The early study of social structures has informed the study of institutions, culture and agency, social interaction, and history. [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] was apparently the first to use the term social structure; later, [[Karl Marx]], [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Max Weber]], [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], and [[Émile Durkheim]] all contributed to structural concepts in sociology. Weber investigated and analyzed the institutions of modern society: [[Market (economics)|market]], [[bureaucracy]] (private enterprise and public administration), and politics (e.g. democracy).

One of the earliest and most comprehensive accounts of social structure was provided by Karl Marx, who related political, cultural, and religious life to the [[mode of production]] (an underlying economic structure). Marx argued that the economic [[Base and superstructure (Marxism)|base]] substantially determined the cultural and political [[Base and superstructure (Marxism)|superstructure]] of a society. Subsequent Marxist accounts, such as that by [[Louis Althusser]], proposed a more complex relationship that asserted the relative autonomy of cultural and political institutions, and a general determination by economic factors only "in the last instance".&lt;ref name=Calhoun&gt;Dictionary of the Social Science, "''Social Structure''" article&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, the German sociologist [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] first published his study ''The Present Problems of Social Structure'' in the U.S.A,&lt;ref&gt;''The [[American Journal of Sociology]]'', vol. 10, 1905, no. 5, p. 569-688&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that only the ''constitution'' of a multitude into a unity creates a "social structure" (basing this approach on his concept of [[will (sociology)|social will]]).

[[Émile Durkheim]] (drawing on the analogies between biological and social systems popularized by [[Herbert Spencer]] and others) introduced the idea that diverse social institutions and practices played a role in assuring the functional integration of society through assimilation of diverse parts into a unified and self-reproducing whole. In this context, Durkheim distinguished two forms of structural relationship: [[mechanical solidarity]] and [[organic solidarity]]. The former describes structures that unite similar parts through a shared culture; the latter describes differentiated parts united through social exchange and material interdependence.&lt;ref name=Calhoun/&gt;

As did Marx and Weber, more generally, [[Georg Simmel]] developed a wide-ranging approach that provided observations and insights into domination and subordination,  competition, division of labor, formation of parties, representation, inner solidarity coupled with exclusiveness toward the outside, and many similar features in the state, in a religious community, in an economic association, in an art school, and in family and kinship networks (however diverse the interests that give rise to these associations, the forms in which interests are realized may yet be identical (Crothers, 1996)).

The notion of social structure was extensively developed in the 20th century, with key contributions from [[structuralism|structuralist]] perspectives drawing on the theories of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], Feminist or Marxist perspectives, from [[structural functionalism|functionalist]] perspectives such as those developed by [[Talcott Parsons]] and his followers, or from a variety of analytic perspectives (see Blau 1975, Lopez and Scott 2000). Some follow Marx in trying to identify the basic dimensions of society that explain the other dimensions, most emphasizing either economic production or political power. Others follow Lévi-Strauss in seeking logical order in cultural structures. Still others, notably [[Peter Blau]], follow Simmel in attempting to base a formal theory of social structure on numerical patterns in relationships—analyzing, for example, the ways in which factors like [[Group size measures|group size]] shape intergroup relations.&lt;ref name=Calhoun/&gt;

The notion of social structure is intimately related to a variety of central topics in social science, including the relation of [[structure and agency]]. The most influential attempts to combine the concept of social structure with agency are [[Anthony Giddens]]' [[theory of structuration]] and [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s [[practice theory]]. Giddens emphasizes the duality of structure and agency, in the sense that structures and agency cannot be conceived apart from one another. This permits him to argue that structures are neither independent of actors nor determining of their behavior, but rather sets of rules and competencies on which actors draw, and which, in the aggregate, they reproduce. Giddens's analysis, in this respect, closely parallels [[Jacques Derrida]]'s deconstruction of the binaries that underlie classic sociological and anthropological reasoning (notably the universalizing tendencies of Lévi-Strauss's structuralism). Bourdieu's practice theory also seeks a more supple account of social structure as embedded in, rather than determinative of, individual behavior.&lt;ref name=Calhoun/&gt;

Other recent work by [[Margaret Archer]] (morphogenesis theory), [[Tom R. Burns]] and collaborators ([[actor-system dynamics theory]] and [[social rule system theory]]), and [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] ([[World Systems Theory]]) provided elaborations and applications of the sociological classics in structural sociology.

==Definitions and concepts==
As noted above, social structure has been identified as
* the relationship of definite entities or groups to each other,
* enduring patterns of behaviour by participants in a social system in relation to each other, and
* institutionalised norms or cognitive frameworks that structure the actions of actors in the social system.

Lopez and Scott (2000) distinguish between ''institutional structure'' and ''relational structure'', where in the former:

{{cquote|''...social structure is seen as comprising those cultural or normative patterns that define the expectations of agents hold about each other's behaviour and that organize their enduring relations with each other.'' (p. 3)}}

whereas in the latter:

{{cquote|''...social structure is seen as comprising the relationships themselves, understood as patterns of causal interconnection and interdependence among agents and their actions, as well as the positions that they occupy.'' (p. 3)}}

Social structure can also be divided into [[Microsociology|microstructure]] and [[Macrosociology|macrostructure]]. Microstructure is the pattern of relations between most basic elements of social life, that cannot be further divided and have no social structure of their own (for example, pattern of relations between individuals in a group composed of individuals - where individuals have no social structure, or a structure of organizations as a pattern of relations between [[social position]]s or [[social role]]s, where those positions and roles have no structure by themselves). Macrostructure is thus a kind of 'second level' structure, a pattern of relations between objects that have their own structure (for example, a political social structure between political parties, as political parties have their own social structure). Some types of social structures that modern sociologist differentiate are ''relation structures'' (in family or larger family-like clan structures), ''communication structures'' (how information is passed in organizations) and ''[[sociometry|sociometric structures]]'' (structures of sympathy, antipathy and indifference in organisations - this was studied by [[Jacob L. Moreno]]).

[[Social rule system theory]] reduces the structures of (3) to particular rule system arrangements, that is, the types of basic structures of (1 and 2). It shares with [[role theory]], [[organizational sociology|organizational]] and [[institutional sociology]], and [[Social network#Social network analysis|network analysis]] the concern with structural properties and developments and at the same time provides detailed conceptual tools needed to generate interesting, fruitful propositions and models and analyses.

Sociologists also distinguish between:
* normative structure – pattern of relations in given structure (organisation) between [[norm (sociology)|norms]] and modes of operations of people of varying [[social position]]s
* ideal structure – pattern of relations between beliefs and views of people of varying social positions
* interest structure – pattern of relations between goals and desires of people of varying social positions
* interaction structure – forms of communications of people of varying social positions

==Origins and development==
Some believe that social structure is naturally developed. It may be caused by larger system needs, such as the need for [[labour (economics)|labour]], [[management]], [[professional]] and [[military]] classes, or by conflicts between groups, such as competition among [[political party|political parties]] or among [[elite]]s and [[Hoi polloi|masses]]. Others believe that this structuring is not a result of natural processes, but is socially constructed. It may be created by the power of elites who seek to retain their power, or by [[economic system]]s that place emphasis upon [[competition]] or [[cooperation]].  

Ethnography has contributed to understandings about social structure by revealing local practices and customs that differ from Western practices of hierarchy and economic power in its construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Müller-Schwarze|first1=Nina K.|title=The Blood of Victoriano Lorenzo: An Ethnography of the Cholos of Northern Coclé Province.|date=2015|publisher=McFarland Press|location=Jefferson, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most thorough account of the evolution of social structure is perhaps provided by [[structure and agency]] accounts that allow for a sophisticated analysis of the co-evolution of social structure and human agency, where socialised agents with a degree of autonomy take action in social systems where their action is on the one hand mediated by existing institutional structure and expectations but may, on the other hand, influence or transform that institutional structure.  

==Critical implications==
The notion of social structure may mask systematic biases, as it involves many identifiable subvariables, for example, gender. Some argue that men and women who have otherwise equal qualifications receive different treatment in the workplace because of their gender, which would be termed a "social structural" bias, but other variables (such as time on the job or hours worked) might be masked. Modern social structural analysis takes this into account through [[multivariate analysis]] and other techniques, but the analytic problem of how to combine various aspects of social life into a whole remains.&lt;ref&gt;Aberration, t AL., 2000; Jay &amp; Vary 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Special sciences''' are those sciences other than [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]], that are presumed to be [[reductionism|reducible]] to fundamental physics, at least in principle. In this view, [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[neuroscience]]—indeed, all sciences except fundamental physics—are special sciences.  The status of the special sciences, and their relation to physics, is unresolved in the [[philosophy of science]]. [[Jerry Fodor]], for instance, has argued for ''strong autonomy'', concluding that the special sciences are not even in principle reducible to physics.&lt;ref&gt;Fodor, J. (1974): "Special sciences and the disunity of science as a working hypothesis", ''Synthese'', 28, pp. 97-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Toilet 370x580.jpg|thumb|A toilet.]]
There have been many '''[[toilet]]-related [[injury|injurie]]s and [[death]]s''' throughout history and in [[urban legend]]s.

==Accidental injuries==
Infants and toddlers have fallen into toilets and drowned. Safety devices exist to help prevent such accidents.&lt;ref name = NIHbath&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000020.htm|title=Bathing an infant: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|accessdate=25 July 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = NIH2017&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/childbirth-and-beyond/newborn-care-and-safety|title=Newborn care and safety - womenshealth.gov|website=womenshealth.gov}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young boys may experience a genital injury if the [[toilet seat]] falls down while they are standing at a toilet.&lt;ref name="genitalinjury"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000044.htm|title=Genital injury|work=MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|accessdate=2005-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Injuries to adults include bruised buttocks, tail bones, and dislocated hips from unsuspectingly sitting on the toilet bowl rim because the seat is up or loose. Injuries can also be caused by pinching due to splits in plastic seats or by splinters from wooden seats, or if the toilet itself collapses under the weight of the user. Peculiar cases involving teenagers drowning in the toilet bowl whilst attempting to drink the water have also been recently increasing, most famously the 17 year old boy, Kaustubh Kaushal, who fell asleep while attempting to drink water from a toilet bowl in Central Park II, Gurgaon, India. Older high tank cast iron cisterns have been known to detach from the wall when the chain is pulled to flush, causing injuries to the user. The 2000 [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in Public Health was awarded to three physicians from the [[Glasgow]] [[Western Infirmary]] for a 1993 case report on wounds sustained to the [[buttocks]] due to collapsing toilets.&lt;ref name="collapsing"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wyatt JP, McNaughton GW, Tullett WM|title=The collapse of toilets in Glasgow|journal=Scottish Medical Journal|date=December 1993 |volume=38|issue=6|pages=185 | pmid=8146638}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, injuries are frequently sustained by people who stand on toilet seats to reach a height, and slip. There are also instances of people slipping on a wet bathroom floor or from a bath and concussing themselves on the fixture.

Toilet related injuries are also surprisingly common, with some estimates ranging up to 40,000 injuries in the US every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 40,000 toilet-related injuries in the US, Every Year|url = http://factspy.net/40000-toilet-related-injuries-in-the-us-every-year/|website = FactSpy.net|accessdate = 2015-10-25|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, this number would have been much higher, due to the material from which toilet paper was made. This was shown in a 1935 Northern Tissue advertisement which depicted splinter-free toilet paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = History of Toilet Paper|url = http://nobodys-perfect.com/vtpm/exhibithall/informational/tphistory.html|website = nobodys-perfect.com|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, 2.3 million toilets in the United States, and about 9,400 in Canada, were recalled due to faulty pressure-assist flush mechanisms which put users at risk of the fixture exploding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Recalls/2012/Flushmate-Recalls-Flushmate-III-Pressure-Assisted-Flushing-System-Due-to-Impact-and-Laceration-Hazards/|title=Consumer Product Safety Commission News Release: Flushmate Recalls Flushmate® III Pressure-Assisted Flushing System Due to Impact and Laceration Hazards|date=June 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Injuries caused by animals==
There are also injuries caused by animals. Some [[Latrodectus|black widow spiders]] like to spin their web below the toilet seat because insects abound in and around it. Therefore, several persons have been bitten while using a toilet, particularly an outhouse toilet.  Although there is immediate pain at the bite site, these bites are rarely fatal.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Raymond W. Thorp and Weldon Dwight Woodson, ''Black Widow: America's Most Poisonous Spider'' (The University of North Carolina Press, 1945), p.65, 156, 188. "Yikes! Black widow spider bites man right were it hurts." ''Weekly World News'', November 7, 1989. James A. Wilkerson, "Black Widow Spider Bites." In ''Medicine for Mountaineering &amp; Other Wilderness Activities'' (2001), p.298.&lt;/ref&gt; The danger of spiders living beneath toilet seats is the subject of [[Slim Newton]]'s comic 1972 country song ''[[The Redback on the Toilet Seat]]''.

It has been reported that in some cases [[rat]]s crawl up through toilet sewer pipes and emerge in the toilet bowl, so that toilet users may be at risk of being bitten by a rat.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/topstories/2132678.woman_on_toilet_attacked_by_rat/ Woman on toilet attacked by rat] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705095034/http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/topstories/2132678.woman_on_toilet_attacked_by_rat/ |date=2010-07-05 }}; [http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/wacky/rogue-rats-savage-woman-on-toilet/story-e6frev20-1111115853319 Rogue rats savage woman on toilet]&lt;sup&gt;[dead link]&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many rat exterminators do not believe this, as pipes, at generally six inches (15 centimeters) wide, are too large for rats to climb and are also very slippery.  Reports by janitors are always on the top floor, and could involve the rats on the roof, entering the soil pipe through the roof vent, lowering themselves into the pipe and then into the toilet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Straight Dope: Can rats swim up through the (urk) toilet?|url = http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/29/can-rats-swim-up-through-the-urk-toilet|website = www.straightdope.com|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, an 11&amp;nbsp;ft snake, a [[reticulated python]], emerged from a [[squat toilet]] and bit the man using it on his [[human penis|penis]] at his home in [[Chachoengsao Province]], [[Thailand]]. Both victim and python survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cowen|first1=Trace William|title=Python Chomps Down on Dude's Penis While He Uses Toilet|url=http://uk.complex.com/life/2016/05/python-chomps-down-man-penis-toilet|publisher=Complex Media Inc.|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Python in Thai toilet gives man nasty shock|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-36394819|website=BBC News|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-induced injury==
Some instances of toilet-related deaths are attributed to the drop in blood pressure due to the [[parasympathetic nervous system]] during bowel movements. This effect may be magnified by existing circulatory issues. It is further possible that people succumb on the toilet to chronic constipation, because the [[Valsalva maneuver]] is often dangerously used to aid in the expulsion of feces from the rectum during a bowel movement. According to Sharon Mantik Lewis, Margaret McLean Heitkemper and Shannon Ruff Dirksen, the "Valsalva maneuver … occurs during straining to pass a hardened stool. If defecation is suppressed over long periods, problems can occur, such as constipation or stool impaction. Defecation can be facilitated by the Valsalva maneuver. This maneuver involves contraction of the chest muscles on a closed glottis with simultaneous contraction of the abdominal muscles."&lt;ref&gt;See Sharon Mantik Lewis, Margaret McLean Heitkemper, Shannon Ruff Dirksen, eds., ''Medical-Surgical Nursing: Assessment and Management of Clinical Problems'', 6th edition, Volume 2 (2004), p.951.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that people can die while "straining at stool." In chapter 8 of their ''Abdominal Emergencies'', David Cline and Latha Stead wrote that "autopsy studies continue to reveal missed bowel obstruction as an unexpected cause of death".&lt;ref&gt;David Cline and Latha Stead, ''Abdominal Emergencies'' (2007), p.56-65&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2001 ''[[The Sopranos|Sopranos]]'' episode "[[He Is Risen (The Sopranos)|He is Risen]]" shows a fictional depiction of the risk, when the character [[Gigi Cestone]] has a heart attack on the toilet of his social club while straining to defecate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/the-sopranos/episodes/3/34-he-is-risen/synopsis.html|title=The Sopranos Episode 34 He is Risen Synopsis|last=|first=|date=|website=HBO|publisher=|access-date=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exploding toilets==
In the [[Victorian era]], there was a perceived risk of toilets exploding. These scenarios typically include a flammable substance either accidentally or deliberately being introduced into the toilet water, and a lit match or cigarette igniting and exploding the toilet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25259505|title=10 dangerous things in Victorian/Edwardian homes|work=BBC News|date=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, Sloan's Flushmate pressure-assisted flushing system which uses compressed air to force waste down the drain was recalled after the company received reports of the air tank failing under pressure and shattering the porcelain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/toilet-part-sold-at-home-depot-lowes-recalled-over-bursting-reports/|title=Exploding toilets spark recall of flushing system|work=CBS News|date=24 January 2014|accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical deaths==
In 1945, the [[German submarine U-1206]] was sunk after a toilet malfunctioned, resulting in seawater flooding into the hull, which when coming into contact with a battery, created chlorine gas, forcing the submarine to resurface.  At the surface, it was discovered and sunk by Allied Forces.  This case may not be due to toilet malfunction, due to the possibility that the pressurized flushing system in the U-Boats, which was incredibly complex and required a training course to operate, may not have been properly operated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = QI : Quite Interesting|url = http://qi.com/infocloud/submarines|website = qi.com|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Godfrey the Hunchback]], Duke of Lower Lorraine (an area roughly coinciding with the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]) was murdered in 1069 when staying in the Dutch city of [[Vlaardingen]]. Supposedly, the assassin made sure which of the latrines, which were built and drained on the outer side of the wall, according to medieval building style, belonged to the duke's sleeping room, and took a position underneath. Some sources say that a sword was used for the assassination; others mention a sharp iron weapon, which could have been a sword but also a spear or a dagger, but a spear seems to be the most practical choice. After being stabbed in the bottom it took him several days to die. The assassination was ordered by [[Dirk V]] Count of [[Holland]] and his ally [[Robert I, Count of Flanders|Robrecht the Frisian]], Count of [[Flanders]].&lt;ref&gt;The Assassination of Godfrey the Hunchback: http://www.keesn.nl/murder/text_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

King [[Wenceslaus III of Bohemia]] was murdered with a spear while sitting in the [[garderobe]] on August 4, 1306.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Edmund Maurice, ''The Story of Bohemia from the Earliest Times to the Fall of National Independence in 1620'' (1896), p.117&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George II of Great Britain]] died on the toilet on October 25, 1760 from an [[aortic dissection]]. According to [[Horace Walpole]]'s memoirs, King George "rose as usual at six, and drank his chocolate; for all his actions were invariably methodic. A quarter after seven he went into a little closet. His German ''valet de chambre'' in waiting heard a noise, and running in, found the King dead on the floor." In falling he had cut his face.&lt;ref&gt;Horace Walpole, ''Memoires of the Last Ten Years of the Reign of George the Second'' (1822), vol. 2, p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ioan P. Culianu]] was shot dead while on the toilet in the third-floor men's room of Swift Hall on the campus of the [[University of Chicago]] on 21 May 1991, in a possibly politically-motivated assassination. His killer has never been caught.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Anton, ''Eros, Magic, and the Murder of Professor Culianu''&lt;/ref&gt;

There can be no doubt that the King of Rock and Roll, [[Elvis Presley]], died when using the toilet.&lt;ref&gt;"Elvis died on the toilet", says Greil Marcus, ''Dead Elvis: A Chronicle of a Cultural Obsession'' (Harvard University Press 1991), p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; "Most sources indicate that Elvis was likely sitting in the toilet area, partially nude, and reading when he collapsed."&lt;ref&gt;Joshua A. Perper and Stephen J. Cina, ''When Doctors Kill: Who, Why, and How'' (Springer Science 2010), p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dylan Jones, "Elvis Presley died aged fortytwo on August 16th, 1977, in the bathroom of the star's own Graceland mansion in Memphis. Sitting on the toilet, he had toppled like a toy soldier and collapsed onto the floor, where he lay in a pool of his own vomit. His light blue pyjamas were around his ankles."&lt;ref&gt;Dylan Jones, ''Elvis Has Left the Building: The Day the King Died'' (New York and London 2014), chapter 2: The Day Elvis Died.&lt;/ref&gt; In similar terms, Elvis biographer Joel Williamson writes, "For some reason — perhaps involving a reaction to the codeine and attempts to move his bowels — he experienced pain and fright while sitting on the toilet. Alarmed, he stood up, dropped the book he was reading, stumbled forward, and fell face down in the fetal position. He struggled weakly and drooled on the rug. Unable to breathe, he died."&lt;ref&gt;Joel Williamson, ''Elvis Presley: A Southern Life'' (Oxford University Press 2014), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the common saying, “The King died on the throne”.&lt;ref&gt;John Voelz, ''King Me'' (Littleton, CO 2010) writes, p. 10, "I was a kid when The King died on his throne. On August 16th, 1977, Elvis Presley died in his Graceland mansion. On the toilet. Well, on the floor. After he fell off the toilet. Not a very 'kingly' way to go."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|the song "Turn a Blind Eye" by Half Man Half Biscuit|Four Lads Who Shook the Wirral}}
{{contradict-other|Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|date=September 2014}}
'''Turning a blind eye''' is an [[idiom]] describing the ignoring of undesirable information.

The phrase ''to turn a blind eye'' is attributed to an incident in the life of [[Admiral]] [[Horatio Nelson]].  Nelson was blinded in one eye early in his [[Royal Navy]] career.  During the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|Battle of Copenhagen]] in 1801 the cautious Admiral [[Hyde Parker (Royal Navy officer, born 1739)|Sir Hyde Parker]], in overall command of the [[United Kingdom|British]] forces, sent a signal to Nelson's forces ordering them to discontinue the action.  Naval orders were transmitted via a system of [[International maritime signal flags|signal flag]]s at that time.  When this order was brought to the more aggressive Nelson's attention, he lifted his telescope up to his blind eye, saying, "I have a right to be blind sometimes. I really do not see the signal," and most of his forces continued to press home the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Hibbert | first = Christopher |authorlink = Christopher Hibbert | title = Nelson A Personal History. | publisher = Basic Books | year = 1994 | page = 261 | isbn=0-201-40800-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Pocock | first = Tom | title = Horatio Nelson | publisher = The Bodley Head | location = London | year = 1987 |page = 237 | isbn=0-370-31124-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The frigates supporting the line-of-battle ships did break off, in one case suffering severe losses in the retreat.&lt;ref name="pope"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Pope | first = Dudley | title = The Great Gamble: Nelson at Copenhagen | publisher = Simon and Schuster | location = New York | year = 1972 |page = 576 | isbn=0-671-21404-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a misconception that the order was to be obeyed at Nelson's discretion, but this is contradicted by the fact that it was a general order to all the attacking ships (some of whom did break off), and that later that day Nelson openly stated that he had "fought contrary to orders". Sir Hyde Parker was recalled in disgrace and Nelson appointed Commander-in-Chief of the fleet following the battle.&lt;ref name ="pope" /&gt;

The Oxford English Dictionary records usage of the phrase as early as 1698.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. eye http://www.oed.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wereworms''' were  [[mythical]] creatures in [[Middle-earth]]. In the stories of [[hobbits]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Tolkien English Glossary A Guide to Old Uncommon and Archaic Words Used in the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9780557255788|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|date=December 2017}} the were-worms were supposedly terrible monsters that made their home in the Last Desert very [[Rhûn|far east]] of [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]].
In the tales of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the Wereworms were likened to [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|Dragons]]  and serpents. To Hobbits they were memories of creatures that stalked the Earth during the [[Wars of Beleriand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Tolkien: The Illustrated Encyclopaedia | publisher=Simon and Schuster | year=1991 | isbn=9780684839790|page=229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early drafts of the book, [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] had associated these wereworms with the [[Gobi Desert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Modern Folklore | author=Robert B Durham | isbn=9781312909694}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John D. Rateliff]]'s ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]'' links this reference to [[Mongolian death worm]]s.

==Adaptations==
These creatures appeared in ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]''. Apparently they were used only for tunnelling, and not for fighting, because they did not take part in the ensuing battle.
They were thought to have tunnelled through the [[Misty Mountains]] and the Blue Mountains ([[Ered Luin]]), although tunnelling is known to be mostly the work of [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]].

A '''widow''' is a woman whose [[spouse]] has [[Death|died]] and a '''widower''' is a man whose spouse has died.  The treatment of widows and widowers around the world varies.

== Terminology ==
A '''widow''' is a woman whose spouse has died, while a '''widower''' is a man whose spouse has died. The state of having lost one's [[spouse]] to death is termed ''widowhood''.&lt;ref name="merr_Defi"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Definition of WIDOWHOOD| work = Merriam-Webster| accessdate = 2016-03-18| url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/widowhood}}&lt;/ref&gt; These terms are not applied to a [[Divorce|divorcé(e)]] following the death of an ex-spouse.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The term ''widowhood'' can be used for either sex, at least according to some dictionaries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/widowhood|title=Widowhood definition and meaning - Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/widowhood?view=uk|title=widowhood - definition of widowhood in English - Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the word ''widowerhood'' is also listed in some dictionaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/widowerhood|title=Widowerhood definition and meaning - Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/widowerhood|title=Definition of WIDOWERHOOD|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, the word ''viduity'' is used.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The adjective for either sex is ''widowed''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/widowed|title=Widowed definition and meaning - Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/widowed|title=widowed Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In societies where the husband is the sole provider, his death can leave his family destitute. The [[life expectancy|tendency for women generally to outlive]] men can compound this, as can men in many societies [[Age at first marriage|marrying women younger]] than themselves. In some [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] societies, widows may maintain [[economic independence]]. A woman would carry on her spouse's business and be accorded certain rights, such as entering [[guild]]s. More recently, widows of political figures have been among the first women elected to high office in many countries, such as [[Corazón Aquino]] or [[Isabel Martínez de Perón]].

In 19th-century Britain, widows had greater opportunity for social mobility than in many other societies. Along with the ability to ascend socio-economically, widows—who were "presumably celibate"—were much more able (and likely) to challenge conventional sexual behaviour than married women in their society.&lt;ref name="Hofland"&gt;Behrendt, Stephen C. "Women without Men: Barbara Hofland and the Economics of Widowhood."  Eighteenth Century Fiction 17.3 (2005): 481-508. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. 14 Sept. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some parts of Europe, including Russia, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Italy and Spain, widows used to wear black for the rest of their lives to signify their mourning, a practice that has since died out. Many immigrants from these cultures to the United States as recently as the 1970s have loosened this strict standard of dress to only two years of black garments{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}. However, [[Orthodox Christian]] immigrants may wear lifelong black in the United States to signify their widowhood and devotion to their deceased husband.

In other cultures, however, widowhood customs are stricter.  Often, women are required to remarry within the family of their late husband after a period of mourning.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} With the rise of [[HIV/AIDS]] levels of infection across the globe, rituals to which women are subjected in order to be "cleansed" or accepted into her new husband's home make her susceptible to the psychological adversities that may be involved as well as imposing health risks.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

It may be necessary for a woman to comply with the [[social custom]]s of her area because her fiscal stature depends on it, but this custom is also often abused by others as a way to keep money within the deceased spouse's family.&lt;ref name="Imagine"&gt;"Imagine...." Widows' Rights International. Web. 14 Sep 2010. &lt;http://www.widowsrights.org/index.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also uncommon for widows to challenge their treatment because they are often "unaware of their rights under the modern law…because of their low status, and lack of education or legal representation."&lt;ref name="World of Widows"&gt;Owen, Margaret. ''A World of Widows''. Illustrated. Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Zed Books, 1996. 181-183. eBook.&lt;/ref&gt; . Unequal benefits and treatment{{clarify|date=September 2016}} generally received by widows compared to those received by widowers globally{{examples|date=September 2016}} has spurred an interest in the issue by [[human rights activists]].&lt;ref name="World of Widows" /&gt;

As of 2004, women in United States who were "widowed at younger ages are at greatest risk for economic hardship." Similarly, married women who are in a financially unstable household are more likely to become widows "because of the strong relationship between mortality [of the male head] and wealth [of the household]."&lt;ref name="Imagine" /&gt; In underdeveloped and developing areas of the world, conditions for widows continue to be much more severe. However, the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women ("now ratified by 135 countries"), while slow, is working on proposals which will make certain types of discrimination and treatment of widows (such as violence and withholding property rights) illegal in the countries that have joined CEDAW.&lt;ref name="World of Widows" /&gt;

=== Effects of widowhood ===
The phenomenon that refers to the increased [[mortality rate]] after the death of a spouse is called the ''[[widowhood effect]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}.  It is “strongest during the first three months after a spouse's death, when they had a 66-percent increased chance of dying.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-widowhood-effect-idUSBRE9AD0VU20131114|title='Widowhood effect' strongest during first three months|date=14 November 2016|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2017|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most widows and widowers suffer from this effect during the first 3 months of their spouse's death, however they can also suffer from this effect later on in their life for much longer than 3 months.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} There remains controversy over whether women or men have worse effects from becoming widowed, and studies have attempted to make their case for which side is worse off, while other studies try to show that there are no true differences based on gender and other factors are responsible for any differences.&lt;ref&gt;Trivedi, J., Sareen, H., &amp; Dhyani, M. (2009). Psychological Aspects of 
Widowhood and Divorce. Mens Sana Monogr Mens Sana Monographs, 7(1), 37. doi:10.4103/0973-1229.40648&lt;/ref&gt;

A variable that is deemed important and relative to the effects of widowhood is the gender of the widow. Research has shown that the difference falls in the burden of care, expectations, and finally how the react after the spouse's death. For example, women carry more a burden than men and are less willing to want to go through this again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=AONE&amp;u=txshracd2488&amp;id=GALE%257CA380342155&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon&amp;userGroup=txshracd2488&amp;authCount=1|title=Gale - Enter Product Login|website=go.galegroup.com|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being widowed, however, men and women can react very differently and frequently have a change in lifestyle. A study has sought to show that women are more likely to yearn for their late husband if he were to be taken away suddenly. Men on the other hand tend to be more likely to long for their late wife if she were to die after suffering a long, terminal illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1037/0278-6133.22.5.513|pmid=14570535|title=The effects of widowhood on physical and mental health, health behaviors, and health outcomes: The Women's Health Initiative|journal=Health Psychology|volume=22|issue=5|pages=513|year=2003|last1=Wilcox|first1=Sara|last2=Evenson|first2=Kelly R.|last3=Aragaki|first3=Aaron|last4=Wassertheil-Smoller|first4=Sylvia|last5=Mouton|first5=Charles P.|last6=Loevinger|first6=Barbara Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another change that happens to most men is that their lifestyle habits become worse. For example, without a wife there, he is probably more likely to not watch what he eats like he would if she were there. Instead of having to make something himself, it is more of a convenience just to order take-out. Women do have a change in lifestyle, but they typically don’t have the problem of eating foods that are bad for her. Instead, women are typically more known to lose weight due to lack of eating. This is likely to be caused as a side effect of depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0278-6133.22.5.513|pmid=14570535|title=The effects of widowhood on physical and mental health, health behaviors, and health outcomes: The Women's Health Initiative|journal=Health Psychology|volume=22|issue=5|pages=513|year=2003|last1=Wilcox|first1=Sara|last2=Evenson|first2=Kelly R.|last3=Aragaki|first3=Aaron|last4=Wassertheil-Smoller|first4=Sylvia|last5=Mouton|first5=Charles P.|last6=Loevinger|first6=Barbara Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The older spouses grow, the more aware they are of being alone due to the death of their husband or wife. This negatively impacts the mental as well as physical well being in both men and women (Utz, Reidy, Carr, Nesse, &amp; Wortman, 2004 as Cited in  Mumtaz 71).

==Superstitious beliefs against widows==
{{Seealso|Sexual cleansing#Widow cleansing|l2=Widow cleansing}}

In parts of Africa, such as in Kenya, widows are viewed as impure and need to be 'cleansed'. This often requires having sex with someone. Those refusing to be cleansed risk getting beaten by superstitious villagers, who may also harm the woman's children. It is argued that this notion arose from the idea that if a husband dies, the woman may have performed witchcraft against him. 

In parts of India and Nepal a woman is often accused of causing her husband’s death and is not allowed to look at another person as her gaze is considered bad luck.&lt;ref name=pri&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-10-23/these-kenyan-widows-are-fighting-against-sexual-cleansing|title=These Kenyan widows are fighting against sexual 'cleansing'|publisher=pri.org|accessdate=7 November 2018|date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those likely to be accused and killed as [[Modern witch-hunts|witche]]s, such as in [[Modern witch-hunts#Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]], are often widows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21725040-law-criminalising-sorcery-was-only-repealed-2013-gruesome-fate-witches-papua-new|title=The gruesome fate of “witches” in Papua New Guinea|publisher=economist.com |date=13 July 2017 |accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Classic and contemporary social customs ==

===Widow inheritence===
{{Main|Widow inheritance}}
Widow inheritance (also known as bride inheritance) is a cultural and social practice whereby a widow is required to marry a male relative of her late husband, often his brother.

===Hinduism===

Until the early 19th century it was considered honourable in some parts of India for a Hindu widow to immolate herself on her late husband's funeral pyre. This custom, called [[sati (practice)|sati]], was outlawed in 1827 in British India and again in 1987 in independent India by the [[Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987|Sati Prevention Act]], which made it illegal to support, glorify or attempt to commit sati. Support of sati, including coercing or forcing someone to commit sati, can be punished by death sentence or life imprisonment, while glorifying sati is punishable with one to seven years in prison.

Even if they did not commit suicide, Hindu widows were traditionally prohibited from remarrying. The Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act of 1856, enacted in response to the campaign of the reformer Pandit [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]],&lt;ref name="ForbesForbes1999"&gt;{{Harvnb|Forbes|1999|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; legalized widow remarriage and provided legal safeguards against loss of certain forms of inheritance for remarrying a Hindu widow,&lt;ref name=peers-2006-pp52-53&gt;{{Harvnb|Peers|2006|pp=52&amp;ndash;53}}&lt;/ref&gt; though, under the Act, the widow forsook any inheritance due her from her deceased husband.&lt;ref name=carroll-2008-p80&gt;{{Harvnb|Carroll|2008|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The status of widowhood for Hindus was accompanied by a body symbolism:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Many Colors of Hinduism|last=Olson|first=Carl|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The widow's head was shaved as part of her mourning.
* She could no longer wear a red dot (sindur) on her forehead and was forbidden to wear wedding jewellery.
* She was expected to walk barefoot.

But now, these customs are disappearing.

===Joseon Korea===
Social stigma in [[Joseon]] Korea required that widows remain unmarried after their husbands death. In 1477, [[Seongjong of Joseon]] enacted the Widow Remarriage Law, which strengthened pre-exisiting social constraints by barring the sons of widows who remarried from holding public office.&lt;ref name=uhn&gt;{{cite article|title=The Invention of Chaste Motherhood: A Feminist Reading of the Remarriage Ban in the Chosun Era|last1=Uhn |first1=Cho|journal=Asian Journal of Women's Studies|volume=5 |issue=3|pages=45-63|doi=10.1080/12259276.1999.11665854}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1489, Seongjong condemned a woman of the royal clan, [[Yi Guji]], when it was discovered that she had cohabited with her slave after being widowed. More than 40 members of her household were arrested and her lover was tortured to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=성종실록 (成宗實錄) |trans-title=Veritable Records of Seongjong|language=Classical Chinese|date=1499|volume=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Wraeththu appeared amid humanity's downfall. Humans viewed them as nothing more than aggravating street [[gang]]s recruiting young men and inhabiting cities of North America (always called Megalithica in this story as old "human" place names are never used). The Wraeththu, however, are a new [[species]], born from a [[mutation]] of unknown origin; Constantine implies an apocalypse, but the history is mysterious. They are destined to take over the mantle of rulers of the Earth. Their bodies fought off the environmental damage wreaked by human war and pollution well - much better than the human population they are swiftly replacing.

The first Wraeththu ''har'' (pl. ''hara'') infected a human male with his blood and thus transformed the man into Wraeththu. The species spread via a blood-sharing procedure that came to be known as ''inception''. Gangs of hara became [[tribe]]s, which eventually began a war against humanity that resulted in Wraeththu's supremacy. Many human males and all human females die during inception, with the exception of the rare few which later became the sister race of Wraeththu, the Kamagrian. Late in the story, there are Wraeththu communities where the human community is protected, and human males are incepted after fathering a human child.

Wraeththu are true hermaphrodites, possessing both male and female sexual organs and appearing [[Androgyny|androgynous]] in general outward appearance. Although they appear superficially as a mix between men and women (no breasts, slim hips, but feminine body structure with no body hair or facial hair), there are numerous physical and mental differences between hara and humans ("We fight like men, and cry like women"). One of the biggest differences is in the genitalia and reproductive organs. Unlike humans, all hara have genitals that are simultaneously both male and female (described as "colorful" and "flower-like" and "like a sea-anemone"), able to fold flat and open or retract inwards or protrude, and thus reproduce and experience sex differently. Hara have different bodily processes in other areas too, including more efficient digestion, better regulation of metabolism or perhaps faster metabolism (they cannot grow fat), and better resistance to toxins, including alcohol, drugs, and poisons. Hara also have a much stronger ability to access and manifest magical abilities, such as [[telepathy]], healing, [[psychokinesis]], etc.

One additional notable characteristic of Wraeththu is their need for regular hermaphrodite sex, known among Wraeththu as ''aruna''. Hara who are deprived of aruna suffer, as their bodies require exchange of essential life essences in order to run properly. Wraeththu even use aruna in magic, performing the ritual of sex magic, ''grissecon'', in which aruna is used to work great acts of healing or the creation of magical weapons.

In the early years, Wraeththu did not have knowledge of their own ability to reproduce. Hara are able to conceive during an unusual, elevated type of aruna, with conception taking place inside the ''Cauldron of Creation''. The ''harling'' gestates inside a ''pearl'' and is born after a period of about two and a half months. The pearl is a leathery egg where the harling continues to develop for one to two weeks, at which point it hatches. Harlings develop far more rapidly than human children and are fully grown and sexually mature by the age of seven or eight, at which point they undergo Wraeththu puberty, ''feybraiha'', and are introduced to aruna.

==Principal Wraeththu gods (Dehara)==
AGHAMA - The first Wraeththu, deified as progenitor of all Wraeththukind

*IRRAKA - Small disorganized band of hara living in the shadow of the Varrs.

*UNNEAH - The Unneah are an offshoot of the Uigenna, having shed their viciousness and replaced it with a search for knowledge and caste development. One of the earliest tribes of Megalithica.
*VARRS - Ferocious as the Uigenna, but much more organized and "civilized", they have conquered and subdued most of Megalithica.

== History in print ==

Wraeththu first appeared in print with ''The Enchantments of Flesh and Spirit'' (1987), followed by the next two ''Wraeththu Chronicles'' books, ''The Bewitchments of Love and Hate'' (1988) and ''The Fulfillments of Fate and Desire'' (1989). The ''Wraeththu Chronicles'' are first person narratives covering an important era in Wraeththu history; the narrators are Pellaz Cevarro (who eventually becomes a kind of king), Swift Parasiel (who grows up to be a tribal leader), and Calanthe (Pellaz' lover). Beginning in 2003, this trilogy of books was re-released in revised editions published by Constantine's publishing firm, [http://www.immanion-press.com Immanion Press]. In 2006 ''Enchantments'' appeared in an all-new German language edition, as ''Der Zauber von Fleisch und Geist'', published by German publisher [http://www.zauberfeder-verlag.de/ Zauberfeder Verlag].

In 2004, a new trilogy, the ''Wraeththu Histories'', launched with ''The Wraiths of Will and Pleasure'', followed by ''The Shades of Time and Memory'' (2005) and ''The Ghosts of Blood and Innocence'' (2006). These books continue the original trilogy but have a different tone, with third-person narration, a more complex [[narrative structure]], and more concrete details on Wraeththu's abilities and origins.

Wraeththu have also appeared outside the six-book series. In 2003, Immanion Press published the first "Wraeththu Mythos" book, ''Breeding Discontent'', written by two fans (Wendy Darling and Bridgette Parker) and edited by Constantine herself. In 2005, Constantine released a new Wraeththu [[novella]] called ''The Hienama: A Story of the Sulh'', separate from the storylines of the two trilogies. The book follows the story of a member of the Sulh tribe who seeks a hienama, or Wraeththu [[shaman]], for training, and gets more deeply entangled in his education than he expected. In the summer of 2005, Immanion Press published another Wraeththu Mythos novel, ''Terzah's Sons'' by Victoria Copus.  A loose sequel to ''The Hienama'' called ''A Student of Kyme'' written by Constantine was expected out in 2008, along with a lengthy Wraeththu Mythos novel, ''Rosa Mundi'' by Kris Dotto.

Wraeththu have also appeared in several of Constantine's short stories, published in magazines or anthologies. Of these short stories, most notable is "Paragenesis" describing in poignant details the very beginnings of Wraeththu, featuring Thiede, the first har, his sad infancy, his flight from home and how he discovered love and loss before giving rise to the new race. There is a Wraeththu fan fiction community, which exists primarily online; in 2003 a series of fan-written short stories was self-published by fans in a booklet titled ''[http://www.angelfire.com/ca6/forever/wots.html Writers of the Storm]''.

In 2005, the German publishing firm Zauberfeder Verlag published ''Wraeththu: The Picture Book'', a full-color album showing off the work of photographer Marja Kettner and a group of German fans who designed costumes, jewellery, and makeup to create a pictorial vision of the world of Wraeththu. Almost all the models are male; many of these same models also participated in the LARP described elsewhere in this article. Information on the book is available [http://www.larpzeit.de/Wraeththu-Photobook/wraeththu-photobook.html in German] and [http://www.inception-magazine.com/picturebook/ in English].

== History in gaming ==

Wraeththu are the subject of a [[role-playing game]], ''From Enchantment to Fulfilment'', released in 2005 by Immanion Press [http://www.immanion-press.com]. Reviews for the game were overwhelmingly negative [http://jrients.blogspot.com/2005/07/wraeththu-report.html][http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=208403][http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=244590].

In December 2004, a [[live action role-playing game|live action role-playing (LARP) game]] in Germany featured the first-ever Wraeththu LARP group. Information on this event can be found on the [http://www.metrogirl.com/wraeththu-seven-sins/ Seven Deadly Sins - Wraeththu] web site. Later, many of the players appeared in ''Wraeththu: The Picture Book''.

On July 31 and August 1, 2004, a Wraeththu [[paintball]] event was in the USA at Realms of Ruin paintball field, [[Wilmington, Will County, Illinois]] (near Chicago).

== Fan community ==

Wraeththu has had a cult following since the late 80s when the series first appeared. The [[fandom]] is especially strong among the [[Goth subculture]], although in recent years fans of [[slash fiction]], [[anime]], and [[manga]] have also gravitated toward Wraeththu. Constantine not only allows but fully supports [[fan fiction]], to the delight of fans who have written and published many stories online, most of them hosted on the [http://foreverwraeththu.wordpress.com Forever Wraeththu] web site.

Wraeththu have also inspired fan art, poetry, and several online communities and/or mailing lists. See the list of links at the end of this article.

In 2003, a convention called Grissecon, held in [[Stafford]], England, was the first-ever Wraeththu fan gathering. Since then additional Grissecon events have been held as part of [[Lunacon]] (2004 &amp; 2005), [[DragonCon]] (2004) and [http://www.feencon.de Feencon] (2005).

== Spiritual aspects ==

In 2005, Constantine released ''Grimoire Dehara: Kaimana''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.immanion-press.com/info/book.asp?id=315 Grimoire Dehara: Kaimana CE hbk, Storm Constantine - Catalogue&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; a non fictional exploration of the Wraeththu spirituality.  Heavily based in [[Paganism]] and [[Chaos magic|Chaos Magick]], the Grimoire became a new "pop spirituality" for many of the fans of the Mythos.  Combining elements of paganism (Constantine's experience in the Occult is heavily based on Egyptian Mythology) and the [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] concepts of Anima and Animus (The Secret Marriage of the Psyche), the Grimoire attempts to blend the earth based reverence of the Dehara (gods of the Wraeththu) and Awareness of Self, through visualisation, giving a framework to the Practitioner for the exploration of this spiritual way.

Several discussion groups on Yahoo and the community on LiveJournal were utilised for the Grimoire project. In 2007 a community of Spiritual Wraeththu arose inside the virtual world of Second Life using the Grimoire as the basis for their study and practice.  This community was officially recognised by Constantine and continues to practice and teach there as of May 2011.

As of June 2010, work has started on the second book of the Grimoire series, ''Grimoire Dehara: Ulani'', utilizing the same group/community structure as ''Grimoire Dehara: Kaimana'' at [http://nayatidehara.shivtr.com/ Nayati Dehara].

==Screen adaptation==

Brad Carpenter was supposed to develop a new sci fi/fantasy series called ''Raythu'', based on the novel series ''The Wraeththu Chronicles'' by Storm Constantine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stage32.com/profile/7069/brad-carpenter Brad Carpenter: Producer and screenwriter in N… - Stage 32&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stage32.com/profile/7069/project/raythu "raythu" - a job post by Brad Carpenter - Stage 32&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
