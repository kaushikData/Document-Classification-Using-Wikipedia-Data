{{Falklands War}}

On 6 June 1982, during the [[Falklands War]], the British Royal Navy Type 42 destroyer {{HMS|Cardiff|D108|6}} engaged and destroyed a British Army Gazelle helicopter, [[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|serial number]] ''XX377'', in a [[friendly fire]] incident, killing all four occupants. ''Cardiff'', on the lookout for aircraft flying supplies to the Argentine forces occupying the [[Falkland Islands]], had misidentified the helicopter as an enemy [[C-130 Hercules]]. Although the helicopter's loss was initially blamed on enemy action, a subsequent inquiry found ''Cardiff''{{'}}s missile to be the cause.

On the night of 5 June, HMS ''Cardiff'' was stationed to the east of the islands to provide gunfire support to the land forces and intercept enemy aircraft. At around 02:00 a radar contact was detected; a British [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]] [[Aérospatiale Gazelle|Gazelle]] helicopter was making a routine delivery of personnel and equipment to a radio rebroadcast station on [[East Falkland]]. From the contact's speed and course, ''Cardiff''{{'}}s operations room crew assumed it to be hostile.  One [[Sea Dart missile|Sea Dart]] missile was fired, destroying the target.&lt;ref name="Archives" /&gt; The Gazelle's wreckage and crew were discovered the next morning, and the loss was attributed to enemy fire. Although ''Cardiff'' was suspected, later scientific tests on the wreckage proved inconclusive.

No formal inquiry was held until four years later. Defending their claim that the helicopter had been lost in action, the United Kingdom's [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) stated that they had not wanted to "cause further anguish to relatives" while they were still trying to ascertain how the Gazelle had been shot down. The board of inquiry finally confirmed that the soldiers fell due to friendly fire. It recommended that "neither negligence nor blame should be attributed to any individual",&lt;ref name="MOD board of inquiry" /&gt; but identified several factors. A lack of communication between the army and the navy meant that [[5th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|5th Infantry Brigade]] had not notified anyone of the helicopter's flight. The navy had not informed the land forces that ''Cardiff'' had changed position to set up an ambush for Argentine aircraft travelling over the area. The helicopter's [[identification friend or foe]] (IFF) transmitter was turned off, because it caused interference with the army's [[Rapier (missile)|Rapier]] anti-aircraft missile system. The board of inquiry's findings prompted criticism of the MoD's initial response to the incident.

== Background ==

On 2 April 1982, the [[British overseas territory]] of the [[Falkland Islands]] was invaded by neighbouring Argentina.&lt;ref name="BBC introduction" /&gt; The United Kingdom, nearly {{convert|8000|mi|km}} away, assembled and dispatched [[Events leading to the Falklands War#Task force|a naval task force of 28,000&amp;nbsp;troops]] to recapture the islands.&lt;ref name="BBC introduction" /&gt;&lt;ref name="w8UiR" /&gt; The conflict ended that June with the [[Argentine surrender in the Falklands War|surrender of the Argentine forces]]; the battles fought on land, at sea, and in the air had cost the lives of some 900 British and Argentine servicemen.&lt;ref name="BBC introduction" /&gt;

In early May, British troops landed at [[San Carlos, Falkland Islands|San Carlos]] on the western side of [[East Falkland]], and from there moved overland towards the islands' capital of [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]]. To support the advance, logistical supplies were ferried to the troops by helicopter from San Carlos.&lt;ref name="MOD board of inquiry" /&gt; The Argentine forces occupying Stanley were supplied throughout the war by [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules]] aircraft from the Argentine mainland. These "milk-runs", as the British termed them, were a source of concern to the Royal Navy, and various attempts were made to intercept them.&lt;ref name="Ward" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hastings" /&gt;

== Incident ==

On the night of 5 June, the British Type 42 destroyer {{HMS|Cardiff|D108|6}} took up station on the "Bluff Cove Gunline" to the east of the islands. Tasked with a dual mission, ''Cardiff'' was to provide [[naval gunfire support|fire support]] to the Royal Marines of [[3 Commando Brigade]], and to interdict any Argentine aircraft attempting to fly into Stanley. The destroyer had performed a similar role four nights previously, when she unsuccessfully attempted to shoot down a re-supply aircraft as it landed, and again as it took off.&lt;ref name="L/Cpl. S. J. Cockton"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1987/feb/02/lcpl-s-j-cockton |title=L/Cpl. S. J. Cockton |work=[[Hansard]] |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom |date=2 February 1987 |accessdate=19 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Report of Proceedings" /&gt;

Meanwhile, pilots [[Staff Sergeant#United Kingdom|Staff Sergeant]] Christopher Griffin and [[Lance Corporal#United Kingdom|Lance Corporal]] Simon Cockton, of [[No. 656 Squadron AAC|656 Squadron]] Army Air Corps, had been ordered to fly equipment and personnel to a malfunctioning radio re-broadcast station on top of [[Pleasant Peak]].&lt;ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="forcesmemorial1093" /&gt;&lt;ref name="forcesmemorial552" /&gt; The station had been established the previous day to provide a communications link between the [[5th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|5th Infantry Brigade]] headquarters at [[Darwin, Falkland Islands|Darwin]], and the [[2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment]] at [[Fitzroy, Falkland Islands|Fitzroy]].&lt;ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)" /&gt; Night flying conditions were excellent, with a clear sky, a prominent moon and a wind speed of {{convert|20|kn|km/h|abbr=on|lk=in}}.&lt;ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)" /&gt; The crew departed from [[Goose Green]] in Gazelle [[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|serial number]] ''XX377'' and collected the replacement equipment from the headquarters at Darwin. They also took on board two passengers; [[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]] Michael Forge, the [[Officer Commanding|OC]] of [[205 Signal Squadron]], and A Tp Staff Sergeant, Staff Sergeant John Baker.&lt;ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="forcesmemorial79" /&gt;&lt;ref name="forcesmemorial942" /&gt; Griffin was an experienced pilot; the flight to the re-broadcast station was expected to take ten minutes.&lt;ref name="MOD board of inquiry" /&gt;

[[File:HMS Cardiff (D108) Operations Room.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|alt=A sailor in a blue shirt sits at a console, it has a large circular screen and switches.|Cardiff's [[surface plot]] console]]&lt;!-- Image not flipped to "face" text as per [[MOS:IMAGES]]; "images should not be reversed simply to resolve a conflict between these guidelines" --&gt;

At 02:00 local time&lt;!-- or 04:00 Zulu/UTC --&gt;, ''Cardiff''{{'}}s [[operations room]] detected ''XX377'' on her [[surface plot]] radar at a range of {{convert|25|nmi|km|lk=in}}.&lt;ref name="MOD board of inquiry" /&gt; The helicopter's [[identification friend or foe]] (IFF) system was turned off, so receiving no friendly transmissions and with the contact apparently heading towards Stanley, the operations room crew assumed it to be hostile.&lt;ref name="MOD board of inquiry" /&gt; After calculating its speed they believed they were tracking an Argentine [[fixed-wing aircraft]]—either a Hercules conducting a resupply mission, or a [[FMA IA 58 Pucará]] ground-attack aircraft sent to retaliate for ''Cardiff''{{'}}s shelling.&lt;ref name="MOD board of inquiry" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="usacac" /&gt; ''Cardiff'' fired one of her [[Sea Dart missile]]s.&lt;ref name="Archives" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Report of Proceedings" /&gt; 5th Infantry Brigade lost radio contact with the Gazelle, and simultaneously the exploding missile was seen and heard by the re-broadcast station's personnel atop Pleasant Peak.&lt;ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)" /&gt; ''Cardiff''{{'}}s crew were able to see the fireball, but only with the aid of [[night vision goggles]].

The helicopter's loss caused the British to suspect that Argentine forces were still operating in the area, so patrols were mounted by [[Brigade of Gurkhas|Gurkha]] soldiers.&lt;ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)" /&gt; When the Gurkhas came across the personnel manning the Pleasant Peak station there was potential for another friendly fire incident to occur.&lt;ref name="Freedman" /&gt; At first light a proper search was carried out, and the Gazelle's wreckage was found along with the dead aircrew and passengers; 5th Infantry Brigade's first casualties of the war.&lt;ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Freedman_819" /&gt; Immediately there were suspicions that ''Cardiff'' had been responsible for the shootdown, and later that evening Rear Admiral [[Sandy Woodward|"Sandy" Woodward]] declared a "[[Weapons Tight]]" order, forbidding the engagement of any aircraft not positively identified as hostile, for all contacts detected flying over East Falkland at less than {{convert|200|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} and under {{convert|610|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="MOD board of inquiry" /&gt;&lt;ref name="L/Cpl. S. J. Cockton"/&gt;

== Investigations ==

The crew's bodies were initially examined by senior [[Physician|medical officer]], [[Rick Jolly|Surgeon-Captain Richard "Rick" Jolly]] of the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref name="Rick Jolly" /&gt; The helicopter's wreckage was inspected on-site, but the British were unable to determine if it had been destroyed by ''Cardiff''{{'}}s missiles or by Argentine fire. This uncertainty prompted the decision not to hold a board of inquiry, and ''XX377'' was declared "lost in action". It was surmised that, if the relatives of the deceased were told that the Gazelle might have been lost to [[friendly fire]], it would add to their grief.&lt;ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)" /&gt; After the war, missile fragments found in the wreckage were taken to the British government's aviation research facility at [[Royal Aircraft Establishment|RAE]] [[Farnborough Airport|Farnborough]] for analysis. The scientific tests concluded that the fragments were not from a British Sea Dart missile, despite a Sea Dart casing later being found "several hundred yards" away from the wreckage.&lt;ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)" /&gt;

In December 1982 an inquest was held by a [[Southampton]] coroner into the death of Lance Corporal Cockton after his body was repatriated to the UK. Based on RAE Farnborough's test results, the Army Air Corps submitted evidence stating that the analysis of the warhead fragments found in the wreckage indicated that the helicopter had been destroyed by a type of anti-aircraft missile "known to have been in the possession of the enemy".&lt;ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)" /&gt; The test results were reviewed in November 1985 and determined that there could be "no definitive conclusion as to the exact source of the missile fragments recovered from the crash site".&lt;ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)" /&gt; In June 1986, [[John Stanley (MP for Tonbridge and Malling)|John Stanley]], the [[Minister of State for the Armed Forces]], announced in his written answers to the House of Commons: "the [Southampton] coroner has been informed accordingly."&lt;ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)" /&gt;

In October 1986, partly due to pressure from Cockton's mother and the anti-war politician [[Tam Dalyell]], an official board of inquiry was finally opened.&lt;ref name="Rick Jolly" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MOD Memo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="millbanksystems375" /&gt;&lt;ref name="millbanksystems288" /&gt;&lt;ref name="millbanksystems247" /&gt;&lt;ref name="millbanksystems385" /&gt; The board took a month to reach the conclusion that ''XX377'' was shot down by ''Cardiff''.&lt;ref name="MOD board of inquiry" /&gt; Historian [[Hugh Bicheno]] remarks: "It took [the] MoD four years and two investigations, the first either incompetent or a deliberate cover-up, even to admit the Gazelle [[friendly fire|blue-on-blue]]."&lt;ref name="Bicheno" /&gt; The board's findings were made public by a [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] request in July 2008, although Paragraph 13 of the report was [[Sanitization (classified information)|redacted]] under Section 26 of the act as it "contains operational details of the Royal Navy's activities, which, even with the passage of time since the Falklands campaign, would be of use to potential enemies."&lt;ref name="Response" /&gt;

The board of inquiry found that standard operating procedure dictated that the commanders of 5th Infantry Brigade were not required to declare the helicopter's mission to any other authority, as the flight was to occur in brigade airspace on a brigade task.&lt;ref name="MOD board of inquiry" /&gt;&lt;ref name="L/Cpl. S. J. Cockton"/&gt; Gazelle ''XX377'' was equipped with an IFF transmitter, but this was turned off. In the opinion of the board, "had IFF been in use there is little doubt that Cardiff would not have engaged the aircraft that night."&lt;ref name="MOD board of inquiry" /&gt; At the time, less than half of the land force's helicopters were fitted with IFF transmitters, and those that were had been ordered not to use them because they inhibited&lt;!--interfered with? "inhibited" is the term used by the board of inquiry on Page 4, Paragraph 17 http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121026065214/http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/EF248AAE-5B25-4CB4-BE90-EE096980354B/0/boi_loss_gazellexx377.pdf--&gt; the tracking systems of the British ground-based [[Rapier (missile)|Rapier]] anti-aircraft missile batteries.&lt;ref name="MOD board of inquiry" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Falkland Islands (Gazelle Helicopter)" /&gt; A misconception about the Royal Navy's ability to engage air targets over land led to the navy not being informed that the army's helicopters were not using IFF. The board of inquiry concluded that it was this failure to communicate, together with the navy's assumption that all helicopters would be operating IFF, which "had a cumulative effect [and] was a major cause of [the] accident."&lt;ref name="MOD board of inquiry" /&gt; However, the board recommended that "neither negligence nor blame should be attributed to any individual".&lt;ref name="MOD board of inquiry" /&gt;

== Effects ==
[[File:XX377Memorial2.JPG|thumb|alt=A cross amongst rocks painted white and a mountain in the background|The memorial cross]]

Given that the role of helicopters in land force operations was increasing, as was the integration of [[guided missile destroyer]]s for coastal defence, the board of inquiry recommended an amendment to [[NATO]] procedures for [[amphibious warfare]] and [[naval gunfire support]], to alert other armed forces to the danger of underestimating a ship's missile engagement zone over land.&lt;ref name="MOD board of inquiry" /&gt; During the late 1980s, the British government placed more emphasis on [[joint warfare]] training, with exercises, such as [[Exercise Purple Warrior|Purple Warrior]], taking place in [[Oman]] and Scotland.&lt;ref name="MOD board of inquiry" /&gt;&lt;ref name="L/Cpl. S. J. Cockton"/&gt; The board noted the establishment of the [[Permanent Joint Headquarters]], designed to put an end to the "ad hoc and reactive way" in which operations had been carried out while under single service control.&lt;ref name="MOD board of inquiry" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Doctrine" /&gt; IFF transmitters were fitted to all Army Air Corps and Royal Marine Gazelle and [[Westland Lynx|Lynx]] helicopters,&lt;ref name="MOD board of inquiry" /&gt; and the problem of operating IFF in the vicinity of [[Rapier (missile)|Rapier]] batteries was successfully addressed.&lt;ref name="MOD board of inquiry" /&gt; The board supported a recommendation that the responsibilities of naval gunfire-support liaison officers could be broadened to include the interpretation of air defence problems during inshore joint warfare operations.&lt;ref name="MOD board of inquiry" /&gt;

A memorial cross was installed on Pleasant Peak, and the number "205" was painted at the crash site by the soldiers of 205 Signal Squadron.&lt;ref name="FallenComrades" /&gt; The number is approximately {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide and can be seen from the air ({{Coord|-51.783600|-58.467786}}).

'''''APSI''''' (an abbreviation of "Agencia Publicitaria de Servicios Informativos") was a Chilean [[magazine]] aimed as means of [[political opposition]] to the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|Pinochet dictatorship]]. It was headquartered in Santiago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/999608034802121|title=APSI : actualidad nacional e internacional|work=University of Madison Wisconsin Library|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=September 2018}}

== History ==

One of the tactics of the dictatorship was to isolate the public from international news and outside influences in order to maintain its stranglehold on information. Following the 1975 shutdown of the human rights organization {{ill|Comité Pro Paz|es}} in response to a political offensive by the Pinochet regime, Precht, then Vicar, allowed the ex-employees to issue grant requests to European commissions.  One of the European applications was a project to create a news agency about international news. This request by Arturo Navarro,&lt;!-- Not [[Arturo Navarro]], Spanish football player--&gt; an ex-Comité employee, resulted in a grant of seven thousand dollars, and APSI was born.&lt;ref name="Jofré-2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=Francisca Araya Jofré |title=Historia de la revista Apsi: el que se ríe se va al cuartel (pico para Pinochet) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IrRHQBZ31ysC&amp;pg=PA20 |series=Nuevo Periodismo |year=2007 |publisher=Lom Ediciones |location=Santiago |isbn=978-956-282-944-1 |oclc=1026152018 |pages=20&lt;!--to 24--&gt; |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

APSI was published on a weekly basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=David Remnick|title=To die in Chile|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/1986/11/23/to-die-in-chile/7b87938b-0ecf-4410-bbca-050e2f77c33a/|accessdate=15 November 2016|work=The Washington Post|date=23 November 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the climate of censorship in Chile the magazine focused initially on international news. ''APSI'' was published with support of the [[Popular Unitary Action Movement]] until late 1978. In 1979 the magazine begun reporting on local issues including the numerous human rights violations of the dictatorship.&lt;ref name=mem&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-96757.html|title=APSI|website=Memoria Chilena|publisher=Biblioteca Nacional de Chile|language=es|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231053749/http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-727.html|archivedate=31 December 2013|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Acedapsone''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) is an [[antimicrobial]] drug, which also has [[antimalarial]] activity.

Acedapsone, or 1399 F, is a diacetyl compound, derived from [[dapsone]]. It was synthesized and developed in 1937 by [[Ernest Fourneau]] and his team in the pharmaceutical chemistry laboratory of [[Pasteur Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} E. Fourneau, J. et Th. [[Jacques Tréfouël|Tréfouël]], [[Federico Nitti|F. Nitti]], [[Daniel Bovet|D. Bovet]], « Chimiothérapie de l'infection pneumococcique par la di-(p-acétylaminophényl)-sulfone (1399 F) », ''C. r. Acad. sci''., vol. 205, 1937, pp. 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was marketed as Rodilone by the [[Rhône-Poulenc]] company.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [[Marcel Delépine]], ''Ernest Fourneau (1872–1949) : Sa vie et son œuvre'', extrait du Bulletin de la Société chimique de France, Masson et Cie, 1950, pp.  64-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a long-acting [[prodrug]] of dapsone. It is used for treating [[leprosy]].&lt;ref name="pmid12862255"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shaw IN, Christian M, Jesudasan K, Kurian N, Rao GS |title=Effectiveness of multidrug therapy in multibacillary leprosy: a long-term follow-up of 34 multibacillary leprosy patients treated with multidrug regimens till skin smear negativity |journal=Lepr Rev |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=141–7 |date=June 2003 |pmid=12862255 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It crystallises as pale yellow needles from [[diethyl ether]], and as leaflets from dilute [[ethanol]]. It is slightly soluble in water.

[[Image:Bernbarengraben.jpg|thumb|right|Bears in the ''Bärengraben'' in [[Bern]] (Switzerland)]]
A '''bear pit''' was historically used to display [[bear]]s, typically for entertainment and especially [[bear-baiting]]. The pit area was normally surrounded by a high fence, above which the spectators would look down on the bears.

The most traditional form of maintaining [[bear]]s in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]] is keeping them in pits, although many zoos replaced these by more elaborate and spacious enclosures that attempt to replicate their natural [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]]s, for the benefit of the [[animal]]s and the visitors.

A noteworthy example is found in [[Bern]], [[Switzerland]]. Known as the ''[[Bärengraben]]'', it was built in 1857 and is still in use though much modified.

== Other meanings ==

Another meaning is for an unusually aggressive political arena, in which direct, heated attacks are common.&lt;ref name="BANKSHERALD"&gt;''[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10536851 What happened to bully Banks?]'' - ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Saturday 11 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A bear pit also refers to a type of trap used to deter or trap bears.  It usually consists of a large earthen pit with sharpened pikes in the bottom to impale the bear.  They are most often used to deter bears from approaching a cabin, rather than as a means of actually catching them.

The term "bear pit" is also used to describe a [[tournament]] or sparring format sometimes also referred to as "[[King of the Hill (game)|king of the hill]]". The participants form a queue behind the first two to compete. Once each match is over, the winner remains to face the next opponent in line while the loser goes to the end of the queue. For tournaments, it is usual that the process is continued for a set period of time during which the victor of each match is noted. At the end of the tournament the winner is determined to be the contestant that won the most matches. Multiple bear pits may also be employed, with defeated contestants able to choose which queue to re-enter.

In Scotland, the phrase "Bear pit" is used to describe bars or public houses that are known to have a violent reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dictionary of the Scots Language - Bearpit|url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/sndns275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bodelwyddan Castle''' ({{lang-cy|Castell Bodelwyddan}}) , close to the village of [[Bodelwyddan]], near [[Rhyl]], [[Denbighshire]] in [[Wales]], was built around 1460 by the Humphreys family of [[Anglesey]] as a [[manor house]]. Its most important association was with the [[Williams-Wynn baronets|Williams-Wynn]] family, which extended for around 200 years from 1690. It is now a Grade II* [[Listed Building]] and is open to the public as a [[historic house museum]].&lt;ref&gt;''Caring for Our Built Heritage: Conservation in Practice''; Tony Haskell, 1993, p.133&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Bodelwyddan house.jpg|thumb|Watercolour of the house that preceded Bodelwyddan Castle c1781]]
The [[castle]] was bought from the Humphreys by [[William Williams (speaker)|Sir William Williams]], [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] from 1680–1681.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.npg.org.uk/live/bodintro.asp| archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20010305204359/http://www.npg.org.uk/live/bodintro.asp| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2001-03-05| title=Bodelwyddan Castle Introduction| work=National Portrait Gallery| accessdate=2007-12-01}} &lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Bodelwyddan Castle2.jpg|thumb|left|Bodelwyddan Castle]] The castle which stands today was reconstructed between 1830 and 1832 by [[Sir John Hay Williams]], who employed the architects [[Joseph Hansom]] (inventor of the [[Hansom cab]]) and [[Edward Welch]] to refurbish and extend the house.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Penelope,''The Architectural Achievement of Joseph Aloysius Hansom (1803–1882)'', The Edwin Mellen Press, 2010, {{ISBN|0-7734-3851-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Williams' family fortunes started to decline in the 1850s, due to the loss of the main source of income for the estate, [[lead#Lead_mining_in_Wales|lead mining]].  The castle has been described as one of Hansom's most ambitious projects, "being wildly dramatic and owing nothing to its predecessors".&lt;ref name="Tony Haskell, Ibid., p.133"&gt;Tony Haskell, ''Ibid.'', p.133&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time works were carried out to construct an estate wall and formal gardens.

Further refurbishment work was carried out in the 1880s by [[Sir Herbert Williams-Wynn, 7th Baronet|Sir Herbert, 7th Baronet]], who inherited Bodelwyddan Castle from his heirless cousin.By the [[First World War]] the house had become a recuperation hospital for wounded soldiers. During this time, the grounds of the estate were used by soldiers based at the nearby [[Kinmel Camp]] for [[trench warfare]] training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bodelwyddan-castle.co.uk/ww1trenches.html |title=Trenches |work=Bodelwyddan Castle |accessdate=2007-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613163726/http://www.bodelwyddan-castle.co.uk/ww1trenches.html |archivedate=2010-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traces of these trenches can still be seen.

===Lowther College===
By 1920, the cost of maintaining the castle and estate had grown too burdensome, and the Williams-Wynn family leased Bodelwyddan to [[Lowther College]], a girls private school. The school was formed in 1896 at [[Lytham St. Annes]] in [[Lancashire]], by Mrs [[Florence Lindley|Florence Morris]] (later [[Florence Lindley|Lindley]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlw.org.uk/cgi-bin/anw/fulldesc_nofr?inst_id=28&amp;coll_id=2188&amp;expand= |title=Lowther College |work=Archives Network Wales |accessdate=2007-12-01 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lowther College purchased the property five years later, in 1925.&lt;ref name="Tony Haskell, Ibid., p.133"/&gt; The school is thought to be one of the first private schools for girls to have its own swimming pool. It also had a private golf course. The Lowther College Tableaux were well regarded within the community for their musical excellence. Boys were admitted from 1977. The school closed in 1982 due to financial problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodelwyddan-castle.co.uk/college.htm |title=Lowther College |work=Bodelwyddan Castle |accessdate=2007-12-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108180315/http://www.bodelwyddan-castle.co.uk/college.htm |archivedate=2007-11-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum and arts centre===
In the 1980s, the site was bought by [[Clwyd]] [[County Council]] with the aim of developing the castle as a visitor attraction. Partnerships were formed with the [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]] and the [[Royal Academy of Arts]], so that the castle could be used to display objects from these collections. In order to house these items, the interior of the castle was restored by [[Roderick Gradidge]], an expert on [[Victorian architecture]]. Part of the site was leased to the [[Rank Organisation]] in 1994 for development into a luxury hotel, Bodelwyddan Castle Hotel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodelwyddan-castle.co.uk/history.htm |title=History |work=Bodelwyddan Castle |accessdate=2007-12-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108180159/http://www.bodelwyddan-castle.co.uk/history.htm |archivedate=2007-11-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is now run by Warners, who are part of the [[Bourne Leisure]].  The historic house and grounds are not part of the hotel but are managed by '''Bodelwyddan Castle Trust''', an independent registered charity,&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|1040969|BODELWYDDAN CASTLE TRUST}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are open to the public.

The castle's association with the National Portrait Gallery came to an end in 2017 after its funding was cut by [[Denbighshire County Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|URL=http://www.museumsassociation.org/museums-journal/news/15022017-funding-cut-forces-bodelwyddan-castle-to-end-loan-agreement-with-the-national-portrait-gallery?dm_i=2VBX,EVVJ,27LY3L,1IWTJ,1|first=Eleanor|last=Mills|date=15 March 2017|title=Bodelwyddan Castle to sever ties with National Portrait Gallery|publisher=[[Museums Association]]|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gardens==

The castle is set within a large area of parkland, and formal gardens, the most recent of which was originally designed by [[Thomas Hayton Mawson]] in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodelwyddan-castle.co.uk/gardens.htm |title=gardens |work=Bodelwyddan Castle |accessdate=2007-12-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108180029/http://www.bodelwyddan-castle.co.uk/gardens.htm |archivedate=2007-11-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NSA surveillance|2}}
'''Boundless Informant''' (stylized as '''BOUNDLESSINFORMANT''') is a [[big data]] analysis and [[data visualization]] tool used by the United States [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). It gives NSA managers summaries of the NSA's worldwide data collection activities by counting [[metadata]].&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Glenn Greenwald and Ewen MacAskill |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/08/nsa-boundless-informant-global-datamining |title=Boundless Informant: the NSA's secret tool to track global surveillance data |work=The Guardian |accessdate=June 12, 2013 |location=London |date=June 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of this tool was disclosed by documents leaked by [[Edward Snowden]], who worked at the NSA for the [[defense contractor]] [[Booz Allen Hamilton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Edward Snowden: the whistleblower behind revelations of NSA surveillance|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-surveillance |accessdate=June 9, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=June 9, 2013|location=London|first1=Glenn|last1=Greenwald|first2=Ewen|last2=MacAskill|first3=Laura|last3=Poitras}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those disclosed documents were in a direct contradiction to the NSA's assurance to [[United States Congress]] that it does not collect any type of data on millions of Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Here's The NSA's Supposedly Non-Existent Tool To Track Global Metadata |url=http://gawker.com/heres-the-nsas-supposedly-non-existent-tool-to-track-512177941 |accessdate=March 20, 2014 |newspaper=Gawker |date=June 9, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320215856/http://gawker.com/heres-the-nsas-supposedly-non-existent-tool-to-track-512177941 |archivedate=March 20, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Intelligence gathered by the United States government inside the United States or specifically targeting US citizens is legally required to be gathered in compliance with the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] of 1978 (FISA) and under the authority of the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] (FISA court).&lt;ref name="Dean1"&gt;Dean, John W. [http://writ.corporate.findlaw.com/dean/20051230.html George W. Bush as the New Richard M. Nixon: Both Wiretapped Illegally, and Impeachable; Both Claimed That a President May Violate Congress' Laws to Protect National Security], FindLaw, December 30, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holtzman1"&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060130/holtzman The Impeachment of George W.

NSA global data mining projects have existed for decades, but recent programs of intelligence gathering and analysis that include data gathered from inside the United States such as [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] were enabled by changes to US surveillance law introduced under [[Presidency of George W. Bush|President Bush]] and renewed under President Obama in December 2012.&lt;ref name=Greenwald1&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenwald|first=Glenn|title=NSA taps in to internet giants' systems to mine user data, secret files reveal|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data |accessdate=June 6, 2013|date=June 6, 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boundless Informant was first publicly revealed on June 8, 2013, after classified documents about the program were leaked to ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/boundless-informant |title=Boundless Informant &amp;#124; World news |work=The Guardian |accessdate=June 9, 2013 |location=London |date=June 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This report contained a [[Top Secret]] [[heat map]] produced by the Boundless Informant program summarizing data records from 504 separate DNR and DNI collection sources or [[SIGAD]]s. In the map, countries that are under surveillance are assigned a color from green to red (which does not correspond to intensity of surveillance).&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jun/08/nsa-boundless-informant-data-mining-slides |title=Boundless Informant NSA data-mining tool – four key slides |work=The Guardian |accessdate=June 9, 2013 |location=London |date=June 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Blaze, Inc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/06/07/11-questions-you-probably-have-about-u-s-domestic-spying-answered/ |title= Government: 11 things you need to know about u.s. domestic spying |publisher=The Blaze, Inc. |date=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Boundless-heatmap-large-0001.png|thumb|center|844px|The worldwide heat map from the NSA's data visualisation tool BOUNDLESSINFORMANT, showing that during a 30-day period, 97 billion internet data records (DNI) and 124 billion telephony data records (DNR) were collected.]]

As this map shows that almost 3 billion data elements from inside the United States were captured by the NSA over a 30-day period ending in March 2013, Snowden stated that this tool was collecting more information on Americans located within the United States than on Russians in Russia.&lt;ref name=GellmanVictory&gt;[[Barton Gellman|Gellman, Barton]]. "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/edward-snowden-after-months-of-nsa-revelations-says-his-missions-accomplished/2013/12/23/49fc36de-6c1c-11e3-a523-fe73f0ff6b8d_story.html Edward Snowden, after months of NSA revelations, says his mission’s accomplished]." ''[[Washington Post]]''. December 23, 2013. Retrieved on February 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Snowden stated that he raised concerns with two superiors in the Hawaii regional base of the NSA Threat Operations Center and two superiors in the Technology Directorate of the NSA beginning in October 2012, and therefore that counted as using internal dissent channels in the NSA.&lt;ref name=GellmanVictory/&gt;

Snowden added that coworkers often were "astonished to learn" about this detail and did not wish to know any more about the program, and that until April 2012 he often asked these colleagues "What do you think the public would do if this was on the front page?"&lt;ref name=GellmanVictory/&gt; Vanee Vines, an NSA spokesperson, stated that "After extensive investigation, including interviews with his former NSA supervisors and co-workers, we have not found any evidence to support Mr. Snowden's contention that he brought these matters to anyone's attention."&lt;ref name=GellmanVictory/&gt;

The first publication about Boundless Informant was followed by screenshots from this program showing charts with details about the data that NSA allegedly collected from several European countries between  December 10, 2012 and January 8, 2013. These charts were published by a major news outlet from each of these countries:

[[File:Boundless Informant Screencap, Germany.jpg|thumb|350px|Screenshot from the BOUNDLESSINFORMANT tool, showing charts with different details about data collection related to Germany. The upper chart shows internet (blue bars) and telephony (green bars) data, the bottom center chart mentions two [[SIGAD]]s and the most important "tech" in the bottom right section is the [[XKeyscore]] program.]]
* July 29, 2013: '''Germany''': a big chart about this country, showing more than 552 million telephony and internet data, alongside four smaller charts about The Netherlands, France, Spain and Italy were published by the magazine ''Der Spiegel''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-105648237.html Daten aus Deutschland], August 5, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* October 20, 2013: '''France''': a chart showing almost 70 million telephony metadata was published by the newspaper ''Le Monde''.
* October 28, 2013: '''Spain''': a chart showing 60 million telephony metadata was published by the newspaper ''El Mundo''.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Greenwald &amp; German Aranda, [http://www.elmundo.es/espana/2013/10/28/526dcbad61fd3d07678b456b.html La NSA espió 60 millones de llamadas en España en sólo un mes], October 28, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* November 19, 2013: '''Norway''': a chart showing 33 million telephony metadata was published by the tabloid paper ''Dagbladet''.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Greenwald &amp; Arne Halvorsen, [http://www.dagbladet.no/2013/11/19/nyheter/pluss/samfunn/politikk/utenriks/30383890/ USA overvåket 33 millioner norske mobilsamtaler], November 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* December 6, 2013: '''Italy''': a chart showing almost 46 million telephony metadata was published by the tabloid paper ''L'Espresso''.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Greenwald &amp; Stefania Maurizi, [http://espresso.repubblica.it/inchieste/2013/12/05/news/da-qui-ci-spiano-gli-americani-1.144421 Da qui ci spiano gli americani], December 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* February 8, 2014: '''The Netherlands''': a chart showing 1.8 million telephony metadata was published by the newspaper ''NRC Handelsblad''.&lt;ref&gt;Top Level Telecommunications, [http://electrospaces.blogspot.nl/2014/02/boundlessinformant-metadata-collection.html BOUNDLESSINFORMANT: metadata collection by Dutch MIVD instead of NSA], February 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, these media wrote that the BoundlessInformant charts showed how much phonecalls NSA intercepted from a particular country. A first correction of this interpretation is that the program doesn't count the content of phone calls, but only the metadata thereof (see [[#Technology|below]]).

A second correction is about by whom and where these data were collected. On August 5, a week after the publication of a chart from BoundlessInformant in Germany, the German intelligence agency [[Bundesnachrichtendienst|BND]] said that they collected these data from foreign communications, related to military operations abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Der Spiegel, [http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/german-intelligence-sends-massive-amounts-of-data-to-the-nsa-a-914821.html Mass Data: Transfers from Germany Aid US Surveillance], August 5, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Rosenbach &amp; Holger Stark, Der NSA Komplex, Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt, München 2014, p. 235 and 326.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar statement was made by the Norwegian military intelligence service, after a chart about Norway was published on November 19.&lt;ref&gt;RT.com, [http://rt.com/news/norway-nsa-snowden-spying-us-965/ Norway admits it carried out phone surveillance for NSA], November 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 4, 2014, the Dutch government revealed that the 1.8 million metadata in the chart about the Netherlands were not collected by NSA, but instead by the Dutch military intelligence service [[MIVD]], also to support military operations, which almost led to the resignation of the Dutch interior minister.&lt;ref&gt;Top Level Telecommunications, [http://electrospaces.blogspot.nl/2014/02/dutch-government-tried-to-hide-truth.html Dutch government tried to hide the truth about metadata collection], February 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 29, 2013, NSA-director [[Keith B. Alexander]] declared that accusations in French, Spanish and Italian media about NSA intercepting millions of phone calls from these countries are "completely false". He added that "This is not information that we collected on European citizens. It represents information that we and our NATO allies have collected in defense of our countries and in support of military operations."&lt;ref&gt;Reuters.com, [https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/29/us-usa-security-nsa-idUSBRE99S03N20131029 NSA chief defends agency amid U.S. spy rift with Europe], October 29, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
Although the initial reports in European media stated that the various charts presented the numbers of phone calls intercepted by NSA, a powerpoint presentation and a [[Frequently Asked Questions|FAQ]] document published by ''The Guardian''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jun/08/boundless-informant-nsa-full-text |title=Boundless Informant: NSA explainer – full document text |work=The Guardian |accessdate=June 12, 2013 |location=London |date=June 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; say that BoundlessInformant is counting and analysing DNI (internet) and DNR (telephony) [[metadata]] records passing through the NSA's [[signals intelligence]] systems, and are therefore not showing how much content of internet and telephone communications is intercepted.&lt;ref&gt;Top Level Telecommunications, [http://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2013/10/boundlessinformant-only-shows-metadata.html BOUNDLESSINFORMANT only shows metadata], October 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Data analyzed by Boundless Informant includes [[Computer surveillance|electronic surveillance program]] records and [[pen register|telephone call metadata]] records stored in an NSA data archive called GM-PLACE. It does not include [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act|FISA]] data, according to the FAQ memo. [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], a government codename for a collection effort known officially as US-984XN, which was revealed at the same time as Boundless Informant, is one source of DNR data.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Blaze, Inc"/&gt;

According to published slides, Boundless Informant leverages [[Free and Open Source Software]]—and is therefore "available to all NSA developers"—and corporate services hosted in the [[Cloud Computing|cloud]]. The tool uses [[HDFS]], [[MapReduce]], and [[Apache Accumulo|Accumulo]] (formerly Cloudbase)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/07/nsa-accumulo-google-bigtable/ |title=NSA Mimics Google, Pisses Off Senate, Cade Metz |work=Wired |date= July 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; for data processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/710559-doc01187820130608104742.html#document/p4 |title=Boundless Informant slides |publisher=Documentcloud.org |accessdate=June 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bowling Green Massacre Survivor.jpg|thumb|upright|A protester in [[London]] on February 4, 2017]]

The '''Bowling Green massacre''' is a [[fiction|fictitious]] incident alluded to by U.S. [[Counselor to the President]] [[Kellyanne Conway]] in interviews with ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' and [[TMZ]] on January 29, 2017 and in an interview on the [[MSNBC]] news program ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'' on February 2, 2017. Conway cited it as justification for [[Executive Order 13769|a travel and immigration ban]] from seven Muslim-majority countries enacted by [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Donald Trump]]. However, no such massacre occurred. The day after the interview, Conway said she misspoke and had been referring to the 2011 arrest of two Iraqi refugees in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]], on charges including "attempting to provide material support to terrorists and to [[al-Qaeda in Iraq]]".&lt;ref name=fbi2011/&gt; She stated that she had mentioned the incident because it led President [[Barack Obama]] to tighten immigration procedures for Iraqi citizens.

Her false statement went [[Viral phenomenon|viral]] and became the top trending topic on [[Twitter]], with many tweets parodying it. A website was set up anonymously for the purpose of collecting donations for supposed victims. [[Facebook]] users used the site's [[Facebook Safety Check|safety check feature]] to act as if the event were real. Mock vigils were held in Kentucky and New York in commemoration. It provoked widespread press reaction, with many relating it to Conway's earlier use of the phrase ''[[alternative facts]]'' to describe false statements by [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Sean Spicer]] in the wake of the [[inauguration of Donald Trump]].

==Background==
===Terrorism-related arrests in Bowling Green===
[[File:Fountain Square Park, Bowling Green, Kentucky.JPG|thumb|Bowling Green, Kentucky, the target in Conway's "massacre" statement]]

In 2011, two Iraqi men who had entered the country as refugees were arrested in Bowling Green, Kentucky, on federal terrorism charges after they attempted to send both money and weapons to al-Qaeda in Iraq.&lt;ref name=fbi2011/&gt;&lt;ref name="washpo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT Coscarelli"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/us/politics/bowling-green-massacre-kellyanne-conway.html |title=Kellyanne Conway Admits 'Bowling Green massacre' Error |last=Coscarelli |first=Joe |date=February 3, 2017 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both were convicted of supporting attacks on the U.S. military while they were still in Iraq as well as attempting to provide material support to al-Qaeda in Iraq after they emigrated to the United States.&lt;ref name="NYT Coscarelli" /&gt; Arrests were made on various charges, including "attempting to provide material support to terrorists and to al Qaeda in Iraq".&lt;ref name=fbi2011&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice |title=Federal Bureau of Investigation |url=https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/louisville/press-releases/2011/two-iraqi-nationals-indicted-on-federal-terrorism-charges-in-kentucky |accessdate=February 8, 2017 |language=English |date=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before entering the U.S., both had used [[improvised explosive device]]s in Iraq,&lt;ref name="OPA"&gt;{{cite press release |author=[[Office of Public Affairs]] |title=Former Iraqi Terrorists Living in Kentucky Sentenced for Terrorist Activities |url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-iraqi-terrorists-living-kentucky-sentenced-terrorist-activities |date=January 29, 2013 |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] |accessdate=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this was not known at the time of their admission. Both pleaded guilty; one is serving a life sentence while the other is serving 40 years in [[Federal prisons in the United States|federal prison]].&lt;ref name="NYT Coscarelli" /&gt; The two did not attack anyone in the U.S.,{{r|washpo}} and there was no evidence that the men traveled back to Iraq or had any contact with the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] after being admitted to the U.S. Neither was charged with plotting attacks inside the United States.&lt;ref name="OPA"/&gt;

In response to the arrests, the [[administration of Barack Obama]] re-vetted 58,000 refugees already in the country, imposed vetting on 25,000 other Iraqi citizens still in Iraq, and significantly tightened the processing of Iraqi visa and refugee applications for six months.&lt;ref name="CNN Willingham"/&gt; Obama also instituted a requirement for new background checks on visa applicants from Iraq; as a result, Iraq travel visas were issued more slowly.&lt;ref name="WBKO Social media"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.wbko.com/content/news/412673973.html |title=Social media firestorm over Conway's Bowling Green massacre" comments |date=February 3, 2017 |publisher=WBKO ABC 13 |access-date=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The changes in visa verification were temporary, and some Iraqi refugees continued to be admitted to the United States throughout the period.&lt;ref name="CNN Willingham" /&gt;

===Similar possible misstatements===
In September 2014, on ''[[Fox News Sunday]]'', [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Peter T. King|Peter King]] of New York referred to the 2011 arrest of Iraqi nationals in Kentucky as an attempt to "attack&amp;nbsp;either [[Fort Campbell]] or [[Fort Knox]]".&lt;ref name="MSNBC Benen"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/the-fort-knox-plot-only-peter-king-could-see |title=The Fort Knox plot that only Peter King could see |last=Benen |first=Steve |date=September 24, 2014 |publisher=MSNBC |access-date=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact-checking site [[PolitiFact.com]], which evaluated the statement as being false, found that he had said something similar at least seven times previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Steve |last=Contorno |url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/23/peter-king/rep-peter-king-says-isis-tried-attack-fort-knox-20/ |title=Rep.

On January 29–30, 2017, [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Sean Spicer]] stated that Islamist terrorists perpetrated a terrorist attack in [[Atlanta]], even though Atlanta has never had a terrorist attack carried out by Islamists. The initial comment was made on ABC's ''This Week'', and then Spicer repeated the claim on MSNBC's ''Morning Joe'' the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/02/08/sean-spicer-makes-up-atlanta-islamist-attack.html |title=Sean Spicer Makes Up Atlanta Islamist Terror Attack |first=Patricia |last=Murphy |date=February 8, 2017 |publisher= |accessdate=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spicer later said that he meant Orlando, referring to the [[2016 Orlando nightclub shooting]], which was carried out by U.S.–born [[Omar Mateen]]. There have been two terrorist attacks in Atlanta: the 1996 [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing]], which was carried by domestic terrorist Eric Rudolph, and the 1958 [[Hebrew Benevolent Congregation Temple bombing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Claiborne |first1=Matthew |title=Sean Spicer on Citing Atlanta Terror Attack That Never Happened: I 'Clearly Meant' Orlando |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/sean-spicer-citing-unknown-atlanta-terror-attack-times/story?id=45364173 |accessdate=February 21, 2017 |work=ABC News |date=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2017/02/08/remember-the-atlanta-massacre-yeah-that-didnt-happen-either/ |title=Your Daily Jolt: The Atlanta massacre never happened, either – Political Insider blog |first1=Greg |last1=Bluestein |first2=Tamar |last2=Hallerman |first3=Jim |last3=Galloway |publisher= |accessdate=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A day later, on January 31, two days before the ''Hardball'' interview with Conway, Kentucky senator [[Rand Paul]] referenced the 2011 case in an interview with MSNBC by mentioning "the possibility or the attempted bombing in Bowling Green, Kentucky, where I live". ''The Washington Post{{'s}}'' Fact Checker noted that Paul's statement was truer than Conway's because the Iraqi nationals did discuss bombing an Army target in the United States, even though neither was charged with making actual plans to do so.&lt;ref name="washpo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian 2017-02-03"/&gt;

==False statements by Conway==
[[File:Kellyanne Conway by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Kellyanne Conway]] in 2017]]

On January 29, 2017, in an interview with ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'', Conway said that Obama had limited Iraqi immigration because "two Iraqi nationals came to this country, joined ISIS, traveled back to the Middle East to get trained and refine their terrorism skills, and come back here, and were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre of taking innocent soldiers' lives away".&lt;ref name="Cosmo" &gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a8674035/kellyanne-conway-bowling-green-massacre-repeat/ |title=That MSNBC Interview Was Not the First Time Kellyanne Conway Referred to the 'Bowling Green Massacre' |last=Mascia |first=Kristen |date=February 6, 2017 |work=Cosmopolitan |accessdate=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian_Smith"&gt;{{Cite news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=February 6, 2017 |first=David |last=Smith |title=Kellyanne Conway's fictitious 'Bowling Green massacre' not a one-time slip of the tongue |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/06/kellyanne-conway-fake-bowling-green-massacre-three-times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day, in a brief interview with [[TMZ]], Conway stated: "He did that because, I assume, there were two Iraqis who came here, got radicalized, joined ISIS, and then were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green attack on our brave soldiers."&lt;ref name="Beast_TMZ"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/02/06/kellyanne-conway-referenced-bowling-green-attack-in-tmz-interview.html |title=Kellyanne Conway Referenced 'Bowling Green Attack' in TMZ Interview |last=Resnick |first=Gideon |date=February 6, 2017 |work=[[The Daily Beast]] |accessdate=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian_Smith" /&gt;

Three days later, on February 2, in an interview with [[Chris Matthews]] on [[MSNBC]]'s ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'', Conway described the "Bowling Green massacre" as an attack of [[terrorism]] carried out within the United States by [[refugee]]s.&lt;ref name="NPR Chappell"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/03/513222852/bogus-bowling-green-massacre-claim-snarls-trump-adviser-conway |title=Bogus 'Bowling Green Massacre' Claim Snarls Trump Adviser Conway |last=Chappell |first=Bill |date=February 3, 2017 |publisher=NPR |access-date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conway said:

Although the interviews with ''Cosmopolitan'' and TMZ were conducted first, they did not become public until after the MSNBC interview aired.

==Aftermath==
On February 3, the day after her MSNBC interview, Conway said she misspoke and that she meant to use the term "Bowling Green terrorists" instead of "Bowling Green massacre",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://time.com/4659303/kellyanne-conway-bowling-green-massacre-donald-trump/ |title=Twitter Mocks Kellyanne Conway's False 'Bowling Green Massacre' Comments |last=Rahim |first=Zamira |date=February 3, 2017 |work=Time |access-date=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the two Iraqi men arrested in 2011.&lt;ref name="washpo" /&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' subsequently mentioned previous statements by Conway where she had made reference to the nonexistent massacre, indicating that "she doesn't appear to have misspoken at all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/06/kellyanne-conways-bowling-green-massacre-wasnt-a-slip-of-the-tongue-shes-said-it-before/ |first=Aaron |last=Blake |title=Kellyanne Conway's 'Bowling Green massacre' wasn't a slip of the tongue.

Conway's statement that the men became "radicalized" in the United States was found to be incorrect, as they had been radicalized outside of the country.&lt;ref name="Cosmo" /&gt; Conway's statement that President Obama "had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program" was misleading, as the Obama administration move was not a formal ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gajanan |first1=Mahita |title=Kellyanne Conway Has Claimed There's Been a 'Bowling Green Massacre' More than Once |url=http://fortune.com/2017/02/06/kellyanne-conway-bowling-green-massacare/ |accessdate=February 22, 2017 |work=Fortune |date=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to Conway's claims, there is no evidence that the men had traveled back to the Middle East&lt;ref name="Cosmo" /&gt; or had any contact with ISIS after being admitted to the United States.{{Citation needed|reason=Needs a source that actually says whether the men had any contact with ISIS. |date=February 2017}} Neither of the two was ever charged with plotting attacks inside the United States.&lt;ref name="CNN Willingham"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/03/politics/bowling-green-not-massacre-terrorists-trnd/ |title=Here's what actually happened in Bowling Green |last=Willingham |first=AJ |date=February 3, 2017 |publisher=CNN |access-date=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conway, in her February 3 statement, said that there was no coverage of the Bowling Green investigation, which she intended to refer to.&lt;ref name="Wash Post Schmidt"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/02/03/kellyanne-conway-cites-bowling-green-massacre-that-never-happened-to-defend-travel-ban/ |title=Kellyanne Conway cites 'Bowling Green massacre' that never happened to defend travel ban |last=Schmidt |first=Samantha |date=February 3, 2017 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were approximately 90 news articles that covered the arrest and charges at the time.&lt;ref name="Wash Post Schmidt" /&gt; Conway's February 3 statement cited an example of that coverage, without acknowledging that her claim that "it didn't get covered" was also incorrect.&lt;ref name="NYT Coscarelli" /&gt;

On February 5, CNN declined an interview with Conway, partly because of "serious questions about her credibility" and partly because CNN could not get [[Mike Pence]], whom the administration made available to all the other major Sunday shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/05/business/the-massacre-that-wasnt-and-a-turning-point-for-fake-news.html |title=The Massacre That Wasn't, and a Turning Point for 'Fake News' |first=Jim |last=Rutenberg |work=The New York Times |date=February 5, 2017 |accessdate=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="politico" /&gt; That day, she said in a text exchange, "Frankly they were terrorists in Bowling Green but their massacre took place in Iraq."&lt;ref name="Cosmo" /&gt; Two days later, she was a guest on CNN, interviewed on air by [[Jake Tapper]]. In the interview, Conway apologized for repeatedly referencing a "Bowling Green massacre" that did not happen.&lt;ref name="politico"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Quigley |first1=Aidan |work=[[Politico]] |title=Conway: CNN is not 'fake news' |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/kellyanne-conway-cnn-interview-234760 |accessdate=February 7, 2017 |date=February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Stedman |first1=Alex |title=Kellyanne Conway Apologizes for Bowling Green 'Massacre' Remark, Spars With CNN's Jake Tapper |url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/kellyanne-conway-bowling-green-massacre-cnn-jake-tapper-1201980910/ |accessdate=February 8, 2017 |work=Variety |date=February 7, 2017 |quote="I regretted it tremendously because I used the wrong word to describe something several times", she went on.

In a March 2017 interview with ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', Conway said she intended to say "Bowling Green masterminds" rather than "Bowling Green massacre", in reference to "would-be terrorists who were apprehended before they staged an attack".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nuzzi|first1=Olivia|title=Kellyanne Conway Is a Star Not your star, perhaps.

Writing in ''The New York Times'', A.C Thompson mentioned the 2012 case of a man who the authorities suspected of trafficking in counterfeit goods. His home and his store in [[Bowling Green, Ohio]], were raided, and 18 firearms were found in his possession. Federal authorities believed that he was planning on killing African Americans and Jews. The man, who the prosecutors called a white supremacist, pleaded guilty to weapons and counterfeit charges, but prosecutors failed to establish that he was a political terrorist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thompson |first1=A.C |title=When the Government Really Did Fear a Bowling Green Massacre |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/opinion/when-the-government-really-did-fear-a-bowling-green-massacre.html |date=February 8, 2017 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Builders' rites''' are [[ceremony|ceremonies]] attendant on the laying of [[foundation stone]]s, including [[ecclesiastical]], [[masonic]] or otherwise and other traditions connected with [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]]s or other aspects of construction.

One such custom is that of placing a few coins, newspapers, etc. within a cavity beneath the stone. Should the stone later be removed, the relics may be found. Though this tradition is still practiced, such memorials are deposited in the hope that they will never be disturbed.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Builders' Rites |volume=4 |page=762|first=William James |last=Hughan}} According to the above, the best succinct account of these rites was to be obtained in [[George Speth|G. W. Speth]]'s ''Builders' Rites and Ceremonies'' (1893).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Living victims were once entombed as "a sacrifice to the gods" and to ensure the stability of the building.

[[Jacob Grimm|Grimm]] remarked "It was often thought necessary to immure live animals and even men in the foundation, on which the structure was to be raised, to secure immovable stability."&lt;ref&gt;''Teutonic Mythology'' (1883–1884), (trans. Stalleybrass)&lt;/ref&gt; This gruesome practice is well evidenced, in multiple cultures. "The old pagan laid the foundation of his house and fortress in blood."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sabine Baring-Gould|Baring-Gould]] on "Foundations," ''Murray's Mag''. (1887)&lt;/ref&gt; Under the walls of two round towers in [[Ireland]] (the only ones examined) human skeletons were discovered. In the 15th century, the wall of [[Holsworthy, Devon|Holsworthy]] church was built over a living human being, and when this became unlawful, images of living beings were substituted.&lt;ref&gt;''Folk-Lore Journal'', i. 23-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

References to this practice can be found in Greek folk culture in a poem about "Arta's bridge". According to the poem, the wife of the chief builder was sacrificed to establish a good foundation for a bridge that was of grave importance to the secluded city of Arta. The actual bridge was constructed in 1602. A similar legend appears in the Romanian folk poem ''' [[Meșterul Manole]], ''' about the building of the church in the earliest Wallachian capital city.

The '''Channel 0 Emcee Africa tour''' is a tour that is sponsored by [[Sprite (soft drink)|Sprite]]. It was associated with '''Emcee Africa - The Battle Chronicles''', a talent show televising the competition. It was a [[continent]]-wide search for the premier freestyle [[MC]]/[[Rapper]]. The tour started in [[Accra, Ghana]], and then went through [[Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania]], [[Nairobi, Kenya]], [[Luanda, Angola]], [[Lagos, Nigeria]] and [[Johannesburg, South Africa]].&lt;ref name="africanhiphop.com"&gt;[http://www.africanhiphop.com/index.php?module=subjects&amp;func=viewpage&amp;pageid=284 Africanhiphop.com :: African Rap :: 10 years online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gaborone]], [[Botswana]] was included in the second season, while [[Luanda, Angola]] and [[Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania]] were cut from the tour.

The motive of the tour was not only to find the best freestyle MC, but to initiate [[international]] awareness of the 'street life' surrounding social and cultural context of the localized music. In other words, the tour was attempting to better contextualize the application and reception of [[hip hop]] culture in each visited country.

The winner received $10,000, a video and a song deal.

==Format and rules==
The first season of ''Emcee Africa'' followed the host [[Leslie 'Lee' Kasumba]] to the various host cities, where the local [[MC]]/[[Rapper]]'s were invited to an audition. The final eight MC's were selected to face off in a knockout competition to determine the winner. During the auditions, each performer had two minutes to prove their candidacy for the final eight to a panel of judges. A topic was given to each contender to Freestyle about in order to ensure each contestant was truly improvising and not using any written material. After eight contestants were selected from each country, a separate contest was held, where the eight members would face off to battle each other in two 30 second parts, divided into 2 rounds, followed by the Final. The winner from each country was then flown into Johannesburg to compete for the "Emcee Africa" title, as well as the grand prize. A judge from each country's panel was then flown in to ensure neutrality in the final competition.

The second season followed a similar format with similar rules, except that ten contenders were selected from the auditions, rather than eight. In the second season, contestants who made it through to the second round did not Battle each other but were rather judged based on a performance. From the performance, the judges panel selected two finalists to face off in a final battle.

==Wildcard==
For the Final Battle in the first season, audiences could log into www.channelo.co.za, and vote for their favorite [[MC]]/[[Rapper]] from the previous competitions, to reappear in the final stages.

==Host==
[[Leslie 'Lee' Kasumba]] (a top hip hop radio [[Disc Jockey|DJ]] from South Africa's YFM station) is the host. She also corresponds for Africanhiphop.com.

On the tour called 'the Battle Chronicles', she was chosen to narrate her daily experiences of traveling.&lt;ref name="africanhiphop.com"/&gt;

'''Charles Frederick "Charlie" Wilson''' (30 June 1932 – 23 April 1990)&lt;ref name=Wensley/&gt;&lt;ref name=HistoryCh/&gt; was an English career criminal. A member of the [[Great Train Robbery (1963)|Great Train Robbery]] gang, of which he was treasurer, he was killed by a [[hitman]] on a bicycle in 1990 whilst living in [[Marbella]], Spain.&lt;ref name=Wensley/&gt;

==Early life==
Wilson was born on 30 June 1932 to Bill and Mabel Wilson in [[Battersea]], London. Possessing a heavy build, a handsome appearance and piercing blue eyes, Wilson was, from an early age, an intimidating presence. His friends from childhood included Jimmy Hussey, Tommy Wisbey, [[Bruce Reynolds]] and [[Gordon Goody]]. Later on, he met [[Buster Edwards|Ronald "Buster" Edwards]] and the young driving enthusiasts Mickey Ball and Roy James, who had taken up car theft.&lt;ref name=Wensley/&gt;

From 1948 to 1950 he was called up for [[National Service]], and in 1955 he married Patricia (Pat) Osbourne, with whom he had three children.&lt;ref name=Wensley/&gt;

==Early career==
Wilson turned to crime early in life and spurned his father's legitimate but low-income wage. While he did have legitimate work in his in-laws' grocer's shop, he also was a thief and his criminal proceeds went into buying shares in various gambling enterprises. He went to jail for short spells for numerous offences.&lt;ref name=Wensley&gt;{{cite book|title=Killing Charlie: The Bloody, Bullet-Riddled Hunt for the Most Powerful Great Train Robber of All|author=Wensley Clarkson|publisher=Mainstream Publishing|date=2 February 2006|ISBN=1845960351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, Wilson began to work with Bruce Reynolds and planned to get into the criminal big league.&lt;ref name=Wensley/&gt; In 1962, a gang led by Reynolds stole £62,000 in a security van robbery at [[London Heathrow Airport]]. They then attempted to rob a [[Royal Mail]] train at [[Swindon]], which netted only £700.&lt;ref name=GuardObit/&gt; But Reynolds, now looking for his career-criminal defining moment,&lt;ref name=Idler/&gt; started planning his next train robbery over a period of three months.&lt;ref name=GuardObit&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/feb/28/bruce-reynolds|title=Obituary: Bruce Reynolds|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=28 February 2013|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reynolds organised a gang of 17 men to undertake the [[Great Train Robbery (1963)]].&lt;ref name=Idler&gt;{{cite web |url=http://idler.co.uk/conversations-bruce-reynolds/ |title=In conversation with... Bruce Reynolds |publisher=Idler magazine |date=14 March 1996 |accessdate=28 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130420212102/http://idler.co.uk/conversations-bruce-reynolds/ |archivedate=20 April 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson was the gang's treasurer who gave each of the robbers their cut of the haul: £150,000 each. He was captured quickly, and during the trial at [[Aylesbury]] [[Crown Court]] in April 1964 he got the nickname "the silent man" as he refused to say anything at all. Sentenced to 30 years, he was held at [[HM Prison Birmingham|HMP Winson Green]], where after just four months on 12 August 1964, he arranged for a three-man gang to break-in and break him out.&lt;ref name=HistoryCh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/great-train-robber-escapes-from-prison|title=Great train robber escapes from Prison|publisher=History Channel|date=12 August 1964|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/12/newsid_2996000/2996402.stm|title=1964: Great Train Robber escapes from jail|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=12 August 1964|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson and his family settled in [[Rigaud, Quebec]], Canada, situated {{convert|70|km}} west from [[Montreal]] and {{convert|130|km}} east from [[Ottawa]].&lt;ref name=Algarve/&gt; For Christmas 1964, the family travelled to [[Acapulco]] to join Reynolds and Edwards, who had not yet been caught. Reynolds and his family later moved to Montreal, but a proposed theft of [[Canadian dollar]]s with Wilson was stopped due to [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] observation. Reynolds then moved to [[Vancouver]], before returning that summer to the [[South of France]].&lt;ref name=GuardObit/&gt;

==Capture==
Having successfully evaded capture for four years, Wilson was caught on 24 January 1968,&lt;ref name=HistoryCh/&gt; after his wife telephoned her parents in England, thus enabling [[Scotland Yard]] to track them down.&lt;ref name=Algarve/&gt; Returned to England, Wilson served 10 more years in the train robbers secure unit at [[HMP Durham]]. He was the final train robber to emerge from prison in 1978.&lt;ref name=WhatBecame&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/what-became-of-the-great-train-robbers-7228375.html|title=What became of the Great Train Robbers|publisher=[[London Evening Standard]]|date=8 August 2003|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
A later suspect in a £100 million gold fraud, Wilson moved to [[Marbella]], [[Spain]], where he was suspected to be involved in [[drug smuggling]].&lt;ref name=Algarve&gt;{{cite web|url=http://algarvedailynews.com/features/history/4416-the-great-train-robbery-part-ii-did-it-end-like-a-childrens-tea-party|title=The Great Train Robbery Part II – Did it end like a Children's Tea Party?|author=Jack Harvey|publisher=algarvedailynews.com|accessdate=28 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130144443/http://algarvedailynews.com/features/history/4416-the-great-train-robbery-part-ii-did-it-end-like-a-childrens-tea-party#|archive-date=30 January 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engaged to launder some of the proceeds from the [[Brink's-Mat robbery]], he lost the investors £3 million.

==Death==
On 23 April 1990,&lt;ref name=HistoryCh/&gt; Wilson's cousin and his wife who were staying with the Wilsons, left the house, noticing a young man with badly dyed spiky blond hair sunning himself beside his yellow bicycle on a nearby roundabout. The same man knocked on the front door of Wilson's hacienda north of Marbella, and when Pat Wilson opened the door, he asked (in a London accent) to speak to Wilson, as he had a message from Eamon, a baseball cap pulled down shielding his eyes from view. Pat got him to leave the bike near the front door, and let him go out the back yard to talk to Wilson who was preparing a [[barbecue]] dinner to celebrate his and Pat's wedding anniversary.&lt;ref name=Wensley/&gt;&lt;ref name=HistoryCh/&gt;

After five minutes of conversation, the visitor kicked Wilson in the groin, broke his nose, and shot him twice, once in the neck and the other in the head. One of Wilson's two guard dogs sustained a broken leg trying to defend its master (it later had to be put down). The killer then jumped over the back fence in the one spot where it was possible to do and land on the ground outside safely, and circled back to the front of the house to grab the yellow bike. An accomplice pulled up in a van nearby and the killer was able to put the bike in the back and escape. The whole hit was expertly designed to take out Wilson alone, and leave his wife alive.&lt;ref name=Wensley/&gt;&lt;ref name=HistoryCh/&gt; 

Charlie's wife Pat, moved back to London to live near her daughters, leaving her terrier with Gordon Goody, and her surviving guard dog with the neighbour. 

It is likely that Wilson was murdered on the orders of Roy "The Lump" Adkins, with killers identified by Pat Wilson as Bill "Porky" Edmunds, with Danny "Scarface" Roff as the accomplice. The two men were known to work as a team. Adkins was furious with Wilson, that he had supposedly given 'permission' for smuggler Jimmy Rose to admit to police that a drug shipment he was carrying was owned by Adkins, who was already on the run from police. After a request from Rose, Wilson rung one of Adkins' associates, Eamon Evans, to ask whether Rose could name him. While Rose denies naming Adkins, two days after Wilson's call to Evans, police raided Adkins hideout in Amsterdam, only shortly after he had left it. Adkins, a heavy drug user as well as dealer was furious with Wilson, and would not agree to peaceful terms arranged by intermediaries. Whether or not the three men were guilty, they were widely held responsible and Adkins was himself gunned down on 28 September 1990. On 10 February 1996, Danny 'Scarface' Roff who had recently been released from prison was shot in the spine when a gunman walked into a club where he was present and sprayed him with bullets. In March 1997, a crippled Roff, now no longer able to walk, was shot dead in his car when he returned home. Edmunds has survived by going on the run.&lt;ref name=Wensley/&gt;&lt;ref name=HistoryCh/&gt;

'''''Congratulations: 50 Years of the Eurovision Song Contest''''' was a television programme organised by the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) to commemorate the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]'s fiftieth anniversary and to determine the Contest's most popular entrant of its fifty years. It took place at [[Forum Copenhagen|Forum]], [[Copenhagen]] on 22 October 2005. The host broadcaster was [[Danmarks Radio]] (DR). Fourteen songs from the Contest's first half-century, chosen through an internet poll and by a jury, contested the event.&lt;ref name="theage"&gt;Michael Dwyer (20 October 2005).

Retrieved on 26 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-one EBU-member countries broadcast the concert (although notably the [[United Kingdom]], [[Italy]] and [[France]] did not) and televoting and juries in these countries decided the winner.&lt;ref name="participants"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/english/1869.htm |title=Participating broadcasters |accessdate=2017-09-10 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051013063930/http://www.eurovision.tv/english/1869.htm |archivedate=13 October 2005 |df=dmy-all }}.

The event was hosted by [[Katrina Leskanich]] and [[Renārs Kaupers]]. The event was won by [[Sweden|Swedish]] group [[ABBA]], performing "[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]"; the band had originally won the Contest for Sweden in 1974.

To coincide with the event, the EBU released two [[double album]] CDs featuring Eurovision songs from the previous fifty years. Two DVDs with original Eurovision performances of these songs were also released.&lt;ref&gt;Roel Phillips (9 April 2005).

==Organisation==
In November 2002, Jürgen Meier-Beer from the Reference Group of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) announced plans to organize a special jubilee concert in 2005 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Eurovision Song Contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/941/special_programme_for_50th_eurovision_song_contest/|title=Special programme for 50th Eurovision Song Contest|website=www.esctoday.com|author=Sietse Bakker|date=28 November 2002|access-date=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Host broadcaster===
In June 2004, the EBU announced that it was to hold a concert to celebrate fifty years of the contest. The event was to be held on 16 October 2005 at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[London]], [[England]]. The [[BBC]] was to be the host broadcaster for the concert.&lt;ref&gt;Sietse Bakker (18 June 2004). [http://esctoday.com/2875/50th_anniversary_show_in_london/ 50th anniversary show to be held in London]. ESCtoday.com. Retrieved on 26 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Albert Hall was reportedly unavailable, so in August 2004 the EBU announced that DR would stage the event instead. Eurovision Song Contest supervisor [[Svante Stockselius]] said that Denmark's previous experience of hosting Eurovision events (the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2001|2001 Contest]] and the [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2003|first Junior Eurovision Song Contest]] in 2003) were influential in the Union's choice. The event was codenamed ''Extravaganza''.&lt;ref&gt;Sietse Bakker (26 August 2004). [http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/3075 50th anniversary show in Denmark]. ESCtoday.com. Retrieved on 26 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998|1998]] Eurovision winner [[Dana International]], who appeared at the event, later went to suggest that the reason behind the change of host country was also due to the fact that the BBC wanted to present the show "with humour" as though to poke fun at the Contest, an idea that proved to be less popular with the EBU. The BBC went on to broadcast their own 50th anniversary program, ''[[Boom Bang-a-Bang: 50 Years of Eurovision]]'', in May 2006.&lt;ref&gt;BBC (16 May 2006).

===Selection of venue and hosts===
[[File:Forum Copenhagen.jpg|thumb|[[Forum Copenhagen]], venue for the concert]]
On 25 October 2004 Copenhagen was confirmed as the host city for the event, which was now scheduled to take place on 22 October 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Roel Phillips (25 October 2004). [http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/3259 Extravaganza on 22 October in Copenhagen]. ESCtoday.com.

On 9 September 2005, DR announced that [[Katrina Leskanich]] and [[Renārs Kaupers]] would present the concert. Leskanich was the lead singer of [[Katrina and The Waves]], who won the Contest for the United Kingdom in {{Escyr|1997}}. Kaupers is the lead singer of Latvian group [[Brainstorm (Latvian band)|Brainstorm]], who represented Latvia on its debut in the Contest in {{Escyr|2000}}.&lt;ref&gt;Sietse Bakker (9 September 2005).

==Participating countries==
Fourteen songs would compete in ''Congratulations''.

The remaining four songs would be selected by the EBU's Reference Group.&lt;ref name="theage"/&gt; On 16 June 2005 the fourteen chosen songs were announced, although no indication was given as to which had been chosen online and which by the Reference Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/english/1820.htm |title="Congratulations" – 14 songs to compete |accessdate=2017-09-10 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050828130357/http://www.eurovision.tv/english/1820.htm |archivedate=28 August 2005 |df=dmy-all }} (16 June 2005). Eurovision.tv. Retrieved on 26 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven of the fourteen songs were [[Eurovision winners]]; only "Nel blu di pinto di blu", "Congratulations" and "Eres Tú" (which all finished in the top three at the Contest) were not. Two countries, the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], were represented twice on the list. [[Johnny Logan (singer)|Johnny Logan]], who won the Contest twice for Ireland as a singer, had both of his songs featured on the list.

==Performances==
The show started with the traditional Eurovision "Te Deum" theme followed by a message from Cliff Richard. After a quick montage of all 14 songs, the orchestra began playing "[[Ding-A-Dong]]" (Netherlands 1975), with dancers on stage. "[[A-Ba-Ni-Bi]]" (Israel 1978), "[[Le Dernier qui a parlé...|Le dernier qui a parlé...]]" (France 1991), and "Dschinghis Khan" (Germany 1979) was also played and accompanied by choreography, which was then followed by "[[Love Shine a Light]]" (UK 1997) sung by the co-host, Katrina Leskanich, who came out with flag holders of all the nations who ever participated in Eurovision.

Throughout the telecast, a number of highlights segments were presented which showed montages of various Eurovision performances which were either interesting, notable or unorthodox. There were 6 assortments, which were under the categories described by the hosts as 'past winners', 'political, daring, larger than life', 'cute men', 'unforgettable interpretation of dance', 'girlpower' and 'close/narrow second-place finishers'. A number of high-profile Eurovision artists returned to help introduce and present the show, these were: [[Carola Häggkvist]], [[Massiel]], [[Dana International]], [[Birthe Wilke]], [[Anne-Marie David]], [[Sandra Kim]], [[Elisabeth Andreassen]], [[Hanne Krogh]], [[Olsen Brothers]], [[Emilija Kokić]], [[Marie Myriam]], [[Sertab Erener]], [[Elena Paparizou]], [[Nicole &amp; Hugo]], [[Cheryl Baker]] and [[Lys Assia]]. [[Cliff Richard]] and [[Nicole (German singer)|Nicole]] gave pre-recorded messages as they were unable to attend.

During the show, there were many presentations by various guest artists during the voting and tallying period. These consisted of the Finnish shouting choir [[Mieskuoro Huutajat]], [[Riverdance]] (the 1994 interval act), [[Ronan Keating]] (the 1997 co-host), and Johnny Logan, singing his new single ''When a Woman Loves a Man'', as well as an appearance by the Belgian duo of 1973, Nicole &amp; Hugo.

There were three medleys, consisting of performances of past Eurovision songs. The first consisted of : Dana International, singing ''Parlez-vous Francais'' (originally performed by [[Baccara]] for [[Luxembourg]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978]]); Carola Haggkvist, singing ''Främling'' ([[Eurovision Song Contest 1983|1983]], 3rd place); [[Alsou]], singing ''Solo'' ([[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000]], 2nd); [[Fabrizio Faniello]], singing ''Another Summer Night'' ([[Eurovision Song Contest 2001|2001]] 9th); [[Marie Myriam]], singing ''L'Amour est bleu'' (originally performed by [[Vicky Leandros]] for [[Luxembourg]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1967|1967]]); [[Herreys|Richard Herrey]], singing "[[Let Me Be the One (Eurovision song)|Let Me Be the One]]" (originally performed by [[The Shadows]] for [[United Kingdom]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1975|1975]]); and [[Thomas Thordarson]], singing '' Vi Maler Byen Rød'' (originally performed by [[Birthe Kjær]] for [[Denmark]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1989|1989]]).

The second consisted of: [[Gali Atari]], singing ''Hallelujah'' ([[Eurovision Song Contest 1979|1979]], winner); [[Bobbysocks]], singing ''La Det Swinge'' ([[Eurovision Song Contest 1985|1985]], winner); Anne-Marie David, singing ''Après Toi'' (originally sung by [[Vicky Leandros]] for [[Luxembourg]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1972|1972]], winner); Lys Assia, singing ''Refrain'' ([[Eurovision Song Contest 1956|1956]], winner), Sandra Kim singing ''Non ho l'Eta'' (originally sung by [[Gigliola Cinquetti]] for [[Italy]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1964|1964]], winner) and [[Bucks Fizz (band)|Bucks Fizz]] singing ''Making your Mind Up'' ([[Eurovision Song Contest 1981|1981]], winner).

The final medley was sung by [[Eimear Quinn]], [[Charlie McGettigan]], [[Jakob Sveistrup]] and [[Linda Martin]], the Eurovision winners of 1996, 1994 and 1992, and (in Sveistrup's case), the 2005 Danish representative. All four acted as backup singers during the show.

==Results==
{{further|Voting at the Eurovision Song Contest}}

Both juries and televoting were used at ''Congratulations''; both having an equal influence over the vote. In the first round of voting, the number of songs was reduced to five. Each country awarded points from one to eight, then ten and finally twelve for their ten most popular songs. Unlike in the Contest proper, viewers were allowed to vote for songs which had represented their country. The top five songs were then subjected to another round of voting, where only six points and above were awarded.

{{Cosmology}}

In [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], the '''cosmological constant''' (usually denoted by the Greek capital letter [[lambda]]: Λ) is the energy density of space, or [[vacuum energy]], that arises in [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[field equations]] of [[general relativity]]. It is closely associated to the concepts of [[dark energy]] and [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]].&lt;ref name="CC Definition" /&gt; 

Einstein originally introduced the concept in 1917 &lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Einstein|1917}}&lt;/ref&gt; to counterbalance the effects of gravity and achieve a [[static universe]], a notion which was the accepted view at the time. Einstein abandoned the concept in 1931 after [[Edwin Hubble|Hubble]]'s discovery of the expanding universe.&lt;ref name="Rugh 2001 3"/&gt; From the 1930s until the late 1990s, most physicists assumed the cosmological constant to be equal to zero.&lt;ref name="Λ = 0?"/&gt; That changed with the surprising discovery in 1998 that the [[accelerating expansion of the universe|expansion of the universe is accelerating]], implying the possibility of a positive nonzero value for the cosmological constant.&lt;ref name="1998 Discovery"/&gt; 

Since the 1990s, studies have shown that around 68% of the mass–energy density of the universe can be attributed to so-called [[dark energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Redd|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cosmological constant Λ is the simplest possible explanation for dark energy, and is used in the current standard model of cosmology known as the [[Lambda-CDM model|ΛCDM model]]. While dark energy is poorly understood at a fundamental level, the main required properties of dark energy are that it functions as a type of anti-gravity, it dilutes much more slowly than matter as the universe expands, and it clusters much more weakly than matter, or perhaps not at all.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

According to [[quantum field theory]] (QFT) which underlies modern [[particle physics]], empty space is defined by the [[vacuum state]] which is a collection of [[quantum fields]]. All these quantum fields exhibit fluctuations in their [[ground state]] (lowest energy density) arising from the [[zero-point energy]] present everywhere in space. These zero-point fluctuations should act as a contribution to the cosmological constant Λ, but when calculations are performed these fluctuations give rise to an enormous vacuum energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rugh|Zinkernagel|2001|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discrepancy between theorized vacuum energy from QFT and observed vacuum energy from cosmology is a source of major contention, with the values predicted exceeding observation by some 120 orders of magnitude, a discrepancy that has been called "the worst theoretical prediction in the history of physics!".&lt;ref name="CC Problem"/&gt; This issue is called the [[cosmological constant problem]] and it is one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in science with many physicists believing that "the vacuum holds the key to a full understanding of nature".&lt;ref name="CC Problem 3"/&gt;

== History ==
[[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] included the cosmological constant as a term in his [[Einstein field equations|field equations]] for [[general relativity]] because he was dissatisfied that otherwise his equations did not allow, apparently, for a [[static universe]]: gravity would cause a universe that was initially at dynamic equilibrium to contract. To counteract this possibility, Einstein added the cosmological constant.&lt;ref name="Rugh 2001 3"/&gt; However, soon after Einstein developed his static theory, observations by [[Edwin Hubble]] indicated that the universe appears to be expanding; this was consistent with a cosmological solution to the ''original'' general relativity equations that had been found by the mathematician [[Alexander Alexandrovich Friedmann|Friedmann]], working on the Einstein equations of general relativity. Einstein reportedly referred to his failure to accept the validation of his equations—when they had predicted the expansion of the universe in theory, before it was demonstrated in observation of the cosmological [[red shift]]—as his "biggest blunder".&lt;ref name="Biggest Blunder"/&gt;

In fact, adding the cosmological constant to Einstein's equations does not lead to a static universe at equilibrium because the [[equilibrium point|equilibrium]] is unstable: if the universe expands slightly, then the expansion releases [[vacuum energy]], which causes yet more expansion. Likewise, a universe that contracts slightly will continue contracting.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ryden|2003|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the cosmological constant remained a subject of theoretical and empirical interest. Empirically, the onslaught of cosmological data in the past decades strongly suggests that our universe has a positive cosmological constant.&lt;ref name="1998 Discovery"/&gt;  The explanation of this small but positive value is an outstanding theoretical challenge, the so-called [[cosmological constant problem]].

Some early generalizations of Einstein's gravitational theory, known as [[classical unified field theories]], either introduced a cosmological constant on theoretical grounds or found that it arose naturally from the mathematics. For example, Sir [[Arthur Stanley Eddington]] claimed that the cosmological constant version of the vacuum field equation expressed the "[[epistemology|epistemological]]" property that the universe is "self-[[gauge theory|gauging]]", and [[Erwin Schrödinger]]'s pure-[[affine connection|affine]] theory using a simple [[History of variational principles in physics|variational principle]] produced the field equation with a cosmological term.

==Equation==
[[File:080998 Universe Content 240 after Planck.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Estimated ratios of [[dark matter]] and dark energy (which may be the cosmological constant&lt;ref name="CC Definition" /&gt;) in the universe. According to current theories of physics, dark energy now dominates as the largest source of energy of the universe, in contrast to earlier epochs when it was insignificant.]]
{{Technical|section|date=March 2014}}
The cosmological constant &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; appears in [[Einstein field equations|Einstein's field equation]] in the form

:&lt;math&gt;R_{\mu \nu} - \tfrac{1}{2} R g_{\mu \nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu \nu} = {8 \pi G \over c^4} T_{\mu \nu},&lt;/math&gt;

where the Ricci tensor/scalar [[Ricci tensor|''R'']] and the metric tensor [[metric tensor (general relativity)|''g'']] describe the structure of [[spacetime]], the stress-energy tensor [[stress–energy tensor|''T'']] describes the energy and momentum density and flux of the matter in that point in spacetime, and  the universal constants [[gravitational constant|''G'']] and [[speed of light|''c'']] are conversion factors that arise from using traditional units of measurement. When ''Λ'' is zero, this reduces to the field equation of general relativity usually used in the mid-20th&amp;nbsp;century. When ''T'' is zero, the field equation describes empty space (the [[vacuum]]).

The cosmological constant has the same effect as an intrinsic [[energy density]] of the vacuum, ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;vac&lt;/sub&gt; (and an associated [[pressure]]). In this context, it is commonly moved onto the right-hand side of the equation, and defined with a [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality]] factor of 8''π'': {{nowrap|1=Λ = 8''πρ''&lt;sub&gt;vac&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where unit conventions of general relativity are used (otherwise factors of ''G'' and ''c'' would also appear, i.e. {{nowrap|1=Λ = 8''π''(''G''/''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;vac&lt;/sub&gt; = ''κρ''&lt;sub&gt;vac&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where ''κ'' is [[Einstein's constant]]). It is common to quote values of energy density directly, though still using the name "cosmological constant", with [[Planck units#Gravity|convention]] {{nowrap|1=8''πG'' = 1}}. The true dimension of Λ is a length&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Given the Planck (2018) values of Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt; = {{val|0.6889|0.0056}} and H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = {{val|67.66|0.42|u=(km/s)/Mpc}} = {{val|2.1927664|0.0136|e=-18|u=s-1}}, Λ has the value of

:&lt;math&gt; \Lambda = 1.1056 \times 10^{-52}\, \text{m}^{-2},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Λ is evaluated as {{nowrap|3 (''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/''c'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

or {{val|2.888|e=-122}} in reduced Planck units or {{val|4.33|e=-66}} eV&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in natural units.

A positive vacuum energy density resulting from a cosmological constant implies a negative pressure, and vice versa. If the energy density is positive, the associated negative pressure will drive an accelerated expansion of the universe, as observed. (See [[dark energy]] and [[cosmic inflation]] for details.)

===Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt; (Omega Lambda)===
Instead of the cosmological constant itself, cosmologists often refer to the ratio between the energy density due to the cosmological constant and the [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter|critical density]] of the universe, the tipping point for a sufficient density to stop the universe from expanding forever. This ratio is usually denoted Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt;, and is estimated to be {{val|0.6889|0.0056}}, according to results published by the [[Planck Collaboration]] in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Planck Collaboration|2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a flat universe, Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt; is the fraction of the energy of the universe due to the cosmological constant, i.e., what we would intuitively call the fraction of the universe that is made up of dark energy. Note that this value changes over time: the critical density changes with [[cosmological time]], but the energy density due to the cosmological constant remains unchanged throughout the history of the universe: the amount of dark energy increases as the universe grows, while the amount of matter does not.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Equation of state===
Another ratio that is used by scientists is the [[Equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]], usually denoted ''w'', which is the ratio of pressure that dark energy puts on the universe to the energy per unit volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brumfiel|2007|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ratio is {{nowrap|''w'' {{=}} &amp;minus;1}} for a true cosmological constant, and is generally different for alternative time-varying forms of vacuum energy such as [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]]. The Planck Collaboration (2018) has measured ''w'' = {{val|-1.028|0.032}}, consistent with {{val|-1}}, assuming no evolution in ''w'' over cosmic time.

==Positive value==
[[File:Lambda-Cold Dark Matter, Accelerated Expansion of the Universe, Big Bang-Inflation.jpg|thumb|upright=2.4|Lambda-CDM, accelerated expansion of the universe. The time-line in this schematic diagram extends from the Big Bang/inflation era 13.7 Byr ago to the present cosmological time.]]
Observations announced in 1998 of distance–redshift relation for [[Type Ia supernovae]]&lt;ref name="1998 Discovery"/&gt; indicated that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. When combined with measurements of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] these implied a value of Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 0.7,&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. {{harvp|Baker et al.|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; a result which has been supported and refined by more recent measurements.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Table 9 in {{harvp|The Planck Collaboration|2015a|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are other possible causes of an [[accelerating universe]], such as [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]], but the cosmological constant is in most respects the [[Occam's razor|simplest solution]]. Thus, the current standard model of cosmology, the [[Lambda-CDM model]], includes the cosmological constant, which is measured to be on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−52&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, in metric units.  It is often expressed as 10&lt;sup&gt;−35&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; or 10&lt;sup&gt;−122&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Barrow|Shaw|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other unit systems. The value is based on recent measurements of vacuum energy density, &lt;math&gt; \rho_\text{vacuum} = 5.96 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg/m}^3&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Calculated based on the Hubble constant and &lt;math&gt;\Omega_\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; from {{harvp|The Planck Collaboration|2015b}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 10&lt;sup&gt;−47&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;GeV&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, 10&lt;sup&gt;−29&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in other unit systems.

As was only recently seen, by works of [[Gerardus 't Hooft|'t Hooft]], [[Leonard Susskind|Susskind]] and others, a positive cosmological constant has surprising consequences, such as a finite maximum [[entropy]] of the observable universe (see the [[holographic principle]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Dyson|Kleban|Susskind|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predictions==

===&lt;span id="Cosmological constant problem"&gt; Quantum field theory &lt;/span&gt;===
{{see also|Cosmological constant problem}}
{{unsolved|physics|Why does the [[zero-point energy]] of the quantum vacuum not cause a large cosmological constant? What cancels it out?}}
A major outstanding [[Unsolved problems in physics|problem]] is that most [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] predict a huge value for the [[quantum fluctuation|quantum vacuum]]. A common assumption is that the [[quantum fluctuation|quantum vacuum]] is equivalent to the cosmological constant. Although no theory exists that supports this assumption, arguments can be made in its favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rugh|Zinkernagel|2001|p=?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such arguments are usually based on [[dimensional analysis]] and [[effective field theory]]. If the universe is described by an effective local quantum field theory down to the [[Planck scale]], then we would expect a cosmological constant of the order of &lt;math&gt;M_{\rm pl}^2&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;6\times 10^{54}\, \text{eV}^2&lt;/math&gt; in natural unit or &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; in reduced Planck unit). As noted above, the measured cosmological constant is smaller than this by a factor of ~10&lt;sup&gt;−120&lt;/sup&gt;. This discrepancy has been called "the worst theoretical prediction in the history of physics!".&lt;ref name="CC Problem"/&gt;

Some [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] theories require a cosmological constant that is exactly zero, which further complicates things. This is the [[cosmological constant problem]], the worst problem of [[fine-tuning]] in [[physics]]: there is no known natural way to derive the tiny cosmological constant used in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] from [[particle physics]].

===Anthropic principle===
One possible explanation for the small but non-zero value was noted by [[Steven Weinberg]] in 1987 following the [[anthropic principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Weinberg|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinberg explains that if the vacuum energy took different values in different domains of the universe, then observers would necessarily measure values similar to that which is observed: the formation of life-supporting structures would be suppressed in domains where the vacuum energy is much larger. Specifically, if the vacuum energy is negative and its absolute value is substantially larger than it appears to be in the observed universe (say, a factor of 10 larger), holding all other variables (e.g. matter density) constant, that would mean that the universe is closed; furthermore, its lifetime would be shorter than the age of our universe, possibly too short for intelligent life to form. On the other hand, a universe with a large positive cosmological constant would expand too fast, preventing galaxy formation. According to Weinberg, domains where the vacuum energy is compatible with life would be comparatively rare. Using this argument, Weinberg predicted that the cosmological constant would have a value of less than a hundred times the currently accepted value.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Vilenkin|2006|pages=138–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Weinberg refined this prediction of the cosmological constant to 5 to 10 times the matter density.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Weinberg|1992|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This argument depends on a lack of a variation of the distribution (spatial or otherwise) in the vacuum energy density, as would be expected if dark energy were the cosmological constant. There is no evidence that the vacuum energy does vary, but it may be the case if, for example, the vacuum energy is (even in part) the potential of a scalar field such as the residual [[inflaton]] (also see [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]]). Another theoretical approach that deals with the issue is that of [[multiverse]] theories, which predict a large number of "parallel" universes with different laws of physics and/or values of fundamental constants. Again, the anthropic principle states that we can only live in one of the universes that is compatible with some form of intelligent life. Critics claim that these theories, when used as an explanation for fine-tuning, commit the [[inverse gambler's fallacy]].

In 1995, Weinberg's argument was refined by [[Alexander Vilenkin]] to predict a value for the cosmological constant that was only ten times the matter density,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Vilenkin|2006|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. about three times the current value since determined.

{{reflist|30em|refs=
&lt;ref name="CC Definition"&gt;It may well be that [[dark energy]] is explained by a static cosmological constant, or that this mysterious energy is not constant at all and has changed over time, as in the case with [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]], see for example:
* "Physics invites the idea that space contains energy whose gravitational effect approximates that of Einstein’s cosmological constant, Λ; nowadays the concept is termed dark energy or quintessence." {{harvp|Peebles|Ratra|2003|p=1}}
* "It would then appear that the cosmological fluid is dominated by some sort of fantastic energy density, which has negative pressure, and has just begun to play an important role today. No convincing theory has yet been constructed to explain this state of affairs, although cosmological models based on a dark energy component, such as the cosmological constant (Λ) or quintessence (Q),are leading candidates." {{harvp|Caldwell|2002|p=2}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref name="Rugh 2001 3"&gt;{{harvp|Rugh|Zinkernagel|2001|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Λ = 0?"&gt;On the Cosmological Constant being thought to have zero value see for example:
*"Since the cosmological upper bound on &lt;math&gt;|\left \langle  \rho \right \rangle + \lambda /8 \pi G |&lt;/math&gt; was vastly less than any value expected from particle theory, most particle theorists simply assumed that for some unknown reason this quantity was zero." {{harvp|Weinberg|1989|p=3}}
* "An epochal astronomical discovery would be to establish by convincing observation that Λ is nonzero."{{harvp|Carroll|Press|Turner|1992|p=500}}
* "Before 1998, there was no direct astronomical evidence for Λ and the observational upper bound was so strong – Λ &lt; 10−120 Planck units –that many particle physicists suspected that some fundamental principle must force its value to be precisely zero." {{harvp|Barrow|Shaw|2011|p=1}}
* "The only other natural value is Λ = 0. If Λ really is tiny but not zero, it adds a most stimulating though enigmatic clue to physics to be discovered." {{harvp|Peebles|Ratra|2003|p=333}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="1998 Discovery"&gt;See for example:
* "This is the independent result of two teams. [[Supernova Cosmology Project]] ({{harvp|Perlmutter et al.|1999}}; also see {{harvp|Perlmutter et al.|1998}}) and the [[High-Z Supernova Search Team]] ({{harvp|Riess et al.|1998}}; also see {{harvp|Schmidt et al.|1998}})" {{harvp|Weinberg|2015|p=376}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Biggest Blunder"&gt;There is some debate over whether Einstein labelled the cosmological constant his “biggest blunder”, with all references being traced back to a single person, [[George Gamow]] (See {{harvs|txt|last1=Gamow|year1=1956|year2=1970}}) . For example:
* "Astrophysicist and author Mario Livio can find no documentation that puts those words into Einstein's mouth (or, for that matter, his pen). Instead, all references eventually lead back to one man, physicist George Gamow, who reported Einstein's use of the phrase in two sources: his posthumously published autobiography My World Line (1970) and a Scientific American article from September 1956." {{harvp|Rosen|2013}}
* " We also find it quite plausible that Einstein made such a statement to Gamow in particular. We conclude that there is little doubt that Einstein came to view the introduction of the cosmological constant a serious error, and that it is very plausible that he labelled the term his “biggest blunder” on at least one occasion" {{harvp|O'Raifeartaigh|Mitton|2018|p=1}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="CC Problem"&gt;See for example:
*"Theoretical expectations for the cosmological constant exceed observational limits by some 120 orders of magnitude." {{harvp|Weinberg|1989|p=1}}
*"This, as we will see later, is approximately 120 orders of magnitude larger then what is allowed by observation." {{harvp|Carroll|Press|Turner|1992|p=503}}
*"This gives an answer about 120 orders of magnitude higher than the upper limits on Λ set by cosmological observations. This is probably the worst theoretical prediction in the history of physics!" {{harvp|Hobson|Efstathiou|Lasenby|2006|p=187}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="CC Problem 3"&gt;See for example:
*"the vacuum holds the key to a full understanding of nature" {{harvp|Davies|1985|p=104}}
*"The theoretical problem of explaining the cosmological constant is one of the greatest challenges of theoretical physics. It is most likely that we require a fully developed theory of quantum gravity (perhaps superstring theory) before we can understand Λ." {{harvp|Hobson|Efstathiou|Lasenby|2006|p=188}}

This is a list of criminal (or arguably, allegedly, or potentially criminal) acts intentionally involving [[radioactive]] substances. Inclusion in this list does not necessarily imply that anyone involved was guilty of a crime. For accidents or crimes that involved radioactive substances unbeknownst to those involved, see the [[Nuclear and radiation accidents|list of radiation accidents]].

==Murder/attempted murder==

===The Karlsruhe plutonium affair===
An unnamed man was convicted of attempting to poison his ex-wife in 2001 with [[plutonium]] stolen from WAK (Wiederaufbereitungsanlage [[Karlsruhe]]), a small scale reprocessing plant where he worked. He did not steal a large amount of plutonium, only rags used for wiping surfaces and a small amount of liquid waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On the 21st of September 2012 a story was posted in various UK newspapers suggesting the existence of an ongoing cover-up by the British Government over the material facts of the case.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}
The report suggests that many aspects of the case may "never see the light of day" due to the significant risk to UK/Russian relations and the implications of the declaration that an act of nuclear terrorism took place on British soil.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Roman Tsepov homicide===

[[Roman Tsepov]], a politically influential Russian who provided security to [[Vladimir Putin]] and others, fell sick on September 11, 2004 after a trip to Moscow, and died on September 24. A [[Autopsy|postmortem]] investigation found a poisoning by an unspecified [[radioactive material]]. He had symptoms similar to [[Aleksandr Litvinenko]].&lt;ref name=timesonline&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2484298,00.html The Putin bodyguard riddle], [[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]], December 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Polonium&gt;[http://www.newspb.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=print&amp;sid=561 Полоний и три Владимира]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Svoboda&gt;[http://www.svobodanews.ru/articlete.aspx?exactdate=20070112175720537 Расследование отравления радиоактивным изотопом Романа Цепова, бывшего телохранителя Анатолия Собчака и Владимира Путина]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Karen Silkwood poisoning allegations===
On November 5, 1974, [[Kerr-McGee]] worker and [[labor union]] activist [[Karen Silkwood]] found herself exposed to [[plutonium-239]] after working to grind and polish plutonium pellets by way of a glovebox to be used in nuclear fuel rods at the [[Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site]] in [[Oklahoma]]. Inspection of the gloves would yield no evidence of external leakage of radioactive contaminant from the glovebox, despite the fact that plutonium had been found on those surfaces of the gloves that had contact with Silkwood's hands, and no other source for a plutonium leak could be ascertained despite thorough inspections of the air vents and surrounding surfaces. However, on November 6, despite Silkwood's prior decontamination and self-inspection, a detection on her part the next day yielded more signs of alpha activity on her hands, while health physics staff at the plant subsequently detected further alpha activity on her right forearm, neck and face. On November 7, Silkwood tested positive for very significant levels of alpha activity, and an inspection of her apartment showed high levels of radioactive contamination. Thereafter, Silkwood and two other co-workers personally associated with her (roommate Sherri Ellis and boyfriend Drew Stephens) would be tested at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]; while the latter two only tested positive for insignificant amounts of plutonium exposure, Silkwood was found to have {{convert|6-7|nCi|Bq|lk=on}} of plutonium-239 in her lungs, though researcher Dr. George Voelz insisted that this amount was still negligible and non-harmful. Later posthumous measurements taken after Silkwood's death under separate but likewise controversial circumstances were shown to be roughly consistent with the initial findings described by Dr. Voelz, but also indicated that she had somehow ingested plutonium prior to her demise. It would also be found that Karen Silkwood would not have had access to plutonium-239 for months after her transfer from metallography to rod assembly.

Allegations that Silkwood's exposure to plutonium-239 was a deliberate act of radiation poisoning are fueled by the fact that she was in possession of potentially compromising evidence that linked Kerr-McGee with egregious safety violations, encompassing unsafe workplace conditions at the plant, faulty manufacture of fuel rod components that posed a potential public safety risk, and even substantial missing plutonium supplies that were unaccounted for; Silkwood also contended that she had evidence that photographs containing evidence of hairline cracks in the fuel rods may have been doctored by company personnel as a cover-up. As Silkwood was coordinating with fellow union members and had been ''en route'' to meet a journalist to present and discuss evidence she had found of Kerr-McGee's actions at the time of her death, unverified assertions that Kerr-McGee or other associated parties may have been involved in her radiation exposure and later fatal car accident have circulated in the following period.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web

==Intentional or attempted theft of radioactive material==

For accidental theft or attempted theft of radioactive materials, see the [[Nuclear and radiation accidents|list of radiation accidents]].

===Grozny cobalt theft or attempted theft===

On 13 September 1999, six people attempted to steal radioactive [[cobalt-60]] rods from a chemical plant in the city of [[Grozny]] in the Chechen Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the theft, the suspects opened the radioactive material container and handled it, resulting in the deaths of three of the suspects and injury of the remaining three. The suspect who held the material directly in his hands died of radiation exposure 30 minutes later. This incident is described as an attempted theft, but some of the rods are reportedly still missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web

==Official use of X-ray equipment and other radiation technology by secret police==
Some former [[East German]] dissidents claim that the [[Stasi]] used [[X-ray]] equipment to induce [[cancer]] in [[political prisoner]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Similarly, some anti-[[Fidel Castro|Castro]] activists claim that the Cuban secret police sometimes used radioactive isotopes to induce cancer in "adversaries they wished to destroy with as little notice as possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jonathan T. |last=Stride |title=Castro said to be using cancer instigating weapons for warfare |publisher=[[Florida International University]] |date=30 December 1997 |url=http://www.fiu.edu/~fcf/cancercastro123097.html |accessdate=2006-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060918073336/http://www.fiu.edu/~fcf/cancercastro123097.html |archivedate=September 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the Cuban expatriate columnist [[Carlos Alberto Montaner]] called this method "the Bulgarian Treatment", after its alleged use by the [[Bulgaria]]n secret police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Montaner |first=Carlos Alberto |title=The Bulgarian Treatment |publisher=Firmas Press |date=28 December 1997 |url=http://www.firmaspress.com/726.htm |accessdate=2006-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205111134/http://www.firmaspress.com/726.htm |archivedate=December 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illicit, fraudulent, and patent medicine==
In the early 20th century a series of products claiming medicinal properties, which contained radioactive elements were marketed to the general public. This does not include certain medications that contain radioactive isotopes (e.g. [[iodine-131]] for its oncological uses) but pertains to elixirs and other medications that made preposterous claims (see below) that were neither scientific nor verifiable.

[[Radithor]], a well known [[patent medicine]]/[[snake oil]], is possibly the best known example of [[radioactive quackery]]. It consisted of triple distilled water{{clarify|date=January 2013}} containing at a minimum {{convert|1|µCi|kBq}} each of the [[radium]]-226 and radium-228 isotopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = Radithor (ca. 1918).

 | url = http://www.orau.org/ptp/collection/quackcures/radith.htm
 | accessdate = 2006-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radithor was manufactured from 1918 - 1928 by the Bailey Radium Laboratories, Inc., of [[East Orange, New Jersey]]. The head of the laboratories was listed as Dr. William J. A. Bailey, not a medical doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | title = U/A
 | journal = [[Literary Digest]]
 | date = 16 April 1932 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was advertised as "A Cure for the Living Dead"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

These radium elixirs were marketed similar to the way opiates were peddled to the masses with [[laudanum]] an age earlier, and electrical cure-alls during the same time period such as the [[Prostate Warmer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = Prostate Cures

The eventual death of the socialite [[Eben Byers]] from Radithor consumption and the associated [[radiation poisoning]] led to the strengthening of the Food and Drug Administration's powers and the demise of most radiation based patent medication.

{{About|dating violence in general|teen-specific dating violence|Teen dating violence}}
'''Dating abuse''' or '''dating violence''' is defined as the perpetration or threat of an act of [[violence]] by at least one member of an unmarried couple on the other member within the context of [[dating]] or [[courtship]]. It is also when one partner tries to maintain [[Abusive power and control|power and control over the other through abuse/violence]].  This abuse/violence can take a number of forms: [[sexual assault]], [[sexual harassment]], threats, physical violence, [[verbal abuse|verbal]], mental, or [[emotional abuse]], social sabotage, and [[stalking]].  It can include [[psychological abuse]], [[emotional blackmail]], [[sexual abuse]], [[physical abuse]] and [[psychological manipulation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fcd.ecitizen.gov.sg/FamilyNCommunitySupport/StopFamilyViolence/DatingViolence/WarningSignsOfAbusiveRelationship/ Family and Community Development @eCitizen. Warning Signs of Abusive Relationship]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dating violence crosses all racial, age, economic and social lines.  The Center for Relationship Abuse Awareness describes dating abuse as a "pattern of abusive and coercive behaviors used to maintain power and control over a former or current intimate partner."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stoprelationshipabuse.org/signs.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The Family &amp; Community Development support group at eCitizen in [[Singapore]] has described what it calls tell-tale signs of an abusive relationship.

==Profiles of abuser and victim==
Individuals of all walks of life can find themselves in an abusive relationship.  Abuse can occur regardless of the couple's age, race, income, or other demographic traits.  There are, however, many traits that abusers and victims share in common.  

The Centre for Promoting Alternatives to Violence describes abusers as being obsessively [[jealous]] and possessive, overly confident, having mood swings or a history of violence or temper, seeking to isolate their partner from family, friends and colleagues, and having a tendency to blame external stressors.&lt;ref&gt;Centre for Promoting Alternatives to Violence http://www.pavecentre.org.sg/&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, victims of relationship abuse share many traits as well, including: physical signs of injury, missing time at work or school, slipping performance at work or school, changes in mood or personality, increased use of drugs or alcohol, and increasing isolation from friends and family.&lt;ref name="Dating Violence, ACADV"&gt;[http://www.acadv.org/dating.html#signs Dating Violence, (ACADV)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Victims may [[Blame#Self-blame|blame]] themselves for any abuse that occurs or may [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimize]] the severity of the crime.  This often leads to victims choosing to stay in abusive relationships.

Strauss (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Murray A. (2005) "[http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/VB33R%20Women%27s%20Violence%20Toward%20Men.pdf Women's Violence Towards Men Is A Serious Social Problem]." In D.R. Loeske, et al., eds. ''Current controversies in family violence.'' Newbery Park: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that while men inflict the greater share of injuries in domestic violence, researchers and society at large must not overlook the substantial minority of injuries inflicted by women. Additionally, Strauss notes that even relatively minor acts of physical aggression by women are a serious concern:

:'Minor' assaults perpetrated by women are also a major problem, even when they do not result in injury, because they put women in danger of much more severe retaliation by men. [...] It will be argued that in order to end 'wife beating,' it is essential for women also to end what many regard as a 'harmless' pattern of slapping, kicking, or throwing something at a male partner who persists in some outrageous behavior and 'won't listen to reason.'

Similarly, [[Deborah Capaldi]] &lt;ref&gt;"quoted in Sacks, Glenn. (2009) [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/glenn-sacks/researcher-says-womens-in_b_222746.html Researcher Says Women's Initiation of Domestic Violence Predicts Risk to Women]." on HuffingtonPost.com, 6 July 2009. URL retrieved 9 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; reports that a 13-year longitudinal study found that a woman's aggression towards a man was equally important as the man's tendency towards violence in predicting the likelihood of overall violence: "Since much IPV [Intimate Partner Violence] is mutual and women as well as men initiate IPV, prevention and treatment approaches should attempt to reduce women's violence as well as men's violence. Such an approach has a much higher chance of increasing women's safety."  However, Capaldi's research only focused on at-risk youth, not women in general, and, therefore, may not apply to the entire population.

{{Soviet Union sidebar | expanded=History}}
{{Leonid Brezhnev series}}
The '''Era of Stagnation''' ({{lang-ru|Период застоя}}, '''Stagnation Period''', also called the '''Brezhnevian Stagnation''') was the period in the history of the [[Soviet Union]] which began [[History of the Soviet Union (1964–82)|during the rule]] of [[Leonid Brezhnev]] (1964–1982) and continued under [[Yuri Andropov]] (1982–1984) and [[Konstantin Chernenko]] (1984–1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rs.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Era of Stagnation" was coined by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in order to describe the negative way in which he viewed the economic, political, and social policies of the period.{{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|pp=1–2}}

==Terminology==
During the period of Brezhnev's leadership, the term "Era of Stagnation" was not used. Instead Brezhnev used the term "period of [[developed socialism]]" (Russian: период развитого социализма) for the period which started in 1971. This term stemmed from Khrushchev's promise in 1961 of reaching [[communism in 20 years]].{{sfn|Dowlah|Elliott|1997|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qR9jm_67uo4C&amp;pg=PA148 148–149]}} It was in the 1980s that the Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] coined the term "Era of Stagnation" to describe the economic difficulties that developed when [[Leonid Brezhnev]] [[History of the Soviet Union (1964–1982)|ruled the Soviet Union]] from 1964 to 1982.{{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|p=1}} Scholars have subsequently disagreed on the dates, significance and causes of the stagnation. Supporters of Gorbachev have criticised Brezhnev, and the Brezhnev administration in general, for being too conservative and failing to change with the times.{{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|p=2}}

==History==
The [[History of the Soviet Union (1964–82)|1964–82 period in the Soviet Union]] began hopefully but devolved into disillusionment. Social stagnation began following Brezhnev's rise to power, when he revoked several of the relatively liberal reforms of his predecessor, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], and partially rehabilitated [[Stalinist]] policies. Some commentators regard the start of social stagnation as being the [[Sinyavsky–Daniel trial]] in 1966, which marked the end of [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[Khrushchev Thaw|"Thaw"]],{{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|p=143}} while others place it at the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|suppression]] of the [[Prague Spring]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Bischof, Günter |author2=Karner, Stefan |author3=Ruggenthaler, Peter | title = The Prague Spring and the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 | location = | publisher = [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-0-7391-4304-9 | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=EquVE6gEB6AC&amp;pg=PA92 92] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The period's political stagnation is associated with the establishment of [[gerontocracy]], which came into being as part of the policy of stability.

The majority of scholars set the starting year for economic stagnation at 1975, although some claim that it began as early as the 1960s. Industrial growth rates declined during the 1970s as [[heavy industry]] and the [[arms industry]] were prioritized while [[Consumer goods in the Soviet Union|Soviet consumer goods]] were neglected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1964-1982 - The Period of Stagnation|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/cccp-history-period-of-stagnation.htm||website=GlobalSecurity.org|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value of all consumer goods manufactured in 1972 in retail prices was about 118 billion rubles ($530 billion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VV2irCX9gfAC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=ussr+output+ruble&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yHe6_r3fE1&amp;sig=BCWivRx82h4wG0DFSvUYYRO0qU0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=ussr%20output%20ruble&amp;f=false|title=The Reconstructed 1972 Input-output Tables for Eight Soviet Republics (Manufactured goods sector was worth 118 billion rubles in 1972)|author=James W. Gillula|date=1983|publisher=U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historians, scholars, and specialists are uncertain what caused the stagnation, with some arguing that the [[command economy]] suffered from systemic flaws which inhibited growth. Others have argued that the lack of reform, or the high expenditures on the military, led to stagnation.

Brezhnev has been criticised posthumously for doing too little to improve the economic situation. Throughout his rule, no major reforms were initiated and the few proposed reforms were either very modest or opposed by the majority of the Soviet leadership. The reform-minded [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]] (Government), [[Alexei Kosygin]], introduced two modest reforms in the 1970s after the failure of his more radical [[1965 Soviet economic reform|1965 reform]], and attempted to reverse the trend of declining growth. By the 1970s, Brezhnev had consolidated enough power to stop any "radical" reform-minded attempts by Kosygin.

When [[Death and state funeral of Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev died in November 1982]], the Soviet Union [[Legacy of Leonid Brezhnev|he handed over]] to his successor, [[Yuri Andropov]], was much less dynamic than when he assumed power. During his short rule, Andropov introduced modest reforms; he died little more than a year later in February 1984. [[Konstantin Chernenko]], his successor, continued much of Andropov's policies. The economic problems that began under Brezhnev persisted into these short administrations and scholars still debate whether the reform policies that were followed improved the economic situation in the country.

The Era of Stagnation ended with Gorbachev's rise to power during which political and social life was democratised&lt;ref name="KHA"&gt;

These were intended to re-energize the Soviet Union but inadvertently led to its [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution]] in 1991.

[[Robert Service (historian)|Robert Service]], author of the ''History of Modern Russia: From Tsarism to the Twenty-first Century'', claims that with mounting economic problems worker discipline decreased,{{sfn|Service|2009|p=416}} which the Government could not counter effectively because of the full employment policy. According to Service, this policy led to government industries, such as factories, mines and offices, being staffed by undisciplined and unproductive personnel ultimately leading to a "work-shy workforce" among Soviet workers and administrators.{{sfn|Service|2009|p=417}} While the Soviet Union under Brezhnev had the "second greatest industrial capacity" after the United States, and produced more "steel, oil, pig-iron, cement and [...] tractors" than any other country in the world,{{sfn|Service|2009|p=397}} Service treats the problems of agriculture during the Brezhnev era as proof of the need for [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|decollectivization]].{{sfn|Service|2009|p=402}} In short, Service considers the Soviet economy to have become "static" during this time period,{{sfn|Service|2009|p=407}} and Brezhnev's policy of stability was a "recipe for political disaster".{{sfn|Service|2009|p=409}}

[[Richard Sakwa]], author of the book ''The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Union: 1917–1991'', takes a dimmer view of the Brezhnev era by claiming that growth rates fell "inexorably" from the 1950s until they stopped completely in the 1980s. His reasoning for this stagnation was the growing demand for unskilled workers resulted in a decline of productivity and labour discipline. Sakwa believes that stability itself led to stagnation and claimed that without strong leadership "Soviet socialism had a tendency to relapse into stagnation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = [[Richard Sakwa|Sakwa, Richard]] | title = The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Union: 1917–1991 | location = | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-415-12290-2 | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=EoQXhV8XTFUC&amp;pg=PA339 339] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Edwin Bacon and Mark Sandle, authors of ''Brezhnev Reconsidered'', the economy under Brezhnev was as dynamic as the economy presided over by Nikita Khrushchev, but this dynamism had stalled by the time [[Yuri Andropov]], and subsequently [[Konstantin Chernenko]], became General Secretary.{{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|p=38}} Mark Harrison claims that the economic performance of the Brezhnev era has not been looked at objectively as analysis of the period sometimes used lower estimates.{{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|pp=43–44}} Harrison further claims that in the period between 1928 and 1973 the Soviet economy grew in a phase that would surpass the United States "one day". During the [[1973 oil crisis|international oil crisis]], growth in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc halted abruptly and stalled for a longer period than in the [[Western Bloc|West]]{{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|pp=44–45}} causing the economy to begin stagnating.{{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|p=47}} One explanation, according to Harrison, is that the Soviet economy could not sustain its [[extensive growth]] patterns.{{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|p=53}} Other explanations include: the lack of Soviet, and communist bloc, transparency with other nations hindering [[globalisation]]{{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|pp=50–51}} and misinterpretation of a "permanent" [[Post–World War II economic expansion|post–World War II economic boom]] leading to faulty economic decisions.{{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|p=54}} He claims that the economic policies of Andropov, and Chernenko, had improved the economic situation in the country and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] inherited a more dynamic and vibrant economy in a "pre-crisis situation" where the economy was still growing with low internal and external debts, compared to the economy that Andropov and Chernenko inherited.{{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|p=63}}

[[Archie Brown]], author of ''The Rise and Fall of Communism'', claims in his book that the term Era of Stagnation "was in many ways a fitting description, for this was a period of declining growth", but noted it could be misleading in non-economic spheres.{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=398}} Brown states there were high growth rates in the mid-to-late 1960s (during the [[Eighth Five-Year Plan (Soviet Union)|Eighth Five-Year Plan]]) claiming that the Soviet economy "enjoyed stronger growth in the second half of the 1960s than it ever did thereafter". The link between these growth rates and the Kosygin reform is, according to Brown, "tenuous",{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=403}} but says that "From the point of view of communist rulers, the Brezhnev era was in many ways successful".{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=415}} While the Soviet Union was in no way an economic power, its [[natural resource]]s provided a strong economic foundation, which bore fruit during the 1973 oil crisis and "turned out to be an energy bonanza".{{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|pp=415–416}} On the other hand, Brown states it was a sign of weakness that the Soviet Union grew so dependent on her natural resources, as she did in the 1970s.{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=415}}
[[File:Kossygin Glassboro.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Scholars are generally unsure as to what effect the [[1965 Soviet economic reform|"Kosygin reform"]], named after its initiator [[Alexei Kosygin]], had on economic growth]]
Philip Hanson, author of ''The Rise and Fall of the Soviet economy: an Economic History of the USSR from 1945'', claims that the label stagnation is not "entirely unfair". Brezhnev, according to Hanson, did preside over a period of slowdown in economic growth, but claims that the era started with good growth that was at a higher rate than during the end of Khrushchev's rule. Economic slowdown began in 1973 "when even the official estimates began to show Soviet per capita production no longer closing the gap with the US." Before 1973, there was a reform period launched by [[Alexei Kosygin]], which many believed would become as [[Prague Spring|radical as those]] in the [[Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia]] and the previous reform [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|attempts in Hungary]].{{sfn|Hanson|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=W849vz7w-YMC&amp;pg=PA98 98]}} According to Hanson, many assumed that growth during the Brezhnev era did not stop but started to stagnate.{{sfn|Hanson|2003|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=W849vz7w-YMC&amp;pg=PA98 98–99]}} However, not everything stagnated as per capita consumption grew by 1.9% during the 1970s, which is a "highly respectable rate" of growth. Another point which Hanson makes is that, in contrast to the repressive policies of [[Joseph Stalin]] and instability-inducing policies of Khrushchev, the Brezhnev era was stable and a "period of (comparative) plenty".{{sfn|Hanson|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=W849vz7w-YMC&amp;pg=PA99 99]}}

[[Robert Vincent Daniels]] in his book, ''Russia's Transformation: Snapshots of a Crumbling System'', claimed that the hallmark of the Brezhnev era was the ''[[status quo]]'', which in turn led to the development of a great ''[[paradox]]''; "the contradictions of what it was and what it could be became obvious". Net growth, in excess of 50% and as high as two thirds, was primarily in the urban sector resulting in high population growth and urban growth higher than that of the United States. Industrial development continued to grow rapidly, and in certain sectors surpassed the United States.{{sfn|Daniels|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KUjnEP9vr_0C&amp;pg=PA46 46]}} As an example, coal production in the Soviet Union increased from 85 million metric tons in 1964 to 149 million metric tons in 1981 while in the United States it grew from 100 million to 130 million metric tons in the same period.{{sfn|Daniels|1998|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KUjnEP9vr_0C&amp;pg=PA47 47–48]}} The Soviet Union became the largest exporter of petroleum in the world and by the end of the [[Tenth Five-Year Plan (Soviet Union)|Tenth Five-Year Plan]] (1976–1981) the Soviet GNP "reached about 60% of the American level, and the net current investment was actually greater in absolute terms". The failure then, according to Daniels, was that the Soviet economy was not able to deliver in certain sectors; agriculture is a sector where this failure occurred. Throughout Soviet history, deficiencies in agriculture and consumer goods always existed. During Brezhnev's reign, the Soviet Union became the largest producer of wheat in the world but was unable to produce meat in sufficient quantities.{{sfn|Daniels|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KUjnEP9vr_0C&amp;pg=PA47 47]}} According to Daniels, the economy began to stagnate in 1975 rather than 1973 and that the following period contradicted the previous one "in almost every way".{{sfn|Daniels|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KUjnEP9vr_0C&amp;pg=PA49 49]}}

The research in [[second economy in the Soviet Union]], pioneered by [[Gregory Grossman]],  indicated that during 1970s-1980s the effects of the [[central planning]] were progressively distorted due to the rapid growth of the shadow economy. It is suggested that failure to account for it by [[Gosplan]] contributed to the stagnation, and ultimately to the collapse of the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet economy]].&lt;ref name=treale&gt;Vladimir G. Treml and Michael V. Alexeev, [https://www.ucis.pitt.edu/nceeer/1993-900-03-Treml.pdf "The Second Economy And The Destabilizing Effect Of Its Growth On The State Economy In The Soviet Union : 1965-1989"], Berkeley-Duke Occasional Papers On The Second Economy In The Ussr, Paper No. 36, December 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes===
One of the suggested causes of stagnation was the increased military expenditure over [[consumer goods]] and other economic spheres.{{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|p=28}} [[Andrei Sakharov]], the veteran dissident, claimed in a 1980 letter to Brezhnev that the increasing expenditure on the armed forces was stalling economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = [[Dmitri Volkogonov|Volkogonov, Dmitri]]; Shukman, Harold | title = Autopsy for an Empire: The Seven Leaders Who Built the Soviet Regime | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=q6V80unMR1MC&amp;pg=PT262 262] | publisher = [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-684-87112-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, David Michael Kotz and Fred Weir, authors of ''Revolution from Above: The Demise of the Soviet System'', argue that militarisation cannot be the prime cause for the economic stagnation, as military spending had historically been high (17% of [[gross national product|GNP]] in 1950) and had increased on par with economic growth without previously destabilising the economy.

During the [[Nixon Shock]] and the [[1973 oil crisis]], economic growth in the rest of the world plummeted but the Soviet [[hard currency]] earnings grew as a result of oil exports. Following the crisis, overall economic activity decreased markedly in the Soviet Union, the Western Bloc and [[Japan]], but in the Soviet Union it was much more pronounced. Kotz and Weir argued that ultimately, economic stagnation in the Soviet Union could only have been caused by internal problems rather than external.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Kotz, David Michael |author2=Weir, Fred | title = Revolution from Above: The Demise of the Soviet System | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 1997 | isbn = 978-0-415-14317-2 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=GtzRWlv6DggC&amp;pg=PA48 |page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Marxist-Leninist writers have argued that economic stagnation was a result of [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism]] in Soviet economic policy during Khrushchev's leadership. According to authors like [[Harpal Brar]], Khrushchev's [[de-Stalinization]] program was also used to implement economic reforms that would move the USSR away from [[central planning]] and towards [[market socialism]]. This is also supported by comparing economic performance preceding the reforms with post-reform economic performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brar|first1=Harpal|title=Perestroika: The Complete Collapse of Revisionism|date=1992|isbn=187461301X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main causes for Khrushchev's dismissal from power was the relatively poor economic growth during the early 1960s. Overall economic growth was 6% from 1951 to 1955 but had fallen to 5.8% in the subsequent 5 years and to 5% from 1961 to 1965. Labour productivity, which had grown 4.7% from the 1950s to 1962, had declined to 4% by the early 1960s. Growth, capital out and investments were all showing signs of steady decline.{{sfn|Dowlah|Elliot|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qR9jm_67uo4C&amp;pg=PA148 148]}} Another problem was Khrushchev's unrealistic promises such as committing to reach [[communism in 20 years]], a near impossibility with the then-current economic indicators.{{sfn|Dowlah|Elliott|1997|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qR9jm_67uo4C&amp;pg=PA148 148–149]}} Ultimately, as a result of his failure to deliver on his promises and the problems engendered, Khrushchev was dismissed in October 1964{{sfn|Dowlah|Elliot|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qR9jm_67uo4C&amp;pg=PA149 149]}} by a [[collective leadership]] led by [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and [[Alexei Kosygin]]. To counter Khrushchev's promise of reaching communism, the Soviet leadership created the term [[developed socialism]], which meant that the Soviet Union had developed to a sufficiently advanced stage that the country would move "naturally" to communism (in an unspecified amount of time).{{sfn|Dowlah|Elliot|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qR9jm_67uo4C&amp;pg=PA146 146]}}

Khrushchev's dismissal led to the establishment of a more conservative Politburo; Kosygin, [[Nikolai Podgorny]] and [[Andrei Kirilenko (politician)|Andrei Kirilenko]] were the most liberal members, Brezhnev and [[Arvīds Pelše]] belonged to the moderate faction while [[Mikhail Suslov]] retained his leadership of the party's hardliners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Law, David A. | title = Russian Civilization | publisher = Ardent Media | year = 1975 | location= New York | isbn = 0-8422-0529-2 | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=f3ky9qBavl4C&amp;pg=PA221 221] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kosygin and Brezhnev strongly disagreed over economic policy; Kosygin wanted to increase investments in [[Consumer goods in the Soviet Union|consumer goods]] and [[light industry]] whereas Brezhnev wanted to increase investment in [[heavy industry]], agriculture and defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Zemtsov, Ilya | title = Chernenko: The Last Bolshevik: The Soviet Union on the Eve of Perestroika | location = | publisher = [[Transaction Publishers]] | year = 1989 | isbn = 0-88738-260-6 | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=hgscfLr5dCsC&amp;pg=PA86 86] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, Kosygin introduced an economic reform, widely referred to as the [[1965 Soviet economic reform|"Kosygin reform"]], which aimed to reform the [[planned economy]] within a [[socialist]] framework. In a bid to improve the Soviet economy Kosygin copied some of the measures used in the [[Western Bloc]], such as [[Profit (economics)|profit making]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Moss, Walter | title = A History of Russia: Since 1855 | location = London | publisher = Anthem Press | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-1-84331-034-1 | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=yMwdWFtgV0QC&amp;pg=PA431 431] }}&lt;/ref&gt; which Brezhnev agreed to as the Soviet economy was entering a period of low growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Chauhan, Sharad | title = Inside CIA: Lessons in Intelligence | publisher = APH Publishing | year = 2004 | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=rUIauNFQnngC&amp;pg=PA207 207] | isbn = 81-7648-660-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kosygin's reforms on agriculture gave considerable autonomy to the collective farms, giving them the right to the contents of private farming. As a result, during the [[Eighth Five-Year Plan (Soviet Union)|Eighth Five-Year Plan]] (1966–1970), large-scale land reclamation programmes, construction of irrigation channels, and other measures, were enacted.&lt;ref name="RIA"/&gt;{{refn|'''According to Soviet statistics:''' There were significant improvements made in the economy during the [[Eighth Five-Year Plan (Soviet Union)|Eighth Five-Year Plan]] (1966–1970). The economy grew by 7.7% during the Eighth Five-Year Plan, but slowed during the [[Ninth Five-Year Plan (Soviet Union)|Ninth Five-Year Plan]] (1971–1975) and [[Tenth Five-Year Plan (Soviet Union)|Tenth Five-Year Plan]] (1976–1981) when the economy grew by 5.7 and 4.2 respectively.&lt;ref name="RIA"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ria.ru/history_spravki/20101108/293796130.html | title = Советская экономика в эпоху Леонида Брежнева |trans-title=The Soviet economy in the era of Leonid Brezhnev | location = | publisher = [[RIA Novosti]] | date = 8 November 2010 | accessdate = 31 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} Overall, the reform failed and links to any high growth rates during the Eighth Five-Year Plan are considered to be "tenuous".{{sfn|Bacon|Sandle|2002|p=58}}

The Brezhnev era, which had begun with high growth, began to stagnate some time in the early-1970s. Kosygin's "radical" reform attempts were halted in 1971 and his [[1973 Soviet economic reform|second reform]] was more modest. The second reform was halted because of the [[1973 oil crisis]], when an international increase in oil price prompted economic growth based on selling oil. Another reform was [[1979 Soviet economic reform|implemented in 1979]] but this, too, failed as by this time the Soviet economy had become "addicted" to high oil prices.&lt;ref name="RIA"/&gt;

In 1980, [[RIA Novosti]] reported that the Soviet Union showed the highest, in Europe, and second highest, worldwide, industrial and agricultural output. The Soviet statistics claimed that in 1960, the Soviet Union's industrial output was only 55% that of America, but this increased to 80% by 1980.&lt;ref name="RIA"/&gt; The 18 years of Brezhnev's leadership of the Communist Party saw real incomes grow by more than 1.5 times.&lt;ref name="RIA"/&gt; More than 1.6 billion square meters of living space was commissioned and provided to over 160 million people. At the same time, the average rent for families did not exceed 3% of the family income. Housing, health care, and education were affordable and low-priced. As the circulation of the work force could not be balanced by salaries, there was a lack of workers in some areas, largely in the agricultural sector. This was partly solved by forcing "nonproductive" urban population (older pupils, students, scientists, soldiers, etc.) to work during the harvesting time as agricultural workers. The practice has been informally called "naryady na kartoshku" ({{lang-ru|наряды на картошку}} "assignments to potato fields").&lt;ref name="RIA"/&gt;

==Opposition==
Acts of protest took place in reaction to the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] with protesters being dismissed from their jobs, beaten or arrested.&lt;ref name="CH1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memo.ru/history/DISS/chr/chr3.htm|title=Хроника Текущих Событий: выпуск 3|trans-title=Chronicle of Current Events: Issue 3|date=30 August 1968|work=memo.ru|language=ru|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight protesters held a demonstration in [[Red Square]] in Moscow and were subsequently imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Nearly half of Russians ignorant of 1968's Czechoslovakia invasion – poll|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/19/russia-warsaw-pact-1968-invasion-czechoslovakia|newspaper=The Guardian|author=Andrew Roth|date=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of suspected [[dissident]]s had their homes and property searched&lt;ref name="CH2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memo.ru/history/DISS/chr/chr4.htm|title=Хроника Текущих Событий: выпуск 4|trans-title=Chronicle of Current Events: Issue 4|date=31 October 1968|work=memo.ru|language=ru|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a group of Moscow lawyers specialised in defending people charged with [[anti-Soviet]] activity.&lt;ref name=letter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/annals/sakharov/sakharov_english_txt/e014.txt|title=Letter by Andropov to the Central Committee|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311040614/http://www.yale.edu/annals/sakharov/sakharov_english_txt/e014.txt |archive-date=11 March 2007|date=10 July 1970|language=English translation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of these meetings and demonstrations claimed that the arrests were illegal, because there is no criminality in the realization of the human right to obtain and distribute information.

==Art and science==
During the introduction of [[glasnost]], many writers claimed that they did not know about the repression of citizens who did not support the Brezhnev politics.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;[[Sofia Kallistratova]]. We were not silent!&amp;nbsp;– open letter to writer [[Chingiz Aitmatov]], in Russian.
[http://www.memo.ru/library/books/sw/chapt55.htm С. В. Калистратова. Открытое письмо писателю Чингизу Айтматову], 5 мая 1988 г.&lt;/ref&gt; However, artists propagating "Soviet values" within the framework of [[Socialist realism]] formed a well paid, elite group that enjoyed an easy life and high social status.

Nevertheless, a noticeable part of Soviet scientists and artists (collectively known as [[Soviet dissidents|"the dissidents"]]) continued both open and clandestine political opposition to the regime which they began during the Khruschev rule. Prominent [[nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]] [[Andrey Sakharov]] and Soviet Army General [[Pyotr Grigorenko]] are well-known representatives of this movement.

Many other members of the Soviet [[intelligentsia]] systematically criticized the social and moral manifestations of the Stagnation without overtly challenging the authorities. Examples include writers [[Viktor Astafyev]] and [[Oles Honchar]], playwright [[Grigory Gorin]], directors [[Eldar Ryazanov]] and [[Mark Zakharov]].

'''Etretinate''' (trade name '''Tegison''') is a [[medication]] developed by [[Hoffmann–La Roche]] that was approved by the FDA in 1986 to treat severe [[psoriasis]]. It is a second-generation [[retinoid]].&lt;ref name="Mutschler"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Mutschler|first1=Ernst|last2=Schäfer-Korting|first2=Monika|title=Arzneimittelwirkungen|language=German|location=Stuttgart|publisher=Wissenschaftliche Verlagsgesellschaft|year=2001|edition=8|page=728f|isbn=3-8047-1763-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently removed from the [[Canada|Canadian]] market in 1996 and the [[United States]] market in 1998 due to the high risk of birth defects. It remains on the market in Japan as '''Tigason'''.

==Pharmacology==
Etretinate is a highly [[lipophilic]], [[aromatic]] retinoid. It is stored and released from [[adipose tissue]], so its effects can continue long after dosage stops. It is detectable in the plasma for up to three years following therapy. Etretinate has a low [[therapeutic index]] and a long [[elimination half-life]] (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;) of 120 days,&lt;ref name="Mutschler" /&gt; which make dosing difficult.

Etretinate has been replaced by [[acitretin]], the free acid (without the [[ethyl group|ethyl]] ester). While acitretin is less lipophilic and has a half-life of only 50 hours, it is partly metabolized to etretinate in the body,&lt;ref name="Mutschler" /&gt; so that it is still a long-acting [[teratogen]] and pregnancy is prohibited for two years after therapy.&lt;ref name="Austria-Codex"&gt;{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Jasek, W|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2007|edition=62nd|isbn=978-3-85200-181-4|page=5669|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precautions==
*Etretinate is a [[teratogen]], and may cause [[birth defect]]s long after use. Therefore, birth control is advised during therapy, and for at least three years after therapy has stopped.&lt;ref name="MMX" /&gt;
*Etretinate should be avoided in [[children]], as it may interfere with [[bone growth]].&lt;ref name="MMX" /&gt;
*If a patient has ever taken etretinate, he or she is not eligible to [[blood donation|donate blood]] in the United States or the United Kingdom, due to the risk of birth defects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transfusionguidelines.org.uk/index.aspx?Publication=WB&amp;Section=5&amp;PageID=3630&amp;AZLetter=E UK Blood Transfusion and Tissue Transplantation Services]&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, people may not donate blood for two years after ceasing to use the medication.&lt;ref name=JapaneseDrugs/&gt;
*Héma-Québec has a total prohibition of blood donors for those who have taken just once the medication Tegison https://www.hema-quebec.qc.ca/sang/donneur-sang/puis-je-donner/medicaments/medicaments-s-t-u.en.html;jsessionid=DAF99CE10356AD6B8365A20959EEC208

==Side effects==
Side effects are those typical of [[hypervitaminosis A]], most commonly&lt;ref name="MMX" /&gt;
* bone or joint pain, stiffness; in long-term treatment [[diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis]]
* muscular or [[abdominal]] cramps
* dry, burning, itching eyelids

The '''European Hill Climb Championship''' is an [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]]-run motorsport competition held across [[Europe]] on closed public road courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fia.com/championship/european-hill-climb-championship/2013/fia-european-hill-climb-championship |title=FIA European Hill Climb Championship |publisher=Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile |accessdate=16 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217022428/http://www.fia.com/championship/european-hill-climb-championship/2013/fia-european-hill-climb-championship |archivedate=17 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike circuit racing, each driver competes alone, starting from a point at the base of a mountain and reaching a finish point near the summit. The European Championship allows [[Formula racing|single-seater cars]], [[sports car racing|open-cockpit sports prototypes]], and [[touring car racing|touring cars]] with varying degrees of technical preparation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11051">'''Famine scales''' are the ways in which degrees of [[food security]] are measured, from situations in which an entire population has adequate food to full-scale [[famine]].  The word "famine" has highly emotive and political connotations and there has been extensive discussion among international relief agencies offering [[food aid]] as to its exact definition.  For example, in 1998, although [[1998 Sudan famine|a full-scale famine]] had developed in [[southern Sudan]], a disproportionate amount of donor food resources went to the [[Kosovo War]].  This ambiguity about whether or not a famine is occurring, and the lack of commonly agreed upon criteria by which to differentiate food insecurity has prompted renewed interest in offering precise definitions.  As different levels of food insecurity demand different types of response, there have been various methods of famine measurement proposed to help agencies determine the appropriate response.

== Measurement methods ==
A tension that has existed in all attempts to define a famine is between definitions of famine as an event and definitions as a process.  In the first case, famine is defined (roughly) as the event of many people dying of starvation within a locality or region.  In the second, famine is described as a chronology beginning with a disruption or disruptions that gradually leads to widespread death.  However, these general definitions have little utility for those implementing food relief as "region", "widespread", etc. are undefined.

One of the earliest methods of measurement was the [[Indian Famine Codes]] developed by the colonial [[United Kingdom|British]] in the 1880s.  The Famine Codes defined three levels of food insecurity: near-scarcity, scarcity, and famine.   "Scarcity" was defined as three successive years of [[crop failure]], crop yields of one-third or one-half normal, and large populations in distress.  "Famine" further included a rise in [[food]] prices above 140% of "normal", the movement of people in search of food, and widespread mortality.  The Punjab Food Code stated, "Imminence of death is the sole criterion for declaration of famine."  Inherent in the Famine Codes was the assumption that famine was an event, and not a process.

The basic premise of the Famine Codes formed the basis of numerous subsequent [[early warning system]]s.  One of the most efficacious is the [[Turkana District]] Early Warning System in northern [[Kenya]] in which indicators include [[rainfall]] levels, [[market price]]s of [[cereal]]s, status of [[livestock]], [[rangeland]] conditions and trends, and enrollment on food-for-work projects.  The system identifies three levels of crisis: alarm, alert and emergency, each of which is linked to a planned response to mitigate the crisis and try to prevent a worsening of the situation.

International organizations responding to recent food crises created ''ad hoc'' measurements.  In 2002, the [[World Food Programme]] created a number of "pre-famine indicators" for [[Ethiopia]] and combined it with measurements of [[nutrition]] levels to create recommendations.    The [[Food Security Assessment Unit]] (FSAU) devised a system for [[Somalia]] with four levels: Non-alert (near normal), Alert (requires close attention), Livelihood Crisis (basic social structures under threat) and Humanitarian Emergency (threat of widespread mortality requiring immediate [[humanitarian assistance]]).

== Livelihoods strategies ==
The FSAU system is one of several recent systems that draws a distinction between "saving lives" and "saving livelihoods".  Older models concentrated simply on the mortality of famine victims. However, relief agencies gradually realized that the means by which families and individuals supported themselves were threatened first.

Previously famines had been perceived as a threat to individuals, even large numbers of individuals.  Inherent in the livelihoods strategies outlook is the conception of famine as a social problem.  Populations affected by increased food stress will try to cope through market structures (i.e. selling possessions for food) and reliance upon community and family support structures.  It is only when such social structures collapse under the strain that individuals are faced with the malnutrition and starvation that has commonly been viewed as "famine".

During the 1980s and 1990s, studies of the process by which populations adapted to food stress as food security worsened received much attention.  Four stages of the process were identified:
# Reversible strategies, in response to 'normal' food stress, such as rationing food or diversifying [[income]]
# Irreversible strategies in response to prolonged food stress, such as selling breeding livestock or mortgaging land, which trade short-term survival for long-term difficulty
# The failure of internal coping methods and total dependence on external food aid
# Severe malnutrition leading to weakened [[immune system]]s, illness and death, in the event of the failure of the first three levels of coping.  Death caused directly by [[starvation]] forms a fraction of deaths in a famine.

== Nutrition levels ==
Various [[nutrition]] benchmarks have been proposed as the cut-off points for food insecurity levels.  The [[United Nations]] Refugee Nutrition Information System lists a number of such indicator cutoff points:
[[File:Oxfam East Africa - A mass grave for children in Dadaab.jpg|thumb|Freshly-dug graves for child victims of the [[2011 East Africa drought]], [[Dadaab]] refugee camp, [[Kenya]]]]
* Wasting - defined as less than -2 [[standard deviation]]s in body weight, usually for children between six and 59 months
**  5-10% = normal in [[Africa]]n populations in non-[[drought]] conditions
** Greater than 20% = "serious situation"
** Greater than 40% = "severe crisis"
*[[Oedema]] due to [[kwashiorkor]] (swollen belly) is always a "cause for concern"
* Crude mortality rate (CMR), i.e. number of deaths per ten thousand people in a time span
** 1/10,000/day = "serious situation"
** Greater than 2/10,000/day = "emergency out of control"
*Under-five mortality rate (U5MR), i.e. number of deaths of children under five years of age within a time span
** 2/10,000/day = "serious situation"
** 4/10,000/day = "emergency out of control"

The use of these cut-offs is contentious.  Some argue that a crude mortality rate of one death per ten thousand people per day is already a full-scale emergency.  Others note that while most indicators are focused on children, parents will often reduce their own food consumption in favor of their children.  Child malnutrition may thus be a [[trailing indicator]], indicating non-emergency levels even after adult malnutrition has reached crisis levels.  It has also been noted that malnutrition is often not directly related to food availability; malnutrition is often the result of disease or poor child-care practices, even with adequate food availability.

== Combined intensity and magnitude scales ==
In an influential paper published in 2004, Paul Howe and Stephen Devereux, both of the [[Institute of Development Studies]] at the [[University of Sussex]], set forth a measurement of famine with scales for both "intensity" and "magnitude", incorporating many of the developments of recent decades.  The intensity scale is:

{| class="wikitable"
!Level
!Phrase
!Lives
!Livelihood
|-
|0
|Food secure
|Crude Mortality Rate (CMR) &lt; 0.2/10,000/day and/or Wasting &lt; 2.3%
|Cohesive social system; food prices stable; Coping strategies not utilized
|-
|1
|Food insecure
|0.2 &lt;= CMR &lt;0.5/10,000/day and/or 2.3% &lt;= Wasting &lt; 10%
|Cohesive social system; Food prices unstable; Seasonal shortages; Reversible coping strategies taken
|-
|2
|Food crisis
|0.5 &lt;= CMR &lt; 1/10,000/day, 10% &lt;= Wasting &lt; 20%, and/or prevalence of oedema
|Social system stressed but largely cohesive; Dramatic rise in food and basic items prices; Adaptive mechanisms begin to fail; Increase in irreversible coping strategies
|-
|3
|Famine
|1 &lt;= CMR &lt; 5/10,000/day, 20% &lt;= Wasting &lt; 40%, and/or prevalence of oedema
|Clear signs of social breakdown; [[Market (economics)|market]]s begin to collapse; coping strategies exhausted and survival strategies (migration in search of help, abandonment of weaker members of the community) adopted; affected population identifies food scarcity as the major societal problem
|-
|4
|Severe famine
|5 &lt;= CMR &lt;15/10,000/day, Wasting &gt;= 40%, and/or prevalence of oedema
|Widespread social breakdown; markets close; survival strategies widespread; affected population identifies food scarcity as the major societal problem
|-
|5
|Extreme famine
|CMR &gt;= 15/10,000/day
|Complete social breakdown; widespread mortality; affected population identifies food scarcity as the major societal problem 
|}

On the magnitude scale:
{| class="wikitable"
!Category
!Phrase
!Mortality range
|-
|A
|Minor famine
|0-999
|-
|B
|Moderate famine
|1,000-9,999
|-
|C
|Major famine
|10,000-99,999
|-
|D
|Great famine
|100,000-999,999
|-
|E
|Catastrophic famine
|1,000,000 and over
|}

Using this framework, each famine would receive a Magnitude designation, but locations within the affected region would be classified at varying Intensities.  The [[1998 Sudan famine|1998 southern Sudan famine]] would be a C: Major Famine, with an intensity of 5: Extreme famine in [[Ajiep]] village ranging to 3: Famine in [[Rumbek]] town.  In comparison, the 2000 Ethiopian famine in [[Gode]] district would be classified as a B: Moderate famine, and would thus should demand proportionally less of the limited resources available for famine relief.

While each organization working in famine-related areas has its own operational interpretation of specific indicators, the Howe-Devereaux framework has been widely adopted as a common framework by which famine warning and famine relief may be discussed worldwide, in particular in the use of the intensity scale.  This has led organizations such as the World Food Programme to refrain from referring to the [[2005 Niger food crisis]] as a famine, as indicators had not deteriorated into a Level 3: Famine.

'''Ganser syndrome''' is a rare [[dissociative disorder]] characterized by [[nonsensical]] or wrong answers to questions and other dissociative symptoms such as [[fugue state|fugue]], [[amnesia]] or [[conversion disorder]], often with visual [[pseudohallucination]]s and a decreased [[state of consciousness]].&lt;ref name=”Whit”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The syndrome has also been called nonsense syndrome, balderdash syndrome, syndrome of approximate answers, hysterical pseudodementia or prison psychosis. The term prison psychosis is sometimes used because the syndrome occurs most frequently in prison inmates, where it may be seen as an attempt to gain leniency from prison or court officials. Psychological symptoms generally resemble the patient's sense of mental illness rather than any recognized category. The syndrome may occur in persons with other mental disorders such as [[schizophrenia]], [[depressive disorder]]s, [[Substance intoxication|toxic]] states, [[paresis]], [[alcohol abuse|alcohol use disorders]] and [[factitious disorders]].&lt;ref name=”Kno”&gt;Knoblosh, F. (1986). Ganser Syndrome and DSM-III. American Journal of Psychiatry, 143(3), 393-393.&lt;/ref&gt; Ganser syndrome can sometimes be diagnosed as merely malingering, but it is more often defined as [[dissociative disorder]].&lt;ref  name=”Kno”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
==Overview==
The discovery of Ganser syndrome is attributed to [[Sigbert Josef Maria Ganser]] (24 January 1853–4 January 1931). In 1898, he described the disorder in prisoners awaiting trial in a penal institution in Halle, [[Germany]]. He named impaired consciousness and distorted communication, namely in the form of approximate answers (also referred to as Vorbeireden in literature), as the defining symptoms of the syndrome.&lt;ref name=”Whit”&gt;Whitlock, F.A. (1967). The Ganser Syndrome. The British Journal of Psychiatry, 113(494), 19-29. {{doi|10.1192/bjp.113.494.19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vorbeireden involves the inability to answer questions precisely, although the content of the questions is understood.&lt;ref name=”We”&gt;Weiner, H.; Brainman, A. (1955). The Ganser Syndrome: A Review and Addition of Some Unusual Cases. American Journal of Psychiatry, 111(10), 767-773. {{doi|10.1176/ajp.111.10.767}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Ganser syndrome is described as a [[Dissociative Disorder Not Otherwise Specified]] (NOS) in the [[DSM-IV]], and is not currently listed in the [[DSM-V]]. It is a rare and an often overlooked clinical phenomenon. In most cases, it is preceded by extreme stress and followed by [[amnesia]] for the period of psychosis.&lt;ref name=”We”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to approximate answers, other symptoms include a [[clouding of consciousness]], somatic [[conversion disorder]] symptoms, confusion, stress, loss of personal identity, [[echolalia]], and [[echopraxia]].

==Diagnosis==
Ganser syndrome was listed under [[Factitious Disorder]] with Psychological Symptoms in the [[DSM-III]].&lt;ref name=”APA3”&gt;American Psychiatric Association. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. 3rd ed. Washington, DC. American Psychiatric Association, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; The criteria of this category emphasized symptoms that cannot be explained by other mental disorders, psychological symptoms under the control of the individual, and the goal of assuming a patient role, not otherwise understandable given their circumstances.&lt;ref name=”APA3”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The [[DSM-IV-TR]] classified Ganser syndrome as a dissociative disorder defined by the giving of approximate answers to questions (e.g. '2 plus 2 equals 5' when not associated with dissociative amnesia or dissociative fugue).&lt;ref name=”APA4”&gt;American Psychiatric Association. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. 4th ed. Text rev. Washington, DC. American Psychiatric Association, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ICD-10]]&lt;ref name=”ICD”&gt;World Health Organization. (1992). The ICD-10 classification of mental and behavioural disorders: Clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines. Geneva: World Health Organization.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[DSM-IV]] do not specify any diagnostic criteria apart from approximate answers, as a requirement for a Ganser syndrome diagnosis.&lt;ref name=”APA4”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Most case studies of the syndrome also depend on the presence of approximate answers and at least one of the other symptoms described by Ganser in his original paper.&lt;ref name=”We”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Usually when giving wrong answers, individuals are only slightly off, showing that the individual understood the question&lt;ref name=”Bro”&gt;Bromberg, W. (1986). The neglect of Ganser Syndrome. The American Journal of Psychiatry, 143(7), 937-938.&lt;/ref&gt;For instance, when asked how many legs a horse has, they might say, "five." Although subjects appear confused in their answers, in other respects they appear to understand their surroundings.&lt;ref name=”Bro”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesia, loss of personal identity, and clouding of consciousness were among the most common symptoms apart from approximate answers.&lt;ref name=”We”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Although there is currently no uniform way to diagnose the syndrome, a full neurological and mental state examination is recommended to determine its presence as well as tests that assess malingering.&lt;ref name=”Ep”&gt;Epstein, R.S. (1991). Ganser Syndrome, Trance Logic, and the Question of Malingering. Psychiatric Annals, 21(4), 238-244. {{doi|10.3928/0048-5713-19910401-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to mental examination, other investigations should be done to exclude other underlying causes. These include [[computer tomography]] scans (CT) or [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) scans to exclude structural pathology, lumbar puncture to exclude meningitis or encephalitis, and [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), to exclude delirium or seizure disorder.&lt;ref name=”Dw”&gt;Dwyer, J.; Reid, S. (2004). Ganser’s Syndrome. Lancet, 364(9432), 471-473. {{doi|10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16772-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Diagnosing Ganser syndrome is challenging because of its rarity and symptom variability. The manifested symptoms may be dependent on the individual’s conception of what mental illness entails, creating the possibility of a wide range of combinations of symptoms present in an individual with Ganser syndrome.&lt;ref name=”Ep”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
==Prevalence and Etiology==

With about 100 cases studies, the incidence of the disorder is not precisely known.&lt;ref name=”Dw”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals of multiple backgrounds have been reported as having the disorder. The syndrome tends to be more common in men (75%), with a male to female ratio of 4:1.&lt;ref name=”Whit”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It has been most frequently seen in individuals ages 15 to 40 and has also been observed in children.&lt;ref name=”Mill”&gt;Miller, P.; Bramble, D.; Buxton, N. (1997). Case Study: Ganser Syndrome in Children and Adolescents. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 36(1), 112-115. {{doi|10.1097/00004583-199701000-00024}}&lt;/ref&gt; This wide age range is derived from case studies, and therefore may not be an accurate estimate. Ganser syndrome has also been observed in groups other than prison populations.&lt;ref&gt; name=”Whit”&lt;/ref&gt;
 
To date, no definitive cause or reason of the disorder has been established.&lt;ref name=”Men”&gt;Mendis, S.; Hodgson, R.E. (2012). Ganser Syndrome: examining the aetiological debate through a systematic case report review. European Journal of Psychiatry, 26(2). {{doi|10.4321/S0213-61632012000200003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sources that classify the syndrome as a dissociative disorder&lt;ref name=”ICD”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or a factitious disorder, conflict in their proposed etiologies. As a result, there are a number of theories as to why the syndrome develops. 
 
Ganser syndrome was previously classified as a [[factitious disorder]], explaining the symptoms as mimicking of what patients perceive as typical of a psychosis, even though they are not really sick.&lt;ref name=”Ep”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, the DSM-IV placed the syndrome under “Dissociative Disorders Not Otherwise Specified.”&lt;ref name=”APA4”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There has been evidence of a strong correlation between approximate answers and amnesia, suggesting that these have an underlying dissociative mechanism.&lt;ref name=”Coco”&gt;Cocores, J.A.; Santa, W.G.; Patel L, MD. (1985). The Ganser Syndrome: Evidence Suggesting its Classification as a Dissociative Disorder. The International Journal of Psychiatry in Medicine, 14(1), 47-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Ganser’s syndrome and Dissociative Disorders have been linked to histories of hysteria, psychosis, conversion, multiple personality and possible feigning.&lt;ref name=”Coco”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the condition’s etiology remains under question due to associations with established psychiatric disorders, as well as organic states. 
 
According to Stern and Whiles (1942), Ganser syndrome is a fundamentally psychotic illness.&lt;ref name=”Whit”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As evidence, they describe the case of a woman suffering from recurrent mania and a head injury before being submitted to treatment and the report of a schizophrenic male who suffered from alcoholism and had recently been in prison.&lt;ref name=”Whit”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Ganser syndrome is also sometimes referred to as “prison psychosis,” emphasizing its prevalence among prisoners, generating discussion about whether the disorder only appears in this population.&lt;ref name=”Whit”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of prisoners, Estes and New concluded that escaping an intolerable situation, such as being incarcerated, prompted the syndrome’s key symptoms, touching on the malingering controversy surrounding the syndrome, as well as the stress component that often precedes the disorder.&lt;ref name=”Bro”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to F.A. Whitlock, Ganser syndrome is a hysterical disorder, on par with Ganser’s description of the disorder.&lt;ref name=”Whit”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Whitlock pointed to the number of cases in which Ganser syndrome was reported in settings of organic brain disease or functional psychosis as evidence of its hysterical foundations.&lt;ref name=”Whit”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Kraepelin and Bumke also believed the syndrome to be of a hysterical nature.&lt;ref name=”We”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;Bumke thought the syndrome had to be hysterical because amnesia for a traumatic emotional event tends to occur in hysteria more than in other disorders.&lt;ref name=”We”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;The giving of approximate answers is thought to be produced in hysterical personalities.&lt;ref name=”We”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
According to Mayer-Gross and Bleuler, Ganser syndrome occurs mainly in epileptic or schizophrenic patients, as if Ganser patients are followed long enough, some display schizophrenic reactions.&lt;ref name=”We”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Still others, claim that an organic condition that could lead to the manifestation of Ganser syndrome symptoms would have to be at an advanced stage in which a diagnosis could be easily given.&lt;ref name=”Ko”&gt;Koenig, T.; Lee, H.B. (2001). A Case of Ganser Syndrome: Organic or Hysterical?. General Hospital Psychiatry, 23(4), 230-231. {{doi}10.1016/S0163-8343(01)00147-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
There have also been reports of trauma and stroke patients with the syndrome. A study investigating the neurological basis of Ganser syndrome, described a patient with symptoms of the disorder who had a history of stroke and bifrontal infarcts.&lt;ref name=”Oy”&gt;Ouyang, D., Duggal, H. S., &amp; Jacob, N. J. (2003). Neurobiological Basis of Ganser Syndrome. Indian Journal of Psychiatry, 45(4), 255–256.&lt;/ref&gt; They discovered that hyperglutamatergic states (link to wikipedia page), which are caused by both strokes and stress, share a relationship with dissociative symptoms, suggesting a possible organic pathology that can predispose individuals to the syndrome.&lt;ref name=”Oy”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Wirtz and colleagues (2008) described a patient with Ganser syndrome after a left-hemispheric middle cerebral artery infarct.&lt;ref name=”Oy”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;A neuropsychological examination revealed atypical lateralisation of cognitive functions, leading to the conclusion that the giving of approximate answers might be related to frontal-executive cerebral dysfunction.&lt;ref name=”Oy”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
==Treatment==
In many cases, the symptoms seem to dwindle after a few days, and patients are often left with amnesia for the period of psychosis.&lt;ref name=”We”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Hospitalization may be necessary during the acute phase of symptoms, and psychiatric care if the patient is a danger to self or others.&lt;ref name=”Car”&gt;Carney, M.W.P.; Chary, T.N.K.; Robotis, P.; Childs, A. (1987). Ganser Syndrome and its Management. British Journal of Psychiatry, 151, 697-700. {{doi|10.1192/bjp.151.5.697}}&lt;/ref&gt; A neurological consult is advised to rule out any organic cause. Psychotherapy may also recommended for ensuring and maintaining safety.
 
Ganser patients typically recover quickly and completely.&lt;ref name=”En”&gt;Enoch, M. D., &amp; Irving, G. (1962). The Ganser syndrome. Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica, 38(3), 213-222.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Ganser syndrome can be a response to psychic deterioration, its resolution may be followed by other psychiatric symptoms, such as schizophrenia&lt;ref name=”lib”&gt;Lieberman, A.A. (1954). The Ganser Syndrome in Psychoses. Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 120(1-2), 10-16. {{doi|10.1097/00005053-195407000-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and depression,&lt;ref name=”Ha”&gt; Haddah, P.M. (1993). Ganser Syndrome Followed by Major Depressive Episode. British Journal of Psychiatry, 161, 251-253. {{doi|10.1192/bjp.162.2.251}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence the rationale behind the recommendation of psychotherapy. Medication is usually not required.&lt;ref name=”Car”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
==Controversy==
There is controversy regarding whether Ganser syndrome is a valid clinical entity. &lt;ref name=”Ep”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Bromberg (1986) has argued that the syndrome is not due to or related to mental illness, but rather a sort of defense against legal punishment.&lt;ref name=”Bro”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some see it as conscious lying, denial and repression, presenting Ganser syndrome symptoms as malingering instead of a dissociative or factitious disorder.&lt;ref name=”Bro”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
 
One case study of Ganser syndrome presented a middle-aged man who had been in a car crash and wanted disability insurance benefits.&lt;ref name=”Mer”&gt;Merckelbach, H.; Peters, M.; Jelicic, M.; Brands, I. and Smeets, T. (2006). Detecting malingering of Ganser‐like symptoms with tests: A case study. Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences, 60: 636-638. {{doi|10.1111/j.1440-1819.2006.01571.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since he had a big incentive, psychologists took careful measures and implemented testing with malingering instruments, which showed that the man performed below chance on simple memory tests and claimed to experience nonexistent symptoms.&lt;ref name=”Mer”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Upon further inspection of the collateral information, they found that the patient took part in high-level sports and other activities that were inconsistent with the cognitive dysfunctions he reported, and they determined it to be a case of malingering.&lt;ref name=”Mer”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Estes and New concluded that the motivation for the symptoms of the syndrome was escaping an “intolerable situation.”&lt;ref name=”Bro”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Stern and Whiles proposed an alternative explanation, citing Ganser syndrome presented itself in individuals who, although not psychologically well, do not realize it, and want to appear so.&lt;ref name=”Bro”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  
Still others attribute the syndrome to inattention, purposeful evasion, suppression, alcoholic excess, head injury, and to unconscious attempts to deceive others as a means to free themselves from responsibility for their actions.&lt;ref name=”Bro”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This denial of behavior can be seen as a way to overcome anxiety and helplessness brought on by the stressful event that often precedes the syndrome.&lt;ref name=”Bro”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
 
These aetiological debates focus on the main symptom of Ganser syndrome and its importance in its diagnosis. Approximate answers are prominent in the Ganser syndrome literature, causing concern in those who believe that this is a relatively simple symptom to feign.&lt;ref name=”Ep”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Ganser syndrome was regarded as an Adjustment Reaction of Adult Life in the [[DSM-II]] and later was moved under the category of Factitious Disorder with Psychological Symptoms in the [[DSM-III]].&lt;ref name=”APA3”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Ganser syndrome can also be found under the [[Dissociative Disorder Not Otherwise Specified]] (DDNOS) section of the [[DSM-IV-TR]]&lt;ref name=”APA4”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, however it is not listed in the [[DSM-V]], which got rid of the [[DDNOS]] section and replaced it with [[Other Specified Dissociative Disorder]] (OSDD) and Unspecified Dissociative Disorder (USDD).&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2013). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5th ed.). Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;. Despite this, the [[International Classification of Diseases]] has Ganser syndrome listed under dissociative disorders.&lt;ref name=”ICD”&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''George Nicholas Sanders''' (February 22, 1812 &amp;ndash; August 13, 1873) was a former official of the United States who was believed by some to have s a level involvement in the [[assassination]] of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Sanders was born in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. His father was Lewis Sanders, and his mother was Ann Nicholas.

==Early career==
During his early career he was involved in breeding cattle and race horses. Sanders later moved to New York and married Anna Reid in 1836.  His father-in-law was [[Samuel_Chester_Reid]].  He was involved in the [[Young America Movement]] and was an editor for the "Democratic Review."

==Revolutionary ideas and causes==
Sanders was a supporter of President [[James K. Polk]] and was later awarded the position of Consul in London during the administration of [[Franklin Pierce]]. He became involved in what, at the time, were regarded as revolutionary and [[anarchist]] causes and needed to be recalled. He had supposedly been involved in plans to assassinate heads of state, including French Emperor [[Napoleon III]], or foment causes to bring about democratic reform. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], he was involved in activities in [[Montreal]] that were supposed to support the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] by unorthodox means. He had also made several trips to Europe to further the cause of the Southern States.

==Lincoln assassination==
After the assassination of Lincoln, attempts were made to take Sanders into custody, but he fled to Canada and Europe. He later returned to the United States soon before he died in 1873 in New York. He is buried in an unmarked grave in [[Green-Wood Cemetery|Greenwood Cemetery]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]].

In his book ''Murdering Mr. Lincoln'', author [[Charles Higham (author)|Charles Higham]] asserts that Sanders was involved in the assassination, and was the driving force behind it. He argues that Sanders saw Lincoln had the potential of becoming a dictator. Lincoln had done things that violated the U.S. Constitution during the War. His book alleges that in June 1864, Sanders was in [[Montreal]], [[Canada]], Sanders was plotting against Lincoln with the [[Confederate Secret Service]]. Higham asserts that when [[John Wilkes Booth]], Lincoln's assassin, arrived in Montreal in October of 1864, he fell under the influence of Sanders and arranged Lincoln's assassination there. In 1864, General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] suspended trade with the Confederate Army, which Lincoln had allowed a limited amount. Higham surmounts that this removed any hesitation on Sanders' part on removing Lincoln.

In [[economics]], a '''government-granted monopoly''' (also called a "de jure monopoly") and the monopoly to be served under government is a form of [[coercive monopoly]] by which a government grants exclusive privilege to a private individual or firm to be the sole provider of a good or service; potential competitors are excluded from the market by [[law]], [[regulation]], or other mechanisms of government enforcement. As a form of [[coercive monopoly]], government-granted monopoly is contrasted with a ''coercive monopoly'' or an ''efficiency monopoly'', where there is no competition but it is not forcibly excluded. Amongst forms of coercive monopoly it is distinguished from [[government monopoly]] or [[state monopoly]] (in which ''government agencies'' hold the legally enforced monopoly rather than private individuals or firms) and from government-sponsored cartels (in which the government forces ''several independent'' producers to partially coordinate their decisions through a centralized organization). Advocates for government-granted monopolies often claim that they ensure a degree of public control over essential industries, without having those industries actually run by the state. Opponents often criticize them as political favors to [[corporation]]s. Government-granted monopolies may be opposed by those who would prefer [[free market]]s as well as by those who would prefer to replace private corporations with [[public ownership]].

== History ==
Under [[mercantilism|mercantilist]] economic systems, European governments with colonial interests often granted large and extremely lucrative monopolies to companies trading in particular regions, such as the [[Dutch East India Company]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Today, government-granted monopolies may be found in public utility services such as public [[road]]s, [[mail]], [[water supply]], and [[electric power]], as well as certain specialized and highly regulated fields such as [[education]] and [[gambling]]. In many countries lucrative natural resources industries, especially the [[petroleum]] industry, are controlled by government-granted monopolies. '''Franchises''' granted by governments to operate [[public transit]] through public roads are another example.

==Patent==
{{Main|Patent}}
A patent is a set of [[exclusive right]]s granted by a [[State (polity)|state]] or national government to an inventor or his/her assignee for a [[term of patent|limited period of time]] in exchange for a public disclosure of an [[invention]].

The procedure for granting patents, the requirements placed on the patentee, and the extent of the exclusive rights vary widely between countries according to national laws and international agreements. Typically, however, a patent application must include one or more [[claim (patent)|claim]]s defining the invention which must be [[novelty (patent)|new]], [[inventive step and non-obviousness|inventive]], and [[utility (patent)|useful]] or [[industrial applicability|industrially applicable]]. In many countries, certain [[patentable subject matter|subject areas]] are excluded from patents, such as [[business method patent|business methods]] and mental acts. The exclusive right granted to a patentee in most countries is the right to prevent others from making, using, selling, or distributing the patented invention without permission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/patentscope/en/patents_faq.html#protection Patents: Frequently Asked Questions], [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], Retrieved on 22 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright==
{{Main|Copyright}}
Copyright is a legal right created by the law of a country that grants the creator of an original work [[exclusive right]]s for its use and distribution. This is usually only for a limited time. The exclusive rights are not absolute but limited by limitations and exceptions to copyright law, including fair use. A major limitation on copyright is that copyright protects only the original expression of ideas, and not the underlying ideas themselves.

==Trademark==
{{Main|Trademark}}
A trademark or trade mark&lt;ref&gt;The styling of ''trademark'' as a single word is predominantly used in the United States and Philippines only, while the two word styling ''trade mark'' is used in many other countries around the world, including the European Union and Commonwealth and ex-Commonwealth jurisdictions (although Canada officially uses ''trade-mark'' pursuant to the ''Trade-mark Act'', ''trade mark'' and ''trademark'' are also commonly used).&lt;/ref&gt; is a distinctive [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] or indicator used by an individual, [[business organizations|business organization]], or other [[Juristic person|legal entity]] to identify that the [[Good (economics and accounting)|product]]s or [[Service (economics)|services]] to [[consumer]]s with which the trademark appears originate from a unique source, and to distinguish its products or services from those of other entities.

Trademarks can act as a form of [[consumer protection]] that lowers the [[transaction cost]]s between a buyer and seller who are not personally acquainted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Landes |first1=William |authorlink1= |last2=Posner |first2=Richard |title=The economic structure of intellectual property law |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X-KkvbT6F4UC |accessdate=2009-08-18|series= |date= |year= |month= |origyear= |publisher= |location= |isbn= 978-0-674-01204-2|page= |pages=442 |trans-chapter=|chapter=7 |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}} - Subheading: '''The Economic Function of Trademarks''' p 166&lt;/ref&gt;

==Directly mandated==
Governments have granted monopolies to forms of copy prevention. In the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], for example, the proprietary [[Macrovision]] copy prevention technology is required for analog video recorders. Though other forms of copy prevention aren't prohibited, requiring Macrovision effectively gives it a monopoly and prevents more effective copy prevention methods from being developed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Criticism==
Opponents of government-granted monopoly often point out that such a firm is able to set its pricing and production policies without fear of breeding potential competition. They argue that this causes inefficiencies in the market place, such as unnecessarily high prices to consumers for the good or service being supplied. It has been argued that government-imposed price caps might avert this problem.

The National''' Hassanat short film festival''' in [[Esfahan]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://hasanatfilm.ir/hassanat-publication-and-cultural-center-in-esfahan-if-one-of-the-pioneer-charity-organizations-in-cultural-affairs-and-interest-free-loan-funds-and-to-ever-expansion-of-benefaction-and-goodness-cultu/ |title = AboutHassanat publication and cultural center in Esfahan |publisher= |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; was primarily established in Esfahan in 2010, with the aim to promote the charity and benefaction culture by Hassanat [[Islamic]] Cultural Promotion and Development Center that is one of the active NGOs in Esfahan with over five years of history behind it
The main aim of this festival is encouraging young [[filmmakers]] to deal with the subjects such as [[human]]ity, helping the humankind and regenerating good but forgotten traditions of the community. Submission of above 4000 short feature films, documentaries, scripts, animations and video clips from over 2000 young filmmakers and play writers of the country during 4 years of holding this festival indicate the attention and considerations of the artists in the community towards this prominent humanitarian and morale subject.
Holding training courses in critic framework and analysis of the works by the great Iranian cinematographers and screening selected films of different periods of the festival during the year show the consideration of the authorities holding the festival towards promoting the knowledge level of the young filmmakers and screenwriters of the society.
One of the considerable points of this festival could be the memorial ceremonies for the beneficial artists of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.iqna.ir/fa/news/3467209/پنجمین-دوره-جشنواره-ملی-فیلم-کوتاه-حسنات-در-اصفهان-برگزار-می‌شود |title = پنجمین دوره جشنواره ملی فیلم کوتاه حسنات در اصفهان برگزار می‌شود |publisher=iqna |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Illinois Shakespeare Festival''' (ISF) is held in [[Bloomington, Illinois]], [[United States]].  It began in 1978 and it celebrated its 30th season in the summer of 2007.  The Festival usually presents three pieces by "[[The Bard of Avon|The Bard]]" as a [[repertory theatre|revolving rep]], though occasionally the third piece is from a [[Wiktionary:contemporaneous|contemporaneous]] playwright.

The Festival is produced by the School of Theatre and Dance and the College of Fine Arts at [[Illinois State University]].  Performances take place at the Theatre at Ewing, on a re-creation Globe Stage complete with open air amphitheater. The Festival markets itself as "theatre under the stars!" Before each nightly performance (except Mondays), the Festival presents a Green Show in the courtyard of Ewing Manor. This little comedy or demonstration is suitable for all audiences and free. It often offers an abbreviated version of the play to come.  The Manor grounds serve as picnicking spots for the audience. The Festival runs from the later part of June through the middle of August. In 2008, The Festival began a fourth show aimed towards younger audiences which is performed on Wednesday and Saturday mornings at 10am.

==Production history==
Unless otherwise noted, the plays are written by [[William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 ISF Annual Report |url=http://thefestival.org/about/2013_ISF_Annual_Report_web.pdf |accessdate=2 July 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141212020832/http://thefestival.org/about/2013_ISF_Annual_Report_web.pdf |archivedate=December 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kuwaiti oil fires''' were caused by [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]]i [[Military of Iraq|military forces]] setting fire to a reported 605 to 732 [[oil well]]s along with an unspecified number of oil filled low-lying areas, such as oil lakes and fire [[trench]]es, as part of a [[scorched earth]] policy while retreating from [[Kuwait]] in 1991 due to the advances of [[Coalition of Gulf War|Coalition]] military forces in the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]]. The fires were started in January and February 1991, and the first [[oil well fire|well fires]] were extinguished in early April 1991, with the last well capped on November 6, 1991.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/owf_ii/owf_ii_s03.htm#III.%20CHRONOLOGY%20OF%20EVENTS |title=III.

==Motives==
[[File:Oil well fires, south of Kuwait City, 1991.jpg|thumb|Oil well fires, south of Kuwait City. (Photo taken from inside a UH-60 Blackhawk; the door frame is the black bar on the right of the photo)]]
The dispute between Iraq and Kuwait over alleged [[Directional drilling|slant-drilling]] in the [[Rumaila oil field]] was one of the reasons for [[Gulf War|Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990]].&lt;ref name=GT-DEX-1990-01&gt;Thomas C. Hayes, [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/03/world/confrontation-in-the-gulf-the-oilfield-lying-below-the-iraq-kuwait-dispute.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF; The Oilfield Lying Below the Iraq-Kuwait Dispute], ''The New York Times'', September 3, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GT-DEX-1990-02&gt;{{cite book|last=J. Murdico|first=Suzanne|title=Page 13, The Gulf War : War and Conflict in the Middle East|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group (2004)|isbn=9780823945511|pages=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LhvOVjZuBjgC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13|date=December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kuwaiti Oil Well Fire.jpg|thumb|right|Kuwaiti oil well fire, south of Kuwait City, March, 1991]]
In addition, Kuwait had been producing oil above treaty limits established by [[OPEC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomas C. Hayes|title=CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF; The Oilfield Lying Below the Iraq-Kuwait Dispute|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/03/world/confrontation-in-the-gulf-the-oilfield-lying-below-the-iraq-kuwait-dispute.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=pm|publisher=The New York Times|date=September 3, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the eve of the Iraqi invasion, Kuwait had set production quotas to almost {{convert|1.9|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}}, which coincided with a sharp drop in the price of oil. By the summer of 1990, Kuwaiti overproduction had become a serious point of contention with Iraq.

Some analysts have speculated that one of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s main motivations in invading Kuwait was to punish the ruling [[al-Sabah family]] in Kuwait for not stopping its policy of overproduction, as well as his reasoning behind the destruction of said wells.&lt;ref name="TED"&gt;{{cite web

It is also hypothesized that Iraq decided to destroy the oil fields to achieve a military advantage, believing the intense smoke plumes serving as [[smoke screen]]s created by the burning oil wells would inhibit Coalition offensive [[air strikes]], foil allied [[Precision-guided munition|precision guided weapons]] and spy satellites,&lt;ref name="articles.baltimoresun.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-01-23/news/1991023131_1_kuwait-saddam-hussein-sagan |title=PAGE 1 OF 2: Burning oil wells could be disaster, Sagan says January 23, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; and could screen Iraq’s military movements. Furthermore, it is thought that Iraq’s military leaders may have regarded the heat, smoke, and debris from hundreds of burning oil wells as presenting a formidable [[area denial]] obstacle to Coalition forces. The onset of the oil well destruction supports this military dimension to the sabotage of the wells; for example, during the early stage of the Coalition air campaign, the number of oil wells afire was relatively small but the number increased dramatically in late February with the arrival of the ground war.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/owf_ii/owf_ii_s03.htm |title=III. CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS A. Discussion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iraqi military [[combat engineers]] also released oil into low-lying areas for defensive purposes against infantry and [[mechanized warfare|mechanized units]] along Kuwait’s southern border, by constructing several "fire trenches" roughly 1 kilometer long, 3 meters wide, and 3 meters deep to impede the advance of Coalition ground forces.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

The military use of the land based fires should also be seen in context with the coinciding, deliberate, sea based [[Gulf War oil spill]], the apparent strategic goal of which was to foil a potential [[amphibious landing]] by U.S. [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]].&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/05/03/2888880.htm |title=Timeline: 20 years of major oil spills |date=May 4, 2010 |work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extent==
[[File:F-14A VF-114 over burning Kuwaiti oil well 1991.JPEG|left|thumb| The Kuwaiti oil fires were not just limited to burning oil wells, one of which is seen here in the background, but burning "oil lakes", seen in the foreground, also contributed to the smoke plumes, particularly the [[soot]]iest/blackest of them (1991).&lt;ref name="gulflink.osd.mil"/&gt; ]]
As an international coalition under United States command assembled in anticipation of an invasion of Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, the Iraqi regime decided to destroy as much of Kuwait's oil reserves and infrastructure as possible before withdrawing from that country. As early as December 1990, Iraqi forces placed explosive charges on Kuwaiti oil wells. The wells were systematically sabotaged beginning on January 16, 1991, when the allies commenced air strikes against Iraqi targets. On February 8, satellite images detected the first smoke from burning oil wells. The number of oil fires peaked between February 22 and 24, when the allied ground offensive began.&lt;ref name="DoD EER"&gt;[[United States Department of Defense]] ''Environmental Exposure Report: Oil Well Fires'' (updated August 2, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]'s report to [[United States Congress|Congress]], "the retreating Iraqi army set fire to or damaged over 700 oil wells, storage tanks, refineries, and facilities in Kuwait."&lt;ref name="1991 EPA Report"&gt;[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (1991). [http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/20014FNJ.txt?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=EPA&amp;Index=1991%20Thru%201994&amp;File=D%3A%5CZYFILES%5CINDEX%20DATA%5C91THRU94%5CTXT%5C00000017%5C20014FNJ.txt&amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;Display=p%7Cf&amp;DefSeekPage=x&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%20page&amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;ZyEntry=1 "Report to Congress: United States Gulf Environmental Technical Assistance"], pp. 14, A-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates placed the number of oil well fires from 605 to 732. A further thirty-four wells had been destroyed by heavy coalition bombing in January.&lt;ref name="DoD EER"/&gt; The Kuwait Petroleum Company's estimate as of September 1991 was that there had been 610 fires, out of a total of 749 facilities damaged or on fire along with an unspecified number of oil filled low-lying areas, such as "oil lakes" and "fire [[trench]]es".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; These fires constituted approximately 50% of the total number of oil well fires in the [[history of the petroleum industry]],&lt;ref name="1991 EPA Report"/&gt; and  temporarily damaged or destroyed approximately 85% of the wells in every major Kuwaiti oil field.&lt;ref name="DoD EER"/&gt;

Concerted efforts to bring the fires and other damage under control began in April 1991. During the uncontrolled burning phase from February to April,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/owf_ii/fig28.htm |title=Figure 28. Kuwait oil well capping, extinguishing, and oil flow chronology}}&lt;/ref&gt; various sources estimated that the ignited wellheads burnt through between four and six million [[barrel of oil|barrels of crude oil]], and between seventy and one hundred million [[cubic meters|cubic meters of natural gas]] per day.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthshots.usgs.gov/Iraq/Iraqtext |title="Iraq and Kuwait: 1972, 1990, 1991, 1997."

==Military effects==

[[File:BrennendeOelquellenKuwait1991.jpg|thumb|right|The oil fires caused a dramatic decrease in [[air quality]], causing [[respiratory]] problems for many soldiers on the ground without [[gas masks]] (1991).]]
[[File:B Company, 1st Battalion, 3rd Marines at Al-Burgan Oil Field, Kuwait in Gulf War, February 1991.tif|thumb|right|United States Marines approach burning oilfields during ground war of the Gulf War (1991).]]

On March 21, 1991, a Royal Saudi Air Force [[C-130]]H crashed in heavy smoke due to the Kuwaiti oil fires on approach to [[Ras Mishab Airport]], [[Saudi Arabia]]. 92 Senegalese soldiers and 6 Saudi crew members were killed, the largest accident among Coalition forces.&lt;ref name="92-senegalese-soldiers-die"&gt;Schmitt, Eric (March 22, 1991). [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/22/world/after-the-war-92-senegalese-soldiers-die-in-saudi-arabia-air-crash.html "After the War"]. ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The smoke screening was also used by Iraqi anti-armor forces to a successful extent in the [[Battle of Phase Line Bullet]], having aided in achieving the element of surprise against advancing [[M2 Bradley|Bradley (IFV)]]s, along with increasing the general [[fog of war]].

The fires burned out of control because of the dangers of sending in firefighting crews during the war. [[Land mines]] had been placed in areas around the oil wells and military [[demining]] was necessary before the fires could be put out. Around {{convert|5|Moilbbl|m3|-4}} of oil were lost each day. Eventually, privately contracted crews extinguished the fires, at a total cost of [[US$]]1.5 billion to Kuwait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Husain |first=T. |title=Kuwaiti Oil Fires: Regional Environmental Perspectives |year=1995 |publisher=BPC Wheatons Ltd |location=[[Oxford]] |pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, however, the fires had burned for approximately ten months, causing widespread pollution.

The fires have been linked with what was later deemed [[Gulf War Syndrome]], a chronic disorder afflicting military veterans and civilian workers that include fatigue, muscle pain, and cognitive problems; however, studies have indicated that the firemen who capped the wells did not report any of the symptoms that the soldiers experienced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/syndrome/analysis/oilwell.html Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses: Final Report], December 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The causes of Gulf War Syndrome have yet to be been determined.

From the perspective of ground forces, apart from the occasional "oil rain" experienced by troops very close to spewing wells,&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/owf_ii/owf_ii_s05.htm#D.%20Possible%20Health%20Effects%20of%20Oil%20Fires |title=Possible Health effects of Oil fires}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the more commonly experienced effects of the oil field fires were the ensuing smoke [[plume (hydrodynamics)|plume]]s which rose into the atmosphere and then [[Precipitation|precipitated]] or fell out of the air via [[dry deposition]] and by rain. The pillar-like plumes frequently broadened and joined up with other smoke plumes at higher altitudes, producing a cloudy grey [[overcast]] effect, as only about 10% of all the fires corresponding with those that originated from "oil lakes" produced pure black [[soot]] filled plumes, 25% of the fires emitted white to grey plumes, while the remainder emitted plumes with colors between grey and black.&lt;ref name="gulflink.osd.mil"/&gt; For example, one Gulf War veteran stated:&lt;ref name="gulflink.osd.mil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TAB J – Plume Configurations"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

{{quote|It was like a cloudy day all day long, in fact, we didn’t realize it was smoke at first. The smoke was about 500 feet above us, so we couldn’t see the sky. However, we could see horizontally for long distances with no problem. We knew it was smoke when the mucous from our nostrils started to look [[soot|black]]..."}}

A paper published in 2000 analyzed the degree of exposure by troops to [[particulate matter]], which included soot but the paper focused more-so on [[silica]] sand, which can produce [[silicosis]]. The paper included troop medical records,&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA382643 |title=Particulate Exposure During The Persian Gulf War B.

==Extinguishing efforts==
{{see also|Oil well fire}}
The burning wells needed to be extinguished as, without active efforts, Kuwait would lose billions of dollars in oil revenues. It was predicted that the fires would burn from two to five years before losing pressure and going out on their own, optimists estimating two years and pessimists estimating five while the majority estimated three years until this occurred.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOkWEN6kfy4 Betchel corporation ''Kuwait: Bringing Back the Sun'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The companies responsible for [[oil well fire|extinguishing the fires]] initially were [[Bechtel]], [[Red Adair]] Company (now sold off to [[Global Industries]] of [[Louisiana]]), [[Boots and Coots]], and [[Wild Well Control]]. [[Safety Boss]] was the fourth company to arrive but ended up extinguishing and capping the most wells of any other company: 180 of the 600. Other companies including Cudd Well/Pressure Control, Neal Adams Firefighters, and Kuwait Wild Well Killers were also contracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bechtel.com/projects/kuwait-reconstruction/|title=See how the Kuwait Oil Fields were Restored|work=Bechtel Corporate|access-date=2017-07-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Larry H. Flak, a petroleum engineer for Boots and Coots International Well Control, 90% of all the 1991 fires in Kuwait were put out with nothing but sea water, sprayed from powerful hoses at the base of the fire.&lt;ref name="sptimes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/03/21/Worldandnation/Fires_erupt_in_large_.shtml |title= Iraq Fires erupt in large Iraqi oil field in south Compiled from Times wires © St. Petersburg Times published March 21, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water supply to the arid desert region was supplied by re-purposing the [[oil pipeline]]s that prior to the arson attack, pumped oil to the [[Persian Gulf]], the pipeline was mildly damaged and once repaired its flow was reversed to pump Persian gulf [[seawater]] to the burning oil wells.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOkWEN6kfy4 Betchel corporation ''Kuwait: Bringing Back the Sun'', animation sequence]&lt;/ref&gt; The extinguishing rate was approximately 1 every 7–10 days at the start of efforts but then with experience gained and the removal of the [[mine fields]] that surrounded the burning wells, the rate increased to 2 or more per day.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

For stubborn [[oil well fire]]s, the use of a [[gas turbine]] to blast a large volume of water at high velocity at the fire proved popular with firefighters in Kuwait and was brought to the region by Hungarians equipped with [[MiG-21]] engines mounted originally on a [[T-34]] (later replaced with [[T-55]]) tank, called [[Big wind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/owf_ii/owf_ii_tabc.htm |title=TAB C – Fighting the Oil Well Fires}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/features/stilling-the-fires-of-war-big-wind-page-2 |title=Stilling The Fires of War, A Hungarian company lashes two MiG engines to a Soviet tank and proceeds to huff and puff and blow out the worst sort of raging oil-well fire. 2001. page 2, story by ZOLTAN SCRIVENER}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Husain, T., Kuwaiti Oil Fires: Regional Environmental Perspectives, 1st ed. Oxford, UK:BPC Wheatons Ltd, 1995, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; It extinguished 9 fires in 43 days.

In fighting a fire at a directly vertical spewing [[wellhead]], [[high explosive]]s, such as [[dynamite]] were used to create a [[blast wave]] that pushes the burning fuel and local atmospheric oxygen away from the well. (This is a similar principle to blowing out a candle.) The flame is removed and the fuel can continue to spill out without igniting. Generally, explosives were placed within [[55 gallon drum]]s, the explosives surrounded by [[fire retardant]] chemicals, and then the drums are wrapped with insulating material with a horizontal crane being used to bring the drum as close to the burning area as possible.&lt;ref name="sptimes.com"/&gt;

The firefighting teams titled their occupation as "Operation Desert Hell" after [[Operation Desert Storm]].&lt;ref name="iadc.org"&gt;http://www.iadc.org/dcpi/dc-novdec03/Nov3-Boots.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fire documentaries===
The fires were the subject of a 1992 [[IMAX]] [[documentary film]], ''[[Fires of Kuwait]]'', which was nominated for an [[Academy Award]]. The film includes footage of the Hungarian team using their jet turbine extinguisher.

[[Lessons of Darkness]] is a 1992 film by director [[Werner_Herzog|Werner Herzog]] that explores of the ravaged oil fields of post-Gulf War Kuwait.

Betchel Corporation produced a short documentary titled ''Kuwait: Bringing Back the Sun'' that summarizes and focuses upon the fire fighting efforts, which were dubbed the Al-Awda ([[Arabic]] for "The Return") project.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kockw.com"&gt;http://www.kockw.com/sites/EN/Pages/Profile/History/OilFires.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impact==

===Oil fire smoke===
{{see also|Nuclear winter#Kuwait wells in the first Gulf War}}
[[File:Kuwait burn oilfield.png|thumb|left|An oilfield on fire (1991)]]
Immediately following Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, predictions were made of an environmental disaster stemming from Iraqi threats to blow up captured Kuwaiti oil wells. Speculation ranging from a [[nuclear winter]] type scenario, to heavy [[acid rain]] and even short term immediate [[global warming]] were presented at the [[World Climate Conference]] in Geneva that November.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.kfupm.edu.sa/6551/1/6551_1.pdf KUWAITI OIL FIRES - MODELING REVISITED]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilmington morning Star"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6tEVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RBQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6851,2148654&amp;dq=world-climate-conference+oil+fires&amp;hl=en Wilmington morning Star] January 21’st, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 10, 1991, a paper appearing in the Journal ''Nature'', stated [[Paul Crutzen]]'s calculations that the setting alight of the Kuwait oil wells would produce a "[[nuclear winter]]", with a cloud of smoke covering half of the [[Northern Hemisphere]] after 100 days had passed and beneath the cloud, temperatures would be reduced by 5-10 Celsius.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v349/n6305/pdf/349096a0.pdf |title=Oil-well climate catastrophe |first=Peter |last=Aldhous |journal=Nature |volume=349 |issue=6305 |page=96 |date=January 10, 1991 |doi=10.1038/349096a0 |quote=The fears expressed last week centred around the cloud of soot that would result if Kuwait’s oil wells were set alight by Iraqi forces ... with effects similar to those of the "nuclear winter" ...

Crutzen ... estimates that temperatures beneath such a cloud could be reduced by 5-10 degrees C|bibcode=1991Natur.349...96A }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by articles printed in the [[Star-News|Wilmington morning star]] and the [[The Baltimore Sun|Baltimore Sun]] newspapers in mid to late January 1991, with the popular TV scientist personality of the time, [[Carl Sagan]], who was also the co-author of the first few [[nuclear winter]] papers along with [[Richard P. Turco]], John W. Birks, [[Alan Robock]] and [[Paul Crutzen]] together collectively stated that they expected catastrophic [[nuclear winter]] like effects with continental sized impacts of "sub-freezing" temperatures as a result if the Iraqis went through with their threats of igniting 300 to 500 pressurized oil wells and they burned for a few months.&lt;ref name="articles.baltimoresun.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilmington morning Star"/&gt;

Later when [[Operation Desert Storm]] had begun, Dr. [[S. Fred Singer]] and [[Carl Sagan]] discussed the possible environmental impacts of the Kuwaiti petroleum fires on the [[ABC News]] program ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]''. Sagan again argued that some of the effects of the smoke could be similar to the effects of a [[nuclear winter]], with smoke lofting into the [[stratosphere]], a region of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] beginning around {{convert|43000|ft|m}} above sea level at Kuwait,&lt;ref&gt;ftp://ftp.atmos.washington.edu/debbie/UAE-Award/Enc11-Reprints-Hobbs-etal-Cloud-Active-Nuclei/05-HobbsRadke-1992-Science-v256-987.pdf{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in global effects and that he believed the net effects would be very similar to the explosion of the Indonesian volcano [[Mount Tambora|Tambora]] in 1815, which resulted in the year 1816 being known as the ''[[Year Without a Summer]]''.

He reported on initial modeling estimates that forecast impacts extending to south Asia, and perhaps to the northern hemisphere as well. Singer, on the other hand, said that calculations showed that the smoke would go to an altitude of about {{convert|3000|ft|m}} and then be rained out after about three to five days and thus the lifetime of the smoke would be limited. Both height estimates made by Singer and Sagan turned out to be wrong, albeit with Singer's narrative being closer to what transpired, with the comparatively minimal atmospheric effects remaining limited to the Persian Gulf region, with smoke plumes, in general,&lt;ref name="gulflink.osd.mil"/&gt; lofting to about {{convert|10,000|ft|m}} and a few times as high as {{convert|20,000|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/4960296/The-Kuwaiti-Oli-Fires|title=The Kuwaiti Oil Fires|author=Hirschmann, Kris|publisher=Facts on File.|access-date=2017-09-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102193647/http://www.scribd.com/doc/4960296/The-Kuwaiti-Oli-Fires|archive-date=2014-01-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--The reference for this is a hardcopy transcript of the episode, excerpts on the Fred Singer talk page.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

Along with Singer's televised critique, Richard D. Small criticized the initial ''Nature'' paper in a reply on March 7, 1991 arguing along similar lines as Singer.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v350/n6313/pdf/350011a0.pdf |title=Environmental impact of fires in Kuwait |first= Richard D. |last=Small |others=[[Pacific-Sierra Research Corporation]] |journal=Nature |volume=350 |pages=11–12 |date=March 7, 1991 |doi=10.1038/350011a0 |quote=16,000 metric tons of actual soot is produced from 220,000 metric tons of oil burned every day. ‘My estimates of the smoke produced by destruction of Kuwait’s oil wells and refineries and the smoke stabilization altitude do not support any of the purported impacts. '''The smoke is not injected high enough to spread over large areas of the Northern Hemisphere,''' nor is enough produced to cause a measurable temperature change or failure of the monsoons.|bibcode=1991Natur.350...11S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan later conceded in his book ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' that his prediction did not turn out to be correct: "it ''was'' pitch black at noon and temperatures dropped 4–6&amp;nbsp;°C over the Persian Gulf, but not much smoke reached stratospheric altitudes and Asia was spared."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sagan, Carl |title=The demon-haunted world: science as a candle in the dark |publisher=Random House |location=New York |year=1996 |page=257 |isbn=0-394-53512-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the peak of the fires, the smoke absorbed 75 to 80% of the sun’s radiation. The particles rose to a maximum of {{convert|20,000|ft|m}}, but were [[scavenger (chemistry)|scavenged]] by [[cloud condensation nuclei]] from the atmosphere relatively quickly.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;[ftp://ftp.atmos.washington.edu/debbie/UAE-Award/Enc11-Reprints-Hobbs-etal-Cloud-Active-Nuclei/05-HobbsRadke-1992-Science-v256-987.pdf Airborne Studies of the Smoke from the Kuwait Oil Fires Hobbs, Peter V; Radke, Lawrence F Science; May 15, 1992; 256,5059]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Peter V. |last1=Hobbs |first2=Lawrence F. |last2=Radke |title=Airborne Studies of the Smoke from the Kuwait Oil Fires |journal=Science |date=May 15, 1992 |doi= 10.1126/science.256.5059.987 |volume=256 |issue=5059 |pages=987–91 |pmid=17795001 |bibcode = 1992Sci...256..987H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sagan and his colleagues expected that a "self-lofting" of the sooty smoke would occur when it absorbed the sun's heat radiation, with little to no scavenging occurring, whereby the black particles of soot would be heated by the sun and lifted/lofted higher and higher into the air, thereby injecting the soot into the stratosphere where it would take years for the sun blocking effect of this [[aerosol]] of soot to fall out of the air, and with that, catastrophic ground level cooling and agricultural impacts in Asia and possibly the [[Northern Hemisphere]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-01-23/news/1991023131_1_kuwait-saddam-hussein-sagan |title= PAGE 2 of 2: Burning oil wells could be disaster, Sagan says January 23, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In retrospect, it is now known that smoke from the Kuwait oil fires only affected the weather pattern throughout the Persian Gulf and surrounding region during the periods that the fires were burning in 1991, with lower atmospheric winds blowing the smoke along the eastern half of the Arabian Peninsula, and cities such as [[Dhahran]] and [[Riyadh]], and countries such as [[Bahrain]] experienced days with smoke filled skies and carbon [[soot]] rainout/fallout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Meteorological Effects of the Kuwait Oil Fires | url=http://as.wm.edu/Abstracts/PatrickDowling.pdf | author=Patrick K. Dowling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus the immediate consequence of the arson sabotage was a dramatic regional decrease in [[air quality]], causing respiratory problems for many Kuwaitis and those in neighboring countries.

According to the 1992 study from [[Peter V. Hobbs|Peter Hobbs]] and Lawrence Radke, daily emissions of [[sulfur dioxide]] (which can generate [[acid rain]]) from the Kuwaiti oil fires were 57% of that from electric utilities in the United States, the emissions of [[carbon dioxide]] were 2% of global emissions and emissions of [[soot]] reached 3400 metric tons per day.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In a paper in the [[DTIC]] archive, published in 2000, it states that "Calculations based on smoke from Kuwaiti oil fires in May and June 1991 indicate that [[stoichiometry|combustion efficiency]] was about 96% in producing [[carbon dioxide]]. While, with respect to the incomplete combustion fraction, Smoke [[particulate matter]] accounted for 2% of the fuel burned, of which 0.4% was soot."[With the remaining 2%, being oil that did not undergo any initial combustion].&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

===Smoke documentary===
Peter V. Hobbs also narrated a short amateur documentary titled ''Kuwait Oil Fires'' that followed the [[University of Washington]]/UW's "Cloud and Aerosol Research Group" as they flew through, around and above the smoke clouds and took samples, measurements, and video of the smoke clouds in their [[Convair C-131]](N327UW&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.net/search/photo.search?regsearch=N327UW|title=Photo Search Results|publisher=|accessdate=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Aerial laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CXvz9G1gjw|title=Kuwait Oil Fires|date=January 23, 2012|work=YouTube|accessdate=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oil spills==

Forty-six oil wells are estimated to have gushed,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and before efforts to cap them began, they were releasing approximately 300,000-400,000 barrels of oil per day, with the last [[oil gusher|gusher]] being capped occurring in the latter days of October 1991.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The Kuwaiti Oil Minister estimated between twenty-five and fifty million barrels of unburned oil from damaged facilities pooled to create approximately 300 oil lakes, that contaminated around 40 million tons of sand and earth. The mixture of desert sand, unignited oil spilled and [[soot]] generated by the burning oil wells formed layers of hard "tarcrete", which covered nearly five percent of Kuwait's land mass.&lt;ref&gt;[[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]], [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] News, [http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2003/0321kuwaitfire.html ''1991 Kuwait Oil Fires''], March 21, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleaning efforts were led by the [[Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research]] and the Arab Oil Co., who tested a number of technologies including the use of [[petroleum-degrading bacteria]] on the oil lakes.&lt;ref name="HMM" /&gt;

Vegetation in most of the contaminated areas adjoining the oil lakes began recovering by 1995, but the dry climate has also partially solidified some of the lakes.

The land based Kuwaiti oil spill surpassed the [[Lakeview Gusher]], which spilled nine million pounds in 1910, as the largest oil spill in recorded history.

Six to eight million barrels of oil were directly spilled into the Persian Gulf, which became known as the [[Gulf War oil spill]].&lt;ref name="1991 EPA Report"/&gt;

==Comparable incidents==

During the [[Iraq War|second US invasion of Iraq]] in 2003, approximately 40 oil wells were set on fire in the [[Persian gulf]] within Iraqi territory, ostensibly to once again hinder the invasion.&lt;ref name="sptimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iadc.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/21/sprj.irq.oil.wells/index.html|title=CNN.com - UK: Iraq torches seven oil wells - March 21, 2003|publisher=|accessdate=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The fires are featured in [[Werner Herzog]]'s 1992 film ''[[Lessons of Darkness]]''.
* There was also a flyover as well as some ground shots of the oil fires in the 1992 nonverbal film ''[[Baraka (film)|Baraka]]'', shot on 70mm Todd-AO film.
* The 2004 film ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (2004 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' included a scene set in Kuwait in February 1991, with burning oil fields visible in the background.
* In the 2005 film ''[[Jarhead (film)|Jarhead]]'', the oil fires burn continuously throughout the 1991 invasion of Iraq, and its effects—an unceasing rain of unburned oil and smoke-filled skies, feature prominently in the story.
*In the 1999 film ''[[Three Kings (1999 film)|Three Kings]]'', oil fires are featured in multiple scenes.
*In the 1990s TV series ''[[The X-Files]]'', the "[[Colonist (The X-Files)#Black oil|Black Oil]]" is believed to be an alien disease causing agent, evoking the conspiracy theory that [[Gulf War syndrome]] was caused by the Kuwaiti oil. The 2001 episode, "[[Vienen]]", includes an oil-rig fire that could potentially disperse ''The Black Oil'' contagion.
* In the 2002 video game ''[[Eternal Darkness]]'' the fires are featured in the final level of the game as a key plot point.

'''''Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury''''' is&lt;!--NOT "was" due to literary present tense: i.e. the show did not stop being a show just because it no longer airs--&gt; an American television drama about criminal trials set in New York City. It was the fourth series in [[Dick Wolf]]'s successful [[Law &amp; Order (franchise)|''Law &amp; Order'' franchise]]. The show's almost exclusive focus was on the criminal trial of the accused, showing both the prosecution's and defense's preparation for trial, as well as the trial itself. The series premiered on Thursday, March 3, 2005, and ended on January 21, 2006. Its regular time slot was Fridays 10/9 p.m. ET on [[NBC]]. The last episode aired on [[truTV|Court TV]] months after the series' cancellation.

== Overview ==
{{quote box |width=35% |align=right|border=3px|fontsize=105%|quote=In the criminal justice system, all defendants are innocent until proven guilty, either by confession, plea bargain, or trial by jury. This is one of those trials.|source={{nb10}}– Opening narration spoken by [[Steven Zirnkilton]]}}

''Trial by Jury'' focuses on criminal legal procedures and preparation that are rarely depicted on other ''Law &amp; Order'' series, such as [[jury selection]], [[deliberation]]s in the jury room, as well as [[jury research]] and  [[mock trial]]s prepared by the defense to use psychological studies and [[socioeconomic status]] profiling to their advantage. The episodes usually start with a [[witness]] or victim's personal account of a [[crime]]. This is a departure from the other ''Law &amp; Order'' series, which usually begin by depicting either the actual crime or its discovery/reporting by civilians. The show progresses on from that point, showing how both sides develop their strategies for winning the case. In addition, a few episodes show jury deliberations. The show develops the judges as characters, showing scenes of them conferring with each other and reusing the same judges in multiple episodes.

=== Plot ===
The series follows Bureau Chief [[Tracey Kibre]] ([[Bebe Neuwirth]]), an Executive A.D.A. assigned to Manhattan's homicide division. Kibre's team, including Detective [[Lennie Briscoe]] ([[Jerry Orbach]]) and A.D.A. [[Kelly Gaffney]] ([[Amy Carlson]]), follows up on leads and interview witnesses, as well as participating in trials, during which both sides examine witnesses and give arguments. Similarly, the defense's preparation varies from episode to episode, running the gamut from testing arguments in front of jury focus groups to deal-making between co-defendants. Several pretrial meetings are held where some procedural issue is argued and ruled on.

== Cast and characters ==
[[File:TBJ Cast.jpg|thumbnail|right|The original cast of ''Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury'' (2005); from left, [[Amy Carlson]], [[Bebe Neuwirth]], [[Fred Thompson]], [[Jerry Orbach]], and [[Kirk Acevedo]].]]

=== Main cast ===
* [[Bebe Neuwirth]] as [[Tracey Kibre]], the Homicide Bureau Chief in the Manhattan District Attorney's office. Tracey has a black-and-white view of the law. She is tough, tenacious, focused, and professional. Kibre has a strong working relationship with her staff. As chief of the Homicide Bureau, she is a senior prosecutor, subordinate only to the District Attorney and the Executive ADA. 
* [[Amy Carlson]] as [[Kelly Gaffney]], an ADA. Gaffney is Kibre's Deputy, who often challenges her senior colleague. She sees the law in shades of gray, and as a result is often more by-the-book.
* [[Kirk Acevedo]] as [[Hector Salazar (Law &amp; Order)|Hector Salazar]], a DA investigator. Salazar retired from the police force following an on-the-job injury which would have forced him behind a desk.
* [[Fred Thompson]] as [[Arthur Branch]], the County of New York's District Attorney. Branch is a tough [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]], who practices both legal and political conservatism. 
* [[Jerry Orbach]] as [[Lennie Briscoe]], a DA investigator. Briscoe was the longest-serving police detective of the original ''Law &amp; Order''. Orbach succumbed to cancer over two months before the show's premiere, and he only appeared in the first two episodes of the series. From episode 3 and onward, he is never seen or mentioned again for the remainder of the series. 
* [[Scott Cohen (actor)|Scott Cohen]] as Chris Ravell, an NYPD detective assigned to the ADA Kibre's team and Hector Salazar's second partner, succeeding Lennie Briscoe. Cohen was credited as a guest appearance for episode 3 before being added to the main credits in episode 5. He did not appear in episode 4.

=== Recurring cast ===
* [[Candice Bergen]] as Amanda Anderlee, a [[New York Supreme Court]] judge in Manhattan (under New York States' archaic judicial nomenclature, the "Supreme Court" is a trial-level court and not the highest court in the state&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nycourts.gov/history/legal-history-new-york/history-new-york-courts-supreme-court.html|title=New York Legal History / The Rule of Law : New York Supreme Court|website=www.nycourts.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

 |ShortSummary= Tough New York Assistant DA Tracey Kibre tackles the murder of an aspiring Broadway actress, but has little evidence to prosecute the suspect; an acclaimed but arrogant theater producer ([[Tony Bill]]) smugly knows that the police have found no blood or even a body. Kibre is joined by her unflappable deputy ADA, Kelly Gaffney, as they work with Detectives Briscoe and Salazar to pursue physical evidence while the producer's attorney ([[Annabella Sciorra]]) maneuvers to publicly portray the missing woman as promiscuous.

NBC announced on May 16, 2005, that ''Trial by Jury'' would not be returning for the 2005–2006 fall television season. The rival [[CBS]] [[police procedural|procedural]] ''[[Numbers (TV series)|Numbers]]'' debuted in the midseason in late January 2005 and consistently beat NBC's ''[[Medical Investigation]]'' in the ratings, sending the latter show into hiatus and eventual cancellation, freeing up the time slot for ''Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury''. Despite ''Trial by Jury''{{'}}s pedigree, ''Numb3rs''{{'}} ratings remained strong, often beating ''Trial by Jury'' in both overall and key demographic ratings.&lt;ref name="TBJ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/News2005/may05/may09/5_fri/news7friday.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130128161336/http://www.medialifemagazine.com/News2005/may05/may09/5_fri/news7friday.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-28 |title=''Rumor: Harsh verdict for NBC's 'Trial by Jury' '' |work=Medialifemagazine.com |accessdate=2005-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Trial by Jury'' was the first series of the ''Law &amp; Order'' franchise to be canceled, although ''[[TV Guide]]'' reported at one point that NBC had reconsidered its decision{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} and would pick up the series once again, or hand it off to [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|Turner Network Television]] (TNT), which also airs reruns of the original series. The sets were reused by a series Wolf produced for NBC entitled ''[[Conviction (2006 TV series)|Conviction]]'' which premiered Friday, March 3, 2006, lasting only one season before cancellation. In an October 2005 interview with the [[Associated Press]], Wolf stated that NBC had assured him ''Trial by Jury'' would return for the fall of 2005, but had "blindsided" him by canceling it, instead.

[[truTV|Court TV]] (now TruTV) re-aired the entire series, including the episode "Eros in the Upper Eighties", which never aired on NBC before the show's cancellation. TNT has aired the episode "Skeleton" on occasion, as the conclusion to the original series episode "Tombstone".

Retrieved 2013-10-2&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis gained notoriety when, as a [[fighter pilot]] in the [[Vietnam War]], he was shot down, captured, and spent 5 ½ years as a prisoner of war in [[Hanoi]] and surrounding areas with former Presidential candidate and Senator [[John McCain]] (R-AZ) and others.&lt;ref name="Nam Pow Website"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hanton|first=Tom|url=http://www.nampows.org/nampowslist.html|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His capture occurred on November 7, 1967, and he was released on March 14, 1973.&lt;ref name="Lee Ellis Military Biography"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lee Ellis Military Biography|url=http://www.pownetwork.org/bios/e/e028.htm|work=POW Network|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the youngest, junior members in the camps.&lt;ref name="Nam Pow Website" /&gt; Ellis is an international speaker and consultant on the subjects of leadership and human performance, organizational integrity, operational effectiveness, and personal accountability. He frequently consults with various organizations—from small businesses to Fortune 500 organizations on these subjects.&lt;ref name="Leadership Freedom LLC Website"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ellis|first=Lee|title=Leadership Freedom LLC Website|url=http://www.leadershipfreedom.com/Clients/|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Lee co-authored three books and workbooks on career planning.&lt;ref name="Northfield Publishing Biography Page"&gt;{{cite web|title=Northfield Publishing Biography Page|url=https://www.moodypublishers.com/pub_authorDetail.aspx?id=41798&amp;aid=93|publisher=Northfield Publishing|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Ellis was born in [[Commerce, Georgia]], to Leon and Molene Ellis. His father was a food service manager at the [[University of Georgia]], and his mother was a [[middle school]] science teacher. He has one brother, Robert Ellis. Ellis had early memories of being interested in airplanes and flying. He recalls a moment at 5-years old when he climbed on a [[World War II]] airplane in a local park and told his parents this is what he wanted to do when he grew up.&lt;ref name="County Line Magazine Article - Page 17"&gt;{{cite web|last=Le Jeune|first=Judy|title=County Line Magazine|url=http://www.countylinemagazine.net/589090716/files/inc/589090716.pdf|publisher=County Line Magazine|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents encouraged his early interest in flying. He went to Ila Elementary and Commerce High School; and though he maintained good grades, he admittedly was not a disciplined student. He lettered in multiple sports including [[American football|football]], [[basketball]], and [[baseball]] and was a good athlete.

After high school, Ellis attended the [[University of Georgia]] in [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]] and enrolled in [[Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps|Air Force ROTC]]. He graduated with a B.A. degree in History while pursuing his passion for a military aviation career. Upon graduation from the University of Georgia in 1965, he was selected as a Distinguished Graduate of [[AFROTC]] and was commissioned as a [[Second Lieutenant (United States)|Second Lieutenant]] in the United States Air Force.

== Military Service ==
Ellis entered pilot training program at [[Moody Air Force Base]], [[Valdosta, Georgia]]. Fifty-three weeks later he received his Wings and an assignment to combat training in the [[F-4C Phantom]] fighter bomber with follow-on orders to [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="Lee Ellis Biography"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ellis|first=Lee|url=http://www.leeellis.us/lee-ellis|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to his academic achievements mentioned above, Ellis also earned graduated from the [[Armed Forces Staff College]] and the [[Air War College]], and earned a Master of Science Degree in Counseling and Human Development from [[Troy University]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]].&lt;ref name="Lee Ellis Biography" /&gt;

=== POW Experience ===

After arriving in Vietnam, Ellis was assigned to execute bombing raids in [[North Vietnam]], one of the heaviest guarded regions of the country. On his 53rd mission, he and [[aircraft commander]], Captain Ken Fisher, received serious damage to their F-4C Phantom aircraft. Both men had to eject from the fighter jet and were immediately captured on the ground when they landed with their [[parachute]]s.&lt;ref name="Veterans Tributes Biography Page"&gt;{{cite web|title=Veteran Tributes Website Biography Page|url=http://www.veterantributes.org/TributeDetail.php?recordID=423|publisher=Veterans Tributes Website|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two weeks of traveling through various regions in a Vietnamese military vehicle, they arrived at the [[Hoa Loa Prison]] in Hanoi, Vietnam (also known as the Hanoi Hilton). Hoa Loa was an old [[France|French]] Bastille prison fortified strongly to keep prisoners from escaping. For the next 9 months, Lee and three other comrades shared 6'x7.5' cell.

Over the next 5 ½ years, Ellis' described his POW experience as "moments of boredom interrupted by stark moments of terror." In addition to physically torturing prisoners for information, the prison would broadcast [[anti-American]] [[propaganda]] several times a day throughout the entire camp as a means of breaking their spirit and confidence. Ellis and his comrades began using several forms of subversive communication to stay in touch with each other without being caught. Ellis became one of the key communicators in the camps using a tap code system used by American World War II POWs in [[Germany]]. (This was also highlighted in [[Arthur Koestler]]'s book about the [[Soviet]] [[Gulag]]s, ''[[Darkness at Noon]]''). The code uses a 5x5 matrix composed of the 26 letters of the alphabet, with K and C being the same tap code. For example, the word "Hi" would two taps, then three taps for "H"; and two taps, then four taps for "I". The POWs tapped letters and words through the thick walls to form messages that each cell would pass along to the next.

Some of Ellis' fellow senior ranking officers in the camps were Colonel [[Robbie Risner]] [[USAF]], CAPT [[Jeremiah Denton]] [[USN]], and CAPT [[Jim Stockdale]] USN. In the prison camps, frequently the senior-ranking officers received the first and most harsh treatment in an effort to obtain propaganda and information. Much of the torture abuse was aimed at discouraging the senior officers from carrying out leadership duties.

Prisoners of war were released from the camps in order of capture through [[Operation Homecoming]]. On March 14, 1973, Lee and several comrades, include Sen. [[John McCain]] (R-AZ), were flown from Vietnam to [[Clark Air Base]], [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name="Lee Ellis Military Biography" /&gt; From there, Ellis and others eventually landed at [[Maxwell Air Force Base]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]] where he was reunited with his family. Ellis was single at the time of his capture.

=== Later career ===

After repatriation he returned to flying duties with increasing positions of leadership. Rising to the rank of colonel before retirement, Ellis's assignments included duty as a pilot, [[flight instructor]], [[staff officer]], chief of flight standardization and evaluation, flying squadron commander, and supervisor in [[higher education]]. He supervised, educated, and trained officers for the last 17 years of his U.S. Air Force career. Ellis served as the Vice Commandant of the [[Squadron Officer School]], the Air Force's leadership school for [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]]s. He completed his Air Force career as Professor of Aerospace Studies and Commander of Air Force ROTC at the University of Georgia, retiring with almost twenty-five years of service.

=== Awards and Decorations ===
Ellis is a [[command pilot]] whose decorations include the [[Silver Star]] with one Oak Leaf Cluster; the [[Legion of Merit]] with one Oak Leaf Cluster; the [[Bronze Star]] with Valor Device; the [[Meritorious Service Medal (United States)|Meritorious Service Medal]] with two Oak Leaf Clusters; the [[Purple Heart]]; the [[Air Medal]] with eight Oak Leaf Clusters; and the [[Prisoner of War Medal]]. In addition, he was awarded four [[Air Force Commendation Medal]]s and four Meritorious Service Medals for performance excellence.&lt;ref name="Military Times Hall of Valor"&gt;{{cite web|title=Military Times Hall of Valor|url=http://projects.militarytimes.com/citations-medals-awards/recipient.php?recipientid=24280|publisher=Military Times|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired after 24 years of service with the rank of colonel. He was selected in 1975 as the Air Force nominee for the U.S. [[Junior Chamber of Commerce]]'s "[[Ten Outstanding Young Americans|Ten Outstanding Men of the Year]]" Award.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3898">The '''Love Pageant Rally''' took place on October 6, 1966&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestraight.com/films/lprally/|title=Love Pageant Rally|accessdate=2008-08-05|author=Reg E. Williams|work=The Straight on The Haight}}&lt;/ref&gt; — the day [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] became illegal — in the 'panhandle' of [[Golden Gate Park]], a narrower section that projects into [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]'s [[Haight-Ashbury]] district. The 'Haight' was a neighborhood of run-down turn-of-the-20th-century housing that was the center of San Francisco's [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture in the 1960s]].

The major instigators of the rally were [[Allen Cohen (poet)|Allen Cohen]] and artist [[Michael Bowen (artist)|Michael Bowen]], the creators of the ''[[San Francisco Oracle]]'', which first hit the streets in September 1966. The occasion was the banning of LSD, by the California legislature in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], an enactment which virtually created a neighborhood of outlaws in the Haight, where 'acid' was a staple of community culture. Since the new law was to go into effect on October 6, 1966, Cohen and others related the event to the [[Number of the Beast (numerology)|number of the Beast]] of ''[[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]''. On a more serious level, busts for drugs were ramping up locally and on the national level, and confrontations between the [[hippie]] [[commune (intentional community)|commune]]s and the local police were getting more intense and led to street protests and rioting, followed by neighborhood curfews. A better form of protest, more suited to hippie culture was needed.

"Without confrontation," said Allen Cohen, "we wanted to create a celebration of innocence. We were not guilty of using illegal substances. We were celebrating transcendental consciousness. The beauty of the universe. The beauty of being."

Posters advertising the event invited participants to "Bring the color gold... Bring photos of personal saints and gurus and heroes of the underground... Bring children... Flowers... Flutes... Drums... Feathers... Bands... Beads... Banners, flags, incense, chimes, gongs, cymbals, symbols, costumes, joy."&lt;ref&gt;Gene Anthony, ''[http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/summer_of_love.pdf The Summer of Love, Haight-Ashbury at Its Highest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606015037/http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/summer_of_love.pdf |date=2007-06-06 }}'' (Last Gasp, 1980). Entire text and photos online at erowid.org, website found 2010-03-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands showed up for the event, read a "prophecy of a declaration of independence" written by Cohen, after which many placed a tab of acid on their tongues and swallowed in unison. Music was provided by the [[Grateful Dead]] and [[Janis Joplin]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beatsupernovarasa.com/beatpics/bp000027.html&lt;/ref&gt; both invited to play by [[Michael Bowen (artist)|Michael Bowen]] for free. [[Ken Kesey]] was on hand with the [[Merry Pranksters]] in the legendary bus.

The Love Pageant Rally drew several thousand people. It was a warm-up for the [[Human Be-In]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfbg.com/entry.php?entry_id=4344&amp;catid=4&amp;volume_id=254&amp;issue_id=311&amp;volume_num=41&amp;issue_num=47&lt;/ref&gt; the following January, which brought 30,000 together and established media attention to hippie culture that then led to [[The Summer of Love]].

The '''Next Mars Orbiter''' ('''NeMO''', earlier known as the '''Mars 2022 orbiter''') is a proposed NASA [[Mars]] [[communications satellite]] with high-resolution imaging payload and two solar-electric [[ion thruster]]s.&lt;ref name="SFN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/2015/03/03/nasa-eyes-ion-engines-for-mars-orbiter-launching-in-2022/ |title=NASA eyes ion engines for Mars orbiter launching in 2022 |work=Spaceflight Now |last=Stephen |first=Clark |date=March 3, 2015 |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leone"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://spacenews.com/nasa-eyes-new-mars-orbiter-for-2022/ |title=NASA Eyes New Mars Orbiter for 2022 |work=Space News |last=Leone |first=Dan |date=February 24, 2015 |accessdate=March 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The orbiter was initially proposed to be launched in September 2022 to link ground controllers with rovers and landers and extend mapping capabilities expected to be lost when the ''[[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]'' and ''[[2001 Mars Odyssey]]'' stop functioning,&lt;ref name="SFN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="May 2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://images.spaceref.com/news/2016/NeMOIndustryDay.pdf |title=Conceptual Studies for the Next Mars Orbiter (NeMO), Industry Day |publisher=NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory |first1=Thomas |last1=Jedrey |first2=Robert |last2=Lock |first3=Mika |last3=Matsumoto |date=May 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but officials elected to focus on flying a sample-return mission first and incorporate a Mars telecom orbiter in that mission architecture, now envisioned for the late 2020s.&lt;ref name="back burner"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://spaceflightnow.com/2018/04/09/nasa-is-counting-on-long-lived-mars-orbiter-lasting-another-decade/ |title=NASA is counting on long-lived Mars orbiter lasting another decade |work=Spaceflight Now |first=Stephen |last=Clark |date=April 9, 2018 |accessdate=April 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
[[Image:HallThruster 2.jpg|thumb|left|2 kW Ion thruster in operation as part of the Hall Thruster Experiment at the [[Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory]].]]
Key features under study include solar electric [[ion drive]] engines, better [[solar array]]s, and broadband [[Laser communication in space|laser communications]] (optic communication) between Earth and Mars.&lt;ref name="SFN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dunbar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/scan/engineering/technology/txt_opticalcomm_benefits.html |title=Benefits of Optical Communications |publisher=NASA |editor-first=Thuy |editor-last=Mei |date=May 6, 2014 |accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The orbiter is conceptually similar to the [[Mars Telecommunications Orbiter]], canceled in 2005,&lt;ref name="Leone"/&gt; and could be a technology precursor for a future round-trip sample return mission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/msr/indepth |title=Mars Sample Return: In Depth |publisher=NASA |first=Bill |last=Dunford |accessdate=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and human expeditions to Mars.&lt;ref name="SFN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Concepts 2014"&gt;{{cite conference |title=Mars Sample Return Orbiter concepts using Solar Electric Propulsion for the post-Mars2020 decade |conference=2014 IEEE Aerospace Conference.

Concern in NASA is that the currently used relay satellites, ''2001 Mars Odyssey'' and ''Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter'', may stop functioning, resulting in the need to press the ''[[MAVEN]]'' science orbiter into use as a backup telecommunications relay.&lt;ref name="SFN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leone"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://astronaut.com/nasa-eyes-new-mars-orbiter-for-2022/ |title=NASA Eyes New Mars Orbiter for 2022 |work=Astronaut |first=Sebastien |last=Clarke |date=March 9, 2015 |accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the highly elliptical orbit of ''MAVEN'' limits its usefulness as a relay for surface operations,&lt;ref name="Telecom"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1407/27marstelecom/ |title=NASA considers commercial telecom satellites at Mars |work=Spaceflight Now |first=Stephen |last=Clark |date=July 27, 2014 |accessdate=September 23, 2014 |quote=It is due to arrive at Mars in September, but MAVEN's planned orbit is not ideal for collecting and sending rover data.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nasa20141110"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4370 |title=Newest NASA Mars Orbiter Demonstrates Relay Prowess |publisher=NASA |first1=Guy |last1=Webster |first2=Nancy |last2=Neal-Jones |id=2014-389 |date=November 10, 2014 |accessdate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA will lower its orbit from {{convert|6200|km|mi|abbr=values}} to between {{convert|4000|and|4500|km|mi|sp=us}} altitude, where it can serve as a relay while continuing its science mission.&lt;ref name='MAVEN relay orbit'&gt;{{cite news |url=http://spacenews.com/nasa-mars-exploration-efforts-turn-to-operating-existing-missions-and-planning-sample-return/ |title=NASA Mars exploration efforts turn to operating existing missions and planning sample return |work=Space news |first=Jeff |last=Foust |date=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another suggested feature under study is "the sample rendezvous capture and return capability." The samples cached by the [[Mars 2020]] rover would be placed in Mars orbit by a future Mars ascent vehicle. From there, the orbiter would rendezvous, transfer the samples into a capsule and send it back to Earth.&lt;ref name="Denver Museum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dmns.org/museum-blog/Post/?nid=23546 |title=NASA Eyes Sample-Return Capability for Post-2020 Mars Orbiter |last=Evans |first=Kim |work=Denver Museum of Nature and Science |date=October 13, 2015 |accessdate=November 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Propulsion===
The proposed orbiter would be propelled with two solar-electric [[ion thruster]]s; one engine would be active while the other one would be a spare.&lt;ref name="May 2016"/&gt;  Electrical power to the engines would be provided by advanced solar arrays that generate 20 kW.&lt;ref name="May 2016"/&gt;

An ion engine would give the spacecraft significant orbital flexibility for long-term support of future missions,&lt;ref name="May 2016"/&gt; opportunistic flybys of [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]],&lt;ref name="May 2016"/&gt; as well as the added capability of orbit support—rendezvous and capture—for a sample return mission.&lt;ref name="May 2016"/&gt;  An ion engine would also allow access to multiple latitudes and altitudes to optimize relay contacts.

===Suggested payload===
*Broadband [[Laser communication in space|laser communications]] (optic communication) between Earth and Mars&lt;ref name="SFN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leone"/&gt;&lt;ref name='Dunbar'/&gt;
*[[Image resolution|High resolution]] imager (30 cm/pixel)
*Potential for rendezvous and capture of soil samples
*Water ice detection and mapping&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Stephen |url=https://spaceflightnow.com/2016/07/27/nasa-developing-plans-for-commercially-built-mars-orbiter/ |title=NASA developing plans for commercially-built Mars orbiter |work=Spaceflight Now |date=July 27, 2016 |accessdate=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Potential for additional instruments from international partners

==Proposed sample return==

The orbiter mission has been suggested by the [[Planetary Science Decadal Survey]] to be one of three missions comprising the proposed [[Mars sample return mission|Mars Sample Return]] (MSR) campaign.&lt;ref name="Denver Museum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Planetary Decadal 2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sites.nationalacademies.org/cs/groups/ssbsite/documents/webpage/ssb_059308.pdf |title=Mission Concept Study: Planetary Science Decadal Survey - MSR Orbiter Mission (Including Mars Returned Sample Handling) |publisher=NASA |first=Richard |last=Mattingly |date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samples would be collected and cached by the first mission, the [[Mars 2020]] rover, and would be left on the surface of Mars for possible later retrieval.&lt;ref name="Planetary Decadal 2010"/&gt; The orbiter would be launched on a medium-class vehicle, reaching Mars in about nine months and set to aerobrake down to a {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} circular orbit over six to nine months. The third mission of the proposed MSR campaign, the lander, would nominally be launched two years after the orbiter launch. The lander would deploy a "fetch rover" to retrieve the sample caches. A container holding the samples would be launched by a Mars ascent vehicle (MAV) and placed in a 500&amp;nbsp;km orbit comparable with the new orbiter and perform a rendezvous while in Mars orbit.&lt;ref name="Planetary Decadal 2010"/&gt; The container would be transferred to an Earth entry vehicle (EEV) which would bring it to Earth, enter the atmosphere under a parachute and hard-land for retrieval and analyses in specially designed safe laboratories.&lt;ref name="Denver Museum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Planetary Decadal 2010"/&gt;

==Status==
Some NASA officials consider the Mars 2022 orbiter an "essential orbital support for sample return", "significant" in maintaining the Martian communications infrastructure, and desirable for the continuity in remote sensing.&lt;ref name="update March 2016"/&gt; The President's FY2017 Budget provided $10 million to begin early conceptual work on the proposed Mars orbiter.&lt;ref name="update March 2016"&gt;{{cite conference |last=Watzin |first=Jim |title=NASA Mars Exploration Program Update to the Planetary Science Subcommittee |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/pss/mar2016/presentations/Watzin-MEP.pdf |format=PDF |conference=Update to the Planetary Science Subcommittee |date=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6427 |title=NASA Seeks Industry Ideas for an Advanced Mars Satellite |publisher=NASA |first1=Dwayne |last1=Brown |first2=Laurie |last2=Cantillo |date=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2016 the Jet Propulsion Laboratory awarded five $400,000&lt;ref name="May 2016"/&gt; sub-contracts to conduct concept studies.

However, in August 2017, [[James L. Green|Jim Green]] of NASA's Planetary Science Division stated that a 2022 launch for the orbiter was "probably off the table", as it would be too difficult to assemble an orbiter with all of the desired features in that time frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Stephen |url=https://spaceflightnow.com/2017/08/28/nasa-studies-mission-to-return-samples-from-mars-by-end-of-2020s/ |title=NASA studies mission to return samples from Mars by end of 2020s |work=Spaceflight Now |date=August 28, 2017 |accessdate=August 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Watzin of NASA's Mars Exploration Program stated in September 2017 that the orbiter may have to be cancelled, citing that "the likelihood of all of the relay orbiters failing is so low that no more investments are needed for that purpose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://spacepolicyonline.com/news/todays-tidbits-september-25-2017/ |title=Watzin to MEPAG:  No 2022 Orbiter, No Decision on Helicopter |work=Space Policy Online |first=Marcia |last=Smith |date=September 25, 2017 |accessdate=October 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, NASA announced that it was moving ahead with plans to alter the orbit of the ''[[MAVEN]]'' orbiter to have it serve as a communications relay. It will be lowered to {{convert|4000|-|4500|km|mi|sp=us}} altitude, where it can serve as a relay while allowing it to continue its science mission.&lt;ref name="relay orbit"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://spacenews.com/nasa-mars-exploration-efforts-turn-to-operating-existing-missions-and-planning-sample-return/ |title=NASA Mars exploration efforts turn to operating existing missions and planning sample return |work=[[SpaceNews]] |first=Jeff |last=Foust |date=February 23, 2018 |accessdate=February 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, NASA officials decided that the ageing ''[[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]'' (MRO) will be managed such that it will continue service for about ten more years, and the program will now focus its resources on flying a sample-return mission first.&lt;ref name="back burner"/&gt; The ''[[2001 Mars Odyssey]]'' orbiter will also be managed to continue operating until about 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/41405-nasa-mars-odyssey-satellite |title=NASA Satellite Began Mars Odyssey 16 Years Ago and Is Still Going Strong |work=Inverse |first=Alasdair |last=Wilkins |date=February 19, 2018 |accessdate=May 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new Mars relay orbiter is likely to take part in the sample-return architecture envisioned for the late 2020s.&lt;ref name="back burner"/&gt;

'''''Orange Man''''' is a British [[television advertisement]] for the soft drink [[Tango (drink)|Tango Orange]]. Created by advertising agency [[HHCL]] (Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury and Partners), a longtime collaborator of Tango who would go on to create many of their advertisements, the advertisement was produced in 1991 and aired in 1992, and became the first in the brand's "You Know When You've Been Tango'd" campaign that would continue until 1996 before returning for several years in the 2000s.

The advertisement features an orange man slapping a Tango drinker across the cheeks, a [[:wikt:wacky|wacky]] metaphor for tasting Tango, and was intended as a reaction against the norm of "cause and effect" television advertising at the time was largely focused on scenarios where peoples lives were improved by the product being advertised. ''Orange Man'' caused controversy after reports of injuries when children began copying the events of the advertisement in school playgrounds, and was subsequently banned, with two other versions of ''Orange Man'' replacing it, both showing different scenarios aside from slapping.

Despite the controversy, it contributed to a boost of sales by more than a third, and has gained acclaim in later years, even featuring and ranking highly in several lists of the greatest advertisements ever made. A [[Channel 4]]/''[[The Sunday Times]]'' poll in 2000 named ''Orange Man'' the third best advertisement of all time. It has also been credited as pioneering [[viral marketing]] and [[guerrilla marketing]]. Different commentators have named it the best advertisement for Tango and the best advertisement created by HHCL. ''Orange Man'' precedes other Tango advertisements that have been banned, and has been parodied several times.

==Plot==
{{multiple image|align=right|image1=Now Show 2005 Hugh Dennis.jpg|width1={{#expr: (112) round 0}}|image2=Ray Wilkins 18-10-2008 1.jpg|width2={{#expr: (115) round 0}}|image3=Gil Scott Heron.jpg|width3={{#expr: (110) round 0}}|footer=Voice actors [[Hugh Dennis]], [[Ray Wilkins]] and [[Gil Scott-Heron]].||}}
The advertisement begins with three young men standing outside a fruit shop or cornershop. One of them takes a sip out of a can of Tango he is holding. The voice-over of "commentators" Ralph and Tony (voiced by [[Hugh Dennis]] and [[Ray Wilkins]]) appear. Ralph says "oh, I think we could use a video replay here" and the footage of the man drinking the Tango is "rewound" (with the visual effect of a tape recorded being rewound on screen) to some ten seconds before he drinks the Tango, for a "replay". Then, a man painted completely orange (Peter Geeves) comes onto the scene, who runs around the men and then taps the Tango drinker on the back.

The Tango drinker turns around, and the orange man slaps him across the cheeks, and then runs off, leaving the drinker startled, although the other men beside the drinker do not observe or respond to the orange man and the slap. Ralph becomes excited as he reveals this to be "Tango taste sensation" and asks Tony to rewind the clip again to the same point as before, this time showing the orange man sprint out from behind a [[pillar box]] and shows the same events as before with Ralph and Tony providing commentary. The advertisement ends with the drinker looking at his Tango can in question, followed by a behind shot of the Tango can on top of the orange man's head, which bears the slogan "You Know When You've Been Tango'd". A deep male voice ([[Gil Scott-Heron]]) says the slogan at the same time.

==Conception and production==

===Background===
At the time of the advertisement's production, successful soft drink television advertising was dominated by [[Coca-Cola]]; Trevor Robinson, co-creator of ''Orange Man'', recalled that "Coca-Cola was the big name in soft-drink advertising then. Nothing was taking on the Coke ads; nothing came close."&lt;ref name="guardian-robinson"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2015/jun/15/how-we-made-you-know-youve-been-tango-orange-man-ad |title=How we Tango'd Britain with the Orange Man |first=Trevor |last=Robinson |date=15 June 2015 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson recalled that "cause and effect advertising" was very popular on British advertisement at the time, which he described as advertisements where "you come into contact with the product and somehow it changes your life for the better, was a big trend."&lt;ref name="guardian-robinson"/&gt; The most recent television advertising campaign for Tango at the time was a series of advertisements featuring the slogan "the whole fruit" that had aired from 1987–1991. These advertisements featured musical soundtracks throughout and lacked the surreal humour that would later dominate the soft drink's advertising from ''Orange Man'' onwards.

===Conception===
[[Britvic]], who had acquired the Tango brand in 1988, were looking to radicalize Tango's image and advertising. They hired London-based advertising agency [[HHCL|Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury and Partners]] (HHCL) to create a brand new television advertisement for the brand, which would form the basis of a new advertising campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.londonlovesbusiness.com/entrepreneurs/fast-growing-businesses-and-sme/steve-henry-mad-man/201.article |title=Steve Henry: Mad man - Interviews |work=LondonlovesBusiness.com |accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; HHCL, who had been operating since 1987, had earned a reputation in the business for breaking several norms in advertising and established a [[avant-garde]] theme in 1989, when, in launching the [[direct banking]] service, [[First Direct]], aired two advertisements simultaneously on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and [[Channel 4]], interrupting an [[Audi]] advert, one offering an optimistic and the other a pessimistic view, and a number of short, surreal spots in which the visual had little or nothing to do with the message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/1032222/first-direct-celebrates-21-years-launch |title=First Direct celebrates 21 years since launch |work=campaignlive.co.uk |accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Orange Man'' was created by HHCL, using their staff [[Trevor Robinson (advertising)|Trevor Robinson OBE]] as [[art director]], Al Young as [[copywriter]], John Leach as planner, Axle Chaldecott and Steve Henry as [[creative director]]s and Matt Forrest as director.&lt;ref name="guardian-robinson" /&gt; Production company Limelight also worked on the project.&lt;ref name="guardian-robinson" /&gt; Robinson and Young were creative partners, and were "pretty anti-advertising in [their] mindsets" at the time because of their boredom and frustration with the industry norm of "cause and effect advertising", and were desperate to make a name for themselves after "spending what felt like eons trying to get into a [[West End of London|West End]] agency."&lt;ref name="guardian-robinson" /&gt;

Robinson said that the nucleus of their idea for ''Orange Man'' came as a reaction to cause and effect advertising, and that he and the team decided to focus on [[word of mouth]] as their media, which was a reaction to Coca-Cola's big budget dominance in soft drink advertising.&lt;ref name="guardian-robinson"/&gt; He told [[Channel 4]] in 2000 that the advertisement was "meant to be taking the mickey out of other ads that were on the television at the time", comparing it to [[coffee]] advertisements where "they have a drink and go 'oh, whoopy' and flowers bloom," noting that ''Orange Man'' decided to "express this in an really OTT fashion".&lt;ref name="C42000"&gt;[[Channel 4]] ''100 Greatest Ads'', 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for the advertisement originally started out as a joke, with Robinson recalling "We said how brilliant it would be if you had a drink and something shocking happened, but so quickly that nobody else saw it. We also had the idea that it was only when commentators rewound the film that you could see what had happened."&lt;ref name="guardian-robinson" /&gt; The idea to use commentators in the advert were taken from another idea they had for another advert, but they decided to mash the two ideas together, a "cardinal sin in adland."&lt;ref name="guardian-robinson"/&gt; One commentary considered the advertisement to be a "riff on the sort of sports commentary [[Andy Gray (footballer, born 1955)|Andy Gray]] with his video tapes and ranty shouting at the time."&lt;ref name="adturds"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adturds.co.uk/2015/03/30/tango-adverts-you-know-when-youve-been-tangod/ |title=Tango Adverts and Campaigns: Heroes Of AdTurds |date=30 March 2015 |work=adturds.co.uk |accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of course, the advertising authority at the time, the [[Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre|BACC]], said no way.

The project, including research, lasted two to three months in 1991.&lt;ref name="guardian-robinson"/&gt; The plot of the advertisement originally involved the orange man punching the Tango drinker in the mouth, as they were trying to make the advertisement as "stupid" and slapstick as possible; before they then changed the idea to the orange man kicking Tango drinker up the buttocks, but both ideas were deemed too aggressive,&lt;ref name="C42000"/&gt; so their final idea of the orange man slapping the drinker across the cheeks, described by Robinson as a "[[Morecambe and Wise]]-esque little tap on the cheeks," was used.&lt;ref name="C42000"/&gt;

The team originally used American football commentators, but we were asked to make "everything more British," so they hired English actor [[Hugh Dennis]] to perform the voice of Ralph and ex-footballer [[Ray Wilkins]] to perform the voice of Tony; Robinson recalled that Dennis' "[[Eddie Waring]]-esque commentary" was deliberately intended to contrasted with the "dry and amusing delivery" of Wilkins.&lt;ref name="guardian-robinson" /&gt; Actors that were intended for the role of the Tango drinker were passed over as they did not like the idea of being slapped; the role ultimately went to an actor whose identity has not been discussed.&lt;ref name="ITV2006"&gt;[[ITV1]]'s greatest adverts list "ITV's Best Ads Ever 2", from 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson praised him, saying that he was a "really good actor, and he was just the best at reacting to being hit, he never made a big deal out of it," calling his performance "cool and dopey."&lt;ref name="C42000"/&gt;

The orange man was portrayed by serious up-and-coming actor Peter Geeves; the advert's co-creator Al Young recalled that "the guy we used [Geeves] was like a Shakespearean actor," and noted that out of all who auditioned for the role, "he was the one who made [the creators] laugh the most," adding that the way he ran "was surreal".&lt;ref name="C42000"/&gt; Robinson recalled, "We knew as soon as he auditioned – the way he ran with his stomach sticking out – that he'd be perfect."&lt;ref name="guardian-robinson" /&gt; Geeves recalled in 2006, "I was asked to first of all run around, then run around and scream, then run around screaming topless, it was at that point I thought 'aye-aye, this isn't the normal run of the mill advert'."&lt;ref name="ITV2006"/&gt; The orange paint on him was orange grease paint fixed with [[hair spray|hairspray]], which took several weeks to remove after filming.&lt;ref name="ITV2006"/&gt; Geeves himself was scared of hitting the finally chosen actor in the role of the Tango drinker too hard, though the actor did not mind, telling him a hard hit would "make it look real".&lt;ref name="ITV2006"/&gt;

Robinson and Young went to the shooting location–a park–to do a test film, which essentially involved them "mucking about, 'Tangoing' each other;" as they "messed around" they decided the "little slap" just wasn't powerful enough, so they exaggerated it; Robinson recalled that "if you watch the ad, the Orange Man's arms go way back before he slaps the person in the face."&lt;ref name="guardian-robinson"/&gt; Seminal American [[jazz poetry|jazz poet]] [[Gil Scott-Heron]] was hired to perform the voice who says the slogan at the end because of "his deep, charismatic voice;" Scott-Heron was the first person to see the final advert, and, much to the relief of a fearful Robinson, he loved it.&lt;ref name="guardian-robinson" /&gt;

==Broadcast and controversy==
Although ''Orange Man'' was produced in 1991, it is not believed to have aired on British television until 1992 on television channels such as [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and [[Channel 4]], where it became the first advertisement in the "You Know When You've Been Tango'd" campaign, which would continue until 1996 before being revived from 2002–2005. ''Orange Man'' was an instant success; Robinson recalled in 2015 that "I first knew the ad was huge when I fell asleep on the [[London Underground]] one evening. I woke up to hear a group of kids talking about and mimicking it. I wanted to go up and say: 'I did that!'"&lt;ref name="guardian-robinson" /&gt;

Nonetheless, ''Orange Man'' soon sparked large controversy in the media and in public after it was discovered children had copied the events of the advertisement in playgrounds and injured themselves; Rupert Howell, a Tango advertisement executive, stated in 2000 that ''Orange Man'' "sparked a playground craze" where "people used to go round sort of slapping each other and saying 'You've Been Tango'd', and it was all very entertaining and great fun. There were no problems until we got a phone call once from a surgeon who said 'look, I'm not the complaining type but I thought you'd like to know that I did an operation on a child this morning with a damaged ear drum, and I was wheeling him in to the operating table, and said to him 'what happened to you then?' and replied 'I got Tango'd.'"&lt;ref name="C42000"/&gt; As a result, Howell pulled the advertisement from television that afternoon,&lt;ref name="C42000"/&gt; although other reports erroneously state that the advertisement was banned.&lt;ref name="curveball"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.curveball-media.co.uk/blog/banned-adverts-and-shock-advertising/ |title=Banned Adverts And Shock Advertising |work=curveball-media.co.uk |accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Orange Man'' was replaced by two similar versions of the advertisement, the first of these instead showing the orange man putting his hand on the Tango drinker's mouth and kissing it,&lt;ref name="curveball"/&gt; and the other, which came later, showing the Tango drinker simply running off as the orange man approaches him. The former version was noted by Howell to be "just as good",&lt;ref name="C42000"/&gt; although presenter [[Phillip Schofield]] comically noted in a later commentary that "happy kissing never really caught on."&lt;ref name="ITV2006"/&gt; These later versions were also changed to incorporate the recently redesigned Tango Orange can.

==Reception and legacy==
Despite the controversy, ''Orange Man'' was very successful at rising Tango's sales and profile, and sales of Tango Orange rose by more than a third following the airing of ''Orange Man''.&lt;ref name="adturds"/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph-mills"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/2745199/Slap-in-the-face-from-Tango.html |title=Slap in the face from Tango |first=Dominic |last=Mills |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=11 December 2001 |accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such was its success that in 2001, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' noted that the brand "eclipsed" the brand's better-known competitors due to the advertisement.&lt;ref name="telegraph-mills"/&gt; The public received ''Orange Man'' with great acclaim,&lt;ref name="ben-priest"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/1392131/3-great-ads-i-nothing-31-ben-priest-tango-lynx-levis |title=3 great ads I had nothing to do with #31: Ben Priest on Tango, Lynx and Levi's |work=campaignlive.co.uk |accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but regardless, at the time of its broadcast, television advertising tended to be very slick with "beautiful scripting" and big budgets, so most of the advertising industry did not enjoy ''Orange Man'', with one of the big advertising professionals, who has remained unspecified, calling it "oik advertising."&lt;ref name="guardian-robinson" /&gt; However, HHCL "loved that" and felt they were brave enough to "do stuff that nobody else would do, or think about doing," with Robinsion rhapsodizing in an article he wrote in 2015 that "I think that's what made the ad what it is. Now, years later, that's what makes my own agency what it is."&lt;ref name="guardian-robinson" /&gt;

Despite the original industry hostility, critical favour towards ''Orange Man'' has increased in later times and has gone on to become considered one of the greatest television advertisements of all time by numerous sources;  in 2000, ''Orange Man'' was ranked at number 3 in [[Channel 4]] and ''[[The Sunday Times]]''{{'}} poll of the "100 Greatest TV Ads Ever."&lt;ref name="C4-100greatest"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-100-greatest-tv-adverts/articles/results |title=The 100 Greatest TV Adverts - Features - Results |website=Channel 4 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719002226/http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-100-greatest-tv-adverts/articles/results |archivedate=19 July 2012 |accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Channel 4 aired the final top 100 of the poll on 29 April 2000 as part of their ''[[100 Greatest (UK TV series)|100 Greatest]]'' series.&lt;ref name="C4-100greatest"/&gt; In 2006, [[ITV (network)|ITV]] ranked the advertisement ranked at number 5 in its list of "ITV's Best Ads Ever 2", a list of the top 20 television advertisements ever broadcast on the channel.&lt;ref name="ITV2006"/&gt; In the commentary for the latter list, ''Orange Man'' is credited as a humorous precursor to [[happy slapping]].&lt;ref name="ITV2006"/&gt; Sarah McCartney referred to the advertisement in her 2011 book ''100 Great Branding Ideas: From Leading Companies Around the World'', where she comments that despite the controversy surrounding its slogan, "the phrase had captured the public's imagination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KduIAAAAQBAJ |title=100 Great Branding Ideas: From leading companies around the world |first=Sarah |last=McCartney |date=15 December 2011 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd |accessdate=13 July 2016 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Ben Priest, founding partner and chief creative officer at communications agency adam&amp;eveDDB, included the advert in his list of "3 Great Ads I Had Nothing to Do With", part of a series for ''[[Campaign (magazine)|Campaign Live]]'', where he said "the hype it created and the fondness with which people remember the ad makes it one of the most successful of its time."&lt;ref name="ben-priest"/&gt;

In 2013, ''[[The Guardian]]'' referred to Tango as the "original gangster of [[viral marketing]]", saying that ''Orange Man'' "was all it took to engage viewers", and that no "Tango crusade since has managed to recapture that lightning in a 500ml bottle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jul/13/tango-new-tv-advert |title=Tango, the new TV advert |first=Graeme |last=Virtue |date=13 July 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marketing Society's website The Library states that ''Orange Man'' is the reason why Tango is included in their list of the "golden brands of 1992".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.marketingsociety.com/the-library/golden-brands-1992 |title=Golden brands of 1992 - Marketing Articles, Market Leader 2012 |work=marketingsociety.com |accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, ''[[Campaign (magazine)|Campaign Live]]'' stated that "no commercial better symbolized the creative iconoclasm of [[HHCL|Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury]] during the early 90s" than ''Orange Man'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/thework/890039/ |title=Tango 'orange man' by Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury |work=campaignlive.co.uk |accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and presenter [[Jenni Falconer]] said the advert was "brilliant, and everybody loved it and everyone thought it was great."&lt;ref name="ITV2006"/&gt; In Nicholas Kochan's 1997 book ''The World's Greatest Brands'', he wrote that the advertisement "succeeded not only in entertaining its audience but also in communicating its taste attributes–the "hit" of real oranges," adding that "the ad's fun scenarios of 'being hooked on Tango' have been extended into other promotions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LDqvCwAAQBAJ |title=The World's Greatest Brands |first=Nick |last=Kochan |date=25 November 1996 |publisher=Springer |accessdate=13 July 2016 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Orange Man'' is also credited by Curveball Media for pioneering what would later become known as [[guerilla advertising]],&lt;ref name="curveball"/&gt; with Tim Delaney of Legas Delaney saying "the whole point was that this radical, strong, full-of-attitude campaign worked – it shifted cans of fizzy pop in a way that got Britvic's rivals panicking. It also showed what potential there was in thinking of completely fresh ideas. And better than that – it became part of our culture."&lt;ref name="curveball"/&gt; Trevor Robinson told ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2015 that "You can say 'Tango ad' to people and they still remember it. Some even dress up as the Orange Man today. That, for me, is what makes a piece of work great – when the general public take it on, play with it and it becomes theirs."&lt;ref name="guardian-robinson" /&gt; In the mid-1990s, ''Orange Man'' appeared on the brand's promotional [[VHS tape]] ''Now That's What I Call Tango 3'', which contained  multiple advertisements for the brand from ''Orange Man'' until the publication of the VHS tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72KiFSFxwTA |title=Tango tape |author=TheUKadverts |date=1 August 2010 |accessdate=13 July 2016 |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
''Orange Man'' was the first of Tango advertisements produced by HHCL, who would work with the brand for many years after, and is now credited as the first of the brand's controversies, as later advertisements for the brand were also banned; in 2000 a "Tango Megaphone" advertisement was banned for fears it provoked bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Tango%20advert%20ditched%20over%20bully%20fears.-a060845806 |title=Tango advert ditched over bully fears |work=Free Online Library |accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/article/66466/britvic-stands-banned-tango-ad |title=Britvic stands by banned Tango ad |work=marketingmagazine.co.uk |accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-archer"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/mar/10/tvandradio.television2 |title=Who are you?

''Orange Man'' was parodied in a sketch from a 1992 episode of ''[[The Real McCoy (TV series)|The Real McCoy]]'' that also parodies the assault of [[Rodney King]], showing the Tango drinker, an actor portraying King, getting assaulted by the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] after drinking a "Tango'd" can in his car, ending with the slogan "You Know When You Have Been [[Los Angeles Police Department|L.A.P.D'd]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSXaiyRZBY8 |title=Tango'd   L.A.P.D.'D  (The Real McCoy) |author=TICE123 |date=8 May 2009 |accessdate=13 July 2016 |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tango themselves later parodied the slap in a 1997 advertisement, ''Vote Orange Tango'', which was a parody of a [[party political broadcast]] that was broadcast in the run-up to the [[1997 general election (UK)|1997 general election]]; the advertisement sees a mock politician criticising the flavours of the drink that were not orange before praising the orange flavour, with a man painted orange later slapping the politician's cheeks several times with an orange fish as part of the politician's parade to celebrate the orange flavour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwnB1GxFNgA |title=Tango vote 1997 |author=benjaminbunnyboy |date=20 September 2009 |accessdate=13 July 2016 |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campaign===
[[File:Sodas.JPG|thumb|By 1994, the "You Know When You've Been Tango'd" campaign had helped Tango to double its share on the [[soft drink|soft drinks market]].]]
''Orange Man'' marked the debut for the highly successful "You Know When You've Been Tango'd" television campaign, created by HHCL throughout its first run, which would continue in its first run until 1996. Although ''Orange Man'' was the most notorious of the advertisements, other advertisements in the campaign also proved to be controversial and were banned, including ''Exploding Pensioner'' (1993) which offended pensioners and several charity groups such as [[Age Concern]],&lt;ref name="adturds"/&gt; ''Scotsman'' (1994)–which featured a legless, blue afro-sporting orange Scotsman–for scaring children,&lt;ref name="adturds"/&gt; and another 1994 advertisement featuring a man's head pop off from his body, which was banned during children's programming for also being too frightening.&lt;ref name="youtube-banned"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILPCDMIcjuA |title=Frightening Tango ad for adults only |author=Crosbie, Paul|work=Daily Express|date=27 April 1994|accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, by 1994, the campaign had helped Tango double its share on the soft drinks market.&lt;ref name="youtube-banned"/&gt; One commentary later said "While it's a matter of debate as to how offensive these ads were deemed, as opposed to how good HHCL were at pretending they were offensive and exploiting the publicity, the phrase 'You Know When You've Been Tango'd' wasn't going anywhere for the next decade."&lt;ref name="adturds"/&gt;

In May 2002, the "You Know When You've Been Tango'd" campaign relaunched with the advertisements ''Helmet'' and ''Porcupine'' on the tenth anniversary of the campaign and ''Orange Man'', although this campaign was created by Chi instead of HHCL, who ended their ten-year relationship the year before.&lt;ref name="tango-chi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/close-up-live-issue-tango-chi-believes-tangod-drinks-greatest-asset-britvics-new-tango-agency-not-meant-change-tactics/144977 |title=CLOSE-UP: LIVE ISSUE/TANGO - CHI believes being Tango'd is still the drink's greatest asset. Britvic's new Tango agency has not meant a change in tactics |work=campaignlive.co.uk |accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these advertisements were intended to hark back to the "irreverent orange hit" motif established in ''Orange Man''.&lt;ref name="tango-chi"/&gt; In 2004, the ''[[Pipes (advertisement)|Pipes]]'' advertisement from the campaign, which drew comparisons to ''Orange Man'' in the media, was banned, becoming the last Tango advertisement to do so; however the ban was not because children had already injured themselves, but because there were fears that children were going to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4004867.stm |title=Watchdog bans Tango advertisement |date=11 November 2004 |website=BBC News |accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2006, Tango's main rival drink, [[Fanta]], aired an advertisement with similarly saw a man being slapped, however unlike ''Orange Man'' it escaped being banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sweney |first=Mark |title=Fanta 'slap' ads escape ban |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/aug/02/advertising2 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=2 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Polly'''" is a song by the [[United States|American]] [[Rock music|rock]] band, [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], written by vocalist and guitarist, [[Kurt Cobain]]. It is the sixth song on their second album, ''[[Nevermind]]'', released in September 1991.

==History==
Originally titled "Hitchhiker" and later "Cracker," "Polly" dates back to at least 1988. The earliest known version is a home demo featuring Cobain on vocals and guitar.

The song was first recorded in the studio by [[Steve Fisk]] at Music Source in [[Seattle, Washington]] in August, 1989. The sessions were for a planned EP to coincide with the band's European tour, but only two of the five songs recorded, "Stain" and "[[Been a Son]]," were officially released, on the ''[[Blew]]'' EP later that year.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{cite book|title=Nirvana FAQ: All That's Left to Know About the Most Important Band of the 1990s|last=Luerssen|first=John D.|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|date=2014|isbn=978-1-61713-588-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 26, 1989, the band recorded a version during their first [[BBC]] ''[[John Peel|Peel Session]]'', at Maida Vale Studios in [[London, England]]. The session, engineered by Ted de Bono, was originally broadcast on November 22, 1989.&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;

The song was re-recorded by [[Butch Vig]] at [[Smart Studios]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] in April 1990. This acoustic version, featuring [[Chad Channing]] on drums, later appeared on the band's major label debut, ''[[Nevermind]]'', released in September 1991. It was the only recording from Vig's original session with the band to appear on the album, the rest of which was recorded by Vig in May 1991 at [[Sound City Studios]] in [[Van Nuys]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first1=Charles R.|last1=Cross|authorlink=Charles R.

"I didn't bother changing the strings," Cobain told Jeff Gilbert in a 1992 ''[[Guitar World]]'' interview. "It barely stays in tune. In fact, I had to use duct tape to hold the tuning keys in place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jeff|first1=Gilbert|title=Cool Hand Puke: Kurt Cobain tries to explain why Nirvana — third-hand guitars and all — is suddenly the hottest band in the country|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/artists/kurt-cobain-talks-gear-and-more-his-final-guitar-world-interview-1992|magazine=[[Guitar World]]|publisher=NewBay Media|location=New York City|date=February 1992|edition=February 20, 2018|accessdate=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vig remembers that the guitar's "strings were so old they didn't have any tone to them. A real plunky sound."&lt;ref name="classic rock albums"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Charles|last1=Cross|authorlink=Charles R.

The band recorded another version of the song for the BBC on November 9, 1991 at Maida Vale in London during their appearance on Radio 1's ''[[Mark Goodier|Mark Goodier Radio Session]]''. The session, their last for the BBC, was first broadcast on November 18, 1991,&lt;ref name="Rough Guide"&gt;{{cite book|first=Gillian G.|last=Gaar|title=The Rough Guide to Nirvana|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|location=New York City|date=2009|isbn=978-1-4053-8119-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three of the four songs from the session, including "Polly," appeared on the band's compilation album ''[[Incesticide]]'' on December 1992. This faster version of the song appeared under the title "(New Wave) Polly."

==Composition and lyrics==
{{Wikiquote|Nevermind}}
Cobain wrote "Polly" about an incident in [[Tacoma, Washington]] involving the abduction and rape of a 14-year-old girl in August 1987.&lt;ref name="Azerrad"&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Azerrad|title=[[Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana]]|publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]|location=New York City|date=1993|ISBN=0-86369-746-1|page=321}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerald Friend|Gerald Arthur Friend]] kidnapped the girl while she was leaving a rock concert, suspended her upside down from a pulley in his mobile home and raped and tortured her with a blow torch.&lt;ref name="companion"&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Rocco|title=The Nirvana companion: two decades of commentary: a chronicle of the end of punk|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ii0UAQAAIAAJ|publisher=[[Schirmer Books]]|location=New York City|year=1998|isbn=0-02-864930-3|page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="av club"&gt;{{cite book|first=Chuck|last=Klosterman|authorlink=Chuck Klosterman|author2=A.V.

In his 2001 biography ''[[Heavier than Heaven]]'', [[Charles R. Cross|Charles Cross]] compared to the song to [[Truman Capote|Truman Capote's]] ''[[In Cold Blood]]'' in that it was written from the criminal's point of view.&lt;ref name="heavier"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Charles R.|last1=Cross|authorlink=Charles R. Cross|title=Heavier Than Heaven|date=August 15, 2001|publisher=[[Hyperion Books]]|location=New York City|isbn=0-7868-6505-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his Nirvana biography ''Come As You Are'', journalist [[Michael Azerrad]] noted that rape seemed to be a consistent theme in Cobain's songs and interviews, as if Cobain was "apologizing for his entire gender." However, Cobain explained, "I don't feel bad about being a man at all. There are all kinds of men that are on the side of the woman and support them and help influence other men."&lt;ref name="Azerrad"/&gt; In the liner notes to the band's 1992 compilation album ''[[Incesticide]]'', Cobain wrote that "last year, a girl was raped by two wastes of sperm and eggs while they sang the lyrics to our song 'Polly'.  I have a hard time carrying on knowing there are plankton like that in our audience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Matthew|last1=Reyes|title=When Nirvana and Pearl Jam Stood Up for Feminism|url=https://medium.com/cuepoint/when-nirvana-and-pearl-jam-stood-up-for-feminism-96ec0b5c13|website=[[Medium (website)|Medium]]|publisher=A Medium Corporation|location=San Francisco, California|date=September 8, 2016|accessdate=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lindsay|first1=Cam|title='Incesticide' Is Nirvana's Best Record Because It Reveals Their Contradictions|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/article/pgp7xb/incesticide-is-nirvanas-best-record-because-it-reveals-their-contradictions|website=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|publisher=[[Vice Media]]|location=Brooklyn, New York|date=January 12, 2017|accessdate=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nirvana recorded "Polly" in the key of [[E minor]] with the chords E5-G5-D5-C5 for all verses and then the chords D5-C5-G5-B♭5 for all choruses. The song starts with Cobain playing the verse progression on an acoustic guitar and singing the vocals until the first chorus when bass enters and a cymbal crash is played. This is done for all verses and choruses. After the second chorus the guitar stops playing and a bass break starts. According to ''Nevermind'' producer [[Butch Vig]] on ''Classic Albums: Nevermind'', Cobain sang the line "Polly said" too early, but they decided to leave it in.&lt;ref name="classic rock albums"/&gt; The song ends with a final cymbal crash after the third chorus.

==Reception==
"Polly" was ranked number 18 in ''[[NME|NME's ]]'' 2004 "Top 20 Nirvana Songs" list. In 2015, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked it number 29 in their ranking of 102 Nirvana songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first1=Julianne Escobedo|last1=Shepherd|title=No Apologies: All 102 Nirvana Songs Ranked|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/no-apologies-all-102-nirvana-songs-ranked-20150408/polly-new-wave-polly-20150408|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Wenner Media LLC|location=New York City|date=April 8, 2015|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Heavier than Heaven'', American singer-songwriter [[Bob Dylan]] was impressed with "Polly" upon hearing the song while at a Nirvana concert, remarking of Cobain that "that kid has heart."&lt;ref name="heavier"/&gt;

[[File:St Martin's Hall.jpg|thumb|270px|c.1850 print of the interior of St Martin's Hall]]
The '''Queen's Theatre''' in London was established in 1867 as a theatre on the site of '''St Martin's Hall''', a large concert room that had opened in 1850. It stood on the corner of [[Long Acre]] (formerly Charles Street) and Endell Street, with entrances in Wilson Street and Long Acre. The site is within the modern [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]], part of [[Covent Garden]].&lt;ref name=Tufts&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2000.01.0004&amp;query=head%3D%2336 Walter Thornbury ''Old and New London: A Narrative of its History, its People and its Places. Illustrated with Numerous Engravings from the Most Authentic Sources.: Volume 3''], accessed 1 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

St Martin's Hall contained a 3,000-seat main hall and a 500-seat lecture hall. It was used for musical recitals, lectures and political meetings. The Queen's Theatre, one of the largest in London, had a capacity of 4,000 seats. The theatre closed after barely more than a decade, in 1878.

The name Queen's Theatre has been used for other theatres in central London, including the [[Queen's Theatre, Dorset Garden]] (from 1685 to 1705), [[Her Majesty's Theatre]] (from 1705 to 1714), [[Scala Theatre]] (during the period 1831&amp;ndash;1865) and the modern [[Queen's Theatre]] in [[Shaftesbury Avenue]] (since 1907).

==History==
===St Martin's Hall===
St Martin's Hall was built for [[John Pyke Hullah|John Hullah]], in 1847, by [[William Cubitt]], from a design by [[Richard Westmacott (the younger)|Richard Westmacott]]. The scheme was financed by subscription and it was built on a parallelogram of land, {{convert|149|ft|m|1}} by {{convert|61|ft|m|1}} wide, connected to a plot on Long Acre ({{convert|44|ft|m|1}} by {{convert|22|ft|m|1}}); and consisted of a main hall with connected anterooms, galleries and a 500&amp;ndash;seat lecture hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/QueensLongacre.htm ''St. Martin's Music Hall''] 16 February 1850 ''The Builder'', at Arthur Lloyd theatre history site, accessed 1 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It was built in the [[Tudor era|Elizabethan style]], with a large domed iron roof.  The music hall was capable of seating 3,000 persons and was opened in 1850 by Hullah, the founder of a new "school of choral harmony". In addition to his singing classes, Hullah directed oratorios and concerts, both instrumental and vocal, at the hall. The hall was then used for musical recitals, lectures and political meetings.&lt;ref name=Tufts/&gt;

The [[German Reed Entertainments]] were initially presented here in 1855 &amp;ndash; known as "Miss P. Horton's Illustrative Gatherings" &amp;ndash; before moving to the more intimate [[Gallery of Illustration]] and later [[St. George's Hall, London|St George's Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williamson|first=David, ed.|year=1895|title=The German Reeds and [[Richard Corney Grain|Corney Grain]]; records and reminiscences|location=London|publisher=A.D. Innes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Dickens]] first appeared as a public lecturer in St Martin's Hall, in April, 1858, speaking on behalf of the Hospital for Sick Children, in [[Great Ormond Street]]. A week or two later, he spoke on his own account.&lt;ref name=Tufts/&gt;

On 26 August 1860, a fire broke out in a nearby coach factory and the hall was destroyed, together with its organ.&lt;ref name="Tufts" /&gt; The hall was rebuilt as a concert hall, opening in 1862. The [[First International]] was founded in St Martin's Hall in 1864. The final musical entertainment was given in 1867.&lt;ref name="Tufts" /&gt;

===Queen's theatre===
In 1867, a 4,000-seat theatre was built within the shell of the existing building by [[Charles J. Phipps|C. J. Phipps]]&lt;ref name=Tufts/&gt; for [[Henry Labouchère]] and his partners, with interior decoration by [[Albert Joseph Moore|Albert Moore]] and Telbin.&lt;ref&gt;Sherson p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; A new company of players was formed, including [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Charles Wyndham]], [[Henry Irving]], [[J. L. Toole]], [[Lionel Brough]], [[Ellen Terry]] and [[Henrietta Hodson]]. The theatre opened as the New Queen's Theatre, with a production of [[Charles Reade]]'s ''The Double Marriage'' on 24 October 1867.  An early success was ''Dearer Than Life'', by [[H. J. Byron]], with Brough, Toole, Wyndham, Hodson and Irving, coupled with [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s ''[[La Vivandière (Gilbert)|La Vivandière]]'', a [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] of ''[[La fille du régiment]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sherson, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;  The theatre continued with melodrama, adaptions and classic revivals, dropping the epithet 'new' the following year.

[[File:Turn-of-the-tide.jpg|thumb|left|1869 programme]]
Initially, the management was run by the actor [[Alfred Wigan]], who also appeared in its productions. By 1868, Hodson and Labouchère were living together out of wedlock,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labouchere.co.uk/linkpages/labbyanddora.htm ''Labby and Dora''] (Labouchere genealogy site) accessed 1 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; as they could not marry until her first husband finally died in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1883/01/17/106245396.pdf ''London Facts and Gossip''] 17 January 1883 ''[[The New York Times]]'' accessed 1 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Labouchère bought out his partners and used the theatre to showcase Hodson's talents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchiveTextH/HenriettaHodson.html Feature on Hodson in Footlights Notes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707060227/http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchiveTextH/HenriettaHodson.html |date=7 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre hosted comedies, such as [[F. C. Burnand]]'s ''The Turn of the Tide'' (1869, starring [[Hermann Vezin]] and [[George Rignold]] with Hodson), historical dramas, such as [[Tom Taylor]]'s ''Twixt Axe and Crown'' (1870), popular revivals of [[Shakespeare]] (starring such famous actors as [[Samuel Phelps]]) and [[Tommaso Salvini]], dramatisations of Dickens novels, burlesques and [[extravaganza]]s. Although the theatre was among the largest and best equipped in London, and featured some of London's most famous stars, it lacked the guidance of an actor-manager of the stature of [[Henry Irving]] or [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]].&lt;ref&gt;Sherson pp. 209&amp;ndash;10&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877, the theatre became the National Theatre and hosted a series of promenade concerts under Riviere and [[Alfred Cellier]]&lt;ref&gt;Sherson p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; followed by an ambitious dramatisation of ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii]]'' ([[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Lord Lytton]]'s eponymous novel) that was meant to feature a staged eruption of Vesuvius, an earthquake and a sybriatic Roman feast.  However, the earth did not quake, the volcano did not erupt, acrobats fell onto the cast below, and the production was an expensive flop.&lt;ref&gt;Sherson p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, the theatre was joined by overhead wires to the [[Canterbury Music Hall]] in [[Lambeth]], and public demonstrations of the [[C. F. Varley|Cromwell Varley]] telephone were given. Several simple tunes were transmitted and emitted softly from a large drum-like apparatus suspended over the proscenium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianlondon.org/publications5/londoners-44.htm ''London and Londoners in the Eighteen-Fifties and Sixties''], Alfred Rosling Bennett (1924) Chapter 44 ''The Drama'' (The Victorian Dictionary) accessed 1 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre was open for little more than a decade, closing in April 1878.  The interior was converted into a department store for the "Clerical Co-operative Society" and later occupied by the [[Odhams Press]]. The façade remained until redeveloped into a residential block in the 1970s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15811">A '''segregated prom''' refers to the practice of United States high schools, generally located in the [[Deep South]], of holding [[Racial segregation in the United States|racially segregated]] [[prom]]s for white and black students.  The practice spread after these schools were integrated, and persists in a few rural places to the present day.  The separate proms have been the subject of frequent (often negative) press coverage, and several films.

== History ==

Prior to the 1954 decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', most schools in the southern United States were racially segregated.&lt;ref name="1954-prom1"&gt;{{cite news | url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XggaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YiMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4784,3807511 | title= Deep South Adamant But Some Schools In Once-Segregated Area Begin Integrated Slate | author= William O.

In order to avoid having to hold an integrated prom, many high schools stopped sponsoring any prom, and private segregated proms were organized as a replacement.&lt;ref name="wp88-ark1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="edweek1"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2003/05/14/36prom.h22.html | title= In Some Southern Towns, Prom Night a Black-or-White Affair | author= Mark Walsh | newspaper=Education Week | date= May 14, 2003 | accessdate=March 17, 2010 }}("... the 1970s.

Even prior to integration in the South, there have been instances of segregated proms being held in integrated schools in the northern United States.  In the late 1920s, for example, separate proms for black and whites are recorded as occurring at [[Froebel High School]] in [[Gary, Indiana]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=68G5oQIJBBgC&amp;pg=PA63&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable cases ==
* [[Charleston, Mississippi]]:  In 1997, actor [[Morgan Freeman]] offered to fund a racially integrated prom in Charleston, Mississippi, where he lives.  The offer was turned down.  In 2007, he made the offer again and it was accepted, and the school held its first integrated prom in 2008, profiled in the documentary ''[[Prom Night in Mississippi]]''.&lt;ref name="freeman1"&gt;{{cite news | url= https://ottawacitizen.com/entertainment/Morgan+Freeman+goes+Prom/2296707/story.html | title= Morgan Freeman goes to the Prom | author= Katherine Monk | publisher=''Ottawa Citizen'' | date= December 3, 2009 | accessdate=March 17, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sólo de noche Vienes''''' is a Mexican film produced by Panamerican Films and Guatemalan producer [[Manuel Zeceña Diéguez]] and directed by [[Sergio Véjar]].&lt;ref name=barillas/&gt; It starred [[Elsa Aguirre]] and [[Julio Alemán]] along Cosmo Alessio, Rodolfo Landa, [[Herbert Meneses]] and [[Regina Torné]]. The plot is about a forbidden romance that takes place during [[Holy Week processions in Guatemala|Holy Week]] in a city in [[Central America]].&lt;ref name=barillas&gt;{{harvnb|Barillas|2013|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century ''Sólo de noche vienes'' is also an important film documentary of the [[Holy Week processions in Guatemala]] of the 1960s.&lt;ref name=cucurucho&gt;{{harvnb|Santos|18 June 2015|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==

[[File:LaMercedchurch1906.jpg|200px|thumb|La Merced Church in [[Guatemala City]] in the early 20th century.  The church was used to film the scenes when Andrés and Remedios met again but Remedios hides from Andrés to participate in the procession.]]
[[File:Calvariobiener.jpg|200px|thumb|El Calvario Church in Guatemala City.  The scene of the [[Good Friday]] procession was filmed at this location.]]
[[File:IGSS y Credito Hipotecario.jpg|200px|thumb|Guatemala City Civic Center in 2010.  The scene of Remedios and Andrés fleeing the city in his fancy sports car after the Good Friday procession was filmed at this location.]]

Andrés Villalta is a Mexican tourist visiting a city in [[Central America]] to enjoy the [[Holy Week processions in Guatemala|Holy Week processions]] and meets Remedios -a local socialite who is married to one of the most powerful men in the country-, with whom has an instant spark. Then, Carmen -Remedios sister-in-law- suddenly appears and Remedios hides from her without giving any explanations to Andrés. Afterwards, when Andrés takes her home in his fancy sports car, Remedios lies to him telling that her name is Carmen -his sister-in-law's name- and omitting to say that she is married.&lt;ref name=cucurucho/&gt;  confusion ensues, which makes Remedios even more mysterious to Andrés.&lt;ref name=panam&gt;{{harvnb|Panamerican Films|1965|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the climax, the whole family has gathered to watch Virgen Mary's silent procession, and then Andrés sees Remedios and when tries to reach for her, Remedios husband's cronies kill him on the spot.  Andrés dies in Remedios arms, still calling her "Carmen".&lt;ref name=panam/&gt;

The movie was directed by [[Sergio Véjar]], and is based on a screenplay written specifically for the movie by the Mexican writer [[Elena Garro]]; Garro producer Manuel Zeceña and Véjar all worked on the final version of the screenplay. The plot shows the impossible love between a Mexican tourist and a mysterious lady that appears and vanishes as if she were a spirit or coming from a different dimension;  Guatemala during [[Holy Week]] is the perfect frame for the mysterious romance. The elusive woman was actually married to a powerful character, who upon discovering her liaison orders the killing of her lover right there during a procession. The climatic scene shows both the infinity of the horizon, the rigidity of the religious and the volatility of love. Since the plot was originally written for the movie it was not included in the literary works of Garro.&lt;ref name=letraceluloide&gt;{{harvnb|Letra Celuloide|31 March 2013|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Filming ==

The film was filmed in [[Guatemala]] and [[El Salvador]] and at the time the most intriguing part of it all was the fact that producer Manuel Zeceña was able to get Alemán and Aguirre to work together after they had been strained for a while.&lt;ref name=lanacion1967/&gt; Interiors were filmed mainly in [[San Salvador]], in private homes in [[Santa Tecla, El Salvador|Santa Tecla]] and the exclusive neighborhoods of Escalón and San Benito.&lt;ref name=cucurucho/&gt;  The exteriors, on the other hand, were filmed in tourist attractions in "Puerta del Diablo" and "Planes de Renderos", also in El Salvador; however, since the plot is around a tourist that went to Central America to watch the Holy Week processions, several processions were filmed in [[Guatemala City]].  Therefore, the movie takes place in a fictitious city which is represented alternatively by [[San Salvador]] and [[Guatemala City]].&lt;ref name=perdomo/&gt;

== Soundtrack ==

Soundtrack was composed by French composer [[Charles Trenet]].&lt;ref name=letraceluloide/&gt;  The Salvadorian singers "Los Hermanos Cárcamo" (The Cárcamo Brothers) sang the title song ''Te deseo, amor'' (''I lust for you, love''). Roberto Cárcamo, lead singer, told to an interviewer on February 2002, that they had the opportunity to perform for the move after [[Julio Alemán]] heard them at Hotel El Salvador Intercontinental where he was staying during filming.&lt;ref name=perdomo&gt;{{harvnb|Perdomo León|11 March 2014|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

In [[Costa Rica]], the movie opened on May 1967 and due to the strong controversy the plot had for the times, it was shown in a censored version and only for mature audiences that were at least 21 years old.&lt;ref name=lanacion1967&gt;{{harvnb|La Nación|24 May 1967|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. --&gt;
In 2009, an elderly Cecil Gaines [[Frame story|recounts]] his life story while waiting at the [[White House]] to meet the newly inaugurated president.

In 1926, at the age of seven, Gaines is raised on a [[Plantation complexes in the Southeastern United States|cotton plantation]] in [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. When the farm's owner [[rape]]s Cecil's mother, Cecil's father confronts him and is killed. Cecil is taken in by the estate's caretaker, who trains Cecil as a house servant.

In 1937, at age eighteen, Cecil leaves the plantation. Desperately hungry, he breaks into a hotel pastry shop. The elderly master servant, Maynard, takes pity on Cecil and gives him a job. Cecil learns advanced serving and interpersonal skills from Maynard, who later recommends Cecil for a position in a [[Washington, D.C.]] hotel. While working there, Cecil meets and marries Gloria, and the couple has two sons: Louis and Charlie. In 1957, Cecil is hired by the [[White House]] during [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s administration. White House [[maître d'hôtel]] Freddie Fallows introduces Cecil to head butler Carter Wilson and co-worker James Holloway. Cecil witnesses Eisenhower's reluctance to use troops to enforce school desegregation, then his resolve to uphold the law by [[Little Rock Nine|racially integrating]] [[Little Rock Central High School]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Arkansas]].

Louis, the elder son, becomes a university student at [[Fisk University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], although Cecil feels that the [[Deep South|South]] is too volatile. Louis joins a student program led by [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) activist [[James Lawson (American activist)|James Lawson]], which leads to a [[Nonviolence|nonviolent]] [[sit-in]] at a [[Nashville sit-ins|segregated diner]], where he is arrested. Gloria, who feels that Cecil puts his job ahead of her, descends into [[alcoholism]].

In 1961, after [[John F. Kennedy]]'s inauguration, Louis and [[Freedom Riders|others]] are attacked by members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] while on a [[Freedom Riders|freedom ride]] to [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. Louis participates in the 1963 [[Birmingham Campaign|Birmingham Children's Crusade]], where dogs and water cannons are used to stop the marchers, one of the movement's actions which inspires Kennedy to deliver [[Civil Rights Address|a national address]] proposing the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. After Kennedy is [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]] his successor, [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], enacts the legislation. As a goodwill gesture, [[Jackie Kennedy]] gives Cecil one of the former president's [[necktie]]s.

Louis participates in the 1965 [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma Voting Rights Movement]], which inspires Johnson to demand that Congress enact the landmark [[1965 Voting Rights Act|Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. Johnson also gives Cecil a [[tie bar]].

In the late 1960s, after civil rights activist [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]'s [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|assassination]], Louis tells his family that he has joined the [[Black Panthers]]. Cecil orders Louis and his girlfriend to leave his house. Louis is arrested again. Cecil becomes aware of President [[Richard Nixon]]'s plans to suppress the Black Panthers.

Charlie confides to Louis that he plans to join the [[Vietnam War|war in Vietnam]]. After enlisting, Charlie is killed and buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. When the Black Panthers resort to violence, Louis leaves the organization and returns to college, earning his [[master's degree]] in [[political science]] and eventually running for a seat in [[United States Congress|Congress]], although Cecil continues to hold resentment against him.

Cecil repeatedly confronts his supervisor at the White House over the unequal pay and career advancement provided to the black White House staff. With President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s support, Cecil prevails, his reputation growing to the point that he and his wife are invited by the Reagans to be guests at a state dinner. Cecil becomes uncomfortable with the class divisions in the White House. After witnessing Reagan's refusal to support [[Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act|economic sanctions]] against Apartheid [[South Africa]], Cecil resigns.

Gloria encourages Cecil to mend his relationship with Louis. Realizing his son's actions are heroic, Cecil joins Louis at a protest against [[Apartheid in South Africa|South African apartheid]]; they are arrested and jailed together.

In 2008, Gloria dies shortly before [[Barack Obama]] [[United States presidential election, 2008|is elected]] as the nation's first African-American president. Two months, two weeks and one day later, Cecil prepares to meet the newly [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inaugurated]] President, wearing the articles he received from Kennedy and Johnson. [[Stephen W. Rochon]] approaches Cecil and tells him the president is ready, preparing to show him the way to the Oval Office. Cecil tells him that he knows the way.

==Production==

===Development===
[[Danny Strong]]'s screenplay is inspired by Wil Haygood's ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' article "A Butler Well Served by This Election".&lt;ref name="wapost"&gt;{{cite news |last=Haygood |first=Wil |title=A Butler Well Served by This Election|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/06/AR2008110603948_pf.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=November 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The Reliable Source | date= August 6, 2013 | title= No, President Obama isn't doing a cameo in 'The Butler' | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/wp/2013/08/06/no-president-obama-isnt-doing-a-cameo-in-the-butler/ |department=Reliable Source (blog) | work=[[The Washington Post]] | accessdate=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project received initial backing in early 2011, when producers Laura Ziskin and Pam Williams approached [[Sheila Johnson]] for help in financing the film. After reading Danny Strong's screenplay, Johnson pitched in her own $2.7 million before bringing in several African-American investors. However, Ziskin died from cancer in June 2011. This left director Daniels and producing partner Hilary Shor to look for further producers on their own. They started with [[Cassian Elwes]], with whom they were working on [[The Paperboy (2012 film)|''The Paperboy'']]. Elwes joined the list of producers, and started raising funding for the film. In spring 2012, Icon U.K., a British financing and production company, added a $6 million guarantee against foreign pre-sales. Finally the film raised its needed $30 million budget through 41 producers and executive producers, including Earl W. Stafford, Harry I. Martin Jr., Brett Johnson, [[Michael Finley]], and Buddy Patrick. Thereafter, as film production started [[Weinstein Co.]] picked up U.S. distribution rights for the film. David Glasser, Weinstein Co. COO, called fund raising as an independent film, "a story that's a movie within itself."&lt;ref name=holly13&gt;{{cite web| title = Why 'Lee Daniels' The Butler' Has 41 Producers| url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/why-lee-daniels-butler-has-605011|date=August 14, 2013| accessdate = August 15, 2013|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Lee Daniels' The Butler: The film with FORTY ONE producers: How a host of stars and entrepreneurs raised $30m to fund The Butler |work=[[Daily Mail]] | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2394397/Lee-Daniels-The-Butler--The-film-FORTY-ONE-producers-How-host-stars-entrepreneurs-raised-30m-fund-The-Butler.html |date=August 15, 2013| accessdate = August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Weinstein Company]] acquired the distribution rights for the film after [[Columbia Pictures]] put the film in [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brevet |first=Brad |title=New Look at 'The Butler' as the Weinstein Co.

The site's consensus says, "Gut-wrenching and emotionally affecting, ''Lee Daniels' The Butler'' overcomes an uneven narrative thanks to strong performances from an all-star cast."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lee_daniels_the_butler/ |title=''Lee Daniels' The Butler'' (2013) |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date=August 16, 2013 |accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another review aggregator, [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Normalization (statistics)|normalized]] rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 66 based on 47 reviews, indicating "generally positive reviews".&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lee Daniels' The Butler|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/lee-daniels-the-butler|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Todd McCarthy]] praised the film saying, "Even with all contrivances and obvious point-making and familiar historical signposting, Daniels' ''The Butler'' is always engaging, often entertaining and certainly never dull."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|title=Lee Daniels' The Butler: Film Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/butler/review/601991|accessdate=August 16, 2013|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=August 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Roeper]] lauded the film's casting in particular, remarking that "Forest Whitaker gives the performance of his career".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roeper|first=Richard|title=Lee Daniels' The Butler|url=http://www.richardroeper.com/reviews/leedanielsthebutler.aspx|accessdate=August 16, 2013|newspaper=Richard Roeper &amp; The Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|''Rolling Stone'']] also spoke highly of Whitaker writing that his "reflective, powerfully understated performance...fills this flawed film with potency and purpose."&lt;ref name=RS&gt;{{cite news|last=Travers|first=Peter|title=Lee Daniels' The Butler|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/lee-daniels-the-butler-20130815|accessdate=August 16, 2013|newspaper=Rolling Stone|date=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] wrote that "Daniels develops a strong sense of the inner complexities and contradictions of the civil-rights landscape."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Foundas|first=Scott|title=Film Review: 'Lee Daniels' The Butler'|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/lee-daniels-the-butler-review-forest-whitaker-oprah-winfrey-1200575215/|accessdate=August 16, 2013|newspaper=Variety|date=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[USA Today]]'' gave the film three out of four stars and noted that "It's inspiring and filled with fine performances, but the insistently swelling musical score and melodramatic moments seem calculated and undercut a powerful story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Puig|first=Claudia|title='The Butler' is mannered and moving|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/08/15/the-butler-review/2581949/|accessdate=August 16, 2013|newspaper=USA Today|date=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miles Davis of the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' gave the film a negative review, claiming the film to be "[[Oscar bait]]", a cliche film designed to attract Oscar nominations.&lt;ref&gt;"The Butler Review", New York Tribune, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' was more negative; "An ambitious and overdue attempt to create a Hollywood-style epic around the experience of black Americans in general and the civil rights movement in particular, it undercuts itself by hitting its points squarely on the nose with a 9-pound hammer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Turan|first=Kenneth|title=Review: 'Lee Daniels' The Butler' significant but often contrived|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-review-the-butler,0,581076.story|accessdate=August 16, 2013|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several critics compared the film's historical anecdotes and sentimentality to [[Forrest Gump (film)|''Forrest Gump'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=John|title='Lee Daniels' The Butler' movie review|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/lee-daniels-the-butler-movie-review/2013/08/14/a8976a42-0443-11e3-9259-e2aafe5a5f84_story.html|accessdate=August 16, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rodriguez|first=Rene|title='Lee Daniels' The Butler' (PG-13)|url=http://www.miami.com/039lee-daniels039-butler039-pg-13-article|accessdate=August 16, 2013|newspaper=Miami Herald|date=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Joe|title=Forest Whitaker shines as 'The Butler'|url=http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/movies/reviews/forest-whitaker-shines-as-the-butler/article_9622adf4-b80a-584c-b0ec-6dcb97a840b2.html|accessdate=August 16, 2013|newspaper=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Burr|first=Ty|title='The Butler' examines civil rights history from a new perspective|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/2013/08/15/movie-review-lee-daniels-the-butler-examines-civil-rights-history-from-whole-new-perspective/XRwirtvqC0IWlFk0o1Mj0M/story.html|accessdate=August 16, 2013|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical accuracy===
Regarding historical accuracy, Eliana Dockterman wrote in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'': "Allen was born on a [[Virginia]] plantation in 1919, not in Georgia.... In the movie, Cecil Gaines grows up on a cotton field in Macon, where his family comes into conflict with the white farmers for whom they work. What befalls his parents on the cotton field was [[Stereotypes of African Americans|added for dramatic effect]].... Though tension between father and son over civil rights issues fuels most of the drama in the film, [Eugene Allen's son] Charles Allen was not the radical political activist that Gaines's son is in the movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dockterman |first=Eliana |title=The True Story of The Butler: Fact vs. Fiction in Lee Daniels' The Butler |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2013/08/16/what-the-butler-really-saw/ |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particular criticism has been directed at the film's accuracy in portraying President [[Ronald Reagan]]. While Alan Rickman's performance generated positive reviews, the director and screenwriters of the film have been criticized for depicting Reagan as indifferent to civil rights and his reluctance to associate with the White House's black employees during his presidency. According to [[Michael Reagan]], the former president's son, "The real story of the White House butler doesn't imply racism at all. It's simply Hollywood liberals wanting to believe something about my father that was never there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bond|first=Paul|title=President Reagan's Son Attacks 'Lee Daniels' The Butler'|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/president-reagans-son-attacks-lee-614568 |accessdate=August 28, 2013|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=August 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/29/the-butler-ronald-reagan-not-racist|publisher=The Guardian|title=The Butler falsely portrays Ronald Reagan as racist, says son|date=August 29, 2013|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Newsmax|title=The Butler from Another Planet|url=http://www.newsmax.com/Reagan/Butler-Reagan-Oprah-Allen/2013/08/22/id/521814|date=August 27, 2013|first=Michael|last=Reagan|accessdate=December 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Kengor]], one of President Reagan's biographers, also attacked the film, saying, "I've talked to many White House staff, cooks, housekeepers, doctors, and Secret Service over the years. They are universal in their love of Ronald Reagan." In regard to the president's initial opposition to sanctions against [[apartheid]] in South Africa, Kengor said, "Ronald Reagan was appalled by apartheid, but also wanted to ensure that if the apartheid regime collapsed in South Africa that it wasn't replaced by a Marxist-totalitarian regime allied with Moscow and Cuba that would take the South African people down the same road as Ethiopia, Mozambique, and, yes, Cuba. In the immediate years before Reagan became president, 11 countries from the Third World, from Asia to Africa to Latin America, went Communist. It was devastating. If the film refuses to deal with this issue with the necessary balance, it shouldn't deal with it at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lee-daniels-butler-reagan-biographers-608233|title=Lee Daniels' 'The Butler': Reagan Biographers Slam President's Portrayal|work=The Hollywood Reporter.com|date=August 16, 2013|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''''The No Asshole Rule: Building a Civilized Workplace and Surviving One That Isn't''''' is a book by [[Stanford University|Stanford]] professor [[Robert I. Sutton]], based on a popular essay he wrote for the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]''. It sold over 115,000 copies and won the [[Quill Awards|Quill Award]] for best business book in 2007.&lt;ref name="Brady" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BS" /&gt;

The theme of this book is that [[workplace bullying|bullying]] behaviour in the workplace worsens [[morale]] and [[productivity]].  A rule is suggested to screen out the toxic staff—the ''no asshole rule''.  The author insists upon use of the word [[asshole]] since other words such as [[bullying|bully]] or [[wiktionary:jerk|jerk]] "do not convey the same degree of awfulness".&lt;ref name="TA" /&gt; In terms of using the word in the book's title, he said "There's an emotional reaction to a dirty title.  You have a choice between being offensive and being ignored."&lt;ref name="HG" /&gt;

==Recognition==
Two tests are specified for recognition of the asshole:&lt;ref name="Sutton" /&gt;

# After encountering the person, do people feel oppressed, humiliated or otherwise worse about themselves?
# Does the person target people who are less powerful than him/her?

Their unpleasant behaviours were catalogued by Sutton as ''The Dirty Dozen'':&lt;ref name="Cipriano " /&gt;

# [[Insult]]s
# [[personal space|Violation of personal space]]
# [[haptic communication|Unsolicited touching]]
# [[Threat]]s
# [[Sarcasm]]
# [[Flaming (Internet)|Flames]]
# [[Humiliation]]
# [[Shaming]]
# [[Interruption science|Interruption]]
# [[Backbiting]]
# [[Glaring]]
# [[Snub]]bing

Sutton believes there is a difference between ‘temporary’ assholes who might be having a bad moment or day and certified ‘assholes’ who are “persistently nasty.” He gives the example of when he sent a scornful email to a colleague because he wrongly believed she was trying to take an office away from his group. In this instance, he was acting like a temporary asshole and to be a certified asshole he would have to act like a jerk persistently. Famous bosses who are cited as having weakened their position by bad behaviour include [[Al Dunlap]] and [[Michael Eisner]]. Another example of a certified asshole is the Hollywood boss [[Scott Rudin]]. Rudin has fired 250 personal assistants for reasons such as bringing him the wrong muffin. Rudin also qualifies as an asshole as his targets are less powerful than him and are left feeling humiliated.&lt;ref name="Sutton" /&gt;

Sutton makes the caveat that while it is essential to screen for assholes, a company should not recruit “spineless wimps.” He believes constructive arguments benefit firms and help workers come up with better ideas. Sutton cites the Intel co-founder [[Andrew Grove|Andy Grove]] as someone who believes workers should challenge each other's thoughts. Intel teaches employees “how to fight” and requires new employees to take classes in ‘constructive confrontation.’&lt;ref name="Sutton" /&gt;

==Cost and damage==

The necessity of the No Asshole Rule and the damage assholes do is discussed by Sutton. He relays Bennett Tepper’s research on 712 employees. Many of these workers had bosses who would oppress and belittle them, and Tepper studied the effect these bosses had on them. After six months he found workers with abusive bosses “quit their jobs at accelerated rates, and those still trapped in their jobs suffered from less work and life satisfaction, reduced commitment to employers, and heightened depression, anxiety, and burnout.” Sutton relays even minor things such as treating someone as invisible and giving nasty stares can accumulate and adversely affect someone’s mental health. Sutton describes how assholes not only effect victims themselves but also the bystanders and witnesses that see and hear about the abuse. Co-workers, family members, and friends are among those who are negatively affected. One British study of more than seven hundred employees in the public sector found “73 percent of the witnesses to bullying incidents experienced increased stress and 44 percent worried about becoming targets themselves”. This shows assholes can harm and lessen the productivity of not only their victims but everyone in the workplace. Sutton states the assholes themselves also suffer from their actions in the form of “career setbacks and, at times, humiliation.” Even when these jerks do their jobs well they can still be fired. He cites the example of the Indiana Hoosiers coach [[Bob Knight]] who despite all his achievements was fired from repeatedly losing his temper.&lt;ref name="Sutton" /&gt;

Sutton discusses the total cost of assholes or the ‘TCA’ for organizations. While it is impossible to calculate the exact TCA for an organization, Sutton believes it is instructive for companies to estimate how much assholes are costing them. Factors to consider include the number of hours managers and HR professionals devote to ‘asshole management’ and the costs of lost clients. Future legal costs resulting from lawsuits against assholes and the cost of recruiting and training new employees should also be considered. Researchers Charlotte Rayner and Loraleigh Keashly have used data based on studies in the UK to calculate a company’s TCA. They estimate that “25 percent of bullying 'targets' and 20 percent of 'witnesses' leave their jobs, and that the 'average' bullying rate in the U.K. is 15 percent”. This means if 25% of victims leave a company of 1,000 people the replacement cost is $20,000 and the annual replacement cost is $750,000. If 20% of victims leave and there is an average of two witnesses for each victim, the replacement cost is $1.2 million, and the total replacement cost is just shy of $2 million. A senior executive from Silicon Valley has previously calculated the cost of an employee Sutton calls Ethan. The expenses relating to Ethan’s poor treatment of others totaled around $160,000, and his company deducted some of this money from his bonus.&lt;ref name="Sutton" /&gt; 

==Case studies==

Companies who are listed as having appropriate recruitment policies include: [[Barclays Capital]], [[Google]], [[JetBlue]], [[Men's Wearhouse]], and [[IDEO]].&lt;ref name="Sutton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HG" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Booklist" /&gt; IDEO offers jobs to candidates who have interned with the company before and have “demonstrated under real working conditions that they aren’t assholes.” They advise candidates they have not previously worked with to have strong recommendations and to have taught in university classrooms. Every candidate at IDEO is also interviewed “by people who will be above, below, and alongside them, status-wise.” This method ensures if one high up manager is an asshole he will not be able to hire more jerks.&lt;ref name="Sutton" /&gt; 

Sutton also stresses companies should mean what they say. While many companies have written versions of the no asshole rule, few entirely abide by them. A group of Sutton’s students did a case study on a security company who said they value “respect for the individual, teamwork, and integrity.” The study revealed in actuality the company was disrespectful to young analysts and treated them with mistrust. These analysts were top students from prestigious universities and were working at the company for a few years until they returned to school get their MBAs. As a result of treating these employees poorly, the company had a low rate of return and had a hard time recruiting employees back when they finished school.&lt;ref name="Sutton" /&gt; 

Sutton discusses how to enforce the no asshole rule and gives the Men's Wearhouse and a [[Fortune 500]] company as examples of businesses who have done this successfully.&lt;ref name="Sutton" /&gt; The Men’s Warehouse fired a selfish and difficult employee even though he was one of the company’s most successful salespeople, and as a result, the total sale volume in the store increased. A CEO at a fortune 500 company evaluated employees and fired people on his ‘hit list’ over a period of two years. The firm benefited from firing these assholes as they have risen from the “middle of the pack” to one of the top firms in the industry.&lt;ref name="Sutton" /&gt; A special chapter is also dedicated to "the virtues of assholes", in which [[Steve Jobs]] is discussed as a prime example.&lt;ref name="McNichol " /&gt;&lt;ref name="Austen" /&gt;

Sutton advises companies to adopt the “one asshole rule.” Sutton believes by having a couple of token jerks in a company, coworkers will observe their bad behavior and be more likely to do the right thing. He based his hypothesis on a series of studies on littering done by [[Robert Cialdini]]. In one trial of the study researchers spewed garbage and litter around a parker lot, and in a separate trial, they made sure the lot was spotless. They placed a flyer on a driver’s windshield and observed what the driver did with that flyer. As part of the experiment half of the drivers encountered a researcher who picked up the flyer on their car and threw it on the ground. Watching this one driver litter affected the subject as “drivers who saw the 'norm violation' were less likely to throw their handbill into a clean parking lot (6 percent vs. 14 percent) but more likely to throw it into a messy lot (54 percent vs. 32 percent)”. This study shows when one person is caught breaking a rule others are more likely to follow it whereas if everyone seems to be breaking the rule we are more likely to break it as well. Sutton has applied this theory to companies and believes they should each have a “reverse role model” to remind others of the wrong behavior&lt;ref name="Sutton" /&gt;.  

==Frequency==

The book argues that asshole behavior is rather common by citing various studies: 

{{quote|[A] survey of 800 employees found that 10% witnessed daily incivility on their jobs and 20% were direct targets of incivility at least once a week.... [A]nother study of workplace incivility among 216 Canadian white-collar workers ... found that approximately 25% witnessed incivility of some kind on the job every day and 50% reported being direct targets of incivility at least once a week. A host of other studies show that psychological abuse and bullying are common in other countries, including Austria, Australia, Canada, Germany, Finland, France, Ireland, and South Africa. A representative sample of Australian employees found that 35% reported being verbally abused by at least one coworker and 31% reported being verbally abused by at least one superior.... In the Third European Survey on Working Conditions, which was based on 21,500 face-to-face interviews with employees from countries of the European Union, 9% reported that they were exposed to persistent intimidation and bullying.&lt;ref name="studies" /&gt;}} 

The book also affirms that employees perceive "upward" nastiness – i.e. directed toward bosses – as the rarest form and occurring in only 1% of the cases, while perceived "downward" nastiness is estimated to account for 50%–80% of occurrences, with 20%–50% occurring among coworkers of roughly the same rank.&lt;ref name="studies" /&gt;

==Sequels==

In 2010, Sutton published a sequel, ''Good Boss, Bad Boss: How to Be the Best... and Learn from the Worst'', which provided guidance on being a good boss.&lt;ref name="GBBB" /&gt; A follow-up book was released in 2017 called ''The Asshole Survival Guide: How to Deal with People Who Treat You Like Dirt''.&lt;ref name="TASG" /&gt;

A '''verbal autopsy''' (VA) is a method of gathering health information about a deceased individual to determine his or her [[cause of death]]. Health information and a description of events prior to death are acquired from conversations or interviews with a person or persons familiar with the deceased and analyzed by health professional or computer algorithms to assign a probable cause of death.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

Verbal autopsy is used in settings where most deaths are undocumented. Estimates suggest a majority of the 60 million annual global deaths occur without medical attention or official medical certification of the cause of death. The VA method attempts to establish causes of death for previously undocumented subjects, allowing scientists to analyze disease patterns and direct [[public health]] policy decisions.

Noteworthy uses of the verbal autopsy method include the [[Million Death Study]] in India, China's national program to document causes of death in rural areas, and the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref name=r4/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lozano|first1=Rafael|last2=Murray|first2=Christopher J.L.|last3=Naghavi|first3=Mohsen|title=Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010|url=http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/global-and-regional-mortality-235-causes-death-20-age-groups-1990-and-2010|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The term ''verbal autopsy'' was first coined in a project of the Department of International Health of Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health which ran from 1965 to 1973 in Punjab, India. Two research projects were located in villages near Ludhiana, with headquarters in Narangwal village. Objectives of the projects were
# to assess the relationships between nutrition, infection and child development,&lt;ref&gt;Arnfried A. Kielmann, Carl E. Taylor, Cecile de Sweemer, Robert L. Parker, Dov Chernikovsky, William A. Reinke, Inder S. Uberoi, D.N. Kakar, Norah Masih, R.S.S. Sarma. Child and Maternal Health Services in Rural India, The Narangwal Experiment, Volume 1, Integrated Nutrition and Health Care, 1983, The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore and London 1983; {{ISBN|0-8018-3064-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and
# the acceptance of family planning services by rural communities in response to maternal and early child care service packages.&lt;ref&gt;Carl E. Taylor, R.S.S. Sarma, Robert L. Parker, William A. Reinke, and Rashid Faruqee, Child and Maternal Health Services in Rural India, The Narangwal Experiment, Volume 2, ''Integrated Family Planning and Health Care'', 1983, The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore and London 1983; {{ISBN|0-8018-3065-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Main providers of health care were Lady Health Visitors (LHVs) and [[Auxiliary nurse midwife|Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs)]] resident in each of the study villages in the nutrition- and population studies, respectively. All had received a six-week training prior to onset of the program, followed by monthly reviews, re-training and feed-back on service aspects specific to their group of villages. Input services in the Nutrition villages originally consisted of “feeding centres” and health care for under-5s, and on maternal and newborn health care services in the population cells. Early in 1971, results from the nutrition villages showed no significant decrease in child mortality, and causes and circumstances of child deaths had remained largely unknown. In response, an information system was established, wherein all child deaths in the villages had to be reported to the Narangwal Project Office by the resident health worker within five days. One of the project physicians then went to the concerned family and through intense questioning of close relatives as to the signs and symptoms of the process leading to death, review of the child’s health records, supplemented by visits to the external health care provider if such was the case, established possible reasons for, and a most likely cause of death. Using this method and following an analysis of the initial 45 deaths, diarrheal disease, lower respiratory tract infections and malnutrition were identified as the three principal causes among the 8 days to 3 year old children. Among the 45, one had died from neonatal tetanus. Shortly thereafter, the same process was extended to all villages of the two projects featuring childcare as one of the service inputs. In response to the results, intervention methodologies specific to identified health care priorities were elaborated and introduced in both projects. In 1972, results from the investigation were presented for 124 child deaths during the first seven days of life, and 117 deaths from 8 days to 5 years of age at a conference in Srinagar, Kashmir. The term Verbal Autopsy was used ‘in irony’ by a visiting medical dignitary who not only questioned the results but also the method, labelling it ”''unscientific''”. The term was retained by the then director of the two projects, Carl E. Taylor, chairman of the Department of International Health who also chaired the conference. Through introduction of specific service packages specifically for the control of DD,&lt;ref&gt;A.A. Kielmann and C. McCord: "Home Treatment of Childhood Diarrhoea in Punjab Villages", J. of Trop. Ped. and Environ. Hlth. 23,  197, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; ARI,&lt;ref&gt;C. McCord and A.A. Kielmann:  "A successful Program for Paraprofessionals treating Childhood Diarrhoea and Pneumonia", Tropical Doctor, 8, 220, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; and Neonatal Tetanus,&lt;ref&gt;A.A. Kielmann and Sanyukta Vohra:  "Control of Tetanus  Neonatorum in Rural Communities:  Immunization Effects after a single  Injection  of  High-Dose Calcium-Phosphate  Adsorbed  Tetanus  Toxoid", Indian J. Med. Research, 66, 906, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; child mortality dropped significantly in the study villages of both the Nutrition and Population projects.

Seven years later (1980), the Ministry of Health of Egypt conducted an investigation for prevention of child mortality from DD using a variety of intervention methods for a total population of 200,000, including 29000 children below the age of 5 in three different districts.&lt;ref&gt;A.A. Kielmann, A.B. Mobarak, M.T. Hammamy, A.I. Gomaa, S. Abou-el-Saad, R.K. Lotfi, I. Mazen, A. Nagaty. "Control of deaths from diarrheal disease in rural communities. I) Design of an intervention study and effects on child mortality". ''Trop. Med. Parasit’'', 36 (1985) 191–198; Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''verbal autopsy'' method as originally developed in Narangwal was slightly modified to the Egyptian setting and again used to identify prevailing mortality patterns among preschoolers. Following implementation of different treatment schedules, child mortality rates dropped significantly in specific input villages over the period of study. The project site was re-visited six years following completion of the investigation confirming utility and effectiveness of the V.A. method, and applied intervention modalities respectively.&lt;ref&gt;A. Gomaa, M. Mwafi, A. Nagaty, Mervat El Rafic,  Shafika  Nasser, A.A.  Kielmann, N. Hirschorn: "Impact of the national  control  of diarrhoeal  diseases project on infant and child mortality in  Dakahlia, Egypt". ''Lancet'', July 16, 1988: 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as the 1950s forms of VA called lay reporting were employed in countries with low coverage of medical access.&lt;ref name=r2/&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) continued to encourage lay reporting in such settings and in 1975 an official lay reporting form was established.&lt;ref name=r2/&gt;

Many iterations of the questionnaire used in VA have been developed by health professionals and researchers. The WHO now employs a standard verbal autopsy method, involving a recommended questionnaire.&lt;ref name=r3/&gt;

Analysis of the interviews can be done by computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=Christopher J.L.|last2=Lozano|first2=Rafael|last3=Lopez|first3=Alan|title=Verbal autopsy: innovations, applications, opportunities|journal=Population Health Metrics|date=August 2011|volume=9|url=http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/verbal-autopsy-innovations-applications-opportunities|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Who Shot Rock &amp; Roll: A Photographic History, 1955 to the Present''' was the first major museum exhibition of [[Rock music]] photography. The exhibit was organized by guest curator [[Gail Buckland]] at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/rock_and_roll/ | title = Brooklyn Museum:Exhibitions: Who Shot Rock &amp; Roll: A Photographic History, 1955 to the Present | accessdate = 2011-06-21 | year = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition toured from 2009-2013, visiting the Brooklyn Museum ([[Brooklyn]], New York), [[Worcester Art Museum]] (Worcester, Massachusetts), [[Memphis Brooks Museum of Art]] (Memphis, Tennessee), [[Akron Art Museum]] (Akron, Ohio), [[Columbia Museum of Art]] (Columbia, South Carolina), [[Birmingham Museum of Art]] (Birmingham, Alabama), [[Tucson Museum of Art]] (Tucson, Arizona), [[Allentown Art Museum]] (Allentown, Pennsylvania), [[Annenberg Space for Photography]] (Los Angeles, California)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/rock_and_roll/touring.php | title = Who Shot Rock and Roll: Tour Schedule with Dates | accessdate = 2011-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tamaki|Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki]] (Auckland, New Zealand).
==Exhibit==
The exhibit was a collaboration between Gail Buckland and the Brooklyn Museum, which began after the museum learned that Buckland was writing a book focusing on the photographers behind iconic rock-and-roll photographs. Buckland states in the preface to her book (also named, ''Who Shot Rock &amp; Roll: A Photographic History, 1955-Present''), "The Brooklyn Museum...invited me to work with them to develop and curate the most exciting museum show of rock-and-roll photography ever produced. The book serves as the catalogue to this landmark exhibition."&lt;ref name="Book"&gt;{{cite book |title=Who Shot Rock and Roll: A Photographic History, 1955-Present |last=Buckland |first=Gail|year=2009 |publisher=[[Alfred A.

The exhibition is in six sections: behind the scenes; career beginnings; live performances; crowds and fans; portraits; images and album covers.&lt;ref name="BMA"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rockbma.com/ | title = Who Shot Rock and Roll | accessdate = 2011-06-20 | last = Birmingham Museum of Art | year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibit covers over 50 years of rock-and-roll history and encompasses 175 works from more than 100 photographers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.columbiamuseum.org/exhibitions/whoshotrock/index.php | title = Who Shot Rock and Roll at the Columbia Museum of Art | accessdate = 2011-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“I’m not that interested in celebrity,” Buckland said, “Substance and creativity is what interests me. If rock and roll is anything, it’s supposed to be real. That what holds it together, it’s an expression of something deep and honest within us. I chose photos that tell the story with a degree of honesty.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Janaya |title=Rock Photos Take Center Stage At Brooklyn Museum |url=http://blogs.wnyc.org/culture/2009/10/30/rock-photos-take-center-stage-at-brooklyn-museum/ |work=blog |publisher=[[WNYC]] |date=Oct 30, 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Wild Boy''''' is a 2003 novel by English author [[Jill Dawson]], published by [[Sceptre (imprint)|Sceptre]]. Set in Paris at the beginning of the nineteenth century, it is a fictional retelling of the story of Victor, the [[Wild Boy of Aveyron]].

==Plot introduction==
The novel is split into sections headed by dates in the [[French Republican Calendar]] which was in use at the time, and is in the main told by two narrative voices, [[Jean Marc Gaspard Itard]], the doctor appointed to be the boy's tutor, and Madame Guerin to whom Itard entrusts his care. The story begins with Victor's arrival at the Deaf-Mute institute in Paris and Dr. Itard's enthusiasm that here was an opportunity to prove his theory that whatever a person's background, they could be brought into civilised society. Unfortunately, the task proves far more difficult than he anticipated...

==Inspiration==
Inspiration for the novel came from [[Uta Frith]]'s 1989 book ''[[Autism: Explaining the Enigma (book)| Explaining the Enigma]]'' in which the Wild Boy of Aveynon is claimed to be the first documented autistic child.&lt;ref name=observer&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/sep/21/fiction.features Give me the child...Jill Dawson explores the nature of autism against a backdrop of post-revolutionary France in ''Wild Boy''], ''The Observer'', Sunday 21 September 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Further insights came from Dawson's personal experience with her own son who was diagnosed with [[Asperger's Syndrome]].&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/sep/27/featuresreviews.guardianreview20 Natural causes, Jill Dawson's insights illuminate the feral child of Aveyron's story in her moving retelling of his re-education], ''The Guardian'', Saturday 27 September 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
*Michael Newton in ''[[The Guardian]]'' is full of praise: "Jill Dawson's excellent new novel, ''Wild Boy'', dramatises the process of that education. Its story may be familiar to some readers through [[François Truffaut]]'s marvellous film, ''[[L'Enfant sauvage]]'', but Dawson takes what is already a compelling tale and successfully fleshes it out into a convincing and highly moving book." he continues later "In the process of working out her story, Dawson deftly takes on some fascinating themes: the relationship between men and the maternal; guilt and responsibility; the possibility of our being granted a second chance in life. She revivifies a piece of history with emotional intelligence, fleshing out the few documented facts with an admirably perceptive grasp of human nature."&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;
*Laura Baggalay writing in ''[[The Observer]]'' is also very positive, "Dawson deftly links the insularity of autism to the bloody panorama of the French Revolution still fresh in their memories: 'We had many times in our recent history seen men behave exactly as if they had no ability to imagine the needs or sensibility of another human being.'" and concludes "''Wild Boy'' is an accomplished novel, rich with ideas and vivid characters, which is, above all, a lucid and moving exploration of the nature of autism.'&lt;ref name=observer/&gt;
*Charlotte Moore in ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' praises Dawson's depiction of autism, "Dawson is alive to the subtleties of Victor's predicament. She uses his "otherness" to expose closely guarded secrets. Itard is agitated by similarities between Victor's instincts and his own. The reader can spot a putative case of Asperger's syndrome in Itard's inability to form emotional attachments and in his pedantic pursuit of detail at the expense of the bigger picture. Madame Guerin's guilt and grief for her own son's death surface through intimate contact with Victor. Man, suggests Dawson, refuting Itard, cannot be made into something he wasn't meant to be. You can remove the wild boy from the forest, but inside he'll always be in there, always running."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3603046/Child-of-the-forest.html Child of the forest, Charlotte Moore reviews ''Wild Boy'' by Jill Dawson], ''The Telegraph'', 21 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Michael "Hoot"&lt;ref name=GuardianObit&gt;Austin Mutti-Mewse, [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/nov/15/guardianobituaries.film Obituary: William Hootkins], ''The Guardian'', November 14, 2005, accessed December 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Hootkins''' (July 5, 1948 – October 23, 2005) was an American character actor, best known for supporting roles in Hollywood blockbusters such as ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', and ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]''.

==Early life==
Hootkins was born in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]]. He attended [[St. Mark's School of Texas]] from grade 1 through 12. At age 15, Hootkins found himself caught up in the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]'s investigation into the assassination of President [[John F. Kennedy]] when he was interviewed about [[Ruth Paine]], his Russian teacher.  [[Marina Oswald Porter|Marina Oswald]], the [[Russians (ethnic group)|Russian]] wife of the assassin [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], and their children had been living with Paine in Dallas.  In school he also developed his taste for theatre, joining the same drama group as [[Tommy Lee Jones]], who was a year ahead of him in high school. Hootkins would later say that, since Jones was better-looking and got all the best parts, "I supported from then on in."&lt;ref name=GuardianObit/&gt;

Hootkins attended [[Princeton University]], studying astrophysics before transferring to oriental studies, where he became fluent in [[Mandarin Chinese]]. This stood him in good stead when he played the part of an interpreter in an episode of ''[[The West Wing]]'' titled "Impact Winter".&lt;ref name=GuardianObit/&gt; He was a mainstay of the [[Theatre Intime]], making a particular impact with his performance in [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[Moby Dick—Rehearsed]]''. On the recommendation of his friend [[John Lithgow]], he moved to London in the early 1970s and trained as an actor at the [[London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art]] (LAMDA). He made his home in London until 2002, when he moved to Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=GuardianObit/&gt;

==Acting career==

===Stage===
In England, Hootkins found work in the theatre as well as in film, and he would have his greatest success on stage portraying [[Alfred Hitchcock]] in [[Terry Johnson (dramatist)|Terry Johnson]]'s 2003 hit play ''Hitchcock Blonde'', first at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] and in London's West End. The role was such a success that producers planned to take the show to Broadway, but it was canceled after he was diagnosed with cancer.&lt;ref name=GuardianObit/&gt;

===Film and television===
Hootkins appeared in many roles that made him a welcome figure at fan conventions, particularly for ''Star Wars'' in his role of Jek Tono Porkins. He also appeared in significant parts in films as ''[[Hardware (film)|Hardware]]'' (1990), ''[[Like Father, Like Santa]]'' (as [[Santa Claus]]), and ''[[Hear My Song]]'' (1991), where he was the Mr. X who was presumed to be the Irish tenor [[Josef Locke]] under a false name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CE2D71E39F93AA25752C0A964958260|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Hear My Song (1991) Review/Film; Irish Tenor Is Focus of Intrigue and Blarney|author=Janet Maslin|date=January 19, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; He portrayed [[Fatty Arbuckle]] in [[Ken Russell]]'s infamous 1977 flop ''[[Valentino (1977 film)|Valentino]]'', and played [[Hans Zarkov]]'s assistant in the 1980 ''[[Flash Gordon (film)|Flash Gordon]]''. He also made appearances in such films as ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' and [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (the latter as Lt. Eckhardt).&lt;ref name=GuardianObit/&gt;

He also appeared in several roles on television, including [[Charles Frohman]] in ''[[The Lost Boys (docudrama)|The Lost Boys]]'' (1978), Colonel Cobb in the remake of ''[[The Tomorrow People#Series two|The Tomorrow People]]'' and as Uncle George in the 2002 remake of ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)#Adaptations|The Magnificent Ambersons]]''.

At the time of his death, Hootkins was planning a screenplay on [[Fatty Arbuckle]], focusing on the comic's life after his fall from grace in 1921; he had met Arbuckle's last wife, [[Addie McPhail]].&lt;ref name=GuardianObit/&gt;

===Voice acting===
He was also a voice artist, recording dozens of plays for [[BBC]] Radio Drama where his roles ranged from [[J. Edgar Hoover]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/j/j_/j_edgar_hoover.html|title=J Edgar Hoover|work=radiolistings.co.uk|accessdate=January 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Orson Welles]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-third-man-reconstructed-1169350.html|title=The third man reconstructed|date=August 3, 1998|work=independent.co.uk|accessdate=January 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Winston Churchill]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} In audio books, he read works by [[Jack London]], [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [[Robert Bloch]] and [[Carl Hiaasen]] and performed a complete reading of [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' for [[Naxos Records]] Audiobooks in some 24 hours and 50 minutes.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} He also voiced [[Dingodile]] in ''[[Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped]]'', Maximillian Roivas in the cult hit ''[[Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem]]'', and Lucifer in the stop-motion film ''[[The Miracle Maker (2000 film)|The Miracle Maker]]''. He played Bobby Mallory in BBC [[Radio4]]'s dramatisations of [[Sara Paretsky]]'s [[V. I. Warshawski]] novels, alongside [[Kathleen Turner]].

==Death==
Hootkins died of [[pancreatic cancer]] in [[Santa Monica, California]] on October 23, 2005, at the age of 57. His mausoleum is at [[Sparkman-Hillcrest Memorial Park Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;

The '''MSI World Scrabble Championship 2017''' was a [[Scrabble]] tournament organised by [[Mattel]] and Mindsports International (MSI) to determine the [[World Scrabble Championship|world champion]] in English Scrabble. It was held from 22 to 27 August in [[Nottinghamshire]], England. 

The event was split into two divisions according to players' [[World English-Language Scrabble Players' Association]] (WESPA) ratings; the top division comprised some 77 players. 35 games were played on the first four days, after which the top eight proceeded to a 3-game quarterfinals, with the winners advancing to a 5-game semifinals on the same day; the top two players, [[David Eldar]] and [[Harshan Lamabadusuriya]], played a best-of-five final the day after for the top prize of €7,000. Eldar beat Lamabadusuriya 3–0. 

==Background==
The World Scrabble Championship 2017 was originally slated to take place at the Doha Exhibition and Convention Center in [[Qatar]], as part of the 4th Mindsports World Championship (comprising [[chess]], [[Go (game)|go]], [[e-sports]], and Scrabble events) organised by the Mindsports Academy (MSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=25 December 2017|url=https://www.visitqatar.qa/corporate/media/corporate-news-release/2017/april/4th-mindsports-world-championships-to-take-place-in-doha-qatar-in-august-this-year.html|title=4th Mindsports World Championships to take place in Doha, Qatar in August this year|publisher=Qatar Tourism Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Mindsports Academy|url=http://msawc2017.com/|title=2017 4th Mindsports World Championships|accessdate=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the [[2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis]], the championship was relocated to [[Nottingham Trent University]] in [[Nottingham]], Nottinghamshire, England, and held from 22 to 27 August&lt;ref name=Dawn2017&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Dawn|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1341630|title=Scrabble events relocated to Nottingham|date=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the auspices of Mindsports International (the parent organisation of MSA) and sponsored by [[Mattel]], the Qatar Tourism Authority, SamTimer, and the World Mind Sport Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Mindsports Academy|url=https://www.mindsportsacademy.com/Content/Details/3549|title=Event Venue and Information|accessdate=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; MSA also hosted a Junior World Scrabble Championship for players under 21 at the same venue from 19 to 21 August.&lt;ref name=Dawn2017/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Mindsports Academy|url=https://www.mindsportsacademy.com/home/jwsc|title=MSA Junior World Scrabble Championship 2017|accessdate=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
===Preliminary===
After 35 preliminary rounds, the top eight, which included three-time World Champion [[Nigel Richards (Scrabble player)|Nigel Richards]] (2007, 2011, and 2013) and 1993 champion [[Mark Nyman]], advanced to the quarterfinals. 2016 champion [[Brett Smitheram]] finished in fourteenth place, thus failing in his title defence.

'''Zakariya Essabar''' ({{lang-ar|زكريا الصبار}}, {{transl|ar|''Zakariyā aṣ-Ṣabār''}}) (born April 3, 1977)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.interpol.int/notice/search/wanted/2001-46768&lt;/ref&gt; was, according to the governments of the [[United States]], [[Germany]], and other countries, a member of [[al-Qaeda]] and an associate of many of the [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|organizers of the September 11 attacks]].
[[Image:Essabar.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Zakariya Essabar]]

Born on April 3, 1977 in [[Morocco]], Essabar moved to [[Germany]] in 1997, and studied medical technology in college in [[Hamburg]] in 1998. Through the [[Muslim]] religious community there he met [[Ramzi bin al-Shibh]] and other members of the [[Hamburg cell]]. Essabar quickly became more religious while in Germany. He lived for some time at the Hamburg cell apartment.

After being radicalized in 1999, Essabar trained in [[Afghanistan]] where he learned combat skills and passport alteration. Ramzi bin al-Shibh later said that Essabar delivered the cryptic message from [[Khalid Shaikh Mohammed]], indicating the date that the [[September 11 attacks]] would be carried out, although bin al-Shibh's claim is in doubt.&lt;ref name="dailytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_21-5-2005_pg7_53|title=Al Qaeda sent secret message to Afghanistan before 9/11|date=May 21, 2005|work=Daily Times|accessdate=26 April 2010|location=Pakistan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essabar may not have known the significance of the date,&lt;ref name="dailytimes" /&gt; but he did relay the message. The truth of bin al-Shibh's claims is in doubt, due to "inconsistent statements".&lt;ref name="dailytimes" /&gt; Despite a [[Germany|German]] [[arrest warrant]] issued a month after the attacks, Essabar was not captured and, according to al-Qaeda, was later killed in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.makingsenseofjihad.com/2010/12/martyrs-in-a-time-of-alienation-complete.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720060802/http://www.makingsenseofjihad.com/2010/12/martyrs-in-a-time-of-alienation-complete.html |archivedate=2012-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contestants for the Årets Näck title compete by sitting or standing in the river while virtually [[nude]] and playing an instrument (typically the [[violin]]) in order to portray the Nix. Participants have also competed [[a cappella]], on drum, or on accordion.&lt;ref name="acapella"&gt;{{Cite web

==Rules of the competition==
# The competition is open only to male musicians.
# The contestant may only cover himself with things that he can find in nature.
# A musical work will be played by each participant, either a traditional piece or newly composed. It should be performed on a "magically" tuned violin.
# The order of competitors will be decided by a random drawing at the music cafe at Strömbacka Mill prior to the contest.
# A three-man jury of two people skilled in folk music and a non-folk-musician female judge score the contestants according to the following criteria: musical performance, charisma and convincingness. After deliberation the jury announces the results, which can not be appealed.
# The winner receives a priceless handwritten certificate and SEK 2,000 (increased from 2004).
# The winner of each of the three selection criteria receives SEK 500 in premiums (in 1998).
# Since 2004, there has also been a crowd's prize awarded of SEK 500.

On April 23, 2010, [[Olle af Klintberg]] appeared on TV4's [[Talang (TV series)|Talang]], Sweden's "Got Talent" show. In that episode, when the curtains opened, Olle was portraying the Näcken by sitting on a rock with blue cloth on the floor to represent water, and water lilies placed around the stone and in his hair. He played the violin and sang a verse from '''Näcken''', a poem by [[Erik Johan Stagnelius]]. Judges [[Bert Karlsson]] and [[Charlotte Perrelli]] voted against Olle, while [[Johan Pråmell]] voted for him.&lt;ref name="tv4"&gt;{{Cite episode
