In [[topological graph theory]], a '''1-planar graph''' is a graph that can be [[graph drawing|drawn]] in the [[Euclidean plane]] in such a way that each edge has at most one crossing point, where it crosses a single additional edge. If a 1-planar graph, one of the most natural generalizations of [[planar graph]]s, is drawn that way, the drawing is called a '''1-plane graph''' or '''1-planar embedding of the graph'''.

==Coloring==
1-planar graphs were first studied by {{harvtxt|Ringel|1965}}, who showed that they can be [[graph coloring|colored]] with at most seven colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | year = 1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The example of the [[complete graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, which is 1-planar, shows that 1-planar graphs may sometimes require six colors. However, the proof that six colors are always enough is more complicated.

[[File:Prism-vf-color.svg|thumb|left|Coloring the vertices and faces of the triangular prism graph requires six colors]]
Ringel's motivation was in trying to solve a variation of [[total coloring]] for [[planar graph]]s, in which one simultaneously colors the vertices and faces of a planar graph in such a way that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, no two adjacent faces have the same color, and no vertex and face that are adjacent to each other have the same color. This can obviously be done using eight colors by applying the [[four color theorem]] to the given graph and its [[dual graph]] separately, using two disjoint sets of four colors. However, fewer colors may be obtained by forming an auxiliary graph that has a vertex for each vertex or face of the given planar graph, and in which two auxiliary graph vertices are adjacent whenever they correspond to adjacent features of the given planar graph. A [[graph coloring|vertex coloring]] of the auxiliary graph corresponds to a vertex-face coloring of the original planar graph. This auxiliary graph is 1-planar, from which it follows that Ringel's vertex-face coloring problem may also be solved with six colors.&lt;ref name="b84"/&gt; The graph ''K''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; cannot be formed as an auxiliary graph in this way, but nevertheless the vertex-face coloring problem also sometimes requires six colors; for instance, if the planar graph to be colored is a [[triangular prism]], then its eleven vertices and faces require six colors, because no three of them may be given a single color.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

A 1-planar graph is said to be an '''optimal 1-planar graph''' if it has exactly 4''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;8 edges, the maximum possible. In a 1-planar embedding of an optimal 1-planar graph, the uncrossed edges necessarily form a quadrangulation (a [[polyhedral graph]] in which every face is a [[quadrilateral]]). Every quadrangulation gives rise to an optimal 1-planar graph in this way, by adding the two diagonals to each of its quadrilateral faces. It follows that every optimal 1-planar graph is [[Eulerian graph|Eulerian]] (all of its vertices have even [[degree (graph theory)|degree]]), that the minimum degree in such a graph is six, and that every optimal 1-planar graph has at least eight vertices of degree exactly six. Additionally, every optimal 1-planar graph is [[k-vertex-connected graph|4-vertex-connected]], and every 4-vertex cut in such a graph is a separating cycle in the underlying quadrangulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The graphs that have straight 1-planar drawings (that is, drawings in which each edge is represented by a line segment, and in which each line segment is crossed by at most one other edge) have a slightly tighter bound of 4''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;9 on the maximum number of edges, achieved by infinitely many graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Complete multipartite graphs==
[[File:1planar-K2222.svg|thumb|300px|1-planar drawing of the [[Turán graph|cocktail party graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2,2,2,2&lt;/sub&gt;]]
A complete classification of the 1-planar [[complete graph]]s, [[complete bipartite graph]]s, and more generally [[complete multipartite graph]]s is known. Every complete bipartite graph of the form ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2,''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is 1-planar, as is every complete tripartite graph of the form ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1,1,''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Other than these infinite sets of examples, the only complete multipartite 1-planar graphs are ''K''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1,1,1,6&lt;/sub&gt;, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1,1,2,3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2,2,2,2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1,1,1,2,2&lt;/sub&gt;, and their subgraphs. The minimal non-1-planar complete multipartite graphs are ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3,7&lt;/sub&gt;, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4,5&lt;/sub&gt;, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1,3,4&lt;/sub&gt;, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2,3,3&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1,1,1,1,3&lt;/sub&gt;.
For instance, the complete bipartite graph ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3,6&lt;/sub&gt; is 1-planar because it is a subgraph of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1,1,1,6&lt;/sub&gt;, but ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3,7&lt;/sub&gt; is not 1-planar.&lt;ref name="ch12"&gt;{{citation

1-planar graphs have [[Treewidth#Diameter and local treewidth|bounded local treewidth]], meaning that there is a (linear) function ''f'' such that the 1-planar graphs of diameter ''d'' have [[treewidth]] at most ''f''(''d''); the same property holds more generally for the graphs that can be embedded onto a surface of bounded genus with a bounded number of crossings per edge. They also have [[planar separator theorem|separators]], small sets of vertices the removal of which decomposes the graph into connected components whose size is a constant fraction of the size of the whole graph. Based on these properties, numerous algorithms for planar graphs, such as [[Baker's technique]] for designing [[approximation algorithm]]s, can be extended to 1-planar graphs. For instance, this method leads to a [[polynomial-time approximation scheme]] for the [[maximum independent set]] of a 1-planar graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Grigoriev|Bodlaender|2007}}. Grigoriev and Bodlaender state their results only for graphs with a known 1-planar embedding, and use a tree decomposition of a planarization of the embedding with crossings replaced by degree-four vertices; however, their methods straightforwardly imply bounded local treewidth of the original 1-planar graph, allowing Baker's method to be applied directly to it without knowing the embedding.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalizations and related concepts==
The class of graphs analogous to [[outerplanar graph]]s for 1-planarity are called the '''outer-1-planar graphs'''. These are graphs that can be drawn in a disk, with the vertices on the boundary of the disk, and with at most one crossing per edge. These graphs can always be drawn (in an outer-1-planar way) with straight edges and [[RAC drawing|right angle crossings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The 1-planar graphs include the 4-[[map graph]]s, graphs formed from the adjacencies of regions in the plane with at most four regions meeting in any point. Conversely, every optimal 1-planar graph is a 4-map graph. However, 1-planar graphs that are not optimal 1-planar may not be map graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

1-planar graphs have been generalized to ''k''-planar graphs, graphs for which each edge is crossed at most ''k'' times (0-planar graphs are exactly the planar graphs). Ringel defined the '''local crossing number''' of ''G'' to be the least non-negative integer ''k'' such that ''G'' has a ''k''-planar drawing. Because the local crossing number is the maximum [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] of the [[intersection graph]] of the edges of an optimal drawing, and the [[Thickness (graph theory)|thickness]] (minimum number of planar graphs into which the edges can be partitioned) can be seen as the [[chromatic number]] of an intersection graph of an appropriate drawing, it follows from [[Brooks' theorem]] that the thickness is at most one plus the local crossing number.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Nonplanar graphs may also be parameterized by their [[crossing number (graph theory)|crossing number]], the minimum number of pairs of edges that cross in any drawing of the graph. A graph with crossing number ''k'' is necessarily ''k''-planar, but not necessarily vice versa. For instance, the [[Heawood graph]] has crossing number 3, but it is not necessary for its three crossings to all occur on the same edge of the graph, so it is 1-planar, and can in fact be drawn in a way that simultaneously optimizes the total number of crossings and the crossings per edge.

Another related concept for nonplanar graphs is [[graph skewness]], the minimal number of edges that must be removed to make a graph planar.

The ADCIRC system includes an independent multi-algorithmic wind forecast model and also has advanced coupling capabilities, allowing it to integrate effects from sediment transport, ice, waves, surface runoff, and baroclinicity.

== Access ==
The model is free, with source code made available by request via the website&lt;ref name=adcircwebsite /&gt;, allowing users to run the model on any system with a [[List of compilers#Fortran compilers|Fortran compiler]]. A pre-compiled [[Windows]] version of the model can also be purchased alongside the [[SMS (hydrology software)]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aquaveo.com/software/sms-adcirc SMS ADCIRC website]. Retrieved 27 April 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;. ADCIRC is coded in [[Fortran]], and can be used with native [[binary file|binary]], [[ASCII|text]], or [[netCDF]] file formats.

The model formulation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unc.edu/ims/adcirc/adcirc_theory_2004_12_08.pdf ADCIRC Theory Report]. Retrieved on 27 April 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;
is based on the [[shallow water equations]], solving the [[continuity equation#fluid dynamics|continuity equation]] (represented in the form of the Generalized Wave Continuity Equation&lt;ref name="Kinnmark1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kinnmark|first1=Ingemar|title=The Shallow Water Wave Equations: Formulation, Analysis and Application|volume=15|year=1986|issn=0176-5035|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-82646-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
and the momentum equations (with [[Cauchy momentum equation#Convective acceleration|advective]], [[Coriolis force|Coriolis]], [[viscosity#Eddy viscosity|eddy viscosity]], and [[shear stress#shear stress in fluids|surface stress]] terms included).  ADCIRC utilizes the [[finite element method]] in either three-dimensional or two-dimensional depth-integrated form on a triangular [[unstructured grid]] with [[Cartesian Coordinate System|Cartesian]] or [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical]] coordinates. It can run in either [[Barotropic fluid|barotropic]] or [[baroclinic]] modes, allowing inclusion of changes in water density and properties such as salinity and temperature. ADCIRC can be run either in serial mode (e.g. on a personal computer) or in parallel on [[supercomputer|supercomputers]] via [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]]. The model has been optimized to be [[parallel algorithm#parallelizability|highly parallelized]], in order to facilitate rapid computation of large, complex problems.&lt;ref name="KerrDonahue2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kerr|first1=P.

ADCIRC is able to apply several different bottom friction formulations including [[Manning formula|Manning's n]]-based bottom drag due to changes in land coverage (such as forests, cities, and seafloor composition), as well as utilize atmospheric forcing data (wind stress and atmospheric pressure) from several sources, and further reduce the strength of the wind forcing due to [[roughness length|surface roughness]] effects.&lt;ref name="WesterinkLuettich2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Westerink|first1=Joannes J.|last2=Luettich|first2=Richard A.|last3=Feyen|first3=Jesse C.|last4=Atkinson|first4=John H.|last5=Dawson|first5=Clint|last6=Roberts|first6=Hugh J.|last7=Powell|first7=Mark D.|last8=Dunion|first8=Jason P.|last9=Kubatko|first9=Ethan J.|last10=Pourtaheri|first10=Hasan|title=A Basin- to Channel-Scale Unstructured Grid Hurricane Storm Surge Model Applied to Southern Louisiana|journal=Monthly Weather Review|volume=136|issue=3|year=2008|pages=833–864|issn=0027-0644|doi=10.1175/2007MWR1946.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DietrichBunya2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dietrich|first1=J.

The model is also able to incorporate effects such as time-varying topography and bathymetry, boundary fluxes from rivers or other sources, tidal potential, and sub-grid scale features like levees. 

ADCIRC is frequently coupled to a [[wind wave model]] such as STWAVE, [http://swanmodel.sourceforge.net/ SWAN], or [[Wind wave model#WAVEWATCH|WAVEWATCH III]], especially in storm surge applications where [[radiation stress|wave radiation stress]] can have important effects on ocean circulation and vice versa.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4752">In [[algebra]], an '''algebraic fraction''' is a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] whose numerator and denominator are [[algebraic expression]]s. Two examples of algebraic fractions are &lt;math&gt;\frac{3x}{x^2+2x-3}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sqrt{x+2}}{x^2-3}&lt;/math&gt;. Algebraic fractions are subject to the same laws as [[arithmetic fraction]]s.

A '''rational fraction''' is an algebraic fraction whose numerator and denominator are both [[polynomial]]s. Thus &lt;math&gt;\frac{3x}{x^2+2x-3}&lt;/math&gt; is a rational fraction, but not &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sqrt{x+2}}{x^2-3},&lt;/math&gt; because the numerator contains a square root function.

==Terminology==
In the algebraic fraction &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt;, the dividend ''a'' is called the ''numerator'' and the divisor ''b'' is called the ''denominator''. The numerator and denominator are called the ''[[Term (mathematics)|terms]]'' of the algebraic fraction.

A ''complex fraction'' is a fraction whose numerator or denominator, or both, contains a fraction. A ''simple fraction'' contains no fraction either in its numerator or its denominator. A fraction is in ''lowest terms'' if the only factor common to the numerator and the denominator is 1.

An expression which is not in fractional form is an ''integral expression''. An integral expression can always be written in fractional form by giving it the denominator 1. A ''mixed expression'' is the algebraic sum of one or more integral expressions and one or more fractional terms.

==Rational fractions==
{{See also|Rational function}}
If the expressions ''a'' and ''b'' are [[polynomial]]s, the algebraic fraction is called a ''rational algebraic fraction''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bansi Lal|title=Topics in Integral Calculus|page=53|year=2006|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RlQ-tHlWcxcC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=%22rational+algebraic+fraction%22|isbn=9788131800027}}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply ''rational fraction''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ėrnest Borisovich Vinberg|title=A course in algebra|page=131|year=2003|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rzNq39lvNt0C&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=%22rational+fraction%22|isbn=9780821883945}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Parmanand Gupta|title=Comprehensive Mathematics XII|page=739|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DoqIu7L2Yg8C&amp;pg=PA739&amp;dq=%22rational+fraction%22|isbn=9788170087410}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rational fractions are also known as rational expressions. A rational fraction &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{f(x)}{g(x)}&lt;/math&gt; is called ''proper'' if &lt;math&gt;\deg f(x) &lt; \deg g(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and ''improper'' otherwise. For example, the rational fraction &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2x}{x^2-1}&lt;/math&gt; is proper, and the rational fractions &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{x^3+x^2+1}{x^2-5x+6}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{x^2-x+1}{5x^2+3}&lt;/math&gt; are improper. Any improper rational fraction can be expressed as the sum of a polynomial (possibly constant) and a proper rational fraction. In the first example of an improper fraction one has

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^3+x^2+1}{x^2-5x+6} = (x+6) + \frac{24x-35}{x^2-5x+6},&lt;/math&gt;

where the second term is a proper rational fraction. The sum of two proper rational fractions is a proper rational fraction as well. The reverse process of expressing a proper rational fraction as the sum of two or more fractions is called resolving it into [[partial fraction]]s. For example,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2x}{x^2-1} = \frac{1}{x-1} + \frac{1}{x+1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the two terms on the right are called partial fractions.

==Irrational fractions==
An ''irrational fraction'' is one that contains the variable under a fractional exponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Washington McCartney|title=The principles of the differential and integral calculus; and their application to geometry|page=203|year=1844|url=https://books.google.com/?id=o1dLAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA203&amp;dq=%22irrational+fraction%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of an irrational fraction is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^{1/2} - \tfrac13 a}{x^{1/3} - x^{1/2}}.&lt;/math&gt;
The process of transforming an irrational fraction to a rational fraction is known as [[Rationalisation (mathematics)|rationalization]]. Every irrational fraction in which the radicals are [[monomial]]s may be rationalized by finding the [[least common multiple]] of the indices of the roots, and substituting the variable for another variable with the least common multiple as exponent. In the example given, the least common multiple is 6, hence we can substitute &lt;math&gt;x = z^6&lt;/math&gt; to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{z^3 - \tfrac13 a}{z^2 - z^3}.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[mathematics]] and [[signal processing]], an '''analytic signal''' (also known as Gabor analytic signal) is a [[complex-valued function]] that has no [[negative frequency]] components.&lt;ref&gt;``Mathematics of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), with Audio Applications --- Second Edition'', by Julius O. Smith III, W3K Publishing, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-9745607-4-8}}. Copyright © 2014-04-21 by Julius O. Smith III
Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA), Stanford University, https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/r320/Analytic_Signals_Hilbert_Transform.html[7/16/2014 1:07:57 PM]&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; The real and imaginary parts of an analytic signal are real-valued functions related to each other by the [[Hilbert transform]].

The '''analytic representation''' of a [[real number|real-valued]] function is an ''analytic signal'', comprising the original function and its Hilbert transform.  This representation facilitates many mathematical manipulations. The basic idea is that the negative frequency components of the [[Fourier transform]] (or [[spectrum]]) of a real-valued function are superfluous, due to the [[Hermitian symmetry]] of such a spectrum. These negative frequency components can be discarded with no loss of information, provided one is willing to deal with a complex-valued function instead. That makes certain attributes of the function more accessible and facilitates the derivation of modulation and demodulation techniques, such as single-sideband. As long as the manipulated function has no negative frequency components (that is, it is still ''analytic''), the conversion from complex back to real is just a matter of discarding the imaginary part. The analytic representation is a generalization of the [[phasor (sine waves)|phasor]] concept:&lt;ref name=Bracewell&gt;Bracewell, Ron. ''The Fourier Transform and Its Applications''. McGraw-Hill, 1965. p269&lt;/ref&gt; while the phasor is restricted to time-invariant amplitude, phase, and frequency, the analytic signal allows for time-variable parameters.

Analytic signals are also defined using the Fourier quadrature transforms (FQTs) which are derived from the Fourier sine and cosine transforms. These analytic signal representations, also known as Fourier-Singh analytic signal (FSAS) representations, are used for time-frequency-energy (TFE) representation and analysis of nonlinear and non-stationary time-series and other data. This kind of TFE representation is obtained using the discrete cosine tranform (DCT) based Fourier decomposition method (FDM). These FQTs and FSAS representations are effective alternatives of the Hilbert transform (1905) and Gabor analytic signal representation (1946), respectively &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=P. |last=Singh |title=Novel Fourier quadrature transforms and analytic signal representations for nonlinear and non-stationary time-series analysis |journal=Royal Society Open Science |date=November 2018 |volume=5: 181131 |pages=1–26|doi=10.1098/rsos.181131|url=http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royopensci/5/11/181131.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;S(-f) = S(f)^*,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;S(f)^*&lt;/math&gt; is the [[complex conjugate]] of &lt;math&gt;S(f)&lt;/math&gt;.
The function:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
S_\mathrm{a}(f) &amp;\triangleq
\begin{cases}
2S(f), &amp;\text{for}\ f &gt; 0,\\
S(f), &amp;\text{for}\ f = 0,\\
0, &amp;\text{for}\ f &lt; 0
\end{cases}\\
&amp;= \underbrace{2 \operatorname{u}(f)}_{1 + \sgn(f)}S(f) = S(f) + \sgn(f)S(f),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{u}(f)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Heaviside step function]],
*&lt;math&gt;\sgn(f)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[sign function]],

contains only the ''non-negative frequency'' components of &lt;math&gt;S(f)&lt;/math&gt;. And the operation is reversible, due to the Hermitian symmetry of &lt;math&gt;S(f)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
S(f) &amp;=
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{2}S_\mathrm{a}(f), &amp;\text{for}\ f &gt; 0,\\
S_\mathrm{a}(f), &amp;\text{for}\ f = 0,\\
\frac{1}{2}S_\mathrm{a}(-f)^*, &amp;\text{for}\ f &lt; 0\ \text{(Hermitian symmetry)}
\end{cases}\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2}[S_\mathrm{a}(f) + S_\mathrm{a}(-f)^*].
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


The '''analytic signal''' of &lt;math&gt;s(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the inverse Fourier transform of &lt;math&gt;S_\mathrm{a}(f)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
s_\mathrm{a}(t) &amp;\triangleq \mathcal{F}^{-1}[S_\mathrm{a}(f)]\\
&amp;= \mathcal{F}^{-1}[S (f)+ \sgn(f) \cdot S(f)]\\
&amp;= \underbrace{\mathcal{F}^{-1}\{S(f)\}}_{s(t)} + \overbrace{
\underbrace{\mathcal{F}^{-1}\{\sgn(f)\}}_{j\frac{1}{\pi t}} * \underbrace{\mathcal{F}^{-1}\{S(f)\}}_{s(t)}
}^\text{convolution}\\
&amp;= s(t) + j\underbrace{\left[{1 \over \pi t} * s(t)\right]}_{\operatorname{\mathcal{H}}[s(t)]}\\
&amp;= s(t) + j\hat{s}(t),
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt;\hat{s}(t) \triangleq \operatorname{\mathcal{H}}[s(t)]&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hilbert transform]] of &lt;math&gt;s(t)&lt;/math&gt;;
*&lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is the [[convolution]] symbol;
*&lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is the [[imaginary unit]].

==Examples==
===Example 1===
:&lt;math&gt;s(t) = \cos(\omega t),&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; where &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\omega &gt; 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Then:
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{s}(t) = \cos\left(\omega t - \frac{\pi}{2}\right) = \sin(\omega t),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s_\mathrm{a}(t) = s(t) + j\hat{s}(t) = \cos(\omega t) + j\sin(\omega t) = e^{j\omega t}.&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; The third equality is [[Euler's formula]].

A [[corollary]] of [[Euler's formula]] is &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\cos(\omega t) = \tfrac{1}{2} \left(e^{j\omega t} + e^{j (-\omega) t}\right).&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; In general, the analytic representation of a simple sinusoid is obtained by expressing it in terms of complex-exponentials, discarding the [[negative frequency]] component, and doubling the positive frequency component. And the analytic representation of a sum of sinusoids is the sum of the analytic representations of the individual sinusoids.

===Example 2===
Here we use Euler's formula to identify and discard the negative frequency.

:&lt;math&gt;s(t) = \cos(\omega t + \theta) = \frac{1}{2} \left(e^{j (\omega t+\theta)} + e^{-j (\omega t+\theta)}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Then:
:&lt;math&gt;s_\mathrm{a}(t) = 
\begin{cases}
e^{j(\omega t + \theta)} \ \ = \ e^{j |\omega| t}\cdot e^{j\theta} , &amp; \text{if} \ \omega  &gt; 0, \\
e^{-j(\omega t + \theta)} = \ e^{j |\omega| t}\cdot e^{-j\theta} , &amp; \text{if} \ \omega  &lt; 0.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Example 3===
This is another example of using the Hilbert transform method to remove negative frequency components. We note that nothing prevents us from computing &lt;math&gt;s_\mathrm{a}(t)&lt;/math&gt; for a complex-valued &lt;math&gt;s(t)&lt;/math&gt;. But it might not be a reversible representation, because the original spectrum is not symmetrical in general. So except for this example, the general discussion assumes real-valued &lt;math&gt;s(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;s(t) = e^{-j\omega t}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\omega &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Then:
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{s}(t) = je^{-j\omega t},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s_\mathrm{a}(t) = e^{-j\omega t} + j^2 e^{-j\omega t} = e^{-j\omega t} - e^{-j\omega t} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

==Negative frequency components==
Since &lt;math&gt;s(t) = \operatorname{Re}[s_\mathrm{a}(t)]&lt;/math&gt;, restoring the negative frequency components is a simple matter of discarding &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Im}[s_\mathrm{a}(t)]&lt;/math&gt; which may seem counter-intuitive. We can also note that the complex conjugate &lt;math&gt;s_\mathrm{a}^*(t)&lt;/math&gt; comprises ''only'' the negative frequency components. And therefore &lt;math&gt;s(t) = \operatorname{Re}[s_\mathrm{a}^*(t)]&lt;/math&gt; restores the suppressed positive frequency components.

==Applications==
===Envelope and instantaneous phase===
[[Image:analytic.svg|thumb|300px|A function in blue and the magnitude of its analytic representation in red, showing the envelope effect.]]
An analytic signal can also be expressed in [[polar coordinates]], in terms of its time-variant magnitude and phase angle:
:&lt;math&gt;s_\mathrm{a}(t) = s_\mathrm{m}(t)e^{j\phi(t)},&lt;/math&gt;
where:
*&lt;math&gt;s_\mathrm{m}(t) \triangleq |s_\mathrm{a}(t)|&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''instantaneous amplitude'' or the ''[[envelope (waves)|envelope]]'';
*&lt;math&gt;\phi(t) \triangleq \arg\!\left[s_\mathrm{a}(t)\right]&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''[[instantaneous phase]]''.

In the accompanying diagram, the blue curve depicts &lt;math&gt;s(t)&lt;/math&gt; and the red curve depicts the corresponding &lt;math&gt;s_\mathrm{m}(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

The time derivative of the [[phase wrapping|unwrapped]] instantaneous phase has units of ''radians/second'', and is called the ''instantaneous angular frequency'':
:&lt;math&gt;\omega(t) \triangleq \frac{d\phi}{dt}(t).&lt;/math&gt;

The ''[[Instantaneous phase#Instantaneous frequency|instantaneous frequency]]'' (in [[hertz]]) is therefore:
:&lt;math&gt;f(t)\triangleq \frac{1}{2\pi}\omega(t).&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;B. Boashash, "Estimating and Interpreting the Instantaneous Frequency of a Signal-Part I: Fundamentals", Proceedings of the IEEE, Vol. 80, No. 4, pp. 519–538, April 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

The instantaneous amplitude, and the instantaneous phase and frequency are in some applications used to measure and detect local features of the signal. Another application of the analytic representation of a signal relates to demodulation of [[modulation|modulated signals]]. The polar coordinates conveniently separate the effects of [[amplitude modulation]] and phase (or frequency) modulation, and effectively demodulates certain kinds of signals.

=== {{anchor|Complex envelope}} Complex envelope/baseband===
Analytic signals are often shifted in frequency (down-converted) toward 0&amp;nbsp;Hz, possibly creating [non-symmetrical] negative frequency components:
:&lt;math&gt;{s_\mathrm{a}}_{\downarrow}(t) \triangleq s_\mathrm{a}(t)e^{-j\omega_0 t} = s_\mathrm{m}(t)e^{j(\phi(t) - \omega_0 t)},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary reference angular frequency.&lt;ref name=Bracewell/&gt;

This function goes by various names, such as ''complex envelope'' and ''complex [[baseband]]''. The complex envelope is not unique; it is determined by the choice of &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt;. This concept is often used when dealing with [[passband signal]]s. If &lt;math&gt;s(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a modulated signal, &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; might be equated to its [[carrier frequency]]. 

In other cases, &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; is selected to be somewhere in the middle of the desired passband. Then a simple [[low-pass filter]] with real coefficients can excise the portion of interest. Another motive is to reduce the highest frequency, which reduces the minimum rate for alias-free sampling. A frequency shift does not undermine the mathematical tractability of the complex signal representation. So in that sense, the down-converted signal is still ''analytic''. However, restoring the real-valued representation is no longer a simple matter of just extracting the real component. Up-conversion may be required, and if the signal has been [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampled]] (discrete-time), [[interpolation]] ([[upsampling]]) might also be necessary to avoid [[aliasing]].

If &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; is chosen larger than the highest frequency of &lt;math&gt;s_\mathrm{a}(t),&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;{s_\mathrm{a}}_{\downarrow}(t)&lt;/math&gt; has no positive frequencies. In that case, extracting the real component restores them, but in reverse order; the low-frequency components are now high ones and vice versa. This can be used to demodulate a type of [[single sideband]] signal called ''lower sideband'' or ''inverted sideband''.

;Other choices of reference frequency:

Sometimes &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; is chosen to minimize
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{+\infty}(\omega - \omega_0)^2|S_\mathrm{a}(\omega)|^2\, d\omega.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Justice|first=J.|date=1979-12-01|title=Analytic signal processing in music computation|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1163321|journal=IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing|volume=27|issue=6|pages=670–684|doi=10.1109/TASSP.1979.1163321|issn=0096-3518}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; can be chosen to minimize the mean square error in linearly approximating the ''unwrapped'' instantaneous phase &lt;math&gt;\phi(t)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}[\omega(t) - \omega_0]^2 |s_\mathrm{a}(t)|^2\, dt&lt;/math&gt;
or another alternative (for some optimum &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;):
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}[\phi(t) - (\omega_0 t + \theta)]^2\, dt.&lt;/math&gt;

In the field of time-frequency signal processing, it was shown that the analytic signal was needed in the definition of the [[Wigner–Ville distribution]] so that the method can have the desirable properties needed for practical applications.&lt;ref&gt;B. Boashash, “Notes on the use of the Wigner distribution for time frequency signal analysis”, IEEE Trans. on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing , vol. 26, no. 9, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the phrase "complex envelope" is given the simpler meaning of the [[complex amplitude]] of a (constant-frequency) phasor;{{efn|"the complex envelope (or complex amplitude)"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tOeeJyP95IQC|title=Time-Frequency Analysis|last=Hlawatsch|first=Franz|last2=Auger|first2=François|date=2013-03-01|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118623831|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn|"the complex envelope (or complex amplitude)", p.&amp;nbsp;586 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kxICp6t-CDAC&amp;lpg=RA1-PA586&amp;dq=%2522complex%2520amplitude%2522%2520%2522complex%2520envelope%2522&amp;pg=RA1-PA586#v=onepage&amp;q=%2522complex%2520amplitude%2522%2520%2522complex%2520envelope%2522&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Optical Engineering: Abe-Las, pages 1-1024|last=Driggers|first=Ronald G.|date=2003-01-01|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780824742508|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
other times the complex envelope &lt;math&gt; s_m(t)&lt;/math&gt; as defined above is interpreted as a time-dependent generalization of the complex amplitude.{{efn|"Complex envelope is an extended interpretation of complex amplitude as a function of time." p.&amp;nbsp;85&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tXQy5JdQyZoC|title=Global Environment Remote Sensing|last=Okamoto|first=Kenʼichi|date=2001-01-01|publisher=IOS Press|isbn=9781586031015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Their relationship is not unlike that in the real-valued case: varying [[Envelope (waves)|envelope]] generalizing constant [[amplitude]].

==Extensions of the analytic signal to signals of multiple variables==
The concept of analytic signal is well-defined for signals of a single variable which typically is time. For signals of two or more variables, an analytic signal can be defined in different ways, and two approaches are presented below.

===Multi-dimensional analytic signal based on an ad hoc direction===
A straightforward generalization of the analytic signal can be done for a multi-dimensional signal once it is established what is meant by ''negative frequencies'' for this case. This can be done by introducing a [[unit vector]] &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \hat{u}&lt;/math&gt; in the Fourier domain and label any frequency vector &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \xi&lt;/math&gt; as negative if &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \xi \cdot \boldsymbol \hat{u} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. The analytic signal is then produced by removing all negative frequencies and multiply the result by 2, in accordance to the procedure described for the case of one-variable signals. However, there is no particular direction for &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \hat{u}&lt;/math&gt; which must be chosen unless there are some additional constraints. Therefore, the choice of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \hat{u}&lt;/math&gt; is ad hoc, or application specific.

===The monogenic signal===
The real and imaginary parts of the analytic signal correspond to the two elements of the vector-valued [[monogenic signal]], as it is defined for one-variable signals. However, the monogenic signal can be extended to arbitrary number of variables in a straightforward manner, producing an {{nobreak|(''n'' + 1)}}-dimensional vector-valued function for the case of ''n''-variable signals.

'''Apostolos K. Doxiadis''' ({{lang-el|Απόστολος Κ. Δοξιάδης}}; born 1953) is a Greek writer. He is best known for his international bestsellers ''[[Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture]]'' (2000) and ''[[Logicomix]]'' (2009).

==Early life==
Doxiadis was born in Australia, where his father, the architect [[Constantinos Apostolou Doxiadis]] was working. Soon after his birth, the family returned to Athens, where Doxiadis grew up. Though his earliest interests were in poetry, fiction and the theatre, an intense interest in mathematics led Doxiadis to leave school at age fifteen, to attend [[Columbia University]], in [[New York City|New York]], from which he obtained a bachelor's degree in Mathematics in May 1972. He then attended the [[École Pratique des Hautes Études]] in [[Paris]] from which he got a master's degree, with a thesis on the mathematical modeling of the nervous system. His father’s death and family reasons made him return to Greece in 1975, interrupting his graduate studies. In Greece, although involved for some years with the computer software industry, Doxiadis returned to his childhood and adolescence loves of theatre and the cinema, before becoming a full-time writer.

==Work==

===Fiction in Greek===
Doxiadis began to write in Greek. His first published work was ''A Parallel Life'' (''Βίος Παράλληλος'', 1985), a novella set in the monastic communities of 4th century CE Egypt. His first novel, ''Makavettas'' (''Μακαβέττας'', 1988), recounted the adventures of a fictional power-hungry colonel at the time of the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974]]. Written in a tongue-in-cheek imitation of Greek folk military memoirs, such as that of [[Yannis Makriyannis]], it follows the plot of Shakespeare’s ''[[Macbeth]]'', of which the eponymous hero’s name is a Hellenized form. Doxiadis next novel, ''Uncle Petros and Goldbach’s Conjecture'' (''Ο Θείος Πέτρος και η Εικασία του Γκόλντμπαχ'', 1992), was the first long work of fiction whose plot takes place in the world of pure mathematics research. The first Greek critics did not find the mathematical themes appealing, and it received mediocre reviews, unlike Doxiadis’s first two works, which were well received. Τhe novella ''The Three Little Men'' (''Τα Τρία Ανθρωπάκια'', 1998), attempts a modern-day retelling of the tale of a classic fairy-tale.

===Fiction in English===
In 1998, Doxiadis translated into English, significantly re-working, his third novel, which was published in England in 2000 as ''[[Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture]]'' (UK publisher: [[Faber and Faber]]; United States publisher: [[Bloomsbury USA]].) The book became an international bestseller, and has been published to date in more than thirty-five languages. It has received the praise of, among others, Nobel Laureate [[John Forbes Nash, Jr.|John Nash]], British mathematician [[Sir Michael Atiyah]], critic [[George Steiner]] and psychiatrist [[Oliver Sacks]]. ''Uncle Petros'' is one of the ''[[1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://1001beforeyoudie.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110124836/http://1001beforeyoudie.com/ |date=2014-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Doxiadis’ next project, which took over five years to complete, was the graphic novel ''[[Logicomix]]'' (2009), a number one bestseller on the [[New York Times Bestseller List]] and an international bestseller, already published in over twenty languages. ''Logicomix'' was co-authored with computer scientist [[Christos Papadimitriou]], with art work by [[Alecos Papadatos]] (pencils) and Annie Di Donna (color). Renowned comics historian and critic R. C. Harvey, in the ''[[Comics Journal]]'', called ''Logicomix'' “a tour-de-force” a “virtuoso performance”,&lt;ref&gt;http://classic.tcj.com/history/logicomix-a-tour-de-force/&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[The Sunday Times]]''’ Brian Appleyard called it “probably the best and certainly the most extraordinary graphic novel” he has read. ''Logicomix'' is one of Paul Gravett’s ''1001 Comics You Must Read Before you Die.'' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.paulgravett.com/index.php/1001_comics/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre and cinema===
In the early stage of his career, Doxiadis directed in the professional theatre, in Athens, and worked as translator, translating, among other plays, [[William Shakespeare]]’s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[Midsummer Night’s Dream]]'', as well as [[Eugene O’Neill]]’s ''[[Mourning Becomes Electra]]''.

He has written two plays for the theatre. The first was a full-length shadow-puppet play ''The Tragical History of Jackson Pollock, Abstract Expressionist'' (1999), in English, of which he also designed and directed the Athens performance.&lt;ref&gt;Watch a performance, filmed by Doxiadis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJMyQ4Bkiow&lt;/ref&gt; In this play, Doxiadis realized some of his views on “epic theatre”, in other words a theatre based on storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;Read his own views on the matter in an interview: http://www.apostolosdoxiadis.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=158&amp;Itemid=94{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; His second play, ''Incompleteness'' (2005), is an imaginary account of the last seventeen days in the life of the great logician [[Kurt Gödel]], which Gödel spent in a Princeton, New Jersey, hospital, refusing to eat out of fear that he was being poisoned. The play was staged in Athens, in 2006, as Dekati Evdomi Nyhta (Seventeenth Night) with the actor Yorgos Kotanidis in the role of Kurt Gödel.

Doxiadis has also written and directed two feature-length films, in Greek, ''Underground Passage'' (''Υπόγεια Διαδρομή'', 1983) and ''Terirem'' (''Τεριρέμ'', 1987). The latter won the [[CICAE]] (International Confederation of Art Cinemas) prize for Best Film in the 1988 [[Berlin International Film Festival]].

===Scholarship===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10983">In [[mathematics]], '''Apéry's theorem''' is a result in [[number theory]] that states the [[Apéry's constant]] ζ(3) is [[irrational Number|irrational]].  That is, the number
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta(3)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3}=\frac{1}{1^3}+\frac{1}{2^3}+\frac{1}{3^3}+\ldots = 1.2020569\ldots&lt;/math&gt;
cannot be written as a fraction ''p''/''q'' with ''p'' and ''q'' being integers.

The special values of the [[Riemann zeta function]] at even integers ''2n'' (''n &gt; 0'') can be shown in terms of [[Bernoulli number]]s to be irrational, while it remains open whether the function's values are in general rational or not at the odd integers ''2n + 1'' (''n'' &gt; 1) (though they are conjectured to be irrational).

==History==

[[Euler]] proved that if ''n'' is a positive integer then
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1^{2n}}+\frac{1}{2^{2n}}+\frac{1}{3^{2n}}+\frac{1}{4^{2n}}+\ldots = \frac{p}{q}\pi^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;
for some rational number ''p''/''q''. Specifically, writing the infinite series on the left as ζ(2''n'') he showed
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta(2n) = (-1)^{n+1}\frac{B_{2n}(2\pi)^{2n}}{2(2n)!}&lt;/math&gt;
where the ''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the rational [[Bernoulli numbers]]. Once it was proved that π&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is always irrational this showed that ζ(2''n'') is irrational for all positive integers ''n''.

No such representation in terms of π is known for the so-called [[zeta constants]] for odd arguments, the values ζ(2''n''+1) for positive integers ''n''. It has been conjectured that the ratios of these quantities
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\zeta(2n+1)}{\pi^{2n+1}},&lt;/math&gt;
are transcendental for every integer ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kohnen | first=Winfried |title=Transcendence conjectures about periods of modular forms and rational structures on spaces of modular forms |journal=Proc. Indian Acad. Sci. Math. Sci. |volume=99 | number=3 |year=1989 |pages=231–233 |doi=10.1007/BF02864395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of this, no proof could be found to show that the zeta constants with odd arguments were irrational, even though they were (and still are) all believed to be [[transcendental number|transcendental]]. However, in June 1978, [[Roger Apéry]] gave a talk titled "Sur l'irrationalité de ζ(3)."  During the course of the talk he outlined proofs that ζ(3) and ζ(2) were irrational, the latter using methods simplified from those used to tackle the former rather than relying on the expression in terms of π. Due to the wholly unexpected nature of the result and Apéry's blasé and very sketchy approach to the subject many of the mathematicians in the audience dismissed the proof as flawed. However [[Henri Cohen (number theorist)|Henri Cohen]], [[Hendrik Lenstra]], and [[Alfred van der Poorten]] suspected Apéry was on to something and set out to confirm his proof. Two months later they finished verification of Apéry's proof, and on August 18 Cohen delivered a lecture giving full details of the proof. After the lecture Apéry himself took to the podium to explain the source of some of his ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=A. van der Poorten |title=A proof that Euler missed... |journal=[[The Mathematical Intelligencer]] |volume=1 |issue=4 |year=1979 |pages=195–203 |doi=10.1007/BF03028234 |url=http://pracownicy.uksw.edu.pl/mwolf/Poorten_MI_195_0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apéry's proof==

Apéry's original proof&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Apéry | first1 = R. | year = 1979 | title = Irrationalité de ζ(2) et ζ(3) | url = | journal = Astérisque | volume = 61 | issue = | pages = 11–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Apéry | first1 = R. | year = 1981 | chapter=Interpolation de fractions continues et irrationalité de certaines constantes | title=Bulletin de la section des sciences du C.T.H.S III | pages=37–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was based on the well known irrationality criterion from [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]], which states that a number ξ is irrational if there are infinitely many coprime integers ''p'' and ''q'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;\left|\xi-\frac{p}{q}\right|&lt;\frac{c}{q^{1+\delta}}&lt;/math&gt;
for some fixed ''c'',δ&gt;0.

The starting point for Apéry was the series representation of ζ(3) as
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta(3) = \frac{5}{2} \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n^3\binom{2n}{n}}.&lt;/math&gt;
Roughly speaking, Apéry then defined a sequence ''c&lt;sub&gt;n,k&lt;/sub&gt;'' which converges to ζ(3) about as fast as the above series, specifically
:&lt;math&gt;c_{n,k}=\sum_{m=1}^{n}\frac{1}{m^{3}}+\sum_{m=1}^{k}\frac{(-1)^{m-1}}{2m^{3}\binom{n}{m}\binom{n+m}{m}}.&lt;/math&gt;
He then defined two more sequences ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' that, roughly, have the quotient ''c&lt;sub&gt;n,k&lt;/sub&gt;''.  These sequences were
:&lt;math&gt;a_{n}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}c_{n,k}\binom{n}{k}^{2}\binom{n+k}{k}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;b_{n}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{k}^{2}\binom{n+k}{k}^{2}.&lt;/math&gt;
The sequence ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''/''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' converges to ζ(3) fast enough to apply the criterion, but unfortunately ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is not an integer after ''n''=2.  Nevertheless, Apéry showed that even after multiplying ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' by a suitable integer to cure this problem the convergence was still fast enough to guarantee irrationality.

==Later proofs==

Within a year of Apéry's result an alternative proof was found by [[Frits Beukers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=F. Beukers |title=A note on the irrationality of ζ(2) and ζ(3) |journal=Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society |volume=11 |year=1979 |issue=3 |pages=268–272 |doi=10.1112/blms/11.3.268}}&lt;/ref&gt; who replaced Apéry's series with integrals involving the [[shifted Legendre polynomials]] &lt;math&gt;\tilde{P_{n}}(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Using a representation that would later be generalized to [[Hadjicostas's formula]], Beukers showed that
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{1}\int_{0}^{1}\frac{-\log(xy)}{1-xy}\tilde{P_{n}}(x)\tilde{P_{n}}(y)dxdy=\frac{A_{n}+B_{n}\zeta(3)}{\operatorname{lcm}\left[1,\ldots,n\right]^{3}}&lt;/math&gt;
for some integers ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' (sequences {{OEIS2C|A171484}} and {{OEIS2C|A171485}}). Using partial integration and the assumption that ζ(3) was rational and equal to ''a''/''b'', Beukers eventually derived the inequality
:&lt;math&gt;0&lt;\frac{1}{b}\leq\left|A_{n}+B_{n}\zeta(3)\right|\leq 4\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^{n},&lt;/math&gt;
which is a [[Proof by contradiction|contradiction]] since the right-most expression tends to zero and so must eventually fall below 1/''b''.

A more recent proof by [[Wadim Zudilin]]&lt;ref&gt;W. Zudilin (2002), [https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0202159 ''An Elementary Proof of Apéry's Theorem''].&lt;/ref&gt; is more reminiscent of Apéry's original proof, and also has similarities to a fourth proof by [[Yuri Valentinovich Nesterenko|Yuri Nesterenko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ю. В. Нестеренко |script-title=ru:Некоторые замечания о ζ(3) |language=Russian |journal=Матем. Заметки |volume=59 |issue=6 |year=1996 |pages=865–880 |url=http://mi.mathnet.ru/mz1785}} English translation: {{cite journal |author=Yu. V. Nesterenko |title=A Few Remarks on ζ(3) |journal=Math. Notes |volume=59 |issue=6 |year=1996 |pages=625–636 |doi=10.1007/BF02307212}}&lt;/ref&gt; These later proofs again derive a contradiction from the assumption that ζ(3) is rational by constructing sequences that tend to zero but are bounded below by some positive constant.  They are somewhat less transparent than the earlier proofs, relying as they do on hypergeometric series.

==Higher zeta constants==

Apéry and Beukers could simplify their proofs to work on ζ(2) as well thanks to the series representation
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta(2)=3\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{2}\binom{2n}{n}}.&lt;/math&gt;
Due to the success of Apéry's method a search was undertaken for a number ξ&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; with the property that
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta(5)=\xi_{5}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n^{5}\binom{2n}{n}}.&lt;/math&gt;
If such a ξ&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; were found then the methods used to prove Apéry's theorem would be expected to work on a proof that ζ(5) is irrational.  Unfortunately, extensive computer searching&lt;ref&gt;D. H. Bailey, J. Borwein, N. Calkin, R. Girgensohn, R. Luke, and V. Moll, ''Experimental Mathematics in Action'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; has failed to find such a constant, and in fact it is now known that if ξ&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; exists and if it is an algebraic number of degree at most 25, then the coefficients in its [[Minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]] must be enormous, at least 10&lt;sup&gt;383&lt;/sup&gt;, so extending Apéry's proof to work on the higher odd zeta constants doesn't seem likely to work.

Despite this, many mathematicians working in this area expect a breakthrough sometime soon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jorn Steuding |title=Diophantine Analysis (Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications) |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC |location=Boca Raton |year=2005 |pages=280|isbn=978-1-58488-482-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, recent work by [[Wadim Zudilin]] and Tanguy Rivoal has shown that infinitely many of the numbers ζ(2''n''+1) must be irrational,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rivoal | first1 = T. | year = 2000 | title = La fonction zeta de Riemann prend une infinité de valeurs irrationnelles aux entiers impairs | url = | journal = Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences, Série I | volume = 331 | issue = | pages = 267–270 |doi = 10.1016/S0764-4442(00)01624-4 |arxiv=math/0008051| bibcode = 2000CRASM.331..267R}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even that at least one of the numbers ζ(5), ζ(7), ζ(9), and ζ(11) must be irrational.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=W. Zudilin |title=One of the numbers ζ(5), ζ(7), ζ(9), ζ(11) is irrational |journal=Russ. Math. Surv. |year=2001 |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=774–776 |doi=10.1070/RM2001v056n04ABEH000427|bibcode=2001RuMaS..56..774Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their work uses linear forms in values of the zeta function and estimates upon them to bound the dimension of a [[vector space]] spanned by values of the zeta function at odd integers. Hopes that Zudilin could cut his list further to just one number did not materialise, but work on this problem is still an active area of research. Higher zeta constants have application to physics: they describe correlation functions in [[Heisenberg model (quantum)|quantum spin chains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=H. E. Boos |author2=V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1536">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] study of [[partial differential equations]], the '''Bateman transform''' is a method for solving the [[Laplace equation]] in four dimensions and [[wave equation]] in three by using a [[line integral]] of a [[holomorphic function]] in three [[complex number|complex variables]].  It is named after the English mathematician [[Harry Bateman]], who first published the result in {{harv|Bateman|1904}}.

The formula asserts that if ''ƒ'' is a holomorphic function of three complex variables, then

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(w,x,y,z) = \oint_\gamma f\left((w+ix)+(iy+z)\zeta,(iy-z)+(w-ix)\zeta,\zeta\right)\,d\zeta&lt;/math&gt;

is a solution of the Laplace equation, which follows by differentiation under the integral.  Furthermore, Bateman asserted that the most general solution of the Laplace equation arises in this way.

== Definition ==
The Canberra distance ''d'' between vectors '''p''' and '''q''' in an ''n''-dimensional [[real number|real]] [[vector space]] is given as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;d(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{q}) = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{|p_i-q_i|}{|p_i|+|q_i|}&lt;/math&gt;

where 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}=(p_1,p_2,\dots,p_n)\text{ and }\mathbf{q}=(q_1,q_2,\dots,q_n)&lt;/math&gt; 
are [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s.

The Canberra metric, Adkins form, divides the distance d by (n-Z) where Z is the number of attributes that are 0 for p and q.

'''Chirality''' {{IPAc-en|k|aɪ|ˈ|r|æ|l|ɪ|t|i}} is a geometric property of some molecules and ions.  A chiral molecule/ion is non-superposable on its [[mirror image]]. The presence of an [[asymmetric carbon|asymmetric carbon center]] is one of several structural features that induce [[chirality]] in organic and inorganic molecules.&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (4th Edition) Paula Y. Bruice. Pearson Educational Books. {{ISBN|9780131407480}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (3rd Edition) Marye Anne Fox, James K. Whitesell Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers (2004)

The mirror images of a chiral molecule or ion are called [[enantiomer]]s or '''optical [[isomer]]s'''. Individual enantiomers are often designated as either [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|right-handed or left-handed]]. Chirality is an essential consideration when discussing the [[stereochemistry]] in [[organic chemistry|organic]] and [[inorganic chemistry]].  The concept is of great practical importance because most biomolecules and pharmaceuticals are chiral.

Chiral molecules and ions are described by various ways of designating their [[absolute configuration]], which codify either the entity's geometry or its [[polarimetry|ability to rotate plane-polarized light]], a common technique in studying chirality.

== Definition ==
Chirality is based on [[Molecular symmetry|molecular symmetry elements]]. Specifically, a chiral compound can contain no [[improper axis of rotation]] (S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), which includes planes of symmetry and inversion center. Chiral molecules are always dissymmetric (lacking S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) but not always asymmetric (lacking all symmetry elements except the trivial identity).  Asymmetric molecules are always chiral.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton, F. A., "Chemical Applications of Group Theory," John Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stereogenic centers==
{{main article|Stereogenic center}}
In general, chiral molecules have '''point chirality''' at a single ''stereogenic'' atom, which has four different substituents. The two enantiomers of such compounds are said to have different '''absolute configurations''' at this center. This center is thus stereogenic (i.e., a grouping within a molecular entity that may be considered a focus of stereoisomerism). The stereogenic atom (also known as the ''stereocenter'') is usually carbon, as in many biological molecules.  However a stereocenter can coincide with any atom, including metals (as in many chiral [[coordination compound]]s), phosphorus, or sulfur. The low barrier of [[nitrogen inversion]] make most ''N''-chiral amines (NRR′R″) impossible to resolve, but [[P-Chiral phosphine|''P''-chiral phosphines]] (PRR′R″) as well as S-chiral sulfoxides (OSRR′) are optically stable.
[[File:R-BINOL-2D-skeletal.png|thumb|144px|right|[[1,1'-Bi-2-naphthol|1,1′-Bi-2-naphthol]] is an example of a molecule lacking point chirality.]]
While the presence of a stereogenic atom describes the great majority of chiral molecules, many variations and exceptions exist. For instance it is not necessary for the chiral substance to have a stereogenic atom.  Examples include 1-bromo-3-chloro-5-fluoro[[adamantane]], methylethylphenyl[[tetrahedrane]], certain [[calixarenes]] and [[fullerenes]], which have [[inherent chirality]].  The [[C2-Symmetric ligands|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric species]] [[1,1'-Bi-2-naphthol|1,1′-bi-2-naphthol]] (BINOL), 1,3-dichloro[[Propadiene|allene]] have [[axial chirality]]. (''E'')-[[cyclooctene]] and many [[ferrocene]]s have [[planar chirality]].

When the optical [[Levorotation and dextrorotation|rotation]] for an enantiomer is too low for practical measurement, the species is said to exhibit [[cryptochirality]].

Even isotopic differences must be considered when examining chirality. Illustrative is the derivative of [[benzyl alcohol]] PhCHDOH, which is chiral. The ''S'' enantiomer has [''α'']&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; = +0.715°.&lt;ref&gt;{{note|Streitwieser}}{{cite journal |author1=Streitwieser, A., Jr. |author2=Wolfe, J. R., Jr. |author3=Schaeffer, W.

==In biochemistry==
Many biologically active molecules are chiral, including the naturally occurring [[amino acid]]s (the building blocks of [[protein]]s) and [[sugar]]s. In biological systems, most of these compounds are of the same chirality: most amino acids are [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|levorotatory]] ({{smallcaps all|L}}) and sugars are [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|dextrorotatory]] ({{smallcaps all|D}}). Typical naturally occurring proteins are made of {{smallcaps all|L}}-amino acids and are known as ''left-handed proteins''; the comparably rarer {{smallcaps all|D}}-amino acids produce ''right-handed proteins''.

The origin of this [[homochirality]] in [[biology]] is the subject of much debate.&lt;ref name=Meierhenrich08&gt;{{cite book | author= Meierhenrich, Uwe J.  | year= 2008 | title= Amino acids and the Asymmetry of Life | edition = | location = Berlin, GER | publisher = Springer | isbn= 3540768858 | chapter =  | pages = | url = | access-date = | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most scientists believe that Earth life's "choice" of chirality was purely random, and that if carbon-based life forms exist elsewhere in the universe, their chemistry could theoretically have opposite chirality. However, there is some suggestion that early amino acids could have formed in comet dust. In this case, circularly polarised radiation (which makes up 17% of stellar radiation) could have caused the selective destruction of one chirality of amino acids, leading to a selection bias which ultimately resulted in all life on Earth being homochiral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McKee |first=Maggie |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7895-space-radiation-may-select-amino-acids-for-life.html |title=Space radiation may select amino acids for life |publisher=New Scientist |date=2005-08-24 |accessdate=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Meierhenrich Uwe J., Nahon Laurent, Alcaraz Christian, Hendrik Bredehöft Jan, Hoffmann Søren V., Barbier Bernard, Brack André | year = 2005 | title = Asymmetric Vacuum UV photolysis of the Amino Acid Leucine in the Solid State | url = | journal = Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 5630–5634 | doi = 10.1002/anie.200501311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Enzyme]]s, which are chiral, often distinguish between the two enantiomers of a chiral substrate. One could imagine an enzyme as having a glove-like cavity that binds a substrate. If this glove is right-handed, then one enantiomer will fit inside and be bound, whereas the other enantiomer will have a poor fit and is unlikely to bind.

{{smallcaps all|L}}-forms of amino acids tend to be tasteless, whereas {{smallcaps all|D}}-forms tend to taste sweet.&lt;ref name=Meierhenrich08/&gt; [[Spearmint]] leaves contain the {{smallcaps all|L}}-enantiomer of the chemical [[carvone]] or ''R''-(−)-carvone and [[caraway]] seeds contain the {{smallcaps all|D}}-enantiomer or ''S''-(+)-carvone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jf60176a035 | title=Chemical and sensory data supporting the difference between the odors of the enantiomeric carvones |author1=Theodore J.

Chirality is important in context of ordered phases as well, for example the addition of a small amount of an optically active molecule to a nematic phase (a phase that has long range orientational order of molecules) transforms that phase to a chiral nematic phase (or cholesteric phase). Chirality in context of such phases in polymeric fluids has also been studied in this context.&lt;ref name=Srinivasarao&gt;{{cite journal | author= Srinivasarao, M. | year = 1999 | title= Chirality and Polymers | journal = Current Opinion in Colloid &amp; Interface Science | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 369–376 | doi = | url=  | quote =  }} {{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Complex (chemistry)#Optical isomerism|l1=Complex (chemistry): Isomerism}}
Chirality is a symmetry property, not a characteristic of any part of the periodic table.  Thus many inorganic materials, molecules, and ions are chiral.  [[Quartz]] is an example from the mineral kingdom.  Such noncentric materials are of interest for applications in [[nonlinear optics]].

In the areas of [[coordination chemistry]] and [[organometallic chemistry]], chirality is pervasive and of practical importance.  A famous example is [[Tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride|tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II)]] complex in which the three bipyridine ligands adopt a chiral propeller-like arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;von Zelewsky, A. (1995). ''Stereochemistry of Coordination Compounds.'' Chichester: John Wiley.. {{ISBN|047195599X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two enantiomers of complexes such as [Ru(2,2′-bipyridine)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; may be designated as Λ (capital [[lambda]], the Greek version of "L") for a left-handed twist of the propeller described by the ligands, and Δ (capital [[delta (letter)|delta]], Greek "D") for a right-handed twist (pictured).

Chiral ligands confer chirality to a metal complex, as illustrated by metal-[[amino acid]] complexes.  If the metal exhibits catalytic properties, its combination with a chiral ligand is the basis of [[asymmetric catalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Hartwig, J. F. Organotransition Metal Chemistry, from Bonding to Catalysis; University Science Books: New York, 2010. {{ISBN|189138953X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods and practices==

The term ''[[optical activity]]'' is derived from the interaction of chiral materials with polarized light. In a solution, the (−)-form, or [[levorotatory]] form, of an optical isomer [[Levorotation and dextrorotation|rotates]] the plane of a beam of [[Linear polarization|linearly polarized light]] [[counterclockwise]]. The (+)-form, or [[dextrorotatory]] form, of an optical isomer does the opposite. The rotation of light is measured using a [[polarimeter]] and is expressed as the optical rotation.

==Miscellaneous nomenclature==
* Any non-[[racemic]] chiral substance is called '''scalemic'''.  Scalemic materials can be enantiopure or enantioenriched.&lt;ref name=EllielChir97&gt;{{cite journal | author = Eliel, E.L. | year = 1997 | title = Infelicitous Stereochemical Nomenclatures | journal = Chirality | volume = 9 | pages = 428–430 | url =  https://www.uottawa.ca/publications/interscientia/inter.4/eliel/eliel.html | access-date = 5 February 2016 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1520-636x(1997)9:5/6&lt;428::aid-chir5&gt;3.3.co;2-e}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A chiral substance is '''enantiopure''' when only one of two possible enantiomers is present so that all molecules within a sample  have the same chirality sense. Use of '''homochiral''' as a synonym is strongly discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=asymmetric synthesis| file = E02072}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A chiral substance is '''enantioenriched''' or '''heterochiral''' when its enantiomeric ratio is greater than 50:50 but less than 100:0.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=enantiomerically enriched (enantioenriched)| file = E02071}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Enantiomeric excess]] or '''e.e.''' is the difference between how much of one enantiomer is present compared to the other. For example, a sample with 40% e.e. of ''R'' contains 70% ''R'' and 30% ''S'' (70% − 30% = 40%).&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=enantiomer excess (enantiomeric excess)| file = E02070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The rotation of plane polarized light by chiral substances was first observed by [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] in 1815,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Lakhtakia, A. (ed.) | title=Selected Papers on Natural Optical Activity (SPIE Milestone Volume 15) |publisher=SPIE | year=1990 }}{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gained considerable importance in the sugar industry, analytical chemistry, and pharmaceuticals. [[Louis Pasteur]] deduced in 1848 that this phenomenon has a molecular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Pasteur, L. | title=Researches on the molecular asymmetry of natural organic products, English translation of French original, published by Alembic Club Reprints (Vol. 14, pp. 1–46) in 1905, facsimile reproduction by SPIE in a 1990 book | year=1848}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authors = Eliel, Ernest Ludwig; Wilen, Samuel H. &amp; Mander, Lewis N. | year = 1994 | title = Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds | edition = 1st | chapter = Chirality in Molecules Devoid of Chiral Centers (Chapter 14) | pages = | location = New York, NY, USA | publisher = Wiley &amp; Sons | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IyfwAAAAMAAJ | access-date = 2 February 2016 | isbn =  0471016705 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''chirality'' itself was coined by [[Lord Kelvin]] in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Bentley, Ronald | year = 1995 | title = From Optical Activity in Quartz to Chiral Drugs: Molecular Handedness in Biology and Medicine. | journal=[[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|Perspect.

'''Chuu-Lian Terng''' ({{zh|t=滕楚蓮|p=Téng Chǔlián}}) is a Taiwanese-American [[mathematician]].  She received her B.S. from [[National Taiwan University]] in 1971 and her Ph.D. from [[Brandeis University]] in 1976&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UCI ADVANCE Program Advance Chair &gt; Chuu-Lian Terng|url=http://advance.uci.edu/pages/AChair-Terng.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the supervision of [[Richard Palais]],&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=35876}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom she later married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Richard Palais' Home Page|url=http://vmm.math.uci.edu/|publisher=University of California at Irvine, Department of Mathematics|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is currently a professor at [[University of California at Irvine]].
She was a professor at [[Northeastern University]] for many years. Before joining Northeastern, she spent two years at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and four years at [[Princeton University]]. She also spent two years at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] (IAS) in Princeton and two years at the [[Max-Planck Institute]] in [[Bonn, Germany]].

In 1999, her [[Association for Women in Mathematics]] press release reads:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=1999|title=AWM-MAA Invited Lecture: Chuu-Lian Terng|url=http://awm-math.org/maalectures/terng1999.html|publisher=Association for Women in Mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Her early research concerned the classification of [[natural transformation|natural]] [[vector bundle]]s and natural [[differential operator]]s between them. She then became interested in [[submanifold]] geometry. Her main contributions are developing a structure theory for [[isoparametric manifold|isoparametric]] submanifolds in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and constructing [[soliton]] equations from special submanifolds. Recently, Terng and [[Karen Uhlenbeck]] ([[University of Texas at Austin]]) have developed a general approach to [[integrable system|integrable]] PDEs that explains their hidden symmetries in terms of [[loop group]] actions. She is co-author of the book Submanifold Geometry and Critical Point Theory and an editor of the Journal of Differential Geometry survey volume 4 on "Integrable systems".

Professor Terng served as President of the [[Association for Women in Mathematics]] (AWM) from 1995 to 1997 and as Member-at-Large of the Council of the [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS) from 1989 to 1992. She is currently on the Advisory Board of the National Center for Theoretical Sciences in Taiwan, the Steering Committee of the [[IAS/Park City Summer Institute]], and the Editorial Board of the Transactions of the AMS.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[Fourier analysis]], the '''conjugate Fourier series''' arises by realizing the Fourier series formally as the boundary values of the [[real part]] of a [[holomorphic function]] on the [[unit disc]].  The [[imaginary part]] of that function then defines the conjugate series.  {{harvtxt|Zygmund|1968}} studied the delicate questions of convergence of this series, and its relationship with the [[Hilbert transform]].

In detail, consider a [[trigonometric series]] of the form

:&lt;math&gt;f(\theta) = \tfrac12 a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(a_n\cos n\theta + b_n\sin n\theta\right)&lt;/math&gt;

in which the coefficients ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are [[real number]]s.  This series is the real part of the [[power series]]

:&lt;math&gt;F(z) = \tfrac12 a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty (a_n-ib_n)z^n&lt;/math&gt;

along the [[unit circle]] with &lt;math&gt;z=e^{i\theta}&lt;/math&gt;.  The imaginary part of ''F''(''z'') is called the '''conjugate series''' of ''f'', and is denoted

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}(\theta) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(a_n\sin n\theta - b_n\cos n\theta\right).&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2194">In [[commutative algebra]], the '''constructible topology''' on the [[spectrum of a ring|spectrum]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec}(A)&lt;/math&gt; of a [[commutative ring]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a [[topology]] where each [[closed set]] is the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec} (B)&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec}(A)&lt;/math&gt; for some [[Algebra (ring theory)|algebra]] ''B'' over ''A''. An important feature of this construction is that the map &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec}(B) \to \operatorname{Spec}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[closed map]] with respect to the constructible topology.

With respect to this topology, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[compact set#Definition|compact]],&lt;ref&gt;Some authors prefer the term ''quasicompact'' here.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], and [[totally disconnected space|totally disconnected]] [[topological space]]. In general the constructible topology is a [[finer topology]] than the [[Zariski topology]], but the two topologies will coincide if and only if &lt;math&gt;A / \operatorname{nil}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[von Neumann regular ring]], where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{nil}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[nilradical of a ring|nilradical]]  of ''A''.

Despite the terminology being similar, the constructible topology is not the same as the set of all [[Constructible set (topology)|constructible sets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1337968/reconciling-two-different-definitions-of-constructible-sets/1964351#1964351|title=Reconciling two different definitions of constructible sets|website=math.stackexchange.com|access-date=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
In his autobiography, published in 1904, polymath [[Herbert Spencer]] eloquently describes his own near re-invention of Nicholson's cyclograph while working as a [[civil engineer]] for the [[Birmingham and Gloucester Railway]].
  {{quote
  |text=During the latter part of 1839 the preparations of plans for crossings and sidings at various stations was put into my hands. A device for saving trouble was one of the consequences. Curves of very large radius had to be drawn; and, finding a [[beam-compass]] of adequate length difficult to manage, I bethought me of an instrumental application of the geometrical truth that angles in the same segment of a circle are equal to one another. An obvious implication is that if an angle be made rigid, and its arms be obliged to move through the two points terminating the segment, the apex of the angle must describe a circle. In pursuance of this idea I had made an instrument hinged like a foot-rule, but capable of having its hinge screwed tight in any position, and carrying a pen or pencil. Two needles thrust into the paper at the desired points, being pressed against by the arms of the instrument, as it was moved from side to side, its pen or pencil described the arc of a circle. When about to publish a description of this appliance, I discovered that it had been already devised, and was known as Nicholson’s Cyclograph.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2522">'''Diocles''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Διοκλῆς}}; c. 240 BC – c. 180 BC) was a [[Hellenistic Greece|Greek]] [[mathematician]] and [[geometer]].

== Life and work ==
Although little is known about the life of Diocles, it is known that he was a contemporary of [[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonius]] and that he flourished sometime around the end of the 3rd century BC and the beginning of the 2nd century BC. 

Diocles is thought to be the first person to prove the focal property of the [[parabola]]. His name is associated with the geometric [[curve]] called the [[Cissoid of Diocles]], which was used by Diocles to solve the problem of [[doubling the cube]]. The curve was alluded to by [[Proclus]] in his commentary on [[Euclid]] and attributed to Diocles by [[Geminus]] as early as the beginning of the 1st century.

Fragments of a work by Diocles entitled ''On burning mirrors'' were preserved by [[Eutocius]] in his commentary of [[Archimedes]]' ''On the Sphere and the Cylinder''. Historically, ''On burning mirrors'' had a large influence on Arabic mathematicians, particularly on [[Alhazen|al-Haytham]], the 11th-century polymath of Cairo whom Europeans knew as "Alhazen". The treatise contains sixteen propositions that are proved by [[conic sections]]. One of the fragments contains propositions seven and eight, which is a solution to the problem of dividing a sphere by a plane so that the resulting two volumes are in a given ratio. Proposition ten gives a solution to the problem of doubling the cube. This is equivalent to solving a certain [[cubic equation]]. Another fragment contains propositions eleven and twelve, which use the cissoid to solve the problem of finding two mean proportionals in between two magnitudes. Since this treatise covers more topics than just [[Burning glass|burning mirrors]], it may be the case that ''On burning mirrors'' is the aggregate of three shorter works by Diocles.&lt;ref&gt;G. J. Toomer&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6585">[[Image:Edge contraction with multiple edges.svg|280px|thumb|right|Contracting the edge between the indicated vertices.]]

In [[graph theory]], an '''edge contraction''' is an [[Graph operations|operation]] which removes an edge from a graph while simultaneously merging the two vertices that it previously joined.  Edge contraction is a fundamental operation in the theory of [[graph minor]]s. '''Vertex identification''' is a less restrictive form of this operation.

== Definition ==
The '''edge contraction''' operation occurs relative to a particular edge, ''e''. The edge ''e'' is removed and its two incident vertices, ''u'' and ''v'', are merged into a new vertex ''w'', where the edges incident to ''w'' each correspond to an edge incident to either ''u'' or ''v''. More generally, the operation may be performed on a set of edges by contracting each edge (in any order).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gross|Yellen|1998|loc=p. 264}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Image:Edge contraction.svg|280px|thumb|right|Contracting an edge without creating multiple edges.]]

As defined below, an edge contraction operation may result in a graph with [[multiple edge]]s even if the original graph was a [[simple graph]].&lt;ref&gt;Also, [[loop (graph theory)|loops]] may arise when the graph started with multiple edges or, even if the graph was simple, from the repeated application of edge contraction.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some authors&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rosen|2011|loc=p. 664}}&lt;/ref&gt; disallow the creation of multiple edges, so that edge contractions performed on simple graphs always produce simple graphs.

===Formal definition===
Let '''G'''=('''V''','''E''') be a graph (''or [[directed graph]]'') containing an edge ''e''=(''u'',''v'') with ''u''≠''v''. Let ''f'' be a function which maps every vertex in '''V'''\{''u'',''v''} to itself, and otherwise, maps it to a new vertex ''w''.
The contraction of ''e'' results in a new graph '''G&amp;prime;'''=('''V&amp;prime;''','''E&amp;prime;'''), where '''V&amp;prime;'''=('''V'''\{''u'',''v''})∪{''w''}, '''E&amp;prime;'''='''E'''\{''e''}, and for every ''x''∈'''V''', ''x&amp;prime;''=''f''(''x'')∈'''V&amp;prime;''' is incident to an edge ''e&amp;prime;''∈'''E&amp;prime;''' if and only if, the corresponding edge, ''e''∈'''E''' is incident to ''x'' in '''G'''.

===Vertex identification===
'''Vertex identification''' (sometimes called '''vertex contraction''') removes the restriction that the ''contraction'' must occur over vertices sharing an incident edge. (Thus, edge contraction is a special case of vertex identification.) The operation may occur on any pair (or subset) of vertices in the graph. Edges between two ''contracting'' vertices are sometimes removed. If v and v' are vertices of distinct components of G, then we can create a new graph G' by identifying v and v' in G as a new vertex '''''v''''' in G'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oxley|1992|loc=pp. 147-148}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, given a [[partition of a set|partition]] of the vertex set, one can identify vertices in the partition; the resulting graph is known as a [[quotient graph]].

===Vertex cleaving===
'''Vertex cleaving''' which is the same as vertex splitting, means one vertex is being split into two, where these two new vertices are adjacent to the vertices that the original vertex was adjacent to. This is the reverse operation of vertex identification.

===Path contraction===
'''Path contraction''' occurs upon the set of edges in a [[Path (graph theory)|path]] that ''contract'' to form a single edge between the endpoints of the path. Edges incident to vertices along the path are either eliminated, or arbitrarily (or systematically) connected to one of the endpoints.

===Twisting===
Given two disjoint graphs G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; contains vertices u&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contains vertices u&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Suppose we can obtain the graph G by identifying the vertices u&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and u&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the vertex u of G and identifying the vertices v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the vertex v of G. In a ''twisting'' G' of G with respect to the vertex set {u, v}, we identify, instead, u&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; with v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; with u&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oxley|1992|loc=p. 148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

Both edge and vertex contraction techniques are valuable in [[proof by induction]] on the number of vertices or edges in a graph, where it can be assumed that a property holds for all smaller graphs and this can be used to prove the property for the larger graph.

Edge contraction is used in the recursive formula for the number of spanning trees of an arbitrary connected graph,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gross|Yellen|1998|loc=p. 264}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the recurrence formula for the [[chromatic polynomial]] of a simple graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|2001|loc=p. 221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contractions are also useful in structures where we wish to simplify a graph by identifying vertices that represent essentially equivalent entities. One of the most common examples is the reduction of a general [[directed graph]] to an [[acyclic directed graph]] by contracting all of the vertices in each [[strongly connected component]]. If the relation described by the graph is [[transitive relation|transitive]], no information is lost as long as we label each vertex with the set of labels of the vertices that were contracted to form it.

Another example is the coalescing performed in [[global graph coloring register allocation]], where vertices are contracted (where it is safe) in order to eliminate move operations between distinct variables.

Edge contraction is used in 3D modelling packages (either manually, or through some feature of the modelling software) to consistently reduce vertex count, aiding in the creation of low-polygon models.

'''Electrical capacitance tomography''' ('''ECT''') is a method for determination of the dielectric [[permittivity]] distribution in the interior of an object from external capacitance measurements. It is a close relative of [[electrical impedance tomography]]&lt;ref&gt;M Soleimani, W R B Lionheart, Nonlinear image reconstruction in electrical capacitance tomography using experimental data, Meas. Sci. Technol., 16, 2005, pp 1987–1996 
&lt;/ref&gt; and is proposed as a method for industrial process monitoring, although it has yet to see widespread use. Potential applications include the measurement of flow of fluids in pipes&lt;ref&gt;Jaworski AJ and Dyakowski T, Application of electrical capacitance tomography for measurement of gas–solid flow characteristics in a pneumatic conveying system, Measurement Science and Technology, 12, 2001, pp 1109–19
&lt;/ref&gt; and measurement of the concentration of one fluid in another, or the distribution of a solid in a fluid. 

Although capacitance sensing methods were in widespread use the idea of using capacitance measurement to form images is attributed to [[Maurice Beck]] and co-workers at [[UMIST]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;S M Huang, A Plaskowski, C G Xie and M S Beck, Capacitance-based tomographic flow imaging system, Electronics Letters, 24 (7), 1988, pp 418–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although usually called [[tomography]], the technique differs from conventional tomographic methods, in which high resolution images are formed of slices of a material. The measurement electrodes, which are metallic plates, must be sufficiently large to give a measureable change in capacitance. This means that very few electrodes are used and eight or twelve electrodes is common. An N-electrode system can only provide N(N&amp;minus;1)/2 independent measurements. This means that the technique is limited to producing very low resolution images of approximate slices. However, ECT is fast, and relatively inexpensive.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26276">In [[differential topology]], an '''exotic sphere''' is a [[differentiable manifold]] ''M'' that is [[homeomorphic]] but not [[diffeomorphic]] to the standard Euclidean [[n-sphere]]. That is, ''M'' is a sphere from the point of view of all its topological properties, but carrying a [[smooth structure]] that is not the familiar one (hence the name "exotic").

The first exotic spheres were constructed by {{harvs|authorlink=John Milnor|first=John|last=Milnor|year=1956|txt=yes}} in  dimension &lt;math&gt;n = 7&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;S^3&lt;/math&gt;-[[Fiber bundle|bundles]] over &lt;math&gt;S^4&lt;/math&gt;. He showed that there are at least 7 differentiable structures on the 7-sphere. In any dimension {{harvtxt|Milnor|1959}} showed that the diffeomorphism classes of oriented exotic spheres form the non-trivial elements of an abelian [[monoid]] under connected sum, which is a [[Finite group|finite]] [[abelian group]] if the dimension is not 4. The classification of exotic spheres by {{harvs |authorlink1=Michel Kervaire |first1=Michel |last1=Kervaire |last2=Milnor |year=1963 |txt=yes}} showed that the [[orientability|oriented]] exotic 7-spheres are the non-trivial elements of a [[cyclic group]] of order 28 under the operation of [[connected sum]].

==Introduction==
The unit ''n''-sphere, &lt;math&gt;S^n&lt;/math&gt;, is the set of all [[tuple|(''n''+1)-tuples]] &lt;math&gt;(x_1, x_2, \ldots x_{n+1})&lt;/math&gt; of real numbers, such that the sum &lt;math&gt;x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \ldots + x_{n+1}^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;. (&lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; is a circle; &lt;math&gt;S^2&lt;/math&gt; is the surface of an ordinary ball of radius one in 3 dimensions.) Topologists consider a space, ''X'', to be an ''n''-sphere if every point in ''X'' can be assigned to exactly one point in the unit ''n''-sphere in a [[continuous function|continuous]] way, which means that sufficiently nearby points in ''X'' get assigned to nearby points in ''S''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; and vice versa. For example, a point ''x'' on an ''n''-sphere of radius ''r'' can be matched with a point on the unit ''n''-sphere by adjusting its distance from the origin by &lt;math&gt;1/r&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[differential topology]], a more stringent condition is added, that the functions matching points in ''X'' with points in &lt;math&gt;S^n&lt;/math&gt; should be [[smooth function|smooth]], that is they should have [[derivative]]s of all orders everywhere. To calculate derivatives, one needs to have local coordinate systems defined consistently in ''X''. Mathematicians were surprised in 1956 when Milnor showed that consistent coordinate systems could be set up on the 7-sphere in two different ways that were equivalent in the continuous sense, but not in the differentiable sense. Milnor and others set about trying to discover how many such exotic spheres could exist in each dimension and to understand how they relate to each other. No exotic structures are possible on the 1-, 2-, 3-, 5-, 6- or 12-spheres. Some higher-dimensional spheres have only two possible differentiable structures, others have thousands. Whether exotic 4-spheres exist, and if so how many, is an unsolved problem.

==Classification==
The monoid of [[smooth structure]]s on ''n''-spheres is the collection of oriented smooth ''n''-manifolds which are homeomorphic to the ''n''-sphere, taken up to orientation-preserving diffeomorphism.  The monoid operation is the [[connected sum]]. Provided &lt;math&gt;n\ne  4&lt;/math&gt;,  this monoid is a group and is isomorphic to the group &lt;math&gt;\Theta_n&lt;/math&gt;  of [[H-cobordism|''h''-cobordism]] classes of oriented [[homotopy sphere|homotopy ''n''-spheres]], which is finite and abelian. In dimension 4 almost nothing is known about the monoid of smooth spheres, beyond the facts that it is finite or countably infinite, and abelian, though it is suspected to be infinite; see the section on [[Exotic sphere#4-dimensional exotic spheres and Gluck twists|Gluck twist]]s. All homotopy ''n''-spheres are homeomorphic to the ''n''-sphere by the generalized [[Poincaré conjecture]], proved by [[Stephen Smale]] in dimensions bigger than 4, [[Michael Freedman]] in dimension 4, and [[Grigori Perelman]] in dimension 3. In dimension 3, [[Edwin E. Moise]] proved that every topological manifold has an essentially unique smooth structure (see [[Moise's theorem]]), so the monoid of smooth structures on the 3-sphere is trivial.

=== Parallelizable manifolds===
The group &lt;math&gt;\Theta_n&lt;/math&gt;  has a cyclic subgroup

:&lt;math&gt;bP_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;

represented by ''n''-spheres that bound [[parallelizable manifold]]s. The structures of &lt;math&gt;bP_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; and the quotient

:&lt;math&gt;\Theta_n/bP_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;

are described separately in the paper {{harvs|authorlink1=Michel Kervaire|last1=Kervaire|last2=Milnor|authorlink2=John Milnor|year=1963}}, which was influential in the development of [[surgery theory]]. In fact, these calculations can be formulated in a modern language in terms of the [[surgery exact sequence]] as indicated [[surgery exact sequence#Examples|here]].

The group &lt;math&gt;bP_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; is a cyclic group, and is trivial or order 2 except in case &lt;math&gt;n = 4k+3&lt;/math&gt;, in which case it can be large, with its order related to the [[Bernoulli number]]s. It is trivial if ''n'' is even. If ''n'' is 1 mod 4 it has order 1 or 2; in particular it has order 1 if ''n'' is 1, 5,  13,  29, or 61, and {{harvs|txt|first=William|last=Browder|authorlink=William Browder (mathematician)|year=1969}} proved that it has order 2 if {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 1 mod 4}} is not of the form {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; – 3}}. It follows from the now almost completely resolved [[Kervaire invariant]] problem that it has order 2 for all ''n'' bigger than 125; the case {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 125}} is still open.
The order of ''bP''&lt;sub&gt;4''k''&lt;/sub&gt; for {{nowrap|''k'' ≥ 2}} is

:&lt;math&gt;2^{2k-2}(2^{2k-1}-1)B \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''B'' is the numerator of {{abs|4''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''k''&lt;/sub&gt;/''k''}}, and ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[Bernoulli number]]. (The formula in the topological literature differs slightly because topologists use a different convention for naming Bernoulli numbers; this article uses the number theorists' convention.)

===Map between quotients===
The quotient group Θ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;/''bP''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; has a description in terms of [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]] modulo the image of the [[J-homomorphism]]; it is either equal to the quotient or index 2. More precisely there is an injective map
:&lt;math&gt;\Theta_n/bP_{n+1}\to \pi_n^S/J\,&lt;/math&gt;
where π&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt; is the ''n''th stable homotopy group of spheres, and ''J'' is the image of the ''J''-homomorphism. As with ''bP''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;, the image of ''J'' is a cyclic group, and is trivial or order 2 except in case &lt;math&gt;n = 4k+3,&lt;/math&gt; in which case it can be large, with its order related to the [[Bernoulli number]]s. The quotient group &lt;math&gt;\pi_n^S/J\,&lt;/math&gt; is the "hard" part of the stable homotopy groups of spheres, and accordingly &lt;math&gt;\Theta_n/bP_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; is the hard part of the exotic spheres, but almost completely reduces to computing homotopy groups of spheres. The map is either an isomorphism (the image is the whole group), or an injective map with [[Index of a subgroup|index]] 2. The latter is the case if and only if there exists an ''n''-dimensional framed manifold with [[Kervaire invariant]] 1, which is known as the [[Kervaire invariant problem]]. Thus a factor of 2 in the classification of exotic spheres depends on the Kervaire invariant problem.

{{as of|2012}}, the Kervaire invariant problem is almost completely solved, with only the case {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 126}} remaining open; see that article for details. This is primarily the work of {{harvtxt|Browder|1969}}, which proved that such manifolds only existed in dimension {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt; − 2}}, and {{harvtxt|Hill|Hopkins|Ravenel|2016}}, which proved that there were no such manifolds for dimension {{nowrap|1=254 = 2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; − 2}} and above. Manifolds with Kervaire invariant 1 have been constructed in dimension 2, 6, 14, 30, and 62, but dimension 126 is open, with no manifold being either constructed or disproven.

===Order of Θ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;===
The order of the group Θ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is given in this table {{OEIS|id=A001676}} from {{harv|Kervaire|Milnor|1963}} (except that the entry for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 19}} is wrong by a factor of 2 in their paper; see the correction in volume III p.&amp;nbsp;97 of Milnor's collected works).

Further entries in this table can be computed from the information above together with the table of [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]].

==Explicit examples of exotic spheres==

|quote=  When I came upon such an example in the mid-50s, I was very puzzled and didn't know what to make of it. At first, I thought I'd found a counterexample to the generalized Poincaré conjecture in dimension seven. But careful study showed that the manifold really was homeomorphic to ''S''&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus, there exists a differentiable structure on ''S''&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; not diffeomorphic to the standard one.
|source={{harvs|txt|first=John|last=Milnor|year=2009|loc=p.12}}
}}

One of the first examples of an exotic sphere found by {{harvtxt|Milnor|1956|loc=section 3}} was the following:  Take two copies of [[Ball (mathematics)|''B''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;]]×''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, each with [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;×''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and glue them together by identifying (''a'',''b'') in the boundary with (''a'', ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''ba''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;), (where we identify each ''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; with the group of unit [[quaternion]]s). The resulting manifold has a natural smooth structure and is homeomorphic to ''S''&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, but is not diffeomorphic to ''S''&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;. Milnor showed that it is not the boundary of any smooth 8-manifold with vanishing 4th Betti number, and has no orientation-reversing diffeomorphism to itself; either of these properties implies that it is not a standard 7-sphere. Milnor showed that this manifold has a [[Morse function]] with just two [[critical point (mathematics)|critical points]], both non-degenerate, which implies that it is topologically a sphere.

As shown by {{harvs|txt=yes|first=Egbert |last=Brieskorn|year=1966|year2=1966b}} (see also {{harv|Hirzebruch|Mayer|1968}}) the intersection of the [[complex manifold]] of points in '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; satisfying
:&lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^3 + e^{6k-1} = 0\ &lt;/math&gt;
with a small sphere around the origin for ''k'' = 1, 2, ..., 28 gives all 28 possible smooth structures on the oriented 7-sphere. Similar manifolds are called [[Brieskorn sphere]]s.

==Twisted spheres==
Given an (orientation-preserving) diffeomorphism {{nowrap|''f'' : ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt; → ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, gluing the boundaries of two copies of the standard disk ''D''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; together by ''f'' yields a manifold called a ''twisted sphere'' (with ''twist'' ''f''). It is homotopy equivalent to the standard ''n''-sphere because the gluing map is homotopic to the identity (being an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism, hence degree 1), but not in general diffeomorphic to the standard sphere. {{harv|Milnor|1959b}}
Setting &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_n&lt;/math&gt; to be the group of twisted ''n''-spheres (under connect sum), one obtains the exact sequence
:&lt;math&gt;\pi_0\,\text{Diff}^+(D^n) \to \pi_0\,\text{Diff}^+(S^{n-1}) \to \Gamma_n \to 0.&lt;/math&gt;

For {{nowrap|''n'' &amp;gt; 5}}, every exotic ''n''-sphere is diffeomorphic to a twisted sphere, a result proven by [[Stephen Smale]] which can be seen as a consequence of the [[H-cobordism#Precise statement of the h-cobordism theorem|''h''-cobordism theorem]]. (In contrast, in the [[Piecewise linear manifold|piecewise linear]] setting the left-most map is onto via [[Alexander Trick#Radial extension|radial extension]]: every piecewise-linear-twisted sphere is standard.) The group Γ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of twisted spheres is always isomorphic to the group Θ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. The notations are different because it was not known at first that they were the same for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3 or 4}}; for example, the case {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}} is equivalent to the [[Poincaré conjecture]].

In 1970 Jean Cerf proved the [[pseudoisotopy theorem]] which implies that &lt;math&gt;\pi_0\,\text{Diff}^+(D^n)&lt;/math&gt; is the trivial group provided &lt;math&gt;n \geq 6&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_n \simeq \pi_0\,\text{Diff}^+(S^{n-1})&lt;/math&gt; provided &lt;math&gt;n \geq 6&lt;/math&gt;.

==Applications==
If ''M'' is a [[piecewise linear manifold]] then the problem of finding the compatible smooth structures on ''M'' depends on knowledge of the groups {{nowrap|1=Γ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; = Θ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. More precisely, the obstructions to the existence of any smooth structure lie in the groups {{nowrap|H&lt;sub&gt;''k+1''&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'', Γ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} for various values of ''k'', while if such a smooth structure exists then all such smooth structures can be  classified using the groups {{nowrap|H&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'', Γ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.
In particular the groups Γ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; vanish if {{nowrap|''k'' &amp;lt; 7}}, so all PL manifolds of dimension at most 7 have a smooth structure, which is essentially unique if the manifold has dimension at most 6.

The following finite abelian groups are essentially the same:
*The group Θ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of h-cobordism classes of oriented homotopy ''n''-spheres.
*The group  of h-cobordism classes of oriented ''n''-spheres.
*The group  Γ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of twisted oriented ''n''-spheres.
*The homotopy group π&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(PL/DIFF)
*If {{nowrap|''n'' ≠ 3}}, the homotopy π&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(TOP/DIFF) (if {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}} this group has order 2; see [[Kirby–Siebenmann invariant]]).
*The group of smooth structures of an oriented PL ''n''-sphere.
*If {{nowrap|''n'' ≠ 4}}, the group of smooth structures of an oriented topological ''n''-sphere.
*If {{nowrap|''n'' &amp;ne; 5}}, the group of components of the group of all orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

==4-dimensional exotic spheres and Gluck twists==
In 4 dimensions it is not known whether there are any exotic smooth structures on the 4-sphere. The statement that they do not exist is known as the "smooth Poincaré conjecture", and is discussed by {{harvs|txt | last1=Freedman | first1=Michael | authorlink1=Michael Freedman| last2=Gompf | first2=Robert | authorlink2=Robert Gompf| last3=Morrison | first3=Scott | last4=Walker | first4=Kevin | year=2010}} who say that it is believed to be false.

Some candidates proposed for exotic 4-spheres are the Cappell–Shaneson spheres ({{harvs|txt|last1=Cappell|first1=Sylvain|authorlink1=Sylvain Cappell|last2=Shaneson|first2=Julius|authorlink2=Julius Shaneson|year=1976}}) and those derived by '''Gluck twists''' {{harv|Gluck|1962}}. Gluck twist spheres are constructed by cutting out a tubular neighborhood of a 2-sphere ''S'' in ''S''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and gluing it back in using a diffeomorphism of its boundary ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;×''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The result is always homeomorphic to ''S''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. Many cases over the years were ruled out as possible counterexamples to the smooth 4 dimensional Poincaré conjecture. For example, {{harvs|txt|last=Gordon|first=Cameron|authorlink=Cameron Gordon (mathematician)| year=1976}}, {{harvs|txt|last=Montesinos|first=José|year=1983}}, {{harvs|txt|last=Plotnick|first=Steven P. |year=1984}}, {{harvtxt|Gompf|1991}}, {{harvtxt|Habiro|Marumoto|Yamada|2000}}, {{harvs|txt|last=Akbulut|first=Selman|authorlink=Selman Akbulut| year=2010}}, {{harvtxt|Gompf|2010}}, {{harvtxt|Kim | Yamada|2017}}.

In mathematics, the '''Hessian matrix''' or '''Hessian''' is a [[square matrix]] of second-order [[partial derivative]]s of a scalar-valued [[function (mathematics)|function]], or [[scalar field]]. It describes the local curvature of a function of many variables. The Hessian matrix was developed in the 19th century by the German mathematician [[Otto Hesse|Ludwig Otto Hesse]] and later named after him. Hesse originally used the term "functional determinants".

== Definitions and properties ==

Suppose {{math|''f'' : ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → ℝ}} is a function taking as input a vector {{math|'''x''' ∈ ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and outputting a scalar {{math|''f''('''x''') ∈ ℝ}}; if all second [[partial derivative]]s of {{math|''f''}} exist and are continuous over the domain of the function, then the Hessian matrix {{math|'''H'''}} of {{math|''f''}} is a square {{math|''n''×''n''}} matrix, usually defined and arranged as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf H = \begin{bmatrix}
  \dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1^2} &amp; \dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1\,\partial x_2} &amp; \cdots &amp; \dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1\,\partial x_n} \\[2.2ex]
  \dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_2\,\partial x_1} &amp; \dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_2^2} &amp; \cdots &amp; \dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_2\,\partial x_n} \\[2.2ex]
  \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\[2.2ex]
  \dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_n\,\partial x_1} &amp; \dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_n\,\partial x_2} &amp; \cdots &amp; \dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_n^2}
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

or, by stating an equation for the coefficients using indices i and j:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf H_{i,j} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[determinant]] of the above matrix is also sometimes referred to as the Hessian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Binmore |first1=Ken |authorlink1=Kenneth Binmore |last2=Davies |first2=Joan |year=2007 |title=Calculus Concepts and Methods |oclc=717598615 |isbn=978-0-521-77541-0 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=190 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hessian matrix can be considered related to the [[Jacobian matrix]] by {{math|'''H'''(''f''('''x''')) {{=}} '''J'''(∇''f''('''x'''))&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

The '''mixed derivatives''' of ''f'' are the entries off the [[main diagonal]] in the Hessian. Assuming that they are continuous, the order of differentiation does not matter ([[Symmetry of second derivatives#Schwarz's theorem|Schwarz's theorem]]). For example,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\partial}{\partial x_i} \left(\frac {\partial f }{\partial x_j} \right) =
       \frac {\partial}{\partial x_j} \left(\frac {\partial f }{\partial x_i} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

In a formal statement: if the second derivatives of {{math|''f''}} are all [[continuous function|continuous]] in a [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] {{math|''D''}}, then the Hessian of {{math|''f''}} is a [[symmetric matrix]] throughout {{math|''D''}}; see [[symmetry of second derivatives]].

== Applications ==

=== Second derivative test ===
{{Main|Second partial derivative test}}

The Hessian matrix of a [[convex function]] is [[positive semi-definite matrix|positive semi-definite]]. Refining this property allows us to test if a [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]] {{math|''x''}} is a local maximum, local minimum, or a saddle point, as follows:

If the Hessian is [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite]] at {{math|''x''}}, then {{math|''f''}} attains an isolated local minimum at {{math|''x''}}. If the Hessian is [[Positive-definite matrix#Negative-definite, semidefinite and indefinite matrices|negative definite]] at {{math|''x''}}, then {{math|''f''}} attains an isolated local maximum at {{math|''x''}}. If the Hessian has both positive and negative [[eigenvalue]]s then {{math|''x''}} is a [[saddle point]] for {{math|''f''}}. Otherwise the test is inconclusive. This implies that, at a local minimum (respectively, a local maximum), the Hessian is positive-semi-definite (respectively, negative semi-definite).

Note that for positive semidefinite and negative semidefinite Hessians the test is inconclusive (a critical point where the Hessian is semidefinite but not definite may be a local extremum or a saddle point). However, more can be said from the point of view of [[Morse theory]].

The [[second derivative test]] for functions of one and two variables is simple. In one variable, the Hessian contains just one second derivative; if it is positive then {{math|''x''}} is a local minimum, and if it is negative then {{math|''x''}} is a local maximum; if it is zero then the test is inconclusive. In two variables, the [[determinant]] can be used, because the determinant is the product of the eigenvalues. If it is positive then the eigenvalues are both positive, or both negative. If it is negative then the two eigenvalues have different signs. If it is zero, then the second derivative test is inconclusive.

Equivalently, the second-order conditions that are sufficient for a local minimum or maximum can be expressed in terms of the sequence of principal (upper-leftmost) [[minor (linear algebra)|minors]] (determinants of sub-matrices) of the Hessian; these conditions are a special case of those given in the next section for bordered Hessians for constrained optimization—the case in which the number of constraints is zero. Specifically, the sufficient condition for a minimum is that all of these principal minors be positive, while the sufficient condition for a maximum is that the minors alternate in sign with the 1×1 minor being negative.

=== Critical points ===

If the [[gradient]] (the vector of the partial derivatives) of a function {{math|''f''}} is zero at some point {{math|'''x'''}}, then {{math|''f''}} has a ''[[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]'' (or ''[[stationary point]]'') at {{math|'''x'''}}. The [[determinant]] of the Hessian at {{math|'''x'''}} is then called the [[discriminant]]. If this determinant is zero then {{math|'''x'''}} is called a ''degenerate critical point'' of {{math|''f''}}, or a ''non-Morse critical point'' of {{math|''f''}}. Otherwise it is non-degenerate, and called a ''Morse critical point'' of {{math|''f''}}.

The Hessian matrix plays an important role in [[Morse theory]] and [[catastrophe theory]], because its [[kernel of a matrix|kernel]] and [[eigenvalue]]s allow classification of the critical points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=geruGMKT9_UC&amp;pg=PA248|title=Advanced Calculus: A Geometric View|last=Callahan|first=James J.|date=2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4419-7332-0|page=248|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tcn3CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA178|title=Recent Developments in General Relativity|editor-last=Casciaro|editor-first=B.|editor-last2=Fortunato|editor-first2=D.|editor-last3=Francaviglia|editor-first3=M.|editor-last4=Masiello|editor-first4=A.|date=2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9788847021136|page=178|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Domenico P.

=== Use in optimization ===

Hessian matrices are used in large-scale [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]] problems within [[Newton's method in optimization|Newton]]-type methods because they are the coefficient of the quadratic term of a local [[Taylor expansion]] of a function. That is,

:&lt;math&gt;y=f(\mathbf{x} + \Delta\mathbf{x})\approx f(\mathbf{x}) + \nabla f(\mathbf{x})^\mathrm{T} \Delta\mathbf{x} + \frac{1}{2!} \Delta\mathbf{x}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{H}(\mathbf{x}) \Delta\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|∇''f''}} is the [[gradient]] {{math|({{sfrac|∂''f''|∂''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, ..., {{sfrac|∂''f''|∂''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}})}}. Computing and storing the full Hessian matrix takes {{math|[[Big O notation|Θ]](''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} memory, which is infeasible for high-dimensional functions such as the [[loss function]]s of [[artificial neural network|neural nets]], [[conditional random field]]s, and other [[statistical model]]s with large numbers of parameters. For such situations, [[truncated Newton method|truncated-Newton]] and [[quasi-Newton method|quasi-Newton]] algorithms have been developed. The latter family of algorithms use approximations to the Hessian; one of the most popular quasi-Newton algorithms is [[Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm|BFGS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nocedal |first1=Jorge |authorlink1=Jorge Nocedal |last2=Wright |first2=Stephen |year=2000 |title=Numerical Optimization |isbn=978-0-387-98793-4 |publisher=Springer Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such approximations may use the fact that an optimization algorithm uses the Hessian only as a [[linear operator]] {{math|'''H'''('''v''')}}, and proceed by first noticing that the Hessian also appears in the local expansion of the gradient:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla f (\mathbf{x} + \Delta\mathbf{x}) = \nabla f (\mathbf{x}) + \mathbf{H}(\mathbf{x})\Delta\mathbf{x} + \mathcal{O}(\|\Delta\mathbf{x}\|^2)&lt;/math&gt;

Letting {{math|Δ'''x''' {{=}} ''r'''''v'''}} for some scalar {{mvar|r}}, this gives

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{x})\Delta\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{H}(\mathbf{x})r\mathbf{v} = r\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{x})\mathbf{v} = \nabla f (\mathbf{x} + r\mathbf{v}) - \nabla f (\mathbf{x}) + \mathcal{O}(r^2),&lt;/math&gt;

i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{x})\mathbf{v} = \frac{1}{r} \Bigl[ \nabla f (\mathbf{x} + r\mathbf{v}) - \nabla f (\mathbf{x}) \Bigr] + \mathcal{O}(r)&lt;/math&gt;

so if the gradient is already computed, the approximate Hessian can be computed by a linear (in the size of the gradient) number of scalar operations. (While simple to program, this approximation scheme is not numerically stable since {{mvar|r}} has to be made small to prevent error due to the &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(r)&lt;/math&gt; term, but decreasing it loses precision in the first term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearlmutter |first=Barak A. |title=Fast exact multiplication by the Hessian |journal=Neural Computation |volume=6 |issue=1 |year=1994 |url=http://www.bcl.hamilton.ie/~barak/papers/nc-hessian.pdf |doi=10.1162/neco.1994.6.1.147 |pages=147–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

=== Other applications ===

The Hessian matrix is commonly used for expressing image processing operators in [[image processing]] and [[computer vision]] (see the [[Laplacian of Gaussian]] (LoG) blob detector, [[blob detection#The determinant of the Hessian|the determinant of Hessian (DoH) blob detector]] and [[scale space]]).

== Generalizations ==

=== Bordered Hessian ===

A '''bordered Hessian''' is used for the second-derivative test in certain constrained optimization problems. Given the function {{math|''f''}} considered previously, but adding a constraint function {{math|''g''}} such that {{math|''g''('''x''') {{=}} c}}, the bordered Hessian is the Hessian of the [[Lagrange multiplier|Lagrange function]] &lt;math&gt;\Lambda(\mathbf{x},\lambda)=f(\mathbf{x})+\lambda[g(\mathbf{x})-c]&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Econ 500: Quantitative Methods in Economic Analysis I |date=October 7, 2004 |first=Arne |last=Hallam |url=http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/classes/econ500/hallam/documents/opt_con_gen_000.pdf |work=Iowa State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf H(\Lambda) =
\begin{bmatrix}
\dfrac{\partial^2 \Lambda}{\partial \lambda^2} &amp; \dfrac{\partial^2 \Lambda}{\partial \lambda \partial \mathbf x} \\
\left (\dfrac{\partial^2 \Lambda}{\partial \lambda \partial \mathbf x}\right)^{\mathsf{T}} &amp; \dfrac{\partial^2 \Lambda}{\partial \mathbf x^2}
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; \dfrac{\partial g}{\partial x_1} &amp; \dfrac{\partial g}{\partial x_2} &amp; \cdots &amp; \dfrac{\partial g}{\partial x_n} \\[2.2ex]
\dfrac{\partial g}{\partial x_1} &amp; \dfrac{\partial^2 \Lambda}{\partial x_1^2} &amp; \dfrac{\partial^2 \Lambda}{\partial x_1\,\partial x_2} &amp; \cdots &amp; \dfrac{\partial^2 \Lambda}{\partial x_1\,\partial x_n} \\[2.2ex]
\dfrac{\partial g}{\partial x_2} &amp; \dfrac{\partial^2 \Lambda}{\partial x_2\,\partial x_1} &amp; \dfrac{\partial^2 \Lambda}{\partial x_2^2} &amp; \cdots &amp; \dfrac{\partial^2 \Lambda}{\partial x_2\,\partial x_n} \\[2.2ex]
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\[2.2ex]
\dfrac{\partial g}{\partial x_n} &amp; \dfrac{\partial^2 \Lambda}{\partial x_n\,\partial x_1} &amp; \dfrac{\partial^2 \Lambda}{\partial x_n\,\partial x_2} &amp; \cdots &amp; \dfrac{\partial^2 \Lambda}{\partial x_n^2}
\end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; \dfrac{\partial g}{\partial \mathbf x} \\
\left (\dfrac{\partial g}{\partial \mathbf x}\right)^{\mathsf{T}} &amp; \dfrac{\partial^2 \Lambda}{\partial \mathbf x^2}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If there are, say, ''m'' constraints then the zero in the upper-left corner is an ''m'' × ''m'' block of zeroes, and there are ''m'' border rows at the top and ''m'' border columns at the left.

The above rules stating that extrema are characterized (among critical points with a non-singular Hessian) by a positive-definite or negative-definite Hessian cannot apply here since a bordered Hessian can neither be negative-definite nor positive-definite, as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}^{\mathsf{T}} \mathbf{H} \mathbf{z} = 0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}&lt;/math&gt; is any vector whose sole non-zero entry is its first.

The second derivative test consists here of sign restrictions of the determinants of a certain set of ''n – m'' submatrices of the bordered Hessian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Neudecker |first1=Heinz |last2=Magnus |first2=Jan R. |title=Matrix Differential Calculus with Applications in Statistics and Econometrics |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |location=New York |isbn=0-471-91516-5 |year=1988 |page=136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intuitively, one can think of the ''m'' constraints as reducing the problem to one with ''n – m'' free variables. (For example, the maximization of {{math|''f''(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}} subject to the constraint {{math|x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 1}} can be reduced to the maximization of {{math|''f''(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,1–x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;–x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} without constraint.)

Specifically, sign conditions are imposed on the sequence of leading principal minors (determinants of upper-left-justified sub-matrices) of the bordered Hessian, for which the first 2''m'' leading principal minors are neglected, the smallest minor consisting of the truncated first 2''m''+1 rows and columns, the next consisting of the truncated first 2''m''+2 rows and columns, and so on, with the last being the entire bordered Hessian; if 2''m''+1 is larger than n+m, then the smallest leading principal minor is the Hessian itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chiang |first=Alpha C. |title=Fundamental Methods of Mathematical Economics |location= |publisher=McGraw-Hill |edition=Third |year=1984 |page=386 |isbn=0-07-010813-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are thus ''n''–''m'' minors to consider, each evaluated at the specific point being considered as a [[candidate solution#Calculus|candidate maximum or minimum]]. A sufficient condition for a local ''maximum'' is that these minors alternate in sign with the smallest one having the sign of (–1)&lt;sup&gt;''m''+1&lt;/sup&gt;.  A sufficient condition for a local ''minimum'' is that all of these minors have the sign of (–1)&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;. (In the unconstrained case of ''m''=0 these conditions coincide with the conditions for the unbordered Hessian to be negative definite or positive definite respectively).

=== Vector-valued functions ===

If {{math|''f''}} is instead a [[vector field]] {{math|'''f''' : ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf f(\mathbf x) = (f_1(\mathbf x), f_2(\mathbf x), \dots, f_m(\mathbf x)),&lt;/math&gt;

then the collection of second partial derivatives is not a {{math|''n''×''n''}} matrix, but rather a third order [[tensor]]. This can be thought of as an array of {{math|''m''}} Hessian matrices, one for each component of {{math|'''f'''}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf H(\mathbf f) = (\mathbf H(f_1), \mathbf H(f_2), \dots, \mathbf H(f_m))&lt;/math&gt;
This tensor degenerates to the usual Hessian matrix when {{math|''m''}} = 1.

=== Generalization to the complex case ===

In the context of [[several complex variables]], the Hessian may be generalized.  Suppose &lt;math&gt;f\colon\mathbb{C}^n\longrightarrow\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;, and we write &lt;math&gt;f\left(z_1,\ldots,z_n\right)&lt;/math&gt;.  Then one may generalize the Hessian to &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial z_i\partial\overline{z_j}}&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the n-dimensional [[Cauchy-Riemann conditions]], then the complex Hessian matrix is identically zero.

=== Generalizations to Riemannian manifolds ===

Let &lt;math&gt;(M,g)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Riemannian manifold]] and &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; its [[Levi-Civita connection]]. Let &lt;math&gt;f:M \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be a smooth function. We may define the Hessian tensor
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \mbox{Hess}(f) \in \Gamma(T^*M \otimes T^*M) &lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Hess}(f):=\nabla \nabla f = \nabla df&lt;/math&gt;,

where we have taken advantage of the first covariant derivative of a function being the same as its ordinary derivative. Choosing local coordinates &lt;math&gt;\{x^i\}&lt;/math&gt; we obtain the local expression for the Hessian as

:&lt;math&gt; \mbox{Hess}(f)=\nabla_i\, \partial_j f \ dx^i \!\otimes\! dx^j = \left( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^i \partial x^j}-\Gamma_{ij}^k \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^k} \right) dx^i \otimes dx^j &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^k_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Christoffel symbols]] of the connection. Other equivalent forms for the Hessian are given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Hess}(f)(X,Y)= \langle \nabla_X \mbox{grad}f,Y \rangle &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Hess}(f)(X,Y)=X(Yf)-df(\nabla_XY)&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3479">In mathematics, an '''incidence poset''' or '''incidence order''' is a type of [[partially ordered set]] that represents the [[Incidence matrix|incidence relation]] between vertices and edges of an [[undirected graph]]. The incidence poset of a graph ''G'' has an element for each vertex or edge in ''G''; in this poset, there is an order relation ''x''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''y'' if and only if either ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y'' or ''x'' is a vertex, ''y'' is an edge, and ''x'' is an endpoint of ''y''.

==Example==
As an example, a [[zigzag poset]] or ''fence'' with an odd number of elements, with alternating order relations ''a''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''c''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''d''... is an incidence poset of a [[path graph]].

==Properties==
Every incidence poset of a non-empty graph has [[Antichain#Height and width|height]]&amp;nbsp;two. Its width equals the number of edges plus the number of acyclic connected components.

Incidence posets have been particularly studied with respect to their [[order dimension]], and its relation to the properties of the underlying graph. The incidence poset of a connected graph ''G'' has order dimension at most two if and only if ''G'' is a path graph, and has order dimension at most three if and only if ''G'' is at most planar ([[Schnyder's theorem]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Key clustering''', in [[cryptography]], is two different [[key (cryptography)|keys]] that generate the same [[ciphertext]] from the same [[plaintext]] by using the same [[cipher]] [[algorithm]]. A good cipher algorithm, using different keys on the same plaintext, should generate a different ciphertext irrespective of the key length.

If there is a plaintext P, two different keys K1 and K2, and an algorithm A, the two key generate ciphertexts C1 and C2 as follows:
     
P → A(K1) → C1

P → A(K2) → C2

Key clustering has occurred if C1 and C2 are the same, which should not occur.

==Importance==

If an attacker tries to break a cipher by a [[brute-force attack]], trying all possible keys until it finds the correct key, key clustering makes it easier to attack a particular cipher text. If there are ''n'' possible keys without any key clustering, the attacker needs to try an average of ''n''/2 keys to decrypt it and no more than ''n'' keys. If there are two keys that are clustered, the average number of keys is reduced to ''n''/4 and the maximum is ''n''-1 keys. If three keys cluster, the average attempt is only ''n''/6 attempts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3534">In [[point-set topology]], '''Kuratowski's closure-complement problem''' asks for the largest number of distinct sets obtainable by repeatedly applying the set operations of [[closure (topology)|closure]] and [[complement (set theory)|complement]] to a given starting subset of a [[topological space]].  The answer is 14.  This result was first published by [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]] in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

  | page = 57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proof==
Letting ''S'' denote an arbitrary subset of a topological space, write ''kS'' for the closure of ''S'', and ''cS'' for the complement of ''S''. The following three identities imply that no more than 14 distinct sets are obtainable:

(1) ''kkS'' = ''kS''. (The closure operation is [[idempotency|idempotent]].)

(2) ''ccS'' = ''S''. (The complement operation is an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]].)

(3) ''kckckckcS'' = ''kckcS''. (Or equivalently ''kckckckS'' = ''kckckckccS'' = ''kckS''. Using identity (2).)

The first two are trivial.  The third follows from the identity ''kikiS'' = ''kiS'' where ''iS'' is the [[interior (topology)|interior]] of ''S'' which is equal to the complement of the closure of the complement of ''S'', ''iS'' = ''ckcS''. (The operation ''ki'' = ''kckc'' is idempotent.)

A subset realizing the maximum of 14 is called a '''14-set'''.  The space of [[real numbers]] under the usual topology contains 14-sets.  Here is one example:
:&lt;math&gt;(0,1)\cup(1,2)\cup\{3\}\cup\bigl([4,5]\cap\Q\bigr),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;(1,2)&lt;/math&gt; denotes an [[Interval (mathematics)#Terminology|open interval]] and &lt;math&gt;[4,5]&lt;/math&gt; denotes a closed interval.

==Further results==
Despite its origin within the context of a topological space, Kuratowski's closure-complement problem is actually more [[algebra]]ic than topological.  A surprising abundance of closely related problems and results have appeared since 1960, many of which have little or nothing to do with point-set topology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

  | pages = 74–80
  | year = 1960
  | issn = 0028-9825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The closure-complement operations yield a [[monoid]] which can be used to classify topological spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/00927872.2016.1222401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Duality (mathematics)}}

In [[mathematics]], a '''duality''', generally speaking, translates concepts, theorems or mathematical structures into other concepts, theorems or structures, in a one-to-one fashion, often (but not always) by means of an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] operation: if the dual of ''A'' is ''B'', then the dual of ''B'' is ''A''.

A '''locally compact quantum group''' is a relatively new [[C*-algebra]]ic approach toward [[quantum group]]s that generalizes the [[Kac algebra]], [[compact quantum group|compact-quantum-group]] and [[Hopf algebra|Hopf-algebra]] approaches. Earlier attempts at a unifying definition of quantum groups using, for example, multiplicative unitaries have enjoyed some success but have also encountered several technical problems.

One of the main features distinguishing this new approach from its predecessors is the axiomatic existence of left and right invariant weights. This gives a [[noncommutative geometry|noncommutative]] analogue of left and right [[Haar measure|Haar measures]] on a locally compact Hausdorff group.

== Definitions ==
Before we can even begin to properly define a locally compact quantum group, we first need to define a number of preliminary concepts and also state a few theorems.

'''Definition (weight).''' Let &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; be a [[C*-algebra]], and let &lt;math&gt; A_{\geq 0} &lt;/math&gt; denote the set of [[C*-algebra#Self-adjoint elements|positive elements]] of &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;. A [[von Neumann algebra#Weights, states, and traces|'''weight''']] on &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is a function &lt;math&gt; \phi: A_{\geq 0} \to [0,\infty] &lt;/math&gt; such that
* &lt;math&gt; \phi(a_{1} + a_{2}) = \phi(a_{1}) + \phi(a_{2}) &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; a_{1},a_{2} \in A_{\geq 0} &lt;/math&gt;, and
* &lt;math&gt; \phi(r \cdot a) = r \cdot \phi(a) &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; r \in [0,\infty) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; a \in A_{\geq 0} &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Some notation for weights.''' Let &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt; be a weight on a C*-algebra &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;. We use the following notation:
* &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M}_{\phi}^{+} := \{ a \in A_{\geq 0} \mid \phi(a) &lt; \infty \} &lt;/math&gt;, which is called the set of all '''positive &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt;-integrable elements''' of &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{N}_{\phi} := \{ a \in A \mid \phi(a^{*} a) &lt; \infty \} &lt;/math&gt;, which is called the set of all '''&lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt;-square-integrable elements''' of &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M}_{\phi} := \text{Span} ~ \mathcal{M}_{\phi}^{+} = \mathcal{N}_{\phi}^{*} \mathcal{N}_{\phi} &lt;/math&gt;, which is called the set of all '''&lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt;-integrable''' elements of &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Types of weights.''' Let &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt; be a weight on a C*-algebra &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;.
* We say that &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt; is '''faithful''' if and only if &lt;math&gt; \phi(a) \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt; for each non-zero &lt;math&gt; a \in A_{\geq 0} &lt;/math&gt;.
* We say that &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt; is '''lower semi-continuous''' if and only if the set &lt;math&gt; \{ a \in A_{\geq 0} \mid \phi(a) \leq \lambda \} &lt;/math&gt; is a closed subset of &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt; \lambda \in [0,\infty] &lt;/math&gt;.
* We say that &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt; is '''densely defined''' if and only if &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M}_{\phi}^{+} &lt;/math&gt; is a dense subset of &lt;math&gt; A_{\geq 0} &lt;/math&gt;, or equivalently, if and only if either &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{N}_{\phi} &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M}_{\phi} &lt;/math&gt; is a dense subset of &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;.
* We say that &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt; is '''proper''' if and only if it is non-zero, lower semi-continuous and densely defined.

'''Definition (one-parameter group).''' Let &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; be a C*-algebra. A '''one-parameter group''' on &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is a family &lt;math&gt; \alpha = (\alpha_{t})_{t \in \mathbb{R}} &lt;/math&gt; of *-automorphisms of &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; that satisfies &lt;math&gt; \alpha_{s} \circ \alpha_{t} = \alpha_{s + t} &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; s,t \in \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;. We say that &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; is '''norm-continuous''' if and only if for every &lt;math&gt; a \in A &lt;/math&gt;, the mapping &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R} \to A &lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt; t \mapsto {\alpha_{t}}(a) &lt;/math&gt; is continuous.

'''Definition (analytic extension of a one-parameter group).''' Given a norm-continuous one-parameter group &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; on a C*-algebra &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;, we are going to define an [[analytic continuation|analytic extension]] of &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt;. For each &lt;math&gt; z \in \mathbb{C} &lt;/math&gt;, let
:&lt;math&gt; I(z) := \{ y \in \mathbb{C} \mid |\Im(y)| \leq |\Im(z)| \} &lt;/math&gt;,
which is a horizontal strip in the complex plane. We call a function &lt;math&gt; f: I(z) \to A &lt;/math&gt; '''norm-regular''' if and only if the following conditions hold:
* It is analytic on the interior of &lt;math&gt; I(z) &lt;/math&gt;, i.e., for each &lt;math&gt; y_{0} &lt;/math&gt; in the interior of &lt;math&gt; I(z) &lt;/math&gt;, the limit &lt;math&gt; \displaystyle \lim_{y \to y_{0}} \frac{f(y) - f(y_{0})}{y - y_{0}} &lt;/math&gt; exists with respect to the norm topology on &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;.
* It is norm-bounded on &lt;math&gt; I(z) &lt;/math&gt;.
* It is norm-continuous on &lt;math&gt; I(z) &lt;/math&gt;.
Suppose now that &lt;math&gt; z \in \mathbb{C} \setminus \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;, and let
:&lt;math&gt;
D_{z} := \{ a \in A \mid \text{There exists a norm-regular} ~ f: I(z) \to A ~ \text{such that} ~ f(t) = {\alpha_{t}}(a) ~ \text{for all} ~ t \in \mathbb{R} \}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Define &lt;math&gt; \alpha_{z}: D_{z} \to A &lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt; {\alpha_{z}}(a) := f(z) &lt;/math&gt;. The function &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; is uniquely determined (by the theory of complex-analytic functions), so &lt;math&gt; \alpha_{z} &lt;/math&gt; is well-defined indeed. The family &lt;math&gt; (\alpha_{z})_{z \in \mathbb{C}} &lt;/math&gt; is then called the '''analytic extension''' of &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem 1.''' The set &lt;math&gt; \cap_{z \in \mathbb{C}} D_{z} &lt;/math&gt;, called the set of '''analytic elements''' of &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;, is a dense subset of &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition (K.M.S. weight).''' Let &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; be a C*-algebra and &lt;math&gt; \phi: A_{\geq 0} \to [0,\infty] &lt;/math&gt; a weight on &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;. We say that &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt; is a '''K.M.S. weight''' ('K.M.S.' stands for 'Kubo-Martin-Schwinger') on &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt; is a ''proper weight'' on &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; and there exists a norm-continuous one-parameter group &lt;math&gt; (\sigma_{t})_{t \in \mathbb{R}} &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; such that
* &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt; is invariant under &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt; \phi \circ \sigma_{t} = \phi &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; t \in \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;, and
* for every &lt;math&gt; a \in \text{Dom}(\sigma_{i / 2}) &lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt; \phi(a^{*} a) = \phi(\sigma_{i / 2}(a) [\sigma_{i / 2}(a)]^{*}) &lt;/math&gt;.

We denote by &lt;math&gt;M(A)&lt;/math&gt; the multiplier algebra of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem 2.''' If &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt; are C*-algebras and &lt;math&gt; \pi: A \to M(B) &lt;/math&gt; is a non-degenerate *-homomorphism (i.e., &lt;math&gt; \pi[A] B &lt;/math&gt; is a dense subset of &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt;), then we can uniquely extend &lt;math&gt; \pi &lt;/math&gt; to a *-homomorphism &lt;math&gt; \overline{\pi}: M(A) \to M(B) &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem 3.''' If &lt;math&gt; \omega: A \to \mathbb{C} &lt;/math&gt; is a state (i.e., a positive linear functional of norm &lt;math&gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;) on &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;, then we can uniquely extend &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; to a state &lt;math&gt; \overline{\omega}: M(A) \to \mathbb{C} &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt; M(A) &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition (Locally compact quantum group).''' A (C*-algebraic) '''locally compact quantum group''' is an ordered pair &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{G} = (A,\Delta) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is a C*-algebra and &lt;math&gt; \Delta: A \to M(A \otimes A) &lt;/math&gt; is a ''non-degenerate'' *-homomorphism called the [[coalgebra|'''co-multiplication''']], that satisfies the following four conditions:
* The co-multiplication is co-associative, i.e., &lt;math&gt; \overline{\Delta \otimes \iota} \circ \Delta = \overline{\iota \otimes \Delta} \circ \Delta &lt;/math&gt;.
* The sets &lt;math&gt; \left\{ \overline{\omega \otimes \text{id}}(\Delta(a)) ~ \big| ~ \omega \in A^{*}, ~ a \in A \right\} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \left\{ \overline{\text{id} \otimes \omega}(\Delta(a)) ~ \big| ~ \omega \in A^{*}, ~ a \in A \right\} &lt;/math&gt; are linearly dense subsets of &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;.
* There exists a faithful K.M.S. weight &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; that is left-invariant, i.e., &lt;math&gt; \phi \! \left( \overline{\omega \otimes \text{id}}(\Delta(a)) \right) = \overline{\omega}(1_{M(A)}) \cdot \phi(a) &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; \omega \in A^{*} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; a \in \mathcal{M}_{\phi}^{+} &lt;/math&gt;.
* There exists a K.M.S. weight &lt;math&gt; \psi &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; that is right-invariant, i.e., &lt;math&gt; \psi \! \left( \overline{\text{id} \otimes \omega}(\Delta(a)) \right) = \overline{\omega}(1_{M(A)}) \cdot \psi(a) &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; \omega \in A^{*} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; a \in \mathcal{M}_{\phi}^{+} &lt;/math&gt;.

From the definition of a locally compact quantum group, it can be shown that the right-invariant K.M.S. weight &lt;math&gt; \psi &lt;/math&gt; is automatically faithful. Therefore, the faithfulness of &lt;math&gt; \psi &lt;/math&gt; is a redundant condition and does not need to be postulated.

== Duality ==
The category of locally compact quantum groups allows for a dual construction with which one can prove that the bi-dual of a locally compact quantum group is isomorphic to the original one. This result gives a far-reaching generalization of [[Pontryagin duality]] for locally compact Hausdorff abelian groups.

== Alternative formulations ==
The theory has an equivalent formulation in terms of [[von Neumann algebra]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12623">In [[mathematics]], especially in [[order theory]], a '''maximal element''' of a [[subset]] ''S'' of some [[partially ordered set]] (poset) is an element of ''S'' that is not smaller than any other element in ''S''. A '''minimal element''' of a subset ''S'' of some partially ordered set is defined [[duality (order theory)|dually]] as an element of ''S'' that is not greater than any other element in ''S''.

The notions of maximal and minimal elements are weaker than those of [[greatest element]] and least element which are also known, respectively, as maximum and minimum. The maximum of a subset ''S'' of a partially ordered set is an element of ''S'' which is greater than or equal to any other element of ''S'', and the minimum of ''S'' is again defined dually. While a partially ordered set can have at most one each maximum and minimum it may have multiple maximal and minimal elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A Discrete Transition to Advanced Mathematics|first1=Bettina|last1=Richmond|first2=Thomas|last2=Richmond|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=2009|isbn=978-0-8218-4789-3|page=181|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HucyKYx0_WwC&amp;pg=PA181}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Group Theory|first=William Raymond|last=Scott|edition=2nd|publisher=Dover|year=1987|isbn=978-0-486-65377-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kt4o5ZTwH4wC&amp;pg=PA22|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[totally ordered set]]s, the notions of maximal element and maximum coincide, and the notions of minimal element and minimum coincide.

As an example, in the collection

: ''S'' = {{''d'', ''o''}, {''d'', ''o'', ''g''}, {''g'', ''o'', ''a'', ''d''}, {''o'', ''a'', ''f''}}

ordered by [[inclusion (set theory)|containment]], the element {''d'', ''o''} is minimal as it contains no sets in the collection, the element {''g'', ''o'', ''a'', ''d''} is maximal as there are no sets in the collection which contain it, the element {''d'', ''o'', ''g''} is neither, and the element {''o'', ''a'', ''f''} is both minimal and maximal. By contrast, neither a maximum nor a minimum exists for ''S''.

[[Zorn's lemma]] states that every partially ordered set for which every totally ordered subset has an [[upper bound]] contains at least one maximal element. This lemma is equivalent to the [[well-ordering theorem]] and the [[axiom of choice]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and implies major results in other mathematical areas like the [[Hahn–Banach theorem]] and [[Tychonoff's theorem]], the existence of a [[Hamel basis]] for every vector space, and the existence of an [[algebraic closure]] for every [[field (mathematics)|field]].

==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;(P,\leq)&lt;/math&gt; be a partially ordered set and &lt;math&gt;S\subset P&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;m\in S&lt;/math&gt; is a maximal element of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; if

for all &lt;math&gt;s\in S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m \leq s &lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt; m = s. &lt;/math&gt;

The definition for minimal elements is obtained by using ≥ instead of ≤.

==Existence and uniqueness==
[[File:Zigzag poset.svg|thumb|x100px|A [[Fence (mathematics)|fence]] consists of minimal and maximal elements only (Example 3).]]
Maximal elements need not exist.

: '''Example 1:''' Let  ''S'' = [1,∞) ⊂ [[real number|ℝ]], for all ''m''∈''S'' we have ''s''=''m''+1∈''S'' but ''m''&lt;''s'' (that is, ''m''≤''s'' but not ''m''=''s'').

: '''Example 2:''' Let ''S'' = {''s''∈[[rational number|ℚ]]: 1≤''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;≤2} ⊂ ℚ and recall that [[Square_root_of_2#Proofs_of_irrationality|&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;∉ℚ]].

In general ≤ is only a partial order on ''S''. If ''m'' is a maximal element and ''s''∈''S'', it remains the possibility that neither ''s''≤''m'' nor ''m''≤''s''. This leaves open the possibility that there are many maximal elements.

: '''Example 3:''' In the [[Fence (mathematics)|fence]] ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''b''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ..., all the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are minimal, and all the ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are maximal, see picture.
: '''Example 4:''' Let ''A'' be a set with at least two elements and let ''S''={{''a''}: ''a''∈''A''} be the subset of the [[power set]] ''P''(''A'') consisting of [[singleton (mathematics)|singletons]], partially ordered by ⊂. This is the discrete poset—no two elements are comparable—and thus every element {''a''}∈''S'' is maximal (and minimal) and for any distinct ''a''&amp;prime;,''a''&amp;Prime; neither {''a''&amp;prime;} ⊂ {''a''&amp;Prime;} nor {''a''&amp;Prime;} ⊂ {''a''&amp;prime;}.

==Maximal elements and the greatest element==
[[File:Hasse diagram of powerset of 3.svg|thumb|x100px|Power set of {''x'',''y'',''z''}, partially ordered by ⊂. Its greatest element, {''x'',''y'',''z''}, is its only maximal element.]]
A maximal element need not be a [[greatest element]] or [[maximum]], since the definition of a maximal element is somewhat weaker than that of a greatest element. If &lt;math&gt;s\in S&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\max S\leq s&lt;/math&gt;, then, by the definition of greatest element, &lt;math&gt;s\leq \max S&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;s=\max S&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, a maximum, if it exists, is the (unique) maximal element.

The converse is not true: there can be maximal elements despite there being no maximum. Example 3 is an instance of this since there exist many maximal elements and no maximum. This is due, again, to the fact that in general &lt;math&gt;\leq &lt;/math&gt; is only a partial order on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is a maximal element and &lt;math&gt;s\in S&lt;/math&gt;, the possibility remains that neither &lt;math&gt;s\leq m&lt;/math&gt; nor &lt;math&gt;m\leq s&lt;/math&gt;.

If there are many maximal elements, there are contexts in which they are called '''frontiers''', as in the '''[[Pareto frontier]].'''

When the restriction of &lt;math&gt;\leq &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a [[total order]], the notions of maximal element and greatest element coincide. Let &lt;math&gt;m\in S&lt;/math&gt; be a maximal element, for any &lt;math&gt;s\in S&lt;/math&gt; either &lt;math&gt;s\leq m&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;m\leq s&lt;/math&gt;. In the second case, the definition of maximal element requires that &lt;math&gt;m=s&lt;/math&gt;, so it follows that &lt;math&gt;s\leq m&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is a greatest element.

&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; being totally ordered is sufficient to ensure that a maximal element is a greatest element, but this is not a necessary condition.
For example, every power set ''P''(''S'') of a set ''S'' has only one maximal element, viz. ''S'' itself, which is also the unique greatest element; but almost no power set is totally ordered, cf. picture.

==Directed sets==
In a [[totally ordered set]], the terms maximal element and greatest element coincide, which is why both terms are used interchangeably in fields like [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] where only total orders are considered. This observation applies not only to totally ordered subsets of any poset, but also to their order theoretic generalization via [[directed set]]s. In a directed set, every pair of elements (particularly pairs of incomparable elements) has a common upper bound within the set. Any maximal element of such a subset will be unique (unlike in a poset).  Furthermore, this unique maximal element will also be the greatest element.

Similar conclusions are true for minimal elements.

Further introductory information is found in the article on [[order theory]].

==Examples==
* In [[Pareto efficiency]], a '''Pareto optimum''' is a maximal element with respect to the partial order of Pareto improvement, and the set of maximal elements is called the '''Pareto frontier.'''
* In [[decision theory]], an '''[[admissible decision rule]]''' is a maximal element with respect to the partial order of ''[[dominating decision rule]].''
* In [[modern portfolio theory]], the set of maximal elements with respect to the [[product order]] on risk and return is called '''the [[efficient frontier]].'''
* In [[set theory]], a set is [[finite set|finite]] if and only if every non-empty [[family of sets|family]] of [[subset]]s has a minimal element when ordered by the [[inclusion relation]].
* In [[abstract algebra]], the concept of a [[maximal common divisor]] is needed to generalize [[greatest common divisor]]s to number systems in which the common divisors of a set of elements may have more than one maximal element.
* In [[computational geometry]], the [[maxima of a point set]] are maximal with respect to the partial order of coordinatewise domination.

===Consumer theory===
In economics, one may relax the axiom of antisymmetry, using preorders (generally [[total preorder]]s) instead of partial orders; the notion analogous to maximal element is very similar, but different terminology is used, as detailed below.

In [[consumer theory]] the consumption space is some set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, usually the positive orthant of some vector space so that each &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; represents a quantity of consumption specified for each existing commodity in the
economy. [[Preferences]] of a consumer are usually represented by a [[total preorder]] &lt;math&gt;\preceq &lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;x,y\in X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x\preceq y&lt;/math&gt; reads: &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is at most as preferred as &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. When &lt;math&gt;x\preceq y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y\preceq x&lt;/math&gt; it is interpreted that the consumer is indifferent between &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; but is no reason to conclude that &lt;math&gt;x=y&lt;/math&gt;, preference relations are never assumed to be antisymmetric. In this context, for any &lt;math&gt;B\subset X&lt;/math&gt;, we call &lt;math&gt;x\in B&lt;/math&gt; a '''maximal element''' if

: &lt;math&gt;y\in B&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt; y\preceq x&lt;/math&gt;

and it is interpreted as a consumption bundle that is not dominated by any other bundle in the sense that &lt;math&gt;x\prec y&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;math&gt;x\preceq y&lt;/math&gt; and not &lt;math&gt; y\preceq x&lt;/math&gt;.

It should be remarked that the formal definition looks very much like that of a greatest element for an ordered set. However, when &lt;math&gt;\preceq &lt;/math&gt; is only a preorder, an element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with the property above behaves very much like a maximal element in an ordering. For instance, a maximal element &lt;math&gt;x\in B&lt;/math&gt; is not unique for &lt;math&gt; y\preceq x&lt;/math&gt; does not preclude the possibility that &lt;math&gt; x\preceq y&lt;/math&gt; (while &lt;math&gt; y\preceq x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x\preceq y&lt;/math&gt; do not imply &lt;math&gt; x = y&lt;/math&gt; but simply indifference &lt;math&gt;x\sim y&lt;/math&gt;). The notion of greatest element for a preference preorder would be that of '''most preferred''' choice. That is, some &lt;math&gt;x\in B&lt;/math&gt; with

: &lt;math&gt;y\in B&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt; y\prec x.&lt;/math&gt;

An obvious application is to the definition of demand correspondence. Let &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; be the class of functionals on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. An element &lt;math&gt;p\in P&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''price functional''' or '''price system''' and maps every consumption bundle &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; into its market value &lt;math&gt;p(x)\in \Bbb{R}_+&lt;/math&gt;. The '''budget correspondence''' is a correspondence &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \colon P\times \Bbb{R}_+ \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; mapping any price system and any level of income into a subset

: &lt;math&gt;\Gamma (p,m)=\{x\in X \mid p(x)\leq m\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''demand correspondence''' maps any price &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and any level of income &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; into the set of &lt;math&gt;\preceq &lt;/math&gt;-maximal elements of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma (p,m)&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;D(p,m)=\big\{x\in X \mid x&lt;/math&gt; is a maximal element of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma (p,m)\big\}&lt;/math&gt;.

It is called demand correspondence because the theory predicts that for &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; given, the [[rational choice]] of a consumer &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt; will be some element &lt;math&gt;x^*\in D(p,m)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Related notions ==
A subset &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; of a partially ordered set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is said to be [[cofinal (mathematics)|cofinal]] if for every &lt;math&gt;x \in P&lt;/math&gt; there exists some &lt;math&gt;y \in Q&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x \le y&lt;/math&gt;. Every cofinal subset of a partially ordered set with maximal elements must contain all maximal elements.

A subset &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; of a partially ordered set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a [[lower set]] of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; if it is downward closed: if &lt;math&gt;y \in L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \le y&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x \in L&lt;/math&gt;. Every lower set &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; of a finite ordered set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the smallest lower set containing all maximal elements of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6813">In mathematics, the '''minimum ''k''-cut''', is a [[combinatorial optimization]] problem that requires finding a set of edges whose removal would partition the graph to at least ''k'' connected components. These edges are referred to as '''''k''-cut'''. The goal is to find the minimum-weight ''k''-cut. This partitioning can have applications in [[VLSI]] design, [[data-mining]], [[finite elements]] and communication in [[parallel computing]].

==Formal definition==
Given an undirected graph ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''V'',&amp;nbsp;''E'') with an assignment of weights to the edges ''w'':&amp;nbsp;''E''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''N'' and an integer ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;{2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;&amp;hellip;,&amp;nbsp;|''V''|}, partition ''V'' into ''k'' disjoint sets ''F''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&amp;hellip;,&amp;nbsp;''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;} while minimizing

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^k\sum_{\begin{smallmatrix} v_1 \in C_i \\ v_2 \in C_j \end{smallmatrix}} w ( \left \{ v_1, v_2 \right \} )&lt;/math&gt;

For a fixed ''k'', the problem is [[polynomial time]] solvable in ''O''(|''V''|&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldschmidt|Hochbaum|1988}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the problem is [[NP-complete]] if ''k'' is part of the input.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garey|Johnson|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also NP-complete if we specify &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; vertices and ask for the minimum &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-cut which separates these vertices among each of the sets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3690374?seq=13], which cites [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.13.6534]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approximations==
Several [[approximation algorithms]] exist with an approximation of 2&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2/''k''. A simple [[greedy algorithm]] that achieves this approximation factor computes a [[minimum cut]] in each connected components and removes the lightest one. This algorithm requires a total of ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 [[max flow]] computations. Another algorithm achieving the same guarantee uses the [[Gomory–Hu tree]] representation of minimum cuts. Constructing the Gomory&amp;ndash;Hu tree requires ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 max flow computations, but the algorithm requires an overall ''O''(''kn'') max flow computations. Yet, it is easier to analyze the approximation factor of the second algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Saran|Vazirani|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vazirani|2003|pp=40&amp;ndash;44}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, under the Small Set Expansion Hypothesis (a conjecture closely related to the [[Unique Games Conjecture]]), the problem is NP-hard to approximate to within &lt;math&gt;(2 - \epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; factor for every constant &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Manurangsi|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that the aforementioned approximation algorithms are essentially tight for large &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.

A variant of the problem asks for a minimum weight ''k''-cut where the output partitions have pre-specified sizes. This problem variant is approximable to within a factor of 3 for any fixed ''k'' if one restricts the graph to a metric space, meaning a [[complete graph]] that satisfies the [[triangle inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guttmann-Beck|Hassin|1999|pp=198&amp;ndash;207}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[polynomial time approximation scheme]]s (PTAS) were discovered for those problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fernandez de la Vega|Karpinski|Kenyon|2004}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41754">A '''multiplication algorithm''' is an [[algorithm]] (or method) to [[multiplication|multiply]] two numbers. Depending on the size of the numbers, different algorithms are in use. Efficient multiplication algorithms have existed since the advent of the decimal system.

==Grid method==
{{main|Grid method multiplication}}
The [[grid method multiplication|grid method]] (or box method) is an introductory method for multiple-digit multiplication that is often taught to pupils at [[primary school]] or [[elementary school]] level.  It has been a standard part of the national primary-school mathematics curriculum in England and Wales since the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Eason, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/639937.stm Back to school for parents], ''[[BBC News]]'', 13 February 2000&lt;br&gt;[[Rob Eastaway]], [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11258175 Why parents can't do maths today], ''[[BBC News]]'', 10 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Both factors are broken up ("partitioned") into their hundreds, tens and units parts, and the products of the parts are then calculated explicitly in a relatively simple multiplication-only stage, before these contributions are then totalled to give the final answer in a separate addition stage.

The calculation 34 × 13, for example, could be computed using the grid:
&lt;div style="float:right"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;  300
   40
   90
 + 12
 ————
  442&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
:{|class="wikitable" border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=15 style="text-align: center;"
! width="40" scope="col" | ×
! width="40" scope="col" | 30
! width="40" scope="col" | 4
|-
! scope="row" | 10
|300
|40
|-
! scope="row" | 3
|90
|12
|}

followed by addition to obtain 442, either in a single sum (see right), or through forming the row-by-row totals (300 + 40) + (90 + 12) = 340 + 102 = 442.

This calculation approach (though not necessarily with the explicit grid arrangement) is also known as the [[partial products algorithm]].  Its essence is the calculation of the simple multiplications separately, with all addition being left to the final gathering-up stage.

The grid method can in principle be applied to factors of any size, although the number of sub-products becomes cumbersome as the number of digits increases.   Nevertheless, it is seen as a usefully explicit method to introduce the idea of multiple-digit multiplications; and, in an age when most multiplication calculations are done using a calculator or a spreadsheet, it may in practice be the only multiplication algorithm that some students will ever need.

==Long multiplication==
If a [[numeral system|positional numeral system]] is used, a natural way of multiplying numbers is taught in  schools
as '''long multiplication''', sometimes called '''grade-school multiplication''', sometimes called '''Standard Algorithm''':
multiply the [[wikt:multiplicand|multiplicand]] by each digit of the [[wikt:multiplier|multiplier]] and then add up all the properly shifted results. It requires memorization of the [[multiplication table]] for single digits.

This is the usual algorithm for multiplying larger numbers by hand in base 10. Computers initially used a very similar [[#Shift and add|shift and add]] algorithm in base 2, but modern processors have optimized circuitry for fast multiplications using more efficient algorithms, at the price of a more complex hardware realization. A person doing long multiplication on paper will write down all the products and then add them together; an [[abacus]]-user will sum the products as soon as each one is computed.

===Example===
This example uses ''long multiplication'' to multiply 23,958,233 (multiplicand) by 5,830 (multiplier) and arrives at 139,676,498,390 for the result (product).
         23958233
   ×         5830
   ———————————————
         00000000 ( =      23,958,233 ×     0)
        71874699  ( =      23,958,233 ×    30)
      191665864   ( =      23,958,233 ×   800)
   + 119791165    ( =      23,958,233 × 5,000)
   ———————————————
     139676498390 ( = 139,676,498,390        )
Below pseudocode describes the process of above multiplication. It keeps only one row to maintain the sum which finally becomes the result. Note that the '+=' operator is used to denote sum to existing value and store operation (akin to languages such as Java and C) for compactness.

&lt;source lang="pascal"&gt;
multiply(a[1..p], b[1..q], base)                            // Operands containing rightmost digits at index 1
  product = [1..p+q]                                        // Allocate space for result
  for b_i = 1 to q                                          // for all digits in b
    carry = 0
    for a_i = 1 to p                                        // for all digits in a
      product[a_i + b_i - 1] += carry + a[a_i] * b[b_i]
      carry = product[a_i + b_i - 1] / base
      product[a_i + b_i - 1] = product[a_i + b_i - 1] mod base
    product[b_i + p] += carry                               // last digit comes from final carry
  return product
&lt;/source&gt;

===Optimizing space complexity===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
Let ''n'' be the total number of digits in the two input numbers in [[Radix|base]] ''D''. If the result must be kept in memory then the space complexity is trivially Θ(''n''). However, in certain applications, the entire result need not be kept in memory and instead the digits of the result can be streamed out as they are computed (for example, to system console or file). In these scenarios, long multiplication has the advantage that it can easily be formulated as a [[FL (complexity)|log space]] algorithm; that is, an algorithm that only needs working space proportional to the logarithm of the number of digits in the input (Θ(log&amp;nbsp;''n'')). This is the ''double'' logarithm of the numbers being multiplied themselves (log&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''N''). Note that operands themselves still need to be kept in memory and their Θ(''n'') space is not considered in this analysis.

The method is based on the observation that each digit of the result can be computed from right to left with only knowing the carry from the previous step. Let ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be the ''i''-th digit of the operand, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be the ''i''-th digit of the result and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be the carry generated for ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; (i=1 is the right most digit) then

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
r_i &amp;= \left( c_{i-1} + \sum_{j+k=i} a_j b_k \right) \mod D \\
c_i &amp;= \left\lfloor (c_{i-1} + \sum_{j+k=i} a_j b_k) / D \right\rfloor \\
c_0 &amp;= 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

A simple inductive argument shows that the carry can never exceed ''n'' and the total sum for ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; can never exceed ''D'' * ''n'': the carry into the first column is zero, and for all other columns, there are at most ''n'' digits in the column, and a carry of at most ''n'' from the previous column (by the induction hypothesis). The sum is at most ''D'' * ''n'', and the carry to the next column is at most ''D'' * ''n'' / ''D'', or ''n''. Thus both these values can be stored in O(log ''n'') digits.

In pseudocode, the log-space algorithm is:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pascal"&gt;
multiply(a[1..p], b[1..q], base)                  // Operands containing rightmost digits at index 1
    tot = 0
    for ri = 1 to p + q - 1                       //For each digit of result
        for bi = MAX(1, ri - p + 1) to MIN(ri, q) //Digits from b that need to be considered
            ai = ri − bi + 1                      //Digits from a follow "symmetry"
            tot = tot + (a[ai] * b[bi])
        product[ri] = tot mod base
        tot = floor(tot / base)
    product[p+q] = tot mod base                   //Last digit of the result comes from last carry
    return product
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Usage in computers===
Some [[Integrated circuit|chips]] implement this algorithm for various integer and floating-point sizes in [[computer hardware]] or in [[microcode]]. In [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic]], it's common to use long multiplication with the base set to 2&lt;sup&gt;''w''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''w'' is the number of bits in a word, for multiplying relatively small numbers.

To multiply two numbers with ''n'' digits using this method, one needs about ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; operations. More formally: using a natural size metric of number of digits, the time complexity of multiplying two ''n''-digit numbers using long multiplication is [[Big O notation|Θ]](''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

When implemented in software, long multiplication algorithms have to deal with overflow during additions, which can be expensive. For this reason, a typical approach is to represent the number in a small base ''b'' such that, for example, 8''b'' is a representable machine integer (for example Richard Brent used this approach in his Fortran package MP&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. Brent. A Fortran Multiple-Precision Arithmetic Package. Australian National University. March 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;); we can then perform several additions before having to deal with overflow. When the number becomes too large, we add part of it to the result or carry and map the remaining part back to a number less than ''b''; this process is called ''normalization''.

==Lattice multiplication==
{{main|Lattice multiplication}}
[[File:Hindu lattice.svg|thumb|right|First, set up the grid by marking its rows and columns with the numbers to be multiplied. Then, fill in the boxes with tens digits in the top triangles and units digits on the bottom.]]
[[File:Hindu lattice 2.svg|thumb|right|Finally, sum along the diagonal tracts and carry as needed to get the answer]]

Lattice, or sieve, multiplication is algorithmically equivalent to long multiplication. It requires the preparation of a lattice (a grid drawn on paper) which guides the calculation and separates all the multiplications from the [[addition]]s. It was introduced to Europe in 1202 in [[Fibonacci]]'s [[Liber Abaci]]. Fibonacci described the operation as mental, using his right and left hands to carry the intermediate calculations. [[Matrakçı Nasuh]] presented 6 different variants of this method in this 16th-century book, Umdet-ul Hisab. It was widely used in [[Enderun]] schools across the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Corlu, M. S., Burlbaw, L. M., Capraro, R. M., Corlu, M. A.,&amp; Han, S. (2010). The Ottoman Palace School Enderun and The Man with Multiple Talents, Matrakçı Nasuh. Journal of the Korea Society of Mathematical Education Series D: Research in Mathematical Education. 14(1), pp. 19–31.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Napier's bones]], or [[Napier's rods]] also used this method, as published by Napier in 1617, the year of his death.

As shown in the example, the multiplicand and multiplier are written above and to the right of a lattice, or a sieve. It is found in [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi]]'s "Arithmetic", one of Leonardo's sources mentioned by Sigler, author of "Fibonacci's Liber Abaci", 2002.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

*During the multiplication phase, the lattice is filled in with two-digit products of the corresponding digits labeling each row and column: the tens digit goes in the top-left corner.
*During the addition phase, the lattice is summed on the diagonals.
* Finally, if a carry phase is necessary, the answer as shown along the left and bottom sides of the lattice is converted to normal form by carrying ten's digits as in long addition or multiplication.

===Example===
The pictures on the right show how to calculate 345 × 12 using lattice multiplication. As a more complicated example, consider the picture below displaying the computation of 23,958,233 multiplied by 5,830 (multiplier); the result is 139,676,498,390.  Notice 23,958,233 is along the top of the lattice and 5,830 is along the right side.  The products fill the lattice and the sum of those products (on the diagonal) are along the left and bottom sides.  Then those sums are totaled as shown.

==Peasant or binary multiplication==
{{Main|Peasant multiplication}}
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
In base 2, long multiplication reduces to a nearly trivial operation. For each '1' bit in the [[wikt:multiplier|multiplier]], shift the [[wikt:multiplicand|multiplicand]] an appropriate amount and then sum the shifted values. Depending on computer processor architecture and choice of multiplier, it may be faster to code this algorithm using hardware bit shifts and adds rather than depend on multiplication instructions, when the multiplier is fixed and the number of adds required is small.

This [[algorithm]] is also known as peasant multiplication, because it has been widely used among those who are classified as peasants and thus have not memorized the [[multiplication table]]s required by long multiplication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Algebra/PeasantMultiplication.shtml|title=Peasant Multiplication|author-link=Alexander Bogomolny|last=Bogomolny|first= Alexander |website=www.cut-the-knot.org|access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The algorithm was also in use in ancient Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=D. Wells |year=1987 |page=44 |title=The Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Numbers |publisher=Penguin Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On paper, write down in one column the numbers you get when you repeatedly halve the multiplier, ignoring the remainder; in a column beside it repeatedly double the multiplicand. Cross out each row in which the last digit of the first number is even, and add the remaining numbers in the second column to obtain the product.

The main advantages of this method are that it can be taught quickly, no memorization is required, and it can be performed using tokens such as [[poker chip]]s if paper and pencil are not available. It does however take more steps than long multiplication so it can be unwieldy when large numbers are involved.

===Examples===
This example uses peasant multiplication to multiply 11 by 3 to arrive at a result of 33.

 Decimal:     Binary:
 11   3       1011  11
 5    6       101  110
 2   &lt;s&gt;12&lt;/s&gt;       10  &lt;s&gt;1100&lt;/s&gt;
 1   24       1  11000
     ——         ——————
     33         100001

Describing the steps explicitly:

* 11 and 3 are written at the top
* 11 is halved (5.5) and 3 is doubled (6).  The fractional portion is discarded (5.5 becomes 5).
* 5 is halved (2.5) and 6 is doubled (12).  The fractional portion is discarded (2.5 becomes 2).  The figure in the left column (2) is '''even''', so the figure in the right column (12) is discarded.
* 2 is halved (1) and 12 is doubled (24).
* All not-scratched-out values are summed: 3 + 6 + 24 = 33.

The method works because multiplication is [[distributivity|distributive]], so:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
3 \times 11 &amp; = 3 \times (1\times 2^0 + 1\times 2^1 + 0\times 2^2 + 1\times 2^3) \\
&amp; = 3 \times (1 + 2 + 8) \\
&amp; = 3 + 6 + 24 \\
&amp; = 33.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Shift and add==

Historically, computers used a "shift and add" algorithm to multiply small integers.  Both base 2 [[#Long multiplication|long multiplication]] and base 2 [[peasant multiplication]] reduce to this same algorithm.
In base 2, multiplying by the single digit of the multiplier reduces to a simple series of [[logical AND]] operations.  Each partial product is added to a running sum as soon as each partial product is computed. Most currently available microprocessors implement this or other similar algorithms (such as [[Booth encoding]]) for various integer and floating-point sizes in [[hardware multiplier]]s or in [[microcode]].

On currently available processors, a bit-wise shift instruction is faster than a multiply instruction and can be used to multiply (shift left) and divide (shift right) by powers of two. Multiplication by a constant and [[division algorithm#Division by a constant|division by a constant]] can be implemented using a sequence of shifts and adds or subtracts. For example, there are several ways to multiply by 10 using only bit-shift and addition.

 ((x &lt;&lt; 2) + x) &lt;&lt; 1 # Here 10*x is computed as (x*2^2 + x)*2
 (x &lt;&lt; 3) + (x &lt;&lt; 1) # Here 10*x is computed as x*2^3 + x*2

In some cases such sequences of shifts and adds or subtracts will outperform hardware multipliers and especially dividers. A division by a number of the form &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;2^n \pm 1&lt;/math&gt; often can be converted to such a short sequence.

These types of sequences have to always be used for computers that do not have a "multiply" instruction,&lt;ref&gt;
[http://techref.massmind.org/techref/method/math/muldiv.htm "Novel Methods of Integer Multiplication and Division"] by G. Reichborn-Kjennerud&lt;/ref&gt; and can also be used by extension to floating point numbers if one replaces the shifts with computation of ''2*x'' as ''x+x'', as these are logically equivalent.

==Quarter square multiplication==
Two quantities can be multiplied using quarter squares by employing the following identity involving the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor function]] that some sources&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Quarter Tables Revisited: Earlier Tables, Division of Labor in Table Construction, and Later Implementations in Analog Computers |last=McFarland |first=David|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/5n31064n |page=1 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Mathematics in Ancient Iraq: A Social History |last=Robson |first=Eleanor |page=227 |year=2008 |isbn= 978-0691091822 }}&lt;/ref&gt; attribute to [[Babylonian mathematics]] (2000–1600 BC).

: &lt;math&gt;
\left\lfloor \frac{\left(x+y\right)^2}{4} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{\left(x-y\right)^2}{4} \right\rfloor =
\frac{1}{4}\left(\left(x^2+2xy+y^2\right) - \left(x^2-2xy+y^2\right)\right) =
\frac{1}{4}\left(4xy\right) = xy.
&lt;/math&gt;

If one of {{math|''x''+''y''}} and {{math|''x''&amp;minus;''y''}} is odd, the other is odd too; this means that the fractions, if any, will cancel out, and discarding the remainders does not introduce any error. Below is a lookup table of quarter squares with the remainder discarded for the digits 0 through 18; this allows for the multiplication of numbers up to {{math|9×9}}.

If, for example, you wanted to multiply 9 by 3, you observe that the sum and difference are 12 and 6 respectively. Looking both those values up on the table yields 36 and 9, the difference of which is 27, which is the product of 9 and 3.

Antoine Voisin published a table of quarter squares from 1 to 1000 in 1817 as an aid in multiplication. A larger table of quarter squares from 1 to 100000 was published by Samuel Laundy in 1856,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Reviews |journal=The Civil Engineer and Architect's journal |year=1857 |pages=54–55 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gcNAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA54#v=onepage&amp;f=false |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a table from 1 to 200000 by Joseph Blater in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Multiplying with quarter squares |first=Neville |last=Holmes| journal=The Mathematical Gazette |volume=87 |issue=509 |year=2003 |pages=296–299 |jstor=3621048|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quarter square multipliers were used in [[analog computer]]s to form an [[analog signal]] that was the product of two analog input signals. In this application, the sum and difference of two input [[voltage]]s are formed using [[operational amplifier]]s. The square of each of these is approximated using [[piecewise linear function|piecewise linear]] circuits. Finally the difference of the two squares is formed and scaled by a factor of one fourth using yet another operational amplifier.

In 1980, Everett L. Johnson proposed using the quarter square method in a [[Digital data|digital]] multiplier.&lt;ref name=eljohnson&gt;{{Citation |last = Everett L. |first = Johnson |date = March 1980 |title = A Digital Quarter Square Multiplier |periodical = IEEE Transactions on Computers |publication-place = Washington, DC, USA |publisher = IEEE Computer Society |volume = C-29 |issue = 3 |pages = 258–261 |url = http://www2.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/TC.1980.1675558 |issn = 0018-9340 |doi =10.1109/TC.1980.1675558 |accessdate = 2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; To form the product of two 8-bit integers, for example, the digital device forms the sum and difference, looks both quantities up in a table of squares, takes the difference of the results, and divides by four by shifting two bits to the right. For 8-bit integers the table of quarter squares will have 2&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-1=511 entries (one entry for the full range 0..510 of possible sums, the differences using only the first 256 entries in range 0..255) or 2&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-1=511 entries (using for negative differences the technique of 2-complements and 9-bit masking, which avoids testing the sign of differences), each entry being 16-bit wide (the entry values are from (0²/4)=0 to (510²/4)=65025).

The Quarter square multiplier technique has also benefitted 8-bit systems that do not have any support for a hardware multiplier. Steven Judd implemented this for the [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]].&lt;ref name=sjudd&gt;{{Citation |last = Judd |first = Steven |date = Jan 1995 |periodical = C=Hacking |issue = 9 |url = http://www.ffd2.com/fridge/chacking/c=hacking9.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algorithm for multiplying numbers close to a round number==

Suppose we want to multiply two numbers &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; that are close to a round number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. Writing &lt;math&gt;x = N + x'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=N+y'&lt;/math&gt;, allows one to express the product as:
:&lt;math&gt;x y = \left(N+x'\right)\left(N+y'\right) =N^2 + N\left(x'+y'\right) + x'y' = N\left(N+x'+y'\right)+x'y' = N\left(x +y'\right)+x'y'&lt;/math&gt;

Example. Suppose we want to multiply 92 by 87. We can then take &lt;math&gt;N = 100&lt;/math&gt; and implement the above formula as follows. We write the numbers below each other and next to them the amounts we have to add to get to 100:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{c|c}92&amp;8\\87&amp;13\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
Since the numbers on the right are &lt;math&gt;-x'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-y'&lt;/math&gt;, the product is obtained by subtracting from the top left number the bottom right number (or subtract from the bottom left number the top right number), multiply that by 100 and add to that the product of the two numbers on the right. We have 87 - 8 = 79; 79*100 = 7900; 8*13 = 104; 7900+104 = 8004.

The multiplication of 8 by 13 could also have been done using the same method, by taking &lt;math&gt;N = 10&lt;/math&gt;. The above table can then be extended to:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{c|c|c}92&amp;8&amp;2\\87&amp;13&amp;-3\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
The product is then computed by evaluating the differences 87-8=79; 13-2 = 11, and the product 2*(-3) = -6. We then have 92*87 = 79*100 + 11*10 - 6 = 7900 + 104 = 8004.

==Fast multiplication algorithms for large inputs==
{{unsolved|computer science|What is the fastest algorithm for multiplication of two &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-digit numbers?}}

=== Complex multiplication algorithm===
Complex multiplication normally involves four multiplications and two additions.

:&lt;math&gt;(a+bi) (c+di) = (ac-bd) + (bc+ad)i.&lt;/math&gt;

Or

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{c|c|c}
\times &amp; a &amp; bi \\
\hline
c &amp; ac &amp; bci \\
\hline
di &amp; adi &amp; -bd
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

But there is a way of reducing the number of multiplications to three.&lt;ref name="taocp-vol2-sec464-ex41"&gt;{{Citation | last1=Knuth | first1=Donald E. | author1-link=Donald Knuth | title=[[The Art of Computer Programming]] volume 2: Seminumerical algorithms | publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]] | year=1988 | pages=519, 706}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The product (''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''bi'') · (''c''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''di'') can be calculated in the following way.

:''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''c'' · (''a'' + ''b'')
:''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a'' · (''d'' − ''c'')
:''k''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b'' · (''c'' + ''d'')
:Real part = ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''k''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
:Imaginary part  = ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

This algorithm uses only three multiplications, rather than four, and five additions or subtractions rather than two. If a multiply is more expensive than three adds or subtracts, as when calculating by hand, then there is a gain in speed. On modern computers a multiply and an add can take about the same time so there may be no speed gain. There is a trade-off in that there may be some loss of precision when using floating point.

For [[fast Fourier transform]]s (FFTs) (or any [[Linear map|linear transformation]]) the complex multiplies are by constant coefficients ''c''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''di'' (called [[twiddle factor]]s in FFTs), in which case two of the additions (''d''−''c'' and ''c''+''d'') can be precomputed. Hence, only three multiplies and three adds are required.&lt;ref&gt;P. Duhamel and M. Vetterli, [http://math.berkeley.edu/~strain/273.F10/duhamel.vetterli.fft.review.pdf Fast Fourier transforms: A tutorial review and a state of the art"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529212847/http://math.berkeley.edu/~strain/273.F10/duhamel.vetterli.fft.review.pdf |date=2014-05-29 }}, ''Signal Processing'' vol. 19, pp. 259–299 (1990), section 4.1.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, trading off a multiplication for an addition in this way may no longer be beneficial with modern [[floating-point unit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;S. G. Johnson and M. Frigo, "[http://fftw.org/newsplit.pdf A modified split-radix FFT with fewer arithmetic operations]," ''IEEE Trans. Signal Process.'' vol. 55, pp. 111–119 (2007), section IV.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Karatsuba multiplication===
{{Main|Karatsuba algorithm}}
For systems that need to multiply numbers in the range of several thousand digits, such as [[computer algebra system]]s and [[bignum]] libraries, long multiplication is too slow. These systems may employ '''Karatsuba multiplication''', which was discovered in 1960 (published in 1962). The heart of [[Anatoly Karatsuba|Karatsuba]]'s method lies in the observation that two-digit multiplication can be done with only three rather than the four multiplications classically required. This is an example of what is now called a ''[[divide and conquer algorithm]]''. Suppose we want to multiply two 2-digit base-''m'' numbers: ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' m + x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' m + y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:

# compute ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; · ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, call the result ''F''
# compute ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; · ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, call the result ''G''
# compute (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) · (''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), call the result ''H''
# compute ''H'' − ''F'' − ''G'', call the result ''K''; this number is equal to ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; · ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; · ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
# compute ''F'' · ''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''K'' · ''m'' + ''G''.

To compute these three products of ''m''-digit numbers, we can employ the same trick again, effectively using [[recursion]]. Once the numbers are computed, we need to add them together (steps 4 and 5), which takes about ''n'' operations.

Karatsuba multiplication has a time complexity of [[Big O notation|O]](''n''&lt;sup&gt;log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) ≈ O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;1.585&lt;/sup&gt;), making this method significantly faster than long multiplication. Because of the overhead of recursion, Karatsuba's multiplication is slower than long multiplication for small values of ''n''; typical implementations therefore switch to long multiplication if ''n'' is below some threshold.

Karatsuba's algorithm is the first known algorithm for multiplication that is asymptotically faster than long multiplication,&lt;ref&gt;D. Knuth, ''The Art of Computer Programming'', vol. 2, sec. 4.3.3 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; and can thus be viewed as the starting point for the theory of fast multiplications.

In 1963, Peter Ungar suggested setting ''m'' to ''i'' to obtain a similar reduction in the complex multiplication algorithm.&lt;ref name="taocp-vol2-sec464-ex41"/&gt; To multiply (''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b i'') · (''c''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''d i''), follow these steps:
# compute ''b'' · ''d'', call the result ''F''
# compute ''a'' · ''c'', call the result ''G''
# compute (''a'' + ''b'') · (''c'' + ''d''), call the result ''H''
# the imaginary part of the result is ''K'' = ''H'' − ''F'' − ''G'' = ''a'' · ''d'' + ''b'' · ''c''
# the real part of the result is ''G'' − ''F'' = ''a'' · ''c'' - ''b'' · ''d''

Like the algorithm in the previous section, this requires three multiplications and five additions or subtractions.

===Toom–Cook===
{{Main|Toom–Cook multiplication}}
Another method of multiplication is called Toom–Cook or Toom-3. The Toom–Cook method splits each number to be multiplied into multiple parts. The Toom–Cook method is one of the generalizations of the Karatsuba method. A three-way Toom–Cook can do a size-''3N'' multiplication for the cost of five size-''N'' multiplications, improvement by a factor of 9/5 compared to the Karatsuba method's improvement by a factor of 4/3.

Although using more and more parts can reduce the time spent on recursive multiplications further, the overhead from additions and digit management also grows. For this reason, the method of Fourier transforms is typically faster for numbers with several thousand digits, and asymptotically faster for even larger numbers.

===Fourier transform methods===
[[File:Integer multiplication by FFT.svg|thumb|350px|Demonstration of multiplying 1234 × 5678 = 7006652 using fast Fourier transforms (FFTs). [[Number-theoretic transform]]s in the integers modulo 337 are used, selecting 85 as an 8th root of unity. Base 10 is used in place of base 2&lt;sup&gt;''w''&lt;/sup&gt; for illustrative purposes.]]
The basic idea due to [[Volker Strassen|Strassen]] (1968) is to use fast polynomial multiplication to perform fast integer multiplication. The algorithm was made practical and theoretical guarantees were provided in 1971 by [[Arnold Schönhage|Schönhage]] and Strassen resulting in the [[Schönhage–Strassen algorithm]].&lt;ref name="schönhage"&gt;A. Schönhage and V. Strassen, "Schnelle Multiplikation großer Zahlen", ''Computing'' '''7''' (1971), pp. 281–292.&lt;/ref&gt; The details are the following: We choose the largest integer ''w'' that will not cause [[Integer overflow|overflow]] during the process outlined below. Then we split the two numbers into ''m'' groups of ''w'' bits as follows

: &lt;math&gt;a=\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} {a_i 2^{wi}}\text{ and }b=\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} {b_j 2^{wj}}.&lt;/math&gt;

We look at these numbers as polynomials in ''x'', where ''x = 2&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;'', to get,

: &lt;math&gt;a=\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} {a_i x^{i}}\text{ and }b=\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} {b_j x^{j}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then we can then say that,

: &lt;math&gt;ab=\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} \sum_{j=0}^{m-1} a_i b_j x^{(i+j)} =  \sum_{k=0}^{2m-2}  c_k x^{k} &lt;/math&gt;

Clearly the above setting is realized by polynomial multiplication, of two polynomials ''a'' and ''b''. The crucial step now is to use [[Discrete Fourier transform#Polynomial multiplication|Fast Fourier multiplication]] of polynomials to realize the multiplications above faster than in naive ''O(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)'' time.

To remain in the modular setting of Fourier transforms, we look for a ring with a ''2m&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;'' root of unity. Hence we do multiplication modulo ''N'' (and thus in the ''Z/NZ'' [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]]). Further, N must be chosen so that there is no 'wrap around', essentially, no reductions modulo N occur. Thus, the choice of N is crucial. For example, it could be done as,

: &lt;math&gt; N = 2^{3w} + 1 &lt;/math&gt;

The ring ''Z/NZ'' would thus have a ''2m&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;'' root of unity, namely 8. Also, it can be checked that ''c&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; N'', and thus no wrap around will occur.

The algorithm has a time complexity of Θ(''n''&amp;nbsp;log(''n'')&amp;nbsp;log(log(''n''))) and is used in practice for numbers with more than 10,000 to 40,000 decimal digits. In 2007 this was improved by Martin Fürer ([[Fürer's algorithm]]) &lt;ref name="fürer_1"&gt;Fürer, M. (2007). "[https://web.archive.org/web/20130425232048/http://www.cse.psu.edu/~furer/Papers/mult.pdf Faster Integer Multiplication]" in Proceedings of the thirty-ninth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing, June 11–13, 2007, San Diego, California, USA&lt;/ref&gt; to give a time complexity of ''n''&amp;nbsp;log(''n'')&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;Θ(log&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(''n''))&lt;/sup&gt; using Fourier transforms over complex numbers. Anindya De, Chandan Saha, Piyush Kurur and Ramprasad Saptharishi&lt;ref&gt;Anindya De, Piyush P Kurur, Chandan Saha, Ramprasad Saptharishi. Fast Integer Multiplication Using Modular Arithmetic. Symposium on Theory of Computation (STOC) 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  gave a similar algorithm using [[modular arithmetic]] in 2008 achieving the same running time.  In context of the above material, what these latter authors have achieved is to find ''N'' much less than ''2&lt;sup&gt;3k&lt;/sup&gt; + 1'', so that ''Z/NZ'' has a ''2m&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;'' root of unity. This speeds up computation and reduces the time complexity. However, these latter algorithms are only faster than Schönhage–Strassen for impractically large inputs.

Using [[number-theoretic transform]]s instead of [[discrete Fourier transform]]s avoids [[rounding error]] problems by using modular arithmetic instead of [[floating point|floating-point]] arithmetic. In order to apply the factoring which enables the FFT to work, the length of the transform must be factorable to small primes and must be a factor of ''N''-1, where ''N'' is the field size.  In particular, calculation using a Galois Field GF(''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), where ''k'' is a [[Mersenne Prime]], allows the use of a transform sized to a power of 2; e.g. ''k'' = 2&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;-1 supports transform sizes up to 2&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Lower bounds==

There is a trivial lower bound of Ω(''n'') for multiplying two ''n''-bit numbers on a single processor; no matching algorithm (on conventional Turing machines) nor any better lower bound is known. Multiplication lies outside of [[ACC0|AC&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;[''p'']]] for any prime ''p'', meaning there is no family of constant-depth, polynomial (or even subexponential) size circuits using AND, OR, NOT, and MOD&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; gates that can compute a product. This follows from a constant-depth reduction of MOD&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; to multiplication.&lt;ref&gt;Sanjeev Arora and Boaz Barak, ''Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach'', Cambridge University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Lower bounds for multiplication are also known for some classes of [[branching program]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Farid Ablayev and Marek Karpinski, ''A lower bound for integer multiplication on randomized ordered read-once branching programs'', Information and Computation 186 (2003), 78–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polynomial multiplication==
All the above multiplication algorithms can also be expanded to multiply [[polynomial]]s. For instance the Strassen algorithm may be used for polynomial multiplication&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/title/Strassen+algorithm+for+polynomial+multiplication|title=Strassen algorithm for polynomial multiplication |publisher=Everything2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Alternatively the [[Kronecker substitution]] technique may be used to convert the problem of multiplying polynomials into a single binary multiplication.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1 = Joachim |last1 = von zur Gathen | author1-link = Joachim von zur Gathen |first2 = Jürgen | last2 = Gerhard |title = Modern Computer Algebra |publisher =  Cambridge University Press |year = 1999 |isbn = 978-0-521-64176-0 |pages = 243–244 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AE5PN5QGgvUC&amp;pg=PA245 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Long multiplication methods can be generalised to allow the multiplication of algebraic formulae:

  14ac - 3ab + 2 multiplied by ac - ab + 1

  14ac  -3ab   2
    ac   -ab   1
  ————————————————————
  14a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  -3a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;bc   2ac
         -14a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;bc         3 a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  -2ab
                  14ac           -3ab   2
  ———————————————————————————————————————
  14a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; -17a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;bc   16ac  3a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;    -5ab  +2
  &lt;nowiki&gt;=======================================&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Castle|first1=Frank|title=Workshop Mathematics|date=1900|publisher=MacMillan and Co|location=London|page=74|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a further example of column based multiplication, consider multiplying 23 long tons (t), 12 hundredweight (cwt) and 2 quarters (qtr) by 47.  This example uses [[avoirdupois]] measures: 1 t = 20 cwt, 1 cwt = 4 qtr.

     t    cwt  qtr
    23     12    2
                47 x
  ————————————————
   161     84   94
   920    480
    29     23
  ————————————————
  1110    587   94
  ————————————————
  1110      7    2
  &lt;nowiki&gt;=================&lt;/nowiki&gt;  Answer: 1110 ton 7 cwt 2 qtr

First multiply the quarters by 2, the result 94 is written into the first workspace.  Next, multiply 12 x 47 but don't add up the partial results (84, 480) yet.  Likewise multiply 23 by 47.  The quarters column is totaled and the result placed in the second workspace (a trivial move in this case).  94 quarters is 23 cwt and 2 qtr, so place the 2 in the answer and put the 23 in the next column left.  Now add up the three entries in the cwt column giving 587.  This is 29 t 7 cwt, so write the 7 into the answer and the 29 in the column to the left.  Now add up the tons column.  There is no adjustment to make, so the result is just copied down.

The same layout and methods can be used for any traditional measurements and non-decimal currencies such as the old British [[£sd]] system.

This article lists and discusses the usage and derivation of '''names of large numbers''', together with their possible extensions.

The following table lists those names of [[large number]]s that are found in many English dictionaries and thus have a special claim to being "real words." The "Traditional British" values shown are unused in American English and are obsolete in British English, but their other-language variants are dominant in many non-English-speaking areas, including [[continental Europe]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking countries in [[Latin America]]; see [[Long and short scales]].

Indian English does not use millions, but has its own system of large numbers including [[lakh]]s and [[crore]]s.

English also has many words, such as "zillion", used informally to mean large but unspecified amounts; see [[indefinite and fictitious numbers]].

Apart from ''million'', the words in this list ending with -''illion'' are all derived by adding prefixes (''bi''-, ''tri''-, etc., derived from Latin) to the stem -''illion''.&lt;ref&gt;p. 316, ''The History of the English Language'', [[Oliver Farrar Emerson]], New York, London: Macmillan and Co., 1894.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Centillion''&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=centillion Entry for ''centillion'' in the ''American Heritage Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt; appears to be the highest name ending in -"illion" that is included in these dictionaries. ''Trigintillion'', often cited as a word in discussions of names of large numbers, is not included in any of them, nor are any of the names that can easily be created by extending the naming pattern (''unvigintillion'', ''duovigintillion'', ''duoquinquagintillion'', etc.).

All of the dictionaries included ''googol'' and ''googolplex'', generally crediting it to the Kasner and Newman book and to Kasner's nephew. None include any higher names in the googol family (googolduplex, etc.). The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' comments that ''googol'' and ''googolplex'' are "not in formal mathematical use".

==Usage of names of large numbers==
Some names of large numbers, such as ''million'', ''billion'', and ''trillion'', have real referents in human experience, and are encountered in many contexts. At times, the names of large numbers have been forced into common usage as a result of [[hyperinflation]]. The highest numerical value banknote ever printed was a note for 1 sextillion [[pengő]] (10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; or 1 milliard bilpengő as printed) printed in [[Hungary]] in 1946. In 2009, [[Zimbabwe]] printed a 100&amp;nbsp;trillion (10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;) [[Zimbabwean dollar]] note, which at the time of printing was worth about US$30.&lt;ref name=zimbabwe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7832601.stm|title=Zimbabwe rolls out Z$100tr note|publisher=BBC News|date=16 January 2009|accessdate=2009-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Names of larger numbers, however, have a tenuous, artificial existence, rarely found outside definitions, lists, and discussions of the ways in which large numbers are named. Even well-established names like ''sextillion'' are rarely used, since in the context of science, including astronomy, where such large numbers often occur, they are nearly always written using [[scientific notation]]. In this notation, powers of ten are expressed as ''10'' with a numeric superscript, e.g. "The X-ray emission of the radio galaxy is {{val|1.3|e=45|u=joules}}." When a number such as 10&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt; needs to be referred to in words, it is simply read out as "ten to the forty-fifth". This is easier to say and less ambiguous than "quattuordecillion", which means something different in the long scale and the short scale.

When a number represents a quantity rather than a count, [[SI prefix]]es can be used—thus "femtosecond", not "one quadrillionth of a second"—although often powers of ten are used instead of some of the very high and very low prefixes. In some cases, specialized units are used, such as the astronomer's [[parsec]] and [[light year]] or the particle physicist's [[barn (unit)|barn]].

Nevertheless, large numbers have an intellectual fascination and are of mathematical interest, and giving them names is one of the ways in which people try to conceptualize and understand them.

One of the earliest examples of this is ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]'', in which [[Archimedes]] gave a system for naming large numbers. To do this, he called the numbers up to a [[myriad]] myriad (10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;) "first numbers" and called 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; itself the "unit of the second numbers". Multiples of this unit then became the second numbers, up to this unit taken a myriad myriad times, 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;·10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;=10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;. This became the "unit of the third numbers", whose multiples were the third numbers, and so on. Archimedes continued naming numbers in this way up to a myriad myriad times the unit of the 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;-th numbers, i.e. &lt;math&gt;(10^8)^{(10^8)}=10^{8\cdot 10^8},&lt;/math&gt; and embedded this construction within another copy of itself to produce names for numbers up to &lt;math&gt;((10^8)^{(10^8)})^{(10^8)}=10^{8\cdot 10^{16}}.&lt;/math&gt; Archimedes then estimated the number of grains of sand that would be required to fill the known universe, and found that it was no more than "one thousand myriad of the eighth numbers" (10&lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt;).

Since then, many others have engaged in the pursuit of conceptualizing and naming numbers that really have no existence outside the imagination. One motivation for such a pursuit is that attributed to the inventor of the word ''[[googol]]'', who was certain that any finite number "had to have a name". Another possible motivation is competition between students in computer programming courses, where a common exercise is that of writing a program to output numbers in the form of English words.

Most names proposed for large numbers belong to systematic schemes which are extensible. Thus, many names for large numbers are simply the result of following a naming system to its logical conclusion—or extending it further.

==Origins of the "standard dictionary numbers"==
[[File:Chuquet.gif|right|500px]]

The&amp;nbsp;words ''bymillion'' and ''trimillion'' were first recorded in 1475 in a manuscript of [[Jehan Adam]]. Subsequently, [[Nicolas Chuquet]] wrote a book ''Triparty en la science des nombres'' which was not published during Chuquet's lifetime. However, most of it was copied by [[Estienne de La Roche]] for a portion of his 1520 book, ''[[L'arismetique]]''. Chuquet's book contains a passage in which he shows a large number marked off into groups of six digits, with the comment:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ou qui veult le premier point peult signiffier million Le second point byllion Le tiers point tryllion Le quart quadrillion Le cinq&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; quyllion Le six&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; sixlion Le sept.&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; septyllion Le huyt&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; ottyllion Le neuf&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; nonyllion et ainsi des ault'&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; se plus oultre on vouloit preceder
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(Or if you prefer the first mark can signify million, the second mark byllion, the third mark tryllion, the fourth quadrillion, the fifth quyillion, the sixth sixlion, the seventh septyllion, the eighth ottyllion, the ninth nonyllion and so on with others as far as you wish to go).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Adam and Chuquet used the [[long and short scales|long scale]] of powers of a million; that is, Adam's ''bymillion'' (Chuquet's ''byllion'') denoted 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;, and Adam's ''trimillion'' (Chuquet's ''tryllion'') denoted 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;.

==The googol family==
The names ''[[googol]]'' and ''[[googolplex]]'' were invented by [[Edward Kasner]]'s nephew, Milton Sirotta, and introduced in Kasner and Newman's 1940 book,
''[[Mathematics and the Imagination]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Kasner, Edward and James Newman, ''Mathematics and the Imagination,'' 1940, Simon and Schuster, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
in the following passage:
{{quote|The name "googol" was invented by a child (Dr. Kasner's nine-year-old nephew) who was asked to think up a name for a very big number, namely 1 with one hundred zeroes after it. He was very certain that this number was not infinite, and therefore equally certain that it had to have a name. At the same time that he suggested "googol" he gave a name for a still larger number: "Googolplex". A googolplex is much larger than a googol, but is still finite, as the inventor of the name was quick to point out. It was first suggested that a googolplex should be 1, followed by writing zeros until you got tired. This is a description of what would actually happen if one actually tried to write a googolplex, but different people get tired at different times and it would never do to have [[Primo Carnera|Carnera]] a better mathematician than [[Albert Einstein|Dr. Einstein]], simply because he had more endurance. The googolplex is, then, a specific finite number, equal to 1 with a googol zeros after it.}}

have suggested that ''N-plex'' be used as a name for 10&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;. This gives rise to the name ''googolplexplex'' for 10&lt;sup&gt;googolplex&lt;/sup&gt; = 10{{sup|10{{sup|10{{sup|100}}}}}}. This number (ten to the power of a googolplex) is also known as a googolduplex and googolplexian.&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, Jonathan. "Infinity Scrapers". Polytope, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Conway and Guy&lt;ref name=a /&gt; have proposed that ''N-minex'' be used as a name for 10&lt;sup&gt;−N&lt;/sup&gt;, giving rise to the name ''googolminex'' for the [[Reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]] of a googolplex. None of these names are in wide use, nor are any currently found in dictionaries.

The names ''googol'' and ''googolplex'' inspired the name of the [[Dot-com company|Internet company]] [[Google]] and its [[corporate headquarters]], the [[Googleplex]], respectively.

==Extensions of the standard dictionary numbers==
This section illustrates several systems for naming large numbers, and shows how they can be extended past ''vigintillion''.

Traditional British usage assigned new names for each power of one million (the [[long and short scales|long scale]]): {{nowrap|1,000,000 {{=}} 1 million}}; {{nowrap|1,000,000&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 1 billion}}; {{nowrap|1,000,000&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 1 trillion}}; and so on. It was adapted from French usage, and is similar to the system that was documented or invented by [[Nicolas Chuquet|Chuquet]].

Traditional American usage (which was also adapted from French usage but at a later date), Canadian, and modern British usage assign new names for each power of one thousand (the [[long and short scales|short scale]].) Thus, a ''billion'' is 1000 × 1000&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;; a ''trillion'' is 1000 × 1000&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;; and so forth. Due to its dominance in the financial world (and by the [[US dollar]]), this was adopted for official [[United Nations]] documents.

Traditional French usage has varied; in 1948, France, which had been using the short scale, reverted to the long scale.

The term ''milliard'' is unambiguous and always means 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;. It is almost never seen in American usage, rarely in British usage, and frequently in European usage. The term is sometimes attributed to French mathematician [[Jacques Peletier du Mans]] circa 1550 (for this reason, the long scale is also known as the ''Chuquet-Peletier'' system), but the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] states that the term derives from post-Classical [[Latin]] term ''milliartum'', which became ''milliare'' and then ''milliart'' and finally our modern term.

With regard to names ending in -illiard for numbers 10&lt;sup&gt;6''n''+3&lt;/sup&gt;, ''milliard'' is certainly in widespread use in languages other than English, but the degree of actual use of the larger terms is questionable. The terms "Milliarde" in German, "miljard" in Dutch, "milyar" in Turkish and "миллиард" in Russian are standard usage when discussing financial topics.

For additional details, see [[billion (disambiguation)|billion]] and [[long and short scales]].

The naming procedure for large numbers is based on taking the number ''n'' occurring in 10&lt;sup&gt;3''n''+3&lt;/sup&gt; (short scale) or 10&lt;sup&gt;6''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (long scale) and concatenating Latin roots for its units, tens, and hundreds place, together with the suffix ''-illion''. In this way, numbers up to 10&lt;sup&gt;3·999+3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;3000&lt;/sup&gt; (short scale) or 10&lt;sup&gt;6·999&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;5994&lt;/sup&gt; (long scale) may be named. The choice of roots and the concatenation procedure is that of the standard dictionary numbers if ''n'' is 20 or smaller. For larger ''n'' (between 21 and 999), prefixes can be constructed based on a system described by [[John Horton Conway]] and [[Richard K. Guy]]:&lt;ref name=a /&gt;

Since the system of using Latin prefixes will become ambiguous for numbers with exponents of a size which the Romans rarely counted to, like 10&lt;sup&gt;6,000,258&lt;/sup&gt;, Conway and Guy have also proposed a consistent set of conventions which permit, in principle, the extension of this system to provide English names for any integer whatsoever.&lt;ref name=a /&gt;

The following table shows number names generated by the system described by Conway and Guy for the short and long scales.

'''Names of reciprocals of large numbers''' are not listed, as they are regularly formed by adding -th, e.g. ''quattuordecillionth,'' ''centillionth,'' etc.

In 2001, Russ Rowlett, Director of the Center for Mathematics and Science Education at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] proposed that, to avoid confusion, the [[Latin]]-based short scale and long scale systems should be replaced by an unambiguous [[Greek language|Greek]]-based system for naming large numbers that would be based on powers of one thousand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''George Neil Robertson''' (born November 30, 1938) is a mathematician working mainly in [[topological graph theory]], currently a distinguished professor&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061207212411/http://www.math.ohio-state.edu/node/25682 Neil Robertson awarded the title of Distinguished Professor], David Goss, Ohio State, 2006-09-26.&lt;/ref&gt; emeritus&lt;ref name="science"/&gt; at the [[Ohio State University]].  He earned his B.Sc. from [[Brandon College]] in 1959, and his Ph.D. in 1969 at the [[University of Waterloo]] under his [[doctoral advisor]] [[William Tutte]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brandonu.ca/sickle/YB1959.pdf The Sickle, Brandon College Year Book 1959] p.30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{mathgenealogy|name=G. Neil (George) Robertson|id=11150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
In 1969, Robertson joined the faculty of The Ohio State University, where he was promoted to Associate Professor in 1972 and Professor in 1984. He was a consultant with Bell Communications Research from 1984 to 1996. He has held visiting faculty positions in many institutions, most extensively at Princeton University from 1996 to 2001, and at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, in 2002. He also holds an adjunct position at [[King Abdulaziz University]] in [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref name="science"&gt;{{citation|title=Saudi Universities offer cash in exchange for academic prestige |first=Yudhijit |last= Bhattacharjee |journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=9 December 2011 |pages=1344–1345 |doi= 10.1126/science.334.6061.1344 |volume=334 |issue=6061 |pmid=22158799}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Robertson is known for his work in [[graph theory]], and particularly for a long series of papers co-authored with [[Paul Seymour (mathematician)|Paul Seymour]] and published over a span of many years, in which they proved the [[Robertson–Seymour theorem]] (formerly Wagner's Conjecture).  This states that families of graphs closed under the [[graph minor]] operation may be characterized by a [[finite set]] of [[forbidden minor]]s. As part of this work, Robertson and Seymour also proved the [[graph structure theorem]] describing the graphs in these families.

Additional major results in Robertson's research include the following:
*In 1964, Robertson discovered the [[Robertson graph]], the smallest possible 4-[[regular graph]] with [[girth (graph theory)|girth]] five.
*In 1994, with Seymour and [[Robin Thomas (mathematician)|Robin Thomas]], Robertson extended the number of colors for which the [[Hadwiger conjecture (graph theory)|Hadwiger conjecture]] relating [[graph coloring]] to graph minors is known to be true. As of 2012 this remains the strongest known result on this conjecture.
*In 1996, Robertson, Seymour, Thomas, and [[Daniel P. Sanders]] published a new proof of the [[four color theorem]], confirming the Appel–Haken proof which until then had been disputed. Their proof also leads to an efficient [[algorithm]] for finding 4-colorings of planar graphs.
*In 2006, Robertson, Seymour, Thomas, and [[Maria Chudnovsky]],  proved the long-conjectured [[strong perfect graph theorem]] characterizing the [[perfect graph]]s by forbidden [[induced subgraph]]s.

==Awards and honors==
Robertson has won the [[Fulkerson Prize]] three times, in 1994 for his work on the Hadwiger conjecture, in 2006 for the Robertson–Seymour theorem, and in 2009 for his proof of the strong perfect graph theorem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/prizes-awards/ams-prizes/fulkerson-prize Delbert Rey Fulkerson Prize], [[American Mathematical Society]], accessed 2012-01-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also won the [[Pólya Prize (SIAM)]] in 2004, the OSU Distinguished Scholar Award in 1997, and the Waterloo Alumni Achievement Medal in 2002. In 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-07-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''neutron–proton ratio''' ('''N/Z ratio''' or '''nuclear ratio''')  of an [[atomic nucleus]] is the [[ratio]] of its number of [[neutron]]s to its number of [[proton]]s. Among stable nuclei and naturally occurring nuclei, this ratio generally increases with increasing atomic number. This is because electrical repulsive forces between protons scale with distance differently than [[strong nuclear force]] attractions. In particular, most pairs of protons in large nuclei are not far enough apart, such that electrical repulsion dominates over the strong nuclear force, and thus proton density in stable larger nuclei must be lower than in stable smaller nuclei where more pairs of protons have appreciable short-range nuclear force attractions.

For each element with atomic number Z small enough to occupy only the first three [[nuclear shell model| nuclear shells]], that is up to that of [[calcium]] (Z = 20), there exists a stable isotope with N/Z ratio of one, with the exception of [[beryllium]] (N/Z = 1.25) and every element with odd atomic number between 9 and 19 inclusive (N = Z+1). [[Hydrogen-1]] (N/Z ratio = 0) and [[helium-3]] (N/Z ratio = 0.5) are the only stable isotopes with neutron–proton ratio under one. [[Uranium-238]] and [[plutonium-244]] have the highest N/Z ratios of any [[primordial nuclide]] at 1.587 and 1.596, respectively, while [[lead-208]] has the highest N/Z ratio of any known stable isotope at 1.537. [[Radioactive decay]] generally proceeds so as to change the N/Z ratio to increase stability.  If the N/Z ratio is greater than 1, [[alpha decay]] increases the N/Z ratio, and hence provides a common pathway towards stability for decays involving large nuclei with too few neutrons. [[Positron emission]] and [[electron capture]] also increase the ratio, while [[beta decay]] will decrease the ratio.

Nuclear waste exists mainly because nuclear fuel has a higher stable N/Z ratio than the parts into which it is fissioned.

==Semi-empirical description==

For stable nuclei, the neutron-proton ratio is such that the [[bonding energy]] is at a local minimum or close to a minimum. 

From the liquid drop model, this bonding energy is approximated by empirical [[Bethe–Weizsäcker formula]]
:&lt;math&gt;E_{B} = a_{V} A - a_{S} A^{2/3} - a_{C} \frac{Z^2}{A^{1/3}} - a_{A} \frac{(A - 2Z)^{2}}{A} \pm \delta(A,Z).&lt;/math&gt;

Given a value of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and ignoring the contributions of nucleon spin pairing (i.e. ignoring the &lt;math&gt;\pm \delta(A,Z)&lt;/math&gt; term), the binding energy is a quadratic expression in &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; that is minimized when the neutron-proton ratio is &lt;math&gt;N/Z \approx 1 + \frac{a_C}{2a_A} A^{2/3} &lt;/math&gt;.

The '''Post correspondence problem''' is an [[undecidable problem|undecidable]] [[decision problem]] that was introduced by [[Emil Post]] in 1946.&lt;ref name="Post46"&gt;{{cite journal|year = 1946|author = [[Emil Post|E. L. Post]]| title= A variant of a recursively unsolvable problem |journal = Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.| volume =  52|url=http://www.ams.org/bull/1946-52-04/S0002-9904-1946-08555-9/S0002-9904-1946-08555-9.pdf|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1946-08555-9|pages=264–269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it is simpler than the [[halting problem]] and the ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' it is often used in proofs of undecidability.

== Definition of the problem ==

Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be an alphabet with at least two symbols.  The input of the problem consists of two finite lists &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{N}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_{1}, \ldots, \beta_{N}&lt;/math&gt; of words over &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. A solution to this problem is a [[sequence]] of indices &lt;math&gt;(i_k)_{1 \le k \le K}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;K \ge 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; 1 \le i_k \le N&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, such that

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{i_1} \ldots \alpha_{i_K} = \beta_{i_1} \ldots \beta_{i_K}.&lt;/math&gt;

The decision problem then is to decide whether such a solution exists or not.

===Alternative definition===
 

:&lt;math&gt;g: (i_1,\ldots,i_K) \mapsto \alpha_{i_1} \ldots \alpha_{i_K}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;h: (i_1,\ldots,i_K) \mapsto \beta_{i_1} \ldots \beta_{i_K}.&lt;/math&gt;

This gives rise to an equivalent alternative definition often found in the literature, according to which any two homomorphisms &lt;math&gt;g,h&lt;/math&gt; with a common domain and a common codomain form an instance of the Post correspondence problem, which now asks whether there exists a nonempty word &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; in the domain such that

:&lt;math&gt;g(w)=h(w)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Example instances of the problem ==

===Example 1===
Consider the following two lists:
{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break}}
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;background:#55FF83;font-style:italic;"
|-style="font-weight:bold;"
|width=40 | α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|width=40 | α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|width=40 | α&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
|a
|ab
|bba
|}
{{col-break|gap=5px|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;background:#87E6FF;font-style:italic;"
|-style="font-weight:bold;"
|width=40 | β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|width=40 | β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|width=40 | β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
|baa
|aa
|bb
|}
{{col-end}}
A solution to this problem would be the sequence (3, 2, 3, 1), because

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha_3 \alpha_2 \alpha_3 \alpha_1 = bba \cdot ab \cdot bba \cdot a = bbaabbbaa = bb \cdot aa \cdot bb \cdot baa = \beta_{3} \beta_{2} \beta_{3} \beta_{1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, since (3, 2, 3, 1) is a solution, so are all of its "repetitions", such as (3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1), etc.; that is, when a solution exists, there are infinitely many solutions of this repetitive kind.

However, if the two lists had consisted of only &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2, \alpha_3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_{2}, \beta_{3}&lt;/math&gt; from those sets, then there would have been no solution (the last letter of any such α string is not the same as the letter before it, whereas β only constructs pairs of the same letter).

A convenient way to view an instance of a Post correspondence problem is as a collection of blocks of the form
{{col-begin|width=auto}}  
{{col-break}}
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | α&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | β&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;
|}
{{col-end}}
there being an unlimited supply of each type of block. Thus the above example is viewed as
{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | a
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | baa
|}
''i = 1''
{{col-break|gap=5px|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | ab
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | aa
|}
''i = 2''
{{col-break|gap=5px|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | bba
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | bb
|}
''i = 3''
{{col-end}}
where the solver has an endless supply of each of these three block types. A solution corresponds to some way of laying blocks next to each other so that the string in the top cells corresponds to the string in the bottom cells. Then the solution to the above example corresponds to:
{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | bba
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | bb
|}
''i&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 3''

===Example 2===
Again using blocks to represent an instance of the problem, the following is an example that has infinitely many solutions in addition to the kind obtained by merely "repeating" a solution.

{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | bb

In this instance, every sequence of the form (1, 2, 2, . . ., 2, 3) is a solution (in addition to all their repetitions):

==Proof sketch of undecidability ==

The most common proof for the undecidability of PCP describes an instance of PCP that can simulate the computation of an arbitrary [[Turing machine]] on a particular input. A match will occur if and only if the input would be accepted by the Turing machine. Because [[Halting problem|deciding if a Turing machine will accept an input is a basic undecidable problem]], PCP cannot be decidable either. The following discussion is based on [[Michael Sipser]]'s textbook ''Introduction to the Theory of Computation''.&lt;ref name="sipser05"&gt;{{cite book|author = [[Michael Sipser]] | year = 2005 | title = Introduction to the Theory of Computation | edition = 2nd | publisher = Thomson Course Technology | isbn = 0-534-95097-3 | chapter = A Simple Undecidable Problem | pages = 199&amp;ndash;205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more detail, the idea is that the string along the top and bottom will be a [[computation history]] of the Turing machine's computation. This means it will list a string describing the initial state, followed by a string describing the next state, and so on until it ends with a string describing an accepting state. The state strings are separated by some separator symbol (usually written #). According to the definition of a Turing machine, the full state of the machine consists of three parts:
* The current contents of the tape.
* The current state of the [[finite state machine]] which operates the tape head.
* The current position of the tape head on the tape.
Although the tape has infinitely many cells, only some finite prefix of these will be non-blank. We write these down as part of our state. To describe the state of the finite control, we create new symbols, labelled ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; through ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, for each of the finite state machine's ''k'' states. We insert the correct symbol into the string describing the tape's contents at the position of the tape head, thereby indicating both the tape head's position and the current state of the finite control. For the alphabet {0,1}, a typical state might look something like:

101101110''q''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;00110.

A simple computation history would then look something like this:

''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;101#1''q''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;01#11''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;1#1''q''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;10.

We start out with this block, where ''x'' is the input string and ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the start state:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | &amp;nbsp;
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''x''#
|}

The top starts out "lagging" the bottom by one state, and keeps this lag  until the very end stage. Next, for each symbol ''a'' in the tape alphabet, as well as #, we have a "copy" block, which copies it unmodified from one state to the next:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | ''a''
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | ''a''
|}

We also have a block for each position transition the machine can make, showing how the tape head moves, how the finite state changes, and what happens to the surrounding symbols. For example, here the tape head is over a 0 in state 4, and then writes a 1 and moves right, changing to state 7:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | ''q''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;0
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | 1''q''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;
|}

Finally, when the top reaches an accepting state, the bottom needs a chance to finally catch up to complete the match. To allow this, we extend the computation so that once an accepting state is reached, each subsequent machine step will cause a symbol near the tape head to vanish, one at a time, until none remain. If ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; is an accepting state, we can represent this with the following transition blocks, where ''a'' is a tape alphabet symbol:

{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;''a''
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;
|}
{{col-break|gap=5px|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | ''aq''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;
|}
{{col-end}}

There are a number of details to work out, such as dealing with boundaries between states, making sure that our initial tile goes first in the match, and so on, but this shows the general idea of how a static tile puzzle can simulate a Turing machine computation.

The previous example

''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;101#1''q''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;01#11''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;1#1''q''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;10.

== Variants ==

Many variants of PCP have been considered. One reason is that, when one tries to prove undecidability of some new problem by reducing from PCP, it often happens that the first reduction one finds is not from PCP itself but from an apparently weaker version. Also note that if one removes ''correspondence'', the [https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/4284/post-correspondence-problem-variant problem becomes decidable].

* The problem may be phrased in terms of [[monoid morphism]]s ''f'', ''g'' from the free monoid ''B''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; to the free monoid ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; where ''B'' is of size ''n''.  The problem is to determine whether there is a word ''w'' in ''B''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; such that ''f''(''w'') = ''g''(''w'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Arto | last=Salomaa | authorlink=Arto Salomaa | title=Jewels of Formal Language Theory | publisher=Pitman Publishing | isbn=0-273-08522-0 | year=1981 | zbl=0487.68064 | pages=74–75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The condition that the alphabet &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; have at least two symbols is required since the problem is decidable if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has only one symbol.
* A simple variant is to fix ''n'', the number of tiles. This problem is decidable if ''n'' ≤ 2, but remains undecidable for ''n'' ≥ 5. It is unknown whether the problem is decidable for 3 ≤ ''n'' ≤ 4.&lt;ref name="N15"&gt;{{cite conference|author = T. Neary|year=2015|title=Undecidability in Binary Tag Systems and the Post Correspondence Problem for Five Pairs of Words|conference=STACS 2015|book-title=32nd International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science (STACS 2015)|editor=Ernst W. Mayr and Nicolas Ollinger|publisher=Schloss Dagstuhl–Leibniz-Zentrum fuer Informatik|volume=30|pages=649–661|doi=10.4230/LIPIcs.STACS.2015.649|url=http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2015/4948/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''''circular'' Post correspondence problem''' asks whether indexes &lt;math&gt;i_1, i_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; can be found such that &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{i_1} \cdots \alpha_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_{i_1} \cdots \beta_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt; are [[conjugacy|conjugate words]], i.e., they are equal modulo rotation. This variant is undecidable.&lt;ref name="Ruohonen83"&gt;{{cite journal|author= K. Ruohonen |year =1983|title=On some variants of Post's correspondence problem|publisher=Springer|volume=19|issue=4|pages=357&amp;ndash;367|journal=Acta Informatica | doi = 10.1007/BF00290732}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* One of the most important variants of PCP is the '''''bounded'' Post correspondence problem''', which asks if we can find a match using no more than ''k'' tiles, including repeated tiles. A brute force search solves the problem in time O(2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;), but this may be difficult to improve upon, since the problem is [[NP-complete]].&lt;ref name="GJ79"&gt;{{cite book|author = [[Michael R. Garey]]|author2=[[David S. Johnson]]  | year = 1979 | title = [[Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness]] | publisher = W.H. Freeman | isbn = 0-7167-1045-5 | page = 228 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike some NP-complete problems like the [[boolean satisfiability problem]], a small variation of the bounded problem was also shown to be complete for RNP, which means that it remains hard even if the inputs are chosen at random (it is hard on average over uniformly distributed inputs).&lt;ref name="Gurevich91"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Y. Gurevich|journal = J. Comp. Sys. Sci.|year = 1991|pages = 346–398|volume=42|title= Average case completeness|publisher=Elsevier Science|doi = 10.1016/0022-0000(91)90007-R|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another variant of PCP is called the '''''marked'' Post Correspondence Problem''', in which each &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; must begin with a different symbol, and each &lt;math&gt;\beta_i&lt;/math&gt; must also begin with a different symbol. Halava, Hirvensalo, and de Wolf showed that this variation is decidable in [[EXPTIME|exponential time]]. Moreover, they showed that if this requirement is slightly loosened so that only one of the first two characters need to differ (the so-called 2-marked Post Correspondence Problem), the problem becomes undecidable again.&lt;ref name="HHW01"&gt;{{cite journal|author = V. Halava |author2=M. Hirvensalo |author3=R. de Wolf|year=2001|title=Marked PCP is decidable|journal=Theor. Comput. Sci.|publisher=Elsevier Science|volume=255|pages=193–204|doi=10.1016/S0304-3975(99)00163-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Post Embedding Problem''' is another variant where one looks for indexes &lt;math&gt;i_1, i_2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{i_1} \cdots \alpha_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[substring|(scattered) subword]] of &lt;math&gt;\beta_{i_1} \cdots \beta_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt;. This variant is easily decidable since, when some solutions exist, in particular  a length-one solution exists. More interesting is the '''''Regular'' Post Embedding Problem''', a further variant where one looks for solutions  that belong to a given regular language (submitted, e.g., under the form of a regular expression on the set &lt;math&gt;\{1,\ldots,N\}&lt;/math&gt;). The Regular Post Embedding Problem is still decidable but,  because of the added regular constraint, it has a very high complexity that dominates every multiply recursive function.&lt;ref name="CS07"&gt;{{cite journal|author = P. Chambart|author2=Ph. Schnoebelen|title = Post embedding problem is not primitive recursive, with applications to channel systems|year = 2007|journal = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|volume =4855|pages=265–276|publisher=Springer|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-77050-3_22|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|isbn = 978-3-540-77049-7|url=http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/Publis/PAPERS/PDF/CS-fsttcs07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Identity Correspondence Problem''' (ICP) asks whether a finite set of pairs of words (over a group alphabet) can generate an identity pair by a sequence of concatenations. The problem is undecidable and equivalent to the following Group Problem:  is the semigroup generated by a finite set of pairs of words (over a group alphabet) a group.&lt;ref name="BP10"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Paul C.

'''Pre-algebra''' is a common name for a [[course (education)|course]] in [[middle school]] [[mathematics]]. In the [[United States]], pre-algebra is usually taught in the [[8th grade]]&lt;ref&gt;In the ''Introduction'' to their book on pre-algebra, {{harvtxt|Szczepanski|Kositsky|2008}} say that "the math in this book should match what's taught in many middle school classrooms in California, Florida, New York, Texas, and other states". (p. xix)&lt;/ref&gt;. The objective of it is to prepare students for the study of [[algebra]].

Pre-algebra includes several broad subjects:
* Review of [[natural number]] [[arithmetic]]
* New types of numbers such as [[integer]]s, [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]], [[decimal]]s and [[negative number]]s
* [[Integer factorization|Factorization]] of [[natural number]]s
* Properties of operations such as [[associativity]] and [[distributivity]]
* Simple (integer) roots and powers
* Rules of evaluation of expressions, such as operator precedence and use of [[parentheses]]
* Basics of [[equation]]s, including rules for invariant manipulation of equations
* Understanding of [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] manipulation
* Manipulation and arithmetic with the standard [[4-quadrant Cartesian coordinate plane]]

Pre-algebra may include subjects from [[geometry]], especially subjects that further understanding of algebra in applications to [[area]] and [[volume]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24644">In the field of [[representation theory]] in [[mathematics]], a '''projective representation''' of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' on a [[vector space]] ''V'' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''F'' is a [[group homomorphism]] from ''G'' to the [[projective linear group]]
:PGL(''V'') = GL(''V'') / ''F''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;,
where GL(''V'') is the [[general linear group]] of invertible linear transformations of ''V'' over ''F'', and ''F''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[normal subgroup]] consisting of nonzero scalar multiples of the identity; [[scalar transformation]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gannon|2006|pp=176–179}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In more concrete terms, a projective representation is a collection of operators &lt;math&gt;\rho(g),\, g\in G&lt;/math&gt;, where it is understood that each &lt;math&gt;\rho(g)&lt;/math&gt; is only defined up to multiplication by a constant. These should satisfy the homomorphism property up to a constant:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho(g)\rho(h)=c(g,h)\rho(gh)&lt;/math&gt;
for some constants &lt;math&gt;c(g,h)&lt;/math&gt;.

Since each &lt;math&gt;\rho(g)&lt;/math&gt; is only defined up to a constant anyway, it does not strictly speaking make sense to ask whether the constants &lt;math&gt;c(g,h)&lt;/math&gt; are equal to 1. Nevertheless, one can ask whether it is ''possible to choose'' a particular representative of each family &lt;math&gt;\rho(g)&lt;/math&gt; of operators in such a way that the &lt;math&gt;\rho(g)&lt;/math&gt;'s satisfy the homomorphism property on the nose, not just up to a constant. If such a choice is possible, we say that &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; can be "de-projectivized," or that &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; can be "lifted to an ordinary representation." This possibility is discussed further below.

==Linear representations and projective representations==

One way in which a projective representation can arise is by taking a linear [[group representation]] of {{math|''G''}} on {{math|''V''}} and applying the quotient map

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{GL}(V,F) \rightarrow \operatorname{PGL}(V, F)&lt;/math&gt;

which is the quotient by the subgroup {{math|''F''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} of [[scalar transformation]]s ([[diagonal matrices]] with all diagonal entries equal). The interest for algebra is in the process in the other direction: given a ''projective representation'', try to 'lift' it to an ordinary ''linear representation''. A general projective representation {{math|''ρ'': ''G'' → PGL(''V'')}} cannot be lifted to a linear representation {{math|''G'' → GL(''V'')}}, and the [[obstruction theory|obstruction]] to this lifting can be understood via group homology, as described below. 

However, one ''can'' lift a projective representation &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; of {{math|''G''}} to a linear representation of a different group {{math|''H''}}, which will be a [[central extension (mathematics)|central extension]] of {{math|''G''}}. The group &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G\times\mathrm{GL}(V)&lt;/math&gt; defined as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;H=\{(g,A)\in G\times\mathrm{GL}(V)|\,\pi(A)=\rho(g)\}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient map of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{GL}(V)&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PGL}(V)&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is a homomorphism, it is easy to check that &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is, indeed, a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G\times\mathrm{GL}(V)&lt;/math&gt;. If the original projective representation &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is faithful, then &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to the preimage in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{GL}(V)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\rho(G)\subset\mathrm{GL}(V)&lt;/math&gt;.

We can define a homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\phi:H\rightarrow G&lt;/math&gt; by setting &lt;math&gt;\phi((g,A))=g&lt;/math&gt;. The kernel of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ker}(\phi)=\{(e,cI)|c\in F^*\}&lt;/math&gt;,
which is contained in the center of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. It is clear also that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is surjective, so that &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a central extension of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. We can also define an ordinary representation &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; by setting &lt;math&gt;\sigma((g,A))=A&lt;/math&gt;. The ''ordinary'' representation &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a lift of the ''projective'' representation &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the sense that:
:&lt;math&gt;\pi(\sigma((g,A)))=\rho(A)=\rho(\phi((g,A))&lt;/math&gt;.

If {{math|''G''}} is a [[perfect group]] there is a single [[universal perfect central extension]] of {{math|''G''}} that can be used.

===Group cohomology===
The analysis of the lifting question involves [[group cohomology]]. Indeed, if one fixes for each {{math|''g''}} in {{math|''G''}} a lifted element {{math|''L''(''g'')}} in lifting from {{math|PGL(''V'')}} back to {{math|GL(''V'')}}, the lifts then satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;L(gh) = c(g,h)L(g)L(h)&lt;/math&gt;

for some scalar {{math|''c''(''g'',''h'')}} in {{math|''F''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}}. It follows that the 2-cocycle or [[Schur multiplier]] {{math|''c''}} satisfies the cocycle equation

:&lt;math&gt; c(h,k)c(g,hk)= c(g,h) c(gh,k)&lt;/math&gt;

for all {{math|''g'', ''h'', ''k''}} in {{math|''G''}}. This {{math|''c''}} depends on the choice of the lift {{math|''L''}}; a different choice of lift {{math|''L&amp;prime;''(''g'') {{=}} ''f''(''g'') ''L''(''g'')}} will result in a different cocycle

:&lt;math&gt;c^\prime(g,h) = f(gh)f(g)^{-1} f(h)^{-1} c(g,h)&lt;/math&gt;

cohomologous to {{math|''c''}}.  Thus {{math|''L''}} defines a unique class in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''G'', ''F''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. This class might not be trivial. For example, in the case of the [[symmetric group]] and [[alternating group]], Schur established that there is exactly one non-trivial class of Schur multiplier, and completely determined all the corresponding irreducible representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schur|1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, a nontrivial class leads to an [[extension problem]] for {{math|''G''}}. If {{math|''G''}} is correctly extended we obtain a linear representation of the extended group, which induces the original projective representation when pushed back down to {{math|''G''}}. The solution is always a [[Group extension#Central extension|central extension]]. From [[Schur's lemma]], it follows that the [[irreducible representation]]s of central extensions of {{math|''G''}}, and the irreducible projective representations of {{math|''G''}}, are essentially the same objects.

==First example: discrete Fourier transform==
Consider the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z/p&lt;/math&gt; of integers mod &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is prime, and let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be the &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional space of functions on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z/p&lt;/math&gt; with values in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb C&lt;/math&gt;. For each &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z/p&lt;/math&gt;, define two operators, &lt;math&gt;T_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_a&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;(T_a f)(b)=f(b - a)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(S_a f)(b)=e^{2\pi i a b/p}f(b)&lt;/math&gt;.
We write the formula for &lt;math&gt;S_a&lt;/math&gt; as if &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; were integers, but it is easily seen that the result only depends on the value of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; mod &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. The operator &lt;math&gt;T_a&lt;/math&gt; is a translation, while &lt;math&gt;S_a&lt;/math&gt; is a shift in frequency space (that is, it has the effect of translating the [[discrete Fourier transform]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;).

One may easily verify that for any &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z/p&lt;/math&gt;, the operators &lt;math&gt;T_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_b&lt;/math&gt; commute up to multiplication by a constant:
:&lt;math&gt;T_a S_b =e^{-2\pi i a b/p}S_b T_a&lt;/math&gt;.

We may therefore define a projective representation &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z/p\times \mathbb Z/p&lt;/math&gt; as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho(a,b)=[T_a S_b]&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;[A]&lt;/math&gt; denotes the image of an operator &lt;math&gt;A\in\mathrm{GL}(V)&lt;/math&gt; in the quotient group &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PGL}(V)&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;T_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_b&lt;/math&gt; commute up to a constant, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is easily seen to be a projective representation. On the other hand, since &lt;math&gt;T_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_b&lt;/math&gt; do not actually commute—and no nonzero multiples of them will commute—&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; cannot be lifted to an ordinary (linear) representation of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z/p\times \mathbb Z/p&lt;/math&gt;.

Since the projective representation &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is faithful, the central extension &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z/p\times \mathbb Z/p&lt;/math&gt; obtained by the construction in the previous section is just the preimage in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{GL}(V)&lt;/math&gt; of the image of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;. Explicitly, this means that &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the group of all operators of the form
:&lt;math&gt;e^{2\pi ic/p}T_aS_b&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;a,b,c\in\mathbb Z/p&lt;/math&gt;. This group is a discrete version of the [[Heisenberg group]] and is isomorphic to the group of matrices of the form

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
 1 &amp; a &amp; c\\
 0 &amp; 1 &amp; b\\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;a,b,c\in\mathbb Z/p&lt;/math&gt;.

==Projective representations of Lie groups==
{{see also|Spinor|Spin-½}}
Studying projective representations of [[Lie group]]s leads one to consider true representations of their central extensions (see [[Group extension#Lie groups]]). In many cases of interest it suffices to consider representations of [[covering group]]s. Specifically, suppose &lt;math&gt;\hat G&lt;/math&gt; is a connected cover of a connected Lie group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;G\cong \hat G/N&lt;/math&gt; for a discrete central subgroup &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\hat G&lt;/math&gt;. (Note that &lt;math&gt;\hat G&lt;/math&gt; is a special sort of central extension of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.) Suppose also that &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; is an irreducible unitary representation of &lt;math&gt;\hat G&lt;/math&gt; (possibly infinite dimensional). Then by [[Schur's lemma]], the central subgroup &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; will act by scalar multiples of the identity. Thus, at the projective level, &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; will descend to &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. That is to say, for each &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;, we can choose a preimage &lt;math&gt;\hat g&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\hat g&lt;/math&gt;, and define a projective representation &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; by setting
:&lt;math&gt;\rho(g)=[\Pi(\hat g)]&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;[A]&lt;/math&gt; denotes the image in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PGL}(V)&lt;/math&gt; of an operator &lt;math&gt;A\in\mathrm{GL}(V)&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is contained in the center of &lt;math&gt;\hat G&lt;/math&gt; and the center of &lt;math&gt;\hat G&lt;/math&gt; acts as scalars, the value of &lt;math&gt;[\Pi(\hat g)]&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on the choice of &lt;math&gt;\hat g&lt;/math&gt;.

The preceding construction is an important source of examples of projective representations. Bargmann's theorem (discussed below) gives a criterion under which ''every'' irreducible projective unitary representation of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; arises in this way.

===Projective representations of SO(3)===
A physically important example of the above construction comes from the case of the [[rotation group SO(3)]], whose [[Rotation_group_SO(3)#Connection_between_SO(3)_and_SU(2)|universal cover is SU(2)]]. According to the [[representation theory of SU(2)]], there is exactly one irreducible representation of SU(2) in each dimension. When the dimension is odd (the "integer spin" case), the representation descends to an ordinary representation of SO(3).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 4.7&lt;/ref&gt; When the dimension is even (the "fractional spin" case), the representation does not descend to an ordinary representation of SO(3) but does (by the result discussed above) descend to a projective representation of SO(3). Such projective representations of SO(3) (the ones that do not come from ordinary representations) are referred to as "spinorial representations."

By an argument discussed below, every finite-dimensional, irreducible ''projective'' representation of SO(3) comes from a finite-dimensional, irreducible ''ordinary'' representation of SU(2).

===Examples of covers, leading to projective representations===
Notable cases of covering groups giving interesting projective representations:

* The [[special orthogonal group]] SO(''n'',''F'') is doubly covered by the [[Spin group]] Spin(''n'',''F'').  
*In particular, the [[rotation group SO(3)|group SO(3)]] (the rotation group in 3 dimensions) is doubly covered by [[special unitary group|SU(2)]].  This has important applications in quantum mechanics, as the [[representation theory of SU(2)|study of representations of SU(2)]] leads to a nonrelativistic (low-velocity) theory of [[spin (physics)|spin]].
* The group [[Lorentz group|SO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(3;1)]], isomorphic to the [[Möbius group]], is likewise doubly covered by [[special linear group|SL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]('''C'''). Both are supergroups of aforementioned SO(3) and SU(2) respectively and form a [[special relativity|relativistic]] spin theory.
*The universal cover of the [[Poincaré group]] is a double cover (the semidirect of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}(2;\mathbb C)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^4&lt;/math&gt;). The irreducible unitary representations of this cover give rise to projective representations of the Poincaré group, as in [[Wigner's classification]]. Passing to the cover is essential, in order to include the fractional spin case.
* The [[orthogonal group]] O(''n'') is double covered by the [[Pin group]] Pin&lt;sub&gt;±&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'').
* The [[symplectic group]] Sp(2''n'') is double covered by the [[metaplectic group]] Mp(2''n''). An important projective representation of Sp(2''n'') comes from the [[Oscillator representation|metaplectic representation]] of Mp(2''n'').

===Finite-dimensional projective unitary representations===
In quantum physics, [[Symmetry in quantum mechanics|symmetry]] of a physical system is typically implemented by means of a projective unitary representation &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; of a Lie group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; on the quantum Hilbert space, that is, a continuous homomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;\rho:G\rightarrow\mathrm{PU}(\mathcal H)&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PU}(\mathcal H)&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient of the unitary group &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{U}(\mathcal H)&lt;/math&gt; by the operators of the form &lt;math&gt;cI,\,|c|=1&lt;/math&gt;. The reason for taking the quotient is that physically, two vectors in the Hilbert space that differ by a constant represent the same physical state. [That is to say, the space of (pure) states is the set of equivalence classes of unit vectors that differ by a constant.] Thus, a unitary operator that is a multiple of the identity actually acts as the identity on the level of physical states. 

A finite-dimensional projective representation of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; then gives rise to a projective unitary representation &lt;math&gt;\rho_*&lt;/math&gt; of the Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. In the finite-dimensional case, it is always possible to "de-projectivize" the Lie-algebra representation &lt;math&gt;\rho_*&lt;/math&gt; simply by choosing a representative for each &lt;math&gt;\rho_*(X)&lt;/math&gt; having trace zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Proposition 16.46&lt;/ref&gt; In light of the [[Lie_group–Lie_algebra_correspondence#The_correspondence|homomorphisms theorem]], it is then possible to de-projectivize &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; itself, but at the expense of passing to the universal cover &lt;math&gt;\tilde G&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Theorem 16.47&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, every finite-dimensional projective unitary representation of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; arises from an ordinary unitary representation of &lt;math&gt;\hat G&lt;/math&gt; by the procedure mentioned at the beginning of this section. 

Specifically, since the Lie-algebra representation was de-projectivized by choosing a trace-zero representative, every finite-dimensional projective unitary representation of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; arises from a ''determinant-one'' ordinary unitary representation of &lt;math&gt;\hat G&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., one in which each element of &lt;math&gt;\hat G&lt;/math&gt; acts as an operator with determinant one). If &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; is semisimple, then every element of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; is a linear combination of commutators, in which case ''every'' representation of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; is by operators with trace zero. In the semisimple case, then, the associated linear representation of &lt;math&gt;\hat G&lt;/math&gt; is unique.

Conversely, if &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is an ''irreducible'' unitary representation of the universal cover &lt;math&gt;\tilde G&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, then by [[Schur's lemma]], the center of &lt;math&gt;\tilde G&lt;/math&gt; acts as scalar multiples of the identity. Thus, at the projective level, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; descends to a projective representation of the original group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, there is a natural one-to-one correspondence between the irreducible projective representations of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and the irreducible, determinant-one ordinary representations of &lt;math&gt;\hat G&lt;/math&gt;. (In the semisimple case, the qualifier "determinant-one" may be omitted, because in that case, every representation of &lt;math&gt;\hat G&lt;/math&gt; is automatically determinant one.)

An important example is the case of [[Rotation group SO(3)|SO(3)]], whose universal cover is [[Rotation_group_SO(3)#Connection_between_SO(3)_and_SU(2)|SU(2)]]. Now, the Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{su}(2)&lt;/math&gt; is semisimple. Furthermore, since SU(2) is a [[compact group]], every finite-dimensional representation of it admits an inner product with respect to which the representation is unitary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} proof of Theorem 4.28&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the irreducible ''projective'' representations of SO(3) are in one-to-one correspondence with the irreducible ''ordinary'' representations of SU(2).

===Infinite-dimensional projective unitary representations: The Heisenberg case===
The results of the previous subsection do not hold in the infinite-dimensional case, simply because the trace of &lt;math&gt;\rho_*(X)&lt;/math&gt; is typically not well defined. Indeed, the result fails: Consider, for example, the translations in position space and in momentum space for a quantum particle moving in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt;, acting on the Hilbert space &lt;math&gt;L^2(\mathbb R^n)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Example 16.56&lt;/ref&gt; These operators are defined as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;(T_af)(x)=f(x-a)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(S_af)(x)=e^{iax}f(x)&lt;/math&gt;,
for all &lt;math&gt;a\in\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt;. These operators are simply continuous versions of the operators &lt;math&gt;T_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_a&lt;/math&gt; described in the "First example" section above. As in that section, we can then define a ''projective'' unitary representation &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho(a,b)=[T_aS_b]&lt;/math&gt;,
because the operators commute up to a phase factor. But no choice of the phase factors will lead to an ordinary unitary representation, since translations in position do not commute with translations in momentum (and multiplying by a nonzero constant will not change this). These operators do, however, come from an ordinary unitary representation of the [[Heisenberg group]], which is a one-dimensional central extension of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Exercise 6 in Chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt; (See also the [[Stone–von Neumann theorem]].)

===Infinite-dimensional projective unitary representations: Bargmann's theorem===
On the other hand, [[Valentine Bargmann|Bargmann's]] theorem states that if the two-dimensional [[Lie algebra cohomology]] &lt;math&gt;H^2(\mathfrak g;\mathbb R)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; is trivial, then every projective unitary representation of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; can be de-projectivized after passing to the universal cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bargmann|1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simms|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, suppose we begin with a projective unitary representation &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; of a Lie group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then the theorem states that &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; can be lifted to an ordinary unitary representation &lt;math&gt;\hat\rho&lt;/math&gt; of the universal cover &lt;math&gt;\hat G&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. This means that &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; maps each element of the kernel of the covering map to a scalar multiple of the identity—so that at the projective level, &lt;math&gt;\hat\rho&lt;/math&gt; descends to &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;—and that the associated projective representation of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;.

The theorem does not apply to the group &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;—as the previous example shows—because the two-dimensional cohomology of the associated commutative Lie algebra is nontrivial. Examples where the result does apply include semisimple groups (e.g., [[Representation_theory_of_SL2(R)|SL(2,R)]]) and the [[Poincaré group]]. This last result is important for [[Wigner's classification]] of the projective unitary representations of the Poincaré group.

The proof of Bargmann's theorem goes by considering a [[central extension (mathematics)|central extension]] &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, constructed similarly to the section above on linear representations and projective representations, as a subgroup of the direct product group &lt;math&gt;G\times U(\mathcal H)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal H&lt;/math&gt; is the Hilbert space on which &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; acts and &lt;math&gt;U(\mathcal H)&lt;/math&gt; is the group of unitary operators on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal H&lt;/math&gt;. The group &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;H=\{(g,U)|\pi(U)=\rho(g)\}&lt;/math&gt;.
As in the earlier section, the map &lt;math&gt;\phi:H\rightarrow G&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;\phi(g,A)=g&lt;/math&gt; is a surjective homomorphism whose kernel is &lt;math&gt;\{(e,cI)\,|c|=1\},&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a central extension of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Again as in the earlier section, we can then define a linear representation &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; by setting &lt;math&gt;\sigma(g,U)=U&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a lift of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; in the sense that &lt;math&gt;\rho\circ\phi=\sigma\circ\pi&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is the quotient map from &lt;math&gt;U(\mathcal H)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;PU(\mathcal H)&lt;/math&gt;. 

A key technical point is to show that &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a ''Lie'' group. (This claim is not so obvious, because if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal H&lt;/math&gt; is infinite dimensional, the group &lt;math&gt;G\times U(\mathcal H)&lt;/math&gt; is an infinite-dimensional topological group.) Once this result is established, we see that &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a one-dimensional Lie group central extension of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, so that the Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is also a one-dimensional central extension of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt;. But the cohomology group &lt;math&gt;H^2(\mathfrak g;\mathbb R)&lt;/math&gt; [[Lie_algebra_cohomology#Cohomology_in_small_dimensions|may be identified]] with the space of one-dimensional central extensions of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt;; if &lt;math&gt;H^2(\mathfrak g;\mathbb R)&lt;/math&gt; is trivial then every one-dimensional central extension of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; is trivial. In that case, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h&lt;/math&gt; is just the direct sum of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; with a copy of the real line. It follows that the universal cover &lt;math&gt;\hat H&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; must be just a direct product of the universal cover of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with a copy of the real line. We can then lift &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\hat H&lt;/math&gt; (by composing with the covering map) and finally restrict this lift to the universal cover of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5196">'''Proxy re-encryption''' ('''PRE''') schemes are [[cryptosystems]] which allow third parties ([[proxy server|proxies]]) to alter a [[ciphertext]] which has been [[encryption|encrypted]] for one party, so that it may be decrypted by another.

==Examples of use==
{{Expert-subject|Cryptography|section|date=June 2007}}
A proxy re-encryption is generally used when one party, say Bob, wants to reveal the contents of messages sent to him and encrypted with his public key to a third party, Chris, without revealing his private key to Chris. Bob does not want the proxy to be able to read the contents of his messages. &lt;ref&gt;Nabeel's Blog, Seen Nov 2014, http://mohamednabeel.blogspot.ca/2011/03/proxy-re-encryption.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
Bob could designate a proxy to re-encrypt one of his messages that is to be sent to Chris.  This generates a new [[Key (cryptography)|key]] that Chris can use to decrypt the message.  Now if Bob sends Chris a message that was encrypted under Bob's key, the proxy will alter the message, allowing Chris to decrypt it.  This method allows for a number of applications such as [[e-mail forwarding]], law-enforcement monitoring, and content distribution.

A weaker re-encryption scheme is one in which the proxy possesses both parties' keys simultaneously.  One key decrypts a [[plaintext]], while the other encrypts it.  Since the goal of many proxy re-encryption schemes is to avoid revealing either of the keys or the underlying plaintext to the proxy, this method is not ideal.

==Defining functions==
Proxy re-encryption schemes are similar to traditional [[Symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric]] or [[Public-key cryptography|asymmetric encryption]] schemes, with the addition of two functions:
* '''Delegation''' – allows a message recipient (keyholder) to generate a re-encryption key based on his secret key and the key of the delegated user. This re-encryption key is used by the proxy as input to the re-encryption function, which is executed by the proxy to translate ciphertexts to the delegated user's key. Asymmetric proxy re-encryption schemes come in bi-directional and uni-directional varieties.
** In a ''bi-directional scheme'', the re-encryption scheme is reversible—that is, the re-encryption key can be used to translate messages from Bob to Charlie, as well as from Charlie to Bob. This can have various security consequences, depending on the application. One notable characteristic of bi-directional schemes is that both the delegator and delegated party (e.g., Charlie and Bob) must combine their secret keys to produce the re-encryption key.
** A ''uni-directional scheme'' is effectively one-way; messages can be re-encrypted from Bob to Charlie, but not the reverse. Uni-directional schemes can be constructed such that the delegated party need not reveal its secret key. For example, Bob could delegate to Charlie by combining his secret key with Charlie's public key.
* '''Transitivity''' – Transitive proxy re-encryption schemes allow for a ciphertext to be re-encrypted an unlimited number of times. For example, a ciphertext might be re-encrypted from Bob to Charlie, and then again from Charlie to David and so on. Non-transitive schemes allow for only one (or a limited number) of re-encryptions on a given ciphertext. Currently, the only known uni-directional, transitive proxy re-encryption is done through the use of [[Homomorphic encryption|Homomorphic Encryption]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://crypto.stanford.edu/craig/craig-thesis.pdf|title=A Fully Homomorphic Encryption System|last=Gentry|first=Craig|publisher=|year=September 2009|isbn=|location=|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Proxy re-encryption should not be confused with [[proxy signatures]], which is a separate construction with a different purpose.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8626">In [[calculus]], a branch of [[mathematics]], the notions of '''one-sided differentiability''' and '''semi-differentiability''' of a [[real number|real]]-valued [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' of a real variable are weaker than [[differentiability]]. Specifically, the function ''f'' is said to be '''right differentiable''' at a point ''a'' if, roughly speaking, a [[derivative (mathematics)|derivative]] can be defined as the function's argument ''x'' moves to the right (increases) from the value ''a'', and '''left differentiable''' at ''a'' if the derivative can be defined as ''x'' moves to the left from ''a''.

==One-dimensional case==
[[File:Right-continuous.svg|thumb|right|This function does not have a derivative at the marked point, as the function is not [[continuous function|continuous]] there. However, it has a right derivative at all points, with &lt;math&gt;\partial_+f(a)&lt;/math&gt; constantly equal to 0.]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''left derivative''' and a '''right derivative''' are [[derivative]]s (rates of change of a function) defined for movement in one direction only (left or right; that is, to lower or higher values) by the argument of a function.

===Definitions===

Let ''f'' denote a real-valued function defined on a subset ''I'' of the real numbers.

If {{math|''a''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''I''}} is a [[limit point]] of {{math|''I''&amp;nbsp;∩}}&amp;nbsp;{{closed-open|''a'',∞}} and the [[one-sided limit]]

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_+f(a):=\lim_{{\scriptstyle x\to a^+\atop\scriptstyle x\in I}}\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}&lt;/math&gt;

exists as a real number, then ''f'' is called '''right differentiable''' at ''a'' and the limit ''∂''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;''f''(''a'') is called the '''right derivative''' of ''f'' at ''a''.

If {{math|''a''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''I''}} is a limit point of {{math|''I''&amp;nbsp;∩}}&amp;nbsp;{{open-closed|–∞,''a''}} and the one-sided limit

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_-f(a):=\lim_{{\scriptstyle x\to a^-\atop\scriptstyle x\in I}}\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}&lt;/math&gt;

exists as a real number, then ''f'' is called '''left differentiable''' at ''a'' and the limit ''∂''&lt;sub&gt;–&lt;/sub&gt;''f''(''a'') is called the '''left derivative''' of ''f'' at ''a''.

If {{math|''a''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''I''}} is a limit point of {{math|''I''&amp;nbsp;∩}}&amp;nbsp;{{closed-open|''a'',∞}} and {{math|''I''&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;{{open-closed|–∞,''a''}}}} and if ''f'' is left and right differentiable at ''a'', then ''f'' is called '''semi-differentiable''' at ''a''.

If the left and right derivatives are equal, then they have the same value as the usual ("bidirectional") derivative. One can also define a [[symmetric derivative]], which equals the [[arithmetic mean]] of the left and right derivatives (when they both exist), so the symmetric derivative may exist when the usual derivative does not.&lt;ref name="Mercer2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter R. Mercer|title=More Calculus of a Single Variable|year=2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4939-1926-0|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remarks and examples===

* A function is [[derivative|differentiable]] at an [[interior point]] ''a'' of its [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] [[if and only if]] it is semi-differentiable at ''a'' and the left derivative is equal to the right derivative. 
* An example of a semi-differentiable function, which is not differentiable, is the [[absolute value]] at ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.
* If a function is semi-differentiable at a point ''a'', it implies that it is continuous at ''a''.
* The [[indicator function]] 1&lt;sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;0,∞)&lt;/sub&gt; is right differentiable at every real ''a'', but discontinuous at zero (note that this indicator function is not left differentiable at zero).

===Application===

If a real-valued, differentiable function ''f'', defined on an interval ''I'' of the real line, has zero derivative everywhere, then it is constant, as an application of the [[mean value theorem]] shows. The assumption of differentiability can be weakened to continuity and one-sided differentiability of ''f''. The version for right differentiable functions is given below, the version for left differentiable functions is analogous.

{{math theorem| Let ''f'' be a real-valued, [[continuous function]], defined on an arbitrary [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] ''I'' of the real line. If ''f'' is right differentiable at every point {{math|''a''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''I''}}, which is not the [[supremum]] of the interval, and if this right derivative is always zero, then ''f'' is [[constant function|constant]].}}

{{math proof| For a [[proof by contradiction]], assume there exist {{math|''a''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''b''}} in ''I'' such that {{math|''f''(''a'')&amp;nbsp;≠ ''f''(''b'')}}. Then

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon:=\frac{|f(b)-f(a)|}{2(b-a)}&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;

Define ''c'' as the [[infimum]] of all those ''x'' in the interval {{open-closed|''a'',''b''}} for which the [[difference quotient]] of ''f'' exceeds ''ε'' in absolute value, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;c=\inf\{\,x\in(a,b]\mid |f(x)-f(a)|&gt;\varepsilon(x-a)\,\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Due to the continuity of ''f'', it follows that {{math|''c''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''b''}} and
{{math|1={{abs|''f''(''c'')&amp;nbsp;– ''f''(''a'')}}&amp;nbsp;= ''ε''(''c''&amp;nbsp;– ''a'')}}. At ''c'' the right derivative of ''f'' is zero by assumption, hence there exists ''d'' in the interval {{open-closed|''c'',''b''}} with {{math|1={{abs|''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;– ''f''(''c'')}}&amp;nbsp;≤ ''ε''(''x''&amp;nbsp;– ''c'')}} for all ''x'' in {{open-closed|''c'',''d''}}. Hence, by the [[triangle inequality]],

:&lt;math&gt;|f(x)-f(a)|\le|f(x)-f(c)|+|f(c)-f(a)|\le\varepsilon(x-a)&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''x'' in {{closed-open|''c'',''d''}}, which contradicts the definition of ''c''.}}

===Differential operators acting to the left or the right===
Another common use is to describe derivatives treated as [[binary operator]]s in [[infix notation]], in which the derivatives is to be applied either to the left or right [[operand]]s.  This is useful, for example, when defining generalizations of the [[Poisson bracket]].  For a pair of functions f and g, the left and right derivatives are respectively defined as
:&lt;math&gt;f \stackrel{\leftarrow }{\partial }_x g = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \cdot g&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f \stackrel{\rightarrow }{\partial }_x g = f \cdot \frac{\partial g}{\partial x}.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[bra–ket notation]], the derivative operator can act on the right operand as the regular derivative or on the left as the negative derivative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 978-0198520115 | title = The Principles of Quantum Mechanics | last1 = Dirac | first1 = Paul | year = 1982 | origyear = 1930 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = USA  | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Higher-dimensional case==

This above definition can be generalized to real-valued functions ''f'' defined on subsets of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; using a weaker version of the [[directional derivative]]. Let ''a'' be an interior point of the domain of ''f''. Then ''f'' is called ''semi-differentiable'' at the point ''a'' if for every direction ''u''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; the limit 

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_uf(a)=\lim_{h\to 0^+}\frac{f(a+h\, u)-f(a)}{h}&lt;/math&gt;

exists as a real number.

Semi-differentiability is thus weaker than [[Gâteaux derivative|Gâteaux differentiability]], for which one takes in the limit above ''h''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0 without restricting ''h'' to only positive values.

(Note that this generalization is not equivalent to the original definition for ''n = 1'' since the concept of one-sided limit points is replaced with the stronger concept of interior points.)

==Properties==

* Any [[convex function]] on a convex [[open set|open subset]] of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is semi-differentiable. 
* While every semi-differentiable function of one variable is continuous; this is no longer true for several variables.

==Generalization==

Instead of real-valued functions, one can consider functions taking values in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; or in a [[Banach space]].

[[Image:Nono - Variazioni canoniche, rhythmic values row.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Six-element [[set (music)|row]] of rhythmic values used in ''Variazioni canoniche'' by [[Luigi Nono]] {{harv|Whittall|2008|loc=165}}]]

In [[music]], '''serialism'''  is a method of [[Musical composition|composition]] using series of pitches, rhythms, dynamics, timbres or other [[aspect of music|musical elements]]. Serialism began primarily with [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s [[twelve-tone technique]], though some of his contemporaries were also working to establish serialism as a form of [[atonality|post-tonal]] thinking. Twelve-tone technique orders the twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]], forming a [[tone row|row]] or series and providing a unifying basis for a composition's [[melody]], [[harmony]], structural progressions, and [[variation (music)|variations]]. Other types of serialism also work with [[set (music)|sets]], collections of objects, but not necessarily with fixed-order series, and extend the technique to other musical dimensions (often called "[[parameter (music)|parameters]]"), such as [[duration (music)|duration]], [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]], and [[timbre]].

The idea of serialism is also applied in various ways in the [[visual arts]], [[design]], and [[architecture]] ({{harvnb|Bandur|2001|loc=5, 12, 74}}; {{harvnb|Gerstner|1964|loc=passim}}), and the musical concept has also been adopted in literature ({{harvnb|Collot|2008|loc=81}}; {{harvnb|Leray|2008|loc=217–19}}; {{harvnb|Waelti-Walters|1992|loc=37, 64, 81, 95}}).

'''Integral serialism''' or '''total serialism''' is the use of series for aspects such as duration, dynamics, and register as well as pitch {{harv|Whittall|2008|loc=273}}. Other terms, used especially in Europe to distinguish post–World War II serial music from twelve-tone music and its American extensions, are '''general serialism''' and '''multiple serialism''' {{harv|Grant|2001|loc=5–6}}.

Composers such as Arnold Schoenberg, [[Anton Webern]], [[Alban Berg]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Luigi Nono]], [[Milton Babbitt]], [[Elisabeth Lutyens]], [[Charles Wuorinen]] and [[Jean Barraqué]] used serial techniques of one sort or another in most of their music.  Other composers such as [[Béla Bartók]], [[Luciano Berio]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[John Cage]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[Arvo Pärt]], [[Walter Piston]], [[Ned Rorem]], [[Alfred Schnittke]], [[Ruth Crawford Seeger]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], and [[Igor Stravinsky]] used serialism only for some of their compositions or only for some sections of pieces, as did some [[jazz]] composers such as [[Yusef Lateef]] and [[Bill Evans]].

==Basic definitions==
Serialism is a method {{harv|Griffiths|2001|loc=116}}, "highly specialized technique" {{harv|Wörner|1973|loc=196}}, or "way" {{harv|Whittall|2008|loc=1}} of [[Musical composition#Composing music|composition]]. It may also be considered, "a philosophy of life (''[[World view|Weltanschauung]]''), a way of relating the human mind to the world and creating a completeness when dealing with a subject" {{harv|Bandur|2001|loc=5}}.

However, serialism is not by itself a system of composition, nor is it a style. Neither is pitch serialism necessarily incompatible with tonality, though it is most often used as a means of composing [[atonality|atonal music]] {{harv|Griffiths|2001|loc=116}}.

"Serial music" is a problematic term because it is used differently in different languages and especially because, shortly after its coinage in French, it underwent essential alterations during its transmission to German {{harv|Frisius|1998|loc=1327}}. The use of the word "serial" in connection with music was first introduced in French by [[René Leibowitz|René]] {{harvtxt|Leibowitz|1947}}, and immediately afterward by [[Humphrey Searle]] in English, as an alternative translation of the German ''Zwölftontechnik'' [[twelve-tone technique]] or ''Reihenmusik'' (row music); it was independently introduced by [[Herbert Eimert]] and Karlheinz Stockhausen into German in 1955 as ''serielle Musik'', with a different meaning {{harv|Frisius|1998|loc=1327}}, translated into English also as "serial music".

===Twelve-tone serialism===
Serialism of the first type is most specifically defined as the structural principle according to which a recurring series of ordered elements (normally a [[Set (music)|set]]—or [[Tone row|row]]—of pitches or [[pitch class]]es) are used in order or manipulated in particular ways to give a piece unity. Serialism is often broadly applied to all music written in what Arnold Schoenberg called "The Method of Composing with Twelve Notes related only to one another" ({{harvnb|Schoenberg|1975|loc=218}}; {{harvnb|Anon.|n.d.}}), or [[Twelve-note technique|dodecaphony]], and methods that evolved from his methods. It is sometimes used more specifically to apply only to music where at least one element other than pitch is subjected to being treated as a row or series. In such usages ''post-Webernian serialism'' will be used to denote works that extend serial techniques to other elements of music. Other terms used to make the distinction are ''twelve-note serialism'' for the former and ''integral serialism'' for the latter.

A row may be assembled pre-compositionally (perhaps to embody particular intervallic or symmetrical properties), or it may be derived from a spontaneously invented thematic or motivic idea. The structure of the row, however, does not in itself define the structure of a composition, which requires development of a comprehensive strategy. The choice of available strategies will of course depend on the relationships contained in a row class, and rows may be constructed with an eye to producing the relationships needed to form desired strategies {{harv|Mead|1985|loc=129–30}}.

The basic set may have additional restrictions, such as the requirement that it use each [[interval (music)|interval]] only once.

===Non-twelve-tone serialism===
{{quote|The series is not an order of succession, but indeed a hierarchy—which may be independent of this order of succession. ({{harvnb|Boulez|1954}},{{Page needed|date=November 2012}}, translated in {{harvnb|Griffiths|1978|loc=37}})}}

Rules of analysis derived from twelve-tone theory do not apply to serialism of the second type: "in particular the ideas, one, that the series is an intervallic sequence, and two, that the rules are consistent" {{harv|Maconie|2005|loc=119}}. Stockhausen, for example, in early serial compositions such as ''[[Kreuzspiel]]'' and ''[[Formel (Stockhausen)|Formel]]'', "advances in unit sections within which a preordained set of pitches is repeatedly reconfigured&amp;nbsp;... The composer's model for the distributive serial process corresponds to a development of the Zwölftonspiel of Josef Matthias Hauer" {{harv|Maconie|2005|loc=56}}, and Goeyvaerts, in such a work as ''Nummer 4'', &lt;blockquote&gt;provides a classic illustration of the distributive function of seriality: 4 times an equal number of elements of equal duration within an equal global time is distributed in the most equable way, unequally with regard to one another, over the temporal space: from the greatest possible coïncidence to the greatest possible dispersion. This provides an exemplary demonstration of that logical principle of seriality: ''every situation must occur once and only once''. {{harv|Sabbe|1977|loc=114}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
For [[Henri Pousseur]], after an initial period working with twelve-tone technique in works like ''Sept Versets'' (1950) and ''Trois Chants sacrés'' (1951), serialism&lt;blockquote&gt;evolved away from this bond in ''Symphonies pour quinze Solistes'' [1954–55] and in the ''Quintette'' [''à la mémoire d’Anton Webern'', 1955], and from around the time of ''Impromptu'' [1955] encounters whole new dimensions of application and new functions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The twelve-tone series loses its imperative function as a prohibiting, regulating, and patterning authority; its working-out is abandoned through  its own constant-frequent presence: all 66 intervallic relations among the 12 pitches being virtually present. Prohibited intervals, like the octave, and prohibited successional relations, such as premature note repetitions, frequently occur, although obscured in the dense contexture. The number twelve no longer plays any governing, defining rôle; the pitch constellations no longer hold to the limitation determined by their formation. The dodecaphonic series loses its significance as a concrete model of shape (or a well-defined collection of concrete shapes) is played out. And the chromatic total remains active only, and provisionally, as a general reference. {{harv|Sabbe|1977|loc=264}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the 1960s Pousseur took this a step further, applying a consistent set of predefined transformations to pre-existent music. One example is the large orchestral work ''Couleurs croisées'' (Crossed Colours, 1967), which performs these transformations on the protest song "[[We Shall Overcome]]", thereby creating a succession of different situations that are sometimes chromatic and dissonant and at other times diatonic and consonant {{harv|Locanto|2010|loc=157}}. In his opera ''[[Votre Faust]]'' (Your Faust, 1960–68) Pousseur used a large number of different quotations, themselves arranged into a "scale" for serial treatment, so as to bring coherence and order to the work. This "generalised" serialism (in the strongest possible sense) aims not to exclude any musical phenomena, no matter how heterogenous, in order "to control the effects of tonal determinism, dialectize its causal functions, and overcome any academic prohibitions, especially the fixing of an anti-grammar meant to replace some previous one" {{harv|Bosseur|1989|loc=60–61}}.

At about the same time, Stockhausen began using serial methods to integrate a variety of musical sources from recorded examples of folk and traditional music from around the world in his electronic composition ''[[Telemusik]]'' (1966), and from [[national anthem]]s in ''[[Hymnen]]'' (1966–67). He extended this serial "polyphony of styles" in a series of "process-plan" works in the late 1960s, as well as later in portions of ''[[Licht]]'', the cycle of seven operas he composed between 1977 and 2003 {{harv|Kohl|2002|loc=97 et passim}}.

==History of serial music==

===Before World War II===
In the late 19th and early 20th century, composers began to struggle against the ordered system of chords and intervals known as "functional [[tonality]]".  Composers such as Debussy and Strauss found differing ways of stretching the limits of the tonal system in order to accommodate their ideas.  After a brief period of free atonality, Arnold Schoenberg and others began exploring tone rows, in which an ordering of the twelve pitches of the equal tempered chromatic scale is used as the source material of a composition.  This ordered set, often called a row, allowed for new forms of expression and (unlike free atonality) the expansion of underlying structural organizing principles without recourse to common practice harmony {{harv|Delahoyde|n.d.}}.

Twelve-tone serialism first appeared in the 1920s, with antecedents predating that decade (instances of twelve-note passages occur in Liszt's ''[[Faust Symphony]]'' {{harvnb|Walker|1986}}, {{Page needed|date=September 2014}} and in Bach {{harvnb|Cope|1971}}, {{Page needed|date=September 2014}}). Schoenberg was the composer most decisively involved in devising and demonstrating the fundamentals of twelve-tone serialism, though it is clear it is not the work of just one musician  {{harv|Whittall|2008|loc=1}}.

===After World War II===
Serialism, along with [[John Cage]]'s [[indeterminate music]] (music composed with the use of chance operations) and [[Werner Meyer-Eppler]]'s [[Aleatoric music|aleatoricism]], was enormously influential in post-war music. Theorists such as [[George Perle]] codified serial systems, and his 1962 text ''Serial Composition and Atonality'' became a standard work on the origins of serial composition in the work of Schoenberg, Berg, and Webern.

The serialization of [[rhythm]], [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], and other elements of music was partly fostered by the work of Olivier Messiaen and his analysis students, including [[Karel Goeyvaerts]] and Boulez, in post-war [[Paris]].

[[File:Messiaen - Mode de valeurs et d'intensites series upper line -- Boulez - Structures Ia.png|thumb|right|400px|Olivier Messiaen's unordered series for pitch, duration, dynamics, and articulation from the pre-serial ''[[Quatre études de rythme#"Mode de valeurs et d'intensités"|Mode de valeurs et d'intensités]]'', upper division only—which Pierre Boulez adapted as an ordered row for his ''[[Structures I]]'' {{harv|Whittall|2008|loc=178}}]]

Several of the composers associated with Darmstadt, notably Karlheinz Stockhausen, Karel Goeyvaerts, and Henri Pousseur developed a form of serialism that initially rejected the recurring rows characteristic of twelve-tone technique, in order to eradicate any lingering traces of [[Theme (music)|thematicism]] {{harv|Felder|1977|loc=92}}. Instead of a recurring, referential row, "each musical component is subjected to control by a series of numerical proportions" {{harv|Morgan|1975|loc=3}}. In Europe, the style of some serial and non-serial music of the early 1950s emphasized the determination of all parameters for each note independently, often resulting in widely spaced, isolated "points" of sound, an effect called first in German "[[Punctualism|punktuelle]] Musik" ("pointist" or "punctual music"), then in French "musique ponctuelle", but quickly confused with "[[Pointillism|pointillistic]]" (German "pointillistische", French "pointilliste"),  the familiar term associated with the densely packed dots in paintings of [[Seurat]], despite the fact that the conception was at the opposite extreme {{harv|Stockhausen and Frisius|1998|loc=451}}.

Pieces were structured by closed sets of proportions, a method closely related to certain works from the [[de Stijl]] and [[Bauhaus]] movements in design and architecture called "[[serial art]]" by some writers ({{harvnb|Bochner|1967}}; {{harvnb|Gerstner|1964}}; {{harvnb|Guderian|1985}}; {{harvnb|Sykora|1983}}), specifically the paintings of [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Theo van Doesburg]], Bart van Leck, Georg van Tongerloo, Richard Paul Lohse, and [[Burgoyne Diller]], who had been seeking to “avoid repetition and symmetry on all structural levels and working with a limited number of elements” {{harv|Bandur|2001|loc=54}}.

Stockhausen described the final synthesis in this manner:

&lt;blockquote&gt;So serial thinking is something that's come into our consciousness and will be there forever: it's relativity and nothing else. It just says: Use all the components of any given number of elements, don't leave out individual elements, use them all with equal importance and try to find an equidistant scale so that certain steps are no larger than others. It's a spiritual and democratic attitude toward the world. The stars are organized in a serial way. Whenever you look at a certain star sign you find a limited number of elements with different intervals. If we more thoroughly studied the distances and proportions of the stars we'd probably find certain relationships of multiples based on some logarithmic scale or whatever the scale may be. {{harv|Cott|1973|loc=101}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Igor Stravinsky's adoption of twelve-tone serial techniques offers an example of the level of influence that serialism had after the Second World War. Previously Stravinsky had used series of notes without rhythmic or harmonic implications {{harv|Shatzkin|1977}}. Because many of the basic techniques of serial composition have analogs in traditional counterpoint, uses of [[Melodic inversion|inversion]], [[Retrograde (music)|retrograde]], and [[retrograde inversion]] from before the war are not necessarily indicative of Stravinsky adopting Schoenbergian techniques. However with his meeting [[Robert Craft]] and acquaintance with younger composers, Stravinsky began to consciously study Schoenberg's music, as well as the music of Webern and later composers, and began to use the techniques in his own work, using, for example, serial techniques applied to fewer than twelve notes. Over the course of the 1950s he used procedures related to Messiaen, Webern and Berg. While it is difficult to label each and every work as "serial" in the strict definition, every major work of the period has clear uses and references to its ideas.

During this period, the concept of ''serialism'' influenced not only new compositions but also the scholarly analysis of the classical masters.  Adding to their professional tools of [[sonata form]] and [[tonality]], scholars began to analyze previous works in the light of serial techniques; for example they found the use of row technique in previous composers going back to Mozart and Beethoven ({{harvnb|Jalowetz|1944|loc=387}}; {{harvnb|Keller|1955|loc=passim}}).  In particular, the orchestral outburst that introduces the [[Retransition|development section]] half-way through the last movement of [[Symphony No. 40 (Mozart)|Mozart's next-to-last symphony]] is a tone row that Mozart punctuates in a very modern and violent episode that [[Michael Steinberg (music critic)|Michael Steinberg]] called "rude octaves and frozen silences" {{harv|Steinberg|1998|loc=400}}.

[[Ruth Crawford Seeger]] is credited with extending serial controls to parameters other than pitch and to formal planning as early as 1930–33 {{harv|Tick|2001}}.

==Reactions to and against serialism==
{{Quote box|width=30em|salign=right|the first time I ever heard Webern in a concert performance …[t]he impression it made on me was the same as I was to experience a few years later when … I first laid eyes on a [[Piet Mondrian|Mondriaan]] canvas...: those things, of which I had acquired an extremely intimate knowledge, came across as crude and unfinished when seen in reality.|source=[[Karel Goeyvaerts]] on [[Anton Webern]]'s music. {{harv|Goeyvaerts|1994|loc=39}}}}
Some music theorists have criticized serialism on the basis that the compositional strategies employed are often incompatible with the way information is extracted by the human mind from a piece of music. [[Nicolas Ruwet]] (1959) was one of the first to criticise serialism through a comparison with linguistic structures, citing theoretical claims by Boulez and Henri Pousseur, and taking as specific examples bars from Stockhausen's ''[[Klavierstücke (Stockhausen)|Klavierstücke I &amp; II]]'', and calling for a general re-examination of Webern's music. Ruwet specifically names three works as exempt from his criticism: Stockhausen's ''[[Zeitmaße]]'' and ''[[Gruppen (Stockhausen)|Gruppen]]'', and Boulez's ''[[Le marteau sans maître]]'' {{harv|Ruwet|1959|loc=83, 85, 87, 93–96}}.

In response, {{harvtxt|Pousseur|1959}} questioned the equivalence made by Ruwet between phoneme and the single note. He also suggested that, if analysis of ''Le marteau sans maître''  and ''Zeitmaße'', "performed with sufficient insight", were to be made from the point of view of [[wave theory]]—taking into account the dynamic interaction of the different component phenomena, which creates "waves" that interact in a sort of [[frequency modulation]]—this analysis "would accurately reflect the realities of perception". This was because these composers had long since acknowledged the lack of differentiation found in punctual music and, becoming increasingly aware of the laws of perception and complying  better with them, "paved the way to a more effective kind of musical communication, without in the least abandoning the emancipation that they had been allowed to achieve by this 'zero state' that was punctual music". This was achieved, amongst other things, by the development of the concept of "groups", which allows structural relationships to be defined not only between individual notes but also at higher and higher levels, up to the overall form of a piece. This is "a structural method par excellence", and a sufficiently simple conception that it remains easily perceptible {{harv|Pousseur|1959|loc=104–105, 114–15}}. Pousseur also points out that serial composers were the first to recognize and attempt to move beyond the lack of differentiation within certain pointillist works {{harv|Campbell|2010|loc=125}}. Pousseur later followed up his own suggestion, by developing his idea of "wave" analysis and applying it to Stockhausen's ''Zeitmaße'' in two essays, {{harvnb|Pousseur|1970}} and {{harvnb|Pousseur|1997}}.

Later writers have continued both lines of reasoning. [[Fred Lerdahl]], for example, outlines Ruwet's subject further in his essay "[[Cognitive Constraints on Compositional Systems]]" {{harv|Lerdahl|1988}}. Lehrdahl has in turn been criticized for excluding "the possibility of other, non-hierarchical methods of achieving musical coherence," and for concentrating on the audibility of tone rows {{harv|Grant|2001|loc=219}}, and the portion of his essay focussing on Boulez's "multiplication" technique (exemplified in three movements of ''Le Marteau sans maître'') has been challenged on perceptual grounds by Stephen Heinemann (1998) and Ulrich {{harvtxt|Mosch|2004}}. Ruwet's critique has also been criticised for making "the fatal mistake of equating visual presentation (a score) with auditive presentation (the music as heard)" {{harv|Grant|2006|loc=351}}.

Within the community of modern music, exactly what constituted serialism was also a matter of debate. The conventional English usage is that the word "serial" applies to all twelve-tone music, which is a subset of serial music, and it is this usage that is generally intended in reference works. Nevertheless, a large body of music exists that is called "serial" but does not employ note-rows at all, let alone twelve-tone technique, e.g., Stockhausen's ''Klavierstücke I–IV'' (the focus of Ruwet's criticism, they use permuted sets), as well as his ''[[Stimmung]]'' (with pitches from the [[overtone series]], which also is used as the model for the rhythms) and Pousseur's ''[[Scambi]]'' (where the permuted sounds are made exclusively from filtered [[white noise]]).

When serialism is not equated with twelve-tone technique, a contributing problem is that the word "serial" is seldom if ever defined. Nevertheless, there are many published analyses of individual pieces in which the term is used, though examples are merely pointed out and the actual meaning is skated around {{harv|Koenig|1999|loc=298}}.

==Theory of twelve-tone serial music==
{{Main|Twelve-tone technique}}
The vocabulary of serialism eventually became rooted in set theory, and uses a seemingly quasi-mathematical vocabulary to describe how the basic sets are manipulated to produce the final result. Musical [[Set theory (music)|set theory]] is often used to analyze and compose serial music, but may also be used to study [[tonality|tonal music]] and nonserial atonal music.

The basis for serial composition is Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique, where the twelve notes of the basic chromatic scale are organized into a row. This "basic" row is then used to create permutations, that is, rows derived from the basic set by reordering its elements. The row may be used to produce a set of intervals, or a composer may have wanted to use a particular succession of intervals, from which the original row was created. A row that uses all of the intervals in their ascending form once is an [[Tone row#all-interval row|all-interval row]]. In addition to permutations, the basic row may have some set of notes derived from it, which is used to create a new row, these are ''derived sets''.

Because there are tonal chord progressions that use all twelve notes, it is possible to create pitch rows with very strong tonal implications, and even to write tonal music using twelve-tone technique. Most tone rows contain subsets that can imply a [[tonic (music)|pitch center]]; a composer can create music centered on one or more of the row's constituent pitches by emphasizing or avoiding these subsets, respectively, as well as through other, more complex compositional devices ({{harvnb|Newlin|1974}}; {{harvnb|Perle|1977}}).

To serialize other elements of music, a system quantifying an identifiable element must be created or defined (this is called "[[parametrization]]", after the term in mathematics). For example, if duration is to be serialized, then a set of durations must be specified. If [[Timbre|tone colour]] (timbre) is to be serialized, then a set of separate tone colours must be identified, and so on.

The selected set or sets, their permutations and derived sets form the basic material with which the composer works.

Composition using twelve-tone serial methods focuses on each appearance of the collection of twelve chromatic notes, called an [[Total chromatic|aggregate]]. (Sets of more or fewer pitches, or of elements other than pitch may be treated analogously.) The principle is that in a row, no element of the aggregate should be reused until all of the other members have been used, and each member must appear only in its place in the series. This rule is violated in numerous works still termed "serial".{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

An aggregate may be divided into subsets, and all the members of the aggregate not part of any one subset are said to be its ''complement''. A subset is ''self-complementing'' if it contains half of the set and its complement is also a permutation of the original subset. This is most commonly seen with ''hexachords'' or six-note segments from a basic tone row. A hexachord that is self-complementing for a particular permutation is referred to as ''prime combinatorial''. A hexachord that is self-complementing for all of the canonic operations—[[Melodic inversion|inversion]], [[Retrograde (music)|retrograde]], and [[retrograde inversion]]—is referred to as ''all-combinatorial''.

The composer then presents the aggregate. If there are multiple serial sets, or if several parameters are associated with the same set, then a presentation will have these values calculated. Large-scale design may be achieved through the use of combinatorial devices, for example, subjecting a subset of the basic set to a series of combinatorial devices.

In mathematics, the '''Sugeno integral''', named after M.&amp;nbsp;Sugeno,&lt;ref&gt;Sugeno, M., Theory of fuzzy integrals and its applications, Doctoral. Thesis,  Tokyo Institute of Technology, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of integral with respect to a [[fuzzy measure theory|fuzzy measure]].

Let &lt;math&gt;(X,\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[measurable space]] and let &lt;math&gt;h:X\to[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; be an &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;-[[measurable function]].

The Sugeno integral over the [[crisp set]] &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; of the function &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the fuzzy measure &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is defined by:
:: &lt;math&gt;
\int_A h(x) \circ g 
= {\sup_{E\subseteq X}} \left[\min\left(\min_{x\in E} h(x), g(A\cap E)\right)\right]
= {\sup_{\alpha\in [0,1]}} \left[\min\left(\alpha, g(A\cap F_\alpha)\right)\right]
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;F_\alpha = \left\{x | h(x) \geq \alpha \right\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''Sugeno integral over the [[fuzzy set]] &lt;math&gt;\tilde{A}&lt;/math&gt;''' of the function &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the fuzzy measure &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is defined by:

: &lt;math&gt;
\int_A h(x) \circ g 
= \int_X \left[h_A(x) \wedge h(x)\right] \circ g 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;h_A(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the membership function of the fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;\tilde{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3612">The '''T-schema''' ("truth [[schema (logic)|schema]]"; not to be confused with '[[Semantic theory of truth#Convention T|Convention T]]') is used to give an [[Recursive definition|inductive definition]] of truth which lies at the heart of any realisation of [[Alfred Tarski]]'s [[semantic theory of truth]]. Some authors refer to it as the "Equivalence Schema", a synonym introduced by [[Michael Dummett]].&lt;ref name="Künne2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wolfgang Künne|title=Conceptions of truth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uakr0t90ylEC&amp;pg=PA18|year=2003|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-928019-3|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The T-schema is often expressed in [[natural language]], but it can be formalized in [[Predicate logic|many-sorted predicate logic]] or [[modal logic]]; such a formalisation is called a "'''T-theory'''."  T-theories form the basis of much fundamental work in [[philosophical logic]], where they are applied in several important controversies in [[analytic philosophy]].

As expressed in semi-natural language (where 'S' is the name of the sentence abbreviated to S):
'S' is true [[if and only if]] S

Example: 'snow is white' is true if and only if snow is white.

== The inductive definition ==
By using the schema one can give an inductive definition for the truth of compound sentences.  Atomic sentences are assigned [[truth value]]s [[disquotational principle|disquotationally]]. For example, the sentence "'Snow is white' is true" becomes materially equivalent with the sentence "snow is white", i.e. 'snow is white' is true if and only if snow is white. The truth of more complex sentences is defined in terms of the components of the sentence:
* A sentence of the form "A and B" is true if and only if A is true and B is true
* A sentence of the form "A or B" is true if and only if A is true or B is true
* A sentence of the form "if A then B" is true if and only if A is false or B is true; see [[material implication (rule of inference)|material implication]]. 
* A sentence of the form "not A" is true if and only if A is false
* A sentence of the form "for all x, A(''x'')" is true if and only if, for every possible value of ''x'', A(''x'') is true. 
* A sentence of the form "for some x, A(''x'')" is true if and only if, for some possible value of ''x'', A(''x'') is true.

== Natural languages ==
[[Joseph Heath]] points out&lt;ref name="Heath2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Heath|title=Communicative action and rational choice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3i-QXQQOfZQC&amp;pg=PA186|year=2001|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-08291-4|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; that "The analysis of the [[truth predicate]] provided by Tarski's Schema T is not capable of handling all occurrences of the truth predicate in natural language. In particular, Schema T treats only “freestanding” uses of the predicate—cases when it is applied to complete sentences." He gives as "obvious problem" the sentence:
* Everything that Bill believes is true.
Heath argues that analyzing this sentence using T-schema generates the [[sentence fragment]]—“everything that Bill believes”—on the righthand side of the [[biconditional|Logical biconditional]].

A sinusoidal waveform is said to have a '''unity amplitude''' when the amplitude of the wave is equal to 1.

&lt;math&gt;x(t) = a \sin(\theta(t))&lt;/math&gt; 

where &lt;math&gt;a = 1&lt;/math&gt;. This terminology is most commonly used in [[Digital Signal Processing]] and is usually associated with the [[Fourier series]] and [[Fourier Transform]] sinusoids that involve a [[duty cycle]], &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and a defined [[fundamental period]], &lt;math&gt;T_o&lt;/math&gt;.

Analytic signals with unit amplitude satisfy the [[Bedrosian Theorem]] &lt;ref&gt;Huang et. al. On Instantaneous Frequency: http://rcada.ncu.edu.tw/2009%20Vol.1_No.2/1.ON%20INSTANTANEOUS%20FREQUENCY.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

In [[predicate logic]], a '''universal quantification''' is a type of [[Quantification (logic)|quantifier]], a [[logical constant]] which is [[interpretation (logic)|interpreted]] as "given any" or "for all". It expresses that a [[propositional function]] can be [[satisfiability|satisfied]] by every [[element (mathematics)|member]] of a [[domain of discourse]]. In other words, it is the [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predication]] of a [[property (philosophy)|property]] or [[binary relation|relation]] to every member of the domain. It [[logical assertion|asserts]] that a predicate within the [[free variables and bound variables|scope]] of a universal quantifier is true of every [[Valuation (logic)|value]] of a [[predicate variable]].

It is usually denoted by the [[turned A]] (∀) [[logical connective|logical operator]] [[Symbol (formal)|symbol]], which, when used together with a predicate variable, is called a '''universal quantifier''' ("∀x", "∀(x)", or sometimes by {{nowrap|"(x)"}} alone). Universal quantification is distinct from [[existential quantification|''existential'' quantification]] ("there exists"), which only asserts that the property or relation holds for at least one member of the domain.

Quantification in general is covered in the article on [[quantification (logic)]]. Symbols are encoded {{unichar|2200|FOR ALL|note=as a mathematical symbol|html=|ulink=}}.

== Basics ==
Suppose it is given that
&lt;blockquote&gt;2·0 = 0 + 0, and 2·1 = 1 + 1, and 2·2 = 2 + 2, etc.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This would seem to be a [[logical conjunction]] because of the repeated use of "and". However, the "etc." cannot be interpreted as a conjunction in [[formal logic]]. Instead, the statement must be rephrased:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For all natural numbers ''n'', 2·''n'' = ''n'' + ''n''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is a single statement using universal quantification.

This statement can be said to be more precise than the original one. While the "etc." informally includes [[natural number]]s, and nothing more, this was not rigorously given. In the universal quantification, on the other hand, the natural numbers are mentioned explicitly.

This particular example is [[true (logic)|true]], because any natural number could be substituted for ''n'' and the statement "2·''n'' = ''n'' + ''n''" would be true. In contrast,
&lt;blockquote&gt;For all natural numbers ''n'', 2·''n'' &gt; 2 + ''n''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
is [[false (logic)|false]], because if ''n'' is substituted with, for instance, 1, the statement "2·1 &gt; 2 + 1" is false. It is immaterial that "2·''n'' &gt; 2 + ''n''" is true for ''most'' natural numbers ''n'': even the existence of a single [[counterexample]] is enough to prove the universal quantification false.

On the other hand,
for all [[composite number]]s ''n'', 2·''n'' &gt; 2 + ''n''
is true, because none of the counterexamples are composite numbers. This indicates the importance of the ''[[domain of discourse]]'', which specifies which values ''n'' can take.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Further information on using domains of discourse with quantified statements can be found in the [[Quantification (logic)]] article.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, note that if the domain of discourse is restricted to consist only of those objects that satisfy a certain predicate, then for universal quantification this requires a [[logical conditional]]. For example,
&lt;blockquote&gt;For all composite numbers ''n'', 2·''n'' &gt; 2 + ''n''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
is [[logically equivalent]] to
&lt;blockquote&gt;For all natural numbers ''n'', if ''n'' is composite, then 2·''n'' &gt; 2 + ''n''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Here the "if ... then" construction indicates the logical conditional.

=== Notation ===
In [[First-order logic|symbolic logic]], the universal quantifier symbol &lt;math&gt; \forall &lt;/math&gt; (an [[turned A|inverted]]&amp;nbsp;"[[A]]" in a [[sans-serif]] font, Unicode&amp;nbsp;U+2200) is used to indicate universal quantification.&lt;ref&gt;The [[turned A|inverted&amp;nbsp;"A"]] was used in the 19th century by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] as a logical symbol for 'un-American' ("unamerican").

Page 320 in Randall Dipert, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=3suPBY5qh-cC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=Cheryl+Misak,+unamerican&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q=unAmerican&amp;f=false Peirce's deductive logic]". In Cheryl Misak, ed. ''The Cambridge Companion to Peirce''. 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if ''P''(''n'') is the predicate "2·''n'' &gt; 2 + ''n''" and '''N''' is the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of natural numbers, then:
: &lt;math&gt; \forall n\!\in\!\mathbb{N}\; P(n) &lt;/math&gt;

is the (false) statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For all natural numbers ''n'', 2·''n'' &gt; 2 + ''n''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, if ''Q''(''n'') is the predicate "''n'' is composite", then
: &lt;math&gt; \forall n\!\in\!\mathbb{N}\; \bigl( Q(n) \rightarrow  P(n) \bigr) &lt;/math&gt;

is the (true) statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For all natural numbers ''n'', if ''n'' is composite, then 2·''n'' &gt; 2 + n&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and since "''n'' is composite" implies that ''n'' must already be a natural number, we can shorten this statement to the equivalent:
: &lt;math&gt; \forall n\; \bigl( Q(n) \rightarrow P(n) \bigr) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For all composite numbers ''n'', 2·''n'' &gt; 2 + ''n''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Several variations in the notation for quantification (which apply to all forms) can be found in the [[Quantification (logic)|quantification]] article. There is a special notation used only for universal quantification, which is given:
: &lt;math&gt; (n{\in}\mathbb{N})\, P(n) &lt;/math&gt;

The parentheses indicate universal quantification by default.

== Properties ==

&lt;!-- ''We need a list of algebraic properties of universal quantification, such as distributivity over conjunction, and so on. Also rules of inference.'' --&gt;

=== Negation ===
Note that a quantified [[propositional function]] is a statement; thus, like statements, quantified functions can be negated. The notation most mathematicians and logicians utilize to denote negation is: &lt;math&gt;\lnot\ &lt;/math&gt;. However, some use the [[tilde]] (~).

For example, if P(''x'') is the propositional function "x is married", then, for a [[universe of discourse]] X of all living human beings, the universal quantification
&lt;blockquote&gt;Given any living person ''x'', that person is married&lt;/blockquote&gt;
is given:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall{x}{\in}\mathbf{X}\, P(x)&lt;/math&gt;

It can be seen that this is irrevocably false. Truthfully, it is stated that
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not the case that, given any living person ''x'', that person is married&lt;/blockquote&gt;
or, symbolically:
:&lt;math&gt;\lnot\ \forall{x}{\in}\mathbf{X}\, P(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

If the statement is not true for ''every'' element of the Universe of Discourse, then, presuming the universe of discourse is non-empty, there must be at least one element for which the statement is false. That is, the negation of &lt;math&gt;\forall{x}{\in}\mathbf{X}\, P(x)&lt;/math&gt; is logically equivalent to "There exists a living person ''x'' who is not married", or:
:&lt;math&gt;\exists{x}{\in}\mathbf{X}\, \lnot P(x)&lt;/math&gt;

Generally, then, the negation of a propositional function's universal quantification is an [[existential quantification]] of that propositional function's negation; symbolically,
:&lt;math&gt;\lnot\ \forall{x}{\in}\mathbf{X}\, P(x) \equiv\ \exists{x}{\in}\mathbf{X}\, \lnot P(x)&lt;/math&gt;

It is erroneous to state "all persons are not married" (i.e. "there exists no person who is married") when it is meant that "not all persons are married" (i.e. "there exists a person who is not married"):
:&lt;math&gt;\lnot\ \exists{x}{\in}\mathbf{X}\, P(x) \equiv\ \forall{x}{\in}\mathbf{X}\, \lnot P(x) \not\equiv\ \lnot\ \forall{x}{\in}\mathbf{X}\, P(x) \equiv\ \exists{x}{\in}\mathbf{X}\, \lnot P(x)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Other connectives ===
The universal (and existential) quantifier moves unchanged across the [[logical connective]]s [[logical conjunction|∧]], [[logical disjunction|∨]], [[material conditional|→]], and [[converse nonimplication|↚]], as long as the other operand is not affected; that is:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
P(x) \land (\exists{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, Q(y)) &amp;\equiv\ \exists{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, (P(x) \land Q(y)) \\
P(x) \lor  (\exists{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, Q(y)) &amp;\equiv\ \exists{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, (P(x) \lor Q(y)),~\mathrm{provided~that}~\mathbf{Y}\neq \emptyset \\
P(x) \to   (\exists{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, Q(y)) &amp;\equiv\ \exists{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, (P(x) \to Q(y)),~\mathrm{provided~that}~\mathbf{Y}\neq \emptyset \\
P(x) \nleftarrow (\exists{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, Q(y)) &amp;\equiv\ \exists{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, (P(x) \nleftarrow Q(y)) \\
P(x) \land (\forall{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, Q(y)) &amp;\equiv\ \forall{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, (P(x) \land Q(y)),~\mathrm{provided~that}~\mathbf{Y}\neq \emptyset \\
P(x) \lor  (\forall{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, Q(y)) &amp;\equiv\ \forall{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, (P(x) \lor Q(y)) \\
P(x) \to   (\forall{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, Q(y)) &amp;\equiv\ \forall{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, (P(x) \to Q(y)) \\
P(x) \nleftarrow (\forall{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, Q(y)) &amp;\equiv\ \forall{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, (P(x) \nleftarrow Q(y)),~\mathrm{provided~that}~\mathbf{Y}\neq \emptyset
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Conversely, for the logical connectives [[Sheffer stroke|↑]], [[Logical NOR|↓]], [[Material nonimplication|↛]], and [[converse implication|←]], the quantifiers flip:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
P(x) \uparrow (\exists{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, Q(y)) &amp; \equiv\ \forall{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, (P(x) \uparrow Q(y)) \\
P(x) \downarrow  (\exists{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, Q(y)) &amp; \equiv\ \forall{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, (P(x) \downarrow Q(y)),~\mathrm{provided~that}~\mathbf{Y}\neq \emptyset \\
P(x) \nrightarrow (\exists{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, Q(y)) &amp; \equiv\ \forall{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, (P(x) \nrightarrow Q(y)),~\mathrm{provided~that}~\mathbf{Y}\neq \emptyset \\
P(x) \gets (\exists{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, Q(y)) &amp; \equiv\ \forall{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, (P(x) \gets Q(y)) \\
P(x) \uparrow (\forall{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, Q(y)) &amp; \equiv\ \exists{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, (P(x) \uparrow Q(y)),~\mathrm{provided~that}~\mathbf{Y}\neq \emptyset \\
P(x) \downarrow  (\forall{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, Q(y)) &amp; \equiv\ \exists{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, (P(x) \downarrow Q(y)) \\
P(x) \nrightarrow (\forall{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, Q(y)) &amp; \equiv\ \exists{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, (P(x) \nrightarrow Q(y)) \\
P(x) \gets (\forall{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, Q(y)) &amp; \equiv\ \exists{y}{\in}\mathbf{Y}\, (P(x) \gets Q(y)),~\mathrm{provided~that}~\mathbf{Y}\neq \emptyset \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- What about:
*[[logical biconditional|Biconditional (if and only if) (xnor)]] (&lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt;)
*[[Exclusive or|Exclusive disjunction (xor)]] (&lt;math&gt;\not\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;)
--&gt;

=== Rules of inference ===

A [[rule of inference]] is a rule justifying a logical step from hypothesis to conclusion.  There are several rules of inference which utilize the universal quantifier.

''[[Universal instantiation]]'' concludes that, if the propositional function is known to be universally true, then it must be true for any arbitrary element of the universe of discourse.  Symbolically, this is represented as

:&lt;math&gt; \forall{x}{\in}\mathbf{X}\, P(x) \to\ P(c)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is a completely arbitrary element of the universe of discourse.

''[[Universal generalization]]'' concludes the propositional function must be universally true if it is true for any arbitrary element of the universe of discourse.  Symbolically, for an arbitrary ''c'',

:&lt;math&gt; P(c) \to\ \forall{x}{\in}\mathbf{X}\, P(x).&lt;/math&gt;

The element&amp;nbsp;''c'' must be completely arbitrary; else, the logic does not follow: if ''c'' is not arbitrary, and is instead a specific element of the universe of discourse, then P(''c'') only implies an existential quantification of the propositional function.
&lt;!-- ''Discuss universally quantified types in [[type theory]].'' --&gt;

=== The empty set ===

By convention, the formula &lt;math&gt;\forall{x}{\in}\emptyset \, P(x)&lt;/math&gt; is always true, regardless of the formula ''P''(''x''); see [[vacuous truth]].

== Universal closure ==

The '''universal closure''' of a formula φ is the formula with no [[free variable]]s obtained by adding a universal quantifier for every free variable in φ. For example, the universal closure of
:&lt;math&gt;P(y) \land \exists x Q(x,z)&lt;/math&gt;
is
:&lt;math&gt;\forall y \forall z ( P(y) \land \exists x Q(x,z))&lt;/math&gt;.

== As adjoint ==
In [[category theory]] and the theory of [[elementary topos|elementary topoi]], the universal quantifier can be understood as the [[right adjoint]] of a [[functor]] between [[power set]]s, the [[inverse image]] functor of a function between sets; likewise, the [[existential quantifier]] is the [[left adjoint]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Saunders Mac Lane]], Ieke Moerdijk, (1992) ''Sheaves in Geometry and Logic'' Springer-Verlag. {{isbn|0-387-97710-4}} ''See page 58''&lt;/ref&gt;

For a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}X&lt;/math&gt; denote its [[powerset]].  For any function &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; between sets &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, there is an [[inverse image]] functor &lt;math&gt;f^*:\mathcal{P}Y\to \mathcal{P}X&lt;/math&gt; between powersets, that takes subsets of the codomain of ''f'' back to subsets of its domain. The left adjoint of this functor is the existential quantifier &lt;math&gt;\exists_f&lt;/math&gt; and the right adjoint is the universal quantifier &lt;math&gt;\forall_f&lt;/math&gt;.

That is, &lt;math&gt;\exists_f\colon \mathcal{P}X\to \mathcal{P}Y&lt;/math&gt; is a functor that, for each subset &lt;math&gt;S \subset X&lt;/math&gt;, gives the subset &lt;math&gt;\exists_f S \subset Y&lt;/math&gt; given by
:&lt;math&gt;\exists_f S =\{ y\in Y \;|\; \exists x\in X.\ f(x)=y \quad\and\quad x\in S \}&lt;/math&gt;,
those &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in the image of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; under &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly, the universal quantifier &lt;math&gt;\forall_f\colon \mathcal{P}X\to \mathcal{P}Y&lt;/math&gt; is a functor that, for each subset &lt;math&gt;S \subset X&lt;/math&gt;, gives the subset &lt;math&gt;\forall_f S \subset Y&lt;/math&gt; given by
:&lt;math&gt;\forall_f S =\{ y\in Y \;|\; \forall x\in X.\ f(x)=y \quad\implies\quad x\in S \}&lt;/math&gt;,
those &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; whose preimage under &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is contained in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

The more familiar form of the quantifiers as used in [[first-order logic]] is obtained by taking the function ''f'' to be the unique function &lt;math&gt;!:X \to 1&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(1) = \{T,F\}&lt;/math&gt; is the two-element set holding the values true and false, a subset ''S'' is that subset for which the [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] &lt;math&gt;S(x)&lt;/math&gt; holds, and
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rl}\mathcal{P}(!)\colon \mathcal{P}(1) &amp; \to \mathcal{P}(X)\\ T &amp;\mapsto X \\ F &amp;\mapsto \{\}\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\exists_! S = \exists x. S(x),&lt;/math&gt;
which is true if &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is not empty, and
:&lt;math&gt;\forall_! S = \forall x. S(x),&lt;/math&gt;
which is false if S is not X.

The universal and existential quantifiers given above generalize to the [[presheaf category]].

:Z++ is also a version of the [[C++]] programming language (not to be confused with ''Z++'' that this article is about).

'''Z++'''  (pronounced ''zee plus plus'') was an [[object-oriented (programming)|object-oriented]] extension to the [[Z notation|Z]] [[specification language]].

Z++ is an object-oriented extension to the Z specification language, allowing for the definition of classes, and the relation of classes through inheritance, association or aggregation.

The primary construct of Z++ is a class.  A Z++ class consists of a number of clauses which are optional.

Z++ Class Structure:

 ''CLASS ClassName
   [OWNS List_of_attributes]
   [FUNCTIONS constant_definitions]
   [TYPE type_declaration]
   [ENTENDS list_of_super_classes]
   [OPERATIONS list_of_state_change_operations_definitions]
   [RETURNS list_of_query_operations_definitions]
   [ACTIONS all_operations_declarations]
   [INVARIANT predicates]
   [HISTORY RTL_predicates]
 END CLASS''
