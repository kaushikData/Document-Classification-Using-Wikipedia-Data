'''Aerospace materials''' are materials, frequently [[alloy|metal alloy]]s, that have either been developed for, or have come to prominence through, their use for [[aerospace]] purposes.

These uses often require exceptional performance, strength or heat resistance, even at the cost of considerable expense in their production or machining. Others are chosen for their long-term reliability in this safety-conscious field, particularly for their resistance to [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]].

The field of materials engineering is an important one within [[aerospace engineering]]. Its practice is defined by the [[international standard]]s bodies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== History ==

=== Edwardian period ===
The first aerospace materials were those long-established and often naturally occurring materials used to construct the first aircraft. These included such mundane materials as [[timber]] for wing structures and [[fabric]] and [[aircraft dope|dope]] to cover them. Their quality was of utmost importance and so the timber would be of carefully selected [[sitka spruce]] and the covering of [[irish linen]]. Standards were required for the selection, manufacture, and use of these materials. These standards were developed informally by manufacturers or government groups such as [[Royal Aircraft Factory|HM Balloon Factory]], later to become [[RAE Farnborough]], often with the assistance of university engineering departments.

The next stage in the development of aerospace materials was to adopt newly developed materials, such as [[Duralumin]] the first [[age hardening]] [[aluminium alloy]]. These offered attributes not previously available. Many of these new materials also required study to determine the extent of these new properties, their behaviour and how to make the best use of them. This work was often carried out through the new government-funded national laboratories, such as the ''[[:de:Reichsanstalt|Reichsanstalt]]'' (German Imperial Institute)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

  |ref=NPL, Century of Measurement
  |page=16
}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the British [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] (NPL).

=== World War I ===
The NPL was also responsible for perhaps the first deliberately engineered aerospace material, [[Y alloy]].&lt;ref name="Higgins, Engineering Metallurgy, Y alloy" &gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This first of the [[nickel-aluminium alloy]]s was discovered after a series of experiments&lt;ref&gt;Experiment 'Y' of the series, giving the alloy its name.&lt;/ref&gt; during [[World War I]], deliberately setting out to find a better material for the manufacture of [[piston]]s for [[aircraft engine]]s.

=== Interwar period ===
[[Interwar period|Between the wars]], many aerospace innovations were in the field of [[manufacturing process]]es, rather than just an inherently stronger material, although these too benefited from improved materials. One of the [[R.R. alloys]], R.R.53B, had added silicon which improved its [[Viscosity|fluidity]] when molten. This allowed its use for [[die casting]] as well as the previous [[sand casting]], a means of making parts that were both far cheaper and also more accurate in shape and finish. Better control of their shape allowed designers to shape them more precisely to their tasks, leading to parts that were also thinner and lighter.

Many interwar developments were to [[aircraft engine]]s, which benefited from the vast improvements being made for the growing car industry. Although not strictly an 'aerospace' innovation, the use of [[refractory]] alloys like [[Stellite]] and [[Brightray]] for the hard-facing of [[exhaust valve]]s offered huge gains in the reliability of aircraft engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This itself encouraged long-range commercial flights, as the new engines were reliable enough to be considered safe for long flights across oceans or mountain ranges.

=== World War II ===
&lt;!-- WW2: improved mass manufacturing, Mosquito wooden composite monocoque, plastics for VHF radio insulation and radar transparency, ersatz--&gt;

The [[de Havilland Albatross|de Havilland ''Albatross'']] airliner of 1936 had a [[fuselage]] of wooden sandwich construction: wafers of birch [[plywood]] were spaced apart by a [[balsa]] sheet. This same construction achieved fame with its wartime use in the [[de Havilland Mosquito|''Mosquito'']] fast bomber. As well as being a construction of light weight and high performance, it also avoided the use of aluminium, a [[strategic material]] during wartime, and could use the skills of woodworkers, rather than those of specialised aircraft metalworkers. When Germany attempted to copy this aircraft as the ''[[Focke-Wulf Ta 154|Moskito]]'' it was a failure, primarily for materials reasons. The original [[phenolic resin|phenolic]] ''[[Tego film]]'' adhesive was only produced by a factory that was destroyed by bombing. Its replacement led directly to catastrophic failures and loss of the aircraft.

[[Radar]] became small enough to be carried on board aircraft, but the fragile [[feed horn]]s and [[reflector (antenna)|reflector]]s needed to be protected and streamlined from the airstream. Moulded [[radome]]s were constructed, using the [[Perspex]] acrylic plastic that was already in use for cockpit windows. This could be heated to soften it, then moulded or [[vacuum forming|vacuum formed]] to shape. Other polymers developed at this time, notably [[Nylon]], found uses in compact radio equipment as high-voltage insulators or [[dielectric]]s.

[[Honeycomb structure]]s were developed as flat sandwich sheets used for bulkheads and decking. These were long established with wood and paper board construction, but required a more robust material for aerospace use. This was achieved towards the end of the war, with all-aluminium honeycomb sandwiches.

=== Post-war ===
&lt;!-- Post WW2: gas turbine low-creep nickel alloys, exotic alloys, composites --&gt;
{{Empty section|date=January 2017}}

=== New materials ===

New lightweight materials include [[Ceramic matrix composites]], [[metal matrix composites]], polymer [[aerogel]]s and [[Carbon nanotube|CNT]]-yarns, along the evolution of polymer [[Composite material|composite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.aircraftinteriorsinternational.com/industry-opinion/out-of-the-lab-and-into-a-plane-the-emerging-materials-making-aircraft-lighter.html |title= Out of the lab and into a plane: The emerging materials making aircraft lighter |author= Richard Collins, IDTechEx |date= Aug 1, 2018 |work= Aircraft Interiors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marketing outside aerospace ==
[[File:Carbon Fiber Money Clip.jpg|thumb|Carbon fibre [[money clip]]]]
The term "aerospace grade" has come to be a fashionable [[marketing slogan]] for luxury goods, particularly for cars and [[sporting goods]]. [[Bicycle]]s, [[golf club]]s, sailing [[yacht]]s and even [[flashlight|torch]]es are all sold on the basis of their high-performance materials, whether these are relevant or not. Since their appearance in 1979, [[Maglite]] have advertised their use of [[6061 aluminium]] for their torch bodies, one of the first to make a deliberate feature of aerospace materials for a non-performance reason.

Some sporting uses have been for the material's actual qualities. Many ski makers have produced skis wholly from cloth and resin composite materials, using the tailorability of such construction to vary the stiffness, damping and torsional stiffness of a ski along its length. [[Hexcel]], a manufacturer of aluminium honeycomb sheet, became well known for its branded skis, using this same advanced material.

Sporting uses may be every bit as demanding as aerospace needs. Particularly in cycling, materials may be loaded ''more'' highly than in aerospace use, the risk of possible failure being seen as more acceptable than for aircraft.

Many uses of aerospace materials for sporting goods have been as the result of a '[[peace dividend]]'. After World War II, [[Hiduminium]] alloy appeared in bicycle brake components&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://www.classiclightweights.co.uk/designs/hs-gbrakes.html
  |title=G B brakes (Gerry Burgess Cycle Components, 1948)
  |author=Hilary Stone
}}&lt;/ref&gt; as its maker sought to expand new markets to replace their previous military aircraft. In the 1990s, both smelters and recyclers of [[titanium]] sought new non-military markets after the end of the [[Cold War]], finding them in both [[bicycle frame#Titanium|bicycle frame]]s and golf clubs.

[[Carbon fibre composite]], and its distinctive weave pattern, has become a popular decorative choice on cars and motorbikes, even in purely decorative contexts such as dashboards. This has extended to the use of flexible stick-on patterned vinyl to [[skeuomorph]]ically reproduce the appearance, without any of the physical properties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3345">'''Analysis of similarities (ANOSIM)''' is a [[Nonparametric statistics|non-parametric statistical test]] widely used in the field of [[ecology]]. The test was first suggested by K. R. Clarke&lt;ref name="Clarke1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clarke|first1=K. R.|title=Non-parametric multivariate analyses of changes in community structure|journal=Austral Ecology|volume=18|issue=1|year=1993|pages=117–143|issn=1442-9985|doi=10.1111/j.1442-9993.1993.tb00438.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an [[analysis of variance|ANOVA]]-like test, where instead of operating on [[raw data]], operates on a ranked dissimilarity [http://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/MatrixOperations.html matrix].

Given a matrix of rank [[dissimilarities]] between a set of samples, each solely belong to one [[treatment group]], the ANOSIM tests whether we can reject the [[null hypothesis]] that the similarity between groups is greater than or equal to the [[Similarity (geometry)|similarity]] within the groups.

The test statistic ''R'' is calculated in the following way:

: &lt;math&gt; R = \frac{r_B - r_W}{M/2} &lt;/math&gt;

where {{overline|''r''}}&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the average of rank similarities of pairs of samples (or replicates) originating from different sites, {{overline|''r''}}&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt; is the average of rank similarity of pairs among [[Replicate (statistics)|replicates]] within sites, and ''M''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)/2 where ''n'' is the number of samples.

The test statistic ''R'' is constrained between the values −1 to 1, where [[Sign (mathematics)|positive numbers]] suggest more similarity within sites and values close to zero represent no difference between within sites and within sites similarities. Negative ''R'' values suggest more similarity between sites than within sites and may raise the possibility of wrong assignment of samples to sites.

For the purpose of [[hypothesis]] testing, where the null hypothesis is that the similarities within sites are smaller or equal to the similarities between sites, the ''R'' statistic is usually compared to a set of ''R&amp;prime;'' values that are achieved by means of randomly shuffling site labels between the samples and calculating the resulting ''R&amp;prime;'', repeated many times.  The percent of times that the actual ''R'' surpassed the [[permutation]]s derived ''R&amp;prime;'' values is the p-value for the actual ''R'' statistic.

Ranking of dissimilarity in ANOSIM and NMDS (non-metric multidimensional scaling) go hand in hand.
Combining both methods complement visualisation of group differences along with [[Statistical significance|significance testing]].&lt;ref name="ButtigiegRamette2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buttigieg|first1=Pier Luigi|last2=Ramette|first2=Alban|title=A guide to statistical analysis in microbial ecology: a community-focused, living review of multivariate data analyses|journal=FEMS Microbiology Ecology|volume=90|issue=3|year=2014|pages=543–550|issn=0168-6496|doi=10.1111/1574-6941.12437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ANOSIM is implemented in several statistical software including PRIMER, R Vegan package and PAST.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1871">'''Antiferroelectricity''' is a physical property of certain materials. It is closely related to [[ferroelectricity]]; the relation between antiferroelectricity and ferroelectricity is analogous to the relation between [[antiferromagnetism]] and [[ferromagnetism]].

An antiferroelectric material consists of an ordered ([[crystal]]line) array of [[electric dipole]]s (from the ions and electrons in the material), but with adjacent dipoles oriented in opposite (antiparallel) directions (the dipoles of each orientation form interpenetrating sublattices, loosely analogous to a [[checkerboard]] pattern).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Compendium of chemical terminology - Gold Book|publisher=[[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]]|year=2014|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/PDF/goldbook.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Charles Kittel]]|title=Theory of Antiferroelectric Crystals |journal=[[Physical Review|Phys. Rev.]] |volume=82 |issue= 5|pages=729–732 |year=1951 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.82.729 |bibcode = 1951PhRv...82..729K }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be contrasted with a ferroelectric, in which the dipoles all point in the same direction.

In an antiferroelectric, unlike a ferroelectric, the total, macroscopic [[polarization density|spontaneous polarization]] is zero, since the adjacent dipoles cancel each other out.

Antiferroelectricity is a property of a material, and it can appear or disappear (more generally, strengthen or weaken) depending on temperature, pressure, external electric field, growth method, and other parameters. In particular, at a high enough temperature, antiferroelectricity disappears; this temperature is known as the [[Néel point]] or [[Curie point]].

==Location and description==

[[File:Antipodes Castaway Hut.JPG|thumb|left|An old [[Castaway depot|castaway hut]] on the Antipodes Islands.]]

The [[island]]s comprising this ecoregion share a long history of isolation, both from other [[landmass]]es and each other. The isolation, combined with harsh [[climate]]s characterised by low temperatures, strong westerly winds and few hours of sunlight in [[winter]], have resulted in the evolution of many [[endemic]] plants and animals, though species richness is relatively low. Wind speeds reach an average of {{convert|40|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} while even in summer the thick cloud cover prevents much sunlight from penetrating.
 
The [[Bounty Islands]] are small [[granite]] rocks (with a maximum height of {{convert|88|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), while the small [[Antipodes Islands]] group (maximum height 366m), the largest group the [[Auckland Islands]] ({{convert|705|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and [[Campbell Island, New Zealand|Campbell Island]] ({{convert|569|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) are volcanic in origin. [[Macquarie Island]] ({{convert|433|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) is the furthest south and the coldest. Where present, [[soil]]s are mainly [[bog]]gy [[peat]]s, up to {{convert|8|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} deep in flat areas. None of the islands are inhabited although there are ongoing research projects including a permanent base of the [[Australian Antarctic Division]] on Macquarie Island.

==Flora==

[[File:MacquarieIsland11.JPG|thumb|Bluffs on Macquarie Island.]]

Vegetation may include low [[forest]]s of [[Metrosideros umbellata|Southern rātā]] in the more sheltered areas of the Aucklands and parts of Campbell Island, with [[New Zealand tussock grasslands|tussock]] [[grassland]], [[shrubland]], [[herbfield]], [[feldmark]] and [[cushion plant]]s elsewhere. The islands represent a transition zone between the [[Antarctic]] to the south and [[temperate climates]] to the north. Individual species include many endemics, such as a ''[[Cyathea]]'' tree fern, which are not found any further south in the world, along with others that also occur in New Zealand and further north.  Macquarie Island, being colder (average annual temperature {{convert|5|°C|°F|disp=or}}), does not sustain any wooded plants, while the small Bounty Islands lack soils and their flora is largely restricted to [[algae]] and [[lichen]]s on the rocks. The islands are home to a number of rare plants, including a unique [[genus]], the Auckland Island ''[[Pleurophyllum]]'', and the only subantarctic orchids, ''[[Nematoceras dienemum]]'' and ''[[Nematoceras sulcatum]]'' of Macquarie Island.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt;

==Fauna==

There are no native land mammals, nor amphibians or reptiles.  Marine mammals include five breeding species of [[Pinniped|seal]]; the [[southern elephant seal]], [[Australasian fur seal]], [[subantarctic fur seal]], [[Antarctic fur seal]] and the rare [[New Zealand sea lion]], 95% of the world's population of which breed on the Auckland Islands. 

There are also large numbers of breeding [[penguins]] and other [[seabird]]s, including almost half of the world's species of [[albatross]], especially the world's only breeding colonies of the [[Antipodean albatross]] (''Diomedea exulans antipodensis''), [[southern royal albatross]] (''Diomedea epomophora epomophora''), [[Campbell albatross]] (''Thalassarche impavida''), [[white-capped albatross]] (''Thalassarche steadi''), and [[Salvin's albatross]] (''Thalassarche salvini''). The large colonies of Salvin's albatross on the Bounty Islands build nests of feathers as there is no vegetation to use. There are also isolated populations of land birds that have presumably settled here, having been blown off course by ocean winds. Many of these have since evolved into unique species, including two endemic [[parakeet]]s on Antipodes Island; the [[Antipodes parakeet]] (''Cyanoramphus unicolor'') and [[Reischek's parakeet]] (''Cyanoramphus hochstetteri''). 

[[File:RoyalPenguins4.JPG|thumb|A [[royal penguin]] rookery on Macquarie Island.]]

Similarly, a high proportion of the [[Lepidoptera]] and other insects of the islands have evolved into unique endemic species. 

A number of species have disappeared since the islands were discovered by humans, including the [[Macquarie Island rail]] and the [[Macquarie Island parakeet]].&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt;

==Threats and preservation==
Although the islands have been partially occupied at various times the habitats remain largely unspoilt. However introduced animals prey on native wildlife and graze on the plant cover while both mammals and seabirds are vulnerable to entanglement in [[fishing net|deep-sea fishing equipment]]. [[Longline fishing]] for tuna and trawling for [[squid]] are particularly damaging. 

Current predators on the islands include rats and cats and these are being systematically removed while cautionary procedures are in place to prevent more alien species becoming established. All cats have now been removed from Macquarie Island and there appears to have been an immediate increase in some seabird populations. All the islands are nature reserves, [[World Heritage Sites]] and (except for the  Bounty Islands) a [[Centre of Plant Diversity]]. Permission to land must be obtained from the [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)]] for the New Zealand islands and the [[Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service]] for Macquarie.

The claims of an impact crater had been raised by a team of hobby-archaeologists, calling themselves the CIRT (Chiemgau impact research team),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chiemgau-impact.com The Chiemgau Impact] - the claims by the Chiemgau impact research team&lt;/ref&gt; and have resulted in some media reports in Germany and discussions in the local tourism industry, but are not accepted beyond the CIRT team today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15457">'''Energy in the Faroe Islands''' is produced primarily from fossil fuels, with further contributions from hydro and wind power. Oil products are the main energy source, mainly consumed by fishing vessels and sea transport. Electricity is produced by [[Fuel oil|oil]], [[hydropower]] and [[wind farm]]s, mainly by the [[SEV (company)|SEV]], which is owned by all the municipalities of the Faroe Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kvf.fo/greinar/2016/10/17/ikki-umrott-malid |title=Ikki umrøtt málið |last1=Djurhuus |first1=Høgni  |last2=Mohr |first2=Bjarni |date=17 October 2016 |work= |publisher=Kringvarp Føroya |accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Faroe Islands]] are not connected by power lines with continental Europe, and thus the archipelago [[islanding|cannot import or export electricity]].

'''Ilgaz Mountains''' ({{lang-tr|Ilgaz Dağları}}) is a mountain range in northwest [[Anatolia]], [[Turkey]].

== Geography ==
In west [[Black Sea region]], there are three ranges of mountains, which run parallel to the [[Black Sea]] coast. Ilgaz Mountains constitute the eastern part of the second range from the coast line at an average distance of {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The northern slopes of the mountains are in [[Kastamonu Province]] and the southern slopes are in [[Çankırı Province]]. The length of the mountain system from west to east is about {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} with a width of about {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Situated at {{coord|41|06|N|33|52|E}}, the mountain peak, known as ''Hacettepe'', is {{convert|2587|m|ft|abbr=on}} high. The state highway {{TUR-D|765}}, which connects Black Sea coast to [[Central Anatolia]] is  {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of the peak. The altitude of the  highest pass on the highway is {{convert|1850|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kgm.gov.tr/SiteCollectionImages/KGMimages/Haritalar/b15.jpg Online map of [[General Directorate of Highways (Turkey)|General Directorate of Highways]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== National park ==
{{main|Mount Ilgaz National Park}}
The [[Mount Ilgaz National Park]] ({{lang-tr|Ilgaz Dağı Milli Parkı}}) at the west of the highway pass was opened on June 2, 1976 and is easily accessible from the highway {{TUR-D|765}}. Total area of the park is {{convert|732|ha|km2|abbr=on}}. At the highest elevation of the park, there are a number of hotels servicing to skiers. The skiers may use a {{convert|1500|m|ft|abbr=on}} long [[chairlift]] to the ski area. The distance from [[Ankara]] is {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}}, which makes the park nearest winter sports resort to the capital city citizens. During the summertime, the visitors may fish in the Baldıran Valley within the national park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kultur.gov.tr/TR/belge/1-20879/kastamonu---ilgaz-dagi-milli-parki.html [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Turkey)|Ministry of Culture and Tourism]] page {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
Ilgaz Mountains, especially the northern slopes, are covered with dense forestry. The popular name of the forestry around Ilgaz Mountains is "sea of trees" ({{lang-tr|ağaç denizi}}). Some of the wild animals living in the wooded ranges are red deer, roe deer, fallow deer, wild boar, brown bear, gray wolf, European jackal, chamois and red fox. In 1996, a new insect species was discovered in Ilgaz Mountain ecology and in 2010 it was named as ''[[Merodon]] Ilgazense''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haberler.com/ilgaz-dagi-nda-yeni-bir-bocek-turu-bulundu-2912265-haberi/ Newspaper article {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular music ==
The theme of a popular [[song]] "''Ilgaz''" composed by [[Samim Bilgen|Ahmet Samim Bilgen]] and lyrics by Cemil Türkarman is about Ilgaz Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netbilgi.tk/ilgaz-anadolunun-sen-yuce-bir-dagisin-sozleri-ve-turkusu-26-09-2011.html Netbilgi site {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Heliospheric-current-sheet.gif|thumb|300px|The [[heliospheric current sheet]] results from the influence of the [[Sun]]'s [[rotating magnetic field]] on the [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] in the interplanetary medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901124602/http://quake.stanford.edu/~wso/gifs/HCS.html|title=Heliospheric Current Sheet|author=|date=1 September 2006|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''interplanetary medium''' is the material which fills the [[Solar System]], and through which all the larger Solar System bodies, such as [[planet]]s, [[dwarf planet]]s, [[asteroid]]s, and [[comet]]s, move.

==Composition and physical characteristics==
The interplanetary medium includes interplanetary [[Interplanetary dust cloud|dust]], [[cosmic ray]]s and hot [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] from the [[solar wind]]. The temperature of the interplanetary medium varies. For dust particles within the asteroid belt, typical temperatures range from 200&amp;nbsp;K (−73&amp;nbsp;°C) at 2.2&amp;nbsp;AU down to 165&amp;nbsp;K (−108&amp;nbsp;°C) at 3.2&amp;nbsp;AU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  | author=Low, F. J.
  | display-authors=etal
  | title=Infrared cirrus&amp;nbsp;– New components of the extended infrared emission
  | journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters
  | date=1984
  | volume=278
  | pages=L19–L22
  | bibcode=1984ApJ...278L..19L
  | doi=10.1086/184213 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The density of the interplanetary medium is very low, about 5 particles per cubic centimeter in the vicinity of the [[Earth]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}; it decreases with increasing distance from the Sun, in inverse proportion to the square of the distance. It is variable, and may be affected by [[magnetic field]]s and events such as [[coronal mass ejection]]s. It may rise to as high as 100 particles/cm³.

Since the interplanetary medium is a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], it has the characteristics of a plasma, rather than a simple gas; for example, it carries with it the Sun's magnetic field, is highly electrically conductive (resulting in the [[heliospheric current sheet]]), forms plasma [[Double layer (plasma)|double layer]]s where it comes into contact with a planetary magnetosphere or at the [[Heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]], and exhibits filamentation (such as in [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurorae]]).

The plasma in the interplanetary medium is also responsible for the strength of the Sun's magnetic field at the orbit of the Earth being over 100 times greater than originally anticipated. If space were a vacuum, then the Sun's 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; tesla magnetic dipole field would reduce with the cube of the distance to about 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; tesla. But satellite observations show that it is about 100 times greater at around 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; tesla. [[Magnetohydrodynamic]] (MHD) theory predicts that the motion of a conducting fluid (e.g., the interplanetary medium) in a magnetic field induces electric currents which in turn generate magnetic fields, and in this respect it behaves like an [[MHD dynamo]].

==Extent of the interplanetary medium==
The outer edge of the Solar System is the boundary between the flow of the solar wind and the [[interstellar medium]]. This boundary is known as the [[Heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]] and is believed to be a fairly sharp transition of the order of 110 to 160 [[astronomical unit]]s from the Sun. The interplanetary medium thus fills the roughly spherical volume contained within the heliopause.

==Interaction with planets==
How the interplanetary medium interacts with planets depends on whether they have magnetic fields or not. Bodies such as the [[Moon]] have no magnetic field and the solar wind can impact directly on their surface. Over billions of years, the lunar [[regolith]] has acted as a collector for solar wind particles, and so studies of rocks from the Moon's surface can be valuable in studies of the solar wind.

High energy particles from the solar wind impacting on the Moon's surface also cause it to emit faintly at [[X-ray]] wavelengths.

Planets with their own magnetic field, such as the Earth and [[Jupiter]], are surrounded by a [[magnetosphere]] within which their magnetic field is dominant over the [[Sun]]'s. This disrupts the flow of the solar wind, which is channelled around the magnetosphere. Material from the solar wind can 'leak' into the magnetosphere, causing [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]]e and also populating the [[Van Allen Belts]] with ionised material.

==Observable phenomena of the interplanetary medium==
The interplanetary medium is responsible for several effects which can be seen from Earth. The [[Zodiacal light]] is a broad band of faint light sometimes seen after sunset and before sunrise, stretched along the [[ecliptic]] and brightest near the horizon. It is caused by sunlight scattering off [[dust]] particles in the interplanetary medium between the Earth and the Sun.

A similar effect is the [[Gegenschein]], which is seen directly opposite to the Sun's position in the sky. It is much fainter than the Zodiacal light, and is caused by sunlight reflecting off dust particles outside the Earth's orbit.

==History==
The term "interplanetary" appears to have been first used in print in 1691 by the scientist [[Robert Boyle]]: "The air is different from the æther (or vacuum) in the... interplanetary spaces" Boyle ''Hist. Air''.

The notion that space is considered to be a [[vacuum]] filled with an "[[Aether (classical element)|aether]]", or just a cold, dark vacuum continued up until the 1950s (see below).

In 1898, American astronomer [[Charles Augustus Young]] wrote: "Inter-planetary space is a vacuum, far more perfect than anything we can produce by artificial means..." (''The Elements of Astronomy'', Charles Augustus Young, 1898).

And Akasofu recounted that: "The view that interplanetary space is a vacuum into which the Sun intermittently emitted corpuscular streams was changed radically by [[Ludwig Biermann]] (1951, 1953) who proposed on the basis of comet tails, that the Sun continuously blows its atmosphere out in all directions at supersonic speed" ([[Syun-Ichi Akasofu]], ''Exploring the Secrets of the Aurora'', 2002)

Tufts University Professor of astronomy, Kenneth R. Lang, writing in 2000 noted, "Half a century ago, most people visualized our planet as a solitary sphere traveling in a cold, dark vacuum of space around the Sun".&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth R. Lang, ''The Sun from Space'' (2000) Springer, {{ISBN|3-540-66944-2}}. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sn5gZ6gHKakC&amp;pg=PA17 2. Discovering Space]" (page 17)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16384">'''[[Island]] [[ecology]]''' is the study of island organisms and their interactions with each other and the environment.  Islands account for nearly 1/6 of earth’s total land area,&lt;ref name="Paulay"&gt;Paulay, G. 1994. Biodiversity on Oceanic Islands: Its Origin and Extinction. ''American Zoology'' 34: 134-144.&lt;/ref&gt; yet the ecology of island ecosystems is vastly different from that of mainland communities.  Their isolation and high availability of empty [[Ecological niche|niche]]s leads to increased [[speciation]].  As a result, island ecosystems comprise 30% of the world’s [[biodiversity hotspots]], 50% of marine tropical diversity, and some of the most unusual and rare species.&lt;ref name="Gerlach"&gt;Gerlach, Justin.  2008. [http://islandbiodiversity.com/gim.htm Island biodiversity - issues and opportunities]. World Conservation Congress&lt;/ref&gt;  Many species still remain unknown.

The diversity of species on islands is highly impacted by human activities such as [[deforestation]] and introduction of [[exotic species]].  In response, ecologists and managers are directing attention towards [[Conservation biology|conservation]] and [[Restoration ecology|restoration]] of island species.  Because they are simple systems, islands provide an opportunity to study processes of [[extinction]] that can be extrapolated to larger ecosystems.

== Ecological processes on islands ==

Islands are attractive sites for ecological research because they provide clear examples of evolution in action.  They show interesting patterns of colonization, adaptation, and speciation.

===Colonization and establishment===

Islands are surrounded by water, and may or may not exist as part of a continental land mass.  Oceanic islands arise due to volcanic activity or reef growth, and usually subside over time due to erosion and changing sea levels.&lt;ref name="Paulay" /&gt;  When islands emerge, they undergo the process of [[ecological succession]] as species colonize the island (see theory of [[island biogeography]]).  New species cannot immigrate via land, and instead must arrive via air, water, or wind.  As a result, organisms with high [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] capabilities, such as plants and birds, are much more common on islands than are poorly dispersing taxa like mammals.&lt;ref name="Paulay" /&gt;  However, some mammals are present on islands, presumably from swimming or riding on natural “rafts” that are washed away from the mainland.

Of the species that arrive, only some will be able to survive and establish populations.  As a result, islands have fewer species than mainland habitats.  Island populations are small and exhibit low genetic variability (see [[founder effect]]), but are isolated from the predators and competitors that they initially evolved with.  This can lead to a process called [[ecological release]], where a species is released from its ancestral community interactions and then colonizes new niches.

===Adaptation===

In response to these changing ecological pressures, island species can become much more docile than their mainland counterparts, and may grow larger (see [[island gigantism]]) or smaller (see [[island dwarfism]]).  Some of these unique adaptations are reflected in charismatic island species such as the [[giant tortoise]], [[Komodo dragon]], or [[pygmy mammoth]]s.

Minimizing energy expenditure facilitates vertebrate persistence on oceanic islands. Ecology Letters 5(5): 693-704.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moving to suburbia: ontogenetic and evolutionary consequences of life on predator-free islands.

''Journal of Ecology'' 84(1): 53-61.&lt;/ref&gt; in plants.

===Speciation===

The formation of new islands and their isolation from the mainland provides many unoccupied niches for species to adapt to.  Since immigration of predators and competitors is limited, many organisms are able to persist in these new niches.  This results in a high occurrence of [[endemism]], where species are unique to a localized area.  For example, 50% of endemic bird areas are found on islands.&lt;ref name="Gerlach" /&gt;

Endemism is often the result of [[adaptive radiation]].&lt;ref name="Paulay" /&gt;  Adaptive radiation is when a single species colonizes an area and rapidly diversifies to fill all of the available niches.  A common example is the assemblage of finch species documented by [[Charles Darwin]] in the [[Galapagos Islands]].  Darwin’s finches exhibited adaptive radiation by evolving different beak sizes to exploit the diversity of seeds present on the different islands.  [[File:Palila.jpg|thumb|The palila, one of several endangered honeycreepers that evolved through adaptive radiation and are endemic to the Hawaiian Islands.]]

Because the distributions of these populations are limited by their island habitats, they tend to have fewer individuals than their mainland counterparts and lower genetic variation.  This, along with the behavioral and ecological factors mentioned above, makes island species more vulnerable to extinction.&lt;ref name="Paulay" /&gt;

===Survival===

The continued survival of species on islands depends on factors such as natural [[Selection (biology)|selection]], genetic variation, natural disturbances (hurricanes, volcanic eruptions) and human-caused disturbances (introduced species, habitat loss).  Human-caused disturbances tend to be the greatest cause of mortality, and understanding the causes of extinction facilitates conservation efforts.

=== Human impacts on island ecosystems ===

The movement of humans to islands has led to rapid extinction of native island species either from hunting, [[habitat destruction]], or [[introduced species]].

===Hunting===

Many large animals on islands have been hunted to extinction by humans.  A well-known example is the [[dodo]], once found on the island of [[Mauritius]].  It evolved to become large, flightless and docile, and was subsequently driven to extinction by humans and introduced predators.

===Habitat destruction===
The depletion of natural resources can have dramatic effects on island ecology.  On [[Easter Island]], the depletion of the forest by humans not only resulted in widespread loss of species, but also the collapse of the island civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Bahn, P and J. Flenley. 1992. Easter Island, Earth Island. Thames and Hudson, London.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[File:Luftbild Osterinsel.jpg|thumb|Easter Island has been a site of dramatic ecological change.]] Today there are over 500 million people on islands, all dependent on local resources either directly (traditional use) or indirectly (ecotourism revenue).  Population growth and development result in heavy [[deforestation]], [[pollution]], and [[over-exploitation]].  Overharvesting of ocean fauna is particularly troubling as yields of [[coral reef fish]] species are an important food source for island populations.

===Introduced species===

Humans have contributed to globalization and decreased effective isolation of island communities, allowing for invasion of exotic species.  This can have a profound effect on the native species.  In [[Guam]], the introduced [[brown tree snake]] ate nearly all of the native vertebrate species to extinction.  Feral cats and dogs have also greatly diminished native vertebrate populations on islands, through both predation and disease.  Introduced [[ungulate]]s are another major threat, as they graze on native vegetation and can destroy entire forests.&lt;ref&gt;Towns, D.R. and W.J. Ballantine. 1993. Conservation and Restoration of New Zealand Island Ecosystems. ''Trends in Evolution and Ecology'' 8(12): 452-457.&lt;/ref&gt;  Exotic grasses can out-compete native [[understory]] species and increase the risk of fire.&lt;ref&gt;D’Antonio, C.M. and P.M. Vitousek. 1992. Biological Invasions by Exotic Grasses, the Grass/Fire Cycle, and Global Change. Annual Review of Ecological Systematics 23: 63-87.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lastly, [[social insects]] such as ants also cause major problems.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, F. R., A.C. Medeiros, L.L. Loope, and W.W. Zuehlke. 1992. Effects of the Argentine ant on arthropod fauna of Hawaiian high-elevation shrubland. ''Ecology'' 73: 1313-1322.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global warming===

Global warming is emerging as a strong cause of species loss on islands.  This can be due to [[Current sea level rise|sea level rise]], intrusion of salt water into freshwater habitats, or species inability to adapt to increasing temperatures and extreme weather events.  Plant species are particularly susceptible.&lt;ref&gt;Kreft, H., W. Jetz, J. Mutke, G. Kier, and W. Barthlott. 2008. Global diversity of island floras from a macroecological perspective. ''Ecology Letters'' 11(2): 116-127.&lt;/ref&gt;  In more isolated areas, such as the Southern Ocean Islands, indirect effects such as invasive species and global warming can play a greater role in influencing populations than overexploitation, pollution and habitat loss.&lt;ref&gt;Chown, S.L., J.E. Lee, and J.D. Shaw. 2008. Conservation of Southern Ocean Islands: Invertebrates as exemplars. ''Journal of Insect Conservation'' 12(4): 277-291.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:NukutoaHighTide.JPG|thumb|[[Current sea level rise|Sea level rise]] is a pressing concern for many island people.]]

===Trophic cascades===

Human activities and the introduction of non-native species often cause [[trophic cascade]]s, where direct effects on one species result in indirect effects on other species in the food web.  An example is on [[Santa Cruz Island]] of the [[California Channel Islands]], where [[DDT]] poisoning reduced [[bald eagle]] populations. This, along with an abundance of introduced feral pigs for prey, allowed [[golden eagle]]s to colonize the island and replace bald eagles.  However, the golden eagles also ate native [[island fox]]es.  Fox population levels decreased to near extinction, while [[skunk]] populations increased due to relaxed competition with foxes.

== Island conservation ==

=== Conservation on islands ===

Since island ecosystems are self-contained, it should be possible to mitigate many of the threats to species.  Ecologists and managers are working together to prioritize areas for conservation and to quickly design and implement action plans.  Not everything can be put into a reserve, so it is important to first compile pertinent information and prioritize areas of concern.&lt;ref name="Kepler"&gt;Kepler, C.B. and J.M. Scott. 1985. Conservation of Island Ecosystems. ICBP Technical Publication Number 3: 255-271.&lt;/ref&gt;  Once an area has been chosen, managers must then acquire ownership and gain support.  Local experts and indigenous populations should also be involved in this process.&lt;ref name="Kepler" /&gt;  Having clearly defined goals will facilitate the many necessary interactions between people and agencies.&lt;ref name="Kepler" /&gt;  Once a reserve is in place, managers can then practice [[adaptive management]] and do continued community education.  

On land, island conservation focuses on the protection of species and their habitat.  In some cases, conservation can be integrated with agricultural production.  For example, the ''[[Acacia koa]]'' plantations and wooded pastures in [[Hawaii]] are anthropogenically altered ecosystems, yet allow connectivity between forest fragments and thus maintain higher diversity than would open pasture.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, R.L., L.P. Goldstein, and G.C. Daily. 2008. Assessing the conservation value of a human-dominated island landscape: Plant diversity in Hawaii. Biodiversity and Conservation 17(7): 1765-1781.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other directions include habitat restoration, and eradication of introduced predators, ungulates, and exotic plants (via hunting, removal or [[biological control]]).

In marine ecosystems, there has been increasing establishment of “no-take” reserves.  This allows for reestablishment of native species, and also augmentation of commercially harvested species.&lt;ref&gt;Towns, D.R. and W.J. Ballantine. 1993. Conservation and Restoration of New Zealand Island Ecosystems. Trends in Evolution and Ecology 8(12): 452-457.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in both terrestrial and marine systems, these actions are expensive and do not always result in the desired outcomes.  For example, some non-natives become [[keystone species]] and their removal can cause more harm than good to the ecosystem.  To be more effective, managers of island ecosystems should share information and learn from each other’s mistakes.&lt;ref name="Cronk"&gt;Cronk, Q.C.B. 1997. Islands: stability, diversity, conservation. Biodiversity and Conservation 6: 477-493.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Europäischer hummer.jpg|thumb|Lobster benefit greatly from the establishment of no-take zones on islands such as Great Britain, New Zealand, and Tonga.]]

=== Island restoration ===
{{main|Island restoration}}

Island conservation tends to focus on preservation of individual species and their habitats.  However, many ecologists caution that ecological and evolutionary processes should be conserved as well.&lt;ref name="Cronk" /&gt;  The conservation of island communities as a whole is closely linked to [[Restoration ecology|restoration]].  

Active restoration on islands can be done for both animal species (translocations, induced breeding) and plant species (reforestation).  Creating goals for restoration can be challenging because it is often impossible to restore the ecosystem to its “historic” or “normal” state, if that state can even be clearly defined.  Restoration is never complete, as ecological communities are always in a state of change.

=== Sustainable use ===

As resource depletion is a major issue on islands, the needs of human populations must also be taken into account.  On many islands, scientists and managers are studying traditional practices of indigenous populations as potential conservation solutions.  In some cases, limited-take systems that serve the community may provide a better alternative to fully closed protected areas, if there are not enough resources for proper enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Cinner, J.E., M.J. Marnane, and T.R. McClanahan. 2005. Conservation and community benefits from traditional coral reef management at Ahus Island, Papua New Guinea. Conservation Biology 19(6): 1714-1723.&lt;/ref&gt;  Public education plays an important role.

'''Kavu''' is the traditional name given for [[Sacred groves of India|sacred groves]] across the [[Malabar Coast]] in [[Kerala]], South [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Jayarajan, [http://krpcds.org/publication/downloads/92.pdf Sacred Groves of North Malabar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326054142/http://krpcds.org/publication/downloads/92.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }}, Kerala Research Programme on Local Level Development, Centre for Development Studies, Thiruvananthapuram ({{ISBN|81-87621-95-8}})&lt;/ref&gt; Kavus are notable for [[Theyyam]], the centuries-old ritual dance.

==Snake Groves==

[[Image:Sarpa-Kavu-3.jpg|thumb|Sarpa Kavu at [[Sakthanthamburan palace]], [[Thrissur]] ]]
[[Image:Sarpa-Kavu-1.jpg|thumb|Sarpa Kavu at [[Sakthanthamburan palace]], [[Thrissur]] ]]
A [[Sarpa Kavu]] (meaning ''Abode of Snakes'') is a traditional natural sacred space seen near traditional homes in [[Kerala]] state of [[South India]]. The site is believed to be inhabited by snakes, and the area usually contains a representation of ''Naga Raja'' (''King of the Snakes'') and other ''Naga Devatas'' (''snake deities''), where offerings and rites are performed during special ceremonies. This is a Hindu ritual performed by certain sects of [[Nambudiri]]s, and all castes hold the Sarpa Kavu in reverence, with access forbidden to the area unless for due ceremonies.

Mythology says that Kerala was created from the Arabian Sea and given to the Brahmins (Namboothiris) as a "donation" by Parasurama to save himself from the sins of killing numerous kshathriya kings. The land was full of forests and poisonous snakes were found in plenty. So the Brahmins refused to stay there. Parasurama requested Lord Shiva to provide a solution. Shiva told Parasurama to start worshipping Anantha and vasuki the king of snakes. Parasurama did so and Anantha advised him to start snake worship in Kerala and provide some forest especially for snakes in the form of Sarppakkavu (Snake forests). Parasurama later installed the idols of Anantha and Vasuki at Vettikkottu (near Kayamkulam in Alappuzha district) and Mannarassala(near Harippadu in Alappuzha district) and started worshipping them. The Brahmins also worshipped Anantha and Vasuki and the pleased snake gods made Kerala suitable for living.

Sarpa Kavus even help in soil and water conservation besides preserving its rich biological wealth. The ponds and streams adjoining the groves are perennial water sources. These are the last resorts to many of the animals and birds for their water requirements, especially during summer. Sacred groves also enrich the soil through its rich litter composition. The nutrients generated thus are not only recycled within the sacred grove ecosystem but also find their way into the adjoining agroeco systems.

==Sacred Groves==
A Kavu is a South Indian version of an Indian sacred grove.

'''[[Sacred grove]]s of [[India]]''' are forest fragments of varying sizes, which are communally protected, and which usually have a significant religious connotation for the protecting community. Hunting and logging are usually strictly prohibited within these patches.&lt;ref&gt;Gadgil, M. and Vartak, V.D. ; Sacred groves of India : A plea for continued conservation
Journal of [[Bombay Natural History Society]], 72 : 314-320, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of forest usage like [[honey]] collection and [[Coarse woody debris|deadwood]] collection are sometimes allowed on a sustainable basis. Sacred groves did not enjoy protection via federal legislation in India. Some NGOs work with local villagers to protect such groves. Traditionally, and in some cases even today, members of the community take turns to protect the grove.&lt;ref&gt;Sudha, P., Rekha, P. V., Gunaga, V. S., Patagar, S., Naik, M. B., Indu, K. M., and N. H Ravindranath, [http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/archive/00000166/00/sudha.pdf Community Forest Management and Joint Forest Management: An Ecological, Economic and Institutional Assessment in Western Ghats, India] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610012512/http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/archive/00000166/00/sudha.pdf |date=2007-06-10 }}, Presented at "Crossing Boundaries", the seventh annual conference of the International Association for the Study of Common Property, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, June 10–14, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; However, the introduction of the protected area category [[Conservation reserves and community reserves of India|community reserves]] under the [[Wild Life (Protection) Amendment Act, 2002]] has introduced legislation for providing government protection to community held lands, which could include sacred groves.

Indian sacred groves are sometimes associated with temples / monasteries / shrines or with burial grounds (which is the case in [[Shinto]] and [[Ryukyuan religion]]-based sacred groves respectively in [[Japan]]). Sacred groves may be loosely used to refer to other natural habitat protected on religious grounds, such as [[Alpine Meadow]]s.

Historical references to sacred groves can be obtained from ancient classics as far back as [[Kalidasa]]'s [[Vikramuurvashiiya]]. There has been a growing interest in creating green patches such as [[Nakshatravana]].

==Beliefs and practices==
Typically, such groves are associated with the concept of a "presiding deity". While most of these sacred deities are associated with local [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]] gods, sacred groves of Islamic and Buddhist origins, and some based on smaller local religions and  [[folk religion]]s (like the folk deities ''ayyanar'' and ''amman'' ) are also known of. There are over 1000 deities associated with sacred groves in the states of [[Kerala]] and [[Karnataka]] alone. In [[Kodagu]] district in Karnataka from time immemorial the martial community of [[Kodava people|Kodava]]s had maintained over a 1000 Deva kadus dedicated to Aiyappa the forest god.

The Hindu tradition considers forests (''Van''/ ''Ban'') to be of three types - ''Tapovan'', ''Mahavan'' and ''Sreevan''. ''Tapovan'' are forests associated with penance (''Tapas''), and are inhabited by saints and ''rishis''. ''Mahavan'' refers to the grand natural forests. ''Tapovan'' and ''Mahavan'' are considered to be a ''Raksha'' ("sanctuary") for flora and fauna as ordinary human beings are not allowed to enter these forests. ''Sreevan'', which means, "forests of prosperity", consists of dense forests and groves. From the former, people would collect dry wood, leaves, forest produce and a limited amount of timber, though natural ecosystem would not be unnecessarily disturbed. Groves were considered as spaces of forests from where harvesting could be done. Sometimes, specific trees like mango trees could be planted and nurtured here. Groves were associated with religious rites, festivals and recreation. Typical recreational activities associated with these groves included ''jhoola''/ ''jhoolan''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ranchor Prime, Vedic Ecology: Practical Wisdom for Surviving the 21st Century, Mandala Publishing, Novato, CA, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In the villages, ''Panchavati'', or a cluster of five trees that represented the forests, were maintained. These trees represented the five elements of Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Space.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Planting and nurturing of trees has been a highly evolved practice in ancient India.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Vrukshayurveda, authored by Surapala, translated by Nalini Sadhale, Agri-History Bulletin No.1, Asian Agri-History Foundation, Secunderabad&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vrukshayurveda'', the science of plant life and also a 10th-century treatise of that title on the subject ascribed to Surapala, dealt with various species of trees and their growth. Verses 9-23 from this text indicate how mystical beliefs and conservation of ecology was inter-connected.

:''A person is honored in [[Vaikuntha]] for as many thousand years as the days he resides in a house where [[tulasi]] is grown.''

:''And if one properly grows [[bilva]], which pleases [[Lord Siva]], in his family, the goddess of riches resides permanently passes on to the sons and grandsons''

:''He who plants even a single asvattha, wherever it may be, as per the prescribed mode, goes to the abode of Hari.''

:''He who has planted dhatri has performed several sacrifices. He has donated the earth. He would be considered a celebate forever.''

:''He who plant a couple of [[banyan]] trees as per the prescribed mode would go to the abode of Siva and many heavenly nymphs will attend upon him.''

:''After planting [[neem]] trees a person well-versed in [[dharma]] attains the abode of Sun. Indeed! He resides there for a long period.''

:''By planting four [[plaksa]] trees a person doubtlessly obtains the fruits of [[Rajasuya]] sacrifice.''

:''He who plants five or six [[mango]] trees attains the abode of [[Garuda]] and lives happily forever like gods.''

:''One should plant seven palasa trees or even one. One attains the abode of [[Brahma]] and enjoys the company of gods by doing so.''

:''He who himself plants eight [[udumbara]] trees or even prompts someone to plant them, rejoices in the lunar world''

:''He who has planted madhuka has propitiated [[Parvati]], has become free from diseases, and has worshipped all deities.''

:''If one plants ksirini, dadimi, rambha, priyala, and panasa, one experiences no affliction for seven births.''

:''He who has knowingly or unknowingly planted ambu is respected as a recluse even while staying in the house.''

:''By planting all kinds of other trees, useful for fruits and flowers, a person gets a reward of thousand cows adorned with jewels.''

:''By planting one asvattha, one picumanda, one [[nyagrodha]], ten [[tamarind]] trees, the group of three, viz., kapittha, [[bilva]], and amalaka, and five [[mango]] trees, one never visits hell.''&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==Locations==
Sacred groves are scattered all over the country, and are referred to by different names in different parts of India. Sacred groves occur in a variety of places – from [[Deserts and xeric shrublands|scrub forest]]s in the [[Thar Desert]] of [[Rajasthan]] maintained by the [[Bishnoi]]s, to [[rain forest]]s in the [[Western Ghats]] of [[Kerala]]. [[Himachal Pradesh]] in the north and [[Kerala]] in the south are specifically known for their large numbers of sacred groves. The Kodavas of Karnataka alone maintained over 1000 sacred groves in their region.&lt;ref&gt;A [http://www.cseindia.org/dte-supplement/forest20031231/forest-index.htm series] of articles in the journal ''Down to Earth'' on sacred groves&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gurjar]] people of Rajasthan have a unique practice of neem (Azadirachta indica) planting and worshipping as abode of God [[Devnarayan]].Thus, a Gurjjar settlement appears like a human-inhabited sacred grove.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infinityfoundation.com/mandala/t_es/t_es_pande_forest.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly Mangar Bani, last surviving natural forest of Delhi is protected by Gurjars of nearby area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ngtba.org/index.php/news?start=190&lt;&lt;/ref&gt; 14,000 sacred groves have been reported from all over India, which act as reservoirs of rare fauna, and more often rare flora, amid rural and even urban settings. Experts believe that the total number of sacred groves could be as high as 100,000.&lt;ref name = "mal"&gt;Malhotra, K. C., Ghokhale, Y., Chatterjee, S. and Srivastava, S., Cultural and 
Ecological Dimensions of Sacred Groves in India, INSA, New Delhi, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramachandra Guha, The Unquiet Woods, University of California Press, 2000 ({{ISBN|978-0520222359}})&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated{{By whom|date=December 2009}} that around 1000&amp;nbsp;km² of unexploited land is inside sacred groves. Some of the more famous groves are the ''kavu''s of Kerala, which are located in the Western Ghats and have enormous biodiversity; and the ''law kyntang''s of [[Meghalaya]] – sacred groves associated with every village (two large groves being in [[Mawphlang]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://megtourism.gov.in/ecodestination.html Eco Destination . Mawphlang Sacred Forest]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mausmai]]) to appease the forest spirit.

Among the largest sacred groves of India are the ones in [[Hariyali]], near Ganchar in [[Chamoli District]] of [[Uttarakhand]], and the [[Cedrus deodara|Deodar]] grove in [[Shipin]] near [[Shimla|Simla]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]]. Kodagu, a small region of about 4000&amp;nbsp;km² in Karnataka, had over 1000 sacred groves.

All numbers are quoted from the records of the ''C.P.R. Environmental Education Centre'' of the Government of India. Starred numbers are likely to increase. The centre also maintains a complete list of identified sacred groves in India, most of which is online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecoheritage.cpreec.org/innerpageof.php?$mFJyBfKPkE6 Database] at the CPR Environmental Education Centre&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

'''Traditional uses''': One of the most important traditional uses of sacred groves was that it acted as a repository for various [[Ayurvedic]] medicines. Other uses involved a source of replenishable resources like fruits and honey. However, in most  sacred  groves it was taboo to hunt or chop wood. The vegetation cover helps reduce soil erosion and prevents [[desertification]], as in [[Rajasthan]]. The groves are often associated with ponds and streams, and meet water requirements of local communities. They sometimes help in recharging [[aquifer]]s as well.

'''Modern uses''': In modern times, sacred groves have become [[biodiversity hotspot]]s, as various species seek refuge in the areas due to progressive habitat destruction, and hunting. Sacred groves often contain plant and animal species that have become extinct in neighboring areas. They therefore harbor great genetic diversity. Besides this, sacred groves in urban landscapes act as "lungs" to the city as well, providing much needed vegetation cover.

==Threats==
Threats to the grove include [[urbanization]], [[over-exploitation]] of resources (like [[overgrazing]] and excessive firewood collection), and environmental destruction due to religious practices. While many of the groves are looked upon as abodes of Hindu gods, in the recent past a number of them have been partially cleared for construction of shrines and temples.&lt;ref name = "mal"/&gt; Other threats to the sacred groves include invasion by [[invasive species]], like the [[invasive weed]]s ''[[Chromolaena odorata]]'', ''[[Lantana camara]]'' and ''[[Prosopis juliflora]]''.

==Traditions==
A large number of distinct local art forms and folk traditions are associated with the deities of sacred groves, and are an important cultural aspect closely associated with sacred traditions. Ritualistic dances and dramatizations based on the local deities that protect the groves are called ''Theyyam'' in Kerala and ''Nagmandalam'', among other names, in [[Karnataka]]. Often, elaborate rituals and traditions are associated with sacred groves,&lt;ref&gt;Chris A. Gregory, [http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/JSS/JSS-08-0-000-000-2004-Web/JSS-08-2-085-178-2004-Abst-PDF/JSS-08-2-093-104-2004-Gregory/JSS-08-2-093-104-2004-Gregory.pdf The Oral Epics of the Women of the Dandakaranya Plateau: A Preliminary Mapping], J. Soc. Sci., 8(2): 93-104 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; as are associated [[Folklore|folk tale]]s and folk mythology.

A '''kilonova''' (also called a '''macronova''' or '''r-process supernova''') is a [[transient astronomical event]] that occurs in a compact [[binary system]] when two [[neutron star]]s or a neutron star and a [[black hole]] merge into each other. Kilonovae are thought to emit short [[gamma-ray burst]]s and strong electromagnetic radiation due to the [[radioactive decay]] of heavy [[r-process]] nuclei that are produced and ejected fairly [[isotropic]]ally during the merger process.&lt;ref name=Tanvir2013&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature12505 |pmid=23912055 |title=A 'kilonova' associated with the short-duration γ-ray burst GRB 130603B |journal=Nature |volume=500 |issue=7464 |pages=547–9 |year=2013 |last1=Tanvir |first1=N.

L. |arxiv=1306.4971 |bibcode=2013Natur.500..547T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''kilonova'' was introduced by Metzger ''et al.'' in 2010&lt;ref name=Metzger2010/&gt; to characterize the peak brightness, which they showed reaches 1000 times that of a classical [[nova]]. They are 1/10th to 1/100th the brightness of a typical supernova, the self-detonation of a massive star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hubble captures infrared glow of a kilonova blast |url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/opo1329a/ |publisher=spacetelescope.org |date=5 August 2013 |accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first kilonova to be found was detected as a short [[gamma-ray burst]], sGRB 130603B, by instruments on board the [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Explorer]] and [[WIND (spacecraft)|KONUS/WIND]] spacecrafts and then observed using the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].&lt;ref name=Tanvir2013/&gt;

In October 2018, astronomers reported that [[GRB 150101B]], a [[gamma-ray burst]] event detected in 2015, may be analogous to the historic [[GW170817]], a [[gravitational wave]] event detected in 2017, and associated with the [[Neutron star merger|merger]] of two [[neutron star]]s. The similarities between the two events, in terms of [[gamma ray]], [[optical]] and [[x-ray]] emissions, as well as to the nature of the associated host [[Galaxy|galaxies]], are considered "striking", and this remarkable resemblance suggests the two separate and independent events may both be the result of the merger of neutron stars, and both may be a hitherto-unknown class of kilonova transients. Kilonova events, therefore, may be more diverse and common in the universe than previously understood, according to the researchers.&lt;ref name="EA-20181016"&gt;{{cite news |author=[[University of Maryland]] |title=All in the family: Kin of gravitational wave source discovered - New observations suggest that kilonovae -- immense cosmic explosions that produce silver, gold and platinum--may be more common than thought |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-10/uom-ait101518.php |date=16 October 2018 |work=[[EurekAlert!]] |accessdate=17 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NC-20181016"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Troja, E. et al. |title=A luminous blue kilonova and an off-axis jet from a compact binary merger at z = 0.1341 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06558-7 |date=16 October 2018 |journal=[[Nature Communications]] |volume=9 |number=4089 (2018) |doi=10.1038/s41467-018-06558-7 |accessdate=17 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20181016"&gt;{{cite news |last=Mohon |first=Lee |title=GRB 150101B: A Distant Cousin to GW170817 |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/images/grb-150101b-a-distant-cousin-to-gw170817.html |date=16 October 2018 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=17 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SPC-20181017"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wall |first=Mike |title=Powerful Cosmic Flash Is Likely Another Neutron-Star Merger |url=https://www.space.com/42158-another-neutron-star-crash-detected.html |date=17 October 2018 |work=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=17 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first observational suggestion of a kilonova came in 2008 following the [[Gamma-ray burst|short-hard gamma-ray burst]] GRB 080503&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Perley |first=D. A. |last2=Metzger |first2=B. D. |last3=Granot |first3=J. |last4=Butler |first4=N. R. |last5=Sakamoto |first5=T. |last6=Ramirez-Ruiz |first6=E. |last7=Levan |first7=A. J. |last8=Bloom |first8=J.

Another kilonova was suggested in 2013, in association with the [[gamma-ray burst#Short gamma-ray bursts|short-duration gamma-ray burst]] GRB 130603B, where the faint [[infrared]] emission from the distant kilonova was detected using the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].&lt;ref name=Tanvir2013/&gt; 
 
On October 16, 2017, the [[LIGO]] and [[Virgo interferometer|Virgo]] collaborations announced the first simultaneous detections of [[gravitational waves]] ([[GW170817]]) and electromagnetic radiation ([[GRB 170817A]], [[SSS17a]]) of any phenomena,&lt;ref name="Abbott et al. 2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abbott |first1=B.

=== Notes ===
{{Reflist|group="note"}}

{{mp|2015 AQ|43}} may have passed as close as {{convert|0.00012|AU|km mi|abbr=on}} (0.05 Lunar Distances) from the Earth on January 15, 2010, but the nominal distance suggests it only passed 5 LD away.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8129">A '''drainage basin''' is an extent of land where water from rain and melting snow or ice drains downhill into a body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea or ocean. The drainage basin includes both the streams and rivers that convey the water as well as the land surfaces from which water drains into those channels, and is separated from adjacent basins by a drainage divide.

The drainage basin acts like a funnel, collecting all the water within the area covered by the basin and channelling it into a waterway. Each drainage basin is separated topographically from adjacent basins by a geographical barrier such as a ridge, hill or mountain, which is known as a water divide.

Other terms that are used to describe a drainage basin are catchment, catchment area, catchment basin, drainage area, river basin, water basin and watershed.

The drainage basins in South Africa do not correspond with the [[Water Management Areas]], and have the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, and X. The Area A comes close to the same area that the [[Limpopo WMA]] seems to cover. Apart from these letters they seem to have no name referring to them. What seems to be the case though is that each area refers to some major river systems and their tributaries (a region for each major river system). __NOTOC__

This is a '''list of earthquakes in Egypt''', including [[earthquake]]s that either had their [[epicenter]] in [[Egypt]], or caused significant damage in Egypt.

==Seismic hazard==

Seismic hazard in Egypt is highest at the southern end of the [[Gulf of Suez]], the northern [[Red Sea]] and around the [[Gulf of Aqaba]], the location of the active plate boundaries. The highest risk is the southern end of the [[Dead Sea Transform]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2766">A small number of '''[[Galaxy|galaxies]]''' or [[Galaxy groups and clusters|galaxy group]]s have been named after individual people. In most cases, the named individual was the person who discovered the object, who first brought attention to it, or who first studied it scientifically.

Many of the brighter galaxies visible from the [[Northern Hemisphere]] have [[Messier object|Messier]] numbers, named after [[Charles Messier]]. For instance, the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] is Messier 31 and the [[Whirlpool Galaxy]] is Messier 51. There are a few other comprehensive catalogs that assign the cataloguer's name to galaxies. For instance, [[Markarian galaxies]], named after [[Benjamin Markarian]], are galaxies with excess blue and ultraviolet emission;&lt;ref&gt;B. E. Markarian (1967), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994yCat.7061....0M  A catalog of Markarian galaxies], ''Astrofizika'' '''3''', 55&lt;/ref&gt; galaxies in the [[Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies]] are assigned an Arp number after [[Halton Arp]] who produced the catalog; etc.  Objects in these catalogs are excluded below, except in cases where they carry the name of an additional person.

The following is a '''list of [[mountain]]s in [[Myanmar]] (Burma)'''. The elevations are in metres. For the names of the mountains in the [[Latin script]] the most common transcription has been adopted.

'''Note''':

Many mountains in the country are important not because of their height, but because of their symbolic and cultural significance. Some mountains have Buddhist worship places on top. Since the order of height is convenient, the list follows this order, without in any way intending to diminish or promote the importance of any particular mountain.

* [[Molina – Alto Tajo Geopark]] is located in Castile – La Mancha region, in Guadalajara Province, about 200 km north-east of Madrid. Geographically, the region of Molina is part of the southern Iberian plateau between the river Ebro to the north and the Tagus River to the south. These rivers strongly marked the Geopark’s landscape, flora, fauna, and human settlement. The geological heritage interest of the Geopark is based on large continuous sedimentary series, ranging from the Ordovician to the present. They constitute a record of major events from the last 400 million years of Earth history. More than 20 sections of archetypical geological formations telling this story have been identified by scientists, with geological stratotypes and boundaries of international interest. The area has been inhabited since ancient times, and includes important samples of Palaeolithic rock art and Celtiberian fortresses that have provided valuable information about the Celtberian culture.

* 1975 On September 7, a gas gathering pipeline failed due to internal and external corrosion near [[Kilgore, Texas]]. Unodorized natural gas liquids from leak were ignited by an automobile, killing 5 people.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/PAB-78-01.pdf |format=PDF |title=Pipeline Accident Reports - Brief Format : Issue 1 |date=1977 |website=Ntsb.gov |accessdate=2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1975 On September 19, flooding along the [[Amite River]] in [[Louisiana]] caused a 12-inch propane pipeline to break, releasing about 743,000 gallons of propane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/document.cfm?docID=299977&amp;docketID=44911&amp;mkey=67002 |title=Document 1 Materials Lab Factual Report 07-122 Filing Date May 22, 2008 61 page(s) of Text (PDF) Photos |publisher=Dms.ntsb.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1975 On October 13, employees at a gas processing plant at [[Goldsmith, Texas]] heard leak gas, and investigated. Before the leak could be found, a 12-inch pipeline there exploded, killing 3 of the crew, injuring 2 others, and causing extensive plant damage.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;
* 1975 On December 18, a failed pressure relief device caused cracks in storage tanks supporting the [[Trans-Alaskan Pipeline System]], leaking about 600,000 gallons of crude oil in [[Prudhoe Bay, Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vdsjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GSkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6865,4269519&amp;dq=pipeline+leak&amp;hl=en|title=The Milwaukee Journal - Google News Archive Search|work=google.com|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1976===
* 1976 On January 7, a repair crew working on natural gas gathering compressor station at [[Cedardale, Oklahoma]], opened the wrong valve in an attempt to increase gas flow. Natural gas &amp; Natural Gas Liquids flow out of an open 12-inch pipeline, and were ignited by an open flame heater. 5 of the crew were killed, and 2 seriously burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/_layouts/ntsb.recsearch/Recommendation.aspx?Rec=P-76-026 |title=Safety Recommendation P-76-026 |publisher=Ntsb.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1976 On January 10, a gas leak at the Pathfinder Hotel in [[Fremont, Nebraska]], exploded, killing 23 people. A compression coupling on a gas line had pulled apart, causing gas to leak into the Hotel's basement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/safety/safety-recs/_layouts/ntsb.recsearch/Recommendation.aspx?Rec=P-76-003 |title=Safety Recommendation P-76-003 |publisher=Ntsb.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1976 A [[MAPCO]] LPG/NGL pipeline ruptured near [[Whitharral, Texas]], leading to vapor cloud fire that killed one, severely burning 4 others who later died, destroyed two homes, and burned an area about 400 yards wide. A Low Frequency Electric Resistance Weld (LF-[[Electric resistance welding|ERW]]) seam failure is suspected for the failure. From January 1968 to the date of the Whitharral accident, 14 longitudinal pipe seam failures had occurred on that pipeline system, which resulted in 6 other fatalities, and the loss of over {{convert|60000|oilbbl|m3}} of LPG.(February 25, 1976)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/safety/safety-recs/recletters/P76_22_25.pdf |format=PDF |title=National Transportation Safety Board |date=June 14, 1976 |website=Ntsb.gov |accessdate=2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.gendisasters.com/node/16862 |title=Whitharral, TX Gas Line Explosion, Feb 1976 &amp;#124; GenDisasters ...

* On March 2, at Alyeska Pipeline Service Company, Pump Station #6 located near the Yukon River in Alaska, the topping unit producing turbine fuel experienced a flame out of the flare stack which burns flammable tail gas from the unit.  Automatic ignition apparatus did not function due to the extreme low temperature of -25F.  A safety professional on staff was tasked with climbing the stack and re-igniting the flare manually.  Once ignition was established, and before the safety professional could climb down from the top catwalk platform, station management ordered the combustion blower to be turned on and tail gas pressure to be increased from 3psi to 11psi.  The action resulted in a surge through the knock out drum at the base of the stack, causing residual oil and naphtha to be blown up the stack, covering the top catwalk and approximately the top 60 feet of the stack in burning petroleum.  The safety professional was severely burned and fell through the stack main access ladder components and iron work 115 feet to the ground.  The occurrence did not result in a fatality, however, fire damaged the stack and petroleum contaminated the surrounding base area.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

* 1986 Early on July 8, a [[Williams Companies]] petroleum products pipeline ruptured in [[Mounds View, Minnesota]]. Gasoline at 1,434 psi sprayed a residential area around 4:20&amp;nbsp;am local time, then ignited. A woman and her 7-year-old daughter suffered fatal burns, at least two others were injured, and many homes damaged or destroyed. Confusion by the pipeline company led to a delay in shutting down the pipeline. Electrical resistance welded ([[Electric resistance welding|ERW]]) seam failure caused the rupture. Prior to this accident, this pipeline, installed in 1957, had 16 seam failures during hydrostatic testing, and 7 seam failures during operations until 1984. In 1984, 16 more seams failed during a hydrostatic test. Problems with cathodic protection were also noted before the 1986 accident. During a hydrostatic test of this pipeline following the accident, 3 ERW seams failed. Studies of available data by OPS staff in early 1988 showed that ERW seams have been involved in 145 service failures in both hazardous liquid and natural gas pipelines since 1970 to early 1988, and that of these failures, all but 2 occurred on pipe manufactured prior to 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/PAR8702.pdf |format=PDF |title=National Transportation Safety Board : Pipeline Accident Report |date=July 8, 1986 |website=Ntsb.gov |accessdate=2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/12564991.html |title=July 9, 1986: Gasoline pipeline explodes in Mounds View|accessdate=February 4, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427142920/http://www.startribune.com/local/12564991.html |archivedate=April 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/staticfiles/PHMSA/DownloadableFiles/Files/Advisory%20Bulletin%20Files/xALN-88-01.pdf |format=PDF |title=Alert Notice : Recent findings relative to factors contributing to operational failures of pipelines constructed with ERW prior to 1970. |website=Phmsa.dot.gov |accessdate=2016-01-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304102324/http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/staticfiles/PHMSA/DownloadableFiles/Files/Advisory%20Bulletin%20Files/xALN-88-01.pdf# |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/templates/Print_This_Story?sid=12564991|title=July 9, 1986: Gasoline pipeline explodes in Mounds View|work=startribune.com|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mycommittees.api.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mycommittees.api.org/standards/ecs/sc5/Technical%20Papers/electricresistanceweldfailures.pdf |format=PDF |title=Electric Resistance Weld Pipe Failures on Hazardous Liquid and Gas Transmission Pipelines |website=Mycommittees.api.org |accessdate=2016-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304094851/http://mycommittees.api.org/standards/ecs/sc5/Technical%20Papers/electricresistanceweldfailures.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The force of the escaping gas killed one worker (a welder), injured five other workers, and collapsed a steel pit that housed valve H-143.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/recletters/1992/P92_21_22.pdf|title=Safety Recommendations |accessdate=February 4, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622083225/http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/recletters/1992/P92_21_22.pdf |archivedate=June 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1999 A Lakehead Pipeline (now [[Enbridge]]) was damaged by outside force on November 1, near [[Crystal Falls, Michigan]]. 400 people were evacuated from the area. Fire was used to burn some of the released substances, so, of about 223,000 gallons of NGL's and crude oil spilled, only about 115,000 gallons were recovered, with over 2,100 yards of contaminated soil removed in just the first 2 weeks of cleaning. The pipe broke where it was on a rock in the pipeline trench.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19991112&amp;id=zQ0wAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3wMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4565,3957948|title=Toledo Blade - Google News Archive Search|work=google.com|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1999 On November 19, 2 men were injured in [[Salt Flat, Texas]], when a leaking 8-inch propane pipeline exploded. 2 school buses had passed through the area moments before the explosion. About 6,195 barrels of propane were leaked.

In [[Roman mythology]], '''Marica''' was a [[nymph]], the mother of [[Latinus]].&lt;ref&gt;Rose HJ, A Handbook of Greek Mythology, First Edition 1928&lt;/ref&gt; Latinus was fathered by [[Faunus]], who was also occasionally referred to as the son of Marica. The sacred forest near [[Minturno|Minturnae]] was dedicated to Marica.  A lake nearby was also named after her. Various Roman authors claims that she was a form of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] or [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]].

[[Image:MareSmithiiTG.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Topography]] (top) and corresponding [[gravity]] (bottom) signal of [[Moon|lunar]] [[Mare Smythii]] containing a significant mascon.]]

In [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]], a '''mass concentration''' (or '''mascon''') is a region of a planet or moon's crust that contains a large positive [[Gravity anomaly|gravitational anomaly]]. In general, the word "mascon" can be used as a noun to refer to an excess distribution of mass on or beneath the surface of an astronomical body (with respect to some suitable average), such as is found around [[Hawaii]] on Earth.&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seismo.berkeley.edu/~rallen/eps122/lectures/L17.pdf |title=Gravitational Constraints (Lecture 17) |page=9 |author=Richard Allen |work=Berkeley course: Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors |accessdate=2009-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this term is most often used to describe a geologic structure that has a positive gravitational anomaly associated with a feature (e.g. depressed basin) that might otherwise have been expected to have a negative anomaly, such as the "mascon basins" on the [[Moon]].

Typical examples of mascon basins on the Moon are the [[Mare Imbrium|Imbrium]], [[Mare Serenitatis|Serenitatis]], [[Mare Crisium|Crisium]] and [[Mare Orientale|Orientale]] impact basins, all of which exhibit significant topographic depressions and positive gravitational anomalies. Examples of mascon basins on [[Mars]] include the [[Argyre Planitia|Argyre]], [[Isidis Planitia|Isidis]], and [[Utopia Planitia|Utopia]] basins. Theoretical considerations imply that a topographic low in [[Isostasy|isostatic equilibrium]] would exhibit a slight negative gravitational anomaly. Thus, the positive gravitational anomalies associated with these impact basins indicate that some form of positive density anomaly must exist within the crust or upper mantle that is currently supported by the [[lithosphere]]. One possibility is that these anomalies are due to dense [[Lunar mare|mare basaltic lavas]], which might reach up to 6 kilometers in thickness for the Moon. While these lavas certainly contribute to the observed gravitational anomalies, uplift of the crust-mantle interface is also required to account for their magnitude. Indeed, some mascon basins on the Moon do not appear to be associated with any signs of volcanic activity. Theoretical considerations in either case indicate that all the lunar mascons are super-isostatic (that is, supported above their isostatic positions). The huge expanse of mare basaltic volcanism associated with [[Oceanus Procellarum]] does not possess a positive gravitational anomaly.

Because of its mascons, the [[Moon]] has only four "[[frozen orbit]]" inclination zones where a lunar satellite can stay in a low orbit indefinitely. Lunar subsatellites were released on two of the last three [[Apollo program|Apollo]] manned lunar landing missions in 1971 and 1972; the subsatellite [[PFS-2]] released from [[Apollo 16]] was expected to stay in orbit for one and a half years, but lasted only 35 days before crashing into the lunar surface. It was only in 2001 that the mascons were mapped and the frozen orbits were discovered.&lt;ref name=nasa20061106&gt;
{{cite web |title=Bizarre Lunar Orbits|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2006/06nov_loworbit/ |work=NASA Science:  Science News |date=2006-11-06 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of lunar mascons==
Since their identification in 1968, the origin of the mascons beneath the surface of the Moon has been subject to much debate, but is now regarded as being the result of the impact of [[asteroids]] during the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://phys.org/news/2013-05-team-moon-mascons-mystery.html Team solves the origin of the Moon's 'mascons' mystery Phys.Org website news May 30, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of lunar mascons on satellite orbits==
Lunar mascons alter the local gravity above and around them sufficiently that low and uncorrected satellite [[orbit]]s around the Moon are unstable on a timescale of months or years. The small perturbations in the orbits accumulate and eventually distort the orbit enough that the satellite impacts the surface.

The [[Luna 10|Luna-10]] orbiter was the first artificial object to orbit the Moon and it returned tracking data indicating that the lunar gravitational field caused larger than expected perturbations presumably due to 'roughness' of the lunar gravitational field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sse.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?Sort=Target&amp;Target=Moon&amp;MCode=Luna_10 |title=Luna 10 (NASA) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218232128/http://sse.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?Sort=Target&amp;Target=Moon&amp;MCode=Luna_10 |archivedate=2012-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lunar mascons were discovered by Paul M. Muller and William L. Sjogren of the NASA [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) in 1968&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paul Muller |author2=William Sjogren |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Mascons: lunar mass concentrations |journal=Science |volume=161 |issue=3842 |pages=680–684 |date=1968 |doi=10.1126/science.161.3842.680 |pmid=17801458 |bibcode=1968Sci...161..680M}}&lt;/ref&gt; from a new analytic method applied to the highly precise navigation data from the unmanned pre-Apollo [[Lunar Orbiter]] spacecraft. This discovery observed the consistent 1:1 correlation between very large positive gravity anomalies and depressed circular basins on the Moon. This fact places key limits on models attempting to follow the history of the Moon's geological development and explain the current lunar internal structures.

At that time, one of NASA's highest priority "[[tiger team]]" projects was to explain why the Lunar Orbiter spacecraft being used to test the accuracy of [[Project Apollo]] navigation were experiencing errors in predicted position of ten times the mission specification (2 kilometers instead of 200 meters). This meant that the predicted landing areas were 100 times as large as those being carefully defined for reasons of safety. Lunar orbital effects principally resulting from the strong gravitational perturbations of the mascons were ultimately revealed as the cause. William Wollenhaupt and Emil Schiesser of the NASA [[Manned Spacecraft Center]] in Houston then worked out the "fix" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/SchiesserER/SchiesserER_11-2-06.pdf |title=NASA JOHNSON  SPACE  CENTER  ORAL  HISTORY  PROJECT Oral History Transcript |author=Jennifer Ross-Nazzal |date=2 November 2006 |website=NASA Johnson Space Center |publisher= |access-date=12 November 2015 |quote=Bill [Wilbur R.] Wollenhaupt from JPL joined my group.

True alignment errors in excess of that could present ascent guidance problems.

[[File:Cyanobacteria (250 22) Native preparation.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Most minerals on [[Earth]] formed after [[photosynthesis]] by [[cyanobacteria]] (pictured) began adding oxygen to the atmosphere.]]
'''Mineral evolution''' is a theory that provides historical context to [[mineralogy]]. It postulates that mineralogy on planets and moons becomes increasingly complex as a result of changes in the physical, chemical and biological environment. In the [[Solar System]], the number of [[List of minerals (complete)|mineral species]] has grown from about a dozen to over 5300 as a result of three processes: separation and concentration of elements; greater ranges of temperature and pressure coupled with the action of volatiles; and new chemical pathways provided by living organisms.

On Earth, there were three eras of mineral evolution. The birth of the Sun and formation of asteroids and planets increased the number of minerals to about 250. Repeated reworking of the [[crust (geology)|crust]] and [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] through processes such as partial melting and [[plate tectonics]] increased the total to about 1500. The remaining minerals, more than 2/3 of the total, were the result of chemical changes mediated by living organisms, with the largest increase occurring after the [[Great Oxygenation Event]].

==Use of the term "evolution"==
In the 2008 paper that introduced the term "mineral evolution", [[Robert Hazen]] and co-authors recognized that an application of the word "evolution" to minerals is likely to be controversial, although there were precedents as far back as the 1928 book ''The Evolution of the Igneous Rocks'' by [[Norman L. Bowen|Norman Bowen]]. They used the term in the sense of an irreversible sequence of events leading to increasingly complex and diverse assemblages of minerals.&lt;ref name=urPaper/&gt; Unlike [[evolution|biological evolution]], it does not involve [[mutation]], [[Competition (biology)|competition]] or [[heredity|passing of information to progeny]]. Hazen et al. explored some other analogies, including the idea of [[extinction]]. Some mineral-forming processes no longer occur, such as those that produced certain minerals in [[enstatite chondrite]]s that are unstable on Earth in its oxidized state. Also, the [[runaway greenhouse effect]] on [[Venus]] may have led to permanent losses of mineral species.&lt;ref name=urPaper/&gt;&lt;ref name=complexity&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hazen |first1=R. M. |last2=Eldredge |first2=N. |title=Themes and Variations in Complex Systems |journal=Elements |date=22 February 2010 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=43–46 |doi=10.2113/gselements.6.1.43}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, mineral extinction is not truly irreversible; a lost mineral could emerge again if suitable environmental conditions were re-established.&lt;ref name=Rosing&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosing|first1=Minik T.|title=Earth science: On the evolution of minerals|journal=Nature|date=27 November 2008|volume=456|issue=7221|pages=456–458|doi=10.1038/456456a|pmid=19037307|bibcode=2008Natur.456..456R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presolar minerals==
[[File:Murchison-meteorite-stardust.jpg|thumb|[[Presolar grains]] ("stardust") from the [[Murchison meteorite]] provide information on the first minerals.]]
In the early Universe, there were no minerals because the only elements available were [[hydrogen]], [[helium]] and trace amounts of [[lithium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WMAP Big Bang Elements Test |url=https://wmap.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/bb_tests_ele.html |website=WMAP's universe |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mineral formation became possible after heavier elements, including [[carbon]], oxygen, [[silicon]] and [[nitrogen]], were synthesized in stars. In the expanding atmospheres of [[red giant]]s and the ejecta from [[supernova]]e, microscopic minerals formed at temperatures above 1500 degrees [[Celsius]] (°C).&lt;ref name=McCoy&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McCoy |first1=T. J. |title=Mineralogical Evolution of Meteorites |journal=Elements |date=22 February 2010 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=19–23 |doi=10.2113/gselements.6.1.19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=urPaper&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hazen |first1=R.

Evidence of these minerals can be found in interstellar grains incorporated into primitive [[meteorite]]s called [[chondrite]]s, which are "essentially cosmic sedimentary rocks".&lt;ref name=McCoy/&gt; The number of known species is roughly a dozen, although several more materials have been identified but not classified as minerals.&lt;ref name=McCoy/&gt; Because it has a high crystallization temperature (about 4400 degrees Celsius), [[diamond]] was probably the first mineral to form.&lt;ref name=Hadean&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hazen |first1=R.

==Processes==
After the formation of the Solar system, mineral evolution was driven by three primary mechanisms: the separation and concentration of elements; greater ranges of temperature and pressure combined with chemical action of volatiles; and new reaction pathways driven by living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hazen |first1=Robert |title=Mineral Evolution |url=https://hazen.carnegiescience.edu/research/mineral-evolution |website=Carnegie Science |accessdate=12 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Separation and concentration===

[[File:Terrestial Planets internal en.jpg|thumb|Cutaway views of some [[terrestrial planet]]s, showing the layers.]]
The highest level in the classification of minerals is based on chemical composition.&lt;ref name=Jolyon&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jolyon |first1=Ralph |title=Did life change Earth's geology? |journal=Astronomy |date=November 2012 |volume=40 |issue=11 |pages=44–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the defining elements for many mineral groups, such as [[boron]] in [[borate minerals|borates]] and [[phosphorus]] in [[phosphate minerals|phosphates]], were at first only present in concentrations of parts per million or less. This left little or no chance for them to come together and form minerals until external influences concentrated them.&lt;ref name=HazenAeon&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hazen |first1=Robert |title=How life made the earth into a cosmic marvel |url=https://aeon.co/essays/how-life-made-the-earth-into-a-cosmic-marvel |website=Aeon |date=24 June 2014 |accessdate=13 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Processes that separate and concentrate elements include [[planetary differentiation]] (for example, separation into layers such as a [[Planetary core|core]] and mantle); [[outgassing]]; [[Fractional crystallization (geology)|fractional crystallization]]; and [[partial melting]].&lt;ref name=urPaper/&gt;

Allowable combinations of elements in minerals are determined by thermodynamics; for an element to be added to a crystal at a given location, it must reduce the energy. At higher temperatures, many elements are interchangeable in minerals such as [[olivine]].&lt;ref name=Rosing/&gt; As a planet cools, minerals became exposed to a greater range of [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive variables]] such as temperature and pressure,&lt;ref name=urPaper/&gt; allowing the formation of new phases and more specialized combinations of elements such as [[clay minerals]] and [[zeolite]]s.&lt;ref name=Rosing/&gt; New minerals are formed when volatile compounds such as [[water]], [[carbon dioxide]] and [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] react with them. Environments such as [[ice cap]]s, [[dry lake]]s, and exhumed [[metamorphic rock]] have distinctive suites of minerals.&lt;ref name=urPaper/&gt;

===Biological influence===
Life has made dramatic changes in the environment. Most dramatic was the Great Oxygenation Event, about 2.4 billion years ago, in which [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] organisms flooded the atmosphere with oxygen. Living organisms also catalyze reactions, creating minerals such as [[aragonite]] that are not in equilibrium with their surroundings.&lt;ref name=urPaper/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fourth/&gt;

==Chronology==
Before the formation of the Solar System, there were about 12 minerals.&lt;ref name=McCoy/&gt; The estimate for the current number of minerals has been changing rapidly. In 2008, it was 4300,&lt;ref name=urPaper/&gt; but as of April 2018 there were 5312 officially recognized mineral species.&lt;ref name=IMAMineralsCount&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nrmima.nrm.se//imalist.htm | title=The New IMA List of Minerals  – A Work in Progress | publisher=[[International Mineralogical Association|IMA]] – CNMNC (Commission on New Minerals Nomenclature and Classification) | website=The New IMA List of Minerals | date=November 2017 | accessdate=1 March 2018 | author=Pasero, Marco et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their chronology for Earth, Hazen et al. (2008) separated the changes in mineral abundance into three broad intervals: [[planetary accretion]] up to 4.55 Ga (billion years ago); reworking of Earth's crust and mantle between 4.55 Ga and 2.5 Ga; and biological influences after 2.5 Ga.&lt;ref name=urPaper/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fourth/&gt; They further divided the ages into 10 intervals, some of which overlap. In addition, some of the dates are uncertain; for example, estimates of the onset of modern plate tectonics range from 4.5 Ga to 1.0 Ga.&lt;ref name=Bradley&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bradley|first1=D.

===Planetary accretion===
[[File:Allende meteorite, carbonaceous chondrite (14787764392).jpg|thumb|Cross-section of a chondrite containing round olivine chondrules and irregular white CAIs.]]
[[File:Esquel.jpg|thumb|Sample of a [[pallasite]] with olivine crystals in an iron-nickel matrix.]]
In the first era, the Sun ignited, heating the surrounding [[molecular cloud]]. 60 new minerals were produced and were preserved as inclusions in chondrites. The accretion of dust into asteroids and planets, bombardments, heating and reactions with water raised the number to 250.&lt;ref name=Condie/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fourth/&gt;

====Stage 1: Sun ignites====
Before 4.56 Ga, the [[presolar nebula]] was a dense molecular cloud consisting of hydrogen and helium gas with dispersed dust grains. When the Sun ignited and entered its [[T Tauri star|T-Tauri phase]], it melted nearby dust grains. Some of the melt droplets were incorporated into chondrites as small spherical objects called [[chondrules]].&lt;ref name=Fourth/&gt; Almost all chondrites also contain [[calcium–aluminium-rich inclusion]]s (CAIs), the earliest materials formed in the Solar System.&lt;ref name=McCoy/&gt; From an examination of chondrites from this era, 60 new minerals can be identified with crystal structures from all of the [[crystal system]]s.&lt;ref name=McCoy/&gt; These included the first [[iron-nickel alloy]]s, [[Sulfide minerals|sulfides]], [[phosphide]]s, and several silicates and [[oxide minerals|oxides]].&lt;ref name=Fourth/&gt; Among the most important were magnesium-rich olivine, magnesium-rich [[pyroxene]], and [[plagioclase]]. Some rare minerals, produced in oxygen-poor environments no longer found on Earth, can be found in enstatite chondrites.&lt;ref name=McCoy/&gt;

====Stage 2: Planetesimals form====
Soon after the new minerals formed in Stage 1, they began to clump together, forming [[asteroid]]s and planets. One of the most important new minerals was [[ice]]; the early Solar System had a "snow line" separating rocky planets and asteroids from ice-rich [[gas giant]]s, asteroids and [[comet]]s. Heating from [[radionuclide]]s melted the ice and the water reacted with olivine-rich rocks, forming [[phyllosilicate]]s, oxides such as [[magnetite]], sulfides such as [[pyrrhotite]], the [[carbonate]]s [[dolomite]] and [[calcite]], and [[sulfate]]s such as [[gypsum]]. Shock and heat from bombardment and eventual melting produced minerals such as [[ringwoodite]], a major component of Earth's mantle.&lt;ref name=McCoy/&gt;

Eventually, asteroids heated enough for partial melting to occur, producing melts rich in pyroxene and plagioclase (capable of producing [[basalt]]) and a variety of [[phosphate]]s. [[Siderophile element|Siderophile]] (metal-loving) and [[lithophile]] (silicate-loving) elements separated, leading to the formation of a core and crust, and [[incompatible element]]s were sequestered in the melts.&lt;ref name=McCoy/&gt; The resulting minerals have been preserved in a type of stony meteorite, [[eucrite]] ([[quartz]], potassium [[feldspar]], [[titanite]] and [[zircon]]) and in [[iron meteorite|iron-nickel meteorites]] (iron-nickel alloys such as [[kamacite]] and [[taenite]]; [[transition metal]] sulfides such as [[troilite]]; [[Native element minerals|carbides and phosphides]]).&lt;ref name=urPaper/&gt; An estimated 250 new minerals formed in this stage.&lt;ref name=Fourth/&gt;&lt;ref name=Condie/&gt;

===Crust and mantle reworking===
[[File:Zircon-83147.jpg|thumb|A zircon crystal.]]

[[File:Subduction-en.svg|thumb|Schematic of a subduction zone.]]

The second era in the history of mineral evolution began with the massive impact that formed the Moon. This melted most of the crust and mantle. Early mineralogy was determined by crystallization of igneous rocks and further bombardments. This phase was then replaced by extensive recycling of crust and mantle, so that at the end of this era there were about 1500 mineral species. However, few of the rocks survived from this period so the timing of many events remains uncertain.&lt;ref name=urPaper/&gt;

====Stage 3: Igneous processes====
Stage 3 began with a crust made of [[mafic]] (high in iron and magnesium) and [[ultramafic]] rocks such as basalt. These rocks were repeatedly recycled by fractional melting, fractional crystallization and separation of [[magma]]s that refuse to mix. An example of such a process is [[Bowen's reaction series]].&lt;ref name=urPaper/&gt;

One of the few sources of direct information on mineralogy in this stage is mineral inclusions in zircon crystals, which date back as far as 4.4 Ga. Among the minerals in the inclusions are quartz, [[muscovite]], [[biotite]], [[potassium feldspar]], [[albite]], [[chlorite]] and [[hornblende]].&lt;ref name=Papineau&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Papineau |first1=D. |title=Mineral Environments on the Earliest Earth |journal=Elements |date=22 February 2010 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=25–30 |doi=10.2113/gselements.6.1.25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a volatile-poor body such as [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and the Moon, the above processes give rise to about 350 mineral species. Water and other volatiles, if present, increase the total. Earth was volatile-rich, with an atmosphere composed of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water, and an ocean that became steadily more saline. [[Volcanism]], outgassing and [[Mineral hydration|hydration]] gave rise to [[hydroxide minerals|hydroxides]], [[hydrate]]s, [[carbonate minerals|carbonates]] and [[evaporite]]s. For Earth, where this stage coincides with the [[Hadean]] Eon, the total number of widely occurring minerals is estimated to be 420, with over 100 more that were rare.&lt;ref name=Hadean/&gt; [[Mars]] probably reached this stage of mineral evolution.&lt;ref name=urPaper/&gt;

====Stage 4: Granitoids and pegmatite formation====
Given sufficient heat, basalt was remelted to form [[granitoid]]s, coarse-grained rocks similar to granite. Cycles of melting concentrated rare elements such as lithium, [[beryllium]], boron, [[niobium]], [[tantalum]] and [[uranium]] to the point where they could form 500 new minerals. Many of these are concentrated in exceptionally coarse-grained rocks called [[pegmatite]]s that are typically found in [[dike (geology)|dikes]] and [[vein (geology)|veins]] near larger igneous masses. Venus may have achieved this level of evolution.&lt;ref name=Fourth/&gt;

====Stage 5: Plate tectonics====
With the onset of plate tectonics, [[subduction]] carried crust and water down, leading to fluid-rock interactions and more concentration of rare elements. In particular, sulfide deposits were formed with 150 new [[sulfosalt minerals]]. Subduction also carried cooler rock into the mantle and exposed it to higher pressures, resulting in new phases that were later uplifted and exposed as [[metamorphic mineral]]s such as [[kyanite]] and [[sillimanite]].&lt;ref name=Fourth/&gt;

===Biologically mediated mineralogy===
[[File:Collenia undosa Minnesota.jpg|thumb|[[Stromatolite]] fossil in section of a 2.1 Ga [[banded iron formation]].]]
[[File:Curit mineralogisches museum bonn.jpg|thumb|[[Curite]], a [[lead]] uranium oxide mineral.]]
The inorganic processes described in the previous section produced about 1500 mineral species. The remaining more than 2/3 of Earth's minerals are the result of the transformation of Earth by living organisms.&lt;ref name=Fourth/&gt; The largest contribution was from the enormous increase in the oxygen content of the atmosphere, starting with the Great Oxygenation Event.&lt;ref name=Gross/&gt; Living organisms also started to produce [[skeleton]]s and other forms of [[biomineralization]].&lt;ref name=Dove/&gt; Minerals such as calcite, metal oxides and many clay minerals could be considered [[biosignatures]],&lt;ref name=Yeager&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yeager|first1=Ashley|title=Microbes drove Earth's mineral evolution |journal=Nature |date=14 November 2008|doi=10.1038/news.2008.1226 |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2008/081114/full/news.2008.1226.html |accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with gems such as [[turquoise]], [[azurite]] and [[malachite]].&lt;ref name=HazenBook/&gt;{{rp|177}}

====Stage 6: Biology in an anoxic world====
Before about 2.45 Ga, there was very little oxygen in the atmosphere. Life may have played a role in the precipitation of massive carbonate layers near continental margins and in the deposition of banded iron formations,&lt;ref name=urPaper/&gt; but there is no unambiguous evidence of the effect of life on minerals.&lt;ref name=Papineau/&gt;

====Stage 7: Great Oxygenation Event====
Starting around 2.45 Ga and continuing to about 2.0 or 1.9 Ga, there was a dramatic rise in the oxygen content of the lower atmosphere, continents and oceans called the Great Oxygenation Event or Great Oxidation Event (GOE). Before the GOE, elements that can be in multiple oxidation states were restricted to the lowest state, and that limited the variety of minerals they could form. In older sediments, the minerals [[siderite]] (FeCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[uraninite]] (UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[pyrite]] (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are commonly found. These oxidize rapidly when exposed to an atmosphere with oxygen, yet this did not occur even after extensive weathering and transport.&lt;ref name=Sverjensky&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sverjensky |first1=D. A. |last2=Lee |first2=N. |title=The Great Oxidation Event and Mineral Diversification |journal=Elements |date=22 February 2010 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=31–36 |doi=10.2113/gselements.6.1.31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the concentration of oxygen molecules in the atmosphere reached 1% of the present level, the chemical reactions during weathering were much like they are today. Siderite and pyrite were replaced by the iron oxides magnetite and [[hematite]]; dissolved Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions that had been carried out to sea were now deposited in extensive banded iron formations. However, this did not result in new iron minerals, just a change in their abundance. By contrast, oxidization of uraninite resulted in over 200 new species of [[uranyl]] minerals such as [[soddyite]] and [[weeksite]], as well as mineral complexes such as [[gummite]].&lt;ref name=Sverjensky/&gt;

Other elements that have multiple oxidation states include [[copper]] (which occurs in 321 oxides and silicates), boron, [[vanadium]], [[magnesium]], [[selenium]], [[tellurium]], [[arsenic]], [[antimony]], [[bismuth]], [[silver]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]].&lt;ref name=Sverjensky/&gt; In total, about 2500 new minerals formed.&lt;ref name=Fourth/&gt;

====Stage 8: Intermediate ocean====
The next roughly billion years (1.85 – 0.85 Ga) are often referred to as the "[[Boring Billion]]" because little seemed to happen. The more oxidized layer of ocean water near the surface slowly deepened at the expense of the [[anoxic waters|anoxic]] depths, but there did not seem to be any dramatic change in climate, biology or mineralogy. However, some of this perception may be due to poor preservation of rocks from that time span. Many of the world's most valuable reserves of lead, zinc and silver, are found in rocks from this time, as well as rich sources of beryllium, boron and uranium minerals.&lt;ref name=HazenBook&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hazen|first1=Robert M.|title=The story of Earth : the first 4.5 billion years, from stardust to living planet|date=2013|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=9780143123644}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|181}} This interval also saw the formation of the [[supercontinent]] [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia]], its breakup, and the formation of [[Rodinia]].&lt;ref name=HazenBook/&gt;{{rp|195}} In some quantitative studies of beryllium, boron and mercury minerals, there are no new minerals during the Great Oxidation Event, but a pulse of innovation during the assembly of Columbia. The reasons for this are not clear, although it may have had something to do with the release of mineralizing fluids during [[orogeny|mountain building]].&lt;ref name=HazenBook/&gt;{{rp|202–204}}

====Stage 9: Snowball Earth====
Between 1.0 and 0.542 Ga, the Earth experienced at least two "[[Snowball Earth]]" events in which much (possibly all) of the surface was covered by ice (making it the dominant surface mineral). Associated with the ice were [[cap carbonate]]s, thick layers of [[limestone]] or [[dolostone]], with aragonite fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shields |first1=Graham A. |title=Neoproterozoic cap carbonates: a critical appraisal of existing models and the plumeworld hypothesis |journal=Terra Nova |date=August 2005 |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=299–310 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3121.2005.00638.x|bibcode=2005TeNov..17..299S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clay minerals were also produced in abundance, and volcanoes managed to pierce through the ice and add to the stock of minerals.&lt;ref name=Fourth/&gt;

====Stage 10: Phanerozoic era and biomineralization====
[[File:Paradoxides sp.jpg|thumb|upright|Late [[Cambrian]] [[trilobite]] fossil.]]
The last stage coincides with the [[Phanerozoic era]], in which biomineralization, the creation of minerals by living organisms, became widespread.&lt;ref name=Fourth/&gt; Although some biominerals can be found in earlier records, it was during the [[Cambrian explosion]] that most of the known skeletal forms developed,&lt;ref name=Dove&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dove |first1=P. M. |title=The Rise of Skeletal Biominerals |journal=Elements |date=22 February 2010 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=37–42 |doi=10.2113/gselements.6.1.37}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the major skeletal minerals (calcite, aragonite, [[apatite]] and [[opal]]).&lt;ref name=urPaper/&gt; Most of these are carbonates, but some are phosphates or calcite. In all, over 64 mineral phases have been identified in living organisms, including metal sulfides, oxides, hydroxides and silicates;&lt;ref name=Dove/&gt; over two dozen have been found in the human body.&lt;ref name=urPaper/&gt;

Before the Phanerozoic, land was mostly barren rock, but plants began to populate it in the [[Silurian|Silurian Period]]. This led to an order-of-magnitude increase in the production of clay minerals. In the oceans, [[plankton]] transported [[calcium carbonate]] from shallow waters to the deep ocean, inhibiting the production of cap carbonates and making future snowball Earth events less likely. Microbes also became involved in the [[geochemical cycle]]s of most elements, making them [[biogeochemical cycle]]s. The mineralogical novelties included [[organic mineral]]s that have been found in carbon-rich remnants of life such as [[coal]] and black [[shale]]s.&lt;ref name=urPaper/&gt;

===Anthropocene===

Strictly speaking, purely biogenic minerals are not recognized by the [[International Mineralogical Association]] (IMA) unless geological processes are also involved. Purely biological products such as the shells of marine organisms are not accepted. Also explicitly excluded are [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] compounds.&lt;ref name=Nickel&gt;{{cite journal |last = Nickel |first = Ernest H. |title = The definition of a mineral |journal = The Canadian Mineralogist |volume = 33 |issue = 3 |pages = 689–90 |date = 1995 |url = https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/canmin/article-abstract/33/3/689/12679/the-definition-of-a-mineral?redirectedFrom=fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, humans have had such an impact on the surface of the planet that geologists are considering the introduction of a new [[epoch (geology)|geological epoch]], the [[Anthropocene]], to reflect these changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Monastersky |first1=Richard |title=Anthropocene: The human age |journal=Nature |date=11 March 2015 |volume=519 |issue=7542 |pages=144–147 |doi=10.1038/519144a|pmid=25762264 |bibcode=2015Natur.519..144M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Heaney&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heaney |first1=P.

In 2015, Zalasiewicz and co-authors proposed that the definition of minerals be extended to include human-minerals and that their production constitutes an 11th stage of mineral evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zalasiewicz |first1=Jan |last2=Kryza |first2=Ryszard |last3=Williams |first3=Mark |title=The mineral signature of the Anthropocene in its deep-time context |journal=Geological Society, London, Special Publications |date=2014 |volume=395 |issue=1 |pages=109–117 |doi=10.1144/SP395.2|bibcode=2014GSLSP.395..109Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gross&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gross |first1=Michael |title=How life shaped Earth |journal=Current Biology |date=October 2015 |volume=25 |issue=19 |pages=R847–R850 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2015.09.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Hazen and co-authors catalogued 208 minerals that are officially recognized by the IMA but are primarily or exclusively the result of human activities. Most of these have formed in association with [[mining]]. In addition, some were created when metal artefacts sank and interacted with the seafloor. A few would probably not be officially recognized today but are allowed to remain in the catalog; these include two ([[Niobium carbide|niobocarbide]] and [[tantalcarbide]]) that may have been a hoax.&lt;ref name=Anthropocene&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hazen |first1=Robert M. |last2=Grew |first2=Edward S. |last3=Origlieri |first3=Marcus J. |last4=Downs |first4=Robert T. |title=On the mineralogy of the "Anthropocene Epoch" |journal=American Mineralogist |date=1 March 2017 |volume=102 |issue=3 |pages=595–611 |doi=10.2138/am-2017-5875|bibcode=2017AmMin.102..595H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DCO208&gt;{{cite news |last1=Deep Carbon Observatory |title=Catalog of 208 human-caused minerals bolsters argument to declare 'Anthropocene Epoch' |url=https://phys.org/news/2017-03-human-caused-minerals-bolsters-argument-declare.html |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shannon&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hall |first1=Shannon |title=Found: Thousands of Man-Made Minerals--Another Argument for the Anthropocene |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/found-thousands-of-man-made-minerals-mdash-another-argument-for-the-anthropocene/ |accessdate=24 August 2018 |work=Scientific American |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Heaney/&gt;

Hazen and co-authors identified three ways that humans have had a large impact on the distribution and diversity of minerals. The first is through manufacture. A long list of synthetic crystals have mineral equivalents, including synthetic gems, ceramics, brick, cement and batteries.&lt;ref name=Shannon/&gt; Many more have no mineral equivalent; over 180,000 inorganic crystalline compounds are listed in the [[Inorganic Crystal Structure Database]].&lt;ref name=Anthropocene/&gt; For mining or building of infrastructure, humans have redistributed rocks, sediments and minerals on a scale rivalling that of glaciation, and valuable minerals have been redistributed and juxtaposed in ways that would not occur naturally.&lt;ref name=DCO208/&gt;

==Origin of life==
Over 2/3 of mineral species owe their existence to life,&lt;ref name=Fourth/&gt; but life may also owe its existence to minerals. They may have been needed as templates to bring organic molecules together; as [[catalyst]]s for chemical reactions; and as [[metabolite]]s.&lt;ref name=urPaper/&gt; Two prominent theories for the origin of life involve clays and transition metal sulfides.&lt;ref name=Dawkins&gt;{{cite book |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |year=1996 |title=The Blind Watchmaker |edition=Reissue with a new introduction |location=New York |publisher=[[W.

Minerals may also have been necessary to the survival of early life. For example, quartz is more transparent than other minerals in [[sandstone]]s. Before life developed [[pigment]]s to protect it from damaging [[ultraviolet ray]]s, a thin layer of quartz could shield it while allowing enough light through for photosynthesis. Phosphate minerals may also have been important to early life. Phosphorus is one of the essential elements in molecules such as [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), an energy carrier found in all living cells; RNA and [[DNA]]; and [[cell membrane]]s. Most of Earth's phosphorus is in the core and mantle. The most likely mechanism for making it available to life would be the creation of phosphates such as apatite through fractionation, followed by weathering to release the phosphorus. This may have required plate tectonics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parnell |first1=J. |title=Plate tectonics, surface mineralogy, and the early evolution of life |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |date=April 2004 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=131–137 |doi=10.1017/S1473550404002101|bibcode=2004IJAsB...3..131P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Schulze-Makuch |first1=Dirk |title=Phosphorus: You Can’t Have Life Without It, at Least on Earth |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/daily-planet/phosporus-you-cant-have-life-without-it-least-earth-180967243/ |accessdate=28 August 2018 |work=Air &amp; Space Magazine |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cinnabar on Dolomite.jpg|thumb|Cinnabar (red) on [[dolomite]]]]
Since the original paper on mineral evolution, there have been several studies of minerals of specific elements, including uranium, [[thorium]], mercury, carbon, beryllium, and the clay minerals. These reveal information about different processes; for example, uranium and thorium are heat producers while uranium and carbon indicate oxidation state.&lt;ref name=Bradley/&gt; The records reveal episodic bursts of new minerals such as those during the [[#Intermediate ocean|Boring Billion]], as well as long periods where no new minerals appeared. For example, after a jump in diversity during the assembly of Columbia, there were no new mercury minerals between 1.8 Ga and 600 million years ago. This remarkably long hiatus is attributed to a sulfide-rich ocean, which led to rapid deposition of the mineral [[cinnabar]].&lt;ref name=HazenBook/&gt;{{rp|204}}

Most of the mineral evolution papers have looked at the first appearance of minerals, but one can also look at the age distribution of a given mineral. Millions of zircon crystals have been dated, and the age distributions are nearly independent of where the crystals are found (e.g., igneous rocks, [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] or [[metasedimentary rock]]s or modern river sands). They have highs and lows that are linked with the supercontinent cycle, although it is not clear whether this is due to changes in subduction activity or preservation.&lt;ref name=Bradley/&gt;

Other studies have looked at time variations of mineral properties such as isotope ratios, chemical compositions, and relative abundances of minerals, although not under the rubric of "mineral evolution".&lt;ref name=Needs&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hazen |first1=R.

==History==
For most of its history, mineralogy has had no historical component. It has been concerned with classifying minerals according to their chemical and physical properties (such as the chemical formula and crystal structure) and defining conditions for stability of a mineral or group of minerals.&lt;ref name=urPaper/&gt; However, there were exceptions where publications looked at the distribution of ages of minerals or of ores. In 1960, Russell Gordon Gastil found cycles in the distribution of mineral dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gastil |first1=R. G. |title=The distribution of mineral dates in time and space |journal=American Journal of Science |date=1 January 1960 |volume=258 |issue=1 |pages=1–35 |doi=10.2475/ajs.258.1.1|bibcode=1960AmJS..258....1G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Meyer, finding that the ores of some elements are distributed over a wider time span than others, attributed the difference to the effects of tectonics and biomass on the surface chemistry, particularly free oxygen and carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meyer |first1=C. |title=Ore Metals Through Geologic History |journal=Science |date=22 March 1985 |volume=227 |issue=4693 |pages=1421–1428 |doi=10.1126/science.227.4693.1421|pmid=17777763 |bibcode=1985Sci...227.1421M }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, A. G. Zhabin introduced the concept of stages of mineral evolution in the Russian-language journal [[Doklady Akademii Nauk]] and in 1982, N. P. Yushkin noted the increasing complexity of minerals over time near the surface of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grew |first1=E. S. |last2=Hazen |first2=R.

This was followed by a series of quantitative explorations of the evolution of various mineral groups. These led in 2015 to the concept of [[mineral ecology]], the study of distributions of minerals in space and time.&lt;ref name=Krivovichev/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kwok |first1=Roberta |title=Is Mineral Evolution Driven by Chance? |url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/is-mineral-evolution-driven-by-chance-20150811/ |accessdate=11 August 2018 |work=Quanta Magazine |date=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coal mine Wyoming.jpg|thumb|right|325px|A [[coal mining|coal mine]] in [[Wyoming]], [[United States]]. [[Coal]], produced over millions of years, is a finite and non-renewable resource on a human time scale.]]

A '''non-renewable resource''' (also called a '''finite resource''') is a resource that does not renew itself at a sufficient rate for sustainable economic extraction in meaningful human time-frames. An example is carbon-based, organically-derived fuel. The original organic material, with the aid of heat and pressure, becomes a fuel such as oil or gas. [[Earth]] [[mineral]]s and [[metal]] [[ore]]s, [[fossil fuel]]s ([[coal]], [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]]) and [[groundwater]] in certain [[aquifer]]s are all considered non-renewable resources, though individual [[Chemical element|element]]s are almost always conserved.

On the other hand, resources such as [[timber]] (when [[Sustainable forest management|harvested sustainably]]) and wind (used to power energy conversion systems) are considered [[renewable resource]]s, largely because their localized replenishment can occur within time frames meaningful to humans.

== Earth minerals and metal ores ==
{{Main article|Mineral|Ore}}
{{Further information|Mining}}

[[Earth]] minerals and [[metal]] ores are examples of non-renewable resources. The metals themselves are present in vast amounts in Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]], and their extraction by humans only occurs where they are concentrated by [[Ore genesis|natural geological processes]] (such as heat, pressure, organic activity, weathering and other processes) enough to become economically viable to extract. These processes generally take from tens of thousands to millions of years, through [[plate tectonics]], [[tectonic subsidence]] and [[crustal recycling]].

The localized deposits of metal ores near the surface which can be extracted economically by humans are non-renewable in human time-frames. There are certain [[rare earth mineral]]s and [[rare earth element|elements]] that are more scarce and exhaustible than others. These are in high demand in [[manufacturing]], particularly for the [[electronics industry]].

Most metal ores are considered vastly greater in supply to fossil fuels, because metal ores are formed by crustal-scale processes which make up a much larger portion of the Earth's near-surface environment, than those that form fossil fuels which are limited to areas where carbon-based life forms flourish, die, and are quickly buried.

== Fossil fuels ==
{{Main article|Fossil fuel}}
{{Further information|Oil depletion}}

Natural resources such as [[coal]], [[petroleum]] (crude oil) and [[natural gas]] take thousands of years to form naturally and cannot be replaced as fast as they are being consumed. Eventually it is considered that fossil-based resources will become too costly to harvest and humanity will need to shift its reliance to other sources of energy such as solar or wind power, see [[renewable energy]].

An alternative hypothesis is that carbon based fuel is virtually inexhaustible in human terms, if one includes all sources of carbon-based energy such as methane hydrates on the sea floor, which are vastly greater than all other carbon based fossil fuel resources combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://worldoceanreview.com/en/wor-1/energy/methane-hydrates/ |title=Methane hydrates |website=Worldoceanreview.com |access-date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sources of carbon are also considered non-renewable, although their rate of formation/replenishment on the sea floor is not known. However their extraction at economically viable costs and rates has yet to be determined.

At present, the main energy source used by humans is non-renewable [[fossil fuels]].  Since the dawn of [[internal combustion engine]] technologies in the 19th century, petroleum and other fossil fuels have remained in continual demand.  As a result, conventional [[infrastructure]] and [[transport]] systems, which are fitted to combustion engines, remain prominent throughout the globe.  The continual use of fossil fuels at the current rate is believed to increase [[global warming]] and cause more severe [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=America's Climate Choices: Panel on Advancing the Science of Climate Change; National Research Council|title=Advancing the Science of Climate Change |year=2010|publisher=The National Academies Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-309-14588-0|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further information|Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy|Peak uranium}}

In 1987, the [[World Commission on Environment and Development]] (WCED) an organization set up by but independent from the [[United Nations]] classified fission reactors that produce more [[fissile]] nuclear fuel than they consume -i.e. [[breeder reactor]]s, and when it is developed, [[fusion power]], among conventional renewable energy sources, such as [[Sun|solar]] and [[Hydropower|falling water]].&lt;ref name="Brundtland"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 7: Energy: Choices for Environment and Development|url=http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-07.htm|work=Our Common Future: Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development|first=Gro Harlem|last=Brundtland|location=Oslo|date=20 March 1987|accessdate=27 March 2013|quote=Today's primary sources of energy are mainly non-renewable: natural gas, oil, coal, peat, and conventional nuclear power. There are also renewable sources, including wood, plants, dung, falling water, geothermal sources, solar, tidal, wind, and wave energy, as well as human and animal muscle-power. Nuclear reactors that produce their own fuel ("breeders") and eventually fusion reactors are also in this category}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Petroleum Institute]] likewise does not consider conventional nuclear fission as renewable, but that [[breeder reactor]] nuclear power fuel is considered renewable and sustainable, before explaining that radioactive waste from used [[spent fuel]] rods remains radioactive, and so has to be very carefully stored for up to a thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.api.org/classroom/curricula/nonrenew-resources.cfm|title=Key Characteristics of Nonrenewable Resources|author=American Petroleum Institute|accessdate=2010-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the careful monitoring of radioactive waste products also being required upon the use of other renewable energy sources, such as [[geothermal energy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/radiation/tenorm/geothermal.html Geothermal Energy Production Waste.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[nuclear technology]] relying on [[Nuclear fission|fission]] requires [[Naturally occurring radioactive material]] as fuel. [[Uranium]], the most common fission fuel, and is present in the ground at relatively low concentrations and [[uranium mining|mined]] in 19 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf23.html|title=World Uranium Mining|publisher=World Nuclear Association|accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mined uranium is used to fuel energy-generating nuclear reactors with [[Fissile|fissionable]] [[uranium-235]] which generates heat that is ultimately used to power [[turbine]]s to generate electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/education/uran.html|title=What is uranium? How does it work?|publisher=World Nuclear Association|accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013 only a few kilograms (picture available) of uranium have been extracted from the ocean in [[pilot program]]s and it is also believed that the uranium extracted on an industrial scale from the seawater would constantly be replenished from uranium [[leaching (metallurgy)|leached]] from the ocean floor, maintaining the seawater concentration at a stable level.&lt;ref name="gepr.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gepr.org/en/contents/20130729-01/ |title= The current state of promising research into extraction of uranium from seawater — Utilization of Japan's plentiful seas}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, with the advances made in the efficiency of seawater uranium extraction, a paper in the journal of ''Marine Science &amp; Engineering'' suggests that with, light water reactors as its target, the process would be [[economy of scale|economically competitive if implemented on a large scale]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/2/1/81 Development of a Kelp-Type Structure Module in a Coastal Ocean Model to Assess the Hydrodynamic Impact of Seawater Uranium Extraction Technology.

Nuclear power provides about 6% of the world's energy and 13–14% of the world's electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Nuclear Association]]. [http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/newsarticle.aspx?id=27665 Another drop in nuclear generation] ''World Nuclear News'', 5 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nuclear energy production is associated with potentially dangerous [[radioactive contamination]] as it relies upon unstable elements.  In particular, nuclear power facilities produce about 200,000 metric tons of [[low and intermediate level waste]] (LILW) and 10,000 metric tons of [[high level waste]] (HLW) (including spent fuel designated as waste) each year worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Factsheets/English/manradwa.html |title=Factsheets &amp; FAQs |publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) |accessdate=2012-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125062648/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Factsheets/English/manradwa.html |archivedate=25 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues entirely separate from the question of the sustainability of nuclear fuel, relate to the use of nuclear fuel and the high-level radioactive waste the nuclear industry generates that if not properly contained, is [[Acute radiation syndrome|highly hazardous]] to people and wildlife.   The United Nations ([[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation|UNSCEAR]]) estimated in 2008 that average annual human radiation exposure includes 0.01 [[millisievert]] (mSv) from the legacy of past atmospheric nuclear testing plus the [[Chernobyl disaster]] and the nuclear fuel cycle, along with 2.0 mSv from natural radioisotopes and 0.4 mSv from [[cosmic ray]]s; all exposures [[Background radiation|vary by location]].&lt;ref name = UNSCEAR&gt;United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation.

[[Natural resource]]s, known as renewable resources, are replaced by [[Natural phenomenon|natural processes and forces]] persistent in the [[natural environment]]. There are [[Intermittent energy source|intermittent]] and reoccurring renewables, and [[Recycling|recyclable material]]s, which are utilized during a [[Biogeochemical cycle|cycle]] across a certain amount of time, and can be harnessed for any number of cycles.

The production of goods and services by [[manufacturing]] [[Product (business)|product]]s in [[economic system]]s creates many [[List of waste types|types of waste]] during production and after the [[consumer]] has made use of it. The material is then either [[Incineration|incinerated]], buried in a [[landfill]] or [[recycled]] for reuse.  Recycling turns materials of value that would otherwise become waste into valuable resources again.

The natural environment, with [[soil]], [[water]], [[forest]]s, [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s are all renewable resources, as long as they are adequately [[Conservation biology|monitored, protected and conserved]]. [[Sustainable agriculture]] is the cultivation of plant and animal materials in a manner that preserves plant and animal [[ecosystem]]s over the long term. The [[overfishing]] of the oceans is one example of where an industry practice or method can threaten an ecosystem, endanger [[endangered species|species]] and possibly even determine whether or not a [[fishery]] is sustainable for use by humans. An unregulated industry practice or method can lead to a complete [[resource depletion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing In Small-Scale Marine and Inland Capture Fisharies|url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/005/Y3274E/y3274e09.htm|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization|accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ohotnikovo1.jpg|thumb|[[Okhotnykovo Solar Park]] is one of the world's [[List of photovoltaic power stations|largest photovoltaic power stations]].]] --&gt;

The renewable energy from the [[sun]], [[wind]], [[surface wave|wave]], [[biomass]] and [[Geothermal gradient|geothermal]] energies are based on renewable resources. Renewable resources such as the movement of [[water]] ([[hydropower]], [[tidal power]] and [[wave power]]), [[wind power|wind]] and [[radiant energy]] from geothermal heat (used for [[geothermal power]]) and solar energy (used for [[Solar energy|solar power]]) are practically infinite and cannot be depleted, unlike their non-renewable counterparts, which are likely to run out if not used sparingly.

The potential wave energy on coastlines can provide 1/5 of world demand. Hydroelectric power can supply 1/3 of our total energy global needs. Geothermal energy can provide 1.5 more times the energy we need. There is enough wind to power the planet 30 times over, wind power could power all of humanity's needs alone. Solar currently supplies only 0.1% of our world energy needs, but there is enough out there to power humanity's needs 4,000 times over, the entire global projected energy demand by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;R. Eisenberg and D. Nocera, "Preface: Overview of the Forum on Solar and Renewable Energy," Inorg. Chem. 44, 6799 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. V. Kamat, "Meeting the Clean Energy Demand: Nanostructure Architectures for Solar Energy Conversion," J. Phys. Chem. C 111, 2834 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy and [[Energy conservation|energy efficiency]] are no longer niche [[Economic sector|sector]]s that are promoted only by governments and environmentalists. The increasing levels of investment and that more of the capital is from conventional financial actors, both suggest that sustainable energy has become mainstream and the future of energy production, as non-renewable resources decline. This is reinforced by [[climate change]] concerns, nuclear dangers and accumulating radioactive waste, [[2000s energy crisis|high oil prices]], [[peak oil]] and increasing government support for renewable energy. These factors are [[renewable energy commercialization|commercializing renewable energy]], enlarging the market and growing demand, the adoption of new products to replace obsolete technology and the conversion of existing infrastructure to a renewable standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://energy-base.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/SEFI-Global-Trends-in-Sustainable-Energy-Investment-2007.pdf |title=Global Trends in Sustainable Energy Investment 2007: Analysis of Trends and Issues in the Financing of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency in OECD and Developing Countries (PDF), p. 3. |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic models==
In economics, a non-renewable resource is defined as [[Good (economics)|goods]], where greater consumption today implies less consumption tomorrow.&lt;ref&gt;Cremer and Salehi-Isfahani 1991:18&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Ricardo]] in his early works analysed the pricing of exhaustible resources, where he argued that the price of a mineral resource should increase over time. He argued that the spot price is always determined by the mine with the highest cost of extraction, and mine owners with lower extraction costs benefit from a differential rent. The first model is defined by [[Hotelling's rule]], which is a 1931 economic model of non-renewable [[resource management]] by [[Harold Hotelling]]. It shows that efficient exploitation of a nonrenewable and nonaugmentable resource would, under otherwise stable conditions, lead to a [[resource depletion|depletion]] of the resource. The rule states that this would lead to a net price or "[[Hotelling rent]]" for it that rose annually at a rate equal to the [[rate of interest]], reflecting the increasing scarcity of the resources.
The [[Hartwick's rule]] provides an important result about the [[sustainability]] of welfare in an economy that uses non-renewable source.

The '''Orbital Piloted Assembly and Experiment Complex''' ({{lang-ru|Орбитальный Пилотируемый Сборочно-Экспериментальный Комплекс}}, ''Orbital'nyj Pilotirujemyj Sborochno-Eksperimental'nyj Kompleks'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/opsek.html |title=Orbital Piloted Assembly and Experiment Complex, OPSEK |website=RussianSpaceWeb.com |accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8064060.stm|title=Russia 'to save its ISS modules'|date=2009-05-22|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''ОПСЭК''', '''OPSEK''') is a [[Russia]]n proposed third-generation modular [[space station]] in [[Low Earth orbit]].

The proposal would use OPSEK to assemble components of manned [[Interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary]] [[spacecraft]] destined for [[Mars]], the [[Moon]], and possibly [[Saturn]]. The returning crew would also recover on the station before landing on [[Earth]]. This OPSEK could form part of a future network of stations supporting manned exploration of the [[Solar system|Solar System]].

In early plans, the station would at first consist of modules from the [[Russian Orbital Segment]] of the [[International Space Station]] (ISS). However, in September 2017, the head of Roscosmos Igor Komarov said that the technical feasibility of separating the station to form OPSEK had been studied and there were now "no plans to separate the Russian segment from the ISS ... We keep the same position, that we should work on the ISS together with our partners."&lt;ref name="noISSmodules"&gt;{{cite web |last=Foust |first=Jeff |url=http://spacenews.com/international-partners-in-no-rush-regarding-future-of-iss/ |title=International partners in no rush regarding future of ISS |website=[[SpaceNews]] |date=25 September 2017 |accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Around the predicted decommissioning of the International Space Station in the late 2020s, the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (Roscosmos) plans to construct a successor station in low earth orbit.

Early proposals considered re-using some ISS modules to form the first parts of a new station, which would later be replaced by new modules.&lt;ref name="russianspaceweb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/opsek.html|title=Orbital Piloted Assembly and Experiment Complex|last=Zak|first=Anataloy|date=2009-07-03|publisher=Russianspaceweb.com|accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 June 2009, Roscosmos officially informed its ISS partner [[NASA]] about its intention to "build and prepare for operation the first elements of the orbital assembly and experimental piloted space complex by the end of the ISS life cycle.".&lt;ref name="russianspaceweb"/&gt; As of 2017, those plans had been abandoned, and the new station was to be composed entirely of new purpose-built modules.&lt;ref name="noISSmodules" /&gt;

According to the Russian manned spaceflight contractor [[RKK Energia]], the new station must be able to perform the following tasks:&lt;ref name="interfax0818"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.interfax.com/3/511798/news.aspx |title=Russia could build orbital assembly complex after 2020 - Energiacorporation |date=2009-08-18 |publisher=[[Interfax]] |accessdate=2009-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5j8D34fZx?url=http://www.interfax.com/3/511798/news.aspx |archivedate=August 18, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modules==
{{Update|section|date=October 2017}}
Expected [[Russian Orbital Segment]] modules around the time of OPSEK separation (2020 or later) arranged by launch dates:
* 2000, [[Zvezda (ISS module)|Zvezda]] (DOS-8) - potential part of OPSEK&lt;ref name="N2e deleted content - source duplicated from external links section"&gt;[http://www.russianspaceweb.com/opsek.html Orbital Piloted Assembly and Experiment Complex]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2009, [[Poisk (ISS module)|Poisk]] (MRM-2) - potential part of OPSEK
[[Poisk (ISS module)|Poisk]] ({{lang-ru|По́иск}}; lit. ''Search''), also known as the [[Mini-Research Module]] 2 (MRM 2), {{lang|ru|Малый исследовательский модуль 2}}, or ''МИМ 2''. Poisk is a Russian airlock module with two identical hatches. Its predecessor, [[Pirs (ISS module)|Pirs]], is used to store, service, and refurbish Russian [[Orlan space suit|Orlan]] suits. The outermost docking ports on both airlocks allow docking of Soyuz and Progress spacecraft, and the automatic transfer of propellants to and from storage on the station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/pirs.html|title=Pirs Docking Compartment|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=28 March 2009|date=10 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Iss023e047527.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Rassvet, left of center with the Russian science airlock temporarily stored on its side]]
* 2018, [[Nauka (ISS module)|Nauka]] (FGB-2) - to form part of OPSEK
[[Nauka (ISS module)|Nauka]] ({{lang-ru|Нау́ка}}; lit. Science), also known as the Multipurpose Laboratory Module (MLM) or FGB-2, ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Многофункциональный лабораторный модуль, or МЛМ), is the major Russian laboratory module. This module will be separated from the ISS before de-orbit with support modules to become the OPSEK space station. It contains an additional set of life support systems and orientation control. Nauka's mission has changed over time; during the mid-1990s it was intended as a backup for the first FGB, and later as a universal docking module (UDM). Its docking ports will be able to support automatic docking of both spacecraft, additional modules and fuel transfer. Prior to the arrival of the MLM, a Progress robotic spacecraft will dock with the ISS PIRS module, depart with that module, and both will be discarded. Nauka will then use its own engines to attach itself to the ROS after 2014.&lt;ref name=ria&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ria.ru/space/20131127/980030598.html|title=Роскосмос сообщил НАСА, что модуль МЛМ не войдет в состав МКС в 2014 г|work=РИА Новости}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Robotic Arm]], which will service the Russian Orbital Segment, will be launched alongside the MLM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ESAQEI0VMOC_iss_0.html|publisher=[[ESA]]|accessdate=4 October 2009|title=ERA: European Robotic Arm|date=16 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Russian Orbital Segment - post Nauka launch (3D rendering).jpg|300px|thumb|right|Computer generated image of the ROS after Nauka docking.]]
* 2018, [[Uzlovoy Module]] - to form part of OPSEK
[[Uzlovoy Module|Node Module]] (UM)/(NM) This 4-ton ball shaped module will support the docking of two scientific and power modules during the final stage of the station assembly and provide the Russian segment additional docking ports to receive Soyuz TMA (transportation modified anthropometric) and Progress M spacecraft. NM is to be incorporated into the ISS in 2016. It will be integrated with a special version of the Progress cargo ship and launched by a standard Soyuz rocket. The Progress would use its own propulsion and flight control system to deliver and dock the Node Module to the nadir (Earth-facing) docking port of the Nauka MLM/FGB-2 module. One port is equipped with an active hybrid docking port, which enables docking with the MLM module. The remaining five ports are passive hybrids, enabling docking of Soyuz and Progress vehicles, as well as heavier modules and future spacecraft with modified docking systems. More importantly, the node module was conceived to serve as the only permanent element of OPSEK. Equipped with six docking ports, the Node Module would serve as a single permanent core of the future station with all other modules coming and going as their life span and mission required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energia.ru/en/news/news-2011/news_01-13.html S.P.

[[Head of state|Heads of state]] throughout the world and at all periods of history may be ranked according to characteristics such as length of time holding that position; age of accession or death; or physical attributes. In this way   [[world record]]s in these characteristics may be identified, although the historical basis for such claims is frequently uncertain.

==Shortest serving==

The shortest serving monarch of all time is believed to be [[Louis XIX of France]]. After his father's abdication during the July Revolution on August 2, 1830, he ascended to the throne, but abdicated around 19 minutes later. This reign is disputed, as some historians believe this reign is too short to be valid. The next contender is the unnamed [[daughter of Emperor Xiaoming of Northern Wei]] who was appointed by her grandmother, [[Empress Dowager Hu (Northern Wei)|Empress Dowager Hu]]. She reigned for a matter of hours until being replaced by Yuan Zhou.

Mexican politician [[Pedro Lascuráin|Pedro Lascuráin]] served as the 34th President of Mexico for a short period of time ranging from 15 to 56 minutes before he quit in a coup d'état in order to make General [[Victoriano Huerta]] the next President.

==Ruling houses==

===Oldest===
Officially, the current [[Emperor of Japan]], [[Akihito]] is the 125th in line from the first emperor [[Emperor Jimmu|Jimmu]], who is variously believed to have reigned in the 1st or 7th century BC. However, the earliest documentary evidence is only for the 29th emperor, [[Emperor Kinmei|Kinmei]] (AD 509–571).

Queen [[Elizabeth II]] of the United Kingdom is well-documented as being descended from [[Arnulf of Metz]] (c. AD 582–640), forefather of [[Charlemagne]], thus representing a lineage of 47 generations. (See [[Descent of Elizabeth II from the Franks]].)

The [[Ottoman Empire]] lasted for [[Ottoman family tree|36 sultans in 21 generations]], from [[Osman I]] to [[Mehmed VI]] for 623 years. (See [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire]].)

==Post-nominal numbers==
The highest post-nominal number representing a member of a royal house is 75, used by Count Heinrich LXXV [[House of Reuss|Reuss]] (r. 1800&amp;ndash;1801). All male members of the branch were named Heinrich, and were successively numbered from 1 upwards, from the beginning of each century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last= Russell|editor1-first= Alan|editor2-last=McWhirter|editor2-first= Norris D.|date= 1 October 1987|title= The Guinness Book of Records 1988|url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TqcxAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=largest+regnal+number&amp;dq=largest+regnal+number&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAmoVChMIktSgxuzUyAIVg1wUCh15fQmm|location= Fleet St., London|publisher= Guinness Superlatives ltd|page= 190|isbn= 0851128688}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical attributes==

===Heaviest===
The heaviest monarch is believed to have been [[Taufa'ahau Tupou IV]], King of [[Tonga]] from 1965 to 2006 who at his peak in 1976 was measured as {{convert|208.7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, though he subsequently lost around 40% of his weight.&lt;ref name="GBOR96"&gt;{{cite book | last = McWhirter | first = Norris  | title = [[Guinness Book of Records]]  | publisher = Guinness Publishing | year = 1996  | pages = 181–2  | isbn = 0-85112-646-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tallest===
[[Sancho VII of Navarre]] was the tallest head of state. He was the King of [[Kingdom of Navarre]]. His remains were measured to indicate a height of at least {{convert|7|ft|3|in|cm|abbr=on}}.

===Shortest===
[[President of Mexico|President]] [[Benito Juárez]] of [[Mexico]] was reportedly the shortest world leader, standing at {{convert|4|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}.

==Age==

===Youngest===
According to legends, the youngest ruler is [[Shapur II]] who was crowned ''in utero'' when a crown was placed on the belly of [[Hormizd II]] 's wife after Hormizd II died. However, according to [[Shapur Shahbazi]], it is unlikely. Other claims as the youngest ruler include [[John I of France]] and [[Alfonso XIII of Spain]] who were both crowned on the day of their birth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18275">{{short description|A type of inertial wave in the atmospheres and oceans of planets that largely owe their properties to rotation of the planet}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}

'''Rossby waves''', also known as '''planetary waves''', are a natural phenomenon in the [[atmosphere]]s and oceans of planets that largely owe their properties to rotation of the planet. Rossby waves are a subset of [[inertial wave]]s.  They were first identified by [[Carl-Gustaf Arvid Rossby]].

'''''Atmospheric'' Rossby waves''' on Earth are giant [[meanders]] in high-[[altitude]] [[wind]]s that have a major influence on [[weather]]. These waves are associated with [[pressure systems]] and the [[jet stream]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dynamic Meteorology |page=347 |year=2004 |first=James R. |last=Holton |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=0-12-354015-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''''Oceanic'' Rossby waves''' move along the [[thermocline]]: the boundary between the warm upper layer and the cold deeper part of the ocean.

==Rossby wave types==
===Atmospheric waves===
[[File:Jetstream - Rossby Waves - N hemisphere.svg|thumb|440px|Meanders of the [[northern hemisphere]]'s [[jet stream]] developing (a, b) and finally detaching a "drop" of cold air (c). Orange: warmer masses of air; pink: jet stream; blue: colder masses of air.]]

Atmospheric Rossby waves result from the conservation of [[potential vorticity]] and are influenced by the [[Coriolis acceleration|Coriolis force]] and pressure gradient. The rotation causes fluids to turn to the right as they move in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere. For example, a fluid that moves from the equator toward the north pole will deviate toward the east; a fluid moving toward the [[equator]] from the north will deviate toward the west. These deviations are caused by the [[Coriolis force]] and conservation of potential vorticity which leads to changes of relative vorticity. This is analogous to conservation of [[angular momentum]] in mechanics. In [[planet]]ary atmospheres, including Earth, Rossby waves are due to the variation in the [[Coriolis effect]] with [[latitude]]. [[Carl-Gustaf Arvid Rossby]] first identified such waves in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] in 1939 and went on to explain their motion. 

One can identify a terrestrial Rossby wave as its [[phase velocity]], marked by its wave crest, always has a westward component.{{fact|date=October 2018}} However, the collected set of Rossby waves may appear to move in either direction with what is known as its [[group velocity]]. In general, shorter waves have an eastward group velocity and long waves a westward group velocity. 

The terms "[[barotropic]]" and "[[baroclinic]]" are used to distinguish the vertical structure of Rossby waves. Barotropic Rossby waves do not vary in the vertical, and have the fastest propagation [[speed]]s. The baroclinic wave modes, on the other hand, do vary in the vertical. They are also slower, with speeds of only a few centimeters per second or less.&lt;ref name=Shepherd2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Shepherd|first1= Theodore G.|authorlink= Ted Shepherd|title= Rossby waves and two-dimensional turbulence in a large-scale zonal jet|journal= [[Journal of Fluid Mechanics]]|volume= 183|issue= -1|year= 1987|pages= 467|doi= 10.1017/S0022112087002738|url= http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/32992/|bibcode = 1987JFM...183..467S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most investigations of Rossby waves have been done on those in Earth's atmosphere.
Rossby waves in the Earth's atmosphere are easy to observe as (usually 4-6) large-scale meanders of the [[jet stream]]. When these deviations become very pronounced, masses of cold or warm air detach, and become low-strength [[cyclone]]s and [[anticyclone]]s, respectively, and are responsible for day-to-day weather patterns at mid-latitudes. The action of Rossby waves partially explains why eastern continental edges in the Northern Hemisphere, such as the [[Northeast United States]] and [[Eastern Canada]], are colder than [[Western Europe]] at the same [[latitude]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1038/nature09924 |title= Winter cold of eastern continental boundaries induced by warm ocean waters |year= 2011 |last1= Kaspi |first1= Yohai |last2= Schneider |first2= Tapio |journal= Nature |volume= 471 |issue= 7340 |pages= 621–4 |pmid= 21455177|bibcode = 2011Natur.471..621K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poleward-propagating atmospheric waves====
Deep [[convection]] ([[heat transfer]]) to the [[troposphere]] is enhanced over very warm sea surfaces in the tropics, such as during [[El Niño]] events.  This tropical forcing generates atmospheric Rossby waves that have a poleward and eastward migration.

Poleward-propagating Rossby waves explain many of the observed statistical connections between low- and high-latitude climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1175/1520-0469(1981)038&lt;1179:TSLROA&gt;2.0.CO;2 |year= 1981 |volume= 38 |pages= 1179 |title= The Steady Linear Response of a Spherical Atmosphere to Thermal and Orographic Forcing |last1= Hoskins |first1= Brian J. |last2= Karoly |first2= David J. |journal= Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences |issue= 6|bibcode = 1981JAtS...38.1179H }}&lt;/ref&gt; One such phenomenon is [[sudden stratospheric warming]]. Poleward-propagating Rossby waves are an important and unambiguous part of the variability in the Northern Hemisphere, as expressed in the Pacific North America pattern.  Similar mechanisms apply in the Southern Hemisphere and partly explain the strong variability in the [[Amundsen Sea]] region of [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1029/2005JD006386 |title= Teleconnections between the tropical Pacific and the Amundsen-Bellinghausens Sea: Role of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation |year= 2006 |last1= Lachlan-Cope |first1= Tom |last2= Connolley |first2= William |journal= Journal of Geophysical Research |volume= 111|bibcode = 2006JGRD..11123101L }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, a ''[[Nature Geoscience]]'' study using [[general circulation model]]s linked Pacific Rossby waves generated by increasing central tropical Pacific temperatures to warming of the Amundsen Sea region, leading to winter and spring continental warming of [[Ellsworth Land]] and [[Marie Byrd Land]] in [[West Antarctica]] via an increase in [[advection]].&lt;ref&gt;

====Rossby waves on other planets====

Atmospheric Rossby waves, like Kelvin waves, can occur on any rotating planet with an atmosphere.  The Y-shaped cloud feature on Venus is attributed to Kelvin and Rossby waves.&lt;ref&gt;Curt Covey and Gerald Schubert, [http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/citedby/10.1175/1520-0469%281982%29039%3C2397%3APSWITV%3E2.0.CO%3B2 "Planetary-Scale Waves in the Venus Atmosphere"], ''Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences,'' American Meteorological Society, Vol 39, No. 11, 1982. DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0469(1982)039&lt;2397:PSWITV&gt;2.0.CO;2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oceanic waves===
Oceanic Rossby waves are large-scale waves within an ocean basin. They have a low amplitude, on the order of centimetres (at the surface) to metres (at the thermocline), compared to a very long wavelength, on the order of hundreds of kilometres of atmospheric Rossby waves. {{Clarify|(Why) is this a comparison of the amplitude of oceanic and the wavelength of tmospheric Rossby waves? What do we learn from this? Or is comparison of wavelengths or amplitudes meant?|date=February 2018}} They may take months to cross an ocean basin. They gain [[momentum]] from [[wind stress]] at the ocean surface layer and are thought to communicate climatic changes due to variability in [[harmonic oscillator|forcing]], due to both the [[wind]] and [[buoyancy]]. Both barotropic and baroclinic waves cause variations of the sea surface height, although the length of the waves made them difficult to detect until the advent of [[satellite]] [[altimetry]]. [[Satellite]] observations have confirmed the existence of oceanic Rossby waves.&lt;ref name="Chelton1996"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.272.5259.234 |title=Global Observations of Oceanic Rossby Waves |year=1996 |last1=Chelton |first1=D.

Baroclinic waves also generate significant displacements of the oceanic [[thermocline]], often of tens of meters. Satellite observations have revealed the stately progression of Rossby waves across all the [[ocean basin]]s, particularly at low- and mid-latitudes. These waves can take months or even years to cross a basin like the [[Pacific]].

Rossby waves have been suggested as an important mechanism to account for the heating of [[Europa (moon)#Subsurface ocean|the ocean on Europa]], a moon of [[Jupiter]].&lt;ref name="Tyler2008"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature07571 |title=Strong ocean tidal flow and heating on moons of the outer planets |year=2008 |last1=Tyler |first1=Robert H. |journal=Nature |volume=456 |issue=7223 |pages=770–2 |pmid=19079055|bibcode = 2008Natur.456..770T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waves in astrophysical discs===
[[Rossby wave instability in astrophysical discs|Rossby wave instabilities]] are also thought to be found in astrophysical [[Accretion disc|discs]], for example, around newly forming stars.&lt;ref&gt;Lovelace, R.V.E., Li, H., Colgate, S.A., \&amp; Nelson, A.F. 1999, "Rossby Wave Instability of Keplerian Accretion Disks", ApJ, 513, 805-810,https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9809321&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li, H., Finn, J.M., Lovelace, R.V.E., \&amp;

== Amplification of Rossby waves ==
{{Anchor|Planetary wave resonance|Planetary wave quasiresonance|Quasiresonant amplification}}
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}
It has been proposed that a number of regional weather extremes in the Northern Hemisphere associated with blocked atmospheric circulation patterns
may have been caused by '''quasiresonant amplification of Rossby waves'''. Examples include the [[2013 European floods]], the [[2012 China floods]], the [[2010 Russian heat wave]], the [[2010 Pakistan floods]] and the [[2003 European heat wave]]. Even taking [[global warming]] into account, the 2003 heat wave would have been highly unlikely without such a mechanism.

Normally freely travelling [[synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic]]-scale Rossby waves and [[quasistationary]] planetary-scale Rossby waves exist in the [[mid-latitudes]] with only weak interactions. The hypothesis, proposed by [[Vladimir Petoukhov]], [[Stefan Rahmstorf]], [[Stefan Petri]], and [[Hans Joachim Schellnhuber]], is that under some circumstances these waves interact to produce the static pattern. For this to happen, they suggest, the [[zonal (Earth sciences)|zonal]] (east-west) [[wave number]] of both types of wave should be in the range 6–8, the synoptic waves should be arrested within the [[troposphere]] (so that energy does not escape to the [[stratosphere]]) and mid-latitude [[waveguides]] should trap the quasistationary components of the synoptic waves. In this case the planetary-scale waves may respond unusually strongly to [[orography]] and thermal sources and sinks because of "quasiresonance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A 2017 study by [[Michael E. Mann|Mann]], Rahmstorf, et al. connected the phenomenon of manmade [[Arctic amplification]] to planetary wave resonance and extreme weather events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mann|first=Michael E.|last2=Rahmstorf|first2=Stefan|date=27 March 2017|title=Influence of Anthropogenic Climate Change on Planetary Wave Resonance and Extreme Weather Events|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep45242|journal=Scientific Reports |volume=7 |issue= |publisher=Springer Nature |pages= |doi=10.1038/srep45242 |access-date=9 April 2017|bibcode=2017NatSR...745242M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical definitions==
===Free barotropic Rossby waves under a zonal flow with linearized vorticity equation===

To start with, a zonal mean flow, ''U'', can be considered to be perturbed where ''U'' is constant in time and space. Let &lt;math&gt;\vec{u} = \langle u, v\rangle&lt;/math&gt; be the total horizontal wind field, where ''u'' and ''v'' are the components of the wind in the ''x''- and ''y''- directions, respectively.  The total wind field can be written as a mean flow, ''U'', with a small superimposed perturbation, ''u&amp;prime;'' and ''v&amp;prime;''.

:&lt;math&gt; u = U + u'(t,x,y)\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; v = v'(t,x,y)\!&lt;/math&gt;

The perturbation is assumed to be much smaller than the mean zonal flow.

:&lt;math&gt; U \gg u',v'\!&lt;/math&gt;

Relative vorticity ''&amp;eta;'', ''u''' and ''v''' can be written in terms of the [[stream function]] &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; (assuming non-divergent flow, for which the stream function completely describes the flow):

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
u' &amp; =  \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y} \\[5pt]
v' &amp; =  -\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} \\[5pt]
\eta &amp; = \nabla \times (u' \mathbf{\hat{\boldsymbol{\imath}}}  + v' \mathbf{\hat{\boldsymbol{\jmath}}}) = -\nabla^2 \psi
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Considering a parcel of air that has no relative vorticity before perturbation (uniform ''U'' has no vorticity) but with planetary vorticity ''f'' as a function of the latitude, perturbation will lead to a slight change of latitude, so the perturbed relative vorticity must change in order to conserve [[potential vorticity]]. Also the above approximation ''U'' &gt;&gt; ''u''' ensures that the perturbation flow does not advect relative vorticity.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d (\eta + f) }{dt} = 0 = \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + U \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} + \beta v'&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} &lt;/math&gt;.  Plug in the definition of stream function to obtain:

:&lt;math&gt; 0 = \frac{\partial \nabla^2 \psi}{\partial t} + U \frac{\partial \nabla^2 \psi}{\partial x} + \beta \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[method of undetermined coefficients]] one can consider a traveling wave solution with [[zonal and meridional]] [[wavenumbers]] ''k'' and ''ℓ'', respectively, and frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\psi = \psi_0 e^{i(kx+\ell y-\omega t)}\!&lt;/math&gt;

This yields the [[dispersion relation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \omega = Uk - \beta \frac k {k^2+\ell^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The zonal (''x''-direction) [[phase speed]] and [[group velocity]] of the Rossby wave are then given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
c &amp; \equiv \frac \omega k = U - \frac \beta {k^2+\ell^2}, \\[5pt]
c_g &amp; \equiv \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial k}\ = U - \frac{\beta (\ell^2-k^2)}{(k^2+\ell^2)^2},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is the phase speed, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; is the group speed, ''U'' is the mean westerly flow, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Rossby parameter]], ''k'' is the [[Zonal and meridional|zonal]] wavenumber, and ''ℓ'' is the [[Zonal and meridional|meridional]] wavenumber. It is noted that the zonal phase speed of Rossby waves is always westward (traveling east to west) relative to mean flow ''U'', but the zonal group speed of Rossby waves can be eastward or westward depending on wavenumber.

===Meaning of beta===
The [[Rossby parameter]] is defined:

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \frac 1 a \frac d {d\varphi}  (2 \omega \sin\varphi) = \frac{2\omega \cos\varphi} a&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is the latitude, ''ω'' is the [[angular speed]] of the [[Earth's rotation]], and ''a'' is the mean [[radius of the Earth]].

If &lt;math&gt;\beta = 0&lt;/math&gt;, there will be no Rossby Waves; Rossby Waves owe their origin to the gradient of the tangential speed of the planetary rotation (planetary vorticity). A "cylinder" planet has no Rossby Waves. It also means that at the equator of any rotating, sphere-like planet, including Earth, one will still have Rossby Waves, despite the fact that &lt;math&gt;f = 0&lt;/math&gt;, because &lt;math&gt;\beta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. ([[Equatorial Rossby wave]]).

[[File:Neapolitan Sunset.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The source of Earth's solar power: the [[Sun]]]]
{{Renewable energy sources}}
{{Sustainable energy}}
'''Solar energy''' is radiant light and heat from the [[Sun]] that is harnessed using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as [[solar heating]], [[photovoltaics]], [[solar thermal energy]], [[solar architecture]], molten salt power plants and [[artificial photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name=ie11/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/ScienceAndTechnology/Policy/Documents/solar-fuels.asp|title=Energy|work=rsc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is an important source of [[renewable energy]] and its technologies are broadly characterized as either [[passive solar]] or [[active solar]] depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy or convert it into [[solar power]]. Active solar techniques include the use of [[photovoltaic system]]s, [[concentrated solar power]] and [[solar water heating]] to harness the energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable [[thermal mass]] or light-dispersing properties, and designing spaces that [[Ventilation (architecture)|naturally circulate air]].

The large magnitude of solar energy available makes it a highly appealing source of electricity. The [[United Nations Development Programme]] in its 2000 World Energy Assessment found that the annual potential of solar energy was 1,575–49,837 [[Joule#Multiples|exajoules]] (EJ). This is several times larger than the total [[world energy consumption]], which was 559.8&amp;nbsp;EJ in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2014.pdf |title=2014 Key World Energy Statistics |publisher=IEA |website=iea.org |pages=6, 24, 28 |format=PDF |date=2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6YIEFsQ6b?url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2014.pdf |archivedate=5 May 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="World Energy Assessment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/dam/aplaws/publication/en/publications/environment-energy/www-ee-library/sustainable-energy/world-energy-assessment-energy-and-the-challenge-of-sustainability/World%20Energy%20Assessment-2000.pdf|title=Energy and the challenge of sustainability|work=United Nations Development Programme and [[World Energy Council]]|date=September 2000|format=PDF|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[International Energy Agency]] said that "the development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance [[sustainability]], reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating [[global warming]], and keep [[fossil fuel]] prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared".&lt;ref name=ie11&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/solar2011SUM.pdf |title=Solar Energy Perspectives: Executive Summary |year=2011 |format=PDF |publisher=International Energy Agency |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63fIHKr1S?url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/solar2011SUM.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar radiation is absorbed by the Earth's land surface, oceans – which cover about 71% of the globe – and atmosphere. Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing [[atmospheric circulation]] or [[convection]]. When the air reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth's surface, completing the [[water cycle]]. The [[latent heat]] of water condensation amplifies convection, producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind, [[cyclone]]s and [[anti-cyclone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radiation Budget|date=17 October 2006|publisher=NASA Langley Research Center|url=http://marine.rutgers.edu/mrs/education/class/yuri/erb.html|accessdate=29 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Somerville, Richard|title=Historical Overview of Climate Change Science|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter1.pdf|publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|accessdate=29 September 2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; By [[photosynthesis]], green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy, which produces food, wood and the [[biomass]] from which fossil fuels are derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vermass, Wim|title=An Introduction to Photosynthesis and Its Applications|publisher=Arizona State University|url=http://photoscience.la.asu.edu/photosyn/education/photointro.html|accessdate=29 September 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981203020943/http://photoscience.la.asu.edu/photosyn/education/photointro.html|archivedate=3 December 1998|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential solar energy that could be used by humans differs from the amount of solar energy present near the surface of the planet because factors such as geography, time variation, cloud cover, and the land available to humans limit the amount of solar energy that we can acquire.

Geography affects solar energy potential because areas that are closer to the [[equator]] have a greater amount of solar radiation. However, the use of [[photovoltaics]] that can follow the position of the sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator.&lt;ref name="World Energy Assessment"/&gt; Time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation on the surface of the Earth for [[solar panels]] to absorb. This limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day. [[Cloud cover]] can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the sun and reduce the light available for solar cells.

In addition, land availability has a large effect on the available solar energy because solar panels can only be set up on land that is otherwise unused and suitable for solar panels. Roofs have been found to be a suitable place for solar cells, as many people have discovered that they can collect energy directly from their homes this way. Other areas that are suitable for solar cells are lands that are not being used for businesses where solar plants can be established.&lt;ref name="World Energy Assessment"/&gt;

Solar technologies are characterized as either passive or active depending on the way they capture, convert and distribute sunlight and enable solar energy to be harnessed at different levels around the world, mostly depending on distance from the equator. Although solar energy refers primarily to the use of solar radiation for practical ends, all renewable energies, other than [[Geothermal power]] and [[Tidal power]], derive their energy either directly or indirectly from the Sun.

Active solar techniques use photovoltaics, [[concentrated solar power]], [[solar thermal collector]]s, pumps, and fans to convert sunlight into useful outputs. Passive solar techniques include selecting materials with favorable thermal properties, designing spaces that naturally circulate air, and referencing the position of a building to the Sun. Active solar technologies increase the supply of energy and are considered [[supply side]] technologies, while passive solar technologies reduce the need for alternate resources and are generally considered demand side technologies.&lt;ref name="IEA Solar Thermal"/&gt;

In 2000, the [[United Nations Development Programme]], UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, and [[World Energy Council]] published an estimate of the potential solar energy that could be used by humans each year that took into account factors such as insolation, cloud cover, and the land that is usable by humans. The estimate found that solar energy has a global potential of 1,575–49,837&amp;nbsp;EJ per year ''(see table below)''.&lt;ref name="World Energy Assessment"/&gt;

===Early commercial adaptation===
In 1878, at the Universal Exposition in Paris, [[Augustin Mouchot]] successfully demonstrated a solar steam engine, but couldn't continue development because of cheap coal and other factors. 
[[File:US Patent 1240890.pdf|thumb|upright=0.80|1917 Patent drawing of Shuman's solar collector]]
In 1897, [[Frank Shuman]], a U.S. inventor, engineer and solar energy pioneer, built a small demonstration solar engine that worked by reflecting solar energy onto square boxes filled with ether, which has a lower boiling point than water, and were fitted internally with black pipes which in turn powered a steam engine. In 1908 Shuman formed the Sun Power Company with the intent of building larger solar power plants. He, along with his technical advisor A.S.E. Ackermann and British physicist Sir [[C. V. Boys|Charles Vernon Boys]],{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes, increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether. Shuman then constructed a full-scale steam engine powered by low-pressure water, enabling him to patent the entire solar engine system by 1912.

Shuman built the world's first [[Solar thermal energy|solar thermal power station]] in [[Maadi]], [[Egypt]], between 1912 and 1913. His plant used [[parabolic trough]]s to power a {{convert|45|–|52|kW|hp|lk=out}} engine that pumped more than {{convert|22000|litres}} of water per minute from the [[Nile River]] to adjacent cotton fields. Although the outbreak of World War I and the discovery of [[Petroleum industry|cheap oil]] in the 1930s discouraged the advancement of solar energy, Shuman's vision and basic design were resurrected in the 1970s with a new wave of interest in solar thermal energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Zachary Alden|author2=Taylor, Katrina D.|title=Renewable And Alternative Energy Resources: A Reference Handbook|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|date=2008|page=174|isbn=978-1-59884-089-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916 Shuman was quoted in the media advocating solar energy's utilization, saying:

===Water heating===
{{Main|Solar hot water|Solar combisystem}}
[[File:Twice Cropped Zonnecollectoren.JPG|thumb|upright|Solar water heaters facing the [[Sun]] to maximize gain]]
Solar hot water systems use sunlight to heat water. In low geographical latitudes (below 40&amp;nbsp;degrees) from 60 to 70% of the domestic hot water use with temperatures up to 60&amp;nbsp;°C can be provided by solar heating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Renewables for Heating and Cooling|publisher=International Energy Agency|url=http://www.iea.org/textbase/npsum/Renewables_Heating_Cooling07SUM.pdf|accessdate=13 August 2015|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common types of solar water heaters are evacuated tube collectors (44%) and glazed flat plate collectors (34%) generally used for domestic hot water; and unglazed plastic collectors (21%) used mainly to heat swimming pools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Heat Worldwide (Markets and Contributions to the Energy Supply 2005)|publisher=International Energy Agency|author=Weiss, Werner|author2=Bergmann, Irene|author3=Faninger, Gerhard|url=http://www.iea-shc.org/data/sites/1/publications/Solar_Heat_Worldwide-2007.pdf|accessdate=30 May 2008|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heating, cooling and ventilation===
{{Main|Solar heating|Thermal mass|Solar chimney|Solar air conditioning}}
In the United States, [[HVAC|heating, ventilation and air conditioning]] (HVAC) systems account for 30% (4.65&amp;nbsp;EJ/yr)&lt;!--converted from 30% of 14.7 quads: 1.055 EJ/quad x 14.7 quad x 30%--&gt; of the energy used in commercial buildings and nearly 50% (10.1&amp;nbsp;EJ/yr)&lt;!--source quotes residential HVAC energy usage of 10.1 EJ and total energy use of 20.3 EJ--&gt; of the energy used in residential buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Apte, J.|display-authors=etal|title=Future Advanced Windows for Zero-Energy Homes|publisher=American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers|url=http://windows.lbl.gov/adv_Sys/ASHRAE%20Final%20Dynamic%20Windows.pdf|accessdate=9 April 2008|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410212544/http://windows.lbl.gov/adv_Sys/ASHRAE%20Final%20Dynamic%20Windows.pdf|archivedate=10 April 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Consumption Characteristics of Commercial Building HVAC Systems Volume III: Energy Savings Potential|publisher=United States Department of Energy|url=http://www.doas-radiant.psu.edu/DOE_report.pdf|accessdate=24 June 2008|pages=2–2|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solar heating, cooling and ventilation technologies can be used to offset a portion of this energy.

[[File:Flipped MIT Solar One house.png|thumb|left|[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s Solar House #1, built in 1939 in the U.S., used [[seasonal thermal energy storage]] for year-round heating.]]
Thermal mass is any material that can be used to store heat—heat from the Sun in the case of solar energy. Common thermal mass materials include stone, cement and water. Historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night. However, they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well. The size and placement of thermal mass depend on several factors such as climate, daylighting and shading conditions. When properly incorporated, thermal mass maintains space temperatures in a comfortable range and reduces the need for auxiliary heating and cooling equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Mazria (1979), pp. 29–35&lt;/ref&gt;

A solar chimney (or thermal chimney, in this context) is a passive solar ventilation system composed of a vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building. As the chimney warms, the air inside is heated causing an [[updraft]] that pulls air through the building. Performance can be improved by using glazing and thermal mass materials&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bright|first=David|date=18 February 1977|title=Passive solar heating simpler for the average owner|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=beAzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UDgHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1418,1115815&amp;dq=improved+by+using+glazing+and+thermal+mass&amp;hl=en|publisher=Bangor Daily News|accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a way that mimics greenhouses.

[[Deciduous]] trees and plants have been promoted as a means of controlling solar heating and cooling. When planted on the southern side of a building in the northern hemisphere or the northern side in the southern hemisphere, their leaves provide shade during the summer, while the bare limbs allow light to pass during the winter.&lt;ref&gt;Mazria (1979), p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; Since bare, leafless trees shade 1/3 to 1/2 of incident solar radiation, there is a balance between the benefits of summer shading and the corresponding loss of winter heating.&lt;ref&gt;Balcomb (1992), p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; In climates with significant heating loads, deciduous trees should not be planted on the Equator-facing side of a building because they will interfere with winter solar availability. They can, however, be used on the east and west sides to provide a degree of summer shading without appreciably affecting winter [[solar gain]].&lt;ref&gt;Balcomb (1992), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cooking===
{{Main|Solar cooker}}
[[File:Auroville Solar Bowl.JPG|thumb|Parabolic dish produces steam for cooking, in [[Auroville]], India]]
Solar cookers use sunlight for cooking, drying and [[pasteurization]]. They can be grouped into three broad categories: box cookers, panel cookers and reflector cookers.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson and Palkovic (1994), p. xi&lt;/ref&gt; The simplest solar cooker is the box cooker first built by [[Horace de Saussure]] in 1767.&lt;ref&gt;Butti and Perlin (1981), pp. 54–59&lt;/ref&gt; A basic box cooker consists of an insulated container with a transparent lid. It can be used effectively with partially overcast skies and will typically reach temperatures of {{convert|90-150|C}}.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson and Palkovic (1994), p. xii&lt;/ref&gt; Panel cookers use a reflective panel to direct sunlight onto an insulated container and reach temperatures comparable to box cookers. Reflector cookers use various concentrating geometries (dish, trough, Fresnel mirrors) to focus light on a cooking container. These cookers reach temperatures of {{convert|315|C}} and above but require direct light to function properly and must be repositioned to track the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson and Palkovic (1994), p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process heat===
{{Main|Solar pond|Salt evaporation pond|Solar furnace}}
Solar concentrating technologies such as parabolic dish, trough and Scheffler reflectors can provide process heat for commercial and industrial applications. The first commercial system was the [[Solar Total Energy Project]] (STEP) in Shenandoah, Georgia, USA where a field of 114 parabolic dishes provided 50% of the process heating, air conditioning and electrical requirements for a clothing factory. This grid-connected cogeneration system provided 400&amp;nbsp;kW of electricity plus thermal energy in the form of 401&amp;nbsp;kW steam and 468&amp;nbsp;kW chilled water, and had a one-hour peak load thermal storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shenandoah Solar Total Energy Project|author1=Stine, W.

W. |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=John Wiley|url=http://www.powerfromthesun.net/Book/chapter16/chapter16.html|accessdate=20 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evaporation ponds are shallow pools that concentrate dissolved solids through [[evaporation]]. The use of evaporation ponds to obtain salt from seawater is one of the oldest applications of solar energy. Modern uses include concentrating brine solutions used in leach mining and removing dissolved solids from waste streams.&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett (1998), pp. 393–4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clothes line]]s, [[clotheshorse]]s, and clothes racks dry clothes through evaporation by wind and sunlight without consuming electricity or gas. In some states of the United States legislation protects the "right to dry" clothes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Right to Dry Legislation in New England and Other States|publisher=Connecticut General Assembly|author=Thomson-Philbrook, Julia|url=http://www.cga.ct.gov/2008/rpt/2008-R-0042.htm|accessdate=27 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unglazed transpired collectors (UTC) are perforated sun-facing walls used for preheating ventilation air.

===Water treatment===
{{Main|Solar still|Solar water disinfection|Solar desalination|Solar Powered Desalination Unit}}
[[File:Indonesia-sodis-gross.jpg|thumb|[[Solar water disinfection]] in Indonesia]]
Solar distillation can be used to make [[saline water|saline]] or [[brackish water]] potable. The first recorded instance of this was by 16th-century Arab alchemists.&lt;ref name="Tiwari 2003"&gt;Tiwari (2003), pp. 368–371&lt;/ref&gt; A large-scale solar distillation project was first constructed in 1872 in the [[Chile]]an mining town of Las Salinas.&lt;ref name="Daniels 1964"&gt;Daniels (1964), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The plant, which had solar collection area of {{convert|4700|m2|abbr=on}}, could produce up to {{convert|22700|L|abbr=on}} per day and operate for 40&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name="Daniels 1964"/&gt; Individual [[still]] designs include single-slope, double-slope (or greenhouse type), vertical, conical, inverted absorber, multi-wick, and multiple effect. These stills can operate in passive, active, or hybrid modes. Double-slope stills are the most economical for decentralized domestic purposes, while active multiple effect units are more suitable for large-scale applications.&lt;ref name="Tiwari 2003"/&gt;

Solar water [[disinfection]] (SODIS) involves exposing water-filled plastic [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET) bottles to sunlight for several hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SODIS solar water disinfection|publisher=EAWAG (The Swiss Federal Institute for Environmental Science and Technology)|url=http://www.sodis.ch/index_EN|accessdate=2 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure times vary depending on weather and climate from a minimum of six hours to two days during fully overcast conditions.&lt;ref name="SODIS CDC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Household Water Treatment Options in Developing Countries: Solar Disinfection (SODIS) |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |url=http://www.ehproject.org/PDF/ehkm/cdc-options_sodis.pdf |accessdate=13 May 2008 |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529090729/http://www.ehproject.org/PDF/ehkm/cdc-options_sodis.pdf |archivedate=29 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is recommended by the [[World Health Organization]] as a viable method for household water treatment and safe storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Household Water Treatment and Safe Storage|publisher=World Health Organization|url=http://www.who.int/household_water/en/|accessdate=2 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over two million people in developing countries use this method for their daily drinking water.&lt;ref name="SODIS CDC"/&gt;

Solar energy may be used in a water stabilization pond to treat [[waste water]] without chemicals or electricity. A further environmental advantage is that [[algae]] grow in such ponds and consume [[carbon dioxide]] in photosynthesis, although algae may produce toxic chemicals that make the water unusable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Shilton A.

===Molten salt technology===

Molten salt can be employed as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy collected by a [[Solar power tower|solar tower]] or [[solar trough]] of a [[concentrated solar power plant]], so that it can be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night. It was demonstrated in the [[Solar Two]] project from 1995–1999. The system is predicted to have an annual efficiency of 99%, a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity, versus converting heat directly into electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandia.gov/Renewable_Energy/solarthermal/NSTTF/salt.htm |title=Advantages of Using Molten Salt |accessdate=2011-07-14 |last=Mancini |first=Tom |date=10 January 2006 |publisher=Sandia National Laboratories |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60AE7heEZ?url=http://www.sandia.gov/Renewable_Energy/solarthermal/NSTTF/salt.htm |archivedate=14 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1977htec.proc...39J Molten salt energy storage system – A feasibility study] Jones, B.

The most extended mixture contains [[sodium nitrate]], [[potassium nitrate]] and [[calcium nitrate]]. It is non-flammable and nontoxic, and has already been used in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid, so experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications.

The salt melts at {{convert|131|°C|°F}}. It is kept liquid at {{convert|288|°C|°F}} in an insulated "cold" storage tank. The liquid salt is pumped through panels in a solar collector where the focused sun heats it  to {{convert|566|°C|°F}}. It is then sent to a hot storage tank. This is so well insulated that the thermal energy can be usefully stored for up to a week.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, Robert, 2013, ''Renewable Energy: A First Course'', CRC Press, Chap. 13.1.22 ''Thermal storage'' p. 375 {{ISBN|978-1439861158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When electricity is needed, the hot salt is pumped to a conventional steam-generator to produce [[superheated steam]] for a turbine/generator as used in any conventional coal, oil, or nuclear power plant. A 100-megawatt turbine would need a tank about {{convert|9.1|m|ft}} tall and {{convert|24|m|ft}} in diameter to drive it for four hours by this design.

Solar power is the conversion of sunlight into [[electricity]], either directly using [[photovoltaics]] (PV), or indirectly using [[concentrated solar power]] (CSP). CSP systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. PV converts light into electric current using the [[photoelectric effect]].

Solar power is anticipated to become the world's largest source of electricity by 2050, with solar photovoltaics and concentrated solar power contributing 16 and 11 percent to the global overall consumption, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=International Energy Agency |website=iea.org |title=Technology Roadmap: Solar Photovoltaic Energy |url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/TechnologyRoadmapSolarPhotovoltaicEnergy_2014edition.pdf |publisher=IEA |accessdate=7 October 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6T92GIRhW?url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/TechnologyRoadmapSolarPhotovoltaicEnergy_2014edition.pdf |archivedate=7 October 2014 |format=PDF |date=2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, after another year of rapid growth, solar generated 1.3% of global power.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/renewable-energy/solar-energy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s. The 392 MW [[Ivanpah Solar Power Facility]], in the Mojave Desert of California, is the largest solar power plant in the world. Other large concentrated solar power plants include the 150 MW [[Solnova Solar Power Station]] and the 100 MW [[Andasol solar power station]], both in Spain. The 250 MW&lt;!--AC, approximately 250/.83=300 MW DC--&gt; [[Agua Caliente Solar Project]], in the United States, and the 221 MW&lt;!--DC--&gt; [[Gujarat Solar Park|Charanka Solar Park]] in India, are the [[List of photovoltaic power stations|world's largest]] [[photovoltaic plant]]s. Solar projects exceeding 1 GW are being developed, but most of the deployed photovoltaics are in small rooftop arrays of less than 5&amp;nbsp;kW, which are connected to the grid using net metering and/or a feed-in tariff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energytoolbox.org/gcre/mod_5/gcre_solar.pdf|format=PDF|title=Grid Connected Renewable Energy: Solar Electric Technologies|publisher=energytoolbox.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
In the last two decades, [[photovoltaics]] (PV), also known as solar PV, has evolved from a pure niche market of small scale applications towards becoming a mainstream electricity source. A [[solar cell]] is a device that converts light directly into electricity using the photoelectric effect. The first solar cell was constructed by [[Charles Fritts]] in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Perlin (1999), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 a German engineer, Dr Bruno Lange, developed a photo cell using [[silver selenide]] in place of [[copper oxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9CcDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1931+plane#v=onepage&amp;q=Popular%20Science%201931%20plane&amp;f=true|title="Magic Plates, Tap Sun For Power", June 1931, Popular Science|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the prototype [[selenium]] cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity, both [[Ernst Werner von Siemens]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]] recognized the importance of this discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Perlin (1999), pp. 18–20&lt;/ref&gt; Following the work of [[Russell Ohl]] in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, [[Calvin Fuller]] and Daryl Chapin created the [[crystalline silicon]] solar cell in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Perlin (1999), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; These early solar cells cost 286&amp;nbsp;USD/watt and reached efficiencies of 4.5–6%.&lt;ref&gt;Perlin (1999), pp. 29–30, 38&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012 available efficiencies exceeded 20%, and the maximum efficiency of research photovoltaics was in excess of 40%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jap.aip.org/resource/1/japiau/v110/i3/p031301_s1?isAuthorized=no|title=Will we exceed 50% efficiency in photovoltaics?|author=Antonio Luque|work=aip.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515051251/http://jap.aip.org/resource/1/japiau/v110/i3/p031301_s1?isAuthorized=no|archivedate=2016-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concentrated solar power===
{{See also|Concentrated solar power}}
Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. The concentrated heat is then used as a heat source for a conventional power plant. A wide range of concentrating technologies exists; the most developed are the parabolic trough, the concentrating linear fresnel reflector, the Stirling dish and the solar power tower. Various techniques are used to track the Sun and focus light. In all of these systems a [[working fluid]] is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Goswami (2005), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture and urban planning==
{{Main|Passive solar building design|Urban heat island}}
[[File:Technische Universität Darmstadt - Solar Decathlon 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Darmstadt University of Technology]], Germany, won the 2007 [[Solar Decathlon]] in Washington, D.C. with this [[passive house]] designed for humid and hot subtropical climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Darmstadt University of Technology solar decathlon home design |publisher=Darmstadt University of Technology |url=http://www.solardecathlon.de/index.php/our-house/the-design |accessdate=25 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018035727/http://www.solardecathlon.de/index.php/our-house/the-design |archivedate=18 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Sunlight has influenced building design since the beginning of architectural history.&lt;ref name="Schittich 2003"&gt;Schittich (2003), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Advanced solar architecture and urban planning methods were first employed by the [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Feng shui#Archaeology|Chinese]], who oriented their buildings toward the south to provide light and warmth.&lt;ref&gt;Butti and Perlin (1981), pp. 4, 159&lt;/ref&gt;

The common features of [[passive solar]] architecture are orientation relative to the Sun, compact proportion (a low surface area to volume ratio), selective shading (overhangs) and [[Thermal mass (Building)|thermal mass]].&lt;ref name="Schittich 2003"/&gt; When these features are tailored to the local climate and environment they can produce well-lit spaces that stay in a comfortable temperature range. [[Socrates]]' Megaron House is a classic example of passive solar design.&lt;ref name="Schittich 2003"/&gt; The most recent approaches to solar design use computer modeling tying together [[daylighting|solar lighting]], [[solar heating|heating]] and [[solar air conditioning|ventilation]] systems in an integrated [[solar design]] package.&lt;ref&gt;Balcomb (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Active solar]] equipment such as pumps, fans and switchable windows can complement passive design and improve system performance.

Urban heat islands (UHI) are metropolitan areas with higher temperatures than that of the surrounding environment. The higher temperatures result from increased absorption of solar energy by urban materials such as asphalt and concrete, which have lower [[albedo]]s and higher [[heat capacity|heat capacities]] than those in the natural environment. A straightforward method of counteracting the UHI effect is to paint buildings and roads white, and to plant trees in the area. Using these methods, a hypothetical "cool communities" program in Los Angeles has projected that urban temperatures could be reduced by approximately 3&amp;nbsp;°C at an estimated cost of US$1&amp;nbsp;billion, giving estimated total annual benefits of US$530&amp;nbsp;million from reduced air-conditioning costs and healthcare savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rosenfeld, Arthur |author2=et. al. |title=Painting the Town White – and Green |publisher=Heat Island Group |url=http://eetd.lbl.gov/HeatIsland/PUBS/PAINTING/ |accessdate=29 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714173907/http://eetd.lbl.gov/HeatIsland/PUBS/PAINTING/ |archivedate=14 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agriculture and horticulture==
[[File:Westland kassen.jpg|thumb|[[Greenhouses]] like these in the Westland municipality of the Netherlands grow vegetables, fruits and flowers.]]
[[Agriculture]] and [[horticulture]] seek to optimize the capture of solar energy in order to optimize the productivity of plants. Techniques such as timed planting cycles, tailored row orientation, staggered heights between rows and the mixing of plant varieties can improve crop yields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Row Spacing, Plant Population, and Yield Relationships|author=Jeffrey C. Silvertooth|publisher=University of Arizona|url=http://ag.arizona.edu/crop/cotton/comments/april1999cc.html|accessdate=24 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaul (2005), pp. 169–174&lt;/ref&gt; While sunlight is generally considered a plentiful resource, the exceptions highlight the importance of solar energy to agriculture. During the short growing seasons of the [[Little Ice Age]], French and [[Solar power in the United Kingdom|English]] farmers employed fruit walls to maximize the collection of solar energy. These walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm. Early fruit walls were built perpendicular to the ground and facing south, but over time, sloping walls were developed to make better use of sunlight. In 1699, [[Nicolas Fatio de Duillier]] even suggested using a [[Solar tracker|tracking mechanism]] which could pivot to follow the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;Butti and Perlin (1981), pp. 42–46&lt;/ref&gt; Applications of solar energy in agriculture aside from growing crops include pumping water, drying crops, brooding chicks and drying chicken manure.&lt;ref name="Leon 2006"&gt;Leon (2006), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bénard (1981), p. 347&lt;/ref&gt; More recently the technology has been embraced by [[Winemakers|vintners]], who use the energy generated by solar panels to power grape presses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novusvinum.com/news/latest_news.html#gonzales|title=A Powerhouse Winery|accessdate=5 November 2008|work=News Update|publisher=Novus Vinum|date=27 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greenhouse]]s convert solar light to heat, enabling year-round production and the growth (in enclosed environments) of specialty crops and other plants not naturally suited to the local climate. Primitive greenhouses were first used during Roman times to produce [[cucumbers]] year-round for the Roman emperor [[Tiberius]].&lt;ref&gt;Butti and Perlin (1981), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern greenhouses were built in Europe in the 16th century to keep exotic plants brought back from explorations abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Butti and Perlin (1981), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Greenhouses remain an important part of horticulture today, and plastic transparent materials have also been used to similar effect in [[polytunnel]]s and [[row cover]]s.

In 1974, the unmanned [[AstroFlight Sunrise]] airplane made the first solar flight.

A [[solar balloon]] is a black balloon that is filled with ordinary air. As sunlight shines on the balloon, the air inside is heated and expands causing an upward [[buoyancy]] force, much like an artificially heated [[hot air balloon]]. Some solar balloons are large enough for human flight, but usage is generally limited to the toy market as the surface-area to payload-weight ratio is relatively high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phenomena which affect a solar balloon|publisher=pagesperso-orange.fr|url=http://pagesperso-orange.fr/ballonsolaire/en-theorie1.htm|accessdate=19 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Solar chemical|Solar fuel|Artificial photosynthesis}}
Solar chemical processes use solar energy to drive chemical reactions. These processes offset energy that would otherwise come from a fossil fuel source and can also convert solar energy into storable and transportable fuels. Solar induced chemical reactions can be divided into thermochemical or [[photochemical]].&lt;ref&gt;Bolton (1977), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of fuels can be produced by [[artificial photosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Wasielewski M. R. Photoinduced electron transfer in supramolecular systems for artificial photosynthesis. Chem. Rev. 1992; 92: 435–461.&lt;/ref&gt; The multielectron catalytic chemistry involved in making carbon-based fuels (such as [[methanol]]) from reduction of [[carbon dioxide]] is challenging; a feasible alternative is [[hydrogen]] production from protons, though use of water as the source of electrons (as plants do) requires mastering the multielectron oxidation of two water molecules to molecular oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;Hammarstrom L. and Hammes-Schiffer S. Artificial Photosynthesis and Solar Fuels. Accounts of Chemical Research 2009; 42 (12): 1859–1860.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have envisaged working solar fuel plants in coastal metropolitan areas by 2050{{snd}} the splitting of sea water providing hydrogen to be run through adjacent fuel-cell electric power plants and the pure water by-product going directly into the municipal water system.&lt;ref&gt;Gray H. B. Powering the planet with solar fuel.

[[Hydrogen production]] technologies have been a significant area of solar chemical research since the 1970s. Aside from electrolysis driven by photovoltaic or photochemical cells, several thermochemical processes have also been explored. One such route uses concentrators to split water into oxygen and hydrogen at high temperatures ({{convert|2300|-|2600|C|disp=or|sigfig=2}}).&lt;ref&gt;Agrafiotis (2005), p. 409&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach uses the heat from solar concentrators to drive the [[steam reforming|steam reformation]] of natural gas thereby increasing the overall hydrogen yield compared to conventional reforming methods.&lt;ref&gt;Zedtwitz (2006), p. 1333&lt;/ref&gt; Thermochemical cycles characterized by the decomposition and regeneration of reactants present another avenue for hydrogen production. The Solzinc process under development at the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] uses a 1&amp;nbsp;MW solar furnace to decompose [[zinc oxide]] (ZnO) at temperatures above {{convert|1200|C|sigfig=2}}. This initial reaction produces pure zinc, which can subsequently be reacted with water to produce hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Energy Project at the Weizmann Institute Promises to Advance the use of Hydrogen Fuel|publisher=Weizmann Institute of Science|url=http://wis-wander.weizmann.ac.il/site/en/weizman.asp?pi=371&amp;doc_id=4210|accessdate=25 June 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406124059/http://wis-wander.weizmann.ac.il/site/en/weizman.asp?pi=371&amp;doc_id=4210|archivedate=6 April 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy storage methods==
{{Main|Energy storage|Seasonal thermal energy storage|Phase change material|Grid energy storage|V2G}}
[[File:12-05-08 AS1.JPG|thumb|[[Thermal energy storage]]. The [[Andasol solar power station|Andasol]] CSP plant uses tanks of molten salt to store solar energy.]]
[[Thermal mass]] systems can store solar energy in the form of heat at domestically useful temperatures for daily or [[seasonal thermal energy storage|interseasonal durations]]. Thermal storage systems generally use readily available materials with high [[specific heat]] capacities such as water, earth and stone. Well-designed systems can lower [[peak demand]], shift time-of-use to [[wikt:off-peak|off-peak]] hours and reduce overall heating and cooling requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Balcomb(1992), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Request for Participation Summer 2005 Demand Shifting with Thermal Mass|publisher=Demand Response Research Center|url=http://www.drrc.lbl.gov/pubs/RFP_071405.pdf|accessdate=26 November 2007|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907214724/http://drrc.lbl.gov/pubs/RFP_071405.pdf|archivedate=7 September 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phase change materials such as [[paraffin wax]] and [[Sodium sulfate#Thermal storage|Glauber's salt]] are another thermal storage medium. These materials are inexpensive, readily available, and can deliver domestically useful temperatures (approximately {{convert|64|C|disp=or}}). The "Dover House" (in [[Dover, Massachusetts]]) was the first to use a Glauber's salt heating system, in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Butti and Perlin (1981), pp. 212–214&lt;/ref&gt; Solar energy can also be stored at high temperatures using [[molten salt]]s. Salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. The [[The Solar Project#Solar Two|Solar Two]] project used this method of energy storage, allowing it to store {{convert|1.44|TJ|lk=in}} in its 68 m³ storage tank with an annual storage efficiency of about 99%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advantages of Using Molten Salt|publisher=Sandia National Laboratory|url=http://www.sandia.gov/Renewable_Energy/solarthermal/NSTTF/salt.htm|accessdate=29 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Off-grid [[Photovoltaics|PV systems]] have traditionally used [[rechargeable batteries]] to store excess electricity. With grid-tied systems, excess electricity can be sent to the transmission [[Grid-tied electrical system|grid]], while standard grid electricity can be used to meet shortfalls. [[Net metering]] programs give household systems a credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid. This is handled by 'rolling back' the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes. If the net electricity use is below zero, the utility then rolls over the kilowatt hour credit to the next month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PV Systems and Net Metering |publisher=Department of Energy |url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/net_metering.html |accessdate=31 July 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704062311/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/net_metering.html |archivedate=4 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other approaches involve the use of two meters, to measure electricity consumed vs. electricity produced. This is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter. Most standard meters accurately measure in both directions, making a second meter unnecessary.

[[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] stores energy in the form of water pumped when energy is available from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation one. The energy is recovered when demand is high by releasing the water, with the pump becoming a hydroelectric power generator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pumped Hydro Storage |publisher=Electricity Storage Association |url=http://www.electricitystorage.org/tech/technologies_technologies_pumpedhydro.htm |accessdate=31 July 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621052054/http://www.electricitystorage.org/tech/technologies_technologies_pumpedhydro.htm |archivedate=21 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Deployment of solar power to energy grids}}{{See also|Cost of electricity by source|Renewable energy by country}}
Beginning with the surge in [[coal]] use which accompanied the [[Industrial Revolution]], energy consumption has steadily transitioned from wood and biomass to [[fossil fuel]]s. The early development of solar technologies starting in the 1860s was driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce. However, development of solar technologies stagnated in the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century in the face of the increasing availability, economy, and utility of coal and [[petroleum]].&lt;ref&gt;Butti and Perlin (1981), pp. 63, 77, 101&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1973 oil crisis|1973 oil embargo]] and [[1979 energy crisis]] caused a reorganization of energy policies around the world and brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Butti and Perlin (1981), p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yergin (1991), pp. 634, 653–673&lt;/ref&gt; Deployment strategies focused on incentive programs such as the Federal Photovoltaic Utilization Program in the U.S. and the Sunshine Program in Japan. Other efforts included the formation of research facilities in the U.S. (SERI, now [[NREL]]), Japan ([[New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization|NEDO]]), and [[Solar power in Germany|Germany]] ([[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronicle of Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft|publisher=Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft|url=http://www.fraunhofer.de/EN/company/profile/chronicle/1972-1982.jsp|accessdate=4 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial solar water heaters began appearing in the United States in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Butti and Perlin (1981), p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; These systems saw increasing use until the 1920s but were gradually replaced by cheaper and more reliable heating fuels.&lt;ref&gt;Butti and Perlin (1981), p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; As with photovoltaics, [[solar water heating]] attracted renewed attention as a result of the oil crises in the 1970s but interest subsided in the 1980s due to falling petroleum prices. Development in the solar water heating sector progressed steadily throughout the 1990s and annual growth rates have averaged 20% since 1999.&lt;ref name="SWH 2008"&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Heat Worldwide – Markets and Contribution to the Energy Supply 2006|author=Weiss, Werner|author2=Bergmann, Irene|author3=Faninger, Gerhard|publisher=International Energy Agency|url=http://www.iea-shc.org/data/sites/1/publications/IEA-SHC_Solar_Heat_Worldwide-2008.pdf|accessdate=9 June 2008|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although generally underestimated, solar water heating and cooling is by far the most widely deployed solar technology with an estimated capacity of 154&amp;nbsp;GW as of 2007.&lt;ref name="SWH 2008"/&gt;

The [[International Energy Agency]] has said that solar energy can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces:&lt;ref name=ie11/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating climate change, and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared.&lt;ref name=ie11/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2011, a report by the [[International Energy Agency]] found that solar energy technologies such as photovoltaics, solar hot water and concentrated solar power could provide a third of the world's energy by 2060 if politicians commit to limiting [[climate change]]. The energy from the sun could play a key role in de-carbonizing the global economy alongside improvements in [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and imposing costs on [[greenhouse gas]] emitters. "The strength of solar is the incredible variety and flexibility of applications, from small scale to big scale".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-01/iea-says-solar-may-provide-a-third-of-global-energy-by-2060.html|title=IEA Says Solar May Provide a Third of Global Energy by 2060|date=1 December 2011|work=Bloomberg Businessweek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ISO standards==
The [[International Organization for Standardization]] has established several standards relating to solar energy equipment. For example, ISO 9050 relates to glass in building while ISO 10217 relates to the materials used in solar water heaters.

'''Sunanda Devi''' ({{lang-hi|सुनन्दा देवी}}) previously known as '''Nanda Devi East''' is the lower of the two adjacent peaks of the highest mountain in [[Uttarakhand]] and second highest mountain in [[India]]; [[Nanda Devi]] is its higher [[twin peak]]. Nanda Devi and Sunanda Devi are part of the [[Garhwal Himalaya]]s, and are located in the state of Uttarakhand. The graceful peaks of twin mountains are visible from almost everywhere in [[Kumaon division|Kumaon]]. The first ascent to the Sunanda Devi peak in recorded history appears to be in 1939 by Jakub Bujak and Janusz Klarner. The elevation of Sunanda Devi is {{convert|7434|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and its prominence is {{convert|260|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}.

==Religious Significance==

Sunanda Devi is the lower eastern summit of the twin peaks of [[Nanda Devi]] a two-peaked massif, forming a 2 kilometres long ridge, oriented east-west. The western summit is higher, and the eastern summit earlier called Nanda Devi East is now also referred to as Sunanda Devi. Together the peaks may be referred to as the peaks of the goddesses Nanda and Sunanda. These goddesses have occurred together in ancient [[Sanskrit]] literature, [http://bhagavata.org/canto4/chapter12.html Srimad Bhagvatam] or [[Bhagavata Purana]] ([[Gita Press]] has a two-volume English and Hindi translation) and are frequently worshipped together in the [[Kumaon division|Kumaon]] and [[Garhwal division|Garhwal]] as well as elsewhere in India. Regarding certain mountains as sacred and associating them with specific Gods and Goddesses is a practice prevalent in other parts of [[Asia]] as well e.g. the volcanic [[Mount Fuji]] in Japan appears to have been named after the [http://www.sacred-destinations.com/japan/mount-fuji fire goddess]. The first published reference to Nanda Devi East as Sunanda Devi appears to be in a recent novel (Malhotra 2011) that has the Kumaon region as backdrop. An annual [[Nanda Devi Raj Jat]] festival celebrating the two [https://archive.is/20130218091805/http://www.wemix.in/goddess-nanda-sunanda/ goddesses] is popular in Uttarakhand.

The [[Himalaya]] have also been personified as the Lord Himavata, the God of snow, who is mentioned in the [[Mahabharata]]. He is father of [[Ganga (goddess)|Ganga]] and [[Saraswati (goddess)|Saraswati]], that  became rivers, and [[Parvati]] an avatar of the great Mother Goddess [[Durga]], who married [[Shiva]] and the goddesses Nanda and Sunanda who too are avatars or close spiritual associates of the goddess Durga.

==Climbing History==
A four-member [http://www.himalayanclub.org/journal/the-polish-ascent-of-nanda-devi-east-1939/ Polish expedition] led by Adam Karpiński climbed the Sunanda Devi peak in 1939  from Longstaff Col which is the standard route on the peak. The summit party was Jakub Bujak and Janusz Klarner. Another attempt to reach the Sunanda Devi peak in 1951 resulted in the death of two members of a French expedition in 1951. [[Tenzing Norgay]] who first climbed [[Mount Everest]] was a part of the support team. He and Louis Dubost climbed Sunanda Devi to look for the missing pair. Tenzing Norgay later stated that it was the most difficult climb of his life, even more difficult than Everest. Since then the peak has been reached by an Indo-French group in 1975 and perhaps also an [[Indian Army]] expedition in 1981 but the mountaineers in this last case did not survive to tell the story. The standard approach to the south ridge route is from the [[Milam Valley]] to the east, that passes through Lawan Glacier and onwards to Longstaff Col. The trek goes through the picturesque villages of [[Munsyari]] and Bhadeligwar.

Marco Dalla Longa led a large [http://www.indmount.org/nandadevieast2005.aspx Italian expedition] of twelve members to Sunanda Devi Summit in 2005. They approached the peak from Munsyari and the Milam valley. Camps were set up to 5400m. The Italian team made good progress on Sunanda Devi, through the central pillar on the east face. They were proceeding towards the summit when a long spell of bad weather from 9 September to 18 September made them sit up at the higher camps. Then tragedy struck the Italian team on Nanda Devi. Expedition leader Marco Dalla Longa died suddenly. He died by a coma stroke on 24 September. The team’s doctor suspected [[cerebral oedema]]. Longa was young and fit, with no health problems reported during the expedition up to that time. The entire expedition was evacuated by air from 27 September to Munsyari and to [[Delhi]] by air the next day.

==Nanda Devi National Park and Valley of Flowers National Parks==

[[Nanda Devi National Park]] along with the [[Valley of Flowers National Park]] are some of the most spectacular wilderness areas in the Himalayas. It is dominated by the peaks of Nanda Devi and Sunanda Devi of India’s second highest mountain which is approached through the Rishiganga gorge, one of the deepest in the world. No humans live in the Park which has remained more or less intact because of its rugged inaccessibility. It has a very diverse flora and is the habitat of several endangered mammals, among them the [[snow leopard]], [[serow]], [[himalayan musk deer]] and [[bharal]]. [[Nanda Devi National Park]] lies in eastern Uttarakhand, near the Tibetan border in the [[Garhwal Himalaya]], 300&amp;nbsp;km northeast of Delhi.

'''''The Birds of Australia''''' is a 12-volume [[ornithology|ornithological]] [[handbook]] covering the [[bird]]s of [[Australia]].  It was the second of three monumental illustrated works dealing with the avifauna of the continent and was published midway between the other two, the first being [[John Gould|Gould’s]] identically titled ''[[The Birds of Australia (Gould)|The Birds of Australia]]'' (1840-1848), and the third the ''[[Handbook of Australian, New Zealand and Antarctic Birds]]'' (1990-2006).

==History==
It was sponsored and authored by wealthy Australia amateur ornithologist [[Gregory Mathews]], with considerable assistance from his collaborator and private secretary [[Tom Iredale]], and was published by [[H. F. &amp; G. Witherby]] of [[London]] over a 17-year period from 1910 to 1927.  The text and plates, comprising 12 volumes, were issued serially in 75 parts in royal [[quarto]] format in an edition of 225 numbered copies.&lt;ref name=Stone27&gt;Stone (1927).&lt;/ref&gt;  The five supplements issued at various times during the long publication period fill a 13th, supplementary, volume; the first three supplements comprising the ''Check-List of Australian Birds'', and the last two the ''Bibliography of the Birds of Australia''.&lt;ref name=Whittell/&gt;

When the publication was complete it was reviewed in the [[Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union|RAOU]] journal ''[[Emu (journal)|The Emu]]'' by [[John Albert Leach|J. A. Leach]] (as J.A.L.) who wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In these twelve splendid volumes, Mr Mathews has stressed largely the nomenclatural aspect, a phase of ornithology which received little attention from John Gould in the eight folio volumes of his highly valued work, ''The Birds of Australia''.  Gould seldom listed a date, and therefore he failed to recognize occasionally that another name listed by him was really older than the name used by him.  He was a firm believer in the use of the prior name; this he showed by changing when necessary to an older name.  These two great ornithological works which have the same title, and of which Australians are justly proud are thus complementary.  Gould emphasized the field and natural history sides, while Mathews stressed the academic and nomenclatural aspects.  An Australian student having the use of these fine volumes is well equipped with material on which to base future studies."&lt;ref&gt;J.A.L. (1928).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mathews’ approach to [[nomenclature]] was controversial and not always consistent.  In a review in the [[American Ornithologists' Union|AOU]] journal ''[[The Auk]]'', the editor [[Witmer Stone]] comments:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is interesting in view of Mr Mathews's many discussions of nomenclature to see how his attitude on certain points changed as his work progressed.  In the opening volume he congratulates the authorities of the British Museum upon their intention of ignoring many of the "useless generic names" of the late [[Richard Bowdler Sharpe|Dr Bowdler Sharpe]] and yet in a few years we see Mr Mathews as one of the most extreme genus splitters that ornithology has known.  So again in spite of his vigorous plea for the universal use of subspecies we find him, by the time Vol. V is reached, refusing to give them the full recognition in the text that they had previously received and simply discussing them at the end of each species.  And what is far worse placing them in the synonymy where they cannot be distinguished from the real synonyms.  The number and treatment of subspecies however are ornithological problems, always subject to personal opinion, with no possible "code" to govern them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We have felt that the great amount of space devoted to nomenclatural discussion in the 'Birds of Australia' was unfortunate as most of the facts could usually have been stated without nearly so much verbiage and often the very fact that the author was endeavoring to bring out has been obscured by useless repetition.  It seems as if some parts of the text may have been printed from a hastily prepared manuscript without revision.  We have discussed Mr Mathews’ great work from a nomenclatural point of view because that seems to have been the author's chief concern in its production and that is the feature that will be remembered in the future.  He has, however, collected a great deal of valuable and interesting data on the lives and habits of the birds but as he tells us the adequate life histories of the Australian birds are yet to be written and his aim has been to clear away the technical difficulties in Australian ornithology and set up the species and their names on a permanent basis.  This we feel that he has done or at least has presented all of the necessary information on the subject, an achievement of which he may well be proud."&lt;ref name=Stone27/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Lipoaocellata.JPG|thumb|''Lipoa ocellata'' ([[malleefowl]]) from Volume I. Keulemans]]
As well as the extensive scientific text, in which Mathews described several new [[species]] and [[subspecies]], the 12 volumes are illustrated with some 600 hand-coloured [[lithograph]]ed plates by [[John Gerrard Keulemans|J.G. Keulemans]] (who completed 163 illustrations for the first four volumes before his death on 29 March 1912), [[Henrik Grönvold|H. Grönvold]], [[Roland Green (painter)|Roland Green]], [[Herbert Goodchild]] and [[George Edward Lodge|G.E. Lodge]].  Stone commented on the plates by saying that as artistic productions they could not be compared with the great folios of John Gould, though those by Keulemans were probably the best.&lt;ref name=Stone27/&gt;

==Associated works==
After completing the publication of the 12 volumes, in 1928 Mathews produced '''''The Birds of Norfolk and Lord Howe Islands and the Australian South Polar Quadrant''''', in the same format and with the same publisher, containing 45 lithographic plates.  It was followed in 1936 by '''''A Supplement to the Birds of Norfolk and Lord Howe Islands to which is Added those Birds of New Zealand not figured by Buller''''', containing 57 plates.  Although not technically part of ''The Birds of Australia'', these two volumes extend its coverage to Australia’s [[Norfolk Island]] and [[Lord Howe Island]] in the [[Tasman Sea]], and even attempt to fill in the gaps left in [[Walter Buller]]’s coverage of [[New Zealand]] in his similarly ambitious ''[[A History of the Birds of New Zealand]]'' (1872-1873, 2nd edition 1887-1888).&lt;ref&gt;Robin (2001), pp.59-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thermal lows''', or '''heat lows''', are non-[[weather front|frontal]] [[low-pressure area]]s that occur over the continents in the [[subtropics]] during the warm season, as the result of intense heating when compared to their surrounding environments.&lt;ref name="thermal"&gt;Glossary of Meteorology (2009). [http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=thermal-low1 Thermal Low.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522195848/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=thermal-low1 |date=2008-05-22 }} [[American Meteorological Society]]. Retrieved on 2009-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Thermal lows occur near the [[Sonoran Desert]], on the [[Mexican plateau]], in California's [[Central Valley (California)|Great Central Valley]], the [[Sahara]], over north-west [[Argentina]] in [[South America]], over the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] region of north-west [[Australia]], the [[Iberian peninsula]], and the [[Tibetan plateau]].

Over land, intense, rapid solar heating of the land surface results in heating of the lowest layers of the atmosphere via reradiated energy in the infrared spectrum.  The resulting hotter air is less dense than surrounding cooler air.  This, combined with the rising of the hot air, results in the formation of a low pressure area.  Elevated areas can enhance the strength of the thermal low as they warm more quickly than the atmosphere which surrounds them at the same altitude.   Over the water, instability lows form during the winter when the air overlying the land is colder than the warmer water body.  Thermal lows tend to have weak circulations, and can extend to {{convert|3100|m|ft}} in height.  Thermal lows over the western and southern portions of North America, northern Africa, and southeast Asia are strong enough to lead to summer [[monsoon]] conditions.  Development of thermal lows inland of the coastline lead to the development of [[sea breeze]]s.  Sea breezes combined with rugged topography near the coast can encourage poor air quality.

==Formation==
[[File:Rain in the Wah Wah Valley.jpg|thumb|An isolated thunderstorm rolls through [[Wah Wah Valley]], [[Utah]].  This type of monsoonal pattern is very common in the late summer of the southwest US.]]
In deserts, lack of ground and plant moisture that would normally provide [[evaporative cooling]] can lead to intense, rapid solar heating of the lower layers of air. The hot air is less dense than surrounding cooler air. This, combined with the rising of the hot air, results in a low pressure area called a thermal low.&lt;ref name="thermal"/&gt;  Over elevated surfaces, heating of the ground exceeds the heating of the surrounding air at the same altitude above [[sea level]], which creates an associated heat low over the terrain and enhances any thermal lows which would have otherwise existed.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Weather Service]] Office in [[Tucson, Arizona]] (2008).

==Role in the monsoon regime==
[[File:India southwest summer monsoon onset map en.svg|thumb|250 px|right|Onset dates and prevailing wind currents of the southwest summer monsoon]]

{{Main|Monsoon}}
Monsoons are caused by the larger amplitude of the seasonal cycle of land temperature compared to that of nearby oceans. This differential warming happens because heat in the ocean is mixed vertically through a "mixed layer" that may be fifty meters deep, through the action of wind and buoyancy-generated [[turbulence]], whereas the land surface conducts heat slowly, with the seasonal signal penetrating perhaps a meter or so.  Additionally, the [[specific heat capacity]] of liquid water is significantly higher than that of most materials that make up land.  Together, these factors mean that the heat capacity of the layer participating in the seasonal cycle is much larger over the oceans than over land, with the consequence that the air over the land warms faster and reaches a higher temperature than the air over the ocean. The hot air over the land tends to rise, creating an area of [[low pressure]]. This creates a steady wind blowing toward the land, bringing the moist near-surface air over the oceans with it.&lt;ref name="cause"&gt;Dr. Louisa Watts (2009).

In winter, the land cools off quickly, but the ocean keeps the heat longer due to its higher specific heat. The hot air over the ocean rises, creating a low pressure area and a breeze from land to ocean while a large area of drying high pressure is formed over the land, increased by wintertime cooling.&lt;ref name="cause"/&gt;  Monsoons are similar to [[sea breezes|sea and land breezes]], a term usually referring to the localized, diurnal (daily) cycle of circulation near coastlines everywhere, but they are much larger in scale, stronger and seasonal.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC]] Weather.

==Role in sea breeze formation==
[[File:SeaBreeze.svg|thumb|right|250px|Schematic cross section through a sea breeze front. If the air inland is moist, cumulus often marks the front's location.]]
{{Main|Sea breeze}}
The [[ocean|sea]] is warmed by the sun to a greater depth than the land due to its greater [[specific heat]].&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Steve Ackerman (1995).  [http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/wxwise/seabrz.html Sea and Land Breezes.] [[University of Wisconsin]]. Retrieved on 2006-10-24.&lt;/ref&gt;  The sea therefore has a greater capacity for absorbing heat than the land, so the surface of the sea warms up more slowly than the land's surface.  As the temperature of the surface of the [[landform|land]] rises, the land heats the air above it.  The warm air is less dense and so it rises.  This rising air over the land lowers the [[sea level pressure]] by about 0.2%.  The cooler air above the sea, now with higher sea level pressure, flows towards the land into the lower pressure, creating a cooler breeze near the coast.  The strength of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the land and the sea.  If the environmental wind field is greater than {{convert|8|kn|km/h}} and opposing the direction of a possible sea breeze, the sea breeze is not likely to develop.&lt;ref&gt;JetStream:  An Online School For Weather (2008).

Along the California coast, the cooler water sets up a surface marine layer that is much cooler than inland areas during the summer.  At the same time, the intense heating inland creates a pronounced thermal trough aligned with the Great Central Valley and typically linked to the broader thermal low across the North American deserts.  As a consequence, a strong pressure gradient is created which draws cool marine air landward.  As temperatures plummet, fog and stratus stream in and through the gaps of the Coast Ranges, and especially through the Golden Gate at San Francisco (''see'' [[San Francisco fog]]).  The same thermal trough is sometimes pushed toward the coast, especially in late Fall as higher pressure develops to the east due to cooling further east.  This setup often brings the warmest temperatures of the year to the normally cool coastline as the seabreeze stops or is even replaced by a dangerously dry land breeze.

==Role in air pollution==
In areas where it is hilly or mountainous near the coastline, thermally-forced sea breezes combined with wind circulations up the sides of the mountains can encourage the production of chemicals which can lead to the development of [[smog]].  Pollution has been tracked into the mid-levels of the [[troposphere]] in the form of [[ozone]], which is concentrated over the circulation of the thermal low as well as adjacent oceanic areas.&lt;ref&gt;A.C.

What would be termed "[[herbfield]]s" for European mountains, and bunchgrass meadows in North America, are referred to as tussock herbfields in New Zealand due to a dominance of this type of plant.  Species of the genus ''Chionochloa'' dominate in these areas.  The larger tussocks are called snow grass (or less commonly as snow tussocks) and may grow up to 2 metres in height. They grow slowly and some specimens are estimated to be several centuries old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

'''William Humphrey''' (June 18, 1924 – August 20, 1997) was an American novelist, memoirist, short story writer, and author of literary sporting and nature stories. His published works, while still available in French translation, largely have been out of print until recently. ''Home from the Hill'' and ''The Ordways'' are available from LSU Press. In 2015, Open Road Media published the complete works of William Humphrey in digital form.

Of significant interest to readers of Humphrey are ''Wakeful Anguish, A Literary Biography of William Humphrey'' by Ashby Bland Crowder as well as ''Far From Home, Selected Letters of William Humphrey'' edited by Crowder, both available from Louisiana State University Press.

==Biography==
William Humphrey was born on 18 June 1924 to Clarence and Nell (Varley) Humphrey in [[Clarksville, Texas]], a region that is culturally southern rather than western. His parents were poor and uneducated, and they moved from house to house because they were unable to keep up with the rent. His father eventually owned and operated an auto repair shop in Clarksville. By the 1950s, Humphrey had escaped his origins: He was thought of as a member of the glittering literati of the northeast, and [[Vogue (magazine)|''Vogue'']] magazine featured him in its “gallery of international charmers among men,” along with Marlon Brando, Sir Edmund Hillary, Leonard Bernstein, and John F. Kennedy. But Humphrey thought little of such “honors” and took no opportunity to capitalize on such chances at fame. He preferred to retreat to his desk and write, thinking any recognition should come from his writing. Unlike Truman Capote and Norman Mailer, and despite his profound desire to be remembered for his literary contributions, Humphrey made very little effort to promote himself.

The central event in Humphrey’s childhood was the death of his father in a car wreck when the boy was 13. His memoir ''Farther Off from Heaven'', published in 1977, is a moving account of this event’s effect on him. He and his mother, Nell Varley Humphrey, moved to Dallas because there was no work for her in Clarksville. Humphrey attended [[Southern Methodist University]] and the University of Texas (perhaps at the Austin campus since his papers are archived in their library),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/uthrc/00178.xml Humphrey, William, 1924-1997 William Humphrey Papers 1932-1992, n.d. (bulk 1944-1992) 28 boxes, 1 oversize box, 1 oversize folder, 9 galley folders (11.86 linear feet) Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas at Austin These materials document the family, life, and work of the American writer William Humphrey. The papers contain manuscripts and notebooks covering most of his books and short stories. Also included are large amounts of newspaper clippings, correspondence, and photographs. English, French, and Italian.]&lt;/ref&gt; but never graduated. He left Texas as soon as he could.

Humphrey move Chicago and then New York City with his play ''Ambassador Ben'' in hand to see if he could become a Broadway success. This was in 1945. The play never was performed and never published. Humphrey began to write stories and left New York City to write in Brewster, New York. There Humphrey worked on the farm belonging to Donald Peterson, the producer and director of ''The Ave Maria Hour'' on [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]] radio. Humphrey published ''The Last Husband and Other Stories'', his first book of stories, in 1953.

Humphrey secured a teaching post at [[Bard College]] in [[Annandale-on-Hudson]], New York in 1949, the same year he married Dorothy Feinman Cantine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askart.com/artist_bio/artist/11009539/artist.aspx AskArt: Dorothy Feinman Humphrey]&lt;/ref&gt; a painter of considerable talent who had a daughter Toni. He taught at Bard until 1958 when the success of his first novel, ''Home from the Hill'' (1958), and its [[Home from the Hill (film)|1960 film]] adaptation, gave him enough money to quit teaching and devote himself to writing full-time.

==Career==
Humphrey wrote 13 books, including five novels, collections of short stories and a memoir. His first novel, ''[[Home from the Hill (novel)|Home from the Hill]]'', was made into a 1960 [[MGM]] film. While the movie betrays the original intent of the author, and Humphrey claimed never to have seen it, the sale of the movie rights enabled the struggling Humphrey family to pursue a literary life.  His second novel, ''The Ordways'', was reviewed by the '''New York Times'' as "Funny, vivid and moving, this is a fine piece of work and a delight to read," and was compared to the writings of [[William Faulkner]] and [[Mark Twain]]. His books received high praise when they were first published, even from fellow writers. He went on to publish a dozen more books.

Humphrey wrote fiction that addressed the Southern past. He once asserted, “I am a destroyer of myths. My whole work has shown the danger and falseness of myths..[especially] the myth of the South” (“Notes on the Orestia,” 38; MS at Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, University of Texas at Austin).

''Home from the Hill'' (1958) is Humphrey’s first and most famous novel. It is the story of the aristocratic Hunnicutt family, a holdover from the Old South. The family is fated to end in destruction for the same reason that the Old South itself was destroyed—because of a moral corruption at its core.

The novel ''Hostages to Fortune'' (1985) represents a return to the tragic mode. Humphrey’s first novel set outside the South, it portrays a man named Ben Curtis on the day he reenters life after a two-year descent into darkness resulting from his son’s suicide. His effort to understand why his son committed suicide leads to his own attempted suicide. Richard Lipez said of this novel:

"To pick up Humphrey’s extraordinary new novel is to hold an embodiment of grief in your hands. The unrelenting anguish that suffuses this story [is] almost unbearable to behold. It is possible to get through it because the stark poetry of Humphrey’s work is enthralling." (Newsweek)

His last book was ''September Song'' (1992), a collection of short stories about old age. The collection of Humphrey’s letters, ''Far from Home'' (2008), provides enlightening analysis of his own works. They also display his relationship with other writers, including Katherine Anne Porter, Theodore Weiss, and Rust Hill.

Jonathan Yardley, writing in The Washington Post (issue of 5 July 1992), remarked of Humphrey:

"Minor, but interesting and admirable. It has been a long time since Humphrey has enjoyed a commercial success, but he has dedicated his life to his writing with a fidelity all too rare in a culture that encourages facile success and empty honor."

The '''Women's World Golf Rankings''', also known for sponsorship reasons as the '''[[Rolex]] Rankings''', were introduced in February 2006. They are sanctioned by eight women's golf [[professional golf tours|tours]] and the organisations behind them: [[Ladies Professional Golf Association]] (LPGA Tour), [[Ladies European Tour]], [[Ladies Professional Golfers' Association of Japan]] (LPGA of Japan Tour), [[Korea Ladies Professional Golf Association]] (LPGA of Korea Tour), [[Australian Ladies Professional Golf]] (ALPG Tour), [[Symetra Tour]], [[China LPGA Tour|China Ladies Professional Golf Association Tour]], the [[LET Access Series|Ladies European Tour Access Series]] and also by the [[Ladies' Golf Union]], which administers the [[Women's British Open]] and the [[United States Golf Association]] which conducts the [[U.S. Women's Open]].

The idea of introducing a set of women's rankings similar to the [[Official World Golf Ranking]] was developed at the May 2004 World Congress of Women's Golf, and was first planned for 2005,&lt;ref name="rankingsplanned"&gt;
{{cite web
  | title = Women's World Rankings to begin in 2005
  | publisher = Golf Today
  | date = 2004
  | url = http://www.golftoday.co.uk/news/yeartodate/news04/womens_rankings.html
  | accessdate =16 April 2007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; but then put back to 2006.

==Calculation of the rankings==
The rankings are based on performances on the eight major tours (LPGA, JLPGA, KLPGA, LET, ALPG, Symetra Tour, LETAS, CLPGA) over a two-year period. Amateur players are eligible. The system for calculating the rankings is similar to that for the men's Official World Golf Ranking. Players receive points for each good finish on the relevant tours, with the number of points available in each event depending on the strength of the field, as determined by the competitors' existing rankings (when the rankings were introduced rankings were calculated for earlier periods; the first ever set showed notional changes since the previous week). The only exceptions are the five [[LPGA majors]] and all Symetra Tour, CLPGA and LETAS events, which have a fixed-point allocation. Rankings are tapered so the recent results are more important.

===Original formula===
When the rankings were first introduced in February 2006, a player's ranking as calculated in the above description was divided by the number of events played, with a minimum required events of 15 over the previous two years. In addition, players were required to play in a minimum of 15 eligible events over the previous two-year period to be included in the rankings.

===Formula revisions===
On 2 August 2006 the Rolex Rankings Board and Technical Committee announced following its bi-annual meeting two changes to the ranking formula.&lt;ref name="aug2006rev"&gt;
{{cite web
  | title = Two modifications announced for Rolex Rankings
  | publisher=LPGA
  | date = 3 August 2006
  | url = http://www.lpga.com/content_1.aspx?mid=2&amp;pid=7574
  | accessdate =3 August 2006 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
#The elimination of the minimum event requirement. Players would no longer be required to participate in 15 qualifying events to be included in the rankings and could be included after playing in as few as one qualifying event. This change would also have the effect of permitting amateurs who had played well in one event to be ranked (e.g., [[Morgan Pressel]], who finished second in the 2005 [[U.S. Women's Open]], or [[Michelle Wie]] from age 13).
# The introduction of a minimum divisor. Where previously a player's point total was divided by the number of events she played over the previous 104 weeks, now the player's point total would be divided by the greater of (i) the number of events played or (ii) 35. Thus, players with 35 or more events over the previous 104 weeks would continue to use the actual number of events played as the divisor, but players with fewer than 35 events would use 35 as the divisor.

Many commentators saw the latter change as directed at [[Michelle Wie]], who at the time was ranked second in the world despite having competed in only 16 women's professional events in the two-year period. However, the chairman of the Rolex Rankings Technical Committee defended the change as one designed to make the women's rankings more comparable to the [[Official World Golf Ranking]] for men, which use a minimum divisor of 40 events.

On 16 April 2007, another modification in the formula was introduced. Instead of points being awarded on an accumulated 104-week rolling period, with the points awarded in the most recent 13-week period carrying a stronger value, points began to be reduced in 91 equal decrements following week 13 for the remaining 91 weeks of the two-year Rolex Ranking period rather than the seven equal 13 week decrements previously used.&lt;ref name="apr162007rev"&gt;
{{cite web
  | title = Modification Announced to Rolex Rankings Calculations
  | publisher=LPGA
  | date = 9 April 2007
  | url = http://www.lpga.com/content_1.aspx?pid=10409&amp;mid=4
  | accessdate =16 April 2007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; This modification did not have an immediate impact on the rankings.

==Criticisms==
When they were introduced the rankings attracted considerable criticism on two grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://golf.about.com/b/a/245967.htm |title=First Women's World Golf Rankings Stir Up Controversy |last=Kelley |first=Brent |publisher=about.com |date=21 February 2006 |accessdate=3 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First, it was widely felt that members of the LPGA of Japan Tour were ranked too high, since few of them had competed successfully outside Japan. Second, the minimum of 15 events needed to qualify for a ranking was widely seen as having been selected purely to enable [[Michelle Wie]] to be highly ranked because she had played exactly that number in the preceding two years, while every other highly ranked player had played many more events. If the women's rankings used the same system used for the men's rankings – that is a minimum number of events of one but a minimum denominator of 40 to calculate the average points per tournament – Wie would have been just outside the top 10. But under the women's ranking system where only players who had played a minimum number of events were included, if the minimum number of events had been set higher than 15, Wie would not have been ranked at all.

The August 2006 revised formula addressed the second criticism. The technical committee that administers the rankings urged patience with regard to the first criticism, since the continuing "strength of the field" weighting of tournaments may correct the issue without any technical changes being made.

==Significance of the rankings==
The rankings are used by each of the sponsoring tours to determine eligibility criteria for certain events. For example, 40 of the 144 places in the [[Women's British Open]] are currently awarded on the basis of the rankings—10 to LET members and 30 to LPGA members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lgu.org/data/files/entry_2011_rwboconditions.pdf |title=Entry Form, 2011 Ricoh Women's British Open: Rules and Conditions |publisher=[[Ladies' Golf Union]] |format=PDF |accessdate=29 July 2011}} See especially "7. Exemptions from Pre-Qualifying and Final Qualifying", pages 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Four of the 12 places in the European [[Solheim Cup]] team are allocated on the basis of the rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/golf/4918154.stm |title=Solheim selection process changes |work=BBC Sport |date=18 April 2006 |accessdate=3 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2013, the rankings at the end of each LPGA Tour season in odd-numbered years have determined the eight countries that will compete in the following year's [[International Crown]], a LPGA-sponsored team event scheduled in even-numbered years and first held in 2014. More specifically, the countries whose top four players have the highest cumulative rankings are invited to compete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.lpga.com/golf/news/2013/1/global-announcement.aspx |title=32 Players, 8 Countries, 1 Crown: LPGA Unveils the International Crown |publisher=LPGA |date=24 January 2013 |accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual participants from each qualified country are determined by the rankings immediately prior to the [[ANA Inspiration]] (known before 2015 as the Kraft Nabisco Championship) in the year of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.lpgainternationalcrown.com/golf/news/2013/7/international-crown-tickets.aspx |title=LPGA International Crown Celebrates "Year from Here" Event |publisher=LPGA |date=23 July 2013 |accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Notes'''&lt;br /&gt; &lt;small&gt;
*On 12 January 2009, [[Annika Sörenstam]], who was ranked No. 3 the previous week despite having announced her retirement effective at the end of the 2008 season, was removed from the rankings. No official explanation was given for her removal. Sörenstam later posted in her personal blog that she asked to be removed.&lt;ref name="sorenstam-removal"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sörenstam |first=Annika |title=Annika's Blog February 2009 |date=February 2009 |url=http://www.annikablog.com/annika-qa.html |accessdate=2 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324083936/http://www.annikablog.com/annika-qa.html |archivedate=24 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 10 May 2010, one week after announcing that she was retiring from golf, [[Lorena Ochoa]] also voluntarily removed herself from the rankings. Her last position in the rankings was No. 2 for the week of 3 May 2010.&lt;ref name="ochoa-removal"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ochoa removed from women's golf rankings |publisher=UPI.com |date=10 May 2010 |url=http://www.upi.com/Sports_News/2010/05/10/Ochoa-removed-from-womens-golf-rankings/UPI-75091273507237/ |accessdate =10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1736">'''Wunderlich''' refers to a series of [[vacuum tube]]s introduced in the early 1930s.  Wunderlichs were designed to be used as full-wave [[detector (radio)|detectors]] in [[amplitude modulation|AM]] [[radio]] receivers.  However, because of their unusual design, they were rarely used in commercially manufactured receivers.  The tube is named for its inventor, Norman Wunderlich.

==Structure==
The Wunderlich tube is a twin medium-mu [[triode]].  The tube has two identical control grids that operate in tandem with a common heater, indirectly heated [[cathode]] and plate.  

==Function==
Typically, the two grids are connected to opposite ends of the center-tapped secondary of the final [[intermediate frequency|IF]] transformer.  The center tap of the secondary is then connected to ground through a parallel-connected resistor and capacitor circuit.  This causes the tube to act as a full-wave [[grid leak]] detector.  In some circuits, the center tap also provides [[automatic gain control|AVC]] bias voltage to the converter and/or IF amplifier.  Some Wunderlichs, like the Wunderlich B, have a diode plate or a second grid that provide AVC bias voltage.

The '''Wyndham Important Bird Area''' comprises a 28&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; tract of land in the north-east of the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley region]] of [[Western Australia]].  The site lies in the Bastion Hills close to the town of [[Wyndham, Western Australia|Wyndham]], a port on the West Arm of the [[Cambridge Gulf]].  It is an important site for [[Gouldian finch]]es.

==Description==
The site is characterised by gently sloping ranges, vegetated with [[Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|tropical savanna woodlands and grasslands]], with [[sandstone]] outcrops.  The woodland has a high density of [[tree hollow|cavity]]-bearing [[Old-growth forest|old-growth]] [[eucalypt]]s suitable as finch nest-sites; the grassland provides food for the birds; and the proximity of Wyndham provides reliable sources of drinking water.  The area has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] with a mean minimum temperature of 17°C in July, a mean maximum of 40°C in November, with the mean annual rainfall of 780&amp;nbsp;mm falling mainly from November to March.&lt;ref&gt;BirdLife International.

==Birds==
The site has been identified as an [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA) by [[BirdLife International]] because it supports the largest known population of [[endangered]] Gouldian finches.  It also contains populations of, [[northern rosella]]s, [[white-gaped honeyeater|white-gaped]], [[yellow-tinted honeyeater|yellow-tinted]] and [[bar-breasted honeyeater]]s, [[silver-crowned friarbird]]s, [[masked finch|masked]] and [[long-tailed finch]]es and [[yellow-rumped munia]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birdata.com.au/iba.vm |title=IBA: Wyndham |accessdate=2011-12-02 |work=Birdata |first= |last= |publisher=Birds Australia |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706102341/http://www.birdata.com.au/iba.vm |archivedate=July 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Finch trapping ==
Eleven ''Estrildidae'' finch in the Family ''Ploceidae'' are distributed in the Kimberley region of Western Australia.  Commercial finch trapping in the Kimberley, principally around Wyndham, commenced in 1897.  By 1901 finches were trapped around Wyndham and shipped overseas to Europe in consignments of approximately 5,000 by the persons trapping them. All Kimberley finches were partially or fully protected from 1902  under the Western Australian ''Game Act, 1892.''  Commonwealth Customs regulations first introduced in 1911 failed to curb large scale exports by private finch traders until 1932.  One of the largest commercial traders of wild caught Kimberley finches in the late 1920s and 1930s was the South Perth Zoo which exploited customs' law to export for 'scientific and educational purposes'.  Licenses to trap finches in the Kimberley were first issued in or after 1913 and continued until 15 November 1986 when finch trapping was banned by [[Barry Hodge]], the environment minister.  Trapping of certain finches ceased before 1986: the yellow-rumped mannikin after 15 November 1975 because of its scarcity; the zebra finch after 15 November 1981 because sufficient numbers were sourced from breeding stocks; and the Gouldian finch after 15 November 1981 because of its decline in numbers.  Customs regulations in 1960 prohibited the export of live Australian fauna for commercial purposes and strict standards were applied to exports of specimens of native fauna for scientific research or zoological display.  In 1971 Australia became a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and in 1976 Australia introduced the Customs (Endangered Species) Regulations to enforce import and export of species covered by CITES.&lt;ref&gt;Finch Trapping in the Kimberley, K H Coate and L H Merritt (2015){{ISBN|978-0-85905-621-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
