"'''A Nice Place to Visit'''" is  episode 28 of the American television anthology series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''. The episode first aired on CBS on April 15, 1960. The title comes from the saying, "A nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there."

In 1965, a slightly modified version of this story was broadcast on the radio program ''Theater Five''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/OTRR_Theater_Five_Singles|title=Theater Five - Single Episodes|first=|last=Old Time Radio Researchers Group|publisher=|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Land of Milk and Honey", episode number 154, retained all of the important aspects of this episode, including the innuendos and the surprise ending. On November 14, 1935, the radio program ''[[The Fleischmann's Yeast Hour]]'' hosted by [[Rudy Vallee]] broadcast a play titled ''The Other Place'' starring [[Colin Clive]] and [[Leo G. Carroll]]. It was written by [[John L. Balderston|John Balderston]] and dealt with a similar theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldhollywoodincolor.com/tag/boris-karloff/|title=Boris Karloff - OLD HOLLYWOOD IN COLOR|website=oldhollywoodincolor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twilightzonevortex.blogspot.ca/2012/04/nice-place-to-visit.html|title="A Nice Place to Visit"|website=twilightzonevortex.blogspot.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opening narration==
{{Pull quote|Portrait of a man at work, the only work he's ever done, the only work he knows. His name is Henry Francis Valentine, but he calls himself "Rocky", because that's the way his life has been – rocky and perilous and uphill at a dead run all the way. He's tired now, tired of running or wanting, of waiting for the breaks that come to others but never to him, never to Rocky Valentine. A scared, angry little man. He thinks it's all over now but he's wrong. For Rocky Valentine, it's just the beginning.}}

==Plot==
After robbing a [[pawn shop]], Henry Francis "Rocky" Valentine ([[Larry Blyden]]) is shot by a police officer as he tries to flee. He wakes up to find himself seemingly unharmed by the encounter as a genial elderly man named Pip ([[Sebastian Cabot (actor)|Sebastian Cabot]]) greets him. Pip explains that he has been instructed to guide Rocky and give him whatever he desires. Rocky becomes suspicious, thinking that Pip is trying to swindle him, but Pip proves to have detailed information on Rocky's tastes and hobbies. Rocky demands that Pip hand over his wallet; Pip says that he does not carry one, but gives Rocky $700 directly from his pocket and says that he can provide as much money as Rocky wants.

Thinking that Pip is trying to entice him to commit a crime, Rocky holds him at gunpoint as the two travel to a luxurious apartment. Pip explains that the apartment and everything in it are free, and Rocky starts to relax. However, his suspicions rise up again when a meal is brought in, and demands that Pip taste it first to prove it isn't poisoned. When Pip demurs, claiming he hasn't eaten for centuries, Rocky shoots him in the head, but sees that the bullets have no effect. Rocky realizes that he is dead, and he believes that he is in Heaven and Pip is his [[guardian angel]].

Rocky visits a [[casino]], winning every bet he makes as beautiful girls gather around him, and enjoys being able to torment a policeman after Pip shrinks him. Later, Rocky asks Pip if he can see some of his old friends who have also died, but Pip says that this world is for Rocky alone. Except for the two men, no one in it is real. When Rocky wonders what good deeds he could have done to gain entrance to Heaven, Pip takes him to visit the Hall of Records. Rocky looks through his own file and discovers that it only contains a list of his sins, but decides not to worry about it because God apparently has no problem with him being in Heaven.

One month later, Rocky has become bored with having his whims instantly satisfied. He calls Pip and asks for a challenge in which he might run the risk of losing. Pip offers to set up a bank robbery, but Rocky abandons the idea, saying that a pre-planned outcome would take the fun out of the crime. He then tells Pip that he is tired of Heaven and wants to go to "[[hell|the other place]]," to which Pip retorts, "Heaven? Whatever gave you the idea you were in Heaven, Mr. Valentine? This ''is'' the other place!" Horrified, Rocky tries in vain to open the now-locked apartment door and escape his "paradise" as Pip laughs malevolently at his torment.

==Closing narration==

==Production==
[[Mickey Rooney]] was the first choice to play Valentine. In a memo to [[Rod Serling]], Charles Beaumont suggested, should Rooney not be available, that Serling consider playing the part. Serling declined and Rooney became unavailable. (He guest starred in [[The Last Night of a Jockey|a later episode]].)&lt;ref name="zicree"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Twilight Zone Companion|last=Zicree|first=Marc Scott|publisher=Silman James|edition=second|isbn=1-879505-09-6|year=1989|location=Hollywood|pages=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guest star Cabot had to bleach his hair white for the role; it took three months for the actor's hair to return to its original dark color.&lt;ref name="zicree"/&gt;

One version of this episode has Valentine throwing an apple at a table which changes into a pool table – although another version has this scene cut.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

"A Nice Place to Visit" was singled out for its brazen sexual innuendo. [[Standards &amp; Practices|Program Practices]] requested that Valentine not refer to a girl as "a broad [...] really stacked", even though the crudity was essential to establishing the unsavory qualities of the character. Nor could the protagonist refer to a party as "a ball" because that word had more than one meaning. In another sequence, a voluptuous young lady tends to Valentine's every need, then says "is there anything else I can do for you?" CBS's comment: "Please be certain that the girl's third speech be delivered in a sweet manner, as described."&lt;ref&gt;Erikson,Hal(October 1985). "Censorship: Another Dimension Behind the Twilight Zone", ''[[The Twilight Zone Magazine]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
[[Elliott Murphy]] alludes to this episode in the song "Sacrifice" from his album ''Unreal City''. The lyrics to the song's bridge are as follows: "On TV was a petty thief shot by the police, he came to in Las Vegas in a penthouse suite, he had a magic butler gave him all that he desired, a feast of wine and women 'til his passions were expired. He couldn't understand why a crook like him had died and gone to heaven when his life was full of sin, and when he shot pool and every ball quickly fell, he saw his butler was the devil and the penthouse was in hell."

The unreleased [[They Might Be Giants]] song "Hell Hotel" is based on "A Nice Place to Visit". According to producer Bill Krauss, the song references the episode's plot and lead actor Sebastian Cabot.&lt;ref&gt;Weiskopf, Myke (1996). "Early Years Handbook". TMBG.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Trump]] has said that this episode of ''The Twilight Zone'' inspired his philosophy of success, commenting, "I fight hard for victory, and I think I enjoy it as much as I ever did. But I realize that maybe new victories won't be the same as the first couple."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/election-2016/watch-donald-trumps-philosophy-success-was-inspired-twilight-zone-episode|title=Watch: Donald Trump's Philosophy on Success Was Inspired by a 'Twilight Zone' Episode|first=Alexandra|last=Rosenmann|date=6 May 2016|publisher=|via=AlterNet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Barrett, ''The Deals and the Downfall''. New York: Harper Collins, 1992, pp. 31-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

This episode is referenced in two episodes of ''[[The Sopranos]]''. In "[[Chasing It]]", this episode is explicitly mentioned when it is described to Tony Soprano. In the episode "[[Kennedy and Heidi]]", Tony Soprano visits Las Vegas and basically lives the episode, having an unprecedented string of success with gambling, drugs, and women.

In the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode "[[I Dated a Robot]]", a parody of the ''Twilight Zone'' called ''The Scary Door'' mimics this episode by having a gambler who always wins. He realizes quickly that he must be in hell. A character similar to Pip arrives, only for the episode to suddenly shift to the plots of "[[Nightmare at 20,000 Feet]]" and "[[The Man in the Bottle]]".

The plot of the 1979 pornographic film ''For the Love of Pleasure,'' starring Jamie Gillis and Annette Haven, is a broad rewrite of this episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adultdvdtalk.com/review/for-the-love-of-pleasure|title=For the Love Of Pleasure Movie Review by Oddobsessionmovies - Adult DVD Talk - Porn Movie Shopping Guide|website=www.adultdvdtalk.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot of ''[[The Good Place]]'' is essentially a greatly expanded version of this episode.

}}First Lieutenant '''Alejandro Bello Silva''' (1887 &amp;ndash; c. 1914) was a [[Chile]]an [[aviator]] who [[List of aerial disappearances|disappeared]] during his qualifying flight for certification as a military pilot.

==Biography==
The third of four sons of José Maria Bello (the son of [[Andrés Bello]]) and Ana Rosa Silva, Bello lived in [[Ancud]], Chile as a child, due to his father's banishment after the [[1891 Chilean Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Van Hare"&gt;{{cite web|last=Van Hare|first=Thomas|title=More Lost Than Lieutenant Bello|url=http://fly.historicwings.com/2013/03/more-lost-than-lieutenant-bello/|work=www.historicwings.com|accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disappearance===
In the pre-dawn hours of 9 March 1914, Lieutenant Bello was in the [[Lo Espejo]] aerodrome, where he was to take an examination to earn the designation Military Pilot. Bello and two companions had to complete the circuit from Lo Espejo to [[Culitrín]], to [[Cartagena, Chile|Cartagena]], and back to Lo Espejo, in the central region of Chile, in order to pass the exam.&lt;ref name="Van Hare" /&gt; The total distance of the flight was 111 miles, and should have taken two hours to complete.&lt;ref name="Van Hare" /&gt;

[[Image:Teniente Bello(3).jpg|thumb|300px|left|Bello in his aircraft]]

On the first attempt, the aviators had to return to base due to near-zero visibility caused by heavy [[fog]].&lt;ref name="Van Hare" /&gt; Bello damaged his aircraft during the landing, and switched to an {{convert|80|hp}} [[Sánchez-Besa]] [[biplane]] (tail number 13, nicknamed "[[Manuel Rodríguez Erdoíza|Manuel Rodríguez]]") for the second attempt.&lt;ref name="Van Hare" /&gt; He took off together with one companion and the instructor, who had to make an emergency landing for refueling. Nevertheless, Bello continued his route and was lost among the clouds.&lt;ref name="Van Hare" /&gt;

===Search===
Search efforts were initiated the very day Bello disappeared. Several people claimed to have seen the aircraft land or crash, but these sightings were unsubstantiated.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Various theories proposed at the time suggested that Bello had crashed into the sea or that the wrecked craft would be found in a mountain pass. Several expeditions were launched to locate a crash site, including one as recently as 1988, but no traces were found either of Lieutenant Bello or of the plane he was piloting.&lt;ref name="Van Hare" /&gt;

On 28 November 2007 an expedition set out for the [[Communes of Chile|commune]] of [[San Antonio, Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Alejandra Cristi|title=Restos podrían ser del avión del 'teniente Bello'|trans-title=Debris may be from Lieutenant Bello's aircraft|work=Publimetro|date=6 December 2007|page=16|url=http://publimetrodigital.bluecompany.cl/diario/?pagina=16&amp;day=2007-12-06|language=Spanish}}{{Dead link|date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://megagalerias.terra.cl/megagalerias/informativas/index.cfm?idmg=26850 |title=Expedicionarios buscan restos del teniente Bello |trans-title=Expedition members search for the remains of Lieutenant Bello |work=Terra |language=Spanish |accessdate=2009-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110085234/http://megagalerias.terra.cl/megagalerias/informativas/index.cfm?idmg=26850 |archivedate=January 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two metal fragments belonging to an aircraft were found in the Cuncumén hills.

Jaime González Colville, of the [[Chilean Academy of History]], considered it very unlikely that the remains of Lieutenant Bello should be found near Cuncumén.&lt;ref&gt;Jaime González Colville, "Teniente Bello", [[El Mercurio]], 6 December 2007, Maps section, page A-2.

==Lieutenant Bello in popular culture==
* In Chile, the expression {{lang|es|más perdido que el Teniente Bello}} ("''more lost than Lieutenant Bello''") is usually used to express one being lost, (''ando mas perdido que el teniente bello'') or to express that someone is lost, (''andas mas perdido que el teniente bello'').
* In 1945, Chilean journalist and author [[Hugo Silva (journalist)|Hugo Silva]] published the novel ''[[Pacha Pulai]]'' blending the story of Alejandro Bello with the legend of the [[City of the Caesars]], which dates from Chile's colonial times.&lt;!-- Both Pacha Pulai and Hugo Silva have articles on the Spanish Wikipedia.  --&gt;
* Mentioned in an episode of ''[[Diego and Glot]]'', "Super Family", voiced by [[Don Francisco (television host)|Don Francisco]].
* His figure is used in the science fiction short story "The Prisoner" from the anthology ''Alucinaciones.TXT: Nueva antología de cuentos de literatura fantástica chilena'' ({{ISBN|978-956-8648-02-2}}). From that story later derives the novel ''The Shadow of Fire: The Final Flight of Lt. Bello''. Also listed as a fictional character in other tales such as ''CHIL3: Relación del Reyno'' and the graphic novel ''1899'', which also blends elements of ''Pacha Pulai''.

==Personal life==
Koenig, a [[Veganism|vegan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-02-26/entertainment/ct-0227-andrew-koenig-pardo-cancels-20100226_1_brother-in-law-andrew-koenig-cancels |title=Andrew Koenig's brother-in-law cancels Chicago comedy shows |work=Chicago Tribune |date=February 26, 2010 |accessdate=February 27, 2010| archiveurl= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-02-26/entertainment/ct-0227-andrew-koenig-pardo-cancels-20100226_1_brother-in-law-andrew-koenig-cancels| archivedate= February 28, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; traveled to [[Burma]] in July 2007 and visited Burmese [[refugee camp]]s in Thailand with his father as part of the [[U.S. Campaign for Burma]]. The following January, he protested the [[Communist Party of China]]'s political and financial support of the [[military dictatorship]] in Burma during the 119th [[Rose Parade|Tournament of Roses]] in [[Pasadena, California]]; after a pre-parade human rights march agreed to by parade officials was allegedly stifled by them, he entered the parade and stood in front of a Chinese float promoting the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Koenig, who carried a sign reading "China: Free Burma" in both English and Chinese, was arrested and briefly held for his act of [[civil disobedience]]. Koenig's defense attorney was [[Bill Paparian]], a fellow protester and former mayor of Pasadena.&lt;ref name="pasadenaweekly1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pasadenaweekly.com/cms/story/detail/ready_for_a_fight/5735/ |title=Ready for a fight |publisher=Pasadena Weekly |accessdate=February 26, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100206161757/http://www.pasadenaweekly.com/cms/story/detail/ready_for_a_fight/5735/| archivedate= February 6, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"China sits on the UN Security Council and they have refused to condemn Burma. China purchases gas from Burma and sells them weapons that the military uses on the Burmese people. So they are really quite complicit, and that was the whole point of protesting the China float," Koenig explained.&lt;ref name="pasadenaweekly1" /&gt; Koenig also noted the Chinese government's implicit support of [[genocide|genocidal]] forces in [[Sudan]], [[sweatshop]]s and tainted export products, saying of the float, "China is putting on a good face because of the Olympics, but [it's time to] send a message to the Chinese government that they have to not just change their face, but change the way they do things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pasadenaweekly.com/cms/story/detail/?id=5514&amp;IssueNum=105 |title=Cops pop 'Boner' |publisher=Pasadena Weekly |accessdate=February 26, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522212533/http://www.pasadenaweekly.com/cms/story/detail/?id=5514&amp;IssueNum=105 |archivedate=May 22, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Pasadena Weekly'' quoted Koenig as stating, "Their free speech rights have been totally censored. As a country with a Constitution and a Bill of Rights, we need to continue to support and enforce ours, and [use it to] recognize the rights of human beings all over the world."&lt;ref name="pasadenaweekly1" /&gt;

===Death===
Koenig was last seen in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], on February 14, 2010 and missed a scheduled flight on February 16, which was the last day he used his cell phone or conducted any banking.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Nancy (February 24, 2010).

'''''Aqua Vita''''' (renamed '''''Aquatopia''''' in the North American market) is an interactive virtual aquarium developed by [[SCE London Studio]] in association with [[Playlogic Entertainment]] for the [[PlayStation 3]] platform, which utilizes the [[PlayStation Eye]] camera peripheral. It was released on the European [[PlayStation Store]] on October 25, 2007 and appeared on the North American PlayStation Store on November 20, 2007.

== Gameplay ==
It is the first title in a series of "[[interactive art]]" software requiring a connected PlayStation Eye. The player uses their own fingers to feed the tropical salt water fishes (food will drop) or to virtually touch the water surface with their hands. As a [[life simulation game]], the fishes interact with the motion sensitive camera and between themselves, also the vegetation moves with the current.

== Fish species ==
By default the aquarium's fishes are selected at random with all kind of species, however by pressing the Start button, the player has the ability to choose them.

It is possible to select a single species (each one with its own character: small ones are energetic and gregarious, biggest are generally calm and lone) to mix them or even to not include fish at all and leave the aquarium with only corals and the resident red-knobbed [[sea star]].

== Remote Play ==
''Aqua Vita'' is compatible with the [[Remote Play]] function and as such can run on an activated [[PlayStation Portable]] through a [[wi-fi]] connection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="970">The '''archinephros''' is a primitive kidney that has been retained by the larvae of [[hagfish]] and some [[caecilians]]. It also occurs in the [[embryos]] of [[higher animals]] as the simplest kind of excretory organ. The archinephros is nonfunctional in humans and other [[mammals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Archinephros |url=http://wordinfo.info/results/archinephros |website=WordInfo |accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three types of mature [[vertebrate]] kidneys develop from the archinephros: the [[pronephros]] from the front section, the [[mesonephros]] from the mid-section and the [[metanephros]] from the rear section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Archinephros |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/archinephros |website=ENCYCLOPÆDIA BRITANNICA |accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Andrew "Andy" Williams''' (born February 8, 1986) is a convicted murderer who, as a 15-year-old, perpetrated the shooting at [[Santana High School]] on March 5, 2001. In the shooting, two students were killed and 13 others were wounded. Williams is currently serving [[life in prison]] with the possibility of parole after 50 years.

==Early years==
Known by his family as "Andrew" or "Andy" for short and born in [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]], [[Maryland]] on February 8, 1986, he was the first born child of Jeff and Linda Williams. Andy has one half brother, Michael. In the summer of 2000, Jeff and Linda separated. Jeff and Andy moved to [[California]] in the fall. Williams attended [[Santana High School]] in [[Santee, California]], where he was [[bullying|bullied]] by fellow students.&lt;ref name="ABCNews"&gt;{{cite web|title=2 Dead, 13 Hurt in Calif. School Shooting|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=92482&amp;page=1&amp;singlePage=true|publisher=ABC News|date=March 5, 2001|accessdate=May 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began to spend time with a crowd of [[skateboard]]ers.  Williams was accepted within this peer group; however, at times these individuals also bullied him.

Weeks before the shooting, Williams attempted to speak with a school counselor, but was instructed to return to class because the office was full at the time. As the semester unfolded and the abuse continued, friends came to believe that Williams had just reached a tipping point and mentioned he "didn't want to live anymore", which resulted in more name-calling and threats of bullying.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=132072&amp;page=1 EXCLUSIVE: Santana School Shooter]&lt;/ref&gt; By early 2001, Williams seemed to believe that his problems would not resolve themselves. The Friday before the shooting, Williams and classmates reported that his drama teacher humiliated him in front of the class during an acting exercise, which he perceived as an abusive setup.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"/&gt; Williams spoke on two occasions of his plan to "pull a [[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine]]" at Santana High School, but no reports were ever made of these threats to the school. He also made plans to get on top of the school's roof so that he could hit people more easily. The friends he informed were asked to leave the school.&lt;ref name="mourns"&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Mourns Lives Lost In School Shooting|url=http://www.thesandiegochannel.com/sand/news/stories/news-52723920010306-140327.html|publisher=KGTV|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010309185604/http://www.thesandiegochannel.com/sand/news/stories/news-52723920010306-140327.html|archivedate=March 9, 2001|date=March 7, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first occasion was a week before the shooting, the second during the weekend prior to March 5.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

He took his father's [[Weihrauch#Revolvers|Arminius]] [[.22 LR|.22 caliber]] long-rifle double action [[revolver]] from the locked gun cabinet in their apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Portner|first=Jessica|title=How kids get guns|url=http://www0.mercurycenter.com/local/education/docs/gun29.htm|newspaper=San Jose Mercury News|date=April 29, 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010807205557/http://www0.mercurycenter.com/local/education/docs/gun29.htm|archivedate=August 7, 2001|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his arrest, he told investigators that he was "tired of being bullied."  On the way to juvenile hall, Williams said that he did it because he was dared to by his friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WARNING: Andy Williams here. Unhappy kid.

On Monday, March 5, 2001 at 9:20&amp;nbsp;a.m., 15-year-old Williams entered a boys' bathroom at Santana High School with a loaded .22-caliber revolver taken from his father’s locked gun cabinet and fatally shot a freshman.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jacobson|first1=Rebecca|title=School Shooter: 'My Grand Plan Was Suicide by Cop'|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/science-jan-june13-andywilliams_02-18/|accessdate=25 June 2016|work=PBS|publisher=NewsHour Productions LLC.|date=February 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then left the bathroom and began firing the revolver indiscriminately at other students, killing another. According to one witness, Williams repeatedly walked out of the bathroom, fired shots, then went back into the bathroom.  The scene soon turned chaotic as students and teachers ducked or scrambled to safety. Minutes later  the school was on lock-down.  Williams reloaded his revolver at least once. A student teacher, Tim Estes, and Campus Security Supervisor, Peter Ruiz, walked into the bathroom to investigate what Ruiz thought may be the sound of firecrackers. Upon entering the restroom Ruiz was shot once in the shoulder by Williams. As Estes and Ruiz turned to run,  
Ruiz was hit in the back by two more bullets and Estes was hit in the back by a bullet that exited through his abdomen. Williams was often seen smiling throughout the entire shooting. Two off-duty police officers who were visiting the school were alerted to the shooting; however, they were at different ends of the school.  One of them approached the bathroom and called for backup.  Police officers quickly arrived and charged the bathroom; they discovered Williams kneeling on the floor with the weapon in his hands. He wanted to kill himself, but was unable to. He told officers that he was by himself. In the end he shot 15 people, two of whom died.&lt;ref name=stunned&gt;{{cite web|title=San Diego Community Stunned By School Shooting|url=http://www.thesandiegochannel.com/sand/news/stories/news-52409720010305-110346.html|publisher=KGTV|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010308054023/http://www.thesandiegochannel.com/sand/news/stories/news-52409720010305-110346.html|archivedate=March 8, 2001|date=March 6, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams surrendered and was taken into custody. The two students that were killed were 14-year-old '''Bryan Zuckor''' and 17-year-old '''Randy Gordon'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Santana High School Shooting Victims|url=http://www.thesandiegochannel.com/sand/news/stories/news-52880120010306-190310.html|publisher=KGTV|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010309185029/http://www.thesandiegochannel.com/sand/news/stories/news-52880120010306-190310.html|archivedate=March 9, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eleven students and two school supervisors suffered gunshot wounds and were treated at either [[University of California, San Diego Medical Center]] or Children's Hospital. The San Diego [[SWAT]] team was called to "assess and clear" the scene of the shooting.&lt;ref name="ABCNews"/&gt;

==Reactions==
In Washington, the [[President of the United States]], [[George W. Bush]], offered his condolences "to the teachers and the children whose lives have been turned upside-down right now."
Bush called the shooting "a disgraceful act of cowardice," adding, "When America teaches our children right from wrong and teaches values that respect life in our country, we'll be better off." But, he said, "First things are first. And our prayers go out to the families that lost a child today."&lt;ref name="cnn2001-03-05"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/US/03/05/school.shooting.07/|title=Suspect had talked about shooting at school|date=March 5, 2001|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[California Governor]] [[Gray Davis]] also said he was "shocked and deeply saddened" by the shooting. Davis' wife [[Sharon Davis|Sharon]] is a Santana High School graduate.&lt;ref name="cnn2001-03-05" /&gt;

The [[nu metal]] band [[Linkin Park]], whom Williams was a fan of, were seen as an influence to Williams in shooting. They released a statement saying "Like everyone else, we are extremely saddened by these events and our hearts go out to the families and friends to the victims."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nme.com/news/music/linkin-park-120-1388670&lt;/ref&gt; Williams had written a note to his father prior to the shooting: "I tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end it doesn't really matter." The line was an excerpt from the band's song [[In the End]].

The [[Christian rock]] band [[P.O.D.]] wrote their song "[[Youth of the Nation]]" after the band was on their way to recording their then upcoming studio album, ''[[Satellite (P.O.D. album)|Satellite]]'', where they were stopped in traffic during the incident. Guitarist [[Marcos Curiel]] was interviewed in 2008 and described the event as so:
:"We were rehearsing and writing ''Satellite'' a couple of blocks away from the school. One day on the way to the studio, there were all these helicopters and cars speeding by. We really didn’t know what was going on. When we got to the studio, this guy had the news on, and he was like, ‘This kid just went and started blasting fools.’ So we started jamming, and that rhythm just naturally came out then [[Wuv Bernardo|Wuv]] [Bernardo, drummer] put that drumbeat on it, and the song was born." 

Ever since the incident, Santana High has hired police to come and watch over the school. The school also holds an event for the students on the anniversary of the  shooting.

== Imprisonment ==
On June 20, 2002, Williams pleaded guilty to all charges against him in an effort to avoid trial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tech.mit.edu/V121/N10/shoot_.10w.html Teen stands accused of murder]&lt;/ref&gt;  On August 15, 2002, a California judge sentenced Williams, as an adult, to 50 years to [[Life imprisonment|life]] in prison, and ordered him to serve his time in the Youth Offender Program at CCI, Tehachapi (since closed) until his 18th birthday, at which time he would be transferred to an adult prison. Williams was given credit for the 529 days that he had served in [[juvenile hall]], fined $10,000 and ordered to pay restitution to the Victims Restitution Fund.  At his sentencing, Williams apologized and expressed remorse for his actions.  On March 1, 2004, he was transferred to an adult prison.

In an interview with "NOVA: Mind of a Rampage Killer", Williams admitted to being suicidal for several months before the shooting. He described his 15-year-old life as tumultuous, describing the pain of his parent's recent divorce, his jolting move across the country from Maryland to California, and death of a friend. His description of his mental state was "Numb", adding that he didn't realize people would die, but he wanted to "Make a lot of noise and then the cops would show up." He admitted that his real plan was to commit [[suicide by cop]], however he "changed his mind at the last minute, dropped his revolver and surrendered."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/science-jan-june13-afternewtown_02-20/ Looking within the mind of a rampage killer]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'brien|first1=Miles|title=Mind of a Rampage Killer — NOVA {{!}} PBS|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/body/mind-rampage-killer.html|accessdate=25 June 2016|work=www.pbs.org|publisher=PBS Online|date=February 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently there are [[Grassroots democracy|grass-root]] efforts to have Williams' sentence reduced.  His supporters argue that the judge was too harsh in sentencing Williams as an adult and did not take into consideration Williams' age at the time of his offense.  They would like to see Williams get a retrial, but as a juvenile, which would have meant confinement by the [[California Youth Authority]] until age 25.  The California  State Attorney General's office handled a total of six appeals filed by Williams supporters, four to the Court of Appeals and two to the California State Supreme Court. The district court denied his petition in September 2010 and the case is now on appeal to the 9th Circuit, according to the California Attorney General's Office.&lt;ref name="SanteePatch"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Perez |first1=Steve (Open Post)|title=Where is the Santana Shooter Now?|url=http://patch.com/california/santee/where-is-the-santana-shooter-now|accessdate=25 June 2016|publisher=Patch Media|date=March 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams is currently incarcerated at Valley State Prison in [[Chowchilla, California]].  He will be eligible for parole in March 2025.&lt;ref&gt;https://inmatelocator.cdcr.ca.gov/Details.aspx?ID=T43070&lt;/ref&gt; He will be 39 years old.

'''Douglas Robertson Bisset''' (25 May 1908- 2000), was a Scottish sculptor, best known for his works in the city of [[Glasgow]] and for several notable portrait busts.&lt;ref name="ScotAA"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter J.M.

{{Red Summer}}

The '''Elaine massacre''', began on September 30–October 1, 1919 at Hoop Spur in the vicinity of [[Elaine, Arkansas|Elaine]] in rural [[Phillips County, Arkansas]]. With an estimated 100 to 237 blacks killed, along with five white men, it is considered the deadliest race riot in the state and one of the deadliest racial conflicts in all of United States history.&lt;ref name="AKenc"/&gt;

Because of the widespread white mob attacks on blacks during this period of racial terrorism of black citizens, in 2015 the [[Bryan Stevenson|Equal Justice Initiative]] of Montgomery, Alabama classified the black deaths as [[Lynchings in the United States|lynchings]] in their report on lynching of African Americans in the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/10/us/history-of-lynchings-in-the-south-documents-nearly-4000-names.html|title=History of Lynchings in the South Documents Nearly 4,000 Names|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 10, 2015|first=Campbell|last=Robertson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most historians classify the race riot as a different kind of criminal action than the targeted nature of lynchings of one or a few persons.&lt;ref name="AKenc"/&gt;

Located in the [[Arkansas Delta]], Phillips County had been historically developed for cotton [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]]s, and was worked by African-American slaves before the Civil War. In the early 20th century the population was still overwhelmingly black, as most freedmen and their descendants had stayed as farm workers and [[sharecroppers]]. African Americans outnumbered whites in the area around Elaine by a ten-to-one ratio, and by three-to-one in the county overall.&lt;ref name="AKenc"/&gt; White landowners controlled the economy, selling cotton on their own schedule, running high-priced plantation stores where farmers had to buy seed and supplies, and settling accounts with sharecroppers in lump sums, without listing items.&lt;ref name="AKenc"/&gt;

The [[Progressive Farmers and Household Union of America]] had organized chapters in the Elaine area in 1918-19. On September 29, representatives met with about 100 black farmers at a church near Elaine to discuss how to obtain fairer settlements from landowners. Whites had resisted union organizing by the farmers and often spied on or disrupted such meetings. In a confrontation at the church, a county deputy was shot and killed, and another white man wounded.

The county sheriff organized a [[Posse comitatus|posse]], and whites gathered to put down what was rumored as a "black insurrection".&lt;ref name="AKenc"/&gt; Other whites entered Phillips County to join the action, making a mob of 500 to 1000. They attacked blacks on sight across the county. The governor called in 500 federal troops, who arrested nearly 260 blacks and were accused of killing some. Over a three-day period, fatalities included an 100-240 blacks, with some estimates of more than 800, as well as five white men. The events have been subject to debate, especially the total of black deaths.&lt;ref name="AKenc"/&gt;

The only men prosecuted for these events were 122 African Americans, with 73 charged with murder. Twelve were quickly convicted and sentenced to death by [[all-white juries]] for murder of the white deputy at the church. Others were convicted of lesser charges and sentenced to prison. During appeals, the death penalty cases were separated. Six convictions (known as the Ware defendants) were overturned at the state level for technical trial details. These six defendants were retried in 1920 and convicted again, but on appeal the State Supreme Court overturned the verdicts, based on violations of the [[Due Process Clause]] and the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]], due to exclusion of blacks from the juries. The lower courts failed to retry the men within the two years required by Arkansas law, and the defense finally gained their release in 1923.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt;

The six other death penalty [[Moore v. Dempsey|cases]] (known as Moore et al.) ultimately reached the [[United States Supreme Court]]. The Court overturned the convictions in the ''[[Moore v. Dempsey]]'' (1923) ruling. Grounds were the failure of the trial court to provide due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, as the trials had been dominated by adverse publicity and the presence of armed white mobs threatening the jury. This was a critical precedent for the "Supreme Court's strengthening of the requirements the Due Process Clause imposes on the conduct of state criminal trials."&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/40022483?loginSuccess=true&amp;seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents  Walter L. Brown, "Reviewed Work: ''A Mob Intent on Death: The NAACP and the Arkansas Riot Cases'' by Richard C. Cortner"], ''The Arkansas Historical Quarterly'' Vol. 48, No. 3 (Autumn, 1989), pp. 289-91, via JSTOR; accessed February 13, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[NAACP]] assisted the defendants in the appeals process, raising money to hire a defense team, which it helped direct. When the cases were remanded to the state court, the six 'Moore' defendants settled with the lower court on lesser charges and were sentenced to time already served. Governor [[Thomas Chipman McRae]] freed these six men in 1925 in the closing days of his administration. The NAACP helped them leave the state safely.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt;

==Background==
{{History of Arkansas}}
With Phillips County developed for cotton [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]]s in the antebellum era, its population was overwhelmingly black and descended from slaves: in Phillips County, African Americans outnumbered whites by a ten-to-one ratio. In the [[Arkansas Delta]] around the time of the [[World War I|Great War]], most black farmers were [[sharecroppers]] and illiterate, as were many poor whites.

The Democratic-dominated legislature had [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised most blacks]] and many poor whites in the 1890s by creating barriers to voter registration. It excluded them from the political system via the more complicated Election Law of 1891 and a [[poll tax]] amendment passed in 1892. The white-dominated legislature enacted [[Jim Crow]] laws that established racial segregation and institutionalized Democratic efforts to impose white supremacy. The decades around the turn of the century were the period of the highest rate of [[lynchings]] across the South.

{{quote|Sharecropping, the African Americans had been having trouble in getting settlements for the cotton they raised on land owned by whites.  Both the Negroes and the white owners were to share the profits when the crop was sold for the year.  Between the time of planting and selling, the sharecroppers took up food, clothing, and necessities at excessive prices from the plantation store owned by the planter.|sign=O.A. Rogers, Jr.,  President of the [[Arkansas Baptist College]] in [[Little Rock]]|source=''Arkansas Historical Quarterly'', Summer 1960 issue}}

The landowner sold the crop whenever and however he saw fit.  At the time of settlement, landowners generally never gave an itemized statement to the black sharecroppers of accounts owed, nor details of the money received for cotton and seed. The farmers were disadvantaged as many were illiterate. It was an unwritten law of the cotton country that the sharecroppers could not quit and leave a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] until their debts were paid. The period of the year around accounts settlement was frequently the time of most [[lynchings]] of blacks throughout the South, especially if economic times were poor. As an example, many Negroes in Phillips County, whose cotton was sold in October 1918, did not get a settlement before July of the following year. They often amassed considerable debt at the plantation store before that time, as they had to buy supplies, including seed, to start the next season.

Black farmers began to organize in 1919 to try to negotiate better conditions, including fair accounting and timely payment of monies due them by white landowners. [[Robert Lee Hill|Robert L. Hill]], a black farmer from [[Winchester, Arkansas]], had founded the [[Progressive Farmers and Household Union of America]]. He worked with farmers throughout Phillips County. Its purpose was "to obtain better payments for their cotton crops from the [[Plantations in the American South|white plantation owners]] who dominated the area during the [[Jim Crow]] era. Black sharecroppers were often exploited in their efforts to collect payment for their cotton crops."&lt;ref name="AKenc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?search=1&amp;entryID=1102#|title=Elaine Massacre|publisher=Encyclopedia of Arkansas|accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whites tried to disrupt such organizing and threatened farmers.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt; The union had hired a white law firm in the capital of Little Rock to represent the black farmers in getting fair settlements for their 1919 cotton crops before they were taken away for sale. The firm was headed by Ulysses S. Bratton, a native of [[Searcy County, Arkansas|Searcy County]] and former assistant federal district attorney.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt;

The postwar summer of 1919 had already been marked by [[Red Summer (1919)|deadly race riots]] against black Americans in more than three dozen cities across the country, including [[Chicago]], [[Knoxville]], [[Washington, DC]], and [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. Competition for jobs and housing in crowded markets following World War I as veterans returned to society resulted in outbreaks of racial violence, usually of ethnic whites against blacks. Having served their country in the Great War, African-American veterans resisted racial discrimination and violence. In 1919 blacks vigorously fought back when their communities were attacked. Labor unrest and strikes took place in several cities as workers tried to organize. As industries hired blacks as strikebreakers in some cities, worker resentment against them increased.&lt;ref name="AKenc"/&gt;

==Events==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2017}}
Approximately 100 [[African-American]] farmers, led by [[Robert Lee Hill|Robert L. Hill]], the founder of the [[Progressive Farmers and Household Union of America]], met at a church in Hoop Spur, near Elaine in Phillips County. Union advocates brought armed guards to protect the meeting. When two deputized white men and a black trustee arrived at the church, shots were exchanged. Railroad Policeman W.D. Adkins, employed by the [[Missouri Pacific Railroad]] was killed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odmp.org/officer/22191-special-agent-william-allen-adkins ODMP memorial W.D. Adkins]&lt;/ref&gt; and the other white man wounded; it was never determined who shot first.

According to ''Revolution in the Land: Southern Agriculture in the 20th Century'' (2002), in a section called "The Changing Face of Sharecropping and Tenancy":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historicaltextarchive.com/books.php?op=viewbook&amp;bookid=61&amp;cid=3|title=Electronic History Resources, online since 1990|publisher=Historical Text Archive|date=1956-11-04|accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The black trustee raced back to [[Helena, Arkansas|Helena]], the county seat of Phillips County, and alerted officials.  A posse was dispatched and within a few hours hundreds of white men, many of them the "low down" variety, began to comb the area for blacks they believed were launching an insurrection. In the end, over a hundred African Americans and five white men were killed. Some estimates of the black death toll range in the hundreds. Allegations surfaced that the white posse and even U.S. soldiers who were brought in to put down the so called "rebellion" had massacred defenseless black men, women and children.}}

The parish sheriff called for a posse to capture suspects in the killing. Violence expanded beyond the church. Additional armed white men entered the county from outside to support the hunt and a mob formed of 500 to 1,000 armed men. Local whites requested help from Arkansas Governor [[Charles Hillman Brough]], citing a "Negro uprising". Sensational newspaper headlines published by the ''Little Rock Gazette'' and others reported that an "insurrection" was occurring, and that blacks had planned to murder white leaders.(See scanned ''Gazette'' headlines on this page)

Brough contacted the [[United States Department of Defense|War Department]] and requested Federal troops. After considerable delay, nearly 600 U.S. troops arrived, finding the area in chaos. White men roamed the area randomly attacking and killing black men, women and children. Fighting in the area lasted for three days before the troops ended the violence. The federal troops disarmed both parties and arrested 285 black residents, putting them in stockades for investigation until being vouched for by their employers and protection.&lt;ref name="AKenc"/&gt;

An estimated 100 to 237 African Americans and five whites were killed, and more wounded. At least two and possibly more victims were killed by Federal troops. The exact number of blacks killed is unknown because of the wide rural area in which they were attacked, but estimates range from 100 to 237.&lt;ref name="encyclopediaofarkansas.net"&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=1102 Elaine Massacre, Arkansas Encyclopedia of History and Culture]; accessed April 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walter Francis White 1995, p.49"&gt;Walter Francis White, ''A Man Called White: The Autobiography of Walter White'', [[University of Georgia]] Press, Athens, GA reprint, 1995, pg. 49.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Other estimates of the time ranged higher.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Press coverage==
A dispatch from [[Helena, Arkansas]] to the ''New York Times'', datelined October 1, said: "Returning members of the [white] posse brought numerous stories and rumors, through all of which ran the belief that the rioting was due to propaganda distributed among the negroes by white men."&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/10/02/archives/nine-killed-in-fight-with-arkansas-posse.html "Nine Killed in Fight with Arkansas Posse"], October 2, 1919; accessed January 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day's report added detail:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Additional evidence has been obtained of the activities of propagandists among the negroes, and it is thought that a plot existed for a general uprising against the whites." A white man had been arrested and was "alleged to have been preaching social equality among the negroes." Part of the headline was: "Trouble Traced to Socialist Agitators."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1919/10/03/archives/six-more-are-killed-in-arkansas-riots-governor-brough-and-boston.html "Six More are Killed in Arkansas Riots"], ''New York Times'', October 3, 1919; accessed January 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A few days later a Western Newspaper Union dispatch was captioned, "Captive Negro Insurrectionists."&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/10/12/archives/article-34-no-title.html "Captive Negro Insurrectionists"], October 12, 1919; accessed January 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arkansas Governor [[Charles Hillman Brough]] appointed a Committee of Seven to investigate. The group was composed of prominent local white businessmen. Without talking to any of the black farmers, they concluded that the [[Progressive Farmers and Household Union of America]] was a Socialist enterprise and "established for the purpose of banding negroes together for the killing of white people."&lt;ref&gt;Eric M. Freedman, ''Habeas Corpus: Rethinking the Great Writ of Liberty'' (New York University Press, 2001), p. 68&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This version by the white power structure has persisted in many histories of the riot.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==NAACP involvement==
The NAACP promptly released a statement from a contact in Arkansas providing another account of the origins of the violence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The whole trouble, as I understand it, started because a Mr. Bratton, a white lawyer from Little Rock, Ark., was employed by sixty or seventy colored families to go to Elaine to represent them in a dispute with the white planters relative to the sale price of cotton.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It referred to a report in the ''[[The Commercial Appeal|Commercial Appeal]]'' of [[Memphis, Tennessee]] on October 3 that quoted Bratton's father:&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/10/13/archives/lays-riots-to-cotton-row-colored-association-denies-any-real.html "Lays Riots to Cotton Row"], October 13, 1919; accessed January 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It had been impossible for the negroes to obtain itemized statements of accounts, or in fact to obtain statements at all, and that the manager was preparing to ship their cotton, they being sharecroppers and having a half interest therein, off without settling with them or allowing them to sell their half of the crop and pay up their accounts.... If it's a crime to represent people in an effort to make honest settlements, then he has committed a crime.}}

The [[NAACP]] sent its Field Secretary, [[Walter F. White]], from New York City to Elaine in October 1919 to investigate events. White was of mixed, majority-European ancestry; blond and blue-eyed, he could [[passing (racial identity)|pass for white]]. He was granted credentials from the ''[[Chicago Daily News]].'' He gained an interview with Governor [[Charles Hillman Brough]], who gave him a letter of recommendation for other meetings with whites, as well as an autographed photograph.

White had been in Phillips County for a brief time when he learned there were rumors floating about him. He quickly took the first train back to [[Little Rock]]. The conductor told the young man that he was leaving "just when the fun is going to start," because they had found out that there was a "damned [[mixed race|yellow]] nigger passing for white and the boys are going to get him." When White asked what the boys would do to the man, the conductor told White that "when they get through with him he won't pass for white no more!"&lt;ref&gt;"Walter White: Mr. NAACP, 2003, p. 52"&lt;/ref&gt;

White had time to talk with both black and white residents in Elaine. He reported that local people said that up to 100 blacks had been killed. White published his findings in the ''Daily News,'' the ''[[Chicago Defender]],'' and ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]],'' as well as the NAACP's magazine ''[[The Crisis]].''&lt;ref name="encyclopediaofarkansas.net"/&gt; He "characterized the violence as an extreme response by white landowners to black unionization."&lt;ref name="union"&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=3027 Jason McCollom, "Progressive Farmers and Household Union of America (PFHUA)"], 2015, ''Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture''; accessed February 18, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Hillman Brough|Governor Brough]] asked the [[United States Postal Service]] to prohibit the mailing of the ''Chicago Defender'' and ''Crisis'' to Arkansas, while local officials attempted to [[injunction|enjoin]] distribution of the ''Defender.'' Years later, White said in his memoir that people in Elaine told him that up to 200 blacks had been killed.&lt;ref name="Walter Francis White 1995, p.49"/&gt;

==Trials==
{{one source|section|date=February 2017}}
In October and November 1919, an all-white Arkansas state grand jury returned indictments against 122 blacks. Since most blacks had been [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] by Arkansas' 1891 Election Law and 1892 poll tax amendment, which created barriers to voter registration, blacks as non-voters were excluded from juries. [[All-white juries]] rendered verdicts on the defendants in trials following the Elaine race riot.

Those blacks willing to testify against others and to work without shares for terms as determined by their landlords, were set free. Those who refused to comply with those conditions, or were labeled as ringleaders or were judged unreliable, were indicted. According to the affidavits later supplied by the defendants, many of the prisoners had been beaten, whipped or tortured by electric shocks to extract testimony or confessions. They were threatened with death if they recanted their testimony. A total of 73 suspects were charged with murder; other charges included conspiracy and insurrection.&lt;ref name="encyclopediaofarkansas.net"/&gt;

The trials were held in 1920 in the county courthouse in Elaine, [[Phillips County, Arkansas|Phillips County]]. Mobs of armed whites milled around the courthouse. Some of the white audience in the courtroom also carried arms. The lawyers for the defense did not subpoena witnesses for the defense and did not allow their clients to testify.&lt;ref name="AKenc"/&gt;

Twelve of the defendants (who became known as the 'Arkansas Twelve' or 'Elaine Twelve') were convicted of murder and sentenced to [[death penalty|death]] in the [[electric chair]], most of them as "accomplices" in the murder of Adkins at the church. The defense lawyer of one defendant did not interview any witnesses, ask for a change of venue, nor challenge any jurors.&lt;ref name="AKenc"/&gt; The trials of these twelve lasted less than an hour in many cases; the juries took fewer than ten minutes to deliberate before pronouncing each man guilty and sentencing them to death.  The ''[[Arkansas Gazette]]'' applauded the trials as the triumph of the "rule of law," because none of the defendants was [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]]. These men became known as the "Elaine Twelve."&lt;ref name="AKenc"/&gt;

After those convictions, 36 of the remaining defendants chose to plead guilty to second-degree murder rather than face trial. Sixty-seven other defendants were convicted of various charges and sentenced to terms up to 21 years.&lt;ref name="AKenc"/&gt;

==Appeals==
The NAACP took on the task of organizing the defendants' appeals. For a time, the NAACP tried to conceal its role in the appeals, given the hostile reception to its reports on the rioting and the trials. Once it undertook to organize the defense, it went to work vigorously, raising more than $50,000 and hiring [[Scipio Africanus Jones]], a highly respected African-American attorney from [[Arkansas]], and Colonel George W. Murphy, a 79-year-old Confederate veteran and former Attorney General for the State of Arkansas.&lt;ref name="AKenc"/&gt; [[Moorfield Storey]], descended from Boston abolitionists and founding president of the NAACP since 1909, became part of the team when the Moore cases went to the Supreme Court. He had been president of the [[American Bar Association]] in 1895.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt;

The defendants' lawyers obtained reversal of the verdicts by the Arkansas Supreme Court in six of the twelve death penalty cases, known as the ''Ware'' defendants.&lt;ref name="AKenc"/&gt;  The grounds were that the jury had failed to specify whether the defendants were guilty of murder in the first or second degree; those cases (known as Ware et al.) were sent back to the lower court for retrial.&lt;ref name="AKenc"/&gt; The lower court retried the defendants beginning on May 3, 1920. On the third day of the trials, Murphy collapsed in the courtroom.&lt;ref name="innocent"/&gt;

Scipio Jones had to carry most of the responsibility for the remaining trials. The all-white juries quickly convicted the six defendants of second-degree murder and sentenced them to 12 years each in prison. Jones appealed these convictions, which were overturned by the State Supreme Court. It found that the exclusion of blacks from the juries resulted in a lack of [[due process]] for the defendants, according to the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] and the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]].&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt;

==Moore et al.==

The [[Arkansas Supreme Court]] upheld the death sentences of Moore and the other five defendants, known as the ''Moore'' defendants. It rejected the challenge to the [[all-white jury|all-white juries]] as untimely, and found that the mob atmosphere and use of coerced testimony did not deny the defendants the due process of law. Those defendants unsuccessfully petitioned the [[United States Supreme Court]] for a writ of ''[[certiorari]]'' from the Arkansas Supreme Court's decision.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;Moore v. Dempsey, 261 U.S.  86 (1923)&lt;/ref&gt;

The defendants next petitioned for a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]],'' alleging that the proceedings that took place in the Arkansas state court, while ostensibly complying with trial requirements, in fact complied only in form. They argued that the accused had not been adequately defended and were convicted under the pressure of the mob, with blatant disregard for their constitutional rights.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt;

The defendants originally intended to file their petition in Federal district court, but the only sitting judge was assigned to other judicial duties in [[Minnesota]] at the time and would not return to Arkansas until after the defendants' scheduled execution date. Judge [[John Ellis Martineau]] of the Pulaski County [[Court of equity|chancery court]] issued the writ. Although the writ was later overturned by the Arkansas Supreme Court, his action postponed the execution date long enough to permit the defendants to seek ''habeas corpus'' relief in Federal court.&lt;ref name  ="Moore"/&gt;

U.S. District Judge Jacob Trieber issued another writ. The State of Arkansas defended the convictions from a narrowly legalistic position, based on the US Supreme Court's earlier decision in ''[[Frank v. Mangum]]'' (1915). It did not dispute the defendants' evidence of torture used to obtain confessions nor of mob intimidation at the trial, but the state argued that, even if true, these elements did not amount to a denial of due process. The [[United States district court]] agreed, denying the writ, but it found there was probable cause for an appeal&lt;!--On what grounds?--&gt; and allowed the defendants to take their case to the U.S. Supreme Court..&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt;

In ''[[Moore v. Dempsey]]'' {{ussc|261|86|1923}},.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt; the [[United States Supreme Court]] vacated these six convictions on the grounds that the mob-dominated atmosphere of the trial and the use of testimony coerced by torture denied the defendants' [[due process]] as required by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. Prominent Little Rock attorney George Rose wrote a letter to outgoing Governor [[Thomas McRae]] requesting that he find a way to release the remaining defendants if they agreed to plead guilty to second-degree murder. Rose's letter was an attempt to prevent Governor-Elect [[Thomas Jefferson Terral]], a known member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], from getting involved in the matter.&lt;ref name=terral&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldstatehouse.com/exhibits/virtual/governors/the_1920s_and_1930s/terral.aspx|title=Thomas J.

Alexander, "Defeat, Decline, Disintegration: the Ku Klux Klan in Arkansas, 1924 and After", ''[[Arkansas Historical Quarterly]]'', XXII (Winter 1963), p. 317&lt;/ref&gt;

Just hours before Governor McRae left office in 1925, he contacted [[Scipio Jones]] to inform him that indefinite furloughs had been issued for the remaining defendants.&lt;ref name="AKenc"/&gt; Jones used the furloughs to obtain release of the prisoners under cover of darkness. He arranged for these men to be quickly escorted out of state to prevent their being lynched.

==Aftermath==

The Supreme Court's decision marked the beginning of an era in which the Supreme Court gave closer scrutiny to criminal justice cases and reviewed state actions against the Due Process Clause and the Bill of Rights. A decade later, the Supreme Court reviewed the case of the [[Scottsboro boys]]. The victory for the Elaine defendants gave the [[NAACP]] greater credibility as the champion of African Americans' rights. [[Walter F. White]]'s risk-taking investigation and report contributed to his advancing in the organization. He later was selected as executive secretary of the NAACP, essentially the chief operating officer, and served in this position for decades, leading the organization in additional legal challenges and civil rights activism.

"It is documented that five whites, including a soldier died at Elaine, but estimates of African American deaths, made by individuals writing about the Elaine affair between 1919-25, range from 20 to 856; if accurate, these numbers would make it by far the most deadly conflict in the history of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Grif Stockley, ''Blood in their Eyes: The Elaine Race Massacres of 1919'' (Fayetteville, Arkansas:  University of Arkansas Press, 2001), xiv.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Arkansas Encyclopedia of History and Culture'' notes that estimates of African-American deaths range into the "hundreds."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=1102 "Elaine race riot"], ''Encyclopedia of Arkansas''; accessed February 13, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 20th century, researchers have begun to investigate the Elaine race riot more thoroughly. For decades, the riot and numerous murders were too painful to be discussed openly in the region. The wide-scale violence ended union organizing among black farmers. White oppression continued, threatening every black family. Historian Robert Whitaker says, "As with many racial histories of this kind," it was "one of those shameful events best not talked about."&lt;ref name="innocent"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/22/books/review/Jennings-t.html?_r=0 JAY JENNINGS, "12 Innocent Men"], ''New York Times'', June 22, 2008; accessed February 17, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reason for silence was that the second [[Ku Klux Klan]] began to be active in Arkansas in 1921, concentrating in black-majority areas. It used intimidation and attacks to keep blacks suppressed. Author [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]] grew up in Phillips County and discusses it in his autobiography ''Black Boy.'' He wrote that when he questioned his mother about why their people didn't fight back, "the fear that was in her made her slap me into silence."&lt;ref name="innocent"/&gt;

A 1961 article, "Underlying Causes of the Elaine Riot," claimed that blacks were planning an insurrection, based on interviews with whites who had been alive at the time, and that they were fairly treated by planters of the area. It repeated rumors of 1919 that certain planters were targeted for murder.&lt;ref name="butts"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/40025430?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Butts, J. W., and Dorothy James. "The Underlying Causes of the Elaine Riot of 1919"], ''Arkansas Historical Quarterly'' 20 (Spring 1961): 95–104, via JSTOR&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been generally discounted by historians publishing since the late 20th century.

In early 2000 a conference on the Elaine riot was held at the [[Delta Cultural Center]] in the county seat of [[Helena, Arkansas]].&lt;ref name="AKenc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="conference"&gt;[http://madyun.freeservers.com/ ''Reconsidering the Elaine Race Riots of 1919''], Conference, February 10–11, 2000, Delta Cultural Center&lt;/ref&gt; It was an effort to review the facts but did not result in "closure" for the people of Phillips County.&lt;ref name="AKenc"/&gt; The [[Associated Press]] spoke with author Grif Shockley, who has published a book on the riot. He said that in 2000, there were still two versions of the riot, which he characterized as the "white" version, related to their idea that the union planned an attack on whites, and a "black" version, related to farmers' efforts to gain fair settlements of their crops. Shockley said there "was plenty of evidence to say whites attacked blacks indiscriminately."&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; Local electoral offices were divided between the races in West Helena and the county.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;[http://lubbockonline.com/stories/020900/nat_020900012.shtml#.WKXS9PKZmYE Associated Press, "Conference to dredge up bloody past of 1919 Arkansas race riot"], ''Lubbock Avalanche-Journal,'' February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The Intercollegiate '''Ethics Bowl''' is an activity that combines the excitement of a competitive tournament with a valuable education experience for undergraduate students.  Created in 1993 at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]], the Ethics Bowl has grown steadily over the years. Resembling a [[college bowl]] or [[quiz bowl]] competition, a moderator asks two teams questions that pose an ethical problem on topics ranging from professional ethics to social and political topics, and are then scored by a panel of judges on their responses both to the question and one another. Since 1997, the national Ethics Bowl Competition has taken place every year at the annual meeting of the Association for Practical and Professional Ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Ladenson, Robert. [http://ethics.iit.edu/eb/Ladensoneb.pdf The Educational Significance of Ethics Bowl]" ''Teaching Ethics'' 1:1 (2001) 63.&lt;/ref&gt; 

For the past few years ten regional bowls have taken place throughout the U.S. with over 100 teams competing. The top thirty-two teams are then invited to participate in the national competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://appe.indiana.edu/ethics-bowl/ethics-bowl/ Ethics Bowl] Association for Practical and Professional Ethics.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Along with the Intercollegiate Ethics Bowl for undergraduates, a number of other ethics bowl competitions are held, including one sponsored by the Society for American Archeology. The Parr Center for Ethics, at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], is the headquarters for the National High School Ethics Bowl. The National High School Ethics Bowl currently has 32 regional competitions across the United States, and the national competition takes place every spring at UNC-CH. 

An international version of the same event has been established using technology to bring high school students together called an Olympiad.

== Ethics Bowl Format ==

While the organization of Ethics Bowl tournaments can vary from region to region, single rounds generally follow a given format.  Four to six weeks before the date of the competition, the competing teams, judges, and moderators are given a packet of case studies that present ethical issues to study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ethics.iit.edu/eb/Pastcases.html Ethics Bowl Case Archive] Center for the Study of Ethics, Illinois Institute of Technology&lt;/ref&gt; The goal for the teams is not to do research on the cases, but to be able to formulate well structured, logical answers to questions asked about the cases.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In the round, both teams are each asked a question about different case studies.  The team answers questions in the following way.  First, the moderator poses a question to the team, and after two minutes to confer, the team must state their answer within ten minutes. The responding team then has one minute to present a response to the first team's answer for five minutes, and the first team then has a chance to respond to these comments for 5 minutes with 1 minute before to confer. Finally, the panel of judges has the chance to ask questions of the first team, either to clarify a point, or to elicit a team's viewpoint on an ethical aspect raised in their response. The judges then proceed to evaluate the first teams' response and the second team's comment based on the following criteria: clarity and intelligibility, focus on ethically relevant factors, avoidance of ethical irrelevance, and deliberative thoughtfulness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://appe.indiana.edu/ethics-bowl/cases-rules-and-guidelines/ IEB Cases, Rules and Guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt; The round then repeats this format with the second team receiving a question about a different case.  

In the national competition of the Intercollegiate Ethics Bowl, during the first evening, each team competes in two rounds against different teams. Two more rounds commence the next morning, and then the top eight teams continue on to the last rounds, all of which are single-elimination: quarter finals, semi finals, and lastly, the final round where the two remaining teams compete to determine the winner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://appe.indiana.edu/ethics-bowl/intercollegiate-ethics-bowl-competitions/ Competitions Rules] IEB Rules for National and Regional Championships&lt;/ref&gt;

== History  ==

The Ethics Bowl was developed in 1993 by Dr. Robert Ladenson of the Illinois Institute of Technology. An intramural Ethics Bowl was held at IIT for two years, and in 1995 a small local competition was held where teams from [[DePaul University]], [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola University]], and [[Western Michigan University]] were invited to compete against the winning IIT from that year's competition. In 1996, the same four schools participated in the local competition, along with a team from the [[United States Air Force Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;Ladenson, "The Educational Significance of the Ethics Bowl" p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The first nationwide Intercollegiate Ethics Bowl was held in 1997 in Washington, D.C. in conjunction with the annual meeting of the Association for Practical and Professional Ethics. Since that time, the Ethics Bowl has taken place at the APPE annual meeting every year.  The University of Montana won the National Championship in 1997. The United States Military Academy competed in and won the National Championship in 1998 and 1999.  In 2006, due to the number of teams wishing to participate in the Ethics Bowl, regional competitions were held at locations throughout the U.S., and the top-scoring 32 teams were invited to participate in the national competition held in February, 2007. 

In 2006, the [[United States Military Academy]] won the national championship.&lt;br&gt;
In 2007, the University of Miami beat Westminster College to win the national championship.&lt;br&gt;
In 2008 in San Antonio, Texas, Clemson University beat Westminster College in the final round to be national champion.&lt;br&gt; 
In 2009, Indiana University beat Clemson University for the national title.&lt;br&gt;
In 2010, the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) beat Weber State University  to win the national championship.&lt;br&gt;
In 2011, the University of Central Florida beat Montana State to claim the national championship.&lt;br&gt;
In 2012, Whitworth University beat Clemson University in the final match for the national championship.&lt;br&gt;
In 2013, in San Antonio, Texas, DePauw University beat Taylor University in the final match for the national championship.&lt;br&gt;
In 2014, in Jacksonville, Florida, the University of Montana beat the University of Oklahoma in the final match for the national championship.&lt;br&gt; 
In 2015, in Costa Mesa, California, Taylor University beat Whitworth University in the final match for the national championship.&lt;br&gt; 
In 2016, Whitworth University beat Youngstown State University in the final match for the national championship.&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16933">'''Fish slaughter''' is the process of killing fish, typically after harvesting at sea or from fish farms. At least one trillion fish are slaughtered each year for human consumption. Some relatively humane slaughter methods have been developed, including percussive and electric stunning. However, most fish harvesting continues to use methods like suffocation in air, carbon-dioxide stunning, or ice chilling that may not optimise fish welfare in some instances.

==Numbers==
{{main article|World fish production}}

According to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), a total of 156.2 million tons of [[fish]], [[crustacean]]s, [[Mollusca|molluscs]], and other [[aquatic animal]]s were captured in 2011. This is a sum of 93.5 million tons of wild animals and 62.7 million tons of farmed animals. 56.8% of this total was freshwater fish, 6.4% diadromous fish, and 3.2% marine fish, with the remainder being molluscs, crustaceans, and miscellaneous.&lt;ref name=FAO2011&gt;{{cite web|last=FAO|title=Fishery and aquaculture statistics|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3507t/i3507t.pdf|accessdate=8 April 2014|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of individual wild fish killed each year is estimated as 0.97-2.74 trillion (based on FAO tonnage statistics combined with estimated mean weights of fish species).&lt;ref name=Mood2010 /&gt; The FAO numbers do not include [[illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing]], nor discarded fish. If these are included and over-reporting by China subtracted, the totals increase by about 16.6% to 33.3%.&lt;ref name=Mood2010&gt;{{cite web|last=Mood|first=A.|title=Estimating the number of fish caught in global fishing each year|url=http://fishcount.org.uk/published/std/fishcountstudy.pdf|work=fishcount.org.uk|accessdate=8 April 2014|author2=P. Brooke}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar estimate for the number of farmed fish slaughtered each year is 0.037 to 0.120 trillion.&lt;ref name=Mood2012&gt;{{cite web|last=Mood|first=A.|title=Estimating the number of farmed fish killed in global aquaculture each year|url=http://fishcount.org.uk/published/std/fishcountstudy2.pdf|work=fishcount.org.uk|accessdate=8 April 2014|author2=P. Brooke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mid-sized trout farms in the UK may process more than 10,000 fish per hour. They are often operated by only a few people, and it may be necessary to kill trout on short notice or even at night.&lt;ref name=Lines2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lines|first=J.A. |author2=D.H. Robb |author3=S.C. Kestin |author4=S.C. Crook |author5=T.

==Welfare indicators==
{{Main article|Animal welfare science}}
Research on fish suffering during slaughter relies on measures to indicate when fish are stressed. Some indicators used by welfare studies include&lt;ref name=Poli2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poli|first=B.M. |author2=Parisi, G. |author3=Scappini, F. |author4=Zampacavallo, G.|title=Fish welfare and quality as affected by pre-slaughter and slaughter management|journal=Aquaculture International|year=2005|volume=13|pages=29–49|doi=10.1007/s10499-004-9035-1}}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 January 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Behavior
** Swimming, [[gill]] movement, eye movement in response to body re-orientation, reaction when inverted, etc.
* Electrical measures
** [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], [[Electrocardiography|ECG]], [[Evoked potential|evoked responses]], etc.
** These are quite accurate but also require high levels of expertise.
* Hematic measures
** [[Cortisol]], [[Blood sugar|plasma glucose]], [[plasma lactate]], [[hematocrit]], etc.
* Tissue measures
** Indicators of stress in the muscle tissue, like [[lactic acid]], [[pH]], and the [[Catabolism|catabolites]] of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP).
** These indicators typically also correlate with lower-quality meat.

Following electric stunning, as fish gradually resume consciousness, they begin to make rhythmic gill-cover movements. Based on EEG correlations, it is believed that stunned fish remain insensible until they have resumed rhythmic gill patterns.&lt;ref name=KestinEtAl1995&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kestin|first=S.C. |author2=Wotton, S. |author3=Adams, S.|title=The effect of CO2, concussion or electrical stunning of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) on fish welfare.|journal=Proc. Int. Conf. Aquaculture Europe on Quality in Aquaculture, Gent, Belgium. European Aquaculture Society Special Publ|year=1995|volume=23|pages=380–381}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be used as a convenient assessment tool for the effectiveness of electric stunning.&lt;ref name=Lines2003 /&gt;

==Inhumane methods==

In 2004, the [[European Food Safety Authority]] observed that "Many existing commercial killing methods expose fish to substantial suffering over a prolonged period of time."&lt;ref name=EFSA2004 /&gt;

The ''Aquatic Animal Health Code'' of the [[World Organisation for Animal Health]] considers the following slaughter methods inhumane.&lt;ref name=OIE2013&gt;{{cite book|last=OIE|title=Aquatic Animal Health Code|year=2013|url=http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=171&amp;L=0&amp;htmfile=chapitre_1.7.3.htm|edition=16th|accessdate=8 April 2014|chapter=Ch. 7.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air asphyxiation===

This is the oldest slaughter method for fish and is considered inhumane because it can take the fish over an hour to die.&lt;ref name=Poli2005 /&gt; One Dutch study found that it took 55–250 minutes for various species of fish to become insensible during asphyxiation.&lt;ref name=HumaneSlaughterFishCount&gt;{{cite web|title=humane slaughter|url=http://fishcount.org.uk/fish-welfare-in-commercial-fishing/humane-slaughter|website=fishcount.org.uk|accessdate=23 February 2015|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fish that evolved for low-oxygen environments take longer to die. At higher temperatures, fish lose consciousness more quickly.&lt;ref name=Tinarwo2006&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tinarwo|first1=Ambrose|editor1-link=Matthias Kaiser|editor2-link=Marianne Elisabeth Lien|title=Ethics And The Politics Of Food: Preprints of the 6th Congress of the European Society for Agricultural and Food Ethics: EurSAFE 2006 Olso, Norway, June 22-24, 2006|date=2006|publisher=Wageningen Academic Publishers|isbn=978-9086860081|page=460|chapter=The ethical slaughter of farmed fish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meat quality and shelf-life are also diminished when this method is used.&lt;ref name=Poli2005 /&gt;

===Ice bath===

Also called ''live chilling'', this method involves putting fish in baths of ice water, where they chill and eventually die of anoxia. Because chilling slows metabolic rate and oxygen needs, it may prolong the duration until death in some instances, with some cold adapted species taking more than an hour to die.&lt;ref name=Poli2005 /&gt; On these grounds, the [[Farm Animal Welfare Council]]'s 1996 report on farmed-fish welfare stated: "The cooling of live trout on ice after they have been removed from water should be prohibited."&lt;ref name=FAWC1996Trout&gt;{{cite web|last=Farm Animal Welfare Council|title=Report on the welfare of farmed fish - Recommendations: trout|url=http://www.fawc.org.uk/reports/fish/fishr085.htm|accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, later research suggested that for warm Mediterranean species such as [[Sparidae|sea bream]] and [[Serranidae|sea bass]], the method might at least be preferable to air asphyxiation, with fish showing lower levels of stress indicators.&lt;ref name=Poli2005 /&gt;  More recent research has shown that ice water is faster and less stressful than anaesthetics for killing tropical ornamental fishes like zebrafish.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson et al. 2009.Evaluation of Rapid Cooling and Tricaine Methanesulfonate (MS222) as Methods of
Euthanasia in Zebrafish (Danio rerio). Journal of the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science 48,   785–789.&lt;/ref&gt;

===CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; narcosis===

Most often applied for salmon and trout, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; narcosis involves filling the fish water with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to produce acidic pH, which injures the brain. The procedure is apparently stressful, as evidenced by fish swimming vigorously and trying to escape from the tank. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; immobilizes the fish within 2–4 minutes, but the fish remain conscious until subsequent stunning or killing.&lt;ref name=Poli2005 /&gt;

===Salt or ammonia baths===
Salting involves application of salt to the container holding the fish, the salt applied should be just enough to weaken the fish. Salting of fish as a slaughtering (killing method) is only applicable to freshwater species

===Exsanguination without stunning===

[[Exsanguination]] is the process whereby an animal is cut so that it bleeds to death.  Fish are cut in highly vascular body regions, and the process is stressful unless the animals are unconscious. If not stunned, according to behavioral and neural criteria, fish may remain conscious for 15 minutes or more between the time when major blood vessels have been cut and when they lose consciousness.&lt;ref name=EFSA2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=EFSA|title=Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW) on a request from the Commission related to welfare aspects of the main systems of stunning and killing the main commercial species of animals|journal=The EFSA Journal|date=11 October 2004|doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2004.45}}&lt;!--|accessdate=8 April 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Morzel2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morzel|first=Martine |author2=Delphine Sohier |author3=Hans Van de Vis|title=Evaluation of slaughtering methods for turbot with respect to animal welfare and flesh quality|journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture|date=1 January 2003|volume=83|issue=1|pages=19–28|doi=10.1002/jsfa.1253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eel brains may continue to process information for 13–30 minutes after being [[Decapitation|decapitated]], and some fish may remain sensible for 20–40 minutes after [[Disembowelment|evisceration]].&lt;ref name=FishSite2013 /&gt;

==Potentially more humane methods==

===Percussive stunning===

Also known as ''knocking'', percussive stunning involves hitting the fish's head with a wooden or plastic club, called a ''[[Priest (tool)|priest]]''. One or two appropriate blows can disrupt the brain sufficiently to render the fish insensible and potentially even kill it directly. However, applying this method correctly requires training and effort. Percussive stunning must be applied one fish at a time and so is typically only used for large fish, such as [[salmon]] and [[trout]]. If the operator is skilled, percussive stunning can be among the most humane methods and can also yield high meat quality.&lt;ref name=Poli2005 /&gt; One comparison of slaughter methods found that percussive stunning had the best welfare performance as measured by low hematocrit, low plasma glucose, low lactate, and high muscle energy charge.&lt;ref name=Poli2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poli|first=B.M. |author2=Zampacavallo, G. |author3=Iurzan, F. |author4=de Francesco, M. |author5=Parisi, G. |author6=Mosconi, G.|title=Biochemical stress indicators changes in sea bass as influenced by the slaughter method|journal=Proceedings of the ‘‘Aquaculture Europe 2002: Sea Farming Today and Tomorrow’’|year=2002|volume=32|pages=429–430}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some fish species, there are automated percussive stunning tools, such as a pneumatic club for salmon.&lt;ref name=Poli2005 /&gt; However, building an automated machine to process, orient, percussively stun, and bleed bulk quantities of small fish would be difficult.&lt;ref name=Lines2003 /&gt;

===Pithing===

[[Pithing]], also known as [[ikejime]] (or ikijime), involves sticking a sharp spike through the brain of the fish. If done properly, it can kill quickly, however, if the operator misses the brain, the results may be stressful for the fish. As with percussive stunning, spiking is used to kill one fish at a time and so is mainly used for large species such as tuna and salmon.&lt;ref name=Poli2005 /&gt;

===Shooting===

Shooting large fish is also possible.&lt;ref name=OIE2013 /&gt;

===Electrical stunning===

Electricity can be more humane than alternatives if applied correctly.&lt;ref name=VanderVis2003 /&gt; In addition to potentially producing unconsciousness quickly, stunning reduces the stress of restraint and being removed from water.&lt;ref name=EFSA2004WelfareAspects /&gt;{{rp|167–68}}

If electrical parameters are not optimized, [[electrical stunning]] may produce immobility without loss of consciousness, which is inhumane.&lt;ref name=Poli2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=FishSite2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=EFSA2004WelfareAspects&gt;{{cite web|title=Welfare Aspects of Animal Stunning and Killing Methods|url=https://www.efsa.europa.eu/fr/efsajournal/pub/45|publisher=European Food Safety Authority|accessdate=21 January 2015|date=15 Jun 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|167}} There is little public data comparing optimal stun settings found by researchers with the settings used in commercial slaughter operations, so it is unknown how effective real-world stunning is.&lt;ref name=YueFishWelfare&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yue|first1=Stephanie|title=An HSUS Report: The Welfare of Farmed Fish at Slaughter|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/assets/pdfs/farm/hsus-the-welfare-of-farmed-fish-at-slaughter.pdf|publisher=Humane Society of the United States|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} In addition, proper stun parameters vary significantly by species.&lt;ref name=EFSA2004WelfareAspects /&gt;{{rp|168}}

Electricity may introduce bleedspots, so proper settings are required.&lt;ref name=VanderVis2003&gt;{{cite journal |last=Van der Vis |first=H. |author2=Kestin, S. |author3=Robb, D. |author4=Oehlenschlager, J. |author5=Lambooij, B. |author6=Munkner, W. |author7=Kuhlmann, H. |author8=Kloosterboer, K. |author9=Tejada, M. |author10=Huidobro, A. |author11=Ottera, H. |author12=Roth, B. |author13=Sørensen, N.K. |author14=Akse, L. |author15=Byrne, H. |author16=Nesvadba, P. |title=Is humane slaughter of fish possible for industry? |journal=Aquaculture Research |year=2003 |volume=34 |pages=211–220 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2109.2003.00804.x/abstract |accessdate=13 February 2014 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2109.2003.00804.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modern systems====

Systems have been developed to slaughter large numbers of fish whilst maintaining welfare standards.

A paper published by Jeff Lines and his collaborators in 2003 announced that stunning trout for 60 seconds in an electric field of 250 V/m r.m.s. with a sinusoidal waveform of 1,000 [[Hertz|Hz]] rendered them permanently unconscious without degrading meat quality.&lt;ref name=Lines2003 /&gt; A stunning system, called HS1, has been developed in accordance with Lines' study. The system first stuns fish and then keeps them unconscious, through [[:wikt:electronarcosis|electronarcosis]], until death. The machine has been widely adopted in the UK, precessing an estimated 80% of all UK trout killed for meat.&lt;ref name=HS1&gt;{{cite web|title=Pipeline Stunner|url=http://www.aceaquatec.com/HS1.htm|work=Ace Aquatec|accessdate=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[Humane Slaughter Association]]'s James Kirkwood: "Before ten years ago there was no way to humanely kill farmed fish en masse – they died slowly through suffocation when harvested from the water. This welfare benefit affects millions of fish."&lt;ref name=Awards2011&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards given for dedication to fish welfare|url=http://www.thefishsite.com/fishnews/15180/awards-given-for-dedication-to-fish-welfare|newspaper=The Fish Site|publisher=5M Publishing|accessdate=29 March 2014|date=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations==

No welfare standards exist for the trillion or more fish harvested from the wild each year.&lt;ref name=Singer2010&gt;{{cite news|last=Singer|first=Peter|title=Fish: the forgotten victims on our plate|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2010/sep/14/fish-forgotten-victims|accessdate=8 April 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, Norway has banned CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; stunning.&lt;ref name=FishSite2013&gt;{{cite news|title=How Does Slaughter Affect Fish Welfare?|url=http://www.thefishsite.com/articles/1751/how-does-slaughter-affect-fish-welfare|accessdate=8 April 2014|newspaper=The Fish Site|publisher=5M Publishing|date=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January 2010, 80% of Norwegian fish-slaughter facilities had switched to either percussive or electrical stunning.&lt;ref name=FishCountFarmed&gt;{{cite news|title=Slaughter of farmed fish|url=http://fishcount.org.uk/farmed-fish-welfare/farmed-fish-slaughter|accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany has banned use of salt or ammonia baths.&lt;ref name=FishSite2013 /&gt;

==Life and career==
Kurtz was born in Davenport, Iowa, the third child of Dora Lee (née Fenton) and Frank Allen Kurtz, Sr., an insurance salesman.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=American National Biography: Supplement 2|author1=Betz, P.R.|author2=Carnes, M.C.|author3=American Council of Learned Societies|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=9780195222029|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wZczV8ZxgL4C|page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=The history of the Fowlers|author=Fowler, C.C.|date=1950|publisher=C.C.

Kurtz's diving abilities impressed Olympic champion swimmer [[Johnny Weissmuller]], who encouraged him to train with famous coach [[Clyde Swendsen]].&lt;ref name=ishof/&gt; Kurtz graduated from [[Hollywood High School]] and went on to the [[University of Southern California]] especially to join the diving team. He won a bronze medal in the [[Diving at the 1932 Summer Olympics – Men's 10 metre platform|10 meter platform]] at the 1932 Olympics and placed fifth in [[Diving at the 1936 Summer Olympics – Men's 10 metre platform|1936]], competing with an injured shoulder.&lt;ref name=ishof/&gt; He also won the [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]] platform title in 1933.&lt;ref name=sr&gt;[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ku/frank-kurtz-1.html Frank Kurtz]. sports-reference.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==
Kurtz joined the Army to train as a pilot, anticipating a career in commercial aviation. Before the war, he held the national junior transcontinental speed record and established half a dozen other speed marks for light planes.&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-11-07/news/mn-62266_1_frank-kurtz |title=Frank Kurtz; World War II Aviation Hero |date=November 7, 1996 |last=Oliver |first=Myrna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was Commander of the [[463rd Airlift Group|463d Bombardment Group (Heavy)]], [[15th Air Force]], Celone Airfield, Foggia, [[Italy]] (1944–45) and a survivor of the air attack at [[Clark Field]] in the [[Philippines]], two days after the Japanese attack on [[Pearl Harbor attack|Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941. In [[Australia]], he salvaged and helped to rebuild a [[B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17D Flying Fortress]] bomber using a combination of parts from other wrecked B-17s. At that time, the repaired B-17D was nicknamed "[[The Swoose (B-17)|The Swoose]]" by 19th Bomb Group pilot, Captain Weldon Smith. The tail of a Boeing B-17D, AAF Ser. No. 40-3091 was grafted onto 40-3097, resulting in a hybrid B-17D. The bomber became "half swan and half goose" just like the lyrics in the then-popular novelty song "Alexander, The Swoose." Before the end of the war, "The Swoose" was scheduled to be scrapped and smelted down for its aluminium content. Kurtz then convinced the City of Los Angeles to retrieve his by-then famous bomber for use as a World War II memorial: It was the only B-17 that flew from the beginning of [[World War II]] until the end. Today, "The Swoose" is the oldest surviving B-17 and the only early "D" model still in existence. It is being restored at the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] at [[Wright-Patterson AFB]] in Fairborn, Ohio.

After 24 years in the service of the United States Armed Forces ([[U.S. Army Air Corps]], [[U.S. Army Air Forces]], and the [[U.S. Air Force]]), Kurtz retired and became a top executive at the William May Garland development firm.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

==Personal life==
Kurtz married Margret "Margo" Kurtz and had one child, actress [[Swoosie Kurtz]] (born 1944). His daughter{{'}}s first name "Swoosie" (rhymes with Lucy, rather than woozy) is derived from his two B-17s named "The Swoose" and "Swoose II", which he piloted with the 19th and [[463d Bombardment Group|463rd Bomb Groups]].&lt;ref name=sr/&gt;&lt;ref name=r1&gt;[http://lanbob.com/lanbob/H-42Auth/KF32P.htm Frank Kurtz]. lanbob.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurtz died in 1996 from complications following a fall.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; In 2012 he was inducted into the [[International Swimming Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name=ishof&gt;[http://www.ishof.org/colonel-frank-kurtz-(usa).html Colonel Frank Kurtz (USA) 2012 Honor Pioneer Diver]. ishof.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gospel of Basilides''' is the title given to a reputed text within the [[New Testament apocrypha]], which is reported in the middle of the third century as then circulating amongst the followers of [[Basilides]] (Βασιλείδης), a leading theologian of [[Gnostic]] tendencies, who had taught in [[Alexandria]] in the second quarter of the second century.   Basilides's teachings were condemned as heretical by [[Irenaeus|Irenaeus of Lyons]] (c.130&amp;nbsp;– c.200),&lt;ref&gt;Haer. 1.24.4&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Hippolytus of Rome]] (c. 170&amp;nbsp;– c.236),&lt;ref&gt;Ref. VII 20.1&lt;/ref&gt; although they had been evaluated more positively by [[Clement of Alexandria]] (c.150&amp;nbsp;– c.215).&lt;ref&gt;Strom. Iv 12.81; Strom. III 1.1&lt;/ref&gt;  There is, however, no agreement amongst Irenaeus, Hippolytus or Clement as to Basilides's specific theological opinions;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church|author=Frank Leslie Cross, Elizabeth A. Livingstone|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=019211655X|page=168|article= Basilides}}&lt;/ref&gt; while none of the three report a gospel in the name of Basilides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Kelhoffer|first=James A. |title=Conceptions of "Gospel" and Legitimacy in Early Christianity|year=2014 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |pages=87|isbn = 9783161526367}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first direct reference to a Gospel of Basilides is therefore that found in [[Origen]] (c.185&amp;nbsp;– c.254), who reports: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Church has four Gospels. Heretics have many. One of them is entitled ''[[Greek Gospel of the Egyptians|According to the Egyptians]]''. Another is ''[[Gospel of the Twelve|According to the Twelve Apostles]]''. Basilides too dared to write a ''Gospel According to Basilides''.&lt;ref&gt;in Luc. Hom. I.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Kelhoffer|first=James A. |title=Conceptions of "Gospel" and Legitimacy in Early Christianity|year=2014 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |pages=85|isbn = 9783161526367}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Origen’s notice is the source for references to the Gospel of Basilides in [[Jerome]],&lt;ref&gt;Com. in Mat. prol&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ambrose]],&lt;ref&gt;Exp. Ev. Luc. i.2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip of Side]],&lt;ref&gt;Hist. fr 4.4&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bede|Venerable Bede]].&lt;ref&gt;In Luc. Ev. Exp. I prol&lt;/ref&gt;  But none of these authors report any quotations from the supposed gospel, nor are they able to give an indication as to its content or character.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Schneemelcher|first=Wilhelm |title=New Testament Apocrypha; English translation by R.

IV 7.7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Kelhoffer|first=James A. |title=Conceptions of "Gospel" and Legitimacy in Early Christianity|year=2014 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |pages=89|isbn = 9783161526367}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this notice has been interpreted as characterising the full ''Exegetica'' as an extended commentary, whose base text might be inferred as being the lost ''Gospel of Basilides''.  From this assumption and the surviving quotations from the ''Exegetica'', a range of theories have been developed as to the nature of the Gospel of Basilides:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Kelhoffer|first=James A. |title=Conceptions of "Gospel" and Legitimacy in Early Christianity|year=2014 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |pages=78|isbn = 9783161526367}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it was a redaction of the Gospel of Luke; that it combined the Gospels of Luke and Matthew; that it was a ‘’diatessaron’’  or harmony of all four gospels; that it was an independent account of the life of Jesus; and even that it was an abstract treatise or homily on the religious significance of Jesus, with no specific relation to his teachings or the events of his earthly ministry, similar in this respect to the [[Gospel of Truth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Kelhoffer|first=James A. |title=Conceptions of "Gospel" and Legitimacy in Early Christianity|year=2014 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |pages=94|isbn = 9783161526367}}&lt;/ref&gt; another Gnostic work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Schneemelcher|first=William |title=New Testament Apocrypha; English translation by R. McL. Wilson |year=1991 |publisher=James Clarke |pages=398|isbn = 0227679156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars maintain that Origen’s notice of a Gospel of Basilides was referring to the ''Exegetica'' itself; and that the two titles are therefore to be identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Kelhoffer|first=James A. |title=Conceptions of "Gospel" and Legitimacy in Early Christianity|year=2014 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |pages=78|isbn = 9783161526367}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Otherwise, the Gospel of Basilides could denote a second or third century Gnostic text (whether lost or surviving under another title) with no connection to Basilides himself, other than being preserved within the sect that bore his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Kelhoffer|first=James A. |title=Conceptions of "Gospel" and Legitimacy in Early Christianity|year=2014 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |pages=94|isbn= 9783161526367}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilhelm Schneemelcher]] states: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;In short it must be said that all conjectures concerning the Gospel of Basilides remain uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Schneemelcher|first=Wilhelm |title=New Testament Apocrypha; English translation by R. McL. Wilson |year=1991 |publisher=James Clarke |pages=399|isbn = 0227679156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Account of the Crucifixion==

Basilides is reported as having taught a [[docetism|docetic]] doctrine of Christ's [[Passion (Christianity)|passion]]. Although Irenaeus’s makes no mention of Basilides having written a gospel, he does record him as teaching that Christ in Jesus, as a wholly divine being, could not suffer bodily pain and did not die on the cross; but that the person crucified was, in fact, [[Simon of Cyrene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church|author=Frank Leslie Cross, Elizabeth A. Livingstone|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=019211655X|page=168|article= Basilides}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Ehrman|first=Bart |title=Lost Christianities|year=2005 |publisher=OUP |pages=188|isbn = 0195182499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;He appeared on earth as a man and performed miracles. Thus he himself did not suffer. Rather, a certain Simon of Cyrene was compelled to carry his cross for him. It was he who was ignorantly and erroneously crucified, being transfigured by him, so that he might be thought to be Jesus.  Moreover, Jesus assumed the form of Simon, and stood by laughing at them.&lt;ref&gt;Haer. 1.24.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Kelhoffer|first=James A. |title=Conceptions of "Gospel" and Legitimacy in Early Christianity|year=2014 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |pages=80|isbn = 9783161526367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irenaeus, [[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|''Against Heresies'']]&lt;ref&gt;"Et gentibus ipsorum autem apparuisse eum in terra hominem, et virtutes perfecisse. Quapropter neque passsum eum, sed Simonem quendam Cyrenæum angariatum portasse crucem ejus pro eo: et hunc secundum ignorantiam et errorem crucifixum, transfiguratum ab eo, uti putaretur ipse esse Jesus: et ipsum autem Jesum Simonis accepisse formam, et stantem irrisisse eos." [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101074938950;view=1up;seq=406 Book 1, Chapter 19]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Epiphanius of Salamis]] reports the same episode as being taught by Basilides,&lt;ref&gt;Pan. 24.3.2,4&lt;/ref&gt; although he may in this be relying solely on Irenaeus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Kelhoffer|first=James A. |title=Conceptions of "Gospel" and Legitimacy in Early Christianity|year=2014 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |pages=87|isbn = 9783161526367}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Accounts of the living Christ being seen laughing alongside, or above, the crucifixion are also found in two second/third century Gnostic texts in the [[Nag Hammadi Library]]; the [[Gnostic Apocalypse of Peter|Apocalypse of Peter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Brashler|first=James A. |title=Introduction to the Apocalypse of Peter in ''The Nag Hammadi Library in English''; James M. Robinson ed. |year=1984 |publisher=Brill |pages=339|isbn = 9004071857}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Ehrman|first=Bart |title=Lost Christianities|year=2005 |publisher=OUP |pages=185–187|isbn = 0195182499}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The [[Second Treatise of the Great Seth]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Gibbons|first=Joseph A. |title=Introduction to the Second Treatise of the Great Seth; in ''The Nag Hammadi Library in English''; James M.

Winrich Löhr infers that a common mid-second century gospel tradition (which he nevertheless doubts as originating with Basilides himself) must underlie both the Irenaeus notice and the two [[Nag Hammadi texts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Löhr|first=Winrich A. |title=Basilides und seine Schule|year=1995 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |pages=255–273|isbn = 9783161463006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna of Russia, [[Tsesarevna]] of Russia''' ('''Anna Petrovna Romanova''') {{lang-ru|Анна Петровна}}; 27 January 1708, in Moscow &amp;ndash; 4 March 1728, in [[Kiel]]) was the elder daughter of Emperor [[Peter I of Russia]] and Empress [[Catherine I of Russia]]. Her sister, [[Elizabeth of Russia]], ruled as Empress between 1741 and 1762. While a potential heir in the reign of her father and her mother, she never acceded to the throne due to political reasons. However, her son [[Peter III of Russia|Peter]] would rule as Emperor in 1762, succeeding Elizabeth. She was the ''[[Duchess of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp]]'' by marriage.

==Early life==
Anna was born out of [[Marriage|wedlock]], although her parents were married in 1712 and she was later legitimized. Her earlier illegitimacy would pose great challenges for her marriage.

Anna grew up in the houses of Peter’s younger sister [[Tsarevna Natalya Alexeyevna of Russia|Natalia]] and Prince [[Alexander Danilovich Menshikov|Alexander Menshikov]]. Although born illegitimate, she and her younger sister Elizabeth were awarded the titles of “[[princess]]” (''[[tsarevna]]'') on 6 March 1711 and “[[crown prince]]ss” (''[[Tsesarevich|tsesarevna]]'') on 23 December 1721.

Peter planned to marry his daughters to foreign princes in order to gain European allies for the Russian Empire. The two girls were educated with this aim in mind, learning literature, writing, embroidery, dancing and etiquette. Anna developed into an intelligent, well-read girl who spoke four foreign languages – French, German, Italian and Swedish.

Anna’s shyness was evident at an early age. One witness describes the amusing hitch that once occurred during the traditional exchanging of Easter kisses. When the duke of Holstein-Gottorp tried to kiss the fourteen-year-old Anna, she turned bright red in embarrassment, while her younger sister “immediately stuck out her little pink mouth for a kiss.”

Foreign visitors to the Russian court were struck by the uncommon beauty of Anna. The dark-eyed Anna looked more like her father and was considered more level-headed and intelligent than her younger sister, the fair-haired Elizabeth. A contemporary described Anna: “She was a beautiful soul in a beautiful body ... both in appearance and in manners, she was [her father’s] complete likeness, particularly in her character and mind ... set off by her kind heart.”

==Marriage==
On 17 March 1721, Karl Friedrich arrived in [[Imperial Russia]] to get acquainted with his future wife and father-in-law. He aspired to use the marriage in order to ensure Russia's support for his plans of retrieving [[Schleswig]] from Denmark. He also entertained hopes of being backed up by Russia in his claims to the Swedish throne. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Nystad]] Russia promised not to interfere in the internal affairs of Sweden, so his hopes proved ill-founded.

Another possible candidate as a husband was a grandson of [[Louis XIV of France]] and [[Madame de Montespan]], [[Louis d'Orléans, Duke of Orléans|Louis Duke of Orleans]] - the son of the [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Regent of France]] for the infant [[Louis XV of France]]. The marriage proposal was ignored due to a difference in style of address. Anna was addressed as Her [[Imperial Highness]] and Louis was as His [[Serene Highness]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

As a favorite child of Peter the Great, Anna's [[name day]] (3 February) was taken to be a national holiday in 1724.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Reforms of Peter the Great: Progress Through Coercion in Russia|last = Anisimov|first = Evgeniĭ Viktorovich|publisher = M.E. Sharpe|year = 1993|isbn = 9781563240478|location = |pages = 209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 November 1724, the marriage contract was signed between Karl Friedrich and Peter. By this contract, Anna and Karl Friedrich renounced all rights and claims to the crown of the Russian Empire on behalf of themselves and their descendants. However a secret clause allowed the Emperor to name a successor out of any sons from the marriage. As a result of this clause, the Emperor secured the right to name any of his descendants as his successor on the Russian throne.

A few months thereafter, by January 1725, Peter the Great fell mortally ill. As the story goes, on his deathbed he managed to spell the words: ''to give all...'', but could not continue further and sent for Anna to dictate his last will to her. By the time the princess arrived, the Emperor could not pronounce a single word. Based on the story, some historians speculated that Peter's wish was to leave the throne to Anna, but this is not confirmed.

== Catherine I ==
After the accession of her mother Catherine I, a grand wedding was held for Anna in Trinity Cathedral, St Petersburg on 21 May 1725. The wedding party then crossed the River Neva to the Summer Garden, where [[Mikhail Zemtsov]] had designed a special banqueting hall for the occasion.

The tables were set with all sorts of delicacies, including enormous pies. When the orchestra began to play, male and female [[dwarfism|dwarves]] jumped out of the pies and began to dance on the tables. Each toast was accompanied by cannon fire from a nearby yacht and the guards regiments positioned on Tsaritsa Meadow. The following day, everyone was invited to Peterhof, where the banqueting and dancing continued in the Upper Palace.

Carl Friedrich and Anna spent the next two years in St Petersburg. Catherine I made her son-in-law a lieutenant colonel of the Preobrazhensky Regiment and a member of the Supreme Privy Council. He began to play an important role in the life of the Russian Empire and foreign diplomats predicted that the empress would name Anna as her successor.

The Duke was admitted into the newly established Supreme Secret Council and exerted a moderate influence on Russian politics. Catherine I's death in 1727 made his position precarious, as the power shifted to the hands of [[Alexander Danilovich Menshikov|Alexander Menshikov]], who aspired to marry the young emperor, [[Peter II of Russia|Peter II]], to his own daughter, Maria Menshikov. A quarrel between the Duke and Menshikov resulted in the former's withdrawing to [[Holstein]] on 25 July 1727.

Before her departure for Holstein, Anna was asked to sign a receipt for all the money awarded to her as her dowry. For a long time, the document was not accepted by the government, because it gave the old title of Peter’s daughter – '''Tsesarevna '(''crown princess of Russia). Now, she was neither Russian nor a crown princess.

== Kiel ==
On 25 July 1727, Anna and her husband left St Petersburg for [[Kiel]]. When they arrived in the capital of [[Holstein]], the duke underwent a personality change. Merry and gallant in St Petersburg, he was now a rude, drunken boor. He spent his time in the rowdy company of friends and other women, leaving his wife, now pregnant, entirely on her own.

In Kiel, Anna would spend her days writing long, tearful letters to her sister [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]]. Semyon Mordvinov, a lieutenant in the Russian navy, remembers Anna crying bitterly when she gave him her mail to take back to Russia. In one such letter to Elizabeth, she writes: “Not a day passes without my weeping for you, my dear sister!”

==Birth of Peter III and death==

On 21 February 1728, Anna gave birth in [[Kiel Castle]] to a son named Carl Peter Ulrich, the future [[Peter III of Russia]]. Peter would go on to be the future Emperor of Russia and found the [[House of Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov]] that would go on to rule Russia until the early 20th-century. A few days after his birth, the barely twenty-year-old duchess caught [[puerperal fever]] ([[postpartum infection]]) and died on 4 March 1728. In memory of his wife, Carl Friedrich founded the [[Order of St Anna]], which subsequently became a Russian decoration.

Before her death, Anna Petrovna had asked to be buried alongside her father in St Petersburg. Two ships, the ''Raphael'' and the ''Cruiser'', were dispatched to Kiel for Anna’s body. The coffin was transported up the River Neva on a galley, with long black crape hanging overboard, trailing in the water. On 12 November 1728, Anna was laid to rest next to her parents in the still unfinished St Peter and St Paul Cathedral.

== Issue ==
Through her marriage with the Duke Karl Friedrich, she had one son
* [[Peter III of Russia|Peter Feodorovich of Holstein-Gottorp]] (21 February 1728 &amp;ndash; 17 July 1762). In 1739, Peter's father died, and he became Duke of Holstein-Gottorp as Karl Peter Ulrich. He could thus be considered the heir to both thrones (Russia and Sweden). After the death of his aunt, [[Elizabeth of Russia]], he ruled over the [[Russian Empire]] as ''Peter III, Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias'' and was the husband of [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great of Russia]]. Through him, Anna became ancestress to all subsequent rulers of Russia except Catherine II (her daughter-in-law).

==Legacy==
*The Order of St. Anna (or "Order of Saint Ann"; Russian: Орден святой Анны) was a Holstein and then Russian order of chivalry established by Anna's husband on 14 February 1735, in honor of Anna. The motto of the Order was "Amantibus Justitiam, Pietatem, Fidem" ("To those who love justice, piety, and fidelity"). Its festival day was 3 February.

[[File:Morgan House Kalimpong 2.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Morgan House, Kalimpong|Morgan House]] is a colonial era mansion in [[Kalimpong]] considered to be one of the most haunted locations in [[India]].]]
In [[ghostlore]], a '''haunted house''' or '''ghosthouse''' is a house or other building often perceived as being inhabited by disembodied [[ghost|spirit]]s of the [[Death|deceased]] who may have been former residents or were familiar with the property. [[Parapsychologists]] attribute haunting to the spirits of the dead and the effect of violent or tragic events in the building's past such as [[murder]], accidental death, or [[suicide]].&lt;ref name="Watts2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Watts |first=Linda S. |title=Encyclopedia of American Folklore |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2dce6_CA76MC&amp;pg=PA192 |accessdate=10 May 2012 |year=2007 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=978-1-4381-2979-2 |pages=192–}}&lt;/ref&gt; More scientific explanations for the perception that a house is haunted include misinterpreting noises naturally present in structures, waking dreams, suggestibility, and the effect of [[Toxicant|toxic substances]] in environments that can cause [[Hallucination|hallucinations]].

In a 2005, [[Gallup poll]], 37 percent of Americans, 28 percent of Canadians, and 40 percent of Britons expressed the belief that houses could be "haunted".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/19558/Paranormal-Beliefs-Come-SuperNaturally-Some.aspx |title=Paranormal Beliefs Come (Super)Naturally to Some |last=Lyons |first=Linda |date=1 November 2005 |work=[[Gallup Poll]] |publisher=[[Gallup Organization|Gallup]] |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/16915/Three-Four-Americans-Believe-Paranormal.aspx |title=Three in Four Americans Believe in Paranormal |last=Moore |first=David W. |date=16 June 2005 |work=[[Gallup Poll]] |publisher=[[Gallup Organization|Gallup]] |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to science writer [[Terence Hines]], cold spots, creaking sounds, and odd noises are typically present in any home, especially older ones, and "such noises can easily be mistaken for the sound of footsteps by those inclined to imagine the presence of a deceased tenant in their home."&lt;ref name="Hines1988"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hines |first=Terence |title=Pseudoscience and the paranormal: a critical examination of the evidence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bP1-AAAAMAAJ |year=1988 |publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=978-0-87975-419-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Turner, a retired chemist, suggested that [[ball lightning]] could cause inanimate objects to move erratically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Muir |first=Hazel |title=Ball lightning scientists remain in the dark |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn1720 |publisher=New Scientist |date=2001-12-20 |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptical investigator [[Joe Nickell]] writes that in most cases he investigated, he found plausible explanations for haunting phenomena, such as physical illusions, waking dreams, and the effects of memory. According to Nickell, the power of suggestion along with [[confirmation bias]] plays a large role in perceived hauntings. He states that as a house, inn, or other place becomes thought of as haunted, more and more ghostly encounters are reported and that when people are given to expect paranormal events, they tend to notice those conditions that would confirm their expectations.&lt;ref name=CSI&gt;{{cite web|last=Nickell|first=Joe|authorlink=Joe Nickell|title=Catching Ghosts|url=http://www.csicop.org/sb/show/catching_ghosts/|work=June 2008|publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toxicologist Albert Donnay believes that chronic exposure to substances such as [[carbon monoxide]], [[pesticide]], and [[formaldehyde]] can lead to hallucinations of the type associated with haunted houses. Donnay speculates on the connection between the prevalence of [[gas lamps]] during the [[Victorian era]] and start of the 20th century stories of ghost sightings and hauntings, describing it as the "Haunted House Syndrome".&lt;ref name="Jenkins2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=McKay Jenkins|title=What's Gotten Into Us?: Staying Healthy in a Toxic World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6puJRhCU7rAC&amp;pg=PA61|accessdate=10 May 2012|date=19 April 2011|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4000-6803-6|pages=61–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donnay says that [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] has been linked to haunted houses since at least the 1920s, citing a 1921 journal article published about a family who suffered headaches, auditory hallucinations, fatigue, melancholy, and other symptoms associated with haunted houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glass|authorlink=Ira Glass|first=Ira|title=And the Call Was Coming from the Basement|url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/319/and-the-call-was-coming-from-the-basement|work=This American Life|publisher=Public Radio International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Persinger]], Jason Braithewaite, and others, suggested that perceived apparitions, cold spots, and ghostly touches are perceptual anomalies caused by variations in naturally occurring or man-made magnetic fields.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Persinger &amp; Stanley A. Koren, "Predicting the Characteristics of Haunt Phenomena from Geomagnetic Factors and Brain Sensitivity: Evidence from Field and Experimental Studies", in ''Hauntings and Poltergeists: Multidisciplinary Perspectives'', ed.

Psychology Professor Frank McAndrew ([[Francis T. McAndrew]]) explains what environmental psychologists call "legibility - the ease with which a place can be recognized, organized into a pattern and recalled" and how a typical haunted house may have a confusing layout and be quite the opposite of legibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=McAndrew |first1=Frank T.|authorlink=Francis T.

==Commercial haunted houses==
{{further|Haunted attraction (simulated)}}
The concept of the haunted house was capitalized on as early as 1915 with the Orton and Spooner Haunted House in [[Hollycombe Steam Collection]] ([[England]]),&lt;ref name=Hollycombe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steamfairground.co.uk/l3_haunted_house.html |title=Haunted House (1915) |publisher=Hollycombe Working Steam Museum |accessdate=29 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425200741/http://www.steamfairground.co.uk/l3_haunted_house.html |archivedate=April 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the 1970s, commercial haunted houses had sprung up all over the United States in cities like  [[Louisville, Kentucky]] and [[Cincinnati]], Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vintage - The HOUSEOFDOOM|url=http://www.houseofdoom.net/vintage|work=Vintage|publisher=Vintage|accessdate= November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2005, an estimated 3,500 to 5,000 professional haunted attractions operated in the United States.&lt;ref name=msnbc.msn.com&gt;{{cite web |last=The Associated Press |title=Haunted house business getting frightfully hard. 'Scaring people is easy,' but making money at it a lot harder |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9855272/ns/business-small_business/t/haunted-house-business-getting-frightfully-hard/#.UBfjLkQZFGE |work=10/30/2005 |publisher=msnbc.msn.com |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, around the time of [[Hallowtide]], many Christian churches run a type of haunted house known as a [[hell house]], which while being a haunted house, also promotes their interpretation of the Christian [[Good News (Christianity)|gospel message]]. According to ''[[USA Today]]'', in hell houses, "participants walk through several 'scenes' depicting the consequences of things like abortion, homosexuality and drunkenness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/religion/2007-10-26-hell-house_N.htm|title=Some Christians use 'Hell Houses' to reach out on Halloween - USATODAY.com|work=usatoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal aspects==
In the case ''[[Stambovsky v. Ackley]]'', the [[Supreme Court of New York]], Appellate Division ruled in 1991 that a seller must disclose that a house has a reputation for being haunted when there is a fiduciary relationship or in cases of fraud or misrepresentation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Knauf |first=Allan |title=After New York's Property Condition Disclosure Act |url=http://www.nyenvlaw.com/Caveat_Emptor.htm |accessdate=15 February 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061125183626/http://www.nyenvlaw.com/Caveat_Emptor.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=26 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; because such a reputation impairs the value of the house:
{{quote|In the case at bar, defendant seller deliberately fostered the public belief that her home was possessed. Having undertaken to inform the public at large, to whom she has no legal relationship, about the supernatural occurrences on her property, she may be said to owe no less a duty to her contract vendee.&lt;ref&gt;''Stambovsky v. Ackley'', 169 A.D.2d 254, 260, 572 N.Y.S.2d 672, N.Y.A.D. 1 Dept., 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Short stories and novels==
[[Legend]]s about haunted houses have long appeared in literature. The earliest surviving report of a haunted house comes from a letter written by [[Pliny the Younger]] (61 – c. 112) to his patron Lucias Sura, in which he describes a haunted villa in Athens.{{sfnp|Fielding|O'Keeffe|2011|loc=An Introduction to Haunting Phenomena}} Nobody would live in the house until the philosopher [[Athenodoros Cananites|Athenodorus]] (c.74 BCE – 7 CE) arrived in the city. He was tempted by the low rent and undeterred by the house's reputation so he moved in. The ghost, an old man bound with chains, appeared to Athenodrus during the first night, and beckoned to the philosopher. The apparition vanished once it reached the courtyard, and Athenodrus carefully marked the spot. The following morning he requested the magistrate to have the spot dug up, where the skeleton of an old man bound with chains was discovered. The ghost never appeared again after the skeleton was given a proper burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pliny the Younger |title=Letters, by Pliny the Younger; translated by William Melmoth; revised by F. C. T. Bosanquet. |editor=Charles W. Eliot |publisher=P. F. Collier &amp; Son |date=1909–14 |series=The Harvard Classics |volume=9 |chapter=LXXXIII. To Sura |url=http://www.bartleby.com/9/4/1083.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stories of haunted houses are also included in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'', as in the tale of "[[List of stories within One Thousand and One Nights|Ali the Cairene and the Haunted House in Baghdad]]";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Arabian Nights and Orientalism: Perspectives from East &amp; West |last=Yuriko Yamanaka |first=Tetsuo Nishio |publisher=[[I.B. Tauris]] |year=2006 |isbn=1-85043-768-8 |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; more modern authors from [[Henry James]] to [[Stephen King]] have also featured them in their writings.

Haunting is used as a [[plot device]] in [[gothic fiction|gothic]] or [[horror fiction]] or, more lately, paranormal fiction; haunted castles and mansions are common in [[gothic literature]]. Notable works of fiction featuring haunted houses include:

In 1960, animal trainer [[Frank Inn]] found the dog at the [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] Animal Shelter as a puppy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.burbankleader.com/2001-09-08/news/export12814_1_frank-inn-burbank-animal-shelter-ryan-carter|title='Benji' began in Burbank|work=tribunedigital-burbankleader|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/04/nyregion/frank-inn-who-trained-lassie-and-benji-is-dead-at-86.html|title=Frank Inn, Who Trained Lassie and Benji, Is Dead at 86|last=Martin|first=Douglas|date=2002-08-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fluffy black-and-tan [[mixed breed dog]], he was marked like a [[Border Terrier]], and Inn believed him to be a mix of [[Miniature Poodle]], [[Cocker Spaniel]], and [[Schnauzer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/31/archives/benji-a-doghouse-hero.html|title=‘Benji,’ a Doghouse Hero|last=Bender|first=Marylin|date=1975-08-31|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/10573542|title=The animals' who's who : 1,146 celebrated animals in history, popular culture, literature, and lore|last=Ruthven.|first=Tremain,|date=1982|publisher=Routledge &amp; K.

===Career===
[[File:Petticoat Junction.jpg|thumb|left|270px|&lt;center&gt;Higgins with the cast of TV's&lt;br&gt;''[[Petticoat Junction]]'' (1966)]]

Higgins' career was facilitated by [[Frank Inn]], who also trained [[Arnold Ziffel]] (the pig) and all of the other animals used on ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'', ''[[Green Acres]]'', and ''[[The Waltons]]'' TV series. His on-set assistant trainers included Gerry Warshauer and Karl Miller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.li/8PfBi|title=Petticoat Junction - Linda Henning w/ Higgins at the Patsy Awards|date=2002-08-07|work=archive.li|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an actor, Higgins first came to national attention as the uncredited dog who played the character of "Dog" on the television sitcom ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'' for six of the show's seven seasons, from 1964 to 1970, appearing in 149 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/27146845|title=The Hooterville handbook : a viewer's guide to Green acres|last=1966-|first=Cox, Stephen,|date=1993|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=9780312088118|edition= 1st|location=New York|oclc=27146845}}&lt;/ref&gt; He guest-appeared on the television sitcom ''[[Green Acres]]'' with [[Eva Gabor]] in 1965 and also made a guest appearance on the television sitcom ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]''. He won a [[Patsy Award]] in 1967, and he was cover-featured on an issue of [[TV Guide]] magazine.

Higgins was able to convey a broad range of emotions through his facial expressions. Inn, who trained thousands of animals of many species during his lifetime, told reporters that Higgins was the smartest dog he had ever worked with and noted that during his prime years in television, he learned one new trick or routine per week and retained these routines from year to year, making it possible for him to take on increasingly varied and complex roles. Higgins's tricks included yawning and sneezing on cue. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/869266470|title=Animal stars : behind the scenes with your favorite animal actors|last=Robin,|first=Ganzert,|publisher=|others=Anderson, Allen, 1954-, Anderson, Linda C., 1946-|year=|isbn=9781608682645|location=Notavo, California|pages=220|oclc=869266470}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65400365|title=1,001 reasons to love dogs|last=Christine.|first=Miele,|date=2006|publisher=Stewart Tabori &amp; Chang|others=Tiegreen, Mary.|isbn=9781584795261|location=New York|oclc=65400365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his work in [[Petticoat Junction|''Petticoat Junction'']], Higgins received a [[PATSY Award]] in 1966 in the television category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.animalhealthfoundation.net/magazines/ac9-10-1973.pdf|title=1973 PATSY Awards|last=Harris|first=Norene|date=September-October 1973|work=Animal Cavalcade (Official Journal of the Animal Health Foundation)|accessdate=November 26, 2018|issue=Issue 5|volume=Volume 4|pages=24-25}} Additional , December 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Higgins starred in the film ''[[Mooch Goes to Hollywood]]'' with [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]] and [[Vincent Price]]. He came out of retirement at an estimated age of 16&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/869266470|title=Animal stars : behind the scenes with your favorite animal actors|last=Robin,|first=Ganzert,|publisher=|others=Anderson, Allen, 1954-, Anderson, Linda C., 1946-|year=|isbn=9781608682638|location=Notavo, California|pages=219-220|oclc=869266470}}&lt;/ref&gt; to star in the 1974 feature film ''[[Benji (1974 film)|Benji]]'', which became his greatest commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://books.google.com.br/books?id=1iwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=%22upwardly+mogul%22+%22Move+over,+Hollywood.+Make+way+for+Joe+Camp.%22&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPiOawjsLaAhUEG5AKHYBVBVcQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22upwardly%20mogul%22%20%22Move%20over%2C%20Hollywood.%20Make%20way%20for%20Joe%20Camp.%22&amp;f=false|title=Upwardly Mogul [November 1976]|last=Greene|first=A.

===Personal life===
====Friends====
Higgins had a close rapport with the actor [[Edgar Buchanan]], who played Uncle Joe Carson on ''Petticoat Junction.'' In the official cast pictures taken each year during the run of ''Petticoat Junction,'' Buchanan is shown holding or petting Higgins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730111412/http://petticoat.topcities.com:80/season2.htm|title=Petticoat Junction - Cast Photo - Season Two|date=2012-07-30|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730111537/http://petticoat.topcities.com:80/season3.htm|title=Petticoat Junction - Cast Photo - Season Three|date=2012-07-30|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730111537/http://petticoat.topcities.com:80/season5.htm|title=Petticoat Junction - Cast Photo - Season Five|date=2012-07-30|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buchanan guest-starred on 17 episodes of the sitcom ''Green Acres'', and Higgins guest-starred in two of those appearances. Buchanan and Higgins crossed paths for the last time in ''Benji'', which was coincidentally also the last film that both actors starred in. The two actors had an obvious fondness for one another, which is especially clear in ''Benji,'' because the movie's naturalistic pacing allowed them to interact as friends rather than requiring that Higgins perform a specific trick for Buchanan to react to.

Frank Inn and Higgins were very close in real life as well as on the job. Inn wrote a poem about the dog called ''My Little Brown Dog''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://petticoat.topcities.com/frankinn.htm#my%20little%20brown%20dog|archive-url=https://archive.is/20050308174105/http://petticoat.topcities.com/frankinn.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2005-03-08|title=Petticoat Junction - Frank Inn (Freeman)|work=topcities.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Family====
Higgins' progeny carried on his work in a continuing series of movies and television series featuring the [[Benji|Benji character]], beginning with ''[[For the Love of Benji]]'' in 1977, in which Higgins' daughter Benjean inherited the role of Benji after Higgins' death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.benji.com/FAQ.htm|title=Benji superstar acting dog FAQ's|work=benji.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benjean]], who was also trained by Frank Inn, starred in more ''Benji'' movies than Higgins did because she was younger when she first took on the role. Benjean can be differentiated from Higgins by the fact that she was a female with no visible genitalia, and she had a large patch of white hairs on her muzzle around her nose, whereas Higgins was mostly black around his nose. In addition, Higgins’ bark was a deep, froggy sound, while Benjean had a higher-pitched, more traditional-sounding yelp. This is readily apparent when comparing ''Benji'' and ''For the Love of Benji''.

Confusion between the two dogs was increased when VHS and DVD videos of the original ''Benji'' movie were released with pictures of Benjean on the cover.

Also, the dog "Tramp" from the TV series ''[[My Three Sons]]'' was one of Higgins' puppies; his real-life name was "Mac".

====Death====
Higgins died at age 17, just four weeks short of his 18th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dogs-in-history.blogspot.com.br/2017/07/higgins-from-shelter-dog-to-beloved.html|title=Famous Dogs in History: Higgins: From Shelter Dog to Beloved Benji|last=Diana|date=2017-07-30|website=Famous Dogs in History|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inn had the dog's body cremated and saved the ashes in an urn on his mantelpiece. He then wrote a Christian poem in memory of Higgins called ''My Gift to Jesus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://petticoat.topcities.com/frankinn.htm#my%20gift%20to%20jesus|archive-url=https://archive.is/20050308174105/http://petticoat.topcities.com/frankinn.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2005-03-08|title=Petticoat Junction - Frank Inn (Freeman)|work=topcities.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/982604562|title=Chiens Celebres, Réels et Fictifs, dans l'Art, la Culture et l'Histoire.|last=de Lavigne|first=Guillaume|date=2015|publisher=Lulu.com|year=|isbn=9781326035655|location=[S.l.]|pages=381|oclc=982604562}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inn died in 2002 and requested that Higgins' ashes be buried in his coffin with him.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This request was not fulfilled due to legal reasons,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/07/27/155949615/the-trainer-who-created-four-legged-stars|title=The Trainer Who Created Four-Legged Stars|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/869266470|title=Animal stars : behind the scenes with your favorite animal actors|last=Robin,|first=Ganzert,|publisher=|others=Anderson, Allen, 1954-, Anderson, Linda C., 1946-|year=|isbn=9781608682645|location=Notavo, California|pages=222|oclc=869266470}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Higgins' ashes remain with Inn's daughters.

'''Infidel''' (literally "unfaithful") is a term used in certain [[religion]]s for those accused of unbelief in the central tenets of their own religion, for members of another religion, or for the [[irreligion|irreligious]].&lt;ref&gt;See:
* James Ginther (2009), The Westminster Handbook to Medieval Theology, Westminster, {{ISBN|978-0664223977}}, Quote = "Infidel literally means unfaithful";

Infidel is an [[ecclesiastical]] term in [[Christianity]] around which the Church developed a body of theology that deals with the concept of infidelity, which makes a clear differentiation between those who were [[baptized]] and followed the teachings of the Church versus those who are outside the [[faith]].&lt;ref name="IESS"&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3045301127.html| title = "Infidels." ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. 2008''|publisher = MacMillan Library Reference|accessdate = 2010-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''infidel'' was used by Christians to describe those perceived as the enemies of Christianity.

After the ancient world the concept of otherness, an exclusionary notion of the outside by societies with more or less coherent cultural boundaries, became associated with the development of the monotheistic and prophetic religions of [[Judaism]], Christianity and Islam (cf. [[pagan]]).&lt;ref name="IESS"/&gt;

==Etymology==
The origins of the word infidel date to the late 15th century, deriving from the [[French language|French]] ''infidèle'' or [[Latin]] ''īnfidēlis'', from ''in-'' "not" + ''fidēlis'' "faithful" (from ''[[wikt:fides|fidēs]]'' "faith", related to ''fīdere'' 'to trust'). The word originally denoted a person of a religion other than one's own, especially a Christian to a Muslim, a Muslim to a Christian, or a [[gentile]] to a Jew.&lt;ref name="Infidel-Oxford"/&gt; Later meanings in the 15th century include "unbelieving", "a non-Christian" and "one who does not believe in religion" (1527).

==Usage==
Christians historically used the term infidel to refer to people who actively opposed Christianity. This term became well-established in English by sometime in the early sixteenth century, when Jews or Mohammedans (Muslims; formerly called [[saracen]]s), were described contemptuously as active opponents to Christianity. In [[Dogma in the Catholic Church|Catholic dogma]], an infidel is one who does not believe in the doctrine at all and is thus distinct from a [[heresy|heretic]], who has [[Lapsed Catholic|fallen away]] from true doctrine, i.e. by denying the [[divinity of Jesus]].

Shaw, Peter M. J. Stravinskas, ''Our Sunday Visitor's Catholic Encyclopedia'', [[Our Sunday Visitor Publishing]], 1998, {{ISBN|0-87973-669-0}} p. 535.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some apologists have argued in favor of the term, stating that it does not come from a disrespectful perspective, but is similar to using the term ''[[orthodoxy|orthodox]]'' for devout believers.&lt;ref name="Orthodox"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8TYrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA188&amp;dq=infidel+usage&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ULjDTd3GOMLi0QGh4dSJCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=infidel%20usage&amp;f=false| title = Infidel Testimony|publisher = J.E. Dixon|quote=When we use the word ''infidel'', we intend nothing disrespectful, any more than we do when we use the word ''orthodox''.|accessdate = 2007-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, some translations of the [[Bible]], including the [[King James Version]], which is still in vogue today, employ the word ''infidel'', while others have supplanted the term with ''nonbeliever''. The term is found in two places:
{{quotation|And what concord hath [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] with [[Belial]]? Or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?  —[[2 Corinthians]] 6:15 KJV}}
{{quotation|But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the [[Faith in Christianity|faith]], and is worse than an infidel. —[[1 Timothy]] 5:8 KJV}}

==Infidels under canon law==
===Right to rule===
In ''Quid super his'', [[Innocent IV]], asked the question "[I]s it licit to invade a land that infidels possess or which belongs to them?" and held that while Infidels had a right to ''dominium'' (right to rule themselves and choose their own governments), however the [[pope]], as the [[Vicar]] of [[Christ]], ''de jure'' possessed the care of their [[soul]]s and had the right to politically intervene in their affairs if their ruler violated or allowed his subjects to violate a Christian and Euro-centric normative conception of [[Natural law#Christian natural law|Natural law]], such as sexual perversion or idolatry.&lt;ref name=williams-48&gt;Williams, p.48&lt;/ref&gt; He also held that he had an obligation to send [[missionaries]] to infidel lands, and that if they were prevented from entering or preaching, then the pope was justified in dispatching Christian forces accompanied with missionaries to invade those lands, as Innocent stated simply "If the infidels do not obey, they ought to be compelled by the secular arm and war may be declared upon them by the pope, and nobody else."&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; This was however not a reciprocal right and non-Christian missionaries such as those of Muslims could not be allowed to preach in Europe "because they are in error and we are on a righteous path."&lt;ref name=williams-48/&gt;

A long line of Papal hierocratic canonists, most notably those who adhered to Alanus Anglicus's influential arguments of the Crusading-era, denied Infidel dominium, and asserted [[Rome]]'s universal jurisdictional authority over the earth, and the right to authorize pagan conquests solely on the basis of non-belief because of their rejection of the Christian god.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, pp. 41, 61–64&lt;/ref&gt; In the extreme hierocractic canonical discourse of the mid-twelfth century such as that espoused by Bernard of Clairvaux, the mystic leader of the Cisertcians, legitimized [[Holy Roman Empire|German]] colonial expansion and practice of forceful [[Christianisation]] in the [[Slavic Europe|Slavic territories]] as a [[religious war|holy war]] against the [[Wends]], arguing that infidels should be killed wherever they posed a menace to Christians. When [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick the II]] unilaterally arrogated papal authority, he took on the mantle to "destroy convert, and subjugate all barbarian nations." A power in papal doctrine reserved for the pope. Hostiensis, a student of Innocent, in accord with Alanus, also asserted "... by law infidels should be subject to the faithful." [[John Wyclif]], regarded as the forefather of [[English Reformation]], also held that valid ''dominium'' rested on a state of [[Divine grace|grace]].&lt;ref name=williams-61&gt;Williams, pp. 61–64&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Teutonic Knights]] were one of the by-products of this papal hierocratic and German discourse. After the [[Crusades]] in the [[Levant]], they moved to crusading activities in the infidel [[Baltics]]. Their crusades against the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuanians]] and [[History of Poland (1385–1569)|Poles]] however precipitated the Lithuanian Controversy, and the [[Council of Constance]], following the condemnation of Wyclif, found Hostiensis's views no longer acceptable and ruled against the knights. Future Church doctrine was then firmly aligned with Innocents IV's position.&lt;ref name=williams-64&gt;Williams, pp. 64–67&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of counter arguments later on the validity of Papal authority, the rights of infidels and the primacy of [[natural law]], led to various treatises such as those by [[Hugo Grotius]], [[John Locke]], [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]], which in turn led to the transformation of [[international law]]'s treatment of the relationship between Christian and non-Christian societies and the development of [[human rights]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

====Colonization of the Americas====
During the [[Age of Discovery]], the [[papal bull]]s such as ''[[Romanus Pontifex]]'' and more importantly ''[[inter caetera]]'' (1493), implicitly removed ''dominium'' from infidels and granted them to the [[Spanish Empire]] and [[Portugal]] with the charter of guaranteeing the safety of missionaries. Subsequent English and French rejections of the bull rejected the Popes authority to exclude other Christian princes. As independent authorities such as the Head of the [[Church of England]], they drew up [[charter]]s for their own [[Colonialism|colonial]] [[Mission (Christian)|mission]]s based on the temporal right for care of infidel souls in language echoing the inter caetera. The charters and papal bulls would form the legal basis of future negotiations and consideration of claims as [[title deed]]s in the emerging [[Law of nations]] in the [[European colonization of the Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher 31-40&lt;/ref&gt;

The rights bestowed by ''Romanus Pontifex'' and ''inter caetera'' have never fallen from use, serving as the basis for legal arguments over the centuries. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in the 1823 case ''[[Johnson v. M'Intosh]] ''that as a result of European discovery and assumption of ultimate dominion, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] had only a right to occupancy of native lands, not the right of title. This decision was upheld in the 1831 case ''[[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]]'', giving Georgia authority to extend state laws over [[Cherokee]]s within the state, and famously describing Native American tribes as "domestic dependent nations." This decision was modified in ''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]'', which stated that the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]], and not individual [[U.S. state|states]], had authority in Indian affairs, but it maintained the loss of right to title upon discovery by Europeans.

Native American groups including the [[Taíno people|Taíno]] and [[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]] have called on the [[Holy See|Vatican]] to revoke the bulls of 1452, 1453, and 1493.

===Marriage===
According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], the Catholic Church views [[Catholic marriage|marriage]] as forbidden and null when conducted between the faithful (Christians) and infidels, unless a [[Dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensation]] has been granted. This is because marriage is a [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacrament of the Catholic Church]], which infidels are deemed incapable of receiving.&lt;ref name="catenc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08002b.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Infidels |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1910-10-01 |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a philosophical tradition==
Some [[Philosophy|philosophers]] such as [[Thomas Paine]], [[David Hume]], [[George Holyoake]], [[Charles Bradlaugh]], [[Voltaire]] and [[Rousseau]] earned the label of infidel or [[Freethought|freethinkers]], both personally and for their respective traditions of thought because of their attacks on religion and opposition to the Church. They established and participated in a distinctly labeled, infidel movement or tradition of thought, that sought to reform their societies which were steeped in Christian thought, practice, laws and culture. The Infidel tradition was distinct from parallel anti-Christian, sceptic or deist movements, in that it was anti-theistic and also synonymous with atheism. These traditions also sought to set up various independent model communities, as well as societies, whose traditions then gave rise to various other socio-political movements such as [[secularism]] in 1851, as well as developing close philosophical ties to some contemporary political movements such as [[socialism]] and the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Royle"&gt;Royle, Edwards, "Victorian Infidels: The Origins of the British Secularist Movement 1791–1866", Manchester University Press, {{ISBN|0-7190-0557-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the early twentieth century, these movements sought to move away from the tag "infidel" because of its associate negative connotation in Christian thought, and is attributed to George Holyoake's coining the term 'secularism' in an attempt to bridge the gap with other theist and Christian liberal reform movements.&lt;ref name = "Royle"/&gt;

In 1793, Immanuel Kant's ''[[Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason]]'', reflected the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] periods' philosophical development, one which differentiated between the moral and rational and substituted rational/irrational for the original true believer/infidel distinction.&lt;ref name="IESS"/&gt;

==Implications for medieval civil law==
Laws passed by the Catholic Church governed not just the laws between Christians and infidels in matters of religious affairs, but also civil affairs. They were prohibited from participating or aiding in infidel religious rites, such as [[circumcision]]s or wearing images of non-Christian religious significance.&lt;ref name="catenc"/&gt;

In the [[Early Middle Ages]], based on the idea of the superiority of Christians to infidels, regulations came into place such as those forbidding Jews from possessing Christian [[slave]]s; the laws of the [[decretal]]s further forbade Christians from entering the service of Jews, for Christian women to act as their nurses or midwives; forbidding Christians from employing Jewish physicians when ill; restricting Jews to definite quarters of the towns into which they were admitted and to wear a dress by which they might be recognized.&lt;ref name="catenc"/&gt;

Later during the Victorian era, testimony of either self declared, or those accused of being Infidels or Atheists, was not accepted in a [[court]] of law because it was felt that they had no moral imperative to not lie under [[oath]] because they did not believe in God, or [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]].&lt;ref name = "Royle"/&gt;

These rules have now given way to modern [[legislation]] and Catholics, in civil life, are no longer governed by ecclesiastical law.&lt;ref name="catenc"/&gt;

One [[Arabic language]] analogue to ''infidel'', referring to non-Muslims, is ''[[kafir]]'' (sometimes "kaafir", "kufr" or "kuffar";  [[giaour|gâvur]] in [[Turkish Language|Turkish]],) from the root [[K-P-R]], which connotes covering or concealing.&lt;ref&gt;Ruthven M.

"''Islam'' An infidel."; Also: "Kaffir" - Arabic kāfir "unbeliever, infidel", Encarta World English Dictionary [North American Edition], Microsoft Corporation, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Another term, sometimes used synonymously, is ''[[Shirk (Islam)|mushrik]]'', "[[polytheist]]" or "conspirer", which more immediately connotes the worship of gods other than Allah, and can also be translated as "polytheist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/541133/shirk |title=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://infad.usim.edu.my/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=8105 Islamic Science University of Malaysia, Dr. Abdullah al-Faqih, The meaning of "Kufr" and "Shirk"] {{Dead link|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Quran the term ''kafir'' is first applied to the unbelieving Meccans, and their attempts to refute and revile Muhammad. Later Muslims are ordered to keep apart from them, defend themselves from their attacks, and finally take the offensive against them.&lt;ref name="Campo, Juan Eduardo 2009 page 421"/&gt;&lt;ref name="J.

Encyclopedia of Islam. Infobase Publishing, New York, {{ISBN|978-0-8160-5454-1}}, see p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt; The expanded term ''kafir'' refers to anyone who disbelieves in the religion of Islam, the one that mocks the religion of Islam, who does not regard the kafiroon as kaffirs, whoever believes one's teaching is more reliable and trustworthy than Muhammad's teachings, whoever hates something of Muhammad, whoever practices witchcraft, and whoever supports the kaffirs against the Muslims (in terms of war, harming, etc.).&lt;ref name="Campo, Juan Eduardo 2009 page 421"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1991"&gt;Lewis, Bernard.

The corpus of hadith deals with the fate of the kafir in the afterlife and reflects a major controversy in early Islam as to whether a Muslim should be considered a kafir for committing a major sin. Some hadiths prohibit declaring a Muslim to be a kafir, but the term was nonetheless fairly frequent in the internal religious polemics of the age.&lt;ref name="J. Brill 1936, page 619"/&gt;

Some texts of [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] sect of Islam include other sects of Islam such as [[Shia Islam|Shia]] as infidel.&lt;ref&gt;Wilfred Madelung (1970), Early Sunnī Doctrine concerning Faith as Reflected in the" Kitāb al-Īmān", Studia Islamica, No. 32, pp. 233–54&lt;/ref&gt; Certain sects of Islam, such as [[Wahhabi movement|Wahhabism]], include as kafir those Muslims who undertake Sufi shrine pilgrimage and follow Shia teachings about [[Imam]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Brian Glyn.

In the [[Quran]] the term "[[people of the book]]" refers to [[Jews]], [[Christians]], and [[Sabians]].&lt;ref name=EI&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Vajda, G | year= 2012 | title=Ahl al-Kitāb |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill |editors=P.

Heinrichs|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_0383|subscription=yes|volume=1|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars claim Islam considers Jews and Christians as fellow believers.

Brill 1936, page 619"/&gt; On the subject of ritual impurity of unbelievers, one finds a range of opinions, "from the strictest to the most tolerant", in classical jurisprudence.&lt;ref name="J. Brill 1936, page 619"&gt;Björkman, W., "Kafir". E. J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913–1936, Volume 4, {{ISBN|9789004097902}}; pp. 619–20&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the attitude toward unbelievers in Islam was determined more by socio-political conditions than by religious doctrine. A tolerance toward unbelievers "impossible to imagine in contemporary Christendom" prevailed even to the time of the [[Crusades]], particularly with respect to the People of the Book. However, animosity was nourished by repeated wars with unbelievers, and warfare between [[Safavid]] Persia and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkey]] brought about application of the term ''kafir'' even to Persians in Turkish [[fatwa]]s.&lt;ref name="J. Brill 1936, page 619"/&gt;

Like "infidel", the term kafir has developed into a term of abuse. "In theory" a Muslim commits a punishable offense if he says to a Christian or a Jew: "thou unbeliever".&lt;ref name="J. Brill 1936, page 619"/&gt;

In [[Sufism]] the term underwent a special development, as in a well-known verse of [[Abū-Sa'īd Abul-Khayr|Abu Sa'id]]: "So long as belief and unbelief are not perfectly equal, no man can be a true Muslim", which has prompted various explanations.&lt;ref name="J. Brill 1936, page 619"/&gt;

===Judaism===
[[Judaism]] has a notion of [[pagan]] gentiles who are called {{hebrew|עכומ}} ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;acum'', an acronym of Ovdei Cohavim u-Mazzaloth or, literally, "star-and-constellation worshippers".&lt;ref name = "IESS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walter Zanger, "[http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/ancient-cultures/ancient-israel/jewish-worship-pagan-symbols/ Jewish Worship, Pagan Symbols: Zodiac mosaics in ancient synagogues]", ''Bible History Daily''; first published 24 August 2012, updated 24 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shay Zucker, "[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/seri/IAUS./0260//0000301.000.html Hebrew Names of the Planets]", ''The Role of Astronomy in Society and Culture, Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union'', IAU Symposium, Volume 260; p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isaac Albalag''' ({{lang-he|'''יצחק אלבלג'''}}) was a [[Jew]]ish [[Jewish philosophy|philosopher]] of the second half of the 13th century.

==Biography==
According to Steinschneider (''Hebr. Uebers''. pp.&amp;nbsp;299–306),{{Full citation needed|date=April 2018}} Albalag probably lived in northern [[Spain]] or southern [[France]]. [[Heinrich Graetz|Graetz]] makes him a native of southern Spain. His liberal views, especially his interpretations of the [[Bible|Biblical]] account of the [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] in accordance with the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] theory of the [[eternity of the world]], stamped him in the eyes of many as a [[heresy|heretic]].

==Translation work==
Apart from this, he showed little originality, and was eclectic in tendency. This is illustrated by the fact that though he was an unreserved follower of Aristotle, he showed a leaning toward the [[Kabbalah]], the excesses of which, however, he energetically opposed, especially the redaction of Biblical interpretations based on the assumed numerical values of the letters ([[Gematria]]). His most characteristic work was a translation (1292){{Full citation needed|date=April 2018}} of a part of [[Al-Ghazali]]'s ''Maqasid al-Falasifa'' (''[[Aims of the Philosophers]]''), which embraces only two parts of the original; namely, [[logic]] and [[metaphysics]].

Albalag did not confine himself therein to the work of a translator, but often corrected the views of other philosophers as formulated by Al-Ghazali, who intended to refute them himself in his later work entitled ''Tahafut al-Falasifa'' (''[[Incoherence of the Philosophers]]''). Albalag remarked that Al-Ghazali did not refute the philosophers but rather his own errors, into which he had fallen by obtaining information not from Aristotle himself, but from his commentators, such as Ibn Sina ([[Avicenna]]) and others. According to Albalag, this charge applies also to [[Maimonides]] when attempting to refute Aristotle, as, for instance, on the eternity of the world.

In the composition of his work Albalag made it his main object to counteract the widespread popular prejudice that philosophy was undermining the foundation of [[religion]]. Religion and philosophy would, for Albalag, agree on the fundamental principles of all positive religion — which are : "the belief in reward and punishment, in immortality, in the existence of a just [[God]], and in Divine Providence" (which, of course, doesn't take into account any of previous materialistic philosophies, such as those of Diogenes or Democrites..). 

Religions, as well as philosophy, follow the same aim; namely, to render mankind happy. It is, no doubt, quite true that philosophy, which addresses itself to the individual, differs in its mode of establishing those truths from religion, which appeals to the great masses. Philosophy demonstrates; religion only teaches.

==Doctrinal assertions==
Albalag, however, by no means asserts that the doctrines of the philosophers must entirely coincide with those of religion; and it is exactly in his conception of their mutual relation that his peculiar standpoint manifests itself. The idea, already expressed by Maimonides, that the naked philosophical truth is often harmful for the masses, and that therefore the Holy Scriptures had often to adapt themselves to the intellectual level of the people, was so strongly emphasized by him that it is probable he was influenced by Ibn Rushd ([[Averroes]]), who made this idea the central point of his book ''Theology and Philosophy'' — "therefore, he errs doubly who rejects a philosophical truth on account of its apparent contradiction of Scripture: first, because he misses the true meaning of Scripture; second, because thereby he declares the real arguments of philosophy to be inconclusive."

In cases where an adjustment is absolutely impossible, Albalag brings forward a very strange solution; namely, that the teaching of the philosopher is true from the speculative standpoint, and at the same time the utterance of Scripture is true from a higher, supernatural point of view — the philosophical mode of knowledge being altogether different from the prophetic. And as the philosopher is only intelligible to his compeers, so the prophet can be understood only by prophets. This view resembles the theory of double truth (the [[theology|theological]] and the philosophical), originated and chiefly developed in the 13th century at the [[University of Paris]] (Lange, ''Gesch. des Materialismus'', 3d ed., i. 181).{{Full citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Influences==
There is no evidence, however, of any direct influence of the Parisian thinkers on Albalag, as he could have come to his view by a more natural process; viz., by combining the two opposite influences of Ibn Roshd and Al-Gazzali, whose idea of the difference between philosophical and prophetical knowledge is at the bottom of the latter's work, the ''Munkid''. Accepting these two influences, the view of the double truth necessarily follows. It may be added that Albalag interpreted the Biblical account of the Creation as signifying that the six days represent the relative order of things, while he conceives the seventh day as pointing to the world of ideals.

He was originally from [[Laiagam District]] in the [[Enga Province]] of [[Papua New Guinea]].&lt;ref name=pc&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title= PNG Judge Stoned To Death|url=http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2007/10/22/png-judge-stoned-to-death|work= [[The Post-Courier]] |publisher=[[Pacific Magazine]] |date=2007-10-22 |accessdate=2007-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attack==
Cappo was driving through PNG's [[capital city]], [[Port Moresby]], in the early morning of October 20, 2007 at approximately 2:30 A.M.&lt;ref name=mh&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title= Papua New Guinea magistrate stoned to death|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22630354-663,00.html|work= [[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[Herald Sun]] |date=2007-10-23 |accessdate=2007-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cappo reportedly lost control of the vehicle he was driving and crashed his car into an illegal [[refugee camp]] outside of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]]
&lt;ref name=mh/&gt;  in the [[Ela Beach]] section of the city near the downtown.&lt;ref name=pc/&gt; Cappo's car destroyed several tents and narrowly missed many women and children, but no one from the camp was apparently hurt in the accident.

The refugees in the illegal settlement were all from Indonesian [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]].&lt;ref name=pim&gt;{{cite news |first=Alexander|last=Rheeney|title= Policeman Charged Over Magistrate’s Death|url=http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2007/10/30/policeman-charged-over-magistrates-death|work= [[Pacific Magazine]] |publisher= |date=2007-10-30 |accessdate=2007-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The West Papuans had set up the camp outside the Port Moresby office of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) to protests the commission's refusal to relocate them to a third country.&lt;ref name=pim/&gt; The camp had been set up four weeks prior to the accident and the attack on Cappo.&lt;ref name=pim/&gt; The UNHCR had previously refused to relocate the West Papuan refugees to a country outside of [[Indonesia]] or Papua New Guinea because it does not consider their lives in danger back in Indonesia.&lt;ref name=pim/&gt;

Five people were charged with the attack and murder of Ivo Cappo. The alleged attackers included four West Papuan immigrants: Arnold Kafair, 19, from Raur village; David Koivi, 19, from Pemoi village; Christopher Waromi, 23, from Ambai village; and John Dimara, 23, from Urfu village.&lt;ref name=tn&gt;{{cite news |first=Joshua|last=Arlo|title= Cappo court papers yet to be completed|url=http://www.thenational.com.pg/111307/Nation%2026.htm|work= [[Pacific Magazine]] |publisher= |date=2007-11-12 |accessdate=2007-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; (All of their home villages are in Indonesia West Papua.)

The painting is dated 1838 and is housed at [[Emory &amp; Henry College]] in [[Emory, VA]].]]
'''John Emory''' (11 April 1789 – 1835) was an American [[bishop]] of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], elected in 1832.

==Early life and family==
John was born  at Spaniard's Neck, [[Queen Anne's County, Maryland]].  His parents were Methodists, his father a jurist who designed him for the law.  His mother, however, who had been converted under [[Garrettson]], devoted John at birth to the ministry. His eldest son Robert, born in  1814, became a professor of Latin and Greek at [[Dickinson College]] in 1836 and later its president. In 1841 he published a biography of his father,  ''Life of the Rev. John Emory''.

He was educated by tutors at [[Easton, Maryland|Easton]] and [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], and in [[Washington College]], [[Chestertown, Maryland]].  He experienced "saving grace" at a [[Quarterly Meeting]] in 1806.  He studied law in 1805 in the office of Judge R.T. Earle, [[Centreville, Maryland]], and was admitted to the bar in 1808.  But his attention soon turned to the pulpit, against his father's protests, and he entered the Traveling Ministry of the Philadelphia [[Annual Conference]] of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church|M.E. Church]] in 1810.

==Ministry==
Emory became well known, and his services were much in demand throughout the Middle States.  He was elected a Member of the General Conference of 1816, and then to each succeeding General Conference (with one exception) through 1832 (when he was elected to the [[Episcopacy]]).  He was sent as a delegate to the British [[Wesleyan Conference]] in 1820.  He was appointed Book Agent and Editor for the M.E. Church in 1824, with offices in [[New York City]].  While a bishop, he continued his interest in the [[Book Concern]], and during his management thereof was successful in paying-off all its debts, returning it to a solid foundation.

He was especially active in promoting the improvement of the literature of the M. E. Church.  For example, he founded the ''"[[Methodist Quarterly Review]],"'' nearly all the original articles in the first two volumes being from his own pen.  He was prominent in the founding of the [[New York University]] and of [[Wesleyan University]], and was one of the principal organizers of [[Dickinson College]] as a Methodist school. He was an able debater.  In 1817 in a pamphlet controversy, he used his literary weapons, not unsuccessfully, against [[William White (Bishop of Pennsylvania)|Bishop White]] of the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Protestant Episcopal Church]].  In the controversy of 1828 which led to the founding of the [[Methodist Protestant Church]] he was the chief defender of existing M.E. polity.  He was of a logical turn of mind, and had command of a pure, clear, and vigorous style.  As a Bishop he was largely influential in giving the ''[[Methodist Episcopal Book of Discipline]]'' its present form.

==College and university namesakes==
Bishop Emory died in an 1835 carriage accident near his Maryland home.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=which-death/&gt; The next year, Methodists chartered both [[Oxford College of Emory University|Emory College]] (later [[University]]) at [[Oxford, Georgia]] and [[Emory &amp; Henry College]] in southwestern Virginia. (The co-eponym for the latter is [[Patrick Henry]].)  Both maintain their Methodist associations.

Bishop Emory is buried at [[Mount Olivet Cemetery (Baltimore)|Mount Olivet Cemetery]] in Baltimore near the graves of Bishops [[Francis Asbury]] and [[Beverly Waugh]].

Emory United Methodist Church in New Oxford, PA, erected in 1887, was named for him after he helped to establish the Emory Sunday School during the church's early years - between 1832 and 1835.

University of the Pacific named one of the College Park neighborhood streets in San Jose "Emory Street" in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://twofeet.weebly.com/walking-blog/-1024-emory-street Emory Street, San Jose, California]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist |group=lower-alpha |refs=
&lt;ref name=which-death&gt;Regarding the Bishop's death, Emory &amp; Henry College publishes a webpage at the URL: http://www.ehcweb.ehc.edu/emory/johne.htm, which states: "The next year, on December 16, 1835, Bishop Emory was killed in a carriage accident, the brakes apparently failing on a long and steep hill."  A dot com website named "Famousamericans" has a page which states: "EMORY, John, M. E. bishop, born in Queen Anne County, Maryland, 11 April 1789; died in Reisterstown, Maryland, 17 December 1835."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mungomacaroni.gif|thumb|''A Mungo Macaroni'' engraving by Matthew and Mary Darly (1772)]]
'''Julius Soubise''' (1754 – August 25, 1798) was a freed [[British African-Caribbean community|Afro-Caribbean]] [[slave]] who became a well-known [[fop]] in late eighteenth century [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]]. The satirized depiction of Soubise, ''A Mungo Macaroni'', is a relic of [[intersectionality]] between race, class, and gender in eighteenth century London. His life of luxury as a free man of color allowed him to excel in elite activities such as fencing and made him notorious in London’s social scene as an exception to norms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/462914558|title=Slaves to fashion : black dandyism and the styling of black diasporic identity|last=1970-|first=Miller, Monica L.,|date=2009|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822391517|location=Durham|oclc=462914558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the collected letters of the famous freed slave [[Ignatius Sancho]], Letter XIIII (dated October 11, 1771) is addressed to Soubise, whom Sancho encourages to consider his lucky position as an unusually privileged black person and so live a more seemly life.&lt;ref name="LETTERS"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Letters of the Late Ignatius Sancho, an African|author=Ignatius Sancho (ed.

However, on July 15, 1777, Soubise fled Britain for [[India]].&lt;ref name="Unchained" /&gt; Historical accounts dispute whether he was sent away simply to amend his debauchery or to evade a rape accusation from a maid of the Duchess’.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Duchess died two days after his departure.

Soubise became socially prominent enough to become the subject of several caricatures. Most notably, Soubise is attributed as the muse for ''A Mungo Macaroni'' (published September 10, 1772), part of a famous 1771–1773 satirical series of engravings depicting fashionable young men, published by [[Matthew Darly|Matthew]] and [[Mary Darly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Spaces of Modernity: London's Geographies 1680–1780|author=Miles Ogborn|publisher=Guilford Press|year=1998|isbn=1-57230-365-4|page=[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1572303654&amp;id=tCp_X–AUQ6MC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;ots=q7Re8y1YNt&amp;dq=%22mungo+macaroni%27&amp;sig=kFZz7PyBcHvEZXDhSOwldu8ynJk 134]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LETTERS" /&gt; The term "[[Maccaroni (fashion)|macaroni]]" was a contemporary name for a fashionable young man, a [[dandy]], while "Mungo" was a name of an officious slave from the 1769 [[comic opera]] ''[[The Padlock]]'' by [[Isaac Bickerstaffe]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/723453913|title=The Cambridge companion to British theatre, 1730-1830|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Moody, Jane, 1967-2011., O'Quinn, Daniel, 1962-|isbn=9781139001656|location=Cambridge|oclc=723453913}}&lt;/ref&gt; In previous contexts, use of the term “mungo” was often aimed towards luxury slaves, an application of the character to those treated theatrically like elite’s pets.

== Arts and Education ==
In his work as an actor, Soubise is suggested to have had runs in the role of [[Othello]] as well as the character Mungo from ''[[The Padlock]],'' characters historically most often played by white actors in [[blackface]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, such reports come from [[Hicky's Bengal Gazette|Hicky's Bengal Gazette,]] which could have posited this satirically to mock his Soubise's status. Soubise was strongly associated with these characters throughout his time in the elite social sphere, labeled by others because he was a black actor, punctuated by his depiction in ''A Mungo Macaroni''.

Soubise received instruction in the privileged accomplishments of riding and fencing, taught by fencing master Domenico Angelo per Duchess Douglas’ connections.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He was also known as an amateur violinist,&lt;ref name="UKNA" /&gt; singer and actor – he was taught oration by the famous actor [[David Garrick]].&lt;ref name="Hyde" /&gt;

== Fashion ==
Soubise’s styles were likened to other fops of the time, often characterized by the French influence he also granted his namesake&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2J6S9QbpxI0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Julius%20Soubise&amp;f=false|title=The Limits of the Human: Fictions of Anomaly, Race and Gender in the Long Eighteenth Century|last=Nussbaum|first=Felicity|date=2003-05-15|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521016421|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

There are also accounts of him wearing diamond-buckled shoes with red heels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such styles meant Soubise and other fops were associated with effeminacy and excess, supported by the caricatures, but Soubise also assumed a unique black identity that could be associated with extravagance.

[[Tree]]s often have a substantial mass stored above ground. Trees and tree parts can and do fail, and this mass is converted to [[kinetic energy]]. These failures can cause substantial damage and occasionally result in the death of a person. However, the number of deaths caused by accidental tree failures is quite small even though trees are naturally shedding organisms. When talking about the situation in the United Kingdom, Ball &amp; Ball King state, "the risk to the public of harm from falling trees is minuscule [sic], and the reality that the prospects of reducing the risk below the current level are remote and comparable to finding a microscopic needle in a gargantuan haystack." In the UK the annual mortality rate from accidental tree failure has averaged at about 6 per annum,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NQJSAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11|title=Public Safety and Risk Assessment: Improving Decision Making|last=Ball|first=David J.|last2=Ball-King|first2=Laurence|date=2014-04-08|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317972419|location=Abingdon, United Kingdom|pages=11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, no figures have been published for Australia. The following is a '''list of deaths from accidental tree failures'''. The data excludes any fatality where human invention caused the failure. This eliminates deaths of those are killed while working on or cutting down trees where the failure was caused by that work.

== Deaths during the process of work being done on trees ==
The following is a list of deaths that have occurred during the process of work being done on trees. It is assumed that when those that are working on trees are killed by the tree. These deaths are almost always the result of the work that was being done and not because the tree or a part of the tree failed on its own accord.

== Coronial comments and advice ==
The coronial recommendations and comments varied considerably. Where the coroner's findings were made public, the decedent's name has been provided. The following comments and findings have been given

Case 1: Aidan Bott 2006

(''i) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; That there be education and advice provided by relevant agencies to school principals both public and private, as to the requirements for tree maintenance ...''

''(ii) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; That there be compulsory inspection of all trees in school yards in all schools, both public and private, ... at least every 6 months.''

''(iii) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; That such inspections be conducted by qualified arborists.''

Case 2:

''Based on the observations of the site inspection and with particular reference to the external appearance of the stem, as it probably would have appeared prior to the failure, it is unlikely that the subject tree would have been identified as a potential hazard if a routine tree inspection was undertaken''

Case 3:

At ''the position of failure external examination revealed no visible signs of lack of integrity, however internal examination revealed fungal activity and significant decay.&amp;nbsp;''

Case 4

(i) A regular (and documented) review of the area by an appropriate expert (an arborist);&amp;nbsp;

(ii) A tree planting program that recognises and minimises the longer term risk;&amp;nbsp;

(iii) Where a building or B.B.Q area is likely to be constructed an appropriate mechanism should be established for identifying potentially dangerous trees in the immediate area and reducing the risk.

Case 5:

''The [arborist] concluded that it was'...hard to determine what actually occurred.&amp;nbsp; [For example,] the lean of the tree, the crown weight, exudations, the overall health and condition of the tree was undeterminable because the tree was inspected in a failed state ...&amp;nbsp; It is my opinion that from a visual inspection it would have been impossible to determine any major or minor internal structural decay, with normal weather conditions it would be considered unlikely for tree failure to occur but not impossible''

Case 6:

''... the accident was clearly caused by a structural fault with a dead tree that would certainly have been picked up with an arborist inspection of the tree prior to the accident'.''

''It is apparent that whilst such inspection of trees is desirable to avoid a recurrence of such an accident, the reality is that it is just far too cost prohibitive for any rural Council to embark upon.”''

Case 6

[''The tree] was 21 metres in length and was dead with no living tissue noted.&amp;nbsp; [The arboricultural consultant] saw obvious signs of advanced decay as well as obvious signs of past and current termite activities. In [the consultant's] view the tree had been dead for approximately 3-5 years ...''

''... at the time when camping grounds are being created for use by paying campers, an inspection by an arboricultural consultant, or similar professional, be conducted so as to ensure that hazards posed by trees will be kept to a minimum.''

''... at camping grounds visited by regular campers, regular inspections should be conducted by persons with relevant training and experience to ensure that hazards are kept to a minimum and trees which are likely to fall on campsites are removed within a reasonable timeframe. I further recommend that any pruning be conducted by suitably experienced and qualified persons in accordance with Australian Standard 4373 (1996) Pruning of Amenity Tree Standards. I further recommend that a pruning cycle of 5 – 8 years be established in order to address developing structural issues''.

Case 7

''An arborist inspected the tree at the request of Police who reported that the tree was dead and most likely had been dead for about 12 months. The presence of a vine over the tree would have concealed its dead state from an untrained eye.''

Case 8: Rebecca Anne Penfold Jolly

''It is impractical to expect that every single tree in metropolitan Adelaide will be individually inspected and assessed. It is probably impractical to expect even that, within existing resources, every tree that might pose a risk if it failed will be so inspected.&amp;nbsp; Of course, when a risk has been drawn to a local authorities' attention, then it is incumbent upon that authority to carry out a complete inspection of that risk in accordance with generally accepted standards.''

Case 9: Bridget Wright

''[An] Arborist, inspected the tree the next day. He concluded:''

· &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;''The branch fell because the tree was unhealthy and had significant problems''

· &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;''There was extensive fungal decay at the site of the branch failure, affecting approximately two thirds of the diameter of its base''

· &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;''An aerial inspection also revealed a 3 metre cavity at the base of the main leaders that contained a large bee hive and there was also bracket fungi on a number of the other branches''

· &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;''While these defects would not have been obvious from the ground, there were enough indicators visible from the ground to warrant an aerial inspection''

''As a result of these actions, over 9,000 trees have been removed from public school grounds across the State.''

''There was nothing to indicate any specific concerns about the large Red Forest Gum tree in the playground on that day.''

''What is clear from the evidence is that it was known that the large branch which failed was extended with significant end weight''

In the field of [[memetics]], a '''metameme''' (or '''meta-meme''') is defined as a [[meme]] about a meme. A [[metaphor]] or the idea of [[memetic engineering]] are, thus, metamemes. The concept of memes has been referred to as "The Metameme".&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Grant. [http://deoxy.org/memelex.htm A Memetic Lexicon]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some other metamemes of interest include the [[meme tolerance]] and [[memeplex]]es.

Initial definitions of meta memes and the lingo surrounding the phenomenon have seen a recent overhaul, as a new perspective is beginning to emerge due to heightened interest from researchers and fortune 500 companies alike. Theories posited suggest that a meta meme is a meme about a meme. This process not only has brought about an entirely fresh way to view memes.

==Measuring social evolution==
Metamemes may be used to measure the evolution of a given society. It has been proposed that the degree of [[consciousness]] one society has about the very [[meme]]s that form it is correlated with how evolved that society is. The difficulties associated with measuring the "metamemetic content" of a given society, however, render that proposition impractical.

This can be viewed (to some extent) as a memetic approach to the American sociologist [[Gerhard Lenski]]'s view that the more information a given society has, the more advanced it is.{{cn|date=May 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10901">A '''mode of toxic action''' is a common set of [[physiological]] and [[behavioral]] signs that characterize a type of adverse biological response.&lt;ref name="rand"&gt;{{cite book | author = Rand G | title = Fundamentals of Aquatic Toxicology: Effects, Environmental Fate, and Risk Assessment | year = 1995 | publisher = CRC Press | location =Boca Raton, FL | isbn = 1-56032-091-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[mode of action]] should not be confused with [[mechanism of action]], which refer to the [[biochemical]] processes underlying a given mode of action.&lt;ref name="escher02"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Escher BI, Hermens JL | title = Modes of action in ecotoxicology: their role in body burdens, species sensitivity, QSARs, and mixture effects | journal = Environ. Sci. Technol. | volume = 36 | issue = 20 | pages = 4201–17 |date=October 2002 | pmid = 12387389 | doi =  10.1021/es015848h}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modes of toxic action are important, widely used tools in [[ecotoxicology]] and [[aquatic toxicology]] because they classify [[toxicant]]s or [[pollution|pollutants]] according to their type of toxic action. There are two major types of modes of toxic action: non-specific acting toxicants and specific acting toxicants. Non-specific acting toxicants are those that produce [[narcotic|narcosis]], while specific acting toxicants are those that are non-narcotic and that produce a specific action at a specific target site.

== Types ==

=== Non-specific ===

[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes (FATS)|Non-specific acting modes of toxic action]] result in [[narcotic|narcosis]]; therefore, narcosis is a mode of toxic action. Narcosis is defined as a generalized depression in [[biological activity]] due to the presence of [[toxicant]] [[molecules]] in the organism.&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt; The target site and mechanism of toxic action through which narcosis affects organisms are still unclear, but there are [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] that support that it occurs through alterations in the [[cell membranes]] at specific sites of the membranes, such as the [[lipid bilayer|lipid layers]] or the [[proteins]] bound to the membranes. Even though continuous exposure to a [[narcotic]] toxicant can produce [[death]], if the exposure to the toxicant is stopped, narcosis can be reversible.

=== Specific ===

[[Toxicant]]s that at low [[concentrations]] modify or inhibit some biological process by binding at a specific site or [[molecule]] have a specific acting mode of toxic action.&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt; However, at high enough concentrations, toxicants with specific acting modes of toxic actions can produce [[narcotic|narcosis]] that may or may not be reversible. Nevertheless, the specific action of the toxicant is always shown first because it requires lower concentrations.

There are several specific acting modes of toxic action:
*'''''[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes (FATS)|Uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation]]'''''. Involves toxicants that uncouple the two processes that occur in [[oxidative phosphorylation]]: [[electron transfer]] and [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) production.
* '''''Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors'''''. [[Acetylcholinesterase|AChE]] is an [[enzyme]] associated with [[nerve]] [[synapses]] that it’s designed to regulate nerve impulses by breaking down the [[neurotransmitter]] [[Acetylcholine]] (ACh). When toxicants bind to AChE, they inhibit the breakdown of ACh. This results in continued nerve impulses across the synapses, which eventually cause nerve system damage. Examples of AChE inhibitors are [[organophosphates]] and [[carbamates]], which are components found in [[pesticides]] (see [[Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors]]).
* '''''Irritants'''''. These are chemicals that cause an [[inflammation|inflammatory]] effect on living tissue by chemical action at the site of contact. The resulting effect of [[Irritation|irritants]] is an increase in the [[volume]] of cells due to a change in size ([[hypertrophy]]) or an increase in the number of cells ([[hyperplasia]]). Examples of irritants are [[benzaldehyde]], [[acrolein]], [[zinc sulphate]] and [[chlorine]].
* '''''Central nervous system (CNS) seizure agents'''''. [[Central nervous system|CNS]] seizure agents inhibit [[cellular signaling]] by acting as [[receptor antagonists]]. They result in the inhibition of biological responses. Examples of CNS seizure agents are [[organochlorine]] [[pesticides]].
* '''''Respiratory blockers'''''. These are toxicants that affect [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] by interfering with the [[electron transport chain]] in the [[mitochondria]]. Examples of respiratory blockers are [[rotenone]] and [[cyanide]].

== Determination ==

The pioneer work of identifying the major categories of modes of toxic action (see description above) was conducted by investigators from the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) at the Duluth Laboratory using fish,&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mccarty93"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=McCarty LS, McCarty D | title = Enhancing ecotoxicological modeling and assessment: body residues and modes of toxic action|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology | year = 1993 | volume = 27 | issue = 9 | pages = 1719–1728 | doi=10.1021/es00046a001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="escher10"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Escher BI, Ashauer R, Dyer S, Hermens JL, Lee JH, Leslie HA, Mayer P, Meador JP, Warne MS | title = Crucial role of mechanisms and modes of toxic action for understanding tissue residue toxicity and internal effect concentrations of organic chemicals | journal = Integr Environ Assess Manag | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 28–49 |date=January 2011 | pmid = 21184568 | doi = 10.1002/ieam.100  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McKim JM, Schmieder PK, Carlson RW, Hunt EP | title = Use of respiratory-cardiovascular responses of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) in identifying acute toxicity syndromes in fish: Part 1. Pentachlorophenol, 2,4-dinitrophenol, tricaine methanesulfonate and 1-octanol | journal = Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry | year = 1987 | volume = 6 | pages = 295–312 | doi=10.1002/etc.5620060407}}&lt;/ref&gt; reason why they named the categories as ''[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes (FATS)|Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes]]'' (FATS). They proposed the FATS by assessing the [[behavioral]] and [[physiological]] responses of the fish when subjected to [[toxicity test]]s, such as [[locomotive]] activities, body [[color]], [[ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]] patterns, [[cough]] [[rate function|rate]], [[heart rate]], and others.&lt;ref name="escher02" /&gt;

It has been proposed that modes of toxic action could be estimated by developing a data set of critical body residues (CBR).&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; The CBR is the whole-body [[concentration]] of a chemical that is associated with a given adverse biological response&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt; and it is estimated using a [[partition coefficient]] and a [[bioconcentration]] factor. The whole-body residues are reasonable first [[approximations]] of the amount of chemical present at the toxic action site(s).&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; Because different modes of toxic action generally appear to be associated with different ranges of body residues,&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; modes of toxic action can then be separated into categories. However, it is unlikely that every chemical has the same mode of toxic action in every organism, so this [[Heart rate variability|variability]] should be considered.&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; The effects of [[mixture]] toxicity should be considered as well, even though mixture toxicity it's generally [[additive map|additive]],&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; chemicals with more than one mode of toxic action may contribute to toxicity.&lt;ref name="escher10" /&gt;

[[Scientific modeling|Modeling]] has become a common used tool to predict modes of toxic action in the last decade. The [[mathematical model|models]] are based in [[Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship]]s (QSARs), which are [[mathematical models]] that relate the [[biological activity]] of molecules to their [[chemical structure]]s and corresponding chemical and [[Physical chemistry|physicochemical]] properties.&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt; QSARs can then predict modes of toxic action of unknown compounds by comparing its characteristic toxicity profile and chemical structure to reference compounds with known toxicity profiles and chemical structures.&lt;ref name="escher02" /&gt; Russom and colleagues&lt;ref name="russom"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Russom CL, Bradbury SP, Broderius SJ, Hammermeister DE, Drummond RA | title = Predicting modes of toxic action from chemical structure: acute toxicity in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) | journal = Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry | year = 1997 | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 948–967 | doi=10.1002/etc.5620160514}}&lt;/ref&gt; were one of the first group of researchers being able to classify modes of toxic action with the use of QSARs; they classified 600 chemicals as narcotics. Even though QSARs are a useful tool for predicting modes of toxic action, chemicals having multiple modes of toxic action can obscure QSAR analyses. Therefore, these models are continuously being developed.

== Applications ==

=== Environmental risk assessment ===

The objective of environmental [[risk assessment]] is to protect the environment from adverse effects.&lt;ref name="escher02" /&gt; Researchers are further developing QSAR models with the ultimate goal providing a clear insight about a mode of toxic action, but also about what the actual target site is, the concentration of the chemical at this target site, and the interaction occurring at the target site,&lt;ref name="escher02" /&gt; as well as to predict the modes of toxic action in [[mixtures]]. Information on the mode of toxic action is crucial not only in understanding joint toxic effects and potential interactions between chemicals in mixtures, but also for developing assays for the evaluation of complex mixtures in the field.

=== Regulation ===

The combination of [[behavioral]] and [[physiological]] responses, CBR estimates, and chemical fate and [[bioaccumulation]] QSAR models can be a powerful regulatory tool&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; to address [[pollution]] and toxicity in areas where [[effluents]] are discharged.

[[Image:Tumulo de D. Pedro I 57a.jpg|thumb|Mourning angels at the tomb of [[Pedro I of Portugal]] (died 1367), [[Alcobaça Monastery]] Mourning figures or "weepers" (French ''pleurants'') have been conventional elements of [[tomb]] architecture since the [[Gothic art|Gothic period]].]]

A '''mourner''' is someone who is attending a [[funeral]] or who is otherwise recognized as in a period of [[grief]] and [[mourning]] prescribed either by religious law or by popular custom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mourner ''Mourner'' definition] at [[Merriam-Webster]]&lt;/ref&gt; Many cultures expect mourners to curtail certain activities, usually those considered frivolous or that are accompanied by expressions of joy.

==History==
Historically, some cultures have employed [[Professional mourning|professional mourners]] to make a public showing of grief to honor the deceased (particularly those in the [[Near East]]).&lt;ref&gt;Footnote 1 in Sabar, Y. (1976). "Lel-Huza: Story and History in a Cycle of Lamentations for the Ninth of Ab in the Jewish Neo-Aramaic Dialect of Zakho, Iraqi Kurdistan." ''Journal of Semitic Studies'' (21) 138-162.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
Traced back to the year of 1877, it has been recorded that there is a business entailed with hiring or renting mourners for a funeral. It is said that a funeral with an abundance of mourners makes the deceased appear to have lived a well life. This leads people into renting mourners to show up at their funeral. The mourners are actors who are paid by the hour to mourn in the crowd. Before the funeral, the actors are informed about the deceased and the life that they lived. They are told about the life of the deceased so that they can casually talk to the crowd about as if they really knew them. It is even tradition in the African countries, Middle Eastern countries, and China to hire mourners.&lt;ref name=TheHuffingtonPost&gt;{{cite news|title='Rent A Mourner' Helps You Look More Popular At Your Funeral|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/27/rent-a-mourner_n_2964280.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=1 November 2013|first=Catherine|last=New|date=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is even recorded that in China mourners are hired to belly dance and put on a theatrical spectacle at the funeral.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite web|last=Lim|first=Louisa|title=Belly Dancing For The Dead: A Day With China's Top Mourner|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/06/26/195565696/belly-dancing-for-the-dead-a-day-with-chinas-top-mourner|publisher=NPR|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TIMEcnnNews&gt;{{cite news|title=TIME News Feed|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/04/04/want-to-look-more-popular-rent-a-mourner-will-send-people-to-your-funeral/|publisher=CNN News|accessdate=1 November 2013|date=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Céline Figard''' ({{IPA-fr|selin fiɡaʁ}}; 23 May 1976&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QVZD-W7QZ|title=Person Details for Celine Figard, "England and Wales Death Registration Index 1837–2007"|last=|first=|date=4 September 2014|website=FamilySearch.org|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813152412/https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QVZD-W7QZ|archive-date=13 August 2016|dead-url=no|accessdate=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; – 19 December 1995) was a French woman who went missing and was murdered during a visit to the United Kingdom in December 1995. She accepted a lift from a lorry driver at the [[Chieveley services]] on the [[M4 motorway|M4]] in [[Chieveley]], [[Berkshire]], on 19 December, but never arrived at her destination. Following an appeal for information on her whereabouts and police enquiries, her body was discovered on 29 December, at a lay-by on the [[A449 road|A449]] in [[Hawford]], [[Worcestershire]]. A [[Autopsy|post-mortem examination]] determined she had been strangled and bludgeoned to death.

The case received extensive news coverage in the UK around the Christmas and New Year period, amid fears that it could be linked to a series of killings around the [[English Midlands]], which police called the work of a "Midlands Ripper". The murder investigation included the UK's first national [[DNA profiling|DNA screening]] programme in the hunt for a murder suspect, covering over 5,000 people.

Stuart William Morgan, a 36-year-old lorry driver from [[Poole]], [[Dorset]], was arrested in February 1996 after a colleague recognised his image from a [[photofit]]. Morgan was later charged with Figard's murder, and convicted in October. Detectives concluded that after raping, strangling and bludgeoning her, he carried her body in his vehicle for ten days over the Christmas period before dumping it. Morgan was given a [[life sentence]], with a recommendation to serve at least twenty years. An appeal in February 1998 was rejected by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], and in 2009 the [[High Court of England and Wales|High Court]] turned down his application for a review of the length of his sentence. He became eligible for [[parole]] in February 2016, and has continued to maintain his innocence.

Figard was buried in the French village of [[Scey-sur-Saône-et-Saint-Albin]], [[Haute-Saône]], at a service attended by her family, friends and politicians in January 1996. In the UK, she is remembered in a memorial garden established at a church in the Worcestershire village of [[Ombersley]], close to where her body was discovered.

==Background and disappearance==
Céline Figard was born on 23 May 1976 in [[Besançon]], France, to Martine and Bernard Figard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astrologie-gratuite.org|title=Données de naissances|last=|first=|date=|website=astrologie-gratuite.org|publisher=|language=French|access-date=23 August 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160907041004/http://www.astrologie-gratuite.org/|archivedate=7 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had two brothers, Stephane and Nicolas, and a sister, Karine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.letelegramme.fr/ar/viewarticle1024.php?aaaammjj=19961017&amp;article=19961017-1243484&amp;type=ar|title=Unanimité contre le meurtrier de Céline|accessdate=9 July 2016|newspaper=Le Télégramme|date=17 October 1996|language=French|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117203807/http://www.letelegramme.fr/ar/viewarticle1024.php?aaaammjj=19961017&amp;article=19961017-1243484&amp;type=ar|archivedate=17 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of her death, she was studying accountancy at the Lycée le Grand Chênois in [[Montbéliard]].

Figard spent the summer of 1995 working at a hotel in [[Fordingbridge]], [[Hampshire]], where her cousin Jean-Marc was head waiter, using the opportunity to improve her English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itnsource.com/shotlist//RTV/1995/12/27/605261820/?s=|title=UK: Father of missing French student Celine Figard, appeals to public for help in finding his daughter.|website=www.itnsource.com|accessdate=9 July 2016|publisher=ITN source}}&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to the UK in December to spend another two weeks with Jean-Marc.&lt;ref name=WorcesterNews-2000-12-29/&gt; After leaving on Monday, 18 December, she travelled with a family friend employed by a local haulage firm to the French coast, as arranged by her parents, and crossed the [[English Channel]] the following day,&lt;ref name=Independent-1996-10-03/&gt;&lt;ref name=Openshaw/&gt; arriving in [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]], [[Kent]].

Police appealed for information about her disappearance, and issued a [[photofit]] of the lorry driver, but he was not identified.

==Discovery of body and autopsy==
On the morning of Friday, 29 December, the naked body of a young woman was found dumped at a lay-by on the [[A449 road|A449]] near the [[Worcestershire]] village of [[Hawford]] by a motorist who had stopped to change a windscreen wiper.&lt;ref name=Independent-1995-12-31/&gt; Police sought to establish her identity, but were sure it was not that of Louise Smith, an 18-year-old clerical assistant who had vanished early on Christmas Day after attending a nightclub at [[Yate]], [[Gloucestershire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Matthew |last=Brace |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/fears-grow-for-celine-after-body-is-found-1527720.html |title=Fears grow for Celine after body is found |publisher=Independent Print Ltd |newspaper=The Independent |date=30 December 1995 |accessdate=22 August 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125041704/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/fears-grow-for-celine-after-body-is-found-1527720.html |archivedate=25 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's body was discovered in February 1996 in [[Chipping Sodbury, South Gloucestershire|Chipping Sodbury]], [[South Gloucestershire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/54914.stm|title=Former student jailed for Christmas Day murder|publisher=BBC News|newspaper=|date=9 February 1998|accessdate=18 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813020625/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/54914.stm|archivedate=13 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The body was positively identified as that of Figard the following day. The [[post mortem]] determined she had been strangled and bludgeoned with a heavy implement, but did not establish which was fatal. The autopsy revealed "no obvious signs" of sexual assault,&lt;ref name=Independent-1995-12-31/&gt; but it was determined that sexual intercourse had taken place shortly before her death, and detectives believed it had occurred against her will.&lt;ref name=Independent-1996-01-13&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Mowbray |first2=Jason |last2=Bennetto |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/dna-test-for-1200-lorry-drivers-1323711.html |title=DNA test for 1,200 lorry drivers |publisher=Independent Print Ltd |newspaper=The Independent |date=13 January 1996 |accessdate=22 August 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714154419/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/dna-test-for-1200-lorry-drivers-1323711.html |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Police said that the body had been lying where it was found for about twenty-four hours and were working on the theory that she had been held captive before being killed. [[Detective Chief Superintendent]] Roger Hoddinott of [[Hampshire Police]] said at the time of discovery, Figard had been dead for at least four to five days, but did not announce a time of death.&lt;ref name="Independent-1995-12-31"&gt;{{cite news |first=Will |last=Bennett |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/killer-hid-celine-for-days-1527893.html |title=Killer hid Celine 'for days' |publisher=Independent Print Ltd |newspaper=The Independent |date=31 December 1995 |accessdate=22 August 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714233252/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/killer-hid-celine-for-days-1527893.html |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stuart William Morgan is an English lorry driver and former heating engineer from Poole. One of five children of John and Julianne Morgan, he was raised in [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge Wells]], [[Kent]], where his father was employed as a council foreman and his mother&amp;nbsp;– a refugee from the former [[East Germany]]&amp;nbsp;– worked as a school cleaner. Morgan left school with three [[Certificate of Secondary Education|CSE]]s, and in 1974 served a custodial sentence in [[borstal]] following a conviction for burglary. After attending [[Croydon Polytechnic]] to train as a plumber and heating engineer, he established a plumbing business in the Tunbridge Wells area. He moved to Dorset following the failure of that business in 1983 and worked as a heating engineer for [[Bournemouth Borough Council]]. He became a lorry driver in 1991.&lt;ref name=DailyMail-1996-10-17/&gt;&lt;ref name=Openshaw&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/144_14961.htm|archiveurl= http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110218200720/http:/www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/144_14961.htm|dead-url= yes|archivedate= 18 February 2011|title= High Court setting of minimum terms for mandatory life sentences under the Criminal Justice Act 2003: Neutral Citation Number: [2009] EWHC 1629|publisher= HM Government of the United Kingdom|work= Her Majesty's Courts Service|date= 27 July 2009|accessdate= 29 August 2012|first= The Hon. Mr Justice|last= Openshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan met his first wife in Kent in the early 1980s. They married in 1982, but he left her when she became pregnant with twins. He met another woman after moving to Dorset. She also became pregnant, giving birth to a son, and they married in 1994, after living together for several years. Morgan had a reputation as a womaniser, seducing customers while working as an engineer. He continued this activity after becoming a lorry driver. Following his conviction, his brother Ray Morgan said, "He has had so many affairs over the years I have lost count." He also had a violent temper. One friend, Dave Moemken, described him as being "on a short fuse".&lt;ref name=DailyMail-1996-10-17/&gt;

Morgan was driving from [[Leeds]] to [[Southampton Docks]] when he picked up Figard on 19 December 1995.&lt;ref name=DailyMail-1996-10-17/&gt; Detectives concluded that after raping and killing her, Morgan left her body in the bottom bunk of his cab for up to ten days while he continued to drive the lorry, driving and sleeping in it for at least some of that time,&lt;ref name=DailyMail-1996-10-17/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent-1996-10-17/&gt; before disposing of the body on 29 December.&lt;ref name=Independent-1996-10-17&gt;{{cite news |first=Clare |last=Garner |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/life-for-lorry-driver-who-ended-celines-journey-of-optimism-1358724.html |title=Life for lorry driver who ended Celine's journey of optimism |publisher=Independent Print Ltd |newspaper=The Independent |date=17 October 1996 |accessdate=22 August 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714160235/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/life-for-lorry-driver-who-ended-celines-journey-of-optimism-1358724.html |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested in February 1996 after another lorry driver recognised him from a photofit. Morgan initially denied meeting her, but after he was picked out at an [[Police lineup|identity parade]], he claimed he and Figard had met and engaged in consensual sex.&lt;ref name="DailyRecord-1996-10-17" /&gt;

==Trial==
The trial began at [[Worcester Crown Court]] on 2 October 1996,&lt;ref name="Independent-1996-10-03"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/driver-hid-celines-body-in-his-lorry-1355356.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714173629/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/driver-hid-celines-body-in-his-lorry-1355356.html|title=Driver `hid Celine's body in his lorry'|date=3 October 1996|archive-date=14 July 2014|publisher=Independent Print ltd|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; before Mr Justice Latham and a jury.&lt;ref name=Independent-1996-10-17/&gt; Morgan's trial counsel was Nigel Jones [[Queen's Counsel|QC]],&lt;ref name=DailyMail-1996-10-11/&gt; and the case was prosecuted by David Farrer QC.&lt;ref name=Independent-1996-10-03/&gt; Morgan denied the charge.&lt;ref name=Independent-1996-10-17/&gt;

[[File:Crown Court on Foregate street - geograph.org.uk - 1164418.jpg|thumb|right|Morgan's trial was held at Worcester Crown Court in October 1996.]]
The prosecution account was that Morgan raped and killed Figard on the afternoon or evening of 19 December 1995, then kept her body in his cab for ten days before disposing of it.&lt;ref name=DailyMail-1996-10-03/&gt; Farrer told the court that she had been strangled and battered around the head with a heavy object, and injuries to her face were "consistent with kicking and stamping". There was also evidence to suggest her hands had been taped together, with the prosecution of the opinion she had been "intimidated" into having sex.&lt;ref name=DailyMail-1996-10-03/&gt;

Evidence was presented by the prosecution to suggest that Morgan continued to use the vehicle while Figard's body lay in the cab, and that the lorry was parked outside his house over the Christmas period. Farrer said Morgan bought a spade, axe and hacksaw with the intention of dismembering the body, but changed his mind,&lt;ref name=DailyMail-1996-10-03/&gt; instead making an overnight delivery run to dispose of it.&lt;ref name=Independent-1996-10-03/&gt; After removing a fuse from his lorry's [[tachograph]] to conceal the journey, he drove to Worcestershire.&lt;ref name=Independent-1996-10-03/&gt; Discrepancies were subsequently found in his travel records for 29 December 1995 because he forgot to replace the fuse following the trip.&lt;ref name=Independent-1996-10-03/&gt; DNA tests on spots of blood found in the cab matched Figard, while a blood-soaked mattress was found in Morgan's garage.&lt;ref name=DailyMail-1996-10-03/&gt; Several items belonging to Figard, including photographs and a toilet bag, were recovered from his house.&lt;ref name=Mirror-1996-10-04&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Celine+photos+at+trucker's+home.-a061272545|title= Celine photos at trucker's home|first= Bill|last= Daniels|newspaper= The Mirror|publisher= Mirror Group Newspapers|date= 4 October 1996|accessdate= 23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of her clothing was found close to a warehouse he had visited the night the body was dumped.&lt;ref name=DailyMail-1996-10-03/&gt; Morgan gave two bottles of Pascal Chretien that Figard had brought to England as Christmas presents to two garage attendants who worked at a [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] station opposite his house.&lt;ref name=DailyMail-1996-10-03/&gt;

On 16 October, a jury took three and a half hours to convict Morgan of Figard's murder, and he was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] with a recommendation that the [[Home Secretary]] should decide his [[parole]] eligibility.&lt;ref name=DailyMail-1996-10-17&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-111320617.html|title= As lorry driver is sent down for life, police reveal there may be a stringof other victims|first= Luke|last= Harding|newspaper= Daily Mail|publisher= Associated Newspapers Ltd|subscription= yes|date= 17 October 1996|accessdate= 23 August 2012|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130125043323/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-111320617.html|archivedate= 25 January 2013|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyRecord-1996-10-17/&gt; Passing sentence, Mr Justice Latham said, "What you did to Céline has caused revulsion in the minds of all right-thinking people.

==Appeals==
Morgan [[appeal]]ed his conviction on the grounds that it was unfair due to the level of publicity the case had received. His application was rejected by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]] on 5 February 1998 after the three sitting judges ruled there were insufficient grounds to justify an appeal.&lt;ref name=BirminghamPost-1998-02-06&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Celine+killer's+appeal+bid+is+turned+down.-a060790110|title= Celine killer's appeal bid is turned down|publisher= Mirror Group Newspapers|newspaper= The Birmingham Post|date= 6 February 1998|accessdate= 25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, Morgan appealed again under paragraph 3 of Schedule 22 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]] to the [[High Court of England and Wales]] requesting a review of the minimum term recommendation. This too was rejected, in July of that year, with the presiding judge, [[Peter Openshaw|Mr Justice Openshaw]] recommending, "The sentence is&amp;nbsp;– and remains&amp;nbsp;– a sentence of imprisonment for life. The defendant may not even be considered for release until he has served at least 20 years (less the time served before sentence). That is not to say that he will then be released; indeed he will be detained unless and until the Parole Board is satisfied that he no longer presents a risk to the public. Even if the Parole Board decides then or at some time in the future to authorise his release, he will be upon licence which will extend for the rest of his life."&lt;ref name=Openshaw/&gt;

In January 2016, Morgan appealed against the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] after it decided not to downgrade his prisoner status from that of a [[Prisoner security categories in the United Kingdom|Category A prisoner]], as well as challenging the [[Parole Board for England and Wales|Parole Board]] for refusing to allow him an oral hearing. A hearing at the High Court on 26 January was told that under the terms of his sentence, Morgan would be eligible for parole from February, but had continued to maintain his innocence throughout his time in prison, claiming to be in a "[[Catch-22 (logic)|Catch-22]]" situation where he could not qualify for release without admitting his guilt. Rejecting Morgan's case, Justice [[William Davis (judge)|William Davis]] suggested that Morgan had not "addressed his offending behaviour" and was "in effect in the same position as in December 1995, when he murdered his victim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tarik |last=Al Rasheed |url=http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/news/14231324.Lorry_driver_who_murdered_teenager_can_ask_to_be_freed/ |title=Lorry driver who murdered teenager can ask to be freed |newspaper=Worcester News) |publisher=Newsquest |date=26 January 2016 |accessdate=24 May 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803062805/http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/news/14231324.Lorry_driver_who_murdered_teenager_can_ask_to_be_freed/ |archivedate=3 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 December 2000, the fifth anniversary of the date Figard's body was recovered, the local newspaper, the ''[[Worcester News]]'' reported that an annual service of remembrance was held for her at the church during the autumn, attended by her parents. Flowers were also regularly placed at the lay-by at Hawford where she was found, and the location named ''Le Jardin de Céline'' (Céline's Garden) in her memory.&lt;ref name=WorcesterNews-2000-12-29/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Jean|last=Pascal|url=http://archives.lesoir.be/les-parents-de-la-jeune-fille-ont-salue-la-police-brita_t-19961017-Z0CRKH.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214062931/http://archives.lesoir.be/les-parents-de-la-jeune-fille-ont-salue-la-police-brita_t-19961017-Z0CRKH.html|title=Les parents de la jeune fille ont salut la police Britanni |work=Le Soir|publisher=Rossel &amp; Cie.

"'''New Lease'''" is an episode of ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' television. It first aired on 21 March 1997, during the third season.

==Introduction==
Dr. James Houghton and Dr. Charles McCamber, working in secret, develop a means of [[resurrection|revitalising the dead]].

==Opening narration==
{{cquote|''The quest to conquer death is as old as man himself. We conjure dark angels, whose untimely arrival we hope to avert with guile and perseverance. But in the end it is inevitably the grave, not hope, which prevails.''}}

==Plot==
After a semi-successful test—a patient is revived, but immediately begins a painful deterioration—Dr. Houghton is assaulted and killed in a robbery attempt. He is revived believing that he has only a few days to live. Fearing that he has neglected his wife, he tries at first to make up for it by showering her with attention and affection—but his resentment toward the man who murdered him takes over.  Certain that he will die soon, he takes revenge on the robber—only to find out later that he will live. He is arrested later that day on murder charges.

'''Nonviolent resistance''' ('''NVR''' or '''nonviolent action''') is the practice of achieving [[goal]]s such as social change through [[symbol]]ic [[protest]]s, [[civil disobedience]], economic or political noncooperation, [[satyagraha]], or other methods, while being [[nonviolent]]. This type of action highlights the desires of an individual or group that feels that something needs to change to improve the current condition of the resisting person or group. It is largely but wrongly taken as synonymous with [[civil resistance]]. Each of these terms—''nonviolent resistance'' and ''civil resistance''—has different connotations and commitments.

Major nonviolent resistance advocates include [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Te Whiti o Rongomai]], [[Tohu Kākahi]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Alice Paul]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr]], [[Daniel Berrigan]], [[Philip Berrigan]], [[James Bevel]], [[Václav Havel]], [[Andrei Sakharov]], [[Lech Wałęsa]], [[Gene Sharp]], [[Nelson Mandela]], and many others. There are hundreds of books and papers on the subject—see [[#Further reading|Further reading]] below.

From 1966 to 1999, nonviolent civic resistance played a critical role in fifty of sixty-seven transitions from [[authoritarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aforcemorepowerful.org/game/index.php|title=A Force More Powerful|publisher=A Force More Powerful|date=2010-07-01|accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, nonviolent resistance has led to the [[Rose Revolution]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and the [[Tunisian Revolution|Jasmine Revolution]] in [[Tunisia]]. Current nonviolent resistance includes the [[Jeans Revolution]] in Belarus, the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement in the United States, and the fight of the [[Cuban dissidents]].
Many movements which promote philosophies of [[nonviolence]] or [[pacifism]] have pragmatically adopted the methods of nonviolent action as an effective way to achieve social or [[politics|political]] goals.  They employ nonviolent resistance tactics such as: [[information warfare]], [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]], [[Demonstration (protest)|marches]], [[vigil]]s, leafletting, [[samizdat]], [[magnitizdat]], [[satyagraha]], [[protest art]], [[Protest song|protest music]] and poetry, community education and [[consciousness raising]], [[lobbying]], [[tax resistance]], [[civil disobedience]], [[boycott]]s or [[Economic sanctions|sanctions]], legal/diplomatic wrestling, [[Underground Railroad|underground railroads]], principled refusal of awards/honors, and [[general strike]]s. Nonviolent action differs from pacifism by potentially being proactive and interventionist.

A great deal of work has addressed the factors that lead to violent mobilization, but less attention has been paid to understanding why disputes become violent or nonviolent, comparing these two as strategic choices relative to conventional politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cunningham|first1=K.

|The [[Moriori people|Moriori]] were a branch of the New Zealand [[Māori people|Māori]] that colonized the [[Chatham Islands]] and eventually became [[hunter-gatherer]]s. Their lack of resources and small population made [[conventional war]] unsustainable, so it became customary to resolve disputes nonviolently or [[Championship|ritually]]. Due to this tradition of nonviolence, the entire population of 2000 people was enslaved, killed or cannibalized when 900 Māori invaded the island in 1835.

|[[Peterloo massacre]]
| Famine and chronic unemployment, coupled with the lack of [[suffrage]] in [[northern England]], led to a peaceful demonstration of 60,000–80,000 persons, including women and children. The demonstration was organized and rehearsed, with a "prohibition of all weapons of offence or defence" and exhortations to come "armed with no other weapon but that of a self-approving conscience". [[Cavalry]] charged into the crowd, with [[sabre]]s drawn, and in the ensuing confusion, 15 people were killed and 400–700 were injured. Newspapers expressed horror, and [[Percy Shelley]] glorified nonviolent resistance in the poem [[The Masque of Anarchy]]. However, the [[British government]] cracked down on reform, with the passing of what became known as the [[Six Acts]].

In 1834 at an address by the Governor at Government House about the new laws, an unarmed group of mainly elderly people of African descent began chanting: "Pas de six ans. Point de six ans" ("No six years. Not at all six years"), drowning out the voice of the Governor. Peaceful protests continued until the passing of a resolution to abolish apprenticeship and the achievement of de facto freedom.

|[[Austrian Empire]]
|[[Passive Resistance (Hungary)]]
| In the failed [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]], the Hungarians tried to regain independence, and were defeated by the Austrian Empire only with the aid of the [[Russian Empire]]. After 1848, the empire instituted several constitutional reforms, trying to resolve the problem, but without success. The resistance was instrumental in keeping up hope and spirit in a Hungary fully incorporated into Austria and characterized by reprisals against political dissidents, thousands of treason trials, military governance, centralization, absolutism, censorship and direct control of Vienna over every aspect of public life. Their followers carefully avoided any political agitation or criticism of the establishment, and strictly concentrated on national issues of non-political nature, such as the use of the [[Hungarian language]], development of the Hungarian economy, and protection of the legal standing of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].

After 1874, wing of the party disagreeing with passive resistance stance, formed new [[Young Czech Party]]. Old Czechs remained with their politics, but they lost decisive influence in the politics of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]].

|[[Māori King]] [[Tāwhiao]] forbade [[Waikato]] Māori using violence in the face of British [[colonisation]], saying in 1881, "The killing of men must stop; the destruction of land must stop. I shall bury my patu in the earth and it shall not rise again ... Waikato, lie down. Do not allow blood to flow from this time on." This was inspirational to Waikato Māori who refused to fight in [[World War I]]. In response, the [[New Zealand Government|government]] brought in [[conscription]] for the Tainui-Waikato people (other Māori [[iwi]] were exempt) but they continued to resist, the majority of conscripts choosing to suffer harsh military punishments rather than join the army. For the duration of the war, no Tainui soldiers were sent overseas.

For example, citizens of the Palestinian village of [[Beit Sahour]] engaged in a tax strike during the First Intifada.

In 2010, A "White Intifada" took hold in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Activities included weekly peaceful protests by Palestinian activists accompanied by Israeli human rights organization [[B'Tselem]] and Israeli academics and students against settlers and security forces. The EU, through its foreign policy chief [[Catherine Ashton]] has criticised Israel for convicting an organiser of the peaceful movement and said that she was deeply concerned about the arrest of Abdullah Abu Rahmeh. There have been two fatalities among protesters and an American peace activist suffered brain damage after being hit by a tear gas canister.

|A tense standoff and potential riot between Hundreds of LAPD riot gear-laden police officers, who were determined to quell the swelling crowds that exceeded four hundred homosexual citizens, was averted after a last minute plea from then new Governor [[Ronald Reagan]], via an openly gay Republican Judicial Appointee who acted as a personal envoy of the Governor to LAPD Commanders at the site of the standoff, was accepted, and a stand down order given which ordered the hundreds of [[LAPD]] officers present to cease and desist from further unprovoked harassment of homosexuals in Los Angeles for decades.  The plea was successfully communicated and accepted by the LAPD hierarchy, and represented the first time that a stand down order was given by the LAPD, and was the last time until 2001, that the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] would engage in raiding an establishment, or public assembly of homosexuals in Los Angeles for decades.  The hundreds who gathered to peacefully protest raids perceived as unwarranted, and often violent, against [[LGBT]] meeting sites in Los Angeles, observed a success in the struggle for Homosexual [[Civil Rights]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11793">At the modern [[Olympic Games]], {{As of|2016|alt=up to and including the [[2016 Summer Paralympics]]}}, 10 athletes have died while either competing in or practicing their sport. In addition, another 14 participants have died at the Olympics from other causes; 11 of these deaths resulted from the [[Munich massacre]] of 1972.

Several incidents related to the Olympics have caused the death of non-participants.  Large numbers were killed during the [[1964 Lima football riot|Lima football riot]] of 1964 and the [[Tlatelolco massacre]] in Mexico City in 1968. The [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing]] at the 1996 Games caused two deaths.

==Deaths of non-participants at Olympic-related events==

=== Lima 1964 ===
{{main|1964 Lima football riot}}
In a qualifying match for the [[Football at the 1964 Summer Olympics|Olympic football tournament]], home fans began rioting after a late Peru goal was disallowed. Police fired [[tear gas]] into the crowd, exacerbating the situation, which ended with 318 deaths.

=== Mexico 1968 ===
{{main|Tlatelolco massacre}}
The [[Mexico 68]] protests were part of [[Protests of 1968|a worldwide series of leftwing student-led protests]]. While the protesting [[National Strike Council]] claimed not to link its demands to the Olympics, some students protested at the perceived extravagance of hosting the games, and some sought to exploit the increased foreign media presence in the city for publicity. The authoritarian government had a secret "Olympia Battalion" to ensure security during the Games. Ten days before the games, the unit swept through a mass meeting in the [[Plaza de las Tres Culturas]] making arrests. Estimates of the number killed in the operation range from thirty to several hundred.

===1996 Olympic Park Bombing===
{{main|Centennial Olympic Park bombing}}

=== Athens 2004 Paralympics ===
Seven teenagers from [[Farkadona]] were killed in a crash whilst travelling to Athens for the Games, when their bus collided with a truck near the town of [[Kamena Vourla]]. Out of respect for their death, the cultural portion of the closing ceremonies of these Paralympics were cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/28/sport.samjones|title=Seven children die in Paralympics bus crash|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|first=Sam|last=Jones|date=28 September 2004|accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3693934.stm|title=Games finale cut after bus deaths|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=27 September 2004|accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===London 2012===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="828">'''Palliative surgery''' is [[surgical]] intervention targeted to make a [[patient]]’s [[symptom]]s less severe, thus make the patient’s quality of life better despite negligible impact on the patient’s survival. Palliative surgery focuses on supplying the greatest benefit to the patient using the least invasive intervention. Palliative surgery provides symptom relief and preservation of the quality of life in terminal disease states. The uses of palliative surgery can range from extensive debulking operations to less complex operations.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemarie E. Hardin and Michael E.

'''''Pioneer 10''''' (originally designated '''Pioneer F''') is an American [[space probe]], launched in 1972 and weighing {{convert|258|kg|lb|lk=on|abbr=off|sp=us}}, that completed the first mission to the planet [[Jupiter]].&lt;ref name="PionOdys" /&gt; Thereafter, ''Pioneer 10'' became the [[List of artificial objects leaving the Solar System|first of five artificial objects]] to achieve the [[escape velocity]] that will allow them to [[Solar System#Farthest regions|leave the Solar System]]. This [[space exploration]] project was conducted by the [[NASA Ames Research Center]] in [[California]], and the space probe was manufactured by [[TRW Inc.]]

''Pioneer 10'' was assembled around a hexagonal [[satellite bus|bus]] with a {{convert|2.74|m|sp=us|adj=on}} diameter parabolic dish high-gain antenna, and the spacecraft was [[Spin-stabilisation|spin stabilized]] around the axis of the antenna. Its [[electric power]] was supplied by four [[radioisotope thermoelectric generators]] that provided a combined 155 watts at launch.

It was launched on March 2, 1972, by an Atlas-Centaur expendable vehicle from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 36|Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]]. Between July 15, 1972, and February 15, 1973, it became the first spacecraft to traverse the [[asteroid belt#Exploration|asteroid belt]]. Photography of Jupiter began November 6, 1973, at a range of {{convert|25,000,000|km|sp=us}}, and a total of about 500 images were transmitted. The closest approach to the planet was on December 4, 1973, at a range of {{convert|132,252|km|sp=us}}. During the mission, the on-board instruments were used to study the asteroid belt, the environment around Jupiter, the [[solar wind]], [[cosmic ray]]s, and eventually the far reaches of the Solar System and [[heliosphere]].&lt;ref name="PionOdys" /&gt;

[[Radio communications]] were lost with ''Pioneer 10'' on January 23, 2003, because of the loss of electric power for its [[radio transmitter]], with the probe at a distance of {{convert|12|e9km|lk=out|sp=us}} from Earth.

In the 1960s, American aerospace engineer [[Gary Flandro]] of the NASA [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] conceived of a mission, known as the [[Planetary Grand Tour]], that would exploit a rare alignment of the outer planets of the Solar System. This mission would ultimately be accomplished in the late 1970s by the two [[Voyager program|Voyager]] probes, but in order to prepare for it, NASA decided in 1964 to experiment with launching a pair of probes to the [[outer Solar System]].{{sfn|Launius|2004|p=36}} An advocacy group named the Outer Space Panel and chaired by American space scientist [[James A. Van Allen]], worked out the scientific rationale for exploring the outer planets.{{sfn|Van Allen|2001|p=155}}{{sfn|Burrows|1990|pp=16}} NASA [[Goddard Space Flight Center|Goddard]] Spaceflight Center put together a proposal for a pair of "Galactic Jupiter Probes" that would pass through the asteroid belt and visit Jupiter. These were to be launched in 1972 and 1973 during favorable windows that occurred only a few weeks every 13 months. Launch during other time intervals would have been more costly in terms of propellant requirements.{{sfn|Burrows|1999|p=476}}

Approved by NASA in February 1969,{{sfn|Burrows|1999|p=476}} the twin spacecraft were designated Pioneer F and Pioneer G before launch; later they were named ''Pioneer 10'' and ''[[Pioneer 11]]''. They formed part of the [[Pioneer program]],{{sfn|Burgess|1982|p=16}} a series of United States [[unmanned space missions]] launched between 1958 and 1978. This model was the first in the series to be designed for exploring the outer Solar System. Based on multiple proposals issued throughout the 1960s, the early mission objectives were to explore the interplanetary medium past the orbit of Mars, study the asteroid belt and assess the possible hazard to spacecraft traveling through the belt, and explore Jupiter and its environment.&lt;ref name=NASA_sp349_396/&gt; Later development-stage objectives included the probe closely approaching Jupiter to provide data on the effect the environmental radiation surrounding Jupiter would have on the spacecraft instruments.

More than 150 scientific experiments were proposed for the missions.{{sfn|Simpson|2001|p=144}} The experiments to be carried on the spacecraft were selected in a series of planning sessions during the 1960s, then were finalized by early 1970. These would be to perform imaging and [[polarimetry]] of Jupiter and several of its satellites, make infrared and ultraviolet observations of Jupiter, detect asteroids and meteoroids, determine the composition of charged particles, and to measure magnetic fields, plasma, cosmic rays and the [[Zodiacal Light]].&lt;ref name=NASA_sp349_396/&gt; Observation of the spacecraft communications as it passed behind Jupiter would allow measurements of the planetary atmosphere, while tracking data would improve estimates of the mass of Jupiter and its moons.&lt;ref name=NASA_sp349_396/&gt;

[[NASA Ames Research Center]], rather than Goddard, was selected to manage the project as part of the Pioneer program.{{sfn|Burrows|1999|p=476}} The Ames Research Center, under the direction of Charles F. Hall, was chosen because of its previous experience with spin-stabilized spacecraft. The requirements called for a small, lightweight spacecraft which was magnetically clean and which could perform an interplanetary mission. It was to use spacecraft modules that had already been proven in the Pioneer 6 through 9 missions.&lt;ref name=NASA_sp349_396/&gt;Ames commissioned a documentary film by George Van Valkenburg titled "Jupiter Odyssey". It received numerous international awards, and is visible on Van Valkenburg's YouTube channel. 

In February 1970, Ames awarded a combined $380 million contract to TRW for building both of the ''Pioneer 10'' and ''11'' vehicles, bypassing the usual bidding process to save time. B. J. O'Brien and Herb Lassen led the TRW team that assembled the spacecraft.{{sfn|Dyer|1998|p=302}} Design and construction of the spacecraft required an estimated 25 million man-hours.{{sfn|Wolverton|2004|p=124}}  An engineer from TRW said "This spacecraft is guaranteed for two years of interplanetary flight. If any component fails within that warranty period, just return the spacecraft to our shop and we will repair it free of charge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://aviationweek.com/awin/pioneer-beat-warranty|title= PIONEER BEAT 'WARRANTY'|publisher= Aviation Week |accessdate= 2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To meet the schedule, the first launch would need to take place between February 29 and March 17 so that it could arrive at Jupiter in November 1974. This was later revised to an arrival date of December 1973 in order to avoid conflicts with other missions over the use of the [[Deep Space Network]] for communications, and to miss the period when Earth and Jupiter would be at opposite sides of the Sun. The encounter trajectory for ''Pioneer 10'' was selected to maximize the information returned about the radiation environment around Jupiter, even if this caused damage to some systems. It would come within about three times the radius of the planet, which was thought to be the closest it could approach and still survive the radiation. The trajectory chosen would give the spacecraft a good view of the sunlit side.{{sfn|Burrows|1990|pp=16&amp;ndash;19}}

===Spacecraft design===
[[File:Pioneer 10 systems diagram.svg|right|thumb|''Pioneer 10'' and ''Pioneer 11'' spacecraft diagram]]
The ''Pioneer 10'' bus measured {{convert|36|cm|in|sp=us}} deep and with six {{convert|76|cm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} long panels forming the hexagonal structure. The bus housed propellant to control the orientation of the probe and eight of the eleven scientific instruments. The equipment compartment lay within an aluminum honeycomb structure to provide protection from [[meteoroid]]s. A layer of insulation, consisting of aluminized [[mylar]] and [[kapton]] blankets, provided passive thermal control. Heat was generated by the dissipation of 70 to 120 [[watt]]s (W) from the electrical components inside the compartment. The heat range was maintained within the operating limits of the equipment by means of louvers located below the mounting platform.&lt;ref name=prd65_8/&gt; The spacecraft had a launch mass of about {{convert|260|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref name="PionOdys"/&gt;{{rp|42}}

At launch, the spacecraft carried {{convert|36|kg|lb|sp=us}} of liquid [[hydrazine]] [[monopropellant rocket|monopropellant]] in a {{convert|42|cm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} diameter spherical tank.&lt;ref name=prd65_8/&gt; Orientation of the spacecraft was maintained with six 4.5 [[Newton (unit)|N]],&lt;ref name='Astronautix'&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Wade | first = Mark | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia Astronautica | title = Pioneer 10-11 | url = http://astronautix.com/craft/pior1011.htm | accessdate = 2011-02-08 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101120084730/http://astronautix.com/craft/pior1011.htm | archivedate = 2010-11-20 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; hydrazine thrusters mounted in three pairs. Pair one maintained a constant spin-rate of 4.8 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]], pair two controlled the forward thrust, and pair three controlled the attitude. The attitude pair were used in [[conical scanning]] maneuvers to track Earth in its orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Weebau Spaceflight Encyclopedia| date = 9 November 2010| url = http://weebau.com/satplan/pioneer%2010.htm| accessdate = 12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orientation information was also provided by a [[Star tracker#Star tracker|star sensor]] able to reference [[Canopus]], and two [[Sun sensor]]s.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|pp=46–47}}

''Pioneer 10'' used four [[SNAP-19]] [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s (RTGs). They were positioned on two three-rod trusses, each {{convert|3|m|ft|sp=us}} in length and 120 degrees apart. This was expected to be a safe distance from the sensitive scientific experiments carried on board. Combined, the RTGs provided 155&amp;nbsp;W at launch, and decayed to 140&amp;nbsp;W in transit to Jupiter. The spacecraft required 100&amp;nbsp;W to power all systems.&lt;ref name="PionOdys"/&gt;{{rp|44–45}} The generators were powered by the radioisotope fuel [[plutonium-238]], which was housed in a multi-layer capsule protected by a graphite heat shield.&lt;ref name=skrabek_mcgrew1987/&gt;

The pre-launch requirement for the SNAP-19 was to provide power for two years in space; this was greatly exceeded during the mission.&lt;ref name=bennett_skrabek1996/&gt; The plutonium-238 has a [[half-life]] of 87.74 years, so that after 29 years the radiation being generated by the RTGs was at 80% of its intensity at launch. However, steady deterioration of the [[thermocouple]] junctions led to a more rapid decay in electrical power generation, and by 2001 the total power output was 65&amp;nbsp;W. As a result, later in the mission only selected instruments could be operated at any one time.&lt;ref name=prd65_8/&gt;

The space probe included a redundant system of [[transceiver]]s, one attached to the narrow-beam, [[high-gain antenna]], the other to an omni-antenna and medium-gain antenna. The parabolic dish for the high-gain antenna was {{convert|2.74|m|ft|sp=us}} in diameter and made from an aluminum honeycomb sandwich material. The spacecraft was spun  about an axis that was parallel to the axis of this antenna so that it could remain oriented toward the Earth.&lt;ref name=prd65_8/&gt; Each transceiver was 8&amp;nbsp;W and transmitted data across the [[S-band]] using 2110&amp;nbsp;MHz for the uplink from Earth and 2292&amp;nbsp;MHz for the downlink to Earth with the [[Deep Space Network]] tracking the signal. Data to be transmitted was passed through a [[convolution code|convolutional encoder]] so that most communication errors could be [[error detection and correction|corrected]] by the receiving equipment on Earth.&lt;ref name="PionOdys"/&gt;{{rp|43}} The data transmission rate at launch was 256&amp;nbsp;bit/s, with the rate degrading by about &amp;minus;1.27&amp;nbsp;millibit/s for each day during the mission.&lt;ref name=prd65_8/&gt;

Much of the computation for the mission was performed on Earth and transmitted to the spacecraft, where it was able to retain in memory up to five commands of the 222 possible entries by ground controllers. The spacecraft included two command decoders and a command distribution unit, a very limited form of processor, to direct operations on the spacecraft. This system required that mission operators prepare commands long in advance of transmitting them to the probe. A data storage unit was included to record up to 6,144 [[bytes]] of information gathered by the instruments. The digital telemetry unit was used to prepare the collected data in one of the thirteen possible formats before transmitting it back to Earth.&lt;ref name="PionOdys"/&gt;{{rp|38}}

''Pioneer 10'' was launched on March 3, 1972 at 01:49:00 UTC (March 2 local time) by the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 36|Space Launch Complex 36A]] in Florida, aboard an Atlas-Centaur launch vehicle. The third stage consisted of a solid fuel [[TE364-4]] developed specifically for the Pioneer missions. This stage provided about 15,000 pounds of thrust and spun up the spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Twenty minutes following the launch, the vehicle's three booms were extended, which slowed the rotation rate to 4.8 rpm. This rate was maintained throughout the voyage. The launch vehicle accelerated the probe for net interval of 17 minutes, reaching a velocity of 51,682&amp;nbsp;km/h (32,114&amp;nbsp;mph).{{sfn|Rogers|1995|p=23}}

After the high-gain antenna was contacted, several of the instruments were activated for testing while the spacecraft was moving through the Earth's radiation belts. Ninety minutes after launch, the spacecraft reached interplanetary space.{{sfn|Rogers|1995|p=23}} ''Pioneer 10'' passed by the Moon in 11 hours{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|p=73}} and became the fastest human-made object at that time.{{sfn|Burrows|1990|pp=17}} Two days after launch, the scientific instruments were turned on, beginning with the cosmic ray telescope. After ten days, all of the instruments were active.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|p=73}}

During the first seven months of the journey, the spacecraft made three course corrections. The on-board instruments underwent checkouts, with the [[photometer]]s examining Jupiter and the [[Zodiacal light]], and experiment packages being used to measure cosmic rays, magnetic fields and the solar wind. The only anomaly during this interval was the failure of the Canopus sensor, which instead required the spacecraft to maintain its orientation using the two Sun sensors.{{sfn|Rogers|1995|p=23}}

While passing through [[interplanetary medium]], ''Pioneer 10'' became the first mission to detect interplanetary atoms of helium. It also observed high-energy ions of aluminum and sodium in the solar wind. On July 15, 1972, ''Pioneer 10'' was the first spacecraft to enter the asteroid belt, located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The project planners expected a safe passage through the belt, and the closest the trajectory would take the spacecraft to any of the known asteroids was {{convert|8,800,000|km|sp=us}}. One of the nearest approaches was to the asteroid [[307 Nike]] on December 2, 1972.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|p=75}}

The on-board experiments demonstrated a deficiency of particles below a [[micrometre|micrometer]] (μm) in the belt, as compared to the vicinity of the Earth. The density of dust particles between 10–100&amp;nbsp;μm did not vary significantly during the trip from the Earth to the outer edge of the belt. Only for particles with a diameter of 100&amp;nbsp;μm to 1.0&amp;nbsp;mm did the density show an increase, by a factor of three in the region of the belt. No fragments larger than a millimeter were observed in the belt, indicating these are likely rare; certainly much less common than anticipated. As the spacecraft did not collide with any particles of substantial size, it passed safely through the belt, emerging on the other side about February 15, 1973.&lt;ref name=ns57_835_470/&gt;{{sfn|Burgess|1982|p=32}}

===Encounter with Jupiter===

On November 6, 1973, the ''Pioneer 10'' spacecraft was at a distance of {{convert|25|e6km|sp=us}} from Jupiter. Testing of the imaging system began, and the data was successfully received back at the Deep Space Network. A series of 16,000 commands were then uploaded to the spacecraft to control the flyby operations during the next sixty days. The orbit of the outer moon [[Sinope (moon)|Sinope]] was crossed on November 8. The [[bow shock]] of Jupiter's magnetosphere was reached on November 16, as indicated by a drop in the velocity of the [[solar wind]] from {{convert|451|km/s|abbr=on|sp=us}} to {{convert|225|km/s|abbr=on|sp=us}}. The [[magnetopause]] was passed through a day later. The spacecraft instruments confirmed that the magnetic field of Jupiter was inverted compared to that of Earth. By the 29th, the orbits of all of the outermost moons had been passed and the spacecraft was operating flawlessly.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|pp=79–93}}

Red and blue pictures of Jupiter were being generated by the imaging photopolarimeter as the rotation of the spacecraft carried the instrument's field of view past the planet. These red and blue colors were combined to produce a synthetic green image, allowing a three-color combination to produce the rendered image. On November 26, a total of twelve such images were received back on Earth. By December 2, the image quality exceeded the best images made from Earth. These were being displayed in real-time back on Earth, and the Pioneer program would later receive an [[Emmy award]] for this presentation to the media. The motion of the spacecraft produced geometric distortions that later had to be corrected by computer processing.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|pp=79–93}} During the encounter, a total of more than 500 images were transmitted.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|p=170}}

The trajectory of the spacecraft took it along the magnetic equator of Jupiter, where the [[Particle radiation|ion radiation]] was concentrated.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|p=93}} Peak [[flux]] for this electron radiation is 10,000 times stronger than the maximum radiation around the Earth.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|p=126}} Starting on December 3, the radiation around Jupiter caused false commands to be generated. Most of these were corrected by contingency commands, but an image of [[Io (moon)|Io]] and a few close ups of Jupiter were lost. Similar false commands would be generated on the way out from the planet.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|pp=79–93}} Nonetheless, ''Pioneer 10'' did succeed in obtaining images of the moons [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] and [[Europa (moon)|Europa]]. The image of Ganymede showed low [[albedo]] features in the center and near the south pole, while the north pole appeared brighter. Europa was too far away to obtain a detailed image, although some albedo features were apparent.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|p=121}}

The trajectory of ''Pioneer 10'' was chosen to take it behind Io, allowing the [[Refraction|refractive effect]] of the moon's atmosphere on the radio transmissions to be measured. This demonstrated that the [[ionosphere]] of the moon was about {{convert|700|km|sp=us}} above the surface on the day side, and the density ranged from 60,000 electrons per cubic centimeter on the day side, down to 9,000 on the night face. An unexpected discovery was that Io was orbiting within a cloud of hydrogen that extended for about {{convert|805,000|km|sp=us}}, with a width and height of {{convert|402,000|km|sp=us}}. A smaller, {{convert|110,000|km|sp=us}} cloud was believed to have been detected near Europa.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|p=121}}

It wasn't until after ''Pioneer 10'' had cleared the asteroid belt that NASA selected a trajectory towards Jupiter that offered the slingshot effect that would send the spacecraft out of the solar system. ''Pioneer 10'' was the first spacecraft to attempt such a maneuver and became a proof of concept for the missions that would follow. Such an extended mission was not originally something that was planned, but was planned for prior to launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NASA says 'bye bye Birdie' to  Pioneer 10 Spacecraft|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/10191839|accessdate=6 December 2017|work=The Salina Journal|date=13 June  1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the closest approach, the velocity of the spacecraft reached 132,000&amp;nbsp;km/h,{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|p=79}} and it came within {{convert|132,252|km|sp=us}} of the outer atmosphere of Jupiter. Close-up images of the Great Red Spot and the terminator were obtained. Communication with the spacecraft then ceased as it passed behind the planet.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|p=93}} The [[radio occultation]] data allowed the temperature structure of the outer atmosphere to be measured, showing a temperature inversion between the altitudes with 10 and 100&amp;nbsp;mbar pressures. Temperatures at the 10 mbar level ranged from {{convert|-133|to|-113|C}}, while temperatures at the 100&amp;nbsp;mbar level were {{convert|-183|to|-163|C}}.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|p=135}} The spacecraft generated an infrared map of the planet, which confirmed the idea that the planet radiated more heat than it received from the Sun.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|p=141}}

Crescent images of the planet were then returned as  ''Pioneer 10''  moved away from the planet.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|p=90}} As the spacecraft headed outward, it again passed the bow shock of Jupiter's magnetosphere. As this front is constantly shifting in space because of dynamic interaction with the solar wind, the vehicle crossed the bow shock a total of 17 times before it escaped completely.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|pp=123–124}}

===Deep space===
''Pioneer 10''  crossed the orbit of Saturn in 1976 and the orbit of Uranus in 1979.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|p=91}} On June 13, 1983, the craft crossed the orbit of [[Neptune]], the outermost planet, and so became the first human-made object to leave the proximity of the major planets of the Solar System. The mission came to an official end on March 31, 1997, when it had reached a distance of 67&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun, though the spacecraft was still able to transmit coherent data after this date.&lt;ref name=prd65_8/&gt;

After March 31, 1997, ''Pioneer 10's'' weak signal continued to be tracked by the Deep Space Network to aid the training of flight controllers in the process of acquiring deep space radio signals. There was an [[NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts|Advanced Concepts]] study applying [[chaos theory]] to extract coherent data from the fading signal.&lt;ref name=phillips2001/&gt;

The last successful reception of [[telemetry]] was received from ''Pioneer 10'' on April 27, 2002; subsequent signals were barely strong enough to detect, and provided no usable data. The final, very weak signal from ''Pioneer 10'' was received on January 23, 2003 when it was 12 billion kilometers (80 AU) from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;"This Month in History", ''Smithsonian'' magazine, June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Further attempts to contact the spacecraft were unsuccessful. A final attempt was made on the evening of March 4, 2006, the last time the antenna would be correctly aligned with Earth. No response was received from ''Pioneer 10''.&lt;ref name=lakdawalla2006/&gt; NASA decided that the RTG units had probably fallen below the power threshold needed to operate the transmitter. Hence, no further attempts at contact were made.{{sfn|Angelo|2007|p=221}}

==Current status and future==
[[File:Pio10 8feb2012.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Position of ''Pioneer 10'' on 8 February 2012]]
On January 1, 2019, ''Pioneer 10'' is predicted to be 121.69 [[astronomical unit|au]] from the Earth (about 11.3 billion miles); and traveling at {{convert|12.04|km/s|mph|abbr=on|sp=us}} (relative to the Sun) and traveling outward at about 2.54 [[astronomical unit|au]] per year.&lt;ref name="Peat-20120909"&gt;{{cite web |last=Peat |first=Chris |title=Spacecraft escaping the Solar System |url=http://www.heavens-above.com/SolarEscape.aspx |date=September 9, 2012 |publisher=[[Heavens-Above]] |accessdate=September 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Voyager 2'' is projected to pass ''Pioneer 10'' by April 2019. Sunlight takes 14.79 hours to reach ''Pioneer 10''. The brightness of the Sun from the spacecraft is magnitude &amp;minus;16.6.&lt;ref name="Peat-20120909" /&gt; ''Pioneer 10'' is heading in the direction of the constellation [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]].&lt;ref name="Peat-20120909" /&gt;

If left undisturbed, ''Pioneer 10'' and its sister craft ''Pioneer 11'' will join the two Voyager spacecraft and the ''[[New Horizons]]'' spacecraft in leaving the Solar System to wander the [[interstellar medium]]. The ''Pioneer 10'' trajectory is expected to take it in the general direction of the star [[Aldebaran]], currently located at a distance of about 68&amp;nbsp;[[light year]]s. If Aldebaran had zero [[relative velocity]], it would require more than two million years for the spacecraft to reach it.&lt;ref name=prd65_8/&gt;&lt;ref name=chris_peat/&gt;

{{Eras of the Halakha}}
'''Abba ben Joseph bar Ḥama''' (c. 280 – 352 CE), who is exclusively referred to in the [[Talmud]] by the name '''Rava''' (רבא), was a fourth-generation rabbi (''[[Amoraim|amora]]'') who lived in Mahoza, a suburb of [[Ctesiphon]], the capital of [[Babylonia]]. He is one of the most often-cited rabbis in the [[Talmud]].

==Biography==
He studied at the [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia|Talmudical Academy]] at [[Pumbedita]], site of modern-day Falluja, Iraq. There he, traditionally, became famous for his debates with his study-partner [[Abaye]]. The debates between Abba ben Joseph and [[Abaye]] are considered classic examples of Talmudic dialectical logic. Of their hundreds of recorded disputes, the law is decided according to the opinion of Abba ben Joseph in all but six cases. His methodology greatly influenced not only his students, but the [[stammaim]], as well.&lt;ref name="StamIntro"&gt;{{cite web |authorlink=Drew Kaplan |title=An Intro to the Stam(maim) |work=Drew Kaplan's Blog |publisher=Blogspot |date=6 May 2008 |url=http://drewkaplans.blogspot.com/2008/05/intro-to-stammaim.html |accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rava married the daughter of third-generation amora Rav Hisda after she'd been widowed from Rami bar Chama. In TB Bava Batra 12b,  Rav Hisda's daughter is sitting in her father's classroom, while his students, Rava and Rami bar Chama, stand before them. When Rav Hisda asks her which of the two she wants to marry, she replies "both of them," and Rava adds, "I'll be the last one" (commentators let us know that she indeed married Rami first and Rava second). They had five sons, the eldest of whom, Joseph, died during his parents' lifetime.

When [[Rabbah bar Nahmani]], the head of the [[yeshiva]] of [[Pumbedita]], retired, the position went to [[Abaye]]. At that point, Abba ben Joseph returned to [[Mahoza]], in [[Babylonia]], where he established a yeshiva there. After the death of Abaye, many of his students moved from Pumbedita to Mahoza, to join Abba ben Joseph's Yeshiva, which had become one of the intellectual centers of the Babylonian Jewish Community. Rava died ca 355.

==Teachings==
Rava apparently had to reply to a deep-seated skepticism toward rabbinic authority  and to defend the authenticity of the rabbinic oral tradition. The skepticism of Mahozan Jewry was fueled in part by the acceptance of the [[Manichaean]] polemic against [[Zoroastrianism]] and its insistence on oral transmission, and by a strong concern with the problem of [[theodicy]], encouraged by a familiarity with Zoroastrian theology.  Rava’s creativity was fueled by his cosmopolitan urban environment. For instance, he ruled that one who habitually ate certain non-kosher foods because he liked the taste was nevertheless trustworthy as a witness in cases involving civil matters. So too did he suggest that a lost object belongs to the person who discovers it even before the loser is aware of his loss, because it prevented the loser from resorting to urban courts to try to get his property back and eliminated the period of uncertainty of possession. It also led to the legal concept that 'future [psychological] abandonment [of possession] when unaware [of the loss] is [nevertheless retrospectively accounted] as abandonment'. Ultimately, Rava’s views were decisive in shaping the [[Babylonian Talmud|Bavli]]’s approach to the problem of theodicy, legal midrash, and conceptualization, all of which stand in stark contrast to the [[Jerusalem Talmud|Yerushalmi]]."&lt;ref&gt;Yaakov Elman, "The Babylonian Talmud in Its Historical Context," in Printing the Talmud: From Bomberg To Schottenstein, ed. Sharon Liberman Mintz &amp; Gabriel M. Goldstein (New York City: Yeshiva University Museum, 2006), 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Shadows''' are a [[fictional]] alien species in the [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] series ''[[Babylon 5]]''. Their homeworld is [[Z'ha'dum (planet)|Z'ha'dum]], although whether it is the world they originated from is uncertain, and they were the second race among the [[First Ones]] to be discovered and nurtured by [[Lorien_(Babylon_5)|Lorien]], the "First One".  In contrast to the [[Vorlon]]s, whose philosophy is represented by the question "Who are you?", that of the Shadows is represented by the question "What do you want?", centering towards desire rather than identity. [[J. Michael Straczynski]], the show's creator, once explained that he chose the name "Shadows" because of its [[Shadow (psychology)|meaning]] in [[Analytical psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/guide/013.html#JS|title=Guide Page: "Signs and Portents"|work=midwinter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiology==
[[Image:Babylon 5 - Shadows.jpg|thumb|Several Shadows surround [[Mr. Morden]]]]
A Shadow is an incorporeal being that when manifesting in a way that is visible to the viewer, appears in the form of an encounter suit resembling a spiked, violet-black exoskeleton. Their encounter suit is similar in shape to a [[praying mantis]] with an upper body, shoulder spines, a mobile head, and at least one pair of grasping forelimbs. The rear of the encounter suit is supported by multiple pairs of legs. Their legs resemble those of a [[spider]], though each Shadow has six of them instead of eight.

The Shadows have fourteen "eyes" showing their true form in total divided into four groups. Two sets of three arranged slanted upward and two sets of four arranged to align perfectly under the first sets.

The spoken language of the Shadows is a rapid series of high-frequency bursts and chirps like a cricket or grasshopper. According to one of their human emissaries, the [[endonym]] of the Shadows is ten thousand letters long, and unpronounceable by many; but this may simply be a lie to avoid revealing their actual name.

Detailed descriptions are rare, due to their encounter suits' ability to "[[cloaking device|cloak]]" themselves to visual wavelengths of light.  They are thus rarely seen except as shadowy, mirage-like silhouettes, which can be seen by telepaths, those using visual enhancement devices, or when the entity chooses to partially or wholly reveal itself.
Other manifestations take the form of the Shadows' three pairs of glowing orange eyes, usually as a symbolic image within a telepathic or dream vision.

Shadows very rarely engage in hand-to-hand combat to accomplish their goals, relying instead on invisibility, behind-the-scenes maneuvering and their technology. They are, however, vulnerable to high-powered energy weapons, as demonstrated when the two Shadow guards flanking [[Mr. Morden]] are run off by particle gun fire from [[Centauri (Babylon 5)|Centauri]] guards, and likely killed in the nuclear explosion on the shadows' base island on Centauri Prime.

==Z'ha'dum==
{{main|Z'ha'dum (planet)|l1=Z'ha'dum}}
::''Z'ha'dum is the homeworld of the Shadows. No one leaves the same as they arrived.'' --[[Delenn]]
::''If you go to Z'ha'dum, you will die.'' &amp;mdash; [[Kosh Naranek|Kosh]] to [[John Sheridan (Babylon 5)|John Sheridan]]

In the fictional ''[[Babylon 5]]'' universe, [[Z'ha'dum (planet)|Z'ha'dum]] was a world extremely important to the ancient, mysterious species known as the Shadows. Although a blasted, devastated world from which the Shadows were frequently driven over the eons, they kept coming back out of respect for [[Lorien (Babylon 5)|Lorien]]&amp;mdash;the first of the [[First Ones]]&amp;mdash;who for a long time resided on the planet.

Because of their periodic presence on Z'ha'dum, the planet is often assumed to be the Shadows' homeworld, but it is unknown whether the species actually originated there, or if its importance to them is centered strictly on [[Lorien (Babylon 5)|Lorien]]. Before undergoing her fundamental genetic change to become more human, [[Delenn]] confirms with [[Kosh Naranek|Kosh]] that the Shadows have returned to Z'ha'dum, implying that the species is based elsewhere when not actively preparing to launch one of their periodic wars. There appears to be more than one place of power for the Shadows and their minions. According to Markab Ambassador Fashar: ''"When the darkness was defeated long ago, they scattered, hid themselves away in secret places."''

According to [[Anna Sheridan]] in "[[Z'ha'dum]]", the Shadows believed they would die if anything Vorlon touched Z'ha'dum. It is not known whether this is true, a prediction of Sheridan's actions, merely an old superstition, or a way to separate and isolate Sheridan from his transportation. Many of them did die when Sheridan arrived with a piece of Kosh and detonated a pair of nuclear warheads that he had secretly smuggled onto the [[White Star (Babylon 5)|White Star]] (partially based on Vorlon technology) in a [[kamikaze]] attack.  Additionally, [[Lyta Alexander|Lyta]]'s telepathy, enhanced by the Vorlons (and, indeed, genetically seeded by the Vorlons in the first place) later triggered the destruction of Z'ha'dum itself. However, it is unclear if her telepathic probing of Z'ha'dum merely alarmed the remaining residents, who then set self-destruct devices and fled, or if the probing of Vorlon-enhanced telepathy somehow automatically triggered the planet's destruction.

==History==
===Before recorded history===
On the TV series, the Shadows are presumed to have evolved from arthropoid creatures. Little is known about what the Shadows' evolutionary history was like.

As was stated in the Technomage Book Trilogy, the Shadows and Vorlons are both creatures of light.  The Shadows prefer a more "down to earth" appearance, as opposed to the Vorlons who, due to generations of genetic tampering, are perceived as angels from the religious legends of races that see them.

Some records indicate that the Shadows first achieved [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|Hyperspace]] capability as far back as 100 [[Mya (unit)|mya]], maybe earlier. Around this time the Shadows also became a major galactic power, exploring the universe and making contact with alien races. The first of these races was that of the being Lorien, who was the first of the [[First Ones]].

The Shadows waged many wars with other ancient powers, including the Vorlons, Walkers and many more. The reasons for these wars are that this cycle of defeat and adaptation laid the basis for the Shadows' ideology of "facilitated [[survival of the fittest]]," which they would later enforce on the younger races.

===10,000 years ago===
Millions of years later, many younger races had begun to evolve on thousands of worlds and the First Ones realized that in order for these new sentients to succeed, the ancient races would have to move on. Thus many of the First Ones moved beyond the Galactic Rim, to explore the vast emptiness between galaxies and perhaps explore the numerous other galaxies throughout the universe. Several of the First Ones decided to stay behind and shepherd the younger races until they were fit to control their own destiny. The primary caretakers were the Vorlons and, surprisingly enough, the Shadows.

At first there was a balance between the two sides. One of the two then broke the agreement. Which is unknown. The Shadows claim the Vorlons broke the balance when they began tinkering with races on a genetic level, in an effort to make the younger races evolve more like them; which the Vorlons did, in fact, do. Though, as previously alluded to, it is not known whether this was the first act. Among these genetic dabblings, the Vorlons manipulated the younger races to see them as angelic creatures, using their telepathic abilities to shield their true form from the beings they manipulated.

The Shadows and the Vorlons began to fight among themselves, and those who tried to mediate, like the Walkers of Sigma 957, left the conflict embittered.

Over the course of the centuries that passed, the wars between the Shadows and Vorlons persisted. Then at some unknown point in time they decided to have their students fight for them, in an effort to prove who was right. This led to the last Shadow War before the time in which the Babylon 5 television series was set.

===Circa 1260===
Around the Earth year 1260, the penultimate [[Shadow War]] raged between the Shadows and the combined forces of the [[Vorlon]]s, [[Minbari]], and various other younger races allied with the Vorlons. The primitive and agrarian [[Narn]] homeworld was occupied by the Shadows, and the planet became a Shadow staging area.  The Shadows had no interest in the Narn themselves at that time.

Somehow, Narn telepaths learned that they could hurt the Shadows' ships, and may have begun [[guerrilla]] operations against the Shadows.  Through an unknown mechanism the Shadows slew all Narn telepaths of breeding age in order to prevent the Narn from resisting the Shadows, but the surviving telepaths, led by G'Quan, were still able to drive the Shadows from the planet.

Realising the war was lost, the Shadows seeded hundreds of worlds across the galaxy with their ships so their forces couldn't be wiped out in a single attack, as even the Vorlons could never find them all. They then retreated and hid themselves away, going into a state of hibernation.

===Year 2259===
In 2259, there were increasing reports of a black, spidery ship being encountered in [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]], which instilled a dark fear in all who looked upon it. Meanwhile, Narn ambassador [[G'Kar]] realized that these ships were those described in the [[Book of G'Quan|ancient writings]] of the Narn philosopher G'Quan, which told of a great enemy that rose to power a thousand years in the past. Known as the Shadows, they spread from their homeworld Z'ha'dum to rival the stars themselves:

::''"And the Spirit of Darkness moved upon the land. It screamed in the dreams of the [[Telepathy|Mindwalkers]]; and they fell, destroyed by it to their children and their children's children. Then did the Darkness come to Narn until it was driven out by G'Quan and the last of the surviving Mindwalkers."''

The text is accompanied by pictures of the black ship, and ends on a chilling note:

::''"There is a darkness greater than the one we fight. It is the darkness of the soul that has lost its way. Greater than the death of flesh is the death of hope, the death of dreams. Against this foe we can never surrender."''

===Year 2260===
In late 2260, Captain [[John Sheridan (Babylon 5)|John Sheridan]] was invited to Z'ha'dum for a meeting with the Shadows. The Shadows badly wanted to have Sheridan on their side because if he unravelled the Army of Light, it would stay unravelled, but, as past experience had showed them, if they killed him, someone else would simply take his place.

Sheridan did go to Z'ha'dum but the negotiations collapsed, and he jumped into a ravine two miles deep to evade capture once his suspicion that he had been led into a trap was confirmed.

Before doing so, he remotely piloted his ship, the ''White Star'', to crash into the Shadows' capital city, which he was visiting.  The ''White Star'' was carrying two [[nuclear bomb]]s in its cargo bay, each with a yield of over 500 [[TNT equivalent|megatons]]. (The strongest nuclear bomb to be detonated as of 2011 was the [[Tsar Bomb]], which had a yield of 50 megatons.)

Seconds after Sheridan jumped into the abyss, the ''White Star'' crashed into the city and the nuclear weapons it contained detonated. Both the ''White Star'' and the city were destroyed.  The crater left from the blast was the size of a large Earth country and was clearly visible from space.

===Year 2261===
The explosion on Z'ha'dum destroyed the Shadows' biggest city, throwing them into chaos and forcing them to regroup. They then went to seek outside help, and enlisted the Centauri to shelter a fleet of their ships on Centauri Prime.

At the Battle of Coriana 6, the second [[Shadow War]] ended, when the very races they and the Vorlons shepherded, led by [[John Sheridan (Babylon 5)|John Sheridan]] of Earth and [[Delenn]] of Minbari confronted both belligerents and announced that they would no longer be pawns of their philosophical struggle. When the grand coalition against them started sacrificing themselves against the Shadows' attempts to kill their leaders, they finally conceded that their conflict was now at an end. With that concession, the Shadows and the Vorlons passed beyond the Galactic Rim, accompanied by Lorien. Nonetheless, their servants, the [[Drakh]], and a few others stayed behind, and retained the advanced technology and aggressive philosophy of the Shadows.

Sheridan, along with [[Alfred Bester (Babylon 5)|Alfred Bester]] and [[Lyta Alexander]], went back to Z'ha'dum in early 2261 in search of some of this technology. This triggered a self-destruct security feature that caused the entire planet to explode, leaving nothing behind &amp;mdash; except for what the Drakh and other allies of the Shadows took with them in their quick exit from the exploding planet.

The [[Drakh]] aren't the only race who worked for the Shadows, but neither the surgeons and pilot in "[[Ship of Tears]]" nor the creature in "[[The Long Dark (Babylon 5 episode)|The Long Dark]]" were seen to be helping with the evacuation, though of course it has been speculated that the Drakh might have been the only Shadow servants to have been living on Z'ha'dum at that time.

With the destruction of Z'ha'dum, those beings that had faithfully served the Shadows down through the centuries found themselves homeless. Now these thralls sought to become masters of chaos themselves. Thus, the legacy of the Shadows lived on.

==Ships==
Shadow vessels are notable for their spires and dark coloration. The main-line warships resemble enormous [[tailless whip scorpion]]s; these can spew forth clouds of small fighter craft. Less commonly seen are reconnaissance/fleet-support ships the size of the White Star with all spires curled to face forward. When human allies incorporated these spires into their own capital ships, they became able to lock weapons onto Minbari vessels, suggesting the spires serve as sensors. Fighters spit balls of energy for weaponry, while larger vessels employ cutting beams. Every Shadow capital ship has a sentient being enslaved as its [[central processing unit]] (CPU). This gives it incredible control and maneuverability, but leaves the ship vulnerable to paralysis from [[telepathy|telepathic]] attack, which the Shadows attempt to counter by installing telepaths into their ships' cores. Unlike conventional ships, Shadow vessels do not form "Jump Points" to enter Hyperspace, although they have missiles that can fatally disrupt other ships' portals. Instead they slide or phase into Hyperspace.

The Shadow Death Cloud is their version of a Planet Killer. Instead of being a ship per se, it is seen as a massive black cloud in space. The "cloud" is actually countless nanites that surround a massive interconnected lattice-work. These lattices contain the command &amp; control functions, weapons, etc., of the Death Cloud, as well as missile launchers. When the Death Cloud attacks a planet, the missiles fire at the planet, then burrow down below the surface, causing significant tectonic upheaval upon detonation on the order of tens of thousands of megatons apiece, resulting in the death of all life on the planet. The nanites then descend on the planet, consuming all the resources necessary for maintaining, repairing, and recharging the Death Cloud's resources, rendering the surface of the planet little more than an inert, sterile husk. The nanites also have the effect of absorbing all efforts to scan inside the cloud, akin to a form of stealth technology, and also cooling down the local area of space to nearly absolute zero. Any technology caught inside begins shutting down due to the extreme cold.

Agents of Gaming RPG books make mention that the Shadows a long time ago actually piloted their own craft but gave up the practice perhaps due to their limited numbers. Instead they used members of the younger races as cannon fodder, and made it possible for their warships to be bred more quickly.

==Technology==
The Shadows developed many other weapons of war, including deadly bioengineered viruses and an artificial intelligence pod capable of operating a vessel in lieu of a normal crew. These weapons were scavenged by the [[Drakh]] following the Shadows' departure from the galaxy. It is unknown what other horrors the Shadows may have left behind. The Shadows may also have created a special type of [[jumpgate]] called a Null field, which appears as a black hole and establishes an instantaneous connection between two points. They were also the creators of a bio-plague that used [[nanite]]s to wipe out entire species.

The Shadows may also be the originator of technology that gives the [[Technomage]]s their powers (making them [[cyborg]]s). It seems likely that the Technomages were developed to serve as some of the Shadows' many soldiers of darkness, against telepaths in the [[Vorlon]] army of light, but the Technomages learned of this and rebelled, though attempts were made on many occasions to draw them back into the ranks of the Shadows.

[[Image:Shub-Niggurath.jpg|thumb|300px|Artistic portrayal of Shub-Niggurath, along with her "Thousand Young".]]

'''Shub-Niggurath''', often associated with the phrase “The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young”, is a [[deity]] in the [[Cthulhu Mythos]] of [[H. P. Lovecraft]].  The only other name by which [[H. P. Lovecraft]] referred to her was "Lord of the Wood" in his story ''[[The Whisperer in Darkness]]''.

Shub-Niggurath is first mentioned in Lovecraft's revision story "The Last Test" ([[1928 in literature|1928]]); she is not described by Lovecraft, but is frequently mentioned or called upon in incantations. Most of her development as a literary figure was carried out by other Mythos authors, including [[August Derleth]], [[Robert Bloch]], and [[Ramsey Campbell]].

August Derleth classified Shub-Niggurath as a [[Great Old One]], but the ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'' role-playing game classifies her as an [[Outer God]]. The ''[[CthulhuTech]]'' role-playing game, in turn, returns to Derleth's classification of Shub-Niggurath as a Great Old One.

==Development==
Shub-Niggurath's appearances in Lovecraft's main body of fiction do not provide much detail about his conception of the entity. Her first mention under Lovecraft's byline was in "[[The Dunwich Horror]]" (1928), where a quote from the ''[[Necronomicon]]'' discussing the Old Ones breaks into an exclamation of "Iä! Shub-Niggurath!"&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Lovecraft, "The Dunwich Horror", ''The Dunwich Horror and Others'', p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; The story provides no further information about this peculiar expression.

The next Lovecraft story to mention Shub-Niggurath is scarcely more informative. In ''[[The Whisperer in Darkness]]'' (1930), a recording of a ceremony involving human and nonhuman worshipers includes the following exchange:

{{quote|Ever Their praises, and abundance to the Black Goat of the Woods. Iä! Shub-Niggurath!&lt;br/&gt;
''Iä! Shub-Niggurath! The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young!''&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Lovecraft, "The Whisperer in Darkness", ''The Dunwich Horror and Others'', p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Similarly unexplained exclamations occur in "[[The Dreams in the Witch House]]" (1932) &lt;ref&gt;H. P. Lovecraft, "The Dreams in the Witch House", ''At the Mountains of Madness'', p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[The Thing on the Doorstep]]" (1933).&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Lovecraft, "The Thing on the Doorstep", ''The Dunwich Horror and Others'', pp. 287, 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Revision tales ===
Lovecraft only provided specific information about Shub-Niggurath in his "revision tales", stories published under the names of clients for whom he ghost-wrote. As Price points out, "For these clients he constructed a parallel myth-cycle to his own, a separate group of Great Old Ones", including [[Yig]], [[Ghatanothoa]], [[Rhan-Tegoth]], "the evil twins [[Nug and Yeb]]"—and Shub-Niggurath.

While some of these revision stories just repeat the familiar exclamations,&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Lovecraft writing as Zealia Bisop, "Medusa's Coil", ''The Horror in the Museum'', pp. 189–190; H. P. Lovecraft writing as Hazel Heald, "The Man of Stone", ''The Horror in the Museum'', pp. 225, 232; H. P. Lovecraft writing as Hazel Heald, "The Horror in the Museum", ''The Horror in the Museum'', pp. 225, 232; H. P. Lovecraft writing as William Lumley, "The Diary of Alonzo Typer", ''The Horror in the Museum'', p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; others provide new elements of lore. In "The Last Test" (1927), the first mention of Shub-Niggurath seems to connect her to Nug and Yeb: "I talked in [[Yemen]] with an old man who had come back from the [[Crimson Desert]]—he had seen [[Iram of the Pillars|Irem]], the City of Pillars, and had worshipped at the underground shrines of Nug and Yeb—Iä! Shub-Niggurath!"&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Lovecraft writing as Adolphe de Castro, "The Last Test", ''The Horror in the Museum'', p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The revision story ''[[The Mound (novella)|The Mound]]'', which describes the discovery of an underground realm called [[K'n-yan]] by a Spanish [[conquistador]], reports that a temple of [[Tsathoggua]] there "had been turned into a shrine of Shub-Niggurath, the All-Mother and wife of the Not-to-Be-Named-One. This deity was a kind of sophisticated [[Astarte]], and her worship struck the pious Catholic as supremely obnoxious."&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Lovecraft writing as Zealia Bishop, "The Mound", ''The Horror in the Museum'', pp. 144–145.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reference to "Astarte", the consort of Baal in [[Semitic mythology]], ties Shub-Niggurath to the related fertility goddess [[Cybele]], the Magna Mater mentioned in Lovecraft's "[[The Rats in the Walls]]", and implies that the "great mother worshipped by the hereditary cult of Exham Priory" in that story "had to be none other than Shub-Niggurath".&lt;ref&gt;Price, ''Shub-Niggurath Cycle'', p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Not-to-Be-Named-One, not being named, is difficult to identify; a similar phrase, translated into Latin as the Magnum Innominandum, appears in a list in ''The Whisperer in Darkness''&lt;ref&gt;Lovecraft, "The Whisperer in Darkness", p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; and was included in a scrap of incantation that Lovecraft wrote for [[Robert Bloch]]'s "The Shambler from the Stars".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bloch, "The Shambler from the Stars", ''Mysteries of the Worm'', p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; [[August Derleth]] identifies this mysterious entity with [[Hastur]] &lt;ref&gt;August Derleth, "The Return of Hastur", ''The Hastur Cycle'', pp. 255–256.&lt;/ref&gt; (though Hastur appears in the same ''Whisperer in Darkness'' list with the Magnum Innominandum), while Robert M. Price equates him with [[Yog-Sothoth]]—though he also suggests that Shub-Niggurath's mate is implicitly the snake god Yig.&lt;ref&gt;Price, p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, in "Out of the Aeons", a revision tale set in part on the lost continent of [[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]], Lovecraft describes the character T'yog as the "High Priest of Shub-Niggurath and guardian of the copper temple of the Goat with a Thousand Young". In the story, T'yog surprisingly maintains that "the gods friendly to man could be arrayed against the hostile gods, and&amp;nbsp;... that Shub-Niggurath, Nug, and Yeb, as well as Yig the Serpent-god, were ready to take sides with man" against the more malevolent Ghatanothoa. Shub-Niggurath is called "the Mother Goddess", and reference is made to "her sons", presumably Nug and Yeb.&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Lovecraft writing as Hazel Heald, "Out of the Aeons", ''The Horror in the Museum'', pp. 273–274; Price, p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other references ===
Other evidence of Lovecraft's conception of Shub-Niggurath can be found in his letters. For example, in a letter to Willis Conover, Lovecraft described her as an "evil cloud-like entity".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Price, p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; "Yog-Sothoth's wife is the hellish cloud-like entity Shub-Niggurath, in whose honor nameless cults hold the rite of the Goat with a Thousand Young. By her he has two monstrous offspring—the evil twins Nug and Yeb. He has also begotten hellish hybrids upon the females of various organic species throughout the universes of space-time."

==The Black Goat==
Although Shub-Niggurath is often associated with the epithet "The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young", it is possible that this Black Goat is a separate entity. Rodolfo Ferraresi, in his essay "The Question of Shub-Niggurath", says that Lovecraft himself separated the two in his writings, such as in "Out of the Aeons" ([[1935 in literature|1935]]) in which a distinction is made between Shub-Niggurath and the Black Goat—the goat is the figurehead through which Shub-Niggurath is worshipped. In apparent contrast to Shub-Niggurath, the Black Goat is sometimes depicted as a male, most notably in the rite performed in ''[[The Whisperer in Darkness]]'' (1931) in which the Black Goat is called the "Lord of the Woods".  However, Lovecraft clearly associates Shub-Niggurath with The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young in two of his stories—"The Dreams in the Witch House" and "The Thing on the Doorstep".

The Black Goat may be the personification of [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], since Lovecraft was influenced by [[Arthur Machen]]'s ''[[The Great God Pan]]'' ([[1890 in literature|1890]]), a story that inspired Lovecraft's "[[The Dunwich Horror]]" ([[1929 in literature|1929]]). In this incarnation, the Black Goat may represent [[Satan]] in the form of the [[satyr]], a half-man, half-goat. In folklore, the satyr symbolized a man with excessive sexual appetites. The Black Goat may otherwise be a male, earthly form of Shub-Niggurath—an incarnation she assumes to copulate with her worshipers.&lt;ref&gt;Ferraresi, "The Question of Shub-Niggurath", ''Crypt of Cthulhu #35'', pp. 17&amp;ndash;8, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--NOTE: FOOTNOTE COVERS ENTIRE SECTION--&gt;

==Robert M. Price's interpretation==
[[Robert M. Price]] points to a passage from "Idle Days on the Yann", by [[Lord Dunsany]], one of Lovecraft's favorite writers, as the source for the name Shub-Niggurath:

{{quote|And I too felt that I would pray. Yet I liked not to pray to a jealous God there where the frail affectionate gods whom the heathen love were being humbly invoked; so I bethought me, instead, of Sheol Nugganoth, whom the men of the jungle have long since deserted, who is now unworshipped and alone; and to him I prayed.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Dunsany, [http://www.litrix.com/dtales/dtale006.htm "Idle Days on the Yann"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829163820/http://www.litrix.com/dtales/dtale006.htm |date=August 29, 2006 }}, ''A Dreamer's Tales''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Notes Price: "The name already carried a whiff of sulfur: [[Sheol]] was the name for the Netherworld mentioned in the [[Bible]] and the [[Gilgamesh Epic]]."&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Price, ''Shub-Niggurath Cycle'', p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

As for Shub-Niggurath's association with the symbol of the goat, Price writes,

{{quote|we may believe that here Lovecraft was inspired by the traditional [[Christianity|Christian]] depiction of the [[Baphomet|Baphomet Goat]], an image of [[Satan]] harking back to the pre-Christian woodland deity [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], he of the goatish horns and shanks. The Satanic goat is a device of much spectral fiction, as when  in [[Dennis Wheatley]]'s ''[[The Devil Rides Out]]'' the Archfiend's epiphany takes goat-headed form.&lt;ref&gt;Price, p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Other writers==

===Ramsey Campbell===
In Ramsey Campbell's story "The Moon Lens", the English town of [[Goatswood]] is inhabited by once-human worshippers of Shub-Niggurath. When the deity deems a worshiper to be most worthy, a special ceremony is held in which the "Black Goat of the Woods" swallows the initiate, and then regurgitates the cultist as a transformed [[satyr]]-like being. A changed worshiper is also endowed with immortal life.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, "The Moon-Lens", ''Shub-Niggurath Cycle''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stephen King===
In the short story "[[Crouch End (short story)|Crouch End]]", a woman loses her husband to, and then is chased by minions of "the Goat with a Thousand Young" and then by the Goat itself.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen King, "Crouch End", ''New Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos''&lt;/ref&gt; In the novel ''[[Revival (novel)|Revival]]'' a maddening entity known as "Great Mother" is introduced and shares many similarities with Shub-Niggurath, though the latter is never mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen King, "Revival" (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paul Stewart===
In his ''[[The Edge Chronicles|Edge Chronicles]]'' novel ''[[The Curse of the Gloamglozer]],'' one of the antagonists, the Rogue Glister, is obviously modelled after Shub-Niggurath, with long, stretching tentacles and its main body being a pulsating mass of muscle just like the Black Goat.

===Paul Morris===
''The Scarifyers: The Devil of Denge Marsh'', by Paul Morris, is a light-hearted radio play (on CD as a Cosmic Hobo publication, 2007) in [[The Scarifyers]] series whose heroes (played by [[Nicholas Courtney]] and [[Terry Molloy]]) are engaged in foiling the return of this watery timeless horror and thwarting the intentions of its mysterious (and sometimes bizarre) human acolytes.

===Gary Myers===

[[Gary Myers (writer)|Gary Myers]]'s story, "What Rough Beast", casts Shub-Niggurath as the mother of all the gods, and her children as the chapters of her ongoing revelation.

===Jim Butcher===

In ''Turn Coat'', the eleventh book in ''[[The Dresden Files]]'' by [[Jim Butcher]], the [[Harry Dresden|narrator]] mentions that there are in his universe "terrors that the Black-Goat-with-a-Thousand-Young wouldn't dare use for its kids' bedtime stories".

===Edward M. Erdelac===

In ''The Outlaw Gods'', a novella from ''The Mensch With No Name'', second book in the ''Merkabah Rider'' [[weird western]] series, Shub-Niggurath dwells beneath the ruins of Red House, a [[K'n-yan]] citadel in the mountains of Arizona, surrounded by dark trees which tear apart trespassers.

===Joseph Nanni===

The Dark Young or Thousand Young appear in the short film ''Black Goat'' by writer/director Joseph Nanni.  The Dark Young first appear as root/tentacles assessing their prey.  Later in the film a young trapper surrounds one of the Young with fire only to find himself surrounded when the creature calls its siblings.

However, the concept of the Dark Young was first introduced by game designer [[Sandy Petersen]] for the ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'' role-playing game.

===Joe Hill===
Shub-Niggurath (under the variant "Shub-Niggarauth") is mentioned in the Joe Hill graphic novel series ''[[Locke &amp; Key]]''. Another dimension is barred from our own by a black door in a deep cave, and any who step through become possessed by a "Child of [[Leng (plateau)|Leng]]" (implying that this other world behind the Black Door is, indeed, Lovecraft's Leng) - writhing creatures made of dark liquid-like material and golden eyes. In ''Clockworks'', volume five of the series, three possessed characters (two humans and a goat) all exclaim "Iä! Iä Shub-Niggarauth!", implying that the Children of Leng are either the creature's "Thousand Young" or the creature itself. It is noteworthy to mention that the series itself is set on the fictional island of Lovecraft, Massachusetts.

===Christopher Brookmyre===
In his book ''[[A Big Boy Did It and Ran Away]]'', Brookmyre includes various [[first-person shooter]] references (as the plot involves an ex-videogame-salesman fighting terrorists single-handed). Among these references, the terrorists' financier is named Shaloub "Shub" N'gurath, a reference to Shub-Niggurath as it appears as a boss in the [[first-person shooter]] ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]''.

===Anders Fager===
In "The Furies From Borås" [[Anders Fager]] includes references to Shub-Niggurath. The "Young of the Goat" is a cult of teenage girls. They lure teenage boys into the woods and sacrifice them to a monstrous messenger.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adlibris.com/se/bok/samlade-svenska-kulter-skrackberattelser-9789146220961&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://bokhora.se/2010/mandagsmote-anders-fager/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martinsson, "At One With Nature", ''An Ecocritical Study of the Nature Motif in Three Swedish Horror Writers'' https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/34207/1/gupea_2077_34207_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The story has given rise to the "Borås Black Goats", a fictional sports club from the Furies' home town.

===Charles Stross===
Shub-Niggurath is the primary [[antagonist]] in the 2013 novelette "Equoid" by [[Charles Stross]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Stross, [http://www.tor.com/stories/2013/09/equoid "Equoid"], ''The Laundry Files''&lt;/ref&gt;

Shub-Niggurath is mentioned in "Professor Gargoyle: Tales from Lovecraft Middle School #1".

===Iida Pochi===
Shub-Niggurath, calling herself "The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young", is one of the main protagonists of the [[slice-of-life]] manga {{nihongo|'''''The Demon Who Became My Sister - The Sister of the Woods with a Thousand Young'''''|姉なるもの|Ane Naru Mono|lead=yes}}.

===Maruyama Kugane===
Episode 12 of {{nihongo|'''''Overlord III'''''|オーバーロードⅢ|Ōbārōdo Ⅲ|lead=yes}}, the 3rd season of the popular Japanese anime series '''''Overlord''''', gives a nod to the Cthulhu mythos, portraying the anti-hero and principal lead character of the series, Ains Ooal Gown, using "super-tier" magic to summon half a dozen of Shub-Niggurath's 1,000 young in order to destroy an army of 240,000 men.

In [[geometry]], the '''order-3 snub octagonal tiling''' is a semiregular tiling of the hyperbolic plane. There are four [[triangle]]s, one [[octagon]] on each [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]]. It has [[Schläfli symbol]] of ''sr{8,3}''.

== Images ==
Drawn in chiral pairs, with edges missing between black triangles:
:[[File:H2 snub 238a.png|240px]][[File:H2 snub 238b.png|240px]]

== Related polyhedra and tilings ==
This semiregular tiling is a member of a sequence of [[Snub (geometry)|snubbed]] polyhedra and tilings with vertex figure (3.3.3.3.''n'') and [[Coxeter–Dynkin diagram]] {{CDD|node_h|n|node_h|3|node_h}}. These figures and their duals have (n32) rotational [[Orbifold notation|symmetry]], being in the Euclidean plane for n=6, and hyperbolic plane for any higher n. The series can be considered to begin with n=2, with one set of faces degenerated into [[digon]]s.
{{Snub table}}

From a [[Wythoff construction]] there are ten hyperbolic [[Uniform tilings in hyperbolic plane|uniform tilings]] that can be based from the regular octagonal tiling. 

Drawing the tiles colored as red on the original faces, yellow at the original vertices, and blue along the original edges, there are 10 forms.

'''''United States v. Enmons''''', {{Ussc|410|396|1973|el=no}}, was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court held that the federal Anti-Racketeering Act of 1934, known as the [[Hobbs Act]],  does not cover [[union violence]] in furtherance of the union's objectives.

The case involved a labor strike in which members of the [[International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers]] (IBEW) fired rifles at three utility company transformers, drained the oil from another, and blew up a company substation. The labor union in question was seeking a higher-pay contract and other benefits from their employer, the [[Gulf States Utilities|Gulf States Utilities Company]] which is now part of [[Entergy]]. The federal government tried the defendants under the Hobbs Act.  

The Court ruled that "The Hobbs Act, which makes it a federal crime to obstruct interstate commerce by robbery or extortion, does not reach the use of violence (which is readily punishable under state law) to achieve legitimate union objectives, such as higher wages in return for genuine services that the employer seeks."&lt;ref name="United States v. Enmons"&gt;{{cite web|title=UNITED STATES, Appellant, v. Travis Paul ENMONS et al.|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/410/396|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell University Law School|accessdate=May 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details of the case==
{{unsourced|section|date=August 2018}}
The indictment against the alleged conspirators charged them with being in violation of the [[Hobbs Act]], which states that anyone attempting to affect or obstruct commerce through violence or the threat of violence against any person or property "''shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both''." The indictment argued that the union members obstructed commerce with their actions against the Utilities Company, and attempted to "''obtain the property of [their employer] in the form of wages and other things of value''" by using the wrongful use of force and the fear of economic loss.

The court acknowledged that using threats and force to obtain property is wrongful. However, the court reasoned that it is considered "wrongful" only when the perpetrator has no "legitimate claim" to it. Since federal law empowers unions with the right to [[Strike action|strike]], the use of violence to secure higher pay and benefits was not [[extortion]]. The case was dismissed. Such violent acts can, however, be punishable under normal state or federal laws. 

In understanding Enmons, it is important to keep in mind that what the Hobbs Act outlaws is extortion, not just any bad act. Federal law, in particular the [[National Labor Relations Act]], says that collective bargaining and strikes in support of collective bargaining goals are legal and protected. Therefore, since collective bargaining has a purpose that is not extortion, one of the key elements of a Hobbs Act violation is not met.

==Controversy==
While labor unions as a whole are exempt from prosecution, individual members can still be held accountable and prosecuted according to local laws. However, evidence suggests that this rarely is the case. According to a 1998 policy analysis by the [[Cato Institute]],&lt;ref name="Kendrick"&gt;[https://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=1175 Freedom from Union Violence, Cato Institute Policy Analysis no. 316, September 9, 1998 by David Kendrick]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The result has been an epidemic of union-related violence. The National Institute for Labor Relations Research (NILRR) has recorded 8,799 incidents of violence from news reports since [the Enmons ruling]. Those reports show only 258 convictions, suggesting a conviction rate of less than 3 percent. Moreover, local law enforcement authorities often get many more reports of strike violence than journalists can possibly cover.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some critics argue that the Enmons decision has been a major factor in increasing corruption among union and government officials alike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrtw.org/en/d/big_labor_special_privileges.htm] - National Right to Work Committee: "Top Ten Special Privelages of Organized Labor"&lt;/ref&gt; Economist and former professor Morgan Reynolds wrote:&lt;ref name="Kendrick"/&gt;{{rp|30}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is difficult to tell racketeer-controlled unions from other unions, because both types depend on violence and the threat of violence…The plain truth is that our labor laws have arranged incentives so that honest, noncoercive union officials find it difficult to survive in competition with the muscleman types.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, others argue the FUVA has greatly exaggerated the existence of union violence.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} In a law review article, Julius G. Getman and F. Ray Marshall, The Continuing Assault on the Right to Strike, 79 Tex. L. Rev. 703, 712-13 (2001), law professor Julius Getman and former Secretary of Labor Ray Marshall, analyzed the evidence of union violence.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The claim that strike violence is "escalating" has no empirical basis. Even the study conducted by the National Institute for Labor Relations Research - cited regularly as authority for this proposition by FUVA's proponents - draws no such conclusion. And the study itself is a scholarly monstrosity that seeks to study union violence by compiling media reports, mainly newspaper articles concerning strike violence. The Institute admits that it did not actually investigate any of the incidents reported and does not know if the reports are accurate. It concludes: "Because it relies on news accounts the Institute cannot guarantee the accuracy of the file itself." In fact, articles about employer-instigated violence are included in the study's effort to determine union violence. n59 It seems obvious that the methodology employed confuses those strikes most written about with those most violent. Further, the Institute includes incidents of "psychological violence; i.e., intimidation, coercion and verbal threats" - terms which it does not bother to define. It seems clear, however, that this definition would include nonviolent civil disobedience of the type used by the civil rights movement and increasingly by the labor movement. But whatever the definition, it is almost certain that strike-related violence has decreased since the Enmons decision because the number of strikes has declined significantly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since 1973, a number of bills have been proposed to overturn US v. Enmons.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The [[Freedom from Union Violence Act]] (FUVA) was first introduced as H.R. 1796 on June 8, 1995,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h104-1796 H.R. 1796: Freedom from Union Violence Act], govtrack.us; accessed July 31, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been reintroduced in every Congress since.&lt;ref name=OtherLegislation&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s105-230&amp;tab=related Other Legislation with the Same Title]&lt;/ref&gt; None of these bills have made it out of committee.&lt;ref name=OtherLegislation/&gt;

'''Vasa praevia''', also spelled '''vasa previa''', is a condition in which fetal blood vessels cross or run near the [[internal orifice of the uterus|internal opening of the uterus]]. These vessels are at risk of rupture when the supporting membranes rupture, as they are unsupported by the [[umbilical cord]] or [[placenta|placental tissue]].

&lt;!-- Risk factors --&gt;
Risk factors include [[in vitro fertilization]].&lt;ref name=Ru2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ruiter|first1=L|last2=Kok|first2=N|last3=Limpens|first3=J|last4=Derks|first4=JB|last5=de Graaf|first5=IM|last6=Mol|first6=B|last7=Pajkrt|first7=E|title=Incidence of and risk indicators for vasa praevia: a systematic review.|journal=BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology|date=July 2016|volume=123|issue=8|pages=1278–87|pmid=26694639|doi=10.1111/1471-0528.13829}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and culture --&gt;
Vasa praevia occurs in about 0.6 per 1000 pregnancies.&lt;ref name=Ru2016/&gt; The term "vasa previa" is derived from the Latin; "vasa" means vessels and "previa" comes from "pre" meaning "before" and "via" meaning "way". In other words, vessels lie before the fetus in the birth canal and in the way.

==Cause==
Vasa previa is present when unprotected fetal vessels traverse the fetal membranes over the internal cervical os. These vessels may be from either a [[Velamentous cord insertion|velamentous insertion of the umbilical cord]] or may be joining an accessory (succenturiate) placental lobe to the main disk of the placenta. If these fetal vessels rupture the bleeding is from the fetoplacental circulation, and fetal [[exsanguination]] will rapidly occur, leading to fetal death. It is thought that vasa previa arises from an early placenta previa. As the pregnancy progresses, the placenta tissue surrounding the vessels over the cervix undergoes atrophy, and the placenta grows preferentially toward the upper portion of the uterus. This leaves unprotected vessels running over the cervix and in the lower uterine segment. This has been demonstrated using serial ultrasound. Oyelese et al. found that 2/3 of patient with vasa previa at delivery had a low-lying placenta or placenta previa that resolved prior to the time of delivery. 
There are three types of vasa previa. Types 1 and 2 were described by Catanzarite et al. In Type 1, there is a velamentous insertion with vessels running over the cervix. In Type 2, unprotected vessels run between lobes of a bilobed or succenturiate lobed placenta. In Type 3, a portion of the placenta overlying the cervix undergoes atrophy. In this type, there is a normal placental cord insertion and the placenta has only one lobe. However, vessels at a margin of the placenta are exposed.

===Risk factors===
Vasa previa is seen more commonly with velamentous insertion of the umbilical cord, accessory placental lobes (succenturiate or bilobate placenta), multiple gestation, IVF pregnancy. In IVF pregnancies incidences as high as one in 300 have been reported{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. The reasons for this association are not clear, but disturbed orientation of the blastocyst at implantation, vanishing embryos and the increased frequency of placental morphological variations in in vitro fertilisation pregnancies have all been postulated{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

==Diagnosis==
* The classic triad of the vasa praevia is: membrane rupture, painless vaginal bleeding and fetal bradycardia or fetal death.
* Prior to the advent of ultrasound, this diagnosis was most often made after a stillbirth or neonatal death in which the mother had ruptured her membranes, had some bleeding, and delivered an exsanguinated baby. In these cases, examination of the placenta and membranes after delivery would show evidence of a velamentous cord insertion with rupture of the vessels. However, with almost universal use of ultrasound in the developed world, many cases are now detected during pregnancy, giving the opportunity to deliver the baby before this catastrophic rupture of the membranes occurs.  Vasa previa is diagnosed with ultrasound when echolucent linear or tubular structures are found overlying the cervix or in close proximity to it. Transvaginal ultrasound is the preferred modality. Color, power and pulsed wave Doppler should be used to confirm that the structures are fetal vessels. The vessels will demonstrate a fetal arterial or venous waveform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lijoi A, Brady J | title = Vasa previa diagnosis and management. | journal = J Am Board Fam Pract | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 543–8 | year = 2003| pmid = 14963081 | doi = 10.3122/jabfm.16.6.543}}''[http://www.jabfm.org/cgi/content/full/16/6/543 Full text]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee W, Lee V, Kirk J, Sloan C, Smith R, Comstock C | title = Vasa previa: prenatal diagnosis, natural evolution, and clinical outcome. | journal = Obstet Gynecol | volume = 95 | issue = 4 | pages = 572–6 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10725492 | doi = 10.1016/S0029-7844(99)00600-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Alkali denaturation test detects the presence of fetal hemoglobin in vaginal blood, as fetal hemoglobin is resistant to denaturation in presence of 1% NaOH. Tests such as the Ogita Test, Apt test or Londersloot test were previously used to attempt to detect fetal blood in the vaginal blood, to help make the diagnosis. These tests are no longer widely used in the US, but are sometimes used in other parts of the world.
* Also detection of fetal hemoglobin in vaginal bleeding is diagnostic.

==Treatment==
It is recommended that women with vasa previa should deliver through elective cesarean prior to rupture of the membranes. Given the timing of membrane rupture is difficult to predict, elective cesarean delivery at 35–36 weeks is recommended. This gestational age gives a reasonable balance between the risk of death and that of prematurity. Several authorities have recommended hospital admission about 32 weeks. This is to give the patient proximity to the operating room for emergency delivery should the membranes rupture. Because these patients are at risk for preterm delivery, it is recommended that steroids should be given to promote fetal lung maturation. When bleeding occurs, the patient goes into labor, or if the membranes rupture, immediate treatment with an emergency [[caesarean section|caesarean delivery]] is usually indicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bhide A, Thilaganathan B | title = Recent advances in the management of placenta previa. | journal = Curr Opin Obstet Gynecol | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 447–51 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15534438 | doi = 10.1097/00001703-200412000-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oyelese Y, Smulian J | title = Placenta previa, placenta accreta, and vasa previa. | journal = Obstet Gynecol | volume = 107 | issue = 4 | pages = 927–41 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16582134 | doi = 10.1097/01.AOG.0000207559.15715.98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Virtual crime''' or '''in-game crime''' refers to a virtual [[crime|criminal act]] that takes place in a [[massively multiplayer online game]] (MMOG), usually an [[MMORPG]]. The huge time and effort invested into such games can lead online "crime" to spill over into real world crime, and even blur the distinctions between the two. Some countries have introduced special police investigation units to cover such "virtual crimes". South Korea is one such country and looked into 22,000 cases in the first six months of 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Mark. "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3138456.stm Does virtual crime need real justice?]" at BBC News, (September 29, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==
Several interpretations of the term "virtual crime" exist. Some legal scholars opt for a definition based on a report written by freelance journalist [[Julian Dibbell]] on what was the first prominent case, "[[a rape in cyberspace]]."&lt;ref&gt;Julian Dibbell, A Rape in Cyberspace, Village Voice, Vol. XXXVIII, No. 51 (December 21, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; One such scholar defined virtual crime as needing to have all the qualities of a real crime, and so was not a new subset of crime at all.&lt;ref&gt;Susan W. Brenner, Is There Such a Thing as "Virtual Crime?”, 4 Cal. Crim. Law Rev. 1,105-11 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, it has also been said that the connection between virtual crimes and real crimes are "tenuous at best: It is the link between a brutal rape and a fictional story of a brutal rape. Surely the difference is more striking than any similarity."&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, Problem of Perspective at 372-73 n.66&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to prove that there are real-life implications of virtual crime, so it is not widely accepted as prosecutable.

To rectify this, the modern interpretation of the term "virtual" must be amended such that it carries the traditional implication; "that is such in essence or effect, though not recognised as such in name or according to strict definition."&lt;ref&gt;OED&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, it "would include those crimes that somehow evoke and approach the effect and essence of real crime, but are not considered crimes."&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Brenner, Virtual Crime, 4 Cal. Crim. Law Rev. 1 at ¶125-27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Virtual economies==
{{main|Virtual economy}}
Over time, players build their characters and collect in-game items. Some such items may have been obtained through months of gameplay, involving various tasks and a substantial level of effort. According to [[economic subjectivism|standard conceptions of economic value]], the goods and services of virtual economies do have a demonstrable value. Since players of these games are willing to substitute real economic resources of time and money (monthly fees) in exchange for these resources, by definition they have demonstrated [[utility]] to the user. 

Stemming from their value in the virtual economy, these items, and the characters themselves, have gained monetary value in the real world. [[eBay]], along with specialist trading sites, have allowed players to sell their wares. This has attracted [[fraud]]ulent sales as well as [[theft]].  Many game developers, such as [[Blizzard Entertainment]] (responsible for ''[[World of Warcraft]]'') oppose and even prohibit the practice. Some argue that to allow in-game items to have monetary values makes these games, essentially, [[gambling]] venues.

In the online world of Brittania, the currency of one Annum equates to about $3.4 US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lastowka|first=Greg|last2=Hunter|first2=Dan|date=2004-07-19|title=Virtual Crime|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=564801.|language=en|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; If someone were to steal another player's virtual currency, they could convert it to US dollars via PayPal. This stems controversy over whether or not this should be dealt with like real crime, as there are real-life implications.

In most games, players do not own, materially or intellectually, any part of the game world, and merely pay to use it. Because this "virtual property" is actually owned by the game developer, a developer who opposed real commerce of in-game currencies would have the right to destroy virtual goods as soon as they were listed on [[eBay]] or otherwise offered for real trade.

==Known cases==

In South Korea, where the number of [[computer game]] players is massive, some have reported the emergence of gangs and mafia, where powerful players steal and demand that beginners give them virtual money for their "protection".  

In China, Qiu Chengwei was sentenced to life in prison after stabbing and killing fellow ''[[The Legend of Mir 3]]'' gamer Zhu Caoyuan.  In the game Qiu had lent Zhu a powerful sword (a "dragon sabre"), which Zhu then went on to sell on eBay for 7,200 Yuan (about £473 or US$870). With no Chinese laws covering the online dispute, there was nothing the police could do.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4397159.stm 'Game theft' led to fatal attack]" at [[BBC News]].  Retrieved 9 June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3138456.stm | work=BBC News | first=Mark | last=Ward | title=Does virtual crime need real justice? | date=29 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the game ''[[The Sims Online]]'' a 17-year-old boy going by the in-game name "Evangeline", was discovered to have built a cyber-[[brothel]], where customers would pay sim-money for minutes of [[cybersex]]. This led to the cancellation of his accounts but no legal action, mainly because he was above the [[age of consent]].&lt;ref&gt;Bray, Hiawatha. "[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/01/14/justice_has_its_price_in_sim_world/ Justice has its price in Sim world]".  Retrieved 9 June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schaeffer, Jim. "[http://www.freep.com/news/mich/sims27_20040127.htm Sex And The Simulated City: Virtual world raises issues in the real one ]".  Retrieved 10 June 2005.].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.alphavilleherald.com/archives/000049.html Evangeline: Interview with a Child cyber-Prostitute in TSO]".  Retrieved 11 June 2005. [[Wikipedia:Linkrot|Dead link]] as of 27 May 2010. Archived [https://web.archive.org/web/20050603084519/http://www.alphavilleherald.com/archives/000049.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''"virtual mugging"''' was coined when some players of ''[[Lineage II]]'' used [[Video game bot|bots]] to defeat other player's characters and take their items. In Japan, the [[Kagawa Prefecture|Kagawa prefectural]] police arrested a Chinese foreign exchange student on 16 August 2005 following the reports of virtual mugging and the online sale of the stolen items.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7865]&lt;/ref&gt;

The virtual economies of many MMOs and the exchange of virtual items and currency for real money has triggered the birth of the [[game sweatshop]], in which workers in the [[developing world]], typically China (although there has been reports of this type of activity in [[Eastern Europe]]an countries), earn real-world wages for long days spent monotonously performing in-game tasks. Most instances typically involve [[gold farming|farming of resources or currency]], which has given rise to the epithet ''Chinese Adena Farmer'', because of its first reported widespread use in ''[[Lineage II]]''. More egregious cases involve using exploits such as in [[duping (gaming)|duping]] money or items, such as a large-scale incident in ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]''.&lt;ref name="Koster Stats"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.simbaspaws.org/Aziri/SWG/economy.htm | title=Economy Stats | last=Koster | first=Raph | authorlink=Raph Koster | date=2004-04-30 | accessdate=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both practices can place great stress on the creators' artificial economy, requiring robust design, and often repeated updates, to preserve reasonable work/reward ratios and game balance. There have also been reports of collusion (or vertical integration, depending on the source) among farmers and online currency exchanges. In 2002, a company called Blacksnow Interactive, a game currency exchange, admitted to using workers in a "virtual sweatshop" in [[Tijuana]], Mexico to farm money and items from ''[[Ultima Online]]'' and ''[[Dark Age of Camelot]]''. When [[Mythic Entertainment]] cracked down on the practice, Blacksnow attempted to sue the game company.

It was reported on 14 November 2007 that a Dutch teenager had been arrested for allegedly stealing virtual furniture from "rooms" in 3D social-networking website [[Habbo Hotel]]. The teenagers involved were accused of creating fake Habbo websites in order to lure users into entering their account details, which would then be used to steal virtual furniture bought with real money totalling €4000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7094764.stm | work=BBC News | title='Virtual theft' leads to arrest | date=14 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Whale meat''', broadly speaking, may include all [[cetacean]]s (whales, dolphins, porpoises) and all parts of the animal: muscle (meat), organs ([[offal]]), and fat ([[blubber]]). There is relatively little demand for it, compared to farmed livestock, and commercial [[whaling]], which has [[whaling controversy|faced opposition]] for decades, continues today in very few countries (mainly Iceland, Japan, Norway), although whale meat used to be eaten across Western Europe and [[colonial America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Middleton|first1=Richard|last2=Lombard|first2=Anne|title=Colonial America: A History to 1763|publisher=Blackwell|year=2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=20opNp7NGaAC&amp;pg=PA243|isbn=978-144-439627-0|page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, wherever [[dolphin drive hunting]] and [[aboriginal whaling]] exist, [[marine mammals as food|marine mammals are eaten]] locally as part of the [[subsistence economy]]: in the Faroe Islands; in the circumpolar Arctic (the [[Inuit]] in Canada and Greenland, related peoples in Alaska, the [[Chukchi people]] of Siberia); other indigenous peoples of the United States (including the [[Makah people]] of the Pacific Northwest); in [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]] (mainly on the island of [[Bequia]]); in a couple of villages in Indonesia; in certain South Pacific islands.

Like [[horse meat]], for some cultures whale meat is taboo, or a food of last resort, e.g. in times of war, whereas in others it is a delicacy and a culinary centrepiece. Indigenous groups contend that whale meat represents their cultural survival. Its consumption has been denounced by detractors on [[wildlife conservation]], [[toxicity]], and [[animal rights]] grounds. Whale meat can be prepared in various ways, including salt-curing, which means that consumption is not necessarily restricted to coastal communities.

[[File:Indian Whalers Stripping Their Prey at Neah Bay - 1910.jpg|thumb|right|Native American whalers removing strips of flesh from a whale carcase at [[Neah Bay, Washington]], 1910]]

Whales were hunted in European waters throughout the Middle Ages for their meat and [[whale oil|oil]].&lt;ref name=larousse&gt;{{Harvnb|Lang|1988}} Larousse Gastronomique, p.1151, under "whale"&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Catholicism]], aquatic creatures were generally considered "fish"; therefore whale was deemed suitable for eating during [[Lent]]&lt;ref name=larousse/&gt; and other "lean periods".&lt;ref name=burns&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Burns|first=William E.|title=Science And Technology in Colonial America|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Af5kC1XYUy4C&amp;pg=PA49|isbn=978-0-631-22141-8}},&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative explanation is that the Church considered "hot meat" to raise the libido, making it unfit for holy days. Parts submerged in water, such as whale or [[beaver]] tails, were considered "cold meat."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurlansky|1999}}, p.62&lt;/ref&gt;

Eating whale meat did not end with the Middle Ages in Europe, but rather, whale stock in nearby oceans collapsed due to [[overfishing|overexploitation]], especially the [[right whales]] around the [[Bay of Biscay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baffin|1881}}, ''The voyages of William Baffin, 1612-1622'', p.xxvi&lt;/ref&gt; Thus European whalers (the Basques, especially, [[History of Basque whaling|were known for their expertise]]) had to seek out the [[New World]] to catch whales.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{Harvnb|Baffin|1881}}. [[William Baffin]]'s expedition is recorded as having Basque crew catching whales, though mostly the harvesting of fat and whalebone (baleen) from whales and the fat and teeth (ivory) from ''sea morse'', i.e., [[walrus]] is described, and not much to say about eating&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch ([[Flemish]]) were also [[Whaling in the Netherlands|active in the whaling commerce]] during the Middle Ages,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|De Smet|1981}}, pp.301-9&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of records regarding the trafficking of whalemeat and taxation on it occur from historical [[Flanders]] (extending to cities like Arras or Calais in the ''département'' of [[Pas de Calais]]).

French surgeon [[Ambroise Paré]] (died 1590) wrote that "the flesh has no value, but the tongue is soft and delicious and therefore salted; likewise, the blubber, which is distributed across many provinces, and eaten with peas during Lent".&lt;ref name=larousse/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Paré|first=Ambroise|title=Oeuvres complètes|volume=3|place=Paris|publisher=Chez J.-B.

==Species hunted==
Minke whale is one of the most common species still hunted in substantial numbers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Baleen whales other than the minke are endangered, though they are taken in numbers by indigenous peoples who traditionally hunt them, and more lately, the whaling nations have resumed hunting larger baleen whales openly.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 1998-1999, Harvard researchers published their DNA identifications of samples of whalemeat they obtained in the Japanese market, and found that mingled among the presumably legal (i.e. minke whale meat) was a sizeable proportion of [[dolphin]] and [[porpoise]] meats, and instances of [[endangered species]] such as [[fin whale]] and [[humpback whale]]. ([[Blue whale]] DNA was also detected in the study, but researchers have attributed those findings to crossbreeding with fin whales, and that view has since been strengthened.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ref=harv|last1=Palumbi|first1=S.R.|authorlink1=Stephen R.

In recent years Japan has resumed taking North Pacific [[fin whale]] and [[sei whale]]s in their research whaling. The fin whales are highly desired because they yield arguably the best quality of tail meat (''onomi'').&lt;ref name=kershaw&gt;{{Harvnb|Kershaw|1988}},p.67&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese research vessels refer to the harvested whale meat as incidental byproducts which have resulted from study.

In Japan, the research whale meat was sold at officially published prices,&lt;ref name=ishihara&gt;{{Harvnb|Ishihara|Yoshii|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; but since 2011 an auction bid system has been adopted&lt;ref name=ippan-nyusatsu&gt;{{citation|ref=harv|author=Institute of Cetacean Research|title=Nyūsatsu mōshikomi shoshiki 1: 4th round minke whale, 5th round sei whale of 18th N.

The channels through which premium cuts such as fin whale tail meat are sold remain opaque. A report by one of the [[Tokyo Two|Greenpeace Japan activists who intercepted whale meat package deliveries]] got no further than the sentiment by one restaurateur that it would take [[Nagatachō]] (i.e. high government) connections&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|last1=Sato|first1=Junichi|last2=Holden|first2=Sara|ref=harv|title=Greenpeace Investigation: Japan's Stolen Whale Meat Scandal|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/PageFiles/25179/whale-meat-scandal-dossier.pdf|date=2008-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; to get it.

==Regions==
In places such as [[Norway]], [[Iceland]], and [[Alaska]], whale meat may be served without seasoning. However, it can also be cured or marinated, or made into jerky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7281989.stm |title=Why Japan persists in hunting whales |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-03-07 |accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
In Norway, whale meat was a cheap and common food until the 80s. It could be used in many ways but was often cooked in a pot with lid in a little water so that broth was created and then served with potatoes and vegetables, often with [[flatbrød]] at the side.

===Greenland===
The consumption of whale meat by the Inuit people in [[Greenland]] is part of their culture. However, in 2010, tourists also have begun to consume the meat. A [[Whale and Dolphin Conservation]] Society (WDCS) investigation has documented the practice of commercial wholesalers commissioning subsistence whalers to supply the demand by supermarkets. Whale products in Greenland are sold in 4-star hotels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20100624005505&amp;newsLang=en |title=Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society: Whales Intended for Subsistence in Greenland Are Sold in 4-Star Restaurants to Tourists |publisher=Business Wire |date=2010-06-24 |accessdate=2010-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whales have been hunted for meat in Japan since before 800 AD. After [[World War II]], due to damage to Japan's infrastructure, whale meat became an important source of [[protein (nutrition)|proteins]].&lt;ref name="slate1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Palmer |first=Brian |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2247583 |title=What Does Whale Taste Like? |publisher=Slate Magazine |date=11 March 2010 |accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bjreview.com.cn/world/txt/2007-12/28/content_93184.htm |title=A Whale of a Controversy |author=Yan Wei |publisher=Beijing Review |date=2008-01-03 |accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=heibonsha&gt;{{Harvnb|Heibonsha|1969}}, Kawashima's section of encyclopedia article&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern-day Japan, two cuts of whale meat are usually created: the belly meat and the tail meat. In the early 19th century, 70 different cuts were known.&lt;ref name="slate1"/&gt; People still call the belly and tail cuts by their special whalemeat names, and also, different parts of the body such as the tongue retain their jargon names (see below). The tail meat is not the same as the fluke (tail flipper), and they go by different names.

As previously mentioned, different cuts of whale meat have specialised names. The belly meat, in the striped bellows-like underbelly of baleen whales "from the lower jaw to the navel",&lt;ref name="ishihara"/&gt; is called {{Nihongo3||ウネス（畝須）|unesu}} and is known for being made into whale bacon.&lt;ref name="ishihara"/&gt;&lt;ref name=heibonsha/&gt;

The prized tail meat, called {{Nihongo3||尾の身|onomi}} or {{Nihongo3||尾肉|oniku}} are two strips of muscle that run from the dorsal to the base of the fluke. The tail meat is regarded as marbled, and is eaten as [[sashimi]] or [[tataki]]. Even [[Masanori Hata]] (aka Mutsugorō) a [[zoologist]] author and animal shelter operator has extolled the delicacy of the tail meat.&lt;ref name=mutsugoro&gt;{{cite web|ref=harv|url=http://mutsugoro-okoku.com/mutsutabete12-1.html|last=Hata|first=Masanori|work=連載　ムツゴロウの「食べて幸せ」タイトルメニュー|title=第十二回　クジラ、そしてサケの王　前篇 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can only be derived from larger baleen whales, and the [[fin whale]]'s meat has been considered superior.&lt;ref name=kershaw/&gt;&lt;ref name=mutsugoro/&gt; When the ban on this species was in place and Japan ostensibly complied, what was claimed to be genuine fin whale was still available, and legitimized as "grandfathered" goods, i.e., frozen stock from animals caught when still legal.&lt;ref name=kershaw/&gt; In the past when [[blue whale]] hunting was still conducted by all nations, its tail fin was served in Japan.&lt;ref name=heibonsha/&gt;

The other portions are labelled lean, or {{Nihongo|"red meat"|赤肉|akaniku|}} and command much lower prices than the tail.

The fluke or tail flipper is referred to as either {{Nihongo3||尾羽|oba}}&lt;ref name="ishihara"/&gt; or {{Nihongo3||尾羽毛|obake}}. After being cured in salt it is thinly sliced, scalded with hot water and rinsed, and served as ''sarashi kujira ''(pictured).

The tongue, called {{Nihongo3||さえずり|saezuri}} is often processed and used in high-end [[oden]]. The fried skin after the blubber is called ''koro'',&lt;ref name="ishihara"/&gt; and analogous to "fritter/crackling".

The Japanese article under [[:ja:鯨肉#鯨肉の名称|鯨肉]] provides a more extensive list, which includes the [[intestine]]s, [[sex organ]]s, and other [[offal]].

Some other dishes are: cubed and grilled blubber, cartilage salads, and whale skin stew.&lt;ref name="slate1"/&gt;

As of 2006, in Japan, 5,560 tons of whale meat worth ¥5.5 billion is sold in every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20080308a2.html |title=Greenpeace: Stores, eateries less inclined to offer whale |publisher=The Japan Times Online |date=2008-03-08 |accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese market has declined in recent years, with prices falling to $26 per kilogram in 2004, down $6 per kilogram from 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/18/AR2005061800890.html |title=Reviving a Taste for Whale |author=Anthony Faiola |publisher=Washington Post |date=2005-06-19 |accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluke meat can sell for over $200 per kilogram, over three times the price of belly meat.&lt;ref name="slate1"/&gt;

Greenpeace has alleged that some of the meat on sale is illegally sourced. They have claimed that it has been illegally smuggled from crew members of research ships&lt;ref name=Gr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-in-japan/ |title=Whale meat in Japan |publisher=Greenpeace |date=8 January 2009 |accessdate=18 February 2012 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121202130802/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/oceans/whaling/ending-japanese-whaling/whale-meat-in-japan/ |archivedate=2 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that more meat is caught than can be consumed by humans, with up to 20% of 2004's catch going unsold.&lt;ref name=Gr/&gt;

===Native Alaskan communities===
{{Main|Inuit diet}}

For thousands of years, [[Native Alaskans]] of the Arctic have depended on whale meat. The meat is harvested from legal, non-commercial hunts that occur twice a year in the spring and autumn. The meat is stored and eaten throughout the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-10549107 |title=Native Alaskans say oil drilling threatens way of life |publisher=BBC News |date=20 July 2010 |accessdate=2010-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tikiġaġmiut]], [[Iñupiat]] living on the coast of Alaska, divided their catch into 10 sections. The fatty tail, considered to be the best part, went to the captain of the conquering vessel, while the less-desired sections were given to his crew and others that assisted with the kill.&lt;ref name="slate1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pulu&gt;Pulu, Tupou L., Ruth Ramoth-Sampson, and Angeline Newlin. [http://www.alaskool.org/projects/traditionalife/WhalingAWOL/WHALING-English.html "Whaling: A Way of Life."] ''University of Alaska.'' 2004. Accessed 5 Feb 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The skin and blubber, known as [[muktuk]], taken from the bowhead, beluga, or narwhal is also valued, and is eaten raw or cooked. ''[[Mikigaq]]'' is the fermented whale meat.&lt;ref name=pulu/&gt;

===Faroe Islands===
{{Main|Whaling in the Faroe Islands}}

Whaling in the [[Faroe Islands]] in the North Atlantic has been practiced since about the time of the first Norse settlements on the islands. Around 1000 [[Long-finned Pilot Whale]]s (''Globicephala melaena'') are killed annually, mainly during the summer.&lt;ref name="contaminated"&gt;{{cite news|last=Nguyen|first=Vi|title=Warning over contaminated whale meat as Faroe Islands' killing continues|url=http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_round_up/687202/warning_over_contaminated_whale_meat_as_faroe_islands_killing_continues.html|newspaper=The Ecologist|date=26 November 2010|quote=The allegation came as it emerged that a record 1,115 pilot whales have been slaughtered on the Faroe Islands in 2010 so far - the largest quota recorded since 1996.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hunts, called "grindadráp" in [[Faroese language|Faroese]], are organized on a community level.

Both the meat and blubber are stored and prepared in various ways, including [[Tvøst og spik]]. When fresh, the meat is often boiled. It can also be served as steak (grindabúffur). This dish comprises meat and blubber, which is salted and then boiled for an hour, served with potatoes. The meat can also be hung out to dry and then served in thin slivers. At parties some choose to serve "kalt borð" (cold table), which means a variety of cold food, which can include dried whale meat, dried blubber or blubber which is preserved in water with much salt in it, dried fish, dried sheep meat, etc. Traditionally, whale meat was preserved by hanging salted pieces (called "likkjur") outdoors under a roof to be dried in the wind. This method is still used today, particularly in villages. Today, both meat and blubber can also be stored in freezers.

In 2008, Faroe Islands Chief Medical Officer Høgni Debes Joensen and Pál Weihe of the Department of Public and Occupational Health recommended that pilot whales no longer be considered fit for human consumption due to the presence of DDT derivatives, PCBs and mercury in the meat.&lt;ref name="contaminated"/&gt; Their recommendation was based on research suggesting a correlation between mercury intake and the high rate of [[Parkinson's disease]] on the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:1GhCNszaC8EJ:www.whaling.fo/Files/Filer/whaling/pilot_whale_meat_and_blubber_-_info_note_%282%29%255B1%255D.pdf+P%C3%A1l+Weihe+and+H%C3%B8gni+Debes+Joensen&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiAHA2BPEdKi66uiNvqaFOwgtPRj-1ALlxyd138TMO4ib03recr4fq23cJZYle-S4lD1ksWSb0SlIfDQk3X3OY8trjxkcRmHKHOwBKJVbxHE5og1KMvpSPgcteg4id5mzZBQqKJ&amp;sig=AHIEtbSeZnafDJVMJsJf1_h6psKHJ7_3sA |title=The consumption of pilot whale meat and blubber in the Faroes |publisher=Uttranrikisradid Ministry of Foreign Affairs |date=June 2009 |accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="toxic-whale"&gt;{{cite news |first=Debora |last=MacKenzie |date=28 November 2008 |title=Faroe islanders told to stop eating 'toxic' whales |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16159-faroe-islanders-told-to-stop-eating-toxic-whales.html |work=[[New Scientist]] |accessdate=21 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1 June 2011, the Faroese Food and Veterinary Authority has advised Faroe Islanders not to eat the kidney or liver of pilot whales, not to consume more than one serving per month, and, for women and girls, to refrain from eating blubber if they plan to have children and to refrain from whale meat entirely if they are breastfeeding, pregnant or planning to conceive in the following three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contaminants and human health|url=http://www.whaling.fo/Default.aspx?ID=6771|publisher=Whales and whaling in the Faroe Islands|accessdate=18 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208161324/http://www.whaling.fo/Default.aspx?ID=6771|archivedate=8 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moskvitch|first=Katia|title=Anti-whaling NGOs warn of 'contaminated' whale meat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11113887|newspaper=BBC News|date=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Main |Whaling in the United Kingdom}}
During [[World War II]] the British [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Minister of Food]] introduced [[Rationing in the United Kingdom#World War II|food rationing]] but allowed whale meat to be distributed 'off ration'. It was not popular because of the smell whilst cooking was deemed 'unpleasant', and the taste was considered 'bland' even when spiced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cooksinfo.com/british-wartime-food|title=British Wartime Food|publisher=Cook's info Encyclopedia|accessdate=22 Jul 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Aftermath of World War II|post-World War II period]] in the [[United Kingdom]], corned whale meat was available as an [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|unrationed]] alternative to other meats.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19510824&amp;id=sS5WAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3uUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5246,5228771 Corned Whale] – ''[[The Spokesman-Review]]''.

==Toxicity==
Tests have revealed that in whale meat sold in Japan, high levels of mercury and other toxins are present. A research study was conducted by Tetsuya Endo, Koichi Haraguchi and Masakatsu Sakata at the [[University of Hokkaido]] found high levels of mercury in the organs of whales, particularly the liver. They stated that "Acute intoxication could result from a single ingestion" of liver. The study found that liver samples for sale in Japan contained, on average, 370 micrograms of mercury per gram of meat, 900 times the government's limit. Levels detected in kidneys and lungs were approximately 100 times higher than the limit.&lt;ref name="newscientist1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Coghlan|first=Andy|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2362-extreme-mercury-levels-revealed-in-whalemeat.html |title=Extreme mercury levels revealed in whalemeat |publisher=New Scientist |date=6 June 2002 |accessdate=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is due to the animal's [[trophic level]], however, rather than its size. This means that there is a significant difference between the mercury levels in toothed whales and baleen whales, the former having a much higher concentration.

==Environmental impact==
Norwegian-based High North Alliance, has suggested that the [[carbon footprint]] resulting from eating whale meat is substantially lower than that of [[beef]]. [[Greenpeace]] has responded that, "The survival of a species is more important than lower greenhouse gas emissions from eating it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKL0340706220080304 |title=Eat whale and save the planet says Norwegian lobby |author=Alister Doyle |publisher=Reuters |date=4 March 2008 |accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many organizations, including [[Greenpeace]] and the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]], have criticised the whale trade for preying on endangered species, as studies have shown an alarming decrease in whale populations, which may significantly affect oceans and its foodchains, therefore it may affect lives in a foreseable future.

==Anti-whaling efforts==
{{Main|Anti-whaling}}

Groups such as the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society have attempted to disrupt commercial whaling with varying degrees of success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Van Der Werf |first=Wietse |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/mar/25/sea-shepherd-japanese-whalers |title=Sea Shepherd seafarers battle sickness and Japanese whalers |publisher=The Guardian |date=25 March 2010 |accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zoltán Szabó''' (born 1968 – December 5, 2016 in [[Szeged]]), known as the '''Balástya Monster''', was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[serial killer]] who killed women for monetary purposes. He was convicted of killing four people out of his 5 confirmed murders, but could possibly have upwards of 6 victims.

== Early life ==
Szabó was born into a farmer's family in 1968, and had lived on a farm since his youth. He studied until the eight grade in elementary school, refusing to study any more. His father died early, and his brother who lived on the farm committed suicide. He had a violent partner, frequently interrupting contact with her. Szabó then began living alone as a farmer and casual worker on his farm, but also participated in a special farmers' work organization which accommodated seasonal workers from [[Romania]] who came during the agricultural season. During the second half of the 1990s, the traffic near [[Balástya]] grew, as the civil war in [[Yugoslavia]] had recently ended and many passed through the 5th Highway along the settlement. The increasing turnover of the highway attracted businesses, criminals, merchants and prostitutes to the settlement, including some of Szabó's future victims.

== Confirmed murders ==
Szabó's first proven murder was of a woman working in the press, with whom he met on April 28, 1998. He managed to persuade her to stay on his farm on the outskirts of Balástya. Upon their arrival, the woman was hit with a heavy object several times, dying from the severe head injuries. Szabó then dismembered his victim and buried her body in a pit 50 meters away from the farm, in which he also placed her clothes. The second murder took place in a similar fashion. Szabó met another woman whom he persuaded to come to his farm. When she came, he hit her with heavy object on the head and neck, with the woman dying from the heavy blows. The body was then dismembered and placed in the same pit as before, the only difference being that the second victim's head was never discovered.

In February 2000, on the pretext of the joint mugging of a group of firefighters, Szabó killed Teresia K. The woman was strangled in an orchard, and was then mutilated and burned. Her clothes were never found either.

The fourt proven murder led to Szabó's downfall. In August 2001, he convinced a female dealer who used to sell radios and telephones that she would get a large amount of phones at a favorable price. The woman believed him, and on August 25 she collected 300,000 [[forint]]s from the bank. The woman then drove to Szabó's farm, where she was strangled by him not far from the place. The murderer then disposed of the evidence and the woman's small motorbike in a nearby water hole. However, the authorities were closely monitoring the disappearances, and when the phone dealer disappeared, they searched through her call lists, where they found Zoltán Szabó's number. When questioned, he confessed to the murder. Later on, when more corpses were discovered, he confessed to these murders as well.

== Unconfirmed murders ==
On August 25, 1998, Szabó supposedly forced prostitute Mónika K. to leave the 5th Highway car park and go to his farm. There, he strangled her in a nearby orchard and dragged the body to a track near the [[Cegléd-Szeged railway]] line. Subsequently, a [[freight train]] and two other trains ran over the body, completely crushing it. Although Szabó was last seen in her company, the court could not definitely prove that he was the culprit, and he was not convicted of Mónika K.'s murder.

Szabó also mentioned a sixth murder, which he claimed to have not committed but simply knew of. The investigators doubted his claim of innocence, but the post-mortum investigation proved ineffective, and so this case was included in the indictment.

The police investigator who headed the investigation also stated that he was certain Szabó was responsible for more murders. The detective, referring to a witness' testimony, wrote that Szabó was responsible for the disappearances of a Romanian family of five. He was so confident of his opinion that he offered 500,000 forints to Szabó for each new corpse he showed the location to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20051205milliokat.html|title=The case of the Balástya murders was reopened|publisher=Origo|date=5 December 2005|accessdate=2 October 2015|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation, trial and prison ==
After Szabó's capture, extensive research began for the killer's victims. According to his testimony, the area was searched, and in the given locations unexplored excavations with unprecedented landscaping scales were never found in Balástya. During the search, the four corpses from Szabó's testimonies were located, but no remnants of other murders were found. Despite this, the prosecution suspected him of murdering five women.

The [[Csongrád County]] court, which was serving at first instance level, found Zoltán Szabó guilty of all four murders and sentenced him to [[life imprisonment]] in November 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.ma.hu/tart/rcikk/a/0/65744/1|title=Lifetime Imprisonment is the deserved punishment of "Balástya's Nightmare"|publisher=ma.hu|date=20 November 2003|accessdate=2 October 2015|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 10, 2004, the Szeged Court Judge sentenced to life imprisonment for a final time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20040910eletfogytiglant.html|title=The Balástyan Nightmare is a lifesaver|publisher=Origo|date=10 September 2004|accessdate=2 October 2015|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.delmagyar.hu/szeged_hirek/pipas_pista_a_mi_drakulank/2442732/|title=Pipás Pista is our Dracula|publisher=South Hungary|date=31 August 2015|accessdate=2 October 2015|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trial Chamber could not find any evidence that Szabó's murders involved sexual aberration, and there was no mention of this ''other despicable reason'' in the judgment.

The farm where Szabó's offenses were committed still stands as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://rtl.hu/rtlklub/hirek/hatter/cikkek/104949|title=The Badminton Terrorist of Balástya|publisher=RTL Club|date=7 January 2005|accessdate=2 October 2015|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offender was detained in the secluded area of the Star Prison in Szeged. On December 5, 2016, the suicidal Szabó and his cellmate hanged themselves.&lt;ref name="index"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://index.hu/belfold/2016/12/05/ongyilkossag_borton_balastyai_rem/|title=Index - Belföld - Öngyilkos lett a börtönben a balástyai rém|website=index.hu|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
