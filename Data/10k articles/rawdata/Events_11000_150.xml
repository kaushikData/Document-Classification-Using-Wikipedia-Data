'''Anastasia''' is the [[fictional character]] from the 1997 [[Fox Animation Studios]] film [[Anastasia (1997 film)|of the same name]], and a fictional version of [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia]]. She is voiced by [[Meg Ryan]], while [[Liz Callaway]] provides her singing voice. She is the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia ("Anya"), the youngest daughter and one of two surviving members of the Imperial family.

==Physical features==
''[[The New York Times]]'' describes her thus: "''Anastasia'' stops just short of making its title character a blonde. (She, like many of the other characters has auburn hair.) Otherwise, she has the slender curving body and peachy complexion of a small-town Miss America contestant dreaming of conquest in Atlantic City. [[Meg Ryan]]'s voice gives her the slightly combative tone of a snippy, know-it-all cheerleader. In a beauty contest, she would definitely be docked points for lack of charm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Holden |first=Stephen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9503E0D91738F937A25752C1A961958260 |title=Movie Review - Anastasia - FILM REVIEW; A Feeling We're Not in Russia Anymore |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=1997-11-14 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
Anya first appears in the film ''[[Anastasia (1997 film)|Anastasia]]'' as a girl at an orphanage who has vague recollections about life before she arrived. She goes on a quest to find out about her past. In [[St. Petersberg]] she meets con-men Dimitri and Vladimir who try to dress her up to turn her into the Princess Anastasia, because her grandmother [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Maria Feodorovna (Empress Marie)]] is offering a reward to anyone who reunites her with her granddaughter (who became lost after the palace was stormed and the royal family was killed). However, Dimitri and Vladimir are unaware that Anya actually is Anastasia. Unfortunately, the evil [[Grigori Rasputin|Rasputin]] knows the truth about Anya and tries to kill her. However, he ultimately fails. Anya is reunited with her grandmother near the end of the film, and is offered the chance to be a princess. Anya eventually elopes with Dimitri and leaves a note for her grandmother promising to return after their honeymoon.

Anya has a slender frame and slightly tanned skin, along with long flowing [[auburn hair]] and blue eyes. Unlike most animated heroines, she wears many outfits throughout the movie. She starts off the movie clad in a ragged yellow [[tunic]] and black [[tights]] under a green [[overcoat]]. Once she is en route to Paris, however, she wears a short-sleeved blue [[dress]] given to her by Dimitri. After showcasing a series of [[flapper]]-inspired outfits, Anya wears a strapless navy blue [[evening gown]] with her hair up. At the end, when Anya is now known to be the Princess Anastasia, she wears an elaborate gold court dress, complete with a glittering diamond [[kokoshnik]].

==Critical reception==
ReelViews wrote that Anya is "easily the strongest, most independent animated female to grace the screen, surpassing even Belle for spunk. Meg Ryan is perfect for this role."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=139 |title=Reelviews Movie Reviews |publisher=Reelviews.net |date=1997-11-12 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; SFGate said "it's worth noting Ryan's stunning job -- she sounds pert, feisty, fun. Everything audiences liked about Ryan in, say, "Sleepless in Seattle," they'll like about her here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Stack |url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Epic-Anastasia-Has-Heart-Fun-Good-Tunes-2821637.php |title=Epic `Anastasia' Has Heart, Fun, Good Tunes |publisher=SFGate |date=1997-11-21 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNN says the character is "perkily voiced by Meg Ryan," though adds "much of the drawing for Anya and Dimitri is flat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/9711/26/review.anastasia/ |title=CNN - 'Anastasia': A not-so-imperial effort - November 26, 1997 |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date=1997-11-26 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philly.com says the character is "strongly voiced in a jarringly contemporary American accent by Meg Ryan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryan |first=Desmond |url=http://articles.philly.com/1997-11-21/entertainment/25544847_1_anastasia-dowager-empress-rasputin |title='Anastasia' Sets History Aside Rasputin's Curse Caused The Russian Revolution? Well, At Least The Animation Is Top-notch. - Philly.com |publisher=Articles.philly.com |date=2012-11-19 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ScreenIt argues "The plot also has a few inexplicable, but key elements. It's never fully or convincingly explained why Anya can't remember her childhood (she was eight-years-old, after all, when the revolution took place), beyond what we assume was an amnesia inducing fall at a train station. Likewise, it seems odd that Rasputin would assume that Anastasia died during the revolution when his last glimpse of her was as he slid underwater to his death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenit.com/movies/1997/anastasia.html |title=Anastasia |publisher=Screenit.com |date=1997-11-15 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Entertainment Weekly]] argues "The story's somber emotional hook — Anastasia's thwarted desire for home — is asserted rather than dramatized. (This may have something to do with the fact that she's cast out of the palace before we've had a chance to enjoy her being there.)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,290275,00.html |title=Movie Review: 'Anastasia' Review &amp;#124; Movie Reviews and News |publisher=EW.com |date=1997-11-14 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BabelCon''' was a [[science fiction]] and [[multigenre convention]], held in [[Baton Rouge]], [[Louisiana]]. Established in 2006, the convention took place at the Cook Hotel and Lod &amp; Carole Cook Alumni Center on the campus of [[Louisiana State University]]. Formerly a project of the non-profit Science &amp; Engineering Education Foundation (SEEF), it was last managed by Babelcon LLC.&lt;ref name="llc"/&gt; After a split between the organizers in late 2010, the upcoming convention was postponed then ultimately cancelled.

This convention was typically a three-day event comprising panels, seminars, demonstrations, and workshops.  Guests sometimes include science fiction and fantasy authors, artists, and celebrities from genre television series and movies.  BabelCon was named for the site of a diplomatic conference in the classic ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode "[[Journey to Babel]]".&lt;ref name="ta080718"/&gt;

== History ==
BabelCon was launched in 2006, as a project of a local science fiction and gaming group, Star One Delta (SOD).&lt;ref name="ta060806"/&gt;  The organizers were inspired to create BabelCon after Crescent City Con in [[New Orleans]] ended a 20-year run in 2005 and, in the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]], efforts to launch a new convention in New Orleans were stalled.&lt;ref name="ta060806"/&gt; In 2008, BabelCon was legally separated from Star One Delta, and a new non-profit organization, the Science &amp; Engineering Education Foundation (SEEF), was created to run the convention.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Conventions==

===Past events===
'''BabelCon''' was held on Saturday, August 5, 2006, at the West Baton Rouge Conference Center in [[Port Allen, Louisiana]].  Notable guests at the one-day event included ''[[Lost In Space]]'' actor [[Bob May (actor)|Bob May]].&lt;ref name="ta060806"/&gt;

'''BabelCon 2''' was held on Saturday, August 4, 2007 at the West Baton Rouge Conference Center in Port Allen, Louisiana.  Activities included gaming, a fantasy art show, science panels, and celebrity guests.  Notable guests at the one-day event included ''Star Trek'' actors [[Lee Meriwether]] and [[Robert O'Reilly]] as well as several local authors and fan groups.&lt;ref name="ta070727"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ta070803"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ta070810"/&gt;

'''BabelCon 3''' was held on July 19–20, 2008, at the [[Holiday Inn Select]] in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  The two-day event featured guest stars [[Richard Hatch (actor)|Richard Hatch]], [[Suzie Plakson]], [[J. G. Hertzler]], and [[Bob May (actor)|Bob May]], paranormal investigators Kalila Katherina Smith and Brad Duplechein, plus several local authors and educators.&lt;ref name="ta080718"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sh080718"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ta080720"/&gt;  Attendance was estimated to be about 1000 fans.&lt;ref name="ta080720"/&gt;

'''BabelCon 4''' was held on July 17–19, 2009, at the Cook Hotel in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  Guest stars at the three-day event included [[Rekha Sharma]], [[Tiffany Grant]], [[Patrick Burns (paranormal investigator)|Patrick Burns]], as well as several local authors and educators. Convention staff said attendance was "down slightly from past years".&lt;ref name="ta090719"/&gt;

'''BabelCon 4.5''' was held on March 19–21, 2010, at the Cook Hotel in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  Originally listed as "BabelCon 2010 - the Year We Make Contact" it was changed to a "mini-con" and given the designation of "4.5".  The convention aimed at "a cozy con atmosphere" relying on panels rather than celebrity guests for entertainment.&lt;ref name="news09"/&gt;  Scaled back due to economic pressures from the [[late-2000s recession]], the event featured Sal Lizard, the president of [[Starfleet International]], as its headline guest.  As in previous conventions local authors also gave talks and spoke with guests.

===Cancelled events===
The next BabelCon event was originally scheduled to be held March 25–27, 2011, but was postponed.&lt;ref name="abtus"/&gt;  After a split in convention management in late 2010, many of the original BabelCon staff and organizers planned their own event after the BabelCon name was registered with the Louisiana Secretary of State by another individual. This event, the Louisiana Science Fiction and Costuming Festival, was first held March 25–27, 2011.&lt;ref name="lsfcf"/&gt;

In April 2012, new management acquired the assets of Babelcon LLC to settle existing debts and allow the event to move forward.&lt;ref name="face"/&gt; Due to funding issues and another change in management, Babelcon was tentatively rescheduled for mid-October 2012.&lt;ref name="face"/&gt; The convention was eventually cancelled and the organization dispersed.

The '''Battle of the Maule''' was fought between the [[Mapuche]] people of Chile and the [[Inca Empire]] of Peru in what is now the [[Maule River]], Chile. The three-day battle, which is generally believed to have occurred in the reign of [[Tupac Inca Yupanqui]] (1471-93 CE),&lt;ref&gt;The history of the Inca campaign in Chile and this battle are known from the '''[http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Comentarios_reales  Comentarios reales]'''  of  de [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega]],  Segunda Parte : Libro VII Cap. 18, 19 and 20. These were derived from Inca sources.  The Spanish histories of [[Jerónimo de Vivar]], '''Crónica y relación copiosa y verdadera de los reinos de Chile''' and [[Vicente Carvallo y Goyeneche]], '''Descripción Histórico Geografía del Reino de Chile''', Tomo I, Capítulo I mention it also.&lt;/ref&gt; marked the end of the Incas' southward expansion.

In a six-year campaign with an army that eventually rose to 50,000 men, the Inca general Sinchiruca&lt;ref&gt;Vicente Carvallo, Comentarios reales, Segunda Parte : Libro VII Cap 18&lt;/ref&gt; had subdued the regions of northern Chile, [[Copiapó]], [[Coquimbo Region|Coquimbo]], [[Valparaíso Region|Aconcagua]] and the [[Maipo Valley]] around what is now [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]. After securing the Maipo Valley Sinchiruca sent 20,000 men down to the valley of the [[Maule River]]. The territory of the [[Picunche]] people inhabiting this last region south of Maipo Valley extended further to the south to the [[Itata River]] and these people the south of the Maipo Valley had refused to submit to the rule of the Inca and called on their allies south of the Maule; the Antalli, Pincu, and Cauqui to join in opposing these invaders.&lt;ref name="Vega p 19"&gt;de Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, Comentarios reales Segunda Parte : Libro VII Cap 19&lt;/ref&gt; This defiance gave them their distinctive name of [[Promaucaes|Purumaucas]] from [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] ''purum awqa'' meaning "savage enemy".  The Spanish later enhanced the name into [[Promaucaes]].

The Incas crossed the Maule River, and keeping their old custom, they sent messengers to require these Purumaucas to submit to the rule of the Inca or resort to arms. The Purumaucas had determined to die before losing their freedom, and responded that the victors would be masters of the defeated and that the Incas would quickly see how the Purumaucas obeyed. Three or four days after this answer, the Purumaucas and their allies arrived and camped in front of the Incas' camp with 18,000 - 20,000 warriors. The Incas tried diplomacy, offering peace and friendship, claiming they were not going to take their land and property but to give them a way to live as men. The Purumaucas responded saying that they came not to waste time in vain words and reasoning, but to fight until they won or died. The Incas promised battle the next day.&lt;ref name="Vega p 19" /&gt;

The following day both armies left their camps and fought all day without either gaining an advantage, and both suffering many wounded and dead.  At night they both retired to their positions. On the second and third day they fought with the same results. At the end of the third day of battle both factions saw that they had lost more than half their number in dead, and the living were almost all wounded. On the fourth day, neither side left their own camp, which had been fortified, as they hoped to defend them if their opponents attacked. The fifth and sixth days were passed in the same manner but by the seventh the Purumaucas and their allies retired and returned home claiming victory.&lt;ref name="Fraser page 43"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, Comentarios reales Segunda Parte : Libro VII Cap 20&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sea burial.jpg|thumb|Burial at sea for two casualties of a Japanese submarine attack on the US aircraft carrier {{USS|Liscome Bay|CVE-56|6}}, November 1943]]
'''Burial at sea''' is the disposal of [[Cadaver|human remains]] in the ocean, normally from a ship or boat. It is regularly performed by navies, and is done by private citizens in many countries.

[[File:US Navy 110409-N-0074G-026 Sailors aboard USS Enterprise (CVN 65) prepare to cast ashes overboard during a burial at sea.jpg|thumb|Burial at sea ceremony for cremated remains, on the aircraft carrier {{Ship|USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}, April 2011]]

Burial-at-sea services are conducted at many different locations and with many different customs, either by ship or by aircraft. Usually, either the [[Captain (nautical)|captain]] (or ) of the ship or aircraft or a religious representative (of the decedent's religion or the state religion) performs the ceremony.

The ceremony may include burial in a casket, burial sewn in sailcloth, burial in an urn, or scattering of the cremated remains from a ship.  Burial at sea by aircraft is usually done only with cremated remains.  Other types of burial at sea include the mixing of the ashes with concrete and dropping the concrete block to form an artificial [[reef]] such as the [[Atlantis Reef]].

Below is a list of religions that allow burial at sea, with some details of the burial.

==By religion==
===Buddhism===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}
There are very few traditional Buddhist burials at sea. Traditionally, the deceased are cremated and the ashes are placed in a grave or [[columbarium]]. Particularly in East Asian or [[Mahayana Buddhism]], a physical gravesite is considered important for the conduct of memorial and ancestor rites. The [[Buddhist Churches of America]], the North American branch of Japanese [[Jodo Shinshu]] Buddhism, has created a service for Buddhist burials at sea, primarily for military service members.  In Thailand ashes are generally placed in a wreath with lit candles and floated off to sea from a vessel followed by a procession of mourning wreaths, with lit candles also.

===Christianity===
====Catholicism====
Officially, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] prefers normal casket burials over cremations, but does allow for cremation subject to the condition that the ashes are entombed or buried. Catholics believe it is not proper to scatter or pour the cremated remains over the sea, water, or on the land. According to the Roman Catholic Church this action does not give due respect to the remains of the deceased, nor does it allow for the closure and healing of family and friends. Likewise they see that the custom of housing the remains with family or friends and not placing the deceased in the ground does not offer loved ones a specific and sacred place to visit the individual. Visiting the deceased in a holy place provides believers with a space to offer prayers, commune with those who have gone before them in faith, and reminds them to await the resurrection of their own bodies. Burial at sea in a casket or in an urn is approved for cases where the deceased expired in the sea. The committal prayer number 406§4 is used in this case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicliturgy.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/DocumentContents/Index/2/SubIndex/40/DocumentIndex/313] Accessed December 11, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

====Protestantism====
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}
The [[Anglican Communion]] has detailed procedures for burial at sea. The ship has to be stopped, and the body has to be sewn in canvas, suitably weighted. Anglican (and other) chaplains of the Royal Navy bury cremated remains of ex-Naval personnel at sea. Scattering of cremated remains is discouraged, not least for practical reason

The Book of Common Prayer (1928) of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States ([[ECUSA]]), a member of the [[Anglican Communion]] provides a specific prayer of committal for burials at sea:

At the Burial of the Dead at Sea.
The same Office may be used; but instead of the Sentence of Committal, the Minister shall say:
{{quote|Unto Almighty God we commend the soul of our brother departed, and we commit his body to the deep; in sure and certain hope of the Resurrection unto eternal life, through our Lord Jesus Christ; at whose coming in glorious majesty to judge the world, the sea shall give up her dead; and the corruptible bodies of those who sleep in him shall be changed, and made like unto his glorious body; according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all things unto himself.&lt;ref&gt;''Book of Common Prayer'' (1928), p.&amp;nbsp;337 [The Church Pension Fund]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] naval veterans and seamen prefer to be buried at sea. In those cases either the casket or urn is set to sea, or ashes scattered. The procedure is similar as that with the Anglican church. Some parishes have specific consecrated sea areas where ashes can be sprinkled.

===Hinduism===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}
Traditionally, the deceased are cremated, the bones and ashes are collected, and the ashes/remains are immersed in the [[Ganges River]] if possible or in any other river if not.

===Islam===
The sacred texts of [[Islam]] prefer burial on land, "so deep that its smell does not come out and the beasts of prey do not dig it out". However, if a person dies at sea and it is not possible to bring the body back to land before decay, or if burial at land becomes impossible, burial at sea is allowed. A weight is tied to the feet of the body, and the body is lowered into the water. This would preferably occur in an area where the remains are not immediately eaten by scavengers.

In the [[Sunni]] [[Fiqh]] book ''[[Umdat al-Salik wa Uddat al-Nasik]]'', the condition for sea burial is:

{{quote|It is best to bury him (the deceased) in the cemetery&amp;nbsp;... If someone dies on a ship and it is impossible to bury him on land, the body is placed (O: tightly lashed) between two planks (O: to obviate bloating) and thrown into the sea (O: so that it reaches shore, even if the inhabitants are non-Muslims, since a Muslim might find the body and bury it facing the direction of prayer (qibla)).&lt;ref&gt;Reliance of the Traveller, Ahmad ibn Naqib al-Misri, p 237, Translated by Nuh Ha Mim Keller, Amanah publications, {{ISBN|0-915957-72-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Judaism===
According to [[halacha|Jewish law]], a dead person must be quickly buried and [[Bereavement in Judaism#Burial|burial]] requires covering in earth.&lt;ref&gt;Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 362:1.&lt;/ref&gt; This law is derived from Devarim (Deuteronomy) 21:23 "Bury, you will bury him the same day; for the (unburied body) is a curse to God" the double command to bury causing a positive commandment to entomb in the earth and a negative commandment forbidding leaving an unburied body.  The legal text [[Shulchan Aruch]] brings a case example explaining that even if a person is known to have drowned in a closed body of water such as a small pond where there can be certainty that the victim had not somehow survived, the family does not begin ritual [[shiva|mourning]] and remains in extended state of most intense mourning [[Bereavement in Judaism#Stages of mourning|aninut]] until either the body is found or after an exhaustive search despairs of recovering and burying the body.&lt;ref&gt;Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 375:7&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that the body is considered unburied when underwater; as [[Shiva (Judaism)|shiva]] mourning normally only begins after burial.  B'resheit(Genesis) 3:19 states "With the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, until you return to the ground, from (dust) you were taken and you are dust, and to dust you will return." From this we see that the only proper treatment of a dead body is to physically cover it with earth once land is available for the crew to bury the body, rather than to leave the body at sea or some other fate such as [[cremation]].

If for some reason the body of someone deceased aboard a ship causes an immediate life threat to those aboard the vessel the commandment to protect innocent life or [[pikuach nefesh]] overrides nearly all commandments including the command to bury the dead, as any appropriate actions to ensure safety of surviving crew are required to be taken which may include jettisoning a body at sea without burial. However, attempts would later be made to recover and bury when possible without life hazard.&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 18:5 "אֲשֶׁר יַעֲשֶׂה אֹתָם הָאָדָם וָחַי בָּהֶם"&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the desire to bury a body in the ground even after it has been long dead at sea, is that of the Israeli submarine [[INS Dakar|''Dakar'']] which was lost with no survivors in 1968 but was only discovered in 1999 lying broken at a depth of 3,000 meters. Search and recovery of any potentially existing remains at this very difficult to access depth has not shown results despite requests from family and the [[Military Rabbinate|Chief Rabbi]] of the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-10-18/news/1992292004_1_israeli-navy-submarine-dakar-israeli-government|title=Israel tries again to solve mystery of sub lost in '68|author=|date=|website=baltimoresun.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/nasa-says-remains-of-all-7-astronauts-recovered-then-retracts-1.20315|title=NASA Says Remains of All 7 Astronauts Recovered, Then Retracts|first=Nathan|last=Guttman|date=2 February 2003|publisher=|accessdate=5 April 2018|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://submarines.dotan.net/dakar/search/index.htm|title=Search and Discovery of the Israeli Submarine Dakar|first=Uri Dotan|last=Bochner|date=|website=submarines.dotan.net|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==

===Australia===
Burial at sea within Australian [[territorial waters]], exclusive economic zone and continental shelf is covered by the ''Environmental Protection (Sea Dumping Act) 1981'' administered by the federal Department of the Environment. A permit is required for burial of bodies at sea. Permits are usually only granted in cases of a strong connection to the sea, such as long-serving navy personnel. The body must not be embalmed or placed in a casket, it may only be sewn into a weighted shroud. The burial must be in water deeper than {{convert|2000|m|ft}} and not interfere with shipping, fishing or undersea communications. Australian Defence Force vessels engaged in armed conflicts or emergency situations are exempt from these requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A02478|title=Environmental Protection (Sea Dumping Act) 1981|publisher=Australian Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No permit is required to scatter ashes at sea.

===United Kingdom===
Burial at sea was a method hypothetically suggested by the then [[Medical Officer of Health]] for [[Liverpool]], Dr Duncan Dolton, in which unburied bodies could be buried at sea during any extended strike by gravediggers union the [[GMWU]] during the 1978–79 [[Winter of Discontent]]. The suggestion caused great alarm amongst the public and helped prompt a resolution to the strike.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} British colonial burials at sea of the 18th and 19th century involved wrapping the deceased in sailcloth weighted with cannonballs.

In [[England]], cremated remains may be scattered freely at sea but a burial must be made in a coffin meeting regulatory requirements and in one of three locations: off [[The Needles]], [[Isle of Wight]]; between [[Hastings]] and [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]]; and off [[Tynemouth]], [[North Tyneside]]. Permission may be sought for another burial site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Burial at sea |
url=https://www.gov.uk/burial-at-sea | accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some funeral directors will arrange the event, and the Britannia Shipping Company&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Britannia Shipping Company For Burial At Sea |
url=http://burialatsea.co.uk/ | accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; specialises in it. Charity organisation the Maritime Volunteer Service also helps carry out burials at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Burial at sea: Seven things you might not know |
url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-38210497 | accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Scotland]], there are two designated sites for burial at sea. These are 210 miles due west of [[Oban]] and  15 miles west of [[John O'Groats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Burials at Sea |url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/marine/Sea-Fisheries/management/restrictions/seaburials |publisher=Scottish Government |accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
A funeral director is not required for the burial of cremated remains at sea. However, full body burials require specific preparation to ensure the body or coffin sinks quickly, and in many states a licensed funeral director is required.&lt;ref name="NewEnglandBurialsAtSea.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.NewEnglandBurialsAtSea.com|title=New England Burials at Sea - Ash Scatterings at sea - Full Body Sea Burials - Eco Friendly Sea Burials- Burial Shrouds - USCG Licensed Captain - Burials at sea - Sea Burials|author=|date=|website=www.newenglandburialsatsea.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Environmental Protection Agency regulations for full body burials at sea in the United States require that the site of interment be {{convert|3|nmi|km mi}} from land and at a depth of at least {{convert|600|ft|m}}. California prohibits whole body burial within its state-asserted three-mile limit. Off the eastern coast of the United States, the closest sufficient depths are off Long Island ({{convert|75|mi|km|disp=x|/}}), Ocracoke ({{convert|20|mi|km|disp=x|/}}), and Miami ({{convert|5|mi|km|disp=x|/}}). This may require travel in excess of {{convert|30|mi|km}} for a suitable site.&lt;ref name=cfr40&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/region4/water/oceans/burial.html|title=Federal Register, Volume 40, Section 229.1|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Departing from the New England area requires a voyage of c. 45 miles to sea to reach the required 600&amp;nbsp;ft ocean depth.&lt;ref name="NewEnglandBurialsAtSea.com"/&gt; Sufficient depth is within 10 miles or less at many harbors along the U.S. west coast, including San Diego, Santa Barbara, Monterey, Fort Bragg, Eureka, and Crescent City, all in California.&lt;ref&gt;Google Earth bathymetry&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Navy]] inters intact remains from Norfolk and San Diego only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/navy_legacy_hr.asp?id=204|title=The U.S. Navy|first=US Navy web|last=staff|date=|website=www.navy.mil|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Navy]] requires a metal casket for intact remains, but full body burial in a suitably weighted shroud is also seen as legal.&lt;ref name="NewEnglandBurialsAtSea.com"/&gt;

The United States is similar to many countries which permit the spreading of cremation ashes within their Exclusive Economic zone: when spreading ashes from a ship which is registered in a different country, the regulations and reporting procedures for the ship's flag state need to be complied with once the vessel is in international waters, that is, outside 12 nautical miles. Ships follow the London convention principles, as opposed to MARPOL regulations, as the ash is intentionally taken on board for discharge at sea, as opposed to ash generated on passage from the ship's incinerators. It should be further considered that on 1 January 2013, MARPOL Annex V came into force, which prevents discharge of a ship's incinerator ash.

[[File:Neil Armstrong burial at sea (201209140008HQ).jpg|thumb|right|The burial at sea of U.S. astronaut [[Neil Armstrong]], performed by the U.S. Navy on {{USS|Philippine Sea|CG-58|6}} in the Atlantic Ocean on September 14, 2012]]

The [[United States Navy]] has performed many burials at sea in its history, with wartime burials as recently as [[World War II]], and peacetime burials still common. Enemy deaths received the same ceremony as Americans or allies. Most other armed forces also perform burials at sea, such as the [[Royal Navy|British Royal Navy]] and the [[Royal Canadian Navy]].

If the deceased died on land or has been returned to shore after death, the remains may be brought aboard either in a [[coffin]] or in an urn after cremation. The ceremony is performed while the ship is deployed, and consequently civilians are not allowed to be present. In the US, people eligible for a free Navy burial at sea are:
* Active-duty members of the uniformed services
* Retirees and honorably discharged [[veteran]]s
* [[Military Sealift Command]] U.S. civilian marine personnel
* Family members of the above

In preparation, the [[officer of the deck]] calls ''All hands bury the dead'', and the ship is stopped (if possible). The ship's flags are lowered to [[half mast]]. The ship's crew, including a firing party, casket bearers and a [[Bugle (instrument)|bugler]], are assembled on the deck. The crew stands at [[parade rest]] at the beginning of the ceremony. The coffin is covered with a [[American flag|flag]], and is carried feet first on deck by the casket bearers. The casket is placed on a stand, with the feet overboard. In case of cremated remains, the urn is brought on deck and placed on a stand.

The ceremony is divided into a [[military rites|military portion]] and a religious portion. The religious part is specific to the religion of the deceased, and may be performed by a [[United States Navy Chaplain Corps|Navy chaplain]], or by the [[commanding officer]] if no chaplain of the appropriate faith is available. A scripture is read and prayers are said.

After the religious ceremony, the firing party is ordered "Firing party, [[present arms (command)|present arms]]". The casket bearers tilt the platform with the casket, so that the casket slides off the platform into the ocean. The flag which was draped over the casket is retained on board. For cremated remains, there is the option to bury the remains using the urn in a similar fashion to the procedure used for caskets. Alternatively, the urn can be opened, and the remains scattered in the wind. In this case, the wind direction has to be taken under consideration before burial to ensure a smooth procedure.

The firing party fires a [[3-volley salute|three volley salute]], the bugler plays [[Taps]], and flowers may also be dropped into the ocean. After the flag is folded, the ceremony ends. The relatives are informed of the time and location of the burial, and given photos and video recordings if available.

==Wartime burial at sea==

In wartime, attempts are made for burial at sea to follow the same procedure as for peacetime burial at sea, although a ship on a combat mission may not have all the necessary resources available. Nowadays, it is usually possible to airlift the remains back to shore, and prepare a burial ceremony on land. However, as recently as the [[Falklands War]], deceased were buried at sea without returning to land. Due to the limited facilities of military ships, this procedure usually does not include a casket, but the body is sewn into a sailcloth with weights, usually rocks or cannonballs. Cremation is usually not possible on a ship. During the Pacific campaign there was at least one instance where a member of an aircrew was buried at sea in his damaged aircraft, which was ceremonially pushed overboard from an [[aircraft carrier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loyceedeen.org/|title=In memory of Loyce Edward Deen USNR WW II, (1921 - 1944) and all who served aboard the USS Essex|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criticalpast.com/video/65675070253_TBF-Avenger-aircraft_USS-Essex_sea-burial_dead-gunner|title=U.S. Navy TBF Avenger gunner from USS Essex is buried at sea with his aircraft during World War II|date=5 November 1944|publisher=Criticalpast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorial services at sea==
If no remains of the deceased are available a memorial service may be held, and flowers may be dropped in the water, often over or near the location of the death.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

{{Main|List of people buried at sea}}
A few notable burials at sea:
* [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] (1540–1596), body in lead coffin off the coast of [[Portobelo, Panama]]
*[[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope]] (1883–1963), prominent admiral of the [[Royal Navy]] during World War II. Buried at sea near [[Portsmouth]].
* [[Christopher Newport]] (1561–1617), body buried in the Indian Ocean
* [[Edward Winslow]] (1595–1655) buried at sea near [[Jamaica]] on 8 May 1655
* Numerous {{RMS|Titanic}} victims (1912), picked up by rescue ships, whose remains were too damaged to preserve or for whom the rescuers lacked sufficient embalming materials, were buried at sea
* Dame [[Edwina Mountbatten]], Countess Mountbatten of Burma (1901–1960), was buried at sea off the coast of [[Portsmouth]], as it was her wish to be buried at sea. 
* [[Mariano Moreno]] (1778–1811), one of the leaders of the Argentine [[May Revolution]]; died on voyage to the [[United Kingdom]], possibly poisoned; his coffin was wrapped in a [[British flag]].

* [[Adolf Eichmann]] (1906–1962), following his execution in [[Israel]], his body was cremated and his ashes scattered at sea over the [[Mediterranean]], in international waters. This was done because Israel did not want such a person buried in its soil, and also did not want a grave elsewhere that might have become a place of pilgrimage for other Nazis.

The '''Cairo Conference''' (codenamed '''Sextant'''&lt;ref name="WSC_Closing the Ring"&gt;{{cite book|last=Churchill|first=Winston Spencer|title=The Second World War: Closing the Ring |year=1951|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston|pages=642}}&lt;/ref&gt;) of November 22–26, 1943, held in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], outlined the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] position against [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] during [[World War II]] and made decisions about postwar [[Asia]].

==Description==
The meeting was attended by [[President of the United States]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]], [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Winston Churchill]], and Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]] of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leader [[Joseph Stalin]] did not attend the conference because his meeting with Chiang could have caused friction between the [[Soviet Union]] and Japan. (The [[Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact]] of 1941 was a five-year agreement of neutrality between the two nations; in 1943 the Soviet Union was not at war with Japan, whereas China, the U.K. and the U.S. were.)

The Cairo meeting was held at a residence of the American Ambassador to Egypt, [[Alexander Comstock Kirk|Alexander Kirk]], near [[Giza Necropolis|the Pyramids]].&lt;ref&gt;''Life'': [https://books.google.com/books?id=1UkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA80&amp; Noel F. Busch, "Alexander Kirk," August 13, 1945], accessed January 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days later Stalin met with Roosevelt and Churchill in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]] for the [[Tehran Conference]].

The Americans not wanting the French to return to Indochina, had offered Chiang Kai-Shek entire control of French Indochina, but Chiang Kai-Shek publicly declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gale.com/binaries/content/assets/gale-us-en/primary-sources/archives-unbound/primary-sources_archives-unbound_indochina-france-and-the-viet-minh-war-1945-1954_-records-of-the-u.s.-state-department-part-1_-1945-1949.pdf|title=Indochina, France, and the Viet Minh War, 1945-1954: Records of the U.S. State Department, Part 1: 1945-1949|accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1943 Cairo Declaration|Cairo Declaration]] was issued on 27 November 1943 and released in a ''Cairo Communiqué'' through radio on 1 December 1943,&lt;ref name="cairo_communique"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ndl.go.jp/constitution/e/shiryo/01/002_46shoshi.html|publisher=Japan National Diet Library|title=Cairo Communique, December 1, 1943|date=December 1, 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating the Allies' intentions to continue deploying military force until Japan's [[unconditional surrender]]. The main clauses of the Cairo Declaration are that the three great allies are fighting this war to restrain and punish the aggression of Japan, they covet no gain for themselves and won't involve themselves in territorial expansion wars after the conflict, "Japan be stripped of all the islands in the Pacific which she has seized or occupied since the beginning of the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1914", "all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, including [[Manchuria]], [[Taiwan|Formosa]], and the [[Penghu|Pescadores]], shall be restored to the Republic of China", Japan will also be expelled from all other territories which she has taken by violence and greed and that "in due course [[Korea]] shall become free and independent".

[[File:William Bligh, 1775.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Bounty}}'s commander Lieutenant [[William Bligh]], as painted by [[John Webber]] in 1775]]
The '''complement''' of {{HMS|Bounty}}, the [[Royal Navy]] ship on which [[Mutiny on the Bounty|a historic mutiny]] occurred in the south Pacific on 28 April 1789, comprised 46 men on its departure from England in December 1787 and 44 at the time of the mutiny, including her commander Lieutenant [[William Bligh]].&lt;ref name=crewlist/&gt; All but two of those aboard were Royal Navy personnel; the exceptions were two civilian botanists engaged to supervise the [[breadfruit]] plants ''Bounty'' was tasked to take from [[Tahiti]] to the West Indies.{{sfn|McKinney|1999|pp=164–166}} Of the 44 aboard at the time of the mutiny, 19 (including Bligh) were set adrift in the ship's launch, while 25, a mixture of mutineers and detainees, remained on board under [[Fletcher Christian]].&lt;ref name=crewlist/&gt; Bligh led his loyalists {{convert|3500|nmi}} to safety in the open boat, and ultimately back to England.{{sfn|Hough|1972|pp=165–189, 215}} The mutineers divided—most settled on Tahiti, where they were captured by {{HMS|Pandora}} in 1791 and returned to England for trial, while Christian and eight others evaded discovery on [[Pitcairn Island]].{{sfn|Hough|1972|pp=243–246}}

The [[Admiralty]] rated ''Bounty'' as a [[Cutter (boat)#Naval cutter|cutter]], the smallest category of warship—this meant that she was commanded not by a [[Captain (Royal Navy)|captain]] but by a [[Lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]], with no other [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned officer]]s aboard, and without the usual detachment of [[Royal Marines]] that ships' commanders could use to enforce their authority.{{sfn|Alexander|2003|pp=49, 71}} Directly beneath Bligh in the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] were his [[warrant officer]]s, appointed by the [[Navy Board]] and headed by the sailing master [[John Fryer (Royal Navy officer)|John Fryer]].{{sfn|McKinney|1999|pp=164–166}} The other warrant officers were the [[boatswain]], the [[Ship's doctor|surgeon]], the carpenter, and the gunner.{{sfn|Alexander|2003|p=51}}  Two [[master's mate]]s and two [[midshipmen]] were rated as petty officers; to these  were added several honorary  midshipmen—so-called "[[young gentlemen]]" who aspired to naval careers. They signed on the ship's roster as able seamen, but were quartered with the midshipmen and treated on equal terms with them.{{sfn|Hough|1972|p=74}}

Most on ''Bounty'' were chosen by Bligh, or were recommended to him. However, a draft list of the crew before the voyage includes several who did not sail, including two [[Impressment|pressed men]] who are thought to have deserted.{{sfn|Alexander|2003|p=54}} Of the eventual crew William Peckover, the gunner, and Joseph Coleman, the armourer, had been with Bligh when he was Captain [[James Cook]]'s sailing master on {{HMS|Resolution|1771|6}} during the explorer's [[Third voyage of James Cook|third voyage]] (1776–80).{{sfn|Alexander|2003|p=56}} Several others had sailed under Bligh more recently, including Christian, who had twice voyaged with Bligh to the West Indies on the merchantman ''Britannia''. The two had formed a master-pupil relationship through which Christian had become a highly skilled navigator;{{sfn|Hough|1972|pp=75–76}} Bligh gave him one of the master's mate's berths on ''Bounty'',{{sfn|Hough|1972|pp=75–76}} and in March 1788 promoted him to the rank of Acting Lieutenant, effectively making Christian second-in-command.{{sfn|Alexander|2003|pp=86–87}} Another of the young gentlemen recommended to Bligh was 15-year-old [[Peter Heywood]], a [[Manx people|Manxman]] and a distant relation of Christian's.{{sfn|Alexander|2003|pp=63–65}} His recommendation came from Bligh's father-in-law, who was a Heywood family friend.{{sfn|Hough|1972|p=74}}

The two botanists, or "gardeners", were chosen by [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]], the president of the [[Royal Society]] and the expedition's chief promoter. The chief botanist, [[David Nelson (botanical collector)|David Nelson]], was another veteran of Cook's third voyage and had learned some of the Tahitians' language.{{sfn|Hough|1972|pp=67–68}} Nelson's assistant, William Brown, was a former midshipman who had seen naval action against the French.{{sfn|Alexander|2003|p=56}} Banks   also helped to secure the midshipmen's berths for two of his protégés, [[Thomas Hayward (Royal Navy officer)|Thomas Hayward]] and [[John Hallett]].{{sfn|Alexander|2003|p=68}} Overall, ''Bounty'''s crew was relatively youthful, the majority being under 30.{{sfn|McKinney|1999|p=23}} At the time of departure Bligh was 33 years old and Fryer a year older. Among the older crew members were the gunner, William Peckover, who had sailed on all three of Cook's voyages, and Lawrence Lebogue, formerly sailmaker on the ''Britannia''. The youngest aboard were Hallett and Heywood, who were both 15 when they left England.{{sfn|McKinney|1999|pp=17–23, 164–166}}

Is it clinically important? |journal=Chest |volume=96 |issue=2 |pages=227–8 |date=August 1989 |pmid=2787728 |doi= 10.1378/chest.96.2.227}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is caused when there is narrowing of the [[coronary arteries]] and a coronary vasodilator&lt;ref name="pmid12135942"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Werner GS, Figulla HR |title=Direct assessment of coronary steal and associated changes of collateral hemodynamics in chronic total coronary occlusions |journal=Circulation |volume=106 |issue=4 |pages=435–40 |date=July 2002 |pmid=12135942 |doi= 10.1161/01.CIR.0000022848.92729.33|last2=Figulla }}&lt;/ref&gt; is used – "stealing" blood away from those parts of the heart.  This happens as a result of the narrowed coronary arteries being always maximally dilated to compensate for the decreased upstream blood supply. Thus, dilating the resistance vessels in the coronary circulation causes blood to be shunted away from the coronary vessels supplying the [[ischemic zone]]s, creating more [[ischemia]].

==Causative agents==
It is associated with [[dipyridamole]]. Hence, dipyridamole is a pharmacological success diagnostically, but a therapeutic failure because of the coronary steal phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;''Essentials of Medical Pharmacology, 5th Edition''&lt;/ref&gt;

Coronary steal is also the mechanism in most drug-based [[cardiac stress test]]s; When a patient is incapable of doing physical activity they are given a vasodilator that produces a "cardiac steal syndrome" as a diagnostic procedure. The test result is positive if the patient's symptoms reappear or if ECG alterations are seen.

It is also associated with the administration of Isoflurane, which is an inhaled anesthetic. Hydralazine can potentially cause this condition as well, as it is a direct arteriolar vasodilator.

It has been associated with [[nitroprusside]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-8247-2920-X"&gt;{{cite book |author1=David L. Hoyt |author2=Wilson, William J. |author3=Grande, Christopher M. |title=Trauma |publisher=Informa Healthcare |location= |year=2007 |pages=304  |isbn=0-8247-2920-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other causes===
Coronary arteriovenous fistula between coronary artery and another cardiac chamber, like, the coronary sinus, right atrium, or right ventricle  may cause steal syndrome under conditions like myocardial infarction and possible angina or ventricular arrhythmias, if the shunt is large in magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;''Harrisson's Principles of Internal Medicine, 17th Edition''&lt;/ref&gt;

It can also be associated with new patterns of blood vessel growth.&lt;ref name="pmid15958345"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aziz S, Stables RH |title=Coronary steal induced by angiogenesis following bypass surgery |journal=Heart |volume=91 |issue=7 |pages=863 |date=July 2005 |pmid=15958345 |pmc=1768979 |doi=10.1136/hrt.2004.043471|last2=Stables }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|Corrupt Practices in UK election law|other uses|Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act}}
{{PoliticsUK}}
'''Corrupt practices''' in [[England|English]] [[election law]] includes [[bribery]], [[treating]], undue influence, [[personation]], and aiding, abetting, counselling and procuring personation.

== English election law ==
Corrupt practices were created in [[English law|United Kingdom common law]] through the [[Corrupt Practices Prevention Act 1854]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Corrupt Practices|volume=7|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; although statutes for the prevention of specific offences had been passed in 1416, 1695,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Corrupt Practices Act 1695]]&lt;/ref&gt; 1809, 1827, 1829, and 1842. The Act was modified, amended or extended by later legislation, for example the [[Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act 1883]].

=== Offences ===

Corrupt practices are now defined by the [[Representation of the People Act 1983]] and include:&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG|title=Representation of the People Act 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[personation]], defined as pretending to be another person (whether living, dead or fictitious) in order to vote in their name&lt;ref&gt;Section 60&lt;/ref&gt;
* applying for a [[postal vote]] in the name of another person, or diverting the delivery of a postal vote form&lt;ref&gt;Section 62A&lt;/ref&gt;
* giving false information in the papers nominating a [[candidate]]&lt;ref&gt;Section 65A&lt;/ref&gt;
* incurring unlawful expenses in connection with an election campaign,&lt;ref&gt;Section 75&lt;/ref&gt; or making a false declaration regarding election expenses&lt;ref&gt;Section 82&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[bribery|bribing]] voters to vote or not to vote (with money, or other valuable items)&lt;ref&gt;Section 113&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[treating]], defined as giving or offering food, drink or entertainment to a voter in order to influence their vote&lt;ref&gt;Section 114&lt;/ref&gt;
* exerting undue influence on a voter through threats (including threats of "spiritual injury" as well as physical injury, damage or harm), whether to influence their vote or as a result of their voting&lt;ref&gt;Section 115&lt;/ref&gt;

The result of an election can be challenged on the grounds that corrupt practices have taken place by the presentation of an [[election petition]] to the courts within the period of 21 days after the date of the election.&lt;ref&gt;Sections 120 to 135A&lt;/ref&gt; If the [[election court]] which hears the petition determines that a corrupt practice has taken place, it issues a report finding the relevant individuals guilty.&lt;ref&gt;Sections 139 to 145&lt;/ref&gt; A candidate may be reported as personally guilty if they were directly involved with the corrupt practice, or if it was committed with their knowledge or consent. A candidate may also be reported as "guilty by his agents" where his [[election agent]] or those working on his campaign commit corrupt practices.&lt;ref&gt;Section 158&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Punishment ===

The punishments for corrupt practices fall into two broad categories: non-criminal sanctions, and criminal punishments. The reporting, by an election court, of a person as guilty of a corrupt practice renders them immediately liable to the non-criminal sanctions, and they may additionally be prosecuted and subjected to the criminal punishments (but if they are prosecuted and acquitted, then the non-criminal sanctions are revoked&lt;ref&gt;Section 174(1))&lt;/ref&gt;). Where the election was not challenged by a petition at the time, but suspected corrupt practices are subsequently identified, a criminal prosecution can be instigated (but only within one year of the election concerned&lt;ref&gt;Section 176&lt;/ref&gt;), and anyone found guilty is subject to both criminal punishment and the non-criminal sanctions.

==== Non-criminal sanctions ====

The successful election of a candidate found guilty (whether personally or by his agents) of a corrupt practice is void,&lt;ref&gt;Section 159&lt;/ref&gt; and anyone found personally guilty of a corrupt practice is prohibited from holding any elected office (and for some offences, also from voting in any election) for a period of five years.&lt;ref&gt;Section 160&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, if the offender is a [[solicitor]], [[barrister]], [[advocate]] or member of another regulated profession (such as a [[medical doctor]]) then the offence is also reported to the appropriate regulatory body which is empowered to deal with it as if it were professional misconduct, and thus could result in [[suspension (punishment)|suspension]] or being [[struck off]] their professional register.&lt;ref&gt;Section 162&lt;/ref&gt; If an election court finds that someone with a [[Licensing laws of the United Kingdom|licence for the sale of alcohol]] allows bribery or treating to take place on his premises, they can also report the matter to the licensing authority which may consider it grounds to refuse to renew the licence.&lt;ref&gt;Section 163&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Criminal punishment ====

Conviction of a corrupt practice in the criminal courts can result in [[imprisonment]] for up to two years (depending on the offence) or an unlimited fine.&lt;ref&gt;Section 168&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recent cases ===

One of the most high-profile cases of corrupt practices in recent years was that of the local government elections in the [[Bordesley Green]] and [[Aston]] wards of [[Birmingham]] in June 2004. The [[election court]], presided over by [[Richard Mawrey]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], found that there had been extensive abuse of the [[postal vote]] system, resulting in the outcome of the election being changed. He accordingly reported that extensive corrupt practices had been committed, found six individuals personally guilty (although one was subsequently cleared by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2005/647.html|title=Afzal, R (on the application of) v Election Court &amp; Ors 2005 EWCA Civ 647|publisher=British and Irish Legal Information Institute|date=26 May 2005|accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and voided the elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/2384.htm|title=Judgment in the matters of Local Government elections for the Bordesley Green and Aston Wards of the Birmingham City Council both held on 10th June 2004|publisher=HM Courts Service|date=4 April 2005|accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 General Election]], [[Fiona Jones]], who had been elected as [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Newark (UK Parliament constituency)|Newark]], and her [[election agent]] were initially tried and convicted of making false declaration regarding election expenses. However, the conviction was overturned on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1999/1094.html|title=R v Fiona Jones and Desmond Whicher 1999 EWCA Crim 1094|publisher=British and Irish Legal Information Institute|date=22 April 1999|accessdate=1 May 2010}} See also {{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/1999/377.html|title=HM Attorney General (On behalf of the Speaker and Authorities of the House of Commons) v Jones 1999 EWHC Admin 377|publisher=British and Irish Legal Information Institute|date=30 April 1999|accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dance card''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mish|first1=Frederick|title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary|date=2003|publisher=Merriam Webster|isbn=978-0-87779-808-8|page=315|edition=11th}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''programme du bal'' (also known by its [[German language|German-language]] name, ''Tanzkarte'') is used by a woman to record the names of the gentlemen with whom she intends to dance each successive dance at a formal [[ballroom dancing|ball]].

They appear to have originated in the 18th century, but their use first became widespread in 19th century [[Vienna]], especially at the massive balls during [[Fasching]] before [[Lent]].  According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the first published use of the term in English was in 1892.
[[File:Dance card00.jpg|thumb|Dance engagements card for 11 January 1887, showing a list of all the dances for the evening - valse, polka, lancers and quadrille; opposite each dance is a space to record the name of the partner for that dance. After the event the card was probably kept as a souvenir of the evening]]

An actual dance card is typically a booklet with a decorative cover, listing dance titles, [[composers]], and the person with whom the woman intended to dance. Typically, it would have a cover indicating the sponsoring organization of the ball and a decorative cord by which it could be attached to a lady's wrist or [[ball gown]]. From the 19th century until [[World War I]], dance cards for the elite of [[Austria-Hungary]] were often very elaborate, with some even incorporating [[precious metal]]s and [[Jewellery|jewel]]s.  

In modern times the expression "dance card" is often used [[metaphor]]ically, as when someone says "pencil me into your dance card," meaning "find some time to spend with me".  Conversely, someone's "dance card is full" implies that even though they may be interested, they have no time for another person.

[[U.S. Air Force]] [[aircrew]]s in general, and those involved in flight tests in particular, use the term to describe the first card in a "deck" of flight or test maneuver cards. The "dance card" contains administrative data about the mission, aircraft, and aircrew as well as a list of the maneuvers to be flown. The card serves as a table of contents for the mission and a quick reference for the aircrew's use during the flight.

'''Gai Jatra''', (''gāi'' means cow and ''jātrā'' means festival in [[Nepali language|Nepali]]: गाई जात्रा, and [[Nepal Bhasa]]: सा पारु) is a festival celebrated in [[Nepal]], mainly in [[Kathmandu valley]] by the [[Newar]] community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nepalhomepage.com/society/festivals/gaijatra.html] Nepal Home Page&lt;/ref&gt;
The festival commemorates the death of people during the year and is generally celebrated in the month of [Bhadra (Hindu calendar)|Bhadra] )August–September).  The date is set according to the lunar [[Nepal Era]] calendar: it falls on the first day of the dark fortnight of the month of [Gunla].

The Festival of Cows is one of the most popular festivals of Nepal. It is celebrated to diminish the sadness from the death of family members.  During the festival, cows are marched in the streets. People also distribute food to others. 

* The whole complex of Gai Jatra festival has its roots in the ancient ages when people feared and worshiped [[Yamaraj]], the god of death. However, the ironic sessions synonymous with the Gai Jatra festival entered the tradition in the medieval period of Nepal during the reign of the [[Malla (Nepal)|Malla]] Kings. Hence, the present form of Gaijatra is a happy blending of antiquity and the medieval era.
* According to the traditions since time immemorial, every family who has lost one relative during the past year must participate in a procession through the streets of Kathmandu leading a cow. If a cow is unavailable then a young boy dressed as a cow is considered a fair substitute.
* In Hinduism, a cow is regarded the most venerated among all the domestic animals. It is believed that the cow, revered as a holy animal by [[Hindu]]s, will help the deceased relative's journey to heaven.
* According to the historical evidence, when King Pratap Malla lost his son, his wife, the queen, remained grief-stricken. The king was very sad to see the condition of his beloved queen. The king, in spite of several efforts, could not lessen the grief of his wife. To show his wife that death is a natural part of life, he called on people for a carnival if someone has died in their family. Many people came which showed the queen that it is not only her son had died somebody has died in every family in this festival.

==Gai Jatra in different cities==

===Kathmandu=== 

Kathmandu is considered to be the main source of this festival as the king who started this festival was from this city. After the show presented to the queen was a success, it became an annual program to present the queen with this festival. As time passed on and as the kings and the queens passed on the festival has been passed on from generation to generation. In main Kathmandu, people celebrate it with much happiness and many programs than those on [[Nepal|Patan]]. The procession goes around the city to different parts of the suburbs and the inner urban areas to present the devotion to their loved ones. The people involved in this profession get small packets with fruits, sweets, oats and other food items to help them on their tour around the city, by many people watching the festival and by their loved ones.

===Patan===

Patan has a similar kind of following for this festival like that with Kathmandu but has less involvement of people than that on Kathmandu. People in Lalitpur have another festival similar to Gaijatra called ''Matayaa'' which is followed by Hindu with much more devotion and much more involvement by the people. The involvements of people in this ''Matayaa'' can be in thousands. Thus for people in Lalitpur, the procession of Gaijatra is less entertained.

===Kirtipur===
Gaijatra is celebrated widely in Kirtipur, particularly in Kirtipur's ancient historical towns Kipu dey:, Panga:, Naga:, Bhajanga: and Yarwocha: (Itagol) and other towns. The people in Kirtipur celebrating have many reasons to celebrate this festival and have a unique way of celebrating this festival. Among the people of Kirtipur it is said that the gates of heaven for the dead are opened in this day, and the procession of Gaijatra will help their beloved to reach the gates of heaven if they march around the city for them. They march around the city of Kirtipur with not dressing up like cows but rather dressed up in different forms of gods and goddesses. People celebrate this festival not only for their dead relatives but also for peace and harmony among the family members and the city itself.
[[File:Gaijatra02.jpg|thumb|People dressed as different deities dancing in procession of Gai Jatra.]]
During this month the farmers of the city finish up their work in the fields and return home to celebrate the ending of the hard and tedious work in the fields. They gather the family members and have a feast of their success. This culture is replicated in this festival in Kirtipur. Men dress up like women and travel around the city. They go from house to house calling up the owners of the house and asking them to come down and join in the feast with them. This helps to create harmony among the neighbors and the city members.
Kirtipur performs many dances with different imitating artists that provide much of an awe and a happiness among the people. Kirtipur is enriched with many beliefs and many stories relating Gaijatra than any other cities of the valley and has a more diverse celebration of this festival.

===Bhaktapur===

Bhaktapur is said to have the most enjoyable and exciting Gai Jatra, as it has its own peculiarities in the ways the festival is celebrated as compared to Lalitpur and Kathmandu. A chariot (known as Taha-Macha) made of bamboo wrapped in cloth, with a photo of the dead person hung at the center, is navigated through a predefined street by the family along with localities. So a long parade of chariots is seen.

The Taha-Macha symbolize dead people and is decorated with their possessions and photograph. The chariot has a framework of bamboo which is wrapped with cotton cloth usually Hakupatasi (a black traditional sari type female cloth) for women and simple sari type cloth for men. The Taha-Machas are brought out from different toles of Bhaktapur, but peculiarly, the Taha-Machas of Lakolachhen are guided by one large one that has the bamboo framework but is covered in straws. This is known as Bhailya Dya: (Bhairab) and is succeeded by Ajima (Bhadrakali) made at Khala (Ajima Dyo:Chhen)

Many local musicians, and a cultural dance called'''Ghinta Ghisi''' follow in the wake of a chariot. Men are also seen wearing women's dress: Hakupatasi. People dress up funnily. There is face painting and masks are common. Children even dress up as Gods and join the parade.

The Ghinta Ghisi dance is celebrated for almost a week, starting from the day of Gaijatra to Krishna Janmashtami. The dance is done in a long queen with two persons in a row hitting each other's sticks. Many cultural shows are performed, and the festival is even participated in by many nearby villages.
All peoples are faint to this day.

[[File:Atomic cloud over Hiroshima - NARA 542192 - Edit.jpg|thumb|275px|The [[mushroom cloud]] over [[Hiroshima]] after the dropping of "[[Little Boy]]" photographed by Bob Caron.]]
Technical Sergeant '''George Robert "Bob" Caron''' (October 31, 1919 – June 3, 1995) was the [[tail gunner]], the only defender of the twelve crewmen, aboard the [[B-29]] ''[[Enola Gay]]'' during the [[Hiroshima and Nagasaki|historic bombing of the Japanese city of Hiroshima]] on 6 August 1945. Facing the rear of the B-29, his vantage point made him the first man to witness the cataclysmic growth of the [[mushroom cloud]] over [[Hiroshima]].

Caron was also the only photographer aboard, and took photographs as the [[mushroom cloud]] ascended. Of the four [[509th Composite Group]] aircraft assigned to the Hiroshima bombing, Caron's camera and two others captured the explosion on film. Immediately before the mission, the 509th's photography officer, Lieutenant Jerome Ossip, asked then Staff Sergeant Caron to carry a handheld [[Fairchild K-20]] camera. After the mission, Ossip developed photos from all the aircraft, but found that the fixed cameras failed to record anything. Film from another handheld was mishandled in developing, making Caron's the only official still photographs of the explosion. 2nd Lt. Russell Gackenback, Navigator aboard then unnamed ''[[Necessary Evil (aircraft)|Necessary Evil]]'', took two still photographs of the cloud about one minute after detonation using his personal AFGA 620 camera. A handheld [[16 mm film]] camera on ''[[The Great Artiste]]'' captured the only known motion film of the explosion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwar2database.com/gallery2/key/Technical+Sergeant+George+R.+Bob+Caron?g2_itemId=406 "Little Boy" Bomb Explodes Over Hiroshima]&lt;/ref&gt;  Caron's photographs of the explosion were printed on millions of leaflets that were dropped over Japan the next day.

Caron graduated from [[Brooklyn Technical High School]] (Brooklyn, New York) in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mphpa.org/classic/COLLECTIONS/CG-JPAP/Pages-2/CGP-JPAP-165.htm The Manhattan Project Heritage Preservation Association, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1995, he published the book ''Fire of a Thousand Suns, The George R. "Bob" Caron Story, Tail Gunner of the Enola Gay'' about his "eye-witness account of the momentous event when the world was catapulted into the Atomic Age, the introduction of atomic capability, the technical development of the B-29, and the events that put him into the tail gun turret of the [[Enola Gay]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://bobcaron.com/ Tailgunner, Enola Gay]&lt;/ref&gt;

:This article is about a newspaper; see [[Emanuel Hatzofe]] for the Israeli sculptor 
'''HaTzofe''' ({{lang-he-n|הצופה}}, ''The Observer'') was a Hebrew language daily newspaper published in [[Israel]]. In April 2007, it was reduced to weekly publication until its closing over a year later.

According to the paper's website, its point of view is [[Zionist]], [[nationalism|nationalist]] and [[Judaism|religious]]. It claimed to be the only daily newspaper of the Israeli [[political right]], with an emphasis on [[Religious Zionist Movement|religious Zionism]]. The newspaper had been associated in its past to the [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] movement as well as being the beacon of [[National Religious Party]].

In the May 2003, [[Shlomo Ben-Tzvi]] purchased the newspaper and in 2004, he purchased the weekly [[Makor Rishon]] as well. On 25 April 2007, ''HaTzofe'' stopped publishing a daily edition, instead becoming a weekly insert in ''Makor Rishon'' which instead began daily operations. It printed its last edition on Friday, 26 December 2008.&lt;ref name=shragai&gt;{{Cite news|last=Shragai|first=Nadav|title=Voice of religious Zionism to stop the presses after 71 years|work=Haaretz|accessdate =26 December 2008|date=25 December 2008|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1049790.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2986">The '''''Hermosa''''' was a [[schooner]] whose 1840 grounding in the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]] led to a controversy between the US and Britain over the 38 slaves who had been on board the ship.

== Facts ==
The ''Hermosa'' was sailing from Richmond, Virginia, to New Orleans, with a cargo of slaves, when it was wrecked in the [[Abaco Islands|Abacos]]. Because Britain had [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|abolished slavery in 1833]], the local government forcibly removed and freed the slaves after the ship docked in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ATq5_6h2AT0C|publisher = ABC-CLIO|date = 1997-01-01|isbn = 9780874368857|language = en|first = Junius P.|last = Rodriguez|page = 340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
The freeing of the ''Hermosa''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s slaves was widely discussed in the United States. The next year, slaves on the ''[[Creole case|Creole]]'' rebelled against the ship's crew, and chose to go to the Bahamas because they had heard about the ''Hermosa.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = New Orleans in the Atlantic World: Between Land and Sea|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LRndAAAAQBAJ|publisher = Routledge|date = 2013-09-13|isbn = 9781317988434|language = en|first = William|last = Boelhower|page = 145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = American Slave Revolts and Conspiracies: A Reference Guide|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MhGFCgAAQBAJ|publisher = ABC-CLIO|date = 2015-09-22|isbn = 9781610696609|language = en|first = Kerry|last = Walters|page = 140}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cases of both ships were discussed in Congress, leading to at least one call for war against Britain if compensation was not made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Facts for the People, showing the relations of the United States Government to Slavery, etc|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vTJcAAAAcAAJ|date = 1847-01-01|language = en|first = Loring|last = Moody|page = 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resolution ==
The owner of the ''Hermosa''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s slaves, [[Lumpkin's jail|Robert Lumpkin]], sought compensation in [[admiralty court]]. The case was dealt with together with claims related to the ''[[Enterprise (slave ship)|Enterprize]]'' and ''Creole'', and the ship's insurers were awarded $16,000 in compensation in 1855.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Creole Affair: The Slave Rebellion that Led the U.S. and Great Britain to the Brink of War|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hmdVBAAAQBAJ|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield|date = 2014-08-14|isbn = 9781442236622|language = en|first = Arthur T.|last = Downey|page = 145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career==
White's career as a [[Neil Diamond]] tribute artist began in 1983 in the Salute to the Superstars show at the now-defunct Mr. F's Beef &amp; Bourbon in Sterling Heights, Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hotts|first=Mitch|title=Jay White brings Neil Diamond show to Andiamo Showroom|url=http://www.macombdaily.com/article/MD/20130409/ENTERTAINMENT01/130409503|accessdate=9 April 2013|newspaper=Macomb Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had performed at the club for five years when a mutual friend sent word to [[Legends in Concert]] producer John Stuart in Las Vegas, NV.

White was offered a seven-week gig at a Reno casino, and it went so well he packed up and moved in 1989 to Vegas, where he did Diamond duty — 50 weeks a year for nine years — in "Legends in Concert" at the [[Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Joe|title=Diamond songs sung true|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/aug/19/diamond-songs-sung-true/|accessdate=Aug 19, 2008|newspaper=Las Vegas Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jay would become the longest running act at Legends, performing in the hotel for almost nine years. White also was the first person to ever perform with Legends as a "living" legend (a musician still alive).

==Plot==
{{Plot|section|date=March 2017}}
Set in the same continuity as ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'', {{nihongo|S-City, M-Prefecture|M県S市|Emu-ken, Esu-shi}} was devastated by the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. In the aftermath, strange structures are known colloquially as the Wall Eyes (壁の目 Kabe no Me) appear all over the town of Morioh (杜王町 Moriō-chō), with the ground beneath them having the strange property of swapping traits of whatever two objects are buried there. When a local college student named Yasuho Hirose finds a mysterious youth buried under one of the Wall Eyes, they set off on an adventure together to try to recover his identity. 

The mystery deepens when the corpse of a man called Yoshikage Kira is found buried next to where he was discovered, whose body is missing several parts. Yashuo leaves the youth under the care of her suitor's father, Norisuke Higashikata IV, who takes him in and gives him the name Josuke while she attempts to figure things out from police reports. They also discover that the Higashikata family is related by marriage to the late Yoshikage Kira. Yasuho finds Yoshikage's mother, Holy Joestar-Kira, who stays in a Morioh hospital due to memory loss caused by an incurable disease. Meanwhile, Kyo Nijimura, Holy's daughter who works as a maid for the Higashikata household, reveals to Josuke that he is a composite of Yoshikage's missing body parts with that of another person, having undergone an equivament exchange from being buried under the Wall Eyes. 

When Josuke later confronts Norisuke about the patriarch's intentions in taking him in, he learns that the Higashikata bloodline is cursed and they need Yoshikage's memories for a cure to prevent them from slowly turning to stone. The core component of this cure is the Rokakaka fruit, which cures people of various ailments when eaten, removes another aspect of themselves in exchange. Jobin Higashikata, the eldest of the family, has been using the family fruit parlour to smuggle these fruits into the country in cooperation with mysterious stone-based beings called Rock Humans. As they research the origin of the fruit further, they meet with several Rock Humans who try to hinder their investigation, while Josuke also discovers the truth of his own existence by meeting Karera Sakunami and later Damo Tamaki, both of whom have ties to his past.

In a series of flashbacks, Josuke is revealed to be a man called Josefumi Kujo, fused with the parts of Yoshikage Kira that were not present when his corpse was found. Josefumi first met Yoshikage in 1997 when his mother Holy saved the boy's life after he was left to drown. Twelve years later, Yoshikage requests Josefumi's help in stealing a Rokakaka branch from the Rock Humans, and grafting it onto another tree so they can use the fruit to cure Holy of her mysterious disease. The Rock Humans finally enact revenge for this in 2011, with Yoshikage fatally wounded as Josefumi attempts to save his life. But as Josefumi feeds Kira their last Rokakaka Fruit, they are buried alive during the Tōhoku earthquake under the ground on which Wall Eyes emerged: the same area of land where Yasuho later found Josuke.

Josuke resolves to use the Rokakaka fruit to cure Holy's illness, while the Higashikata family wants to harvest it for their own goals. As Josuke starts searching for the grafted branches Josefumi and Yoshikage left behind, he meets Rai Mamezuku, a plant appraiser, while also encountering more Rock Humans who wish to stop him, working on behalf of Jobin. Josuke intentions clash with Jobin's when the Rock Humans' superior Poor Tom gets involved, culminating in the entire Higashikata orchard being set on fire. In the confusion of the fight, Poor Tom is killed by assassins disguised as ambulance drivers, and Rai and Josuke mistakenly believe them to have taken the Rokakaka branch. In reality, Jobin used his son's Stand to mislead them. 

By chance, Yasuho and Jobin's wife Mitsuba happen to be in the hospital where the ambulance went for unrelated illnesses. Yasuho notices Mitsuba in a wheelchair, with her feet turned to stone. She spots the doctor's name on an office sign and uses her Stand to research him, revealing that he is one of the two assailants that killed Poor Tom. Yasuho decides to interrogate Mitsuba about her doctor, Wu Tomoki. However, Mitsuba acts entirely ignorant, revealing that nothing's wrong with her; she doesn't even remember the wheelchair she was on. They suddenly spot two unknown shards on one the empty stools, only for Yasuho to notice that the wheelchair, dismembered and crushed, is hidden in a drawer. As she tries to call Josuke, the two shards appear rubbing against each other on her phone, emit a sound that stuns her as the shards enter her ear. Mitsuba, seemingly under Wu's control, drags her into the office and takes away her phone.

==Production==
[[File:Hirohiko Araki 2013 - cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=.75|The series is created by [[Hirohiko Araki]].|alt=A 2013 photo of Hirohiko Araki.]]
In the first volume, Araki described the story of ''JoJolion'' as being the solving of a {{nihongo|"curse"|呪い|noroi}}. Curses, he goes on, are the sins of the ancestors and this makes people {{nihongo|"unclean"|穢れ|[[kegare]]}}, and if this curse continues it will only turn into {{nihongo|"resentment"|恨み|urami}}. Another theme is that from birth we see things as black and white, but this produces a {{nihongo|"friction"|摩擦|masatsu}} from what humanity really experiences. From these, the "curse" is lifted, this being the goal of the story.

{{Day}}

This day is the midpoint of a [[common year]] because there are 182 days before and 182 days after it in common years, and 183 before and 182 after in leap years. The exact time of the middle of the year is at [[noon]]. In countries that use [[summer time]] the actual exact time of the midpoint in a common year is at 1:00 p.m, or 11:00 a.m for countries in the southern hemisphere; this is when 182 days and 12 hours have elapsed and there are 182 days and 12 hours remaining. In a leap year in those countries, the midpoint occurs at 1:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. on July 2, or 11:00pm on July 1 in the southern hemisphere. This is due to summer time having advanced the time by one hour. It falls on the same day of the week as [[New Year's Day]] in common years.

==History==
The city was founded over a millennium ago and was the capital of the [[Drevlyans]], an ancient Slavic tribe that was later incorporated into [[Kievan Rus′]]. The name may be derived from the word ''korost'' 'brushwood, bushes, shrubbery'; the form ''Iskorosten''' sometimes found in early sources is probably based on the common repetition of prepositions in [[Old East Slavic]]: ''iz grada iz''... 'from the city from...'.&lt;ref&gt;E.M. Pospelov, ''Geograficheskie nazvaniya mira'' (Moscow: Russkie slovari, 1998), p. 216. The earliest references to the town, from the mid-tenth century, are на Коростень град [na Korosten' grad] 'to Korosten city,' Из града ис Коростеня [iz grada is Korostenya] 'from the city [from] Korosten,' and на Изкоростень град [na Izkorosten' grad] 'to Izkorosten city.'&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Korosten was occupied by the [[Wehrmacht|German Army]] from August 7, 1941 to December 28, 1943 (it was briefly captured by [[Red Army]] forces during the [[Battle of Kiev (1943)|Kiev offensive]] on November 17, 1943, but they had to retreat after a strong German counterattack). The city was destroyed during the war.

After [[Chernobyl disaster|the nuclear incident in Chernobyl, which is around 90 kilometers away, in May 1986]], the city was declared a zone of voluntary evacuation, as it had suffered considerable fallout.

== Economy ==
[[Korosten Industrial Park]] (KIP) is an industrial zone within the city. Total area — 246 hectares (0.94  sq mi). Conceptual design of the park was developed by Czech design bureau DHV. The project envisages the creation of the territory of the KIP high-tech enterprises, enterprises of light and medium industrial production - the assembly, integration, surface processing, light engineering and electrical industries.

The project is designed for 10 years and is divided into three phases:
* Conduct communications: roads, railway, electricity, water supply, sanitation; construction and commissioning of the plant manufacturing [[medium-density fibreboard]] (MDF) boards;
* Construction and commissioning of  small and medium industrial enterprises (perspective)
* Construction and development of logistic center (perspective)

By October 2010 all communications are already conducted. Construction of a plant  manufacturing MDF boards is almost complete. This plant will become the first manufacturer of MDF boards in Ukraine.

== Potato pancakes festival ==
[[File:Пам'ятник Деруну в місті Коростені на Житомирщині.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] monument to ''Derun'' in town Korosten]]

Annually on the third Saturday of September in the city park International [[potato pancakes]] ({{lang-uk|деруни}}, [[Romanization of Ukrainian|translit.]] ''deruni’'') festival is held.

During the festival, competitions in “[[potato pancakes]] [[triathlon]]” is held. Triathlon includes such contests:

* "[[Potato pancakes]] [[powerlifting]]" - squat with two heavy jugs full of pancakes;
* Throwing [[potato pancakes]] in a bowl with [[sour cream]] with 5 meters (16.4&amp;nbsp;ft);
* Throwing [[potato pancakes]] to the competitor with 5 meters (16.4&amp;nbsp;ft).

At the festival works a potato pancakes school :experienced cooks will teach everyone to cook these pancakes.

However, the main intrigue of the festival is the competition for the tastiest pancake. Jury determines the winner. For a few [[hryvnia]]s each taster can get a patent and thus become a member of the jury.

Various competitions, exhibitions, tasting traditional [[Polesia]] beverages, exhibits, performances by [[folk music]] ensembles are usually conducted.

September 25, 2010 the festival was held for the third time.

'''Leander William Tomarkin''' (13 December 1895 – 1967) was a Swiss [[impostor]] who claimed to possess a doctorate in medicine, as well as to have invented a miracle medicine for the cure of [[typhus]], [[tuberculosis]], [[meningitis]], and [[malaria]]. He ascended to become the personal physician of [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel]], king of Italy, and he convinced [[Albert Einstein]] to become patron of a conference organised by him.

==Early life==

Leander Tomarkin was born on 13 December 1895 in [[Zollikon]], Switzerland. A doctor's son, he was the black sheep of the family, obtaining bad results at school and dropping a chemistry degree at college. He also soon developed a reputation of dishonesty. He did not take up regular employment but spent his time in his father's laboratory, hoping to invent something.&lt;ref name="Dreist"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://einestages.spiegel.de/s/tb/29653/hochstapler-leander-tomarkin-der-erfinder-des-antimicrobum.html|title=Doktor Dreist|trans-title=Doctor Brazen|last=von Lüpke|first=Marc|date=1 November 2013|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomarkin rose to fame when he offered to cure [[Pope Benedict XV]]{{'s}} [[pneumonia]] in January 1922. The Pope died without Tomarkin being allowed to treat him but reporters subsequently picked up the story and enabled the progress of Tomarkin's medical career with publicising his ''Antimicrobum tomarkin'' medicine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|title=Ounces of Prevention
|date=16 November 1923
|work=[[The Harvard Crimson]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose active ingredient he named ''Aminoortobenzoilsulfoisoamiloidrocupronucleinforminsodico''.&lt;ref name="Dreist"/&gt; The Antimicrobum was to reduce pneumonia mortality from about one third to 2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|page=17
|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tomarkin was allowed to treat a cousin of [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]], and the cousin recovered. As a result the king named Tomarkin the personal physician of the family. A clinical test at the [[Santo Spirito, Rome|Santo Spirito]] hospital in Rome was also successful, later attributed to the better care for test patient and the relatively early stage of pneumonia that the patients were in.&lt;ref name="Dreist"/&gt;

==Tomarkin-Foundation Chemistry Research==

In May 1924 Tomarkin emigrated to the United States, and three years later founded Tomarkin-Foundation Chemistry Research. At this research centre he developed ''Catalysan'' and ''Disulphamin'', claiming that these medicines bring about mood changes and treat sickness in that way. The Tomarkin Foundation soon spread to Europe. Its dependency in [[Locarno]] started to organise conferences between 1930 and 1938. These conferences were set beautifully and had rich side programs and thus attracted prominent people such as surgeon [[Ferdinand Sauerbruch]]. In 1931 [[Albert Einstein]] assumed the honorary presidency of the conference. Einstein only stayed in that position for one year, after a former landlady of Tomarkin contacted him to help retrieve debts.&lt;ref name="Dreist"/&gt;

At the onset of [[World War II]] Tomarkin again emigrated to the US, due to his [[Jew]]ish ancestry. With the development of industrially manufactured [[antibiotics]] in 1939 his medical invention became obsolete. He ventured into other areas, trying to invent waterproof paint and [[synthetic diamond]]s but was unsuccessful with both. Tomarkin died in 1967.&lt;ref name="Dreist"/&gt;

'''Assassinations''' have formed a major plot element in various works of fiction. This article provides a list of fictional stories in which assassination features as an important plot element.  Passing mentions are omitted.
 
Assassination can be regarded as the murder of a ''prominent'' person for a motive which is broadly public and political rather than merely personal or financial.&lt;ref&gt;
Murders within families are often termed assassinations if the family members are very prominent. This would be true of Roman Empire poisonings, or the 2001 [[Nepalese royal massacre|slaughter of the royal family in Nepal]]. The murder of the well-known actor [[Phil Hartman]] by his wife in 1998 does not qualify.
&lt;br /&gt;
Is the 1978 murder of actor [[Bob Crane]] assassination? No. Is the 1987 murder of singer [[Peter Tosh]] by robbers assassination? If the motive is extortion, no. If an author writes a novel proposing a broad conspiracy, then yes. Is the 1948 death of actor [[Solomon Mikhoels]] assassination? Yes. It was orchestrated by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]].
&lt;br /&gt;
King [[Alex I of England|Charles I]]? No. Executed publicly, after a trial. Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]? Yes. Executed secretly, with his children, without a trial.
&lt;br /&gt;
There will always be a problem with a precise definition and applying that definition to specific cases.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Assassinations in fiction have attracted scholarly attention.  In ''Assassinations and Murder in Modern Italy: Transformations in Society and Culture'', as well as analyzing Italian assassinations in their historical and cultural contexts, Stephen Gundle and Lucia Rinaldi explore the films, plays, other works of fiction, and art that the act of assassination has inspired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palgrave-usa.com/catalog/product.aspx?isbn=1403983917 ''Assassinations and Murder in Modern Italy'']: ''Transformations in Society and Culture'', edited by Stephen Gundle and Lucia Rinaldi (Palgrave Macmillan, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nick Cullather]] has discussed "The Movie Version" of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Cullather, "History, Conspiracy, and the Kennedy Assassination", ''Retrieving the American Past'', ed. Marc Horger (New York: Pearson Custom Publishing, 2005), pp. 301–30&lt;/ref&gt;

This list prefers to highlight less familiar cultural artifacts, while trying not to itemize every [[Ian Fleming]] or [[Agatha Christie]] title, or every [[Mafia]] film. The historical–historically based or historically inspired–takes precedence over the purely fictional and sensational.

Introductory notes:

This section does not indicate the country of origin for a film which is in English. (Far too many countries produce films in English, either by themselves, or in complex co-production arrangements which are '''irrelevant''' to the subject matter of this article.)

When the nationality of a film is indicated, that is primarily about the '''language''' of the film. In cases where a country has multiple official languages, or languages in common use, then the film's language is noted in parentheses. French Canadian films represent an exception (since the editor of this section is a Canadian). (Presumably, at some point, there could be British (Welsh) or South African (Afrikaans) films listed here, but in both of these cases, the nationality is not indicated now.)

The other reason to note a film's nationality is to provide a context for the film's description. So a "President" in a Polish film description implies a Polish President. In the general English-speaking context, a "President" is assumed to be American, rather than Irish or South African and so forth, but that is usually clarified here by using "US President" explicitly.

This section assumes an intelligent readership that does not require links to define major world cities (no Moscow or New Delhi, much less [[Paris, France]]), or the states and provinces of the USA, Canada, and Australia. Indian states, alas, are not so familiar to anglophones outside the subcontinent, so this section will use [[Himachal Pradesh]]. British and Irish counties, in spite of their antiquity in many cases, are also not immediately familiar to many, so this section will use [[Co. Durham]] and [[Co. Donegal]] when needed.

If there is a link to a "novel", then it is to an actual novel, and not merely the definition of the word "novel". Links in this section should always be consequential.
--&gt;
The list is organized chronologically by year of release, rather than year of production.&lt;br /&gt;
Within each year, films based on genuine historical events are listed first, followed by any purely fictional entries.
&lt;!--
  -- Previously, this list distinguished real from imaginary by having links to the years
  -- of the actual historical events.
  -- Links to years have now generally been suppressed in English Wikipedia.

'''Lumous Gothic Festival''' (more commonly known as '''Lumous''') is the largest festival dedicated to the [[goth subculture]] in [[Finland]] and the [[the world's most northern|northernmost]] Gothic festival in the world. The four-day event is organised every summer in [[Tampere]] in late June or early July. While the primary focus is on music, covering [[musical genre]]s such as [[gothic rock]], [[deathrock]], [[Industrial music|industrial]], [[Electronic body music|EBM]] and [[neofolk]], other cultural and arts events have also been organised as part of the festival. Lumous Festival consists mainly of club nights organised in bars and clubs in the centre of Tampere, and also includes a cruise dubbed ''die dunkle Seereise'' on the lake [[Lake Pyhäjärvi|Pyhäjärvi]].

Lumous is organised yearly by Lumous Gothic RY, and its history dates back to 2001 when a handful of Tampere club nights decided to join forces and organise a three-day event called '''Extreme Gothic Weekend''' with performances from [[Two Witches]], Nik, The Candles Burning Blue and Viola.&lt;ref name=DarkPlanet&gt;{{Cite web | title =Lumous Gothic Festival | work =Encyklopedia | publisher =DarkPlanet.pl | date =6 March 2007 | url =http://www.darkplanet.pl/Lumous-Gothic-Festival-2748.html | accessdate =2010-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the name of the event was changed in 2002 to the current Lumous Gothic Festival,&lt;ref name=DarkPlanet/&gt; the festival has gained popularity within Finland and beyond, and has also expanded to a four-day event. Previous years have seen international acts such as [[Zombina and the Skeletones]], [[Das Ich]], [[Haujobb]], [[Pro-jekt]] and [[Killing Miranda]] play at Lumous, along with local bands such as [[Two Witches]], [[Masquerade (Finnish band)|Masquerade]], [[Virgin in Veil]] and [[Suruaika]].

'''Mary Ann Todd Lincoln''' (December 13, 1818&amp;nbsp;– July 16, 1882) was the wife of the 16th [[President of the United States]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], and as such the [[First Lady of the United States]] from 1861 to 1865.  She dropped the name Ann after her younger sister, Ann Todd (Clark), was born, and did not use the name Todd after marrying.

Mary was a member of a large, wealthy Kentucky family, and was well educated. After finishing school during her teens, she moved to [[Springfield, Illinois]], where she lived with her married sister Elizabeth Edwards. Before she married Abraham Lincoln, Mary was courted by his long-time political opponent [[Stephen A. Douglas]]. She and Lincoln had four sons together, only one of whom outlived her. Their home of about 17 years still stands at Eighth and Jackson Streets in Springfield, Illinois.

She supported her husband throughout his presidency. She witnessed his [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|fatal shooting]] when they were together in the President's Box at [[Ford's Theatre]] on Tenth Street in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].

Mary was briefly involuntarily institutionalized for psychiatric disease ten years after her husband's murder, but later retired to the home of her sister.  She also complained of many physical [[symptoms]] during her adult life.

==Early life and education==
Mary was born in [[Lexington, Kentucky]] as the fourth of seven children of Robert Smith Todd, a banker, and Elizabeth "Eliza" (Parker) Todd.&lt;ref name="EmersonJason"/&gt; Her family were slaveholders, and Mary was raised in comfort and refinement.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Clinton, ''Mrs. Lincoln: A Life'' (New York: HarperCollins, 2010) {{ISBN|0-06-076041-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Mary was six, her mother died in [[childbirth]]. Two years later, her father married Elizabeth "Betsy" Humphreys and they had nine children together.&lt;ref name="EmersonJason"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Historians have suggested that Robert Smith Todd and Elizabeth Parker were double first cousins: his paternal aunt was married to her father, and her paternal aunt was married to his father.[http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=17 Mary Todd Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; Mary had a difficult relationship with her stepmother.

From 1832, Mary and her family lived in what is now known as the [[Mary Todd Lincoln House]], an elegant 14-room residence at 578 West Main Street in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]], [[Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/lexington/mtl.htm Mary Todd Lincoln House], National Park Service, (June 9, 1977). Retrieved on September 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary's paternal great-grandfather, David Levi Todd, was born in [[County Longford]], [[Ireland]], and immigrated through Pennsylvania to [[Kentucky]]. Another great-grandfather, [[Andrew Porter (Revolutionary War officer)|Andrew Porter]], was the son of an Irish immigrant to New Hampshire and later Pennsylvania. Her great-great maternal grandfather Samuel McDowell was born in [[Scotland]], and emigrated to Pennsylvania. Other Todd ancestors came from [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=17 Mary Lincoln]. Firstladies.org. Retrieved on September 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

At an early age Mary was sent to Madame Mantelle's finishing school, where the curriculum concentrated on French and literature. She learned to speak French fluently and studied dance, drama, music, and social graces. By age 20, she was regarded as witty and gregarious, with a grasp of politics. Like her family, she was a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]].&lt;ref name="Donald"&gt;{{cite book|last=Donald | first=David Herbert | title=Lincoln | location=New York | publisher=Touchstone | year=1995 | page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary began living with her sister [[Elizabeth Todd Edwards|Elizabeth Porter Edwards]] in [[Springfield, Illinois]] in October 1839. Elizabeth, married to Ninian W. Edwards, son of a [[Ninian Edwards|former governor]], served as Mary's guardian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Springfield |url=http://www.abrahamlincoln200.org/lincolns-life/bio/lincoln-in-illinois/springfield.aspx |work=Lincoln's Life |publisher=[[Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission]] |accessdate=September 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary was popular among the [[gentry]] of [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], and though she was courted by the rising young lawyer and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] politician [[Stephen A. Douglas]] and others, she chose [[Abraham Lincoln]], a fellow Whig.&lt;ref name="Donald"/&gt;

==Marriage and family==
Mary Todd married [[Abraham Lincoln]] on November 4, 1842, at her sister Elizabeth's home in [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], [[Illinois]]. She was 23 years old and he was 33 years of age.

Their four sons, all born in Springfield, were:
* [[Robert Todd Lincoln]] (1843–1926), lawyer, diplomat ([[United States Secretary of War|U.S. Secretary of War]]), businessman
* [[Edward Baker Lincoln]], known as "Eddie" (1846–1850), [[tuberculosis]]&lt;ref name="EmersonJason"/&gt;
* [[William Wallace Lincoln]], known as "Willie" (1850–1862), died of [[typhoid fever]] while Lincoln was President&lt;ref name="EmersonJason"/&gt;
* [[Tad Lincoln|Thomas Lincoln]], known as "Tad" (1853–1871), died at age 18 (either from [[pleurisy]],&lt;ref name="EmersonJason"/&gt; pneumonia,&lt;ref name="Classroom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Abraham Lincoln and Chicago (Abraham Lincoln's Classroom)|url=http://www.abrahamlincolnsclassroom.org/Library/newsletter.asp?ID=60&amp;CRLI=140|publisher=The Lincoln Institute|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; congestive heart failure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lincoln Boys |url=http://myloc.gov/Exhibitions/civil-war-in-america/april-1862-november-1862/ExhibitObjects/Lincoln-Boys.aspx |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=December 2, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023062257/http://myloc.gov/Exhibitions/civil-war-in-america/april-1862-november-1862/ExhibitObjects/Lincoln-Boys.aspx |archivedate=October 23, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or tuberculosis)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davenport|first=Don|title=In Lincoln's Footsteps: A Historical Guide to the Lincoln Sites in Illinois|year=2001|publisher=Big Earth Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rz3VkkikvngC&amp;pg=PA210#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert and Tad survived to adulthood and the death of their father, and only Robert outlived his mother.

==Lincoln's career and home life==
[[File:Lincoln Home 1.jpg|thumb|210px|[[Lincoln Home National Historic Site|Lincoln Home]],  Springfield, Illinois, Eighth and Jackson Streets, residence (1844–1861)]]

Lincoln and Douglas eventually became political rivals in the great [[Lincoln-Douglas debates]] for a seat representing Illinois in the [[United States Senate]] in 1858. Although Douglas successfully secured the seat when elected by the Illinois legislature, Lincoln became famous for his position on slavery, which generated national support for him.

While Lincoln pursued his increasingly successful career as a Springfield lawyer, Mary supervised their growing household. Their house, where they resided from 1844 until 1861, still stands in Springfield, and has been designated the [[Lincoln Home National Historic Site]]. During Lincoln's years as an Illinois circuit lawyer, Mary was often left alone for months at a time to raise their children and run the household.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fords.org/blog/post/understanding-mary-lincoln/|title=Understanding Mary Lincoln|last=Pearson|first=Patrick|date=|website=Ford's Theatre|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary supported her husband socially and politically, not least when Lincoln was elected president in 1860.

==White House years==

[[File:Mary Todd Lincoln colloidon 1860-65.jpg|thumb|upright|Mary Todd Lincoln, 1860–65]]
During her White House years, Mary Lincoln faced many personal difficulties generated by political divisions within the nation. Her family was from a border state where slavery was permitted.&lt;ref&gt;MacLean, Maggie. [http://www.buzzle.com/articles/abolishing-slavery-in-america.html "Abolishing slavery in America."] Accessed December 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Several of her half-brothers served in the Confederate Army and were killed in action, and one brother served the Confederacy as a surgeon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Neely, Mark E., Jr. |url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0017.105/1:2/--secret-treason-of-abraham-lincolns-brother-in-law?rgn=div1;view=fulltextl|title=The secret treason of Abraham Lincoln's brother-in-law|jstor=20148933|journal= Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association|volume=17|issue=1|year=1996|pages=39–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary staunchly supported her husband in his quest to save the Union and was strictly loyal to his policies. Considered a "westerner" although she had grown up in the more refined Upper South city of Lexington, Mary worked hard to serve as her husband's [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], a political center dominated by eastern culture. Lincoln was regarded as the first "western" president, and critics described Mary's manners as coarse and pretentious.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Ellen Blue.

She refurbished the White House, which included extensive redecorating of all the public and private rooms as well as the purchase of [[China service of the Lincoln administration|new china]], which led to extensive overspending.

As the Civil War ended, Mrs. Lincoln expected to continue as the First Lady of a nation at peace. President Lincoln awoke the morning of April 14, 1865 in a pleasant mood. Robert E. Lee had surrendered several days before to Ulysses Grant, and now the President was awaiting word from North Carolina on the surrender of Joseph E. Johnston. The morning papers carried the announcement that the President and his wife would be attending the theater that evening.  At one point, Mary developed a headache and was inclined to stay home, but Lincoln told her he must attend because newspapers had announced that he would.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Donald | first=David Herbert | title=Lincoln | location=New York | publisher=Touchstone | year=1995 | page=593}}&lt;/ref&gt; She sat with her husband watching the comic play ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' at [[Ford's Theatre]]. During the third act, the President and Mrs. Lincoln drew closer together, holding hands while enjoying the play. Mary whispered to her husband, who was holding her hand, "What will Miss Harris think of my hanging on to you so?" The president smiled and replied, "She won't think anything about it".&lt;ref&gt;Swanson, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; That was the last conversation the Lincolns ever had.&lt;ref&gt;Guelzo (1999), p. 434&lt;/ref&gt; Minutes later, President Lincoln was [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|shot]] by [[John Wilkes Booth]]. She was holding Abraham's hand when Booth's bullet struck the back of his head. Mrs. Lincoln accompanied her mortally wounded husband across the street to the [[Petersen House]], where he was taken to a back bedroom and laid crosswise on the bed there, where Lincoln's Cabinet was summoned. Their son Robert sat with Lincoln throughout the night and to the following morning&amp;nbsp;– Saturday, April 15, 1865. At one point, Secretary of War [[Edwin M. Stanton]] ordered Mary from the room as she was so unhinged with grief.&lt;ref name="Emerson"/&gt;

President Lincoln remained in a coma for approximately nine hours before dying at 7:22 the next morning. Shortly before 7{{nbsp}}a.m. Mary was allowed to return to Lincoln's side,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Death of President Lincoln, 1865|url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/lincoln.htm|website=EyeWitness to History|publisher=Ibis Communications, Inc.|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, as Dixon reported, "she again seated herself by the President, kissing him and calling him every endearing name."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Donald | first=David Herbert | title=Lincoln | location=New York | publisher=Touchstone | year=1995 | page=599}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln died on the morning after the assassination.

Afterward, she received messages of condolence from all over the world, many of which she attempted to answer personally. To [[Queen Victoria]] she wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have received the letter which Your Majesty has had the kindness to write. I am deeply grateful for this expression of tender sympathy, coming as they do, from a heart which from its own sorrow, can appreciate the ''intense grief'' I now endure.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Victoria had suffered the loss of her husband, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], four years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, ''Mary Todd Lincoln: Her Life and Letters'', Fromm International Pub. Corp., 1987 {{ISBN|0-88064-073-1}} p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

As a widow, Mrs. Lincoln returned to Illinois and lived in Chicago with her sons. In 1868, her former [[modiste]] (dressmaker) and confidante, [[Elizabeth Keckley]] (1818–1907), published ''Behind the Scenes, or, Thirty Years a Slave, and Four Years in the White House''. She had been born into slavery, purchased her freedom and that of her son, and became a successful businesswoman in Washington, D.C. Although this book provides valuable insight into the character and life of Mary Todd Lincoln, at the time the former First Lady (and much of the public and press) regarded it as a breach of friendship and confidentiality. Keckley was widely criticized for her book, especially as her editor had published letters from Mary Lincoln to her. It has now been gratefully accepted by many historians and biographers and been used to flesh out the President and First Lady's personalities behind the scenes in the Executive Mansion and been used as the basis for several motion pictures and TV mini-series during the late 20th and early 21st Centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Yolanda Williams |last=Page |title=Encyclopedia of African American Women Writers |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=9780313334290 |pages=331–333 |oclc=433369250 |quote=''Behind the Scenes'' and Keckley were mocked and renounced by the press. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehousehistory.org/whha_timelines/timelines_workers-02.html |title=1860s: An uneasy reaction to a White House memoir |work=White House History Timelines: White House Workers |publisher=White House Historical Association |quote=Others believe that Keckley's unscrupulous editor tricked her into lending him Mrs. Lincoln's letters, which he then included in the book. |accessdate=July 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an act approved by a low margin on July 14, 1870, the United States Congress granted Mrs. Lincoln a life pension of $3,000 a year (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|3000|1870}}}} in {{inflation/year|US}} dollars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=016/llsl016.db&amp;recNum=688 |title=Public Acts of the Forty-First Congress of the United States |page=653 |chapter=277&amp;nbsp;– An Act granting a Pension to Mary Lincoln |work=Memory.loc.gov |accessdate=May 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary had lobbied hard for such a pension, writing numerous letters to Congress and urging patrons such as [[Simon Cameron]] to petition on her behalf. She insisted that she deserved a pension just as much as the widows of soldiers, as she portrayed her husband as a fallen commander.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Bach, [http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jala/25.2/bach.html "Acts of Remembrance: Mary Todd Lincoln and Her Husband's Legacy"]&lt;/ref&gt; At the time it was unprecedented for widows of presidents, and Mary Lincoln had alienated many congressmen, making it difficult for her to gain approval.&lt;ref name="EmersonJason"/&gt;

The death of her son Thomas (Tad) in July 1871, following the death of two of her other sons and her husband, brought on an overpowering grief and depression.&lt;ref name="Emerson"/&gt; Her surviving son, Robert Lincoln, a rising young Chicago lawyer, was alarmed at his mother's increasingly erratic behavior. In March 1875, during a visit to [[Jacksonville, Florida]], Mary became unshakably convinced that Robert was deathly ill; hurrying to Chicago, she found him healthy. During her visit with him, she told him that someone had tried to poison her on the train and that a "[[wandering Jew]]" had taken her pocketbook but returned it later.&lt;ref name="Emerson"/&gt; She also spent large amounts of money there on items she never used, such as draperies and elaborate dresses (she wore only black after her husband's assassination). She walked around the city with $56,000 in [[government bonds]] sewn into her petticoats (underskirts). Despite this large amount of money and the $3,000-a-year stipend from Congress, Mrs. Lincoln had an irrational fear of poverty.[[File:Mumler (Lincoln).jpg|thumb|150px|left|Mary Todd Lincoln with the "ghost" of her husband, in an image taken by [[spirit photography|spirit photographer]] [[William H. Mumler]]. Mumler's photos are now considered hoaxes.]] In 1872, she went to spiritualist photographer, [[William H. Mumler]], who produced a photograph of her that appears to faintly show the ghost of President Lincoln behind her (photo in Allen County Public Library, Fort Wayne, Indiana).&lt;ref&gt;[[Mysteries at the Museum]], season 2 (2011), "The French Connection" episode.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to her erratic behavior, Robert initiated proceedings to have her institutionalized.&lt;ref name="Emerson"/&gt; On May 20, 1875, following a trial, a jury committed her to a private asylum in [[Batavia, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/sites/bellevue.htm Mary Todd Lincoln's Stay at Bellevue Place], Showcase.netins.net. Retrieved on November 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the court proceedings, she was so despondent that she attempted suicide. She went to several pharmacies and ordered enough [[laudanum]] to kill herself, but an alert pharmacist frustrated her attempts and finally gave her a [[placebo]].&lt;ref name="Emerson"/&gt;

Three months after being committed to [[Bellevue Place]], she devised her escape: She smuggled letters to her lawyer, [[James B. Bradwell]], and his wife [[Myra Bradwell]], who was not only her friend but also a feminist lawyer. She also wrote to the editor of the ''[[Chicago Times]]''. Soon, the public embarrassments that Robert had hoped to avoid were looming, and his character and motives were in question, as he controlled his mother's finances. The director of Bellevue at Mary's trial had assured the jury she would benefit from treatment at his facility. In the face of potentially damaging publicity, he declared her well enough to go to Springfield to live with her sister Elizabeth as she desired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wcwonline.org/content/view/1719/38/ Wellesley Centers for Women&amp;nbsp;– The Madness of Mary Todd Lincoln | Women's Review of Books-May/June 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923153646/http://www.wcwonline.org/content/view/1719/38/ |date=September 23, 2008 }}.

Mary Lincoln was released into the custody of her sister in Springfield. In 1876 she was declared competent to manage her own affairs.  The earlier committal proceedings had resulted in Mary being profoundly estranged from her son Robert, and they did not see each other again until shortly before her death.&lt;ref name="EmersonJason"/&gt;

Mrs. Lincoln spent the next four years traveling throughout Europe and took up residence in [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau, France]]. Her final years were marked by declining health. She suffered from severe [[cataracts]] that reduced her eyesight; this condition may have contributed to her increasing susceptibility to falls. In 1879, she suffered [[spinal cord injury|spinal cord injuries]] in a fall from a stepladder.&lt;ref name="EmersonJason"/&gt;  She traveled to New York in 1881 and lobbied for an increased pension after the assassination of President Garfield raised the issue of provisions for his family.  She faced a difficult battle, due to negative press over her spending habits and rumors about her handling of her personal finances, including $56,000 in government bonds left to her by her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ellard|first1=Kerry|title=Nevertheless, She Persisted.|url=https://lincolnabraham.com/wiki/mary-todd-pension-her-fight-against-the-government-introduction/|website=Lincoln Abraham|publisher=LincolnAbraham.com|accessdate=July 22, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805222501/https://lincolnabraham.com/wiki/mary-todd-pension-her-fight-against-the-government-introduction/|archivedate=August 5, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress eventually granted the increase, along with an additional monetary gift.  Shortly afterwards, she returned to Springfield and her health deteriorated until she died a few months later.

During the early 1880s, Mary Lincoln was confined to the Springfield, Illinois residence of her sister Elizabeth Edwards. On July 15, 1882, exactly eleven years after [[Tad Lincoln|her youngest son]] died, she became [[Coma|unconscious]] and died the next morning of a stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Wead|first1=Doug|page=81|title=All the Presidents' Children: Triumph and Tragedy in the Lives of America's First Families|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/All_the_Presidents_Children.html?id=AzPd0aVnOl0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographies have been written about Mary Lincoln as well as her husband. [[Barbara Hambly]]'s ''The Emancipator's Wife'' (2005) is considered a well-researched historical novel that provides context for her use of over-the-counter drugs containing alcohol and opium, which were frequently given to women of her era. [[Janis Cooke Newman]]'s historical novel ''Mary: Mrs. A. Lincoln'' (2007), in which Mary tells her own story after incarceration in the asylum in an effort to maintain and prove her sanity, is considered by Mary's recent biographer, [[Jean H. Baker]], to be 'close to life' in its depiction of Mary Lincoln's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mrs-Lincoln-Janis-Cooke-Newman/dp/1905802102/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0 |title=Mrs. Lincoln |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=March 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grief experienced through her widowhood is a theme of [[Andrew Holleran]]'s 2006 novel, ''Grief''.

Mary Lincoln has been portrayed by several actresses in film, including [[Ruth Gordon]] in ''[[Abe Lincoln in Illinois (film)|Abe Lincoln in Illinois]]'' (1940); [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]] in ''[[The Last of Mrs. Lincoln]]'', a 1976 television adaptation of the stage play; [[Mary Tyler Moore]] in the 1988 television mini-series ''[[Lincoln (TV movie)|Lincoln]]''; [[Sally Field]] in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s 2012 film ''[[Lincoln (film)|Lincoln]]'';&lt;ref name=slate.com&gt;{{cite web|last=Bloomer|first=Jeffrey|title=Was Mary Todd Lincoln Really "Insane"?|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/11/09/mary_todd_lincoln_crazy_bipolar_while_historians_argue_new_spielberg_movie.html|work=slate.com|publisher=TheSlate Group|accessdate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Penelope Ann Miller]] in ''[[Saving Lincoln]]'' (2012); and [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]] in ''[[Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (film)|Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter]]'' (2012), set during the [[Civil War (United States)|Civil War]].

In 1955, [[Vivi Janiss]] played the historical Mary Todd Lincoln in "How Chance Made Lincoln President" in the [[anthology]] [[television series]], ''[[TV Reader's Digest]]''. Richard Gaines was cast as Abraham Lincoln, and Ken Hardison played their son, Robert Todd Lincoln.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reinhart |first1=Mark S. |title=Abraham Lincoln on Screen: Fictional and Documentary Portrayals on Film and Television |date=2009 |publisher=McFarland |page=110 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zio49y0tiE0C&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Sufjan Stevens]] referenced Mary Todd Lincoln in the instrumental track "A Short Reprise for Mary Todd, Who Went Insane, but for Very Good Reasons" from his album [[Illinois (Sufjan Stevens album)|Illinois]], which is themed around the state where she resided the majority of her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sufjan Stevens – Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come On Feel The Illinoise|url=https://www.discogs.com/master/14863|website=Discogs|accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4262">The '''Medientage München''' (Munich Media Days) are held annually in [[Munich]] as a congress of the communications industry. An exhibition is organized and occurs at the same time. Every year in October, media entrepreneurs, media makers, and media politicians meet for three days. In 2015 more than 6,200 participants attended the congress, exhibition and events around the Medientage München.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.presseportal.de/pm/61644/3155621 | title=MEDIENTAGE MÜNCHEN 2015 mit mehr als 6.200 Besuchern | author= | date=23 October 2015 | website=presseportal.de | publisher= | language=German | accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Medientage München 2015 took place from 21 to 23 October, at the [[Internationales Congress Center München|International Congress Center (ICM)]] of [[Messe München]] with the support from the [[Bavaria|Bavarian State]] and the ''Bavarian Regulatory Authority for Commercial Broadcasting'' (Bayerische Landeszentrale für neue Medien – BLM).

== History ==
Medientage München were founded in 1987 by Wolf-Dieter Ring and [[Edmund Stoiber]] (both members of the [[Bayerische Staatskanzlei|State Chancellery]] at the time), on behalf of the Bavarian government. The event is intended to bring private radio and television broadcasters, newspaper and magazine publishers, together with public broadcasters in joint discussions. The discussion topics range from current media policies relating to [[advertising]], to [[marketing]] and program quality issues in regards to the protection of minors. The Medientage München GmbH is the organizer of the congress since 1999. Managing directors are Reiner Müller, Johannes Kors and Christopher Tusch. The GmbH is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bavarian Regulatory Authority for Commercial Broadcasting (BLM).

== Congress ==
The Medientage München are considered one of the most important events of the [[Germany|German]] media industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wuv.de/medien/medientage_2012_die_neuen_gesetze_der_medienwelt | title= Medientage 2012: Die neuen Gesetze der Medienwelt | author=Katharina Hannen | date=27 July 2012 | website= | publisher=Werben &amp;Verkaufen | language=German | accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speakers are from the television, radio, print and mobile, and digital business industries, along with advertisers, media politicians and filmmakers. To kick-off the Medientage München, the [[List of Ministers-President of Bavaria|Minister-President of Bavaria]] opens the event with the ''Mediengipfel'' (Media Summit).

== Media exhibition ==
At the exhibition, which is held at the same time, presentations from companies, institutions, and initiatives from media and communication industries can be found. On the grounds of the ''MedienCampus Bayern'', media training centers, journalism schools and employers in the media industry present themselves. Young professionals can find out about education and training for the media industry.

== Other events ==
Alongside the event is the “Nacht der Medien” ("Night of the media").

In addition to the central meeting point of the Medientage München, the Medientage München GmbH organizes further events to assist the communication industry – including the Audiovisual Media Days (AVMD): A congress for motion pictures media, marketing and corporate communication, that is held annually in Munich. Where some 400 representatives of the motion picture industry meet to report on trends surrounding online video, smart and web TV.

Additionally are the Munich Gaming and the Medientage Special (Media Days Special).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2600">The '''Mickey Thompson Entertainment Group''' (MTEG) was a sanctioning body for an American [[short course off road racing]] series that took place inside [[stadium]]s. Some events were televised, including on [[Spike TV|TNN]] and [[ESPN]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20060506111318/http://www.dohertymotorsports.com/albumpersonal.htm]

==History==
[[Mickey Thompson]] raced desert trucks in the [[SCORE International]] series. Thompson said that he was seen "by nothing but cactus and jackrabbits."[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311041950/http://www.off-road.com/rock/feature/ds_2_for_the_show/] He reasoned that he needed to bring the excitement of desert racing to a wider audience. 

The body and series were established by Thompson in 1979. The first event was held in the [[Los Angeles Coliseum]]. The body also sanctioned motorcycle races called Supercross. The stadium series survived Thompson's 1988 murder. The body went bankrupt in 1996. The concept of stadium off-road racing was revived with the creation of the [[Stadium Super Trucks]] in 2013 by former series champion [[Robby Gordon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9718">'''Misprision of treason''' is an offence found in many [[common law]] jurisdictions around the world, having been inherited from [[English law]]. It is committed by someone who knows a [[treason]] is being or is about to be committed but does not report it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basiclaw23.gov.hk/english/pamphlet/pamphlet6.htm|title=National Security (Legislative Provisions) Bill|publisher=Security Bureau, the HKSAR Government |accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a proper authority.

==Australia==
Under Australian law a person is guilty of misprision of treason if he:

{{quote|(a) receives or assists another person who, to his or her knowledge, has committed treason with the intention of allowing him or her to escape punishment or apprehension; or

(b) knowing that another person intends to commit treason, does not inform a constable of it within a reasonable time or use other reasonable endeavours to prevent the commission of the offence.}}

The penalty is life imprisonment.

==Canada==
Under section 50(1)(b) of the Canadian [[Criminal Code (Canada)|''Criminal Code'']], a person is guilty of an offence (although it is not described as misprision) if: "knowing that a person is about to commit high treason or treason [he] does not, with all reasonable dispatch, inform a justice of the peace or other peace officer thereof or make other reasonable efforts to prevent that person from committing high treason or treason."

The maximum penalty is 14 years.

==Republic of Ireland==

Under section 3 of the [[Treason Act 1939]] a person is guilty of misprision of treason if "knowing that any act the commission of which would be treason is intended or proposed to be, or is being, or has been committed, [he] does not forthwith disclose the same, together with all particulars thereof known to him, to a Justice of the District Court, or an officer of the [[Garda Síochána|Gárda Síochána]], or some other person lawfully engaged on duties relating to the preservation of peace and order."

==New Zealand==
[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM328524.html Section 76(b)] of the [[Crimes Act 1961]] provides that any person who "knowing that a person is about to commit treason, fails without reasonable excuse to inform a constable as soon as possible or to use other reasonable efforts to prevent its commission" is guilty of an offence.

A person guilty of this offence is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years.

==Russia==
Russia has no specific offence of misprision. However Article 275 of the [[Criminal Code of Russia]] encourages people to come forward with information by providing them with a statutory defence to treason and other offences:

{{quote|A person who has committed crimes stipulated in this Article, or by Articles 276 and 278 of this Code, shall be relieved from criminal responsibility if he has facilitated the prevention of further damage to the interests of the Russian Federation by informing the governmental authorities of his own free will and in due time, or in any other way, if his actions contain no other ''[[corpus delicti]]''.}}

==United Kingdom==
Misprision of treason is an offence under the common law of [[England and Wales]] and the common law of [[Northern Ireland]].  By statute, the offence of misprision of treason under the common law of England has been made an offence which is cognisable under the law of [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=1516341&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1516344 section 1], [[Treason Act 1708]]&lt;/ref&gt; This offence was formerly known as misprision of high treason in order to distinguish it from misprision of [[petty treason]], before that offence was abolished along with its parent offence [[Offences against the Person Act 1828|in 1828]].

The crime is committed where a person knows that treason is being planned or committed and does not report it as soon as he can to a justice of the peace or other authority. The offender does not need to consent to the treason; mere knowledge is enough. Concealment of treason was itself a treason at common law until the [[Treason Act 1554]]&lt;ref&gt;section 8, Treason Act 1554 (1 &amp; 2 Phil. &amp; Mar. c.10)&lt;/ref&gt; deemed it merely misprision of treason, which was a [[felony]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sykes v. Director of Public Prosecutions'' [1962] AC 528 at 555&lt;/ref&gt;

===Difference from treason===

In R v. Tonge (1662) 6 State Tr 225, it was said that:

{{quote|Where a person knowing of the design meets with the others and hears them discourse of their traitorous designs and says or acts nothing; this is high treason in that party, for it is more than a bare concealment, which is misprision. But if a person not knowing of their design before, come into their company and hear their discourses, and say nothing, and never meet with them again at their consultations, that conduct is only misprision of high treason.}}

(For more information about the "Tonge Plot", see ''Intelligence and Espionage in the Reign of Charles II, 1660–1685'' (Marshall, 1994).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vpHMnBeiXrQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Intelligence+and+Espionage+in+the+Reign+of+Charles+II,+1660-1685#v=onepage&amp;q=%22alleged%20tonge%20plot%22&amp;f=false/ Intelligence and Espionage in the Reign of Charles II, 1660–1685] at Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;)

Similarly, in R v. Walcott (1683) 9 State Tr 519 at 553, Pemberton, LCJ. said:

{{quote|For a man to hear of treason accidentally or occasionally and conceal it is but misprision, but if a man will be at consult where treason is hatched and will then conceal it he is guilty of treason therein.}}

===Penalty===

It is punishable by imprisonment for life.&lt;ref&gt;''Archbold: Criminal Pleading Evidence &amp; Practice'' para. 18–38&lt;/ref&gt;

===Procedure===

The procedure on trials for misprision of treason is the same as that on trials for murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=1186125&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1186140 section 12(6)], [[Criminal Law Act 1967]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=1004460&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1004476 section 14(7)] [[Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=2351946&amp;ActiveTextDocId=2352397 section 289], [[Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is classified as an [[indictable-only offence]].

===Limitation===
A person may not be indicted for misprision of treason committed within the United Kingdom unless the indictment is signed within three years of the commission of that offence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=1518767&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1518771 section 5], [[Treason Act 1695]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=1029174&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1029174 section 1], [[Treason (Ireland) Act 1821]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scottish Parliament===
Misprision of treason is a [[Reserved matters (Westminster)|reserved matter]] on which the [[Scottish Parliament]] cannot legislate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=2044365&amp;activetextdocid=2044626 paragraph 10, Schedule 5] to the [[Scotland Act 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the [[United States]], misprision of treason is a [[federal offense]], committed where someone who has knowledge of the commission of any [[treason]] against the United States, conceals such knowledge and does not inform the [[President of the United States|President]], a [[federal judge]], a State [[Governor]], or a State [[judge]] (''{{UnitedStatesCode|18|2382}}''). It is punishable by a fine and up to seven years in [[federal prison]]. It is also a crime punishable under the criminal laws of many states.

=== East Asian Nations (2009-2011) ===
Trend Micro reported on a campaign against East Asian governments, electronics manufacturers, and a telecommunications company.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Numbered Panda engaged in spear phishing email campaigns with malicious attachments.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Often, the malicious email attachments would be PDF files that exploited CVE-2009-4324, CVE-2009-09274, CVE-2011-06095, or CVE-2011-0611 vulnerabilities in [[Adobe Acrobat]], Adobe Reader, and [[Adobe Flash Player|Flash Player]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The attackers also used an exploit that affected [[Microsoft Excel]] - CVE-2009-3129.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Ixeshe malware used in this campaign allowed Numbered Panda to list all services, processes, and drives; terminate processes and services; download and upload files; start processes and services; get victims’ user names; get a machine’s name and [[domain name]]; download and execute arbitrary files; cause a system to pause or sleep for a specified number of minutes; spawn a [[Remote Shell|remote shell]]; and list all current files and directories.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; After installation, Ixeshe would start communicating with [[Command and control (malware)|command-and-control]] servers; oftentimes three servers were hard-coded for redundancy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Numbered Panda often used compromised servers to create these command-and-control servers to increase control of a victim’s network infrastructure.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Using this technique, the group is believed to have amassed sixty servers by 2012.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A majority of the command-and-control servers used from this campaign were located in Taiwan and the United States.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Base64]] was used for communication between the compromised computer and the server.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Trend Micro found that, once decoded, the communication was a standardized structure that detailed the computer's name, [[Private network|local IP address]], [[proxy server]] IP and [[Port (computer networking)|port]], and the malware ID.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Researchers at [[CrowdStrike]] found that blogs and WordPress sites were frequently used in the command-and-control infrastructure to make the network traffic look more legitimate.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Japan and Taiwan (2011-2014) ===
An Arbor Security report found that Numbered Panda began a campaign against Japan and Taiwan using the Etumbot malware in 2011.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Similar to the previously observed campaign, the attackers would use decoy files, such as PDF, Excel spreadsheets, or [[Microsoft Word|Word]] documents, as email attachments to gain access to victims' computers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Most of the documents observed were written in Traditional Chinese and usually pertained to Taiwanese government interests; several of the files related to upcoming conferences in Taiwan.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Once the malicious file was downloaded and extracted by the victim, Etumbot uses a [[Bi-directional text|right-to-left override]] exploit to trick the victim to download the malware installer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to Arbor Security, the "technique is a simple way for malware writers to disguise names of malicious files. A hidden [[Unicode]] character in the filename will reverse the order of the characters that follow it, so that a .scr binary file appears to be a .xls document, for example."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Once the malware is installed, it sends a request to a command-and-control server with a [[RC4]] key to encrypt subsequent communication.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As was with the Ixeshe malware, Numbered Panda used Base64 encoded characters to communicate from compromised computers to the command-and-control servers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Etumbot is able to determine if the target computer is using a proxy and will bypass the proxy settings to directly establish a connection.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After communication is established, the malware will send an [[Encryption|encrypted]] message from the infected computer to the server with the [[NetBIOS]] name of the victim's system, user name, IP address, and if the system is using a proxy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

After the May 2014 Arbor Security report detailed Etumbot, FireEye discovered that Numbered Panda changed parts of the malware.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; FireEye noticed that the [[Communications protocol|protocols]] and strings previously used were changed in June 2014.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The researchers at FireEye believe this change was to help the malware evade further detection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; FireEye named this new version of Etumbot HighTide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Numbered Panda continued to target Taiwan with spear phishing email campaigns with malicious attachments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Attached Microsoft Word documents exploited the [http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2012-0158 CVE-2012-0158] vulnerability to help propagate HighTide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; FireEye found that compromised Taiwanese government employee email accounts were used in some of the spear phishing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; HighTide differs from Etumbot in that its [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP GET request]] changed the User Agent, the format and structure of the HTTP [[Uniform Resource Identifier]], the executable file location, and the image base address.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== New York Times (2012) ===
Numbered Panda is believed to be responsible for the computer network breach at the New York Times in late 2012.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/08/survival-of-the-fittest-new-york-times-attackers-evolve-quickly.html|title=Survival of the Fittest: New York Times Attackers Evolve Quickly « Threat Research Blog|website=FireEye|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/technology/chinese-hackers-infiltrate-new-york-times-computers.html|title=Chinese Hackers Infiltrate New York Times Computers|last=Perlroth|first=Nicole|date=2013-01-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-24|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack occurred after the New York Times published a story about how the relatives of [[Wen Jiabao]], the sixth [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China]], "accumulated a fortune worth several billion dollars through business dealings."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The computers used to launch the attack are believed to be the same university computers used by the Chinese military to attack United States [[Arms industry|military contractors]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Numbered Panda used updated versions of the malware packages Aumlib and Ixeshe.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The updated Aumlib allowed Numbered Panda to encode the body of a [[POST (HTTP)|POST request]] to gather a victim's [[BIOS]], external [[IP address|IP]], and [[operating system]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A new version of Ixeshe altered the pervious version's network traffic pattern in an effort to evade existing network traffic signatures designed to detect Ixeshe related infections.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14562">From 1890 through 2006, the '''Orleans Levee Board''' was the body of commissioners that oversaw the '''Orleans Levee District (OLD)''' which supervised the [[levee]] and floodwall system in [[New Orleans|Orleans Parish, Louisiana]]. The role of the OLD has changed over time. Prior to Hurricane Betsy in 1965, the OLD developed land and sold it to raise money to build and improve levees. After 1965, Congress directed the Army Corps of Engineers to be responsible for design and construction of the hurricane flood protection system enveloping New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article | page=709 | author=J. David Rogers, G. Paul Kemp | title=Interaction between the US Army Corps of Engineers and the Orleans Levee Board preceding the drainage canal wall failures and catastrophic flooding of New Orleans in 2005 | publisher=Water Policy|year=2015 | accessdate=2017-04-24|url=http://wp.iwaponline.com/content/ppiwawaterpol/17/4/707.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to the 1965 legislation, the OLB's duties regarding hurricane surge protection were now limited to collecting the 30% cost share for project design and construction, and to maintaining and operating completed flood protection structures. Until the end of 2006, the OLB was a major governmental entity which functioned independently of municipal government in and around Orleans Parish. (Orleans Parish is coextensive with the city of New Orleans; their boundaries are one and the same).

In the wake of the catastrophic [[levee]] failures in New Orleans during [[Hurricane Katrina]], two new regional flood protection authorities were created to replace the multiple [[Parish (administrative division)|parochial]] levee boards, including Orleans Parish's Levee Board. Most of the '''Orleans Levee District''' now falls under the jurisdiction of the '''[[Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority]] - East''', charged with the oversight of all flood-protection infrastructure for [[New Orleans metropolitan area|Greater New Orleans]] on the East Bank of the [[Mississippi River]]. The '''Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority - West''' possesses the same metro-wide jurisdiction for the West Bank of the Mississippi, and it includes that portion of the Orleans Levee District on the West Bank (i.e., [[Algiers, New Orleans|Algiers]]).

After Hurricana Katrina, it was widely believed that perhaps a different form of levee board governance might be more appropriate for a major marine terminal like New Orleans. Nevertheless, the issue of whether the members of the OLB Engineering Committee acted incompetently or negligently has not been conclusively demonstrated or proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article | page=721 | author=J. David Rogers, G. Paul Kemp | title=Interaction between the US Army Corps of Engineers and the Orleans Levee Board preceding the drainage canal wall failures and catastrophic flooding of New Orleans in 2005 | publisher=Water Policy|year=2015 | accessdate=2017-04-24|url=http://wp.iwaponline.com/content/ppiwawaterpol/17/4/707.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The pre-Katrina Orleans Levee District (OLD), governed by the Orleans Levee Board (OLB), owned considerable assets, mainly real estate, a peculiarity that stems from its history. The '''Orleans Levee District''' was created by the [[Louisiana legislature]] in 1890 for the purpose of protecting the low-lying city of New Orleans from floods. At that time, communities along the [[Mississippi River]] were largely in charge of creating their own levees to protect themselves, as no unified levee system existed. Most neighboring [[Parish (administrative division)|parishes]] had (and some still have) similar parochial levee boards. In the early twentieth century, the OLD reclaimed a portion of Lake Pontchartrain, a 24-mile wide lake north of New Orleans. The OLD developed the land and sold it to raise money to build and improve levees. Starting in the 1920s, the Board undertook a massive flood-protection initiative involving the construction of a stepped [[seawall]] several hundred feet north of a portion of the existing south shore of [[Lake Pontchartrain]]. The intervening area was filled to several feet above sea level and was to serve as a "super levee" protecting the city from the Lake's [[storm surge]].

The Lake Vista, Lake Oaks, Lake Terrace, East and West Lakeshore subdivisions and other property between Robert E. Lee Blvd and Lake Pontchartrain are all examples of the OLB's developed properties.

In 1924, the state legislature authorized the OLB to acquire 33,000 acres (130&amp;nbsp;km²) of land on the east bank of the Mississippi River about {{convert|50|mi|km}} south of New Orleans in order to build the '''Bohemia Spillway''' between the River and the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  (''1924 La. Acts 99''). Approximately half of this land was public property transferred from the state; the other half was either expropriated,
or purchased under threat of expropriation, from private owners according to a legal finding. (''1928 La. Acts 246; 1942 La. Acts 311'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=5th&amp;navby=case&amp;no=0130728cv0 |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]], the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] gave the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] supervision and control over the design and construction of flood-control infrastructure throughout the [[Mississippi embayment|Mississippi River Valley]].

In 1934, [[New Orleans Lakefront Airport]] opened on land [[Dredging|dredged]] from [[Lake Pontchartrain]] by the Levee Board, part of a larger "lakefill" land-reclamation project initiated to construct a super levee for the protection of the northern perimeter of the city. The airport was originally named "Shushan Airport" after Orleans Levee Board president Abraham Lazar Shushan; it was renamed "New Orleans Airport" after Shushan's indictment for corruption in the [[Louisiana Scandals]] of the late 1930s.

[[Governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[Jimmie Davis]], in his second term from 1960 to 1964, named the New Orleans attorney [[Gerald J. Gallinghouse]] as the president of the levee board. In that capacity, Gallinghouse delivered more than 300 speeches warning of the need to be prepared for weather disasters, another of which was on its way, [[Hurricane Betsy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lakelawn.tributes.com/our_obituaries/Gerald-Joseph-Gallinghouse-84757764|title=Gerald Joseph Gallinghouse|publisher=''[[New Orleans Times-Picayune]]''|accessdate=June 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
After extensive flooding during Hurricane Betsy in 1965, [[United States Congress|Congress]] ordered the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] henceforth to design and build flood protection in the ''Lake Pontchartrain and Vicinity Hurricane Protection Project''. The OLB became the local sponsor, and its duties regarding flood protection were now limited to collecting 30% cost-share for project design and construction and maintaining the completed structures. Despite Congress's mandate that the Corps now had the authority to design/build flood protection, the OLB still retained extensive assets which had to be managed.

==Orleans Levee Board and Hurricane Katrina==
{{main|2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans}}
[[Image:FridgeLeveeBoardVictim.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Debris set on curb from flood-damaged [[Uptown New Orleans|Uptown]] home includes trashed "[[Katrina refrigerator]]" with [[graffiti]] labeling it as a "levee board victim."]]

After Hurricane Katrina, in a context of shock, chaos and confusion, the Orleans Levee Board found itself at the center of the greatest crisis ever to face the city of New Orleans. Multiple levee and floodwall breaches in the [[Industrial Canal]], the [[17th Street Canal]], and the [[London Avenue Canal]] resulted in the flooding of 80% of the city. The flood is believed to have directly caused over 1,400 deaths; destroyed or severely damaged homes, businesses, and property in the majority of the city.

Investigations after the disaster revealed that the design of the levee and floodwall system, designed and built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, had profoundly inadequate design and construction specifications.

What is evident from the project record is that the Army Corps recommended raising the canal floodwalls for the 17th Street Canal, but recommended gated structures at the mouths of the Orleans and London Avenue Canals because the latter plan was less expensive. The OLB convinced Congress to pass legislation that required the Corps to raise the floodwalls for all three canals. Furthermore, the Corps, in a separate attempt to limit project costs, initiated a sheet pile load test (E-99 Study), but misinterpreted the results and wrongly concluded that sheet piles needed to be driven to depths of only 17 feet (1 foot ¼ 0.3048 meters) instead of between 31 and 46 feet. That decision saved approximately $100 million, but significantly reduced overall engineering reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article | page=707 | author=J. David Rogers, G. Paul Kemp | title=Interaction between the US Army Corps of Engineers and the Orleans Levee Board preceding the drainage canal wall failures and catastrophic flooding of New Orleans in 2005 | publisher=Water Policy|year=2015 | accessdate=2017-04-24|url=http://wp.iwaponline.com/content/ppiwawaterpol/17/4/707.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes to National and State Policy==
After the levee failures, the immediate assumption was that the OLD commissioners were not engaged in flood protection. This was reinforced by corps spokespersons who repeatedly told a story of local levee board officials who "forced" the corps to build the system that failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schleifstein|first=Mark|title=Study: Corps decisions, not Orleans Levee Board, doomed canal walls in Katrina|publisher=The Times-Picayune|date=August 7, 2015|accessdate=2017-04-24|url= http://www.nola.com/environment/index.ssf/2015/08/corps_decisions_not_orleans_le.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As revealed in an August 2015 article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article | page=720 | author=J. David Rogers, G. Paul Kemp | title=Interaction between the US Army Corps of Engineers and the Orleans Levee Board preceding the drainage canal wall failures and catastrophic flooding of New Orleans in 2005 | publisher=Water Policy|year=2015 | accessdate=2015-10-31|url=http://wp.iwaponline.com/content/ppiwawaterpol/17/4/707.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the official journal of the [[World Water Council]], the story is untrue, and responsibility for the levee failures belongs to the corps. Nonetheless, in the context of haste confusion, there were calls for the elimination of the Orleans Levee Board and other local boards.

During a special session of the [[Louisiana Legislature]], a bill submitted by [[Walter Boasso|Sen. Walter Boasso]] [[Arabi, Louisiana|(D-Arabi)]] was passed into law, which consolidated the levee boards of various [[Parish (administrative division)|parishes]] within [[New Orleans metropolitan area|Greater New Orleans]]. The new legislation was intended to (1) remove distractions, (2) replace parochial flood control with regional flood control, and (3) require commissioners to have professional expertise including hydrology, construction engineering and civil engineering.

The law created two new regional levee boards, '''Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority-East''' and '''Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority-West''', separated by the [[Mississippi River]]. The Orleans Levee Board ceased to exist on January 1, 2007. The new regional flood-protection authorities assumed control of the Board's flood-protection infrastructure. [[New Orleans Lakefront Airport|Lakefront Airport]], the [[marina]]s (except for the city-owned Municipal Yacht Harbor), Lakeshore Drive, and the lakefront park system (except for West End Park, administered by New Orleans' Parks and Parkways Department) are now operated and maintained by the Louisiana State '''Division of Administration''' [http://www.legis.state.la.us/boards/board_members.asp?board=916 Non-Flood Protection Asset Management Authority].

Investigative studies completed after the legislation's passage revealed no causal link between the pre-Katrina levee boards and the flooding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article | page=719 | author=J. David Rogers, G. Paul Kemp | title=Interaction between the US Army Corps of Engineers and the Orleans Levee Board preceding the drainage canal wall failures and catastrophic flooding of New Orleans in 2005 | publisher=Water Policy|year=2015 | accessdate=2017-04-24|url=http://wp.iwaponline.com/content/ppiwawaterpol/17/4/707.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the new levee boards are very useful. To the extent legally possible and within budget, the East and West Levee Authorities are checking the corps' general plans. They are well focused, have relevant expertise and may catch egregious planning and/or design errors."

The levee breach event was a pivotal moment in American history. The nation took a different path due to the flooding event. The myriad changes to national policy as a result of this lynchpin moment include, but are not limited to, the following: Nationwide assessment of levees, First-ever National Levee Safety Act, National Flood Risk Management Program, Reform of the Army Corps of Engineers and Changes in Levee Building by the Corps.

Since fifty-five percent of American people lives in counties protected by levees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schleifstein|first=Mark|title=Levee statistics point up their importance to nation's economy|publisher=The Times-Picayune|date=January 2, 2010|accessdate=2017-04-24|url= http://www.nola.com/environment/index.ssf/2015/08/corps_decisions_not_orleans_le.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; this means the majority of the national population are safer.

The '''Rif Dimashq offensive (November 2012–February 2013)''' refers to a rebel offensive during the [[Syrian Civil War]] in the [[Rif Dimashq Governorate]] (which surrounds [[Damascus]]) which started in November 2012, and a subsequent attempted Syrian Army counterattack in January 2013. [[Thomson Reuters]] described rebels as "ramping up attacks on Damascus" in late November&lt;ref name="ThReut_Damas_airport29Nov2012" /&gt; and ''[[BBC News]]'' described the 29 November government counterattack as "an unprecedented offensive against rebel-held districts in the east of the city".&lt;ref name="BBC_Damas_airport29Nov2012" /&gt;

On 31 October, the Free Syrian Army announced that they had helped to form a brigade made up of anti-Assad Palestinians, (Storm Brigade), which was armed to take control of Yarmouk camp from the pro-Assad Palestinian group, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. The PFLP-GC leader Ahmed Jibril and his men have been accused of harassing the camp's residents and attacking FSA fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.com/topic/syria/rebels-form-brigade-damascus-fight-armed-palestinians-aligned-president-assad|title=Rebels form a brigade in Damascus to fight armed Palestinians aligned with President Assad.|work=Al Jazeera Blogs|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Palestinian men from the camp also joined other FSA units and fought with them in the Damascus districts of Tadamon and Al-Hajar Al-Aswad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2012/Jul-18/181033-palestinians-join-syria-revolt-activists-fsa.ashx#axzz2Aniktc00|title=Palestinians join Syria revolt: activists, FSA|work=The Daily Star Newspaper - Lebanon|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The offensive==
===November clashes===
On 7 November, rebels launched a large operation in Central Damascus. Firing mortars into the predominantly Alawite Mezzah 86 district near the Presidential Palace, rebel forces hit the Prime Minister's offices and Mezzah's military airport, killing 3 civilians and injuring 12 others. A spokesperson for the Revolutionary Council in Damascus, Susan Ahmed, described the operation as "a countdown", and also stated "It seems something serious is going on there now and things are going out of control. The regime cannot control Damascus anymore".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20238859 | work=BBC News | title=Syria rebels attack Assad strongholds in Damascus | date=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, a Syrian judge was assassinated in a residential area of Damascus when explosives planted under his car were remotely detonated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/11/07/syria-judge-killed.html | work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early December clashes===
On 1 December, clashes occurred in [[Arbin, Syria|Arbin]] (east of Damascus) and government forces shelled Zabadani, leaving many people wounded, according to the [[Syrian Observatory for Human Rights]] (SOHR). Government forces tried to secure the airport highway by fighting in [[Mliha]], as part of a strategy to "secure a wider perimeter around Damascus" to prevent rebels from entering Damascus.&lt;ref name="perthnow_rifdim2dec2012" /&gt; [[Agence France-Presse]] suggested that the military's aim was to make negotiations with the rebels easier.&lt;ref name="perthnow_rifdim2dec2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/world/regime-forces-hammer-damascus-outskirts/story-fnd14032-1226528448648 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526192103/http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/world/regime-forces-hammer-damascus-outskirts/story-fnd14032-1226528448648 |archivedate=2013-05-26 |df= }} Regime forces hammer rebels on Damascus outskirts 2 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Intense fighting between rebels and government forces and bombardment by government forces continued to 2 December in and around the highway to the airport. EgyptAir announced on 2 December that it would reopen flights to the airport on 3 December.&lt;ref name="ThReut_2Dec2012" /&gt; On 2 December, the Syrian army bombarded rebel-held suburbs around Damascus with fighter aircraft and rockets, killing at least ten rebels and wounding dozens in an offensive to stop rebels closing in on Damascus. The Syrian army entered part of Daraya where rebels had launched mortars into the city. The Army had entered one side of the town, but rebels were still in control of the rest of the area and were fighting back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syrian forces pound Damascus suburbs, flights to resume |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/02/us-syria-crisis-idUSBRE8AJ1FK20121202 |last=Solomon |first=Erica |publisher=Reuters |date=2 December 2012 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 December, the Syrian Army continued firing artillery and using fighter jets against the rebel-held areas near Damascus in order to protect the capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syria bombs Damascus suburbs, Putin in Ankara talks |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iaL6HAw7u0dWI2nh9BBkVwaCn4bg?docId=CNG.c19a448143681e6e4aeace3a0218a1cb.51 |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=3 December 2012 |accessdate=3 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407095245/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iaL6HAw7u0dWI2nh9BBkVwaCn4bg?docId=CNG.c19a448143681e6e4aeace3a0218a1cb.51 |archivedate=April 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December, Syrian state television claimed that 29 students and a teacher were killed by a "terrorist" mortar attack in the suburbs of Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Syrian rebels kill 29 students in attack on school near Damascus |url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/syria-29-students-killed-mortar-attack-17872899#.UL4YQuT8KW0 |last=Surk |first=Barbara |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=4 December 2012 |accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 December, fighting took place near Aqraba military airport (near Damascus International Airport),&lt;ref name="Bloomberg_infrastructure" /&gt; with the Free Syrian Army claiming to "secure control" of the military airport itself, according to ''[[Al Arabiya]]'' and ''[[NOW Lebanon]]''.&lt;ref name="NOWLeb_Aqraba_taken" /&gt; According to ''NOW Lebanon'', rebels also took over the Eastern Ghouta airbase&lt;ref name="NOWLeb_Aqraba_taken" /&gt; for a second time since the first takeover on 25 November.&lt;ref name="BBC_EGhouta_airbase_25nov2012" /&gt;

On 7 December, the rebels claimed that they were still blockading most access to the Damascus International Airport. [[Damascus Military Council]] spokesperson Nabil al-Amir stated that the rebels had "waited two weeks for the airport to be emptied of most civilians and airlines" and that as of 7 December, the airport was "a military zone" and that "civilians who approach it now do so at their own risk."&lt;ref name="ThReut_airport_7dec2012" /&gt; Flights by foreign airlines to the airport remained suspended.&lt;ref name="ThReut_airport_7dec2012" /&gt; A governmental spokesperson stated that the Syrian Army was "driving rebels back from positions in the suburbs and outskirts of Damascus".&lt;ref name="ThReut_airport_7dec2012" /&gt; On 8 December, the airport road was blocked at one point.&lt;ref name="Indep_govt_defends_Dam" /&gt;

By 9 December, the military counteroffensive was seen as successful in relieving the rebel pressure on the capital. [[Patrick Cockburn]] writing in ''[[The Independent]]'' stated that the Syrian Army had strengthened its control of Damascus by shifting forces from the Syrian countryside to Damascus. A diplomat contacted by Cockburn stated, "In private, FSA commanders admitted that their attacks in Damascus had not gone as planned and they suffered losses, but this does not mean that they will not try again."&lt;ref name="Indep_govt_defends_Dam" /&gt; Witnesses reported seeing bodies of dead rebels and soldiers lying beside the airport road. A rebel fighter interviewed by ''[[The New York Times]]'' said that the attack on the airport was a diversion to allow fighters, who were attempting to seize control of the road from Damascus to the northeast, to escape after suffering heavy casualties, due to poor planning. According to him, the resulting Syrian Army counter-offensive resulted in an "unbelievable" level of violence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/10/world/middleeast/syria-fighting-damascus.html?pagewanted=all Fighting Drives an Old Sense of Peace From Damascus]&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 15, a rebel spokesperson for the Ababil Horan and Eastern Ghouta Brigades claimed that the FSA attacked a meeting in Damascus that led to the killing of "a number of the heads of operations" in Damascus and its suburbs, and that they now have knowledge of movements and meetings of other senior heads of operations in Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/15/world/meast/syria-civil-war/ | work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Yarmouk Camp===
{{main|Battle of Yarmouk Camp (December 2012)}}
On 16 December, Syrian Army jets bombed the Palestinian refugee [[Yarmouk Camp]], for the first time since the uprising began in March 2011. Activists reported at least two rockets fired and dozens killed as a mosque sheltering refugees from embattled areas of the capital was hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/16/syria-crisis-camp-idUSL5E8NG4DX20121216 | work=Reuters | title=Syrian fighter jets bomb Palestinian camp in Damascus-activists | date=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 December, rebels claimed that many PFLP-GC fighters who were fighting in the camp defected to the rebels, while their leader, Ahmad Jibril, and the remaining fighters joined government troops outside the camp. Later that day, rebel forces gained full control of the Yarmouk camp and another Palestinian camp with assistance from anti-Assad Palestinian factions, pushing PFLP-GC fighters out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WRAPUP 1-Syrian rebels take control of Damascus Palestinian camp|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/17/syria-crisis-idUSL5E8NHGZZ20121217|accessdate=18 December 2012|newspaper=Reuters|date=17 December 2012|first=Mariam|last=Karouny}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20766628 | work=BBC News | title=Syria rebels make further gains | date=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government forces had surrounded the camp, however, as many refugees fled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/12/2012121717419248502.html|title=Syrian forces surround Palestinian camp|date=17 December 2012|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 January, Syrian ground and air forces bombarded rebel strongholds on the outskirts of Damascus, as part of the government's continuing offensive. Rebel forces were fighting the government in areas on three sides of the capital. However, the opposition's advance bogged down due to continuing airstrikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Syrian warplanes bomb suburbs of the capital as troops and rebels fight across the country |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/government-airstrikes-on-rebel-held-suburbs-show-limits-of-opposition-push-to-take-damascus/2013/01/03/efdbef0c-561c-11e2-89de-76c1c54b1418_story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104214110/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/government-airstrikes-on-rebel-held-suburbs-show-limits-of-opposition-push-to-take-damascus/2013/01/03/efdbef0c-561c-11e2-89de-76c1c54b1418_story.html |archive-date=4 January 2013 |newspaper=washingtonpost. |date=4 January 2013 |accessdate=4 January 2013 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of international journalists covering the army's operations outside the capital was caught in the crossfire, and a RT correspondent was wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/rt-journalist-damascus-crossfire-318/|title=RT correspondent injured in Damascus crossfire|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath – Ring road and Jobar offensive==
{{main|Damascus offensive (2013)}}
On 6 February, rebel forces launched an offensive, named "Battle of Armageddon", on the edge of Central Damascus, with rebels entering the Jobar District of Damascus after overrunning a Syrian Army road block. Parts of the Damascus ring road, which acts as a barrier between Central Damascus and Ghouta, were also seized by rebel fighters. Rebels also launced attacks on Adra, north east of Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/06/us-syria-crisis-damscus-idUSBRE9150BD20130206|title=Syrian rebels fight close to heart of Damascus|work=Reuters|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/world/middleeast/syrian-war-closes-in-on-the-heart-of-damascus.html?pagewanted=1&amp;pagewanted=print | title=Damascus on Edge as War Seeps into Syrian Capital | work=The New York Times | date=10 February 2013 | first1=An | last1=Employee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 February, a rebel claimed that opposition forces had captured another military checkpoint in the Jobar district. However, SOHR stated that while fighting for the highway continued, government troops regained control of the area after bombing rebel positions the day before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/syrian-army-rebels-battle-for-key-damascus-highway/|title=Syrian army, rebels battle for key Damascus highway|work=The Times of Israel|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 February, a SCUD missile fired by government forces hit the Douma command center of the Liwa al-Islam Brigade, which had been spearheading the attack against the roundabout and the Jobar district. Sheikh Zahran Alloush, the commander and founder of the brigade, had been wounded in the strike. The area was devastated and other rebel fighters were also killed or wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/20/us-syria-crisis-rebel-idUSBRE91J0D420130220|title=Missile blast wounds Syrian rebel commander: activists|work=Reuters|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategic analysis==
Holding Damascus was considered crucial for the government, which kept its highest concentration of troops and its most loyal and best-trained units in and around the city. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', rebels were unlikely to be able to overrun Damascus quickly, but the fighting in Rif Dimashq, especially at the airport, had a profound psychological effect on government supporters, making them feel trapped, and forcing the Syrian Army to shift resources from other areas to defend Damascus.&lt;ref name=nytdam/&gt;

Damascus residents described an atmosphere of tension and fear. Government checkpoints were also so numerous that it was difficult to travel anywhere without passing through one. Emile Hokayem of the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] described the fighting as "part of the strategy of encirclement of the city. The rebels are making a very strong point: that they can go after anything that is seen as critical infrastructure." He expected that the government would be able to reopen the airport and the airport road, but that "the cost of doing so [would] increase over time."&lt;ref name=nytdam /&gt;

Daraya bore the brunt of the Army's offensive due to its proximity to the Presidential complex, which the rebels' rockets missed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/12/31/syria-crisis-damascus-idINDEE8BU06D20121231 | work=Reuters | title=Assad's forces battle to retake Damascus suburb | date=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early January 2013, reports emerged that the military had prior knowledge of the rebel offensive. Based on the information, the Army withdrew on purpose from less strategically significant positions in favor of massing troops to defend Damascus and thus luring rebel forces farther from their supply bases. Due to the Army's retreat and false information leaked to the media on the state of the military, the rebels attacked even before their official start date for the offensive. Once the rebels advanced beyond their supply chains and started attacking the outskirts of the capital, the military used concentrated artillery and air attacks to hit them and inflict the greatest amount of casualties. One of the rebel groups reportedly suffering heavily was the [[Al-Nusra Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/security/01/12/syrian-army-changes-its-military.html|title=Syrian Army May Have Set  Damascus Trap for Rebels|work=Al-Monitor|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/assads-strategy-shift-keeps-rebels-at-gates-of-damascus-8397542.html|title=Assad's strategy shift keeps rebels at gates of Damascus|work=The Independent|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert King Stone''' (December 11, 1822 – April 23, 1872) was a 19th-century [[professor]] at Columbian  College Medical School (predecessor to today's [[George Washington University School of Medicine]]) and was considered "the dean of the [[Washington, DC|Washington]] medical community".&lt;ref name="tli"&gt;[http://www.mrlincolnswhitehouse.org/inside.asp?ID=707&amp;subjectID=2 Robert K. Stone]. The Lincoln Institute&lt;/ref&gt; Stone served U.S. President [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the years of the [[American Civil War]] and was present at Lincoln's deathbed and at his [[autopsy]] in 1865.&lt;ref name="tli"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/eyewitness/html.php?section=13|title=Robert King Stone – Assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, 1865|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]|accessdate=2009-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The son of engraver William J. Stone, Robert King Stone was born in Washington, D.C. He received his medical degree from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1845 and visited major hospitals of London, Paris and Vienna before starting his own medical practice in the United States in 1847. At the time of his death, from [[apoplexy]], he was one of the most prominent physicians in Washington, D.C. He was survived by his wife, Elizabeth J. Stone, who died in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;[http://planning.dc.gov/DC/Planning/Planning%20Publication%20Files/OP/HP/Pending%20Landmarks/Westory%20Building.pdf Westory Building].

A collection of his papers is held at the [[National Library of Medicine]] in Bethesda, Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ulus.nlm.nih.gov/stone118|title=Robert King Stone Papers 1853-1857|publisher=National Library of Medicine}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--
Proposal: include themed headings which describe EVERY current rule of the Contest (rules can be found on the official site).
Detail the milestone rule changes over time.. chronological order.--&gt;

The official '''rules of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]''' are long, technical, and ever-changing. Many of the rules cover technical aspects of the television broadcast itself. However, a few of the more important rules affecting the conduct and outcome of the Contest follow.

==Number of songs==
Each country in the Eurovision Song Contest is entitled to enter just one song. The contest final is limited to 26 songs, apart from in 2015 when 27 countries took part following what was initially meant to be a one-off invite to Australia. Since 2016, Australia have competed in the semi-finals. They consist of the following:

* The "Big 5" countries ({{Esccnty|France}}, {{Esccnty|Germany}}, {{Esccnty|Italy}}, {{Esccnty|Spain}}, and the {{Esccnty|United Kingdom}}) are rewarded with automatic spots in the final.
* The host country.
* 10 qualifiers from Semi-final 1 - held on the Tuesday before the contest.
* 10 qualifiers from Semi-final 2 - held on the Thursday before the contest.

At the first Contest, each country was allowed to submit two songs each with a maximum duration of three minutes. Nowadays, it is still required that each song not exceed three minutes in length, although many artists record the song in a longer version, simply performing a shorter version at the Contest. The number of participating countries has grown throughout the Contest's history, and since [[Eurovision Song Contest 1993|1993]] the rules have been changed several times to both limit the number of finalists and to allow for participation by former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] republics, [[Warsaw Pact]] nations and others.

== No previously published music ==
The entering song is also not allowed to be a [[cover version]], and is not allowed to [[Sampling (music)|sample]] another artist's work. All songs must be completely original in terms of [[songwriting]] and [[instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]], and may not have been released publicly before 1 September of the year preceding.  If released publicly, it may only be released in the entrant country's market until after the contest.

==Voices and instruments==
Artists shall perform live on stage, accompanied by a recorded backing-track which contains no vocals of any kind or any vocal imitations aiming at replacing or assisting the live/original voice of the Contestant(s). The Host Broadcaster shall verify respect for this rule.

No entirely instrumental composition has ever been allowed in Eurovision contests. Norway won the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1995|Eurovision Song Contest in 1995]] with a song focused on its instrumentals, but was eligible for participation because some lyrics (22 words in total) were added. Latvia performed their act [[a cappella]] in 2006, as did Belgium in 2011. Norway's entry in the 2010 Contest, and Austria's 2011 in the contest started a cappella but then the instruments started as well. This rule also played a vital role in Moldova's entry in 2010, as [[SunStroke Project]]'s Epic Sax Guy became a worldwide [[internet phenomenon]]. The group's saxophonist, Sergey Stepanov, had to synchronize his movements with a pre-recorded track that was played during the live performance. Live music has been banned in Eurovision performances since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.andtheconductoris.eu/index.htm?content/eoh.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This rule remains to this day.

==Performers==
Current rules state that countries are allowed to have up to six performers on stage. Performers must be aged 16 or older, on the day of the semi-final in the year of the Contest.&lt;ref name="2005rules"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=''Eurovision.tv (EBU)'' |year=2005 |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/searchfiles_english/574.htm |title=Rules of the 2005 Eurovision Song Contest |accessdate=2008-08-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210010517/http://www.eurovision.tv/searchfiles_english/574.htm |archivedate=2006-02-10 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This rule was introduced in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1990|1990]],  as two contestants the year before had been 11 and 12 years old. The introduction of this rule means that [[Sandra Kim]], who was 13 when she won for [[Belgium in the Eurovision Song Contest|Belgium]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1986|1986]], will remain the youngest winner unless the age limit is lowered. No restriction on the nationality of the performers exists, which has resulted in countries being represented by artists who are not nationals of that country. One of the most well-known winning artists was [[Canadian]] [[Céline Dion]] who represented Switzerland in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1988|1988]]. It should also be noted that the performer only needs to be 16 when the event takes place and not when they are selected, as proven when [[Lindsay Dracass]] was selected to represent the United Kingdom in 2001 and again when [[Triinu Kivilaan]] was selected to represent Switzerland in 2005, despite both of these performers only being 15 at their respective times of selection. In Dracass' case, she had to be issued a special [[Visa (document)|visa]] to enable her to travel to Copenhagen.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Wogan, Eurovision Song Contest 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages==
From the first Contest in 1956 until 1965, and again from 1973 until [[Eurovision Song Contest 1976|1976]] there was no restriction on language. From [[Eurovision Song Contest 1966|1966]] until [[Eurovision Song Contest 1972|1972]], and again from [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978]] until 1998, songs were required to be performed in a national language. The national language rule was actually instituted shortly before the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1977|1977]] Contest, but some countries had already selected non-national language entries, and they were allowed to enter without any changes.

As of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1999|1999]] Contest, the restriction was again lifted, and songs may be performed in any language. As a result, many of the songs are performed partially or completely in [[English language|English]]. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]], Belgium made full use of the so-termed ''free language rule'', and entered a song, "[[Sanomi]]", in an artificial language created especially for the song. This proved successful as the country finished second, only two points behind Turkey. The same tactic was used in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006]] by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] entry Treble which is partially sung in an artificial language and once again by Belgium with their 2008 entry "O Julissi".

===Dialects and regional languages notes per year===
On some occasions, dialects of a language or a very rare language have been used in a song entry:
* [[Eurovision Song Contest 1971|1971]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996|1996]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]] &amp; [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012|2012]] - [[Austria]] sang in various dialects of [[German language|German]] ([[Viennese German|Viennese]] in 1971, [[Vorarlbergisch]] in 1996, [[Styrian]] in 2003 and [[Mühlviertel]] dialect in 2012)
* [[Eurovision Song Contest 1972|1972]] &amp;ndash; [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] sang in [[Irish language|Irish]], one of the two official languages of Ireland
* [[Eurovision Song Contest 1980|1980]] &amp;ndash; The title of [[Norway]]'s entry was in the national minority Sami language
* [[Eurovision Song Contest 1982|1982]] &amp;ndash; [[Germany]] sang in German but after winning performed the reprise in five different languages: [[German language|German]], English, French, Italian and Dutch
* [[Eurovision Song Contest 1989|1989]] &amp;ndash; [[Switzerland]] sang in [[Romansh language|Romansh]], the fourth language of [[Switzerland]]
* [[Eurovision Song Contest 1990|1990]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012|2012]] &amp;ndash; [[Finland]] sang in [[Finland Swedish|Swedish]], which is the country's second official language.
* [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|1991]] &amp;ndash; [[Italy]] sang in [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]], an Italo-Dalmatian language spoken in [[Naples]] and surrounding areas.
* [[Eurovision Song Contest 1992|1992]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 1993|1993]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996|1996]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011]] &amp;ndash; [[France]] sang in the languages of [[Antillean Creole]] (1992), [[Corsican language|Corsican]] (1993 and 2011) and [[Breton language|Breton]] (1996).
* [[Eurovision Song Contest 1995|1995]] &amp;ndash; The introduction of [[Greece]]'s entry was in [[Ancient Greek]].
* [[Eurovision Song Contest 1999|1999]] &amp;ndash; [[Lithuania]] sang in [[Samogitian language|Samogitian]], a dialect of [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]
* [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004]] &amp;ndash; [[Estonia]] sang in [[Võro language|Võro]], which is considered by some to be a dialect of [[Estonian language|Estonian]], and others, a separate language
* [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]] &amp;ndash; In 2003, [[Belgium]]'s [[Urban Trad]] sang "[[Sanomi]]" in a completely made-up language, while the Dutch participants in 2006, [[Treble (girl group)|Treble]], sang half of their song "Amambanda" in a fictional language. In 2008, [[Ishtar (Belgian band)|Ishtar]] performed their song, "[[O Julissi]]" in a fictional language as well.
* [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006]] - [[Monaco]] sang partially in [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]].
* [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009]] - The [[Czech Republic]] sang partially in [[Romani language|Romani]], the language of the [[Romani people]].

* [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016]] - Ukraine decided to send [[Jamala]], a Crimean singer, with her song "[[1944 (song)|1944]]" which featured lyrics in the [[Crimean Tatar language]], which sparked controversy between Russia and Ukraine because of the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]].
* [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016]] - The same year [[Greece]] sent [[Argo (band)|Argo]] with a song in [[Pontic Greek]]. Only the refrain of the song was in English.
* [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018|2018]] - [[Israel]] sang a line in [[Hebrew]].
* [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018|2018]] - [[Serbia]] sang a few lines in [[Torlakian dialect]].

===Language issues and English-language prevalence===
Many European countries were founded on ideas of linguistic unity and because of the sometimes unwelcome dominance of the [[English language]] in modern [[pop music]], the language of a country's Eurovision entry can be a contentious issue.&lt;ref&gt;Ivković, D. (2013). The Eurovision Song Contest on YouTube: A corpus-based analysis of language attitudes. Language@Internet, 10, article 1. (urn:nbn:de:0009-7-35977)&lt;/ref&gt; Some entries are performed in English to reach broader audiences, though this is sometimes looked upon as unpatriotic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.open.edu/openlearn/languages/english-language/language-variety-all-disappears-the-eurovision-song-contest&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years up to 2007 the number of non-English language entrants has decreased, with mostly [[Israel]], [[Ex-Yugoslavia]](Mainly [[Serbia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]) and, [[French language]] countries, [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] performing in their native language. In terms of recent Contest performance, most non-English songs have been far less successful than those in English. Until 2007, the last wholly non-English language winner was [[Israel]]'s [[Dana International]], who performed [[Diva (Dana International song)|Diva]] in [[Israeli language|Hebrew]] in 1998. The 2004 winner, [[Wild Dances (song)|Wild Dances]] performed by [[Ruslana]], was partially sung in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]. After 2007 when [[Marija Šerifović]] won, singing in [[Serbian language|Serbian]], the number of non-English contestants increased again in 2008 - almost half of the performers contested in their native language. The next non-English language winner, [[Amar Pelos Dois]], performed in 2017 by [[Salvador Sobral]], was sung entirely in Portuguese.

In some cases, the lyrics are written and recorded in two different versions (usually English and a national language) or a single multi-language version. Examples include:
* Denmark, where the national selection procedure allows freedom of language, but if the winning song from their national competition is in [[Danish language|Danish]], it must be re-written in English for the competition.
* Sweden, even as there is no outspoken rule the song must be translated into English, it has usually been done so (if allowed in the rules), as in 1965, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2004, and 2006.
* Macedonia, who held a vote to decide whether their 2005 song should be in English or [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]].
* France, whose entry in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2001|2001]] was performed partially in [[French language|French]] and partially in English. The [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007|2007]] entry was sung in [[Franglais]]. The French entry in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]] caused controversy as it was all in [[English language|English]] and people were unhappy about being represented with an English song. In 2012, [[Anggun]] performed her song Echo partly in English but mostly in French. The same happened in 2016, when [[Amir Haddad|Amir]] performed the chorus of his song "J'ai cherché" in English and the rest of the song in French. In 2017, [[Alma (French singer)|Alma]] performs her song "Requiem" partly in English, but mostly in French as well.
* Albania, only allows songs performed in Albanian at "Festival i Këngës", their pre-selection round for the Contest. Afterwards, they often translate the lyrics of their entrant to English.
* Italy, in the Festival della canzone di Sanremo (the Italian Eurovision selections festival) the song must be sing in Italian, the artist theoretically can choose at Eurovision to sing an English translated song, but nobody has chosen to sing the song at Eurovision entirely in English yet (at maximum some stanzas were translated in English).
*Serbia after failing to qualify in 2017 with a song in English Serbian artist must sing in [[Serbian language|Serbian]] at their national selection
*Iceland makes their artists sing in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] for their national selection but they can translate afterward which is the preferred way as with [[Ari Ólafsson|Ari]] in 2018, [[Svala]] in 2017, [[Greta Salóme]] in 2012 and 2016, [[María Ólafsdóttir|Maria Olafs]] in 2015.

==Rule changes by year==
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 1956|1956]]''' First contest - each of the seven competing countries were obliged to hold a national selection final to choose their entries.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 1957|1957]]''' After Italy's song lasted 5:09 minutes, rule changes were introduced to limit maximum song times to three minutes - which still operates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurovision.am/eng/?sub=history |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620124912/http://www.eurovision.am/eng/?sub=history |archivedate=2009-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 1958|1958]]''' The convention of the winning country being invited to host the following year's contest is introduced. However, several countries declined the opportunity in subsequent years.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 1959|1959]]''' Professional publishers or composers were no longer allowed in the national juries.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 1962|1962]]''' Voting system change. Each country had 10 jury members who awarded their three favourite songs 3, 2, and 1 points in order. Previously each of the ten jury members awarded 1 point to their favourite song.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 1963|1963]]''' Jury sizes doubled to 20 and points awarded were 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 1964|1964]]''' Jury sizes revert to 10, and points are now 5, 3 and 1. It becomes possible for a unanimous jury to award all 9 points to one song - but this does not occur. It was also possible to give 6 and 3 points to two songs, this happened only in 1965, when the Belgian jury gave 6 points to the United Kingdom and 3 points to Italy.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 1966|1966]]''' Countries must now sing in one of its national languages.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 1967|1967]]''' Scoring system reverts to the one used between 1957 and 1961. Each of the ten jurors awards a single point to their favourite song - so in theory a country could be awarded all 10 points, although the highest tally allocated under this system was 9 by the Belgian jury for [[Dana Rosemary Scallon|Dana]]'s 1970 winning song.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 1968|1968]]''' Although not a rule change, the contest is broadcast in colour by 6 of the 17 countries competing. It has been available in colour to broadcasters each year since.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 1970|1970]]''' Following a four-way tie in the 1969 contest, a tie-break rule was introduced with provision for a sing-off and a show of hands from the juries to elect a winner.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 1971|1971]]''' Another voting system change. Each country had two jury members, one under 25 and one over 25. They each awarded 1 to 5 points for each song. This created an issue where some juries gave fewer points out than others. The rule permitting groups of up to six performers on stage was introduced. Previously, entrants could only perform solo or as a duet.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=287&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 1973|1973]]''' The rule forcing countries to sing in one of its national languages is relaxed - however this is only in place for 4 years.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974]]''' The scoring system used between 1957 and 1961 and between 1968 and 1970 is restored for a third time.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 1975|1975]]''' The scoring system that still operates today is introduced. Each jury would now give 12 points to the best song, 10 to the second best, then 8 to the third, 7 to the fourth, 6 to the fifth and so forth until the tenth best song (in the jury's opinion) received a single point. Unlike today, the points were not given in order (from 1 up to 12), but in the order the songs were performed.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 1976|1976]]''' As the cost of staging the contest increases, a new rule was introduced that, in future, each participating broadcaster would have to pay a part of the cost of staging the contest.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 1977|1977]]''' Countries must again revert to singing in their own national languages.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 1980|1980]]''' The jury spokesperson now read the points out in numerical order (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 12) rather than in song order.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 1987|1987]]''' As the number of countries reached a record of 22, the EBU imposed a limit on the number of countries competing. Although set at 22, this limit has varied slightly over the years.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 1989|1989]]''' Following the closeness of the result at the 1988 Contest, the tie break rule was amended. If a tie was to occur the winner would be declared on the most 12 points, if that still failed to separate them, the one with the most 10 points.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 1990|1990]]''' Following [[Sandra Kim]]'s 1986 win for Belgium at the age of just 13 and controversy over two performers in 1989 being just 11 and 12 years old, a restriction on competitor's age was introduced. The minimum age is now 16 at the time of the event.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 1993|1993]]''' After the breakup of Yugoslavia, a [[Kvalifikacija za Millstreet|pre-qualifying round]] was introduced.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 1994|1994]]''' Relegation had to be introduced to accommodate the ever-increasing number of countries wishing to compete. Initially the bottom five countries from 1993 would not get an entrant at the 1994 contest. The relegation rules would change slightly over subsequent years.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]]''' After controversy over a 1996 pre-selection procedure (similar to 1993) which resulted in Germany being omitted from the contest, the selection procedure changed to allow only the countries with the best average scores over the previous four years.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]]''' Televoting was trialled in five countries and would become the preferred method of voting from 1998.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 1999|1999]]''' Restrictions are lifted again allowing countries to sing in any language. 
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 1999|1999]]''' Countries preferences to use backing tracks virtually leads to the abolition of orchestras. Live music became optional and all broadcasters since 1999 have declined to use an orchestra. In 2004, all live music was banned; even artists on stage were not allowed to play their instruments live, even if they explicitly voiced their wish to do so. This live music prohibition is still in place.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000]]''' The "[[Eurovision Song Contest#Big Four|Big Four]]" rule is introduced giving France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom automatic entry in the contest regardless of previous performance. In [[ESC 2011|2011]] Italy made comeback becoming a "[[Eurovision Song Contest#Big Four|Big Five]]" member.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004]]''' Relegation rules, which varied slightly since 1994 were dropped and a semi-final was introduced. Countries eliminated in the semi-final were still allowed to vote on the final, so the convention of reading the scores in both French and English were dropped. The spokesperson would now read the score in one language with presenters repeating in the other language.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006]]''' Jury spokespersons no longer read out all the points from 1 up to 12. Instead the scores up to 7 points are displayed briefly before the spokesperson reads out their 8, 10 and 12 point allocations.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]]''' With a record entry of 43, a second semi-final was introduced. Juries were used to allocate a wild-card place in the final from each of the semi-finals. 25 countries now compete in the final.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009]]''' After criticism of the voting system after the 2007 Contest, changes in the voting procedure were made with the re-introduction of a national jury alongside televoting (split 50/50). This format would be extended to the semi-finals in 2010.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 2010|2010]]''' People can vote from the first song until the end of vote.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 2012|2012]]''' The 15-minute televoting window is restored due to criticism of the voting method after the 2011 contest. 26 countries now compete in the final, because Italy made comeback in 2011 and became a "Big Five" country along with Germany, France, Spain and United Kingdom.
*'''[[Eurovision Song Contest 2013|2013]]''' The format of the jury/televoting result is changed slightly in that all songs are now ranked instead of being given a score in each method, this is then merged and the ten highest ranked songs receive points in the usual manner. Also, for the first time, the running order in all three shows is determined by producers of the show instead of a random draw, which is supposed to give each song competing a fair chance of success.
* '''[[Eurovision Song Contest 2015|2015]]''' The EBU considers the possibility of inviting countries outside of the [[European Broadcasting Area]] or the [[Council of Europe]] to participate in future editions of the contest. The first of such "guest nations" was Australia in 2015. This also bumps up the number of countries competing in the final to 27.&lt;ref name=guardian-aus15&gt;{{cite news|title=Eurovision Song Contest invites Australia to join ‘world’s biggest party’|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/feb/10/eurovision-song-contest-invites-australia-to-join-worlds-biggest-party|accessdate=10 February 2015|work=The Guardian|date=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Australia participate"&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia participate in the 60th Eurovision|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=australia_to_participate_in_the_2015_eurovision_song_contest|publisher=EBU|website=Eurovision.tv|accessdate=10 February 2015|date=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016]]''' A new voting system is introduced. Entries now receive one set of points from the jury and one set of points from televoting. First, the jury votes are given in the usual way, giving 1 up to 12 points but with only the 12th being read by the spokesperson. Then, the televotes are read by the presenters, starting with the country receiving the least televotes and ending with the country that received the most televotes, so the winner is not known until the end of the show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/svt-bakom-historisk-forandring-infor-eurovision-song-contest-i-stockholm-2016 SVT Article, 20 Feb 2016 (Swedish)]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the number of countries competing in the final is reduced back to 26 as Australia now competes in the semi-final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia To Return To The Eurovision Song Contest|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=australia_to_return_to_the_eurovision_song_contest|publisher=EBU|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Salzburg State Theatre''' (''Salzburger Landestheater'') is a theatre situated in [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]], a venue for opera, theatre, and dance, contemporary and older works, with resident companies of actors, singers and dancers.  The theatre presents approximately 400 performances each season, from September to June.  The main theatre building is located next to the Mirabell Gardens and seats an audience of 707. The staff consists of 340 people originating from 35 different countries.

The theatre is a listed building and part of the ''[[Altstadt Salzburg|Altstadt]]'', a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].

==History==
In 1775, Prince Archbishop [[Count Hieronymus von Colloredo|Colloredo]] built the 'Prince Archbishop Court Theatre' on the site of the former ballroom of 1625. The official opening of the building was celebrated with Christian Heinrich Schmid’s ''Die Gunst des Fürsten'' which, beholden to enlightenment, was soon followed by [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]’s dramas. [[Emmanuel Schikaneder]] was engaged as director of the Court Theatre for several years.  During this time, he became acquainted with the [[Mozart family]], whom he regularly invited to his box.  Mozart's music was performed there for the first time in 1776.  With the staging of ''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail]]'' in 1784, regular performances of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]’s repertoire began.

[[File:Salzburg-Stadt,-Stadttheater-(1900).jpg|thumb|left|State Theater Salzburg, built by Fellner and Helmer]]
The present building was constructed between 1892 and 1893, designed by the architect duo [[Fellner &amp; Helmer]].  The building was opened on October 1, 1893 with the overture from Mozart’s ''[[La clemenza di Tito]]''.  In this year, [[Max Reinhardt]] had been engaged as an actor in the company, and later co-founded the [[Salzburg Festival]].  Because of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the theatre was closed in 1944.  In 1945, American forces used the theatre as a radio studio. After the war, the theatre was opened to the public again.

With the introduction of the Studio Theatre in the former Mirabell Casino building in October 1971, the theatre acquired a new stage.  Since 2010, there has been a close cooperation between the Salzburger State Theatre and the [[Salzburg Marionette Theatre|Salzburger Marionette Theatre]]. Besides joint productions, the theatre company also performs new productions in the Marionette Theatre’s space, now known as ''Bühne 24''.

Additionally, Salzburg’s Festival Theatres serve as performance locations for State Theatre productions throughout the year while the State Theatre building is used for Salzburg Festival productions during the festival season in the summer months. Another close partnership affiliates the State Theatre with the [[Mozarteum Orchestra Salzburg]] which takes on the role of resident orchestra for the Theatre's musical productions.

Lutz Hochstraate, ''Intendant'' of the theatre from 1986 to 2004, introduced the programme for young audiences.  From 2004 to 2009, Peter Dolder was ''Intendant'', and had a particular focus on the works of [[Thomas Bernhard]].  The current ''Intendant'' of the theatre is Carl Philip von Maldeghem, since 2009.  The current director of opera is Katrin König, and the theatre's music director is Adrian Kelly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://diepresse.com/home/kultur/klassik/5155116/Salzburger-Landestheater_Katrin-Koenig-wird-Operndirektorin | title=Salzburger Landestheater: Katrin König wird Operndirektorin | work=Die Presse | author= | date=2017-01-16 | accessdate=2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6276">The '''Senior Whitehead Prize''' of the [[London Mathematical Society]] (LMS) is now awarded in odd numbered years in memory of  [[J. H. C. Whitehead|John Henry Constantine Whitehead]], president of the LMS between 1953 and 1955. The Prize is awarded to [[mathematician]]s normally resident in the [[United Kingdom]] on 1 January of the relevant year. Selection criteria include work in, influence on or service to [[mathematics]], or recognition of lecturing gifts in the field of mathematics. Previous recipients of top LMS prizes or medals are ineligible for nomination.

==History==
The [[London Mathematical Society]] dates back to 1864. Augustus De Morgan's wife, writing after his death described how the London Mathematical Society was founded:- It was in the year 1864 that Mr Arthur Cowper Ranyard and George [George De Morgan, De_Morgan&gt;Augustus De Morgan's son] were discussing mathematical problems during a walk in the streets, when it struck them that it would be very nice to have a society to which discoveries in mathematics could be brought, and where things could be discussed like the Astronomical Society. It was agreed between the young men that this should be proposed and that George should ask his father to take the chair at the first meeting.&lt;ref name="st-and.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Societies/LMS.html|title=London Mathematical Society|website=www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At a preliminary meeting to discuss setting up the Society on 7 November 1864, the name 'London Mathematical Society' was chosen. This was not the first name which had been proposed which was 'London University Mathematics Society'. De Morgan first proposed that the name be 'University College Mathematics Society' but then, feeling that aiming at a wider membership would be sensible, he proposed 'London Mathematical Society'. In fact this November 1864 meeting was meant to be the first proper meeting of the Society but De Morgan was ill and could not attend. The chair at this preliminary meeting was taken by T A Hirst, the name of the Society was agreed, and the date for the first meeting proper was set for 16 January 1865. At the 16 January 1865 meeting, held in University College, Bloomsbury, north of central London, the chair was taken by Augustus De Morgan who gave the first address setting out what the aims and practices of the Society should be.&lt;ref name="st-and.ac.uk"/&gt; 

This meeting was attended by 27 mathematicians who were joined as members by a further 43 during the first year of the Society. Cayley, Clifford, De Morgan, Hirst, Maxwell, Salmon, Smith, Spottiswoode and Sylvester had all joined by the end of 1865. The first six Presidents of the Society are among the nine mathematicians we have just listed. It is worth noting that, except for De Morgan, who refused a Fellowship of the Royal Society, all presidents of the London Mathematical Society have been Fellows of the Royal Society of London.The Society rapidly expanded and moved away from its initial base in University College. Within two years of the founding of the Society it had moved into Burlington House, Piccadilly, occupying a room in the premises of the Royal Astronomical Society. There was, of course, already a connection with the Royal Astronomical Society since that Society had earlier absorbed the Spitalfields Mathematical Society. The Society rapidly gained international status, and two years after it was founded, in 1867, it instituted a category of honorary foreign member. The first such member was Chasles.From its foundation the Society decided that it would publish a journal, the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society.&lt;ref name="st-and.ac.uk"/&gt; 

Between the first meeting in January 1865 up to November 1866, 37 papers had been presented. However the membership had rapidly increased and the cost of distributing the Proceeding to the members would have been too expensive if all the papers had been published. To keep down costs only eleven of the 37 papers were published. Financial pressures continued on the young Society, largely caused by the high volume of papers it was receiving. Only a donation of £1000 by Rayleigh in 1874 allowed the Society to become financially secure.&lt;ref name="st-and.ac.uk"/&gt; 

The quantity and quality of papers published in the Proceeding was impressive, over 900 papers appearing by 1900.The London Mathematical Society established prestigious prizes early in its existence. Once the finances allowed, the Society began the award of its De Morgan Medal. It was awarded once every three years, the first award being made to Cayley in 1884. The next recipients were Sylvester (1887), Rayleigh (1890), Klein (1893), Roberts (1896), and Burnside (1899).&lt;ref name="st-and.ac.uk"/&gt;

'''Super Bowl LVIII''', the 58th [[Super Bowl]] and the 54th [[AFL–NFL merger|modern-era]] [[National Football League]] (NFL) championship game, will decide the league champion for the 2023 NFL season. The game is scheduled to be played on February 4, 2024 at [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] (with the exact date pending potential changes to the NFL calendar). It will be the eleventh Super Bowl hosted by New Orleans, with the last one being [[Super Bowl XLVII]] in 2013 eleven years earlier, also held at the Superdome.&lt;ref name="sb58sitechosen"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Teope|first1=Herbie|title=Arizona, New Orleans chosen as Super Bowl hosts|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000933935/article/arizona-new-orleans-chosen-as-super-bowl-hosts|publisher=NFL.com|accessdate=May 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Host-selection process==
Super Bowl LVIII, along with [[Super Bowl LVII]], was part of a new awarding process implemented by the league. In the previous process, cities that wished to host a Super Bowl submitted bids, which were deliberated and voted upon at the league owners' meetings. The new process no longer allows cities to bid for the game; the league now chooses the potential candidates. On May 23, 2018, the league selected New Orleans as the site for Super Bowl LVIII.&lt;ref name="sb58sitechosen"/&gt;

== Broadcasting ==
Super Bowl LVIII will be broadcast by a network yet to be announced.  It will be the first game in the league's next [[NFL on television|television contract]]. If the current rotation continues in the next contract, the game will be televised by [[NBC Sunday Night Football|NBC]].

'''Suzette Jordan''' (1974 – 13 March 2015) was a prominent women's-rights activist and [[Anti-rape movement|anti-rape]] campaigner from [[Kolkata]], [[India]]. She herself was a survivor of a gang rape in Park Street, Kolkata. Referred to in the media only as the '''Park Street Rape victim''', she publicly revealed her identity as a survivor of gang rape in 2013 to protest the spate of ongoing rapes and murders of women, and to encourage other survivors to speak out.&lt;ref name="Suzette - BBC"&gt;{{Cite newspaper | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-31865472 | title=Suzette Jordan: India anti-rape campaigner dies after illness | journal=BBC News | date=13 March 2015 | accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzette - NDTV"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/park-street-rape-survivor-suzette-jordan-who-took-on-bengal-government-dies-746256|title=Park Street Rape Survivor Suzette Jordan, Who Took On Bengal Government, Dies|date=13 March 2015|agency=NDTV www.ndtv.com|accessdate=14 March 2015|publisher=ndtv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Indian law, the identity of a victim of rape cannot be revealed without the individual's permission. Until Jordan waived her right to anonymity in June 2013, her case had been dubbed the '[[Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar#Park Street Rape Case|Park Street rape]]' by the Indian media, after the [[Park Street, Kolkata|Kolkata street]] on which the attack took place in February 2012.&lt;ref name = "Suzette - NDTV" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzette - WSJ"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2015/03/13/park-street-rape-victim-suzette-jordan-dies/|title=Park Street Rape Victim Suzette Jordan Dies|date=13 March 2015|agency=The Wall Street Journal blogs.wsj.com|accessdate=14 March 2015|author=Malhotra, Aditi|publisher=blogs.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Jordan originally reported the crime, the [[Chief Minister]] of [[West Bengal]], [[Mamata Banerjee]], called her a liar and accused her of trying to embarrass the government, a position that provoked national outrage.&lt;ref name="Suzette - PTI"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://us.india.com/news/india/park-street-rape-victim-suzette-jordan-dies-in-kolkata-314829/|title=Park Street rape victim Suzette Jordan dies in Kolkata|date=13 March 2015|agency=Press Trust of India india.com|accessdate=14 March 2015|publisher=us.india.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Jordan revealed her identity as a survivor of rape, she said, "Why should I hide my identity when it was not even my fault? Why should I be ashamed of something that I did not give rise to? I was subjected to brutality, I was subjected to torture, and I was subjected to rape, and I am fighting and I will fight."&lt;ref name="Suzette - NDTV" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzette - BBC 1"&gt;{{Cite newspaper | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-22999478 | title=Why an India rape victim disclosed her identity | journal=BBC News | date=21 June 2013 | accessdate=13 March 2015 | author=Jha, Rupa}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of her death, three of the five men accused of raping Jordan inside a moving car had been arrested and were on trial, although they denied the charges.

The '''Swiss Formula Three Championship''' is a Level 2 European [[Formula Three]] car racing series made up of circuit races and also hillclimbs. Despite its name, the bulk of the series events was held in neighbouring countries due to the legal difficulties of organising motorsport events in Switzerland and the lack of available facilities in Switzerland. Most events were held in Italy and France. The series however did have a prominent role in promoting Swiss drivers. The championship folded in 2009, but re-started again in 2014. The Swiss Formula 3 Cup now is a championship run for Swiss drivers only that participate in the Remus Formula 3 Championships, Cup races simultaneously held with the [[Austria Formula 3 Cup]].

'''''The Case of Itaewon Homicide''''' ({{lang-ko|이태원 살인사건}}; [[Transliteration|translit.]]&amp;nbsp;Itaewon Salinsageon) is a 2009 South Korean film, based on the true story of the [[Itaewon murder case]], which shocked Korea when Hongik college student Cho Jung-Pil was found dead at an [[Itaewon]] [[Burger King]] in 1997. The murder was investigated in 1997 by CID Agents J. Choi, D. Zeliff, T. Barnes and B. Crow.  Two troubled U.S. teenagers—Arthur Patterson (the son of a former U.S. Army officer and Korean mother) and Edward Lee—became suspects and were convicted.  Patterson was released a year later in a special amnesty and Lee was freed a year after that due to lack of evidence.  The case never resulted in further convictions. [http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2011/10/11/2011101101121.html] 
It stars [[Jang Keun-suk]] as Arthur Patterson and [[Jung Jin-young]] as his lawyer. [[Song Joong-ki]] played the victim. The film had 531,068 admissions in South Korea nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.koreanfilm.org/films2009.html#boxoffice&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extradition of Arthur Patterson==
With renewed public attention after the movie release, public prosecutors in South Korea reopened the case after discovering DNA evidence purported to show Patterson as the murderer.  Edward Lee had previously testified to Patterson being the murderer during the first trial.  Patterson was re-arrested by U.S. authorities in May 2011 and went before a court hearing in California concerning extradition to Korea for a new trial.  Arthur Patterson's extradition to South Korea was approved and culminated with his arrival at Incheon International Airport, Sep. 2015. [https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/09/23/world/asia/ap-as-skorea-us-murder-suspect.html?ref=aponline]

'''Murder Trial and Conviction'''

During the four-month trial, Patterson repeatedly claimed that he was innocent and accused Lee of having killed Cho. Lee testified as a witness saying that he clearly saw Patterson turn to Cho to stab him. In January 2016, the prosecution sought a 20-year prison term for Patterson, which under Korean law is the maximum sentence able to be handed down to suspects aged 18 or less at the time of their crime.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160129000994&lt;/ref&gt; On January 28, 2016, Patterson was found guilty of the stabbing of the victim, Cho Jung-Pil, and was sentenced to 20 years behind bars. Patterson and his lawyers have said they plan to appeal the verdict.

'''Appeals'''

On Monday, February 1, 2016, local officials in Seoul, South Korea, informed the public that Arthur Patterson lodged an appeal with a higher court. Patterson is still adamantly denying the charges and continues to blame Lee for the stabbing death of Cho Joong-Pil. The appeal will deal with issues such as evidence accepted by the court and its legitimacy, and possible mistakes in the application of law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160201000927&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the previous specials, ''The Wiz Live!'' was televised from [[Grumman Studios]] in [[Bethpage, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/the-wiz-live-nbc-s-latest-live-musical-broadcast-from-long-island-1.11164689|title=‘The Wiz Live!’: NBC’s latest live musical broadcast from Long Island|last1=Crook|first1=John|date=26 November 2015|website=newsday.com |publisher=Newsday|access-date=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of Dorothy was cast via an open audition; on August 5, 2015, it was announced on ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' that Shanice Williams of [[New Jersey]] would fill the role in ''The Wiz Live!''. Williams had co-starred in local productions of ''[[You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown]]'' and ''[[West Side Story]]'' among others, and in 2014, was nominated for a [[Paper Mill Playhouse]] Rising Star Award for best leading actress.&lt;ref name=thr-dorothycasted&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC's 'The Wiz' Finds Its Dorothy|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/shanice-williams-cast-wiz-as-813256|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The special was directed by [[Kenny Leon]] and adapted for television by [[Harvey Fierstein]] from the original musical's book by [[William F. Brown]]. [[Fatima Robinson]] was the program's choreographer, with [[Harvey Mason, Jr.]] and [[Stephen Oremus]] serving as the musical directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://deadline.com/2015/06/fatima-robinson-harvey-mason-jr-stephen-oremus-the-wiz-live-nbc-1201435761/ | title=Fatima Robinson, Harvey Mason Jr &amp; Stephen Oremus Board ‘The Wiz Live!’ | work=Deadline Hollywood | date=1 June 2015 | accessdate=4 November 2015 | author=Petski, Denise}}&lt;/ref&gt; Songs from the original Broadway production were featured, with two exceptions: "[[You Can't Win (song)|You Can't Win]]", a song cut from the musical and first used in its [[The Wiz (film)|1978 feature film adaptation]] as sung by [[Michael Jackson]], was used in place of the Scarecrow's key number "I Was Born on the Day Before Yesterday", and "We Got It",&lt;ref name="NeYoNYPost"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://nypost.com/2015/11/22/ne-yo-my-wiz-live-tin-man-transformation-is-not-comfortable-at-all/ | title=Ne-Yo: My ‘Wiz Live!’ Tin Man transformation is ‘not comfortable at all’ | publisher=New York Post | work=New York Post | date=22 November 2015 | accessdate=23 November 2015 | author=Rorke, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new song composed by Harvey Mason Jr., Stephen Oremus with stars Ne-Yo and Elijah Kelley, was performed as Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion began their journey to find and kill the Wicked Witch of the West.&lt;ref name="AppleStoreSoho"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/SCOOP-THE-WIZ-LIVE-Will-Feature-New-Song-by-NE-YO-Plus-Movie-Tune-for-Scarecrow-20010101 | title=SCOOP: NBC's THE WIZ LIVE!

''The Wiz Live!'' was the first live TV program in US history to contain [[audio description]] for blind or visually impaired viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Foundation for the Blind Celebrates 20th Anniversary of the Helen Keller Achievement Awards and Announces 2016 Honorees|url=http://www.afb.org/info/about-us/press-room/press-release-archive/afb-announces-2016-helen-keller-achievement-awards-honorees-/1245|publisher=American Foundation for the Blind|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marketing===
The cost of a 30-second commercial during ''The Wiz'' ranged between $330,000 to $350,000, marking a drop from the $345,000 to $400,000 cost of ad time during ''Peter Pan Live!''. The decrease in ad cost was attributed to the modest viewership of ''Peter Pan'' in comparison to ''The Sound of Music Live!'', which an analyst felt was a result of the reduced novelty of the production in comparison to ''The Sound of Music''. [[Reddi-wip]] served as a main sponsor of the presentation; [[Walmart]], which served as a major sponsor of NBC's previous live musicals, declined to participate. NBC produced themed commercials to air throughout the special as part of the brand's "Share the Joy" campaign; one, which was timed to air after the corresponding scene in the musical, featured "[[A Brand New Day (The Wiz song)|A Brand New Day]]" being performed by students of the Excel Academy in [[Hyattsville, Maryland]]—a school which [[ConAgra Foods]] had donated money to in support of musical arts.&lt;ref name=bandc-sweetsounds&gt;{{cite web|title=Reddi-Wip Adds Sweet Sounds as ‘Wiz’ Sponsor|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/currency/reddi-wip-adds-sweet-sounds-wiz-sponsor/146081|website=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj-warrroom&gt;{{cite news|title=Wal-Mart’s Peter Pan ‘Warr’ Room|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/12/05/wal-marts-peter-pan-warr-room/|accessdate=4 December 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bandc-walmart&gt;{{cite web|title=Walmart Takes Big Role in 'Peter Pan Live!'|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/currency/walmart-takes-big-role-peter-pan-live/136050|website=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=variety-pushesback&gt;{{cite web|title=Madison Avenue Pushes Back On Price For TV’s Live ‘Wiz,’ ‘Grease’|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/the-wiz-grease-tv-advertising-1201650117/|website=Variety|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=adweek-morelikesom&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC Hopes The Wiz Live Will Be More Like Sound of Music and Less Like Peter Pan|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/television/nbc-hopes-wiz-live-will-be-more-sound-music-and-less-peter-pan-168409|website=Adweek|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Torneo Sangre Nueva''''' ("The New Blood Tournament") is a [[professional wrestling]] tournament promoted by the Mexican [[lucha libre]] promotion [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL), first held in 2012. The tournament focuses primarily on younger wrestlers or wrestlers who work in the lower ranks of the promotion, generally the first or second match of the show, as a way to highlight or promote a wrestler up to a higher level of competition. A total of 27 individuals have competed in the two ''Sangre Nueva'' tournaments held as of 2014 with nine competitors participating in both tournaments held so far: [[Bobby Zavala]], [[Camaleón]], [[El Cholo]], [[Disturbio]], [[Hombre Bala Jr.]], [[Robin (wrestler)|Robin]], [[Soberano Jr.]], [[Stigma (luchador)|Stigma]] and [[Super Halcón Jr.]]. Soberano Jr. is both the youngest competitor over-all (18 years and 206 days old) and the youngest tournament winner as well (19 days and 198 days old), while Cholo is the oldest (40 years and 56 days) at the time of his second tournament participation. Soberano Jr. was the lightest competitor and champion at {{convert|75|kg|lb|abbr=on}} while [[Bronco (wrestler)|Bronco]], at {{convert|103|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, was the heaviest of any tournament competitor so far.

The first ever '''''Torneo Sangre Nueva''''' took place in March 2012. Some of the competitors did not fit the "New Blood" tournaments, but in the case of wrestlers like [[Cancerbero]] and [[Raziel (wrestler)|Raziel]], the [[ring name|ring persona]] he portrayed had only been used for around 2 years, making the character a rookie, but not the man under the mask. CMLL has a history of not openly promoting the fact that some of their workers have worked under different identities previously.&lt;ref name=Mondo&gt;{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha A Go-Go: the bizarre &amp; honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher= HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=Okay... what is Lucha Libre?|pages=29–40|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tournament played out from March 6, 2012, until March 20, 2012, on CMLL's Tuesday shows in Arena Mexico. The first two shows had 8 wrestlers compete for a shot at the finals. Each night the eight wrestlers competed in a "Seeding" battle royal to determine the four on four ''Torneo cibernetico'' elimination match. On the first night [[El Cholo]], [[Soberano Jr.]], [[Cancerbero]], and [[Místico II|Dragon Lee]] comprised one team while [[Bobby Zavala]], [[Titán (wrestler)|Titán]], [[Stigma (luchador)|Stigma]] and [[Camaleón]] on the other. Dragon Lee won the match, lastly eliminating Titán to win the match.&lt;ref name=SangreNuevaA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/lucha-libre/noticias/2012/03/07/se-mantiene-el-reinado-de-la-atlantida|title=Se mantiene el reinado de la Atlantida|date=March 7, 2012|accessdate=October 20, 2012|work=Medio Tiempo|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second block, on March 13, 2012 saw [[Disturbio]], [[Hombre Bala Jr.]], Raziel, and [[Tritón (wrestler)|Tritón]] team up to face [[Robin (wrestler)|Robin]], [[Bronco (wrestler)|Bronco]], [[Hijo del Signo]], and [[Super Halcón Jr.]] Raziel took the victory, eliminating Tritón to end the nearly 25 minute long match to move on to the finals.&lt;ref name=SangreNuevaB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/lucha-libre/noticias/2012/03/14/raziel-a-la-final-de-sangre-nueva|title=Raziel a la Final de Sangre Nueva|date=March 14, 2012|accessdate=October 20, 2012|work=Medio Tiempo|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, on March 20, 2012 Dragon Lee and Raziel faced off in the only three fall match of the night.

;Aftermath
On June 20, 2012, CMLL held a press conference, during which ''lucha libre'' priest [[Fray Tormenta]] announced that since Dragon Lee had impressed him with his in ring performance, Fray Tormenta wanted Dragon Lee to take over the role of [[Místico]], his storyline protégé.&lt;ref name=CMLLMisticoII&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmll.com/noticias.htm|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68aE9QvBg|title=Místico con alma de Dragón.... ¡Las Amazonas del ring en jaula!|publisher=[[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]]|date=June 21, 2012|archivedate=June 21, 2012|accessdate=June 21, 2012|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WVMisticoII&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/viewnews.php?id=1340476258|title=Viva La Raza!

On February 21, 2013, CMLL announced that they were holding another '''''Torneo Sangre Nueva''''' tournament in 2013, possibly making it an annual event. Like the first tournament the 2013 ''Sangre Nueva'' would feature two qualifying ''[[torneo cibernetico]]'' elimination matches with the winner of each facing off in a one-on-one match. In 2013 the ''cibernetico'' match included 10 competitors instead of the eight competitors in the previous year's tournament. The first match took place on February 26, 2013, in [[Arena Mexico]] and saw [[Soberano Jr.]] (son of CMLL wrestler [[Euforia (wrestler)|Euforia]]) outlast [[Camaleón]], [[Stigma (luchador)|Stigma]], [[Horus (wrestler)|Höruz]], [[Hombre Bala Jr.]], [[Akuma (luchador)|Akuma]], [[Espanto Jr. (CMLL)|Espanto Jr.]], [[Herodes Jr.]], [[Cholo (wrestler)|Cholo]] and [[Bobby Zavala]] to qualify for the finals.&lt;ref name=2013BlockA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/lucha-libre/noticias/2013/02/27/soberano-finalista-de-sangre-nueva|title=Soberano, finalista de Sangre Nueva|date=February 27, 2013|accessdate=March 1, 2013|work=Medio Tiempo|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the match Höruz suffered a knee injury as a result of a dive out of the ring, the injury was believed to keep him out of the ring for three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://superluchas.net/2013/03/01/horuz-fuera-de-accion/|title=¡Höruz, fuera de acción!|date=March 1, 2013|accessdate=March 1, 2013|work=SuperLuchas|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Block B competed on March 5, 2013, for the other finalist spot, with a field that included Genesis, [[Oro Jr.]], [[Robin (wrestler)|Robin]], [[Sensei (wrestler)|Sensei]], [[Super Halcón Jr.]], [[Disturbio]], [[Guerrero Negro Jr.]], [[Inquisidor]], [[Taurus (wrestler)|Taurus]] and [[Zayco]]. As with the 2012 ''Torneo Sangre Nueva'', not everyone competing in the tournament fit the "new blood" description; Sensei had worked for CMLL under that ring persona since 2005 and been a professional wrestler even longer. Inquisidor made his professional wrestling in 1995, but only adopted the Inquisidor name and mask in 2008, with CMLL officially not acknowledging his past history before becoming Inquisidor.&lt;ref name=Luchas2000&gt;{{cite news|title=entrevista con Polvora y Inquisidor|work=Luchas 2000|location=[[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]]|id=issue 583|date=August 15, 2008|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second Cibernetico was won by Taurus, son of [[Último Guerrero]] when he was the last wrestler in the ring, eliminating Guerrero Negro Jr. to earn his spot in the finals for the following week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/lucha-libre/noticias/2013/03/06/taurus-segundo-finalista-de-sangre-nueva-2013|title=Taurus segundo finalista de Sangre Nueva 2013|date=March 6, 2013|accessdate=March 6, 2013|work=Medio Tiempo|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week, Sobereano Jr. defeated Taurus, two falls to one to win the 2013 ''Sangre Nueva'' tournament.&lt;ref name=SangreNueva2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://superluchas.net/2013/03/12/soberano-jr-gana-el-torneo-sangre-nueva-2013/|title=Soberano Jr gana el Torneo Sangre Nueva 2013|date=March 12, 2013|accessdate=March 13, 2013|work=SuperLuchas|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{lang|fr|'''"Vive le Québec libre !'''"}} ({{IPA-fr|vivᵊ ləkebɛk ˈlibʁᵊ|lang}}, "Long live free Quebec!") was a controversial phrase in a speech delivered by [[Charles de Gaulle|President Charles de Gaulle]] of France on July 24, 1967, during an official visit to Canada under the pretext of attending [[Expo 67]] in Montreal, Quebec. While giving an address to a large crowd from a balcony at [[Montreal City Hall]], he uttered {{lang|fr|"Vive Montréal ! Vive le Québec !"}} ("Long live Montreal, Long live Quebec!") and then added, followed by loud applause, {{lang|fr|"Vive le Québec {{noitalic|libre}} !"}} ("Long live ''free'' Quebec!") with particular emphasis on the word {{lang|fr|"libre"}}. The phrase, a slogan used by Quebecers who favoured [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec sovereignty]], and de Gaulle's use of it was seen by them as giving his support to the movement. The speech sparked a diplomatic incident with Canada's government, and was condemned by [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Lester B. Pearson]], saying that "Canadians do not need to be liberated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prime Minister Pearson stands up to de Gaulle|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/prime-ministers/lester-b-pearson-from-peacemaker-to-prime-minister/standing-up-to-de-gaulle.html|website=CBC Digital Archives|accessdate=December 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, though many were sympathetic to the cause of Quebec nationalism, de Gaulle's speech was criticized as a breach of protocol. 

==Background==
[[File:Charles de Gaulle-1963.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Charles de Gaulle in 1963]]
Even before his arrival, the [[Government of Canada|Canadian federal government]] had been concerned about President de Gaulle's visit. Earlier that year, the French government had not sent a high-level representative to the funeral service for [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Georges Vanier]].&lt;ref name="Thomson 1988pp188-9"&gt;{{harvnb|Thomson|1988|pp=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt; This attracted notice in Canada, as Vanier and his wife, [[Pauline Vanier|Pauline]], had been personal friends of de Gaulle since 1940, when the latter was in exile in [[London, England]].&lt;ref name="Thomson 1988pp188-9"/&gt; In April, de Gaulle did not attend the 50th anniversary ceremonies commemorating the Canadian victory at [[Vimy Ridge]].&lt;ref name="Vimy Ridge 1967"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; So worried was the Pearson government about potential interference of France in domestic affairs that [[Secretary of State for External Affairs (Canada)|Secretary of State for External Affairs]], [[Paul Joseph James Martin|Paul Martin]], was dispatched to visit de Gaulle in Paris to mend the two countries' relationship. The ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' speculated, 45&amp;nbsp;years after the incident, that de Gaulle was still annoyed over a perceived slight from World War II-era Canadian Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Mackenzie King]]'s slow recognition of the new French government in late summer 1944.&lt;ref name="DeGaulle's Speech 45-years later"&gt;{{cite news

In the spring of 1966, as part of the Expo 67 diplomatic protocols, de Gaulle and all world leaders whose countries had an exhibit at the fair were invited to visit Canada during the spring and summer of 1967.&lt;ref name="Berton 302-303"&gt;{{harvnb|Berton|1967|pp=302–303}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, de Gaulle was also sent a separate invitation to visit Quebec by [[Premier of Quebec|Quebec premier]] [[Daniel Johnson, Sr.|Daniel Johnson]].&lt;ref name="Berton 302-303"/&gt; Although a visiting head of state, the president did not arrive in the Canadian capital, [[Ottawa]], as would be conventional protocol. Instead, he took the time to sail on the French navy's Mediterranean flagship, the cruiser ''[[French cruiser Colbert (C611)|Colbert]]'', so that he could arrive in [[Quebec City]], the capital city of the province of Quebec.&lt;ref name= "Berton (1997)"&gt;{{harvnb|Berton|1997|pp=300–312}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, de Gaulle was cheered enthusiastically, while the new governor general, [[Roland Michener]], was booed by the same crowd when "[[God Save the Queen]]" was played at his arrival.&lt;ref name="De Gaulle lands"&gt;

==Speech==
[[File:Montreal-Canada5884.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Montreal City Hall]]'s balcony where De Gaulle gave his speech.]]
On July 15, before boarding the ''Colbert'', de Gaulle told Xavier Deniau: "They will hear me over there, it will make waves!"&lt;ref name="Thomson 1988" /&gt; He also confided to his son-in-law General [[Alain de Boissieu]] that: "I am going to strike a strong blow. Things are going to get hot. But it is necessary. It is the last chance to rectify the cowardice of France."&lt;ref name="Thomson 1988" /&gt; De Gaulle was referring to what he viewed as France's abandonment of 70,000 French colonists to the British after France was defeated in [[French and Indian War|the North American theatre]] of the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1763.

On July 24, de Gaulle arrived in Montreal and was driven up the ''[[Chemin du Roy]]'' to [[Montreal City Hall]], where Mayor [[Jean Drapeau]] and Premier Johnson waited. De Gaulle was not scheduled to speak that evening, but the crowd chanted for him; he told Drapeau: "I have to speak to those people who are calling for me". According to a number of personal interviews with high-ranking French officials, as well as documents he uncovered,  scholar [[Dale C. Thomson]] wrote that de Gaulle's statement was planned, and that he used it when the opportunity presented itself.&lt;ref name = "Thomson 1988"&gt;{{harvnb|Thomson|1988|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle stepped out onto the balcony to give a short address to the assembled masses which was also broadcast live on radio. In his speech he commented that his drive down the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River]], lined as it had been with cheering crowds, reminded him of his triumphant return to Paris after the [[Liberation of Paris|liberation]] from Nazi Germany. The speech appeared to conclude with the words {{lang|fr|"Vive Montréal ! Vive le Québec !"}} ("Long live Montreal! Long live Quebec!"), but he then added, {{lang|fr|"Vive le Québec libre ! Vive, vive, vive le Canada français ! Et vive la France !"}} ("Long live free Quebec! Long live, long live, long live French Canada! And long live France!"),&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; whereupon the crowd roared with approval, especially after hearing, {{lang|fr|"Vive le Québec libre!"}}. De Gaulle particularly emphasized the use of the word {{lang|fr|"libre"}}, as he leaned into the microphones and enunciated it more slowly and loudly than other elements of his speech.

This statement, coming from the French head of state, was considered a serious breach of [[diplomatic protocol]].&lt;ref name="DeGaulle Flies Home"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; It emboldened the Quebec sovereignty movement, and produced tensions between the leadership of the two countries.&lt;ref name = "40-years later CBC"/&gt; The crowd's reaction to De Gaulle's phrase was emotional, and has been described as frenzied,&lt;ref name = ce/&gt; but it sparked controversy with English Canadians, as many were outraged at the implied threat to Canada's [[territorial integrity]].&lt;ref name="DeGaulle Flies Home" /&gt; [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Lester B.

&lt;/ref&gt;  He said "The people of Canada are free. Every province in Canada is free. Canadians do not need to be liberated. Indeed, many thousands of Canadians gave their lives in two world wars in the liberation of France and other European countries."&lt;ref name="Pearson rebukes De Gaulle"/&gt;

A media and diplomatic uproar ensued thereafter, which resulted in de Gaulle cutting short his visit to Canada.&lt;ref name=ce&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The day after the speech, de Gaulle visited Expo 67 and hosted a banquet at the French pavilion. On July 26, instead of continuing his visit on to Ottawa, where he was scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Pearson, he decided to return to France on a French military jet.&lt;ref name = "Busby 2008"&gt;{{harvnb|Busby|2008|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Expo and departure"&gt;{{cite news |last= Gorrell |first= David |title= Ceremony at Airport Brief but Correct |newspaper= The Globe and Mail |date= July 27, 1967 |location= Toronto |page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly appointed Canadian minister of justice, [[Pierre Trudeau]] publicly wondered what the French reaction would have been if a Canadian Prime Minister shouted, "[[Brittany]] to the [[Breton people|Bretons]]".&lt;ref name = ce/&gt;  From then on, de Gaulle remained unimpressed by Trudeau, saying {{lang|fr|"Nous n'avons aucune concession, ni même aucune amabilité, à faire à M.

&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle was also heavily criticized by a large part of the French media for his breach of international protocol, in particular by ''[[Le Monde]]''.&lt;ref name="French Media Reaction"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, to members of the Quebec sovereignty movement, the speech was viewed as a watershed moment.&lt;ref name = "40-years later CBC"/&gt; Occurring soon after the [[Quiet Revolution]], and taking into account the low economic and political state of [[French Canadian]]s at the time, the support of a foreign head of state seemed to add credibility to the movement in the eyes of many, including future Quebec premier [[René Lévesque]].&lt;ref name="Levesque on Brinkmanship"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

On the flight home from Montreal, de Gaulle told René de Saint-Légier de la Saussaye—his diplomatic counsellor—that the event was "a historical phenomenon that was perhaps foreseeable but it took a form that only the situation itself could determine. Of course, like many others I could have got away with a few polite remarks or diplomatic acrobatics, but when one is General De Gaulle, one does not have recourse to such expedients. What I did, I had to do it."&lt;ref name="Thomson 1988 p243"&gt;{{harvnb|Thomson|1988|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, de Gaulle visited [[Brittany]], during which, in [[Quimper]], he declaimed a poem written by his uncle (also called [[Charles de Gaulle (poet)|Charles de Gaulle]]) in the [[Breton language]], expressing devotion to Breton culture. The speech, well received by the crowd, followed a series of crackdowns on [[Breton nationalism]]. He was accused of double standards for, on the one hand demanding a "free" Quebec because of its linguistic differences from English-speaking Canada, while on the other oppressing the movement in Brittany.&lt;ref name = "Ellis 1993"&gt;{{harvnb|Ellis|1993|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this Quimper speech, he replied to this criticism that Brittany was free and had been freed by Bretons and other French forces during the Liberation, reminding that the [[French Resistance|Resistance]] was more intense in Brittany than in any other part of France, and that many Bretons had joined the [[Free French Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Charles |last= de Gaulle |url= http://www.ina.fr/politique/presidents-de-la-republique/video/CAF88035484/allocution-du-general-de-gaulle-a-quimper.fr.html |via= French National Audiovisual Institute (INA) |title= Allocution du Général de Gaulle à Quimper |trans-title= Speech of General de Gaulle in Quimper |language= fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
