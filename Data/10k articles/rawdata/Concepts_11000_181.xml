'''Ackermann's formula''' is a [[control system]] design method for solving the [[Full state feedback|pole allocation]] problem. One of the primary problems in control system design is the creation of controllers that will alter the dynamics of a system and alter the poles to a more suitable, and sometimes more stable, state. Such a problem can be tackled by many different methods; one such solution is the addition of a feedback loop in such a way that a gain is added to the input with which one can change the poles of the original system. If the system is [[ Controllability|controllable]], an efficient method for pole placement is Ackermann's formula, which allows one to choose arbitrary poles within the system. &lt;ref&gt; Modern Control System Theory and Design, 2nd Edition by Stanley M. Shinners &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uta.edu/utari/acs/ee4314/lectures/Lecture%2022.pdf |format=PDF |title=State variable feedback  |website=Uta.edu |accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State feedback system==
Consider a linear time invariant system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Control_Systems/State_Feedback#Ackerman.27s_formula|title=Control Systems/State Feedback - Wikibooks, open books for an open world|website=en.wikibooks.org|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[state-space representation]]

: &lt;math&gt; \dot{x}(t)=Ax(t)+Bu(t) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; y(t)=Cx(t) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; x(t) &lt;/math&gt; is the state vector, &lt;math&gt; u(t) &lt;/math&gt; is the input vector, and &lt;math&gt; A,B,C &lt;/math&gt; are matrices of compatible dimensions that represent the dynamics of our system, and, for simplicity's sake, assume  &lt;math&gt; D=0 &lt;/math&gt;. An input-output description of this system is given by the [[transfer function]]

: &lt;math&gt; C(sI-A)^{-1}B=C\ \frac{\operatorname{Adj}(sI-A)}{\det(sI-A)}\ B.&lt;/math&gt;

Since  &lt;math&gt;(sI-A)^{-1}=\frac{\operatorname{Adj}(sI-A)}{\det(sI-A)} &lt;/math&gt;,  the denominator of the system is given by the [[characteristic polynomial]] of  &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the poles of the system are the [[eigenvalue]]s of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

If the system is [[Exponential stability|unstable]], or has a slow response or any other characteristic that does not specify the design criteria, it could be advantageous to make changes to it. The realization given by &lt;math&gt;\{A,B,C\}&lt;/math&gt;, however, represents the dynamics of the system, and sometimes cannot be altered. Thus, one approach to this problem might be to create a feedback loop with a gain &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; that will feed the state variable into the input.

If the system is [[Controllability|controllable]], there is always an input &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt; such that any state &lt;math&gt;x_{0}&lt;/math&gt; can be transferred to any other state &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt;. With that in mind, a feedback loop can be added to the system with the control input &lt;math&gt;u(t)=r(t)-Kx(t)&lt;/math&gt;, such that the new dynamics of the system will be 

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}(t)=Ax(t)+B[r(t)+Kx(t)]= [A+BK] x(t)+Br(t)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;y(t)=Cx(t).&lt;/math&gt;

In this new realization, the poles will be dependent on the characteristic polynomial &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{new}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;A-BK&lt;/math&gt;, that is 

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta_\text{new}(s)=\det(sI-(A-BK)).&lt;/math&gt;

==Ackermann's formula==

Computing the characteristic polynomial and choosing a suitable feedback matrix can be a challenging task, especially in larger systems. One way to make computations easier is through Ackermann's formula. For simplicity's sake, consider a single input vector with no reference parameter &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, such as 

: &lt;math&gt;u(t)=-k^T x(t)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\dot x(t)=Ax(t)-Bk^T x(t),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k^T&lt;/math&gt; is a feedback vector of compatible dimensions. Given that the system is still controllable, Ackermann's method states that the design process can be simplified by the following equation: 

: &lt;math&gt;k^T =\left[0\ 0\ \cdots \ 0\ 1\right]\mathcal{C}^{-1}\Delta_\text{new}(A),
&lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt;\Delta_\text{new}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the desired characteristic polynomial evaluated at matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. 

=== Proof===
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/c18/e6-43-13-11.pdf |title=Pole Placement Control |format=PDF |website=Eolss.net |date= |accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Assume that the system is [[Controllability|controllable]]. Defining &lt;math&gt;A_{CL}:=(A-Bk^{T})&lt;/math&gt; gives

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta(A_{CL})=(A_{CL})^n + \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \alpha_k A_{CL}^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Calculating the powers of &lt;math&gt;A_{CL}&lt;/math&gt; results in 

: &lt;math&gt;(A_{CL})^0=(A-Bk^T)^0=I&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(A_{CL})^1 = (A-Bk^T)^1=A-Bk^T&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(A_{CL})^2=(A-Bk^T)^2=A^2-ABk^T-Bk^T A+(Bk^T)^2=A^2-ABk^T-(Bk^T)[A-Bk^T]=A^2-ABk^T-Bk^T A_{CL}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(A_{CL})^n = (A-Bk^T)^n=A^n-A^{n-1} Bk^T-A^{n-2} Bk^T A_{CL}- \cdots -Bk^T A_{CL}^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Replacing the previous equations into &lt;math&gt;\Delta(A_{CL})&lt;/math&gt; yields 

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta(A_{CL})=(A^n-A^{n-1} Bk^T-A^{n-2} Bk^T A_{CL}-\cdots-Bk^T A_{CL}^{n-1})+\cdots+\alpha_2(A^2-ABk^T-Bk^T A_{CL}) + \alpha_1 (A-Bk^T)+\alpha_0I&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta(A_{CL}) =(A^n+\alpha_{n-1}A^{n-1}+\cdots + \alpha_2 A^2+\alpha_1 A+\alpha_0 I)-(A^{n-1}Bk^{T}+A^{n-2}Bk^T A_{CL}+\cdots+Bk^TA_{CL}^{n-1}) + \cdots +\alpha_2 (ABk^T+Bk^T A_{CL})+\alpha_1(Bk^T)&lt;/math&gt;

Noting that &lt;math&gt;(A^n+\alpha_{n-1}A^{n-1} + \cdots + \alpha_2 A^2 + \alpha_1 A+\alpha_0 I)=\Delta(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta(A_{CL})=\Delta(A)-(A^{n-1}Bk^T+A^{n-2} Bk^T A_{CL} + \cdots + Bk^T A_{CL}^{n-1}) + \cdots + \alpha_2 (ABk^T + Bk^T A_{CL}) +\alpha_1 (A+Bk^T)&lt;/math&gt;

Rewriting the above equation as a matrix product and omitting the terms that  &lt;math&gt;k^T&lt;/math&gt; does not appear isolated gives

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta(A_{CL})=\Delta(A)-\left[B\ \ AB\ \ \cdots \ \ A^{n-1} B\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
\vdots\\
k^T
\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

From the [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]],  &lt;math&gt;\Delta\left(A_{CL}\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;, thus

&lt;math&gt;\left[B\ \ AB\ \ \cdots \ \ A^{n-1}B\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
\vdots\\
k^T
\end{array}\right]=\Delta(A)&lt;/math&gt;

Note that  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}=\left[B\ \ AB\ \ \cdots \ \ A^{n-1}B\right] &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Controllability#Continuous linear time-invariant (LTI) systems|controllability matrix]] of the system. Since the system is controllable,  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is invertible. Thus, 

: &lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{c}
\vdots\\
k^{T}
\end{array}\right]=\mathcal{C}^{-1}\Delta(A)&lt;/math&gt;

To find &lt;math&gt;k^{T}&lt;/math&gt;, both sides can be multiplied by the vector &lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;. This yields 

: &lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
\vdots\\
k^{T}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1\end{array}\right]\mathcal{C}^{-1}\Delta(A)&lt;/math&gt;

Thus,

: &lt;math&gt;k^{T}=\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1\end{array}\right]\mathcal{C}^{-1}\Delta(A)&lt;/math&gt;

==Example==

Consider&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/16.31/www/Fall06/1631_topic13.pdf |format=PDF |title=Topic #13 : 16.31 Feedback Control|website=Web.mit.edu |accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; 1\\
1 &amp; 2
\end{array}\right]x+\left[\begin{array}{c}
1\\
0
\end{array}\right]u&lt;/math&gt;

We know from the characteristic polynomial of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; that the system is unstable since &lt;math&gt;det(sI-A)=(s-1)(s-2)-1=(s-1)^2&lt;/math&gt;, the matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; will only have positive eigenvalues. Thus, to stabilize the system we shall put a feedback gain &lt;math&gt;K=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
k_1 &amp; k_2\end{array}\right]. &lt;/math&gt;

From Ackermann's formula, we can find a matrix &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;  that will change the system so that its characteristic equation will be equal to a desired polynomial. Suppose we want &lt;math&gt;\Delta_\text{desired}(s)=s^2+11s+30&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, &lt;math&gt;\Delta_\text{desired}(A)=A^2+11A+30I&lt;/math&gt; and computing the controllability matrix yields

: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
B &amp; AB\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; 1\\
0 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt; and

: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}^{-1}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; -1\\
0 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

Also, we have that &lt;math&gt;A^2=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
2 &amp; 3\\
3 &amp; 5
\end{array}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, from Ackermann's formula

: &lt;math&gt;k^{T}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 &amp; 1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; -1\\
0 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right]\left[\left[\begin{array}{cc}
2 &amp; 3\\
3 &amp; 5
\end{array}\right]+11\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; 1\\
1 &amp; 2
\end{array}\right]+30I\right]&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;k^T=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 &amp; 1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; -1\\
0 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{cc}
43 &amp; 14\\
14 &amp; 57
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 &amp; 1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{cc}
29 &amp; -43\\
14 &amp; 57
\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;k^T=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
14 &amp; 57\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

'''Ayurvedic acupressure''' (also known as '''Marma therapy''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=devQ27EpKTYC&amp;pg=PT449 | title=Principles and Practice of Manual Therapeutics | publisher=Elsevier | author=Coughlin, Patrick | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a particular kind of [[massage]] or an [[Alternative medical system|alternative medical treatment]], which integrates the knowledge of ancient [[Ayurveda]] and the principles of [[acupressure]], allegedly to completely heal and cure physical, mental, emotional and spiritual illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=vF7OKOlH9vsC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=marma+therapy+ayurveda&amp;ots=z3UZ97l9f9&amp;sig=0OGF0JxCBd-Hr4L3xP_wWrHhqzY#v=onepage&amp;q=marma%20therapy%20ayurveda&amp;f=false|title=Ayurveda and Marma Therapy: Energy Points in Yogic Healing|last=Frawley|first=David|last2=Ranade|first2=Subhash|last3=Lele|first3=Avinash|date=2003|publisher=Lotus Press|isbn=9780940985599|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Charaka Samhitā]], an early text on Ayurveda (Indian traditional medicine),  the cosmos and its correspondence – the human body, are composed of both physical (Visible) and metaphysical (Invisible) forces.

Ayurvedic acupressure talks about 10 elements – 5 physical and 5 metaphysical.

* 5 elements(not exactly elements but like forms of matter exists in our body and environment) or Panch Tatva: – Electricity or flow of charges(Not Space as it does not exist in our body and environment) , Air, Fire, Water and Earth.
* 5 metaphysical elements: – Time, Direction, Mind, Soul and Tam (Origin).

In Ayurveda the pressure points or the meridians are called Marma points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=
https://books.google.co.in/books?id=AJkWAQAACAAJ&amp;dq | title=Marma Points of Ayurveda | publisher=Ayurvedic Press | author=Vasant Lad, Anisha Durve}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are considered as energy points, just as Chinese refer them as pressure points, and they help in stimulating not only circulation, but also improve mental and emotional outlook. The Marma points are located throughout the body.

Treatment in Ayurvedic Acupressure can be easily done without needles by:
* Applying pressure with finger
* Seeds
* Magnets
* Colours 
The Acupressure shodh prashikshan evam upchar blakpipol sukh sansthan Allahabad is a non government organization working for the last 20 years in popularizing the Ayurvedic Acupressure

There are many branches of acupressure/acupuncture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=
https://books.google.co.in/books?id=3ewM81mmAngC&amp;dq | title=The Lost Secrets of Ayurvedic Acupuncture | publisher=Lotus Press, 1994 | author=Frank Ros}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as we know it today. They are 
* [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] (TCM) 
* Ayurvedic Acupressure

These are just some of the forms. The scope and theories of each are a bit different.

The '''brahmavihāras''' (sublime attitudes, lit. "abodes of brahma") are a series of four [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] virtues and the meditation practices made to cultivate them. They are also known as the '''four immeasurables''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''apramāṇa'', [[Pali|Pāli]]: ''appamaññā'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhistethics.org/9/wetle021.html Jon Wetlesen, Did Santideva Destroy the Bodhisattva Path? ''Jnl Buddhist Ethics'', Vol. 9, 2002] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228201738/http://www.buddhistethics.org/9/wetle021.html# |date=2007-02-28 }} (accessed March 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi, Bhikkhu. ''Abhidhammattha Sangaha: A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma''. BPS Pariyatti Editions, 2000, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Brahma-viharas'' are: 
# [[metta|loving-kindness or benevolence]] (metta)
# [[Karuṇā|compassion]] (karuna)
# [[Mudita|empathetic joy]] (mudita)
# [[Upekkha|equanimity]] (upekkha)

According to the ''[[Metta Sutta]]'', cultivation of the four immeasurables has the power to cause the practitioner to be reborn into a "[[Brahmā (Buddhism)|Brahmā]] realm" (Pāli: ''Brahmaloka'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.125.than.html AN 4.125, ''Metta Sutta'']. See note 2 on the different kinds of Brahmas mentioned.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Brahma-viharas'', along with meditative tradition associated with ''Brahma-vihara'', are also found in pre-Buddha and post-Buddha [[Vedic]] and [[Sramanism|Sramanic]] literature.

==Etymology and translations==
* Pāli: ''cattāri brahmavihārā''

''Brahmavihāra'' may be [[parsing|parsed]] as "Brahmā" and "[[vihara|vihāra]]"; which is often rendered into English as "sublime" or "divine abodes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an10/an10.208.than.html Thanissaro Bhikkhu].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Apramāṇa'', usually translated as "the immeasurables," means "boundlessness, infinitude, a state that is illimitable".&lt;ref name=PaliDic&gt;[[Thomas William Rhys Davids|Rhys Davids]] &amp; Stede, 1921-25, ''Pali-English Dictionary'', [[Pali Text Society]].&lt;/ref&gt; When developed to a high degree in meditation, these attitudes are said to make the mind "immeasurable" and like the mind of the loving ''Brahmā'' (gods).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, "An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics." Cambridge University Press, 2000, page 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Brahma-vihara''==
The four ''Brahma-vihara'' are:

# [[Upekkha|Equanimity]] (Pāli: ''[[upekkhā]]'', Sanskrit: ''[[upekṣā]]''): is even-mindedness and serenity, treating everyone impartially.&lt;ref name="Fowler1999p60"&gt;{{cite book|author=Merv Fowler |title=Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7UKjtA0QDwC |year=1999|publisher=Sussex Academic Press |isbn=978-1-898723-66-0 |pages=60–62 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=peterharvey2012p154&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey |title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8XAgAwAAQBAJ |year=2012|publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-85126-8 |pages=154, 326 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Buddhism===
The ''Brahma-vihara'' are a pre-Buddhist concept, to which the Buddhist tradition gave its own interpretation.&lt;ref name="Aronson1980p71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google247"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey |title=Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oZCvAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA247|year=2001|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-4411-4726-4 |page=247 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Digha Nikaya]]'' asserts the Buddha to be calling the Brahmavihara as "that practice", and he then contrasts it with "my practice" as follows:&lt;ref name="Aronson1980p71"/&gt;
{{quote|...that practice [namely, the mere cultivation of love and so forth, according to the fourfold instructions] is conducive not to turning away, nor to dispassion, nor to quieting, nor to cessation, nor to direct knowledge, nor to enlightenment, nor to nirvana, but only to rebirth in the world of Brahma.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...my practice is conducive to complete turning away, dispassion, cessation, quieting, direct knowledge, enlightenment, and nirvana – specifically the [[Noble Eightfold Path|eightfold noble path]] (...)
|The Buddha, Digha Nikaya II.251|Translated by Harvey B. Aronson&lt;ref name="Aronson1980p71"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harvey B. Aronson |title=Love and Sympathy in Theravāda Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AYn7WsDccU0C&amp;pg=PA71 |year=1980|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1403-5 |page=71 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Gombrich, the Buddhist usage of the ''brahma-vihāra'' originally referred to an awakened state of mind, and a concrete attitude toward other beings which was equal to "living with Brahman" here and now. The later tradition took those descriptions too literally, linking them to cosmology and understanding them as "living with Brahman" by rebirth in the Brahma-world.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=84-85}} According to Gombrich, "the Buddha taught that kindness - what Christians tend to call love - was a way to salvation.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=62}}

In the ''Tevijja Sutta'', [[Buddhism and Hinduism#Vedas|The Threefold Knowledge]] of the ''Digha Nikaya'' set of scriptures, Buddha Shākyamuni is asked the way to fellowship/companionship/communion with Brahma. He replies that he personally knows the world of Brahma and the way to it, and explains the meditative method for reaching it by using an [[analogy]] of the resonance of the [[conch shell]] of the ''[[Ashtamangala|aṣṭamaṅgala]]'':
{{quote|A monk suffuses the world in the four directions with a mind of benevolence, then above, and below, and all around – the whole world from all sides, completely, with a benevolent, all-embracing, great, boundless, peaceful and friendly mind … Just as a powerful conch-blower makes himself heard with no great effort in all four [cardinal] directions, so too is there no limit to the unfolding of [this] heart-liberating benevolence. This is a way to communion with Brahma.&lt;ref&gt;''Majjhimanikaya'', tr. by Kurt Schmidt, Kristkeitz, Berlin, 1978, p.261, tr. by Tony Page.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Buddha then says that the monk must follow this up with an equal suffusion of the entire world with mental projections of compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity (regarding all beings with an eye of equality).

In the two ''Metta Suttas'' of the ''[[Anguttara Nikaya|Aṅguttara Nikāya]],''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.125.than.html AN 4.125], [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.126.than.html AN 4.126]&lt;/ref&gt; the Buddha states that those who practice radiating the four immeasurables in this life and die "without losing it" are destined for rebirth in a heavenly realm in their next life.  In addition, if such a person is a Buddhist disciple (Pāli: ''[[sravaka|sāvaka]]'') and thus realizes the [[Three marks of existence|three characteristics]] of the [[Skandha|five aggregates]], then after his heavenly life, this disciple will reach ''[[nirvana|nibbāna]]''.  Even if one is not a disciple, one will still attain the heavenly life, after which, however depending on what his past deeds may have been, one may be reborn in a hell realm, or as an animal or [[Preta|hungry ghost]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.125.nymo.html  AN 4.125: ''Metta Sutta: Loving-kindness'', Ñanamoli's translation] (accessed March 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In another sutta in the Aṅguttara Nikāya, the laywoman Sāmāvatī is mentioned as an example of someone who excels at loving-kindness.{{sfn|Bodhi|2012|p=112}} In the Buddhist tradition she is often referred to as such, often citing an account that an arrow shot at her was warded off through her spiritual power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Sāmāvatī|encyclopedia=Dictionary of Pāli Proper Names|date= |year=1938 |publisher=Pali Text Society |location=Wilts|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Visuddhimagga''===
The four immeasurables are explained in [[Visuddhimagga|''The Path of Purification'']] (''Visuddhimagga''), written in the fifth century CE by the scholar and commentator [[Buddhaghosa|Buddhaghoṣa]].  They are often practiced by taking each of the immeasurables in turn and applying it to oneself (a practice taught by many contemporary teachers and monastics that was established after the Pali Suttas were completed), and then to others nearby, and so on to everybody in the world, and to everybody in all universes.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

===''A Cavern of Treasures'' (''mDzod-phug'')===
''A Cavern of Treasures'' ({{bo|t=མཛོད་ཕུག|w=mdzod phug}}) is a Bonpo ''[[terma (Buddhism)|terma]]'' uncovered by Shenchen Luga ({{bo|t=གཤེན་ཆེན་ཀླུ་དགའ|w=gshen-chen klu-dga'}}) in the early eleventh century. A segment of it enshrines a Bonpo evocation of the four immeasurables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/abhidharma-tenet-systems/comparison-of-buddhist-traditions/the-four-immeasurables-in-hinayana-mahayana-and-bon Berzin, Alexander (2005).

==Origins==
Prior to the advent of the Buddha, according to Martin Wiltshire, the pre-Buddhist traditions of ''Brahma-loka'', meditation and these four virtues are evidenced in both early Buddhist and non-Buddhist literature.&lt;ref name="Wiltshire1990p255"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin G. Wiltshire |title=Ascetic Figures Before and in Early Buddhism: The Emergence of Gautama as the Buddha |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WXmmkYQf4RwC&amp;pg=PA248 |year=1990|publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-009896-9 |pages=248–264 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The early Buddhist texts assert that pre-Buddha ancient Indian sages who taught these virtues were earlier incarnations of the Buddha.&lt;ref name="Wiltshire1990p255"/&gt; Post-Buddha, these same virtues are found in the Hindu texts such as verse 1.33 of the ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga Sutras of Patañjali]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Quote: '''मैत्री करुणा मुदितोपेक्षाणां''' सुखदुःखपुण्यापुण्यविषयाणां भावनातश्चित्तप्रसादनम् ॥ ३३॥ - Yogasutra 1.33; [http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_yoga/yogasuutra.html?lang=sa Source], SanskritDocuments.Org&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the four immeasurables, namely Maitri, Karuna and Upeksha, are found in the early Upanishads of Hinduism, while all four are found with slight variations – such as ''pramoda'' instead of ''mudita'' –  in Jainism literature, states Wiltshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin G. Wiltshire |title=Ascetic Figures Before and in Early Buddhism: The Emergence of Gautama as the Buddha |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WXmmkYQf4RwC&amp;pg=PA248 |year=1990|publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-009896-9 |pages=241–242 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Indian ''Paccekabuddhas'' mentioned in the early Buddhist [[Sutra|Suttas]], those who lived before the Buddha, mention all "four immeasurables" and Brahmavihara, and they are claimed in the Suttas to be previous incarnations of the Buddha.&lt;ref name="Wiltshire1990p255"/&gt;

According to Peter Harvey, the Buddhist scriptures acknowledge that the four ''Brahmavihara'' meditation practices "did not originate within the Buddhist tradition".&lt;ref name="google247"/&gt; The Buddha never claimed that the "four immeasurables" were his unique ideas, in a manner similar to "cessation, quieting, nirvana".&lt;ref name="Aronson1980p71"/&gt;

The pre-Buddha [[Chandogya Upanishad]], states Jayatilleke, in section 8.15 teaches metta and ahimsa to all creatures claiming that this practice leads to ''Brahmaloka''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=K N Jayatilleke |title=Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6pBTAQAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-54287-1|pages=477–479 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift in Vedic ideas, from rituals to virtues, is particularly discernible in the early Upanishadic thought, and it is unclear as to what extent and how early Upanishadic traditions of Hinduism and Sramanic traditions such as Buddhism and Jainism influenced each other, on ideas such as "four immeasurables", meditation and Brahmavihara.&lt;ref name="Wiltshire1990p255"/&gt;

In an authoritative Jain scripture, the [[Tattvartha Sutra]] (Chapter 7, sutra 11), there is a mention of four right sentiments: Maitri, pramoda, karunya, madhyastha:
{{quote|Benevolence towards all living beings, joy at the sight of the virtuous, compassion and sympathy for the afflicted, and tolerance towards the insolent and ill-behaved.}}

'''Camille Utterback''' (born 1970 in Bloomington, Indiana) is an internationally acclaimed interactive installation artist. Initially trained as a painter, her work is at the intersection of [[painting]] and [[interactive art]].

==Biography==
[[File:Camille Utterback.jpg|thumb|left|One of Camille Utterback's installations]]

Utterback received her undergraduate degree from [[Williams College]] and her master's degree from the [[Interactive Telecommunications Program]] at [[New York University]]'s [[Tisch School of the Arts]]. She is currently an Assistant Professor of the Art and Art History Department at [[Stanford University]] and lives in [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California.]]

Examples of her work include ''Text Rain'' (1999),&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Christiane (2003). ''Digital Art'' (World of Art series). London: Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-20367-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.camilleutterback.com/textrain.html&lt;/ref&gt; created in collaboration with [[Romy Achituv]], in which participants use their bodies to lift and play with falling letters projected on a wall, and ''Shifting Times'' (2007),&lt;ref&gt;http://camilleutterback.com/projects/shifting-time-san-jose/&lt;/ref&gt; a public installation in San Jose, California that creates interactive projects based on the movements of pedestrians. Helen Lessick describes the latter as a "blending screens of twentieth and twenty-first century San José" in which the "images split and weave, shift between color and black and white, invoking loss and possibility, site and memory." &lt;ref name="Public Art Review"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lessick|first=Helen|title=Beta Test: Innovation in administration at San Jose, California's Norman Y. Mineta Airport|journal=PublicArtReview|date=Spring–Summer 2011|volume=1|series=2|issue=44|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utterback says that she is interested in getting people to “think about the difference between something conceptual and something physical” and to “make a hypothesis, and then test it with their bodies.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Art Installations Find Fertile Ground in Science Centers|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/19/arts/artsspecial/19TECH.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2009-03-17|access-date = 2015-07-25|issn = 0362-4331|first = Julia M.|last = Klein}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her work has been exhibited at the [[New Museum of Contemporary Art]] (New York), the [[Museum of the Moving Image (New York City)|Museum of the Moving Image]] (New York), [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] (Washington, D.C.)&lt;ref name=SAAM&gt;{{cite web|title=Text Rain|url=http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=109552|website=Smithsonian American Art Museum|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GAFFTA]] (San Francisco), the [[Ars Electronica Center]] (Linz, Austria) and the [[NTT InterCommunication Center]] (Tokyo, Japan).

==Awards==

She has received several grants and awards including the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] New Media Fellowship and the [[Transmediale]] International Media Art Festival Award&lt;ref name=Bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Camille Utterback Bio|url=http://camilleutterback.com/vitae/bio/|website=Camille Utterback|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, most recently, a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|"genius award"]] from the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes Digital Artists"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harmanci|first1=Reyhan|date=2010-08-19|title=For Digital Artists, Apps Provide New Palette|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/20/us/20bciart.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="844">A '''closed concept''' is a concept where all the [[necessary and sufficient conditions]] required to include something within the concept can be listed. For example, the concept of a [[triangle]] is closed because a three-sided polygon, and only a three-sided polygon, is a triangle. All the conditions required to call something a triangle can be, and are, listed.

A '''complaint system''' (also known as a '''conflict management system''', '''internal conflict management system''', '''integrated conflict management system''',&lt;ref&gt;See Lynch, below{{full|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''dispute system''') is a set of procedures used in organizations to address complaints and resolve disputes. Complaint systems in the US have undergone several innovations especially since about 1970 with the advent of extensive workplace regulation. Notably in many countries, conflict management channels and systems have evolved from a major focus on labor-management relations to a much wider purview that includes [[labor union|unionized]] workers and also managers, non-union employees, professional staff, students, trainees, vendors, donors, customers, etc.

==History==

There is a substantial early history of scholarly work on [[due process]], and union and non-union [[grievance]] procedures within organizations. This work focused primarily on [[rights]]-based [[conflict resolution]] between union and non-union workers and their managers. Scholarly work has evolved to cover both a wider range of conflict management channels, and, also, a much wider range of disputants.

In the 1970s and 1980s much interest arose in the United States, in dealing with conflict informally as well as formally, and in learning from conflict and managing conflict. In contemporary language, these discussions centered on the "interests" of all who would consider themselves stake-holders in a given conflict—and on systems change—as well as resolving grievances.

These discussions led to questions of how to think about complaint systems and how to link different conflict management offices and processes within an organization. Papers by Ronald Berenbeimmason djordje bentions.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Berenbeim, Non-union Complaint Systems: A Corporate Appraisal (NY: The Conference Board, Report No 770, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary P. Rowe, PhD, "Are You Hearing Enough Employee Concerns?" with Michael Baker, in Harvard Business Review, Vol. 62, No. 3, (May–June, 1984), pp. 127–136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary P. Rowe, "The Non-Union Complaint System at MIT: An Upward-Feedback Mediation Model," in Alternatives to the High Cost of Litigation, Vol. 2, No. 4, (April, 1984), pp. 10–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many authors extended the work of Berenbeim, Rowe, and Rowe and Baker, on the topic of internal complaint systems. They included: Douglas M. McCabe,&lt;ref&gt;"Corporate Non-union Complaint Procedures and Systems" (NY: Praeger, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; [[William L. Ury]], Jeanne M. Brett, and Stephen B. Goldberg.&lt;ref&gt;Ury, William J., Jeanne M. Brett, and Stephen B. Goldberg, Getting Disputes Resolved: Designing Systems to Cut the Costs of Conflict, the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School, Cambridge, MA (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; (Ury, Brett and Goldberg in particular described conflict resolution within organizations in terms of interests, rights and power and the possibility of looping back from rights-based processes to interest-based solutions.) Cathy Costantino and Cristina S Merchant,&lt;ref&gt;Costantino, C. and C.S. Merchant. 1996, Designing conflict management systems. San Francisco&lt;/ref&gt; and Karl A. Slaikeu and Ralph H. Hasson&lt;ref&gt;Slaikeu. K.A. and R.H. Hasson. 1998. Controlling the costs of conflict: How to design a system for your organization. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; extensively explored issues of designing conflict management systems.

The concept of an ''integrated'' conflict management system was conceived and developed by Mary Rowe, in numerous articles in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;See http://web.mit.edu/ombud/publications/ for a list&lt;/ref&gt; She saw the need to offer options for complainants and therefore a linked system of choices within an organizational system.&lt;ref&gt;See "People Who Feel Harassed Need a Complaint System with both Formal and Informal Options" in ''Negotiation Journal'', April, 1990, Vol. 6, No. 2, pp. 161–172.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a systems approach has endured well. In recent years however, there has been discussion as to whether conflict should be "managed" by the organization—or whether the goal is to understand, deal with and learn from conflict. There is also concern about practical and theoretical issues in "integrating" a system, with some observers{{Who|date=November 2010}} preferring the idea of "coordinating" a conflict system. However 2012 research by David Lipsky ''et al.'', suggests that an increasing number of corporations see themselves as having "integrated conflict management systems," or "ICMS."

There is also a major need{{According to whom|date=November 2010}} to collect, review and understand the nature of conflict management and complaint systems around the world. Studies and citations are needed about how complaint systems work for women as well as men. Research is needed as to how systems work for many different national groups, for people of different socio-economic classes, and different ages, and different religions, and especially for contract workers and immigrant workers, in every country. Studies (and citations) are needed about complaint systems in health care, in faith-based organizations, in schools, in political organizations, in the military and in many specialized occupations. Studies are needed{{According to whom|date=November 2010}} about important specialized issues like free speech.

A number of [[artificial intelligence]] technologies are helpful in complaint resolution process, understanding the attitudes of involved parties and reasoning about them, in particular, based on the [[belief–desire–intention model]]. Concept learning is an adequate formalism to reason about complaints.&lt;ref&gt;Boris Galitsky, B. and Josep Lluis de la Rosa ''"Concept-based learning of human behavior for customer relationship management"'' [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025510004007 Information Sciences] Volume 181, Issue 10, 15 May 2011, pp 2016-2035 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8966">'''Cost–utility analysis''' ('''CUA''') is a form of [[financial analysis]] used to guide procurement decisions.

The most common and well-known application of this analysis is in [[pharmacoeconomics]], especially health [[technology assessment]] (HTA).

== Health economics ==
In health economics the purpose of CUA is to estimate the ratio between the cost of a health-related intervention and the benefit it produces in terms of the number of years lived in full health by the beneficiaries. Hence it can be considered a special case of [[cost-effectiveness analysis]], and the two terms are often used interchangeably.

Cost is measured in monetary units. Benefit needs to be expressed in a way that allows health states that are considered less preferable to full health to be given quantitative values. However, unlike [[cost–benefit analysis]], the benefits do not have to be expressed in monetary terms. In HTAs it is usually expressed in [[quality-adjusted life year]]s (QALYs).

If, for example, intervention A allows a patient to live for three additional years than if no intervention had taken place, but only with a quality of life weight of 0.6, then the intervention confers 3 * 0.6 = 1.8 QALYs to the patient. If intervention B confers two extra years of life at a quality of life weight of 0.75, then it confers an additional 1.5 QALYs to the patient. The net benefit of intervention A over intervention B is therefore 1.8 – 1.5 = 0.3 QALYs.

The [[incremental cost-effectiveness ratio]] (ICER) is the ratio between the difference in costs and the difference in benefits of two interventions. The ICER may be stated as (C1 – C0)/(E1 – E0) in a simple example where C0 and E0 represent the cost and gain, respectively, from taking no health intervention action. C1 and E1 would represent the cost and gain, respectively of taking a specific action. So, an example in which the costs and gains, respectively, are $140,000 and 3.5 QALYs, would yield a value of $40,000 per QALY. These values are often used by policy makers and hospital administrators to determine relative priorities when determining treatments for disease conditions. It is important to note that CUA measures relative patient or general population utility of a treatment or [[Pharmacoeconomics|pharmacoeconomic]] intervention. Its results give no absolute indicator of the value of a certain treatment.

The [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) in the UK has been using QALYs to measure the health benefits delivered by various treatment regimens. There is some question as to how well coordinated NICE and NHS are in making decisions about resource allocation. According to a recent study "cost effectiveness often does not appear to be the dominant consideration in decisions about resource allocation made elsewhere in the NHS".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shah|first=K.K|title= Is the aim of the health care system to maximise QALYs? An investigation of 'what else matters' in the NHS|url=http://www.ohe.org/news/2011/05/17/qalys-v-other-criteria-in-nhs-decision-making/%5D|work=OHE Research Paper|publisher=Office of Health Economics|accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While QALYs are used in the United States, they are not utilized to the same degree as they are in Europe.

In the United Kingdom, in January 2005, the NICE is believed to have a threshold of about £30,000 per QALY – roughly twice the mean income after tax – although a formal figure has never been made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, any health intervention which has an incremental cost of more than £30,000 per additional QALY gained is likely to be rejected and any intervention which has an incremental cost of less than or equal to £30,000 per extra QALY gained is likely to be accepted as cost-effective. This implies a value of a full life of about £2.4 million. For end of life treatments, a higher threshold of £50,000 per additional QALY gained is used by NICE.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In North America, a similar figure of US$50000 per QALY is often suggested as a threshold ICER for a cost-effective intervention.

A complete compilation of cost–utility analyses in the peer reviewed medical literature is available at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060925101826/http://www.tufts-nemc.org/cearegistry/ CEA Registry Website]

=== Advantages and disadvantages ===

On the plus side, CUA allows comparison across different health programs and policies by using a common unit of measure (money/QALYs gained). CUA provides a more complete analysis of total benefits than simple [[cost–benefit analysis]] does. This is because CUA takes into account the quality of life that an individual has, while CBA does not.

However, in CUA, societal benefits and costs are often not taken into account. Furthermore, some economists believe that measuring QALYs is more difficult than measuring the monetary value of life through health improvements, as is done with cost–benefit analysis. This is because in CUA you need to measure the health improvement effects for every remaining year of life after the program is initiated. While for [[Cost-benefit analysis]] (CBA) we have an approximate [[value of life]] ($2 million is one of the estimates), we do not have a QALY estimate for nearly every medical treatment or disease.

In addition, some people believe that life is priceless and there are ethical problems with placing a value on human life.

Also, the weighting of QALYs through [[time-trade-off]], standard gamble, or [[visual analogue scale]] is highly subjective.

=== Criticism of cost-utility analysis ===

There are criticisms of QALY. One involves QALY's lack of usefulness to the healthcare provider in determining the applicability of alternative treatments in the individual patient environment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kind|first=P.|author2=Lafata, J. E. |author3=Matuszewski, K. |author4=Raisch, D. |title=The use of QALYs in clinical and patient decision-making: Issues and prospects|journal=Value in Health|date=February 2009|volume=12|issue=S1|pages=S27-S30|doi=10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00519.x|url=http://www.ispor.org/meetings/Invitational/QALY/Paper6.pdf|accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the absence of incorporating the patient's willingness to pay (i.e. [[behavioral economics]]) in decisions to finance new treatments.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]]&lt;/ref&gt;   Another criticism involves age; elderly individuals are assumed to have lower QALYs since they do not have as many years to influence the calculation of the measurement; so comparing a health intervention's impact on a teenager's QALYs to an older individual's QALYs may not be considered "fair" since age is such an important factor. Specific health outcomes may also be difficult to quantify, thus making it difficult to compare all factors that may influence an individual's QALY.
Example: Comparing an intervention's impact on the livelihood of a single woman to a mother of three; QALYs do not take into account the importance that an individual person may have for others' lives.

In the US, the health care reform law ([[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]) has forbidden the use of QALYs "as a threshold to establish what type of health care is cost effective or recommended. Also, "The Secretary shall not utilize such an adjusted life year (or such a similar measure) as a threshold to determine coverage, reimbursement, or incentive programs under title XVIII".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neumann|first=PJ|author2=Weinstein MC|title=Legislating against use of cost-effectiveness information.|journal=N Engl J Med|date=October 2010|issue=16|pages=1495–1497|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1007168|accessdate=24 July 2011|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1007168|pmid=20942664|volume=363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Law 111 – 148 – Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ148/content-detail.html|accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some experts, such as Richard Ward, a lecturer and historian of crime and the reporting of crime at the [[University of Exeter]], have stated the view that the Croydon Cat Killer case is an example of a [[moral panic]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Investigation==
In October 2015 South Norwood Animal Rescue and Liberty (SNARL), a small local group of animal welfare activists based in [[South Norwood]], reported incidents of cat mutilation to the police and [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|RSPCA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/patricksmith/the-crazy-story-of-how-british-police-spent-three-years|title=The Crazy Story Of How British Police Spent Three Years Hunting A Serial Cat Killer Who Didn’t Exist|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/Police-evidence-animals-deliberatley-killed-human/story-28807029-detail/story.html|title=Exclusive: Police have more questions than answers in hunt for 'Croydon Cat Killer'|last=Booth|first=Samantha|date=February 25, 2016|work=Croydon Advertiser|accessdate=April 24, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160226093852/http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/Police-evidence-animals-deliberatley-killed-human/story-28807029-detail/story.html|archivedate=February 26, 2016|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That November, the Metropolitan Police began to investigate the mutilations, under the name "Operation Takahe" and led by Detective Sergeant Andy Collin.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In January 2016 it was reported that 30,000 local people signed a petition requesting the police conduct [[DNA testing]] of the corpses.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/reward-for-capture-of-croydon-cat-killer-increased-to-5000-a6807771.html|title=Reward for capture of Croydon 'cat killer' increased to £5,000|author=Max Shirley|date=12 January 2016|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By February 2016, the deaths of 10 cats (four in Croydon and one each in [[Streatham]], [[Mitcham Common]], [[Sutton, London|Sutton]], [[Charlton, London|Charlton]], [[Peckham]] and [[Finchley]]) had been linked by an examining vet who wished to remain anonymous.&lt;ref name="BBC19Feb" /&gt; However, the police at this time said the number of cases was in single digits &lt;ref name="BBC19Feb" /&gt; In February 2016 it was reported that police had yet to find any evidence that the animals were deliberately killed by a human.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; At this time an investigating vet stated that he found raw chicken in the stomachs of several killed cats and suggested the animals had probably been lured by the killer with the offer of meat.&lt;ref name="BBC19Feb" /&gt; 

In March 2016, Det. Sgt. Collin said that the perpetrator might be only mutilating the corpses after the animals had already died and might only face charges relating to public order or theft. He noted that of the six cases being investigated, five of the cats had not been claimed which would make it difficult to bring charges of theft or criminal damage.&lt;ref name="accident"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/Croydon-Cat-Killer-Cat-mutilations-accidental/story-28836871-detail/story.html|title=Croydon Cat Killer: Cat mutilations after accidental death are not animal cruelty crimes, police say|last=Booth|first=Samantha|date=March 1, 2016|work=Croydon Advertiser|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2016, no human DNA had been recovered.&lt;ref name="accident" /&gt;   

In April 2016 it was reported that the RSPCA believed that the deaths were due to [[blunt trauma]], “likely consistent with being hit by a moving vehicle”&lt;ref name="mystery" /&gt;. SNARL claimed that the animals were killed deliberately, perhaps by being thrown against a wall.&lt;ref name="mystery" /&gt; By April 2016, SNARL had recorded 50 attacks across [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]], [[Mitcham]], [[Streatham]], [[Peckham]], [[Charlton, London|Charlton]], [[Richmond, London|Richmond]], [[Orpington]], and [[Farnborough, London|Farnborough]] in south London, [[Finchley]], [[Tottenham]] and [[Archway, London|Archway]] in north London, [[Stepney]] in the east, and [[Guildford]] in Surrey.&lt;ref name="mystery" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC19Feb" /&gt; SNARL reported that other animals including foxes and rabbits have been attacked in the same way.&lt;ref name="mystery" /&gt; 

In June 2016, SNARL speculated that there had been 100 kills following a decapitated cat being found in [[Morden]].&lt;ref name="morden"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/campaigners-fear-croydon-cat-killer-8103988|title=Has the 'Croydon Cat Killer' claimed 100th victim?|last=Dyer|first=Chris|date=2016-06-02|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time police stated that they had spent 1,020 hours on the inquiry since December 2015.&lt;ref name="metro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/09/09/croydon-cat-killer-linked-to-seven-animal-murders-this-week-alone-6914734/|title=Croydon cat killer linked to seven animal murders this week alone|date=9 September 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By July 2016, the media and SNARL had begun referring to the attacker as the "M25 Cat Killer" after new reports, including a cat killed in [[Whyteleafe]], Surrey, suggested the killer was operating around the [[M25 motorway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/croydon-cat-killer-widened-brutal-8414154|title=Croydon Cat Killer has widened brutal spree around the M25, say police|last=Alexander|first=Stian|date=2016-07-13|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; After reports of animal deaths in [[Maidstone]], [[Sevenoaks]] and seven other locations, SNARL adopted the terms "M25 Animal Killer" and "UK Cat Killer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/sevenoaks/news/croydon-cat-killer-otford-sevenoaks-m25-animal-100914/ | title=Has 'Croydon Cat Killer' killed pet in Otford, near Sevenoaks? | work=Kent Online | date=17 August 2016 | accessdate=19 August 2016 | author=Elvey, Suz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/london/2016-08-17/new-attack-linked-to-croydon-cat-killer/|title=New attack linked to 'Croydon Cat Killer'|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Det. Sgt. Collin, speaking in 2017 about a possible motive stated “Cats are targeted because they are associated with the feminine... The killer can't deal with a woman or women who are troubling him”. He added that he was worried that “at some stage he'll escalate or feel brave enough to move on to vulnerable women and girls.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Vince Egan, associate professor of [[forensic psychology]] at the [[University of Nottingham]] has said: “In some individuals we have seen animal cruelty as part of a broader pattern in which humans are also harmed. It is far more likely that this reflects a rather more banal pattern of anti-social behaviour, such as drunkenness or something that doesn’t go further. But when we have so little to go on you have to keep your mind open.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/fears-grow-as-croydon-cat-killer-casts-net-more-widely-a6898961.html|title=Fears are growing as the Croydon cat killer casts a wider net|date=26 February 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, [[ArroGen Veterinary Forensics]] began re-examining some animals to help the police and RSPCA to bring prosecutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/29/croydon-cat-killer-forensic-science-lab-to-re-examine-animal-deaths|title=‘Croydon cat killer’: forensic science lab to re-examine deaths|last=Grierson|first=Jamie|date=2017-09-29|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-01|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017 it was reported that the killer was suspected of mutilating over 370 animals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Det. Sgt. Collin stated that it was possible there were [[Copycat crime|copycats]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/croydon-cat-killer-british-pets-mutilated-two-year-murder-spree-still-at-large-a8027461.html|title='Croydon cat killer' suspected of mutilating 370 pets over two years|date=2017-10-30|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, police linked five cat deaths around [[Northampton]] from August to November that year to the same killer, but later police stated the Northampton deaths were not being linked to the others though a 31-year-old man had been arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-42608115|title=Cat deaths not linked to Croydon killer|date=15 June 2018|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2018|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was reported in August 2018 that, three years after the first report of the Croydon Cat Killer, no evidence relating to an individual who may be committing the alleged crimes had been found. There was no evidence found of clothing, human DNA or a murder weapon and no CCTV footage had been recovered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In September 2018, the Metropolitan Police reported that in three instances where CCTV footage was obtained, foxes could be seen carrying bodies or body-parts of cats. In one case, CCTV showed a fox carrying a cat's head into a school playground at Catford. In post-mortem examinations conducted by the Head of Veterinary Forensic Pathology at the [[Royal Veterinary College]], fox DNA was found on the cats bodies.&lt;ref name="met" /&gt;  The Met closed the investigation on September 20th, saying foxes mutilating the bodies of cats that died in road traffic accidents was the most likely explanation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/croydon-cat-killer-unmasked-police-reveal-culprits-after-three-year-investigation-and-500-deaths-a3940956.html Croydon cat killer unmasked: Met Police reveal culprits after three year probe and 500 deaths... are foxes], Evening Standard, September 20, 2018.

==Reactions==
In February 2016, the animal rights charity [[PETA]] offered a £5,000 reward (raised from an initial £2,000 in December 2015) to anyone providing information to the police that leads to the arrest and conviction of the serial cat killer (or killers).&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="peta"&gt;{{cite web|title=PETA Offers £5,000 Reward to Help Catch ‘Cat Ripper of Croydon’|url=http://www.peta.org.uk/blog/peta-offers-5000-reward-to-help-catch-cat-ripper-of-croydon/|publisher=PETA UK|accessdate=15 February 2016|author=|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public figures local to Croydon such as [[Martin Clunes]], [[Dermot O'Leary]] and [[Caroline Flack]] used their social media accounts to raise awareness of the crime in the hope it would lead to an arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Croydon Cat Killer: Celebrities join the fight to catch the culprit|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/croydon-cat-killer-celebrities-join-the-fight-to-catch-the-culprit-a3163901.html|publisher=The Standard|accessdate=15 February 2016|author=Hannah Al-Othman|date=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an email to [[Metropolitan Police Commissioner]], Sir [[Bernard Hogan-Howe]], actor Clunes wrote, "As someone who shares my home with several four-legged companions I read with horror that some of the cats had been decapitated, disemboweled or dismembered – this is the stuff of nightmares."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The hunt for the Croydon serial cat killer|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/643394/Hunt-Croydon-serial-cat-killer|publisher=The Daily Express|accessdate=15 February 2016|author=Virginia Blackburn|date=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, [[Vice Media]] released a half-hour documentary about the purported cat killer and SNARL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/7bdywb/croydon-cat-killer-snarl|title=Meet the Pet Detectives Hunting for the Croydon Cat Killer|date=2016-03-14|work=Vice|access-date=2018-08-10|language=en-uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cases were featured in [[The Met: Policing London]] - Series 2, Episode 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=The Met: Policing London - Series 2, Episode 4|date=2017-06-14|work=BBC One|access-date=2018-09-21|language=en-uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, about 20,000 people were outraged from Metropolitan Police's announcement to close the case of Croydon Cat Killer. Vinnii West, who started the petition says the Metropolitan Police admitted the deaths of cats were attributed to cars and foxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/nearly-20000-sign-petition-urging-met-to-reopen-croydon-cat-killer-case-a3944206.html|title=Nearly 20,000 sign petition urging Met to reopen Croydon cat killer case|work=Evening Standard|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scepticism ==
In July 2018, Stephen Harris, retired professor of environmental sciences at the [[University of Bristol]], who had studied fox behaviour for 50 years&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/08/croydon-cat-killer-hunt-three-years-man-myth|title=The ‘Croydon cat killer’ hunt has lasted three grisly years. But is he man or myth?|last=Usborne|first=Simon|date=2018-08-08|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote an article in ''[[New Scientist]].'' He asserted that there is no "killer" and the pattern of blunt-force trauma followed by removal of the head and tail once the blood has congealed is consistent with [[Roadkill|road traffic accidents]] then scavenging by foxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2173998-prolific-m25-serial-killer-beheading-cats-is-an-old-feline-foe/|title=Prolific ‘M25 serial killer’ beheading cats is an old feline foe|date=July 11, 2018|work=New Scientist|last=Harris|first=Stephen}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s there was a similar panic following the discovery of dozens of cat deaths in Greater London. The [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|RSPCA]] sought Harris’s advice at this time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Those events led to the Metropolitan police opening Operation Obelisk in 1998. However, they quietly dropped the case in 1999 after Harris inspected several cats. He concluded that they had been killed by cars and mutilated by foxes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Harris stated “We have known for decades that foxes chew the head or tail off carcasses, including dead cats”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Parallels have been drawn between the Croydon Cat Killer and [[moral panic]]s, in which public fear and lurid headlines amplify perceptions of danger which puts pressure on authorities to act.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Richard Ward, lecturer and historian of crime and the reporting of crime at the [[University of Exeter]] has stated that the creation of Operation Takahe appears to be the result of such a moral panic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Early life and education==
Hickton was born on August 14, 1955 in [[Columbus, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lawyercentral.com/david-j-hickton-interactive-profile--20-563329.html Lawyer Central.com profile]&lt;/ref&gt; He received his undergraduate degree from Pennsylvania State University and his [[Juris Doctor]] degree from the [[University of Pittsburgh School of Law]],&lt;ref name="UTimes" /&gt; where he met his wife [[Dawne Hickton|Dawne Eileen Sepanski Hickton]].&lt;ref name="Tribune-Review"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://triblive.com/news/adminpage/5152245-74/hickton-law-david|title=Pitt law clinic to help low-income seniors endowed by $1 million grant|last=Tribune-Review|website=TribLIVE.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Career==
Hickton began his legal career as a law clerk for U.S. District Judge [[Gustave Diamond]] from 1981 to 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2009/10/27/Hickton-believed-to-be-frontrunner-for-U-S-attorney/stories/200910270268|title=Hickton believed to be frontrunner for U.S. attorney|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; For eleven years, Hickton was an adjunct professor at the [[Duquesne University School of Law]], where he taught a course on [[competition law|antitrust law]]. He served on the Board of Trustees at [[Penn State University]] from 1977-1980.

He was nominated as [[United States Attorney]] for Western Pennsylvania by President [[Barack Obama]] on May 3, 2010, and confirmed by the U.S. Senate on August 5, 2010.

In May, 2014, Hickton's office brought an indictment against five members of the [[Chinese People's Liberation Army]], alleging economic espionage. The defendants were charged with hacking into American entities to steal trade secrets and other information that would be useful to Chinese competitors. Victims included [[Westinghouse Electric Company]], the [[U.S. Steel]], [[Alcoa]], Inc., and [[Allegheny Technologies]].&lt;ref name="Allegheny Technologies" /&gt; His office also indicted Russian hacker [[Evgeniy Bogachev]], one of the world's leading cyber criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Pittsburgh Officials Indict International Cyber-Criminal"|url=http://wesa.fm/post/pittsburgh-officials-indict-international-cyber-criminal#stream/0|accessdate=24 April 2017|agency=WESA-FM|publisher=Liz Reid|date=June 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, his office, in cooperation with the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and legal authorities in 19 other countries, shut down [[Dark0de]], a [[Computer crime|cybercrime]] [[Crime forum|forum]] and [[black market]]place for [[security hacker]]s. Darkode offered [[malware]] to disrupt operations in computer systems in several countries, and offered stolen data ranging from U.S. [[Social Security number]]s to passwords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/major-computer-hacking-forum-shut-down-by-20-countries-us-announces/2015/07/15/dd4cf514-2b05-11e5-a5ea-cf74396e59ec_story.html|title="Major computer hacking forum shut down by 20 countries, U.S. announces"|date=July 15, 2015|publisher=Ellen Nakashima|agency=The Washington Post|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, Hickton and his office brought forth a 21 count indictment of conspiracy, [[money laundering]], [[wire fraud]], and [[identity theft]] against Cuban national Yoandy Perez Llanes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdpa/pr/alleged-upmc-hack-co-conspirator-extradited-us|title=Alleged UPMC Hack Co-conspirator Extradited to U.S.|website=www.justice.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2016, Mr. Llanes was extradited from Venezuela to the U.S., and later in 2017, Llanes and a cohort Soler Nodarse&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law360.com/articles/947101/venezuelan-sentenced-for-2-2m-tax-fraud-with-hacked-info|title=Venezuelan Sentenced For $2.2M Tax Fraud With Hacked Info - Law360|website=www.law360.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;, plead guilty for their part in a $2.2 million scheme where hackers stole an estimated 62,000 tax forms of [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center|UPMC]] employees and sold them on the dark web.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2017/04/17/Cuban-Yoandy-Llanes-pleads-guilty-stolen-UPMC-IDs-tax-refunds/stories/201704170110|title=Cuban national pleads guilty in tax scam that used stolen UPMC IDs|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|access-date=2017-08-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While U.S. Attorney for Western Pennsylvania, Hickton was named to co-chair a national Heroin Task Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Federal prosecutor to co-chair national Heroin Task Force"|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/17/federal-prosecutor-to-co-chair-national-heroin-tas/|accessdate=24 April 2017|agency=Associated Press, Joe Mandak|publisher=New Pittsburgh Courier|date=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, he formed the U.S. Attorney's Working Group on Addiction: Prevention, Intervention, Treatment, and Recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Regional task force on drug addiction nears final report"|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/news/state/2014/08/15/Regional-task-force-on-drug-addiction-nears-final-report/stories/201408150030.print|accessdate=24 April 2017|agency=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|publisher=Rich Lord|date=August 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="dangers of opioids" /&gt; His office worked with the University of Pittsburgh to post information online about lethal batches of heroin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="U.S. Attorney, Pitt working to prevent ODs by posting heroin info online"|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/news/state/2014/08/15/Regional-task-force-on-drug-addiction-nears-final-report/stories/201408150030.print|accessdate=24 April 2017|agency=Pittsburgh Tribune Review|issue=February 3, 2016|publisher=Brian Bowling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Hickton assembled a Community Police Working Group to help build trust between members of law enforcement and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David J.

In 2015, Pittsburgh was selected by Attorney General [[Loretta Lynch]] as one of six pilot cities for the National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gross|first1=Emma|title="U.S. Attorney General Addresses Pittsburgh's Community-Police Relationships"|url=http://wesa.fm/post/us-attorney-general-addresses-pittsburgh-s-community-police-relationships#stream/0|accessdate=26 April 2017|publisher=WESA-FM|date=August 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a three-year investigation, Hickton secured fundamental changes in the [[Pennsylvania Department of Corrections]] (PDOC) to humanely address the issues of unconstitutional confinement conditions for those suffering from serious mental illness and for victims of institutional sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tricountysentry.com/blog/justice-department-closes-investigation-against-pennsylvania-department-of-corrections/|title=Justice Department Closes Investigation Against Pennsylvania Department of Corrections|work=Tri County Sentry – The Tri-County's Only Muliticultural Newspaper|access-date=2017-04-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also initiated a case study in police-community reconciliation in the neighborhood of Homewood.&lt;ref name="Lord2013" /&gt;

In 2015, Hickton led an investigation of [[Education Management Corporation]] (EDMC), which resulted in the recovery of $95.5 million, the largest [[False Claims Act]] (FCA) recovery of Department of Education funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2015/11/16/EDMC-reaches-nearly-100-million-settlement-with-federal-state-prosecutors-over-recruiting-practices/stories/201511170011|title=EDMC reaches nearly $100 million settlement with prosecutors over recruiting|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2016, Hickton successfully prosecuted former CEO and founder of [[Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School]] Nicholas Trombetta, who plead guilty of conspiracy, where he took approximately $8 million of educational funds for illegal use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://triblive.com/news/adminpage/11025531-74/trombetta-cyber-charged|title=Cyber charter's former CEO agrees to plea deal in criminal case|last=Bowling|first=Brian|website=TribLIVE.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2016/08/24/PA-Cyber-Charter-founder-Trombetta-pleads-guilty-to-tax-conspiracy/stories/201608240177|title=After three years of fighting charges, PA Cyber founder admits tax fraud|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Hickton also lead the prosecution of Michael J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6804">Groups of working individuals are typically classified based on the colors of their '''collars''' worn at work; these can commonly reflect one's occupation or sometimes gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Benczes|first1=Réka|title=Creative Compounding in English: The Semantics of Metaphorical and Metonymical Noun-Noun Combinations|date=2006|publisher=John Benjamins|location=Amsterdam|pages=144–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[White-collar worker]]s are named for the white-collared shirts that were fashionable among office workers in the early and mid-20th century. [[Blue-collar worker]]s are referred to as such because in the early 20th century, they usually wore sturdy, inexpensive clothing that didn't show dirt easily, such as blue [[denim]] or [[cambric]] shirts. Various other "collar" descriptions exist as well.

==White collar==
{{main|White-collar worker}}
The term "white-collar worker" was coined in the 1930s by [[Upton Sinclair]], an American writer who referenced the word in connection to clerical, administrative and managerial functions during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 3rd edition. Electronically indexed online document. White collar, usage 1, first example.&lt;/ref&gt; A white-collar worker is a salaried professional, typically referring to general office workers and management. However, in certain developed countries like the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Canada]], a person is assumed to be a white-collar worker when one engages in a highly professional and successful career or works in either an administrative or managerial role.

==Blue collar==
{{main|Blue-collar worker}}
A blue-collar worker is a member of the [[working class]] who performs manual work and either earns an hourly wage or is paid piece rate for the amount of work done.  This term was first used in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Wickman, Forrest. [http://www.slate.com/articles/business/explainer/2012/05/blue_collar_white_collar_why_do_we_use_these_terms_.html "Working Man's Blues:  Why do we call manual laborers blue collar?"] [[Slate.com]], 1 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pink collar ==
{{main|Pink-collar worker}}
A pink-collar worker is also a member of the working class who performs in the [[service industry]]. They work in positions such as [[Waiting staff|waiters]], [[retail clerk]]s, [[salesperson]]s, and many other positions involving relations with people. The term was coined in the late 1990s as a phrase to describe jobs that were typically held by women; now the meaning has changed to encompass all service jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, Kathleen (February 17, 2015) [http://www.businessinsider.com/pink-collar-jobs-dominated-by-women-2015-2 "20 jobs that are dominated by women"] ''[[Business Insider]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/pink-collar "Pink collar"] ''Dictionary.com''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tennery, Ann (Mat 23, 2012) [http://business.time.com/2012/05/23/the-term-pink-collar-is-silly-and-outdated-lets-retire-it/ "The Term 'Pink Collar' Is Silly And Outdated — Let’s Retire It"] ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other classifications==
Some job categories involve duties that fall under one or more of the categories listed above, or none of the above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Work in America: M-Z|pages=597|year=2003|isbn=9781576076767|publisher=ABC-Clio Ltd|location=CA, USA|last=Van Horn|first=Carl|last2=Schaffner|first2=Herbert}}&lt;/ref&gt; These categories include:

* [[Gold-collar worker|Gold collar]] – Highly skilled professionals who may be in high demand, such as company secretary, chartered accountants, surgeons, anesthesiologists, engineers and lawyers.
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Red collar}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;– [[Civil service|Government workers]] of all types;&lt;ref name=puneet /&gt; derived from compensation received from red ink budget. Also in China, refers to [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] officials in private companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Red-Collars in Private Companies|url=http://www.bjreview.com.cn/17thCPC/txt/2007-06/25/content_78050.htm|website=Beijing Review|accessdate=14 April 2015|date=Jun 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Grey-collar|Grey collar]] – Skilled technicians, typically someone who is both white and blue collar; an example is information technology workers. They are principally white-collar, but perform blue-collar tasks with some regularity, such as engineers. May also be used to refer to old aged workers after retirement age.
* [[New-collar worker|New collar]] - develops technical and soft skills needed to work in the contemporary technology industry through nontraditional education paths
* No collar – Artists and "free spirits" who tend to privilege passion and personal growth over financial gain. This term was popularized on the reality game show ''[[Survivor: Worlds Apart]]'', which used No Collar (in addition to White and Blue Collar as the tribal divisions);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feinberg|first1=Daniel|title=Recap: 'Survivor: Worlds Apart' Premiere - 'It's Survivor Warfare'|url=http://www.hitfix.com/the-fien-print/recap-survivor-worlds-apart-premiere-its-survivor-warfare|website=Hitfix|publisher=Hitfix, Inc.|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; also, people who work, but not for payment.&lt;ref name=puneet /&gt;

* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Orange collar}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; – [[Prison labor]]ers, named for the orange jumpsuits commonly worn by inmates.&lt;ref name=puneet /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pandeli|first1=Jenna|title=Title: Orange collar workers: an exploratory study of modern prison labour and the involvement of private firms|website=University of Bristol|accessdate=14 April 2015|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Scarlet collar}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; – Workers in the [[sex industry]]&lt;ref name=puneet /&gt;
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Black collar}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; – [[Manual labor]]ers in industries in which workers generally become very dirty, such as mining or oil-drilling;&lt;ref name=puneet&gt;Biseria, Puneet (May 20, 2015) [http://www.biseriapuneet.com/topics/topics/681-types-of-collar-jobs "Types of Collar"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich, Thomas (2013) ''Hitler's Berlin: Abused City'' Spencer, Stewart (trans). New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-300-16670-5}}. p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; has also been used to describe [[Crime|workers in illegal professions]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2327">In [[mathematics]], a [[topological group]] ''G'' is called the '''topological direct sum'''&lt;ref&gt;E. Hewitt and K. A. Ross, Abstract harmonic analysis. Vol. I, second edition, Grundlehren der Mathematischen Wissenschaften, 115, Springer, Berlin, 1979. MR0551496 (81k:43001)&lt;/ref&gt; of two [[subgroup]]s ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; if
the map
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
H_1\times H_2 &amp;\longrightarrow G \\
(h_1,h_2)     &amp;\longmapsto     h_1 h_2
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
is a topological isomorphism.

More generally, ''G'' is called the direct sum of a finite set of [[subgroup]]s  &lt;math&gt;H_i, i=1,\ldots, n&lt;/math&gt; of the map
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\prod^n_{i=1} H_i&amp;\longrightarrow G \\
(h_i)_{i\in I}    &amp;\longmapsto     h_1 h_2 \cdots h_n
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that if a topological group ''G'' is the topological direct sum of the family of subgroups &lt;math&gt;H_i &lt;/math&gt; then in particular, as an abstract group (without topology) it is also the [[Direct sum of groups|direct sum]] (in the usual way) of the family &lt;math&gt;H_i &lt;/math&gt;.

==Topological direct summands==
Given a topological group ''G'', we say that a subgroup ''H'' is a '''topological direct summand''' of ''G'' (or that '''splits topologically''' from ''G'') if and only if there exist another subgroup ''K''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''G'' such that ''G'' is the direct sum of the subgroups ''H'' and ''K''.

A the subgroup ''H'' is a topological direct summand if and only if the [[Extension of a topological group|extension of topological groups]]

:&lt;math&gt;0 \to H\stackrel{i}{{} \to {}} G\stackrel{\pi}{{} \to {}} G/H\to 0&lt;/math&gt;

splits, where &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is the natural inclusion and &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is the natural projection.

==Examples==

*Suppose that &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Locally compact group|locally compact abelian group]] that contains the [[unit circle]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb T&lt;/math&gt; as a subgroup. Then &lt;math&gt;\mathbb T&lt;/math&gt; is a topological direct summand of ''G''. The same assertion is true for the [[real numbers]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Armacost, David L.

The '''duck test''' is a form of [[abductive reasoning]]. This is its usual expression: 
{{quote|If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably ''is'' a duck.}}
The test implies that a person can identify an unknown subject by observing that subject's habitual characteristics. It is sometimes used to counter [[wikt:abstruse|abstruse]], or even valid, arguments that something is not what it appears to be.

== History ==
[[Indiana]] poet [[James Whitcomb Riley]] (1849–1916) may have coined the phrase when he wrote:
{{quote|When I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heim|first=Michael |title=Exploring Indiana Highways  |pages=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j7zds6xx7S0C&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=%22james+Riley%22+OR+%22James+Whitcomb+Riley%22+bird++duck&amp;num=100| isbn=978-0-9744358-3-1 | year=2007 | publisher=Exploring America's Highway}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A common variation of the wording of the phrase may have originated much later with Emil Mazey, secretary-treasurer of the [[United Auto Workers]], at a labor meeting in 1946 accusing a person of being a communist:

{{quote|I can’t prove you are a Communist. But when I see a bird that quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, has feathers and webbed feet and associates with ducks—I’m certainly going to assume that he ''is'' a duck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Milwaukee (WI) Sentinel|title=Communist Expose  The Case of the Duck|date=September 29, 1946|author=Sentinel, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term was later popularized in the United States by [[Richard Cunningham Patterson Jr.]], [[Ambassadors from the United States|United States ambassador]] to [[Guatemala]] in 1950 during the [[Cold War]], who used the phrase when he accused the [[Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán]] government of being [[Communist]]. Patterson explained his reasoning as follows:

{{quote|Suppose you see a bird walking around in a farm yard. This bird has no label that says 'duck'. But the bird certainly looks like a duck. Also, he goes to the pond and you notice that he swims like a duck. Then he opens his beak and quacks like a duck. Well, by this time you have probably reached the conclusion that the bird is a duck, whether he's wearing a label or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|given=Richard H.|surname=Immerman|year=1982|title=The [[CIA]] in Guatemala: The Foreign Policy of Intervention|page=102|publisher=[[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas Press]]|place=[[Austin, Texas]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later references to the duck test include Cardinal [[Richard Cushing]]'s, who used the phrase in 1964 in reference to [[Fidel Castro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first1=Joseph|last1=Denver|author2=Ethel Franklin Betts|year=1965|title=Cushing of Boston: A Candid Portrait|publisher=|place=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Platt|first=Suzy |title=Respectfully quoted|publisher=[[Library of Congress]], Congressional Research Service|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Tu3bScwKKAC&amp;pg=PT267&amp;dq=%22when+I+see+a+bird+that+walks+like+a+duck+and+swims%22&amp;ei=eL3cSYazBJKqMpG_6bMO | isbn=978-0-88029-768-4}} ''"Attributed to Richard Cardinal Cushing. Everett Dirksen and Herbert V. Prochnow, Quotation Finder, p. 55 (1971). Unverified."''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Douglas Adams]] parodied this test in his book ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]'':
{{quote|If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, we have at least to consider the possibility that we have a small aquatic bird of the family [[Anatidae]] on our hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Douglas|title=Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A claimed recent application of the duck test was the denial of tax exempt "nonprofit" status to [[Blue Shield of California]].{{efn-ua|"In a startling blow to one of California's biggest health insurers, the state has revoked the tax-exempt status of Blue Shield of California, forcing the company to pay tens of millions of dollars in back taxes and unleashing a torrent of calls for it to return billions of dollars to customers. 
The tax board's action 'was an acknowledgment of what Blue Shield was already doing, or not doing,' said Anthony Wright, head of Health Access California, a consumer advocacy group. 'And if it looks like a duck and talks like a duck, it should be taxed like a duck."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=California drops hammer on Blue Shield tax-exempt status

The [[Liskov Substitution Principle]] in computer science is sometimes expressed as a counter-example to the duck test:
{{quote|If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck but it needs batteries, you probably have the wrong [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Derick|last=Bailey|title=SOLID Development Principles – In Motivational Pictures|url=http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2009/02/11/solid-development-principles-in-motivational-pictures/}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Sergey Lavrov]] used a version of the Duck Test in 2015 in response to allegations that Russian airstrikes in Syria were not targeting terrorist groups, primarily [[ISIS]], but rather West-supported groups such as the Free Syrian Army. When asked to elaborate his definition of 'terrorist groups', he replied:
{{quote|If it looks like a terrorist, if it acts like a terrorist, if it walks like a terrorist, if it fights like a terrorist, it's a terrorist, right?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Melvin|first1=Don|last2=Cullinane|first2=Susannah|last3=Tawfeeq|first3=Mohammed|title=Russia's Lavrov on Syria targets: 'If it looks like a terrorist, walks like a terrorist ...'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/01/middleeast/russia-syria/|accessdate=9 July 2016|publisher=CNN|date=October 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;!--[[Elephant test]] redirects directly here.--&gt;Similarly, the term '''''elephant test''''' refers to situations in which an idea or thing, "is hard to describe, but instantly recognizable when spotted".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edge.ai/Edge-International-1130480.html Valuing and Judging Partners — Beyond the Elephant Test!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603040024/http://www.edge.ai/Edge-International-1130480.html |date=2013-06-03 }}, Edge International Review, Summer 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is often used in legal cases when there is an issue which may be open to interpretation,&lt;ref&gt;B.Wedderburn, The Worker and the Law (3rd ed, Harmondsworth, Penguin,1986), 116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Barnard, [http://www.jil.go.jp/english/events_and_information/documents/clls04_barnard2.pdf The Personal Scope of the Employment Relationship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126221317/http://www.jil.go.jp//english/events_and_information/documents/clls04_barnard2.pdf |date=2013-01-26 }}, in T.Araki and S.Ouchi (eds), The Mechanism for establishing and Changing Terms and Conditions of Employment/The Scope of Labor Law and the Notion of Employees, The Japan Institute for Labour Policy and Training Report, 2004, vol.1, 131-136. &lt;/ref&gt; such as in the case of ''Cadogan Estates Ltd v Morris'', when [[Lord Justice]] Stuart-Smith referred  to "the well known elephant test. It is difficult to describe, but you know it when you see it",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1998/1671.html Cadogan Estates Ltd v Morris]; EWCA Civ 1671 (4 November 1998) (at paragraph 17)&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''Ivey v Genting Casinos'', when Lord Hughes (in discussing dishonesty) opined "like the elephant, it is characterised more by recognition when encountered than by definition."  ''Overruling'' in part [[R v Ghosh]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2016-0213.html Ivey v Genting Casinos (UK) Ltd t/a Crockfords]; [2017] UKSC 67 (25 Oct 2017) (at paragraph 48)&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar incantation (used however as a rule of exclusion) was invoked by the concurring opinion of Justice [[Potter Stewart]] in ''[[Jacobellis v. Ohio]]'', 378 U.S. 184 (1964), an obscenity case.  He stated that the Constitution protected all obscenity except "hard-core pornography". Stewart opined, "I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description; and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But [[I know it when I see it]], and the motion picture involved in this case is not that."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15888">'''The [[family]] as a model for the organization of the [[State (polity)|state]]''' is a theory of [[political philosophy]].  It either explains the structure of certain kinds of state in terms of the structure of the family (as a model or as a claim about the historical growth of the state), or it attempts to justify certain types of state by appeal to the structure of the family.  The first writer to use it (certainly in any clear and developed way) was [[Aristotle]], who argued that the natural progression of human beings was from the family via small communities to the [[polis]].

Many writers from ancient times to the present have seen parallels between the family and the forms of the state. In particular, [[Monarchy|monarchists]] have argued that the state mirrors the [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] family, with the people obeying the [[Monarch|king]] as children obey their father.

==Ancient Greek thought==
The family&amp;ndash;state model was first expressed in ancient times, often as a form of justification for [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] rule.

[[Plutarch]] records a laconic saying of the [[Dorians]] attributed to [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]].  Asked why he didn't establish a democracy in the Lacedæmon, Lycurgus responded: “Begin, friend, and set it up in your family”. The Dorians of Crete and Sparta seemed to mirror the family institution and organization in their form of government. (see Plutarch's ''The Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans'' &amp;mdash; Lycurgus, p.&amp;nbsp;65)

[[Aristotle]] often describes personal and domestic relationships in terms of different forms of government. He gives examples such as men and their domestic animals, wives, slaves, and children. He says, for example: “the government of a household is a monarchy, since every house is governed by a single ruler”.(2)  Later in the same text he says that husbands exercise a [[republic]]an government over their wives and monarchical government over their children, and that they exhibit political office over slaves and royal office over the family in general. (''Politics'' Bk I, §v, 1&amp;ndash;2; 1259a 35&amp;ndash;1259b 1)

However, while he is prepared to use political terms as metaphors for domestic relationships, he is equally clear that such metaphors are limited:
:“Some thinkers, however, suppose that statesman, king, estate manager, and master of a family have a common character.  This is a mistake; they think that the distinction between them is not a difference in kind, but a simple, numerical difference.” (''Politics'' Bk I, §i)&lt;!-- standardise translations, &amp; add full reference here and following --&gt;
After discussing the various domestic relationships, he concludes: “mastership and statesmanship are not identical, nor are all forms of power the same, as some thinkers suppose.” (''Politics'' Bk I, §vi)

Aristotle's main notion is that the ancient Greek ''polis'' or city-state is the natural end of human beings; they start in family groups, progress naturally to forming villages, and finally come together in cities.  Thus the family forms the root of human relationships, but the city is the flower.

[[Arius Didymus]] in Stobaeus, 1st century CE, writes: “A primary kind of association (politeia) is the legal union of a man and woman for begetting children and for sharing life.”  From the collection of households a village is formed and from villages a city, “&lt;nowiki&gt;[s]&lt;/nowiki&gt;o just as the household yields for the city the seeds of its formation, thus it yields the constitution (politeia)”. Further, he claims: “Connected with the house is a pattern of monarchy, of aristocracy and of democracy.  The relationship of parents to children is monarchic, of husbands to wives aristocratic, of children to one another democratic.” (''Hellenistic Commentary to the New Testament'', edd Boring, Berger, &amp; Colpe)

==Confucian thought==
{{main|Role ethics}}

[[Confucius]] believed the child should be subordinate to the parent, younger brother to the older, wife to husband, and subject to the sovereign who is to be regarded as the [[father of the nation]]. The state as the family writ large was the most harmonious, orderly, and natural form of government. This was later expanded to cover [[international relations]] (e.g. the [[emperor of China]] is treated as the older brother of the [[list of Korean monarchs|Korean king]]). Confucian family theory is still espoused in [[North Korea]] to justify their method of leadership succession.

The concept of family is important in classical [[Confucianism]]. For Confucius, ''xiào'' or [[filial piety]] was a ''[[De (Chinese)|dé]]'' or [[virtue]]. The character representing ''xiào'', 孝, itself represents a basic family structure, with the upper component representing elders (''lao'', old), and the lower representing children (''zi'', son). Those acting with filial piety, such as through the performances of ''[[Li (Confucian)|lĭ]]'' were therefore acting in accordance with ''[[Yi (Confucianism)|yì]]'' (righteousness, or fulfilling one's proper roles or acting in harmony with one's station). The relationship of this concept to the state is discussed at length in the ''Xiàojīng'', or [[Classic of Filial Piety]]. In politics, ''xiào'' is not simply loyalty on the part of subordinates and citizens, but also an expectation for the king to provide for his subjects with "paternal love"; just as the people were expected to act with respect for the king's law, the king was expected to make those laws out of kindness for the people.&lt;ref&gt;Confucius.

American [[Edmund Roberts (diplomat)|diplomat Edmund Roberts]] in his description of [[Guangzhou|Canton City]], which he visited in 1832, included a quote on this, for which he gives no source, but which was subsequently include in latter 18th-century publications, again without a source:&lt;blockquote&gt;The sovereign of men, say they, "is heaven's son; nobles and statesmen are the sovereign's children; the people are the children of nobles and statesmen. The sovereign should serve heaven as a father, never forgetting to cherish reverential thoughts, but exciting himself to illustrate his virtues, and looking up to receive from heaven, the vast patrimony which it confers; thus the emperors will daily increase in felicity and glory. Nobles and ministers of state should serve their sovereign as a father, never forgetting to cherish reverential thoughts, not harbouring covetous and sordid desires, nor engaging in wicked and clandestine thoughts, but faithfully and justly exerting themselves; thus their noble rank will be preserved. The people should never forget to cherish reverential thoughts towards the nobles and ministers of state, to obey and keep the laws; to excite no secret or open rebellion; then no great calamity will befall their persons."&lt;ref name = "Roberts"&gt;{{cite book

==Modern thought==
[[Louis de Bonald]] wrote as if the family were a miniature state. In his analysis of the family relationships of father, mother and child, De Bonald related these to the functions of a state: the father is the power, the mother is the minister and the child as subject. As the father is “active and strong” and the child is “passive or weak”, the mother is the “median term between the two extremes of this continuous proportion”. De Bonald justified his analysis by quoting and interpreting passages from the [[Bible]]:

:“&lt;nowiki&gt;[It]&lt;/nowiki&gt; calls man the ''reason'', the ''head'', the power of woman: ''Vir caput est mulieris'' {man is head of woman} says St Paul.  It calls woman the helper or ''minister'' of man:  ‘Let us make man,’ says Genesis, ‘a helper similar to him.’  It calls the child a ''subject'', since it tells it, in a thousand places, to obey its parents”. (''On Divorce'' pp&amp;nbsp;44&amp;ndash;46)

De Bonald also sees divorce as the first stage of disorder in the state (the principle of [[macrocosm/microcosm]]). He insists that the ''deconstitution'' of the family brings about the deconstitution of state, with “[[The Kyklos]]” not far behind. (''On Divorce'', pp&amp;nbsp;88&amp;ndash;89; 149.)

[[Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn]] draws a connection between the family and monarchy:

:“Due to its inherent patriarchalism, monarchy fits organically into the ecclesiastic and familistic pattern of a Christian society.  (Compare the teaching of Pope [[Leo XIII]]: 'Likewise the powers of fathers of families preserves expressly a certain image and form of the authority which is in God, from which ''all paternity in heaven and earth receives its name'' &amp;mdash; Eph 3.15')  The relationship between the King as 'father of the fatherland' and the people is one of mutual love”. (''Liberty or Equality'', p.155)

==Politics and the family==
In her book, ''Delacroix, Art and Patrimony in Post-Revolutionary France'', Elisabeth Fraser analyses [[Eugène Delacroix]]'s famous “Massacres of Chios” (1824), which helped galvanise [[philo-Hellenism]] in France. Delacroix's symbol for the oppressed Greek nation was a family employed as a conceptual and visual structuring device. A reviewer encapsulated Fraser's argument:
:“Equating patriarchal family metaphor with government paternalism and imperialist protectionism, the chapter argues that such familial intimations, heightened by acute emotionalism and hints of a Western culture soiled by Eastern penetration, corresponded to and reflected a paternalistic government urge to protect the victimized Greeks, a thinly veiled justification for French colonial intervention in the Mediterranean.” [http://www.kunstform.historicum.net/2005/02/4653.html Nina Athanassoglou-Kallmyer]

More recently, [[George Lakoff]] has claimed that the [[left-right politics|left/right distinction]] in politics comes from a difference between ideals of the family in the mind of the person in question; for [[right-wing]] people, the ideal is a patriarchical and moralistic family; for [[left-wing]] people, the ideal is an unconditionally loving family. As a result, Lakoff argues, both sides find each other's views not only immoral, but incomprehensible, since they appear to violate each side's deeply held beliefs about personal morality in the sphere of the family.[https://web.archive.org/web/20020416055642/http://www.texasobserver.org/showArticle.asp?ArticleID=515].

Such a model is not a recent addition to modern discourse; J. Vernon Jenson discussed “British Voices on the Eve of the American Revolution: Trapped by the Family Metaphor” in the ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' 63 (1977), pp&amp;nbsp;43&amp;ndash;50.

The idea of the [[commonwealth]] as a family is close to [[cliché]]; it permeates political discourse at every level:

:“There is an historic American National Family metaphor .. That American National Family frame is like any real extended family-fractious but in the end functional. There are people in it who aren't just like you, but they are still family and we still have to try to solve our problems together, despite our differences.” &amp;mdash; [http://metaphorproject.org/our-one-big-family-frame/           Susan C. Strong, ''Our 'One Big Family' Frame'']

'''Fixed repeating schedule''' is a key element of the [[Toyota Production System]] and [[lean manufacturing]]. As its name suggests it is a production schedule which is 'unchanging' and repeated perhaps daily or over a longer period such as two weeks or month. If it can be implemented, economies of repetition start to become evident and suppliers and customers can be assured in their own activity scheduling. What impedes this being implemented is the uncertainty of demand and supply. Therefore whilst the scheduling becomes simple, the activities to make the scheduling possible become more complex. Thus the planning to move to FRS reveals issues which, if managed correctly, will reduce complexity overall and improve customer service.

== History ==

Fixed repeating schedules have been invented all over the place by many organisations as local solutions. Perhaps Ford's early production technique was a trivial example since by ensuring only one product, the black model T, the scheduling became simple as well.

The first widely publicised example with a systematic development was in the [[Toyota Production System]] where an FRS smooths flow in the factory and therefore reduces the waste of unevenness (or [[Mura (Japanese term)|mura]]).

== Implementation ==
=== Step 1: red stream/green stream ===

Since in all but the trivial example of constant demand there will actually be fluctuations in required production, FRS is only part of a scheduling solution. The challenge in the early steps of implementation is to isolate the maximum part of production that can be fixed from the part of production that cannot. This isolation, at least in the early stages, should extend to the supporting services as well as the value adding process or [[gemba]] itself. Thus procurement, stock keeping, deliveries and so on should be run separately for the fixed and non-fixed schedules. For example, this means two procurement 'contracts'; one for fixed deliveries of fixed amounts at regular intervals and one for deliveries as otherwise requested. If this disciple in not complete then the uncertainties in the unfixed side will 'leak' back into the fixed side which will then become unfixed for lack of resources.

To enforce this separation some factories have actually split the factory into two different parts with each part being represented and painted a different colour. This separation went as far as painting forklift trucks, tools, floor areas and stock containers in their corresponding colour as well as selecting staff based upon their temperament to work on one side or the other. The German factory director believed it was as close as he could come to actually running two factories, one FRS and the other flexible.

The benefit of this work was the significant cost decreases that occurred in the FRS 'factory' which far outweighed the slight increase in costs in the flexible 'factory'. In the FRS 'factory' all costs and activities will be repeated which allows significant process simplifications and time and cost reductions to occur across all functions. This is because the 'exceptions' to the standard process will no longer occur and schedules will always be achieved so that process failure 'safety net' processes and equipment and staff can be eliminated or re-deployed.

These benefits only accrue whilst the green stream/FRS products or services remain predictable in demand. Therefore it is critical to ensure appropriate frequency reviews of product demand to ensure promotion of stable products from the red stream and demotion of now less stable demand products to the red stream. This may follow product maturity curves where, after initial introduction, when demand stabilises products move into the FRS and then later, when purchase enthusiasm wanes, they are removed again. Seasonality can be built into FRS by having, for example, a summer and a winter fixed schedule.

=== Step 2: speed up the FRS ===

The implementation of step 1 will have allowed people in the 'FRS' factory to run simpler processes and to establish routines that were not possible in the schedule, reschedule, reschedule world that existed before, and may still exist in the 'non-FRS factory'. This will make the work more manageable and simplify the communications in the 'factory' that are so critical to performance. Because of this it will become much clearer what sub-processes are limiting production capability and therefore which operations can be simplified and improved. It is often the case that large stock levels pre-existed, or were built to make FRS 'possible', the actual causes of these stocks can now be addressed by operational improvements to reduce lot sizes and improve reliability. Once these have been done and supporting services have also adjusted then the aim is to shorten the period of the repeat in 'FRS'. This planning and then action will surface new issues along the lines of the earlier phase which should in their turn be managed as a priority. The shortening of the cycle will allow the reduction of finished goods and WIP stocks as well whilst maintaining availability of stocks for customers. This cycle should be repeated until management nerve breaks.

For Toyota the implementation of a fixed repeating schedule is one of the early steps in achieving [[production levelling]] which follows further steps to achieve lower lot sizes gain the lower costs and flexibility this makes possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6890">In psychology, a '''fluency heuristic''' is a mental [[heuristic]] in which, if one object is processed more fluently, faster, or more smoothly than another, the mind infers that this object has the higher value with respect to the question being considered.&lt;ref name="JacobyBrooks1984"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacoby|first1=Larry|last2=Brooks|first2=Lee|chapter=Nonanalytic cognition: Memory, perception and concept formation|year=1984|title=The psychology of learning and motivation|volume=18|pages=1–48|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|editor-last=Bower|editor-first=Gordon H|editorlink=Gordon H. Bower|ISBN=978-0125433181}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the more skillfully or elegantly an idea is communicated, the more likely it is to be considered seriously, whether or not it is logical.

==Research==

Jacoby and Dallas (1981) found that if an object "jumps out" at a person and is readily perceived, then they have likely seen it before even if they do not consciously remember seeing it.&lt;ref name="JacobyDallas1981"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacoby|first1=Larry|last2=Dallas|first2=Mark|title=On the relationship between autobiographical memory and perceptual learning|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|volume=110|issue=3|year=1981|pages=306–340|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.110.3.306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''As a proxy for real-world quantities:'''

Hertwig et al. (2008) investigated whether retrieval fluency, like [[Recognition heuristic|recognition]], is a proxy for real-world quantities across five different reference classes in which they expected retrieval fluency to be effective.&lt;ref name="Hertwig2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hertwig|first1=Ralph|last2=Herzog|first2=Stefan M.|last3=Schooler|first3=Lael J.|last4=Reimer|first4=Torsten|title=Fluency heuristic: A model of how the mind exploits a by-product of information retrieval|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=2008|volume=34|issue=5|pages=1191–1206|doi=10.1037/a0013025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

a) cities in the U.S with more than 100,000 inhabitants

b) the 100 German companies with the highest revenue in 2003

c) the top 106 music artists in the U.S. in terms of cumulative sales of recordings from 1958 to 2003

d) the highest paid athletes of 2004

e) the 100 wealthiest people in the world

Hertwig et al. measured response time latencies for participants presented with each object. The names of objects were presented in random order and participants were asked if they recognized each object.  Hertwig et al. found that differences in recognition latencies are indicative of criteria across five different environments. The strength of the relationship varied across environments. Environments with low ecological validity such as the companies and music artists environments yielded low levels of fluency across five environments. The resulting data provides evidence for the idea that we can at least theoretically infer distal properties of the world.&lt;ref name="Hertwig2008"/&gt;

'''Are people able to exploit retrieval fluency?'''

To exploit retrieval fluency, people need to be able to judge accurately whether recognizing object a's name takes longer than recognizing object b's name, or vice versa. Hertwig et al. investigated the extent to which people can accurately tell such differences apart. They observed three results: First, people prove to be quite good at discriminating between recognition latencies whose differences exceeds 100 ms. Second, even when taking less-than perfectly accurate discriminations into account, subjective fluency judgments are a moderately good predictor of the criterion, except in environments in which ecological validity of fluency information is too low to begin with (e.g. music artist's environment). Last, they found that people's ability to discriminate is highest for those pairs in which the validity of fluency peaks.&lt;ref name="Hertwig2008"/&gt;

'''Are people's inferences in line with the fluency heuristic?'''

In about two thirds to three fourths of inferences in which the fluency heuristic was applicable, people's actual choices conformed to those predicted by the heuristic. Hertwig et al. also found that the larger the difference between recognition latencies (for two objects), the greater the likelihood that the actual inference adheres to that predicted by the fluency heuristic.&lt;ref name="Hertwig2008"/&gt;

'''Neural correlates of the fluency heuristic:'''

Volz, Schooler, and von Cramon (2010) used [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] to isolate fluency-heuristic-based judgments to map the use of fluency onto specific brain areas that might give a better understanding of the heuristic's underlying processes. They determined that there was activation within the [[claustrum]] for fluency heuristic decisions. Given that claustrum activation is thought to reflect the integration of perceptual and memory elements into a conscious gestalt, they suggest that activation correlates with the experience of fluency.&lt;ref name="Volz2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Volz|first1=Kirsten G.|last2=Schooler|first2=Lael J.|last3=von Cramon|first3=D. Yves|title=It just felt right: The neural correlates of the fluency heuristic|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|date=2010|volume=19|issue=3|pages=829–837|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2010.05.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The effect of repetition:'''

Lloyd, Westerman, and Miller (2003) used five experiments to investigate whether the attribution of processing fluency to recognition memory depends on the amount of fluency that is expected from targets based on the frequency with which they appeared during an earlier study phase. Subjects studied targets either one or five times and then were given a recognition test that included a [[Priming (psychology)|priming]] phase to enhance the fluency of half of the test items. Results showed that the priming phase had a greater influence on recognition responses when targets had been presented once than when they had been presented five times. However, an interaction between fluency and target frequency was found only when frequency was manipulated [[Between-group design|between-subjects]]. An interaction between the priming manipulation and target frequency was also found using a "counterfeit" manipulation of frequency, suggesting that attributions of fluency are adjusted according to subjects' expectations for the amount of fluency that should result from previous experiences with a stimulus.&lt;ref name="Lloyd2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lloyd|first1=Marianne E |title=The fluency heuristic in recognition memory: The effect of repetition|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|date=2003|volume=48|issue=3|pages=603–614|doi=10.1016/S0749-596X(02)00535-1|first2=Deanne L |last2=Westerman|first3= Jeremy K |last3=Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[religion]], [[ethics]], [[philosophy]], and [[psychology]] "'''good and evil'''" is a very common [[dichotomy]]. In cultures with [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] and [[Abrahamic]] religious influence, evil is usually perceived as the [[dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] antagonistic opposite of good, in which good should prevail and evil should be defeated.&lt;ref name="Paul O. Ingram 1986. P. 148-149"&gt;Paul O. Ingram, Frederick John Streng. ''Buddhist-Christian Dialogue: Mutual Renewal and Transformation''. University of Hawaii Press, 1986. P. 148-149.&lt;/ref&gt; In cultures with [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] spiritual influence, both good and evil are perceived as part of an antagonistic duality that itself must be overcome through achieving ''[[Śūnyatā]]'' meaning emptiness in the sense of recognition of good and evil being two opposing principles but not a reality, emptying the duality of them, and achieving a [[Monism|oneness]].&lt;ref name="Paul O. Ingram 1986. P. 148-149"/&gt;

[[Evil]], in a general context, is the absence or opposite of that which is described as being good. Often, evil is used to denote profound [[immorality]].&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionary Definition"&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2012 |title=Evil |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/evil |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822012937/http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/evil |archivedate=2012-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain religious contexts, evil has been described as a [[supernatural]] force.&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionary Definition"/&gt; Definitions of evil vary, as does the analysis of its motives.&lt;ref&gt;Ervin Staub. ''Overcoming evil: genocide, violent conflict, and terrorism''. New York, NY, USA: Oxford University Press, Pp. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; However, elements that are commonly associated with evil involve [[Balance (metaphysics)|unbalanced]] behavior involving expediency, [[selfishness]], [[ignorance]], or [[neglect]].&lt;ref&gt;Caitlin Matthews, John Matthews. Walkers Between the Worlds: The Western Mysteries from Shaman to Magus. Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co, Jan 14, 2004. P. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern [[ethics|philosophical]] questions regarding good and evil are subsumed into three major areas of study&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' [http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/ "Ethics"]&lt;/ref&gt;: [[Meta-ethics]] concerning the nature of good and evil, [[Normative ethics]] concerning how we ought to behave, and [[Applied ethics]] concerning particular moral issues.

==History and etymology==

Every language has a word expressing ''good'' in the sense of "having the right or desirable quality" ([[Arete (moral virtue)|ἀρετή]]) and ''bad'' in the sense "undesirable". A sense of [[morality|moral judgment]] and a distinction "right and wrong, good and bad" are [[cultural universals]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Brown (anthropologist)|Donald Brown]] (1991) ''Human Universals''. Philadelphia, [[Temple University Press]] ([http://condor.depaul.edu/~mfiddler/hyphen/humunivers.htm online summary] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120630210030/http://condor.depaul.edu/~mfiddler/hyphen/humunivers.htm |date=2012-06-30 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient world===
{{main article|Zoroastrianism}}
In the eastern part of ancient [[Greater Iran|Persia]] almost three thousand years ago a religious philosopher called [[Zoroaster]] simplified the [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of early Iranian gods&lt;ref name="Boyce_1979_6-12"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1979|pp=6–12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; into [[Dualistic cosmology|two opposing forces]]: [[Ahura Mazda]] ([[Light (theology)|Illuminating]] [[Wisdom]]) and [[Angra Mainyu]] ([[devil|Destructive Spirit]]) which were in conflict. 
{{main article|Gnosticism}}
This idea developed into a religion which spawned many [[sect]]s, some of which embraced an extreme [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] belief that the [[nature|material world]] should be shunned and the [[Sacred|spiritual world]] should be embraced. Gnostic ideas influenced many [[Ancient history|ancient]] religions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Penguin Dictionary of Religion| year=1997|publisher=Penguin Books UK|author=John Hinnel}}&lt;/ref&gt; which teach that ''[[gnosis]]'' (variously interpreted as [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], [[salvation]], [[emancipation]] or [[Buddhahood|'oneness with God']]) may be reached by practising [[philanthropy]] to the point of personal [[poverty]], [[sexual abstinence]] (as far as possible for ''[[wikt:disciple#Noun|hearers]]'', total for ''[[Initiation|initiates]]'') and diligently searching for [[wisdom]] by helping others.&lt;ref name=gph&gt;{{cite book |title=Gnostic Philosophy: From Ancient Persia to Modern Times|first=Tobias |last=Churton|publisher=Inner Traditions – Bear &amp; Company |date=2005|ISBN=978-159477-035-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in ancient [[Egypt]], there were the concepts of [[Ma'at]], the principle of justice, order, and cohesion, and [[Isfet_(Egyptian_mythology)|Isfet]], the principle of chaos, disorder, and decay, with the former being the power and principles which society sought to embody where the latter was such that undermined society. This correspondence can also be seen reflected in ancient Mesopotamian religion as well in the conflict between [[Marduk]] and [[Tiamat]].

===Classical world===
In Western civilisation, the basic meanings of κακός and ἀγαθός are "bad, cowardly" and "good, brave, capable", and their absolute sense emerges only around 400 BC, with [[Pre-Socratic philosophy]], in particular [[Democritus]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles H. Kahn, ''Democritus and the Origins of Moral Psychology'', The American Journal of Philology (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Morality in this absolute sense solidifies in the dialogues of [[Plato]], together with the emergence of [[monotheistic]] thought (notably in ''[[Euthyphro]]'', which ponders the concept of piety ([[:wikt:ὅσιος|τὸ ὅσιον]]) as a moral absolute). The idea is further developed in [[Late Antiquity]] by [[Neoplatonists]], [[Gnostics]], and [[Church Fathers]].

This development from the relative or habitual to the absolute is also evident in the terms ''[[ethics]]'' and ''[[morality]]'' both being derived from terms for "regional custom", Greek ήθος and Latin ''mores'', respectively (see also ''[[:wikt:siðr|siðr]]'').

===Medieval period===
Medieval theology was largely shaped by [[St. Augustine of Hippo]] and [[St. Thomas Aquinas]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} According to the classical definition of St. Augustine of Hippo, [[sin]] is "a word, deed, or desire in opposition to the eternal law of God."[3][4]

Many medieval Christian [[theologian]]s both broadened and narrowed the basic concept of  ''Good and evil'' until it came to have several, sometimes complex definitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Good and Evil: Interpreting a Human Condition|author=Farley, E|publisher=Fortress Press / Vanderbilt University|year=1990|isbn=978-0800624477}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as: 
*a personal preference or subjective judgment regarding any issue which might be earn [[praise]] or [[punishment]] from the [[Theocracy|religious authorities]]
*religious obligation arising from [[Divine law]] leading to [[saint]]hood or [[damnation]]
*a generally accepted [[Norm (social)|cultural standard]] of behaviour which might enhance group [[Human evolution (origins of society and culture)|survival]] or [[wealth]]
*[[natural law]] or behaviour which induces strong emotional reaction
*[[State (polity)|statute law]] imposing a legal [[duty]]

===Modern ideas===

Today the basic [[dichotomy]] often breaks down along these lines:
*''Good'' is a broad concept often associated with [[life]], [[Charity (virtue)|charity]], continuity, [[happiness]], [[love]], or [[justice]].
*''[[Evil]]'' is often associated with conscious and deliberate wrongdoing, discrimination designed to harm others, humiliation of people designed to diminish their psychological needs and dignity, destructiveness, and acts of unnecessary or indiscriminate violence.&lt;ref&gt;Ervin Staub. ''Overcoming evil: genocide, violent conflict, and terrorism''. New York, New York, USA: Oxford University Press, Pp. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[modern English]] word ''evil'' ([[Old English]] {{lang|ang|yfel}}) and its [[cognate]]s such as the [[German language|German]] {{lang|de|Übel}} and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] {{lang|nl|euvel}} are widely considered to come from a [[Proto-Germanic]] reconstructed form of ''*ubilaz'', comparable to the [[Hittite language|Hittite]] ''huwapp-'' ultimately from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] form {{PIE|''*wap-''}} and suffixed zero-grade form {{PIE|''*up-elo-''}}. Other later Germanic forms include [[Middle English]] {{lang|enm|evel}}, {{lang|enm|ifel}}, {{lang|enm|ufel}}, [[Old Frisian]] {{lang|ofs|evel}} (adjective and noun), [[Old Saxon]] {{lang|osx|ubil}}, [[Old High German]] {{lang|goh|ubil}}, and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] {{lang|got-Latn|ubils}}.

The nature of ''being good'' has been given many treatments; one is that the good is based on the natural [[love]], bonding, and affection that begins at the earliest stages of personal development; another is that goodness is a product of knowing [[truth]]. Differing views also exist as to why evil might arise. Many religious and philosophical traditions claim that evil behavior is an ''aberration'' that results from the imperfect human condition (e.g. "[[The Fall of Man]]"). Sometimes, evil is attributed to the existence of [[free will]] and [[Agency (philosophy)|human agency]]. Some argue that evil itself is ultimately based in an [[ignorance]] of [[truth]] (i.e., human value, [[sanctity]], [[divinity]]). A variety of Enlightenment thinkers have alleged the opposite, by suggesting that evil is learned as a consequence of tyrannical [[social structure]]s.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Theories of moral goodness==
{{other uses of|good|Good (disambiguation)}}

===Chinese moral philosophy===
{{Main|Confucius#Ethics|Taoism#Ethics}}
In [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]], there is no direct analogue to the way good and evil are opposed, although references to demonic influence is common in [[Chinese folk religion]]. Confucianism's primary concern is with correct social relationships and the behavior appropriate to the learned or superior man. Evil would thus correspond to wrong behavior. Still less does it map into Taoism, in spite of the centrality of [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] in that system, but the opposite of the [[Three Treasures (Taoism)|basic virtues of Taoism]] (compassion, moderation, and humility) can be inferred to be the analogue of evil in it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/good&amp;evil.htm ''Good and Evil in Chinese Philosophy''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529010501/http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/good%26evil.htm |date=2006-05-29 }} C.W. Chan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''History of Chinese Philosophy'' Feng Youlan, Volume II The Period of Classical Learning (from the Second Century B.C. to the Twentieth Century A.D). Trans. Derk Bodde. Ch. XIV Liu Chiu-Yuan, Wang Shou-jen, and Ming Idealism. part 6 § 6 ''Origin of Evil''. Uses strikingly similar language to that in the etymology section of this article, in the context of Chinese Idealism.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western philosophy===

====Pyrrhonism====
[[Pyrrhonism]] holds that good and evil do not exist by nature, meaning that good and evil do not exist within the things themselves. All judgments of good and evil are relative to the one doing the judging. 

====Spinoza====
[[Benedict de Spinoza]] states:
{{quote|1. By good, I understand that which we certainly know is useful to us. &lt;br /&gt; 2. By evil, on the contrary I understand that which we certainly know hinders us from possessing anything that is good.&lt;ref name="ebgb"&gt;Benedict de Spinoza, ''Ethics'', Part IV ''Of Human Bondage or of the Strength of the Affects'' Definitions translated by W. H. White, Revised by A. H. Stirling, Great Books vol 31, Encyclopædia Britannica 1952 p. 424&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Spinoza assumes a [[formal system|quasi-mathematical]] style and states these further propositions which he purports to prove or demonstrate from the above definitions in part IV of his ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'' :&lt;ref name="ebgb"/&gt;
* Proposition 8 "''Knowledge of good or evil is nothing but affect of joy or sorrow in so far as we are conscious of it.''"
* Proposition 30 "''Nothing can be evil through that which it possesses in common with our nature, but in so far as a thing is evil to us it is contrary to us.''"
* Proposition 64 "''The knowledge of evil is inadequate knowledge.''"
** Corollary "''Hence it follows that if the human mind had none but adequate ideas, it would form no notion of evil.''"
* Proposition 65 "''According to the guidance of reason, of two things which are good, we shall follow the greater good, and of two evils, follow the less.''"
* Proposition 68 "''If men were born free, they would form no conception of good and evil so long as they were free.''"

====Nietzsche====
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], in a rejection of the Judeo-Christian morality, addresses this in two works, ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' and ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'', where he essentially says that the natural functional non-good has been socially transformed into the religious concept of evil by the slave mentality of the weak and oppressed masses who resent their masters (the strong). He also makes a critique of morality by saying that many who consider themselves to be moral are simply acting from cowardice (wanting to do evil but scared of the repercussions).

=== Psychology ===

====Carl Jung====
[[Carl Jung]], in his book ''[[Answer to Job]]'' and elsewhere, depicted evil as the ''dark side of the Devil''. People tend to believe evil is something external to them, because they project their [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] onto others. Jung interpreted the story of [[Jesus]] as an account of God facing his own shadow.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Palmquist, [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/dow/ Dreams of Wholeness] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906151252/http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/dow/ |date=2008-09-06 }}: A course of introductory lectures on religion, psychology and personal growth (Hong Kong: Philopsychy Press, 1997/2008), see especially Chapter XI.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Philip Zimbardo ====
In 2007, [[Philip Zimbardo]] suggested that people may act in evil ways as a result of a [[collective identity]]. This hypothesis, based on his previous experience from the [[Stanford prison experiment]], was published in the book ''The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lucifereffect.com/ Book website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219183946/http://www.lucifereffect.com/ |date=2008-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
{{Main article|Problem of evil}}

====Bahá'í Faith====
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] asserts that evil is non-existent and that it is a concept for the lacking of good, just as cold is the state of no heat, darkness is the state of no light, forgetfulness the lacking of memory, ignorance the lacking of knowledge. All of these are states of lacking and have no real existence.&lt;ref name="Coll. 1982"&gt;{{cite book|author='Abdu'l-Bahá |title=Some answered questions |year=1982 |publisher=Bahá'í Publ. Trust |location=Wilmette, Ill. |isbn=0-87743-162-0 |translator=Laura Clifford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, evil does not exist, and is relative to man. [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], son of the founder of the religion, in [[Some Answered Questions]] states:

"Nevertheless a doubt occurs to the mind—that is, scorpions and serpents are poisonous. Are they good or evil, for they are existing beings? Yes, a scorpion is evil in relation to man; a serpent is evil in relation to man; but in relation to themselves they are not evil, for their poison is their weapon, and by their sting they defend themselves."&lt;ref name="Coll. 1982"/&gt;

Thus, evil is more of an intellectual concept than a true reality. Since God is good, and upon creating creation he confirmed it by saying it is Good (Genesis 1:31) evil cannot have a true reality.&lt;ref name="Coll. 1982"/&gt;

====Buddhism====
[[File:Extermination of Evil Tenkeisei crop.jpg|thumb|230px|''[[Extermination of Evil]]'', The God of Heavenly Punishment, from the Chinese tradition of [[yin and yang]]. Late [[Heian period]] (12th Century Japan)]]
{{Main article|Buddhist Ethics}}

The primal duality in Buddhism is between suffering and enlightenment, so the good vs. evil splitting has no direct analogue in it. One may infer however from the general teachings of the Buddha that the [[Dukkha|catalogued causes]] of suffering are what correspond in this belief system to 'evil'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HyPnrDiBM7cC&amp;pg=PA424 ''Philosophy of Religion''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226193619/https://books.google.com/books?id=HyPnrDiBM7cC&amp;pg=PA424 |date=2017-12-26 }} Charles Taliaferro, Paul J. Griffiths, eds. Ch. 35, ''Buddhism and Evil'' Martin Southwold p 424&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingdharma.org/Living.Dharma.Articles/LayOutreachAndMeaningOfEvilPerson-Unno.html ''Lay Outreach and the Meaning of 'Evil Person''' Taitetsu Unno] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018093156/http://www.livingdharma.org/Living.Dharma.Articles/LayOutreachAndMeaningOfEvilPerson-Unno.html |date=2012-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practically this can refer to 1) the three selfish emotions—desire, hate and delusion; and 2) to their expression in physical and verbal actions. See ''ten unvirtuous actions in Buddhism''. Specifically, ''evil'' means whatever harms or obstructs the causes for happiness in this life, a better rebirth, liberation from samsara, and the true and complete enlightenment of a buddha (samyaksambodhi).

"What is evil? Killing is evil, lying is evil, slandering is evil, abuse is evil, gossip is evil: envy is evil, hatred is evil, to cling to false doctrine is evil; all these things are evil. And what is the root of evil? Desire is the root of evil, illusion is the root of evil." Gautama Siddhartha, the founder of Buddhism, 563-483 B.C.

====Hinduism====
In Hinduism the concept of [[Dharma]] or righteousness clearly divides the world into good and evil, and clearly explains that wars have to be waged sometimes to establish and protect Dharma, this war is called [[Dharmayuddha]]. This division of good and evil is of major importance in both the Hindu epics of [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]]. However, the main emphasis in Hinduism is on bad action, rather than bad people. The Hindu holy text, the [[Bhagavad Gita]], speaks of the balance of good and evil. When this balance goes off, divine incarnations come to help to restore this balance.&lt;ref&gt;Bhagavad Gita 4.07-08&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sikhism====
In adherence to the core principle of spiritual evolution, the Sikh idea of evil changes depending on one's position on the path to liberation. At the beginning stages of spiritual growth, good and evil may seem neatly separated. However, once one's spirit evolves to the point where it sees most clearly, the idea of evil vanishes and the truth is revealed. In his writings [[Guru Arjan]] explains that, because God is the source of all things, what we believe to be evil must too come from God. And because God is ultimately a source of absolute good, nothing truly evil can originate from God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Gopal|title=Sri guru-granth sahib [english version]|date=1967|publisher=Taplinger Publishing Co.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Sikhism, like many other religions, does incorporate a list of "vices" from which suffering, corruption, and abject negativity arise. These are known as the [[Five Thieves]], called such due to their propensity to cloud the mind and lead one astray from the prosecution of righteous action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singh|first1=Charan|title=Ethics and Business: Evidence from Sikh Religion|ssrn=2366249|website=Social Science Research Network|publisher=Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sandhu|first1=Jaswinder|title=The Sikh Model of the Person, Suffering, and Healing: Implications for Counselors|journal=International Journal for the Advancement of Counselling|date=February 2004|volume=26|issue=1|pages=33–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Moh]], or Attachment
*[[Lobh]], or Greed
*[[Krodh|Karodh]], or Wrath
*[[Kaam]], or Lust
*[[Hankaar|Ahankar]], or Egotism
One who gives in to the temptations of the [[Five Thieves]] is known as "[[Manmukh]]", or someone who lives selfishly and without virtue. Inversely, the "[[Gurmukh]], who thrive in their reverence toward divine knowledge, rise above vice via the practice of the high virtues of Sikhism. These are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singh|first1=Arjan|title=The universal ideal of sikhism|journal=Global Dialogue|date=January 2000|volume=2|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Selfless Service|Sewa]], or selfless service to others.
*[[Simran|Nam Simran]], or meditation upon the divine name.

====Islam====
There is no concept of absolute evil in [[Islam]], as a fundamental universal principle that is independent from and equal with good in a [[dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] sense. Within Islam, it is considered essential to believe that all comes from [[Allah]], whether it is perceived as good or bad by individuals; and things that are perceived as ''evil'' or ''bad'' are either natural events (natural disasters or illnesses) or caused by humanity's free will to disobey Allah's orders. See [[Devil (Islam)]].

According to the [[Ahmadiyya]] understanding of Islam, evil does not have a positive existence in itself and is merely the lack of good, just as darkness is the result of lack of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.alislam.org/library/books/RRKT.pdf | title=Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth | page=193 | accessdate=June 25, 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225308/https://www.alislam.org/library/books/RRKT.pdf | archivedate=March 3, 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judaism====
{{see also|Yetzer hara}}
In [[Judaism]], no individual can be defined as categorically, absolutely "good" or "evil."  Judaism recognizes human beings' psychological complexity.  God gave the [[Children of Israel]] the [[Torah]] as a guide to overcome evil.  A common theme of [[Jewish philosophy#Jewish philosophy before Maimonides|medieval Jewish philosophy]] is that people who do good deeds will be rewarded in ''[[Jewish eschatology#"The world to come"|olam haba]]''.&lt;ref name="JVL"&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_07647.html "Good &amp; Evil."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020040331/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_07647.html |date=2016-10-20 }} ''Jewish Virtual Library''.  2008.  19 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Judaism]] has two conflicting attitudes toward the existence of evil.  In one interpretation, evil is not real, it is [[Per se (terminology)|per se]] not part of God's creation, but comes into existence through man's bad actions.  In the other interpretation, evil was created by God since God created everything and to suggest otherwise would be to engage in [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]], and is therefore antithetical to the core Jewish belief in [[monotheism]].&lt;ref name="JVL" /&gt;

====Christianity====
{{see also|Devil#Christianity}}
Evil according to a Christian worldview is any action, thought or attitude that is ''contrary'' to the character or will of God. This is shown through the law given in both the Old and New Testament.  Therefore, evil in a Christian world view is contrasted by and in conflict with God's character or God's will. This evil shows itself through deviation from the character or will of God. Similarly, good according to a Christian worldview is any action, thought or attitude that is ''consistent'' with the character or the will of God, for God is good, the ultimate goodness. 

[[File:Ary Scheffer - The Temptation of Christ (1854).jpg|thumb|left|The [[devil]], in opposition to the will of God, represents evil and tempts Christ, the personification of the character and will of God. [[Ary Scheffer]], 1854.]]

[[Christian theology]] draws its concept of evil from the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s. The [[Christian Bible]] exercises “the dominant influence upon ideas about God and evil in the Western world.”&lt;ref&gt;David Ray Griffin, ''God, Power, and Evil: a Process Theodicy'' (Westminster, 1976/2004), 31.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Old Testament, evil is understood to be an opposition to God as well as something unsuitable or inferior such as the leader of the [[fallen angel]]s [[Satan#Christianity|Satan]]&lt;ref&gt;Hans Schwarz, ''Evil: A Historical and Theological Perspective'' (Lima, Ohio: Academic Renewal Press, 2001): 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; In the New Testament the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''poneros'' is used to indicate unsuitability, while ''kakos'' is used to refer to opposition to God in the human realm.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, ''Evil'', 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, the Catholic Church extracts its understanding of evil from its canonical antiquity and the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[theologian]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], who in ''Summa Theologica'' defines evil as the absence or privation of good.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, SUMMA THEOLOGICA, translated by the Fathers of the English Dominican Province (New York: Benziger Brothers, 1947) Volume 3, q. 72, a. 1, p. 902.&lt;/ref&gt; [[French-American]] theologian [[Henri Blocher]] describes evil, when viewed as a theological concept, as an "unjustifiable reality. In common parlance, evil is 'something' that occurs in experience that ''ought not to be''."&lt;ref&gt;Henri Blocher, ''Evil and the Cross'' (Downers Grove: [[InterVarsity Press]], 1994): 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mormonism]], mortal life is viewed as a test of faith, where one's choices are central to the Plan of Salvation. See [[Agency (LDS Church)]]. Evil is that which keeps one from discovering the nature of God. It is believed that one must choose not to be evil to return to God.

[[Christian Science]] believes that evil arises from a misunderstanding of the goodness of nature, which is understood as being inherently perfect if viewed from the correct (spiritual) perspective. Misunderstanding God's reality leads to incorrect choices, which are termed evil. This has led to the rejection of any separate power being the source of evil, or of God as being the source of evil; instead, the appearance of evil is the result of a mistaken concept of good. Christian Scientists argue that even the most ''evil'' person does not pursue evil for its own sake, but from the mistaken viewpoint that he or she will achieve some kind of good thereby.

====Zoroastrianism====
In the originally [[Iranian religions|Persian]] religion of [[Zoroastrianism]], the world is a battle ground between the god [[Ahura Mazda]] (also called [[Ormazd]]) and the malignant spirit [[Angra Mainyu]] (also called [[Ahriman]]). The final resolution of the struggle between good and evil was supposed to occur on a [[Last Judgment|day of Judgement]], in which all beings that have lived will be led across a bridge of fire, and those who are evil will be cast down forever. In Afghan belief, [[angels]] and [[saints]] are beings sent to help us achieve the path towards goodness.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Descriptive, meta-ethical, and normative fields==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}
It is possible to treat the essential theories of value by the use of a philosophical and academic approach. In properly analyzing theories of value, everyday beliefs are not only carefully ''catalogued'' and ''described'', but also rigorously ''analyzed'' and ''judged''.

There are at least two basic ways of presenting a theory of value, based on two different kinds of questions:
* What do people find good, and what do they despise?
* What really is good, and what really is bad?

The two questions are subtly different. One may answer the first question by researching the world by use of social science, and examining the preferences that people assert. However, one may answer the second question by use of reasoning, introspection, prescription, and generalization. The former kind of method of analysis is called "[[descriptive]]", because it attempts to describe what people actually view as good or evil; while the latter is called "[[Normative ethics|normative]]", because it tries to actively prohibit evils and cherish goods. These descriptive and normative approaches can be complementary. For example, tracking the decline of the popularity of slavery across cultures is the work of [[descriptive ethics]], while advising that slavery be avoided is normative.

[[Meta-ethics]] is the study of the fundamental questions concerning the nature and origins of the good and the evil, including inquiry into the nature of good and evil, as well as the meaning of evaluative language. In this respect, meta-ethics is not necessarily tied to investigations into how others see the good, or of asserting what is good.

==Theories of the intrinsically good==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}
A satisfying formulation of goodness is valuable because it might allow one to construct a good life or society by reliable processes of deduction, elaboration, or prioritization. One could answer the ancient question, "How should we then live?" among many other important related questions. It has long been thought that this question can best be answered by examining what it is that necessarily makes a thing valuable, or in what the source of value consists.

===Platonic idealism===
One attempt to define goodness describes it as a property of the world with [[Platonic idealism]]. According to this claim, to talk about the good is to talk about something real that exists in the object itself, independent of the perception of it. [[Plato]] advocated this view, in his expression that there is such a thing as an eternal realm of [[substantial form|forms]] or ideas, and that the greatest of the ideas and the essence of being was goodness, or The good.  The good was defined by many ancient Greeks and other ancient philosophers as a perfect and eternal idea, or blueprint.  The good is the right relation between all that exists, and this exists in the mind of the Divine, or some heavenly realm.  The good is the [[harmony]] of a just political community, love, friendship, the ordered human soul of [[virtues]], and the right relation to the Divine and to Nature.  The characters in Plato's dialogues mention the many virtues of a philosopher, or a lover of wisdom.

A [[theism|theist]] is a person who believes that the [[God|Supreme Being]] exists or [[deity|gods]] exist ([[monotheism]] or [[polytheism]]). A theist may, therefore, claim that the universe has a purpose and value according to the will of such [[creator deity|creator]](s) that lies partially beyond human understanding. For instance, [[Thomas Aquinas]]—a proponent of this view—believed he had proven the [[existence of God]], and the right relations that humans ought to have to the divine [[first cause]].

Monotheists might also hope for infinite universal love. Such hope is often translated as "[[faith]]", and [[wisdom]] itself is largely defined within some religious doctrines as ''a knowledge and understanding of innate goodness.'' The concepts of [[innocence]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] [[wikt:Purity|purity]], and [[salvation]] are likewise related to a concept of being in, or returning to, a state of '' goodness''—one that, according to various teachings of "[[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]", approaches a state of ''holiness'' (or ''Godliness'').

===Perfectionism===
[[Aristotle]] believed that virtues consisted of realization of potentials unique to humanity, such as the use of reason. This type of view, called [[perfectionism (philosophy)|perfectionism]], has been recently defended in modern form by [[Thomas Hurka]].

An entirely different form of perfectionism has arisen in response to rapid technological change. Some [[techno-optimist]]s, especially [[transhumanism|transhumanists]], avow a form of perfectionism in which the capacity to determine good and trade off fundamental values, is expressed not by humans but by software, [[genetic engineering]] of humans, [[artificial intelligence]]. Skeptics assert that rather than perfect goodness, it would be only the appearance of perfect goodness, reinforced by [[persuasion technology]] and probably brute force of violent [[technological escalation]], which would cause people to accept such rulers or rules authored by them.

===Welfarist theories===
Welfarist theories of value say things that are good are such because of their positive effects on human well-being.

====Subjective theories of well-being====
It is difficult to figure out where an immaterial trait such as "goodness" could reside in the world. A counterproposal is to locate values inside people. Some philosophers go so far as to say that if some [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]] does not tend to arouse a desirable subjective state in self-aware beings, then it cannot be good.

Most philosophers that think goods have to create desirable mental states also say that goods are experiences of self-aware beings. These philosophers often distinguish the experience, which they call an intrinsic good, from the things that seem to cause the experience, which they call "inherent"  goods. Failing to distinguish the two leads to a [[subject–object problem]] in which it is not clear who is evaluating what object.

Some theories describe no higher collective value than that of maximizing ''pleasure'' for individual(s). Some even define goodness and intrinsic value as the experience of pleasure, and bad as the experience of pain. This view is called [[hedonism]], a ''monistic theory of value''. It has two main varieties: simple, and Epicurean.

''Simple hedonism'' is the view that physical pleasure is the ultimate good. However, the ancient philosopher [[Epicurus]] used the word 'pleasure' in a more general sense that encompassed a range of states from bliss to contentment to relief. Contrary to popular caricature, he valued pleasures of the mind to bodily pleasures, and advocated moderation as the surest path to happiness.

[[Jeremy Bentham|Jeremy Bentham's]] book ''[[The Principles of Morals and Legislation]]'' prioritized goods by considering pleasure, pain and consequences. This theory had a wide effect on public affairs, up to and including the present day. A similar system was later named [[Utilitarianism]] by [[John Stuart Mill]]. More broadly, utilitarian theories are examples of Consequentialism. All utilitarian theories are based upon the ''maxim of utility'', which states that ''good'' is whatever provides ''the greatest happiness for the greatest number''. It follows from this principle that what brings happiness to the greatest number of people, is good.

A benefit of tracing good to pleasure and pain is that both are easily understandable, both in oneself and to an extent in others. For the hedonist, the explanation for helping behaviour may come in the form of ''empathy''—the ability of a being to "feel" another's pain. People tend to value the lives of gorillas more than those of mosquitoes because the gorilla lives and feels, making it easier to empathize with them. This idea is carried forward in the [[ethical relationship]] view and has given rise to the [[animal rights]] movement and parts of the [[peace movement]]. The impact of sympathy on human behaviour is compatible with [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] views, including [[David Hume]]'s stances that the idea of a self with unique identity is illusory, and that morality ultimately comes down to sympathy and fellow feeling for others, or the exercise of approval underlying moral judgments.

A view adopted by James Griffin attempts to find a subjective alternative to hedonism as an intrinsic value. He argues that the satisfaction of one's informed desires constitutes well-being, whether or not these desires actually bring the agent happiness. Moreover, these preferences must be life-relevant, that is, contribute to the success of a person's life overall.

Desire satisfaction may occur without the agent's awareness of the satisfaction of the desire. For example, if a man wishes for his legal will to be enacted after his death, and it is, then his desire has been satisfied even though he will never experience or know of it.

[[Meher Baba]] proposed that it is not the satisfaction of desires that motivates the agent but rather "a desire to be free from the limitation of all desires. Those experiences and actions which increase the fetters of desire are bad, and those experiences and actions which tend to emancipate the mind from limiting desires are good."&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]]. ''Discourses.'' '''1'''. 1967. Sufism Reoriented. p. 93. {{ISBN|1-880619-09-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is through good actions, then, that the agent becomes free from selfish desires and achieves a state of well-being: "The good is the main link between selfishness thriving and dying. Selfishness, which in the beginning is the father of evil tendencies, becomes through good deeds the hero of its own defeat. When the evil tendencies are completely replaced by good tendencies, selfishness is transformed into selflessness, i.e., individual selfishness loses itself in universal interest."&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]]. ''Discourses.'' '''1'''. 1967. Sufism Reoriented. p. 31. {{ISBN|1-880619-09-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Objective theories of well-being====
{{See also|Wealth#separate analysis}}
The idea that the ultimate good exists and is not orderable but is globally measurable is reflected in various ways in economic ([[classical economics]], [[green economics]], [[welfare economics]], [[gross national happiness]]) and scientific ([[positive psychology]], the [[science of morality]]) [[measuring well-being|well-being measuring]] theories, all of which focus on various ways of assessing progress towards that goal, a so-called [[genuine progress indicator]]. Modern economics thus reflects very ancient philosophy, but a calculation or quantitative or other process based on cardinality and [[statistics]] replaces the simple ordering of values.

For example, in both economics and in folk wisdom, the value of something seems to rise so long as it is relatively scarce. However, if it becomes too scarce, it leads often to a conflict, and can reduce collective value.

In the classical [[political economy]] of [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]], and in its critique by [[Karl Marx]], ''human labour'' is seen as the ultimate source of all new economic value. This is an ''objective'' theory of value (see [[value theory]]), which attributes value to real production-costs, and ultimately expenditures of human labour-time (see also [[law of value]]). It contrasts with [[marginal utility]] theory, which argues that the value of labour depends on subjective preferences by consumers, which may however also be objectively studied.

The economic value of labour may be assessed technically in terms of its [[use-value]] or [[utility]] or commercially in terms of its [[exchange-value]], [[price]] or production cost (see also [[labour power]]. But its value may also be socially assessed in terms of its contribution to the [[wealth]] and [[well-being]] of a society.

In non-market societies, labour may be valued primarily in terms of skill, time, and output, as well as moral or social criteria and legal obligations. In market societies, labour is valued economically primarily through the [[labour market]]. The price of labour may then be set by supply and demand, by [[strike action]] or legislation, or by legal or professional entry-requirements into occupations.

====Mid-range theories====
[[Conceptual metaphor]] theories argue against both subjective and [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] conceptions of value and meaning, and focus on the relationships between body and other essential elements of human life. In effect, conceptual metaphor theories treat ethics as an [[ontology]] problem and the issue of how to work-out values as a negotiation of these metaphors, not the application of some [[abstraction]] or a strict standoff between parties who have no way to understand each other's views.

==Philosophical questions==

=== Universality ===
[[File:Don't Kid Yourself...it's Up to You. Stop Him^ - NARA - 534297.jpg|right|thumb|[[Adolf Hitler]] is sometimes used as a modern definition of evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2046285_2045996_2045995,00.html | title=Top 25 Political Icons - Adolf Hitler | work=Time | date=February 4, 2011 | accessdate=August 27, 2011 | author=Sanburn, Josh | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826220011/http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2046285_2045996_2045995,00.html | archivedate=August 26, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler's policies and orders resulted in the deaths of about 50 million people.&lt;ref&gt;Del Testa, David W; Lemoine, Florence; Strickland, John (2003). ''Government Leaders, Military Rulers, and Political Activists.'' Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 83. {{ISBN|978-1-57356-153-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A fundamental question is whether there is a universal, transcendent definition of evil, or whether evil is determined by one's social or cultural background. [[C. S. Lewis]], in ''[[The Abolition of Man]]'', maintained that there are certain acts that are universally considered evil, such as [[rape]] and [[murder]]. However, the numerous instances in which rape or murder is morally affected by social context call this into question.  Up until the mid-19th century, the [[United States]]—along with many other countries—practiced forms of [[slavery]]. As is often the case, those transgressing moral boundaries stood to profit from that exercise. Arguably, slavery has always been the same and objectively evil, but men with a motivation to transgress will justify that action.

The [[Nazism|Nazis]], during [[World War II]], considered [[genocide]] to be acceptable,&lt;ref name="evil"&gt;Gaymon Bennett, Ted Peters, Martinez J. Hewlett, Robert John Russell (2008). ''The evolution of evil''. Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht. p.318. {{ISBN|3-525-56979-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did the [[Hutu]] [[Interahamwe]] in the [[Rwandan genocide]].&lt;ref name="Gourevitch, 1999"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gourevitch |first=Philip |title=We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will be Killed With our Families |publisher=Picador |isbn=0-312-24335-9 |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frontline: the triumph of evil.|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/evil/|accessdate=2007-04-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419061642/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/evil/|archivedate=2007-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One might point out, though, that the actual perpetrators of those atrocities probably avoided calling their actions genocide, since the objective meaning of any act accurately described by that word is to wrongfully kill a selected group of people, which is an action that at least their victims will understand to be evil. Universalists consider evil independent of culture, and wholly related to acts or intents. Thus, while the ideological leaders of Nazism and the Hutu Interhamwe accepted (and considered it moral) to commit genocide, the belief in genocide as ''fundamentally'' or ''universally'' evil holds that those who instigated this genocide are actually evil.{{Synthesis inline|date=November 2010}} Other universalists might argue that although the commission of an evil act is always evil, those who perpetrate may not be wholly evil or wholly good entities. To say that someone who has stolen a candy bar, for instance, becomes wholly evil is a rather untenable position. However, universalists might also argue that a person can choose a decidedly evil or a decidedly good life career, and genocidal dictatorship plainly falls on the side of the former.

Views on the nature of evil tend to fall into one of four opposed camps:

* [[Moral absolutism]] holds that good and evil are fixed concepts established by a [[deity]] or [[deities]], nature, morality, common sense, or some other source.
* [[Amoralism]] claims that good and evil are meaningless, that there is no moral ingredient in nature.
* [[Moral relativism]] holds that standards of good and evil are only products of local culture, custom, or prejudice.
* [[Moral universalism]] is the attempt to find a compromise between the absolutist sense of morality, and the relativist view; universalism claims that morality is only flexible to a degree, and that what is truly good or evil can be determined by examining what is commonly considered to be evil amongst all humans.

[[Plato]] wrote that there are relatively few ways to do good, but there are countless ways to do evil, which can therefore have a much greater impact on our lives, and the lives of other beings capable of suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sources of Evil According to Plato |first=Harold |last=Cherniss |authorlink=Harold F. Cherniss |publisher=American Philosophical Society |year=1954 |isbn=9004052356 |pages=23–30 |jstor=3143666}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usefulness as a term===
One school of thought that holds that no ''person'' is evil, and that only ''acts'' may be properly considered evil. Psychologist and mediator [[Marshall Rosenberg]] claims that the root of violence is the very concept of ''evil'' or ''badness''. When we label someone as bad or evil, Rosenberg claims, it invokes the desire to punish or inflict pain. It also makes it easy for us to turn off our feelings towards the person we are harming. He cites the use of language in Nazi Germany as being a key to how the German people were able to do things to other human beings that they normally would not do. He links the concept of evil to our judicial system, which seeks to create justice via punishment—''punitive justice''—punishing acts that are seen as bad or wrong.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}He contrasts this approach with what he found in cultures{{which|date=August 2013}} in which the idea of evil was non-existent. In such cultures{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} when someone harms another person, they are believed to be out of harmony with themselves and their community, are seen as sick or ill and measures are taken to restore them to a sense of harmonious relations with themselves and others.

Psychologist [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] agrees, in his school of psychology called [[Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy]], or REBT. He says the root of anger, and the desire to harm someone, is almost always related to variations of implicit or explicit philosophical beliefs about other human beings. He further claims that without holding variants of those covert or overt belief and assumptions, the tendency to resort to violence in most cases is less likely.

American psychiatrist [[M. Scott Peck]] on the other hand, describes evil as ''militant ignorance''.&lt;ref name="Liemult"&gt;Peck, M. Scott. (1983;1988). ''People of the Lie: The hope for healing human evil''. Century Hutchinson.&lt;/ref&gt; The original Judeo-Christian concept of ''[[sin]]'' is as a process that leads one to ''miss the mark'' and not achieve perfection. Peck argues that while most people are conscious of this at least on some level, those that are evil actively and militantly refuse this consciousness. Peck describes evil as a malignant type of self-righteousness which results in a projection of evil onto selected specific innocent victims (often children or other people in relatively powerless positions). Peck considers those he calls evil to be attempting to escape and hide from their own conscience (through self-deception) and views this as being quite distinct from the apparent absence of conscience evident in [[Psychopathy|sociopaths]].

According to Peck, an evil person:&lt;ref name="Liemult"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peck, M. Scott. (1978;1992), ''The Road Less Travelled''. Arrow.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Is consistently self-deceiving, with the intent of avoiding [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and maintaining a [[self-image]] of [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfection]]
* Deceives others as a consequence of their own self-deception
* [[Psychological projection|Psychologically projects]] his or her evils and sins onto very specific targets, [[scapegoating]] those targets while treating everyone else normally ("their insensitivity toward him was selective")&lt;ref&gt;Peck, 1983/1988, p105&lt;/ref&gt;
* Commonly hates with the pretense of love, for the purposes of self-deception as much as the deception of others
* Abuses political or emotional power ("the imposition of one's will upon others by overt or covert coercion")&lt;ref&gt;Peck, 1978/1992, p298&lt;/ref&gt;
* Maintains a high level of respectability and lies incessantly in order to do so
* Is consistent in his or her sins. Evil people are defined not so much by the magnitude of their sins, but by their consistency (of destructiveness)
* Is unable to think from the viewpoint of their victim
* Has a covert intolerance to [[criticism]] and other forms of [[narcissistic injury]]

He also considers certain institutions may be evil, as his discussion of the [[My Lai Massacre]] and its attempted coverup illustrate. By this definition, acts of [[terrorism|criminal]] and [[state terrorism]] would also be considered evil.

===Necessary evil===
[[File:Martin_Luther_by_Cranach-restoration.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Luther]] believed that occasional minor evil could have a positive effect]]
[[Martin Luther]] argued that there are cases where a little evil is a positive good. He wrote, "Seek out the society of your boon companions, drink, play, talk bawdy, and amuse yourself. One must sometimes commit a sin out of hate and contempt for [[the Devil]], so as not to give him the chance to make one scrupulous over mere nothings... ."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther, ''Werke'', XX, p58&lt;/ref&gt;

According to certain{{which|date=August 2013}} schools of political philosophy, leaders should be indifferent to good or evil, taking actions based only upon practicality; this approach to politics was put forth by [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], a 16th-century [[Florence, Italy|Florentine]] writer who advised politicians "...it is far safer to be feared than loved."&lt;ref name = "erragh"&gt;Niccolo Machiavelli, ''The Prince'', Dante University of America Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-937832-38-3}} {{ISBN|978-0-937832-38-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[international relations]] theories of [[Realism in international relations|realism]] and [[neorealism (international relations)|neorealism]], sometimes called ''[[realpolitik]]'' advise politicians to explicitly ban absolute moral and ethical considerations from international politics, and to focus on self-interest, political survival, and power politics, which they hold to be more accurate in explaining a world they view as explicitly [[amorality|amoral]] and dangerous. Political realists usually justify their perspectives by laying claim to a ''higher moral duty'' specific to political leaders, under which the greatest evil is seen to be the failure of the state to protect itself and its citizens. Machiavelli wrote: "...there will be traits considered good that, if followed, will lead to ruin, while other traits, considered vices which if practiced achieve security and well being for the Prince."&lt;ref name = "erragh"/&gt;

[[Anton LaVey]], founder of the [[Church of Satan]], was a materialist and claimed that evil is actually good. He was responding to the common practice of describing sexuality or disbelief as evil, and his claim was that when the word ''evil'' is used to describe the natural pleasures and instincts of men and women, or the skepticism of an inquiring mind, the things called evil are really good.&lt;ref&gt;Anton LaVey, ''The Satanic Bible'', Avon, 1969, {{ISBN|0-380-01539-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goodness and agency==

===Goodwill===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2009}}
[[John Rawls]]' book ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' prioritized social arrangements and goods based on their contribution to [[justice]]. Rawls defined justice as ''fairness'', especially in distributing social goods, defined fairness in terms of procedures, and attempted to prove that just institutions and lives are good, if rational individuals'  goods are considered fairly. Rawls's crucial invention was the [[original position]], a procedure in which one tries to make objective moral decisions by refusing to let personal facts about oneself enter one's moral calculations.

One problem{{According to whom|date=August 2009}} with the thinkings of Rawls is that it is overly procedural. Procedurally fair processes of the type used by Rawls may not leave enough room for judgment, and therefore, reduce the totality of goodness. For example, if two people are found to own an orange, the standard fair procedure is to cut it in two and give half to each. However, if one wants to eat it while the other wants the rind to flavor a cake, cutting it in two is clearly less good than giving the peel to the baker and feeding the core to the eater.

Applying procedural fairness to an entire society therefore seems certain to create recognizable inefficiencies {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}, and therefore be unfair, and (by the equivalence of justice with fairness) unjust.

However, procedural processes are not always necessarily damning in this way. [[Immanuel Kant]], a great influence for Rawls, similarly applies a lot of procedural practice within the practical application of ''The Categorical Imperative'', however, this is indeed not based solely on 'fairness'. Even though an example like the one above regarding the orange would not be something that required the practical application of ''The Categorical Imperative'', it is important{{According to whom|date=August 2009}} to draw distinction between Kant and Rawls, and note that Kant's Theory would not necessarily lead to the same problems Rawls' does—i.e., the cutting in half of the orange. Kant's Theory promotes acting out of Duty—acting for the Summum Bonum for him, ''The Good Will''—and in fact encourages Judgement, too. What this would mean{{According to whom|date=August 2009}} is that the outcome of the Orange's distribution would not be such a simple process for Kant as the reason why it would be wanted by both parties would necessarily have to be a part of the Judgement process, thus eliminating the problem that Rawls' account suffers here.

===Society, life and ecology===
{{essay|section|date=September 2012}}
Many views value ''unity'' as a good: to go beyond [[eudaimonia]] by saying that an individual person's flourishing is valuable only as a means to the flourishing of society as a whole. In other words, a single person's life is, ultimately, not important or worthwhile in itself, but is good only as a means to the success of society as a whole. Some elements of [[Confucianism]] are an example of this, encouraging the view that people ought to conform as individuals to demands of a peaceful and ordered society.

According to the naturalistic view, the flourishing of society is not, or not the only, intrinsically good thing. Defenses of this notion are often formulated by reference to [[biology]], and observations that living things compete more with their own kind than with other kinds. Rather, what is of intrinsic good is the flourishing of all sentient life, extending to those animals that have some level of similar sentience, such as [[Great Ape personhood]]. Others go farther, declaring that life itself is of intrinsic value.

By another approach, one achieves peace and agreement by focusing, not on one's peers (who may be rivals or competitors), but on the common environment.  The reasoning:  As living beings it is clearly and objectively good that we are surrounded by an [[ecosystem]] that supports [[life]]. Indeed, if we weren't, we could neither discuss that good nor even recognize it. The [[anthropic principle]] in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] recognizes this view.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Under [[materialism]] or even [[embodied cognition|embodiment]] values, or in any system that recognizes the validity of [[ecology]] as a scientific study of limits and potentials, an ecosystem is a fundamental good. To all who investigate, it seems that goodness, or value, exists within an ecosystem, [[Earth]]. Creatures within that ecosystem and wholly dependent on it, evaluate good relative to what else could be achieved there. In other words,  good is situated in a particular place and one does not dismiss everything that is not available there (such as very low gravity or absolutely abundant sugar candy) as "not good enough", one works within its constraints. Transcending them and learning to be satisfied with them, is thus another sort of value, perhaps called [[Contentment|satisfaction]].

Values and the people that hold them seem necessarily subordinate to the ecosystem. If this is so, then what kind of being could validly apply the word "good" to an ecosystem as a whole? Who would have the power to assess and judge an ecosystem as good or bad? By what criteria? And by what criteria would ecosystems be modified, especially larger ones such as the [[atmosphere]] ([[climate change]]) or [[ocean]]s ([[extinction]]) or [[forests]] ([[deforestation]])?&lt;ref&gt;For discussion, see debates on [[monoculture]] and [[permaculture]].&lt;/ref&gt;

"Remaining on Earth" as the most basic value. While [[green politics|green]] [[list of ethicists|ethicists]] have been most forthright about it, and have developed theories of [[Gaia philosophy]], [[biophilia hypothesis|biophilia]], [[bioregionalism]] that reflect it, the questions are now universally recognized as central in determining value, e.g. the economic "[[value of Earth]]" to humans as a whole, or the "[[value of life]]" that is neither whole-Earth nor human. Many have come to the conclusion that without assuming ecosystem continuation as a universal good, with attendant [[virtue]]s like [[biodiversity]] and [[ecological wisdom]] it is impossible to justify such operational requirements as [[sustainability]] of human activity on Earth.

One response is that humans are not necessarily confined to Earth, and could use it and move on. A counter-argument is that only a tiny fraction of humans could do this—and they would be self-selected by ability to do [[technological escalation]] on others (for instance, the ability to create large spacecraft to flee the planet in, and simultaneously fend off others who seek to prevent them). Another counter-argument is that [[extraterrestrial life]] would encounter the fleeing humans and destroy them as a [[locust]] species. A third is that if there are no other worlds fit to support life (and no [[extraterrestrials]] who compete with [[humans]] to occupy them) it is both futile to flee, and foolish to imagine that it would take less energy and skill to protect the Earth as a [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] than it would take to construct some new habitat.

Accordingly, remaining on Earth, as a living being surrounded by a working ecosystem, is a fair statement of the most basic values and goodness to any being we are able to communicate with. A moral system without this axiom seems simply not actionable.

However, most religious systems acknowledge an [[afterlife]] and improving this is seen as an even more basic good. In many other moral systems, also, remaining on Earth in a state that lacks [[honour|honor]] or power over self is less desirable—consider [[seppuku]] in [[bushido]], [[kamikaze]]s or the role of [[suicide attack]]s in [[Jihadi]] rhetoric. In all these systems, remaining on Earth is perhaps no higher than a third-place value.

Radical values [[environmentalism]] can be seen as either a very old or a very new view: that the only intrinsically good thing is a flourishing ecosystem; individuals and societies are merely instrumentally valuable,  good only as means to having a flourishing ecosystem. The [[Gaia philosophy]] is the most detailed expression of this overall thought but it strongly influenced [[deep ecology]] and the modern [[Green Parties]].

It is often claimed that [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] peoples never lost this sort of view. [[Anthropological linguistics]] studies links between their languages and the ecosystems they lived in, which gave rise to their [[knowledge]] distinctions. Very often, environmental cognition and [[moral]] cognition were not distinguished in these languages. Offenses to nature were like those to other people, and [[Animism]] reinforced this by giving nature "personality" via [[mythology|myth]]. [[Anthropological theories of value]] explore these questions.

Most people in the world reject older [[situated ethics]] and localized religious views. However small-community-based and ecology-centric views have gained some popularity in recent years. In part, this has been attributed to the desire for ethical certainties. Such a deeply rooted definition of goodness would be valuable because it might allow one to construct a good life or society by reliable processes of deduction, elaboration or prioritisation. Ones that relied only on local referents one could verify for oneself, creating more certainty and therefore less investment in protection, hedging and insuring against consequences of loss of the value.

===History and novelty===
{{wikiquote|goodness}}
{{wikiquote|evil}}

An event is often seen as being of value simply because of its ''novelty'' in fashion and art. By contrast, cultural history and other antiques are sometimes seen as of value in and of themselves due to their ''age''. Philosopher-historians Will and Ariel Durant spoke as much with the quote, "As the sanity of the individual lies in the continuity of his memories, so the sanity of the group lies in the continuity of its traditions; in either case a break in the chain invites a neurotic reaction" (The Lessons of History, 72).

Assessment of the value of old or historical artifacts takes into consideration, especially but not exclusively: the value placed on having a detailed knowledge of the past, the desire to have tangible ties to ancestral history, or the increased market value scarce items traditionally hold.

[[Creativity]] and [[innovation]] and [[invention]] are sometimes upheld as fundamentally good especially in Western industrial society—all imply newness, and even opportunity to profit from novelty. [[Bertrand Russell]] was notably pessimistic about creativity and thought that [[knowledge]] expanding faster than [[wisdom]] necessarily was fatal.

==Goodness and morality in biology==
The issue of good and evil in the human visuality, often associated with [[morality]], is regarded by some biologists (notably [[E. O. Wilson|Edward O. Wilson]], [[Jeremy Griffith]], [[David Sloan Wilson]] and [[Frans de Waal]]) as an important question to be addressed by the field of biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Edward Osborne |last=Wilson |authorlink= E.

The '''Green Scare''' is legal action by the [[US government]] against the radical [[environmental movement]]. It alludes to the [[Red Scare]]s, periods of fear over [[communist]] infiltration of US society.

The term was popularized by [[environmental activist]]s. It is first known to have appeared in 2002 in the wake of the February 12 congressional hearings titled "The Threat of Eco-Terrorism", which discussed groups including the [[Earth Liberation Front]] (ELF) and the [[Animal Liberation Front]] (ALF).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/congress/congress02/jarboe021202.htm Federal Bureau of Investigation - Congressional Testimony&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021002120937/http://www.fbi.gov/congress/congress02/jarboe021202.htm |date=2002-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The spring edition of the prisoner support [[zine]] ''Spirit of Freedom'' defined the term as "the tactics that the US government and all their tentacles ([[FBI]], [[IRS]], [[BATF]], [[Joint Terrorism Task Force]]s, local police, the court system) are using to attack the ELF/ALF and specifically those who publicly support them."

The term has been used by activists to describe a sweep of arrests, convictions and [[grand jury]] indictments of ELF and ALF operatives on charges relating to acts of [[property damage]], [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]], [[arson]] and use of [[destructive device]]s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/page2/jan06/elf012006.htm Federal Bureau of Investigation - Press Room - Headline Archives - Eco-Terror Indictments&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817222138/http://www.fbi.gov/page2/jan06/elf012006.htm |date=2010-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cases ==
Since 2000, the [[US government]] has prosecuted over 20 cases involving [[environmentalist]]s, which ''[[Los Angeles CityBeat]]'' claims "redefined not only free speech, but also redefined environmentally motivated property destruction - like torching [[Hummer]]s or tree-felling equipment." &lt;ref name="CityBeat"&gt;[[Dean Kuipers]], [http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=5450&amp;IssueNum=204 The Green Scare] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324070221/http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=5450&amp;IssueNum=204 |date=2008-03-24 }}, ''[[Los Angeles CityBeat]]'', 3 May 2007,&lt;/ref&gt; These arrests, indictments and trials, which have collectively been termed the ''Green Scare'' by [[environmentalist]]s, include:

'''Heckler's veto''' is an [[Free speech in the United States|American free speech]] term describing situations in which a party who disagrees with a speaker's message is able to unilaterally trigger events that result in the speaker being silenced.

In the legal sense, a heckler's veto occurs when the speaker's right is curtailed or restricted by the government in order to prevent a ''reacting party's'' behavior. The common example is the termination of a speech or demonstration in the interest of maintaining the public peace based on the anticipated negative reaction of someone opposed to that speech or demonstration. The term was coined by  [[University of Chicago]] professor of law [[Harry Kalven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Nazi/Skokie Conflict: A Civil Liberties Battle |first=David |last=Hamlin |location=Boston |publisher=Beacon Press |year=1980 |page=57 |isbn=0-8070-3230-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2017|reason=The current citation, Kalven's 1980 book, does not support this contention.

Colloquially, the term is used to describe situations where [[hecklers]] or demonstrators silence a speaker without intervention of the law.

== Law ==
[[Case law in the United States|In the United States]], [[case law]] regarding the heckler's veto is mixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGaffey|first=Ruth|date=1973|title=The Heckler's Veto|url=https://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/mulr/vol57/iss1/3|journal=Marquette Law Review|volume=57|pages=39-64|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most findings say that the acting party's actions cannot be pre-emptively stopped due to ''fear'' of heckling by the reacting party, but in the immediate face of violence, authorities can force the acting party to cease their action in order to satisfy the hecklers.

The best known case involving the heckler's veto is probably ''[[Feiner v. New York]]'', handed down by the Supreme Court in 1951.  Chief Justice [[Fred M. Vinson]], writing for the majority, held that police officers acted within their power in arresting a speaker if the arrest was "motivated solely by a proper concern for the preservation of order and protection of the general welfare".  340 U.S. 315.

In ''[[Gregory v. Chicago]]'' (1969), Justice [[Hugo Black]], in a concurring opinion, argued that arresting demonstrators as a consequence of unruly behavior of by-standers would amount to a heckler's veto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2280&amp;context=mulr&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3D%2522gregory%2520v.%2520chicago%2522%2520%2522heckler%27s%2520veto%2522%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D1%26ved%3D0CB4QFjAA%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fscholarship.law.marquette.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D2280%2526context%253Dmulr%26ei%3DhwobT6bCC4KwiQKyroWwCA%26usg%3DAFQjCNEmEqL_BCo_q6ztr-M8oQXxLcWTPg#search=%22gregory%20v.%20chicago%20hecklers%20veto%22|title= The Heckler's Veto: A Reexamination|author=|date=|website=marquette.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was rejected in ''[[Hill v. Colorado]]'' (2000),&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite court  |litigants = Hill v. Colorado  |vol = 530 U.S. 703, 735  |reporter =   |opinion =   |pinpoint =   |court = [[SCOTUS]]  |year = 2000  |url=http://supreme.vlex.com/vid/hill-v-colorado-20080806 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where the [[SCOTUS|Supreme Court]] rejected the "Heckler's Veto," finding "governmental grants of power to private actors" to be "constitutionally problematic" in cases where "the regulations allowed a single, private actor to unilaterally silence a speaker".&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

== Other uses of the phrase ==
Heckler's veto is often used outside a strict legal context. One example is an article by [[Nat Hentoff]] in which he claims that "First Amendment law is clear that everyone has the right to picket a speaker, and to go inside the hall and heckle him or her—but not to drown out the speaker, let alone rush the stage and stop the speech before it starts. That's called the 'heckler's veto'."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0645,hentoff,74928,2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hentoff's formulation, the heckler him or herself is the party which directly carries out the "veto" and suppresses speech. This runs counter to the legal meaning of the phrase. Note that, to a lawyer familiar with the First Amendment law, the phrase "heckler's veto" means something different from what the plain English interpretation of the words suggests. In First Amendment law, a heckler's veto is the suppression of speech by the government, because of [the possibility of] a violent reaction by hecklers. It is the government that vetoes the speech, because of the reaction of the heckler. Under the First Amendment, this kind of heckler's veto is unconstitutional.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbs2.com/heckler.htm|title=Heckler's Veto|first=Dr. Ronald B.|last=Standler|date=|website=www.rbs2.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University of California, Berkeley]] Law School Dean [[Erwin Chemerinsky]] has invoked the concept in an editorial following an incident on February 8, 2010, in which heckling by individual students disrupted a speech by the [[List of Israeli ambassadors to the United States|Israeli ambassador]] [[Michael Oren]]. Chemerinsky explained that broad freedom exists to invite speakers and hold demonstrations, but that once a speaker has begun an invited lecture, “You have the right—if you disagree with me—to go outside and perform your protest. But you don’t get the right to come in when I’m talking and shout me down. Otherwise people can always silence a speaker by heckler’s veto, and [[Tower of Babel|Babel]] results”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Israel: Interrupted in Irvine |first=David |last=Lumb |date=Feb 15, 2010 |publisher=[[New University (newspaper)|New University]] |url=http://www.newuniversity.org/2010/02/news/israel-interrupted-in-irvine/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michigan State University]] professor of political science [[William B. Allen]] has used the phrase "verbal terrorism" to refer to the same phenomenon, defining it as "calculated assault characterized by loud side-conversations, shouted interruptions, jabbered false facts, threats and personal insults".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ending racial preferences: the Michigan story |first=Carol M. |last=Allen |location=Lanham |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2008 |page=56 |isbn=978-0-7391-2433-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative writer and commentator [[Ben Shapiro]] cited the term during a 2017 testimony to Congress in reference to suppression of right-wing speakers on college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oMblRBElJk|title=Ben Shapiro Crushes Anti-Free Speech College Snowflakes Before Congress|first=|last=THE LIBERTY DAILY|date=27 July 2017|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''infinite canvas''' refers to the potentially limitless space that is available to [[webcomics]] presented on the [[World Wide Web]]. The term was introduced by [[Scott McCloud]] in his 2000 book ''[[Reinventing Comics]]'', in which he suggested that webcomic creators could make a [[Web page]] as large as needed to contain a comic page of any conceivable size. This infinite canvas would create an endless amount of storytelling benefits and would allow creators much more freedom in how they present their artwork.

Journalists responded skeptically to McCloud's idea of the infinite canvas, as five years after ''Reinventing Comics'', the concept had not taken off in large proportions yet. Webcomics were primarily presented in the form of [[comic strips]], which fit easily on a screen. Various webcomic creators have experimented with the infinite canvas, however, and extending comics to beyond what is possible in print has gained some popularity over the years.

==Description==
[[File:Comic reading order.png|thumb|right|McCloud considered the reading order for a traditional comic page complex, as adjacent panels do not always represent "adjacent" moments.&lt;ref name=ReinventingComics /&gt;|alt=Nine empty panels are shown in a 3-by-3 grid. Arrows demonstrate the traditional reading order, pointing from the first panel of the first row to the third panel of the first row, down to the first panel of the second row and so on.]]
In [[comic books]], the panels of each page are laid out in such as a way to fit perfectly on the page, forcing cartoonists into a relatively small set of possible panel lay-outs per page. In his 2000 book ''Reinventing Comics'', cartoonist Scott McCloud proposed a solution for this situation in the form of the web page. Instead of using the monitor on which a webcomic is read as a "page", McCloud suggested using it as a "window" upon an infinite canvas. A webcomic could be made to be infinitely large, and the cartoonist could give a reader the ability to [[zooming user interface|zoom in and out]] on it at will. McCloud claimed webcomics could be laid out in any shape: vertically like a tower, horizontally like a skyline, diagonally like a descending staircase, or even three dimensionally like a revolving cube.&lt;ref name=ReinventingComics&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Reinventing Comics]]|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|last=McCloud|first=Scott|author-link=Scott McCloud|year=2000|page=220&amp;ndash;229|isbn=0-06-095350-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to David Balan of ''[[Sequart Organization]]'', webcomics with pages of limited size that use [[hyperlinks]] to move forward in the story consistently take the reader out of the experience, as there exists no visual link between any two pages. This issue is solved with a long, scrollable canvas, where the webcomic is presented as one long image. Such a webcomic may drag on, however, due to a lack of rhythm or punctuated story beats. Balan praised McCloud's 2003 webcomic ''[[The Right Number]]'' for its zooming interface, which would have the same benefits as other infinite canvas formats, but still allows for a certain rhythm to exist.&lt;ref name=Sequart&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sequart.org/magazine/4728/the-right-number-–-a-new-reading-convention/|work=[[Sequart Organization]]|title=The Right Number – A New Reading Convention|last=Balan|first=David|date=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists known for making persistent use of the infinite canvas in the early 2000s include [[Cayetano Garza]], [[demian5]], [[Patrick Farley]], [[Tristan A. Farnon]] and David Gaddis.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Webcomics|publisher=[[Antarctic Press]]|last=Campbell|first=T.|date=2006-06-08|isbn=0976804395|pages=17-18, 30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observations and responses==
In 2005, Sarah Boxer of ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that the infinite canvas was hard to find in use, as many webcomic were sticking to a printable format. A few, however, like Nicholas Gurewitch's ''[[The Perry Bible Fellowship]]'' and [[Drew Weing]]'s ''Pup'', did make use of the format (''Pup'' won a [[Web Cartoonists' Choice Award]] in the "infinite canvas" category in 2005). Boxer pointed out that most popular webcomics either fit on a webpage easily &amp;ndash; such as Adrian Ramos's ''[[Count Your Sheep]]'' &amp;ndash; or attempted to use various aspects of the digital medium, such as [[Flash animation]] and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/17/books/comics-escape-a-paper-box-and-electronic-questions-pop-out.html|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|title=Comics Escape a Paper Box, and Electronic Questions Pop Out|last=Boxer|first=Sarah|date=2005-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, [[Joe Zabel]] also noted that the primary purpose for the infinite canvas would be to create lengthy and deep works on the Web, while [[comic strips]] like ''[[PvP]]'' and ''[[Penny Arcade]]'' showed to have much more success in this environment. Because of the time that would go into any page of an infinite canvas comic, Zabel deemed it unlikely for such webcomics to gain a large popularity. Journalist [[Eric Burns]], meanwhile, claimed that McCloud was mainly discussing the potential of webcomics, rather than what they are actually like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcomicsreview.com/examiner/issue050912/history1.html|publisher=''[[The Webcomics Examiner]]''|title=The Artistic History of Webcomics &amp;ndash; A Webcomics Examiner Roundtable|author=Various|year=2005|archive-date=2005-11-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124120515/http://webcomicsreview.com/examiner/issue050912/history1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview in 2008, Scot McCloud said that in ''Reinventing Comics'' he was "shooting for the moon, in hopes that we could create these radical departures from traditional comics," noting that "most online comics are still pretty conservative in format and style" but also that "there have been some impressive strides in that direction." McCloud specified that he was still keeping an eye on things that needed to happen for the infinite canvas to take off, saying that "the notion of Web applications being as robust as desktop applications has placed us closer to that hope that we may finally be able to create those spaces in a seamless way online. Right now, it's very difficult to do that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xconomy.com/national/2008/09/10/the-infinite-canvas-an-interview-with-scott-mccloud-the-google-chrome-comic-guy/|work=[[Xconomy]]|title=The Infinite Canvas: An Interview with Scott McCloud, the Google Chrome Comic Guy|last=Roush|first=Wade|date=2008-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview in 2014, McCloud said that "without a reliable financial structure to support these experimental webcomics, a lot of people just turn away and get a real job, or start doing three-panel gag strips. Those have an [[Webcomics and income|economic model]] that works."&lt;ref name=2014interview&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2014/10/07/best-american-comics-2014-guest-editor-scott-mccloud-illuminates-the-range-of-modern-brilliance-in-new-must-read-qa/|work=[[the Washington Post]]|title='BEST AMERICAN COMICS 2014': Guest editor Scott McCloud illuminates the range of modern brilliance in new must-read [Q+A]|last=Cavna|first=Michael|date=2014-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the format's popularity, a large amount of cartoonists have created infinite canvas webcomics over the years; in the book ''Storytelling in the Media Convergence Age'', cartoonist Daniel Goodbrew states that "the infinite canvas has remained a popular choice among webcomic creators."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Storytelling in the Media Convergence Age: Exploring Screen Narratives|publisher=[[Springer (publisher)|Springer]]|last1=Pearson|first1=R.|last2=Smith|first2=A.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y_S3BgAAQBAJ|date=2014-12-18|isbn=1137388153}}&lt;/ref&gt; The infinite canvas has shown more success in Europe and Australia than in North America. The infinite canvas has obtained a large popularity among South Korean [[webtoons]]: McCloud noted in 2014 that "most digital comics are [[scrolling|scrollers]] in Korea."&lt;ref name=2014interview /&gt;

In 2005, [[Daniel Merlin Goodbrey]] created the "Tarquin Engine", a piece of Web software that uses [[Adobe Flash]] to depict an infinite canvas that a reader can freely scroll through and zoom in on. It greatly simplified the production of infinite canvas webcomics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchprofiles.herts.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/the-tarquin-engine(97678b47-06d7-4551-9def-5dc987991b71)/export.html|publisher=[[University of Hertfordshire]]|title=The Tarquin Engine|last=Goodbrey|first=Daniel Merlin|author-link=Daniel Merlin Goodbrey|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcomicsreview.com/?p=151&amp;page=3 |work=The Webcomics Examiner |title=Making Lightning &amp;ndash; An Interview with Scott McCloud |last=Zabel |first=Joe |author-link=Joe Zabel |date=2006-06-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324025118/http://webcomicsreview.com/?p=151&amp;page=3 |archive-date=2008-03-24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tool is not widely used. In 2009, [[Microsoft Live Labs]] released an infinite canvas [[web application]], which reached a wider audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=hnuQBQAAQBAJ&amp;dq="The+Right+Number"+McCloud&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Comics through Time: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas|last=Booker|first=M.

In 2013, Yvyes Bigerel and [[Mark Waid]] of [[Marvel Comics]] launched an initiative to create and publish digital comics under the title [[Marvel ReEvolution]]. While creating these webcomics, Bigerel and Waid were inspired by the manner in which time is experienced within comics, as the passage of time in a comic book is ultimately controlled by its reader. Rather than to allow readers to skim through the images on a whim or to increase the space between panels as McCloud suggested, the duo stacked the panels up "like a [[PowerPoint]] slideshow," forcing the reader to look at one panel at a time. According to ''[[Comic Book Resources]]'', this design directly affects how a comic is created and read, as surprises can be better controlled and a letterer could directly control the reading order of text balloons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2013/06/the-digital-evolution-from-infinite-canvas-to-infinite-comics/|publisher=''[[Comic Book Resources]]''|title=The digital evolution: from infinite canvas to infinite comics|last=Blake|first=Corey|date=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rachel Edidin of ''[[Wired (website)|Wired]]'' said of ''Wolverine: Japan's Most Wanted'' and ''Iron Man: Fatal Frontier'' that "these are comics that truly feel native to the digital format."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/07/marvel-iron-man-infinite-comics/|work=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|title=Exclusive: Marvel Rebuilds Iron Man for the Infinite Canvas of Digital Comics|last=Edidin|first=Rachel|date=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Union for Conservation of Nature''' ('''IUCN'''; officially '''International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About |publisher=IUCN |quote=The organisation changed its name to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources in 1956 with the acronym IUCN (or UICN in French and Spanish). This remains our full legal name to this day. |url=https://www.iucn.org/about|date=2014-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[international organization]] working in the field of [[nature conservation]] and sustainable use of [[natural resource]]s. It is involved in data gathering and analysis, research, field projects, advocacy, and education. IUCN's mission is to "influence, encourage and assist societies throughout the world to conserve nature and to ensure that any use of natural resources is equitable and ecologically sustainable".

Over the past decades, IUCN has widened its focus beyond conservation ecology and now incorporates issues related to [[sustainable development]] in its projects. Unlike many other international environmental organisations, IUCN does not itself aim to mobilize the public in support of nature conservation. It tries to influence the actions of governments, business and other stakeholders by providing information and advice, and through building partnerships. The organization is best known to the wider public for compiling and publishing the [[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]], which assesses the conservation status of species worldwide.&lt;ref name=About /&gt;

IUCN has a membership of over 1400 governmental and non-governmental organizations. Some 16,000 scientists and experts participate in the work of IUCN commissions on a voluntary basis. It employs approximately 1000 full-time staff in more than 50 countries. Its headquarters are in [[Gland, Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=About &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iucn.org/about |title=About IUCN|publisher=IUCN |accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IUCN has [[Observer status#United Nations|observer]] and [[consultative status]] at the [[United Nations]], and plays a role in the implementation of several international conventions on nature conservation and [[biodiversity]].  It was involved in establishing the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and the [[World Conservation Monitoring Centre]]. In the past, IUCN has been criticized for placing the interests of nature over those of indigenous peoples. In recent years, its closer relations with the business sector have caused controversy.&lt;ref name="wrm.org.uy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kenya: The Maasai Stand up to IUCN Displacement Attempts from their Forest|url=http://www.wrm.org.uy/oldsite/bulletin/84/Kenya.html|website=World Rainforest Movement|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Block |first=Ben |title=Environmentalists Spar Over Corporate Ties|type=updated version |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5934|website=[[Worldwatch Institute]]. worldwatch.org|accessdate=26 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

IUCN was established in 1948. It was previously called the '''International Union for the Protection of Nature''' (1948–1956) and the '''World Conservation Union''' (1990–2008).

===Overview===
'''Establishment'''&lt;ref name="holdgate"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holdgate|first1=Martin|title=The green web: a union for world conservation|date=1999|publisher=Earthscan|isbn=1 85383 595 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16–38}}

IUCN was established on [[5 October]] [[1948]], in [[Fontainebleau]], France, when representatives of governments and conservation organizations signed a formal act constituting the International Union for the Protection of Nature (IUPN). The initiative to set up the new organisation came from [[UNESCO]] and especially from its first Director General, the British biologist [[Julian Huxley]]. [[File:Julian Huxley 1964.jpg|thumb|Julian Huxley, the first Director General of UNESCO, took the initiative to set up IUCN]] The objectives of the new Union were to encourage international cooperation in the protection of nature, to promote national and international action and to compile, analyse and distribute information. At the time of its founding IUPN was the only international organisation focusing on the entire spectrum of nature conservation (an international organisation for the protection of birds, now [[BirdLife International]], had been established in 1922.)

'''Early years: 1948–1956'''&lt;ref name="holdgate" /&gt;{{rp|47–63}}&lt;br /&gt;
IUPN started out with 65 members. Its secretariat was located in Brussels. Its first work program focused on saving species and habitats, increasing and applying knowledge, advancing education, promoting international agreements and promoting conservation. Providing a solid scientific base for conservation action was the heart of all activities; commissions were set up to involve experts and scientists.

IUPN and UNESCO were closely associated. They jointly organized the 1949 Conference on Protection of Nature ([[Lake Success, New York|Lake Success]], USA). In preparation for this conference a list of gravely endangered species was drawn up for the first time, a precursor of the [[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]]. In the early years of its existence IUCN depended almost entirely on UNESCO funding and was forced to temporarily scale down activities when this ended unexpectedly in 1954.

IUPN was successful in engaging prominent scientists and identifying important issues such as the harmful effects of [[pesticide]]s on wildlife but not many of the ideas it developed were turned into action. This was caused by unwillingness to act on the part of governments, uncertainty about the IUPN mandate and lack of resources. In 1956, IUPN changed its name to International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.

'''Increased profile and recognition: 1956–1965'''&lt;ref name="holdgate" /&gt;{{rp|67–82}}&lt;br /&gt;
In the 1950s and 1960s Europe entered a period of economic growth and formal colonies became independent. Both developments had impact on the work of IUCN. Through the voluntary (i.e. ''[[pro bono]]'') involvement of experts in its Commissions IUCN was able to get a lot of work done while still operating on a low budget. It expanded its relations with UN-agencies and established links with the [[Council of Europe]]. In 1961, at the request of [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC), the United Nations Economic and Social Council, IUCN published the first global list of national parks and protected areas which it has updated ever since. IUCN's best known publication, the Red Data Book on the conservation status of species, was first published in 1964.&lt;br /&gt;
IUCN began to play a part in the development of international treaties and conventions, starting with the [[African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]]. Environmental law and policy making became a new area of expertise. [[File:Ngorongoro-Crater-Morning-Scene.JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|Africa was the first regional focus of IUCN conservation action]]
Africa was the focus of many of the early IUCN conservation field projects. IUCN supported the ‘Yellowstone model’ of protected area management, which severely restricted human presence and activity in order to protect nature. IUCN and other conservation organisations were criticized for protecting nature against people rather than with people. This model was initially also applied in Africa and played a role in the decision to remove the [[Maasai people]] from [[Serengeti]] National Park and the [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]].&lt;ref name="wrm.org.uy"/&gt;

To establish a stable financial basis for its work, IUCN participated in setting up the World Wildlife Fund (1961) (now the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] WWF). WWF would work on fundraising, public relations, and increasing public support. IUCN would continue to focus on providing sound science and data, and developing ties with international bodies. Funds raised by WWF would be used to cover part of the operational costs of IUCN. Also in 1961, the IUCN headquarters moved from Belgium to [[Morges]] in Switzerland.

'''Consolidating its position in the international environmental movement: 1966–1975'''&lt;ref name="holdgate" /&gt;{{rp|110–124}}&lt;br /&gt;
Public concerns about the state of the environment in the sixties and seventies led to the establishment of new NGOs, some of which (e.g. [[Greenpeace]] and [[Friends of the Earth]]) also worked globally. Many of these new organisations were more activist and critical of government than IUCN which remained committed to providing science-based advice to governments. As a result, IUCN was criticized by some as being old-fashioned and irrelevant.

IUCN’s membership still grew (from 200 in 1961 to 350 in 1974) and its formal standing and influence increased. A grant from the [[Ford Foundation]] in 1969 enabled it to boost its secretariat and expand operations. During the 1960s, IUCN lobbied the UN General Assembly to create a new status for NGOs. Resolution 1296, adopted in 1968, granted 'consultative' status to NGOs. IUCN itself was eventually accredited with six UN organizations.&lt;ref name="Understanding NGOs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding NGOs|url=https://agendatwentyone.wordpress.com/2010/06/28/understanding-ngos-non-government-organizations/ |website=agendatwentyone.wordpress.com |publisher=[[WordPress.com]]|accessdate=5 December 2014|date=2010-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IUCN was one of the few environmental organisations formally involved in the preparations of the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] (Stockholm, 1972). The Stockholm Conference eventually led to three new international conventions, with IUCN involved in their drafting and implementation:
* [[World Heritage Site|Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage]] (1972). IUCN co-drafted the World Heritage Convention with UNESCO and has been involved as the official Advisory Body on nature from the onset.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iucn.org/theme/world-heritage/about/iucn-and-world-heritage|title=IUCN and World Heritage|date=2015-11-10|work=IUCN|access-date=2017-07-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[CITES]]- the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (1974) IUCN is a signatory party and the CITES secretariat was originally lodged with IUCN.
* [[Ramsar Convention]] – Convention on Wetlands of International Importance (1975). The secretariat is still administered from IUCN's headquarters.

IUCN entered into an agreement with the United Nations Environment Programme [[UNEP]] to provide regular reviews of world conservation. The income this generated, combined with growing revenue via WWF, put the organisation on relatively sound financial footing for the first time since 1948.

This period saw the beginning of a gradual change in IUCN’s approach to conservation. Ensuring the survival of habitats and species remained its key objective, but there was a growing awareness that economic and social demands had to be taken into account. IUCN started to publish guidelines on sustainable development. In 1975 the IUCN General Assembly passed a resolution to retain indigenous peoples and cater for their traditional rights in National Parks and protected areas. As a result, IUCN became more appealing to organisations and governments in the developing world.

{{anchor|World Conservation Strategy}}
'''The World Conservation Strategy 1975–1985'''&lt;ref name="holdgate" /&gt;{{rp|132–165}}&lt;br /&gt;
In the late seventies, between its General Assemblies in [[Kinshasha]] (1975) and [[Ashkabad]] (1978), IUCN went through a phase of turbulence in governance and management. Its work program continued to grow, in part as a result of the partnership with WWF. In 1978, IUCN was running 137 projects, largely in the global south. The involvement of representatives from the developing world in the IUCN Council, Committees and staff increased.
In 1975 IUCN started work on the ''World Conservation Strategy''. [[File:Myanmar Illicit Endangered Wildlife Market 06.jpg|thumb|Stopping illegal trade of wildlife is one of IUCN's priorities]]The drafting process – and the discussions with the UN agencies involved – led to an evolution in thinking within IUCN and growing acceptance of the fact that conservation of nature by banning human presence no longer worked. (The debate about the balance between strict nature protection and conservation through sustainable development would, however, continue within IUCN well into the 1999
s.) The ''World Conservation Strategy'' was launched in 35 countries simultaneously on 5 March 1980. It set out fundamental principles and objectives for conservation worldwide, and identified priorities for national and international action. It is considered one of the most influential documents in 20th century nature conservation and one of the first official documents to introduce the concept of sustainable development. The Strategy was followed in 1982 by the ''[[World Charter for Nature]]'', which was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]], after preparation by IUCN.

In 1980, IUCN and WWF moved into shared new offices in [[Gland, Switzerland]]. This marked a phase of closer cooperation with WWF. It was the support of WWF that allowed IUCN to weather a financial crisis in 1980–1982. The close ties between IUCN and WWF were severed in 1985 when WWF decided to take control of its own field projects, which so far had been run by IUCN. In 1989, IUCN moved into a separate building in Gland, close to the offices it had shared with WWF.

'''Sustainable development and regionalisation: 1985 to present day'''&lt;ref name="holdgate" /&gt;{{rp|176–222}}&lt;br /&gt;
In 1982, IUCN set up a Conservation for Development Centre within its secretariat. The Centre undertook projects to ensure that nature conservation was integrated in development aid and in the economic policies of developing countries. Over the years, it supported the development of national conservation strategies in 30 countries. Several European countries began to channel considerable amounts of bilateral aid via IUCN’s projects. Management of these projects was primarily done by IUCN staff, often working from the new regional and country offices IUCN set up around the world. This marked a shift within the organisation. Previously the volunteer Commissions had been very influential, now the Secretariat and its staff began to play a more dominant role. Initially, the focus of power was still with the Headquarters in Gland but the regional offices and regional members’ groups gradually got a bigger say in operations.

In spite of the increased attention for sustainable development, the protection of habitats and species remained a core activity of IUCN. Special programs were developed for Antarctica, tropical forests and wetlands, and IUCN expanded its operations in Latin America.

In 1991, IUCN (together with UNEP and WWF) published ''Caring for the Earth'', a successor to the World Conservation Strategy. It was published in the run-up to the [[Earth Summit]], the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro. The ''World Conservation Strategy'', ''Caring for the Earth'', and the ''Global Diversity Strategy ''(also published in 1992 by UNEP, IUCN, and WRI) are considered hugely influential in shaping the global environmental agenda. They lay the foundations for the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], a new global treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity developed by UNEP with support from IUCN, the [[Framework Convention on Climate Change]] and [[Agenda 21]].&lt;ref name="Understanding NGOs"/&gt;

Social aspects of conservation were now integrated in IUCN’s work; projects began to take account of the role of women in natural resource management and to value the knowledge indigenous peoples have about their natural environment.  At the General Assembly in 1994 the IUCN mission was redrafted to its current wording to include the equitable and ecologically use of natural resources.

IUCN’s current work makes direct contributions towards achieving the [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. In particular, IUCN’s Programme 2017–2020 focusing on SDG 1 (No poverty), SDG 2 (Zero hunger), SDG 3 (Good health and well-being), SDG 5 (Gender equality), SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation), SDG 10 (Reduced inequalities), SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and communities), SDG 13 (Climate action), SDG 14 (Life below water), SDG 15 (Life on land), SDG 16 (Peace, justice and strong institutions), SDG 17 (Partnerships for the goals).&lt;ref name="IUCN Programme"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iucn.org/about/programme-work-and-reporting/programme|title=IUCN Programme|last=|first=|date=2015-10-01|work=IUCN|access-date=2017-07-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:IUCN-Headquarters.jpg|thumb|IUCN-Headquarters in Gland, Switzerland]]

'''Closer to business: 2000 to present day'''&lt;br /&gt;
Since the creation of IUCN in 1948, IUCN Members have passed more than 300 resolutions that include or focus on business related activities. The range of topics covers in these resolutions varies greatly, including a focus on fisheries, tourism, agriculture, the extractive industries and the business sector in general.

The increased attention on sustainable development as a means to protect nature brought IUCN closer to the corporate sector. A discussion started about cooperation with business, including the question if commercial companies could become IUCN members. The members decided against this, but IUCN did forge a partnership with the [[World Business Council for Sustainable Development]]. IUCN renewed a multi-year MOU with them with WBCSD in December 2015.

In 1996, after decades of seeking to address specific business issues, IUCN’s Members asked for a comprehensive approach to engaging the business sector. Resolution 1.81 of the IUCN World Conservation Congress held that year “urged IUCN Members and the Director General, based on the need to influence private sector policies in support of the Mission of IUCN, to expand dialogue and productive relationships with the private sector and find new ways to interact with members of the business community”.

The IUCN Global Business and Biodiversity Program (BBP) was established in 2003 to influence and support private partners in addressing environmental and social issues. The Program wants to engage with business sectors that have a significant impact on natural resources and livelihoods to promote sustainable use of natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Business and Biodiversity Programme|url=http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/business/|website=IUCN|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the first IUCN Private Sector Engagement Strategy was developed (in response to Council Decision C/58/41). 
Most prominent in the Business and Biodiversity Program is the five-year collaboration IUCN started with the energy company [[Shell International]] in 2007. The aim was to mitigate the environmental impact of Shell's operations.  The partnership almost immediately came under fire from IUCN's members, especially the NGO-members who feared for IUCN’s reputation. At the World Conservation Congress (formerly the IUCN General Assembly) in Barcelona in 2008 NGO-members tabled a motion to terminate the Shell contract. The proposal was narrowly defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IUCN and Shell: Guiding the way|url=http://www.business-biodiversity.eu/default.asp?Menue=155&amp;News=434|website=Business &amp; Biodiversity|accessdate=5 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923195343/http://www.business-biodiversity.eu/default.asp?Menue=155&amp;News=434|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="worldwatch.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmentalists spar over corporate ties|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5934|website=Worldwatch|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, at the World Conservation Congress held in the Republic of South Korea, the Union adopted a more focused approach to enable IUCN to deliver both on‐the‐ground results and fit‐for‐purpose knowledge products, working with many agencies, including business. The Business Engagement Strategy (2012) calls on IUCN to prioritise engagement with business sectors that have a significant impact on natural resources and livelihoods. These include: large 'footprint' industries, such as: mining and oil and gas; biodiversity-dependent industries including fishing, agriculture and forestry; and, financial services and “green” enterprises such as organic farming, renewable energy and nature-based tourism.

Furthermore, the IUCN Operational Guidelines for Business Engagement offer critical support to the implementation of the IUCN Business Engagement Strategy. First developed in 2006, and then revised in 2009 and again in 2015, they provide a consistent approach to the management of risks associated with engaging business, as well as outline the opportunities between the different types of engagement.

Today, the Business and Biodiversity Programme continues to set the strategic direction, coordinate IUCN’s overall approach and provide institutional quality assurance in all business engagements. The Programme ensures that the Business Engagement Strategy is implemented through IUCN’s global thematic and regional programmes as well as helps guide the work of IUCN’s six Commissions.

'''Championing Nature-based Solutions: 2009 to present day'''

[[Nature Based Solutions|Nature-based Solutions (NbS)]] use ecosystems and the services they provide to address societal challenges such as climate change, food security or natural disasters.&lt;ref name="portals.iucn.org"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46191|title=Nature-based solutions to address global societal challenges {{!}} IUCN Library System|website=portals.iucn.org|access-date=2017-07-04|isbn=9782831718125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of the NbS concept in environmental sciences and nature conservation contexts came as international organisations, such as IUCN and the World Bank, searched for solutions to work with ecosystems rather than relying on conventional engineering interventions (such as seawalls), to adapt to and mitigate climate change effects, while improving sustainable livelihoods and protecting natural ecosystems and biodiversity.

IUCN actively promoted the NbS concept in its 2009 position paper on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP 15, and in 2012 IUCN formally adopted NbS as one of the three areas of work within its 2013–2016 Programme.&lt;ref name="portals.iucn.org"/&gt;

At the IUCN World Conservation Congress 2016, IUCN Members agreed on a definition of nature-based solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://portals.iucn.org/congress/motion/077|title=077 – Defining Nature-based Solutions {{!}} 2016 Congress portal|website=portals.iucn.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nature-based Solutions are defined as “actions to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits”. Members also called for governments to include nature-based solutions in strategies to combat climate change . A report, ''Nature-based solutions to address global societal challenges'', was launched at the Congress, and includes a set of general principles for any NbS intervention.&lt;ref name="portals.iucn.org"/&gt;

Implementing NbS at scale can help countries achieve the targets of Sustainable Development Goals. It can also help them achieve the [[land degradation]] neutrality goal of the UNCCD, the Aichi Biodiversity Targets of the CBD, and the Paris Agreement on climate change.

==Current work==

=== IUCN Programme 2017–2020 ===
According to its website, IUCN works on the following themes: business, [[climate change]], economics, [[ecosystems]], [[environmental law]], [[forest protection|forest conservation]], [[gender]], global policy, [[marine habitats|marine]] and [[polar regions|polar]], [[protected areas]], science and knowledge, [[social policy]], [[species]], water and [[world heritage sites|world heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What we do|url=http://www.iucn.org/what/|website=IUCN|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IUCN works on the basis of four-year programs, determined by the membership. In the IUCN Programme for 2017–2020 conserving nature and biodiversity is inextricably linked to sustainable development and poverty reduction.  IUCN states that it aims to have a solid factual base for its work and takes into account the knowledge held by indigenous groups and other traditional users of natural resources.

The IUCN Programme 2017–2020 identifies three priority areas:&lt;ref name="IUCN Programme"/&gt;

1. Valuing and conserving nature.

2. Promoting and supporting effective and equitable governance of natural resources

3. Deploying [[Nature Based Solutions]] to address societal challenges including climate change, food security and economic and social development.&lt;ref name="IUCN Programme" /&gt;

Unlike other environmental organisations, IUCN does not itself aim to directly mobilize the general public.  Education has been part of IUCN's work program since the early days but the focus is on stakeholder involvement and strategic communication rather than mass-campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CEC – what we do|url=http://www.iucn.org/about/union/commissions/cec/cec_what_we_do/|website=IUCN|accessdate=26 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226162000/http://www.iucn.org/about/union/commissions/cec/cec_what_we_do/|archivedate=26 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Habitats and species===
IUCN runs field projects for [[habitat conservation|habitat]] and species conservation around the world. It produces the [[IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] and the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems which in a similar way measures risks to ecosystems.
The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems is a global standard to assess the conservation status of ecosystems. It is applicable at local, national, regional and global levels. It is based on a set of rules, or criteria, for performing evidence-based, scientific assessments of the risk of ecosystem collapse, as measured by reductions in geographical distribution or degradation of the key processes and components of ecosystems.

IUCN participates in efforts to restore [[critically endangered]] species. In 2012 it published a list of [[the world's 100 most threatened species]]. It wants to expand the global network of [[national parks]] and other [[protected areas]] and promote good management of such areas, for example through the publication of the Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Green List' awards world's top conservation sites|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2014/11/iucn-sets-up-the-green-list|accessdate=18 November 2014|website=Australian Geographic|date=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; IUCN is the governing body responsible for the development of the [[IUCN Protected Area Management Categories|Protected Area Management Categories]] into which each protected area is divided depending on its conservation requirements and management aims. It also developed a standard to identify [[Key Biodiversity Areas]] — places of international importance for conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iucn.org/theme/protected-areas/wcpa/what-we-do/biodiversity-and-protected-areas/key-biodiversity-areas|title=Key Biodiversity Areas|date=2016-03-08|work=IUCN|access-date=2017-07-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, it focuses on greater protection of the [[oceans]] and [[marine habitats]].

=== Business partnerships ===
IUCN has a growing program of partnerships with the corporate sector to promote sustainable use of natural resources. Globally, IUCN collaborates with Black Mountain Mining, Nespresso, Rio Tinto, Sakhalin Energy Investment Company Ltd, Shell, Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria, Ltd., the International Olympic Committee, Natural Capital Coalition, Renova Foundation, Tiffany Foundation, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and others.

At the national and regional level, IUCN also works with Marriott International in Thailand, the Zambezi Valley Development Agency (ADPP) in Mozambique, Minh Phu – the largest shrimp exporter in Vietnam, Xingzhitianxia Media Company in China, the Secretariat of the Southern Agriculture Corridor of Tanzania (SAGCOT), Tata Steel in India, Engro Elengy Terminal (Pvt) Ltd in Pakistan, to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2017-001-v.1-En.pdf|title=IUCN 2016 Annual Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National and international policy ===
On the national level, IUCN helps governments prepare national biodiversity policies. Internationally, IUCN provides advice to environmental conventions such as the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], [[CITES]] and the [[Framework Convention on Climate Change]]. It advises [[UNESCO]] on natural [[world heritage site|world heritage]].&lt;br /&gt;
It has a formally accredited permanent observer mission to the [[United Nations]] in New York. According to its own website, IUCN is the only international observer organization in the UN General Assembly with expertise in issues concerning the environment, specifically biodiversity, nature conservation and sustainable natural resource use.&lt;ref name="IUCN Programme" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
IUCN has official relations with the [[Council of Europe]], the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO), the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO),  the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD), the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), the [[UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre]] (UNEP-WCMC), the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO), the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) and the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO NGO database|url=http://ngo-db.unesco.org/r/or/en/1100033055|website=UNESCO|accessdate=4 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208140552/http://ngo-db.unesco.org/r/or/en/1100033055|archivedate=8 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational structure==
As an organization, IUCN has three components: the member organizations, the six scientific commissions, and the secretariat.

===Members===
IUCN Members are states (making IUCN a supranational [[GONGO]]), government agencies, international nongovernmental organizations, national nongovernmental organizations, and indigenous peoples’ organisations. In 2017, IUCN had 1400 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iucn.org/news/secretariat/201706/iucn-welcomes-13-new-members|title=IUCN welcomes 13 new Members|date=2017-06-06|work=IUCN|access-date=2017-07-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members can organize themselves in national or regional committees to promote cooperation. In 2016, there were 62 national committees and 7 regional committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2017-001-v.1-En.pdf|title=IUCN 2016 Annual Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:USSR 1978.jpg|thumb|[[Soviet]] Stamp commemorating the 1978 IUCN General Assembly in [[Ashgabat]]]]

===Commissions===
The six IUCN Commissions involve 16,000 volunteer experts from a range of disciplines. They 'assess the state of the world’s natural resources and provide the Union with sound know-how and policy advice on conservation issues'.&lt;ref name="IUCNCommissions"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iucn.org/about/union/commissions/ | title = IUCN – Commissions |date=12 May 2010 |publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature |accessdate=8 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Commission on Education and Communication (CEC): communication, learning and knowledge management in IUCN and the wider conservation community. Members: over 1300
* Commission on Environmental, Economic, and Social Policy (CEESP): economic and social factors for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. Members: 1465.
* World Commission on Environmental Law (WCEL): developing new legal concepts and instruments, and building the capacity of societies to employ environmental law for conservation and sustainable development. Members: 800.
* Commission on Ecosystem Management (CEM): integrated ecosystem approaches to the management of natural and modified ecosystems. Members: 1000.
* Species Survival Commission (SSC): technical aspects of species conservation and action for species that are threatened with [[extinction]]. Members: 7500.
* World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA):  establishment and effective management of a network of terrestrial and marine protected areas. Members: 1300. {{Main article|World Commission on Protected Areas}}

===Secretariat===
The Secretariat is led by the Director General. For management of its operations IUCN distinguishes eight geographical regions; each is led by a director who reports to the Director General.&lt;br /&gt;
The IUCN head office is in [[Gland]], Switzerland. Eight regional offices implement IUCN’s program in their respective territories. Since 1980, IUCN has established offices in more than 50 countries. The total number of staff grew from 100 (1980) to around 1,000 (2014);  nearly all this growth was in the national and regional offices. Approximately 150 staff are based in the head office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About IUCN|url=http://www.iucn.org/about/union/secretariat/|website=IUCN|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance and funding==

===Governance===
[[File:Inger2 (5243802649).jpg|thumb|[[Inger Andersen (environmentalist)|Inger Andersen]], IUCN Director General since January 2015]]The '''World Conservation Congress''' (Members’ Assembly) is IUCN’s highest decision-making body. The Congress convenes every four years, most recently in [[Hawaii]] (2016) and previously in Jeju, South Korea (2012). It elects the Council, including the President, and approves IUCN’s workprogram for the next four years, and budget.

The IUCN '''Council''' is the principal governing body of IUCN. The Council provides strategic direction for the activities of the Union, discusses specific policy issues and provides guidance on finance and the membership development of the Union. The Council is composed of the President, four Vice Presidents (elected by the Council from among its members), the Treasurer, the Chairs of IUCN's six Commissions, three Regional Councillors from each of IUCN's eight Statutory Regions and a Councillor from the State in which IUCN has its seat (Switzerland).  IUCN's current President is [[Zhang Xinsheng]].

The Council appoints a '''Director General''', who is responsible for the overall management of IUCN and the running of the Secretariat. [[Inger Andersen (environmentalist)|Inger Andersen]] is IUCN Director General since January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inger Andersen named IUCN Director General|url=http://www.iucn.org/?18465/Inger-Andersen-named-IUCN-Director-General|website=IUCN|accessdate=3 December 2014|date=2014-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; She succeeded [[Julia Marton-Lefèvre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Union|url=http://iucn.org/about/union/|website=IUCN|accessdate=3 December 2014|date=2014-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
IUCN’s total income in 2013 was 114 million CHF, equaling approximately 95 million Euro or 116 million US dollar.&lt;br /&gt;
IUCN’s funding mainly comes from Official Development Assistance budgets of bilateral and multilateral agencies. This represented 61% of its income in 2013. Additional sources of income are the membership fees, as well as grants and project funding from foundations, institutions and corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IUCN Annual Report 2013|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/IUCN-2014-017.pdf|publisher=IUCN|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence and criticism==

===Influence===
IUCN is considered one of the most influential conservation organisations in the world and, together with WWF and the [[World Resources Institute]] (WRI), is seen as a driving force behind the rise of the influence of environmental organisations at the UN and around the world.&lt;ref name="Understanding NGOs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="What is IUCN"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is IUCN?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-iucn.htm|website=WiseGeek|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It has established a network covering all aspects of global conservation via its worldwide membership of governmental and non-governmental organisations, the participation of experts in the IUCN Commissions, formal involvement in international agreements, ties to intergovernmental organisations and increasingly partnerships with international business. The World Conservation Congress and the World Parks Congress events organised by IUCN are the largest gatherings of organisations and individuals involved in conservation worldwide.  They involve governmental organisations, NGOs, media, academia and the corporate sector. &lt;br /&gt;
According to some, IUCN is not only a major global player in conservation action, but also has considerable influence in defining what nature conservation actually is.&lt;ref name="IUCN: A History of Constraint"&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=Kenneth|title=IUCN: A History of Constraint|publisher=UCLouvain|url=http://perso.uclouvain.be/marc.maesschalck/MacDonaldInstitutional_Reflexivity_and_IUCN-17.02.03.pdf|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] and the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems determine which species and natural areas merit protection. Through the Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas and the system of [[IUCN protected area categories]] IUCN influences how protected areas are managed.

===Criticism===
The relevance of the scientific insights and the data that IUCN produces are not often drawn into question, but IUCN has encountered criticism in other matters.

It has been claimed that IUCN put the needs of nature above those of humans, disregarding economic considerations and the interests of indigenous peoples and other traditional users of the land. Until the 1980s IUCN favored the "Yellowstone Model’ of conservation which called for the removal of humans from protected areas. The expulsion of the [[Maasai people]] from [[Serengeti National Park]] and the [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]] is perhaps the best known example of this approach.&lt;ref name="wrm.org.uy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="holdgate"/&gt;[[File:Ngorongoro 2012 05 30 2353 (7500935618).jpg|thumb|IUCN's relationships with local land users like the Maasai have caused controversy in the past]]
This is linked to another criticism that has been directed at IUCN, namely that throughout its history it has mainly been ‘Northern focused’, i.e. had a West-European or North-American perspective on global conservation.  Some critics point to the fact that many individuals involved in the establishment of IUCN had been leading figures in the British Society for the Preservation of the Wild Fauna of Empire, which wanted to protect species against the impact of ‘native’ hunting pressure in order to safeguard hunting by Europeans.&lt;ref name="IUCN: A History of Constraint"/&gt; The fact that at least until the 1990s,  most of IUCN staff, the chairs of the Commissions and the IUCN President came from western countries has also led to criticism.&lt;ref name="holdgate" /&gt; Over the past decade, IUCN has changed its approach. It now aims to work in close cooperation with indigenous groups. It has also become more regionalized in its operations and more truly global in its staffing.&lt;ref name="holdgate" /&gt; At the 2016 World Conservation Congress, IUCN introduced a new membership category for indigenous peoples’ organisations in recognition of their role in conserving the planet.

More recently, activist environmental groups have argued that IUCN is too closely associated with governmental organisations and with the commercial sector.&lt;ref name="What is IUCN"/&gt;  IUCN’s cooperation with [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] came in for criticism, also from its own membership.&lt;ref name="worldwatch.org"/&gt; IUCN's close partnership with [[Coca-Cola|Coca Cola]] in Vietnam – where they have together been launching Coca-Cola-focused community centers – has also drawn some criticism and allegations of [[greenwashing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iucn.org/ur/node/26042|title=What's an EKOCENTER and what does it do?|date=2016-04-04|work=IUCN|access-date=2017-06-20|language=ur}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/dec/04/coca-cola-coke-water-neutral|title=Greenwash: Are Coke's green claims the real thing?|date=2008-12-04|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-06-20|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theecologist.org/blogs_and_comments/commentators/2985093/never_mind_the_greenwash_coca_cola_can_never_be_water_neutral.html|title=Never mind the greenwash – Coca Cola can never be 'water neutral'|work=The Ecologist|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its decision to hold the 2012 World Conservation Congress on [[Jeju Island]], South Korea, where the local community and international environmental activists were protesting against the construction of a navy base also led to controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jeju island navy base controversy divides iucn|url=http://biodiversitymedia.ning.com/profiles/blogs/jeju-island-navy-base-controversy-divides-iucn|website=Biodiversity media alliance|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IUCN remains committed to its partnerships with the business sector, seeing sustainable development as the way to ensure long-term protection of natural areas and species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Natural capital must be the way forward, says IUCN director general|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/natural-capital-way-forward-iucn|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=21 January 2015|date=2013-11-11|last1=Smedley|first1=Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IUCN has a wide range of publications, reports, guidelines and databases related to conservation and [[sustainable development]]. It publishes or co-authors more than 100 books and major assessments every year, along with hundreds of reports, documents and guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iucn.org/resources/publications|title=Publications|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=IUCN|accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, 76 IUCN articles were published in peer reviewed scientific journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2016-020.pdf|title=IUCN Annual Report 2015|last=|first=|publisher=IUCN|year=|isbn=|location=https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2016-020.pdf|pages=Page 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report, released at the IUCN World Parks Congress in Sydney on 13 November 2014 showed that the 209,000 conservation reserves around the world now cover 15.4 per cent of the total land area. The new figures are a step in the right direction of protecting 17 percent of land and 10 percent of ocean environments on Earth by 2020 since an agreement between the world's nations at the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], held in Japan in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Big increase in Earth’s protected areas|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2014/11/big-increase-in-earth%E2%80%99s-protected-areas|accessdate=17 November 2014|website=Australian Geographic|date=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its World Conservation Congress in Hawaii in 2016, the IUCN launched a report ''Explaining ocean warming: causes, scale, effects and consequences'', one of the most comprehensive reviews to date on ocean warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46254 |title=Explaining ocean warming |last1=Baxter |first1=J.M. |last2=Laffoley |first2= Daniel D'A|date= September 5, 2016|website= |publisher=IUCN |accessdate= September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This four-[[kanji|character]] compound (or [[yojijukugo]]) literally translates as "what the mind thinks, the heart transmits".  Sometimes translated into English as "[[telepathy]]" or "[[sympathy]]", ''ishin-denshin'' is also commonly rendered as "[[Heart (symbolism)|heart]]-to-heart communication" or "[[Tacit knowledge|tacit understanding]]".&lt;ref name="Cheung1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cheung|first=King-Kok|title=Articulate Silences: Hisaye Yamamoto, Maxine Hong Kingston, Joy Kogawa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0DrUokTlmgC&amp;pg=PA146|accessdate=29 July 2012|year=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8147-5|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although silent understanding is generally recognized as a universal human phenomenon, the term ''ishin-denshin'' is often used to convey a style of [[nonverbal communication]] between two people that is felt by some Japanese to be characteristic of [[Japanese culture]].&lt;ref name="DaviesIkeno2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davies|first1=Roger J. |last2=Ikeno|first2=Osamu|title=The Japanese Mind: Understanding Contemporary Japanese Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TW7lHYwXhS4C&amp;pg=PA105|accessdate=July 28, 2012|date=March 15, 2002|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=978-0-8048-3295-3|pages=52–54, 105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Takeo Doi]],The Anatomy of Self,1985,page138(...telepathic,pre-linguistic,...)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John W.Dower,War without Mercy,1986,page107(...nondiscursive communication...)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karel van Wolferen,The Enigma of Japanese Power,1989,page327(...supra-conversational...)&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the Japanese concept of ''[[haragei]]'' denotes a deliberate form of nonverbal communication, ''ishin-denshin'' refers to a passive form of shared understanding.  ''Ishin-denshin'' is traditionally perceived by the Japanese as sincere, silent communication via the heart or belly (i.e. symbolically from the inside, ''[[Uchi-soto|uchi]]''), as distinct from overt communication via the face and mouth (the outside, ''soto''), which is seen as being more susceptible to insincerities.&lt;ref name="DaviesIkeno2002"/&gt; The introduction of this concept to Japan (via China) is related to the traditions of [[Zen Buddhism]], where the term ''ishin-denshin'' refers to direct [[Dharma transmission|mind transmission]].&lt;ref name="DaviesIkeno2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baroni2002"&gt;{{cite book|last= Baroni|first=Helen Josephine |title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=smNM4ElP3XgC&amp;pg=PA156|accessdate=July 28, 2012|year=2002|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-2240-6|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zen Buddhism]] tradition, in turn, draws the concept of ''ishin-denshin'' from the first [[Dharma transmission]] between [[Gautama Buddha]] and [[Mahākāśyapa]] in the [[Flower Sermon]].&lt;ref name="Shores1998"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://terebess.hu/zen/mesterek/JeffShore.pdf |title=THE SOURCE OF ZEN: WHO TRANSMITS WHAT? |last1=Shore |first1=Jeff |date=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Durix1991"&gt;{{cite book |last=Durix |first=Claude |date=1991 |title=Cent Clés pour Comprendre le Zen |publisher=Le Courrier du Livre |page=43 |isbn=2-7029-0261-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alif Laam Meem Muslim Fraternity At Domestic Violence Rally.JPG|thumb|On March 23, 2013, members of [[Alpha Lambda Mu|Alif Laam Meem]], a national Muslim fraternity based at the University of Texas at Dallas, stood up against domestic violence as Muslims and as men of Dallas.]]
The relationship between '''Islam and domestic violence''' is disputed. Even among Muslims, the uses and interpretations of [[sharia]], the moral code and religious law of Islam, lack [[consensus]].

Conservative {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} interpretations of [[Surah]] [[An-Nisa, 34]] in the [[Qur'an]] regarding marital relationships find that hitting a woman is allowed.  Other interpretations of the verse claim it does not support hitting a woman, but separating from her. Variations in interpretation are due to different schools of Islamic [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]], histories and politics of religious institutions, conversions, [[reforms]], and education.&lt;ref name=Hajjar&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hajjar | first1 = Lisa | year = 2004 | title = Religion, State Power, and Domestic Violence in Muslim Societies: A Framework for Comparative Analysis | url = | journal = Law and Social Inquiry | volume = 29 | issue = 1| pages = 1–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic violence among the Muslim community is considered a complicated [[human rights]] issue due to varying legal remedies for women by the nations in which they live, the extent to which they have support or opportunities to divorce their husbands, cultural stigma to hide evidence of abuse, and inability to have abuse recognized by police or the judicial system in some Muslim nations.

== Definition ==
{{further|Domestic violence}}

According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary definition, domestic violence is: "the inflicting of physical injury by one family or household member on another; also: a repeated or habitual pattern of such behavior."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/domestic%20violence ''Domestic Violence.''] Merriam Webster. Retrieved 14 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coomaraswamy defines domestic violence as "violence that occurs within the private sphere, generally between individuals who are related through intimacy, blood or law…[It is] nearly always a gender-specific crime, perpetrated by men against women." It used is as a strong form of control and oppression.&lt;ref name=Coomaraswamy&gt;Coomaraswamy, Radhika. [http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/commission/thematic52/53-wom.htm Further Promotion and Encouragement of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.] United Nations. Economic and Social Council. 5 Feb. 1996. Retrieved 19 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kofi Annan]], former [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], declared in a 2006 report posted on the [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]] (UNIFEM) website that:&lt;blockquote&gt;Violence against women and girls is a problem of [[pandemic]] proportions. At least one out of every three women around the world has been beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise abused in her lifetime with the abuser usually someone known to her.&lt;ref name=Moradian&gt;Moradian, Azad.

[[Surah]] [[An-Nisa, 34]]-35 passage on the [[social interaction]] between husbands and wives defines the husband and wife relationship in [[Islam]], with interpretation subject to debate among Muslim scholars (or 'jurists'). Quran 4:34 reads,
{{quote|
Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has given the one more (strength) than the other, and because they support them from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient, and guard in (the husband's) absence what Allah would have them guard. As to those women on whose part ye fear disloyalty and ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (Next), refuse to share their beds, (And last) strike them (lightly); but if they return to obedience, seek not against them Means (of annoyance): For Allah is Most High, great (above you all). If ye fear a breach between them twain, appoint (two) arbiters, one from his family, and the other from hers; if they wish for peace, Allah will cause their reconciliation: For Allah hath full knowledge, and is acquainted with all things|{{cite quran|4|34-35|t=y|s=ns}} }}

Various translations of the above passage read 'strike them' or 'beat them' or 'scourge them', depending on the translator.

=== In Hadith ===

{{quotation|Narrated 'Ikrima: Rifa'a divorced his wife whereupon 'AbdurRahman bin Az-Zubair Al-Qurazi married her. 'Aisha said that the lady (came), wearing a green veil. It was the habit of ladies to support each other, so when Allah's Apostle came, 'Aisha said, "I have not seen any woman suffering as much as the believing women. Look! Her skin is greener than her clothes!" When 'AbdurRahman heard that his wife had gone to the Prophet, he came with his two sons from another wife. She said, "By Allah! I have done no wrong to him but he is impotent and is as useless to me as this," holding and showing the fringe of her garment, 'Abdur-Rahman said, "By Allah, O Allah's Apostle! She has told a lie! I am very strong and can satisfy her but she is disobedient and wants to go back to Rifa'a." Allah's Apostle said, to her, "If that is your intention, then know that it is unlawful for you to remarry Rifa'a unless Abdur-Rahman has had sexual intercourse with you." Then the Prophet saw two boys with 'Abdur-Rahman and asked (him), "Are these your sons?" On that 'AbdurRahman said, "Yes." The Prophet said, "You claim what you claim (i.e.. that he is impotent)? But by Allah, these boys resemble him as a crow resembles a crow,"|{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|7|72|715}} see also {{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|4|2127}}}}

{{quotation|Narrated 'Abdullah bin Sam'a The Prophet said, "None of you should flog his wife as he flogs a slave and then have sexual intercourse with her in the last part of the day."|{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|7|62|132}} see also {{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|8|73|68}} }}

{{quote|It was narrated that Sulayman bin Amr bin Ahwas said: “My father told me that he was present at the Farewell Pilgrimage with the Messenger of God. He praised and glorified God, and reminded and exhorted (the people). Then he said: 'I enjoin good treatment of women, for they are helpers of you, and you have no right to treat them otherwise, unless they commit lewdness. If they do that, then forsake them in their beds and hit them, but without causing injury or leaving a mark. If they obey you, then do not seek means of annoyance against them. You have rights over your women and your women have rights over you. Your rights over your women are that they are not to allow anyone whom you dislike to tread on your bedding, nor allow anyone whom you dislike to enter your houses. And their right over you are that you should treat them kindly with regard to their clothing and food.' ” (sunan ibn Majah vol. 3 book. 9 Hadith 1851) &lt;ref&gt; (sunao ibn Majah vol.3 book 9 Hadith 1851) &lt;/ref&gt;}}

The above Hadith ({{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Abudawud|11|2142}} and {{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Abudawud|11|2141}})is [[da'if]] (weak) according to [[Al-Albani]](1914-1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/abudawud/12/102|title=Hadith - Book of Marriage (Kitab Al-Nikah) - Sunan Abi Dawud - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|website=sunnah.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interpretations that support domestic violence ===
Hajjar LisA&lt;ref&gt;Hajjar, Lisa. "Religion, state power, and domestic violence in Muslim societies: A framework for comparative analysis." Law &amp; Social Inquiry 29.1 (2004); see pages 1-38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Treacher, Amal. "Reading the Other Women, Feminism, and Islam." Studies in Gender and Sexuality 4.1 (2003); pages 59-71&lt;/ref&gt;{{year needed|date=February 2018}} claims Shari'a law encourages "domestic violence" against women, when a husband suspects ''[[nushuz]]'' (disobedience, disloyalty, rebellion, ill conduct) in his wife.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Raines &amp; Daniel C. Maguire (Ed), Farid Esack,  What Men Owe to Women: Men's Voices from World Religions, State University of New York (2001), see pages 201-203&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars claim wife beating, for ''nashizah'', is not consistent with modern perspectives of Qur'an.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Nicky Ali, ed. Encyclopedia of domestic violence. CRC Press, 2007. (see chapter on Qur'anic perspectives on wife abuse)&lt;/ref&gt; Some conservative translations find that Muslim husbands are permitted to act what is known in [[Arabic]] as Idribuhunna with the use of "light force," and sometimes as much as to strike, hit, chastise, or beat.&lt;ref name=Ahmed&gt;Ahmed, Ali S. V.; Jibouri, Yasin T. (2004). ''The Koran: Translation.'' Elmhurst, NY: Tahrike Tarsile Qurʼān. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[Tafsir|exegesis]] such as those of [[Ibn Kathir]](1300-1373AD) and [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]](839-923AD), the actions prescribed in Surah 4:34 above, are to be taken in sequence: the husband is to admonish the wife, after which (if his previous correction was unsuccessful) he may remain separate from her, after which (if his previous correction was still unsuccessful) he may hit her&lt;ref name=Makarem&gt;[http://www.al-ijtihaad.com/ulema-e-islam/ulema_10.html ''Grand Ayatullah Nasir Makarem Shirazi: Fatwas and viewpoints.''] Al-Ijtihaad Foundation.

{{refn|[[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]] in his Quranic commentary states that: "In case of family jars four steps are mentioned, to be taken in that order. (1) Perhaps verbal advice or admonition may be sufficient; (2) if not, sex relations may be suspended; (3) if this is not sufficient, some slight physical correction may be administered; but Imam Shafi'i considers this inadvisable, though permissible, and all authorities are unanimous in deprecating any sort of cruelty, even of the nagging kind, as mentioned in the next clause; (4) if all this fails, a family council is recommended in passage 4:35."&lt;ref name=Ali&gt;[[Abdullah Yusuf Ali|Ali, Abdullah Yusuf]], (1989) ''The Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation and Commentary.'' Brentwood, MD: Amana Corporation. {{ISBN|0-915957-03-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}}{{refn|Sheikh [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]], head of the [[European Council for Fatwa and Research]], says that "If the husband senses that feelings of disobedience and rebelliousness are rising against him in his wife, he should try his best to rectify her attitude by kind words, gentle persuasion, and reasoning with her. If this is not helpful, he should sleep apart from her, trying to awaken her agreeable feminine nature so that serenity may be restored, and she may respond to him in a harmonious fashion. If this approach fails, it is permissible for him to beat her lightly with his hands, avoiding her face and other sensitive parts."&lt;ref name=Yusuf&gt;{{cite book |author=Yusuf al-Qaradawi |title=The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iXCNAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA227source%3Dbl&amp;ots=U5EOq-_JBX&amp;pg=PA227#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=227 |location=Kuala Lumpur |publisher=Islamic Book Trust |year=2013 |isbn=978-967-0526-00-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} or give her a light tapping.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Kathir]], "Tafsir of Ibn Kathir", Al-Firdous Ltd., London, 2000, 50-53&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Egyptian scholar Abd al-Halim Abu Shaqqa refers to the opinions of jurists [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]](1372-1449AD) and [[Shawkani|al-Shawkani]](1759-1839AD) who state that hitting should only occur in extraordinary cases.&lt;ref name="Roald 2001 p. 169"&gt;Roald (2001) p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

A translated passage by [[Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali|Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali]] and [[Muhammad Muhsin Khan|Muhsin Khan]] in 2007 defines men as the protectors, guardians and maintainers of women, because [[Allah]] has made the one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means.  Upon seeing ill-conduct (i.e. [[disobedience]], [[rebellion]], nashuz in Arabic) by his wife, a man may [[admonish]] them (first), (next), refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly, if it is useful), but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means.&lt;ref&gt;Khan, Muhammad Muhsin; Hilālī, Taqī Al-Dīn.

Some Islamic scholars and commentators have emphasized that hitting, even where permitted, are not to be harsh&lt;ref name=Makarem/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Classic Manual of Islamic Sacred Law, Al-Nawawi, section m10.12, "Dealing with a Rebellious Wife", page 540; may hit her as long as it doesn't draw blood, leave a bruise, or break bones.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Ibn Kathir Ad-Damishqee records in his Tafsir Al-Qur'an Al-Azim that "Ibn `Abbas and several others said that the Ayah refers to a beating that is not violent.

=== Interpretation that does not support hitting ===
Indicating the subjective nature of the translations, particularly regarding domestic abuse, [[Ahmad Ali|Ahmed Ali]]'s English translation of the word ''idribu'' is "to forsake, avoid, or leave."{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}  His English translation of verse 4:34 is:
…As for women you feel are averse, talk to them cursively; then leave them alone in bed (without molesting them), and go to bed with them (when they are willing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-4/verse-34/|title=Quran Surah An-Nisaa ( Verse 34 ) with English Translation الرِّجَالُ قَوَّامُونَ عَلَى النِّسَاءِ بِمَا فَضَّلَ اللَّهُ بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ وَبِمَا أَنْفَقُوا مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ ۚ فَالصَّالِحَاتُ قَانِتَاتٌ حَافِظَاتٌ لِلْغَيْبِ بِمَا حَفِظَ اللَّهُ ۚ وَاللَّاتِي تَخَافُونَ نُشُوزَهُنَّ فَعِظُوهُنَّ وَاهْجُرُوهُنَّ فِي الْمَضَاجِعِ وَاضْرِبُوهُنَّ ۖ فَإِنْ أَطَعْنَكُمْ فَلَا تَبْغُوا عَلَيْهِنَّ سَبِيلًا ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيًّا كَبِيرًا|website=IReBD.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in his native Urdu translation of verse 4:34, he translates ''idribuhunna'' as "beat them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ali|first1=Ahmed|title=34 القرآن, النساء|url=http://tanzil.net/#trans/ur.ahmedali/4:34|website=Tanzil.net|page=84|language=Urdu|quote=مرد عورتوں پر حاکم ہیں اس واسطے کہ الله نے ایک کو ایک پر فضیلت دی ہے اور اس واسطے کہ انہوں نے اپنے مال خرچ کیے ہیں پھر جو عورتیں نیک ہیں وہ تابعدار ہیں مردوں کے پیٹھ پیچھے الله کی نگرانی میں (ان کے حقوق کی) حفاظت کرتی ہیں اور جن عورتو ں سےتمہیں سرکشی کا خطرہ ہو تو انہیں سمجھاؤ اور سونے میں جدا کر دو اور مارو پھر اگر تمہارا کہا مان جائیں تو ان پر الزام لگانے کے لیے بہانے مت تلاش کرو بے شک الله سب سے اوپر بڑا ہے (34)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Laleh Bakhtiar found out by reading Edward William Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon, a 3,064-page volume from the 19th century, among the six pages of definitions for ''daraba'' one definition was "to go away."&lt;ref name=Bakhtiar&gt;Bakhtiar, Laleh.

the same root word (''daraba'') as ''idribuhunna'' in 4:34.&lt;ref name=4:94&gt;Unknown author.
[http://www.islamawareness.net/Wife/beating1.html ''Systematic comparison with 4:94''] Islamawareness.net&lt;/ref&gt; This translation is negated however by the fact that most definitions of ''daraba'' in Edward William Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon are related to physical beating&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=William Lane |first1=Edward |title=Arabic-English Lexicon by Edward William Lane  (London: Willams &amp; Norgate 1863) |url=http://www.tyndalearchive.com/TABS/Lane/ |pages=1777–1783 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408021742/http://www.tyndalearchive.com/tabs/lane/ |archivedate=2015-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that when the root word ''daraba'' and its derivatives are used in the Qur'an in relation to humans or their body parts, it exclusively means physically beating or striking them (e.g. in [http://quran.com/2/73 Qur'an 2:73][http://quran.com/37/93 37:93], [http://quran.com/8/12 8:12], [http://quran.com/8/50 8:50], [http://quran.com/47/4 47:4] and [http://quran.com/47/27 47:27]).

Scholars and commentators have stated that Muhammad directed men not to hit their wives' faces,&lt;ref name="mau"&gt;"Towards Understanding the Qur'an" Translation by Zafar I.

[[Sunan Ibn Maja]] 1841.|group=nb}} and not to beat their wives as to cause pain (''ghayr mubarrih'').&lt;ref name="asad"&gt;[[Muhammad Asad]], ''The Message of the Qur'an'' (his translation of the Qur'an).&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars too have stipulated against beating or disfigurement, with others such as the Syrian jurist [[Ibn Abidin]] prescribing ''[[Tazir|ta'zir]]'' punishments against abusive husbands.&lt;ref name=eowaic&gt;Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic cultures, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;
In a certain hadidth, Muhammad discouraged beating one's wife severely:

Bahz bin Hakim reported on the authority of his father from his grandfather (Mu'awiyah ibn Haydah) as saying:
"I said: Messenger of Allah, how should we approach our wives and how should we leave them? He replied: Approach your [http://quran.com/2/223 tilth] when or how you will, give her (your wife) food when you take food, clothe when you clothe yourself, do not revile her face, and do not beat her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunan Abi Dawud, Book 11, Hadith 2138|url=http://sunnah.com/abudawud/12/98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newageislam.com/islam,-women-and-feminism/does-islam-allow-wife-beating?/d/7244|title=Does Islam Allow Wife-Beating?, Islam, Women and Feminism, Aiman Reyaz, New Age Islam, New Age Islam|work=newageislam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same hadith has been narrated with slightly different wording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunan Abi Dawud, Book 11, Hadith 2139|url=http://sunnah.com/abudawud/12/99|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other versions of this hadith, only beating the face is discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Al-Baghawi|authorlink1=Al-Baghawi|title=Mishkat Al-Masabih|volume=2|page=691}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunan Abi Dawud, Book 11, Hadith 2137|url=http://sunnah.com/abudawud/12/97|website=Sunnah.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some jurists argue that even when beating is acceptable under the Quran, it is still discouraged.{{refn|[[Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi]] comments that "Whenever the Prophet permitted a man to administer corporal punishment to his wife, he did so with reluctance, and continued to express his distaste for it. And even in cases where it is necessary, the Prophet directed men not to hit across the face, nor to beat severely nor to use anything that might leave marks on the body."

[[Muhammad Asad]], ''The Message of the Qur'an'' (his translation of the Qur'an).|group=nb}} Ibn Kathir in concluding his [[exegesis]] exhorts men to not beat their wives, quoting a hadith from Muhammad: "Do not hit God's servants" (here referring to women). The narration continues, stating that some while after the edict, "Umar complained to the Messenger of God that many women turned against their husbands. Muhammad gave his permission that the men could hit their wives in cases of rebelliousness. The women then turned to the wives of the Prophet and complained about their husbands. The Prophet said: 'Many women have turned to my family complaining about their husbands. Verily, these men are not among the best of you."&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Kathir 1981 vol I: 386, Sunan Abi Dawud, Book of Marriage #1834, ad-Darimi, Book of Marriage #2122; quoted in Roald (2001) p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan A.C. Brown]] throws light on the general trend when it comes to the verse:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The vast majority of the ulama across the Sunni schools of law inherited the Prophet's unease over domestic violence and placed further restrictions on the evident meaning of the 'Wife Beating Verse'. A leading Meccan scholar from the second generation of Muslims, [[Ata ibn Abi Rabah|Ata' bin Abi Rabah]], counseled a husband not to beat his wife even if she ignored him but rather to express his anger in some other way. [[Al-Darimi|Darimi]], a teacher of both [[Tirmidhi]] and [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj|Muslim bin Hajjaj]] as well as a leading early scholar in Iran, collected all the Hadiths showing Muhammad's disapproval of beating in a chapter entitled 'The Prohibition on Striking Women'. A thirteenth-century scholar from Granada, Ibn Faras, notes that one camp of ulama had staked out a stance forbidding striking a wife altogether, declaring it contrary to the Prophet's example and denying the authenticity of any Hadiths that seemed to permit beating. Even [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]], the pillar of late medieval Sunni Hadith scholarship, concludes that, contrary to what seems to be an explicit command in the Qur'an, the Hadiths of the Prophet leave no doubt that striking one's wife to discipline her actually falls under the Shariah ruling of 'strongly disliked' or 'disliked verging on prohibited'.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan A.C. Brown, ''Misquoting Muhammad: The Challenge and Choices of Interpreting the Prophet's Legacy'', [[Oneworld Publications]] (2014), pp. 275-276&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Iran the nature of domestic violence is complicated by both a national culture and authoritative state that support control, oppression and violence against women.&lt;ref name=Moradian/&gt;

A [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) study in [[Babol]] found that within the previous year 15.0% of wives had been physically abused, 42.4% had been sexually abused and 81.5% had been psychologically abused (to various degrees) by their husbands, blaming low income, young age, unemployment and low education.&lt;ref&gt;Faramarzi, M. et al.

In 2004 a study of domestic violence was undertaken by the Women's Center for Presidential Advisory,  [[Ministry of Science, Research and Technology (Iran)|Ministry of Higher Education]] and  [[Ministry of Interior (Iran)|The Interior Ministry]] of capital cities in Iran's 28 provinces. 66% married women in Iran are subjected to some kind of domestic violence in the first year of their marriage, either by their husbands or by their in-laws. All married women who were participants in this study in Iran have experienced 7.4% of the 9 categories of abuse. The likelihood of being subject to violence varied: The more children in a family or the more rural the family lived, the greater the likelihood of domestic violence; Educated and career women were less likely to be victims of abuse.  9.63% of women in the study reported wishing their husbands would die, as a result of the abuse they have experienced.&lt;ref name=Moradian/&gt;

The prevalence of domestic violence has been cited as a cause of high rates of suicide, mostly through [[self-immolation]], among [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] women in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Esfandiari, Golnaz.

|A 2009 study published by the Government of Turkey reports widespread domestic violence against women in Turkey. In urban and rural areas, 40% of Turkish women reported having experienced spousal violence in their lifetime, 10% of all women reported of domestic abuse within last 12 months. In the 15-24 year age group, 20% of the women reported of domestic violence by their husbands or male members of their family. The domestic violence ranged from slapping, battering and other forms of violence. The injuries, as a result of the reported domestic violence included bleeding, broken bones and other forms needing medical attention. Over half reported severe injuries. A third of all women who admitted domestic abuse cases, claimed having suffered repeat domestic abuse injuries in excess of 5 times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hips.hacettepe.edu.tr/eng/dokumanlar/2008-TDVAW_Main_Report.pdf Domestic violence against women in Turkey] Jansen, Uner, Kardam, et al.; Turkish Republic Prime Minister Directorate General Office (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws and prosecution==
According to Ahmad Shafaat, an Islamic scholar, "If the husband beats a wife without respecting the limits set down by the Qur'an and Hadith, then she can take him to court and if ruled in favor has the right to apply the law of retaliation and beat the husband as he beat her."&lt;ref name="shaf"/&gt; According to ''Honour, Violence, Women and Islam'', and Islamic scholar Dr. Muhammad Sharif Chaudhry, [[Muhammad]] condemns violence against women, as he says: "How loathsome (Ajeeb) it is that one of you should hit his wife as a slave is hit, and then sleep with her at the end of the day."&lt;ref name=Idriss/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhry, Muhammad Sharif. Prophet Muhammad: as Described in the Holy Scriptures. Lahore: S.N. Foundation, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However, laws against domestic violence, as well as whether these laws are enforced, vary throughout the Muslim world.

Some women want to fight the abuses they face as Muslims; these women want "to retain the communal extended family aspects of traditional society, while eliminating its worst abuses, by seeking easy ability to divorce men for abuse and forced marriages."&lt;ref name=Ask47&gt;Ask, Karin; Marit Tjomsland.

| Existing laws (Iranian Code of Criminal Procedure articles 42, 43, 66) intend to prohibit violence in the form of kidnapping, gender-based harassment, abuse of pregnant women and "crimes against rights and responsibilities within the family structure," but due to cultural and political culture do not protect women, prosecute their abusers and provide services to victims.&lt;ref name=Moradian/&gt;&lt;ref name=JIRI&gt;[http://en.humanrights-iran.ir/news-18220.aspx ''Iran enforces laws on prevention of violence against women: Iranian MP''] Judiciary of the Islamic Republic of Iran, High Council For Human Rights. 16 Sep. 2011.

Laws to better enforce existing laws and protect women against violence were placed before the [[Islamic Consultative Assembly|Iranian parliament]] the week ending 16 September 2011, focusing on both protection and prevention of violence against women, including focus on human trafficking, better protection and services for abuse victims, rehabilitation (especially concerning domestic abuse) and better processes to manage questioning of female offenders.

| In 1993 as a response to the women's rights activism against aspects of [[Morocco|Moroccan]] family law that are discriminatory or otherwise harmful to women, King Hassan II had instituted some modest reforms of the Mudawwana, and in 1998, he authorized Prime Minister El-Yousoufi to propose further changes. When the King Hassan died in 1999, the throne passed to his son, Muhammad VI, who committed to bolder reforms to improve the status of women.&lt;ref name=Euben/&gt; Opponents of the plan argued that this reform conflicted with women's duties to their husbands and contravene  their sharia-based status as legal minors. However, the controversy marked by the huge competing demonstrations intimidated the government, which led to the withdrawal of the plan.

In Malaysia, the largest government-run hospital implemented a program to intervene in cases where domestic violence seems possible.

If the woman does not wish to go to the shelter, she is encouraged to see a social worker and file a police report.  If the injury is very serious, investigations begin immediately.&lt;ref name=UN92&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.aspsymbol=A/61/122/Add.1 ''In-depth study on all forms of violence against women.''] United Nations, General Assembly.  6 July 2006.

== Divorce ==
{{See also|Divorce (Islamic)}}

Though some Muslim scholars, such as Ahmad Shafaat, contend that Islam permits women to be divorced in cases of domestic violence.&lt;ref name="shaf"/&gt; divorce may be unavailable to women as a practical or legal matter.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Gavin. "Marriage and Divorce in Islamic South East Asia."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran states:
(2:231) And when you have divorced women and they have fulfilled the term of their prescribed period, either take them back on reasonable basis or set them free on reasonable basis. But do not take them back to hurt them, and whoever does that, then he has wronged himself. And treat not the Verses of Allah as a jest, but remember [[Islam|Allah's Favours]] on you, and that which He has sent down to you of the [[Quran|Book]] and Al-Hikmah [the Prophet's Sunnah, legal ways, Islamic jurisprudence] whereby He instructs you. And fear Allah, and know that Allah is All-Aware of everything.&lt;ref&gt;Muḥammad, Farida Khanam; Ḫān, Wahīd-ad-Dīn. (2009). The Quran. New Delhi: Goodword. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Islam permits women to divorce for domestic violence, they are subject to the laws of their nation which might make it quite difficult for a woman to obtain a divorce.&lt;ref name=Coomaraswamy/&gt;

Most [[women's rights activists]] concede that while divorce can provide potential relief, it does not constitute an adequate protection or even an option for many women, with discouraging factors such as lack of resources or support to establish alternative domestic arrangements and social expectations and pressures.&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, Howard, and Astri Suhrke.

These are named after [[Jean-Robert Argand]] (1768–1822), although they were first described by Norwegian-Danish land surveyor and mathematician [[Caspar Wessel]] (1745–1818).&lt;ref&gt;Wessel's memoir was presented to the Danish Academy in 1797; Argand's paper was published in 1806.&lt;br/&gt;({{cite book |first1=Edmund Taylor |last1=Whittaker |first2=G.N. |last2=Watson |title=A Course of Modern Analysis: An Introduction to the General Theory of Infinite Processes and of Analytic Functions, with an Account of the Principal Transcendental Functions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ULVdGZmi9VcC&amp;pg=PA9 |year=1927 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-58807-2 |page=9}})&lt;/ref&gt; Argand diagrams are frequently used to plot the positions of the [[pole (complex analysis)|poles]] and [[root of a function|zeroes]] of a [[mathematical function|function]] in the complex plane.

The concept of the complex plane allows a [[geometric]] interpretation of complex numbers. Under [[addition]], they add like [[vector (spatial)|vector]]s. The [[multiplication]] of two complex numbers can be expressed most easily in [[polar coordinates]] — the magnitude or ''modulus'' of the product is the product of the two [[absolute value]]s, or moduli, and the angle or ''argument'' of the product is the sum of the two angles, or arguments. In particular, multiplication by a complex number of modulus 1 acts as a rotation.

=== Butterfly diagram ===
In the context of [[fast Fourier transform]] algorithms, a [[Butterfly diagram|butterfly]] is a portion of the computation that combines the results of smaller [[discrete Fourier transform]]s (DFTs) into a larger DFT, or vice versa (breaking a larger DFT up into subtransforms). The name "butterfly" comes from the shape of the data-flow diagram in the radix-2 case, as described below. The same structure can also be found in the [[Viterbi algorithm]], used for finding the most likely sequence of hidden states.

The [[butterfly diagram]] show a data-flow diagram connecting the inputs ''x'' (left) to the outputs ''y'' that depend on them (right) for a "butterfly" step of a radix-2 [[Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm]]. This diagram resembles a [[butterfly]] as in the [[morpho|morpho butterfly]] shown for comparison), hence the name.

=== Commutative diagram ===
{{Main|Commutative diagram}}

In mathematics, and especially in [[category theory]], a commutative diagram is a diagram of [[Object (category theory)|objects]], also known as vertices, and [[morphism]]s, also known as arrows or edges, such that when selecting two objects any directed path through the diagram leads to the same result by composition.

Commutative diagrams play the role in category theory that equations play in algebra.

=== Hasse diagrams ===
A [[Hasse diagram]] is a simple picture of a finite [[partially ordered set]], forming a [[Graph drawing|drawing]] of the partial order's [[transitive reduction]]. Concretely, one represents each element of the set as a vertex on the page and draws a line segment or curve that goes upward from ''x'' to ''y'' precisely when ''x'' &lt; ''y'' and there is no ''z'' such that ''x'' &lt; ''z'' &lt; ''y''. In this case, we say y [[covering relation|covers]] x, or y is an immediate successor of x. In a Hasse diagram, it is required that the curves be drawn so that each meets exactly two vertices: its two endpoints. Any such diagram (given that the vertices are labeled) uniquely determines a partial order, and any partial order has a unique transitive reduction, but there are many possible placements of elements in the plane, resulting in different Hasse diagrams for a given order that may have widely varying appearances.

[[Image:TrefoilKnot 01.svg|right|thumb|120px|Knot diagram.]]

=== Knot diagrams ===
In [[Knot theory]] a useful way to visualise and manipulate knots is to project the knot onto a plane—;think of the knot casting a shadow on the wall. A small perturbation in the choice of projection will ensure that it is [[Injective function|one-to-one]] except at the double points, called ''crossings'', where the "shadow" of the knot crosses itself once transversely&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Dale |last=Rolfsen |title=Knots and links |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFLvAAAAMAAJ |year=1976 |publisher=Publish or Perish |isbn=978-0-914098-16-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At each crossing we must indicate which section is "over" and which is "under", so as to be able to recreate the original knot. This is often done by creating a break in the strand going underneath. If by following the diagram the knot alternately crosses itself "over" and "under", then the diagram represents a particularly well-studied class of knot, [[alternating knot]]s.

[[Image:Venn diagram cmyk.svg|thumb|120px|right|Venn diagram.]]

=== Venn diagram ===
A [[Venn diagram]] is a representation of mathematical sets: a mathematical diagram representing sets as circles, with their relationships to each other expressed through their overlapping positions, so that all possible relationships between the sets are shown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861733754/venn_diagram.html "Venn diagram"], Encarta World English Dictionary, North American Edition 2007. [https://www.webcitation.org/5kx5ZATal Archived] 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Venn diagram is constructed with a collection of simple closed curves drawn in the plane. The principle of these diagrams is that classes be represented by regions in such relation to one another that all the possible logical relations of these classes can be indicated in the same diagram. That is, the diagram initially leaves room for any possible relation of the classes, and the actual or given relation, can then be specified by indicating that some particular region is null or is notnull.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clarence Irving Lewis]] (1918). [https://archive.org/details/asurveyofsymboli00lewiuoft ''A Survey of Symbolic Logic'']. Republished in part by Dover in 1960. p.&amp;nbsp;157.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Voronoi centerlines skeleton.gif|left|thumb|120px|Voronoi centerlines.]]

=== Voronoi diagram ===
A [[Voronoi diagram]] is a special kind of decomposition of a [[metric space]] determined by distances to a specified discrete set of objects in the space, e.g., by a [[discrete set]] of points. This diagram is named after [[Georgy Voronoi]], also called a Voronoi [[tessellation]], a Voronoi decomposition, or a Dirichlet tessellation after [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]].

In the simplest case, we are given a set of points S in the plane, which are the Voronoi sites. Each site s has a Voronoi cell V(s) consisting of all points closer to s than to any other site. The segments of the Voronoi diagram are all the points in the plane that are equidistant to two sites. The Voronoi nodes are the points equidistant to three (or more) sites

[[Image:Wallpaper group diagram p4m square.svg|thumb|120px|right|Wallpaper group diagram.]]

=== Wallpaper group diagrams ===
A [[wallpaper group]] or ''plane symmetry group'' or ''plane crystallographic group'' is a mathematical classification of a two-dimensional repetitive pattern, based on the symmetries in the pattern. Such patterns occur frequently in architecture and decorative art. There are 17 possible distinct [[group (mathematics)|groups]].

Wallpaper groups are two-dimensional [[symmetry groups]], intermediate in complexity between the simpler [[frieze group]]s and the three-dimensional [[crystallographic group]]s, also called [[space group]]s. Wallpaper groups categorize patterns by their symmetries. Subtle differences may place similar patterns in different groups, while patterns which are very different in style, color, scale or orientation may belong to the same group.

=== Young diagram ===
A ''Young diagram'' or [[Young tableau]], also called [[Ferrers diagram]], is a finite collection of boxes, or cells, arranged in left-justified rows, with the row sizes weakly decreasing (each row has the same or shorter length than its predecessor). 
[[Image:Young diagram for 541 partition.svg|thumb|120px|left|Young diagram.]]
Listing the number of boxes in each row gives a [[partition (number theory)|partition]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; of a positive integer ''n'', the total number of boxes of the diagram. The Young diagram is said to be of shape &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, and it carries the same information as that partition. Listing the number of boxes in each column gives another partition, the '''conjugate''' or ''transpose'' partition of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;; one obtains a Young diagram of that shape by reflecting the original diagram along its main diagonal.

Young tableaux were introduced by [[Alfred Young]], a [[mathematician]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], in 1900. They were then applied to the study of symmetric group by [[Georg Frobenius]] in 1903. Their theory was further developed by many mathematicians.

'''Microsoft Visio''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɪ|z|.|i|.|oʊ}} {{respell|VIZ|ee-oh}}) (formerly '''Microsoft Office Visio''') is a diagramming and [[vector graphics]] application and is part of the [[Microsoft Office]] family. The product was first introduced in 1992, made by the [[Visio Corporation|Shapeware Corporation]]. It was acquired by [[Microsoft]] in 2000.

== Features ==
Microsoft made Visio 2013 for Windows available in two editions: Standard and Professional. The Standard and Professional editions share the same interface, but the Professional edition has additional templates for more advanced diagrams and layouts, as well as  capabilities intended to make it easy for users to connect their diagrams to data sources and to display their data graphically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://support.microsoft.com/kb/896660 | title = A comparison of Visio Standard and Visio Professional | publisher = Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/visio/FX101757911033.aspx | title = Visio 2007 Edition Comparison | publisher = Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Professional edition features three additional diagram types, as well as intelligent rules, validation, and subprocess (diagram breakdown).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/visio/visio-edition-comparison-FX101838162.aspx | title = Visio 2010 Edition Comparison | publisher = Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visio Professional is also offered as an additional component of an [[Office365]] subscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://products.office.com/en-us/Visio/microsoft-visio-2013-plans-and-pricing-compare-visio-options | title =  Compare Visio Versions | publisher = Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 September 2015, Visio 2016 was released alongside [[Microsoft Office 2016]]. A few new features have been added such as one-step connectivity with Excel data, information rights management (IRM) protection for Visio files, modernized shapes for office layout, detailed shapes for site plans, updated shapes for floor plans, modern shapes for home plans, IEEE compliant shapes for electrical diagrams, new range of starter diagrams, and new themes for the Visio interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-s-new-in-Visio-2016-798f4f39-2833-486b-9ae9-55162672102e?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US | title = What's new in Visio 2016 | publisher = Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Database model]]ing in Visio revolves around a Database Model Diagram (DMD).&lt;ref&gt;

All of the previous versions of Visio used VSD, the proprietary binary-file format. Visio 2010 added support for the VDX file format, which is a well-documented [[XML]] Schema-based ("DatadiagramML") format, but still uses VSD by default.

Visio 2013 drops support for writing VDX files in favor of the new VSDX and VSDM file formats,&lt;ref name="New in 2013" /&gt; and uses them by default. Created based on [[Open Packaging Conventions]] (OPC) standard (ISO 29500, Part 2), a VSDX or VSDM file consists of a group of XML files archived inside a [[Zip (file format)|Zip file]].&lt;ref name="New in 2013"&gt;{{cite web|title= What's new for Visio 2013 developers|url= http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff767103.aspx#vis15_WhatsNew_NewFF|work= [[MSDN]]|publisher= Microsoft|accessdate= 31 March 2013|at= New file format|date= 16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  VSDX and VSDM files differ only in that VSDM files may contain [[macro (computer science)|macros]].&lt;ref name="New in 2013" /&gt; Since these files are susceptible to [[macro virus]] infection, the program enforces strict security on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Check for macros that might contain viruses|url= http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/visio-help/check-for-macros-that-might-contain-viruses-HP085052564.aspx|work= Visio Help|publisher= Microsoft|accessdate= 6 April 2013|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6HcPJMHLd?url=http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/visio-help/check-for-macros-that-might-contain-viruses-HP085052564.aspx|archivedate= 24 June 2013|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While VSD files use [[Lempel–Ziv–Welch|LZW]]-like [[lossless compression]], VDX is not compressed. Hence, a VDX file typically takes up 3 to 5 times more storage.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} VSDX and VSDM files use the same compression as Zip files.

Visio also supports saving files in SVG files, other diagramming files and images. However, images cannot be opened.

== History ==
Visio began as a standalone product produced by Shapeware Corporation; version 1.0 shipped in 1992.  A pre-release, Version 0.92, was distributed free on a floppy disk along with a Microsoft Windows systems readiness evaluation utility. In 1995, Shapeware Corporation changed their name to [[Visio Corporation]] to take advantage of market recognition and related product equity.&lt;!-- ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.gateway.com/s/tutorials/Tu_845507.shtml|title=The History of Visio|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref --&gt;  Microsoft acquired Visio in 2000, re-branding it as a [[Microsoft Office]] application. Like [[Microsoft Project]], however, it has never been officially included in any of the bundled Office suites (although it was on the disk for Office 2003 and could be installed if users knew it was there {{cn|date=February 2018}}).  Microsoft included a [[Microsoft Visual Studio#Visual Studio .NET 2003|Visio for Enterprise Architects]] edition with some editions of [[Microsoft Visual Studio#Visual Studio .NET 2003|Visual Studio .NET 2003]] and [[Microsoft Visual Studio#Visual Studio 2005|Visual Studio 2005]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://visio.mvps.org/History.htm|title=History of Visio|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=MVPS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110418052835/http://visio.mvps.org/History.htm|archive-date=2011-04-18|dead-url=yes|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Microsoft Visio 2002 Professional, Microsoft introduced Visio Enterprise Network Tools and Visio Network Center. Visio Enterprise Network Tools was an add-on product that enabled automated network and directory services diagramming. Visio Network Center was a subscription-based website where users could locate the latest [[network documentation]] content and exact-replica network equipment shapes from 500 leading manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2001/may01/05-07networkpr.mspx | date = 2001-05-01 | publisher = Microsoft | title = Press release}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former has been discontinued, while the latter's shape-finding features are now integrated into the program itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://support.microsoft.com/kb/327399 | publisher = Microsoft | title = Outils de réseau Visio Enterprise produit abandonné}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visio 2007 was released on November 30, 2006.

Microsoft Visio adopted [[ribbon (computing)|ribbons]] in its [[user interface]] in Visio 2010.&lt;ref name="New in 2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=What's New in Visio 2010 for Automation Developers|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff767103%28v=office.14%29.aspx|work=[[MSDN]]|publisher=Microsoft|at=The ribbon|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft Word]], [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]], [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]], [[Microsoft Access|Access]] and [[Microsoft Outlook|Outlook]] (to some extents) had already adopted the ribbon with the release of [[Microsoft Office 2007]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Use the Ribbon instead of toolbars and menus |url=http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/use-the-ribbon-instead-of-toolbars-and-menus-HA010089895.aspx |work=[[Microsoft Office website]] |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=31 March 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FX0XGkyi?url=http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/use-the-ribbon-instead-of-toolbars-and-menus-HA010089895.aspx |archivedate=31 March 2013 |year=2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no Visio versions 7, 8, or 9, because after Microsoft acquired and branded Visio as a Microsoft Office product, the Visio version numbers followed the Office version numbers. Version 13 was skipped due to [[triskaidekaphobia]].

Visio does not have a [[Mac OS X]] version, which has led to the growth of several third party applications which can open and edit Visio files on Mac.

On 7 May 2001, Microsoft introduced ''Visio Enterprise Network Tools'' (VENT), an add-on for Visio 2002 scheduled for release on 1 July 2001, and ''Visio Network Center'', a subscription-based web service for IT professionals who use Microsoft Visio for [[computer network]] diagramming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft Visio Enterprise Network Tools and Visio Network Center Debut at NetWorld+Interop|url=http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2001/may01/05-07networkpr.aspx|work=News Center|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=31 March 2013|location=[[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]|date=7 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; VENT was discontinued on 1 July 2002 because of very low customer demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visio Enterprise Network Tools product discontinued|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/327399|work=Support|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=31 March 2013|date=27 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9253">'''Model-dependent realism''' is a view of scientific inquiry that focuses on the role of [[scientific model]]s of phenomena.&lt;ref name=Koonin/&gt; It claims reality should be interpreted based upon these models, and where several models overlap in describing a particular subject, multiple, equally valid, realities exist. It claims that it is meaningless to talk about the "true reality" of a model as we can never be ''absolutely'' certain of anything. The only meaningful thing is the [[explanatory power|usefulness of the model]].&lt;ref name=Hawking/&gt; The term "model-dependent realism" was coined by [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Leonard Mlodinow]] in their 2010 book, ''[[The Grand Design (book)|The Grand Design]]''.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt;

==Overview==
Model-dependent realism asserts that all we can know about "reality" consists of networks of ''world pictures'' that explain ''observations'' by connecting them by ''rules'' to concepts defined in ''models''. Will an ultimate [[theory of everything]] be found? Hawking/Mlodinow suggest it is unclear:
{{quote|In the history of science we have discovered a sequence of better and better theories or models, from Plato to the classical theory of Newton to modern quantum theories. It is natural to ask: Will this sequence eventually reach an end point, an ultimate theory of the universe, that will include all forces and predict every observation we can make, or will we continue forever finding better theories, but never one that cannot be improved upon? We do not yet have a definitive answer to this question...&lt;ref name=Sequence/&gt;|Stephen Hawking &amp; Leonard Mlodinow| The Grand Design, p. 8}}

A ''world picture'' consists of the combination of a set of observations accompanied by a conceptual model and by rules connecting the model concepts to the observations. Different world pictures that describe particular data equally well all have equal claims to be valid. There is no requirement that a world picture be unique, or even that the data selected include all available observations. The universe of all observations at present is covered by a ''network'' of overlapping world pictures and, where overlap occurs; multiple, equally valid, world pictures exist. At present, science requires multiple models to encompass existing observations:
{{quote|Like the overlapping maps in a Mercator projection, where the ranges of different versions overlap, they predict the same phenomena. But just as there is no flat map that is a good representation of the earth's entire surface, there is no single theory that is a good representation of observations in all situations&lt;ref name=Mercator/&gt;|Stephen Hawking &amp; Leonard Mlodinow| The Grand Design, p. 9}} Where several models are found for the same phenomena, no single model is preferable to the others within that domain of overlap.

==Model selection==
{{see also|Models of scientific inquiry#Choice of a theory}}
While not rejecting the idea of "reality-as-it-is-in-itself", model-dependent realism suggests that we cannot know "reality-as-it-is-in-itself", but only an approximation of it provided by the intermediary of models. The view of models in model-dependent realism also is related to the [[Instrumentalism|instrumentalist]] approach to modern science, that a concept or theory should be evaluated by how effectively it explains and predicts phenomena, as opposed to how accurately it describes objective reality (a matter possibly impossible to establish). A model is a good model if it:&lt;ref name=Desiderata/&gt;
#Is elegant
#Contains few arbitrary or adjustable elements
#Agrees with and explains all existing observations
#Makes detailed predictions about future observations that can disprove or falsify the model if they are not borne out.
"If the modifications needed to accommodate new observations become too baroque, it signals the need for a new model." &lt;ref name=Baroque/&gt; Of course, an assessment like that is subjective, as are the other criteria.&lt;ref name=Simplicity/&gt; According to Hawking and Mlodinow, even very successful models in use today do not satisfy all these criteria, which are aspirational in nature.&lt;ref name=Failure/&gt;

For example, Hawking and Mlodinow say ([https://books.google.com/books?id=RoO9jkV-yzIC&amp;pg=PA52 ''The Grand Design''], p. 52) "The above criteria are obviously subjective. Elegance, for example, is not something easily measured, but it is highly prized among scientists." The idea of 'too baroque' is connected to 'simplicity': "a theory jammed with fudge factors is not very elegant. To paraphrase Einstein, a theory should be as simple as possible, but not simpler".([https://books.google.com/books?id=RoO9jkV-yzIC&amp;pg=PA52 ''The Grand Design''], p. 52) See also: {{cite web |title=Simplicity in the Philosophy of Science |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |author=Simon Fitzpatrick |date=April 5, 2013 |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/simplici/#H2}} and {{cite web |author= Baker, Alan |title=Simplicity |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor= Edward N.

The word derives from the Latin verb ''narrare'', "to tell", which is derived from the adjective ''gnarus'', "knowing" or "skilled".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Traupman|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Webster|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narrative can be organized in a number of thematic or formal categories: [[non-fiction]] (such as definitively including [[creative non-fiction]], [[biography]], [[journalism]], [[transcript poetry]], and [[historiography]]); fictionalization of historical events (such as [[anecdote]], [[myth]], [[legend]], and [[historical fiction]]); and [[fiction]] proper (such as [[literature]] in [[prose]] and sometimes [[poetry]], such as [[short story|short stories]], [[novel]]s, and [[narrative poetry|narrative poems and song]]s, and imaginary narratives as portrayed in other textual forms, games, or live or recorded performances).

Narrative is found in all forms of human creativity, art, and entertainment, including [[public speaking|speech]], [[literature]], [[theatre]], [[music]] and [[song]], [[comics]], [[journalism]], [[film]], [[television]] and [[video]], [[video game]]s, [[radio program|radio]], [[game]]play, [[play (activity)|unstructured recreation]], and [[performance]] in general, as well as some [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[drawing]], [[photography]], and other [[visual arts]], as long as a [[sequence (disambiguation)|sequence]] of events is presented. Several art movements, such as [[modern art]], refuse the narrative in favor of the [[abstract art|abstract]] and conceptual.

[[Oral storytelling]] is the earliest method for sharing narratives.&lt;ref&gt;International Journal of Education and the Arts | [https://web.archive.org/web/20080630042438/http://www.ijea.org/v2n1/ The Power of Storytelling: How Oral Narrative Influences Children's Relationships in Classrooms]&lt;/ref&gt; During most people's childhoods, narratives are used to guide them on proper behavior, cultural history, formation of a communal identity, and values, as especially studied in [[anthropology]] today among traditional [[indigenous people]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, ''et al.'' 2002. Utilizing Traditional Storytelling to Promote Wellness in American Indian events within any given narrative&lt;/ref&gt;

Narratives may also be nested within other narratives, such as narratives told by an [[unreliable narrator]] (a [[character (arts)|character]]) typically found in [[noir fiction]] genre. An important part of [[narration]] is the [[narrative mode]], the set of methods used to communicate the narrative through a process narration (see also "Narrative Aesthetics" below).

Along with [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], [[argumentation]], and [[description]], narration, broadly defined, is one of four [[rhetorical modes]] of discourse. More narrowly defined, it is the [[fiction-writing mode]] in which the [[narrator]] communicates directly to the reader.

== Overview ==
A narrative is a telling of some true or fictitious event or connected sequence of events, recounted by a narrator to a narratee (although there may be more than one of each).  Narratives are to be distinguished from descriptions of qualities, states, or situations, and also from dramatic enactments of events (although a dramatic work may also include narrative speeches).  A narrative consists of a set of events (the story) recounted in a process of narration (or [[discourse]]), in which the events are selected and arranged in a particular order (the plot).  The category of narratives includes both the shortest accounts of events (for example, ''the cat sat on the mat'', or a brief news item) and the longest historical or biographical works, diaries, travelogues, and so forth, as well as novels, ballads, epics, short stories, and other fictional forms.  In the study of fiction, it is usual to divide novels and shorter stories into first-person narratives and third-person narratives.  As an adjective, "narrative" means "characterized by or relating to storytelling":  thus '''narrative technique''' is the method of telling stories, and '''narrative poetry''' is the class of poems (including ballads, epics, and verse romances) that tell stories, as distinct from dramatic and lyric poetry.  Some theorists of narratology have attempted to isolate the quality or set of properties that distinguishes narrative from non-narrative writings:  this is called '''narrativity'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human nature==
[[Owen Flanagan]] of Duke University, a leading consciousness researcher, writes, "Evidence strongly suggests that humans in all cultures come to cast their own identity in some sort of narrative form. We are inveterate storytellers."&lt;ref&gt;Owen Flanagan ''Consciousness Reconsidered'' 198&lt;/ref&gt; Stories are an important aspect of culture. Many works of art and most works of literature tell stories; indeed, most of the [[humanities]] involve stories.&lt;ref&gt;Humanities tell our stories | https://asunow.asu.edu/content/humanities-tell-our-stories-what-it-means-be-human&lt;/ref&gt;
Stories are of ancient origin, existing in [[ancient Egypt]]ian, [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]], [[Ancient China|Chinese]] and [[History of India|Indian]] cultures and their [[myths]]. Stories are also a ubiquitous component of human communication, used as [[parables]] and examples to illustrate points. [[Storytelling]] was probably one of the earliest forms of entertainment. As noted by Owen Flanagan, narrative may also refer to psychological processes in self-identity, memory and [[meaning-making]].

[[Semiotics]] begins with the individual building blocks of [[meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] called [[sign (semiotics)|signs]]; and [[semantics]], the way in which signs are combined into [[code (semiotics)|codes]] to transmit messages. This is part of a general [[communication]] system using both verbal and non-verbal elements, and creating a discourse with different
[[modality (semiotics)|modalities]] and forms.

In ''On Realism in Art'' [[Roman Jakobson]] argues that literature exists as a separate entity. He and many other semioticians prefer the view that all texts, whether spoken or written, are the same, except that some authors [[encode (semiotics)|encode]] their texts with distinctive ''literary'' qualities that distinguish them from other forms of discourse. Nevertheless, there is a clear trend to address literary narrative forms as separable from other forms. This is first seen in [[Russian Formalism]] through [[Victor Shklovsky]]'s analysis of the relationship between composition and style, and in the work of [[Vladimir Propp]], who analysed the [[plot (narrative)|plots]] used in traditional folk-tales and identified 31 distinct functional components.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Propp, ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p 25, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend (or these trends) continued in the work of the [[Prague linguistic circle|Prague School]] and of French scholars such as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Roland Barthes]]. It leads to a structural analysis of narrative and an increasingly influential body of modern work that raises important theoretical questions:
* What is ''text?''
* What is its role ([[culture]])?
* How is it manifested as art, cinema, theater, or literature?
* Why is narrative divided into different [[genre]]s, such as poetry, [[Wikipedian in Residence|short stories]], and novels?

== Literary theory ==
In literary theoretic approach, narrative is being narrowly defined as [[fiction-writing mode]] in which the narrator is communicating directly to the reader. Until the late 19th century, [[literary criticism]] as an academic exercise dealt solely with [[poetry]] (including [[epic poem]]s like the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Paradise Lost]],'' and poetic drama like [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]). Most [[poem]]s did not have a narrator distinct from the author.

But [[novel]]s, lending a number of voices to several characters in addition to narrator's, created a possibility of narrator's views differing significantly from the author's views. With the rise of the novel in the [[18th century in literature|18th century]], the concept of the narrator (as opposed to "author") made the question of narrator a prominent one for literary theory. It has been proposed that perspective and interpretive knowledge are the essential characteristics, while focalization and structure are lateral characteristics of the narrator.{{According to whom|date=September 2013}}

The role of literary theory in narrative has been disputed; with some interpretations like [[Tzvetan Todorov|Todorov's]] narrative model that views all narratives in a cyclical manner, and that each narrative is characterized by a three part structure that allows the narrative to progress. The beginning stage being an establishment of equilibrium--a state of non conflict, followed by a disruption to this state, caused by an external event, and lastly a restoration or a return to equilibrium--a conclusion that brings the narrative back to a similar space before the events of the narrative unfolded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Todorov|first=Tzvetan|last2=Weinstein|first2=Arnold|date=1969|title=Structural Analysis of Narrative|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1345003|journal=NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction|volume=3|issue=1|pages=70–76|doi=10.2307/1345003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critiques of literary theory in narrative challenge the very role of literariness in narrative, as well as the role of narrative in literature. Meaning, narratives and their associated aesthetics, emotions, and values have the ability to operate without the presence of literature and vice versa. According to Didier Costa, the structural model used by Todorov and others is unfairly biased towards a Western interpretation of narrative, and that a more comprehensive and transformative model must be created in order to properly analyze narrative discourse in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coste|first=Didier|date=2017-06-28|title=Narrative Theory and Aesthetics in Literature|url=http://oxfordre.com/literature/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.001.0001/acrefore-9780190201098-e-116|journal=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Literature|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.013.116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Framing also plays a pivotal role in narrative structure; an analysis of the historical and cultural contexts present during the development of a narrative is needed in order to more accurately represent the role of narratology in societies that relied heavily on oral narratives.

==Types of narrators and their modes==
A writer's choice in the narrator is crucial for the way a work of fiction is perceived by the reader. There is a distinction between [[first-person narrative|first-person]] and [[third-person narrative]], which [[Gérard Genette]] refers to as intradiegetic and extradiegetic narrative, respectively. Intradiagetic narrators are of two types: a homodiegetic narrator participates as a character in the story. Such a narrator cannot know more about other characters than what their actions reveal. A heterodiegetic narrator, in contrast, describes the experiences of the characters that appear in the story in which he or she does not participate.

Most narrators present their story from one of the following perspectives (called [[narrative mode]]s): first-person, or third-person limited or omniscient. Generally, a [[First-person narrative|first-person narrator]] brings greater focus on the feelings, opinions, and perceptions of a particular character in a story, and on how the character views the world and the views of other characters. If the writer's intention is to get inside the world of a character, then it is a good choice, although a [[Third person limited|third-person limited narrator]] is an alternative that does not require the writer to reveal all that a first-person character would know. By contrast, a [[Third-person omniscient narrative|third-person omniscient narrator]] gives a panoramic view of the world of the story, looking into many characters and into the broader background of a story. A third-person omniscient narrator can be an animal or an object, or it can be a more abstract instance that does not refer to itself. For stories in which the context and the views of many characters are important, a third-person narrator is a better choice. However, a third-person narrator does not need to be an omnipresent guide, but instead may merely be the protagonist referring to himself in the third person (also known as third person limited narrator).

=== Multiple narrators ===
{{Main|Multiperspectivity}}
A writer may choose to let several narrators tell the story from different points of view. Then it is up to the reader to decide which narrator seems most reliable for each part of the story. It may refer to the style of the writer in which he/she expresses the paragraph written. See for instance the works of [[Louise Erdrich]]. [[William Faulkner]]'s ''[[As I Lay Dying (novel)|As I Lay Dying]]'' is a prime example of the use of multiple narrators. Faulkner employs [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] to narrate the story from various perspectives.

In Indigenous American communities, narratives and storytelling are often told by a number of elders in the community. In this way, the stories are never static because they are shaped by the relationship between narrator and audience. Thus, each individual story may have countless variations. Narrators often incorporate minor changes in the story in order to tailor the story to different audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Piquemal, 2003. From Native North American Oral Traditions to Western Literacy: Storytelling in Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of multiple narratives in a story is not simply a stylistic choice, but rather an interpretive one that offers insight into the development of a larger social identity and the impact that has on the overarching narrative, as explained by Lee Haring.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haring|first=Lee|date=2004-08-27|title=Framing in Oral Narrative|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/172275|journal=Marvels &amp; Tales|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=229–245|doi=10.1353/mat.2004.0035|issn=1536-1802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haring analyzes the use of framing in oral narratives, and how the usage of multiple perspectives provides the audience with a greater historical and cultural background of the narrative. She also argues that narratives (particularly myths and folktales) that implement multiple narrators deserves to be categorized as its own narrative genre, rather than simply a narrative device that is used solely to explain phenomena from different points of view.

Haring provides an example from the Arabic folktales of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|A Thousand and One Nights]]'' to illustrate how framing was used to loosely connect each story to the next, where each story was enclosed within the larger narrative. Additionally, Haring draws comparisons between ''Thousand and One Nights'' and the oral storytelling observed in parts of rural [[Ireland]], islands of the Southwest Indian Ocean, and African cultures such as [[Madagascar|Madagascar.]]&lt;blockquote&gt;"I'll tell you what I'll do," said the smith. "I'll fix your sword for you tomorrow, if you tell me a story while I'm doing it." The speaker was an Irish storyteller in 1935, framing one story in another (O'Sullivan 75, 264). The moment recalls the Thousand and One Nights , where the story of "The Envier and the Envied" is enclosed in the larger story told by the Second Kalandar (Burton 1 : 113-39), and many stories are enclosed in others."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Aesthetics approach==
Narrative is a highly aesthetic art. Thoughtfully composed stories have a number of aesthetic elements. Such elements include the idea of [[narrative structure]], with identifiable beginnings, middles and ends, or exposition-development-climax-denouement, with coherent plot lines; a strong focus on temporality including retention of the past, attention to present action and protention/future anticipation; a substantial focus on character and characterization, "arguably the most important single component of the novel" ([[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]] ''The Art of Fiction'' 67); different voices interacting, "the sound of the human voice, or many voices, speaking in a variety of accents, rhythms and registers" (Lodge ''The Art of Fiction'' 97; see also the theory of [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] for expansion of this idea); a narrator or narrator-like voice, which "addresses" and "interacts with" reading audiences (see [[Reader Response]] theory); communicates with a [[Wayne Booth]]-esque rhetorical thrust, a dialectic process of interpretation, which is at times beneath the surface, forming a plotted narrative, and at other times much more visible, "arguing" for and against various positions; relies substantially on the use of literary tropes (see [[Hayden White]], ''Metahistory'' for expansion of this idea); is often intertextual with other literatures; and commonly demonstrates an effort toward ''[[bildungsroman]]'', a description of identity development with an effort to evince ''becoming'' in character and community. {{technical statement|date=January 2013}}

== Psychological approach ==
{{see also|Narrative therapy}}
Within [[philosophy of mind]], the [[social sciences]] and various clinical fields including medicine, narrative can refer to aspects of human psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Hevern, V. W. (2004, March). [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~hevern/narpsych/nrintro.html Introduction and general overview. Narrative psychology: Internet and resource guide]. [[Le Moyne College]]. Retrieved September 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A personal narrative process is involved in a person's sense of [[Personal identity|personal]] or [[cultural identity]], and in the creation and construction of [[memories]]; it is thought by some to be the fundamental nature of the [[self]].&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, Daniel C (1992) [http://cogprints.org/266/ The Self as a Center of Narrative Gravity.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dan McAdams |title=Redemptive Self: Narrative Identity in America Today |journal=The Self and Memory |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=95–116 |year=2004 |doi= 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195176933.001.0001|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a729208757~db=all~jumptype=rss|isbn=9780195176933 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The breakdown of a coherent or positive narrative has been implicated in the development of [[psychosis]] and [[mental disorder]], and its repair said to play an important role in journeys of [[recovery model|recovery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gold E |title=From narrative wreckage to islands of clarity: Stories of recovery from psychosis |journal=Can Fam Physician |volume=53 |issue=8 |pages=1271–5 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17872833 |pmc=1949240 }} Hyden, L.-C. &amp; Brockmeier, J. (2009). Health, Illness and Culture: Broken Narratives. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Narrative Therapy]] is a school of (family) [[psychotherapy]].

[[Illness narrative]]s are a way for a person affected by an illness to make sense of his or her experiences.&lt;ref name=Sulik&gt;{{cite book
|author=Gayle A. Sulik

|oclc= 535493589 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They typically follow one of several set patterns: ''restitution'', ''chaos'', or ''quest'' narratives. In the [[restitution]] narrative, the person sees the illness as a temporary detour. The primary goal is to return permanently to normal life and normal health. These may also be called '''cure narratives'''. In the [[chaos narrative]], the person sees the illness as a permanent state that will inexorably get worse, with no redeeming virtues. This is typical of diseases like [[Alzheimer's disease]]: the patient gets worse and worse, and there is no hope of returning to normal life. The third major type, the [[quest narrative]], positions the illness experience as an opportunity to transform oneself into a better person through overcoming adversity and re-learning what is most important in life; the physical outcome of the illness is less important than the spiritual and psychological transformation. This is typical of the triumphant view of [[cancer survivorship]] in the [[breast cancer culture]].&lt;ref name=Sulik /&gt;

Personality traits, more specifically the [[Big Five personality traits]], appear to be associated with the type of language or patterns of word use found in an individual's self-narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsh, J. B., &amp; Peterson, J. B. (2009). Personality and language use in self-narratives. Journal of Research in Personality, 43, 524-527.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, language use in self-narratives accurately reflects human personality. The linguistic correlates of each Big Five trait are as follows:

* [[Extraversion]] - positively correlated with words referring to humans, social processes and family;
* [[Agreeableness]] - positively correlated with family, inclusiveness and certainty; negatively correlated with anger and body (i.e., few negative comments about health/body);
* [[Conscientiousness]] - positively correlated with achievement and work; negatively related to body, death, anger and exclusiveness;
* [[Neuroticism]] - positively correlated with sadness, negative emotion, body, anger, home and anxiety; negatively correlated with work;
* [[Openness]] - positively correlated with perceptual processes, hearing and exclusiveness

== Social sciences approaches==
Human beings often claim to understand events when they manage to formulate a coherent story or narrative explaining how they believe the event was generated. Narratives thus lie at foundations of our cognitive procedures and also provide an explanatory framework for the social sciences, particularly when it is difficult to assemble enough cases to permit statistical analysis. Narrative is often used in [[case study research]] in the social sciences. Here it has been found that the dense, contextual, and interpenetrating nature of social forces uncovered by detailed narratives is often more interesting and useful for both social theory and social policy than other forms of social inquiry.

Sociologists Jaber F. Gubrium and James A. Holstein have contributed to the formation of a constructionist approach to narrative in sociology. From their book The Self We Live By: Narrative Identity in a Postmodern World (2000), to more recent texts such as Analyzing Narrative Reality (2009)and Varieties of Narrative Analysis (2012), they have developed an analytic framework for researching stories and storytelling that is centered on the interplay of institutional discourses (big stories) on the one hand, and everyday accounts (little stories) on the other. The goal is the sociological understanding of formal and lived texts of experience, featuring the production, practices, and communication of accounts.

=== Inquiry approach===
In order to avoid "hardened stories," or "narratives that become context-free, portable and ready to be used anywhere and anytime for illustrative purposes" and are being used as [[conceptual metaphor]]s as defined by linguist [[George Lakoff]], an approach called [[narrative inquiry]] was proposed, resting on the epistemological assumption that human beings make sense of [[random]] or complex multicausal experience by the imposition of story structures."&lt;ref name="conlea"&gt;Conle, C. (2000). Narrative inquiry: Research tool and medium for professional development. European Journal of Teacher Education, 23(1), 49–62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bell"&gt;Bell, J.S. (2002). Narrative Inquiry: More Than Just Telling Stories. TESOL Quarterly, 36(2), 207–213.&lt;/ref&gt; Human propensity to simplify data through a predilection for narratives over complex [[data]] sets typically leads to [[narrative fallacy]]. It is easier for the human mind to remember and make decisions on the basis of stories with meaning, than to remember strings of data. This is one reason why narratives are so powerful and why many of the classics in the humanities and social sciences are written in the narrative format. But humans read meaning into data and compose stories, even where this is unwarranted. In narrative inquiry, the way to avoid the narrative fallacy is no different from the way to avoid other error in scholarly research, i.e., by applying the usual methodical checks for [[Validity (logic)|validity]] and reliability in how data are collected, analyzed, and presented.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Several criteria for assessing the validity of narrative research was proposed, including the objective aspect, the emotional aspect, the social/moral aspect, and the clarity of the story.

===Mathematical sociology approach ===
In mathematical sociology, the theory of comparative narratives was devised in order to describe and compare the structures (expressed as "and" in a [[directed graph]] where multiple causal links incident into a node are conjoined) of action-driven sequential events.&lt;ref name="abell1987"&gt;Abell. P. (1987) The Syntax of Social Life: the theory and Method of Comparative Narratives, Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abell1993"&gt;Abell, P. (1993) Some Aspects of Narrative Method, Journal of Mathematical Sociology, 18. 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abell2009"&gt;Abell, P. (2009) A Case for Cases, Comparative Narratives in Sociological Explanation, Sociological Methods and Research, 32, 1-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Narratives so conceived comprise the following ingredients:
* A finite set of state descriptions of the world S, the components of which are weakly ordered in time;
* A finite set of actors/agents (individual or collective), P;
* A finite set of actions A;
* A mapping of P onto A;

The structure ([[directed graph]]) is generated by letting the nodes stand for the states and the directed edges represent how the states are changed by specified actions. The action skeleton can then be abstracted, comprising a further digraph where the actions are depicted as nodes and edges take the form "action '''a''' co-determined (in context of other actions) action '''b'''".

Narratives can be both abstracted and generalised by imposing an [[Abstract algebra|algebra]] upon their structures and thence defining [[homomorphism]] between the algebras. The insertion of action-driven causal links in a narrative can be achieved using the method of Bayesian narratives.

;Bayesian narratives
Developed by [[Peter Abell]], the theory of Bayesian Narratives conceives a narrative as a [[directed graph]] comprising multiple causal links (social interactions) of the general form: "action '''''a''''' causes action '''''b''''' in a specified context". In the absence of sufficient comparative cases to enable statistical treatment of the causal links, items of evidence in support and against a particular causal link are assembled and used to compute the Bayesian likelihood ratio of the link. Subjective causal statements of the form "I/she did '''b''' because of '''a'''" and subjective [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactuals]] "if it had not been for '''a''' I/she would not have done '''b'''" are notable items of evidence.&lt;ref name="abell2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abell2011"&gt;Abell, P.

(2009) History, Case Studies, Statistics and Causal Inference, ''European Sociological review'', 25, 561–569&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music==
Linearity is one of several narrative qualities that can be found in a musical composition.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Gloag and David Beard, Musicology: The Key Concepts (New York: Routledge, 2009), 114&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by American musicologist, [[Edward Cone]], narrative terms are also present in the analytical language about music.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_a"&gt;Beard and Gloag, ''Musicology'', 113–117&lt;/ref&gt; The different components of a fugue — subject, answer, exposition, discussion and summary — can be cited as an example.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag"&gt;Beard and Gloag, ''Musicology'', 115&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are several views on the concept of narrative in music and the role it plays.
One theory is that of Theodore Adorno, who has suggested that ‘music recites itself, is its own context, narrates without narrative’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag" /&gt; Another, is that of Carolyn Abbate, who has suggested that ‘certain gestures experienced in music constitute a narrating voice’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_a" /&gt; Still others have argued that narrative is a semiotic enterprise that can enrich musical analysis.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag" /&gt;
The French musicologist Jean-Jacques Nattiez contends that ‘the narrative, strictly speaking, is not in the music, but in the plot imagined and constructed by the listeners’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_b"&gt;Beard and Gloag, ''Musicology'', 116&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that discussing music in terms of [[narrativity]] is simply metaphorical and that the ‘imagined plot’ may be influenced by the work's title or other programmatic information provided by the composer.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_b" /&gt; However, Abbate has revealed numerous examples of musical devices that function as narrative voices, by limiting music’s ability to narrate to rare ‘moments that can be identified by their bizarre and disruptive effect’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_b" /&gt; Various theorists share this view of narrative appearing in disruptive rather than normative moments in music.
The final word is yet to be said, regarding narratives in music, as there is still much to be determined.

==In cultural storytelling==
A narrative can take on the shape of a story, which gives listeners an entertaining and collaborative avenue for acquiring knowledge. Many cultures use [[storytelling]] as a way to record histories, myths, and values. These stories can be seen as living entities of narrative among cultural communities, as they carry the shared experience and history of the culture within them. Stories are often used within [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|indigenous cultures]] in order to share knowledge to the younger generation.&lt;ref&gt;http://cojmc.unl.edu/nativedaughters/storytellers/native-storytellers-connect-the-past-and-the-future&lt;/ref&gt; Due to indigenous narratives leaving room for open-ended interpretation, native stories often engage children in the storytelling process so that they can make their own meaning and explanations within the story. This promotes holistic thinking among native children, which works towards merging an individual and world identity. Such an identity upholds native epistemology and gives children a sense of belonging as their cultural identity develops through the sharing and passing on of stories.&lt;ref&gt;Piquemal, N. 2003. From Native North American Oral Traditions to Western Literacy: Storytelling in Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a number of indigenous stories are used to illustrate a value or lesson. In the [[Western Apache]] tribe, stories can be used to warn of the misfortune that befalls people when they do not follow acceptable behavior. One story speaks to the offense of a mother's meddling in her married son's life. In the story, the Western Apache tribe is under attack from a neighboring tribe, the Pimas. The Apache mother hears a scream. Thinking it is her son's wife screaming, she tries to intervene by yelling at him. This alerts the Pima tribe to her location, and she is promptly killed due to intervening in her son's life.&lt;ref&gt;Basso, 1984. "Stalking with Stories". Names, Places, and Moral Narratives Among the Western Apache.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indigenous American cultures use [[Storytelling#Storytelling in indigenous cultures|storytelling]] to teach children the values and lessons of life. 
Although storytelling provides entertainment, its primary purpose is to educate.&lt;ref name="Hodge"&gt;Hodge, F., Pasqua, A., Marquez, C., &amp; Geishirt-Cantrell, B. (2002). Utilizing Traditional Storytelling to Promote Wellness in American Indian Communities. Journal of Transcultural Nursing, 6-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Alaskan Indigenous Natives state that narratives teach children where they fit in, what their society expects of them, how to create a peaceful living environment, and to be responsible, worthy members of their communities.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt; In the Mexican culture, many adult figures tell their children stories in order to teach children values such as individuality, obedience, honesty, trust, and compassion.&lt;ref name="McDonald"&gt;MacDonald, M., McDowell, J., Dégh, L., &amp; [[Toelken, B.]] (1999). Traditional storytelling today: An international sourcebook. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one of the versions of [[La Llorona]] is used to teach children to make safe decisions at night and to maintain the morals of the community.&lt;ref name="McDonald" /&gt;

Narratives are considered by the Canadian Métis community, to help children understand that the world around them is interconnected to their lives and communities.&lt;ref name="Iseke"&gt;Iseke, Judy. (1998). Learning Life Lessons from Indigenous Storytelling with Tom McCallum.
Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Métis community share the “Humorous Horse Story” to children, which portrays that horses stumble throughout life just like humans do.&lt;ref name="Iseke"/&gt; [[Navajo]] stories also use dead animals as metaphors by showing that all things have purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Eder, D. J. (2007). Bringing Navajo Storytelling Practices into Schools: The Importance of Maintaining Cultural Integrity. Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly, 38: 278–296.&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, elders from [[Alaska Natives|Alaskan Native]] communities claim that the use of animals as metaphors allow children to form their own perspectives while at the same time self-reflecting on their own lives.&lt;ref name="Iseke"/&gt;

[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] elders also state that storytelling invites the listeners, especially children, to draw their own conclusions and perspectives while self-reflecting upon their lives.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt; Furthermore, they insist that narratives help children grasp and obtain a wide range of perspectives that help them interpret their lives in the context of the story. American Indian community members emphasize to children that the method of obtaining knowledge can be found in stories passed down through each generation. Moreover, community members also let the children interpret and build a different perspective of each story.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt;

==Historiography==
In [[historiography]], according to [[Lawrence Stone]], narrative has traditionally been the main [[rhetorical device]] used by historians. In 1979, at a time when the new [[Social History]] was demanding a social-science model of analysis, Stone detected a move back toward the narrative. Stone defined narrative as organized chronologically; focused on a single coherent story; descriptive rather than analytical; concerned with people not abstract circumstances; and dealing with the particular and specific rather than the collective and statistical. He reported that, "More and more of the '[[new historian]]s' are now trying to discover what was going on inside people's heads in the past, and what it was like to live in the past, questions which inevitably lead back to the use of narrative."&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Stone, "The Revival of Narrative: Reflections on a New Old History," ''Past and Present'' 85 (1979), pp. 3–24, quote on 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers identify narratives with a type of explanation. [[Mark Bevir]] argues, for example, that narratives explain actions by appealing to the beliefs and desires of actors and by locating webs of beliefs in the context of historical traditions. Narrative is an alternative form of explanation to that associated with natural science.

Historians committed to a social science approach, however, have criticized the narrowness of narrative and its preference for anecdote over analysis, and clever examples rather than statistical regularities.&lt;ref&gt;J. Morgan Kousser, "The Revivalism of Narrative: A Response to Recent Criticisms of Quantitative History," ''Social Science History'' vol 8, no. 2 (Spring 1984): 133–49; Eric H. Monkkonen, "The Dangers of Synthesis," ''American Historical Review'' 91, no. 5 (December 1986): 1146–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storytelling rights ==
Storytelling rights may be broadly defined as the ethics of sharing narratives (including—but not limited to—firsthand, secondhand and imagined stories). In ''Storytelling Rights: The uses of oral and written texts by urban adolescents'', author Amy Shuman offers the following definition of storytelling rights: “the important and precarious relationship between narrative and event and, specifically, between the participants in an event and the reporters who claim the right to talk about what happened."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13643520|title=Storytelling rights : the uses of oral and written texts by urban adolescents|last=1951-|first=Shuman, Amy,|date=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521328462|location=Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]|oclc=13643520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethics of retelling other people’s stories may be explored through a number of [[question]]s: whose [[Story arc|story]] is being told and how, what is the story’s purpose or aim, what does the story promise (for instance: empathy, redemption, authenticity, clarification)--and at whose benefit? Storytelling rights also implicates questions of consent, [[empathy]], and accurate representation. While storytelling—and retelling—can function as a powerful tool for [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] and [[advocacy]], it can also lead to misunderstanding and exploitation.

[[Storytelling]] rights is notably important in the [[genre]] of [[personal experience]] narrative. Academic disciplines such as [[performance]], [[folklore]], [[literature]], [[anthropology]], [[Cultural studies|Cultural Studies]] and other [[social science]]s may involve the study of storytelling rights, often hinging on ethics.

[[Indigenous peoples of Oceania]] and [[Circumpolar peoples]], and perhaps other populations of [[Asian people|Asiatic]] origin are similarly affected and perhaps genetically predisposed.&lt;ref name="Gracey1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gracey|first=Michael|year=1995|title=New World syndrome in Western Australian aborigines|journal=Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Physiology|volume=22|issue=3|pages=220–225|issn=0305-1870|doi=10.1111/j.1440-1681.1995.tb01985.x|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119247811/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized by [[obesity]], [[heart disease]], [[diabetes]], [[hypertension]], and shortened [[life expectancy|life span]].

==Causes==

New World Syndrome is linked to a change from a [[traditional diet]]  and [[physical exercise|exercise]] to a [[Western diet]] and a sedentary lifestyle. Along with the lack of money. Traditional occupations of indigenous people—such as fishing, farming, and hunting—tended to involve constant activity, whereas modern office jobs do not. The introduction of modern transportation such as automobiles also decreased physical exertion.&lt;ref name="Atlantic2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shell|first=Ellen Ruppel|year=2001|title=New World Syndrome - Spam and turkey tails have turned Micronesians into Macronesians.

The '''Odic force''' (also called '''Od''' [õd], '''Odyle''', '''Önd''', '''Odes''', '''Odylic''', '''Odyllic''', or '''Odems''') is the name given in the mid-19th century to a hypothetical [[vitalism|vital energy]] or [[Energy (esotericism)|life force]] by [[Carl Reichenbach|Baron Carl von Reichenbach]]. Von Reichenbach coined the name from that of the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] [[god]] [[Odin]] in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, William F. (2000). ''[[Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience|Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience: From Alien Abductions to Zone Therapy]]''. Facts on File Inc. p. 299. {{ISBN|1-57958-207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, Theresa. (2009). ''The Shadow of Enlightenment: Optical and Political Transparency in France, 1789-1848''. Oxford University Press. p. 113. {{ISBN|978-0-19-954470-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of Odic force is called ''odology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chrisomalis|first1=Stephen|title=O|url=http://phrontistery.info/o.html|website=The Phrontistery|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

As von Reichenbach was investigating the manner in which the human [[nervous system]] could be affected by various substances, he conceived the existence of a new force allied to [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], and [[heat]], a force which he thought was radiated by most substances, and to the influence of which different persons are variously [[Sensitivity (human)|sensitive]].&lt;ref&gt;Serge Kahili King, Serge King ''Earth Energies: A Quest for the Hidden Power of the Planet'' 1992, Chapter 3 The Odic Force and Reichenbach, pp. 38-60&lt;/ref&gt; He named this [[vitalism|vitalist]] concept ''Odic force''. Proponents say that Odic force permeates all plants, animals, and humans.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Coddington ''Seekers of the Healing Energy: Reich, Cayce, the Kahunas, and Other Masters of the Vital Force'' 1991, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Believers in Odic force said that it is visible in total darkness as colored [[Aura (paranormal)|auras]] surrounding living things, crystals, and magnets, but that viewing it requires hours first spent in total darkness, and only very sensitive people have the ability to see it.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Johannes Thiel ''The Diagnosis Of Disease By Observation Of The Eye To Enable Physicians, Healers, Teachers, Parents to Read the Eyes'' Kessinger Reprint Edition, 2004, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; They also said that it resembles the Asian concepts [[prana]] and [[qi]]. However, they regarded the ''Odic force'' as not associated with breath (like [[India]]'s [[prana]] and the [[qi]] of Chinese martial arts) but rather mainly with biological [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] fields.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Woodhouse ''Paradigm Wars: Worldviews for a New Age'' 1996, pp. 191-192&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Reichenbach did not tie Odic force into other vitalist theories. Baron von Reichenbach expounded the concept of Odic force in detail in a book-length article, ''Researches on Magnetism'', ''Electricity'', ''Heat and Light in their Relations to Vital Forces'', which appeared in a special issue of a respected scientific journal, ''Annalen der Chemie und Physik''. He said that (1) the Odic force had a positive and negative [[flux]], and a light and dark side; (2) individuals could forcefully "emanate" it, particularly from the hands, mouth, and forehead; and (3) the Odic force had many possible applications.

The Odic force was conjectured to explain the phenomenon of [[hypnotism]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Odylic force |volume=20 |pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], impetus was given to this view of the subject following the translation of Reichenbach's ''Researches'' by Dr. Gregory, professor of [[chemistry]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; These later researches tried to show many of the Odic phenomena to be of the same nature as those described previously by [[Franz Mesmer]] and even long before Mesmer by [[Swedenborg]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles R. Kelley ''Life Force... the Creative Process in Man And in Nature'' 2004, pp. 286-287&lt;/ref&gt;

The French parapsychologists Hippolyte Baraduc and [[Albert de Rochas]] were influenced by the concept of the Odic force.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Clarke, Linda Dalrymple Henderson ''From Energy to Information: Representation in Science and Technology, Art and Literature'' 2002, pp. 140-141&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Reichenbach hoped to develop scientific proof for a universal life force; however, his experiments relied on perceptions reported by individuals who claimed to be "sensitive", as he himself could not observe any of the reported phenomena. The "sensitives" had to work in total or near-total darkness to be able to observe the phenomena. Reichenbach stated that, through experimentation, possibly 1/3 of the population could view the phenomenon, but far less otherwise.

== Scientific reception ==

The concept of Odic force was criticized by the [[scientific community]] as there was no reliable or replicable data for its existence. In the 19th century it was described as [[quackery]] by critics and is regarded today as an example of [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;Steavenson, William Edward. (1884). ''Electricity &amp; Its Manner of Working in the Treatment of Disease''. London : J. &amp; A. Churchill. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Jastrow|Jastrow, Joseph]]. (1935). ''Wish and Wisdom: Episodes in the Vagaries of Belief''. D. Appleton-Century Company. pp. 341-349. (Published in 1962 by Dover Books as ''Error and Eccentricity in Human Belief'').&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radner, Daisie; Radner, Michael. (1982). ''Science and Unreason''. Wadsworth. pp. 24-29. {{ISBN|0-534-01153-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science writer [[Martin Gardner]] in his book ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]'' (1957) noted that "scientists were unable to duplicate the baron's experiments."&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Gardner|Gardner, Martin]]. (2012 edition, originally published in 1957). ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]''. Dover Publications. p. 345. {{ISBN|0-486-20394-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Todd Carroll]] in ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]'' has written:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The baron had no training in psychology or psychopathology and no training in devising experiments involving people. He applied many standard scientific techniques and followed standard practices of data collection and recording, including graphs and charts. But he seems to have had no sense of how to do a controlled experiment with so-called "sensitives," people who might better be described as neurotics or delusional. ([[Joseph Jastrow|Jastrow]] says that for the most part, his subjects were "neurotic young women.") Given the fact that he deceived himself so thoroughly over such a long period of time, it seems reasonable to assume that he was (at the very least) unconsciously suggesting behaviors to his subjects. His enthusiasm for the project undoubtedly biased his subjective observations. That he came to think that the odic force could explain dozens of disparate phenomena, while being unable to convince other scientists that he had discovered anything, signifies the pathological nature of his investigations. Reichenbach's pursuit of the odic force is a classic example of [[pathological science]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/reichenbach.html "Reichenbach's Odic force"]. The Skeptic's Dictionary. Retrieved 18 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scientists have abandoned concepts such as the Odic force. In western popular culture the name is used in a similar way to [[qi]] or [[prana]] to refer to [[Energy (spiritual)|spiritual energies]] or the [[vital force]] associated with living things. In Europe, the Odic force has been mentioned in books on [[dowsing]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Karl |last=Spiesberger |year=1989 |origyear=1962 |authorlink=Karl Spiesberger |trans-title=Reveal the Power of the Pendulum: Secrets of the Sidereal Pendulum, A Complete Survey of Pendulum Dowsing |isbn=0-572-01419-8 |title=Der erfolgreiche Pendel-Praktiker: Das Geheimnis des siderischen Pendels - Ein Querschnitt durch das Gesamtgebiet der Pendel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Learnard was born in [[Fairfax, Vermont]] on November 14, 1832, the son of Stephen Tracy and Polly (Dee) Learnard, and was educated at [[Bakersfield Academy]] before entering [[Norwich University]] in 1852.&lt;ref name="Ellis1911"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Arba Ellis|title=Norwich University, 1819-1911|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=148pAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA559|year=1911|publisher=Capital city Press|page=559}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later studied at [[Albany Law School]], and was admitted to the bar in 1855.&lt;ref name="Ellis1911" /&gt; He moved to Ohio in the summer of 1855. During the winter of 1855–1856, he moved to [[Lawrence, Kansas]] and joined the effort to have Kansas admitted as a free state.&lt;ref name=papers /&gt;&lt;ref name="Armitage2010" /&gt;

==Career and military service==
In 1857, Learnard helped set out the town of [[Burlington, Kansas]] and built the first mill, the first business building, and a structure used as a school and church.&lt;ref name=papers/&gt; He served as a member of the council of the first free state legislature from 1857 to 1859. Learnard was judge of the 5th Judicial Circuit after the state government was established.&lt;ref name=papers /&gt; He supported the [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free State Movemeent]], opposing slavery,&lt;ref name="Ellis1911"/&gt; and was a local organizer for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Standard History of Kansas and Kansans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HHJHAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1248|year=1919|publisher=Lewis Publishing Company|page=1248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Learnard resigned his judgeship at the beginning of the Civil War. He enrolled as a lieutenant colonel in the [[1st Regiment Kansas Volunteer Infantry|1st Kansas regiment]] and served until he resigned his commission in 1863. He participated in [[Price's Raid]] of Kansas, the [[Battle of Little Blue River]], and at [[Westport, Missouri]] in 1864.&lt;ref name=papers/&gt;

After the war, he served in the state senate from 1868 to 1871.&lt;ref name="Ellis1911"/&gt; He worked for the [[Kansas City, Memphis and Birmingham Railroad|Kansas City, Fort Scott &amp; Memphis Railroad Company]] as a tax commissioner and special attorney for a quarter of a century.&lt;ref name=papers /&gt; Learnard became proprietor of the local daily and weekly newspaper, the ''Lawrence Journal'', which he ran beginning in 1884.&lt;ref name=papers /&gt;&lt;ref name="Armitage2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KSHS newspapers"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kansas State Historical Society|title=List by Counties of Newspapers and Periodicals Published in Kansas, March 1q, 1884|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wo1TAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA9|year=1887|publisher=Kansas Publishing|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Learnard was said to have operated the paper until it was owned by the Journal company, in or before&lt;ref name=papers /&gt; 1911.&lt;ref name="Armitage2010"/&gt; William Elsey Connelley states in the ''History of Kansas Newspapers'' that the  ''Lawrence Journal'' weekly edition operated from 1886 until 1909 and the daily edition was published until 1911, when it was consolidated with other papers into the ''Lawrence Daily Journal-World''.&lt;ref name="Connelley"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Elsey Connelley|title=History of Kansas newspapers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ijmNBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA180|date=December 7, 2017|publisher=William Elsey Connelley|pages=180, 181|id=GGKEY:HFSDUARLER4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learnard was the editor of the paper, which was owned by the Lawrence Journal Company.&lt;ref name="KSHS newspapers" /&gt;}} Land that he had owned was used  in 1889 to establish a [[American Indian boarding schools|native American school]] called the Haskill Institute, where he was superintendent for a year.&lt;ref name=papers /&gt;&lt;ref name="Armitage2010"/&gt;

A '''peace movement''' is a [[social movement]] that seeks to achieve ideals such as the ending of a particular [[war]] (or all wars), minimize inter-human violence in a particular place or type of situation, and is often linked to the goal of achieving [[world peace]]. Means to achieve these ends include advocacy of [[pacifism]], [[non-violent resistance]], [[diplomacy]], [[boycott]]s, [[peace camp]]s, [[moral purchasing]], supporting [[anti-war]] political candidates, legislation to remove the profit from government contracts to the [[Military–industrial complex]], banning guns, creating [[open government]] and [[government transparency|transparency]] tools,  [[direct democracy]], supporting [[Whistleblowers]] who expose [[War crime|War-Crimes]] or conspiracies to create wars, [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], and national [[Interest group|political lobbying]] groups to create legislation. The political cooperative is an example of an organization that seeks to merge all peace movement organizations and green organizations, which may have some diverse goals, but all of whom have the common goal of peace and humane sustainability. A concern of some [[List of peace activists|peace activists]] is the challenge of attaining peace when those that oppose it often use violence as their means of communication and empowerment.

Some people refer to the global loose affiliation of activists and political interests as having a shared purpose and this constituting a single movement, "''the'' peace movement", an all encompassing "anti-war movement". Seen this way, the two are often indistinguishable and constitute a loose, responsive, event-driven collaboration between groups with motivations as diverse as [[humanism]], [[environmentalism]], [[veganism]], [[anti-racism]], [[feminism|anti-sexism]], [[decentralization]], [[hospitality service|hospitality]], [[ideology]], [[theology]], and [[faith]].

==The ideal of peace==

There are different ideas over what "peace" is (or should be), which results in a plurality of movements seeking diverse ideals of peace. Particularly, "anti-war" movements often have short-term goals, while peace movements advocate an ongoing life-style and proactive government policy.

It is often not clear whether a movement or a particular protest is against war in general, as in [[pacifism]], or against one's own government's participation in a war. Indeed, some observers feel that this lack of clarity or long term continuity has represented a key part of the strategy of those seeking to end a war, e.g., the [[Vietnam War]].

[[Protests against the 2003 Iraq war|Global protests against the U.S. invasion of Iraq]] in early 2003 are an example of a more specific, short term and loosely affiliated [[single-issue]] "movement" —with relatively scattered ideological priorities, ranging from absolutist [[pacifism]] to [[Islamism]] and [[Anti-Americanism]] (see [[Human shield action to Iraq]]). Nonetheless, some of those who are involved in several such short term movements and build up trust relationships with others within them, do tend to eventually join more global or long-term movements.

By contrast, some elements of the global peace movement seek to guarantee [[Human security|health security]] by ending war and assuring what they see as basic [[human rights]] including the right of all people to have access to air, water, food, shelter and [[universal health care|health care]]. A number of activists seek [[social justice]] in the form of equal protection under the law and equal opportunity under the law for groups that have previously been disenfranchised.

The Peace movement is primarily characterized by a belief that humans should not wage war on each other or engage in violent [[Ethnic war|ethnic cleansing]]s over language, race or [[natural resources]] or [[Ethical dilemma|ethical conflict]] over [[religion]] or [[ideology]]. Long-term opponents of war preparations are primarily characterized by a belief that [[Armed forces|military power]] is not the equivalent of [[justice]].

The Peace movement tends to oppose the proliferation of dangerous technologies and [[weapons of mass destruction]], in particular [[nuclear weapons]] and [[biological warfare]]. Moreover, many object to the export of weapons including hand-held [[machine guns]] and [[grenades]] by [[G7|leading economic nations]] to lesser developed nations. Some, like [[SIPRI]], have voiced special concern that [[artificial intelligence]], [[molecular engineering]], [[genetics]] and [[proteomics]] have even more vast destructive potential. Thus there is intersection between peace movement elements and [[Neo-luddism|Neo-Luddites]] or [[primitivism]], but also with the more mainstream technology critics such as the [[Green parties]], [[Greenpeace]] and the [[ecology movement]] they are part of.

It is one of several movements that led to the formation of [[Green party]] political associations in many democratic countries near the end of the 20th century. The peace movement has a very strong influence in some countries' green parties, such as in [[Germany]], perhaps reflecting that country's negative experiences with [[militarism]] in the [[History of Germany|20th century]].

==History==

===Peace and Truce of God ===
{{Main|Peace and Truce of God}}
The first mass peace movements in history were the [[Peace of God]] (''Pax Dei''), being first proclaimed in AD 989 at the Council of Charroux, and the [[Truce of God]] evolving out of it and being first proclaimed in 1027. The Peace of God originated as a response to increasing violence against monasteries in the aftermath of the fall of the Carolingian dynasty, spearheaded by bishops and "was promoted at a number of subsequent [church] councils, including important ones at Charroux (c. 989 and c. 1028), Narbonne (990), Limoges (994 and 1031), Poitiers (c. 1000), and Bourges (1038)". The Truce of God sought to restrain violence by limiting the number of days of the week and times of the year where the nobility were able to practice violence. These peace movements "set the foundations for modern European peace movements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Peace of God |url= https://www.britannica.com/topic/Peace-of-God |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |author= Daniel Francis Callahan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historic peace churches===
[[File:Edward Hicks - Penn's Treaty.jpeg |thumb|right|[[Penn Treaty Park|Penn's Treaty]] with the Indians. This treaty was never violated.]]
Beginning in the 16th century, the [[Protestant Reformation]] gave rise to a variety of new Christian sects, including the [[Peace churches|historic peace churches]]. Foremost among them were the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers), [[Amish]], [[Mennonites]] and [[Church of the Brethren]]. The Quakers were prominent advocates of pacifism, who as early as 1660 had repudiated violence in all forms and adhered to a strictly pacifist interpretation of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Quaker Traditions of Pacifism and Nonviolence |url= http://events.stanford.edu/events/352/35227/ |author= Eric Roberts |publisher= Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the many 18th century wars in which Britain participated, the Quakers maintained a principled commitment [[Conscientious objector|not to serve in the army and militia]] or even to pay the alternative £10 fine.

=== 18th century ===
The 18th-century peace movements were products of two strands of thought that coalesced at the end of the 18th century. One, rooted in the secular [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], promoted peace as the rational antidote to the world's ills, while the other was a part of the [[Evangelicalism|evangelical religious revival]] that had played an important part in the campaign for the [[abolitionism|abolition of slavery]]. Representatives of the former, included [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], in ''Extrait du Projet de Paix Perpetuelle de Monsieur l'Abbe Saint-Pierre'' (1756),&lt;ref&gt;Hinsley, pp. 46-61.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]], in his ''Thoughts on Perpetual Peace''.&lt;ref&gt;Hinsley,
pp.62-80.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jeremy Bentham]] who proposed the formation of a peace association in 1789. Representative of the latter, was [[William Wilberforce]] who thought that strict limits should be imposed on British involvement in the [[French Revolutionary War]] based on Christian ideals of peace and brotherhood.

===Peace movements===
During the period of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], although no formal peace movement was established until the end of hostilities, a significant peace movement animated by universalist ideals did emerge, due to the perception of Britain fighting in a [[reactionary]] role and the increasingly visible impact of the war on the welfare of the nation in the form of higher taxation levels and high casualty rates. Sixteen peace petitions to [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] were signed by members of the public, anti-war and anti-[[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] demonstrations convened and peace literature was widely published and disseminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lx4xr3PsdI8C&amp;dq=freemason+hall+1843+london+peace&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The Origins of War Prevention: The British Peace Movement and International Relations, 1730–1854|author=Ceadel, Martin|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press,|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henry Richard, Vanity Fair, 1880-09-04.jpg|thumb|"Peace". Caricature of [[Henry Richard]], a prominent advocate of pacifism in the mid-19th century.]]
The first peace movements appeared in 1815–16. In the [[United States]] the first such movement was the [[New York Peace Society]], founded in 1815 by the theologian [[David Low Dodge]], and the [[Massachusetts Peace Society]]. It became an active organization, holding regular weekly meetings, and producing literature which was spread as far as [[Gibraltar]] and [[Malta]], describing the horrors of war and advocating pacificism on [[Christianity|Christian]] grounds.&lt;ref&gt;''Pacifism to 1914 : an overview'' by Peter Brock. Toronto, Thistle Printing, 1994. (pp. 38-9).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Peace Society|London Peace Society]] (also known as the Society for the Promotion of Permanent and Universal Peace) was formed in 1816 to promote permanent and universal peace by the [[philanthropy|philanthropist]] [[William Allen (Quaker)|William Allen]]. In the 1840s, British women formed "Olive Leaf Circles", groups of around 15 to 20 women, to discuss and promote pacifist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''The Long Road to Greenham : Feminism and Anti-Militarism in Britain since 1820'', by [[Jill Liddington]]. London, Virago, 1989 {{ISBN|0-86068-688-4}} (pp. 14-5).&lt;/ref&gt;

The peace movement began to grow in influence by the mid nineteenth century. The London Peace Society, under the initiative of [[Elihu Burritt]] and [[Henry Richard]], convened the first [[International Peace Congress]] in London in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Peace.html?id=JCgvvXUzu-oC&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Peace: A History of Movements and Ideas|author=Cortright, David|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The congress decided on two aims: the ideal of peaceable arbitration in the affairs of nations and the creation of an international institution to achieve that. [[Henry Richard|Richard]] became the secretary of the Peace Society in 1850 on a full-time basis, a position which he would keep for the next 40 years, earning himself a reputation as the 'Apostle of Peace'. He helped secure one of the earliest victories for the peace movement by securing a commitment from the [[Great Power]]s in the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)]] at the end of the [[Crimean War]], in favour of arbitration. On the European continent, wracked by [[1848 Revolution|social upheaval]], the first peace congress was held in [[Brussels]] in 1848 followed by [[Paris]] a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gustave Moynier and the peace societies|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/57jnaw.htm|publisher=[[International Committee of the Red Cross]]|author=André Durand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After experiencing a recession in support due to the resurgence of militarism during the [[American Civil War]] and [[Crimean War]], the movement began to spread across Europe and began to infiltrate the new [[working class]] [[socialism|socialist]] movements. In 1870, [[Randal Cremer]] formed the [[International Arbitration League|Workman's Peace Association]] in London. Cremer, alongside the French economist [[Frédéric Passy]] was also the founding father of the first international organisation for the arbitration of conflicts in 1889, the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]]. The [[National Peace Council]] was founded in after the 17th [[Universal Peace Congress]] in London (July August 1908).

===Nonviolent resistance===
[[File:Gandhi spinning.jpg|left|thumb|[[Mahatma Gandhi]], leader of the [[Indian independence movement]] and advocate of [[nonviolent resistance]].]]
[[Mahatma Gandhi]] (1869–1948) of India was one of the most influential spokesman for peace and non-violence in the 20th century. ''[[Gandhism]]'' comprises the ideas and principles Gandhi promoted. Of central importance is nonviolent resistance.  M.M. Sankhdher argues that Gandhism is not a systematic position in metaphysics or in political philosophy. Rather, it is a political creed, an economic doctrine, a religious outlook, a moral precept, and especially, a humanitarian world view. It is an effort not to systematize wisdom but to transform society and is based on an undying faith in the goodness of human nature.&lt;ref&gt;M.M. Sankhdher, "Gandhism: A Political Interpretation", ''Gandhi Marg'' (1972) pp. 68–74&lt;/ref&gt;  Gandhi was strongly influenced by the pacifist ideas of Russian novelist [[Leo Tolstoy]]. In 1908 Tolstoy wrote ''[[A Letter to a Hindu]],'' which said that only by using love as a weapon through [[passive resistance]] could the Indian people overthrow colonial rule. In 1909, Gandhi and Tolstoy began a correspondence regarding practical and theological applications of non-violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mahatma Gandhi and Leo Tolstoy: Letters |editor=Murthy, B. Srinivasa |year= 1987|isbn=0-941910-03-2|url=http://bsmurthy.com/download/Mahatma_Gandhi_Leostoy_Letters_by_BSM.pdf|publisher=Long Beach Publications|location=Long Beach, California|accessdate=14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gandhi saw himself a disciple of Tolstoy, for they agreed regarding opposition to state authority and colonialism; both hated violence and preached non-resistance.  However, they differed sharply on political strategy. Gandhi called for political involvement; he was a nationalist and was prepared to use nonviolent force. He was also willing to compromise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Green, Martin Burgess |title=The origins of nonviolence: Tolstoy and Gandhi in their historical settings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D0luAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=17 January 2012|year=1986|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|isbn=978-0-271-00414-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi was the first to apply the principle of nonviolence on a large scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last =Asirvatham|first =Eddy|title =Political Theory|publisher=S.chand|isbn=81-219-0346-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of [[nonviolence]] (''[[ahimsa]]'') and [[nonresistance]] has a long history in Indian religious thought and has had many revivals in Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Jewish and Christian contexts. Gandhi explains his philosophy and way of life in his autobiography ''[[The Story of My Experiments with Truth]]''. Some of his other remarks were widely quoted, such as "There are many causes that I am prepared to die for but no causes that I am prepared to kill for."&lt;ref&gt;James Geary, ''Geary's Guide to the World's Great Aphorists'' (2007) p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi realized later that this level of nonviolence required incredible faith and courage, which he believed everyone did not possess. He therefore advised that everyone need not keep to nonviolence, especially if it were used as a cover for cowardice, saying, "where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence, I would advise violence."&lt;ref name="Borman1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Borman|title=Gandhi and non-violence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U6DE9OUvrTEC&amp;pg=PA253|year=1986|publisher=SUNY Press|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faisal Devji, ''The Impossible Indian: Gandhi and the Temptation of Violence'' (Harvard University Press; 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi came under political fire for his criticism of those who attempted to achieve independence through more violent means.  Gandhi responded,  "There was a time when people listened to me because I showed them how to give fight to the British without arms when they had no arms [...] but today I am told that my non-violence can be of no avail against the [Hindu–Moslem riots] and, therefore, people should arm themselves for self-defense."&lt;ref&gt;reprinted in [https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0394714660/ Louis Fischer, ed. ''The Essential Gandhi: An Anthology of His Writings on His Life, Work, and Ideas''] 2002 (reprint edition) p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi's views came under heavy criticism in Britain when it was under attack from [[Nazi Germany]]. He told the British people in 1940, "I would like you to lay down the arms you have as being useless for saving you or humanity. You will invite Herr Hitler and Signor Mussolini to take what they want of the countries you call your possessions... If these gentlemen choose to occupy your homes, you will vacate them. If they do not give you free passage out, you will allow yourselves, man, woman, and child, to be slaughtered, but you will refuse to owe allegiance to them."&lt;ref name="Wolpert2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley Wolpert|title=Gandhi's passion: the life and legacy of Mahatma Gandhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ih1VCqkUr4gC&amp;pg=PA197|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Challenge of World War I===
[[File:The Deserter.jpg|alt=|thumb|right|''The Deserter'' (1916) by [[Boardman Robinson]].]]
Although the onset of the [[First World War]] was generally greeted with enthusiastic patriotism across Europe, peace groups were still active in condemning the war. Many [[socialism|socialist]] groups and movements were [[antimilitarist]], arguing that war by its nature was a type of governmental coercion of the [[working class]] for the benefit of [[capitalism|capitalist]] elites.

[[File:Peace-Marcher.jpg|thumb|left|200x200px|A World War I-era female peace protester.]]
In 1915 the [[League of Nations Society]] was formed by British [[liberalism|liberal]] leaders to promote a strong international organisation that could enforce the peaceful resolution of conflict. Later that year the [[League to Enforce Peace]] was established in America to promote similar goals. [[Hamilton Holt]] published an editorial in his New York City weekly magazine the ''Independent'' called "The Way to Disarm: A Practical Proposal" on September 28, 1914. It called for an international organization to agree upon the arbitration of disputes and to guarantee the territorial integrity of its members by maintaining military forces sufficient to defeat those of any non-member. The ensuing debate among prominent internationalists modified Holt's plan to align it more closely with proposals offered in Great Britain by [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|Viscount James Bryce]], a former ambassador from the UK to the US.&lt;ref&gt;Herman, 56-7&lt;/ref&gt; These and other initiatives were pivotal in the change in attitudes that gave birth to the [[League of Nations]] after the war.

Some of the many groups that protested against the war, as well as the traditional peace churches, were the [[Woman's Peace Party]] (which was organized in 1915 and led by noted reformer [[Jane Addams]]), the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace (ICWPP) (also organized in 1915),&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.binghamton.edu/womhist/milit/intro.htm Pacifism vs. Patriotism in Women's Organizations in the 1920s] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20021108014655/http://www.binghamton.edu/womhist/milit/intro.htm |date=2002-11-08 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Union Against Militarism]], the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]], and the [[American Friends Service Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5215/is_2002/ai_n19132457/pg_2 Chatfield, Charles, “Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy” 2002].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeannette Rankin]], the first woman elected to Congress, was another fierce advocate of pacifism, the only person to vote no to America's entrance into both World Wars.

===Interwar period===
The immense loss of life during the war, for what became regarded as futile reasons, caused a sea-change in public attitudes to militarism. Organisations formed in this period included the [[War Resisters' International]]&lt;ref&gt;''Radical Pacifism: The War Resisters League and Gandhian Nonviolence in America, 1915–1963'' by Scott H. Bennett. New York, Syracuse  University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8156-3028-X}}, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]], the [[No More War Movement]] and the [[Peace Pledge Union]] (PPU). The [[League of Nations]] also convened several disarmament conferences in the inter-war period such as the [[Geneva Naval Conference|Geneva Conference]].

[[Image:Prats-de-Mollo Children's Home.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Refugees from the Spanish Civil War at the [[War Resisters' International]] children's refuge in the French Pyrenees.]]
Pacifism and revulsion with war were very popular sentiments in 1920s Britain. A stream of novels and poems on the theme of the futility of war and the slaughter of the youth by old fools were published, including, [[Death of a Hero]] by [[Richard Aldington]], [[Erich Remarque]]'s translated [[All Quiet on the Western Front]] and [[Beverley Nichols]]'s expose, ''Cry Havoc''. A debate at the [[University of Oxford]] in 1933 on the motion 'one must fight for King and country' captured the changed mood when the motion was resoundingly defeated. [[Hugh Richard Lawrie Sheppard|Dick Sheppard]] established the [[Peace Pledge Union]] in 1934 totally renouncing war and aggression. The idea of collective security was also popular; instead of outright pacifism the public generally exhibited a determination to stand up to aggression, but preferably with the use of economic sanctions and multilateral negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-1Hom-c5.html|title=Pacifism|publisher=[[University of Wellington]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Spanish Civil War]] proved a major test for international pacifism, and the work of pacifist organisations (such as [[War Resisters' International]] and the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]]) and individuals (such as [[José Brocca]] and [[Amparo Poch y Gascón|Amparo Poch]]). Shortly after the war ended, [[Simone Weil]], despite having volunteered for service on the republican side, went on to publish ''[[The Iliad or the Poem of Force]]'', a work that has been described as a pacifist manifesto.&lt;ref name = "NYB"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.nybooks.com/shop/product?usca_p=t&amp;product_id=4551|title= War and the Iliad|publisher=The New York Review of books|accessdate=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the threat of fascism, some pacifist thinkers, such as [[Richard B. Gregg]], devised plans for a campaign of [[nonviolent resistance]] in the event of a fascist invasion or takeover.&lt;ref&gt;Lynd, Staughton. ''Nonviolence in America: a documentary history'', Bobbs-Merrill, 1966, (pps. 271-296).&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
[[File:Berkeley, California. University of California Student Peace Strike. About half of the students assembled at the... - NARA - 532103.tif|thumb|200px|A peace strike rally at [[University of California]], Berkeley, April 1940.]]
With the start of [[World War II]], pacifist and anti-war sentiment declined in nations affected by war. Even the communist-controlled [[American Peace Mobilization]] reversed its anti-war activism once Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. After the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]], mainstream [[isolationist]] groups like the [[America First Committee]], declined, but many smaller religious and socialist groups continued their opposition to war. [[Bertrand Russell]] argued that the necessity of defeating [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazis]] was a unique circumstance where war was not the worst of the possible evils; he called his position ''relative pacifism''. [[H. G. Wells]], who had joked after the armistice ending [[World War I]] that the British had suffered more from the war than they would have from submission to [[Germany]], urged in 1941 a large-scale British offensive on the continent of Europe to combat Hitler and [[Nazism]].{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} Similarly [[Albert Einstein]] wrote: "I loathe all armies and any kind of violence; yet I'm firmly convinced that at present these hateful weapons offer the only effective protection."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted on [http://www.ppu.org.uk/learn/infodocs/people/pp-einstein2.html Albert Einstein] at Peace Pledge Union, and but also discussed in detail in articles in Einstein, Albert (1954), ''Ideas and Opinions'', New York: Random House, {{ISBN|0-517-00393-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French pacifists [[André and Magda Trocmé]] helped conceal hundreds of Jews fleeing the Nazis in the village
of [[Le Chambon-sur-Lignon]].&lt;ref name="pph"&gt;''Lest Innocent Blood Be Shed: The Story of Le Chambon and How Goodness Happened There'' Philip P. Hallie, (1979)  New York: Harper &amp; Row, {{ISBN|0-06-011701-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brock and Young, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, the Trocmés were declared [[Righteous Among the Nations]].&lt;ref name="pph" /&gt;

Pacifists in the [[Third Reich]] were dealt with harshly; German pacifist [[Carl von Ossietzky]],&lt;ref&gt;Brock and Young, p.99.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Olaf Kullmann]], a Norwegian pacifist active during the Nazi occupation,&lt;ref&gt;Brock and Socknat, pp. 402-3.&lt;/ref&gt; were both imprisoned in concentration camps and died as a result of their mistreatment there. Austrian farmer [[Franz Jägerstätter]] was executed in 1943 for refusing to serve in the [[Wehrmacht]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[In Solitary Witness: The Life and Death of Franz Jägerstätter]]'' by [[Gordon Zahn]]. Springfield, Illinois: Templegate Publishers. {{ISBN|0-87243-141-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were [[conscientious objectors]] and war [[tax resisters]] in both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].  The United States government allowed sincere objectors to serve in noncombatant military roles. However, those [[draft dodgers|draft resisters]] who refused any cooperation with the war effort often spent much of each war in federal prisons. During World War II, pacifist leaders like [[Dorothy Day]] and [[Ammon Hennacy]] of the [[Catholic Worker Movement]] urged young Americans not to enlist in military service.

Since World War II, the peace movement has become widespread throughout the world, and its previously radical doctrines are now a part of mainstream political discourse.

===Anti-nuclear movement===
{{See also|History of the anti-nuclear movement|Anti-nuclear movement}}
[[Image:Operation Upshot-Knothole - Badger 001.jpg|thumb|A nuclear fireball lights up the night in a United States [[nuclear weapons test]].]]
Peace movements emerged in Japan and in 1954 they converged to form a unified "Japanese Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs". Japanese opposition to the Pacific nuclear weapons tests was widespread, and "an estimated 35 million signatures were collected on petitions calling for bans on nuclear weapons".&lt;ref name=falkj&gt;Jim Falk (1982). ''Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', Oxford University Press, pp. 96-97.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] held an inaugural public meeting at [[Central Hall, Westminster]], on 17 February 1958, attended by five thousand people. After the meeting a few hundred left to demonstrate at [[Downing Street]].&lt;ref name=Minnion&gt;John Minnion and Philip Bolsover (eds.) ''The CND Story'', Alison and Busby, 1983, {{ISBN|0-85031-487-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PREcnd.htm |title=Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) |publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514024607/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PREcnd.htm |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CND's declared policies were the unconditional renunciation of the use, production of or dependence upon nuclear weapons by Britain and the bringing about of a general disarmament convention.  In the meantime, Britain should halt the flight of planes armed with nuclear weapons, end nuclear testing, not proceed with missile bases and not provide nuclear weapons to any other country.

The first [[Aldermaston Marches|Aldermaston March]] was organised by the CND and took place at [[Easter]] 1958, when several thousand people marched for four days from [[Trafalgar Square]], London, to the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment|Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] close to [[Aldermaston]] in [[Berkshire]], England, to demonstrate their opposition to nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=CND&gt;[http://www.cnduk.org/pages/binfo/hist.html A brief history of CND]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianUnlimited:1958&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[Guardian Unlimited]] | title = Early defections in march to Aldermaston | date = 1958-04-05 | url = http://century.guardian.co.uk/1950-1959/Story/0,,105488,00.html | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aldermaston marches continued into the late 1960s when tens of thousands of people took part in the four-day marches.&lt;ref name=falkj/&gt; 
The formation of [[CND]] tapped widespread popular fear and opposition to nuclear weapons following the development of the first [[hydrogen bomb]], and in the late 1950s and early 1960s anti-nuclear marches attracted large followings, especially to the annual Aldermaston march at Easter.

Popular opposition to nuclear weapons produced a Labour Party resolution for unilateral nuclear disarmament at the 1960 Party Conference, but it was overturned the following year and did not appear on later agendas. This experience disillusioned many anti-nuclear protesters with the Labour Party, in whom they had previously put their hopes. Subsequently, there was a strong anti-parliamentary current in the British peace movement, and it has been argued that during the 1960s anarchism became as influential as socialism.

Two years after the formation of CND [[Bertrand Russell]], its president, resigned to form the Committee of 100, which was to undertake civil disobedience in the form of sit-down demonstrations in central London and at nuclear bases around the UK. Russell said that these were needed because the press had grown indifferent to CND and because large-scale direct action could force the government to change its policy.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell, "Civil Disobedience", ''New Statesman'', 17 February 1961&lt;/ref&gt; A hundred prominent people, many in the arts, put their names to the organisation. Very large numbers of demonstrators were essential to this strategy, but the violence of the police, the arrest and imprisonment of demonstrators, and pre-emptive arrests for conspiracy made support dwindle rapidly. Although several eminent people took part in sit-down demonstrations (including Russell, whose imprisonment at the age of 89 was widely reported) many of the 100 signatories were inactive.&lt;ref&gt;Frank E. Myers, "Civil Disobedience and Organizational Change: The British Committee of 100", ''Political Science Quarterly'', Vol. 86, No. 1. (Mar., 1971), pp. 92–112&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Committee of 100 had a non-hierarchical structure and no formal membership, many local groups sprang up calling themselves [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)|Committee of 100]]. This helped the promulgation of civil disobedience but it produced policy confusion and, as the decade progressed, Committee of 100 groups engaged in actions on many social issues not directly related to war and peace.

In the United States, in 1961, at the height of the [[Cold War]], about 50,000 women brought together by [[Women Strike for Peace]] marched in 60 cities in the United States to demonstrate against [[nuclear weapons]].

===Vietnam War Protests===
{{Main|Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War}}
[[File:Vietnam War protestors at the March on the Pentagon.jpg|thumb|right|Protests against the Vietnam War in Washington, D.C., on October 21, 1967]]
The peace movement began in the 1960s in the United States in opposition to U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]]. Some advocates within this movement advocated a unilateral withdrawal of U.S. forces from [[South Vietnam]].

The first U.S. anti-Vietnam protest was led in 1962 by [[Sam Marcy]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} founder of [[Workers World Party]], a demonstration whose importance was noted by [[Ho Chi Minh]] in an interview published in the [[National Guardian]] newspaper.

[[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|Opposition to the Vietnam War]] tended to unite groups opposed to U.S. anti-communism, [[imperialism]] and [[colonialism]] and, for those involved with the [[New Left]], [[capitalism]] itself, such as the [[Catholic Worker Movement]]. Others, such as [[Stephen Spiro]] opposed the war based on the theory of [[Just War]].

In 1965 the movement began to gain national prominence. Provocative actions by police and by protesters turned anti-war demonstrations in Chicago at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] into a riot. Explosive news reports of American [[military abuses]], such as the 1968 [[My Lai Massacre]], brought new attention and support to the anti-war movement bringing it to its height. The movement continued to prosper over the span of the conflict.

High-profile opposition to the Vietnam war turned to street protests in an effort to turn U.S. political opinion against the war. The protests gained momentum from the [[Civil Rights Movement]] that had organized to oppose [[Racial segregation|segregation]] laws, which had laid a foundation of theory and infrastructure on which the anti-war movement grew. Protests were fueled by a growing network of independently published newspapers (known as "underground papers") and the timely advent of large venue rock'n'roll festivals such as [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]] and [[Grateful Dead]] shows, attracting younger people in search of generational togetherness. The movement progressed from college campuses to middle-class suburbs, government institutions, and [[labor unions]].

==Peace movements by country==
[[File:Peace &amp; Love Rally 2015 Stockholm (5).JPG|thumb|'''Sweden:''' [[Stockholm]]'s ''Peace and Love Rally'' through the south side of the city drew hundreds of marchers and celebrants in May 2015]]

===Canada===
[[Agnes Macphail]], a Canadian pacifist, was the first woman to be elected to the [[House of Commons of Canada]]. Macphail objected to the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in 1931 on pacific grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Preston `Canada`s RMC: A History of the Royal Military College` (University of Toronto Press, Toronto, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; Macphail was also the first Canadian woman delegate to the League of Nations, where she worked with the World Disarmament Committee. Although a pacifist, she voted for Canada to enter [[World War II]].

The [[Canadian Peace Congress]] (1949–1990) was a leading organizer in the peace movement for many years, particularly when it was under the leadership of [[James Gareth Endicott]] who was its president until 1971.

Currently, Canada has a diverse peace movement, with coalitions and networks in many cities, towns and regions. The largest cross-country umbrella coalition is the [[Canadian Peace Alliance]], whose 140 member groups include large city-based coalitions, small grassroots groups, national and local unions, faith, environmental, and student groups, with a combined membership of over 4 million Canadians. The Canadian Peace Alliance has been a leading voice, along with its member groups opposing the "War on Terror". In particular, the CPA opposes Canada's participation in the war in Afghanistan and Canadian complicity in what it views as misguided and destructive U.S. foreign policy.

Canada has also been home to a growing movement of Palestinian solidarity, marked by an increasing number of grassroots Jewish groups opposed to Israel's policies, in many cases likening them to Apartheid, war crimes, and ethnic cleansing.

===Germany===
During the Cold War (1947–89), the West German peace movement concentrated on  the abolition of nuclear technology, particularly weapons, from [[West Germany]] and Europe. Most activists stridently attacked both the United States and Soviet Union. Conservative critics repeatedly warned it was infiltrated by agents from the East German secret police, the [[Stasi]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilfried von Bredow, "The Peace Movement in the Federal Republic of Germany," ''Armed Forces &amp; Society'' (1982) 9#1 pp 33-48&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1989, the cause of peace was espoused by [[Green parties]] across Europe.  It sometimes exercised significant influence over policy, e.g., as during 2002 when the [[German Greens]] influenced German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] to oppose involvement in Iraq. The Greens controlled of the German Foreign Ministry under [[Joschka Fischer]] (a Green and the single most popular politician in Germany at the time). Fischer sought to limit German involvement in the [[War on Terrorism]]; he joined with French President [[Jacques Chirac]] whose opposition in the [[UN Security Council]] was decisive in limiting support for the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S. plan to invade Iraq]].

===Israel===
{{refimprove section|date=May 2017}}
{{Main|Projects working for peace among Arabs and Israelis}}
The [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] and [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] have existed since the inception of [[Zionism]], and especially since the 1948 formation of the state of [[Israel]], and the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. The mainstream peace movement in Israel is [[Peace Now]] (''Shalom Akhshav''), whose supporters tend to vote for the [[Labor Party (Israel)|Labour Party]] or [[Meretz]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[Peace Now]] was founded in the aftermath of Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]]'s historic visit to Jerusalem, when many people felt that the chance for peace might be missed. PM Begin acknowledged that the Peace Now rally in Tel Aviv at the eve of his departure for the [[Camp David]] Summit with Presidents Sadat and Carter—drawing a crowd of 100,000, the largest peace rally in Israel until then—had a part in his decision to withdraw from Sinai and dismantle Israeli settlements there. Peace Now supported Begin for a time, and hailed him as a peace-maker, but turned against him when withdrawal from Sinai was accompanied by an accelerated campaign of land confiscation and settlement building in the West Bank.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[File:settlements map eng.pdf|thumb|A map showing settlements in the [[West Bank]], produced by Peace Now.]]
Peace Now advocates a negotiated peace with the [[Palestinians]]. Originally this was worded vaguely, with no definition of who "the Palestinians" are and who represents them. Peace Now was quite tardy in joining the dialogue with the PLO, started by such groups as the Israeli Council for Israeli-Palestinian Peace and the [[Hadash]] communist party. Only in 1988 did Peace Now accept that the PLO is the body regarded by the Palestinians themselves as their representative.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

During the first Intifada, Peace Now held numerous protests and rallies to protest the Israeli army and call for a negotiated withdrawal from the [[Palestinian territories]]. At the time Peace Now strongly targeted then for Defence Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] for his order to "break the bones of Palestinian stone-throwers". However, after Rabin became Prime Minister, signed the [[Oslo Agreement]] and shook [[Yasser Arafat]]'s hand on the White House lawn, Peace Now strongly supported him and mobilized public support for him. Peace Now had a central role in the November 4, 1995 rally after which Rabin was assassinated.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Since then the annual Rabin memorial rallies, held every year at the beginning of November, have become the main event of the Israeli Peace Movement. While officially organized by the Rabin Family Foundation, Peace Now presence in these annual rallies is always conspicuous.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Nowadays, Peace Now is especially known for its struggle against the expansion of settlement outposts on the West Bank.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[Gush Shalom]], the Israeli Peace Bloc, is a radical movement to the left of Peace Now. In its present name and structure, Gush Shalom grew out of the ''Jewish-Arab Committee Against Deportations'', which protested the deportation without trial of 415 Palestinian Islamic activists to Lebanon in December 1992, and erected a protest tent in front of the prime minister's office in Jerusalem for two months—until the government consented to let the deportees return. Members then decided to continue as a general peace movement with a program strongly opposing the occupation and advocating the creation of an independent Palestine side-by-side with Israel in its pre-1967 borders ("The [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]]") and with an undivided Jerusalem serving as the capital of both states.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

While existing under the name Gush Shalom only since 1992, this movement is in fact the lineal descendant of various groups, movements and action committees that espoused much the same program since 1967, and that occupied the same space on the political scene. In particular, Gush Shalom is the descendant of the ''Israeli Council for Israeli-Palestinian Peace'' (ICIPP), which was founded in 1975. The ICIPP founders included: a group of dissidents from the Israeli establishment, among them were Major-General [[Mattityahu Peled]], who was member of the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] General Staff during the 1967 Six Day War and after being dishcarged from the army in 1969 turned increasingly in the direction of the left; Dr. [[Ya'akov Arnon]], a well-known economist who headed the Zionist Federation in the Netherlands before coming to Israel in 1948, and was for many years director-general of the Israeli Ministry of Finance and afterwards chaired the Board of Directors of the Israeli Electricity Company; and [[Aryeh Eliav]], who was secretary-general of the [[Labor Party (Israel)|Labour Party]] until he broke with the then PM [[Golda Meir]] over the issue of whether or not a Palestinian People existed and had national rights.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

These three and some two hundred more people became radicalised and came to the conclusion that "arrogance was a threat to Israel's future and that dialogue with the Palestinians must be opened."{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} They came together with a group of younger, grassroots peace activists who had been active against Israeli occupation since 1967. The bridge between the two groups was [[Uri Avnery]], a well known muckraking journalist who had been member of the [[Knesset]] (Israeli Parliament) between 1965 and 1973, at the head of his own radical one-man party.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The main achievement of the ICIPP was the opening of dialogue with the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO), with the aim of convincing the Israelis of the need to talk and reach a peace deal with the Palestinians, and conversely making Palestinians aware of the need to talk to and eventually reach a deal with Israel.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

At present, Gush Shalom activists are mainly involved in daily struggle at Palestinian villages that have their land confiscated by the [[West Bank barrier]], erected to stop suicide bombers. Gush activists are to be found, together with those of other Israeli movements like [[Ta'ayush]] and [[Anarchists Against the Wall]], joining the Palestinian villagers of [[Bil'in]] in the weekly protest marches held to protest confiscation of more than half of the village lands.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Although [[Gush Shalom]] earned itself respect among peace-seeking Israelis as well as in the [[United States]] and Europe, it is regarded by mainstream Israelis as a purely pro-Palestinian movement.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

After the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict|Gaza War]] in 2014, a group of Israeli women founded the [[Women Wage Peace]] movement with the goal of reaching a "bilaterally acceptable" political peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://womenwagepeace.org.il/en/mission-statement/|title=Mission Statement {{!}} Women Wage Peace|work=Women Wage Peace|access-date=2017-07-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; While based mainly in Israel, the movement has worked to build connections with Palestinians, reaching out to women and men of many different religions and political backgrounds.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/these-israeli-women-marched-from-the-lebanese-border-to-jerusalem-heres-why/2016/10/19/a9b67618-b92c-4c7a-9ad8-d992477e7db1_story.html|title=These Israeli women marched from the Lebanese border to Jerusalem.

===United Kingdom===
From 1934 the [[Peace Pledge Union]] gained many adherents to its pledge, "I renounce war and will never support or sanction another." Its support diminished considerably with the outbreak of war in 1939, but it remained the focus of pacifism in the post-war years.

Post–World War II peace-movement efforts in the United Kingdom were initially focused on the dissolution of the [[British Empire]] and the rejection of [[imperialism]] by the United States and [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]]. The [[anti-nuclear movement]] sought to "opt out" of the [[Cold War]] and rejected such ideas as "Britain's Little Independent Nuclear Deterrent" in part on the grounds that it (BLIND) was in contradiction even with MAD.

The VSC ([[Vietnam Solidarity Campaign]]) led by [[Tariq Ali]] mounted several very large and violent demonstrations against the Vietnam war in 67/68 but the first anti Vietnam demonstration was at the American Embassy in London and took place in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;''Comment Magazine''.

[[File:Not-in-my-name banner, Stop The War demo.JPG|thumb|left|StWC Placard]]
The peace movement was later associated with the [[Peace camp]] movement as [[British Labour party|Labour]] moved "more to the centre" under Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]. By early 2003, the peace and anti-war movement, mostly grouped together under the banner of the [[Stop the War Coalition]], was powerful enough to cause several of Blair's cabinet to resign, and hundreds of Labour Party MPs to vote against their government. Blair's motion to support militarily the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S. plan to invade Iraq]] continued only due to support from the [[Conservative Party (UK)|UK Conservative Party]]. [[Protests against the 2003 Iraq war|Protests against the invasion of Iraq]] were particularly vocal in Britain. Polls suggested that without [[UN Security Council]] approval, the UK public was very much opposed to involvement, and over two million people protested in Hyde Park (the previous largest demonstration in the UK having had around 600,000).

The peace movement has seen 'pop-up' newspapers, pirate radio stations and plays over the years. 

The primary function of the National Peace Congress was to provide opportunities for consultation and joint activities between its affiliated members, to help create an informed public opinion on the issues of the day and to convey to the government of the day the views of the substantial section of British life represented by its affiliated membership. The NPC folded in 2000 to be replaced in 2001 by [[Network for Peace]], which was set up to continue the networking role of NPC.

During the tail end of the [[Cold War]], U.S. peace activists largely concentrated on slowing the [[Nuclear arms race|superpower arms race]] in the belief that this would reduce the possibility of nuclear war between the U.S. and the USSR. As the [[Reagan administration]] accelerated military spending and adopted a tough, challenging stance to the Russians, peace groups such as the [[Nuclear Freeze]] and Beyond War sought to educate the public on what they believed was the inherent riskiness and ruinous cost of this policy. Outreach to individual citizens in the Soviet Union and mass meetings, using then-new satellite link technology, were part of peacemaking activities in the 1980s. In 1981, [[Thomas (activist)|Thomas]] started the longest uninterrupted peace [[vigil]] in U.S. history.&lt;ref name=ColmanMcCarthy&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/07/AR2009020701843.html|title=From Lafayette Square Lookout, He Made His War Protest Permanent|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=February 8, 2009|author=[[Colman McCarthy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later joined at [[President's Park#Lafayette Square|Lafayette Square]] by anti-nuclear activists [[Concepcion Picciotto]] and [[Ellen Thomas]].&lt;ref name=Oracles&gt;[https://archive.is/20120710053132/http://aje.me/HHwQcE The Oracles of Pennsylvania Avenue]&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Iraq's invasion of [[Kuwait]] in 1990, President [[George H. W. Bush]] began preparations for a mideast war. Peace activists were starting to find their groove just before the [[Gulf War]] was launched in February 1991, with well-attended rallies, especially on the west coast. However, the ground war was over in less than a week. A lopsided Allied victory and a media-incited wave of patriotic sentiment washed over the protest movement before it could develop traction.

During the 1990s, peacemakers' priorities included seeking a solution to the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israeli–Palestinian impasse]], belated efforts at humanitarian assistance to war-torn regions such as Bosnia and Rwanda, and Iraq; American peace activists brought medicine into Iraq in defiance of U.S. law, in some cases enduring heavy fines and imprisonment in retaliation. Some of the principal groups involved were [[Voices in the Wilderness]] and the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]].

[[Image:NYC021503.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Protesters against the [[Iraq War]] in New York.]]
Before, during, and after the [[War in Iraq]] began, a concerted protest effort began in the United States. On [[February 15, 2003 anti-war protest|February 15, 2003]] a series of protests across the globe took place with events in approximately 800 cities. In March 2003, just before the U.S. and British Military led invasion of Iraq, a protest mobilization called "The World Says No to War" led to as many as 500,000 protestors in cities across the U.S. However, many protest organizations have persisted as the United States has maintained a military and corporate presence in Iraq.

U.S. activist groups including [[United for Peace and Justice]], [[Code Pink]] (Women Say No To War), [[Iraq Veterans Against the War]], [[Military Families Speak Out]] (MFSO), [[Not In Our Name]], [[A.N.S.W.E.R.]], [[Veterans for Peace]], and [[The World Can't Wait]] continued to protest against the [[Iraq War]]. Methods of protest include rallies and marches, impeachment petitions, the staging of a war-crimes tribunal in New York (to investigate crimes and alleged abuses of power of the Bush administration), bringing Iraqi women to tour the U.S. and tell their side of the story, street theater and independent filmmaking, high-profile appearances by anti-war activists such as [[Scott Ritter]], [[Janis Karpinski]], and [[Dahr Jamail]], resisting military recruiting on college campuses, withholding tax monies, mass letter-writing to legislators and newspapers, blogging, music, and guerrilla theater. Independent media producers continue to broadcast, podcast and Web-host programs about the movement against the Iraq War.

Starting in 2005, [[opposition to military action against Iran]] started in the United States, the United Kingdom and elsewhere, including the creation of the [[Campaign Against Sanctions and Military Intervention in Iran]]. By August 2007, fears of an imminent United States and/or [[Israel]]i attack on [[Iran]] had increased to the level that several [[Nobel Prize]] winners, [[Shirin Ebadi]] (Nobel Peace Prize 2003), [[Mairead Corrigan|Mairead Corrigan-Maguire]] and [[Betty Williams (Nobel laureate)|Betty Williams]] (joint Nobel Peace Prize 1976), [[Harold Pinter]] (Nobel Prize for Literature 2005) and [[Jody Williams]] (Nobel Peace Prize 1997), along with several [[anti-war]] groups, including The Israeli Committee for a Middle East Free from Atomic, Biological and Chemical Weapons, [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], [[Campaign Against Sanctions and Military Intervention in Iran|CASMII]], [[Code Pink]] and many others, warned about what they believed was the imminent risk of a "war of an unprecedented scale, this time against Iran", especially expressing concern that an attack on Iran using [[nuclear weapon]]s had "not been ruled out". They called for "the dispute about [[Iran's nuclear program]], to be resolved through peaceful means" and a call for [[Israel]], "as the only Middle Eastern state [[Israel and weapons of mass destruction|suspected of possession of nuclear weapons]]", to join the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]].&lt;ref name="ebadi_etal_nucfree_mideast"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =For a Middle East free of all Weapons of Mass Destruction | work =| publisher =[[Campaign Against Sanctions and Military Intervention in Iran]]| date = 2007-08-06| url =http://www.campaigniran.org/casmii/index.php?q=node/2694 |format =| doi =| accessdate = 2007-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philo-Semitism''' (also spelled '''philosemitism''') or '''Judeophilia''' is an interest in, respect for and an appreciation of [[Jews|Jewish people]], [[Jewish history|their history]] and the influence of [[Judaism]], particularly on the part of a [[gentile]].

Within the Jewish community, philo-Semitism includes an interest in [[Jewish culture]] and a love of things considered Jewish.

==Overview==
The concept of philo-Semitism is not new, and it was arguably avowed by such thinkers as the 19th-century philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who described himself as an "anti-anti-Semite,"&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Christianity'', Volume 4 by Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley&lt;/ref&gt; though he also criticized the Jewish people for their historical role in forming modern morality.&lt;ref&gt; "The Genealogy of Morals", Part I, Section 16, tr. Walter Kaufmann&lt;/ref&gt;  Enjoying a recent surge, it is characterized by an interest in [[Jewish culture]] and [[Jewish history|history]] and it is also manifested in increasing university enrollment by non-Jews in courses such as [[Judaism]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and [[Jewish languages]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Philo-Semitism has been met by a mixed response from the Jewish community. Some warmly welcome it and argue that it must lead Jews to reconsider their identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forward.com ''The Forward''], (Editorial, 10 November 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Others, {{Who|date=November 2009}} citing the special status that it implicitly gives to Jews even as its apparent opposite [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] does, reject it as running contrary to the [[Zionism|Zionist]] goal of making Jewry "a nation among nations."{{cn|date=November 2017}}

Philo-Semitism is an expression of the larger phenomenon of [[allophilia]], admiration for foreign cultures as embodied in the more widely known [[Anglophilia]] and [[Francophilia]]. The rise of philo-Semitism has also prompted some{{who|date=November 2017}} to reconsider Jewish history, and they argue that while anti-Semitism must be acknowledged, it is wrong to reduce the history of the Jewish people to one merely of suffering (as has been fostered by well-meaning gentile philo-Semites).{{cn|date=November 2017}}

Even though a non-Jew is not required to convert to Judaism or may even be advised against doing so, [[Halakha]] (Jewish [[religious law]]) does require all non-Jews to abide by certain commandments. These are the [[Seven Laws of Noah]], and gentiles who accept the Seven Laws in their traditional interpretation identify themselves as [[Noahide]]s.
[[Image:Wojciech Gerson, Przyjęcie Żydów.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Wojciech Gerson]], ''Casimir the Great and the Jews'']]
From history, one notable example of philo-Semitism is [[Casimir III the Great#Relationship with Polish Jews|that of]] the Polish king [[Casimir III the Great]]. While the [[Jewish emancipation]] wouldn't begin in other countries until towards the end of the 1700s, in Poland Jews had been granted the freedom of worship, trade and travel in 1264 by [[Bolesław the Pious]]. In 1334 Jews persecuted across Europe were invited to Poland by Casimir the Great, who, in particular, vowed to protect them as "people of the king".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Poland, a Jewish Revival Thrives—Minus Jews|quote=Probably about 70 percent of the world's European Jews, or Ashkenazi, can trace their ancestry to Poland—thanks to a 14th-century king, Casimir III, the Great, who drew Jewish settlers from across Europe with his vow to protect them as "people of the king",|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=12 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 15th century more than half of all [[diaspora Jews]] were living in Poland, which kept its status as the main center of [[Ashkenazi Jewry]] until the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="Ashkenazim"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Ashkenazim.html|title=Ashkenazim|first=Shira|last=Schoenberg|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=24 May 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060427032733/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Ashkenazim.html| archivedate= 27 April 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very few Jews live in [[East Asia]]n countries, but Jews are viewed in an especially positive light in some of them, partly owing to their shared wartime experiences during the [[Second World War]]. Examples include  [[South Korea]]&lt;ref name="Korea"&gt;Alper, Tim. "[http://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-features/48771/why-south-koreans-are-love-judaism Why South Koreans are in love with Judaism]". ''The Jewish Chronicle''. May 12, 2011. Retrieved February 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;Nagler-Cohen, Liron. "[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4216893,00.html Chinese: 'Jews make money']". ''Ynetnews''. April 23, 2012. Retrieved February 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Jews are positively stereotyped as intelligent, business savvy and committed to family values and responsibility, while in the Western world, the first of the two aforementioned stereotypes more often have the negatively interpreted equivalents of guile and greed. In South Korean primary schools the [[Talmud]] is mandatory reading.&lt;ref name="Korea"/&gt; During World War II, Japan [[History of the Jews in Japan|made efforts]] to help Jews escape their demise at the hands of the Nazis, despite the fact that the country was then a member of the [[Axis powers|Axis alliance]]. The Japanese diplomat [[Chiune Sugihara]] facilitated the escape of more than 6,000 [[Jewish refugees]] to Japanese territory, risking his career and the lives of his family members; in 1985, he was honored by the [[State of Israel]] as [[Righteous Among the Nations]].  Annual surveys of a large number of countries conducted by the ADL have consistently shown very low levels of anti-Semitism in [[Southeast Asia]], persisting only at [[permyriad]] levels (hundredths of a per cent, i.e. 0.02 per cent in 2014) in [[Laos]].  These surveys, others, and polling and analysis about Israel have shown that [[India]] has low levels of anti-Semitism and relatively strong support for [[ADL 2014 Annual Report|Israel]], at the 55-65 per cent level, now surpassing the United States in the last respect.

The American singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] once called herself an "ambassador for Judaism"—during a meeting with Prime Minister of Israel [[Shimon Peres]], where they exchanged gifts, Madonna giving him a volume of the [[Zohar]] inscribed "To Shimon Peres, the man I admire and love, Madonna".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Madonna Says She's an 'Ambassador for Judaism' |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/09/16/madonna-says-ambassador-for-judaism/ |newspaper=The New York Sun |location= |publisher=Associated Press |date=September 17, 2007 |accessdate=February 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although she herself does not practice Judaism, she has studied [[Kabbalah]], given her son a [[bar mitzva]] celebration and taken a Hebrew name: [[Esther]] (אסתר).

The controversial term "philosemitism" arose as a pejorative in [[Germany]] to describe positive prejudice towards Jews, in other words a philosemite is a "Jew-lover" or "Jew-friend".&lt;ref&gt;[https://newrepublic.com/book/review/philosemitism-history-sutcliffe-karp/ ''With Friends Like These''] Review of ''Philosemitism in History'' in the New Republic by Adam Karp&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Rights |By claimant}}

'''Plant rights''' are [[rights]] to which [[plant]]s may be entitled. Such issues are often raised in connection with discussions about [[human rights]], [[animal rights]], [[Biocentrism (ethics)|biocentrism]], or [[sentiocentrism]].

==Philosophy==
[[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Erewhon]]'' contains a chapter, "The Views of an Erewhonian Philosopher Concerning the Rights of Vegetables".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-ButErew-ButErew-c27.html|chapter=The Views of an Erewhonian Philosopher Concerning the Rights of Vegetables|title=Erewhon|author=Butler, Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the question of whether animal rights can be extended to plants, animal rights philosopher [[Tom Regan]] argues that animals acquire rights due to being aware, what he calls "subjects-of-a-life". He argues that this does not apply to plants, and that even if plants did have rights, abstaining from eating meat would still be moral due to the use of plants to rear animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Regan|first=Tom|title=Animal rights, human wrongs: an introduction to moral philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AmBksH1k2RMC&amp;pg=PA101|year=2003|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=0-7425-3354-9|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to philosopher [[Michael Marder]], the idea that plants should have rights derives from "plant subjectivity", which is distinct from human personhood.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/01/2013120141156284755.html&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Paul Taylor (philosopher)|Paul Taylor]] holds that all life has [[inherent worth]] and argues for respect for plants, but does not assign them rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vesilind|first1=P.

Stone, the son of [[investigative journalism|investigative journalist]] [[I.&amp;nbsp;F.&amp;nbsp;Stone]], proposed in a 1972 paper titled "Should Trees Have Standing?" that if corporations are assigned rights, so should natural objects such as trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stone|first=Christopher D.|title=Should Trees Have Standing? Law, Morality, and the Environment|edition=Third|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-973607-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stone|first=Christopher D.|year=1972|title=Should Trees Have Standing--Toward Legal Rights for Natural Objects|journal=Southern California Law Review|volume=45|pages=450–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- If you feel that this paragraph should be deleted, please explain why on the article talk page. --&gt;Whilst not appealing directly to "rights", Matthew Hall has argued that plants should be included within the realm of human moral consideration. His "Plants as Persons: A Philosophical Botany" discusses the moral background of plants in western philosophy and contrasts this with other traditions, including indigenous cultures, which recognise plants as persons—active, intelligent beings that are appropriate recipients of respect and care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Matthew|title=Plants as Persons: A Philosophical Botany|year=2011|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=1-4384-3428-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hall backs up his call for the ethical consideration of plants with arguments based on [[plant neurobiology]], which says that plants are autonomous, perceptive organisms capable of complex, adaptive behaviours, including the recognition of self/non-self.

==Scientific arguments==
In the study of [[plant physiology]], plants are understood to have mechanisms by which they recognize environmental changes. This definition of [[Plant perception (physiology)|plant perception]] differs from the notion that plants are capable of feeling emotions, an idea also called [[plant perception (paranormal)|plant perception]]. The latter concept, along with [[plant intelligence]], can be traced to 1848, when [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]], a German [[experimental psychologist]], suggested that plants are capable of [[emotion]]s, and that one could promote healthy growth with talk, attention, and affection.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Heidelberger ''Nature from within: Gustav Theodor Fechner and his psychophysical worldview'' 2004, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Swiss Federal Ethics Committee on Non-Human Biotechnology analyzed scientific data on plants, and concluded in 2009 that plants are entitled to a certain amount of "dignity", but "dignity of plants is not an absolute value."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The dignity of plants|journal=Plant Signaling &amp; Behavior|first=Florianne|last=Koechlin|date=January 2009|volume=4|issue=1|pages=78–79|doi=10.4161/psb.4.1.7315|pmid=19568336|pmc=2634081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The single-issue Party for Plants entered candidates in the 2010 parliamentary election in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/idINTRE62S2HA20100329|title=Plant rights party to contest next Dutch election|date=March 29, 2010|accessdate=August 7, 2010|publisher=Reuters|first=Ben|last=Berkowitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; It focuses on topics such as climate, biodiversity and sustainability in general. Such concerns have been criticized as evidence that modern culture is "causing us to lose the ability to think critically and distinguish serious from frivolous ethical concerns".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Silent Scream of the Asparagus|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/015/065njdoe.asp|author=Smith, Wesley J.|date=May 12, 2008|volume=13|issue=33|publisher=Weekly Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Legal arguments==
[[File:Justice William O Douglas.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Justice [[William O. Douglas]], author of a noted dissent about the legal standing of plants]]
In his dissent to the 1972 ''[[Sierra Club v. Morton]]'' decision by the [[United States Supreme Court]], Justice [[William O. Douglas]] wrote about whether plants might have [[standing (law)|legal standing]]:
{{quote|Inanimate objects are sometimes parties in litigation. A ship has a legal personality, a fiction found useful for maritime purposes... So it should be as respects valleys, alpine meadows, rivers, lakes, estuaries, beaches, ridges, groves of trees, swampland, or even air that feels the destructive pressures of modern technology and modern life...The voice of the inanimate object, therefore, should not be stilled.}}

The [[Swiss Constitution]] contains a provision requiring "account to be taken of the dignity of creation when handling animals, plants and other organisms", and the [[Swiss government]] has conducted ethical studies pertaining to how the dignity of plants is to be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The dignity of plants|pmc=2634081|author=Florianne Koechlin|publisher=Plant Signal Behav.|date=January 2009|volume=4|issue=1|pages=78–79|pmid=19568336|doi=10.4161/psb.4.1.7315}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2012, a river in New Zealand, including the plants and other organisms contained within its boundaries, was legally declared a person with standing (via guardians) to bring legal actions to protect its interests.&lt;ref&gt;Vines T, Bruce A Faunce TA.

==Popular arguments==
When challenged by [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] to become [[vegetarian]], [[Timothy McVeigh]] argued that "plants are alive too, they react to stimuli (including pain); have circulation systems, etc".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.furcommission.com/news/newsF02x.htm|title=McVeigh to PeTA: "Where Do You Draw the Line?"|publisher=Fur Commission|date=May 7, 2001|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922060922/http://furcommission.com/news/newsF02x.htm|archivedate=September 22, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/71380695.html?dids=71380695:71380695&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+17%2C+2001&amp;author=Lloyd+Grove+Washington+Post+Staff+Writer&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=The+Reliable+Source&amp;pqatl=google|title=The Reliable Source|publisher=Washington Post|first=Lloyd|last=Grove|authorlink=Lloyd Grove|page=C3|date=April 17, 2001|accessdate=August 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Animal Liberation Front]] argues that there is no evidence that plants can experience pain, and that to the extent they respond to stimuli, it is like a device such as a [[thermostat]] responding to sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.animalliberationfront.com/Philosophy/Morality/Biology/InsectAR.htm#faq42|chapter=Isn't it hypocritical to kill and eat plants?|title=FAQs Insects, Plants|publisher=Animal Liberation Front}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of '''formats''' used in various levels of competition in [[sport]]s and [[game]]s to determine an overall champion. Some of the most common are the ''single elimination'', the ''best-of-'' series, the ''total points series'' more commonly known as ''on aggregate'', and the ''[[round-robin tournament]]''.

==Single elimination==
{{Main article|Single-elimination tournament}}
{{see also|Shaughnessy playoff system}}
A '''[[Single-elimination tournament|Single elimination]]''' ("knockout") playoff pits the participants in one-game matches, with the loser being dropped from the competition. Single elimination tournaments are much more common in individual sports like [[tennis]]. In most tennis tournaments, the players are [[Seed (sports)|seeded]] against each other, and the winner of each match continues to the next round, all the way to the final.

Of the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|big four American sports leagues]], only the [[National Football League]] uses this system for all rounds of its postseason. This works for the NFL because its regular seasons are much shorter (16 games) than those in the other sports (from 82 to 162 games), and the difference in quality between teams is believed to be more quickly discernible. The rigors of individual games, held only once per week, also preclude the possibility of longer playoff series. Since the 1990 season six teams are seeded from each conference, with the top two getting a first-round "bye". The remaining teams pair off, with the higher-seeded team hosting. The winners of those games then play the higher-seeded teams that received byes in elimination playoffs, and then the winners of those matches face each in another in elimination playoffs to determine who will represent each conference in the [[Super Bowl]]. The winner of that game wins the championship.

Until the late 1960s, the only regular post-season fixtures in U.S. professional football were the league Championship Games. Divisional playoffs were only held in the event of a tie in the division standings. Divisional playoffs as a regularly scheduled event were not introduced in the NFL and rival [[American Football League]] until the seasons immediately preceding the [[AFL-NFL merger]] in 1970.

Like the NFL, the [[Canadian Football League]] also uses one game playoffs, and has used them almost exclusively since the 1973 season. In the CFL, six teams qualify for the playoffs, divided into two divisional brackets of three teams each. The second place teams in each division host the Division Semi-Final, while the division winners each receive a bye to the Division Final. The Division Final winners play in the [[Grey Cup]]. Unlike the NFL, divisional playoffs have been a regular fixture in professional Canadian football since the 1930s. The main rationale for their introduction was that Canadian football clubs were (and, to a considerable extent, still are) more heavily dependent on a steady stream of gate receipts compared to their NFL counterparts, largely due to their playing in relatively small markets and smaller stadiums compared to NFL teams. A more inclusive playoff structure was therefore seen as necessary to ensure as many games as possible up to the end of the season were "meaningful" so as to encourage fans to attend games.

The only exception to a strict single-elimination format since the early 1970s was in 1986 when the league amended its playoff format to allow a fourth place team in one division to qualify in place of a third place team with a worse record. That year, when only two [[Canadian Football League East Division|East Division]] teams qualified compared to four [[Canadian Football League West Division|Western]] teams, the rules mandated the two Eastern teams play a two-game total points series over two weekends while the four Western teams played a single elimination playoff over the same time frame. The CFL eventually amended this format into the present "crossover rule" so as to allow a qualifying fourth place team to compete as the third place team in the other divisional bracket, thereby preserving the first place byes. Prior to 1973, the CFL used two game and three game playoffs in its divisional rounds, as discussed below.

Beginning in 2012, [[Major League Baseball]] expanded its playoffs from 8 teams to 10, adding a second wild card in each league. The wild card teams now play a one-game playoff to determine which club advances to the best-of-five division series to meet the team with the best overall record in that particular league.

In both the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|men's]] and [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|women's]] [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[college basketball]] tournaments, 64 teams are seeded into four brackets of 16 teams each. (From 2011, the men's tournament will feature a "First Four", with the four lowest-ranked conference champions and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams playing single games to enter the 64-team draw.) The #1 team plays the #16 team in each bracket, the #2 plays the #15, and so on. Theoretically, if a higher-ranked team always beats a lower-ranked team, the second game will be arranged #1 vs. #8, #2 vs. #7, etc.; the third will be arranged #1 vs. #4, #2 vs. #3; the fourth will be arranged #1 vs. #2. If for instance #9 beats #8 in the first game, the #9 will simply take the theoretical spot of #8 and play #1. Winners advance through each round, changing cities after every two rounds. The [[Final Four]] teams, one from each bracket, play each other in the last weekend, with the winner of the final two being awarded the championship.

National [[association football]] competitions usually don't have playoffs, but when employed, use single-elimination formats to determine finalists and winners. The [[Major League Soccer]] [[MLS Cup Playoffs|playoffs]] use such a format; since [[2012 Major League Soccer season|2012]], the first round in each conference and the championship final, known as the [[MLS Cup]], are conducted as single games, while the conference semifinals and conference finals are two-legged matches determined on total goals scored. [[Liga MX]] in [[Mexico]], which splits its season into [[Apertura and Clausura|two phases]], uses playoffs known as the ''Liguilla'' to determine the champions of each phase. Unlike the MLS system, all ''Liguilla'' matches are two-legged ties. [[Australia]]'s [[A-League]] introduced a six-team knockout playoff, known locally as a "finals series", in the [[2012–13 A-League|2012–13 season]]. Unlike the MLS playoffs or Liga MX ''Liguilla'', the A-League finals series uses one-off matches throughout, culminating in the [[A-League Grand Final]]. This format is a departure from norms in football codes in Australia; previously, the A-League used a [[#Top six system|hybrid elimination system]] that allowed top teams in the regular season to lose one finals match but still win the tournament. The [[FIFA World Cup]] tournament also uses knockout rounds after a group stage of 32 teams divided into 8 groups of 4 determines who advances to them.

Some knockout tournaments may also include a [[third place playoff]], a single match to decide which competitor or team will be credited with finishing third and fourth place. The teams that compete in such third place games are usually the two losing semifinalists in a particular tournament. Although these semifinalists are still in effect "eliminated" from contending for the championship, they either may be competing for a [[bronze medal]] like some tournaments in the [[Olympic Games]] or basically just to salvage some pride in a consolation match, like in the [[FIFA World Cup]] or [[Rugby World Cup]].

When a playoff of this type involves the top four teams, it is sometimes known as the [[Shaughnessy playoff system]], after [[Frank Shaughnessy]], who first developed it for the [[International League]] of [[Minor League Baseball|minor league baseball]]. Variations of the Shaughnessy system also exist, such as in the promotion playoffs held by [[League 1 (rugby league)|League 1]] of British rugby league. The League 1 playoff does not involve the top four teams; the team that tops the table after the Super 8s phase (which follows a single round-robin phase involving all league teams) is crowned champion and  receives automatic promotion to the second-tier [[Championship (rugby league)|Championship]], while the next four teams contest a knockout playoff for the second promotion place. A nearly identical format, with the only difference being that the knockout stage followed a full home-and-away league season, was used by the second level of France's rugby union system, [[Rugby Pro D2|Pro D2]], through the 2016–17 season. Since then, Pro D2 uses a six-team playoff with the winner earning automatic promotion to the [[Top 14]] and the runner-up entering a playoff with the 13th-place team in Top 14 for the final place in the next season's Top 14.

==Stepladder==
The "stepladder", named so as the bracket resembles a [[step ladder]] is a variation of the single-elimination tournament; instead of, in a 16-team tournament, the #1 seed facing the #16 seed in the first round, the bracket is constructed as to give the higher seeded teams [[bye (sports)|bye]]s, where the #1 seed has bye up to the third round, playing the winner of game between the #8 seed the #9 vs. #16 winner. This setup is seldom used best-of-''x'' series as this may yield long waiting times for the teams afforded the bye, while the teams that played in the earlier rounds would be spent when they reach the latter rounds.

The  [[Big East Men's Basketball Tournament]] used this format in a 16-team, 5-round format. The [[PBA Tour]] uses the 4-player, 3-round format (sometimes a 5-player, 4 round format). The [[UAAP Basketball Championship|University Athletic Association of the Philippines Basketball Championship]] uses this format (4-teams, 3-rounds) only if there's an undefeated team, otherwise it uses a single-elimination format.

While [[Nippon Professional Baseball]]'s [[Climax Series]] has been called a "stepladder" playoff with only three participating teams (2 rounds), it functions mostly as a single-elimination tournament with 3 teams, and is structurally the same with a 6-team, 3-round playoff.  The [[KBO League]]'s [[KBO Korean Series|Korean Series]], on the other hand, is considered a stepladder system - the teams that finish third and fourth place play a best-of-3 series (with the third place team automatically a 1-0 series lead), whose winner then plays the second-place team in a best-of-5, whose winner in turn plays the first-place team in a best-of-7 for the title.

[[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] has their playoffs done this way: the 5-8 and 6-7 seeds play in the first round. The top two seeds get double byes and the next two seeds 1st-round byes. The first two rounds are single-elimination; all others are best-of-5.

[[League of Legends]] competition often uses the stepladder system. The [[League of Legends Pro League]] uses a double stepladder for its playoffs, giving the first seeds of the Western and Eastern Conferences a bye to the semifinals, the second seeds a bye to the quarterfinals, and the third seeds a one-game advantage against the fourth seeds in the first round. The [[League of Legends Pro League]], [[League of Legends Championship Series]], and [[League of Legends Master Series]] also use a stepladder bracket (in this case referred to as "The Gauntlet") to determine each league's third representative at the [[League of Legends World Championship]].

==Double elimination==
{{Main article|Double-elimination tournament}}
A ''[[double elimination]]'' format is used in most NCAA and high school [[baseball]] and [[softball]] tournaments in the United States. Starting in [[2010 Little League World Series|2010]], the [[Little League World Series]] in baseball also adopted this format. Teams are eliminated from contention after incurring two losses in each round of play.

The format changes depending on the number of teams per bracket, but most major [[college baseball|collegiate baseball]] conferences with the format send only the top eight teams, or a mix of top teams plus the winners of a single elimination qualifier tournament, to their conference tournament.

The NCAA baseball and softball tournaments have used the format since its inception for regional and [[College World Series]] play.

In the current NCAA tournament format for four teams, the #1 seed plays the #4 seed ("Game 1"), and the #2 seed plays the #3 seed ("Game 2") on the first day of regional tournaments, and the first and second days of the College World Series (where the second bracket games are known as "Game 3" and "Game 4", respectively).

On the second day or series (third and fourth days at the College World Series), the losers play in the morning to determine who is eliminated ("Game 3" in regional, "Games 5" and "Game 7" in College World Series play), and who advances to the third game of the day. The winners ("Game 4" in regional, "Game 6" and "Game 8" in College World Series) play to determine who advances to the final on the third day.

In NCAA regional games, the loser of this game plays the winner of the morning game that evening ("Game 5") to determine who plays in the final.

In College World Series play, because the bracket teams play on alternating days, these games ("Game 9" and "Game 10") are played on the fifth day.

In NCAA regional games, the third day will feature the regional championship ("Game 6"). If the winner of Game 4 defeats the winner of Game 5, the winner advances to the Super Regional. Until the 2005 tournament, if the winner of Game 5 defeats the winner of Game 4, the two teams would meet again in Game 7 thirty minutes later to determine which team advances to the Super Regional.

However, with a concern that some teams were playing four games in two days, the NCAA made a rule change in 2005 to equalize the disadvantage of the winner of Game 5 by stating should the winner of Game 5 win Game 6, Game 7 would be played on a fourth day.

In the College World Series, on the sixth day, the winner of Game 9 plays the winner of Game 7 ("Game 11"), and the winner of Game 10 plays the winner of Game 8 ("Game 12"). If the winner in Game 7 wins Game 11, and/or the winner of Game 8 wins Game 12, such winners advance to the best-of-three final. If the winner of Game 9 defeats the winner of Game 7, and/or the winner of Game 10 defeats the winner of Game 8 the two teams would play again on the seventh day in Games 13 and 14, respectively, if they are needed, to determine who advances to the final.

Starting with the 2010 edition, the Little League World Series adopted a new format that involves four double-elimination brackets. In 2010, the U.S. and International divisions were split into two four-team pools, with each pool conducting a double-elimination tournament to determine its winner. After the end of double-elimination play, the U.S. pool winners play one another in single games, as do the International pool winners, with the losers playing a third-place game and the winners playing a championship game. This was altered in 2011 so that all eight US team and all eight international teams played in one large bracket each, with each bracket's winner playing each other for the championship and each bracket's runner-up playing each other for third-place.  In another new feature, all teams are guaranteed at least three games; the first team eliminated from each pool plays a "crossover game" that matches an eliminated U.S. team with an eliminated International team.

Many [[esports]], most notably [[Counter-Strike]] and [[StarCraft]], use a double-elimination bracket to determine the top two teams in a four team group. In this usage, the format is referred to as "GSL", after the [[Global StarCraft II League]]. [[Dota 2]] competitions often use a GSL or round robin group stage to seed teams into a double-elimination bracket. [[Super Smash Bros.]] tournaments, as well as other [[fighting game]] competitions, typically use an open double-elimination bracket with no preceding group stage or qualifiers.

==Hybrid elimination systems==
{{further|McIntyre System}}
Some playoff systems combine the features of single- and double-elimination tournaments. In these systems, one or more higher-ranked teams have an opportunity to skip a round of the playoffs by winning their first match. Even if they lose that match, they can still advance to the championship final. Lower-ranked teams receive no such break.

These are variations of systems developed by Australian lawyer [[Kenneth McIntyre|Ken McIntyre]] for the Victorian Football League (VFL), the historic predecessor to today's [[Australian Football League]] (AFL), starting in 1931.

===Page–McIntyre system===
{{main article|Page playoff system}}
This system, also bearing the name of its promoter Percy Page, is a four-team playoff first developed for [[Australian rules football]]. It has been used in many competitions in that sport and in [[rugby league]], but is most prominent in [[softball]] and [[curling]] (which use the name "Page playoff system"). The [[Indian Premier League]] in [[Twenty20]] [[cricket]] uses this system as well.

In this system, the first round (sometimes called the "quarterfinals") matches #1 against #2 and #3 against #4. The winner of the 1–2 match advances directly to the final. The next round, known as the semifinal, pits the loser of the 1–2 match against the winner of the 3–4 match.

====Example====
As used in the [[2006 Tim Hortons Brier]], Canada's national men's curling championship:

| RD3-score1=7
| RD3-seed2=2
| RD3-team2='''{{flag|Quebec|size=30px}}'''
| RD3-score2='''8'''
}}

===Top five system===
{{main article|Top five play-offs}}
McIntyre's first modification was an expansion to five teams. In this format, the first round matches #2 v #3 and #4 v #5, with the #1 seed receiving a bye into the second round. The 4–5 match is played to eliminate one team, while the 2–3 match is played to determine which match they will play in the second round.

In the second round, the loser of the 2–3 match plays the winner of the 4–5 match, while the winner of the 2–3 match plays the #1 seed. From this point forward, the tournament is identical to the Page playoff system.

While no major league uses this system today, it has been used in the past by the VFL and several rugby league competitions, most notably the short-lived [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] of Australia and the present-day European [[Super League]]. Many lower-level leagues in both Australian rules and rugby league still use the system.

====Example====

===Top six system===
{{main article|Top six play-offs}}
{{see also|McIntyre System#First McIntyre final six system|McIntyre System#Second McIntyre final six system|l1=First McIntyre final six system|l2=Second McIntyre final six system}}
McIntyre next developed two slightly different systems for six-team playoffs. In each system, the #1 and #2 seeds played to determine the specific semifinal match in which they would compete, while the other four teams played knockout matches in the first week to eliminate two teams and determine the other two semifinal participants. The semifinal in which the winner of the 1–2 match competes directly determines one place in the championship final (often called a "Grand Final", especially in Australia). The other semifinal is an elimination match, with the winner advancing into a "Preliminary Final" to determine the other Grand Final place.

This system was further tweaked into the top-six system used by the [[Championship (rugby league)|Championship]] and [[League 1 (rugby league)|League 1]] of European rugby league until being abandoned from the 2015 season forward. A slightly modified version of this system was used in the [[A-League]] of Australian soccer starting in [[2009–10 A-League|2010]] before a pure knockout format was adopted beginning in [[2012–13 A-League|2013]].

In the modern top-six system, the first round consists of knockout matches involving #3 vs #6 and #4 vs #5, with the #1 and #2 teams receiving a bye into the next round. After those matches, the format is identical to the Page playoff system.

The A-League's former system had the top two teams participating in a two-legged match instead of the single-elimination matches that the other four teams faced. It did not affect the teams' eventual playoff paths.

===Top eight system===
{{main article|McIntyre Final Eight System|AFL final eight system|Super League play-offs}}
McIntyre's final development expanded the concept to an eight-team playoff. This expansion meant that no team received a "second chance" after the first week of the playoffs.

====McIntyre Final Eight====
The original McIntyre Final Eight system is notable in that it uses the regular-season league table to eliminate two teams in the first week of the playoffs. The procedure is:

;Week 1
* 1st Qualifying Final: 4th seed vs 5th seed
* 2nd Qualifying Final: 3rd seed vs 6th seed
* 3rd Qualifying Final: 2nd seed vs 7th seed
* 4th Qualifying Final: 1st seed vs 8th seed

The fates of the teams in this round depend on whether they won or lost their Qualifying Final, and on their regular-season position. The four winners and the two losers that finished highest on the regular-season table advance to later rounds, with the two other losers eliminated.

;Week 2
* 1st Semi-final:&lt;ref name="semi-final"&gt;Under finals systems traditionally used in Australian sport, the term "semi-final" has different usage from that in a traditional knockout tournament. The two games played immediately before the Grand Final, which would be known as semi-finals in a knockout tournament, are called "preliminary finals". The semi-finals refer to the two games preceding the preliminary finals. This terminology was used by the AFL under the McIntyre System from 1931 until 1993, and continues to this day in the AFL and most other Australian leagues. The main exception is the A-League, which adopted a pure knockout finals series in 2013 and uses "semi-final" for the games immediately preceding its Grand Final.&lt;/ref&gt; 4th highest-ranked winner vs 2nd highest-ranked loser
* 2nd Semi-final: 3rd highest-ranked winner vs 1st highest-ranked loser

The two losing teams are eliminated, and the two winning teams progress to Week 3.

;Week 3
* 1st Preliminary Final: Highest-seeded Qualifying Final winner vs winner of 1st Semi-final
* 2nd Preliminary Final: Second-highest-seeded Qualifying Final winner vs winner of 2nd Semi-final

The two losing teams are eliminated, and the two winning teams progress to the Grand Final.

;Week 4
* Grand Final: winner of 1st Preliminary Final vs winner of 2nd Preliminary Final

Due to perceived weaknesses of this system, the AFL adopted a modified top-eight playoff in [[2000 AFL season|2000]]. The [[National Rugby League]] (NRL), Australia's top rugby league competition (also with [[New Zealand Warriors|a team]] in New Zealand), used this system from 1999 through 2011, after which it changed to the AFL system.

====AFL system====
The current AFL finals system breaks up the eight participants into four groups of two teams, ranked by their league position after regular-season play. Each group receives an advantage over the teams directly below it on the league table. These advantages are the so-called "double-chance", where a loss in the first week will not eliminate a team from the finals, and home ground finals. Note, however, that "home" designations are often irrelevant if a finals match involves two teams from the same state. 
The finals format operates as follows:
;Week 1
* 1st Qualifying Final: 1st seed hosts 4th seed
* 2nd Qualifying Final: 2nd seed hosts 3rd seed
* 1st Elimination Final: 5th seed hosts 8th seed
* 2nd Elimination Final: 6th seed hosts 7th seed

The top four teams play the two Qualifying Finals.  The winners get a bye through to Week 3 of the tournament to play home Preliminary Finals, while the losers play home Semi-Finals in Week 2.  The bottom four teams play the two Elimination Finals, where the winners advance to Week 2 away games and the losers' seasons are over.

;Week 2
* 1st Semi-final:&lt;ref name="semi-final"/&gt; Loser of 1st QF hosts winner of 1st EF
* 2nd Semi-final: Loser of 2nd QF hosts winner of 2nd EF

;Week 3
* 1st Preliminary Final:&lt;ref name="semi-final"/&gt; Winner of 1st QF hosts winner of 2nd SF
* 2nd Preliminary Final: Winner of 2nd QF hosts winner of 1st SF

;Week 4
* [[AFL Grand Final]]: Winners of the two Preliminary Finals meet at the MCG.

The specific advantages gained by finishing in higher positions on the league table are as follows:

'''First and second''' — These teams receive the double-chance, and play their first two finals matches at home—their Qualifying Final, and then either a Semi-final (should they lose the QF) or Preliminary Final (should they win the QF). They must win two finals matches to reach the Grand Final.

'''Third and fourth''' — Like the top two teams, they receive the double-chance, and must win two finals matches to reach the Grand Final. However, they only get to play one finals match at home—a Semi-final if they lose their QF, or Preliminary Final if they win the QF.

'''Fifth and sixth''' — These teams do not receive a double-chance. They must win three matches to reach the Grand Final—an Elimination Final, Semi-final, and Preliminary Final. They do get to host their EF.

'''Seventh and eighth''' — These teams receive neither a double-chance nor a home finals match, and must also win three finals matches to reach the Grand Final.

The [[National Rugby League]] and [[Victorian Football League]] operate the same finals system.

====Super League system====
From [[Super League XIV|2009]] through to [[Super League XIX|2014]], the Super League used a top-eight playoff system. The expansion to an eight-team bracket coincided with the league's expansion from 12 to 14 teams. Like the AFL system, the Super League system eliminated two teams in each week leading up to the Grand Final. However, it had a number of differences from the AFL system, most notably the feature known as "Club Call" (explained below).&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite web | title = Super League play-offs overhauled| publisher = BBC | date = 2008-11-30 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/7757687.stm | accessdate = 2012-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the AFL, the participants were ranked by league position in the regular season. Unlike in the AFL, the team receiving home advantage in each match leading up to the Grand Final was guaranteed the right to host the match at a ground of its choosing, either its regular home stadium or (rarely) a larger nearby alternative.

;Week 1
* Qualifying Play-Offs:
** 1st vs 4th
** 2nd vs 3rd
The winners of these matches advanced directly to Week 3, in which they received home advantage. The higher-seeded winner received Club Call immediately after Week 2. The losers had another chance in Week 2, when they were at home to the winners of the Week 1 Elimination Play-Offs.
* Elimination Play-Offs
** 5th v 8th
** 6th v 7th
The winners of these matches advanced to Week 2, with the losers being eliminated.

;Week 2
* Preliminary Semi-Final 1: Highest-seeded QPO loser (1, 2, or 3) vs lowest-seeded EPO winner (6, 7, or 8)
* Preliminary Semi-Final 2: Lowest-seeded QPO loser (2, 3, or 4) vs highest-seeded EPO winner (5, 6, or 7)
The winners of these matches advanced to Week 3 and Club Call, with the losers being eliminated.

;Club Call
Club Call, a unique feature of the Super League system, took place on the second weekend of the playoffs, shortly after the winners of the two PSFs were known. The highest-seeded winning club from Week 1 was required to choose which of the two PSF winners they would play in Week 3.

;Week 3
* Qualifying Semi-Final 1: Highest-seeded QPO Winner v Club Call selected PSF winner
* Qualifying Semi-Final 2: Second-seeded QPO Winner v Club Call non-selected PSF winner
The winners advanced to the Grand Final the following week.

;Week 4
* [[Super League Grand Final]] at [[Old Trafford]], [[Manchester]]

[[Super League XX]] in 2015 introduced a radical change to the league system, under which the 24 clubs in Super League and the second-tier [[Championship (rugby league)|Championship]] are split into three groups of eight after each club has played 22 matches. The top eight clubs in Super League at that point will enter a new play-off structure, beginning with a single round-robin mini-league followed by a Shaughnessy play-off involving the top four teams.

=={{anchor|Best-of}}&lt;!-- [[Best-of series]] redirects here--&gt;Best-of formats==
The "best-of" formats refers to a head-to-head competition where the two competitors compete to first win the majority of the games allotted to win the "series". If a competitor wins a majority of the games, the remaining games may be discarded. This is a modification of the single-elimination tournament to allow more matches to be held. Moreover, if it can be said that if one competitor has a higher probability of winning a single game (and game results are [[i.i.d.]]), the likelihood that this competitor wins the series increases when more games are played. For example, if team A has a seventy percent chance of defeating team B in a single game, its probability of winning a best-of-three series against B is 78.4 percent, and its probability of winning a best-of-seven series is about 87.4 percent.
===Best-of-three playoff===
{{Redirect|Best of three|the Coney Hatch compilation album|Best of Three}}
A '''best-of-three playoff''' is a head-to-head competition between two teams in which one team must win two games to win the series. Two is chosen as it would constitute a majority of the games played; if one team wins both of the first two games, the third game is not played.

Often, when a best-of-series tied with each team having won an even number of games, the bracket is said to be a "best-of-(number of games left)." This is because for all practical purposes the teams are starting over. If a best-of-7 series is deadlocked at 2-2, the bracket is then referred to as a "best-of-3", since the reality is that the first team to win 2 games advances.

In [[tennis]], matches are usually decided with a best-of-3-sets format. Some major tournaments are played in a best-of-5-sets format, most notably the [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] men's singles and doubles. Also, the 35 and over Gentlemen's Invitation Doubles and the 35 and over Ladies' Invitation Doubles of the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] are both round-robin tournaments.

====In North American competitions====

The first use of the best-of-three playoff was in [[Major League Baseball]]; the [[National League]] authorised such a [[pennant playoff|playoff]] to be held if two teams ended the season in a tie for first place; the [[American League]] used a single game in this situation. Since {{Mlby|1969}} both leagues have used only a one-game playoff for all playoff positions which are tied if only one team can advance to the playoffs. Since {{Mlby|1995}}, a tie-breaker based on season performance can be used only to seed teams.

Both the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] and [[National Hockey League|NHL]] once used best-of-three playoffs (often referred to as "mini-series"), but today neither league does: Pro basketball first adopted the best-of-three playoff for first-round play starting with its inception as the Basketball Association of America in [[1946–47 BAA season|1946]] (changing its name to the NBA three years later) and retaining it through the [[1959–60 NBA season|1959–60]] season; the league resumed its use of the best-of-three first-round series in [[1974–75 NBA season|1974–75]], but abolished it again in [[1983–84 NBA season|1983–84]] when the number of teams qualifying for its postseason tournament was increased to 16 (ten teams had qualified during the first two years of the aforementioned period, this number being expanded to twelve in [[1976–77 NBA season|1976–77]]; in both instances some of the highest-ranking teams did not participate in the best-of-three round, drawing byes and automatically advancing to the second round, which was best-of-seven, as were all subsequent rounds).

In [[ice hockey]], the best-of-three format was one of two possible types of series that could be held to determine the winner of the [[Stanley Cup]] (the other being a two-legged playoff series), and it was used in lower rounds in the [[National Hockey League]] up until the [[Original Six]] era. The best-of-three series in the modern era was first used in the first-round of the Stanley Cup playoffs beginning with the [[1974–75 NHL season|1974–75]] season; at that time, the number of NHL playoff teams had been increased to twelve from the previous eight. The format which then took effect called for the first three finishers in each of the league's four divisions to enter the postseason, but the first-place teams drew byes and did not play any best-of-three series; the postseason then proceeded as the NBA's did, with the second and all later rounds being best-of-seven. This remained the case until the [[1979–80 NHL season|1979–80]] season, when the NHL expanded its playoff field to 16 after absorbing four teams from the defunct [[World Hockey Association]] in a semi-merger, whereupon the byes were abolished and all 16 qualifying teams participated in the first round, which was lengthened to best-of-five. In both the NBA and NHL, the team with the higher finish during the regular season played the first and (if necessary) the third games of the series at home, with the lower-ranked team hosting the second game.

The [[World Cup of Hockey]], organized by the NHL, used a best-of-three format in the final round in [[1996 World Cup of Hockey|1996]] and [[2016 World Cup of Hockey|2016]], as did the [[Canada Cup]]. 

Until 2009, the [[WNBA]] forced the team with the higher record to travel to the lower seed's home court for game 1, then played the final game(s) at home. Because of this perceived inequity, in [[2010 WNBA season|2010]], the league switched to a more traditional 1-1-1 format, where the higher seed would play the first and (if needed) third games at home. Also, in [[2005 WNBA season|2005]], the league switched the [[WNBA Finals]] to a best-of-five playoff format. By [[2016 WNBA season|2016]] the league semifinals matched this format.

NCAA Division I baseball uses the best-of-three format in the second round and the final round of its 64-team championship tournament. Starting in 1999, when the tournament expanded from 48 teams (eight regionals of six teams each) to 64 teams (sixteen regionals of four teams each), the NCAA introduced the "super regional", in which the 16 regional winners play in 8 best-of-three series, with the 8 series winners advancing to the [[College World Series]]. If a regional winner is also a national seed (top eight seeds of the 64 first-round teams), it is guaranteed to host the super regional; if no national seed makes a particular super regional, the NCAA puts hosting rights up for bidding between the competing schools. In 2003, the College World Series changed from a one-game final to a best-of-three series.

From approximately the founding of the [[Western Interprovincial Football Union]] in 1936 until the early 1970s, multi-game playoffs series were a regular fixture of professional [[Canadian football]] playoffs. Over the years, both the WIFU (later the [[Canadian Football League West Division|Western Football Conference]]) and the [[Interprovincial Rugby Football Union]] (later the [[Canadian Football League East Division|Eastern Football Conference]]) used a combination of best-of-three series, three game total points series and two game total points series to determine both conference final participants and conference champions. The [[Grey Cup]] itself has always consisted of a single game.

The last best-of-three playoff series in what by then had evolved into a [[Canadian Football League]] consisting of two autonomous conferences was the 1971 Western Conference Final. Since 1972, the West has used one game playoffs. The Eastern Conference (which by that time had abolished the best-of-three format in favour of two game total points series) adopted one game playoffs for the 1973 season.

The [[National Football League]] has always used one-game playoffs.

====Competitions held outside North America====
The [[Euroleague]], the primary [[Europe]]-wide club competition in basketball, introduced a quarterfinal round for the [[Euroleague 2004-05|2004–05 season]] which originally employed a best-of-three format; starting with the [[Euroleague 2008–09|2008–09 season]], the quarterfinal round became best-of-five. This is the only point in the Euroleague where a playoff series is used; all earlier rounds are conducted in a league format, and the quarterfinal winners advance to the Final Four, where all games are one-off knockout matches.

In the [[FIBA Oceania Championship]], the best-of-three series is used if only both [[Australia men's national basketball team|Australia]] and [[New Zealand national basketball team|New Zealand]] play in the tournament. If a team wins the first two games, the last game may still be played. If other teams participate, a regular round-robin or multi-stage tournament is used. In [[FIBA Oceania Championship 2009|2009]], a [[two-legged tie]] was used, but it was reverted to a best-of-3 series in [[2011 FIBA Oceania Championship|2011]].

The best-of-3 playoff system was also used in the Brazilian Football League for the 1998 and 1999 seasons quarterfinals, semifinals and finals. The Brazilian model was unique in that extra time was not used (meaning matches could end in a draw) therefore, this system had a few modifications. If no team could win two games, the team with most victories would qualify. If the two teams had one victory, the team with the best [[goal difference]] would qualify. If the goal difference was the same, the team with the best regular season campaign would qualify. An interesting fact is that during the 1998 season, all the rounds were decided in three games.

=====Twice to beat advantage=====
In a modification of the best-of-3 format, the leagues in the [[Philippines]] awards a ''twice to beat advantage'' to the top seeds; in this case, the team with the twice to beat advantage needs to be beaten twice by its opponent, while it only has to win once, in a ''de facto'' 1–0 lead in a best-of-3 series. First applied in the semifinals of the scholastic [[UAAP Basketball Championship]], it has been adopted by the other scholastic competitions. The professional [[Philippine Basketball Association]] has adopted the format in the early rounds of its playoffs.

An amendment to the rules in 2008 gave the undefeated team of the season in the UAAP (the team that won all elimination round games) a [[bye (sport)|bye]] up to the finals possessing an automatic 1–0 lead in a best-of-5 series, or the ''thrice to beat advantage''. This has since been adopted by the [[NCAA (Philippines)|NCAA]] in 2009 and abolished in 2016, when the undefeated team has a final berth, but played in a common best-of-three format

===Best-of-five playoff===
A '''best-of-five playoff''' is a competition between two teams head-to-head which must win three games to win the series. Three is chosen as it would constitute a majority of games played; whoever has won three games before all five games have been played, all other games are omitted.

At present, only one [[United States|American]] men's professional sports body - [[Major League Baseball]] - makes use of the best-of-five playoff, doing so in its second round, known as the [[Division Series]]. At one time, however, the [[League Championship Series]] was best-of-five, from its birth with both leagues' realignment into two divisions in {{Mlby|1969}}, and continuing until this round was lengthened to best-of-seven in {{Mlby|1985}}. (This change would have immediate ramifications: In the American League, in each of the first two years where the LCS used the best-of-seven format, the [[Kansas City Royals]] in [[1985 American League Championship Series|1985]] and the [[Boston Red Sox]] in [[1986 American League Championship Series|1986]] fell behind 3-1 - which previously would have eliminated them - before coming back to win the series.) When the [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] was first used in {{Mlby|1995}} (it was created for the {{Mlby|1994}} season, but that year's entire postseason was canceled due to [[1994 baseball strike|a players' strike]]), the best-of-five format was authorized for the new Division Series, in which eight teams participated.

During the time that the League Championship Series was best-of-five, a "2-3" format was used, with one team hosting the first two games, the other the last three (these respective roles alternating between the Eastern and Western Division champions regardless of which one finished with the better regular-season record). This procedure was repeated at first when the best-of-five Division Series was added in 1995 (except that two of each league's now three division winners hosted three games and the wild card could never do so), but starting in {{Mlby|1998}} the home-field advantage was awarded to the two division winners in each league that had the best records; also in 1998, the "2-2-1" format was instituted, the team with the home-field advantage being given the first, second and fifth games at home instead of the third, fourth and fifth. For the 2012 postseason, the Division Series reverted to "2-3". With the addition of a second Wild Card team and subsequent [[Major League Baseball Wild Card Game|Wild Card Game]], a decision not made until well after the season schedule had been created, this was done to minimize the disruption of the schedule by giving the Division Series one off day instead of two. With the Wild Card playoff now established and schedules adjusted accordingly, the "2-2-1" format was restored since 2013.

The [[National Basketball Association]] and [[National Hockey League]] both formerly used best-of-five series, the NBA in its second round prior to the {{Nbay|1957}} season, and in the first round from {{Nbay|1960}} through {{Nbay|1966}}, and again from {{Nbay|1983}} until lengthening it to best-of-seven starting in {{Nbay|2002}}, and the NHL for its first-round series beginning with the {{NHL Year|1979|80}} season and lasting until that league increased its first round to best-of-seven in {{NHL Year|1986|87}}. Unlike in baseball, in both NBA and NHL best-of-five series the higher regular-season finisher always hosted the first, second, and (if necessary) fifth games.

As of [[2005 WNBA season|2005]], the [[Women's National Basketball Association]] now uses a best-of-five format for its [[WNBA Finals|championship]] series. The league semifinals matched this format starting in [[2016 WNBA season|2016]].

Historically, most European domestic basketball leagues have used a best-of-five format in their championship series. The main long-standing exceptions are the [[Israeli Basketball Super League|Israeli]] and [[LNB Pro A|French]] leagues, which have historically used one-off finals; the [[Liga ABA|Adriatic League]] (former Yugoslavia), which has changed from a one-off final to a best-of-three final back to a one-off final in recent years; and the [[Lietuvos Krepšinio Lyga|Lithuanian]], [[Dominet Bank Ekstraliga|Polish]] and [[Turkish Basketball League|Turkish]] leagues, which use a best-of-seven format. [[Serie A (basketball)|Italy]] has gone to a best-of-seven final effective with its [[Lega Basket Serie A 2008–09|2008–09 season]]. The [[Euroleague Basketball|Euroleague]] quarterfinal round expanded to best-of-five from best-of-three starting in the 2008-09 season. France changed its final from a one-off match to a best-of-5 series in [[2012–13 LNB Pro A season|2012–13]].

[[The Ashes]], a [[cricket]] series played between [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] and [[England cricket team|England]] is a five-match series. All games are held, and the team with the most wins the trophy. If the series is tied, the team holding the trophy keeps until the next series. Most [[test cricket]] matches are played under this format; others extend up to seven matches. Test cricket is typically hosted by one team throughout the entire series. While series such as this have five matches, it's not exactly "best-of-five", as [[Result (cricket)|draws, and other results]], are possible.

===Best-of-seven playoff===
A '''best-of-seven playoff''' is a competition between two teams head-to-head which must win four games to win the series. Four is chosen as it would constitute a majority of games played; whoever has won four games before all seven games have been played, all other games are omitted.

It is not necessary for the four games to be [[consecutive]]ly won. Draws are not permitted, even in sports where they usually would be - play continues until there is a clear winner (except in [[Nippon Professional Baseball|Japanese professional baseball]], where a standard (12-inning) draw is permitted at the [[Climax Series|stepladder league playoff]] (higher seed wins if series tied after the five or seven game series ends), and a 12-inning draw is permitted in the [[Japan Series]] in all but the eighth game, played only if the series is tied, 3-3-1, after seven games). This ensures that a series will never require more than seven games to conclude. Before the advent of lighting in ballparks ballgames often ended tied because it was too dark to play, a much less common way of ending a ballgame is going past the curfews.{{Clarify|date=August 2010}} Tied games can result in series lasting eight games, which has happened, as in the [[1912 World Series]] and the 1986 Japan Series. This format is currently used in the [[National Basketball Association]] and the [[National Hockey League]] for all their playoff series. [[Major League Baseball]] uses this format only for the [[League Championship Series]] since 1985 and the [[World Series]] from 1905 to 1918 and since 1922, using the "2-3-2" format, with two games at the home stadium of one team, the next three games (the fifth, if necessary) at the home stadium of the other team, and the final two games (if necessary) at the home stadium of the first. (The first round [[Wild Card Game]] is a single game; the second round [[Division Series]] use a five-game series format.)

The [[National Hockey League]] uses this format for its league championship [[Stanley Cup]] playoffs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=529012 Sample use in NHL press release] Published 12 May 2010. Accessed 26 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; but uses the "2-2-1-1-1" format, alternating the first two games at the home-ice team's home rink, the next two at the second team, and then alternating venues for the fifth, sixth and seventh games (if necessary).

The [[National Basketball Association]] has this format, too, with "2-2-1-1-1" for all playoff rounds, and also the [[NBA Finals|Finals]]; originally the championship round was "2-2-1-1-1" as well (except 1971, 1975, 1978-1979), but was changed to "2-3-2" from 1985-2013 to cut down on travel expenses, as the league's "[[Eastern Conference (NBA)|East]]-[[Western Conference (NBA)|West]]" divisional alignment means the two teams are usually separated by great distances - indeed, the cities represented in the Finals' [[Celtics–Lakers rivalry|most frequent matchup]], [[Los Angeles Lakers|Los Angeles]] and [[Boston Celtics|Boston]], are almost 3,000 miles apart.

The "2-3-2" format, the "2-2-1-1-1" format, and the "1-1-1-1-1-1-1" format are situated such that if a team "sweeps" the series (wins 4-0), it will win two games at home, and two games away. They are also set up such that the team with [[home advantage]] for the series plays at home for the first game and the seventh game if necessary. As previously stated, the "2-3-2" format reduces travel between the two venues, but it then gives the team "without" home advantage three consecutive home games. The "1-1-1-1-1-1-1" format is mainly used in the postseason tournaments of the [[Liiga]] in Finland and the [[Swedish Hockey League]].

The [[American Hockey League|AHL]] and the [[ECHL]] do not use a set playoff format for their league championship playoff tournaments due to scheduling conflicts. For example, in the [[2016 Calder Cup playoffs]], due to scheduling conflicts in both arenas, the Pacific Division finals between the [[Ontario Reign (AHL)|Ontario Reign]] and the [[San Diego Gulls]] used the "1-1-1-1-1-1-1" playoff format, with Ontario hosting the first, third, fifth, and seventh game.&lt;ref&gt;http://lakingsinsider.com/2016/04/30/ontario-san-diego-schedule-a-brutal-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-format/&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted earlier, the [[Chinese Basketball Association|Chinese]], [[Lega Basket Serie A|Italian]], [[Lietuvos krepšinio lyga|Lithuanian]], [[Polish Basketball League|Polish]] and [[Turkish Basketball League|Turkish]] basketball leagues use a best-of-seven format in their championship series. The Turkish playoff has one unique feature. If one team in the championship series (or, for that matter, in ''any'' playoff series) defeated its final opponent in both of their regular-season games, the winning team is granted a 1-0 lead in the series, and the series starts with Game 2. The [[Philippine Basketball Association|Philippine Basketball Association (PBA)]], aside from using the best-of-7 series in its finals series, has also used it on most its semifinals since 2005.

Occasionally, WWE uses this format in some of their matches, like the feud between [[Chris Benoit]] and [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] in 2005, for the [[WWE United States Championship]], or [[Antonio Cesaro|Cesaro]]'s rivalry against [[Sheamus]], with their first match at August pay-per-view [[SummerSlam (2016)|Summerslam 2016]].

===Best-of-nine playoff===
A '''best-of-nine playoff''' pits two teams head-to-head which must win five games to win the series. Five is chosen as it would constitute a majority of the games played. Whoever has won five games before all nine games have been played, all other games are omitted.

In [[Major League Baseball]], the [[World Series]] was conducted as a best-of-nine playoff in its first year of existence in [[1903 World Series|1903]], then again for three years beginning in [[1919 World Series|1919]], the year of the "[[Black Sox scandal]]."

The [[Western Hockey League]] used the best-of-nine playoff series for the Western Division playoffs from the 1983-84 season through the 1990-91 season because of the unequal division alignment of the league at this time.  The Eastern division had eight teams: six of which qualified for the playoffs. The Western division only had six teams: four of which made the playoffs.  Because of this, Eastern division had 3 rounds of playoffs (two teams receive a first round bye), while the Western division only had two rounds of playoffs.  The east played a best-of-five, best-of-seven, best-of-seven format for the three rounds while both rounds in the Western division playoffs were best-of-nine.  This was used so that both divisions would finish their playoffs at approximately the same time.  The WHL Championship Series was a best-of-seven.  These best-of-nine series went the full nine games on two occasions, with [[Portland Winterhawks|Portland]] defeating [[New Westminster Bruins|New Westminster]] in 1984 and [[Spokane Chiefs|Spokane]] in 1986.

The [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] used the best-of-nine playoff series for the 1986 playoffs.

===Higher number of games===
In [[snooker]], a player must win a certain number of frames to win a [[Snooker rules#A snooker match|match]], often nine (best-of-17) or more. Again, if one player wins nine frames before all 17 are played, the rest are omitted. The [[Snooker World Championship|world championship]] final is currently decided in a best-of-35 match.

In [[9-ball]], a player must win a certain number of racks to win a match. In the [[WPA World Nine-ball Championship]], nine racks are needed to win in the early stages, ten to eleven in the latter stages, and 17 in the final. As with snooker, if one player wins nine frames before all 17 are played, the rest are omitted.

==Total points series (aggregate)==
{{further|Two-legged tie}}
Various playoff formats, including [[two-legged tie]]s and '''total points series''' pair off participants in a number of games (often two), with the winner being determined by '''aggregate score''': the winner being the one who scores the most points/goals etc. over the series of games. Two-legged ties are common in [[association football]], and were used in [[NHL]] playoff series until 1937. It currently used in North America in the [[MLS Cup Playoffs]]. 

In [[2004 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series|2004]], [[NASCAR]] adopted a total points playoff of a different stripe, creating a "[[NASCAR playoffs|Chase for the Cup]]" that allowed a golf-style cut of the high ten or 400 points of the leader, whichever is greater, to compete for the championship in the last ten races. The Chase format has changed several times since its creation:
* In the [[2007 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series|2007 season]], the Chase was expanded to include the top 12 drivers after 26 races. The points of the drivers in the cut are elevated far beyond those of the pack. From [[2007 Chase for the NEXTEL Cup|2007]] to [[2010 Chase for the Sprint Cup|2010]], each Chase driver received 5,000 points, with a 10-point bonus for each race won prior to the Chase.
* Starting in [[2011 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2011]], the points system and Chase qualification criteria were significantly changed. Through the [[2013 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2013 season]], the top 10 drivers after 26 races automatically qualified for the Chase, joined by the two drivers with the most race wins among those ranked between 11th and 20th in points after 26 races. Reflecting a major change to the points system, in which the race winner can now earn a maximum of 48 points as opposed to 195 in the former system, driver points were reset to a base of 2,000. After the reset, automatic qualifiers received 3 bonus points for each race win, while the wild card qualifiers did not receive a bonus for wins. In the 2013 season, a 13th driver ([[Jeff Gordon]]) was added to the Chase following [[2013 Federated Auto Parts 400#The Singapore Sling and Team Orders Controversy|a major scandal]] in the [[2013 Federated Auto Parts 400|final pre-Chase race]] in which two teams were found to have extensively manipulated the race results in the final laps. 
* The [[2014 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2014 season]] introduced a radically different format, although the basic points system remains identical to that in the 2011–2013 period. Under the current system, the Monster Energy field, now officially called the "Monster Energy Grid", consists of 16 drivers. These drivers are chosen primarily on the basis of race wins during the first 26 races, provided that said drivers are in the top 30 in series points and have attempted to qualify for each race (barring injuries). The points leader is assured of a place on the Grid, but only if he does not have a race win. Any remaining spots on the Grid are filled in order of driver points. The format from this point is radically different—the Chase is now divided into four rounds, with three races in each of the first three rounds and a one-race finale.
** As in the 2011–2013 format, initial driver points are reset to 2,000 with a 3-point bonus for each win. All 16 Grid drivers compete to remain in the Chase for the first three Chase races, known as the "Challenger Round". After these races, the four lowest-placed drivers on the Grid are eliminated; they retain their points from the previous races and accumulate points in the remaining races based on the regular-season scoring system (this also applies to drivers eliminated at later stages). The winner of each of the first three races automatically advances to the next round of the Chase.
** The next round, the "Contender Round", starts with 12 drivers, each with 3,000 points but with no win bonus. As in the Challenger Round, the winner of each race in this round advances to the next round. As in the previous round, the four drivers with the lowest points total after this round are eliminated.
** The third round, the "Eliminator Round", starts with eight drivers, each with 4,000 points, again with no win bonus. As in the previous rounds, the winner of each race in this round advances to the next round. Again, the four drivers with the lowest points total after this round are eliminated.
** The last race of the season starts with four drivers still in contention for the championship; each starts the race with 5,000 points. The highest finisher of the four becomes Monster Energy Cup champion.

Regardless of the exact format, the driver in the Chase group with the most points after the final ten races wins the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Monster Energy Cup]].

In [[2005 PGA Tour|November 2005]], the [[PGA Tour]] announced that a similar total points playoff would be used to lead up to the [[PGA Championship]], starting in [[2007 PGA Tour|2007]]. The player with the most points at the end of the year would take home the [[FedEx Cup]].

Prior to the 1986 Playoffs, the Canadian Hockey League (especially the Ontario Hockey League) used the point series, to determine, which team would advance. In those situation, where the higher seeded host in odd number of game (game #1, 3, 5, 7), while the other team host the even number (game #2, 4, 6, 8). There would be no overtime, except for the deciding game, because a tie in the last game, of the series would not declare a series winner, so should that happens, there would be a sudden-death overtime, with the winner getting 2 points, and the losing team get nothing.

The game shows ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', and ''[[The Challengers (game show)|The Challengers]]'' have used two-game series in the final rounds of most of the tournaments that they held during their history. Each game is played separately (i.e., money from day one cannot be wagered on day two), and the money is added together to determine the winner. The only exception to this was in the [[Jeopardy! Ultimate Tournament of Champions|''Jeopardy!'' Ultimate Tournament of Champions]], when the two semifinal matches were both two-game series, and the final was a three-game series. If any ties remain, [[sudden death (sports)|sudden death]] was played to determine the champion.

===Example===
As it was used in the [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League knockout stage]]:
{{Football box

}}
''Bayern Munich 4–4 Real Madrid on aggregate. Bayern Munich won on [[away goals rule|away goals]] (BM 2–1 RM).''

==Round robin==
{{Main article|Round-robin tournament}}
In a '''round-robin tournament''', all playoff contenders play each other an equal number of times, usually once or twice (often called a "double round-robin"). This is a common format for [[association football]]. In the [[FIFA World Cup]], teams are organized into eight pools of four teams, playing each other once and ranked by points earned through wins (3 points) and draws (1 point). The top two teams advance out of each pool to the knockout phase where the top team from each pool face a second-placed team from a different pool.

Continental club football tournaments have included round robin formats, such as the [[Copa Libertadores]] from the 1966 season, [[UEFA Champions League]] from the 1992/93 season, [[UEFA Cup]] from 2004/05, and the [[AFC Champions League|Asian]] and [[CAF Champions League|African]] Champions Leagues. Teams are seeded such that strongest teams should not meet until the end. In the UEFA Champions League, 32 teams are divided into eight groups of four. The group winners and runners-up advance to a two-game, total goals round, the eight third-placed teams move into the UEFA Cup third round, and the eight fourth-placed teams are eliminated.

In [[basketball]], the [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Olympics]] also uses a round robin of the same nature, going to single elimination after the first round. The Euroleague has two double round-robin phases. The first is a "Regular Season" in which the 24 teams are divided into four groups of six (as of the 2008-09 season). The four top teams in each group advance to a "Top 16" phase in which the teams are divided into four groups of four each. The top two teams from each Top 16 group are then paired in four best-of-five quarterfinal series, with the winners advancing to the single-elimination Final Four.

Round-robin tournaments are also used in [[rugby union]], [[curling]], and many amateur or lower-division basketball, football, and hockey tournaments.

In 1992, the [[Little League World Series]] in youth baseball went to a round-robin tournament in the first round instead of single-elimination. In 2001, the tournament expanded to 16 teams and stayed with a round-robin for the first round, but cross-bracketed single elimination for the second round before the two winners of those games advanced to the region final. Little League used this format through 2009.

In [[Major League Baseball]], the term "round robin" was used with regard to the possibility of a 3-way tie for the [[1964 in baseball|National League pennant in 1964]].  The [[Philadelphia Phillies]] had had a 6½ game lead with 12 games left in their regular schedule, but then lost 10 games in a row, so that the season went into its last day with 3 teams still having a chance for the NL pennant.  As it turns out, the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] defeated the [[New York Mets]] on that day to take the NL pennant with no playoff; the reverse of that outcome would have left the Cardinals, the Phillies, and the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in a 3-way tie.

Teams in shaded in blue advance to the knockout stage.

==Associated concepts==
As discussed above, leagues also offer innovations in order to give advantage to teams that performed better in the regular season, such as reseeding and home advantage.

===Reseeding===
In tournaments where participants are seeded, in order to ensure that the strongest remaining team faces the weakest team, the participants are "reseeded" at each round; the tournament bracket is not fixed, where potential matchups can be readily determined up to the final. For example, in a regular 8-team bracket, the teams that will meet at the second round will be the winner of the #1 vs. #8 going up against the winner of #4 and #5, and the winner of #2 and #7 going up against the winner of #3 and #6. If the #5 and the #7 teams won in the first round, the second round matchups will be #1 vs. #7 and #3 vs. #5, instead of #1 vs. #5 and #3 vs. #7.

The only notable tournaments that employ this rule are the NFL Playoffs, [[WNBA Playoffs]] and the MLS Cup Playoffs. The Stanley Cup Playoffs had used that rule from 1994-2013. Note that reseeding does not come into play if there are only 2 rounds of competition.

====Example====
As it was used in the [[1994 Stanley Cup playoffs]] (scores in the bracket shown indicate the number of games won in each seven-game series):
{{1994 Stanley Cup playoffs}}

===Home advantage===
In team sports, the "[[home advantage|hometown advantage]]" refers to the phenomenon when certain teams (usually the higher-seeded teams) are afforded more games that can be played at their home arena/stadium than their opponent's. This is predominant in the best-of series where there are more games played in a team's arena/stadium than the other, and in single-elimination tournaments where the single game is disputed in a team's stadium. In a best-of series, a team can "lose" their home advantage if the visiting team wins the first game. Home advantage can be regained or lost in the course of the series.

As discussed above, a team can clinch the "home advantage" in a variety of ways:
*Clinching the higher seed (MLB, NHL and NFL)
*Winning more games than the opponent, but not necessarily clinching the higher seed (NBA)

In best-of series, the order of arenas/stadiums in which the games are played at also affects the home advantage. In the NBA and the NHL, all rounds are done in a 2-2-1-1-1 format, that is, the team with home advantage plays games 1-2, 5 and 7 (latter two games if needed). This ensures that the team with home advantage never trails assuming every game is won by the home team. From [[1985 NBA Finals|1985]] to [[2013 NBA Finals|2013]] the NBA Finals had utilised the 2-3-2 format (the team with the home court advantage plays games 1-2 and 6-7 in their home court), which can theoretically allow the team with the home court advantage to trail in the series (although that will require the team with the home court advantage to lose the middle three games, which has only happened thrice).

In NHL's Stanley Cup Finals, NBA Finals, and MLB's World Series, the teams with the higher regular season record receives the home advantage. The NFL's Super Bowl is held at a predetermined site regardless of which teams reach the game, which usually means there is no home advantage but it is still possible for the host city's team to play in the Super Bowl. Until 2016, In MLB's World Series, the team that came from the league that won the All-Star Game is awarded with the home field advantage.

In [[two-legged tie]]s such as the [[UEFA Champions League]], although it is said that the two teams play an equal number of games in their home stadium, the team playing the second game in their home stadium has a distinct advantage,{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} such as the resolution of ties will be at their stadium.

In games done on neutral venues, a team may still be afforded the privileges of the "home team" such as selecting which side to play first or choosing the side of the coin in coin flips. In most instances, this privilege is determined either by a drawing of lots (UEFA Champions League) or by rotation among the groupings of the different teams (NFL).

In the [[Nippon Professional Baseball]]'s postseason games (excluding [[Japan Series]]) since 2004, the team having a better position in regular position will be hosting all the games. In addition, since 2008, the League Champion will have a 1-win advantage in the 2nd stage of Climax Series (best-of-7 which actually played for 6 games).

The black sphere represents the intersection point of the three surfaces, which has [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] of roughly&amp;nbsp;(0.831,&amp;nbsp;−1.439,&amp;nbsp;2.182).]]

'''Prolate spheroidal coordinates''' are a three-dimensional [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]] [[coordinate system]] that results from rotating the two-dimensional [[elliptic coordinates|elliptic coordinate system]] about the focal axis of the ellipse, i.e., the symmetry axis on which the foci are located.  Rotation about the other axis produces [[oblate spheroidal coordinates]].  Prolate spheroidal coordinates can also be considered as a [[limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]] of [[ellipsoidal coordinates]] in which the two smallest [[ellipsoid|principal axes]] are equal in length.

Prolate spheroidal coordinates can be used to solve various [[partial differential equation]]s in which the boundary conditions match its symmetry and shape, such as solving for a field produced by two centers, which are taken as the foci on the ''z''-axis.  One example is solving for the [[wavefunction]] of an [[electron]] moving in the [[electromagnetic field]] of two positively charged [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], as in the [[hydrogen molecular ion]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Another example is solving for the [[electric field]] generated by two small [[electrode]] tips.  Other limiting cases include areas generated by a line segment (''&amp;mu;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) or a line with a missing segment (&amp;nu;=0).

The surfaces of constant ''&amp;mu;'' and ''&amp;nu;'' are obtained by rotation about the ''z''-axis, so that the diagram is valid for any plane containing the ''z''-axis: i.e. for any ''&amp;phi;''.]]

The most common definition of prolate spheroidal coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\mu, \nu, \varphi)&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
x = a \sinh \mu \sin \nu \cos \varphi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y = a \sinh \mu \sin \nu \sin \varphi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
z = a \cosh \mu \cos \nu
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a nonnegative real number and &lt;math&gt;\nu \in [0, \pi]&lt;/math&gt;. The azimuthal angle &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; belongs to the interval &lt;math&gt;[0, 2\pi]&lt;/math&gt;.

The trigonometric identity

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{z^2}{a^2 \cosh^2 \mu} + \frac{x^2 + y^2}{a^2 \sinh^2 \mu} = \cos^2 \nu + \sin^2 \nu = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

shows that surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; form [[prolate]] [[spheroid]]s, since they are [[ellipse]]s rotated about the axis 
joining their foci. Similarly, the hyperbolic trigonometric identity

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{z^2}{a^2 \cos^2 \nu} - \frac{x^2 + y^2}{a^2 \sin^2 \nu} = \cosh^2 \mu - \sinh^2 \mu = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

shows that surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; form 
[[hyperboloid]]s of revolution.

The distances from the foci located at &lt;math&gt;(x, y, z) = (0, 0, \pm a)&lt;/math&gt; are

:&lt;math&gt;
r_\pm = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z \mp a)^2} = a(\cosh \mu \mp \cos \nu).
&lt;/math&gt;

==Scale factors==

The scale factors for the elliptic coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\mu, \nu)&lt;/math&gt; are equal

:&lt;math&gt;
h_\mu = h_\nu = a\sqrt{\sinh^2\mu + \sin^2\nu}
&lt;/math&gt;

whereas the azimuthal scale factor equals

:&lt;math&gt;
h_\varphi = a \sinh\mu \sin\nu
&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, an infinitesimal volume element equals

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = a^3 \sinh\mu \sin\nu ( \sinh^2 \mu + \sin^2 \nu) \, d\mu \, d\nu \, d\varphi
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Laplacian can be written

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\nabla^2 \Phi = {} &amp; \frac{1}{a^2 (\sinh^2 \mu + \sin^2 \nu)} 
\left[ \frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial \mu^2} + 
\frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial \nu^2} + 
\coth \mu \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \mu} + 
\cot \nu \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \nu}
\right] \\[6pt]
&amp; {} + \frac{1}{a^2 \sinh^2 \mu \sin^2\nu}
\frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial \varphi^2}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\mu, \nu, \varphi)&lt;/math&gt; by substituting the scale factors into the general formulae found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

==Alternative definition==

[[File:Prolate spheroidal coordinates degenerate.png|thumb|right|250px|In principle, a definition of prolate spheroidal coordinates could be degenerate.  In other words, a single set of coordinates might correspond to two points in [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]]; this is illustrated here with two black spheres, one on each sheet of the hyperboloid and located at (''x'', ''y'', ±''z'').  However, neither of the definitions presented here are degenerate.]]

An alternative and geometrically intuitive set of prolate spheroidal coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau, \phi)&lt;/math&gt; are sometimes used, 
where &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \cosh \mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau = \cos \nu&lt;/math&gt;.  Hence, the curves of constant &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; are prolate spheroids, whereas the curves of constant &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are hyperboloids of revolution.  The coordinate &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; belongs to the interval [−1,&amp;nbsp;1], whereas the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; coordinate must be greater than or equal to one.
 
The coordinates &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; have a simple relation to the distances to the foci &lt;math&gt;F_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt;.  For any point in the plane, the ''sum'' &lt;math&gt;d_{1}+d_{2}&lt;/math&gt; of its distances to the foci equals &lt;math&gt;2a\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, whereas their ''difference'' &lt;math&gt;d_{1}-d_{2}&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;2a\tau&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, the distance to &lt;math&gt;F_{1}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;a(\sigma+\tau)&lt;/math&gt;, whereas the distance to &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;a(\sigma-\tau)&lt;/math&gt;.  (Recall that &lt;math&gt;F_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt; are located at &lt;math&gt;z=-a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z=+a&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.) This gives the following expressions for &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma = \frac 1 {2a} \left(\sqrt{x^2+y^2+(z+a)^2}+\sqrt{x^2+y^2+(z-a)^2}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\tau = \frac 1 {2a} \left(\sqrt{x^2+y^2+(z+a)^2}-\sqrt{x^2+y^2+(z-a)^2}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\varphi = \arctan\left(\frac y x \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

Unlike the analogous [[oblate spheroidal coordinates]], the prolate spheroid coordinates (σ, τ, φ) are ''not'' degenerate; in other words, there is a [[1-to-1 mapping|unique, reversible correspondence]] between them and the [[Cartesian coordinates]]

:&lt;math&gt;
x  = a \sqrt{(\sigma^2 - 1) (1 - \tau^2)} \cos \varphi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y  = a \sqrt{(\sigma^2 - 1) (1 - \tau^2)} \sin \varphi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
z = a\ \sigma\ \tau
&lt;/math&gt;

==Alternative scale factors==

The scale factors for the alternative elliptic coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau, \varphi)&lt;/math&gt; are

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\sigma} = a\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^{2} - \tau^{2}}{\sigma^{2} - 1}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\tau} = a\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^{2} - \tau^{2}}{1 - \tau^{2}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

while the azimuthal scale factor is now

:&lt;math&gt;
h_\varphi = a \sqrt{\left( \sigma^{2} - 1 \right) \left( 1 - \tau^{2} \right)}
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, the infinitesimal volume element becomes

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = a^3 (\sigma^2 - \tau^2) \, d\sigma \, d\tau \, d\varphi
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Laplacian equals

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\nabla^2 \Phi = {} &amp; 
\frac{1}{a^2 (\sigma^2 - \tau^2)}
\left\{ \frac{\partial}{\partial \sigma} \left[
\left( \sigma^2 - 1 \right) \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \sigma}
\right] + \frac{\partial}{\partial \tau} \left[ 
(1 - \tau^2) \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \tau}
\right]
\right\} \\
&amp; {} + \frac{1}{a^2 (\sigma^2 - 1) (1 - \tau^2)}
\frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial \varphi^2}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau)&lt;/math&gt; by substituting  the scale factors into the general formulae  found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

As is the case with [[spherical coordinates]], Laplace's equation may be solved by the method of [[separation of variables]] to yield solutions in the form of '''prolate spheroidal harmonics''', which are convenient to use when boundary conditions are defined on a surface with a constant prolate spheroidal coordinate (See Smythe, 1968).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23370">'''Public interest law''' loosely, refers to legal practices undertaken to help poor or marginalized people, or to effect change in social policies in the public interest, on 'not for profit' terms ([[pro bono|''pro bono publico'']]). In general terms it means a legal action initiated in the court of law for the protection of Public Interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learningthelaw.in/2016/07/nature-and-importance-of-public.html Nature and Importance of Public Interest Litigation], available at Learning the Law.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not a body of law or a legal field, matters lawyers work on. Rather, it denotes the clientele they represent. Instead of serving powerful economic interests, it stands for the advocacy of otherwise under-represented or vulnerable individuals, especially those living in poverty. It has grown to encompass a broader range of activities, typically the field of non-lawyers like civil rights, civil liberties, women's rights, consumer rights, environmental protection, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Forster|first1=Christine M.

Cummings &amp; Ingrid V. Eagly, After Public Interest Law, NWU L. Rev. 1251, 1251-1259, 2075-2077(2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Central and Eastern Europe ==
At the end of the communist period in the early 1990s, the national legal systems of Central and Eastern Europe were still in a formative stage. The most important source of legal authority for the new human rights groups came from outside the region: the [[Council of Europe]], with its [[European Convention on Human Rights]], and the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=Rekosh&gt;Edwin Rekosh, Constructing Public Interest Law: Transnational Collaboration and Exchange in Central and Eastern Europe, 13 UCLA J. Int'l L.&amp; For. Aff.55, 80-82&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, in the mid-1990s, U.S. experiences became more relevant. The Council of Europe's prerequisite that lawyers use their own country's courts first to seek legal remedies before turning to the European bodies gradually became more than a pro forma exercise, and civil society organizations began to make more effective use of domestic means of adjudication. But by the time local activists were ready to consider the utility of [[impact litigation]], test cases, and other tactics familiar from the U.S. experience, they already understood that their ultimate tactical weapon in any piece of litigation was to use the threat or reality of a supportive decision at the European Court of Human Rights. With this background in mind, it made more sense for the promoters of public interest law in Central and Eastern Europe to talk about "strategic litigation" than about public interest litigation. Using the instrumentality of the European Court of Human Rights effectively required a strategic approach. Not all human rights cases were likely to receive a favorable ruling; a negative ruling could produce more damage to the human rights cause than no ruling at all. The European Court had a rich case law that could provide clues to how a future case might be decided, and there were procedural aspects, such as the requirement to exhaust domestic remedies, to consider.

The core lesson from the U.S. experience for local activists was how courts could be used effectively as a tool for civil society engagement in governance.&lt;ref name=Rekosh /&gt;
== Italy ==
The changes to the Italian electoral law from 2014 to 2017 were both "caused by actions born from the bottom (...) the result of a methodical, studied and concerted action. It has been featured by university professors, constitutional and electoral law-makers, parliamentarians and other elected representatives (...), representatives of civil society and ordinary citizens. Their names are, as voters, in more than twenty introductory pleadings (quotations or appeals)"&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [http://www.nomos-leattualitaneldiritto.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/maestri-2.pdf Gabriele Maestri, ''ORIZZONTI DI TECNICA ELETTORALE: PROBLEMI SUPERATI, IRRISOLTI ED EMERSI ALLA LUCE DELLA SENTENZA N. 35 DEL 2017'', Nomos, n. 2/2017].&lt;/ref&gt;, all of them brought [[pro bono]].

==China==
Public interest law (公益法, pronounced Gong Yi Fa) is an accepted term in China, where the basic institutions supporting the rule of law are still extremely nascent. China does not have a common-law system in which lawyers are expected to play a key role in “making law.”  Nevertheless, a small but effective community of lawyers has gained acceptance of public interest litigation as a legitimate means of resolving social issues and contributing to a harmonious society, and non-governmental actors have significantly improved the enforcement of rights for migrant workers, women, children and those suffering from environmental degradation, among others. For example, public interest lawyers in China have filed lawsuits in court successfully challenging workplace sexual harassment and the involuntary confinement of healthy people to mental hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional-Executive Commission on China, 2011 Annual Report, Parts II and III (October 10, 2011), available at {{cite web |url=http://www.cecc.gov/pages/annualRpt/annualRpt11/AR2011final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213223223/http://www.cecc.gov/pages/annualRpt/annualRpt11/AR2011final.pdf |archivedate=2013-02-13 |df= }}; see generally R.P. Peerenboom, China's Long March toward Rule of Law (Cambridge University Press, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese reformers believe that one avenue for speeding the development of public interest law is implementing an associational standing rule by which organizations can instigate lawsuits to protect the interests of its members. Currently, China’s Civil Procedure Law is undergoing revision. One of the proposed amendments would create a form of associational standing. In theory, the new law would give domestic NGOs the power to file lawsuits in their own name on behalf of their members, but the proposed amendment has engendered spirited debate and its fate is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Draft limits scale of class-action lawsuits|work= [[China Daily]]|date= April 24, 2012|url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-04/25/content_15131945.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hong Kong==
{{main|Public interest law in Hong Kong}}
In Hong Kong public interest law is an emerging field. The chief vehicle for pursuing public interest claims is judicial review. This is the process by which decisions of the government are challenged in the courts. There has been a surge in judicial review cases since 2000. Environmental issues&lt;ref&gt;See for example, [http://www.hklii.hk/cgi-bin/sinodisp/eng/hk/cases/hkcfa/2004/27.html?stem=&amp;synonyms=&amp;query=title(Society%20for%20Protection%20of%20the%20Harbour%20Ltd%20and%20Town%20Planning%20Board) Society for Protection of the Harbour Ltd v Town Planning Board] [2004] 1 HKLRD 396; [http://www.hklii.hk/cgi-bin/sinodisp/eng/hk/cases/hkcfi/2007/757.html?stem=&amp;synonyms=&amp;query=Clean%20Air%20Foundation%20Ltd Clean Air Foundation Ltd v The Government of the HKSAR] [2007] HKEC 1356.&lt;/ref&gt; and minority rights&lt;ref&gt;See for example, [http://www.hklii.hk/cgi-bin/sinodisp/eng/hk/cases/hkcfa/2013/39.html?stem=&amp;synonyms=&amp;query=title(W%20and%20Registrar%20of%20Marriages) W v Registrar of Marriages] [2013] HKCFA 39; [http://www.hklii.hk/cgi-bin/sinodisp/eng/hk/cases/hkcfa/2013/17.html?stem=&amp;synonyms=&amp;query=Vallejos%20Evangeline%20Banao Vallejos Evangeline Banao v Commissioner of Registration &amp; Anor] [2013] HKCFA 17.&lt;/ref&gt; are among the most litigated areas.

One of the pioneers in public interest law in Hong Kong was Pamela Baker. In the late 1980s she litigated a series of landmark courtroom cases challenging the government’s treatment of Vietnamese refugees.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Geoffrey. [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/apr/27/guardianobituaries ''"Pam Baker"''], ''"[[The Guardian]]"'', Saturday 27 April 2002. Retrieved 4 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 the [[Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor]] was established with the aim of promoting better human rights protection in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hkhrm.org.hk|title=基本法第廿三條|website=www.hkhrm.org.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the majority of [[Cause lawyering | cause lawyers]] who represent citizens and social groups in human rights and public policy litigation on a consistent basis in Hong Kong are also members of political parties or active participants in social movements outside the courts.&lt;ref&gt;Tam, Waikeung. ''"Political Transition and the Rise of Cause lawyering: The Case of Hong Kong"'' 3 [2010] 35 Law &amp; Social Inquiry 663, 664.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hong Kong, the [[Legal Aid Department]] provides funding to legal services for those who pass the means and merits test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lad.gov.hk/eng/las/overview.html|title=Legal Aid Department - Legal Aid Schemes - Overview|website=www.lad.gov.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two Legal Aid Schemes that it operates, namely the Ordinary Legal Aid Scheme (OLAS) and the Supplementary Legal Aid Scheme (SLAS) have facilitated the practice of public interest law through narrowing the resource inequality between economically disadvantaged litigants and the government.&lt;ref&gt;Tam, Waikeung. ''"Political Transition and the Rise of Cause Lawyering: The Case of Hong Kong"'' 3 [2010] 35 Law &amp; Social Inquiry 663, 673.&lt;/ref&gt; However, NGOs and charitable organizations are not eligible to get legal aid.&lt;ref name="karen"&gt;Kong, Karen. "Costs in Public Interest Litigation: Whose Pocket Should be Picked?" 39 HKLJ 767, 768.&lt;/ref&gt; The NGOs and Charitable organizations contributed to opening of avenues for people who deserved justice but lacked interest to approach courts and helped them in becoming petitioners to get justice.

Apart from legal aid, the [[Hong Kong Bar Association]] and [[The Law Society of Hong Kong]] jointly provides the Duty Lawyer Scheme which offers free legal representation to eligible defendants on the first day of court appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutylawyer.org.hk/en/duty/duty.asp|title=The Duty Lawyer Service : Duty Lawyer Scheme : The Duty Lawyer Scheme|website=www.dutylawyer.org.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also run the Free Legal Advice Scheme at their Legal Advice Centres within nine District Offices in Hong Kong with the aim to provide one-off preliminary legal advice to the general public without imposing any means test.&lt;ref name="duty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutylawyer.org.hk/en/free/free.asp|title=The Duty Lawyer Service : Free Legal Advice Scheme : Free Legal Advice Scheme|website=www.dutylawyer.org.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hong Kong Bar Association and The Law Society of Hong Kong operate their own Bar Free Legal Service Scheme&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hkba.org/the-bar/free-legal-service/ archived] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407073406/http://www.hkba.org/the-bar/free-legal-service/ |date=2014-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Free Legal Consultation Scheme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.choosehklawyer.org/en/search_fl_start.asp|title=ChooseHKLawyer|website=www.choosehklawyer.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively where enrolled law firms and barristers specializing in different fields volunteer to give consultations on a pro bono basis.&lt;ref name="chung"&gt;Chung, Eugenie. "Why Hong Kong Needs a Pro Bono Clearinghouse" 40 [2010] HKLJ 719, 731-732.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, unlike in the United States where NGOs and public interest law groups routinely bring public interest lawsuits on behalf of aggrieved individuals, in-house counsel working in NGOs and charities in Hong Kong are not allowed to directly represent the people these organizations serve.&lt;ref&gt;Precht, Robert.

"Public Interest Litigation" or PIL right since its inception in the Indian judicial system,&lt;ref name="Mother of PIL"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rajagopal|first1=Krishnadas|title=Starting the PIL revolution|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/starting-the-pil-revolution/571616/|accessdate=7 December 2014|work=The Indian Express|date=26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; has shown some good examples of safeguarding the rights of the people of India and has strengthened the position of the [[Supreme Court of India]] as preeminent guardian of Fundamental Rights enumerated in the [[Indian Constitution]]. It was introduced in India around 1979-80 by the Supreme Court judges, Justice [[V. R. Krishna Iyer]] along with Justice [[P. N. Bhagwati]]. And since then there had been instances when the Courts are keen to decide the matters of public importance without delay, as the case in Shyam sundar where the court accepted the matter even when the application was made by a letter sent through post.

“Public interest law” is a term that became widely adopted in the United States during and after the social turmoil of the 1960s. It built on a tradition exemplified by [[Louis Brandeis]], who before becoming a U.S. Supreme Court justice incorporated advocacy for the interests of the general public into his legal practice. In a celebrated 1905 speech, Brandeis decried the legal profession, complaining that “able lawyers have to a large extent allowed themselves to become adjuncts of great corporations and have neglected their obligation to use their powers for the protection of the people.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pilnet.org/component/docman/doc_download/35-pursuing-the-public-interest-a-handbook-for-legal.html Edwin Rekosh, et al.,ed. "Pursuing the Public Interest, A Handbook for Legal Professionals and Activists"] (Scott L. Cummings, The Politics of Pro Bono, 52 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 13-14 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s and 1970s, large numbers of American law school graduates began to seek “relevance” in their work—wishing to affect the social issues that were so visibly and hotly debated within American society at that time. They defined themselves as public interest lawyers in order to distinguish themselves from the “corporate adjuncts” referred to by Brandeis.&lt;ref&gt;Rekosh, supra; See also Joel F. Handler, Ellen Jane Hollingsworth &amp; Howard S. Erlanger, Lawyers and the Pursuit of Legal Rights 24-39 (1978); Note, The New Public Interest lawyers, 79 Yale L.J. 1069, 1069-70 (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

Summing up the movement's history in the United States, Stanford University Law Professor Deborah Rhode writes: "Public interest lawyers have saved lives, protected fundamental rights, established crucial principles, transformed institutions, and ensured essential benefits for those who need them most....In virtually every major American social reform movement of the last half century, public interest lawyers have played an important role."&lt;ref&gt;Deborah L.Rhode, Public Interest Law: the Movement and Midlife, 60 Stan.L.Rev. 1, 13-14 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
Public interest law is institutionalized in the United States(USA). Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that work to promote and protect human rights using the U.S. legal system, fight to protect the environment, or advocate on behalf of consumers, call themselves public interest law organizations. A large community of lawyers practices public interest law in the form of providing [[legal aid]] free of charge to those who cannot afford to pay for it. However, the grim reality remains that lawyers are underpaid and grossly overworked,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Andrew|title=How Americans Lost the Right to Counsel, 50 Years After 'Gideon' (March, 2013)|url=http://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/how-americans-lost-right-counsel-50-years-after-gideon|publisher=The Brennan Center for Justice (NYU School of Law)|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; offering perfunctory representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bright|first1=Stephen B.|last2=Sanneh|first2=Sia M.|title=Fifty Years of Defiance and Resistance After Gideon v.

Some law schools have public interest law centers, which advise law students interested in pursuing public interest law careers. [[Pro bono]] programs at bar associations and law firms provide opportunities for commercial lawyers to donate time to public interest law activities.&lt;ref name=Cummings/&gt;

==United Kingdom(UK)==
In law, public interest is a defence against certain lawsuits (for instance some [[libel]] suits in the United Kingdom) and an exemption from certain laws or regulations (for instance [[freedom of information]] laws in the UK). Also, judges in [[common law]] systems can make judgements on the grounds of [[public policy (law)|public policy]], a related term.

{{Rape}}
In 2004, the incidence of rapes recorded by the police in [[Belgium]] was 28.4 per 100,000 people, according to data by [[UNODC]]; in 2008 it was 29.5 per 100,000 people.&lt;ref name="unodc1"&gt;http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/Crime-statistics/Sexual_violence_sv_against_children_and_rape.xls&lt;/ref&gt; Belgium has been reported as being one of the countries with the highest rate of [[rape]].&lt;ref name="ibtimes1"&gt;{{cite web|author=March 17, 2014 10:35 GMT |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/belgium-sexual-harassment-punished-imprisonment-under-new-law-1440582 |title=Belgium: Sexual Harassment Punished With Imprisonment Under New Law |publisher=Ibtimes.co.uk |date=2012-02-16 |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==

Rape in Belgium is defined by Article 375 of the Penal Code as "any act of sexual penetration, of whatever sort and by whatever means, committed on a non-consenting person".&lt;ref name="unwomen1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/searchDetail.action?measureId=10080&amp;baseHREF=country&amp;baseHREFId=213 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318212005/http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/searchDetail.action?measureId=10080&amp;baseHREF=country&amp;baseHREFId=213 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-03-18 |title=The Secretary Generals database on violence against women |publisher=Sgdatabase.unwomen.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/loi_a1.pl?DETAIL=1867060801%2FF&amp;caller=list&amp;row_id=1&amp;numero=2&amp;rech=4&amp;cn=1867060801&amp;table_name=LOI&amp;nm=1867060850&amp;la=F&amp;dt=CODE+PENAL&amp;language=fr&amp;fr=f&amp;choix1=ET&amp;choix2=ET&amp;fromtab=loi_all&amp;trier=promulgation&amp;chercher=t&amp;sql=dt+contains++%27CODE%27%26+%27PENAL%27and+actif+%3D+%27Y%27&amp;tri=dd+AS+RANK+&amp;imgcn.x=41&amp;imgcn.y=12 |title=Loi - Wet |publisher=Ejustice.just.fgov.be |date= |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marital rape is also illegal under this law.&lt;ref name="unwomen1"/&gt;

Apart from criminal proceedings, committing marital rape has also consequences in a [[divorce]] case. The new amendments to the Civil Code regulating marriage and divorce, that came into effect in September 2007, state that any of the spouses, following a divorce, may receive [[alimony]] if they need the money, but a spouse who has committed rape or other violent crimes against the other spouse cannot receive alimony. Article 301 reads: &lt;blockquote&gt;The court may refuse to grant the application for a alimony if the defendant proves that the applicant has committed a serious offense that rendered it impossible to continue living together. Under no circumstances will alimony be given to a spouse who was found guilty of an act referred to in '''Articles 375''', 398-400, 402, 403 or 405 of the Penal Code, committed against the person of the defendant, or an attempt to commit an act referred to in '''Articles 375''', 393, 394 or 397 of the Code against the same person.&lt;ref&gt;Text in French: "Le tribunal peut refuser de faire droit à la demande de pension si le défendeur prouve que le demandeur a commis une faute grave ayant rendu impossible la poursuite de la vie commune. En aucun cas, la pension alimentaire n'est accordée au conjoint reconnu coupable d'un fait visé aux articles 375, 398 à 400, 402, 403 ou 405 du Code pénal, commis contre la personne du défendeur, ou d'une tentative de commettre un fait visé aux articles 375, 393, 394 ou 397 du même Code contre cette même personne."[http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/loi_a1.pl?DETAIL=1804032130%2FF&amp;caller=list&amp;row_id=1&amp;numero=11&amp;rech=14&amp;cn=1804032130&amp;table_name=LOI&amp;nm=1804032150&amp;la=F&amp;dt=CODE+CIVIL&amp;language=fr&amp;fr=f&amp;choix1=ET&amp;choix2=ET&amp;fromtab=loi_all&amp;trier=promulgation&amp;chercher=t&amp;sql=dt+contains++%27CODE%27%26+%27CIVIL%27and+actif+%3D+%27Y%27&amp;tri=dd+AS+RANK+&amp;imgcn.x=34&amp;imgcn.y=10]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Prevalence==

In 2011, Belgian Institute for the Equality of Women and Men published a report on "Women and men in Belgium", which noted that in 2008, according to police report, 87% of victims of rape (89% for collective rape) were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.womenlobby.org/spip.php?action=acceder_document&amp;arg=3144&amp;cle=008f9546f38740223b896ddf3b19887af14efb64&amp;file=pdf%2F2714_belgium_lr.pdf |format=PDF |title=NATIONAL ANALYSIS Belgium |publisher=womenlobby.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey, carried out by Belgian Institute and titled ''Experience of men and women in gender based violence'', included the following figures;

According to ''[[De Morgen]]'', from 2009 and 2011 the number of reported rape cases increased from 3,360 to 4,038, an increase of more than 20 percent.&lt;ref name="ibtimes1"/&gt;

According to a report by ''[[De Standaard]]'', the sentences for rape is considerably lower than it is usually expected. For example, a person who had raped his 13-year-old stepdaughter was sentenced to 2.5 years. In another case, the criminal was sentenced to two years for repeated rape of two girls younger than 15; one of the victims was pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Practical Ethics |url=http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2011/05/belgium-where-rapists-and-muffin-thieves-are-treated-alike/ |title=Belgium: where rapists and muffin thieves are treated alike &amp;#124; Practical Ethics |publisher=Blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk |date=2011-05-13 |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sensory design''' aims to establish an overall diagnosis of the [[Sense|sensory perceptions]] of a product, and define appropriate means to [[design]] or redesign it on that basis. It involves an observation of the diverse and varying situations in which a given product or object is used in order to measure the users' overall opinion of the product, its positive and negative aspects in terms of [[Somatosensory system|tactility]], [[Visual perception|appearance]], [[Hearing (sense)|sound]] and so on.

Sensory assessment aims to quantify and describe, in a systematic manner, all human [[Perception#Types|perceptions]] when confronted with a product or object. Contrary to traditional laboratory analysis, a sensory analysis of a product is either carried out by a panel of  [[Psychological testing|trained testers]], or by specialized test equipment designed to mimic the perception of humans.

The result allows researchers to establish a list of specifications and to set out a precise and quantified requirement. These are applied to materials and objects using various criteria:
* [[Somatosensory system|Touch]], textures, compliance, friction.
* [[Visual system|Vision]] color, luminosity, shape, pattern.
* [[Sound]]s and [[:wiki:movement|movement]]s made when a product is handled;
* [[Olfaction|Smell]];
* [[Taste]];
* [[Temperature]] and perceived thermal properties

==Use in Transportation==
In the [[transport]]ation sphere, these two branches of [[sensory analysis]] translate into sometimes minor enhancements to the design for a vehicle interior, information system, or station environment to smooth some of the rougher edges of the travel experience.&lt;ref name="Railway"&gt;{{cite web | last=Kingsley | first=Nick | title=Railway Gazette: Sensolab drives interior experimentation | url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/sensolab-drives-interior-experimentation.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, specialized air purifying equipment can be used to design a more pleasant odor.&lt;ref name="Interior"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leone|first1=Catherine|title=Come to Your Senses|url=http://www.iida.org/content.cfm/come-to-your-senses|website=International Interior Design Association|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in Food and Beverage==
Sensory design plays a critical role the modern food and beverage industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moskowitz|first1=Howard|title=Sensory and Consumer Research in Food Product Design and Development|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-8138-1366-0|edition=2|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0813813662.html|date=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The food and beverage industry attempts to maintain specific sensory experiences. In addition to smell and flavor, the color of food (e.g. ripe fruits),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mendoza|first1=Fernando|title=Calibrated color measurements of agricultural foods using image analysis|journal=Postharvest Biology and Technology|volume=41|issue=3|pages=285–295|doi=10.1016/j.postharvbio.2006.04.004|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925521406001116|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and texture of food (e.g. potato chips) are critical. Even the environment is important as "Color affects the appetite, in essence, the taste of food".&lt;ref name="Interior" /&gt;

==Sensory Design Technologies==
While classically limited to the perception of trained sensory experts, advances in sensors and computation have allowed objective quantified measurements of sensory information to be acquired, quantified and communicated leading to improved design communication, translation from prototype to production, and quality assurance. Sensory areas that have been objectively quantified include vision, touch, and smell.

===Vision===
In vision both light and color are considered in sensory design. Early [[light meter]]s (called extinction meters) relied on the human eye to gauge and quantify the [[Luminosity function|amount of light]]. Subsequently, analog and digital light meters have been popularized for photography. Work by Lawrence Herbert in the 1960s lead to a systematic combination of lighting and color samples required to quantify colors by human eye. This became the basis for the [[pantone|Pantone Matching System]]. Combining this with specialized light meters allowed digital color meters to be invented and popularized.

===Touch===
Touch plays an important role in a variety of products and is increasingly considered in product design and marketing efforts and has led to a more scientific approach to tactile design and marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spence|first1=Charles|title=Multisensory design: Reaching out to touch the consumer|journal=Psychology and Marketing|date=3 March 2015|volume=28|issue=3|pages=267–308|doi=10.1002/mar.20392|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229911988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical the field of tribology has developed various tests to evaluate interacting surfaces in relative motion with a focus on measuring friction, lubrication, and wear. However these measurements do not correlate with human

'''Something''' and '''anything''' are [[concept]]s of [[existence]] in [[ontology]], contrasting with the concept of [[nothing]]. Both are used to describe the understanding that what exists is not [[nothing]] without needing to address the existence of [[everything]]. The philosopher, [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]], has pointed out that these are necessarily vague terms, asserting that "ontological assertions of common sense are correct if the quantifiers—such words as "something" and "anything"—are restricted roughly to ordinary or familiar things."&lt;ref&gt;Eli Hirsch, ''Quantifier Variance and Realism: Essays in Metaontology'' (2011), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that "something" is the opposite of "nothing" has existed at least since it was proposed by the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] philosopher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] in the 3rd century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iamblichus]], ''Fragments of Iamblichus' Commentary on the Timaeus'', John Myles Dillon trans. (1973), p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most basic questions of both science and philosophy is: why is there something rather than nothing at all?&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', Tyron Goldschmidt, ed., ''The Puzzle of Existence: Why Is There Something Rather Than Nothing?'' (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; A question that follows from this is whether it is ever actually possible for there to be nothing at all, or whether there must always be something.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', D. M. Armstrong, ''Truth and Truthmakers'' (2004), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grammatically, "''something'' and ''anything'' are commonly classified as [[pronouns]], although they do not stand for another noun so clearly as does ''[[object (philosophy)|thing]]'' itself, a word always classified as a noun".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Eustis Morsberger, Janet Rankin Aiken, ''Commonsense Grammar and Style'' (1975), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In predicate logic==
{{Main|Existential quantification}}
In [[predicate logic]], what is described in layman's terms as "something" can more specifically be regarded as [[existential quantification]], that is, the predication of a property or relation to at least one member of the domain. It is a type of [[Quantification (logic)|quantifier]], a [[logical constant]] which is [[interpretation (logic)|interpreted]] as "there exists," "there is at least one," or "for some." It expresses that a [[propositional function]] can be [[satisfiability|satisfied]] by at least one [[element (mathematics)|member]] of a [[domain of discourse]]. In other terms, it is the [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predication]] of a [[property (philosophy)|property]] or [[binary relation|relation]]  to at least one member of the domain. It [[logical assertion|asserts]] that a predicate within the [[free variables and bound variables|scope]] of an existential quantifier is true of at least one [[Valuation (logic)|value]] of a [[predicate variable]].

==Nothing and something==
{{unsourced-section|date=March 2017}}
Though considered to exclude one another, the concepts of something and nothing can coincide under special circumstances. One example would be when a person says "I am doing nothing"; they are really doing ''something'', because it is physically and mentally impossible to do nothing. At the specific level, nothing can be used as a label describing something. The requirement is that the nothing equates to ''not changing the outcome''. For instance, when hiking up and down a mountain, the trip can be expressed in increments of height. Climbing the mountain, the increments can be described as pluses (as in positive increases) and when descending the increments are described as minuses (negative increases). Yet walking around at the top of a mountain, one does not ascend or descend, and the increments are neither positive nor negative. Nothing in height was added or subtracted when reviewing these specific moments during the mountain climb.

This reality of nothing can only occur as a subset of somethings. In the example above, the somethings can be seen as the mountain and the person climbing the mountain. Next, the nothing can be recognized as a something, but again only as part of the subset of the exercise, since ''walking around'' can be referred to as doing something while the exercise adds nor subtracts anything in height.

To set nothing correctly apart from something, one must declare the specific level at which the something and the nothing are articulated. Both are therefore not only declared by their own definition but need to be declared within a larger reality as well. Without declaring the overall setting — and this brings us to the overall level that [[Gödel]] already explored — it becomes difficult to declare whether we're talking about a tree or about a forest, particularly where ''nothing'' is concerned.

==Anything==
{{unsourced-section|date=March 2017}}
Often pronounced in a way that indicates evading specifics, ''anything'' provides full freedom about the something that is supposedly covered by the word. "Anything goes" indicates maximization of freedom, just like "Do as you please" means there are no restrictions other than the restrictions put in place by oneself.

One can make the statement that ''anything'' is a specific word where ''everything'' can be seen as a general word. Still, both meanings may readily be understood by everyone, while their definitions will equally contain some aspects of murkiness as to what is included and what is not. First of all, ''anything'' does not need to be covered by an actual something, since an act of god or fate, a coincident or an unintended consequence can also be included in the list of ''anything''. Also, the question whether an ''actual'' nothing can also be used to take up the place of ''anything'' is harder to debate at the abstract level and requires actual input to declare whether this is true or false.  Examples of this position are that not the amount of money, but rather the lack of money can make us rise and shine early from bed to go to work, and that not the abundance of food, but rather hunger and the lack of food make us hunt and till the soil. See also: [[Much Ado About Nothing]].

==Singular and plural somethings==
{{unsourced-section|date=March 2017}}
Since words are abstracts and are actualized only through the action of understanding, an interesting distinction exists between singular somethings and plural somethings. When describing a single object or describing more than one object in an action of, for instance, ''breaking something'', the verb is conjugated differently. In "The glass ''was'' broken" and "The glasses ''were'' broken," the verb ''to be'' is conjugated differently according to the singular or plural reality described. However, when using a singular word describing multiple items, the verb is (correctly) conjugated as if this were a singular entity: "The collection ''was'' destroyed" and not "The collection ''were'' destroyed."

The example shows that plural somethings can be presented as singular somethings. Actual ''somethings'' can therefore as shown above be hidden under the banner of an abstract ''something''. Some claim to have evidence that a singular something does not occur in actuality at the overall level ever, and that a singular overall truth can only exist correctly at the abstract level in our minds. As such, the concept of ''something'' would then also have a direct correlation to the concept of ''everything'' just as this exists for the concept of ''nothing''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29049">In [[Radio-frequency engineering|radio engineering]] and [[telecommunication]]s, '''standing wave ratio''' ('''SWR''') is a measure of [[impedance matching]] of [[Electrical load|load]]s to the [[characteristic impedance]] of a [[transmission line]] or [[waveguide]]. Impedance mismatches result in [[standing wave]]s along the transmission line, and SWR is defined as the ratio of the partial [[standing wave]]'s amplitude at an antinode (maximum) to the amplitude at a [[node (physics)|node]] (minimum) along the line.

The SWR is usually thought of in terms of the  maximum and minimum AC [[voltage]]s along the transmission line, thus called the  '''voltage standing wave ratio''' or '''VSWR''' (sometimes pronounced "vizwar"&lt;ref name="Knott"&gt;

For example, the VSWR value 1.2:1 denotes an AC voltage due to standing waves along the transmission line reaching a peak value 1.2 times that of the minimum AC voltage along that line. The SWR can as well be defined as the ratio of the maximum amplitude to minimum amplitude of the transmission line's [[Current (electricity)|current]]s, [[electric field strength]], or the magnetic field strength. Neglecting transmission line loss, these ratios are identical.

The '''power standing wave ratio''' ('''PSWR''') is defined as the square of the VSWR,&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Silver, ''Microwave Antenna Theory and Design'', p. 28, IEE, 1984 (originally published 1949) {{ISBN|0863410170}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this deprecated terminology has no physical relation to actual powers involved in transmission.

SWR is usually measured using a dedicated instrument called an [[SWR meter]]. Since SWR is a measure of the load impedance relative to the characteristic impedance of the transmission line in use (which together determine the [[reflection coefficient]] as described [[#Relationship to the reflection coefficient|below]]), a given SWR meter can only interpret the impedance it sees in terms of SWR if it has been designed for that particular characteristic impedance. In practice most transmission lines used in these applications are [[coaxial cables]] with an impedance of either 50 or 75 [[ohm]]s, so most SWR meters correspond to one of these.

Checking the SWR is a standard procedure in a radio station. Although the same information could be obtained by measuring the load's impedance with an [[impedance analyzer]] (or "impedance bridge"), the SWR meter is simpler and more robust for this purpose. By measuring the magnitude of the impedance mismatch at the transmitter output it reveals problems due to either the antenna or the transmission line.

==Impedance matching==
{{Main|Impedance matching}}
SWR is used as a measure of [[impedance matching]] of a load to the [[characteristic impedance]] of a transmission line carrying [[radio frequency]] (RF) signals. This especially applies to transmission lines connecting [[transmitter|radio transmitters]] and receivers with their [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]s, as well as similar uses of RF cables such as [[cable television]] connections to TV receivers and [[distribution amplifier]]s. Impedance matching is achieved when the source impedance is the [[complex conjugate]] of the load impedance. The easiest way of achieving this, and the way that minimizes losses along the transmission line, is for both the source and load to be [[complex numbers|real]], that is, pure resistances, equal to the characteristic impedance of the transmission line. When there is a mismatch between the load impedance and the transmission line, part of the forward wave sent toward the load is reflected back along the transmission line towards the source. The source then sees a different impedance than it expects which can lead to lesser (or in some cases, more) power being supplied by it, the result being very sensitive to the [[electrical length]] of the transmission line.

Such a mismatch is usually undesired and results in [[standing waves]] along the transmission line which magnifies transmission line losses (significant at higher frequencies and for longer cables).  The SWR is a measure of the depth of those standing waves and is, therefore, a measure of the matching of the load to the transmission line. A matched load would result in an SWR of 1:1 implying no reflected wave.  An infinite SWR represents complete reflection by a load unable to absorb electrical power, with all the incident power reflected back towards the source.

It should be understood that the match of a load to the transmission line is different from the match of a ''source'' to the transmission line or the match of a source to the load ''seen through'' the transmission line. For instance, if there is a perfect match between the load impedance ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;load&lt;/sub&gt; and the source impedance ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;source&lt;/sub&gt;=''Z''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;load&lt;/sub&gt;, that perfect match will remain if the source and load are connected through a transmission line with an electrical length of one half wavelength (or a multiple of one half wavelengths) using a transmission line of ''any'' characteristic impedance ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. However the SWR will generally not be 1:1, depending only on ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;load&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. With a different length of transmission line, the source will see a different impedance than ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;load&lt;/sub&gt; which may or may not be a good match to the source. Sometimes this is deliberate, as when a [[Quarter-wave impedance transformer|quarter-wave matching section]] is used to improve the match between an otherwise mismatched source and load.

However typical [[radio frequency|RF]] sources such as transmitters and signal generators are designed to look into a purely resistive load impedance such as 50Ω or 75Ω, corresponding to common transmission lines' characteristic impedances. In those cases, matching the load to the transmission line, ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;load&lt;/sub&gt;=''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''always'' ensures that the source will see the same load impedance as if the transmission line weren't there. This is identical to a 1:1 SWR. This condition ( ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;load&lt;/sub&gt;=''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) also means that the load seen by the source is independent of the transmission line's electrical length. Since the electrical length of a physical segment of transmission line depends on the signal frequency, violation of this condition means that the impedance seen by the source through the transmission line becomes a function of frequency (especially if the line is long), even if ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;load&lt;/sub&gt; is frequency-independent. So in practice, a good SWR (near 1:1) implies a transmitter's output seeing the exact impedance it expects for optimum and safe operation.

==Relationship to the reflection coefficient==
[[File:Standing wave 2.gif|thumb|350px|right|Incident wave (blue) is fully reflected (red wave) out of phase at short-circuited end of transmission line, creating a net voltage (black) standing wave. Γ = −1, SWR = ∞.]]
[[File:StandingWaves-3.png|thumb|500px|right|Standing waves on transmission line, net voltage shown in different colors during one period of oscillation. Incoming wave from left (amplitude = 1) is partially reflected with (top to bottom) Γ = 0.6, −0.333, and 0.8 ∠60°. Resulting SWR = 4, 2, 9.]]
The voltage component of a standing wave in a uniform [[transmission line]] consists of the forward wave (with [[Phasor|complex]] amplitude &lt;math&gt;V_f&lt;/math&gt;) superimposed on the reflected wave (with complex amplitude &lt;math&gt;V_r&lt;/math&gt;).

A wave is partly reflected when a transmission line is terminated with other than an impedance equal to its [[characteristic impedance]].  The [[reflection coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \frac{V_r}{V_f}.&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = {Z_L - Z_O\over Z_L + Z_O}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a [[complex number]] that describes both the magnitude and the phase shift of the reflection.  The simplest cases with &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; ''measured at the load'' are:
* &lt;math&gt;\Gamma = -1&lt;/math&gt;: complete negative reflection, when the line is short-circuited,
* &lt;math&gt;\Gamma = 0&lt;/math&gt;: no reflection, when the line is perfectly matched,
* &lt;math&gt;\Gamma = +1&lt;/math&gt;: complete positive reflection, when the line is open-circuited.

The SWR directly corresponds to the [[magnitude (mathematics)#Complex numbers|magnitude]] of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;.

At some points along the line the forward and reflected waves [[Interference (wave propagation)|interfere]] constructively, exactly in phase, with the resulting amplitude &lt;math&gt;V_\text{max}&lt;/math&gt; given by the sum of their those waves' amplitudes:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  |V_\text{max}| &amp;= |V_f| + |V_r| \\
                 &amp;= |V_f| + |\Gamma V_f| \\
                 &amp;= (1 + |\Gamma|) |V_f|.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

At other points, the waves interfere 180° out of phase with the amplitudes partially cancelling:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  |V_\text{min}| &amp;= |V_f| - |V_r| \\
                 &amp;= |V_f| - |\Gamma V_f| \\
                 &amp;= (1 - |\Gamma|) |V_f|.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The voltage standing wave ratio is then

:&lt;math&gt;\text{VSWR} = \frac{|V_\text{max}|}{|V_\text{min}|} = \frac{1 + |\Gamma|}{1 - |\Gamma|}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the magnitude of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; always falls in the range [0,1], the SWR is always greater than or equal to unity. Note that the ''phase'' of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; vary along the transmission line in opposite directions to each other. Therefore, the complex-valued reflection coefficient &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; varies as well, but only in phase. With the SWR dependent ''only'' on the complex magnitude of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, it can be seen that the SWR measured at ''any'' point along the transmission line (neglecting transmission line losses) obtains an identical reading.

Since the power of the forward and reflected waves are proportional to the square of the voltage components due to each wave, SWR can be expressed in terms of forward and reflected power:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{SWR} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{P_r/P_f}}{1 - \sqrt{P_r/P_f}}.&lt;/math&gt;

By sampling the complex voltage and current at the point of insertion, an SWR meter is able to compute the effective forward and reflected voltages on the transmission line for the characteristic impedance for which the SWR meter has been designed. Since the forward and reflected power is related to the square of the forward and reflected voltages, some SWR meters also display the forward and reflected power.

In the special case of a load ''R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'', which is purely resistive but unequal to the characteristic impedance of the transmission line ''Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', the SWR is given simply by their ratio:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{SWR} = \left(\frac{R_\text{L}}{Z_\text{0}}\right)^{\pm 1}&lt;/math&gt;

with the ±1 chosen to obtain a value greater than unity.

==The standing wave pattern==
Using [[phasor|complex]] notation for the voltage amplitudes, for a signal at frequency ν, the actual (real) voltages V&lt;sub&gt;actual&lt;/sub&gt; as a function of time ''t'' are understood to relate to the complex voltages according to:

:&lt;math&gt; V_\text{actual} = \Re (e^{i 2 \pi \nu t} V) &lt;/math&gt; .

Thus taking the real part of the complex quantity inside the parenthesis, the actual voltage consists of a [[sine wave]] at frequency ν with a peak amplitude equal to the complex magnitude of V, and with a phase given by the phase of the complex V. Then with the position along a transmission line given by x, with the line ending in a load located at x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the complex amplitudes of the forward and reverse waves would be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  V_f(x) &amp;= e^{-i k(x-x_0)} A \\
  V_r(x) &amp;= \Gamma e^{i k(x-x_0)} A
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

for some complex amplitude A (corresponding to the forward wave at x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;). Here ''k'' is the [[wavenumber]] due to the guided wavelength along the transmission line. Note that some treatments use phasors where the time dependence is according to &lt;math&gt;e^{-i 2 \pi \nu t}&lt;/math&gt; and spatial dependence (for a wave in the +x direction) of &lt;math&gt;e^{+i k(x - x_0)}&lt;/math&gt;. Either convention obtains the same result for V&lt;sub&gt;actual&lt;/sub&gt;.

According to the [[superposition principle]] the net voltage present at any point x on the transmission line is equal to the sum of the voltages due to the forward and reflected waves:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  V_\text{net}(x) &amp;= V_f(x) + V_r(x) \\
                  &amp;= e^{-i k(x - x_0)} \left( 1 + \Gamma e^{i 2k(x - x_0)}\right ) A
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Since we are interested in the variations of the ''magnitude'' of V&lt;sub&gt;net&lt;/sub&gt; along the line (as a function of x), we shall solve instead for the squared magnitude of that quantity, which simplifies the mathematics. To obtain the squared magnitude we multiply the above quantity by its complex conjugate:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  |V_\text{net}(x)|^2 &amp;= V_\text{net}(x)  V^*_\text{net}(x) \\
                 &amp;= e^{-i k(x - x_0)} \left(1 + \Gamma e^{i 2k(x - x_0)}\right) A \,  e^{+i k(x - x_0)} \left(1 + \Gamma^* e^{-i 2k(x - x_0)}\right) A^* \\
                 &amp;= \left[1 + |\Gamma|^2 + 2 \Re (\Gamma  e^{i 2k(x - x_0)})\right] |A|^2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Depending on the phase of the third term, the maximum and minimum values of V&lt;sub&gt;net&lt;/sub&gt; (the square root of the quantity in the equations) are (1 + |Γ|)|A| and (1 − |Γ|)|A| respectively, for a standing wave ratio of:

:&lt;math&gt; \text{SWR} =  \frac{|V_\text{max}|}{|V_\text{min}|}  = \frac{1 + |\Gamma|}{1 - |\Gamma|}&lt;/math&gt;

as earlier asserted. Along the line, the above expression for &lt;math&gt; |V_\text{net}(x)|^2&lt;/math&gt; is seen to oscillate sinusoidally between &lt;math&gt;|V_\text{min}|^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|V_\text{max}|^2&lt;/math&gt; with a period of 2π/2k. This is ''half'' of the guided wavelength λ = 2π/k for the frequency ν. That can be seen as due to interference between two waves of that frequency which are travelling in ''opposite'' directions.

For example, at a frequency ν=20&amp;nbsp;MHz (free space wavelength of 15 m) in a transmission line whose [[velocity factor]] is 2/3, the guided wavelength (distance between voltage peaks of the forward wave alone) would be λ = 10 m. At instances when the forward wave at x = 0 is at zero phase (peak voltage) then at x = 10 m it would also be at zero phase, but at x = 5 m it would be at 180° phase (peak ''negative'' voltage). On the other hand, the magnitude of the voltage due to a standing wave produced by its addition to a reflected wave, would have a wavelength between peaks of only λ/2 = 5 m. Depending on the location of the load and phase of reflection, there might be a peak in the magnitude of V&lt;sub&gt;net&lt;/sub&gt; at x = 1.3 m. Then there would be another peak found where  |V&lt;sub&gt;net&lt;/sub&gt;|=V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; at x = 6.3 m, whereas it would find minima of the standing wave  |V&lt;sub&gt;net&lt;/sub&gt;| = V&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; at x = 3.8 m, 8.8 m, etc.

==Practical implications of SWR==
The most common case for measuring and examining SWR is when installing and tuning transmitting [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]s.  When a transmitter is connected to an antenna by a [[feed line]], the [[Antenna (radio)#Impedance|driving point impedance]] of the antenna must match the characteristic impedance of the feed line in order for the transmitter to see the impedance it was designed for (the impedance of the feed line, usually 50 or 75 ohms).

The impedance of a particular antenna design can vary due to a number of factors that cannot always be clearly identified. This includes the transmitter frequency (as compared to the antenna's design or [[Antenna (radio)#Resonant frequency|resonant]] frequency), the antenna's height above the ground and proximity to large metal structures, and variations in the exact size of the conductors used to construct the antenna.&lt;ref name="ARRL20.2"&gt;{{cite book

When an antenna and feed line do not have matching impedances, the transmitter sees an unexpected impedance, where it might not be able to produce its full power, and can even damage the transmitter in some cases.&lt;ref name="ARRL19.4"&gt;{{cite book

The reflected power in the transmission line increases the average current and therefore losses in the transmission line compared to power actually delivered to the load.&lt;ref name="QST"&gt;{{cite journal

It is the interaction of these reflected waves with forward waves which causes standing wave patterns,&lt;ref name="ARRL19.4" /&gt; with the negative repercussions we have noted.&lt;ref name="ARRL19.13"&gt;{{cite book

Matching the impedance of the antenna to the impedance of the feed line can sometimes be accomplished through adjusting the antenna itself, but otherwise is possible using an [[antenna tuner]], an impedance matching device. Installing the tuner between the feed line and the antenna allows for the feed line to see a load close to its characteristic impedance, while sending most of the transmitter's power (a small amount may be dissipated within the tuner) to be radiated by the antenna despite its otherwise unacceptable feed point impedance. Installing a tuner in between the transmitter and the feed line can also transform the impedance seen at the transmitter end of the feed line to one preferred by the transmitter. However, in the latter case, the feed line still has a high SWR present, with the resulting increased feed line losses unmitigated.

The magnitude of those losses are dependent on the type of transmission line, and its length. They always increase with frequency. For example, a certain antenna used well away from its resonant frequency may have an SWR of 6:1. For a frequency of 3.5&amp;nbsp;MHz, with that antenna fed through 75 meters of RG-8A coax, the loss due to standing waves would be 2.2&amp;nbsp;dB. However the same 6:1 mismatch through 75 meters of RG-8A coax would incur 10.8&amp;nbsp;dB of loss at 146&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref name="ARRL19.4" /&gt; Thus, a better match of the antenna to the feed line, that is, a lower SWR, becomes increasingly important with increasing frequency, even if the transmitter is able to accommodate the impedance seen (or an antenna tuner is used between the transmitter and feed line).

Certain types of transmissions can suffer other negative effects from reflected waves on a transmission line.  Analog TV can experience "ghosts" from delayed signals bouncing back and forth on a long line.  FM stereo can also be affected and digital signals can experience delayed pulses leading to bit errors. Whenever the delay times for a signal going back down and then again up the line are comparable to the modulation time constants, effects occur.  For this reason, these types of transmissions require a low SWR on the feedline, even if SWR induced loss might be acceptable and matching is done at the transmitter.

==Methods of measuring standing wave ratio==



[[File:Slotted_line.png|200px|thumb|Slotted line. The probe moves along the line to measure the variable voltage. SWR is the maximum divided by the minimum voltage]]Many different methods can be used to measure standing wave ratio.  The most intuitive method uses a [[slotted line]] which is a section of transmission line with an open slot which allows a probe to detect the actual voltage at various points along the line.&lt;ref&gt;Fredrick E. Terman, ''Electronic Measurements'', McGraw Hill, 1952 Library of Congress Catalog Number: 51-12650 p.135ff&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the maximum and minimum values can be compared directly. This method is used at VHF and higher frequencies. At lower frequencies, such lines are impractically long.


[[Power dividers and directional couplers|Directional couplers]] can be used at HF through microwave frequencies. Some are a quarter wave or more long, which restricts their use to the higher frequencies. Other types of directional couplers sample the current and voltage at a single point in the transmission path and mathematically combine them in such a way as to represent the power flowing in one direction.&lt;ref name="Schulz"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/9778/how-does-an-swr-meter-really-work/9779#9779|title=How Does an SWR Meter Really Work|work=Glenn B. Schulz W9IQ |date= January 24, 2018|accessdate=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The common type of  SWR/power meter used in amateur operation may contain a dual directional coupler. Other types use a single coupler which can be rotated 180 degrees to sample power flowing in either direction. Unidirectional couplers of this type are available for many frequency ranges  and  power levels and with appropriate coupling values for the analog meter used.[[File:Bird 43 RF power meter.jpg|300px|thumb|A directional wattmeter using a rotatable directional coupler element]] The forward and reflected power measured by directional couplers can be used to calculate SWR.  The computations can be done mathematically in analog or digital form or by using graphical methods built into the meter as an additional scale or by reading from the crossing point between two needles on the same meter. 
The above measuring instruments can be used "in line" that is, the full power of the transmitter can pass through the measuring device so as to allow continuous monitoring of SWR.  Other instruments, such as network analyzers, low power directional couplers and antenna bridges use low power for the measurement and must be connected in place of the transmitter.  Bridge circuits can be used to directly measure the real and imaginary parts of a load impedance and to use those values to derive SWR. These methods can provide more information than just SWR or forward and reflected power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nautel.com/press-releases/nautel-adds-two-models-to-nx-series/ |title=Nautel Adds Two Models to NX Series |work=[[Nautel]] |date=March 11, 2015 |accessdate=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stand alone antenna analyzers use various measuring methods and can display SWR and other parameters plotted against frequency.  By using directional couplers and a bridge in combination, it is possible to make an in line instrument that reads directly in complex impedance or in SWR. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.deltaelectronics.com/data/oib1&amp;3.htm).&lt;/ref&gt; Stand alone [[antenna analyzer]]s also are available that measure multiple parameters.

==Power standing wave ratio==

The term ''power standing wave ratio'' (PSWR) is sometimes referred to, and defined as, the square of the voltage standing wave ratio. The term is widely cited as "misleading."&lt;ref&gt;Christian Wolff, [http://www.radartutorial.eu/03.linetheory/tl06.en.html "Standing Wave Ratio"], radartutorial.eu&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of Gridley:&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Gridley, ''Principles of Electrical Transmission Lines in Power and Communication'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=geNbAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA265 p. 265], Elsevier, 2014 {{ISBN|1483186032}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The expression "power standing-wave ratio", which may sometimes be encountered is even more misleading, for the power distribution along a loss-free line is constant.....|J. H. Gridley}}

However it does correspond to one type of measurement of SWR using what was formerly a standard measuring instrument at microwave frequencies, the [[slotted line]]. The slotted line is a [[waveguide]] (or air-filled coaxial line) in which a small sensing antenna which is part of a ''crystal detector'' or ''detector'' is placed in the electric field in the line. The voltage induced in the antenna is rectified by either a [[diode#Semiconductor diodes|point contact diode (crystal rectifier)]] or a [[Schottky barrier diode]] that is incorporated in the detector.  These detectors have a square law output for low levels of input.  Readings therefore corresponded to the square of the electric field along the slot, ''E''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''), with maximum and minimum readings of ''E''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and  ''E''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; found  as the probe is moved along the slot. The ratio of these yields the ''square'' of the SWR, the so-called PSWR.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Vincent Rollin, ''An Introduction to Electronics'', p. 209, Clarendon Press, 1964 {{OCLC|1148924}}.&lt;/ref&gt;.

It should be noted, however, that this technique of rationalization of terms is fraught with problems. The square law behavior of the detector diode is only exhibited when the voltage across the diode is below the knee of the diode. Once the detected voltage exceeds the knee, the response of the diode becomes nearly linear. In this mode the diode and its associated filtering capacitor produce a voltage that is proportional to the peak of the sampled voltage. The operator of such a detector would not have a ready indication as to the mode in which the detector diode is operating and therefore differentiating the results between SWR or so called PSWR is not practical. Perhaps even worse, is the common case where the minimum detected voltage is below the knee and the maximum voltage is above the knee. In this case, the computed results are largely meaningless. Thus the terms PSWR and Power Standing Wave Ratio are deprecated and should only be considered from a legacy measurement perspective.

==Implications of SWR on medical applications==

SWR can also have a detrimental impact upon the performance of microwave-based medical applications. In microwave electrosurgery an antenna that is placed directly into tissue may not always have an optimal match with the feedline resulting in an SWR. The presence of SWR can affect monitoring components used to measure power levels impacting the reliability of such measurements.&lt;ref name="ARRL19.5"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedias/problems-with-vswr-in-medical-applications|title=Problems with VSWR in Medical Applications|work=microwaves101.com|accessdate=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Storytelling System''''' is a [[role-playing game system]] created by [[White Wolf, Inc.]] for the [[Chronicles of Darkness]] (formerly known as the New World of Darkness), a game world with several [[pen and paper]] games tied in. The Storytelling System is largely based on the [[Storyteller System]], the rule set used for White Wolf's other, older game setting, the [[World of Darkness]] (for a time known as ''old'' or ''classic'' World of Darkness).

==History==

===Storyteller System===
While on the road to [[Gen Con]] '90, [[Mark Rein·Hagen]] came upon the idea of a new game design that would become ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]''. [[Tom Dowd (game designer)|Tom Dowd]], co-designer for ''[[Shadowrun]]'', worked with Rein-Hagen to adapt the core mechanics from his previous game success to use [[Pentagonal trapezohedron|d10]] instead of [[Dice|d6]] for calculating probability.&lt;ref name="history1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rpg.net/columns/briefhistory/briefhistory11.phtml |title=A Brief History of Game #11: White Wolf, Part One: 1986-1995 |accessdate=2007-09-16 |author=Appelcline, Shannon |date=2007-02-01 |work=RPGnet |publisher=Skotos Tech Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next few years, several games were published under this rule set.

==Character creation==
''Storytelling System'' characters are built with [[character point]]s that represent a Dot on their character sheets. Each Dot represents a ten-sided die ([[Ten-sided die|d10]]). The more Dots in an Attribute or Skill, the better the character is at those abilities. A set of dice representing the Dots in an Attribute or Skill forms a Dice Pool that the character uses to see if he/she succeeds or fails at specific tasks.

===Attributes===
Characters have nine [[Attribute (role-playing games)|Attribute]]s in three groups: Mental, Physical, and Social. In the ''Storytelling System'', Attributes are also divided into three use-based categories: Power (the ability to alter one's environment), Finesse (the ability to use power efficiently), and Resilience (the ability to cope with power being exercised upon one's self).

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center; width: 600px; height: 150px;"
|+ Storytelling System Attributes
|-
! scope="col" | 
! scope="col" | Mental 
! scope="col" | Physical
! scope="col" | Social
|-
! scope="row" | Power
| Intelligence || Strength || Presence
|-
! scope="row" | Finesse
| Wits || Dexterity || Manipulation
|-
! scope="row" | Resilience
| Resolve || Stamina || Composure
|}

All Attributes begin with one Dot. Normally, Attributes can have up to 5 Dots. With one Dot, a character is "poor" in that Attribute and gets one die. With two Dots, they are "average" and get two dice. Three Dots, they are "good". Four Dots, they are "exceptional", and with five Dots, they are "outstanding" and have five dice.

Starting characters get a number of Dots to add to their Attributes. The player must choose primary, secondary and tertiary attribute categories, getting a large number of dots to assign to primary Attributes, a moderate number to assign to secondary Attributes and a small number for tertiary Attributes. The first Dot of each attribute is free, the 2nd to 4th Dots cost one Dot each, and the 5th Dot costs 2 Dots to fill in. The primary, secondary and tertiary designations have no effect after character creation.

===Abilities and skills===
Characters have a wide array of Skills (Storytelling) or [[skill (role-playing)|Abilities]] (Storyteller) to choose from that represent specialized areas of knowledge.

In the ''Storytelling System'', Skills are divided into Mental, Physical and Social skills. In the Storyteller System, Abilities are divided into three Types: Knowledges, Talents, and Skills.

Like Attributes, each Ability / Skill has 5 Dots that represent how many dice a Skill gets.

Characters get a number of Dots to "fill in" the Ability / Skill Dots, and like the Attributes, they must assign a specific number of skills to the primary, secondary and tertiary skill groups. Like Attributes, the 5th Dot costs two Dots to fill in, and the primary, secondary and tertiary distinctions have no effect after character creation.

===Advantages===
Advantages in the game are such things as the character's Defense score, Health, Initiative, Morality, Size, Speed, and Willpower. Some derived Attributes are as follows:

*'''Defense:''' is the negative Modifier an opponent gets when he tries to attack a character, which is equal to the number of Dots in the lower of Dexterity or Wits. It is exclusive to the ''Storytelling System''.
*'''Health:''' is how well the character copes with injury. In the ''Storytelling System'', Health is equal to Stamina + Size. In the Storyteller System, characters almost universally have exactly 7 Health levels.
*'''Initiative:''' is a measure of the character's reaction time. It is equal to Dexterity + Composure, and is exclusive to the ''Storytelling System''.
*'''Morality:''' is a measure of the character's sense of compassion toward their fellow man, and respect for the law. Morality has a base numerical value of 7, and can change higher or lower throughout the game depending on what the character does. It could rise for doing "good" things and lower for doing "evil". Losing morality can cause characters to gain derangement, and affects the self-control of certain supernatural creatures, such as vampires and werewolves. In the ''Storytelling System'', all playable characters have a morality stat whose name changes with the setting (Morality for Humans, Humanity for Vampires, Harmony for Werewolves and so). In the Storyteller System, only ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'' uses a morality system.
*'''Size:''' is how big or small a character is. It is a numerical value, and for base humans, Size is equal to 5, and is reduced for smaller, and increased for larger sized creatures.
*'''Willpower:''' a measure of a character's self-confidence and determination, and determines the size of a character's Temporary Willpower pool. In the ''Storytelling System'', it is equal to Resolve + Composure, unless it has been temporarily lowered, in which case it can be bought back with experience. In the Storyteller System, Willpower is rated from 1 to 10, and the method of calculating a character's base Willpower rating varies by game line.

===Virtues and Vices===
In the ''Storytelling System'', each character has one Virtue and one Vice. A Virtue is some defining quality of a character's personality and is one that clearly reflects their basic beliefs. Players chose from the [[Seven Virtues]], which include Charity, Faith, and Justice. A Vice is a basic weakness in the character's personality. They are the [[Seven Deadly Sins]] such as Envy, Lust, and Greed. Characters can regain willpower by fulfilling their Virtue or Vice.

In the earlier Storyteller System, different sets of virtues are used, and only in a couple games:  Vampire: The Masquerade uses them for varying forms of self-control, and Hunter: The Reckoning ties them directly to Hunters' supernatural powers.

===Supernatural templates===
In the ''Storytelling System'', playable supernatural characters are created by applying a template to the character during character creation, before Merits or Experience. For instance, with a Vampire character, a template describing certain vampiric attributes (Disciplines, Blood points, etc.) is added.  To keep the game balanced, only one supernatural template can be applied per character.

===Backgrounds and Merits===
Merits are special beneficial abilities and strengths a character may possess. They are similar in a way to Feats in [[d20 System]] games, allowing characters to do something the main rules usually don't allow. They are organized in the Mental, Physical, and Social categories like Attributes and Skills. In the ''Storytelling System'', starting characters get 7 Dots to purchase Merits. Some Merits apply to certain Attributes and provide a bonus when using them. Some also require a certain number of Dots in some other Attribute in order to purchase them. Each Trait has a certain number of Dots associated which indicate its Dot cost. A Trait with 4 Dots, for example, "Common Sense", costs 4 Dots to purchase. Others have a range of Dots; "Language" for instance, is one Dot, and a character can buy a certain level of it as they choose. In the Storyteller System, Merits are optional, are purchased with bonus points and have costs ranging from 1 to 7 points.

In the Storyteller System, Backgrounds are advantages such as Contacts, Resources and Status. In the ''Storytelling System'', Backgrounds have been absorbed into Merits. Furthermore, the Linguistics Knowledge, representing knowledge of specific languages, has also been absorbed.

===Experience or bonus points===
In the ''Storytelling System'', more powerful or experienced characters can spend Experience Points at the end of character creation.

Exclusive to the ''Storyteller System'', Bonus Points are used to increase traits at character creation, with more powerful or experienced characters getting additional Bonus Points at character creation.

==Game mechanics==

All mechanics of the ''Storytelling System'' utilize a number of 10-sided dice (d10s). ''World of Darkness'' games suggest players to have at least ten d10s available to roll for their character's task resolutions and Attribute tests.

The [[Game Master]] in a WW game is called the Storyteller.

===Dice pools===
Depending on what the situation calls for, a character has a number of Dots in Attributes and Skills associated with the task. Each Dot represents a d10 die that is added to a [[dice pool]] to roll for task resolution.  For example, if a character is scaling a wall, they add the number of Dots in their Strength Attribute and their Athletics Skill together. In this case, if the character has a Strength of 3 Dots, and an Athletics Skill of 4 Dots, they get 7 dice in their Dice Pool.

====Storyteller System Difficulty====

Each die rolling above the target number is a success. Most tasks require only a single success, but some require more. Each die rolling a 1 cancels out a success. If the net number of successes is 0 or less, the action is a failure. If no successes were rolled and one or more 1s were also rolled, the action is a botch, resulting in detrimental results to the player.

====Storytelling System====

=====Target numbers=====
The Target number in Chronicles of Darkness games is always 8; a d10 dice roll needs to roll 8s, 9s, and 10s to bring up a Success. A roll of 7 or less is a Failure.
As long as one Success is rolled, that character has achieved their task. Five or more Successes in a roll is an Exceptional success and usually something very beneficial happens for the character, above what they had expected.
Anytime a die comes up as a 10, a player may reroll it to see if it gets another 8 or higher. This is called 10 Again. If the reroll succeeds, it counts as another Success to be added in.

Anytime a character has absolutely no dice remaining in their pool as a result of negative Modifiers, the task would seem impossible to perform. The character is still allowed a single d10 die roll, called a Chance Roll, to see if sheer blind luck or divine intervention allows them to succeed. Result of 10 is a Success (can be rerolled for more Successes, see "10 Again" rule above), 2–9 is a Failure and a result of 1 is a Dramatic Failure.

=====Modifiers=====
Modifiers are either bonuses or penalties to a die roll that are determined and added in by the Storyteller. This will subtract or add to the number of dice that can be rolled in a Dice Pool. The maximum number of dice that can be added or subtracted is 5.

=====Keeping time=====
Time in ''Storytelling System'' is measured in small Turns of three seconds. Turns further make up a Scene, which further make up a Chapter. A Chapter is usually one gaming session and Chapters are linked together into an overall Story set in a Chronicle (or the Big Picture), the theme and setting of the entire game.

=====Actions and Combat=====
There are three basic kinds of Actions in the ''Storytelling System''. Instant Actions take up very little time like taking a gun off safety, or shouting a small message to an ally. Extended Actions take longer time to accomplish and can extend over a number of Turns to complete, like getting a stuck window open, or changing a light bulb. Contested Actions are Actions that involve dealing with what the opposition does, like shooting at a running target during a Combat Scene.

=====Taking damage=====
For every Success a character has on their Attack roll against an opponent, they inflict one Health Point of Damage upon the target. There are three kinds of Damage in White Wolf games: Bashing, Lethal and Aggravated. Bashing Damage is inflicted by blunt objects that bludgeons targets like a baseball bat. Lethal Damage is caused by slashing and piercing weapons like knives and guns. Aggravated Damage is inflicted mainly by supernatural sources and the weaknesses of supernatural creatures (such as fire and sunlight against vampires or silver against werewolves); however, it can also be inflicted by severe radiation poisoning. Characters recover from Bashing Damage quickly, while Aggravated Damage takes the longest to recover from.

Health boxes are checked off by Damage. When the last box is checked with bashing damage, a character is generally at risk of passing out, if the last box is checked with lethal damage, a character is helpless and generally at risk of dying without medical attention, and if the last box is checked with aggravated damage, a character is dead. If a character's Health track is filled with Bashing Damage, any additional Bashing Damage is upgraded to Lethal, and if a character's Health track is filled with Lethal Damage, any additional Bashing or Lethal damage is upgraded to Aggravated.

===Rewards===
After a game, a Storyteller can award [[experience point]]s to players to improve their character's Attributes, Talents and Skills. Experience distribution is typically based upon roleplaying performance (especially if flaws are present), as well as accomplishing short- and long-term goals.

===Variant systems===
In the classic World of Darkness, the Storyteller dictated a Target Number which was a number a player needed to roll at or above on his dice in order to generate a Success. The standard Target Number in the previous World of Darkness systems was 6, equaling a 50% success chance for an individual die, with a sliding scale for difficulty. The Exalted, Scion Trinity systems use a flat target number of 7 for almost all rolls.

A more dramatic variant is the ''[[Mind's Eye Theatre]]'' system, which is designed for [[live action role-playing game|LARP]] rather than tabletop roleplaying.

===God-Machine Rules===
In July 2013, White Wolf released a rules update and the first in a series of intended "Chronicle Books" that would give a default focus for games and update their rules to work with the new rules released in ''The God-Machine Chronicle''. The system changes include the addition of Conditions and Tilts, which are usually-temporary traits that can impact characters' abilities; while Conditions apply at all times, Tilts usually directly affect combat.

The Experience Point system also changed greatly: throughout a session, players now accumulate "beats" through coping with or resolving Conditions, dealing with hardships, or accomplishing goals. When the player accumulates five beats, she may redeem these for an Experience.  Improving character traits is now flat, such that buying the first dot of a trait costs the same as purchasing the final dot of the same.

On August 16th, 2014, Onyx Path Publishing revealed that they were publishing a second edition of the Chronicles of Darkness setting, using the God-Machine rules.  They also announced that they would be releasing new editions of their first five games in the setting.  While Vampire: The Requiem had released its ''The Strix Chronicle'' less than a year previous, Onyx Path conceded that the second edition of ''Requiem'' would be identical enough to ''Strix'' that they would supply a free PDF of the second edition to anyone who had already purchased a PDF copy of that book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theonyxpath.com/the-world-of-darkness-second-edition |title=The World of Darkness, Second Edition |author=Bailey, Rose |date=2014-08-16 |work=Onyx Path Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31182">The term “sustainable communities” has various definitions, but in essence refers to communities planned, built, or modified to promote [[sustainable living]]. Sustainable communities tend to focus on environmental and economic [[sustainability]], urban infrastructure, social equity, and municipal government. The term is sometimes used synonymously with “green cities,” “eco-communities,” “livable cities” and “[[sustainable cities]].”
 
Different organizations have various understandings of sustainable communities; the term’s definition is contested and still under construction. For example, [[Burlington, Vermont]]’s Principles of Sustainable Community Development &lt;ref name="clinton2.nara.gov"&gt;"Appendix A: Definitions and Principles of Sustainable Communities" Sustainable Communities Task Force Report. Fall 1997. http://clinton2.nara.gov/PCSD/Publications/suscomm/suscoa.html&lt;/ref&gt;
stress the importance of local control of natural resources and a thriving non-profit sector to a sustainable community. The [[Institute for Sustainable Communities]] outlines how political empowerment and social well-being are also part of the definition&lt;ref name="clinton2.nara.gov"/&gt; Additionally, referring to communities in Shanghai and Singapore, geographer Lily Kong has paired concepts of [[cultural sustainability]] and [[social sustainability]] alongside environmental sustainability as aspects of sustainable communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Kong  | first = Lily | title =  Making Sustainable Creative/Cultural Space in Shanghai and Singapore| journal =  Geographical Review | volume =  99| issue = 1 | pages = 1–22  | date =  21 April 2010 | doi =10.1111/j.1931-0846.2009.tb00415.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the UK’s 2003 [[Sustainable Communities Plan]] often abbreviates its definition of sustainable communities as “places where people want to live and work, now and in the future” &lt;ref name="webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk"&gt;"What is a Sustainable Community?" The National Archives. http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120919132719/http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1139866&lt;/ref&gt;
. Addressing the scale of sustainable communities, political scientist Kent Portney points out that the term sustainable communities has been used to refer to a broad variety of places, ranging from neighborhoods to watersheds to cities to multi-state regions.&lt;ref name=P1&gt;{{cite book|last=Portney|first=Kent E.|title=Taking Sustainable Cities Seriously:  A Comparative Analysis of Twenty-Three U.S. Cities|url=http://seg.fsu.edu/Library/portney-taking-sustainability-seriously-in-cities.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Etymologically, the term “sustainable community” grew out of the related discourses of “sustainability” and “[[sustainable development]]” that gained widespread use among local, national, and international politicians and policymakers in NGOs starting in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="Agyeman"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Agyeman | first = Julian | title = Sustainable Communities and the Challenge of Environmental Justice| place =  New York| publisher = NYU Press| year =  2005| isbn = 9780814707111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term originally referred to environmental concerns and was later applied to cities.&lt;ref name=Maliene &gt;{{cite journal  | last1 =Maliene  | first1 = V | last2 = Howe  | first2 = J | last3 =Malys | first3 = N |title =  Sustainable Communities: Affordable Housing and Socio-Economic Relations. | journal =  Local Economy | volume =  23| issue = 4 | pages = 267–276  | date =  21 April 2010 | doi = 10.1080/02690940802407989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of Sustainable Community initiatives==

The best example of a real Sustainable Community is Saint Michael's Sustainable Community in Costa Rica. The community produces far more food and water then it needs.  It uses regenerative agriculture as a base to live in harmony with nature. 

Sustainable community initiatives have emerged in neighborhoods, cities, counties, [[Metropolitan area|metropolitan]] planning districts, and watershed districts at different scales pertaining to community needs. These initiatives are driven by various actor groups that have different methods of effectively planning out ways to create sustainable communities. Most often they are implemented by [[governments]] and [[non-profit organizations]], but they also involve community members, academics, and create partnerships and [[coalitions]].
 
Nonprofit organizations help to cultivate local talents and skills, [[Empowerment|empowering]] people to become more powerful and more involved in their own communities. Many also offer plans and guidance on improving the [[sustainability]] of various practices, such as land use and community design, [[transportation]], energy efficiency, [[waste reduction]], and climate friendly purchasing.
 
Some government groups will create partnerships where departments will work together using [[grants]] to provide resources to communities like clean air and water, [[community planning]], [[economic development]], equity and [[environmental justice]], as well as [[housing]] and transportation choices.
 
[[Social movements]] have gathered momentum, spreading sustainable community ideas around the world, not only through example, but also by offering classes and training on [[sustainable living]], [[permaculture]], and [[local economics]].

== International initiatives==

===United Kingdom===

The [[Sustainable Communities Plan]] was launched in 2003 through the [[Office of the Deputy Prime Minister]]. Lacking an official national spatial development plan, the UK employed the Sustainable Communities Plan as a regional development plan targeted at the South East of England.&lt;ref name="Raco"&gt;{{cite journal  | last =  Raco| first = Mike | title = A growth agenda without growth: English spatial policy, sustainable communities, and the death of the neo-liberal project | journal =  Geojournal | volume =  77| issue = 2 | pages = 153–165 | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1007/s10708-009-9327-0 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the plan created the [[Academy for Sustainable Communities]]. The £38 billion plan identifies four key growth areas for development and regeneration: the [[Thames Gateway]], [[Ashford, Kent]], [[London]]-Stansted-[[Cambridge]]-[[Peterborough]] (LSCP) and [[Milton Keynes]]/[[South Midlands]] (MKSM) &lt;ref name="webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk"/&gt;
.  Designed during a period that projected sustained economic growth into the future, the plan’s implementation has been slowed and disjointed, particularly since the [[2008 economic recession]] &lt;ref name="Raco"/&gt;
An [[affordable housing]] shortage in the UK has also challenged the Plan’s implementation.&lt;ref name= Maliene /&gt;

== National initiatives ==
The '''Partnership for Sustainable Communities''' is an interagency partnership between the [[Department of Transportation]], [[Environmental Protection Agency]], and the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]]. These departments work together with a mission to “improve access to affordable housing, increase transportation options, and lower transportation costs while protecting the environment”.&lt;ref name="sustainablecommunities.gov"&gt;"About Us" Partnership for Sustainable Communities.  Retrieved 10 March 2014 http://www.sustainablecommunities.gov/aboutUs.html&lt;/ref&gt; All three bureaus offer funding opportunities to support communities in areas of clean air and water, community planning, economic development, energy efficiency, equity and environmental justice, as well as housing and transportation choices. The partnership incorporates six principles of livability into its grant-making and program development.:&lt;ref name="sustainablecommunities.gov"/&gt;
*Provide more transportation choices
*Promote equitable, affordable housing
*Enhance economic competitiveness
*Support existing communities
*Coordinate policies and leverage investment
*Value communities and neighborhoods

Along with working collaboratively, these government agencies also have their own initiatives. 
The Department of Housing and Development has an ''Office of Sustainable Housing and Communities'' which features a Sustainable Housing Initiative, aiming at “supporting the construction and rehabilitation of [[green affordable housing]]”&lt;ref&gt;"Sustainable Housing Initiative" U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development. Retrieved 10 March 2014. http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/sustainable_housing_communities/sustainable_housing_initiative&lt;/ref&gt;  and does this through programs that retrofit or construct energy efficient homes. They also work to standardize energy efficiency standards across federal agencies, as well as expand the availability of financing for home energy improvements and multifamily housing.

The Environmental Protection Agency has a ''Smart Growth Program'' which conducts research, publishes reports, showcases outstanding communities, and works with communities through grants and technical assistance.&lt;ref&gt;"Smart Growth" U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Retrieved 9 March 2014. http://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  They also have a Green Communities Program which provides communities with a tool kit of information to help them reach sustainable goals. The tool kit is arranged in a five-step program which allows communities to:&lt;ref&gt;"Basic Information" Green Communities, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Retrieved 9 March 2014. http://www.epa.gov/greenkit/basicinformation.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Develop '''community assessments''' of their current conditions
*Formulate '''trend analyses''' that answers the question “Where are we going?” in the face of no intervention 
*Create '''vision statements''' of where the community sees itself in the future
*Establish '''action plans''' about what programs and initiatives will help the community reach its goals
*Access tools to '''implement''' action plans

The Department of Transportation has a ''Livability Initiative'' which issues “grants to eligible recipients for planning, vehicle purchases, facility construction, operations, and other purposes”,&lt;ref&gt;"Grants and Programs" U.S. Department of Transportation. Retrieved 10 March 2014. http://www.dot.gov/livability/grants-programs&lt;/ref&gt; with numerous goals, including the improvement of surface transportation, providing public transit on Indian reservations, providing access to disadvantaged communities, etc.

===Case Studies from the Partnership for Sustainable Communities===

'''The Euclid Corridor in Cleveland'''

Once a thriving place of business and home to the wealthy and elite, Euclid Avenue in [[Cleveland]] had seen a decline in commerce following the [[Great Depression]]. During this economic downturn, Cleveland became a [[shrinking city]] as many of its residents moved and homes were turned into boarding houses or abandoned altogether.. After decades of work by city leaders and residents to revitalize this part of the city, the bus line [[HealthLine]] debuted in 2008. This bus line increased ridership and helped The Euclid Corridor begin to see the redevelopment of abandoned properties as well as investment in development of commerce, to the tune of $4.3 billion. This created thousands of square feet of retail space and thousands of jobs. The success of the revitalization of the Euclid Corridor is due in large part to engaged community leaders, community members, and NGO's like MidTown Cleveland who worked on ensuring that there was a variety of housing investments. EPA assisted with the redevelopment of abandoned space through their brownfield assessment grants and HUD provided mortgage insurance on properties to aid in the development of Euclid Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;"Transit as Transformation - The Euclid Corridor in Cleveland" Partnership for Sustainable Communities. June 2012. Retrieved 10 March 2014" http://www.sustainablecommunities.gov/pdf/studies/cleveland-euclid-corridor.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Greenville, South Carolina’s Westside'''

Following a shift from the cotton production that once thrived in the west end of [[Greenville, South Carolina]], this part of the city began to see a flight of its residents and with it the abandonment and decay of its buildings and facilities, higher crime rates, and more low-income households. In 2010, HUD and DOT awarded the city $1.8 million to support a three-year planning initiative which sought to improve affordable housing, transportation, and increase economic development. The HUD provided a loan to encourage economic growth, specifically through the conversion of an old cotton warehouse into an area of retail shops, offices, and restaurants known as West End Market. The success of West End Market led to 230 building permits being issued around the area in a three-year period, resulting in a successful arts district that created jobs as well as drew tourists and locals. EPA assisted with the redevelopment of abandoned space through $200,000 in brownfield assessment grants which allowed for the city to facilitate clean up, or initiate redevelopment. The city also worked with the [[Federal Highway Administration]] in demolishing an unnecessary bridge which allowed for the development of a recreational area with a cross bridge, waterfalls, and walking paths, known as [[Falls Park on the Reedy]]. In 2005, a mixed-use development was constructed across from Falls Park with a hotel, apartments, restaurants, and retail and office spaces to help further spark economic growth in the area.&lt;ref&gt;"Revitalizing Greenville's Westside" Partnership for Sustainable Communities. December 2012. Retrieved 10 March 2014 http://www.sustainablecommunities.gov/pdf/studies/greenville_sc.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seattle’s South Lake Union Neighborhood'''

With investments in transportation, affordable housing, and green space, Seattle’s South Lake Union has transformed from a place of freeway traffic, abandoned warehouses, and parking lots to an economically flourishing neighborhood. An integral part to this transformation was the creation of a street car service, partially funded by the [[Federal Transit Administration]]. The streetcar encouraged both Amazon.com and Microsoft to locate campuses in the South Lake Union neighborhood, bringing with it jobs and investment in residential space. The City of Seattle is proposing a zoning change to promote affordable housing and attract market rate development. HUD provided grants to fund building and support services for the chronically homeless, adults and veterans recovering from addiction, and homeless with mental health issues and substance abuse problems. HUD also supplied $5.7 million towards the construction of a senior housing facility. To address the problems with the neighborhoods freeways and lack of sidewalks and crosswalks, a $30 million grant was issued by the DOT to help build crosswalks over 12 intersections, widen sidewalks, add bicycle lanes, as well as beautify the space through the addition of landscaping and trees.&lt;ref&gt;"Seattle's South Lake Union Neighborhood" Partnership for Sustainable Communities.

== State initiatives ==

===Maryland===

The state of Maryland passed a Sustainable Communities Act in 2010 with the goal of revitalizing and promoting reinvestment in Maryland’s older communities as well working to promote “equitable, affordable housing by expanding energy-efficient housing choices for people of all ages, incomes, races, and ethnicity to increase mobility and lower the combined cost of housing and transportation”.&lt;ref&gt;"Sustainable Communities" Maryland Department of Planning. Retrieved 11 March 2014. [http://planning.maryland.gov/yourpart/sustainablecommunities.shtml ]&lt;/ref&gt; The law also created the Sustainable Communities Tax Credit Program which promotes private investment in the restoration and development of historic sites.&lt;ref&gt;"Maryland Sustainable Communities Tax Credit Program" Maryland Department of Planning, Maryland Historical Trust. Retrieved 2 May 2014. http://mht.maryland.gov/taxCredits.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks in part to the Sustainable Communities Tax Credit Program, the neighborhood of [[Remington, Baltimore]] was able to refurbish an old tin factory into a space for offices and residences, which led to the development of other properties as well as homes, which increased use and population for the neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;"Remington Neighborhood Revitalization" Maryland Department of Planning. Retrieved 2 May 2014. http://planning.maryland.gov/OurWork/spotlightComm_Remington.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the Maryland General Assembly passed the Sustainable Communities Tax Increment Financing Designation and Financing Law. This law allows for Maryland counties and municipalities to use funds generated from increased property tax values to fund improvement projects in sustainable communities. Sample projects include expanding sidewalks, the development of tree planting on streets and parks, as well as improvements to water and sewer infrastructure to help encourage economic growth and improve quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;"Sustainable Communities" Maryland Department of Planning. Retrieved 2 May 2014. http://planning.maryland.gov/yourpart/sustainablecommunities.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

===California===

The state of California passed the [[Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act of 2008]], also known as SB 375. The law aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through transportation, housing, and land use planning. Under the SB 375, the state is broken up into Metropolitan Planning Organizations which are each responsible for developing Sustainable Community Strategies that will help the state reach its goal of reduced emissions. These strategies are then evaluated by the [[California Environmental Protection Agency]]'s Air Resources Board.&lt;ref name= "nrdc.org"&gt;"Sustainable Communities" California Environmental Protection Agency - Air Resources Board. Retrieved 8 March 2014. http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/sb375/sb375.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Sustainable Community Strategy, the city of [[Sacramento]] plans to double transit service and increase bike lanes, offering more transportation choices and reducing vehicle emissions.&lt;ref name="Eaken, Amanda 2012"&gt;Eaken, Amanda.

==City government initiatives==

Cities are defined as [[jurisdictional]] units that have small divisions of government within them. These divisions of government have the authority to affect environmental and [[ecological]] results.&lt;ref name="P1"/&gt;  Cities are especially important in initiating sustainable communities because they have [[local authorities]] that “have political power and credibility to take initiatives to access and deploy [[resources]] in ways reflecting local conditions that allows them the capacity to manage and lead [[urban development]] for the good of the environment.” &lt;ref name=P1 /&gt;  It is also necessary to implement sustainable communities in countries that are [[industrialized]] because cities are where most environmental and [[social problems]] dwell.
 
When looking at and comparing sustainable cities certain indicators may be used:
 
*Does the city have any [[smart growth]] programs that are designed to “help manage growth and avoid and eliminate [[urban sprawl]]” and minimize impacts on [[physical environment]]? &lt;ref name=P1 /&gt;
*Does the city have [[zoning]] plans that demonstrate goals for the city in a way that create [[Environmentally Sensitive Area|environmentally-sensitive]] areas and maintain them? &lt;ref name=P1 /&gt;
*Does the city follow any legal [[policies]] that allow [[advocates]] and [[activists]] to create programs that would help the city become [[sustainable]]? &lt;ref name=A1&gt;{{cite book|last=Agyeman|first=Julian|title=Sustainable Communities and the Challenge of Environmental Justice|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*How involved in the environmental and [[Social justice|social justice movement]] are programs within the city? &lt;ref name=A2&gt;{{cite book|last=Agyeman|first=Julian|title=Sustainable Communities and the Challenge of Environmental Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Is the [[transportation]] system of the city set up to encourage [[public transportation]] and not private to reduce [[pollution]]? &lt;ref name=P1 /&gt;
*Are there pollution remediation programs in the city? &lt;ref name=P1 /&gt;
*How [[Politically|politically involved]] are citizens where their voices are equally heard in order to create social justice and a [[just community]]? &lt;ref name=A2 /&gt;
 
The 34 elements inside “Taking Sustainable Cities Seriously" can also be used to determine whether a city is considered sustainable or not.&lt;ref name=P34&gt;{{cite book|last=Portney|first=Kent E.|title=Taking Sustainable Cities Seriously:  A Comparative Analysis of Twenty-Three U.S. Cities|page=34|url=http://seg.fsu.edu/Library/portney-taking-sustainability-seriously-in-cities.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===City examples===

The city of [[San Francisco]] uses the [[Precautionary principal|Precautionary Principal]] as a framework to develop laws for a healthier and more just city.&lt;ref name=A3&gt;{{cite book|last=Agyeman|first=Julian|title=Sustainable Communities and the Challenge of Environmental Justice|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precautionary principal gives more power to community members by allowing them to stand up against [[corporations]] in their neighborhoods and leaves the [[Burden of proof (law)|burden of proof]] to corporations instead of community members. Companies must prove that their endeavors are harmless to the community instead of the community having to prove they have been harmed by company endeavors.&lt;ref name=A2 /&gt; This allows for a sustainable community as [[environmental justice]] and social justice are created.
 
The city of [[Quebec]] to create a sustainable community through political involvement has dedicated studies to discovering why citizens are or are not politically active. Studies from Quebec have shown that citizens’ [[Political efficacy|internal and external efficacy]] is a large part in determining [[Participation (decision making)|participation]] in politics. When citizens lack the internal belief that one can make change in government and the external belief that the government will make changes according to citizen concerns, political participation dwindles as citizens believe no change will occur. When becoming politically active, a citizen takes into account the history of the city government, the government’s actions, and government interactions with other citizens.&lt;ref name=KC1&gt;{{cite book|last=Kornberg and Clarke|first=Allan and Harold|title=Citizens and Community: Political Support in a Representative Democracy|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
After noting the city’s sustainability level it is important to note what kinds of communities are targeted and how they are affected through these programs and what kinds of strategies are being used to try to create and transform sustainable communities.

==Non-Profit and NGO sector==

The [[Institute for Sustainable Communities]] created by former Vermont Governor, Madeleine M. Kunin, leads community based projects around the globe that address environmental, economic, and social issues.&lt;ref&gt;"What is a Sustainable Community?" Institute for Sustainable Communities. Retrieved 10 March 2014. http://www.iscvt.org/what_we_do/sustainable_community/&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these groups help to cultivate local talents and skills, empowering people to become more powerful and involved in their own communities. Many also offer plans and guidance on improving the sustainability of various practices, such as land use and community design, green transportation, energy efficiency, waste reduction, and climate friendly purchasing.&lt;ref&gt;"About Sustainable Communities" Sustainable Communities Online. Retrieved 11 March 2014. http://www.sustainable.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Global Integrity]] Project is focused on bringing together top scientists and thinkers from around the world in order to analyze the problems of inequality among humankind. These thinkers examine economic and ethical issues faced in protecting and enhancing our environments and make recommendations on restoration techniques that aid in promoting social justice. They also call for a major and imperative paradigm shift in order to ensure good quality of life for many future generations.&lt;ref name=EI&gt;{{cite book|last=Pimentel|first=David|title=Ecological Integrity: Integrating Environment, Conservation, and Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sustainable Seattle]]  is a non-profit organization which has created regional indicators for sustainability through grassroots activism and has become a world leader in these sustainability indicators. Sustainable Seattle has printed newsletters on a wide range of sustainale community topics, from building to recycling and more, and they are believed to be the first “sustainable community” organization, founded in 1991. There are now hundreds of “sustainable community” organizations across the USA &lt;ref&gt;"Who we are" Sustainable Seattle. Retrieved 5 May 2014. http://www.sustainableseattle.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social movement initiatives==

The Take Back Your Time Movement, led by John de Graaf, focuses on the concept of working fewer hours and devoting more time to living a healthy lifestyle. The movement suggests that allowing shorter work days and longer vacations would in turn help better distribute work, while also reducing stress and making for healthier living. Additionally, people would have more free time to make more rewarding and sustainable choices for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Assadourian, Erik. "The Power of Social Movements" Worldwatch Institute. Retrieved 10 March 2014. http://blogs.worldwatch.org/transformingcultures/contents/social-movements&lt;/ref&gt;

The Voluntary Simplicity Movement or [[Simple Living]] movement emphasizes reducing one’s material possessions and desires and increasing self-sufficiency through skills such as gardening and [[DIY]]. The Voluntary Simplicity Movement suggests that one should focus on cultivating their own best inner being rather than focus on making material gains and wealth. It also promotes activism within the community to create engaged, educated citizens.

The [[Degrowth]] movement is based on [[anti-consumerist]] and [[anti-capitalist]] ideas, focusing on reducing consumption and promoting happy, healthy lifestyles in non-consumptive fashions. Main aspects of Degrowth include more equal distribution of workload and sharing work, consuming less, and setting aside time for personal and cultural growth through the arts and creativity &lt;ref&gt;"About Us: Description" Degrowth.org Retrieved 9 March 2014. http://www.degrowth.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Movements such as [[ecovillage]]s are gathering momentum, spreading sustainable community ideas around the world, teaching through example and also offering classes and training on sustainable living, [[permaculture]], and local economics. Ecovillages seek to integrate themselves harmlessly into the ecosystem surrounding them, so as to live and interact in a way that is sustainable and supportive of the natural world &lt;ref&gt;"About Us" Ecovillage Farm Learning Center. Retrieved 10 March 2014. http://ecovillagefarm.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges and critiques==

Sustainable communities, both as individual projects and as a whole, have faced challenges impeding their development and have been met with criticism.
 
Sustainable communities projects have struggled to take hold for:
 
* poor economic conditions and inaccessible housing markets: in the UK’s Sustainable Communities Plan, the economic downturn of 2008 has led to a general shortage of housing and affordable housing in particular, which run contrary to the plan’s premises of  livable communities.&lt;ref name= Maliene/&gt;
 
Projects have been critiqued for:
* lacking a well-developed [[environmental justice]] framework: urban and environmental policy planner [[Julian Agyeman]] has written about the "narrow focus" of civic environmentalism that does not take "social justice" into account, and the need for sustainable communities to be democratic and collaborate with the environmental justice movement.&lt;ref name=Agyeman /&gt;
* promoting a securitization agenda: British geographer Mike Raco argues that the UK's Sustainable Communities Plan employs the discourse of sustainability as "a series of potentially repressive and counter-productive policy measures.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =  Raco| first = Mike | title = Securing Sustainable Communities: Citizenship, Safety, and Sustainability in the New Urban Planning | journal =  European Urban and Regional Studies | volume =  14| issue = 4 | pages = 305–320 | year = 2014| doi = 10.1177/0969776407081164 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
 
* accommodating to [[neoliberal]] economic systems instead of confronting them: while some rationales for sustainable communities conflict with market-driven agendas, economic growth characterizes the means and ends of some initiatives. Additionally, sustainable communities reject the notion that development itself is fundamentally socially divisive or environmentally destructive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =  Raco| first = Mike | title = Sustainable Development, Rolled-Out Neoliberalism and Sustainable Communities | journal =  Antipode | volume =  37| issue = 2 | pages = 324–347 | year = 2005| doi = 10.1111/j.0066-4812.2005.00495.x }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
While there are a variety of graduate degrees at universities that touch on sustainability as it related to urban planning and environmental resources, only a few degree program programs exist that train students in the theory and practice of sustainable communities. The most notable examples are:

* [[Binghamton University]] offers a [https://www.binghamton.edu/sustainable-communities/ Masters of Arts (MA) and Masters of Science (MS) in Sustainable Communities]. 
* [[Green Mountain College]] has a graduate program leading to a [http://www.greenmtn.edu/academics/graduate/mrsc/ Masters of Science (MS) in Resilient and Sustainable Communities].
* [[Northern Arizona University]] offers a [https://in.nau.edu/sustainable-communities/program/ Masters of Arts (MA) in Sustainable Communities].

The '''United Federation of Planets''' ('''UFP'''), usually referred to as '''the Federation''', is a fictional interstellar federal republic in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' science fiction franchise, composed of numerous [[planet]]ary sovereignties. In the UFP, the member planetary governments agreed to exist semi-autonomously under a single central authority based on the utopian principles of universal liberty, rights and equality, and [[Technological utopianism|to share their knowledge and resources in peaceful cooperation]] and [[Outer space|space]] exploration while each member world retained its own political and social structure.

The Federation was introduced in the 1966–1969 television show ''[[Star Trek]]'' as the organization that sent the starship [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] on its mission of peaceful exploration. As the Federation has continued to explore the galaxy and expand its membership, it has been increasingly challenged by hostile alien civilizations such as the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] and the [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]]. The survival, success, and growth of the Federation and its principles of freedom have become some of the ''Star Trek'' franchise's central themes.

The Federation was conceived as an idealized version of the [[United Nations]]. The Federation has been generally well received by critics and fans, becoming one of the most enduring storylines and symbols of the ''Star Trek'' franchise.

==Conception==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
The first mention of the United Federation of Planets was in the 1967 episode "[[A Taste of Armageddon]]", although other vague references such as just the Federation or to the United Earth Space Probe Agency ("[[Tomorrow is Yesterday]]") were used in prior episodes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} As part of the [[anti-war]] message he wanted the show to convey, ''Star Trek'' creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] intended to depict the Federation as an ideal, optimistic version of the United Nations.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} In several following episodes of the original series that were intended as allegories to the then-current [[Cold War]] tensions, the Federation took on the role resembling NATO while the [[Klingon]]s represented the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="Westmore"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Westmore|first1=Michael|title=Star Trek: Aliens &amp; Artifacts|date=2000|publisher=Pocket Books|location=New York|isbn=0-671-04299-8|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roberto Orci]], writer of the 2009 ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' movie, explained that the utopianism of the series has many times been a thematic foil to ongoing world events, showing that peace is possible in times where there are fears of "perpetual war".&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|title=The Two Sides of ‘Star Trek’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20090514thursday.html |author=Dave Itzkoff|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date= 2009-05-14|accessdate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federation is described as an [[star system|interstellar]] [[federalism|federal]] [[polity]] with, as of the year 2373, more than 150 member [[planet]]s and thousands of colonies spread across some 8,000,000 cubic light years of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy; each successive series in the timeline bringing in more races and planets into the Federation. The Federation is described as stressing, at least nominally, the values of [[Liberty|universal liberty]], [[Social equality|equality]], [[justice]], [[peace]], and [[cooperation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Okuda|first1=Michael|last2=Okuda|first2=Denise|title=The Star Trek Encyclopedia: A Reference Guide to the Future|date=1999|publisher=Pocket Books|location=New York|isbn=9780671034757|edition=Updated and expanded}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;ref name=secretio9&gt;{{cite web|author=Charlie Jane Anders |url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/5965604/the-secret-history-of-star-treks-utopian-federation/ |title=The Secret History of Star Trek's Utopian Federation |publisher=[[Gizmodo]]|date=2012-12-04 |accessdate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Federation also maintains its own quasi-militaristic and scientific exploratory agency, known as [[Starfleet]] (also written as "Star Fleet" in some texts). Starfleet is seen handling many other governmental processes, often with no other agency's influence, such as border defense ("[[Balance of Terror]]", "[[Arena (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Arena]]"), diplomatic envoy ("[[Mirror, Mirror (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Mirror Mirror]]"), and has seen extensive use as a defensive military force ("[[Errand of Mercy]]", "[[The Doomsday Machine (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Doomsday Machine]]").

==Portrayal==
The television series and films depict [[Earth]] and humanity as holding a center-stage political role within the Federation, in some ways first among equals.  The legislature, the [[Federation Council (Star Trek)|Federation Council]], is located at the [[Presidio of San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;This is established in ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]'' and corroborated in the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' installment "[[In a Mirror, Darkly|In a Mirror, Darkly, Part II]]".&lt;/ref&gt; Several other bodies of the Federation have been depicted. There is an [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] headed by a Federation President,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]''&lt;/ref&gt; who keeps offices in the [[Place de la Concorde|Palais de la Concorde]] in Paris. There is a [[judiciary]] branch as well, the highest court of which is the Federation Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;This is referred to in "[[Doctor Bashir, I Presume?]]" in ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Federation's scientific, diplomatic and defensive/military arm is Starfleet, depicted as being headquartered at [[Fort Baker]]. The Federation comes into military conflict with other major powers in the galaxy such as the [[Klingon|Klingon Empire]], the [[Romulan|Romulan Star Empire]], the [[Cardassian Union]], the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]], and the [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]].

The United Federation of Planets has existed as part of the ''Star Trek'' universe since the first season of the [[Star Trek: The Original Series|original series]] and is the primary focus of all the ''Star Trek'' series. Several episodes of ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' follow events leading up to the creation of the Federation, with the final episode featuring the signing of the Federation Charter.

In the series ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', Earth Minister Nathan Samuels advocated the Coalition of Planets and invited other alien species, initially the [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcans]], [[Andorian]]s and [[Tellarite]]s, to become a part of this. The formation of the Coalition seems to have been the event that provoked the xenophobic Terra Prime incident in the episodes "[[Demons (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Demons]]" and "[[Terra Prime]]". After Terra Prime leader [[John Frederick Paxton]] exploited the xenophobia on Earth, many of the aliens were unnerved and nearly abandoned the idea of a coalition. However, they were convinced by a speech from Captain [[Jonathan Archer]] to give the idea of a united organization of worlds a chance. Six years later in 2161,&lt;ref&gt;[[The Outcast (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|"The Outcast"]]&lt;/ref&gt; the United Federation of Planets was organized.

The Federation was founded in 2161 with the adoption of the Charter of the United Federation of Planets (sometimes referred to informally as the "Constitution). It draws text and inspiration from the [[United Nations Charter]] and other sources. An important guiding principle—it is listed as General Order One in the list of Starfleet general orders—is the [[Prime Directive]], which forbids any interference in the natural development of any civilization which has not yet discovered [[warp drive|faster-than-light (or warp) travel]]. This is intended to prevent even well-intentioned Federation personnel from [[Accelerating change|introducing changes]] which could destabilize or even destroy other pre-warp era cultures through interference.&lt;ref&gt;"[[The Circle (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|The Circle]]" (''Deep Space Nine'')&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice, however, consistent application of the Prime Directive tends to be a controversial issue, and the Federation does not always abide strictly by it, as when it initially approved the forced relocation of the [[Ba'ku]] from their adopted homeworld—although it was eventually determined that the Ba'ku were not a pre-warp civilization.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Star Trek: Insurrection]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Starfleet's Omega Directive supersedes the Prime Directive allowing for any means possible to destroy the Omega particle if encountered.&lt;ref&gt;"[[The Omega Directive]]" ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Other aspects of the articles provide for rule of law, equality among individuals, and protection of civil and creative liberties—all of which appear to be based on principles found in contemporary Western political theory. The charter includes guarantees of civil rights, the Seventh Guarantee being analogous to the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] and its protection against self-incrimination.

The Federation also has its own semi-independent black operations agency, known as [[Section 31]], analogous to the Romulan Star Empire's Tal Shiar and the Cardassian Union's Obsidian Order.

The Federation has exacting requirements for prospective member worlds that wish to join. [[Caste]]-based discrimination is forbidden,&lt;ref name=Accession&gt;[[Accession (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)]]&lt;/ref&gt; and major systematic violations of sentient rights, such as the unjust peacetime imprisonment of [[supersoldier|specially modified soldiers]] on Angosia, are not tolerated for any petitioner.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Hunted (Star Trek: The Next Generation)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, although most member worlds have single, unified [[world government]]s, this is not required for entry, since the Federation will consider associate membership of non-unified worlds.&lt;ref name=Attached&gt;"[[Attached]]" (''The Next Generation'')&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond that, the Federation at large does not interfere with any member planet's internal politics and how it governs its own people, provided it abides by the rules of conduct expected of all Federation worlds.

===Government===
The government of the United Federation of Planets consists of the central federal government and the local planetary governments, who share joint sovereignty. The chief of state or of government of most planets is referred to as Governor, Prime Minister, or First Minister. The central government is composed of the office of the president, the president's cabinet, the Federation Council—made up of an equal number of representatives from every member planet—and the Federation Supreme Court.

====President====
The President of the United Federation of Planets (informally, the Federation President or the President of the Federation) is the elected [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] of the United Federation of Planets and is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the government, setting and coordinating foreign policy, and dealing with resource distribution issues. The Federation President is also the commander-in-chief of all [[Starfleet]] forces.

The President is supported by the Cabinet, a special committee composed of the heads of the executive departments of the Federation government as mentioned in "[[Extreme Measures (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Extreme Measures]]".

The Federation President's office is located in the city of Paris, France on [[Earth]].

====Council====
The Federation Council is the legislature of the UFP. Seats on the council are filled by representatives from the various Federation member worlds. In addition to legislation, the Federation Council is the only federal entity which may declare war. It frequently passes resolutions which the federation president and his or her staff must enact and enforce.

The makeup and location of the Council is somewhat vague and open to interpretation based upon canonical evidence.

====Supreme Court====
The Federation Supreme Court is the highest court in the Federation, and is led by an elected Chief Justice. The court was first mentioned in "[[Doctor Bashir, I Presume?]]".

===History of the Federation===

====21st century====
The film ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' depicts the events surrounding the first meeting of humans with aliens. After the end of World War III on Earth, scientist [[Zefram Cochrane]] built Earth's first warp-capable vessel, the ''[[Phoenix (Star Trek)|Phoenix]]'', launched on April 5, 2063. Cochrane's warp tests of the ''Phoenix'' caught the attention of a [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] science ship operating just outside the [[Solar System|Sol system]]. Vulcans, having not previously considered Sol or Earth worthy of their attention, established first contact with Cochrane and the inhabitants of his base in [[Bozeman, Montana]], when landing on Earth that same day. This meeting marked the point at which Earth first joined the interstellar community, and began the road toward the founding of the United Federation of Planets.

====22nd and 23rd centuries====
In the year 2119, an aging [[Zefram Cochrane]] opens the Warp 5 Complex on Earth, hoping to build the fastest human starship at the time. His project would eventually yield the ''[[Starship Enterprise|Enterprise]]'' NX-01, humankind's first deep-space exploration vessel. In 2150 United Earth, a planetary government, was formed, which included nearly all the nations on Earth.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Although no single individual was responsible for the UFP's founding, the starship ''Enterprise'' NX-01 was a major catalyst. Under the command of her captain, [[Jonathan Archer]], the ship helped forge an alliance between the formerly belligerent [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]], [[Andorian]], and [[Tellarite]] worlds, and fostered a spirit of unity and cooperation in the region which culminated in a more formal union in 2161. The UFP's immediate predecessor was the Coalition of Planets, which was strongly opposed by the xenophobic group [[Terra Prime]].

The Federation was formed in the immediate aftermath of the [[Earth-Romulan War]] of the late 2150s, which underscored the dire need for interstellar unity to prevent the horrors of conflict. Archer signed the Federation Charter after giving a historic speech that was still being studied two centuries later. According to the database of the USS ''Defiant'' NCC-1764, originating from the 23rd century, Archer went on to become a Federation ambassador to Andoria, a Federation councillor, and the UFP president from 2184 to 2192.&lt;ref&gt;"[[In a Mirror, Darkly]], Part II" (''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;

In about 2223 tensions began rising between the UFP and the [[Klingon|Klingon Empire]], and in 2267, after efforts by captain James Kirk and the heavy cruiser ''Enterprise'' NCC-1701 at Organia failed to broker a truce, the native energy beings the [[Organian]]s imposed an enforced peace and a signed treaty which effectively ended major conflict. Over the next few decades the two interstellar powers remained in a state of cold war, with occasional minor skirmishes. In 2293, the Klingons [[Suing for peace|sued for peace]] after the destruction of their moon [[Praxis (moon)|Praxis]], which led to the eventual signing of the {{Visible anchor|Khitomer Accords}} (as depicted in ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country|Star Trek VI]]''). The accords not only ended the war—they ushered in seven decades of relative peace.

During the [[Star Trek: The Original Series|original series]] era, [[James T. Kirk|Captain Kirk]] noted (in the episode "[[Metamorphosis (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Metamorphosis]]") that humanity was on "a thousand planets and spreading out", a number that surely must include Earth's many offworld colonies as well as the far-flung worlds on which humans reside, and shouldn't be taken to mean the Federation had a thousand members at the time. Since many Federation members have many colonies like Earth does, the total number of planets within the Federation may be difficult to determine; still, ''[[Star Trek: First Contact|First Contact]]'' establishes "over one hundred and fifty" planets (and, implicitly, distinct sentient races native to said planets) as being in the Federation.

====Early 24th century====
In 2311, the Tomed incident saw thousands of Federation civilians and Starfleet personnel killed by Romulan forces. The unrest ended with the Treaty of Algeron, restoring the [[Romulan Neutral Zone|Neutral Zone]] and prohibiting Federation development of cloaking technology.

In 2344, the Romulan Star Empire assaulted the Klingon outpost at Narendra III. In an unexpected move, the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-C)|USS ''Enterprise''-C]] under captain [[Rachel Garrett]] came to the Klingons' defense; while the ship was destroyed in the skirmish, the crew's sacrifice did great honor to the Klingons, and the resultant goodwill forged the path toward a formal alliance between the one-time rivals.

Exploration and expansion in the 2340s and 2350s brought the Federation into conflict with several new powers, including the Talarians, the [[Sheliak]], and, notably, the Cardassians.

=====Cardassian War =====
Federation contact with a race known as the [[Cardassian]]s sparked an extended conflict. A representative incident was the massacre, in 2347, of Federation civilians on Setlik III. In 2370, a truce formed a demilitarized zone in which many Federation and Cardassian colonies found themselves within each other’s territory. Although an agreement was reached that provided for the eventual transfer of such colonies, the accord was fiercely opposed by a number of Federation colonists, some of whom formed a rebel movement, the Maquis, which continued resisting the Cardassians.

====Mid 24th century====
In 2365 the Federation first contacted the Borg Collective, which presented an existential threat to the alliance at the [[Battle of Wolf 359]]. Era events included the Klingon civil war, first contact with the [[Q Continuum|Q]], the start of relations with the [[Ferengi]], and various time-travel incidents.

From 2363 to 2371, the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|USS ''Enterprise''-D]] served as the Federation's flagship.  (The events of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''.)

From 2371 to 2378, the [[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|USS ''Voyager'']] (NCC-74656) was lost in the Delta Quadrant after being taken in the Badlands by the Caretaker's Array. (The events of ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]''.)

From 2373 to 2375 (depicted in ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''), the Federation fought the [[Dominion War]]. By far the largest conflict the Federation had ever faced, it began in alliance with the [[Klingon]]s and evolved to join with the [[Romulan]]s against the combined forces of the Dominion, the [[Cardassian]]s, and the [[Breen (Star Trek)|Breen]]. The F-K-R alliance, with substantial casualties on all sides, eventually triumphed—in no small part to a Cardassian switching-of-sides after officials belatedly saw how the Dominion had effectively, and bloodlessly, conquered them.

In 2379 (the events of ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]''), [[Remans|Reman]] [[praetor]] [[Shinzon]] seized control of the [[Romulan Star Empire|Romulan Empire]]. His coup was foiled by the crew of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)|''Enterprise''-E]] with help from Romulan-military dissidents. The event spurred a likely thaw in UFP/RSE relations frozen by over two centuries of chill, but the warming came at a steep cost: the [[power vacuum]] left by the death of Shinzon.

====Future history====
Prominent in some timelines is the [[Temporal Cold War]], waged on a number of fronts throughout time, including the 28th and 31st centuries.

By the 29th century, the Federation explores time as it once did space.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Relativity (Star Trek: Voyager)]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alternate timeline (2009 and 2013 films)====
In 2387, as shown in the ''Star Trek: Countdown'' comic series, the star Hobus neared its supernova phase in galaxy-threatening fashion, posing an end-stage threat to the Romulan Empire. On Romulus, Federation ambassador [[Spock]] created a plan to use volatile red matter to quell the nova, save billions of lives and halt the political destabilization of the [[Alpha Quadrant|Alpha]] and [[Beta Quadrant|Beta]] quadrants—but the empire didn't act quickly enough on it, and Romulus was destroyed.

To avenge the loss of his family and his world, the Romulan captain [[Nero (Star Trek)|Nero]] took to his augmented mining ship ''Narada'' and attacked Spock's craft as the ambassador sought to depart. (The captain blamed Spock, and the Federation in general, for the destruction of his homeworld and the death of his wife and child.) During the engagement, both ships were pulled into the Hobus nova's singularity and transported into a past altered by their very presence there. This blossomed into the alternate timeline seen in the eponymous 2009 ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' film, wherein the Narada, pulled further into the past than Spock, attacks the USS ''Kelvin'' with the resultant loss of its first officer, George Kirk, father of future captain James.

As portrayed in the 2013 sequel ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness|Into Darkness]]'', the Federation in the Kelvin timeline faces a similar Klingon Empire mobilizing for war as its counterpart in prime reality.

Federation society has been portrayed as an economic [[utopia]] made possible in part by the replicator technology available to all its member worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Economic Lessons of Star Trek's Money-Free Society|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/05/geeks-guide-star-trek-economics/|website=Wired.com|publisher=Wired.com|accessdate=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technology produces consumer goods and material through recombinant subatomic arrangement of raw materials.

In the ''[[Star Trek: Voyager|Voyager]]'' episode "[[Dark Frontier]]", [[Tom Paris]] describes replicator technology as the "new world economy" that from the late 22nd century onward would make money obsolete—a fact echoed by [[Jean-Luc Picard]] when explaining the future timeline to Cochrane-era fighter [[Lily Sloane]] in ''[[Star Trek: First Contact|First Contact]]''.

First mention of the Federation's obsolescence of traditional money came in ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home|The Voyage Home]]'' when Kirk, freshly arrived in 1980s San Francisco from 2286, observes that "these people still use money" and, when asked if his crew uses cash in the future, answers back that "We don't". In "[[The Neutral Zone (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Neutral Zone]]", Picard explains to cryogenically-preserved people from the 20th century that 24th-century Federation economics differ, and that money as they know it is not used, or needed.

Financial transactions are invoked in passing in several instances of the episodes and films. Mentioned early in the in-universe timespan is a monetary unit called the credit, though a physical example of one never appears. In one such example, on Space Station K-7 in the original episode "[[The Trouble with Tribbles]]" set in 2267, Uhura is offered a pet tribble for 10 credits. In ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock|The Search for Spock]]'' in 2285, an earthbound McCoy tries to book transport to the Genesis planet and is warned it could be expensive, but it is never revealed how much it would cost, since he is quickly taken into custody for breach of Genesis secrecy. Genesis project creator Carol Marcus, in ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan|The Wrath of Khan]]'', references the Federation's decision whether to fund her project or not, although in this context—since costs are not mentioned − "fund" may involve something other than credits. In ''Deep Space Nine''{{'}}s "[[You Are Cordially Invited...]]", station commander Benjamin Sisko's son Jake tells Ferengi businessman Quark that he has sold his first book. When Quark asks him how much he has earned, Sisko counters that "It's just a figure of speech." Sisko's colloquial use of "selling" here echoes similar mentions of financial-like transactions elsewhere, as when ''Enterprise'' engineer Montgomery Scott, in ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country|The Undiscovered Country]]'', references having bought a boat—or when Kirk says he has sold his house in the film ''[[Star Trek Generations|Generations]]''.

Monetary topics abound in the [[Star Trek: The Next Generation|''Next Generation'']] era. In the inaugural episode "[[Encounter at Farpoint]]" set in 2364, ''Enterprise'' medical officer [[Beverly Crusher]] buys a bolt of fabric and asks for it to be charged to her ship's account. Some officers are known to visit casinos, particularly near starbases, as in "[[Tapestry (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Tapestry]]", and poker is often depicted as a favorite of ''Enterprise''-D crewmembers, though actual money is never shown as part of the game. In ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|Deep Space Nine]]''{{'}}s episode "[[Explorers (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Explorers]]", [[Benjamin Sisko]] recounts how, upon first entering [[Starfleet Academy]] and transporting back to his [[New Orleans]] home many times, he quickly spent an entire month's allotment of "transporter credits" (though these may not be a form of money). Later, in "[[The Changing Face of Evil]]", Sisko arranges for his wife's employer (the Bajorans, a non-Federation race) to give her a month's paid vacation, a fact emphasized in the episode. In ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]''{{'}}s pilot, [[Tom Paris]] references having someone pay his bar bills.

"Credits" appear throughout ''Trek'' canon, yet are not cleanly defined. They may exist solely for financial transactions with races like the Ferengi that still use some form of currency. If so, the credit may hold its value primarily because the Federation says it does, and thereby be a kind of fiat money. In support of this view, ''Enterprise''-D first officer Riker is seen bartering for information with Quark in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|Next Generation]]'' episode "[[Firstborn (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Firstborn]]" using vouchers won at a gambling table in Quark's bar.

Riker claims the vouchers are good for twelve bars of latinum, a Ferengi currency which he asserts can be spent "almost anywhere", while the vouchers themselves were only good in Quark's establishment. This suggests that while the Federation may not use money, currencies other than the "credit" can be given, paid out, amassed, and spent within Federation space.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDLq51joXPw&lt;/ref&gt;

===Altcanon references===
&lt;!-- [[Centauran]] and [[Centaurans]] redirect here --&gt;
In [[Star Trek canon#Non-canon|altcanon]] sources like the original 1975 ''[[Star Trek Star Fleet Technical Manual]]'' and Johnson's ''[[Worlds of the Federation]]'', as well as the Next Generation ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation Role-playing Game|Last Unicorn]]'' and original ''[[Star Trek: The Role Playing Game|Fasa]]'' [[role-playing game|roleplaying]] games, the Federation's five founding members were Earth (or Terra), Vulcan, Tellar, Andor, and [[Alpha Centauri]] (known also as Al Rijil, or by the Terran astronomical abbreviation ACen). Fandom and various altcanon works assert that founding member Alpha Centauri is home to a human race (transplanted by the Preservers from classical third-century BC Greece) known as, variously, the Centaurans, the Centaurians, or the Centauri, a perspective supported by the description of [[Zefram Cochrane]], in the classic episode "[[Metamorphosis (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Metamorphosis]]", as "Zefram Cochrane of Alpha Centauri". Altcanon explanations hold that Cochrane was either a Centauri himself or, more likely, a resident (the novel ''Federation'', for instance, sets his home on Alpha Centauri B II, the second planet orbiting the trinary's secondary star) of a Terran colony in the ACen system. The films have since cemented this in canonical truth, with Cochrane born on Earth but retiring to his final years on Alpha Centauri before his disappearance and presumed death.

The once-official but now altcanon 1980-to-2188 historical guide ''[[Star Trek Spaceflight Chronology]]'' posits the UFP as being incorporated at 'the first Babel Interplanetary Conference' in 2087.

''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' later portrays the Federation's actual founding in "[[Zero Hour (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Zero Hour]]" and "[[These Are the Voyages...]]", along with preparatory negotiations in "[[Demons (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Demons]]" and "[[Terra Prime]]". Alpha Centauri never appears as a cofounder of the Federation, a compact initially and explicitly seen as being between only four peoples: mankind, Vulcans, Andorians, and Tellarites. The ACen colony could possibly have achieved independence between Terra Prime and These Are the Voyages..., and then helped form the wider Federation as a separate member; yet Alpha Centauri is only ever mentioned as an Earth colony on screen. In an alternate timeline in the ''Deep Space Nine'' episode "[[Past Tense (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Past Tense]]" in which the Federation is never founded, the Alpha Centauri colony is under Romulan control.

In the six related novels ''A Time to Kill'', ''A Time to Heal'', ''A Time For War'', ''A Time For Peace'', ''Errand of Vengeance: Seeds of Rage'', and ''Articles of the Federation'', the Federation Council occupies the floors below the UFP president's office in the Palais de la Concorde. (This may contradict elements of ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home|The Voyage Home]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Voyager|Voyager]]''.)

In altcanon works such as the ''Star Trek Star Fleet Technical Manual'' and the novel ''Articles of the Federation'', the Federation's founding document is the Articles of Federation, in line with fan tradition. Yet in ''Voyager''{{'}}s "[[The Void (Star Trek: Voyager)|The Void]]", the founding document appears onscreen (its preamble a reworked version of the UN Charter's), with the heading "Charter of the United Federation of Planets", a founding document in accordance with [[Star Trek canon|canon]]. [[Charter]] also appears in ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise|Enterprise]]'' and in ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|DS9]]''{{'}}s "Accession" in  discussion of federation membership requirements. This episode intimates that while the timeframe for a planet's entry is ten years past the submission of its request, the Federation is willing to halve that time for Bajor, an exemption similarly seen in ''[[Star Trek: Insurrection|Insurrection]]''. In ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|Next Generation]]''{{'}}s "[[The Drumhead]]", Picard calls the founding document the Constitution, establishing that as an alternate designation. Novels like ''Articles of the Federation'' presume that it's known by all three names.

Various novels detail more fully the inner workings of Federation government, such as how member worlds choose their council members (it's up to each to decide how to do so) and how presidents are elected (candidates submit their names anonymously and are vetted by the Federation Council, which judges their qualifications for office; elections are by direct popular vote).

==Reception==
The optimistic view of the future present in the Federation has been highlighted as unique among most [[science fiction]], showing how "civilized" the future could conceivably be.&lt;ref name="newyorktimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/24/opinion/global/24iht-june24-ihtmag-das-32.html?_r=0 |title=Astronomical!

'''Value stream mapping software''' is a type of [[software]] that helps prepare and/or analyze value stream maps.

 By Michael L. George&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details of VSM software==

There are various types of value stream mapping software, these include those  that can be used to simply design and construct the maps to software that can carry out calculations and perform detailed analysis.  Typically, the software is available as either enhancements to already available programs or standalone products specifically designed for [[value stream mapping]].

==Benefits  of using software==

While value stream maps are not overly difficult to construct, utilizing software can help speed up the process and  simplify calculations&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Value Stream Maps I: Plant Level Maps for Discrete Parts and Assemblies by D. Patel, H. Ranpuria, J. Fournier, and J. Shah&lt;/ref&gt; that help make up a completed map.  (These calculations include elements such as takt time, inventory, and value-add time).  Further enhancements often include tools that can analyze the current process and facilitate future state maps (with the provision of "what if" and scenario modelling). Such tools also make it easier to engage the extended team (management, suppliers, finance, etc.) through more accurate, clearer presentation of the current state.

==Drawbacks to using software==

Some lean practitioners claim that hand drawn maps are of more benefit describing value stream mapping as a pencil and paper activity.  Others state that the most valuable part of a value stream mapping activity are the maps themselves and whilst software can be used for documenting the findings it shouldn't detract from the process.&lt;ref&gt;Improving the Extended Value Stream: Lean for the Entire Supply Chain by Darren Dolcemascolo&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Public Garbage Bin in Nacka.jpg|thumb|Public waste container in Sweden]]
A '''waste container''' is a [[container]] for temporarily storing waste, and is usually made out of [[metal]] or [[plastic]]. Some common terms are '''dustbin'''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.csb.gov.hk/hkgcsb/glossary/glossary_search_en.php?search_name1=dustbin&lt;/ref&gt;, '''garbage can''', and '''trash can'''. The words "rubbish", "basket" and "bin" are more common in British English usage; "trash" and "can" are more common in American English usage.  "Garbage" may refer to [[food waste]] specifically (when distinguished from "trash") or to [[municipal solid waste]] in general. In 1875, the first household rubbish bins were introduced in Britain to create a regulated system of collection.

== Public waste collection ==
In many cities and towns, there is a public waste collection service which regularly collects household waste from outside buildings etc. This will be loaded into a [[garbage truck]] and driven to a [[landfill]], [[incinerator]] or crush facility to be disposed of. Household waste containers are usually either: 
* trash cans, receptacles made of metal or plastic
* wheelie bins, light, mobile plastic bins&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smyth|first1=Sara|title=Councils to reduce size of wheelie bins by almost half for 6 million households in bid to cut expenses and meet recycling targets|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2539639/Councils-reduce-size-wheelie-bins-50-6million-households-bid-cut-expenses-meet-recycling-targets.html|accessdate=16 August 2015|work=Mail Online [[Daily Mail]]|publisher=Associated Newspapers|date=15 January 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922002050/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2539639/Councils-reduce-size-wheelie-bins-50-6million-households-bid-cut-expenses-meet-recycling-targets.html|archivedate=22 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some areas, each household has multiple bins for different categories of rubbish (usually represented by colours) depending on its suitability for [[recycling]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ccc.govt.nz/services/rubbish-and-recycling/ "Rubbish and recycling"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612123209/http://www.ccc.govt.nz/services/rubbish-and-recycling |date=2016-06-12 }}, ccc.govt.nz&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial roadside waste containers are often larger [[Dumpster|dumpsters]] or [[skip (container)|skip]]s.

== Public litter bins ==

[[File:Taiwan 2009 Taipei Waste Containers throughout Liberty Plaza with National Theater in background FRD 7440.jpg|thumb|170px|Waste containers at the [[National Theater and Concert Hall, Republic of China|National Theater]] in [[Taipei City|Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]]]

Public areas, such as [[parks]], often have [[litter]] bins placed to improve the [[social environment]] by encouraging people not to [[littering|litter]]. Such bins in outdoor locations or other busy [[public]] areas are usually mounted to the ground or wall to discourage [[theft]], and reduce [[vandalism]], and to [[beautification|improve their appearance]] are sometimes deliberately artistic or cute. In dense urban areas, trash is stored underground below the receptacle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shendruk |first1=Amanada |title=Could NYC solve its trash problem with underground trash cans? |url=https://qz.com/1329108/sensor-enabled-trash-bins-could-help-nyc-solve-its-waste-problem/ |accessdate=5 September 2018 |work=[[Quartz (publication)]] |date=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some trash cans have plastic bags to help contain liquids.

== Metaphors ==
[[File:International tidyman.svg|thumb|upright|International symbol "Tidyman" used on packaging to remind people to dispose of it in a bin instead of [[littering]]]]
The term "garbage can" is also used for a model of decision making, the "[[Garbage Can Model]]" of decision making. It is concerned with cases of decision making in great aggregate uncertainty which can cause decisions to arise that from a distant point of view might seem irrational. 

A "[[Recycle bin (computing)|trash can]]" metaphor is often used in computer operating system desktop environments as a place files can be moved for deletion. 

In a workplace setting, a bin may be euphemistically called "the [[circular file]]", "the [[File 13|round file]]" or "the janitor's file".  Whereas useful documents are filed in a [[filing cabinet]], which is rectangular, junk mail and other worthless items are "filed" in the bin, which is often round.

'''''Win Bigly: Persuasion in a World Where Facts Don't Matter''''' is a 2017 nonfiction book by [[Scott Adams]], creator of [[Dilbert]], and bestselling author of ''[[How To Fail At Everything and Still Win Big]]''. The book presents Adams's theory that [[Donald Trump]]'s victory in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]] was due to Trump being a "master persuader" with a deep understanding of persuasion and the human mind.&lt;ref name=introduction&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adams|first1=Scott|title=Win Bigly: Persuasion in a World Where Facts Don't Matter|date=2018|publisher=Portfolio|isbn=9780735219717|language=en|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Adams publically predicted Trump's victory. Adams later cited his research into the field of [[Modes of persuasion|persuasion]] as the basis for his claim. He wrote ''Win Bigly'' to analyze Trump's tactics and offer guidance to improve readers' communication skills.&lt;ref name="Reason"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://reason.com/reasontv/2018/02/07/dilberts-scott-adams-explains-prediction |title=Dilbert's Scott Adams Explains How He Knew Trump Would 'Win Bigly' |last1=Gillespie |first1=Nick |last2=Keyser |first2=Ian |date=February 7, 2018 |website=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] |publisher= |access-date=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes people who, like Trump, are skilled at convincing listeners as "master persuaders".&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.floridatoday.com/story/money/business/2018/06/21/watson-wins-bigly-machines-learn-art-persuasion/36240703/ |title=Watson Wins Bigly: Machines learn the art of persuasion |last=Tilley |first=Scott |date=June 21, 2018 |website=[[Florida Today]] |access-date=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He posits that when debating an issue, facts are only important when they can impact at an emotional level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.libertynation.com/jobs-not-mobs-more-than-just-a-slogan/ |title=Jobs Not Mobs – More than Just a Slogan |last=Charles |first=Jeff |date=October 28, 2018 |website=Liberty Nation |access-date=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''[[Florida Today]]'' described the subject matter as "something of great value in today’s media-saturated environment",&lt;ref name="FT"/&gt; and ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' thought ''Win Bigly'' was "highly readable" and handled in a skillful and humorous manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-7352-1971-7 |title=Win Bigly: Persuasion in a World Where Facts Don’t Matter  |last= |first= |date= |website=[[Publishers Weekly]] |access-date=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Politico]], however, found the book to be "an oxygen-free cubicle into which is piped a barking infomercial for the president".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is This the Worst Explanation for Why Trump Won?|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/10/31/donald-trump-election-dilbert-facts-persuasion-215766|website=POLITICO Magazine|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Win Bigly'' was a best-seller and brought increased attention to Adams' blog, which led ''[[Forbes]]'' to speculate that Adams was using the opportunity presented by Trump to protect his own career as the newspaper industry declines.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelschein/2018/06/20/dilbert-creator-scott-adams-is-evil-and-why-you-should-follow-his-lead/#447768fd30a7 |title=Dilbert Creator Scott Adams Is Evil (And Why You Should Follow His Lead) |last=Schein |first=Michael |date=June 20, 2018 |website=[[Forbes]] |access-date=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wayne Woodrow "Woody" Hayes''' (February 14, 1913 – March 12, 1987) was an [[American football]] player and coach. He served as the head coach at [[Denison University]] (1946–1948), [[Miami University]] in [[Oxford, Ohio]] (1949–1950), and [[Ohio State University]] (1951–1978), compiling a career [[college football]] record of 238 wins, 72 losses, and 10 ties.

During his 28 seasons as the head coach of the [[Ohio State Buckeyes football]] program, Hayes' teams won five [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national championships]] (1954, 1957, 1961, 1968, 1970),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/schools/osu/graphics/pdf/m-footbl/1314_p227to277.pdf|title=Ohio State Results by Year|publisher=Ohio State University|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; captured 13 [[Big Ten Conference]] titles, and amassed a record of 205–61–10. Over the last decade of his coaching tenure at Ohio State, Hayes's Buckeye squads faced off in a fierce rivalry against the [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan Wolverines]] coached by [[Bo Schembechler]], a former player under and assistant coach to Hayes. During that stretch in the [[Michigan–Ohio State football rivalry]], dubbed "[[The Ten Year War]]", Hayes and Schembechler's teams won or shared the Big Ten Conference crown every season and usually each placed in the national rankings.

Despite his great achievements at Ohio State, Hayes's coaching career ended ignominiously when he was dismissed from his position as head coach after punching Clemson nose guard Charlie Bauman for intercepting an Ohio State pass with two minutes left on the clock in the [[1978 Gator Bowl]].  He was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] as a coach in 1983.

==Early years==
A native of [[Clifton, Ohio]], Hayes was the youngest of three children born to Wayne B. and Effie (née Hupp) Hayes.  He played [[Center (American football)|center]] at [[Newcomerstown High School]] in [[Newcomerstown, Ohio]]. At [[Denison University]], he played [[offensive tackle|tackle]] under coach Tom Rogers, and was a member of [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity. After graduating from Denison in 1935, Hayes went on to serve as an assistant at two [[Ohio]] high schools: [[Mingo Junction]] in 1935–1936 and [[New Philadelphia, Ohio|New Philadelphia]] in 1937. When New Philadelphia head coach John Brickels left to accept another position, Hayes was elevated to the head coaching position, where he put together a 17–2–1 record in his first two seasons before enduring a 1–9 record in 1940.

Hayes enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] in July 1941, eventually rising to the rank of [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] during [[World War II]]. He commanded ''PC 1251'' in the [[Palau Islands]] invasion and the destroyer-escort [[USS Rinehart|USS ''Rinehart'']] in both the Atlantic and Pacific operations.

As World War II was near its end, and Hayes' alma mater, Denison University, was pursuing plans to reinstate its football program (which had been suspended during the war), it contacted former head coach Rogers (also in the Navy) about rejoining the program as head coach. Rogers declined, but recommended that his former team captain, Hayes, should be named the next head coach. Denison was able to locate and give Hayes an offer, which he accepted, minutes before his Navy ship was to begin the voyage through the [[Panama Canal]] &amp;mdash; meaning Hayes would have been [[Solitary confinement|incommunicado]] for an extended period of time.

==Coaching at Denison and Miami University==
Upon returning to Denison in 1946, Hayes had a hard first year, winning only 2 games, over Capital and the season finale against Wittenberg. However, that victory sparked a 19-game winning streak, a surge that propelled him into the head coaching position at Miami University. Miami is recognized as the "[[Cradle of Coaches]]" because of its history of outstanding coaches starting their careers there, such as [[Paul Brown]], [[Ara Parseghian]], [[Weeb Ewbank]], [[Bill Mallory]], [[Sid Gillman]], [[Randy Walker (American football coach)|Randy Walker]], and [[Bo Schembechler]]. Gillman was Hayes' immediate predecessor at Miami before Gillman moved down the road to coach at the [[University of Cincinnati]], which was then Miami's chief rival. Hayes and Gillman maintained a sparkling feud between themselves, combining mutual distaste for the other's coaching style, and because they were in recruiting competition in the same general area.&lt;ref&gt;

In his second year with the [[Miami Redhawks football|Miami Redskins]], Hayes led the 1950 team to an appearance in the [[Salad Bowl (American College Football)|Salad Bowl]], where they defeated [[Arizona State University|Arizona State]]. That success led him to accept the Ohio State head coaching position on February 18, 1951, in a controversial decision after the university rejected the applications of other more well-known coaches, including former Buckeyes' head coach [[Paul Brown]], incumbent Buckeye assistant Harry Strobel, and Missouri head coach [[Don Faurot]].&lt;ref&gt;Lombardo, ''op.cit''. pp.84-85&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ohio State==
[[File:Woody Hayes, Dick Doyle and Ernie Godfrey (1952).jpg|left|165px|thumb|Hayes with fullback Dick Doyle and assistant coach Ernie Godfrey, 1952]]
As head coach of the [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State Buckeyes]], Hayes led his teams to a 205–61–10 record (.761), including three consensus national championships (1954,1957 and 1968), two other non-consensus national titles (1961 and 1970), 13 [[Big Ten Conference football champions|Big Ten conference championships]], and eight [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] appearances. Hayes was a three-time winner of The College Football Coach of the Year Award, now known as the [[Paul "Bear" Bryant Award]], and was "the subject of more varied and colorful anecdotal material than any other coach past or present, including fabled [[Knute Rockne]]", according to biographer Jerry Brondfield.

Hayes' basic coaching philosophy was that "nobody could win football games unless they regarded the game positively and would agree to pay the price that success demands of a team." His conservative style of football (especially on offense) was often described as "three yards and a cloud of dust"—in other words, a "crunching, frontal assault of muscle against muscle, bone upon bone, will against will." The basic, bread-and-butter play in Hayes' playbook was a fullback off-guard run or a tailback off tackle play. Hayes was often quoted as saying "only three things can happen when you pass (a completion, an incompletion, and an interception) and two of them are bad."

In spite of this apparent willingness to avoid change, Hayes became one of the first major college head coaches to recruit [[African-American]] players, including [[Jim Parker (American football)|Jim Parker]], who played both offensive and defensive tackle on Hayes' first national championship team in 1954. While Hayes was not the first to recruit African-Americans to Ohio State, he was the first to recruit and start African-Americans in large numbers there and to hire African-American assistant coaches.

Another Hayes' recruit, [[Archie Griffin]], was the only two-time [[Heisman Trophy]] winner in seven decades of selections. Altogether, Hayes had 58 players earn [[All-America]] honors under his tutelage. Many notable football coaches, such as [[Lou Holtz]], [[Bill Arnsparger]], [[Bill Mallory]], [[Dick Crum (football coach)|Dick Crum]], [[Bo Schembechler]], [[Ara Parseghian]] and Woody's successor, [[Earle Bruce]], served as his assistants at various times.

Hayes would often use illustrations from historical events to make a point in his coaching and teaching. When Hayes was first hired to be the head coach at Ohio State, he was also made a "full professor of physical education", having earned an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] degree in educational administration from Ohio State in 1948. The classes that he taught on campus were usually full, and he was called "Professor Hayes" by students. Hayes also taught mandatory English and [[vocabulary]] classes to his freshman football players. One of his students was a basketball player named [[Bobby Knight]], who was to become a legendary basketball coach.

During his time at Ohio State, Hayes' relationships with students faculty members were particularly good. Even those members of the faculty who believed that the role of [[intercollegiate athletics]] was growing out of control respected Hayes personally for his commitment to academics, the standards of integrity with which he ran his program, and the genuine enthusiasm he brought to his hobby as an amateur historian. Hayes often ate lunch or dinner at the university's faculty club, interacting with faculty and administrators.

As a coach and an educator, Hayes was one of the first to use the [[motion picture]] as a teaching and learning tool.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} He was also memorable in that he could be seen walking across campus, taking the time to visit with students.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} When talking to young people, Hayes treated all with respect, without regard to race or socio-economic class.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} This behavior by Hayes was helpful to Ohio State to quell the violence and damage from anti-war demonstrations that other college campuses suffered in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He would actually take the time to communicate with student leaders. Then-team quarterback [[Rex Kern]] said, "Woody was out there on the Oval with the protesters, and he'd grab a bullhorn and tell the students to express their beliefs but not be destructive. He believed in [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]], and he believed in [[the Establishment]], but he wasn't afraid to talk to the students. He wanted to stay close to the action."&lt;ref&gt;Lombardo, ''op.cit''. pp.195-197&lt;/ref&gt; Hayes was considered one of the few authority figures that students then had respect for. His enthusiasm for coaching and winning was such that many across the nation consider the following maxim to be true: "What [[Vince Lombardi]] was to professional football, Woody Hayes was to college football."{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

During his tenure at Ohio State, Hayes would joke that he considered himself to be [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]]'s best recruiter because if he could not convince a recruit to come to Ohio State instead of Michigan he would try to steer the recruit to Notre Dame, whom Ohio State did not play. While Hayes' public stance was that he refused to play Notre Dame because he was afraid of polarizing the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] population in Ohio, Notre Dame's long-time athletic director [[Moose Krause|Edward "Moose" Krause]] said that Hayes had told him that Hayes liked having Michigan as the only tough game on the Ohio State schedule and that having the Buckeyes play Notre Dame would detract from that.&lt;ref&gt;

After losses or ties, Hayes would conduct locker room interviews while naked. A journalist from his tenure noted, "He was an ugly guy so it would clear the locker room out pretty fast."&lt;ref name=CPD021209&gt;[http://www.cleveland.com/osu/index.ssf/2009/02/leonard_downie_jr_regrettably.html Leonard Downie Jr. regrettably recalls Woody Hayes holding interviews while naked], ''Cleveland Plain Dealer'', February 12, 2009, Accessed February 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TL021209&gt;Richard Oviatt, [http://media.www.thelantern.com/media/storage/paper333/news/2009/02/12/Campus/Washington.Post.Editor.Leonard.Downie.Jr.Talks.Past.Future-3625084.shtml Washington Post editor Leonard Downie Jr. talks past, future] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215165400/http://media.www.thelantern.com/media/storage/paper333/news/2009/02/12/Campus/Washington.Post.Editor.Leonard.Downie.Jr.Talks.Past.Future-3625084.shtml |date=2009-02-15 }}, ''The Lantern'', February 12, 2009, Accessed February 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In 1959, following a 17−0 loss to [[USC Trojans football|USC]], Hayes threw a punch at ''[[Los Angeles Examiner]]'' sportswriter Al Bine, but missed, and punched the brother of ''Pasadena Independent'' sports editor Bob Shafer in the back instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Didn't Punch Scribe, Woody Hayes Insists |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=W-EyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dQAGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4708,328808 |newspaper=Sunday Herald |date=October 4, 1959 |accessdate=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a May 1965 meeting of Big Ten Conference athletic directors and coaches, Hayes nearly started a fight with [[Iowa Hawkeyes|Iowa's]] athletic director, [[Forest Evashevski]], before being restrained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hayes, Evashevski Nearly Come To Blows At Meeting |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=saZfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VzIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6124,3370355 |newspaper=[[Lewiston Morning Tribune]] |date=May 21, 1965 |accessdate=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Hayes team won a game against rival [[1968 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]], 50–14.  Late in that game, Ohio State held a commanding 44–14 advantage and scored one final touchdown. Rather than taking the more common [[extra point]] kick, Hayes instead opted for a [[two-point conversion]], but was unsuccessful, leading many football fans to believe that Hayes was [[running up the score]]. When asked later why he went for two points, Hayes said, "Because they wouldn’t let me go for three.”

Prior to the [[1973 Rose Bowl]], Hayes shoved a camera into the face of a news photographer. As a result, Hayes was suspended for three games, fined $2,000, and left California with a [[subpoena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Strode, George |title=Despite Many Outbursts Woody Hayes Has Humanitarian Side Seldom Publicized |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=keFIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ioIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2432,2505387 |newspaper=[[Youngstown Vindicator]] |date=January 7, 1973 |accessdate=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, a late fumble at Michigan caused him to charge at [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] cameraman Mike Freedman, who recorded his frustration; Hayes was [[ejection (sports)|ejected]], put on [[probation]] by the Big Ten Conference, and fined $2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mooshil, Joe |title=Duke Puts Woody on Probation |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3nIyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YawFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2690,3281794 |newspaper=[[The Argus-Press]] |date=December 3, 1977 |accessdate=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1962 Rose Bowl vote===
In the 1961 season, Ohio State won the Big Ten championship, qualifying automatically for the Rose Bowl. At the time, the Big Ten Conference rules stated that the school's Faculty Council must officially approve of the trip. In this unusual development, the Ohio State Faculty Council voted 28 to 25 against the [[1962 Rose Bowl]] trip, prompted by the head of a university alumni group, on the grounds that the school's academic reputation was suffering because of over-emphasis on the football team. Other reports stated that the bid was declined because Ohio State had already beaten their would-be Rose Bowl opponent, [[University of California at Los Angeles|UCLA]], during the regular season. The decision sparked minor rioting on the Ohio State Campus and in the Columbus area. The ''[[Columbus Dispatch]]'' published the names, addresses, and phone numbers of those Faculty Council Members who voted against the trip as well as the amount of university money that they spent on the trips. While Hayes was diplomatic with some faculty members who voted against the trip and urged the students to cease complaining, he did not spare his criticism of the alumni club president who led the charge against accepting the bowl bid.&lt;ref&gt;Lombardo, ''op.cit''. pp.142-145&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comments on the My Lai Massacre===

Speaking at a football [[banquet]] in 1969, Hayes spoke about the recently revealed [[My Lai Massacre]].  He stated that the Vietnamese men in My Lai deserved to die, "and I wouldn't be so sure those women were innocent.  The children are obviously innocent – if they are less than five."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Woody Waves His Flag |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19691212&amp;id=Es4bAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fVAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7306,5888738 |newspaper=[[The Pittsburgh Press]] |date=December 12, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confrontation with Jerry Markbreit===
Late in the 1971 rivalry game against [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], furious over what he thought was a missed defensive [[pass interference]] foul committed by [[Thom Darden]] of Michigan, Hayes stormed onto the field, launched a profanity-laced tirade at referee [[Jerry Markbreit]], and tore up the sideline markers, receiving a 15-yard [[unsportsmanlike conduct]] penalty. Hayes then threw the penalty flag into the crowd, began destroying the yard markers, and threw the first-down marker into the ground like a [[javelin]] before being restrained by Buckeyes team officials; Hayes was then assessed an additional 15-yard penalty and ejected. Hayes was suspended for one game and fined $1,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Woody Hayes Still Fuming Grid's 'Worst Called Play' |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=n6hIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FQENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3884,3100903 |newspaper=[[The Morning Record]] |date=November 23, 1971 |accessdate=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;



===1978 Gator Bowl incident and dismissal===
On December 29, 1978, the Buckeyes played in the [[1978 Gator Bowl|Gator Bowl]] against [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]]. Late in the fourth quarter, Clemson was leading Ohio State 17–15. Freshman quarterback [[Art Schlichter]] managed to get Ohio State into field goal range. On third and 5 at the Clemson 24-yard line with 2:30 left and the clock running, Hayes called a pass rather than a run, because Schlichter was having a great game up to that point. Schlichter's next pass was intercepted by Clemson [[nose guard]] Charlie Bauman, who returned it toward the Ohio State sideline, where he was run out of bounds. After Bauman got back up, Hayes punched him in the throat, triggering a [[bench-clearing brawl]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEVJyf0ft3I&lt;/ref&gt; Hayes stormed onto the field and was abusive towards the referee. When one of Hayes' own players, offensive lineman, [[Ken Fritz]], tried to intervene, Hayes turned on him and had to be restrained by defensive coordinator George Hill. The Buckeyes were assessed two 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalties for Hayes' attack on Bauman and his abuse towards the referee. Bauman was not injured by Hayes' punch and shrugged the incident off. Even though the game was being telecast by ABC, announcers [[Keith Jackson]] and [[Ara Parseghian]] did not comment about the punch. (At the time, all non-press box cameras were operated remotely from another site, and Jackson allegedly did not actually witness the punch, his view of the sidelines being blocked by the upper tier of the stadium).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

After the game, Ohio State Athletic Director Hugh Hindman, who had played for Hayes at Miami of Ohio, and had been an assistant under him for seven years, privately confronted Hayes in the Buckeye locker room. He said that he intended to tell school president [[Harold Leroy Enarson|Harold Enarson]] about what happened, and strongly implied that Hayes had coached his last game at Ohio State. After a heated exchange, Hindman said that he then offered Hayes a chance to resign, but Hayes refused, saying, "That would make it too easy for you. You had better go ahead and fire me." Hindman then met with Enarson at a [[country club]] near [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], and the two agreed that Hayes had to go.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1094478/index.htm Scorecard]. ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', 1979-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Woody Hayes's last stand: Ohio State, Clemson and the punch that ruined Hayes |url=https://www.si.com/college-football/2016/12/23/woody-hayes-punch-clemson-ohio-state |publisher=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next morning, Hindman told Hayes that he had been fired. A press conference was held at the hotel where the team had been staying. The team returned to Columbus around noon, and Hayes left the airport in a police car. Regarding Hayes' dismissal, Enarson said that "there isn't a university or athletic conference in this country that would permit a coach to physically assault a college athlete."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', 12-31-1978, pg.S1&lt;/ref&gt; After the incident, Hayes reflected on his career by saying, "Nobody despises to lose more than I do. That's got me into trouble over the years, but it also made a man of mediocre ability into a pretty good coach." About two months after the incident, Hayes called Bauman in his dorm room, but did not apologize for his previous attack on him. [[Earle Bruce]] succeeded Hayes as Ohio State's head coach.

Many years later, [[Leonard Downie, Jr.]], former executive editor of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and student journalist at Ohio State, said he regretted not reporting an incident in the 1960s where Hayes instructed a player to take off his helmet and then hit him in the head.&lt;ref name="TL021209"/&gt;

According to the 1994 [[Home Box Office|HBO]] documentary ''American Coaches: Men of Vision and Victory'', Hindman had placed Hayes on notice at the beginning of the 1978 season, not just for the swing at the ABC cameraman during the 1977 Michigan game, but also for hitting a player during a practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=American Coaches: Men of Vision and Victory |author=HBO Sports |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his 1989 autobiography, Michigan's [[Bo Schembechler]] wrote that he believed Hayes, who was [[diabetes|diabetic]] and may have had a high [[blood sugar]] level, didn’t believe he struck Bauman. Schembechler also pointed out that Hayes had maintained that all he was trying to do was grab the ball away.&lt;ref&gt;Schembechler &amp; Albom.  p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before and after the dismissal incident, Hayes was a professor of Military History at Ohio State. His office was in the ROTC building, Converse Hall, across the street from Ohio Stadium. For the remainder of his years at OSU, he continued to teach and mentor students.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Final days and death==
On March 11, 1987, Hayes was clearly in failing health when he had someone drive him in his pickup truck to [[Dayton]] to introduce [[Bo Schembechler]], who was speaking at a banquet. Organizers had tried to discourage Hayes from attending, but Hayes insisted. He gave a lengthy introduction to Schembechler and then stayed to hear him speak before being driven back home.&lt;ref&gt;Schembechler &amp; Albom.  p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next morning, March 12, Hayes's wife Anne found him unconscious in his bed at the couple's home.&lt;ref name=Folkart&gt;Burt A.

==Legacy==
Hayes's lifetime record of 238–72–10 placed him ninth in all-time [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Division I FBS coaching victories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.org/library/records/football/football_records_book/2007/2007_d1_football_records_book.pdf|title=page 383|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201142013/http://www.ncaa.org/library/records/football/football_records_book/2007/2007_d1_football_records_book.pdf|archivedate=2007-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 1983.

At Hayes's [[funeral]] at First Community Church in Grandview, Ohio on March 17, 1987, [[President of the United States|former president]] [[Richard Nixon]] delivered the eulogy before a crowd of 1,400, acknowledging the friendship that had begun between the two during his second term as [[U.S. Vice President|vice president]]. Having met Hayes at a reception following a Buckeye win over Iowa in 1957, Nixon recalled, "I wanted to talk about [[American football|football]]. Woody wanted to talk about [[foreign policy]]. And you know Woody—we talked about foreign policy."&lt;ref&gt;Nixon, Richard M. [http://www.dispatch.com/content/blogs/a-look-back/2012/03/remembering-woody-hayes.html "A Tribute to Woody Hayes"], March 17, 1987, quoted in ''[[Columbus Dispatch]]'', March 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, more than 15,000 people took part in a [[funeral|memorial service]] at [[Ohio Stadium]].

Hayes's commitment to academics at Ohio State was evidenced by his request that donations from his family, friends, and supporters be made to the academic side of the university. Following his death and in keeping with his wishes, the Wayne Woodrow Hayes Chair in National Security Studies was established at Ohio State's [[Mershon Center for International Security Studies]]. Professor [[John Mueller]] currently holds the chair. In November 1987, the university dedicated the new [[Woody Hayes Athletic Center]] in his memory.

==Personal life==
Hayes married the former Anne Gross in 1942. Anne Hayes was a formidable and popular woman in her own right, who used to jokingly say at numerous sports banquets, "Divorce Woody? Never! But there were plenty of times I wanted to murder him!"&lt;ref&gt;Lombardo, ''op.cit''. p.40&lt;/ref&gt;  The couple had one son, Steven, who went on to become a lawyer and judge. Coincidentally, the younger Hayes would be assigned to the 2003 trial of former Ohio State standout [[Maurice Clarett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=1618719|title=Clarett case judge is Woody Hayes' son|date=18 September 2003|website=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II movie host===
Because of his knowledge of military history and ongoing popularity, Hayes in the early 1980s hosted the broadcast of six World War II films for [[WBNS-TV]] in Columbus, which has served as the official outlet of Ohio State sports media programming for years, including the football coach's shows. Among the movies broadcast were ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'', ''[[Midway (1976 film)|Midway]]'', ''[[The Wackiest Ship in the Army (film)|The Wackiest Ship in the Army]]'', ''[[The Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel]]'', and ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]''

Hayes would also give salty historical perspectives related to each movie. Hayes' segments, depending upon the movie, were taped in such locations as [[Fort Knox]], [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], the {{USS|Yorktown|CV-10|6}}, and [[Stuttgart]], Germany, where he interviewed [[Manfred Rommel]], Lord Mayor of Stuttgart and the son of [[Erwin Rommel]].

'''Work system''' has been used loosely in many areas. This article concerns its use in understanding IT-reliant systems in organizations. A notable use of the term occurred in 1977 in the first volume of MIS Quarterly in two articles by Bostrom and Heinen (1977). Later Sumner and Ryan (1994) used it to explain problems in the adoption of CASE ([[computer-aided software engineering]]). A number of [[socio-technical systems]] researchers such as Trist and Mumford also used the term occasionally, but seemed not to define it in detail. In contrast, the work system approach defines work system carefully and uses it as a basic analytical concept.

A work system is a system in which human participants and/or machines perform work (processes and activities) using information, technology, and other resources to produce products/services for internal or external customers. Typical business organizations contain work systems that procure materials from suppliers, produce products, deliver products to customers, find customers, create financial reports, hire employees, coordinate work across depa */ ERROR ERROR ERROR \* ed to processing information.
* A [[service system]] is a work system that produces services for its customers.
* A [[project]] is a work system designed to produce a product and then go out of existence.
* A [[supply chain]] is an interorganizational work system devoted to procuring materials and other inputs required to produce a firm’s products.
* An [[ecommerce]] web site can be viewed as a work system in which a buyer uses a seller’s web site to obtain product information and perform purchase transactions.
The relationship between work systems in general and the special cases implies that the same basic concepts apply to all of the special cases, which also have their own specialized vocabulary. In turn, this implies that much of the body of knowledge for the current information systems discipline can be organized around a work system core.

Specific information systems exist to support (other) work systems. Many different degrees of overlap are possible between an information system and a work system that it supports. For example, an information system might provide information for a non-overlapping work system, as happens when a commercial marketing survey provides information to a firm’s marketing managers In other cases, an information system may be an integral part of a work system, as happens in highly automated manufacturing and in ecommerce web sites. In these situations, participants in the work system are also participants in the information system, the work system cannot operate properly without the information system, and the information system has little significance outside of the work system.

== Work system framework ==

The work system approach for understanding systems includes both a static view of a current (or proposed) system in operation and a dynamic view of how a system evolves over time through planned change and unplanned adaptations. The static view is summarized by the work system framework, which identifies the basic elements for understanding and evaluating a work system. An easily recognized triangular representation of the work system framework has appeared in Alter (2002, 2003, 2008, 2013) and elsewhere. The work system itself consists of four elements: the processes and activities, participants, information, and technologies. Five other elements must be included in even a rudimentary understanding of a work system’s operation, context, and significance. Those elements are the products/services produced, customers, environment, infrastructure, and strategies. Customers may also be participants in a work system, as happens when a doctor examines a patient. This framework is prescriptive enough to be useful in describing the system being studied, identifying problems and opportunities, describing possible changes, and tracing how those changes might affect other parts of the work system.

The definitions of the 9 elements of the work system framework are as follows:

'''Processes and activities''' include everything that happens within the work system. The term processes and activities is used instead of the term business process because many work systems do not contain highly structured business processes involving a prescribed sequence of steps, each of which is triggered in a pre-defined manner. Such processes are sometimes described as “artful processes” whose sequence and content “depend on the skills, experience, and judgment of the primary actors.” (Hill et al., 2006)  In effect, business process is but one of a number of different perspectives for analyzing the activities within a work system. Other perspectives with their own valuable concepts and terminology include decision-making, communication, coordination, control, and information processing.

'''Participants''' are people who perform the work. Some may use computers and IT extensively, whereas others may use little or no technology. When analyzing a work system the more encompassing role of work system participant is more important than the more limited role of technology user (whether or not particular participants happen to be technology users). In work systems that are viewed as service systems, it is especially important to identify activities in which customers are participants.

'''Information''' includes codified and non-codified information used and created as participants perform their work. Information may or may not be computerized. Data not related to the work system is not directly relevant, making the distinction between data and information secondary when describing or analyzing a work system.  Knowledge can be viewed as a special case of information.

'''Technologies''' include tools (such as cell phones, projectors, spreadsheet software, and automobiles) and techniques (such as management by objectives, optimization, and remote tracking) that work system participants use while doing their work. 

'''Products/services''' are the combination of physical things, information, and services that the work system produces for its customers' benefit and use. This may include physical products, information products, services, intangibles such as enjoyment and peace of mind, and social products such as arrangements, agreements, and organizations. The term "products/services” is used because the distinction between products and services in marketing and service science (Chesbrough and Spohrer, 2006) is not important for understanding work systems even though product-like vs. service-like is the basis of a series of design dimensions for characterizing and designing the things that a work system produces (Alter, 2012).

'''Customers''' are people who receive direct benefit from products/services the work system produces. Since work systems exist to produce products/services for their customers, an analysis of a work system should consider who the customers are, what they want, and how they use whatever the work system produces. Customers may include external customers who receive an enterprise's products/services and internal customers who are employed by the enterprise, such as customers of a payroll work system. Customers of a work system often are  participants in the work system (e.g., patients in a medical exam, students in an educational setting, and clients in a consulting engagement).

'''Environment''' includes the organizational, cultural, competitive, technical, and regulatory environment within which the work system operates. These factors affect system performance even though the system does not rely on them directly in order to operate. The organization’s general norms of behavior are part of its culture, whereas more specific behavioral norms and expectations about specific activities within the work system are considered part of its processes and activities.

'''Infrastructure''' includes human, informational, and technical resources that the work system relies on even though these resources exist and are managed outside of it and are shared with other work systems. Technical infrastructure includes computer networks, programming languages, and other technologies shared by other work systems and often hidden or invisible to work system participants. From an organizational viewpoint such as that expressed in Star and Bowker (2002) rather than a purely technical viewpoint, infrastructure includes human infrastructure, informational infrastructure, and technical infrastructure, all of which can be essential to a work system’s operation and therefore should be considered in any analysis of a work system.

'''Strategies''' include the strategies of the work system and of the department(s) and enterprise(s) within which the work system exists. Strategies at the department and enterprise level may help in explaining why the work system operates as it does and whether it is operating properly.

== Work system life cycle model ==

The dynamic view of a work system starts with the work system life cycle (WSLC) model, which shows how a work system may evolve through multiple iterations of four phases: operation and maintenance, initiation, development, and implementation. The names of the phases were chosen to describe both computerized and non-computerized systems, and to apply regardless of whether application software is acquired, built from scratch, or not used at all. The terms development and implementation have business-oriented meanings that are consistent with Markus and Mao’s (2004) distinction between system development and system implementation.

This model encompasses both planned and unplanned change. Planned change occurs through a full iteration encompassing the four phases, i.e., starting with an operation and maintenance phase, flowing through initiation, development, and implementation, and arriving at a new operation and maintenance phase. Unplanned change occurs through fixes, adaptations, and experimentation that can occur within any phase. The phases include the following activities:

=== Operation and maintenance ===
* Operation of the work system and monitoring of its performance
* Maintenance of the work system (which often includes at least part of information systems that support it) by identifying small flaws and eliminating or minimizing them through fixes, adaptations, or workarounds.
* On-going improvement of processes and activities through analysis, experimentation, and adaptation

=== Initiation ===
* Vision for the new or revised work system
* Operational goals
* Allocation of resources and clarification of time frames
* Economic, organizational, and technical feasibility of planned changes

=== Development ===
* Detailed requirements for the new or revised work system (including requirements for information systems that support it)
* As necessary, creation, acquisition, configuration, and modification of procedures, documentation, training material, software and hardware
* Debugging and testing of hardware, software, and documentation

=== Implementation ===
* Implementation approach and plan (pilot? phased? big bang?)
* Change management efforts about rationale and positive or negative impacts of changes
* Training on details of the new or revised information system and work system
* Conversion to the new or revised work system
* Acceptance testing

As an example of the iterative nature of a work system’s life cycle, consider the sales system in a software start-up. The first sales system is the CEO selling directly. At some point the CEO can’t do it alone, several salespeople are hired and trained, and marketing materials are produced that can be used by someone less expert than the CEO. As the firm grows, the sales system becomes regionalized and an initial version of sales tracking software is developed and used. Later, the firm changes its sales system again to accommodate needs to track and control a larger salesforce and predict sales several quarters in advance. A subsequent iteration might involve the acquisition and configuration of CRM software. The first version of the work system starts with an initiation phase. Each subsequent iteration involves deciding that the current sales system is insufficient; initiating a project that may or may not involve significant changes in software; developing the resources such as procedures, training materials, and software that are needed to support the new version of the work system; and finally, implementing the new work system.

The pictorial representation of the work system life cycle model places the four phases at the vertices of rectangle. Forward and backward arrows between each successive pair of phases indicate the planned sequence of the phases and allow the possibility of returning to a previous phase if necessary. To encompass both planned and unplanned change, each phase has an inward facing arrow to denote unanticipated opportunities and unanticipated adaptations, thereby recognizing the importance of diffusion of innovation, experimentation, adaptation, emergent change, and path dependence.

The work system life cycle model is iterative and includes both planned and unplanned change. It is fundamentally different from the frequently cited [[Systems Development Life Cycle]] (SDLC), which actually describes projects that attempt to produce software or produce changes in a work system. Current versions of the SDLC may contain iterations but they are basically iterations within a project. More important, the system in the SDLC is a basically a technical artifact that is being programmed. In contrast, the system in the WSLC is a work system that evolves over time through multiple iterations. That evolution occurs through a combination of defined projects and incremental changes resulting from small adaptations and experimentation. In contrast with control-oriented versions of the SDLC, the WSLC treats unplanned changes as part of a work system’s natural evolution.

== Work system method ==

The work system method (Alter, 2002; 2006; 2013) is a method that business professionals (and/or IT professionals) can use for understanding and analyzing a work system at whatever level of depth is appropriate for their particular concerns. It has evolved iteratively starting in around 1997. At each stage, the then current version was tested by evaluating the areas of success and the difficulties experienced by MBA and EMBA students trying to use it for a practical purpose. A version called “work-centered analysis” that was presented in a textbook has been used by a number of universities as part of the basic explanation of systems in organizations, to help students focus on business issues, and to help student teams communicate. Ramiller (2002) reports on using a version of the work system framework within a method for “animating” the idea of business process within an undergraduate class. In a research setting, Petrie (2004) used the work system framework as a basic analytical tool in a Ph.D. thesis examining 13 ecommerce web sites. Petkov and Petkova (2006) demonstrated the usefulness of the work system framework by comparing grades of students who did and did not learn about the framework before trying to interpret the same ERP case study. More recent evidence of the practical value of a work system approach is from Truex et al. (2010, 2011), which summarized results from 75 and later 300 management briefings produced by employed MBA students based on a work system analysis template. These briefings contained the kind of analysis that would be discussed in the initiation phase of the WSLC, as decisions were being made about which projects to pursue and how to proceed.

Results from analyses of real world systems by typical employed MBA and EMBA students indicate that a systems analysis method for business professionals must be much more prescriptive than [[soft systems methodology]] (Checkland, 1999).  While not a straitjacket, it must be at least somewhat procedural and must provide vocabulary and analysis concepts while at the same time encouraging the user to perform the analysis at whatever level of detail is appropriate for the task at hand. The latest version of the work system method is organized around a general problem-solving outline that includes:

* Identify the problem or opportunity
* Identify the work system that has that problem or opportunity (plus relevant constraints and other considerations)
* Use the work system framework to summarize the work system
* Gather relevant data.
* Analyze using design characteristics, measures of performance, and work system principles.
* Identify possibilities for improvement.
* Decide what to recommend
* Justify the recommendation using relevant metrics and work system principles.

In contrast to systems analysis and design methods for IT professionals who need to produce a rigorous, totally consistent definition of a computerized system, the work system method:

* encourages the user to decide how deep to go
* makes explicit use of the work system framework and work system life cycle model
* makes explicit use of work system principles.
* makes explicit use of characteristics and metrics for the work system and its elements.
* includes work system participants as part of the system (not just users of the software)
* includes codified and non-codified information
* includes IT and non-IT technologies.
* suggests that recommendations specify which work system improvements rely on IS changes, which recommended work system changes don’t rely on IS changes, and which recommended IS changes won’t affect the work system’s operational form.
