      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16410">'''Aesthetic judgement''', often also referred to as ‘taste’, is a concept in [[aesthetics]] which attempts to explain the nature of judgements of [[beauty]] and whether or not these judgements are legitimate.

The key idea for most traditional theories of taste was that objects possessed concrete properties that the perceiver ought to judge as beautiful or not. Failure to make the correct judgement was considered as something deficient within the beholder, whether that be a flaw within the person’s virtue or connected to a lack of knowledge that hinders their ability to perceive the beauty of the object. 

Aesthetic judgement as a concept rose to prominence in the eighteenth century, however its roots can be traced back many years to ancient Greek and medieval philosophers.

== Ancient conceptions of aesthetic judgement ==
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|The central image from Raphael's ''[[The School of Athens]]'' (1509-1511), depicting Plato (left) and Aristotle (right). Plato is depicted pointing upwards, in reference to his theory of forms, whilst Aristotle disagrees and points down towards reality, in reference to his belief in [[empiricism]].]]
[[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek philosophers]] did not possess an explicit concept of aesthetic judgement, however their ideas regarding aesthetics inspired later developments.  

=== Plato ===
[[Plato|Plato’s]] [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] theory held that there is an incorporeal realm in which the perfect [[Theory of forms|Forms]] of reality exist. This includes the perfect Form of Beauty, which one can rise up to through a [[Dialectic|dialectical]] method. Thus, in Plato’s terms, knowledge is critical to developing a better understanding of beauty and thus, a better capacity for aesthetic judgement.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/a-taste/|title=Aesthetic Taste|last=Spicher|first=Michael|date=|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aristotle ===
[[Aristotle]] purported a more [[Experiential knowledge|experiential]] approach to aesthetic judgement, in that beauty was a property of objects being related to their size and proportion. To develop a capacity for aesthetic judgement, one has to observe enough objects of the same kind to uncover the correct form of those things. Both Aristotle and Plato perceived beauty as a property existing outside of human experience, with aesthetic judgement being the capacity to recognise that beauty, developed by the search for beauty in things.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Medieval conceptions of aesthetic judgement ==
Although Medieval philosophers did not possess a particular notion of individual preference or taste, they were particularly preoccupied with a [[Cosmology|cosmological]] interpretation of beauty, with relation to specific [[Ontology|ontological]] properties. This is attributed to the fact that philosophers of the medieval age had an object notion of beauty, and also because it was a common belief that morality was linked with beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marinescu|first=Axia|date=2014-01-01|title=Beauty and Judgement in German Aesthetics|url=https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/hssr/3/1/article-p124.xml|journal=Human &amp; Social Studies. Research and Practice|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|doi=10.2478/hssr-2013-0024|issn=2285-5920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Augustine of Hippo ===
Expanding upon Plato’s Theory of the Forms, [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] believed that perfect beauty existed within God. Augustine proposed equality and unity as the two properties that made physical objects beautiful. Aesthetic judgement is thus the ability of an individual to recognise the unity and equality of an object, thus involving an exercise of reason and knowledge, similar to the theories of previous thinkers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since the ultimate state of beauty exists in God’s mind, an observer can only recognise this through [[divine illumination]]. Thus, one’s capacity for aesthetic judgement is improved the closer one is to God.

=== Thomas Aquinas ===
[[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] also presented properties that make an object beautiful: proportion, wholeness and radiance. Thus, similar to his philosophical predecessors, he constituted the judgement of beauty to be dependent on knowledge and occurring through the function of cognition. Possessing a capacity for aesthetic judgement is therefore determined by one’s ability to recognise these properties in observed objects. Aquinas does however diverge from previous philosophers on certain notions. His definition of that beauty as "that which, when seen, pleases" can be interpreted as an implication of the subjectivity of beauty and thus judgements about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wood|first=Robert E.|date=2015-06-23|title=Review of Aquinas on Beauty|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/aquinas-on-beauty/|issn=1538-1617}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he rejects Plato’s Theory of Forms, stating that beauty is a real quality present within objects. Ultimately however he converges upon Augustine’s view that God is the source of all beauty.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== 18th century theories of aesthetic judgement ==
Explicit theories of aesthetic judgement emerged and predominated in the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, being referred to as “the century of taste”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/435824318|title=The century of taste : the philosophical odyssey of taste in the eighteenth century|last=1926-|first=Dickie, George,|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195357134|location=New York|oclc=435824318}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Philosophers developed a more introspective stance to attempt to understand their personal dispositions to beauty.

=== Anthony Cooper, the Third Earl of Shaftesbury ===
[[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Cooper]] (1671-1713), the Third Earl of Shaftesbury, purported his philosophical ideas through his [[Socratic dialogue]] “The Moralists, a Philosophical Rhapsody”, which stands in almost direct contrast to the theories and assumptions posited by Addison.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Shelley|first=James|title=18th Century British Aesthetics|date=2018|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2018/entries/aesthetics-18th-british/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaftesbury claimed that taste was a quality innate within human beings. One’s capacity to observe and make correct judgements of beauty was dependent on one’s moral righteousness. The key property Shaftesbury ascribed to beautiful objects is harmony, the prime source of which is nature, which in turn is formed by God who is constituted as the ultimate source of beauty.

=== Joseph Addison ===
[[Joseph Addison]] (1672-1719) posited theories that were in almost direct contrast to those of Shaftesbury. Central to Addison’s theory of aesthetic judgement is the concept that pleasures of taste are essentially “pleasures of the imagination”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Addison’s fundamental divergence from Shaftesbury is that he views taste to be a judgement of visual representation as exercised by the imagination, rather than as an exercise of the intellect and of moral righteousness. Addison constituted two types of pleasures of the imagination: primary pleasures, as in those derived from visual images directly observed by an individual of an object in front of them and secondary pleasures, which arise from images of objects that are absent from sight and therefore exist only in the mind. Addison’s materialist basis predisposes his theory to subjectivism and relativism, leading Addison to declare that there “is not perhaps any real beauty”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Alexander Gerard ===
[[Alexander Gerard]] (1728-1795) considered taste in a similar fashion to the six external [[Sense|senses]], in that experiences of aesthetic judgement are also simple and instantaneous. He also developed his views from the philosophical framework of [[associationism]]. Aesthetic judgements are exercises of the faculty of imagination, in which a newly observed object is associated to previous ideas in the mind of the observer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Gerard determines that taste is improved when a person exercises their capacities for judgment and taste to recognise the four core elements of sensibility, refinement, correctness and proportion within objects.

== David Hume's theory of taste ==
David Hume’s theories on aesthetic judgement were purported in his 1757 essay ''[[Four Dissertations|Of the Standard of Taste]]''. Hume ascribed some normative quality to aesthetic judgements whilst providing critiques of the more relativist positions on the matter. Whilst acknowledging that judgements cannot reasonably be determined to be objectively true or false, he championed the notion of “common sense”, which held that some evaluations are better than others.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.mnstate.edu/gracyk/courses/phil%20of%20art/hume_and_kant.htm|title=Aesthetic theories of David Hume and Immanuel Kant|website=web.mnstate.edu|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hume also reinforced the conception of aesthetic judgements as an exercise of the faculty of the imagination, determining beauty to not be a property of objects but existing only in the mind, and the ones that are deemed more beautiful are the ones that affect the higher sentiments, or high cognitive or intellectual capacities of the observer. Hume also sought to establish a universal standard of aesthetic judgement, seeking a basis upon which we can “confirm” one sentiment and “condemn” another.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In doing this he refers to [[Classic book|classic texts]] which seemingly have received universal acclaim beyond through different times and cultures. Hume asserts that such universal acclamation identifies a work of real genius, and such works should be examined to provide us with guidelines for the composition of good art. Hume provides characteristics of what he refers to as a true judge in matters of aesthetics:
[[File:Painting of David Hume.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of David Hume'' ''(1711-1776)'']]
{{Quote|text="Strong sense, united to delicate sentiment, improved by practice, perfected by comparison, and cleared of all prejudice”|sign=David Hume|source="Four Dissertations", Of the Standard of Taste}}The consensus of these critics constitutes what Hume called a “joint verdict”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/aesthetic-judgment|title=Aesthetic Judgment {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which composes the "true standard"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; for aesthetic judgements. This standard is constituted as universally correct, and failure to recognise pleasure in the object is considered a defect within the observer.

Hume does concede however that certain subjectivities affecting aesthetic judgements cannot be eliminated. He indicates two circumstances that will create irrevocable prejudices. First he refers to natural, generational and cultural dispositions which are fundamental and relative to individuals. The second is determined by the critics’ degree of moral righteousness. Ascribing a normative characteristic to morality, Hume declares that aesthetic merit is influenced by “the natural boundaries of vice and virtue”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;, and if the artist does not conform to these moral regulations then they and their art will inevitably divert from Hume’s true standard.

== Immanuel Kant's "judgement of taste" ==
Central to the concept of aesthetic judgement is Kant’s notion of the “judgement of taste”, introduced in his seminal 1790 book the ''[[Critique of Judgment|Critique of Judgement]].'' In the text, Kant determined two essential conditions for a judgement to be classified as a judgement of taste – subjectivity and universality. 

Subjectivity refers to the fact that a judgement of taste is based on a feeling of pleasure or displeasure. The second necessary condition of a judgement of taste is that it claims “universal validity”, which Kant describes as follows:

{{Quote|text=“… when [a man] puts a thing on a pedestal and calls it beautiful, he demands the same delight from others. He judges not merely from himself, but for all men, and then speaks of beauty as if it were a property of things”|sign=Immanuel Kant|source=Critique of Judgement}}
Kant emphasises the fact that requiring the agreement of others is an inextricable characteristic of aesthetic judgements. We think that others “ought” to share our judgement, and we blame them if they don’t, as if there was a deficiency within them to recognise beauty and make judgements upon it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Zangwill|first=Nick|title=Aesthetic Judgment|date=2014|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/aesthetic-judgment/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2014|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aesthetic judgements, unique from other types of judgements that Kant lists, therefore make a claim to universal validity. Kant also states that pleasure in beauty is disinterested in that it is desire-free. Whilst agreeing that pleasure in beauty can generate desire, he states that it is an essential characteristic of aesthetic judgements that they are found to be pleasurable because they are judged to be beautiful, rather than being judged as beautiful because they are found to be pleasurable.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/kantaest/#SH2a|title=Immanuel Kant: Aesthetics|last=Burnham|first=Douglas|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant provides a “deep” account of the nature of pleasure in beauty, which states that it accomplished through the simultaneous exercise of the cognitive faculties of imagination and understanding.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This is the premise upon which Kant asserts his normative claim on aesthetic judgements. Because these judgements are a function of cognitive faculties, which Kant assumed can be shared by humans, it must be possible for them to be shared.
Kant also purported that pleasure in beauty can be attributed to our recognition that the qualities of an object conform to basic functions of human cognition. We maintain a presupposition that all objects seemed to be formed in a way that enables them to be analysed by human observers. Beauty is the quality of an object assuming a “form of purposiveness”, despite the absence of an identification of a specific purpose.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When we respond to an object’s appearance without any comprehension of utility, we respond in an aesthetic manner. The feeling of pleasure is a signal that the object is able to be comprehended through exercising the human faculty of understanding. An aesthetic judgement is therefore a judgement about human cognition rather than a material object.

== Nineteenth and twentieth century theories of aesthetic judgement ==
Philosophical concerns with aesthetic judgement declined rapidly after the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, with the majority of discourse shifting to the concept of an aesthetic attitude.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite this, there have been philosophers who have persisted with the concept of aesthetic taste, which has resulted in some notable contributions in contemporary times. 

=== Frank Sibley ===
[[Frank Sibley (philosopher)|Frank Sibley]] (1929-1996) defined aesthetic judgements to be evaluations that apply aesthetic concepts to objects through aesthetic terminology. Taste is thus an individual’s capacity to recognise these properties and employ aesthetic concepts and terms appropriately to describe them.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Sibley also asserts that aesthetic judgements are objective and that beauty is an objective property present within objects, departing from the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century philosophical norm of subjectivist interpretation.

{{Refimprove|date=March 2017}}
'''Analytical jurisprudence''' is a theory of [[jurisprudence]] that draws on the resources of modern [[analytical philosophy]] to try to understand the nature of law. Since the boundaries of analytical philosophy are somewhat vague, it is difficult to say how far it extends.  [[H. L. A. Hart]] was probably the most influential writer in the modern school of analytical jurisprudence,&lt;ref&gt;Bodenheimer, Edgar, [http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7496&amp;context=penn_law_review Modern Analytical Jurisprudence and the Limits of Its Usefulness], [[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]&lt;/ref&gt; though its history goes back at least to [[Jeremy Bentham]].

Analytical jurisprudence is not to be mistaken for [[legal formalism]] (the idea that legal reasoning is or can be modelled as a mechanical, algorithmic process). Indeed, it was the analytical jurists who first pointed out that legal formalism is fundamentally mistaken as a theory of law.

Analytic, or 'clarificatory' jurisprudence uses a neutral point of view and descriptive language when referring to the aspects of legal systems. This was a philosophical development that rejected [[natural law]]'s fusing of what law is and what it ought to be. [[David Hume]] famously argued in ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' that people invariably slip between describing that the world is a certain way to saying therefore we ought to conclude on a particular course of action. But as a matter of pure logic, one cannot conclude that we ought to do something merely because something is the case. So analysing and clarifying the way the world is, must be treated as a strictly separate question to normative and evaluative [[is–ought problem|ought questions]].

The most important questions of analytic jurisprudence are: "[[Definition of law|What are laws]]?"; "What is the law?"; "What is the relationship between law and [[power (social and political)|power]]?"; and, "What is the relationship between law and [[morality]]?" [[Legal positivism]] is the dominant theory, although there are a growing number of critics, who offer their own interpretations.

[[Springer books]] commissioned essays on analytical jurisprudence for ''A Treatise on Legal Philosophy and General Jurisprudence''. {{ISBN|9781402033872}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6858">An '''authors' conference''' or '''writers' conference''' is a type of [[:wikt:conference|conference]] where [[writers]] gather to review their [[writing|written works]] and suggest improvements. This process helps an author improve his or her work and learn to be a better writer for future works, both by receiving [[critique]]s of their own work and by [[mentoring]] the work of the other authors. Writers may also benefit from meeting and hearing from professionals in related fields, such as agents, editors, illustrators, publishers, and providers of other relevant services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.writersdigest.com/editor-blogs/guide-to-literary-agents/literary-agents-explain-why-they-attend-conferences-and-its-not-what-you-think|work=Writers Digest|author=Hoffman, Scott Hoffman | title=Literary Agents Explain Why They Attend Conferences (And It's Not What You Think)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most other conference styles, an authors' conference is very [[participatory]]. Most conferences are divided into [[presentation]]s, each of which has a clear separation of roles among a one or more [[Public speaker|presenter]]s and an audience. While authors' conferences may include some such presentations, writers' conferences also include numerous sessions wherein an author does not present his or her work but rather listens while the other participants discuss the work. In this way, the author gains an understanding of what readers learn by reading the work.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

An authors' conference consists of two phases, shepherding and writers' workshops. Shepherding usually (but not always&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/thewritingcenter-ce/conference |website=Hunter.CUNY.edu |title=Writers' Conference and Intensives: Hunter College's 4th Annual Writers' Conference |date=June 7, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714220817/http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/thewritingcenter-ce/conference |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }} Intensive writing workshops precede the conference.&lt;/ref&gt;) occurs before the conference meeting, and the meeting itself is organized as a writers' workshop.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

One popular series of authors' conferences is the [[Pattern Languages of Programming]] conferences, held to encourage and assist authors of [[software design pattern]]s and [[pattern language]]s.

==Shepherding==
The shepherding process occurs before the conference meeting. Authors submit papers for the conference, then each paper is assigned to a shepherd, an experienced author who works with the submitter to improve his or her paper. The process often consists of three iterations in as many weeks where the shepherd makes suggestions for improvement and the submitter incorporates the suggestions. This one-on-one mentoring using the submitter's unfinished work as an example is very effective for teaching the submitter how to be a better writer, although its effectiveness is ultimately determined by the participants' dedication and their working relationship. At the end of the shepherding process, the shepherd recommends whether to accept the submission for review at the conference. An accepted submission should meet minimal quality standards for effective evaluation in the writers' workshop, and should have been improved significantly by the submitter during the shepherding process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writers' workshop==
The writers' workshop process occurs during the conference meeting. The workshop consists of 6–10 sessions, one per submission to be reviewed. The workshop participants are the authors of those submissions and any other reviewers the authors choose to accept. In a session, the authors of the submission listen quietly while the other participants discuss what they liked about the submission and suggest improvements. This gives the authors of the submission insight into what information readers are learning from the work and ideas for improving the work. Reviewers discussing a work are careful to make productive comments, both because the author is listening and because in other sessions that author will become the reviewer and make comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Mother Bengal represents not only biological motherness but its attributed characteristics as well – protection, never ending love, consolation, care, the beginning and the end of life.

[[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]], an orthodox Brahmin writer, poet and journalist, composed an Ode to Mother Bengal called [[Vande Mataram]] around 1876 as an alternative to the British royal anthem.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sri Aurobindo]] commented on his English translation of the poem, "It is difficult to translate the National Anthem of Bengal into verse in another language owing to its unique union of sweetness, simple directness and high poetic force."  Quoted in Bhabatosh Chatterjee (ed.), ''Bankim Chandra Chatterjee: Essays in Perspective'', Sahitya Akademi, Delhi, 1994, p. 601.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Amar Sonar Bangla]], the national anthem of Bangladesh, [[Rabindranath Tagore]] used the word "Maa" (Mother) numerous times to refer to the motherland, ''i.e.'' Bengal. Despite her popularity in patriotic songs and poems, her physical representations and images are rare.

==History==
===Partition of Bengal (1905)===
During the period of বঙ্গভঙ্গ Bônggôbhônggô&lt;ref&gt;John R. McLane, "The Decision to Partition Bengal in 1905," ''Indian Economic and Social History Review,'' July 1965, 2#3, pp 221–237&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|title=Partition of Bengal|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/60754/partition-of-Bengal|accessdate=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Partition of Bengal (1905)]]) - when the ruling British empire had the province of [[Bengal]] (of undivided India) split into two parts, many Bengali intellectuals joined cultural and political movement against the partition. The partition took place in October 1905 and separated the largely Muslim eastern areas from the largely Hindu western areas. The Hindus of West Bengal who dominated Bengal's business and rural life complained that the division would make them a minority in a province that would incorporate the [[Bihar and Orissa Province]].&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; It was during this time the Mother Bengal was an immensely popular theme in Bengali patriotic songs and poems and was mentioned in several of them, such as the song ″[[Dhana Dhanya Pushpa Bhara]]″  and ″[[Banga Amar Janani Amar]]″ (Our Bengal Our Mother) by [[Dwijendralal Ray]]. These songs were meant to rekindle the unified spirit of Bengal, to raise public consciousness against the communal political divide.

===Bangladesh Liberation War===
Many of Bengali patriotic songs were regularly played on the [[Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra]], the clandestine radio station broadcast to revolutionaries and occupied population during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].&lt;ref name=start&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/beta2/news/1971-and-the-songs-we-sang/|title=1971 and the songs we sang|accessdate=2013-12-13|date=2012-12-01|author=Syed Badrul Ahsan|publisher=The Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of these patriotic songs, such as  “Jonmo Amar Dhonno Holo Maa-go” and “Bangla Moder Bangla Maa Amra Tomar Koti Shontan” have significant representations of “Mother Bengal”. She was an icon of freedom and [[democracy]] against all forms of dictatorship. These patriotic songs are still immensely popular in [[Bangladesh]] and [[West Bengal]] .

:When did you come out of the heart of Bangladesh,
:O, Mother dear, with such inexplicable splendor!
:It’s impossible to take away eyes from you!
:The doors of your golden temple have unlocked.
:Your right hand holds the blazing sword, the left one takes away fear,
:Smile of affection on the eyes, the third eye glaring.
:O Mother dear, how uniquely you reveal yourself!
:The cloud of your untied hair conceals thunders
:Ends of your sunlight coloured robes flutter in the horizon!
:It’s impossible to take away eyes from you!
:The doors of your golden temple have unlocked.
:When impassionately did not look up seemed
:Poor mother stayed back home , desolate, destitute.
:Your torn clothes vanish now, meager smile disappear.
:Beams of light scatter from your feet into entire sky
:O Mother, your appearance astounds me.
:You flood the world with the flow of happiness on the distressed nights
:O the mindblower, your word of fearlessness drum the heart
:It’s impossible to take away eyes from you!
:The doors of your golden temple have unlocked.

This is most probably only picturesque details of Mother Bengal.

[[File:Blind men and elephant.jpg|thumb|Blind men and elephant]]
The [[parable]] of the '''blind men and an elephant''' originated in the ancient [[Indian subcontinent]], from where it has been widely diffused. However the meaning of the popular [[proverb]] differs in other countries. It is a story of a group of blind men, who have never come across an [[elephant]] before and who learn and conceptualize what the elephant is like by touching it. Each blind man feels a different part of the elephant's body, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then describe the elephant based on their limited experience and their descriptions of the elephant are different from each other. In some versions, they come to suspect that the other person is dishonest and they come to blows. The moral of the parable is that humans have a tendency to claim absolute truth based on their limited, subjective experience as they ignore other people's limited, subjective experiences which may be equally true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=E. Bruce Goldstein|title=Encyclopedia of Perception|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6M3NSNm6MlkC&amp;pg=PA492|year=2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4129-4081-8|page=492}}, '''Quote:''' The ancient Hindu parable of the six blind men and the elephant...."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="snyder12"/&gt;

The first version of the story itself is traceable to the Buddhist text ''Udana 6.4'', dated to about mid 1st millennium BCE. According to John Ireland, the parable is likely older than the Buddhist text.&lt;ref name="Ireland2007p9"&gt;{{cite book|author=John D. Ireland|title=Udana and the Itivuttaka: Two Classics from the Pali Canon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kIllG8k-OmIC |year=2007|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society|isbn=978-955-24-0164-0|pages=9, 81–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternate version of the parable describes normal men, experiencing a large statue on a dark night, or feeling a large object while being blindfolded. They then describe what it is they have experienced. In its various versions, it is a parable that has crossed between many religious traditions and is part of [[Buddhist]], [[Hindu]] and [[Jainism|Jain]] texts of 1st millennium CE or before.&lt;ref name="Griffiths2007p46"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul J. Griffiths|title=An Apology for Apologetics: A Study in the Logic of Interreligious Dialogue|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7jRKAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46|year=2007|publisher=Wipf and Stock|isbn=978-1-55635-731-2|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ireland2007p9"/&gt; The story also appears in 2nd millennium [[Sufi]] and [[Baha'i Faith|Bahá’í]] lore. The tale later became well known in Europe, with 19th century American poet [[John Godfrey Saxe]] creating [[s:The Blind Men and the Elephant|his own version]] as a poem, with a final verse that explains that the elephant is a metaphor for God, and the various blind men represent religions that disagree on something no one has fully experienced.&lt;ref name="Gardner1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Gardner|title=Famous Poems from Bygone Days|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lTRorcYPLH0C&amp;pg=PA124|accessdate=2012-08-25|date=1 September 1995|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-28623-5|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story has been published in many books for adults and children, and interpreted in a variety of ways.

==The parable==
{{anchor|The story}}
The earliest versions of the parable of blind men and elephant is found in Buddhist, Hindu and Jain texts, as they discuss the limits of perception and the importance of complete context. The parable has several Indian variations, but broadly goes as follows:&lt;ref name=goldstein492&gt;{{cite book|author=E. Bruce Goldstein|title=Encyclopedia of Perception|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6M3NSNm6MlkC&amp;pg=PA492|year=2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4129-4081-8|page=492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=snyder12&gt;{{cite book|author1=C.R. Snyder|author2=Carol E. Ford|title=Coping with Negative Life Events: Clinical and Social Psychological Perspectives|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Bo7gBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12|year= 2013|publisher=Springer Science |isbn=978-1-4757-9865-4|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|A group of blind men heard that a strange animal, called an elephant, had been brought to the town, but none of them were aware of its shape and form. Out of curiosity, they said: "We must inspect and know it by touch, of which we are capable". So, they sought it out, and when they found it they groped about it. In the case of the first person, whose hand landed on the trunk, said "This being is like a thick snake". For another one whose hand reached its ear, it seemed like a kind of fan. As for another person, whose hand was upon its leg, said, the elephant is a pillar like a tree-trunk. The blind man who placed his hand upon its side said, "elephant is a wall". Another who felt its tail, described it as a rope. The last felt its tusk, stating the elephant is that which is hard, smooth and like a spear.}}

[[File:Illustrated proverb- Blind men and an elephant.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The blind men and the elephant &lt;br /&gt; (wall relief in Northeast Thailand)]]
In some versions, the blind men then discover their disagreements, suspect the others to be not telling the truth and come to blows. The stories also differ primarily in how the elephant's body parts are described, how violent the conflict becomes and how (or if) the conflict among the men and their perspectives is resolved. In some versions, they stop talking, start listening and collaborate to "see" the full elephant. In another, a sighted man enters the parable and describes the entire elephant from various perspectives, the blind men then learn that they were all partially correct and partially wrong. While one's subjective experience is true, it may not be the totality of truth.&lt;ref name="Ireland2007p9"/&gt;&lt;ref name=goldstein492/&gt;

The parable has been used to illustrate a range of truths and [[fallacies]]; broadly, the parable implies that one's subjective experience can be true, but that such experience is inherently limited by its failure to account for other truths or a totality of truth. At various times the parable has provided insight into the relativism, opaqueness or inexpressible nature of truth, the behavior of experts in fields of contradicting theories, the need for deeper understanding, and respect for different perspectives on the same object of observation.

==Hinduism==
The ''Rigveda'', dated to have been composed between 1500 and 1200 BCE, states "Reality is one, though wise men speak of it variously." According to Paul J. Griffiths, this premise is the foundation of universalist perspective behind the parable of the blind men and an elephant. The hymn asserts that the same reality is subject to interpretations and described in various ways by the wise.&lt;ref name="Griffiths2007p46"/&gt; In the oldest version, four blind men walk into a forest where they meet an elephant. In this version, they do not fight with each other, but conclude that they each must have perceived a different beast although they experienced the same elephant.&lt;ref name="Griffiths2007p46"/&gt; The expanded version of the parable occurs in various ancient and Hindu texts. Many scholars refer to it as a Hindu parable.&lt;ref name=goldstein492/&gt;&lt;ref name=snyder12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[a] {{cite book|author=Chad Meister|title=Philosophy of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1egYDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11 |year=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-31475-8|pages=11–12}};&lt;br&gt;[b] {{cite book|author1=Jeremy P.

The parable or references appear in ''[[bhasya]]'' (commentaries, secondary literature) in the Hindu traditions. For example, [[Adi Shankara]] mentions it in his ''bhasya'' on verse 5.18.1 of the ''[[Chandogya Upanishad]]'' as follows:

{{Quote|

==Jainism==
[[File:Medieval Jain temple Anekantavada doctrine artwork.jpg|thumb|left|Seven blind men and an elephant parable at a Jain temple]]
The medieval era Jain texts explain the concepts of ''[[anekāntavāda]]'' (or "many-sidedness") and ''[[Anekantavada#Sy.C4.81dv.C4.81da|syādvāda]]'' ("conditioned viewpoints") with the [[parable]] of the blind men and an elephant (''Andhgajanyāyah''), which addresses the manifold nature of truth. For example, this parable are found in ''Tattvarthaslokavatika'' of [[Vidyananda (8th-century Jain monk)|Vidyanandi]] (9th century) and ''Syādvādamanjari'' of Ācārya Mallisena (13th century). Mallisena uses the parable to argue that immature people deny various aspects of truth; deluded by the aspects they ''do'' understand, they deny the aspects they ''don't'' understand. "Due to extreme delusion produced on account of a partial viewpoint, the immature deny one aspect and try to establish another. This is the maxim of the blind (men) and the elephant."&lt;ref&gt;Mallisena, ''Syādvādamanjari'', 14:103–104. Dhruva, A.B. (1933) pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Mallisena also cites the parable when noting the importance of considering all viewpoints in obtaining a full  picture of reality. "It is impossible to properly understand an entity consisting of infinite properties without the method of modal description consisting of all viewpoints, since it will otherwise lead to a situation of seizing mere sprouts (i.e., a superficial, inadequate cognition), on the maxim of the blind (men) and the elephant."&lt;ref&gt;Mallisena, ''Syādvādamanjari'',  19:75–77. Dhruva, A.B. (1933) pp. 23–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
[[File:Blind monks examining an elephant.jpg|right|thumb|380px|''Blind monks examining an elephant'', an [[ukiyo-e]] print by [[Hanabusa Itchō]] (1652–1724).]]
[[Gautama Buddha|The Buddha]] twice uses the simile of blind men led astray. The earliest known version occurs in the text ''[[Udana]] 6.4''.&lt;ref name="Ireland2007p9"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gomez | first=Luis O. | title=Proto-Madhyamika in the Pali Canon | journal=Philosophy East and West | publisher=Univ of Hawaii Press | volume=26 | issue=2 | year=1976 | doi=10.2307/1398186 | page=164 note 73; 137–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Canki Sutta'' he describes a row of blind men holding on to each other as an example of those who follow an old text that has passed down from generation to generation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.095x.than.html Accesstoinsight.org]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628152156/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.095x.than.html |date=2006-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Udana]] (68–69)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.katinkahesselink.net/tibet/blind-men-elephant.html Katinkahesselink.net]&lt;/ref&gt; he uses the elephant parable to describe sectarian quarrels. A king has the blind men of the capital brought to the palace, where an elephant is brought in and they are asked to describe it.

&lt;blockquote&gt;When the blind men had each felt a part of the elephant, the king went to each of them and said to each: 'Well, blind man, have you seen the elephant? Tell me, what sort of thing is an elephant?'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The men assert the elephant is either like a pot (the blind man who felt the elephant's head), a [[winnowing|winnowing basket]] (ear), a [[plowshare]] (tusk), a [[plow]] (trunk), a [[granary]] (body), a [[Column|pillar]] (foot), a [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] (back), a [[pestle]] (tail) or a brush (tip of the tail).

The men cannot agree with one another and come to blows over the question of what it is like and their dispute delights the king. The Buddha ends the story by comparing the blind men to preachers and scholars who are blind and ignorant and hold to their own views: "Just so are these preachers and scholars holding various views blind and unseeing.... In their ignorance they are by nature quarrelsome, wrangling, and disputatious, each maintaining reality is thus and thus." The Buddha then speaks the following verse:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;O how they cling and wrangle, some who claim
For preacher and monk the honored name!
For, quarreling, each to his view they cling.
Such folk see only one side of a thing.&lt;ref name=Buddhist&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rywang/berkeley/258/parable.html |title=The Blind Men and the Elephant |first =Randy |last=Wang |accessdate=2006-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

==Sufism==
[[File:Blind men and elephant4.jpg|thumb|Blind men and the elephant.]]
The [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Sufi]] [[poet]] [[Sanai]] of [[Ghazni]] (currently, [[Afghanistan]]) presented this [[teaching story]] in his ''The Walled Garden of Truth''.&lt;ref&gt;Included in [[Idries Shah]], ''[[Tales of the Dervishes]]'' {{ISBN|0-900860-47-2}} [[Octagon Press]] 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rumi]], the 13th Century Persian poet and teacher of Sufism, included it in his [[Masnavi]]. In his retelling, "The Elephant in the Dark", some Hindus bring an elephant to be exhibited in a dark room. A number of men touch and feel the elephant in the dark and, depending upon where they touch it, they believe the elephant to be like a water spout (trunk), a fan (ear), a pillar (leg) and a throne (back). Rumi uses this story as an example of the limits of individual perception:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The sensual eye is just like the palm of the hand. The palm has not the means of covering the whole of the beast.&lt;ref name="Rumi"&gt;{{cite web |title=71 – The Elephant in the dark, on the reconciliation of contrarieties |url=http://www.khamush.com/tales_from_masnavi.htm#The%20Elephant |work=Rumi – Tales from Masnavi |date=2004-05-09 |first=A.J. |last= Arberry |accessdate=2006-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rumi does not present a resolution to the conflict in his version, but states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The eye of the Sea is one thing and the foam another. Let the foam go, and gaze with the eye of the Sea. Day and night foam-flecks are flung from the sea: oh amazing! You behold the foam but not the Sea. We are like boats dashing together; our eyes are darkened, yet we are in clear water.&lt;ref name="Rumi" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rumi ends his poem by stating "If each had a candle and they went in together the differences would disappear." &lt;ref&gt;For an adaptation of Rumi's poem, see this song version by David Wilcox [http://davidwilcox.com/index.php?page=songs&amp;display=1998&amp;category=Out_Beyond_Ideas here] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009233459/http://davidwilcox.com/index.php?page=songs&amp;display=1998&amp;category=Out_Beyond_Ideas |date=October 9, 2010 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==John Godfrey Saxe==
One of the most famous versions of the 19th century was the poem "[[s:The Blind Men and the Elephant|The Blind Men and the Elephant]]" by [[John Godfrey Saxe]] (1816–1887).
[[File:Blind men and elephant3.jpg|right|thumb|350px|
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;And so these men of Indostan&lt;ul&gt;Disputed loud and long,&lt;/ul&gt;Each in his own opinion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;Exceeding stiff and strong,&lt;/ul&gt;Though each was partly in the right&lt;ul&gt;And all were in the wrong!&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}]]
The poem begins:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;It was six men of Indostan
    To learning much inclined,
Who went to see the Elephant
    (Though all of them were blind),
That each by observation
    Might satisfy his mind&lt;ref name=Saxe&gt;{{cite wikisource|plaintitle=The poems of John Godfrey Saxe|chapter=The Blind Men and the Elephant|last=Saxe|first=John Godfrey|authorlink=John Godfrey Saxe|wspage=260|scan=Page:The poems of John Godfrey Saxe.djvu/279}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Each in his own opinion concludes that the elephant is like a wall, snake, spear, tree, fan or rope, depending upon where they had touched. Their heated debate comes short of physical violence, but the conflict is never resolved.
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
    '''Moral:'''
So oft in theologic wars,
    The disputants, I ween,
Rail on in utter ignorance
    Of what each other mean,
And prate about an Elephant
    Not one of them has seen!&lt;/poem&gt;}}

[[Natalie Merchant]] sang this poem in full on her [[Leave Your Sleep]] album (Disc 1, track 13).

== The meaning as proverb by country or domain ==
=== Japan ===
In Japan, the proverb is used as a simile of circumstance that ordinary men often fail to understand a great man or his great work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=日本国語大辞典|last=|first=|work=小学館国語辞典編集部|publisher=小学館|year=2001-04-20|isbn=4-09-521004-4|edition=2|volume=4 きかく～けんう|location=Tokyo|pages=1188|language=ja|chapter=群盲象を評す}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern treatments==
The story is seen as a [[metaphor]] in many disciplines, being pressed into service as an [[analogy]] in fields well beyond the traditional. In [[physics]], it has been seen as an analogy for the [[wave–particle duality]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9DWim3RhymsC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=wave+particle+duality+elephant+blind+men&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6G_1s_oA6v&amp;sig=UaEauX5CaISP-azpgp0NXQCRwU0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YYaOS7WbOKf20gSH8-zmDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CA0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=wave%20particle%20duality%20elephant%20blind%20men&amp;f=false ''Quantum theory''] by David Bohm, p. 26. Retrieved 2010-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[biology]], the way the blind men hold onto different parts of the elephant has been seen as a good analogy for the [[Polyclonal B cell response]].&lt;ref&gt;See for instance ''The lymph node in HIV pathogenesis'' by Michael M. Lederman and Leonid Margolis, ''Seminars in Immunology'', Volume 20, Issue 3, June 2008, pp. 187–195.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Blind men and elephant.png|thumb|"Blind men and elephant", &lt;small&gt;from Martha Adelaide Holton &amp; Charles Madison Curry, ''Holton-Curry readers''&lt;/small&gt;, 1914.]]The fable is one of a number of tales that cast light on the response of hearers or readers to the story itself. [[Idries Shah]] has commented on this element of [[self-reference]] in the many interpretations of the story, and its function as a [[teaching stories|teaching story]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...people address themselves to this story in one or more [...] interpretations. They then accept or reject them. Now they can feel happy; they have arrived at an opinion about the matter. According to their conditioning they produce the answer. Now look at their answers. Some will say that this is a fascinating and touching allegory of the presence of God. Others will say that it is showing people how stupid mankind can be. Some say it is anti-scholastic. Others that it is just a tale copied by Rumi from Sanai – and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idriesshah.info/Shah/ShahTeaStor.htm |title=The Teaching Story: Observations on the Folklore of Our "Modern" Thought |first=Idries |last=Shah |accessdate=2010-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shah adapted the tale in his book ''[[The Dermis Probe]]''. This version begins with a conference of scientists, from different fields of expertise, presenting their conflicting conclusions on the material upon which a camera is focused. As the camera slowly zooms out it gradually becomes clear that the material under examination is the hide of an African elephant. The words 'The Parts Are Greater Than The Whole' then appear on the screen. This retelling formed the script for a short four-minute film by the animator [[Richard Williams (animator)|Richard Williams]]. The film was chosen as an Outstanding Film of the Year and was exhibited at the London and New York film festivals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.octagonpress.com/titles/books/depr.htm Octagon Press page for The Dermis Probe] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726115510/http://www.octagonpress.com/titles/books/depr.htm |date=July 26, 2011 }}, with preview of story&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockethouse.co.uk/Elephant/|title=touching the elephant|publisher=The Rockethouse|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story enjoys a continuing appeal, as shown by the number of illustrated children's books of the fable; there is one for instance by [[Paul Galdone]] and another, ''Seven Blind Mice'', by [[Ed Young (illustrator)|Ed Young]] (1992).

In the title cartoon of one of his books, cartoonist [[Sam Gross]] postulated that one of the blind men, encountering a pile of the elephant feces, concluded that "An elephant is soft and mushy."

An [[elephant joke]] inverts the story in the following way:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Six blind elephants were discussing what men were like. After arguing they decided to find one and determine what it was like by direct experience. The first blind elephant felt the man and declared, 'Men are flat.' After the other blind elephants felt the man, they agreed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5235">'''Blondell Wayne Tatum''', a.k.a. '''Chemo''', is a fictional character who has appeared in two novels by [[Carl Hiaasen]], ''[[Skin Tight (novel)|Skin Tight]]'' ([[1989 in literature|1989]]) and ''[[Star Island (novel)|Star Island]]'' ([[2010 in literature|2010]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wolff|first=Carlo|title=Celebrity culture gets skewered in ‘Star Island’|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2010/07/29/carl_hiaasen_skewers_celebrity_culture_in_star_island/|accessdate=11 August 2010|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal history==
Tatum was born in [[North Dakota]].  His parents belonged to a religious sect that believed in [[polygamy]], [[vegetarianism]], and [[Tax resistance|refusing to pay income taxes]]. Tatum was orphaned at age six when his parents were killed in a shootout with [[FBI]] agents in a post office outside [[Grand Forks, North Dakota|Grand Forks]].  He went to live with his aunt and uncle, who were fugitives from [[felony]] [[mail fraud]] charges in [[New Jersey]], masquerading as [[Amish]] wheat farmers in rural [[Pennsylvania]].  Blondell first turned to crime when he was sixteen ([[bank robbery|holding up a bank]] with a [[pitchfork]]), eventually becoming a corrupt, though popular, city official in a small Pennsylvania town.

His life took a drastic turn due to a freak accident during an [[electrology|electrolysis]] procedure to remove two ingrown hair follicles from the tip of his nose. While Tatum was unconscious, the doctor suffered a [[stroke]] and mistakenly applied the needle to his entire face.  After Tatum woke up, he killed the doctor and fled the city, trying to find a cure for his facial condition. One wrongly-prescribed medication produced a lasting effect which "looked as if someone had glued [[Rice Krispies]] to every square centimeter of his face" and led to his nickname, "Chemo" (since many people wrongly assumed he was undergoing [[chemotherapy]]). 

In [[Bal Harbour, Florida]], he approaches Dr. Rudy Graveline, a [[plastic surgeon]] who offers him a discount on [[dermabrasion]] treatments in exchange for Chemo killing Mick Stranahan, a former State Investigator who is causing Rudy worry.

During his first, failed attempt, Chemo drowns Stranahan's vengeful ex-wife, Chloe, with an anchor, after she points out the house she thinks is his.  During his second, Chemo dives off the balcony of Stranahan's [[stilt house]] in [[Biscayne Bay]], and his hand is bitten off by a strike from Stranahan's pet [[Great Barracuda]].&lt;ref name="wiemer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wiemer|first=Robert|title=Mysteries: Why Are Those Guys Following Me?|newspaper=[[Newsday]]|date=5 November 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of a conventional prosthesis, he chooses to attach a portable [[String trimmer|weed whacker]].&lt;ref name="justice"&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Dover|first=J. Kenneth|title=Isn't justice always unfair?: the detective in southern literature|year=1996|publisher=Popular Press|isbn=978-0-87972-723-9|pages=345|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4jrTkiGLmnsC&amp;pg=PA345|author2=John F. Jebb|accessdate=12 August 2010|chapter=Miami Detectives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The whole affair spirals out of control, though Chemo is able to steal an amount of cash from Graveline that allows him to undergo a complete facial dermabrasion from a competent plastic surgeon.  Although this treatment succeeds in removing the "Rice Krispies" effect, his surgeon advises him that he will still have to regrow the outer layer of his facial skin.

Eventually, Chemo is caught in a confrontation between Graveline and Stranahan out on the stilt house, where he kills Graveline out of fear (or mortification) that Graveline is about to confess the terms of the "deal" that he and Graveline had for killing Stranahan.  Chemo is later arrested, and sentenced to four concurrent seventeen-year life sentences at [[Union Correctional Institution|Raiford]].

In 2010, he is back in Florida, having been paroled after 17 years, and enjoyed a lucrative spell of employment as a [[mortgage loan]] broker.  After the [[subprime mortgage crisis|subprime mortgage bubble]] bursts, he is back to doing security, sometimes as a bodyguard for visiting celebrities.  He carves out a small specialty for himself as a [[life coach]] for those with self-destructive addictions, since he has no awe whatsoever of fame, is immune to seduction, and not at all averse to beating his charges to pulp if they misbehave themselves.  After pop star "Cherry Pye's" latest drug-and-alcohol escapade, her record promoter recruits Chemo to be her latest bodyguard, over the objections of her family.

==Appearance==
Aside from his facial condition (which never completely recovers after the electrolysis mishap) and the weed trimmer attached to his arm, Chemo's appearance is also frightening because of his pallid, almost-reptilian complexion, the sparse hair on his scalp, and the fact that he stands 6'9" tall.&lt;ref name="wiemer"/&gt;

[[Image:Brainwashing2.JPG|thumb|Cover of ''Brain-Washing'', as published by the [[Church of Scientology]] in 1955.]]
'''''Brain-Washing: A Synthesis of the Russian Textbook on Psychopolitics''''', sometimes referred to as '''''The Brainwashing Manual''''', is a book published in 1955. It purports to be a condensation of the work of [[Lavrentiy Beria]], the [[NKVD|Soviet secret police]] chief. The book states [[Kenneth Goff]] as author. Its true authorship is not clear, the three common hypotheses being: Scientology's founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]], Kenneth Goff (alias Oliver Kenneth Goff), or both L. Ron Hubbard and Kenneth Goff based on an acquired US agency report.&lt;ref name=Introvigne2005&gt;Introvigne 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The third hypothesis is questionable as there is not proof that the two men ever knew each other. Claims that L. Ron Hubbard was the author are also dubious as the only source of this claim is his estranged son, L Ron Hubbard Jr.&lt;ref name="madman" /&gt;

It is also sometimes referred to as '''''The Communist Manual of Psycho-Political Warfare''''' or the '''''Communist Manual of Instructions of Psychopolitical Warfare'''''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xenu-directory.net/practices/brainwashing2.html Brainwashing Manual - Timeline].. Specifically see [http://www.lermanet.com/exit/manney/1963_Ability_148_pg8-9.jpg Ability magazine 1963, volume 148, page 9], and a Letter to the Editor from a Van Nuys, CA newspaper, by Jackson Adams, entitled [http://www.xenu-directory.net/news/images/19580223-us-valleynews.pdf Psycho-Analysis and Mental Health Propaganda] Feb 23 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

==L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology==
It says that it is a transcript of a speech on the use of [[psychiatry]] as a means of social control, given by [[Lavrenty Beria]] in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1950. However [[L. Ron Hubbard Jr.]], estranged son of Scientology founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]], stated: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Dad wrote every word of it. Barbara Bryan and my wife typed the manuscript off his dictation."&lt;ref name=madman&gt;''[http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/mom/Messiah_or_Madman.txt L. Ron Hubbard: Messiah or Madman?]'' by Bent Corydon and L. Ron Hubbard, Jr.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Although Hubbard Jr.'s broad criticisms against his father were later discredited Hubbard's former editor, John Sanborn, confirmed Hubbard Jr.'s testimony.&lt;ref name=Introvigne2005/&gt;

The Hubbard Association of Scientologists International published the booklet in an emergency basis in 1955. Hubbard tried to present the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] with a copy, but the Bureau expressed skepticism about the document's authenticity.&lt;ref name=barefaced&gt;''Bare-Faced Messiah'' by Russell Miller.&lt;/ref&gt; CIA operative Edward Hunter called the book a hoax, while the evaluator at the Operations Coordinating Board of President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s National Security Council thought the writer of the booklet seemed to have a superior expertise on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Did L.

Modern versions of the book, make no mention of these so-called "Hubbardisms" thus refuting whether they in fact did appear in the original texts and thus the so-called authorship of Hubbard in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pdf-archive.com/2014/06/02/the-soviet-art-of-brainwashing/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.everythingthatmattersradio.com/brainwashing2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, the Australian Board of Inquiry regarded the book as written by Hubbard, something that neither Hubbard nor the Church of Scientology's HASI [[Hubbard Association of Scientologists International]] refuted at the time.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

According to [[Massimo Introvigne]], critics of Scientology attribute the Brainwashing manual to Hubbard because of the claim that it was later used to practice actual brainwashing in the church. However, “Hubbard’s works denounced brainwashing as something that should not be practiced, both on moral grounds and because brainwashing represented the triumph of everything Scientology found reprehensible and harmful in modern psychiatry.” Critics say that the proof is that Hubbard said in a 1956 Dianetics and Scientology bulletin: “We can brainwash faster than the Russians.” Introvigne purports that it was not an endorsement of brainwashing. The same bulletin also told Scientology auditors to “avoid these techniques typical of psychiatry.”

There are two different meanings of brainwashing confused by critics of Scientology, says Introvigne. The first is drug-related, using psychotropic medication, violence and hypnosis, the second is “religious indoctrination,” which is generally used to attack not just the Church of Scientology but also other religions. The first is what Hubbard refers to as “pain-drug hypnosis,” which he declared ineffective and something to be “opposed and denounced” as a psychiatric practice.

Hubbard expressed on December 1955 that there was no political significance attached to the booklet. “We couldn’t be less interested, but brainwashing happens to be a facet of the human mind and it has been necessary to make available to our own people any and all texts which exist on the subject.” He emphasized his interest was purely professional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Did L.

;The Anderson Report
The final results of the [[Anderson Report]] in 1965 declared:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Board is not concerned to find that the scientology techniques are brainwashing techniques as practised, so it is understood, in some communist-controlled countries. Scientology techniques are, nevertheless, a kind of brainwashing... The astonishing feature of Scientology is that its techniques and propagation resemble very closely those set out in a book entitled ''Brain-washing'', advertised and sold by the HASI." &lt;ref name=anderson&gt;''[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/audit/ar12.html Report of the Board of Enquiry into Scientology]'', by Kevin Victor Anderson, Q.C., Published 1965 by the State of Victoria, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Kenneth Goff and the American far right==
[[Morris Kominsky]] in his ''The Hoaxers: Plain Liars, Fancy Liars and Damned Liars'' (1970) attributes the authorship to a Rev. [[Kenneth Goff]] (alias Oliver Kenneth Goff) of [[Englewood, Colorado]], an assistant of [[Gerald L. K. Smith]].  The entirety of chapter twelve is devoted to analysis of the text and the author's correspondence with others to determine the authenticity of the text or points within it, and other publications which make reference to it.  All current copies of the book including Kominsky's copy have a preface by Goff, but he does not give the publication date. The introduction begins:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"From May 2, 1936, to October 10, 1939, I was a dues-paying member of the Communist Party, operating under my own name, Kenneth Goff, and also the alias John Keats. In 1939, I voluntarily appeared before the Un-American Activities Committee in Washington, D.C., which was chairmanned at that time by Martin Dies, and my testimony can be found in Volume 9 of that year's Congressional Report.

During the period that I was a member of the Communist Party, I attended their school which was located at 113 E. Wells St., Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and operated under the name Eugene Debs Labor School. Here we were trained in all phases of warfare, both psychological and physical, for the destruction of the Capitalistic society and Christian civilization. In one portion of our studies we went thoroughly into the matter of psychopolitics. This was the art of capturing the minds of a nation through brainwashing and fake mental health -- the subjecting of whole nations of people to the rule of the Kremlin by capturing their minds. We were taught that the degradation of the populace is less inhuman than their destruction by bombs, for to an animal lives only once, any life is sweeter than death. The end of a war is the control of a conquered people. If a people can be conquered in the absence of war, the end of war will have been achieved without the destructions of war."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kominsky owned another copy published by the "Ultra-Rightist women of the [[Burbank, California]] area who call themselves the [[American Public Relations Forum]], Inc."  That copy included an introduction by [[Charles Stickley]] and with additional items by [[Usher L. Burdick]], claiming a publication date of 1955.  Goff asserted Stickley plagiarized him, and that he had seen yet another publication which had done so. Nonetheless, the Goff version also makes no mention of so-called "Hubbardisms", which further disproves the alleged authorship by L. Ron Hubbard.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9319350-the-soviet-art-of-brainwashing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fhu.com/articles/brainwashing1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Brian's a Bad Father'''" is the eleventh episode of the [[Family Guy (season 12)|twelfth season]] of the [[animated cartoon|animated]] [[television comedy|comedy series]] ''[[Family Guy]]'' and the 221st episode overall. It aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States and Canada on January 26, 2014, and is directed by [[Jerry Langford]] and written by [[Chris Sheridan (writer)|Chris Sheridan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/family-guy-2014/episode-11-season-12/brians-a-bad-father/100148 |title=Family Guy Episode Guide 2014 Season 12 - Brian's a Bad Father, Episode 11 |publisher=TVGuide.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episode, Brian's human son, Dylan, returns, now a teen TV star. Rather than being a good father to his estranged son, Brian uses his son's television connections to further his own writing career. Meanwhile, after Peter shoots Quagmire on a hunting trip, the two friends clash and Joe must choose a side.

==Plot==
Brian's overlooked and neglected teenage son [[The Former Life of Brian|Dylan]] returns to Quahog. While Dylan tries to reconnect with his father, Brian tries to distance himself and ignore him. However, when he learns that Dylan is a now a cast member in a new [[Disney Channel]] television series, he — under the ruse of bonding — uses Dylan's connections to secure a job on the series' writing staff to further his career prospects. However, rather than work under age-appropriate guidelines, Brian tries to adapt the writing to include more mature content; because the material does not fit the network, Brian is fired by a producer. Furthermore, a disillusioned Dylan realizes that Brian is not interested in bonding but is merely using him for his own selfish ambitions, and tells him that he never wants to see him again. When Stewie sees Brian getting drunk out of depression, Brian realizes how selfish he has been and how he never realized that he had the chance to have Dylan back into his life again, but he pushed it aside. Stewie decides to help him apologize to Dylan. On the first try Brian gets beaten up after trying to sneak past security. However, right when they are about to leave, Stewie sees a casting line and successfully tries out for Dylan's show under one of his aliases. While recording, Stewie breaks character and explains to Dylan that Brian wants to apologize to him and become a true father to him. Dylan meets up at the local park with Brian and the two forgive each other.

Meanwhile, Peter, Quagmire and Joe go on a [[hunting]] trip. During a lunch break, Peter shoots Quagmire in his arm. When the three friends meet back at the bar, Quagmire tells Peter he is fed up with his shortsighted and reckless behavior, and ends their friendship. This causes a rift between the two and leads towards a contest for Joe's affection. In the end, Joe decides that Quagmire has helped him more through hard times and gets along better with the family and chooses Quagmire. Peter tries to bond with Kevin only to leave stating that Kevin is "masturbating with a knife". With no more friends and even his own shadow abandoning him for Quagmire, Peter decides to commit [[suicide]], which Lois talks him out of and persuades him to try and reconcile with Quagmire. Later on, Peter offers Quagmire the opportunity to shoot him to break even, thinking Quagmire would decline and consider the "thought" as being what counts. However, when Quagmire actually agrees, the two wrestle for the gun until Joe shoots Peter in an attempt to break even and stop the dispute. Peter (angry he was shot by Joe) and Quagmire (upset he was not the one who shot Peter) are dissatisfied. While Peter argues how everyone will settle their differences, Quagmire shoots Peter in the head making the score even. While Brian and Dylan are reconciling, Lois pushes a brain-damaged Peter in a wheelchair where Peter is explaining he is happy that he, Quagmire and Joe are friends again.

==Reception==
Eric Thurm of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode a C–, saying "When so much of the episode is based on moving Brian from one end of the parenting spectrum to the other, that story has to be compelling, especially without that many jokes. But because it’s hard to buy Brian at the beginning, it’s difficult to watch this episode or take it that seriously (or as seriously as you’d ever take an episode of ''Family Guy'')."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/brians-a-bad-father-107283 |title=Family Guy: "Brian's A Bad Father"|publisher=Avclub.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode received a 2.0 rating in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic and was watched by a total of 4.11 million people. This made it the most watched show on [[Animation Domination]] that night, beating ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[Bob's Burgers]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/01/28/sunday-final-ratings-60-minutes-the-bachelor-sean-and-catherines-wedding-adjusted-down-final-pro-bowl-grammy-awards-ratings/232506/ |title=Sunday Final Ratings: ’60 Minutes’ &amp; ‘The Bachelor: Sean and Catherine’s Wedding’ Adjusted Down + Final Pro Bowl &amp; Grammy Awards Ratings |publisher=Tvbythenumbers |date=2014-01-29 |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Including DVR viewing, the episode was watched by 5.83 million viewers, and received an 18-49 rating of 3.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/02/10/live7-dvr-ratings-modern-family-has-biggest-18-49-ratings-gain-the-blacklist-tops-percentage-total-viewer-increase-in-week-18/235893/|title=Live+7 DVR Ratings: 'Modern Family' Has Biggest 18-49 Ratings Gain, 'The Blacklist' Tops Percentage &amp; Total Viewer Increase in Week 18|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Kondolojy|first=Amanda|date=February 10, 2014|accessdate=February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8028">The '''Cyrenaic and Carthaginian coins of Corvo''' are a hoard of [[Carthaginian coins|coins]] dating to approximately 200 BCE that were supposedly left in the [[Azores]] by [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] and discovered in 1749 on the [[Corvo Island|island of Corvo]], the smallest and most remote island of the Azores.

==Podolyn's report==
The only source of information about the find is a report published in 1778 in ''Det Götheborgska Wetenskaps och Witterhets Samhallets Handlinger'', now known as the Publications of the [[Royal Society of Sciences and Letters in Gothenburg]], by [[Johan Frans Podolyn]], a Portuguese-born [[Sweden|Swede]].&lt;ref&gt;Duane Roller, ''Through the Pillars of Herakles: Greco-Roman Exploration of the Atlantic'', New York/London: Routledge, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0415486965}}, pp. 49&amp;ndash;50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bikai&gt;Patricia M. and Pierre M.

Challenger During the Years 1872-76'', New York: Arno, 1977, {{ISBN|0-405-10411-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kxJvRib3-ggC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=Johan+Podolyn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mrHhTIzlJY_QccH34JcM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Johan%20Podolyn&amp;f=false p. 2, note 3], Flores had selected them as the best preserved.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion==
The coins depicted in Podolyn's report appeared genuine when compared with designs on coins in the possession of the Prince Royal of Denmark,&lt;ref name=Babcock/&gt; and the influential German historian [[Alexander von Humboldt]] fully embraced the account as proof of Carthaginian voyages to the New World.&lt;ref&gt;Babcock, note 7: [[Alexander von Humboldt|Alexandre de Humboldt]], ''Examen critique de l'histoire de la géographie du nouveau continent et des progrès de l'astronomie nautique aux quinzième et seizième siècles'', 5 volumes, Paris: Gide, 1836-39, volume 2, pp. 237-40. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century this was repeated as true in [[Chateaubriand]]'s ''Autobiography'', in [[Daniel Wilson (academic)|Daniel Wilson]]'s ''The Lost Atlantis'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Wilson (academic)|Daniel Wilson]], ''The Lost Atlantis, and Other Ethnographic Studies'', Edinburgh: Douglas, 1892, OCLC 6519876, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7AUaAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Daniel+Wilson,+The+Lost+Atlantis+and+Other+Ethnographic+Studies&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=saIZGfhZXj&amp;sig=vXfV13zWlTIFHxvwwGnMy183KjA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8tHmTKnlBYS3ceGMgckK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Corvo&amp;f=false pp. 9, 36].&lt;/ref&gt; and in encyclopedias including the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;List from John Murray, also in his "The Discovery of America by Columbus: The Influences which led up to that Great Event, and its Effect on the Development of Oceanographical Knowledge,"  ''Scottish Geographical Magazine'' 9 (1893) 561-585, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6rgBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA567&amp;dq=Chateaubriand,+Autobiography,+Corvo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=F9TmTMjQB87QcYTY6coK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Chateaubriand%2C%20Autobiography%2C%20Corvo&amp;f=false p. 567, note 3]; however, in both he has the wrong title for Wilson's book.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936 [[Anton Wilhelm Brøgger (archaeologist)|A. W. Brøgger]] used it as an example in his speech opening the second International Congress of Archaeologists, in which he argued that the [[Bronze Age]] was an era of long-distance exploration.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anton Wilhelm Brøgger]], [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00291953608551539#preview "Opdagelsenes nye Århundre"], ''Norsk Geografisk Tiddskrift'' 6 (1936) 171&amp;ndash;203 {{no icon}}, cited in Geoffrey Bibby, ''The Testimony of the Spade'', New York: Knopf, 1956, {{OCLC|282894}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;262&amp;ndash;63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all scholars since have accepted Podolyn's statement about the location of the find: the Azores were apparently unknown to ancient geographers and archeological surveys have not uncovered any evidence of European visitations prior to the modern age of exploration. Some have suggested that the coins were a hoax or placed there in a later period, "by Arabs, Normans, Spaniards, or early Portuguese settlers."&lt;ref name=Bikai/&gt; Patricia and Pierre Bikai suggest that the coins were actually from a town in [[Portugal]] named Corvo, where it is plausible that tin ore attracted Carthaginian settlement. They add that if the Carthaginians did cross the Atlantic the lack of a native population meant that there would not necessarily be any evidence, and "scholars who reject even the possibility of Atlantic voyages in antiquity seem" to be accepting a myth promulgated by the [[Phoenicians]] that the Atlantic was inherently impassable with the seafaring technology of the period.&lt;ref name=Bikai/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13435">{{1r|date=October 2015}}The '''Chicago Police Department''', also known as the '''CPD''', is the principal [[Police|law enforcement]] [[Law enforcement agency|agency]] of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], in the [[United States]].

* In the 1948 film ''[[Call Northside 777]]'', [[James Stewart]] played the role of a skeptical newspaper reporter, who initially did not believe the story from a cleaning woman that her son, young Frank Wiechek was innocent in the case of murdering a Chicago policeman.  The film is based on the true story of a 1932 crime.
* In [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s 1959 ''[[North by Northwest]]'', the Chicago Police arrest the protagonist, Roger Thornhill, only to later have to release him.
* The 1957–1960 television series ''[[M Squad]]'' centered on a squad of Chicago Police detectives.  The episode "The Jumper" featured an officer taking bribes.  It was reportedly this depiction that prompted then-Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]] to thereafter discourage motion picture and television location filming in the city for the rest of his administration and its aftermath.  [[John Landis]]' highly successful 1980 musical comedy motion picture ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' (see more below), marked the reversal of that policy by Mayor [[Jane Byrne]].
* The 1964 [[Rat Pack]] musical, ''[[Robin and the 7 Hoods]]'', depicts the laying of the laying of the cornerstone of the new Chicago Police headquarters in the 1930s. In the film, the corpse of the [fictional] [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] [[Cook County Sheriff's Office|Sheriff]] had been disposed of by his killers by secretly entombing him within the cornerstone.
* Two notable exceptions to Daley's ban were made in for films released in 1975.  In ''[[Brannigan (film)|Brannigan]]'', [[John Wayne]] portrays Chicago Police Lieutenant Jim Brannigan.  Although the bulk of the motion picture was set and filmed in [[London]], the opening credit sequence and first few scenes were filmed on location in Chicago and showed Chicago Police vehicles, officers and facilities.  This was despite the depictions of Brannigan's warrantless entry and illegally abusive interrogation techniques.
* 1975's ''[[Cooley High]]'' (set in 1964) was filmed entirely in Chicago and features a car chase through [[Navy Pier]]'s then-extant warehouse buildings, in which the pursuing Chicago police are repeatedly outmaneuvered by the joyriding teens, who thus escape.
* The Chicago Police Department and [[Illinois State Police]] are featured in the climactic car chase in 1980's ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' in which a Chicago Police dispatcher matter-of-factly advises responding officers that, "The use of unnecessary violence in the apprehension of the Blues brothers has been approved."  Reportedly in response to their portrayal in ''The Blues Brothers'', the Chicago Police Department banned the use of the "Chicago Police" name and insignia in films until the early 2000s, resulting in several films and television shows replacing "Chicago Police" with "Metro Police" and other faux names, even if the films received technical assistance from the department, such as ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'' and ''[[The Negotiator (film)|The Negotiator]]''.
* The television series ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'' (1981–1987) never explicitly stated the name of the city in which it was set, although many exterior views (lacking the principal actors) were filmed in the city and used for establishing and transition shots.  The livery and markings of the police cars were nearly identical to Chicago's at the time, although they used the false "Metro Police" text on the doors and the United States flag on the quarter pannels vice "Chicago Police" and the Chicago flag, respectively.  The cars were equipped with red bar lights, presumably to distinguish them from actual Chicago police cars that are equipped with blue lights.  The exterior establishing shots of the precinct house, including the main title card's view of a police car exiting the building's garage, were filmed at the old [[7th District Police Station|Maxwell Street]] police station. ''See the [[Hill Street Blues|main article]] for expanded discussion on the setting.''
* Chicago Police detectives; portrayed by Gerald Castillo, [[Dick Anthony Williams]], and Rick Cluchey; hunt a serial killer in the 1983 [[Pam Dawber]] / [[David Soul]] [[telefilm]], ''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088265/ Through Naked Eyes]''.
* A Chicago Police officer was a regular character on the 1984–1985 series, ''[[E/R]]''. Recorded entirely on-stage in Los Angeles, ''E/R''’s dressers and actor [[Bruce A. Young]] (who was also one of the writers of the original stage production in Chicago) were unaffected by the department's ban on the use of "Chicago Police" insignia. Young wore a standard-issue shoulder-sleeve patch, Sillitoe Tartan cap band, and other accurate insignia as Off. [[Fred Burdock]].
* Many of the same off-duty and retired Chicago Police officers (among other common Chicago-based actors) were cast as police officers in both 1985's ''[[Code of Silence (film)|Code of Silence]]'' starring [[Chuck Norris]] as detective Eddie Cusack, and 1988's ''[[Above the Law (film)|Above the Law]]'' starring [[Steven Seagal]] as Detective Nico Toscani. Among those was Sgt. [[Joseph Kosala]], who subsequently appeared as a Chicago police officer in ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'' (see below), as well as in ''[[Chain Reaction (1996 film)|Chain Reaction]]'' and on an episode of ''[[Early Edition]]''.
* Former real-life Chicago Police officer, [[Dennis Farina]], who had appeared as Detective Dorado in ''Code of Silence'' and as an unnamed uniformed officer in ''Through Naked Eyes'', portrayed Chicago Police Lieutenant Mike Torello in the 1986–1988 television series, ''[[Crime Story (TV series)|Crime Story]]''.  Set in the early 1960s, most of the first season depicts Chicago until Torello and his team are seconded to the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]] to pursue Chicago-raised gangsters in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].
* [[Gregory Hines]] and [[Billy Crystal]] portray Chicago Police detectives in the 1986 film ''[[Running Scared (1986 film)|Running Scared]]''.
* In the 1987 film ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'', set in Prohibition-era Chicago, [[Eliot Ness]], played by [[Kevin Costner]], recruits a veteran Chicago Police officer ([[Sean Connery]]) and a sharpshooting police trainee ([[Andy Garcia]]).
* [[James Belushi]] portrayed Det. Sgt. Art Ridzik, a CPD detective, in the 1988 action film ''[[Red Heat (1988 film)|Red Heat]]''.
* [[Robert De Niro]] portrays a former Chicago police officer turned bounty hunter in the 1988 film ''[[Midnight Run]]''. Numerous references are made to the CPD as well as corruption within the department. There are also a number of scenes directly involving the CPD.
* [[John Candy]] and James Belushi portrayed Officers Danny Muldoon and Salvatore Buonarte, respectively, in the 1991 comedy ''[[Only the Lonely (film)|Only the Lonely]]''.
* The patriarch of the television series ''[[Family Matters (TV series)|Family Matters]]'' (1989–1998), portrayed by [[Reginald VelJohnson]], was a Chicago Police officer, achieving the rank of Captain.
* In the 1991–1993 series, ''[[Reasonable Doubts]]'', [[Mark Harmon]] portrayed Chicago Police Det. Dicky Cobb, detailed to the office of the Cook County State's Attorney (referred to as "district attorney" in the series).
* [[Robert De Niro]] and [[David Caruso]] portray CPD detectives in the 1993 film ''[[Mad Dog and Glory]]''.
* The Chicago Police Department played a major role in 1993's ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'', showing them in a semi-brutal fashion after [[Harrison Ford]]'s character is incorrectly believed to have killed an on-duty police officer. The use of actual Chicago Police Department vehicles and uniforms is extensive and can be see throughout the film.
* The television series ''[[Due South]]'' (1994–1999) followed the adventures of [[Benton Fraser]], a member of [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] who is partnered with [[Ray Vecchio]], a detective of the Chicago Police Department.
* The Chicago Police Department are used, and play a major role, in both the manga and three episode Anime OVA [[Gunsmith Cats]]. The character Roy Coleman is a detective with the Chicago Police Department who serves as Rally and May's main contact with the force.  Several scenes in the manga, as well as the first part of the third episode of the OVA "High Speed Edge" take place at the Police Department's headquarters.  The Police Department is also credited with the assistance of production of the OVA along with the Cook County Sheriff's Department.
* In the 1998 film ''[[The Negotiator (film)|The Negotiator]]'', the Chicago Police played a major role within the film. The real Chicago Police Department provided technical support for the movie's SWAT teams.  The actors' shoulder sleeve insignia were similar to the Chicago Police Department's octagonal patches, albeit with "Chicago" replaced with "Metropolitan".
* The Chicago Police Department is used in 2000 film ''[[The Watcher (film)|The Watcher]]'', starring [[Keanu Reeves]] as a serial killer and [[James Spader]] as a retired FBI agent.
* The Chicago Police Department is used in 2001's ''[[Angel Eyes (film)|Angel Eyes]]'' wherein a Chicago cop, played by [[Jennifer Lopez]], had struggles with someone whom she saved from a fire and her mother and father renewing their vows. Her partner was portrayed by [[Terrence Howard]].
* The Chicago Police Department was used in the 2002 film, ''[[John Q]]'', during the climatic hostage situation.
* In the movie, ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'', Detective Spooner works for a future version of the Chicago Police Department.
* In the 2006 ''[[South Park]]'' episode ''[[A Million Little Fibers]]'', an officer of the Chicago Police was gunned down by [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s [[vagina]]. This appearance was notable only because the uniform of the police officers and the livery of the police cars were fairly accurate to those of the department.
* CPD officers and vehicles were represented in "[[The Things About Heroes (CSI: NY episode)|The Things About Heroes]]" episode of ''[[CSI: NY]]'' which originally aired on November 28, 2007.
* Chicago police officers are routinely depicted on the television series, ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]''.
* In [[Jim Butcher]]’s [[contemporary fantasy]] series of novels [[The Dresden Files]], the CPD's Lieutenant [[Karrin Murphy]] becomes a friend and ally of wizard [[Harry Dresden]].  She is demoted to sergeant after the events of ''Proven Guilty''.  In [[The Dresden Files (TV series)]], [[Valerie Cruz]] played Lieutenant Connie Murphy.
* In the 2008 movie ''[[Eagle Eye]]'', Chicago Police Officers and police cars were used during the first chase scene.
* Members of Chicago Police Department served as extras with the cast members on ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' as members of Gotham PD officers.  Some of the officers performed ''Balmoral'' during the shooting of the funeral of Commissioner [[Gillian B. Loeb]] &lt;ref&gt;''The Dark Knight'' End Credits&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 2010 situation comedy, ''[[Mike &amp; Molly]]'' stars [[Billy Gardell]] as Officer Mike Biggs, and co-stars [[Reno Wilson]] as his partner, Officer Carl McMillan. Their uniforms closely match their real-world counterparts, albeit with the "Chicago - Police" wording on the octagonal shoulder sleeve insignia replaced by "Police - Department" and the omission of a lower (assignment) portion on their name tags.
* The Chicago police are portrayed in the 2011 [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]] series ''[[The Chicago Code]]''.  Unlike most depictions of Chicago police, the actors' uniforms and insignia appear to be identical to their real-world counterparts, despite the series being filmed on-location in the city.
* The 2011 [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] drama series, ''[[Against the Wall (TV series)|Against the Wall]]'' stars [[Rachael Carpani]] as Detective Abby Kowalski, a member of the CPD's [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] division.
* In 2013, Indian Bollywood movie [[Dhoom 3]] was set in Chicago, and featured the Chicago Police Department.
* The ''[[Terra Nova (TV series)|Terra Nova]]'' character Jim Shannon said he was a [[detective]] with the department's [[narcotics]] squad.
* The ''[[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0]]'' character [[List of Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series) characters#Lou Grover|Lou Grover]] is a Chicago native, as is the actor who portrays him [[Chi McBride]]. Grover was a former SWAT officer in the CPD before he relocated to Hawaii and joins the [[Honolulu Police Department]].
* ''[[Chicago P.D. (TV series)|Chicago P.D.]]'' is the second of the [[Chicago (franchise)|''Chicago'' trilogy]] of television series portraying the fire, police and emergency medical services in the city of Chicago. All three shows are filmed on location. Off-duty CPD officers serve as extras and technical consultants on ''Chicago P.D.''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2820">'''Christian Latin literature''' has a long history with its foundations being laid during the 4th and 5th centuries. They included the church fathers [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Jerome]], and [[Ambrose]], and the first great Christian poet, [[Prudentius]].

==History==
The earliest language of the Christian Church was [[koine Greek]], which was the language of the Eastern Roman empire in the 1st century AD.  However, as Christianity spread through other parts of the Roman empire where Latin was used, a growing body of Latin literature was produced. Until the end of the 3rd century, the main genre was [[apologetic]]s (justifications of Christianity), by writers such as [[Minucius Felix]], [[Tertullian]], [[Arnobius]], and [[Lactantius]].  [[St Jerome]] translated the Bible into Latin in the 4th century, producing an edition known as the [[Vulgate]].  This led to the increased use of Latin by the Church Fathers of the 4th century, including Ambrose, and St [[Augustine of Hippo]].  Much of what they wrote was concerned with the theological controversies of the time, such as [[Arianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Latin Literature in Early Christianity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Middle Ages, Latin was still the main language for literature in Western Europe.  Plays written in Latin were often part of medieval Easter celebrations, and there were other forms of drama in Latin.  Latin was also used for religious lyric poetry and epic verse such as [[Walafrid Strabo]]'s 9th-century "De visionibus Wettini" (a predecessor of [[Dante]]'s vernacular ''[[Divine Comedy]]''), while [[Jesuit]]s such as [[Jakob Masen]] (author of ''Sarcotis'', a probable influence on Milton's ''[[Paradise Lost]]'') also produced Latin epic verse as late as the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Latin Literature in Christianity (Sixth to Twentieth Century)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesuit poet [[Diego José Abad y García|Diego José Abad]] wrote the didactic, humanist religious poem ''De Deo heroica carmina'' (1769-1780), which was begun in Mexico and finished in Italy. It is written in Latin hexameter, in a strong style. It is divided into two parts, a Summa theologica and a life of Christ.

==Notable writers==
* [[Ambrose]] (Aurelius Ambrosius), archbishop of Milan and theologian
* [[Augustine of Hippo]], author of ''Confessions'' and theology
* [[St Jerome]], translator of the Bible into Latin
* [[Jacob Masen]], German author of poetry, drama, history, and theology
* [[Prudentius]], poet
* [[Walafrid Strabo]], Frankish writer of poetry, theology, and history
* [[Tertullian]], author of theological works

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3310">A '''creative work''' is a manifestation of [[creativity|creative]] effort including [[Work of art|fine artwork]] ([[sculpture]], [[painting]]s, [[drawing]], [[Sketch (drawing)|sketching]], [[performance art]]),  dance, writing ([[literature]]), [[filmmaking]], and [[music|musical composition]].

Creative works require a creative mindset and are not typically rendered in an arbitrary fashion although some works demonstrate [have in common] a degree of arbitrariness, such that it is improbable that two people would independently create the same work. At its base, creative work involves two main steps—having an idea, and then turning that idea into a substantive form or process.  The creative process can involve one or more individuals.  Based upon technological advances as well as artificial intelligence there is the possibility that creative works can be created without human intervention - thereby removing the step of "having an idea".  Typically the creative process has some aesthetic value which is identified as a creative expression which itself generally invokes an external stimuli which a person views as creative.
The term is frequently used in the context of [[copyright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stanford|first1=Law Library|title=Copyright &amp; Fair Use|url=http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/faqs/copyright-basics/|website=Fair Use|publisher=Stanford Libraries|accessdate=April 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
For the purpose of section 221(2)(c) of the [[Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005]], the expression "creative works" means: 
{{quote|(a) literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works, or &lt;br/&gt;(b) designs,&lt;br/&gt;created by the taxpayer personally or, if the qualifying trade, profession or vocation is carried on in partnership, by one or more of the partners personally.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/5/section/221 section 221(3)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Superwork ==
A '''superwork''' is a creative work that contains multiple creative works all derived from the same originating work.&lt;ref&gt;{{#invoke:Wikidata|getValueFromID|Q24261928|P50|FETCH_WIKIDATA}}, ''{{#invoke:Wikidata|getValueFromID|Q24261928|P1476|FETCH_WIKIDATA}}'' ([https://books.google.fr/books?id=r0iBW7fygu8C&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true extract])&lt;/ref&gt;
For instance, the superwork from [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s fairy tale ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' could comprise the original text, [[The Little Mermaid (statue)|the Little Mermaid statue]], ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989 film), commentaries, etc.

In the context of [[Semantic Web]] the superwork was standardized as "[http://schema.org/CreativeWork CreativeWork] container", so it is a ''CreativeWork'' with many [http://schema.org/hasPart hasPart] relations with other ''CreativeWork''.
Examples, as container/part list:  [http://schema.org/CreativeWorkSeries CreativeWorkSeries]/[http://schema.org/episode episode], [http://schema.org/WebSite WebSite]/[http://schema.org/WebPage WebPage], [http://schema.org/PublicationIssue PublicationIssue]/[http://schema.org/Article Article].

'''Dark Canyon Wilderness''' is a [[National Wilderness Preservation System|designated Wilderness Area]] in the heart of southeast [[Utah]]'s canyon country, part of the [[Bears Ears National Monument]]. The wilderness is named for its high steep walls that narrow in the lower section so that they block the light in the morning and late afternoon. The roughly horseshoe-shaped [[wilderness]] is made up of the upper part of {{convert|40|mi|0|adj=on}} long Dark Canyon and two major tributaries, Woodenshoe Canyon and Peavine Canyon in the [[Manti-La Sal National Forest]]. These canyons all descend from pine-covered Elk Ridge northeast of [[Natural Bridges National Monument]]. Dark Canyon continues west within a U.S. [[Bureau of Land Management]] primitive area that is recommended for wilderness designation. The last four miles of the main canyon drop steeply through [[Glen Canyon National Recreation Area]] into [[Lake Powell]].

On December 28, 2016 President [[Barack Obama]] proclaimed the 1.35 million acre [[Bears Ears National Monument]], that includes both the Dark Canyon Wilderness and the adjacent Dark Canyon Primitive Area.

Life zones range from [[ponderosa pine]] and [[aspen]]-covered high country to desert vegetation in the bottom of Dark Canyon. High terraced castle-like [[sandstone]] walls tower {{convert|3000|ft|sigfig=2}} above the canyon floors. Wildlife species include [[mule deer]], some [[Cougar|mountain lions]], [[American black bear|black bear]] and [[bighorn sheep]]. This diverse canyon country contains [[natural arch|arches]], springs, seeps and hanging gardens.

Water sources in Dark Canyon are often widely separated, and some have dried up entirely in recent drought years. Thunderstorms can result in powerful [[flash flood]]s that scour the canyon streambeds.

Wilderness visitors may see evidence of the [[Ancient Pueblo Peoples|Ancestral Puebloan]] culture.

All the trails dropping into the canyons are moderate but they can be difficult, if not impossible, to find and follow until you reach the bottoms of the canyons. Peavine Canyon contains a cherry-stem jeep trail. The [[U.S. Forest Service|Forest Service]] once recommended closing the area to vehicles but this corridor was kept open as a compromise in the [[Utah Wilderness Act of 1984]].

For example, internal dysfunctions of the [[immune system]] can produce a variety of different diseases, including various forms of [[immunodeficiency]], [[hypersensitivity]], [[allergy|allergies]] and [[autoimmune disorders]].

In humans, ''disease'' is often used more broadly to refer to any condition that causes [[pain]], [[Abnormality (behavior)|dysfunction]], [[distress (medicine)|distress]], [[social problems]], or [[death]] to the person afflicted, or similar problems for those in contact with the person&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037| pmid=29301638|title = Rethinking the health consequences of social class and social mobility| journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine| volume=200| pages=258–61|year = 2018|last1 = Simandan|first1 = Dragos}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In this broader sense, it sometimes includes [[injury|injuries]], [[disability|disabilities]], [[Disease#disorder|disorders]], [[syndrome]]s, [[infection]]s, isolated [[symptom]]s, deviant [[behavior]]s, and atypical [[human variability|variations]] of structure and function, while in other contexts and for other purposes these may be considered distinguishable categories. Diseases can affect people not only physically, but also emotionally, as contracting and living with a disease can alter the affected person's perspective on life.

Death due to disease is called [[death by natural causes]]. There are four main types of disease: [[infectious disease]]s, deficiency diseases, hereditary diseases (including both [[Genetic disorder|genetic diseases]] and [[Non-Mendelian inheritance|non-genetic hereditary diseases]]), and physiological diseases. Diseases can also be classified in other ways, such as [[transmission (medicine)|communicable]] versus [[non-communicable disease|non-communicable]] diseases. The deadliest diseases in humans are [[coronary artery disease]] (blood flow obstruction), followed by [[cerebrovascular disease]] and [[lower respiratory infections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = What is the deadliest disease in the world? |url = http://www.who.int/features/qa/18/en/ |publisher = WHO |accessdate = 7 December 2014 |date = 16 May 2012 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141217112902/http://www.who.int/features/qa/18/en/ |archivedate = 17 December 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==

=== Concepts ===

In many cases, terms such as ''disease'', ''disorder'', ''morbidity'', ''sickness'' and ''illness'' are used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://science.education.nih.gov/supplements/nih5/mental/other/glossary.htm |title = Mental Illness—Glossary |publisher = US [[National Institute of Mental Health]] |accessdate = 18 April 2010 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100528085547/http://science.education.nih.gov/supplements/nih5/Mental/other/glossary.htm |archivedate = 28 May 2010 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are situations, however, when specific terms are considered preferable.

&lt;!-- This ";" and ":" formatting is called a "definition list".  See [[Help:List#List basics]] for more information.  Please do not change the formatting unless you know what you're doing.  --&gt;
;Disease
:The term ''disease'' broadly refers to any condition that impairs the normal functioning of the body. For this reason, diseases are associated with dysfunctioning of the body's normal [[homeostasis#Examples of some of the better understood physiological homeostats|homeostatic processes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://regentsprep.org/regents/biology/units/homeostasis/index.cfm |title = Regents Prep: Living Environment: Homeostasis |publisher = Oswego City School District Regents Exam Prep Center |accessdate = 12 November 2012 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121025044155/http://regentsprep.org/Regents/biology/units/homeostasis/index.cfm |archivedate = 25 October 2012 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Commonly, the term is used to refer specifically to [[infectious disease]]s, which are clinically evident diseases that result from the presence of [[pathogenic]] microbial agents, including viruses, [[bacteria]], fungi, protozoa, multicellular organisms, and aberrant proteins known as [[prion]]s.  An [[infection]] or [[colony (biology)|colonization]] that does not and will not produce clinically evident impairment of normal functioning, such as the presence of the normal [[gut flora|bacteria and yeasts in the gut]], or of a [[passenger virus]], is not considered a disease. By contrast, an infection that is asymptomatic during its [[incubation period]], but expected to produce symptoms later, is usually considered a disease.  [[Non-infectious disease]]s are all other diseases, including most forms of [[cancer]], [[heart disease]], and [[genetic disease]].
;Acquired disease
:An acquired disease is one that began at some point during one's lifetime, as opposed to disease that was already present at birth, which is [[congenital disorder|congenital disease]]. ''Acquired'' sounds like it could mean "caught via contagion", but it simply means acquired sometime after birth. It also sounds like it could imply secondary disease, but acquired disease can be primary disease.
;Acute disease
:An acute disease is one of a short-term nature ([[acute (medicine)|acute]]); the term sometimes also [[connotation|connotes]] a [[fulminant]] nature
;Chronic condition or chronic disease
:A [[chronic condition|chronic disease]] is one that persists over time, often characterized six months or more.
;Congenital disorder or congenital disease
: A [[congenital disorder]] is one that is present at [[birth]]. It is often a [[genetic disorder|genetic disease or disorder]] and can be [[heredity|inherited]]. It can also be the result of a [[vertically transmitted infection]] from the mother, such as [[HIV/AIDS]].
;Genetic disease
:A [[Genetic disorder|genetic disorder or disease]]  is caused by one or more genetic [[mutation]]s. It is often inherited, but some mutations are random and [[wikt:de novo|de novo]].
;Hereditary or inherited disease
:A hereditary disease is a type of genetic disease caused by genetic mutations that are [[heredity|hereditary]] (and can run in families)
;Iatrogenic disease
:An [[Iatrogenesis|iatrogenic disease]] or condition is one that caused by medical intervention, whether as a side effect of a treatment or as an inadvertent outcome.
;Idiopathic disease
:An [[idiopathic disease]] has an unknown cause or source. As medical science has advanced, many diseases with entirely unknown causes have had some aspects of their sources explained and therefore shed their idiopathic status. For example, when germs were discovered, it became known that they were a cause of infection, but particular germs and diseases had not been linked. In another example, it is known that [[autoimmunity]] is the cause of some forms of [[diabetes mellitus type 1]], even though the particular molecular pathways by which it works are not yet understood. It is also common to know certain factors are [[association (statistics)|associated]] with certain diseases. However, association and causality are two very different phenomena, as a third cause might be producing the disease, as well as an associated phenomenon.
;Incurable disease
:A disease that cannot be [[cure]]d. Incurable diseases are not necessarily [[terminal disease]]s, and sometimes a disease's symptoms can be treated sufficiently for the disease to have little or no impact on [[quality of life]].
;Primary disease
:A primary disease is a disease that is due to a [[root cause]] of illness, as opposed to secondary disease, which is a [[sequela]], or [[complication (medicine)|complication]] that is caused by the primary disease.  For example, a [[common cold]] is a primary disease, where [[rhinitis]] is a possible secondary disease, or [[sequela]]. A doctor must determine what primary disease, a cold or a bacterial infection, is causing a patient's secondary rhinitis when deciding whether or not to prescribe antibiotics.
;Secondary disease
:A secondary disease is a disease that is a [[sequela]] or [[complication (medicine)|complication]] of a prior, causal disease, which is referred to as the primary disease or simply the underlying cause ([[root cause]]). For example, a bacterial infection can be primary, wherein a healthy person is exposed to a bacteria and becomes infected, or it can be secondary to a primary cause, that predisposes the body to infection. For example, a primary [[viral infection]] that weakens the [[immune system]] could lead to a secondary bacterial infection. Similarly, a primary [[burn]] that creates an open wound could provide an entry point for bacteria, and lead to a secondary bacterial infection.
;Terminal disease
:A terminal disease is one that is expected to have the inevitable result of death. Previously, AIDS was a terminal disease; it is now incurable, but can be managed indefinitely using medications.
;Illness
:The terms Illness and sickness are both generally used as a synonym for disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/illness |title = illness |work = [[Dorland's Medical Dictionary]] for Health Consumers |year = 2007 |publisher = Elsevier |via = medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |access-date = 6 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|seven/000096725|sickness}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term ''illness'' is occasionally used to refer specifically to the patient's personal experience of his or her disease.&lt;ref name="pmid3567788"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Emson HE |title = Health, disease and illness: matters for definition |journal = [[CMAJ]] |volume = 136 |issue = 8 |pages = 811–13 |date = April 1987 |pmid = 3567788 |pmc = 1492114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid3567791"&gt;{{cite journal |author = McWhinney IR |title = Health and disease: problems of definition |journal = CMAJ |volume = 136 |issue = 8 |page = 815 |date = April 1987 |pmid = 3567791 |pmc = 1492121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this model, it is possible for a person to have a disease without being ill (to have an objectively definable, but [[asymptomatic]], medical condition, such as a [[subclinical infection]]), and to be ''ill'' without being ''diseased'' (such as when a person perceives a normal experience as a medical condition, or [[medicalization|medicalizes]] a non-disease situation in his or her life—for example, a person who feels unwell as a result of embarrassment, and who interprets those feelings as sickness rather than normal emotions). Symptoms of illness are often not directly the result of infection, but a collection of [[evolutionary medicine|evolved responses]]—[[sickness behavior]] by the body—that helps clear infection and promote recovery. Such aspects of illness can include [[lethargy]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[anorexia (symptom)|loss of appetite]], [[sleepiness]], [[hyperalgesia]], and inability to [[Attention|concentrate]].&lt;ref name="Hart"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Hart BL |year = 1988 |title = Biological basis of the behavior of sick animals |journal = [[Neurosci Biobehav Rev]] |volume = 12 |issue = 2 |pages = 123–37 |pmid = 3050629 |doi = 10.1016/S0149-7634(88)80004-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Johnson R |year = 2002 |title = The concept of sickness behavior: a brief chronological account of four key discoveries |journal = [[Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology]] |volume = 87 |issue = 3–4 |pages = 443–50 |pmid = 12072271 |doi = 10.1016/S0165-2427(02)00069-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Kelley KW, Bluthe RM, Dantzer R, Zhou JH, Shen WH, Johnson RW, Broussard SR |year = 2003 |title = Cytokine-induced sickness behavior |journal = [[Brain Behav Immun]] |volume = 17 |issue = Suppl 1 |pages = S112–18 |pmid = 12615196 |doi = 10.1016/S0889-1591(02)00077-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
;{{Visible anchor|Disorder}}
:A disorder is a functional abnormality or disturbance. Medical disorders can be categorized into [[mental disorder]]s, [[physical disorder]]s, [[genetic disorder]]s, [[emotional and behavioral disorders]], and [[functional disorder]]s.  The term ''disorder'' is often considered more value-neutral and less stigmatizing than the terms ''disease'' or ''illness'', and therefore is a preferred terminology in some circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Sefton |first1 = Phil |title = Condition, Disease, Disorder |url = https://blog.amamanualofstyle.com/2011/11/21/condition-disease-disorder/ |website = AMA Style Insider |publisher = American Medical Association |accessdate = 22 July 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160321144302/http://blog.amamanualofstyle.com/2011/11/21/condition-disease-disorder/ |archivedate = 21 March 2016 |df = dmy-all |date = 2011-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In mental health, the term ''mental disorder'' is used as a way of acknowledging the complex interaction of [[Biopsychosocial model|biological, social, and psychological factors]] in [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] conditions.  However, the term ''disorder'' is also used in many other areas of medicine, primarily to identify physical disorders that are not caused by infectious organisms, such as [[metabolic disorder]]s.
;Medical condition
:A '''medical condition''' is a broad term that includes all diseases, [[lesion]]s, disorders, or nonpathologic condition that normally receives medical treatment, such as [[pregnancy]] or [[childbirth]].  While the term ''medical condition'' generally includes mental illnesses, in some contexts the term is used specifically to denote any illness, injury, or disease except for mental illnesses. The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM), the widely used psychiatric manual that defines all [[mental disorder]]s, uses the term ''general medical condition'' to refer to all diseases, illnesses, and injuries except for [[mental disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher = American Psychiatric Association |year = 2000 |title = Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders |edition = 4th |location = Washington, DC |author = American Psychiatric Association Task Force on DSM-IV |isbn = 978-0-89042-025-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This usage is also commonly seen in the psychiatric literature. Some [[health insurance]] policies also define a ''medical condition'' as any illness, injury, or disease except for psychiatric illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.theinsurancepage.co.uk/expat-insurance-glossary.html |title = Expat Insurance Glossary by The Insurance Page |accessdate = 20 November 2008 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081027142342/http://www.theinsurancepage.co.uk/expat-insurance-glossary.html |archivedate = 27 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:As it is more [[value-neutral]] than terms like ''disease'', the term ''medical condition'' is sometimes preferred by people with health issues that they do not consider deleterious.  On the other hand, by emphasizing the medical nature of the condition, this term is sometimes rejected, such as by proponents of the [[autism rights movement]].
:The term ''medical condition'' is also a synonym for ''[[medical state]]'', in which case it describes an individual patient's current state from a medical standpoint.  This usage appears in statements that describe a patient as being ''in critical condition'', for example.
;{{Visible anchor|Morbidity}}
:'''Morbidity''' ({{ety|la|morbidus|sick, unhealthy}}) is a diseased state, [[disability]], or poor health due to any cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/morbidity |title = morbidity |work = Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers |year = 2007 |publisher = Elsevier |via = medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |access-date = 6 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term may be used to refer to the existence of any form of disease, or to the degree that the health condition affects the patient.  Among severely ill patients, the level of morbidity is often measured by [[ICU scoring systems]].  [[Comorbidity]] is the simultaneous presence of two or more medical conditions, such as [[schizophrenia]] and [[substance abuse]].
:In [[epidemiology]] and [[actuarial science]], the term "morbidity rate" can refer to either the [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] rate, or the [[prevalence]] of a disease or medical condition. This measure of sickness is contrasted with the [[mortality rate]] of a condition, which is the proportion of people dying during a given time interval. Morbidity rates are used in actuarial professions, such as health insurance, life insurance and long-term care insurance, to determine the correct premiums to charge to customers. Morbidity rates help insurers predict the likelihood that an insured will contract or develop any number of specified diseases.
;Pathosis or pathology
:''Pathosis'' (plural ''pathoses'') is synonymous with ''disease''. The word ''[[pathology]]'' also has this [[word sense|sense]], in which it is commonly used by physicians in the [[medical literature]], although [[wikt:pathology#Usage notes|some editors prefer to reserve ''pathology'' to its other senses]]. Sometimes a slight [[connotation|connotative]] shade causes preference for ''pathology'' or ''pathosis'' implying "some [as yet poorly analyzed] [[pathophysiology|pathophysiologic process]]" rather than ''disease'' implying "a specific disease entity as defined by diagnostic criteria being already met". This is hard to quantify [[denotation|denotatively]], but it explains why [[cognitive synonymy]] is not invariable.
;Syndrome
:A [[syndrome]] is the association of several [[medical sign]]s, [[symptom]]s, or other characteristics that often occur together.  Some syndromes, such as [[Down syndrome]], have only one cause.  Others, such as [[Parkinsonian syndrome]], have multiple possible causes. For example, [[acute coronary syndrome]] is not a single disease itself, but rather the manifestation of any of several diseases, such as [[myocardial infarction]] secondary to [[coronary artery disease]]. In yet other syndromes, the [[idiopathy|cause is unknown]].  A familiar syndrome name often remains in use even after an underlying cause has been found, or when there are a number of different possible primary causes. Examples of the first-mentioned type are that [[Turner syndrome]] and [[DiGeorge syndrome]] are still often called by the "syndrome" name despite that they can also be viewed as disease entities and not solely as sets of signs and symptoms.
;Predisease
:'''Predisease''' is a [[subclinical]] or [[prodrome|prodromal]] vanguard of a disease. [[Prediabetes]] and [[prehypertension]] are common examples. The [[nosology]] or epistemology of predisease is contentious, though, because there is seldom a [[bright line]] differentiating a legitimate concern for subclinical/prodromal/premonitory status (on one hand) and [[conflict of interest]]–driven [[disease mongering]] or [[medicalization]] (on the other hand). Identifying legitimate predisease can result in useful preventive measures, such as motivating the person to get a healthy amount of physical exercise,&lt;ref name="Lenzer"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2012/08/blood_pressure_drugs_for_mild_hypertension_not_proven_to_prevent_heart_attacks_strokes_or_early_death.single.html |title = Blood pressure drugs for mild hypertension: Not proven to prevent heart attacks, strokes, or early death |last = Lenzer |first = Jeanne |date = 14 August 2012 |work = [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |accessdate = 16 August 2012 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120815202802/http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2012/08/blood_pressure_drugs_for_mild_hypertension_not_proven_to_prevent_heart_attacks_strokes_or_early_death.single.html |archivedate = 15 August 2012 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but labeling a healthy person with an unfounded notion of predisease can result in [[overtreatment]], such as taking drugs that only help people with severe disease or paying for drug prescription instances whose [[benefit–cost ratio]] is minuscule (placing it in the waste category of [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|CMS]]' "waste, fraud, and abuse" classification). One review summarizes 3 requirements for legitimacy of instances of the concept: truly high risk for progression to disease, actionability for risk reduction, and benefit that outweighs harm in any interventions taken.&lt;ref name="pmid_21624963"&gt;{{Citation |last=Viera |first=Anthony J. |year=2011 |title=Predisease: when does it make sense? |work={{w|Epidemiologic Reviews}} |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=122–34 |pmid=21624963 |doi=10.1093/epirev/mxr002 |quote=When the goal of preventing adverse health outcomes is kept in mind, this review poses the idea that "predisease" as a category on which to act makes sense only if the following 3 conditions are met. First, the people designated as having predisease must be far more likely to develop disease than those not so designated. Second, there must be a feasible intervention that, when targeted to people with predisease, effectively reduces the likelihood of developing disease. Third, the benefits of intervening on predisease must outweigh the harms in the population.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types by body system ===

;Mental
:[[Mental disorder|Mental illness]] is a broad, generic label for a category of illnesses that may include affective or [[emotion]]al instability, behavioral dysregulation, cognitive dysfunction or impairment.  Specific illnesses known as mental illnesses include [[major depressive disorder|major depression]], generalized [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[schizophrenia]], and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], to name a few. Mental illness can be of biological (e.g., anatomical, chemical, or genetic) or psychological (e.g., trauma or conflict) origin. It can impair the affected person's ability to work or study and can harm interpersonal relationships.  The term [[insanity]] is used technically as a legal term.
;Organic
:An organic disease is one caused by a physical or physiological change to some tissue or organ of the body.  The term sometimes excludes infections.  It is commonly used in contrast with mental disorders.  It includes emotional and behavioral disorders if they are due to changes to the physical structures or functioning of the body, such as after a stroke or a traumatic brain injury, but not if they are due to [[psychosocial]] issues.

=== Stages ===
{{redirect|Flareup|the Transformers character|Flareup (Transformers)}}

In an infectious disease, the [[incubation period]] is the time between infection and the appearance of symptoms.  The [[latency period]] is the time between infection and the ability of the disease to spread to another person, which may precede, follow, or be simultaneous with the appearance of symptoms.  Some viruses also exhibit a dormant phase, called [[viral latency]], in which the virus hides in the body in an inactive state.  For example, [[varicella zoster virus]] causes [[chickenpox]] in the [[acute (medicine)|acute phase]]; after recovery from chickenpox, the virus may remain dormant in nerve cells for many years, and later cause [[herpes zoster]] (shingles).
;Acute disease
:An [[acute disease]] is a short-lived disease, like the [[common cold]].
;Chronic disease
:A [[chronic disease]] is one that lasts for a long time, usually at least six months.  During that time, it may be constantly present, or it may go into [[remission (medicine)|remission]] and periodically [[relapse]].  A chronic disease may be stable (does not get any worse) or it may be progressive (gets worse over time).  Some chronic diseases can be permanently cured.  Most chronic diseases can be beneficially treated, even if they cannot be permanently cured.
;Clinical disease
:One that has clinical consequences; in other words, the stage of the disease that produces the characteristic signs and symptoms of that disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/clinical+disease |title = clinical disease |via = medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |work = Mosby's Medical Dictionary |edition = 9th |year = 2009 |publisher = Elsevier |quote = a stage in the history of a pathological condition that begins with anatomical or physiological changes that are sufficient to produce recognizable signs and symptoms of a disease |access-date = 6 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[AIDS]] is the clinical disease stage of [[HIV infection]].
;Cure
:A [[cure]] is the end of a medical condition or a treatment that is very likely to end it, while [[Remission (medicine)|remission]] refers to the disappearance, possibly temporarily, of symptoms.  Complete remission is the best possible outcome for incurable diseases.
;Flare-up
:A flare-up can refer to either the recurrence of symptoms or an onset of more severe symptoms.
;Progressive disease
:[[Progressive disease]] is a disease whose typical natural course is the worsening of the disease until death, serious debility, or organ failure occurs.  Slowly progressive diseases are also [[chronic disease]]s; many are also [[degenerative disease]]s.  The opposite of progressive disease is ''stable disease'' or ''static disease'':  a medical condition that exists, but does not get better or worse.

:A refractory disease is a disease that resists treatment, especially an individual case that resists treatment more than is normal for the specific disease in question.
;Subclinical disease
:Also called '''silent disease''', '''silent stage''', or '''asymptomatic disease'''.  This is a stage in some diseases before the symptoms are first noted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/subclinical |title = subclinical |via = medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |date =  |access-date = 6 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Terminal phase
:If a person will die soon from a disease, regardless of whether that disease typically causes death, then the stage between the earlier disease process and active dying is the terminal phase.

=== Extent ===

;Localized disease
:A [[localized disease]] is one that affects only one part of the body, such as [[athlete's foot]] or an [[eye infection]].
;Disseminated disease
:A [[disseminated disease]] has spread to other parts; with cancer, this is usually called [[metastatic disease]].
;Systemic disease
:A [[systemic disease]] is a disease that affects the entire body, such as [[influenza]] or [[hypertension|high blood pressure]].

== Classifications ==
{{Main|nosology}}

Diseases may be classified by cause, [[pathogenesis]] ([[mechanism (biology)|mechanism]] by which the disease is caused), or by [[symptom]](s). Alternatively, diseases may be classified according to the [[organ system]] involved, though this is often complicated since many diseases affect more than one organ.

A chief difficulty in nosology is that diseases often cannot be defined and classified clearly, especially when cause or pathogenesis are unknown.  Thus diagnostic terms often only reflect a symptom or set of symptoms ([[syndrome]]).

Classical classification of human disease derives from observational correlation between pathological analysis and clinical syndromes. Today it is preferred to classify them by their cause if it is known.&lt;ref&gt;Loscalzo J1, Kohane I, Barabasi AL. Human disease classification in the postgenomic era: a complex systems approach to human pathobiology.
Mol Syst Biol. 2007;3:124. Epub 2007 Jul 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most known and used classification of diseases is the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|ICD]]. This is periodically updated. Currently the last publication is the [[ICD-10]].

== Causes ==
{{See also|Cause (medicine)|Transmission (medicine)}}

Only some diseases such as [[influenza]] are contagious and commonly believed infectious. The micro-organisms that cause these diseases are known as pathogens and include varieties of bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi. [[Infectious disease]]s can be transmitted, e.g. by hand-to-mouth contact with infectious material on surfaces, by bites of [[vector (epidemiology)|insects or other carriers]] of the disease, and from contaminated water or food (often via [[feces|fecal]] contamination), etc.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander van Geen, et al. "Impact of population and latrines on fecal contamination of ponds in rural Bangladesh." Science Of The Total Environment 409, no. 17 (August 2011): 3174–82.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, there are [[sexually transmitted disease]]s. In some cases, [[microorganism]]s that are not readily spread from person to person play a role, while other diseases can be prevented or ameliorated with appropriate [[nutrition]] or other lifestyle changes.

Some diseases, such as most (but [[Infectious cancer|not all]]) forms of [[cancer]], [[heart disease]], and mental disorders, are [[non-infectious disease]]s. Many non-infectious diseases have a partly or completely genetic basis (see [[genetic disorder]]) and may thus be transmitted from one generation to another.

[[Social determinants of health]] are the social conditions in which people live that determine their health. Illnesses are generally related to social, economic, political, and [[Environmental disease|environmental circumstances]]. Social determinants of health have been recognized by several health organizations such as the Public Health Agency of [[Canada]] and the World Health Organization to greatly influence collective and personal well-being. The World Health Organization's Social Determinants Council also recognizes [[Social determinants of health in poverty]].

When the cause of a disease is poorly understood, societies tend to mythologize the disease or use it as a [[metaphor]] or symbol of whatever that culture considers evil.  For example, until the bacterial cause of [[tuberculosis]] was discovered in 1882, experts variously ascribed the disease to [[hereditary disease|heredity]], a [[sedentary lifestyle]], [[depression (mood)|depressed mood]], and overindulgence in sex, rich food, or alcohol—all the [[social ills]] of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Olson, James Stuart |title = Bathsheba's breast: women, cancer &amp; history |publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press |location = Baltimore |year = 2002 |pages = 168–70 |isbn = 978-0-8018-6936-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a disease is caused by a pathogen (e.g., when the disease [[malaria]] is caused by infection by ''[[Plasmodium]]'' parasites.), the term ''disease'' may be misleadingly used even in the scientific literature in place of its causal agent, the pathogen. This language habit can cause confusion in the communication of the cause-effect principle in [[epidemiology]], and as such it should be strongly discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marcantonio|first1=Matteo|last2=Pascoe|first2=Emily|last3=Baldacchino|first3=Frederic|date=January 2017|title=Sometimes Scientists Get the Flu.

=== Types of causes ===
&lt;!-- This special list formatting is designed for definitions like these.  See [[Help:List]] before changing.  --&gt;
;Airborne: An [[airborne disease]] is any disease that is caused by pathogens and transmitted through the air.
;Foodborne: [[Foodborne illness]] or food poisoning is any illness resulting from the consumption of food contaminated with pathogenic bacteria, toxins, viruses, prions or parasites.
;Infectious:  [[Infectious disease]]s, also known as transmissible diseases or communicable diseases, comprise clinically evident illness (i.e., characteristic medical signs or symptoms of disease) resulting from the infection, presence and growth of pathogenic biological agents in an individual host organism. Included in this category are ''[[contagious disease]]s'' – an infection, such as [[influenza]] or the [[common cold]], that commonly spreads from one person to another – and ''[[communicable disease]]s'' – a disease that can spread from one person to another, but does not necessarily spread through everyday contact.
; Lifestyle: A [[lifestyle disease]] is any disease that appears to increase in frequency as countries become more industrialized and people live longer, especially if the risk factors include behavioral choices like a sedentary lifestyle or a diet high in unhealthful foods such as refined carbohydrates, trans fats, or alcoholic beverages.
; Non-communicable: A [[non-communicable disease]] is a medical condition or disease that is non-transmissible.  Non-communicable diseases cannot be spread directly from one person to another.  [[Heart disease]] and [[cancer]] are examples of non-communicable diseases in humans.

== Prevention ==
{{Main|Preventive medicine}}

Many diseases and disorders can be prevented through a variety of means.  These include [[sanitation]], proper [[nutrition]], adequate [[exercise]], [[vaccination]]s and other [[self-care]] and [[public health]] measures.

== Treatments ==
{{Main|Therapy}}

Medical [[therapy|therapies]] or treatments are efforts to cure or improve a disease or other health problem.  In the medical field, therapy is synonymous with the word ''treatment''.  Among psychologists, the term may refer specifically to [[psychotherapy]] or "talk therapy".  Common treatments include [[medication]]s, [[surgery]], [[medical devices]], and [[self-care]].  Treatments may be provided by an organized [[health care system]], or informally, by the patient or family members.

[[Preventive healthcare]] is a way to avoid an injury, sickness, or disease in the first place.  A treatment or cure is applied after a medical problem has already started.  A treatment attempts to improve or remove a problem, but treatments may not produce permanent cures, especially in [[chronic diseases]].  [[Cure]]s are a subset of treatments that reverse diseases completely or end medical problems permanently.  Many diseases that cannot be completely cured are still treatable. [[Pain management]] (also called pain medicine) is that branch of medicine employing an interdisciplinary approach to the relief of pain and improvement in the quality of life of those living with pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Chronic Pain Management: The Essentials |author1 = Hardy, Paul A. |author2 = Hardy, Paul A. J. |page = 10 |year = 1997 |publisher = Cambridge University Press |isbn = 978-1-900151-85-6 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EtZ-4eb_aDUC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10 |oclc = 36881282 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151003091442/https://books.google.com/books?id=EtZ-4eb_aDUC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10 |archivedate = 3 October 2015 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment for [[medical emergencies]] must be provided promptly, often through an [[emergency department]] or, in less critical situations, through an [[urgent care]] facility.

== Epidemiology ==
{{Main|Epidemiology}}

Epidemiology is the study of the factors that cause or encourage diseases.  Some diseases are more common in certain geographic areas, among people with certain genetic or socioeconomic characteristics, or at different times of the year.

Epidemiology is considered a cornerstone methodology of public health research, and is highly regarded in [[evidence-based medicine]] for identifying [[risk factor]]s for disease. In the study of communicable and non-communicable diseases, the work of epidemiologists ranges from [[outbreak]] investigation to study design, data collection and analysis including the development of statistical models to test hypotheses and the documentation of results for submission to peer-reviewed journals. Epidemiologists also study the interaction of diseases in a population, a condition known as a [[syndemic]]. Epidemiologists rely on a number of other scientific disciplines such as [[biology]] (to better understand disease processes), [[biostatistics]] (the current raw information available), [[Geographic Information Science]] (to store data and map disease patterns) and [[social science]] disciplines (to better understand proximate and distal risk factors).  Epidemiology can help identify causes as well as guide prevention efforts.

In studying diseases, epidemiology faces the challenge of defining them.  Especially for poorly understood diseases, different groups might use significantly different definitions.  Without an agreed-on definition, different researchers may report different numbers of cases and characteristics of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/08/health/research/08fatigue.html |title = Defining an illness is fodder for debate |author = Tuller, David |newspaper = The New York Times |date = 4 March 2011 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170103054656/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/08/health/research/08fatigue.html |archivedate = 3 January 2017 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some morbidity databases are compiled with data supplied by states and territories health authorities, at national levels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.aihw.gov.au/national-hospital-morbidity-database/ |title = National Hospital Morbidity Database |website = aihw.gov.au |publisher = [[Australian Institute of Health and Welfare]] |access-date = 11 July 2013 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130813000437/http://aihw.gov.au/national-hospital-morbidity-database/ |archivedate = 13 August 2013 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&amp;SDDS=3203&amp;Item_Id=1724 |title = Hospital Morbidity Database (HMDB) |date =  2007-10-24|work = statcan.gc.ca |publisher = Statistics Canada |accessdate = 21 September 2015 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160630153315/http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&amp;SDDS=3203&amp;Item_Id=1724 |archivedate = 30 June 2016 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; or larger scale (such as European Hospital Morbidity Database (HMDB))&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://data.euro.who.int/hmdb/ |title = European Hospital Morbidity Database |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130902224516/http://data.euro.who.int/hmdb/ |archivedate = 2 September 2013 |website = who.int |publisher = World Health Organization |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which may contain hospital discharge data by detailed diagnosis, age and sex. The European HMDB datea was submitted by European countries to the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe.

=== Burdens of disease ===

[[Disease burden]] is the impact of a health problem in an area measured by financial cost, mortality, morbidity, or other indicators.

There are several measures used to quantify the burden imposed by diseases on people.  The [[years of potential life lost]] (YPLL) is a simple estimate of the number of years that a person's life was shortened due to a disease.  For example, if a person dies at the age of 65 from a disease, and would probably have lived until age 80 without that disease, then that disease has caused a loss of 15 years of potential life.  YPLL measurements do not account for how disabled a person is before dying, so the measurement treats a person who dies suddenly and a person who died at the same age after decades of illness as equivalent.  In 2004, the [[World Health Organization]] calculated that 932 million years of potential life were lost to premature death.&lt;ref name=WHODALY /&gt;

The [[quality-adjusted life year]] (QALY) and [[disability-adjusted life year]] (DALY) metrics are similar, but take into account whether the person was healthy after diagnosis.  In addition to the number of years lost due to premature death, these measurements add part of the years lost to being sick.  Unlike YPLL, these measurements show the burden imposed on people who are very sick, but who live a normal lifespan.  A disease that has high morbidity, but low mortality, has a high DALY and a low YPLL.  In 2004, the World Health Organization calculated that 1.5 billion disability-adjusted life years were lost to disease and injury.&lt;ref name=WHODALY&gt;{{cite web |publisher = World Health Organization |website = who.int |url = http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html |title = Disease and injury regional estimates for 2004 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101224055121/http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_regional/en/index.html |archivedate = 24 December 2010 |df = }} Standard DALYs (3% discounting, age weights).

== Society and culture ==

[[File:Charles Mellin zugeschr - Porträt eines Herrn - Gemäldegalerie Berlin.jpg|thumb|right|[[Obesity]] was a status symbol in [[Renaissance]] culture: "The Tuscan General [[Alessandro del Borro]]", attributed to [[Andrea Sacchi]], 1645.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.cab.u-szeged.hu/cgfa/m/m-12.htm |first = Carol |last = Gerten-Jackson |title = The Tuscan General Alessandro del Borro |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090502012818/http://www.cab.u-szeged.hu/cgfa/m/m-12.htm |archivedate = 2 May 2009 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now generally regarded as a disease.]]

How a society responds to diseases is the subject of [[medical sociology]].

A condition may be considered a disease in some cultures or eras but not in others.  For example, [[obesity]] can represent wealth and abundance, and is a status symbol in famine-prone areas and some places hard-hit by [[AIDS wasting|HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name=HaslamJames&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Haslam DW, James WP |title = Obesity |journal = Lancet |volume = 366 |issue = 9492 |pages = 1197–209 |year = 2005 |pmid = 16198769 |doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67483-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Epilepsy]] is considered a sign of spiritual gifts among the [[Hmong people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Fadiman |first = Anne |title = The spirit catches you and you fall down: a Hmong child, her American doctors, and the collision of two cultures |publisher = Farrar, Straus, and Giroux |location = New York |year = 1997 |isbn = 978-0-374-52564-4 |oclc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sickness confers the social legitimization of certain benefits, such as illness benefits, work avoidance, and being looked after by others.  The person who is sick takes on a social role called the [[sick role]].  A person who responds to a dreaded disease, such as [[cancer survivor|cancer]], in a culturally acceptable fashion may be publicly and privately honored with higher [[social status]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Sulik, Gayle |title = Pink Ribbon Blues: How Breast Cancer Culture Undermines Women's Health |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = New York |year = 2010 |isbn = 978-0-19-974045-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In return for these benefits, the sick person is obligated to seek treatment and work to become well once more.  As a comparison, consider [[pregnancy]], which is not interpreted as a disease or sickness, even if the mother and baby may both benefit from medical care.

Most religions grant exceptions from religious duties to people who are sick. For example, one whose life would be endangered by  [[fasting]] on [[Yom Kippur]] or during [[Ramadan]] is exempted from the requirement, or even forbidden from participating.  People who are sick are also exempted from social duties.  For example, ill health is the only socially acceptable reason for an American to refuse an invitation to the [[White House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Martin, Judith |title = Miss Manners' Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior |publisher = W.W. Norton &amp; Co |location = New York |year = 2005 |page = 703 |isbn = 978-0-393-05874-1 |oclc = 57549405 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identification of a condition as a disease, rather than as simply a variation of human structure or function, can have significant social or economic implications. The controversial recognitions as diseases of [[repetitive stress injury]] (RSI) and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (also known as "[[Da Costa's syndrome|Soldier's heart]]", "[[shell shock]]", and "combat fatigue") has had a number of positive and negative effects on the financial and other responsibilities of governments, corporations and institutions towards individuals, as well as on the individuals themselves. The social implication of viewing [[senescence|aging]] as a disease could be profound, though this classification is not yet widespread.

[[Leprosy|Lepers]] were people who were historically shunned because they had an infectious disease, and the term "leper" still evokes [[social stigma]]. Fear of disease can still be a widespread social phenomenon, though not all diseases evoke extreme social stigma.

Social standing and economic status affect health.  [[Diseases of poverty]] are diseases that are associated with [[poverty]] and low social status; [[diseases of affluence]] are diseases that are associated with high social and economic status.  Which diseases are associated with which states varies according to time, place, and technology.  Some diseases, such as [[diabetes mellitus]], may be associated with both poverty (poor food choices) and affluence (long lifespans and sedentary lifestyles), through different mechanisms.  The term [[lifestyle disease]]s describes diseases associated with longevity and that are more common among older people.  For example, [[cancer]] is far more common in societies in which most members live until they reach the age of 80 than in societies in which most members die before they reach the age of 50.

=== Language of disease ===

An [[illness narrative]] is a way of organizing a medical experience into a coherent story that illustrates the sick individual's personal experience.

People use [[metaphor]]s to make sense of their experiences with disease.  The metaphors move disease from an objective thing that exists to an [[affective]] experience.  The most popular metaphors draw on [[military]] concepts:  Disease is an enemy that must be feared, fought, battled, and routed.  The patient or the healthcare provider is a warrior, rather than a passive victim or bystander. The agents of communicable diseases are invaders; non-communicable diseases constitute internal insurrection or civil war.  Because the threat is urgent, perhaps a matter of life and death, unthinkably radical, even oppressive, measures are society's and the patient's moral duty as they courageously mobilize to struggle against destruction.  The [[War on Cancer]] is an example of this metaphorical use of language.&lt;ref name=Gwyn&gt;{{cite book |author = Gwyn, Richard |editor1 = Cameron, Lynne |editor2 = Low, Graham |title = Researching and applying metaphor |publisher = Cambridge University Press |location = Cambridge, England |year = 1999 |chapter = 10 |isbn = 978-0-521-64964-3 |oclc = 40881885 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This language is empowering to some patients, but leaves others feeling like they are failures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |title = Fighting Words Are Rarer Among British Doctors |url = http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/22/fighting-words-are-rare-among-british-doctors |author = Span, Paula |date = 22 April 2014 |newspaper = The New York Times |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20140702025715/http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/22/fighting-words-are-rare-among-british-doctors |archivedate = 2 July 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another class of metaphors describes the experience of illness as a journey:  The person travels to or from a place of disease, and changes himself, discovers new information, or increases his experience along the way.  He may travel "on the road to recovery" or make changes to "get on the right track" or choose "pathways".&lt;ref name=Gwyn /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some are explicitly immigration-themed:  the patient has been exiled from the home territory of health to the land of the ill, changing identity and relationships in the process.&lt;ref name=Diedrich&gt;{{cite book |author = Diedrich, Lisa |title = Treatments: language, politics, and the culture of illness |publisher = University of Minnesota Press |location = Minneapolis |year = 2007 |pages = 8, 29 |isbn = 978-0-8166-4697-5 |oclc = 601862594 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This language is more common among British healthcare professionals than the language of physical aggression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some metaphors are disease-specific.  [[Slavery]] is a common metaphor for [[addiction]]s:  The alcoholic is enslaved by drink, and the smoker is captive to nicotine.  Some cancer patients treat the loss of their hair from [[chemotherapy]] as a [[metonymy]] or metaphor for all the losses caused by the disease.&lt;ref name=Gwyn /&gt;

Some diseases are used as metaphors for social ills:  "Cancer" is a common description for anything that is endemic and destructive in society, such as poverty, injustice, or racism.  AIDS was seen as a divine judgment for moral decadence, and only by purging itself from the "pollution" of the "invader" could society become healthy again.&lt;ref name=Gwyn /&gt;  More recently, when AIDS seemed less threatening, this type of emotive language was applied to [[Avian flu outbreak of 2009|avian flu]] and [[type 2 diabetes mellitus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Hanne M, Hawken SJ |title = Metaphors for illness in contemporary media |journal = Med Humanit |volume = 33 |issue = 2 |pages = 93–99 |date = December 2007 |pmid = 23674429 |doi = 10.1136/jmh.2006.000253 |url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Authors in the 19th century [[Tuberculosis in popular culture|commonly used tuberculosis]] as a symbol and a metaphor for [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]].  Victims of the disease were portrayed in literature as having risen above daily life to become ephemeral objects of spiritual or artistic achievement.  In the 20th century, after its cause was better understood, the same disease became the emblem of poverty, squalor, and other social problems.&lt;ref name=Diedrich /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6845">[[File:Egyptian_vulture_in_flight.jpg|thumb|right|[[Egyptian vulture|Egyptian Eagle]] in flight, 26 November 2007.]]
The Eagle of Saladin ({{lang-ar|نسر صلاح الدين}}), in [[Egypt]] known as the '[[Egyptian vulture|Egyptian Eagle]]' ({{lang-ar|النسر المصري}} {{lang|ar-Latn|el-nessr el-massry}})&lt;ref&gt;Whitney Smith: ''Flags Through the Ages and Across the World''. McGraw-Hill Book Company (UK) Ltd. Maidenhead, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;, also known as the ''Republican Eagle'' ({{lang|ar|النسر الجمهورى|rtl=yes}} {{lang|arz-Latn|el-nessr el-gumhūri}}), is a [[eagle (heraldry)|heraldic eagle]] used as a iconic symbol of [[Egypt]]. It is currently also used as part of [[coat of arms of Egypt]], [[Coat of arms of Iraq|Iraq]] and [[Coat of arms of Palestine|Palestine]].

==Origin of the term==
[[File:Eagle of Saladin Sketch from Cairo Citadel.png|thumb|right|200px|Sketch of the original "eagle of [[Saladin]]" of the [[Cairo Citadel]]; Cairo, [[Egypt]].]]
The Eagle was taken as a symbol of [[Cairo]] and [[Egypt]] when Saladin first ruled over the [[Egyptians]], it was inspired by the [[Egyptian vulture|Ancient Egyptian vulture]] drawn allover the walls of [[Egyptian temple|Egyptian temples]] as a symbol of pride and dignity. The association with [[Saladin]] is also due to the depiction of an [[Egyptian vulture]] on the west wall of the [[Cairo Citadel]] which was built during the rule of Saladin, although the current design of the eagle itself is of more recent date specifically after the [[Egyptian revolution of 1952]]. "The eagle in the Citadel of [[Cairo]] is of very uncertain date, probably considerably later than the period of Saladin".&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Meyer, ''Saracenic Heraldry'' (1933), p. 195, cited after ''The Flag Bulletin'' 24 (1985), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The eagle is headless and is assumed to have originally been a [[double-headed eagle]]. The Cairo Citatel is not its original location, it has been transferred there from an unknown location at an unknown time prior to 1670.&lt;ref&gt;Nasser O. Rabbat, ''The Citadel of Cairo: A New Interpretation of Royal Mameluk Architecture'' (1995),  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=9Ep8I5jCD8QC&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 24].&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that the word {{lang|ar|نسر|rtl=yes}} ''nisr'', which may mean either "eagle" or "vulture", is hugely used in Egyptian nationalism and as a symbol of pride placed right in the middle of the country's flag. Another word for "eagle" is {{lang|ar|عقاب|rtl=yes}} ''ʿuqāb'', but it's rarely ever used.

In Modern history, the eagle with its current yellowish form was first introduced as a symbol of the [[History of the Republic of Egypt|Republic of Egypt]] during the [[Egyptian revolution of 1952|1952 Egyptian revolution]]. The emblem was then inherited as the [[coat of arms of the United Arab Republic|U.A.R. coat of arms]] in 1958, and from this time the "Egyptian eagle" or the ''Eagle of Saladin'' was taken to represent wider nationalism and as a symbol of unity. 

Following the 1963 [[Ramadan Revolution]] by the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region]], the Arab eagle was introduced as the new [[coat of arms of Iraq]], directly based on the design used by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] for the Egyptian revolution.&lt;ref name="Baram1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baram|first=Amatzia|authorlink=Amatzia Baram|title=Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq,1968-89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=snyuCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA151|year=1991|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=978-1-349-21243-9|page=151, note 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federation of Arab Republics]] established by [[Muammar Gaddafi]] in 1972 at first adopted a [[Hawk of Quraish]] as its emblem, but this was replaced by the Arab eagle in 1984.&lt;ref name="Podeh2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Podeh|first=Elie|authorlink=Elie Podeh|title=The Politics of National Celebrations in the Arab Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PLuDr_TWOEoC&amp;pg=PA87|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-00108-4|pages=87–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi#Libyan Arab Republic|Gaddafi's Libyan Arab Republic]] in 1969 also adopted the eagle, but replaced it by the [[Hawk of Quraish]] in 1972.

In the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011]], the eagle was associated with the [[History of Egypt under Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak regime]]. Mehrez (2012) describes a stenciled graffiti depicting the Eagle of Saladin turned upside down as a call for the regime's downfall.{{quote|Ganzeer, an Egyptian graphics artist widely known for his revolutionary street art, explains, 'The current "Eagle of Saladin" emblem in the white band of the flag, however, wasn't used until 1984. Which means ... the current eagle on our flag belongs to Mubarak's regime.' This connection of the 'Eagle of Saladin' with the Mubarak regime provides the key to understanding this stencil piece.&lt;ref name="Mehrez2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mehrez|first=Samia|authorlink=Samia Mehrez|title=Translating Egypt’s Revolution: The Language of Tahrir|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VheWBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT119|year=2012|publisher=American University of Cairo Press|isbn=978-1-61797-356-7|pages=119–}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Pre-internet technology and education in Saudi Arabia===
#In 1979, Saudi radio channels broadcast radio education programs with support from the [http://www.mohe.gov.sa/en/default.aspx Ministry of Higher Education] and the Ministry of Education. Although not official distance-learning programs, these radio programs were designed to assist students in the traditional learning system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Albalawi|first=M.|title=Critical factors related to the implementation of web-based instruction by higher-education faculty at three universities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia|year=2007|publisher=The University of West Florida|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-internet technology and education in Saudi Arabia===
#In 1993, [[King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals]] (KFUPM) in [[Dhahran]] becomes the first Saudi institution to connect to the [[internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Is Saudi Arabia Ready for E-Learning? – A Case Study|year=n.d.|page=1|author1=Chanchary, F.  |author2=Islam, S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#In 1994, Internet was first introduced to Kingdom of Saudi Arabia when state [[academic]], medical and research institutions got access to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Internet.gov.sa.|url=http://www.internet.gov.sa/learn-the-web/guides/internet-in-saudi-arabia/view?set_language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''English Short Title Catalogue''' ('''ESTC''') is a [[Union catalog|union]] [[short-title catalogue]] of works published between 1473 and 1800, in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] and its former colonies, notably those in North America, and primarily in [[English language|English]], drawing on the collections of the [[British Library]] and other libraries in Britain and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://estc.ucr.edu/ | title = English Short-Title Catalog (1473-1800) North America | work = University of California | accessdate = 2007-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is co-managed by the British Library and the Center for Bibliographical Studies and Research (CBSR) at the [[University of California, Riverside]]. The database is freely searchable.

==History==
The ESTC began life as the '''Eighteenth-Century Short Title Catalogue''', with the same abbreviation, covering only 1701 to 1800. Earlier printed works had been catalogued in [[Alfred W. Pollard|A. W. Pollard]] and [[Gilbert Richard Redgrave|G. R. Redgrave]]'s ''Short Title Catalogue'' (1st edn 1926; 2nd edn, 1976–91) for the period 1473 to 1640; and [[Donald Goddard Wing]]'s similarly titled bibliography (1945–51, with later supplements and addenda) for the period 1641 to 1700. These works were eventually incorporated into the database.

[[Wastewater]] comes out of the [[laundry]] process with additional energy (heat), lint, soil, dyes, finishing agents, and other chemicals from detergents.&lt;ref name="steber"&gt;Steber, J., &amp; Wiebel, F. Laundry Detergents, 4. Ecology and Toxicology. ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry''. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14356007.o15_o15/full doi: 10.1002/14356007.o15_o15]&lt;/ref&gt; Some laundry wastewater goes directly into the environment, due to the flaws of water [[infrastructure]]. The majority goes to [[sewage]] treatment plants before flowing into the environment. Some chemicals remain in the water after treatment, which may contaminate the water system. They can be toxic to wildlife, or can lead to [[eutrophication]].

==General influences of laundry wastewater==
Data shows that United States has more than 35,000 laundries. On the average, a single laundry can discharge 400 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of wastewater every day.&lt;ref&gt;Ciabattia, I., Cesaro, F., Faralli, L., Fatarella, E., &amp; Tognotti, F. (2009). Demonstration of a treatment system for purification and reuse of laundry wastewater. ''Desalination'', 245(1), 451-459. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0011916409003580 doi:10.1016/j.desal.2009.02.008]&lt;/ref&gt; Annually, about 5.11&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; laundry wastewater is produced, which can fill 1,460 [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome|Superdome]]s in New Orleans.

===Treatment of laundry wastewater===
There are several parameters in the evaluation of laundry wastewater: temperature, pH-value, suspended substances, Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, sediment substances, total nitrogen, total [[phosphorus]], nitrogen ammonia, chemical oxygen demand(COD), biochemical oxygen demand(BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), anionic surfactants.&lt;ref&gt;Šostar-Turk, S., Petrinić, I., &amp; Simonič, M. (2005). Laundry wastewater treatment using coagulation and membrane filtration. ''Resources, Conservation and Recycling'', 44(2), 185-196. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344904001818 doi:10.1016/j.resconrec.2004.11.002]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemicals in detergents===
Several common [[detergent]] ingredients are [[surfactant]]s, [[builder (detergent)|builder]]s, bleach-active compounds and auxiliary agents. The surfactants can be classified into anionic, cationic and nonionic surfactants. The most widely used surfactant linear [[alkylbenzene sulfonate]] (LAS) is an anionic surfactant. In builders, sodium triphosphate, zeolite A, sodium [[nitrilotriacetate]] (NTA) are the most important substances. Bleach-active compounds are usually [[sodium perborate]] and [[sodium percarbonate]]. Enzymes and fluorescent whitening agents are added into detergents as auxiliary agents.&lt;ref name="steber" /&gt;

==Mechanism==

===Environmental harm of surfactants===

Surfactants own both hydrophilic and lipophilic properties in one molecule, so they are called surface active agents, and are widely used in various washing process. With the lipophilic tails, surfactants are biologically active. Anionic surfactants have the ability of binding to bioactive macromolecules like [[enzymes]], DNA, peptides, causing changes of surface charge and the folding of polypeptide chain(structure of protein). The function of proteins will be different. Cationic surfactant can bind to the inner membrane of bacteria, and by this way disorganize the bacteria through their long alkyl chain. Nonionic surfactants are able to bind to both proteins and phospholipid membrane, leading to leakage of low molecular mass compounds by increasing the permeability of membranes and vesicles. This may result in serious damage in cells or even cell death.&lt;ref name="ivan"&gt;Ivanković, T., &amp; Hrenović, J. (2010). Surfactants in the environment. ''Arhiv za higijenu rada i toksikologiju'', 61(1), 95-109. [http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/aiht.2010.61.issue-1/10004-1254-61-2010-1943/10004-1254-61-2010-1943.xml doi: 10.2478/10004-1254-61-2010-1943]&lt;/ref&gt;

—'''LAS and its biodegradation'''

Linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) with the formula of C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Na, also known as [[sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate]], is the most widely used anionic surfactant in laundry detergent because it has minimal environmental impact for its readily biodegradation.

A complete biodegradation under aerobic conditions consists of two steps, primary biodegradation and ultimate biodegradation. The first step begins from the terminal carbon in the alkyl chain as omega-oxidation, which can start from one or both ends, then is followed by beta-oxidation. After the first step the residual is sulfophenyl(di)carboxylates (SP(d)Cs), a large molecule which can be involved in the second step. The second step occurs only when the required bacteria exist. The ring cleavage of benzene and the further desulphonation of the mono- and dicarboxyilic sulphophenyl acids happen. After the two-step biodegradation, LAS is degraded into carbon dioxide, water, inorganic salts and residual biomass. During the biodegradation, several specific bacteria and oxygen are required in both omega-oxidation of the alkyl chain and the benzene ring cleaving process, so this biodegradation can only happen in '''aerobic conditions'''.&lt;ref name="bio-d" /&gt;  In anaerobic conditions in treatment process, LAS shows no change. Researchers also prove that biodegradation process is restricted in 20–40&amp;nbsp;mg/L and even inhibited at a higher concentration, which leads to the incomplete biodegradation of LAS in sewage treatment plants.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, D. A., Metcalfe, I. S., Xiong, F., &amp; Livingston, A. G. (2001). Wet air oxidation of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate 1. Effect of temperature and pressure.

===Harm of builders to the environment===
Builders in detergents are water softeners, which can remove calcium and magnesium ions by complexation or precipitation in a hard water (water contains a lot of calcium and magnesium).

'''[[Sodium triphosphate]]''', with a formula of Na&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, is a largely used builder in laundry detergents, which can lead to [[eutrophication]] caused by phosphorus (P). P is needed for energy transfer, the formation of DNA, RNA and many other intermediary metabolites. Only P in orthophosphate can be assimilated by autotrophs, other P compounds like sodium triphosphate can be chemically or enzymatically hydrolyzed to orthophosphate.&lt;ref&gt;Correll, D. L. (1998). The role of phosphorus in the eutrophication of receiving waters: A review. ''Journal of Environmental Quality'', 27(2), 261-266. [https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/27/2/JEQ0270020261 doi:10.2134/jeq1998.00472425002700020004x]&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism is shown below.&lt;ref name="p"&gt;McComb, R. B., Bowers, G. N., &amp; Posen, S. (1979). ''Alkaline phosphatase'' (p. 986). New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hydrolytic degradation of sodium triphosphate.jpg|framed|center|Degradation of sodium triphosphate with enzyme&lt;ref name="p" /&gt;]]

Excessive phosphorus can make for excessive production of autotrophs, like algae and cyanobacteria, leading to '''eutrophication''' in an inorganic nutrient pathway. Nutrient enrichment in lakes and reservoirs results in the microscopic floating plants, algae and formation of dense mats of larger floating plants that can produce oxygen by photosynthesis. When they die and sink to the bottom, they consume oxygen in decomposition. Bacteria thriving in this process consume oxygen. With the depletion of oxygen, fishes die and anaerobic bacteria produce [[methane]], [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[ammonia]], which can destroy the ecosystem.

==Prevention==

To reduce the eutrophication caused by sodium triphosphate, there are phosphorus-free builders substitutes nowadays, such as inorganic builders zeolite A and soda ash, and organic builders like polycarboxylates, citrates et al.

'''Erika Sylva Charvet''' (born 24 November 1951)&lt;ref name="Birthday"&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.cultura.gob.ec/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2012/09/DECLARACION-JURAMENTADA0002.pdf Declaración patrimonial jurada]&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Ecuador]]ian politician who was Minister of Culture from 21 April 2010 until 9 May 2013.&lt;ref name="Profile of Erika Sylva"&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.ministeriodecultura.gob.ec/ministra/ Ministra]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Erika Sylva was born in [[Quito]]. She is married. Her husband has an academic background like Sylva and works at the [[Central University of Ecuador|Universidad Central del Ecuador]]. She speaks her native Spanish and English.

==Education and career history==
She studied Literature in the [[Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador]] and afterwards she got her licentiate at the Universidad Central del Ecuador in Sociology and Political Science. Later on she got a postgraduate degree in Political Science by the [[Latin American Social Sciences Institute|Facultad Latinoamericano de Ciencias Sociales]] in [[Mexico]] writing her thesis about the surge of natural cultural identity in Ecuador. She spent most of her career as an academic researcher at several universities and institutions, she has an interest in gender issues.&lt;ref name="Curriculum Vitae"&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.ministeriodecultura.gob.ec/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/hoja-de-vida-ministra1.pdf Curriculum Vitae]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minister of Culture==
On 21 April 2010 Sylva joined the cabinet of [[Rafael Correa]] as Minister of Culture, she replaced Ramiro Noriega. At the ceremony of taking office she declared that one of her main objectives would be to promote cultural change among Ecuadorians. She stated: "It is necessary to promote cultural change, new values, a new vision of who we are, to fight racism, elitism, and to promote interculturalism among Ecuadorians, both women and men".&lt;ref name="Erika Sylva"&gt;[http://www.ifacca.org/national_agency_news/2010/04/22/erika-sylva-new-minister-culture/ Erika Sylva is the new Minister of Culture] on [[International Federation of Arts Councils and Culture Agencies|IFACCA]], 22 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012 it was announced that Sylva would start a project to support a culture of peace in the border area with Colombia. The goal of the project was to activate social cohesion and fight the social disintegration coming from the conflict-ridden Colombian side of the border.&lt;ref name="Border security"&gt;[http://www.ifacca.org/international_news/2012/03/27/ecuador-adds-culture-border-security-policy-colomb/ Ecuador adds culture to the border security policy with Colombia] on IFACCA, 27 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012 she received the decoration of "Honoring Honor" by the José Martí Council for World Solidarity, a project ratified by [[UNESCO]] whose objectives are, among others, to acknowledge and consolidate Latin American roots. She got her decoration for strengthening the historic ties between the peoples of Ecuador and [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name="Decoration"&gt;[http://www.unesco.lacult.org/noticias/showitem.php?uid_ext=e&amp;getipr=&amp;lg=2&amp;id=3391 President of Ecuador presented with decoration in the VII meeting of the José Martí Council] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130415082042/http://www.unesco.lacult.org/noticias/showitem.php?uid_ext=e&amp;getipr=&amp;lg=2&amp;id=3391 |date=2013-04-15 }} on [[UNESCO]], 28 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In a document by Sylva and [[Rafael Quintero (politician)|Rafael Quintero]], Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs, it was claimed that the [[Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador]] (CONAIE) has been conspiring against President Rafael Correa since 2009 to destabilize the constituent process of Ecuador. The authors furthermore claimed that CONAIE was working together with extreme right and financial help from institutions in the [[United States]]. Furthermore, it was also claimed that the indigenous movement together with the teachers union has become part of the corporatist political left. This would express itself by defending private interests and being neoliberal in nature.&lt;ref name="EisenstadtDanielson2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Todd A. Eisenstadt|author2=Michael S.

Relations between the Ecuadorian government and CONAIE have been tense since the [[2010_Ecuador_crisis#Reactions|2010 Ecuador crisis]].

On 9 May 2013 [[Francisco Velasco]] replaced Sylva as Minister of Culture. By a reshuffle of the ministries the Ministry of Culture joined with the Ministry of Heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.presidencia.gob.ec/el-desafio-de-los-proximos-cuatro-anos-es-hacer-cosas-buenas-y-mejores/ “El desafío de los próximos cuatro años es hacer cosas buenas y mejores”] on Presidency of Ecuador, 9 May 2013.

The '''Fourth World''' is an extension of the [[three-world model]], used variably to refer  to
# Sub-populations socially excluded from [[global society]];
# Hunter-gatherer, nomadic, pastoral, and some subsistence farming peoples living beyond the modern industrial norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.acpp.org/sevents/0809.html|title = International day of the world's indigenous people|work = Asian Center for the Progress of Peoples|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081204114415/http://www.acpp.org/sevents/0809.html|archivedate = 4 December 2008|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Sub-populations existing in a [[First World]] country, but with the living standards of those of a [[Third World]], or developing country.

The term is not commonly accepted. "Fourth World" has also been used to refer to other parts of the world in relation to the three-world model.

==Etymology==
''Fourth World'' follows the [[First World]], [[Second World]], and [[Third World]] classification of nation-state status; however, unlike the former categories, ''Fourth World'' is not spatially bounded, and is usually used to refer to size and shape which does not map onto citizenship in a specific nation-state. It can denote [[nation]]s without a [[sovereign state]], emphasizing the perceived non-recognition and exclusion of ethnically- and religiously-defined peoples from the politico-economic world system, such as the [[First Nations]] groups throughout North, Central and South America. Spanish [[sociologist]] [[Manuel Castells]] of the [[University of Southern California]] [[University of Southern California Annenberg School for Communication|Annenberg School for Communication]] has made extensive use of the term ''fourth world''.

==Coinage==
The term originated in Georgia with a remark by [[Mbuto Milando]], first secretary of the [[Tanzania]]n [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commission]], in conversation with [[George Manuel]], Chief of the National Indian Brotherhood (now the [[Assembly of First Nations]]). Milando stated that "When Native peoples come into their own, on the basis of their own cultures and traditions, that will be the Fourth World."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Since publication of Manuel's ''The Fourth World: An Indian Reality'' (1974), the term ''Fourth World'' became synonymous with stateless, poor, and marginal nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cwis.org/fwdp/International/statebrk.txt | title = The breakdown of states | first = Richard | last = Griggs | publisher = [[Center for World Indigenous Studies]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1979, think tanks such as the [[Center for World Indigenous Studies]] have used the term in defining the relationships between ancient, [[tribe|tribal]], and non-industrial nations and modern industrialised nation-states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cwis.org/fwdp/International/moscow93.txt | title = Toward the coexistence of nations and states | first = Rudolph C. | last = Ryser |date=September 1993 | publisher = [[Center for World Indigenous Studies]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the 2007 UN [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]], communications and organizing amongst Fourth World peoples have accelerated in the form of international treaties between aboriginal nations for the purposes of trade, travel, and security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.indiancountrytoday.com/archive/28202554.html | title = United League of Indigenous Nations formed | work = [[Indian Country Today]] | date = 10 August 2007 | first = Redwing | last = Cloud}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the Indian left movement, Dr. [[M. P.

The '''Global Marijuana March''' ('''GMM'''), also referred to as the '''Million Marijuana March''' ('''MMM'''), is an annual rally held at different locations around the world on the first Saturday in May. A notable event in [[cannabis culture]], it is associated with [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]-themed events, which may include marches, meetings, rallies, raves, concerts, festivals, and attempts at educational outreach.

The first Global Marijuana March was held in 1999.&lt;ref name=villagevoice1999may4&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/news/9918,gonnerman,5338,5.html "Smoke and Jeers.

== Events by country ==

=== Brazil ===
On June 15, 2011, the eight ministers of [[Brazil]]'s [[Supreme Federal Court|Supreme Court]] (STF) that participated in the trial were unanimous in free demonstrations for the legalization of drugs, such as the '''''Marcha da Maconha''''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈmaʁʃɐ da mɐˈkõȷ̃ɐ}}, ''Marijuana Walk'') in Brazil, in which they decided that the demonstrations are an exercise of freedom of expression and not incitement to [[Crime in Brazil|crime]], as argued judges who have banned the march in the past. The discussion of the ''Marcha da Maconha'' reached the Supreme Court in June 2009 when the Deputy Attorney General of the Republic Deborah Duprat filed the claim of breach of fundamental precept, [[ADPF 187]]. In the lawsuit, the attorney states that the legal prohibition of the demonstrations in favor of marijuana and other narcotics have been based on misinterpretation of the [[Law of Brazil|Criminal Code]]. She said that it is "wrong" to say that the realization of these events are an "apology to crime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stf.jus.br/portal/cms/verNoticiaDetalhe.asp?idConteudo=182124 |title=Notícias STF :: STF - Supremo Tribunal Federal |publisher=STF |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticias.uol.com.br/cotidiano/ultimas-noticias/2011/06/15/stf-decide-que-ato-por-legalizacao-de-drogas-e-liberdade-de-expressao-e-libera-marcha-da-maconha.htm |title=STF decide que ato por legalização de drogas é liberdade de expressão e libera Marcha da Maconha - Notícias - Cotidiano |publisher=Noticias.uol.com.br |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marijuana was brought to Brazil by its [[Slavery in Brazil|African slaves]], and with the [[Eugenics|eugenic]] [[Positivism|positivist]] intellectual and political status quo of the [[Western world|Western civilization]] in the early 20th century, its use was deemed as a signal of decadence by its stigmatized use as a [[recreational drug use|recreational drug]] of the poor, the rural people and the [[Afro-Brazilian]]. Its association with the [[counterculture]] and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[youth]]s during the highly [[Anti-Communism|anti-Communist]] [[History of Brazil (1964-1985)|military dictatorship]], initially a strong ally of the United States' government, fortified its negative perceptions both by the authorities and the masses. Nevertheless, since the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] centre-right government of [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] (1994–2002), position strengthened in the so-called ''Era [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula]]'' (2003–2010), individual marijuana use by adults started to have no major importance to police and government instances – though not (since the country has major crime problems with [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealers]]) its domestic cultivation for own consumption. One can see and smell people smoking the so-called ''maconha'' openly in Brazil's [[Centro-Sul|Centre-Southern half]] as well as in the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern states]], and recreational use of cannabis in private became more accepted among large sectors of the middle classes since the early 1990s. The academic milieu is no exception and, today, a sizeable minority of Brazilian University lecturers, students and researchers smoke marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prohibitionist Drug Policies and the Subculture of Cannabis Use in Two Brazilian Middle Class Urban Settings|url=http://www.encod.org/info/Cannabis-and-Prohibition-in-Brazil.html|date=September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2001, it was held in Victoria Park, in the center of Regina's downtown, until 2008 when changes to the City's permit policy forced organizers to change the location to Central Park.
The event features live music mixed with speakers on various topics, sometimes with only an incidental connection to marijuana.

=== France ===
In [[France]] the so-called [[:fr:Marche mondiale pour le cannabis|Marche Mondiale pour le Cannabis]] is celebrated in [[Paris]], [[Lyon]], [[Toulouse]], [[Marseille]], [[Rennes]], [[Lille]], [[Saint-Denis de la Réunion|Saint-Denis-de-la-Réunion]], [[Cognac (Charente)|Cognac]], and some other minor cities in the country.

=== New Zealand ===
In [[New Zealand]] J Day is celebrated in some of the major cities.

==== Dunedin ====
J-Day in [[Dunedin]], is celebrated in the city's centre of town, [[The Octagon, Dunedin|The Octagon]], on the first Saturday of May from 'High Noon' until 4:20 pm.
Dunedin is arguably chronologically the first city in the world to host any GMM event. Named '4:20 Extreme', local participants climb the famous [[Baldwin Street]] to meet at the top by 4:20 am. Locally J-Day coincides with The [[University of Otago]] Capping Parade, in which a multitude of ceremony-attending graduates parade down the [[George Street, Dunedin|main street]] on their way to the Town Hall ceremony, and also the University Hall Parade, in which University of Otago dormitory-student decorated themed floats parade down the main street, stopping in the Octagon typically armed with many water balloons, and collectively shouting chants of dormitory-specific pride.

Dunedin became famous for its JDay festivities in 2003 when around 50 activists marched to the Central Dunedin Police Station, where they planted cannabis plants and smoked [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] in the main foyer as acts of protest.&lt;ref&gt;[Otago Daily Times, May 5, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;  The event was given considerable national and international media attention as no arrests were made.&lt;ref&gt;[Otago Daily Times, May 6, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Central Dunedin Police Station was hot-boxed again on JDay in 2004 by over 100 activists, again with no arrests.  This second incident was also covered by the media, resulting in the Dunedin Area Police Commander, Dave Campbell, justifying the fact that no arrests were made with the quote, "We had more important things to do" in the [[Otago Daily Times]].

The 2007 International J-Day in Dunedin featured political speakers and music provided by local DJs and counted 170 people at mid-day. In the lead up to J-Day 2008, NORML NZ's Maryjane the Cannabus toured 42 towns between [[Auckland]] and [[Dunedin]] in 42 days for daily law reform rallies.  The Cannabus arrived in Dunedin, New Zealand's most cannabis friendly city, on April 25 for a week-long 'Cannabis Awareness Week'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.otagonorml.com/node/10 |title=Otago NORML presents Cannabis Awareness Week : April 25 - May 3, 2008 |publisher=Otagonorml.com |date=2008-03-13 |accessdate=2014-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512225315/http://www.otagonorml.com/node/10 |archivedate=May 12, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was planned by [[Otago NORML]] and featured public workshops, informational lectures at [[Otago University]], and a round-table discussion featuring university academics, [[Member of Parliament#New Zealand|MPs]], and policy researchers. Cannabis Awareness Week culminated with J-Day on May 3, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0802/S00178.htm |title=Public Pot Protests Set For National Road Tour |publisher=Scoop.co.nz |date=2008-02-18 |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 J-Day in Dunedin was well attended despite sleet and hail early in the day.  Over 500 supporters participated in the event, enjoying games, prizes, political speeches and music from Bushmaster and Ashes of Eden.

=== Denmark ===
'''Copenhagen'''
In [[Copenhagen]] the Marijuana march has been an annual tradition for more than 15 years. The march takes places on the first Saturday of may and departs from The [[Freetown Christiania]], walks through central Copenhagen and ends at the city hall square. Klaus Trier Tuxen from Danish the Hampepartiet has had a prominent role in organizing the event in recent years.
Cannabis smoking is illegal in Denmark, but during the march the police does not enforce this regulation and smoking is de facto allowed during the demonstration.

=== United States ===

==== Los Angeles Million Marijuana March 2011 ====
As of 2011, the [[Moorish Science Temple of America]] has been doing the [[Los Angeles]] Million Marijuana March for 13 years at [[Leimert Park, Los Angeles|Leimert park]] in Los Angeles, California. The 2-day 2011 celebration marks the first time bands have filled the 2 days. Leimert Park is a famed free speech arena, which has also held [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] rallies and more since its inception. Acclaimed rap artist Ditch headlined both days, and was in charge of band booking and advertising. The event went off well with over 2,000 people attending over the 2 days. Ditch was honored for being able to bring unity to that area among so many different races and types of people. Ditch also honored jailed freedom fighter Eddy Lepp at the event. Eddy then called in live to the audience from Federal prison in which he is serving 10 years for cultivation of marijuana. Eddy's wife Linda Lepp was on hand to receive the award. This marks the third time so far that Eddy Lepp has spoken to a live concert audience from prison. Rapper RBX also performed at the Los Angeles march marking the first time in years he has performed in South Central Los Angeles.

==== New York City ====
In 1999, during the first worldwide Million Marijuana March New York City held another of its annual marijuana marches. The ''[[Village Voice]]'' reported on the police and organizer [[crowd size estimation|estimates of the crowd size]]: "''the police claim it was 4,000 people while organizers say 20,000''".&lt;ref name=villagevoice1999may4/&gt;

In 2009, the event organizer, [[Dana Beal]], along with Chris Ryan, and Jay Stetzer on their way back from the NORML Conference in San Francisco all three men were charged with possession with intent to distribute and possession with intent to deliver 150 lbs. of marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Help Free Dana Beal|url=http://freedanabeal.blogspot.com/2009/10/help-free-dana-beal.html|website=Free Dana Beal|publisher=WordPress|accessdate=24 April 2015|ref=Reflist2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the event began to be organized by a new group of activists poised to take on New York city. It was after this that the NYC Event was renamed to, NYC Cannabis Parade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NYC Cannabis Parade|url=http://www.CannabisParade.org|website=NYC Cannabis Parade|publisher=NYC Cannabis Parade|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NYC Cannabis Parade, organized by a steering committee of activists, have turned the event into a celebration of cannabis culture in NYC with a nearly 20 block parade and 4 hour rally proceeding it, there has not been a recorded arrest for possession or use for over 4 years now. "'We have zero arrests, and we don’t plan on having any,' one sergeant told a Post reporter. Advocates praised the cops’ mellow take on toking as the latest sign New York was inching toward decriminalization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hagen, Laura|first1=Elizabeth, Italiano|title=Cops turn blind eye to pot smokers at legalization rally|url=https://nypost.com/2014/05/04/cops-turn-blind-eye-to-pot-smokers-at-cannabis-parade/|accessdate=24 April 2015|agency=New York Post|issue=Online|publisher=New York Post|date=2014-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===1953–1969: Origins===
Gumby was created by [[Art Clokey]] in the early 1950s after he finished film school at the [[University of Southern California]] (USC).&lt;ref name="AC-LA" /&gt;

Clokey's first animated film was a 1953 three-minute student film called ''[[Gumbasia]]'', a surreal montage of moving and expanding lumps of clay set to music in a parody of Disney's ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kqed.org/arts/programs/trulyca/shorts/episode.jsp?essid=14527 |title=Gumbasia |publisher=KQED |date= |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gumbasia'' was created in the "kinesthetic" style taught by Clokey's USC professor [[Slavko Vorkapić]], described as "massaging of the eye cells." Much of Gumby's look and feel was inspired by this technique of camera movements and editing.

In 1955, Clokey showed ''Gumbasia'' to movie producer Sam Engel, who encouraged him to develop his technique by animating figures into children's stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Studio – 1950's|url=http://www.premavision.com/studio/1950.htm|publisher=Premavision|accessdate=February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clokey moved forward, producing a pilot episode featuring the character Gumby.

The name "Gumby" came from the muddy clay found at Clokey's grandparents' farm that his family called "gumbo".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gaylord|first1=Chris|title=Art Clokey: How Gumby got his name|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/Horizons/2011/1012/Art-Clokey-How-Gumby-got-his-name|website=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|publisher=[[Christian Science Publishing Society]]|accessdate=February 28, 2015|date=October 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gumby's appearance was inspired by a suggestion from his wife, Ruth ([[née]] Parkander), that Gumby be based on [[the Gingerbread Man]]. The color green was then chosen because Clokey saw it as both racially neutral and a symbol of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Marchesi, Robina (Director) |year= 2006 |title=Gumby Dharma |medium=Documentary |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQVpRxUwi8U&amp;t=4m16s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gumby's legs and feet were made wide for pragmatic reasons; they ensured that the character would stand up during [[Stop motion|stop-motion filming]]. Gumby's famous slanted head was based on the hairstyle of Clokey's father, Charles Farrington, in an old photograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=A. Schneider |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/patc/gumby/index.html |title=Gumby, a segment of NPR's "Present at the Creation" series |publisher=NPR |date=March 25, 2002 |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Quintanilla|first1=Michael|title=Feat of Clay : Pop culture: Who would have thought a stretchy green blob could entertain generation after generation?

Clokey's pilot episode was seen by [[NBC]] executive Thomas Warren Sarnoff, who asked Clokey to make another one. The second episode, ''Gumby on the Moon'', became a huge hit on ''[[Howdy Doody]]'', leading Sarnoff to order a series in 1955 entitled ''The Gumby Show''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Clokey Interview|url=http://emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/art-clokey|website=Emmy TV Legends|publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences Foundation]]|accessdate=February 27, 2015|date=July 19, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 and 1956, 25 eleven-minute episodes aired on NBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Clokey|publisher=KQED Public Media for Northern California|url=http://www.kqed.org/arts/profile/index.jsp?essid=14526|accessdate=February 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early episodes, Gumby's voice was provided by Ruth Eggleston, wife of the show's art director Al Eggleston,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gumby's Name, Personality and Voice|url=http://www.gumbyworld.com/gumby-characters/gumby/gumbys-name-personality-voice|publisher=GumbyWorld.com/Premavision|accessdate=June 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; until [[Dallas McKennon]] assumed her role in 1957. Gumby's best friend, an orange pony named Pokey, was introduced during the earliest episodes. Because of its variety-type format, ''The Gumby Show'' featured not only Clokey's puppet films, but also interviews and games. During this time, the show went through a succession of two hosts, [[Bobby Nicholson|Robert Nicholson]] and [[Pinky Lee]].&lt;ref name=TVP-Butler&gt;{{cite web|last=Butler|first=Kevin S.|title=Gumby on TV|url=http://www.tvparty.com/lostgumby.html|accessdate=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gumby Show, The|url=http://www.toonarific.com/show.php?show_id=1548|publisher=Toonarific Cartoons|accessdate=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Feed-a-matic chair3.JPG|right|thumb|267px|''Mr. Stuff'' gives Gumby all the goodies he can hold in "[[Pigs Is Pigs (1937 film)#The Gumby Show|Grub Grabber Gumby]]".]]

In 1959, ''The Gumby Show'' entered syndication, and more episodes were produced in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perlmutter|first1=David|title=America Toons In: A History of Television Animation|date=March 18, 2014|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]]|location=[[Jefferson, North Carolina]]|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production started in Hollywood and in 1960 moved to a larger studio in [[Glendora, California|Glendora]], California, where it remained until production ended in 1969. During this time, Gumby was primarily voiced by [[Norma MacMillan]], and occasionally by [[Ginny Tyler]]. The cartoon shorts introduced new characters including a blue mermaid named Goo and a yellow dinosaur named Prickle.

===1982–1989: Revival===
Beginning in 1982, Gumby was parodied by [[Eddie Murphy]] on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tomashoff|first1=Craig|title=Celebrate Eddie Murphy’s Career With A Streampix Salute|url=http://xfinity.comcast.net/blogs/tv/2013/04/02/celebrate-eddie-murphys-birthday-with-a-streampix-salute/|website=[[Xfinity]]|publisher=[[Comcast]]|accessdate=February 28, 2015|date=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Murphy’s parody, when the television cameras were turned off, the sweet Gumby reverted to his true self: an irascible, cigar-chomping celebrity who was highly demanding of the production executives.  Whenever the executives refused to give in to his demands, Gumby would assert his star status by saying “I’m ''Gumby'', dammit!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=82i: Eddie Murphy / Lionel Richie|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/82/82igumby.phtml|website=Saturday Night Live Transcripts|accessdate=February 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the original Gumby shorts enjoyed a revival on [[home video]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Cartoon Cassettes To Animate The Holidays|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=December 17, 1987|last=Solomon|first=Charles|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1986-12-17/entertainment/ca-3233_1_animated-features|accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Gumby appeared in ''[[The Puppetoon Movie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=James|first1=Caryn|title=Movie Review – The Puppetoon Movie (1987)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B0DEFDF163CF931A25755C0A961948260|accessdate=February 26, 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 12, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This renewed interest led to a reincarnation of the series consisting of 99 new seven-minute episodes produced for [[television syndication]] in association with [[Lorimar-Telepictures]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lenburg|first1=Jeff|title=Who's Who in Animated Cartoons: An International Guide to Film and Television's Award-Winning and Legendary Animators|date=June 1, 2006|publisher=Applause Books|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FocusedAudio"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meyers|first1=Paul|title=The return of ''Gumby''|journal=[[Post Magazine]]|date=1989|url=http://www.focusedaudio.com/articles/clipPOST_89_RetOfGumby.html|accessdate=February 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dallas McKennon]] returned to voice Gumby in the new adventures, in which Gumby and his pals traveled beyond their toyland-type setting and established themselves as a musical band. The show also included new characters, such as Gumby's little sister Minga, a [[mastodon]] named Denali and a chicken named Tilly.&lt;ref name="FOC" /&gt;

In addition to the new episodes, the 1950s and 1960s shorts were included in the series, but with new audio. The voices were re-recorded and the original music was replaced by Jerry Gerber's [[synthesizer]] score from the 1987 series.&lt;ref name="FocusedAudio" /&gt; Legal issues prevented Clokey from renewing rights to the original [[Capitol Records]] production tracks.

===1990–present: feature film and reruns===
Starting in 1992, TV channels such as [[Nickelodeon]] and [[Cartoon Network]] aired reruns of ''Gumby'' episodes. In 1995, Clokey's production company produced an independently released theatrical film, ''[[Gumby: The Movie]]'', marking the character's first feature-length adventure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= For Feat of Clay, He's Left a Lasting Impression|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=November 27, 1993|first=Michael|last=Quintanilla|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1993-11-27/local/me-61520_1_gumby-movie|accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, the villainous Blockheads replace Gumby and his band with robots and kidnap their dog, Lowbelly. The movie featured in-joke homages to science-fiction films such as ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', ''[[The Terminator]]'' and ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. In 1998, the ''Gumby'' episode "Robot Rumpus" was featured on ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Episode 912- The Screaming Skull|url=http://www.mst3kinfo.com/aceg/9/912/ep912.html|website=Satellite News|accessdate=February 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 16, 2007, [[YouTube]] announced that all Gumby episodes would appear in their full-length form on its site, digitally remastered and with their original soundtracks. This deal also extended to other video sites, including [[America Online|AOL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2007/03/16/youtube-troubles-are-over-they-got-gumby/| first=Michael | last=Arrington|date=March 16, 2007| accessdate = March 16, 2007| work=TechCrunch|title=YouTube Troubles Are Over: They Got Gumby}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2007, [[KQED-TV]] broadcast an hour-long documentary ''Gumby Dharma'' as part of its ''Truly CA'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kqed.org/arts/truly/episode.jsp?eid=160077 |title=Gumby Dharma: Truly CA |publisher=KQED Public Media |date=March 27, 2007 |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Me-TV]] began airing ''Gumby'' on weekend morning, in its weekend morning animation block.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Mark K.|title=Me-TV and Broadcast Partners Set Deal|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/56934/metv-and-broadcast-partners-set-deal|website=TVNewsCheck|accessdate=February 28, 2015|date=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show remained part of the channel's programming until the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AniMe-TV|url=http://metvnetwork.com/AniMeTV.php|website=ME-TV Network|publisher=[[Weigel Broadcasting]]|accessdate=February 28, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104154048/http://metvnetwork.com/AniMeTV.php|archivedate=January 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 8, 2015, it was announced that a new ''Gumby'' series was in the works, co-produced by the [[Jim Henson Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2015/04/08/gumby-returns/|title=Gumby returns|work=kidscreen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
In 1993, ''[[TV Guide]]'' named ''Gumby'' the best cartoon series of the 1950s in its issue celebrating 40 years of television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[TV Guide]] |date=April 17–23, 1993|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1994, the [[Library of Congress]] used Gumby as a "spokescharacter" for ''Adventures into Books: Gumby's World'', a traveling exhibition that promoted the [[Center for the Book]]'s national reading campaign from 1997 to 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Exhibit Supports 'Building a Nation of Readers'|journal=Library of Congress Information Bulletin|date=January 1998|volume=57|issue=1|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9801/cfb.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1990s, Gumby and Pokey had also appeared in various commercials for [[Cheerios]] cereal, most notably [[Frosted Cheerios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |year=1996|title=Frosted Cheerios commercial|trans-title= |medium=Television advertisement|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQoC6IwfKSc|access-date=February 28, 2015|time=0:20|publisher=[[General Mills]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 4, 2006, the [[Center for Puppetry Arts]] in Atlanta opened ''Art Clokey's Gumby: The First Fifty Years''. This exhibition featured many of the original puppets and sets, along with screening of Art Clokey's films. This event was conceived by David Scheve of T.D.A. Animation and Joe Clokey of Premavision, and was one of several exhibits that opened around the country, celebrating the 50th anniversary of ''The Gumby Show''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frye|first1=Shannon|title=Center for Puppetry Arts &amp; Joe Clokey Celebrate Gumby's 50th Birthday|url=http://www.puppet.org/pdf/CPA_R_0607GUMBY.pdf|publisher=[[Center for Puppetry Arts]]|accessdate=February 26, 2015|date=July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The children's book ''Gumby Goes to the Sun'' was also published that year to commemorate the anniversary. The book was originally created in the 1980s by Clokey's daughter, Holly Harman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gumby Goes to the Sun|url=http://isbn.directory/book/9780977655106|website=ISBN.Directory|accessdate=February 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the ''Gumby'' comic book series was nominated for two [[Eisner Award]]s, Best New Series and Best Publication for a Young Audience, and won the latter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/eisner07.php "2007 Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards"]. Hahn Library Comic Book Awards Almanac. Retrieved May 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 12, 2011, [[Google]] paid tribute to Art Clokey’s 90th birthday with a [[Google Doodle|doodle]] featuring clay balls transforming into characters from the show. The doodle was composed of a toy block with a "G" and five clay balls in the Google colors. Clicking each of the balls revealed the Blockheads, Prickle, Goo, Gumby and Pokey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/art-clokeys-90th-birthday|title=Art Clokey 90th Birthday – Google Doodle|accessdate=February 28, 2015|date=October 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 episode of the Disney XD's ''[[Gravity Falls]]'' called "Little Gift Shop of Horrors", the character of Soos Ramirez appears in the "Clay Day" segment resembling Gumby.

== Merchandising ==
[[File:Gumbygame.png|frame|right|Screenshot of the video game ''Gumby vs. the Astrobots'']]

Various Gumby merchandise has been produced over the years, the most prominent item being bendable figures by Lakeside Toys. Several single packs and multi-figure sets by Jesco (later [[Trendmasters]]), as well as a 50th anniversary collection, have been made of the Gumby characters. Also included in the Gumby merchandise catalog are [[plush doll]]s, [[keychain]]s, [[mug]]s, a 1988 [[Colorforms]] set, a 1995 Trendmasters playset and a [[Kubrick (toy)|Kubricks]] set by Medicom. A tribute album, ''[[Gumby (album)|Gumby: The Green Album]]'', produced by Shepard Stern, was released in 1989 through [[Disney Music Group|Buena Vista Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ehrbar|first1=Greg|title=Mouse Tracks: The Story of Walt Disney Records|date=2006|publisher=[[University Press of Mississippi]]|location=[[Jackson, Mississippi]]|pages=182–183|edition=First|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGdpWCTdb-IC&amp;pg=PA183&amp;lpg=PA183&amp;dq=Shepard+Stern+Gumby&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SlJaJ-ElNv&amp;sig=7bx3NT8JAgq0sp7bBcvYN7pta2I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vFHyVIb-DJSfyATSjYKIBQ&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Shepard%20Stern%20Gumby&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, the first [[video game]] featuring Gumby, ''Gumby vs. the Astrobots'', was released by [[Namco]] for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. In it, Gumby must rescue Pokey, Prickle and Goo after they are captured by the Blockheads and their cohorts, the Astrobots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gumby vs. the Astrobots – Gameboy Advanced|url=http://www.ign.com/games/gumby-vs-the-astrobots/gba-726532|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|accessdate=February 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gumby images and toys are registered trademarks of [[Prema Toy Company]]. [[Premavision]] owned the distribution rights to the ''Gumby'' cartoons, having been reverted from previous distributor [[Warner Bros.

A '''gynandromorph''' is an organism that contains both [[male]] and [[female]] characteristics. The term ''gynandromorph'', from Greek "gyne" female,  "andro" male, and "morphé" form, is mainly used in [[entomology]]. These organisms are notable in butterflies, moths and other insects, where both male and female body parts can be distinguished physically because of [[sexual dimorphism]].

== Occurrence in other genera ==
Gynandromorphism has been observed in numerous animal species, e.g., [[crustaceans]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; such as [[lobsters]] and [[crabs]], many [[bird]] species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=7730–5 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0408350102 |laysummary=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=unique-bird-sheds-light-o |laysource=[[Scientific American]] |laydate=March 25, 2003 |title=Sexually dimorphic expression of trkB, a Z-linked gene, in early posthatch zebra finch brain |year=2005 |first1=Xuqi |last1=Chen |first2=Robert J. |last2=Agate |first3=Yuichiro |last3=Itoh |first4=Arthur P. |last4=Arnold |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=102 |issue=21 |pmid=15894627 |pmc=1140405|bibcode=2005PNAS..102.7730C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gouldian finch]]

These birds have lateralised brain structures in the face of a common steroid signal, providing strong evidence for a non-hormonal primary sex mechanism regulating brain differentiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=701–8 |doi=10.1038/nrn1494 |title=Sex chromosomes and brain gender |year=2004 |last1=Arnold |first1=Arthur P. |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=5 |issue=9 |pmid=15322528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pattern of distribution of male and female tissues in a single organism ==
A gynandromorph can have [[bilateral symmetry|bilateral asymmetry—]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;one side female and one side male.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/jul/12/half-male-half-female-butterfly | title=Half male, half female butterfly steals the show at Natural History Museum | publisher=The Guardian | date=12 July 2011 | accessdate=August 6, 2011 | author=Ian Sample, science correspondent | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, the distribution of male and female tissue can be more haphazard.

Bilateral gynandromorphy arises very early in development, typically when the organism has between 8 and 64 cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Malmquist |date=June 15, 2005 |title=Rare crab may hold genetic secrets |url=http://www.vims.edu/newsandevents/topstories/archives/2005/dual_sex_crab.php |publisher=Virginia Institute of Marine Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later stages produce a more random pattern.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

== Causes ==
The cause of this phenomenon is typically, but not always, an event in [[mitosis]] during early development.  While the organism contains only a few cells, one of the dividing cells does not split its sex chromosomes typically.  This leads to one of the two cells having sex chromosomes that cause male development and the other cell having chromosomes that cause female development.  For example, an XY cell undergoing mitosis duplicates its chromosomes, becoming XXYY.  Usually this cell would divide into two XY cells, but in rare occasions the cell may divide into an X cell and an XYY cell. If this happens early in development, then a large portion of the cells are X and a large portion are XYY.  Since X and XYY dictate different sexes, the organism has tissue that is female and tissue that is male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James K.|last=Adams|date= |title=Gynandromorphs |url=http://www.daltonstate.edu/galeps/Gynandromorphs.htm |publisher=Department of Natural Sciences, Dalton State College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A developmental network theory of how gynandromorphs develop from a single cell based on internetwork links between parental [[allelic]] [[chromosomes]] is given in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |first=Eric|last=Werner|year= 2012 |title=A Developmental Network Theory of Gynandromorphs, Sexual Dimorphism and Species Formation |arxiv=1212.5439}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major types of gynandromorphs, bilateral, polar and oblique are computationally modeled.  Many other possible gynandromorph combinations are computationally modeled, including predicted morphologies yet to be discovered. The article relates gynandromorph developmental control networks to how species may form. The models are based on a computational model of [[bilateral symmetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |first=Eric|last=Werner|year= 2012 |title=The Origin, Evolution and Development of Bilateral Symmetry in Multicellular Organisms |arxiv=1207.3289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== As a research tool ==
Gynandromorphs occasionally afford a powerful tool in genetic, developmental, and behavioral analyses.  In ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', for instance, they provided evidence that male courtship behavior originates in the brain,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hotta|first=Y, and Benzer, S.|date=1972|title=Mapping of Behaviour in Drosophila mosaics|url=|journal=Nature|volume=240|pages=527–535|doi=10.1038/240527a0|via=|bibcode=1972Natur.240..527H}}&lt;/ref&gt; that males can distinguish conspecific females from males by the scent or some other characteristic of the posterior, dorsal, [[integument]] of females,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nissani|first=M.|date=1975|title=A new behavioral bioassay for an analysis of sexual attraction and pheromones in insects|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology|volume=192 |issue=2|pages=271–5|doi=10.1002/jez.1401920217|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hotta|first=Y., Benzer, S.|date=1976|title=Courtship in Drosophila mosaics: sex-specific foci for sequential action patterns|url=|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A|volume=73 |issue=11|pages=4154–4158|doi=10.1073/pnas.73.11.4154|via=|bibcode=1976PNAS...73.4154H}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the germ cells originate in the posterior-most region of the [[blastoderm]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1977|title=Cell lineage analysis of germ cells of Drosophila melanogaster|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v265/n5596/abs/265729a0.html|journal=Nature|volume=265|pages=729–731|doi=10.1038/265729a0|via=|bibcode=1977Natur.265..729N}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that somatic components of the gonads originate in the mesodermal region of the fourth and fifth abdominal segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Szabad|first=Janos, and Nothiger, Rolf|date=1992|title=Gynandromorphs of Drosophila suggest one common primordium for the somatic cells of the female and male gonads in the region of abdominal segments 4 and 5|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/develop/115/2/527.full.pdf|journal=Development|volume=115|pages=527–533|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
In his autobiography, ''Speak, Memory'', the writer and [[lepidopterist]] [[Vladimir Nabokov]] describes a gynandromorph butterfly, male on one side, female on the other, that he caught as a youth on his family's [[Russia]]n estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nabokov|first=Vladimir|title=Speak, Memory|year=1967|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|location=New York|pages=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Kim Stanley Robinson's novel, ''[[2312 (novel)|2312]]'', some people choose to turn themselves into functional gynandromorphs.  For example, the main protagonist, Swan Er Hong, is a gynandromorph.  She was born a female, identifies herself as one, and mothered children.  But she also fathered children, after acquiring male reproductive organs.

==Plot==

Academy-bus driver Jang Kyung-chul runs into Jang Joo-yun one snowy night and offers to fix her flat tire. Kyung-chul kills her and scatters her body parts. When a boy discovers one of Joo-yun's ears, the police are called in under the command of Section Chief Oh and Squad Chief Jang (Joo-yun's father). Kim Soo-hyun, a secret service agent of the National Intelligence Service (NIS) and Joo-yun's fiancé, vows to track down and take vengeance on Joo-yun's murderer.

Jang supplies Soo-hyun with a list of four suspects, including Kyung-chul. Searching Kyung-chul's home, Soo-hyun finds jewelry and underwear taken from numerous victims. The discovery of Joo-yun's engagement ring proves that Kyung-chul is the killer. Soo-hyun places a tracking device on the school bus, following and then attacking Kyung-chul while he is sexually assaulting his latest victim - one of the schoolgirls he was transporting home. Beating him unconscious, Soo-hyun places a NIS transmitter inside Kyung-chul, allowing him to track him on radar and listen to his conversations. Waking up, Kyung-chul flags down a taxi. During the ride, Kyung-chul realizes that the two men in the cab are thugs looking to rob and possibly kill him. He stabs both men to death. After finding the real taxi driver in the trunk, Kyung-chul disposes of all three bodies before going to a medical center, where he attempts to sexually assault a nurse Han Song-yi. Soo-hyun intervenes and slashes Kyung-chul's Achilles tendon before letting him go again.

Kyung-chul goes to the home of his friend Tae-joo, a cannibalistic murderer. After explaining his situation, Tae-joo remarks that whoever is after him must have some relation to one of his victims. Soo-hyun arrives while Kyung-chul is having anal sex with Se-jung (Tae-joo's girlfriend), proceeding to incapacitate both murderers along with Se-jung after a fierce fight. The next day, both Tae-joo and Se-jung are found by the police and sent to a hospital. A trusted subordinate of Soo-hyun ensures he and Kyung-chul are sent to a private medical area away from the police. The barely conscious Kyung-chul hears them talk about the transmitter inside him.

Soo-hyun dumps Kyung-chul, intending to continue stalking him. Kyung-chul taunts him over the transmitter, now knowing who he is. Kyung-chul brutally assaults a pharmacist while searching for laxatives, forcing Soo-hyun to rush to the aid of the victim. Kyung-chul uses this time to defecate out the transmitter and place it inside a taxi driver he viciously assaults in a public restroom. Soo-hyun interrogates Tae-joo and learns that Kyung-chul is going after Joo-yun's father Jang and sister Jang Se-yun.

Soo-hyun is too late to stop Kyung-chul, who blinds Jang with a dumbbell and mutilates Se-yun. He narrowly abducts Kyung-chul before he can give up himself to the police. Soo-hyun tortures him before setting up a guillotine above Kyung-chul's head, which is triggered when his parents and son arrive to visit him and open the door to the room. Placing a transmitter nearby, Soo-hyun hears the death of Kyung-chul and his family's reaction to his decapitated corpse. Alternating between sobbing and fits of laughter, Soo-hyun suffers a mental breakdown while walking away from the house.

Jeannette Catsoulis of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "From an unexpectedly moving first act to a hilariously disgusting sojourn with Kyung-chul’s cannibal pal, Mr. Kim and his cinematographer, Lee Mogae, retain complete control of the film’s fluctuating tones and impressive set pieces."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2011/03/04/movies/04i-saw-the-devil.html | work=The New York Times | first=Jeannette | last=Catsoulis | title='I Saw the Devil' - Review | date=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Olson of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote, "There is all the violent mayhem, for certain, but the thing that sets ''I Saw the Devil'' apart is its undercurrent of real emotion and how unrelentingly sad it can be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/04/entertainment/la-et-capsules-saw-devil-20110304 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Mark | last=Olsen | title=Movie review: 'I Saw the Devil' | date=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rob Nelson from ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine stated, "Repugnant content, grislier than the ugliest torture porn, ought to have made the film unwatchable, but it doesn't, simply because Kim's picture is so beautifully filmed, carefully structured and viscerally engaging."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117943653?refcatid=31 | work=Variety | first=Rob | last=Nelson | title=I Saw the Devil | date=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horror website [[Bloody Disgusting]] gave it a 4.5/5 rating and stated, "I could talk for hours about I Saw the Devil, but nothing I can say will ever do it justice. The film is an experience; it’s something that will have you emotionally invested in the characters, while also covering your eyes at the extreme violence",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/113902/i-saw-the-devil-limited-2/| work=Bloody Disgusting| title=I Saw the Devil | date=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas ''[[Empire magazine|Empire]]'' awarded the film with a 4/5 score, stating, "This gleefully black horror-thriller is a very classy follow-up to ''The Good, the Bad, the Weird'' for Kim Jee-Woon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/review.asp?FID=137195| work=Empire| title=I Saw the Devil}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phelim O'Neil from ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote, "There's no shortage of Korean revenge-thrillers, but this, along with the recent ''The Man from Nowhere'', proves there is plenty of life left in the genre" and gave it a four star rating out five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/28/i-saw-the-devil-review| work=The Guardian| title=I Saw the Devil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all critics were favorable towards the film's brutality; Mark Jenkins of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote, "Director Kim Jee-woon is a born filmmaker, even if this script (written by Park Hoon Jung and adapted by Kim) is unworthy of his efforts" and rated it 2 out of 5 stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/gog/movies/i-saw-the-devil-akmareul-boattda,1178295.html| work=Washington Post| title=I Saw the Devil}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote, "On any number of levels, ''Devil'' is troublesome at best, offensive at worst".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/i-saw-devil-film-review-30159| work=The Hollywood Reporter| title=I Saw the Devil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Rolling Stone'' magazine put ''I Saw the Devil'' in the top 20 of "the scariest movies you've never seen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/lists/20-scariest-movies-you-need-to-see-20141029/i-saw-the-devil-2010-20141029 | title = I saw the devil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Keum-boo''''' (also '''''Kum-Boo''''' or '''''Kum-bu'''''—[[Korean language|Korean]] "attached gold") is an ancient [[Korea]]n [[gilding]] technique used to apply thin sheets of [[gold]] to [[silver]], to make [[silver-gilt]]. Traditionally, this technique is accomplished by first [[depletion gilding#Variations|depleting]] a surface of [[sterling silver]] to bring up a thin layer of [[Millesimal fineness#Silver|fine silver]]. Then [[Millesimal fineness#Gold|24 carat]] [[Metal leaf|gold foil]] is applied with heat and pressure—[[Gilding#Mechanical gilding|mechanical gilding]]—to produce a permanent [[diffusion]] bond. 

Pure precious metals such as gold and silver have a very similar [[atomic structure]] and therefore have a good potential for bonding. Heating these metals to a temperature between 500–700°F increases the movement of the atoms. When pressure is added, this causes an electron exchange at the surface between the two metals, creating a permanent diffusion bond. This diffusion bond occurs far below the [[brazing|soldering]] temperature for either metal (Dhein, 2004).

Examples of this technique have probably been observed, but not positively identified on pieces from the second half of the first millennium B.C. and from the early first millennium A.D. (Oddy, 1981).

This technique is used in many cultures, including Chinese, Japanese and in the West to bond gold to other metals, including [[iron]], [[copper]], [[aluminum]], gold alloys, white gold, [[palladium]] and [[platinum]]. Foil made from gold alloys can be applied to silver and other metals by first [[depletion gilding]] the surface of the foil (Lewton-Brain, 1987–1993).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17481">This is the '''list of the fields of doctoral studies in the United States''' used for the annual Survey of Earned Doctorates, conducted by [[NORC at the University of Chicago]] for the [[National Science Foundation]] and other federal agencies, as used for the 2015 survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvydoctorates/surveys/srvydoctorates_2015.pdf|pages= 6 &amp; 7 |title=Survey of Earned Documents questionnaire 2015 – Field of Study listing |publisher=NORC/NSF|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These are fields of [[Doctorate#Research-oriented doctorates|research-oriented doctoral studies]], leading mostly to [[PhD]]s – in the academic year 2014–15, 98% of the 55,006 research doctorates awarded in the U.S. were PhDs; 1.1% were [[EdD]]s; 0.9% were other research doctorates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17306/data/taba2.pdf|title=Research degrees included in the Survey of Earned Doctorates: 2011–15|publisher=NSF|work=Doctorate Recipients from U.S. Universities: 2015|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Professional degree]]s, though they are also considered doctorates (earned, not honorary), and do entitle the holder to call themselves "Doctor", such as [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]], [[Doctor of Dental Surgery|DDS]], [[Doctor of Veterinary Medicine|DVM]], [[Juris Doctor|JD]], [[Doctor of Pharmacy|DPharm]], [[Doctor of Ministry|DMin]] and [[Doctor of Psychology|PsyD]], are not included in the survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17306/technotes.cfm#|title=Technical Notes|publisher=NSF|at=Survey Design|work=Doctorate Recipients from U.S. Universities: 2015|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mad scientist.svg|thumb|One popular [[stereotype]] of a mad scientist: male, aging, crooked teeth, messy hair, lab coat, [[effervescent]] test tube, goggles, gloves and a dramatic pose]]
'''Mad scientist''' (also '''mad doctor''' or '''mad professor''')  is a [[caricature]] of a [[scientist]] who is described as "mad" or "insane" owing to a combination of unusual or unsettling personality traits and the unabashedly ambitious, [[taboo]] or [[hubris]]tic nature of their experiments. As a [[motif (narrative)|motif]] in fiction, the mad scientist may be [[villain]]ous ('''evil genius''') or antagonistic, benign or neutral; may be [[psychosis|insane]], [[eccentricity (behaviour)|eccentric]], or clumsy; and often works with [[fictional technology]] or fails to recognize or value common human objections to attempting to [[Playing God (ethics)|play God]]. Some may have benevolent or good-spirited intentions, even if their actions are dangerous or questionable, which can make them accidental villains.

The prototypical fictional mad scientist was [[Victor Frankenstein]], creator of his [[Frankenstein's monster|eponymous monster]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encyclopædia Britannica - Frankenstein|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Frankenstein|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clemens|first1=Valdine|title=Return of the Repressed, The: Gothic Horror from The Castle of Otranto to Alien|page=93|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=QwYpYZ7rndMC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=prototypical+mad+scientist+frankenstein|accessdate=10 November 2015|isbn=9780791499276}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Daniel H.|last2=Long|first2=Anna C.|title=The Mad Scientist Hall of Fame|isbn=978-0806528793|page=100|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=UpjV_w7R_roC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=prototypical+mad+scientist+frankenstein|accessdate=10 November 2015|date=2008-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; who made his first appearance in 1818, in the novel ''[[Frankenstein|Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus]]'' by [[Mary Shelley]]. Though the novel's title character, Victor Frankenstein, is a sympathetic character, the critical element of conducting experiments that cross "boundaries that ought not to be crossed", heedless of the consequences, is present in Shelley's novel. Frankenstein was trained as both an [[alchemist]] and a modern scientist, which makes him the bridge between two eras of an evolving archetype. The book is said to be a precursor of a new genre, [[science fiction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Abrams |first1=M.

The year 1896 saw the publication of [[H. G. Wells]]'s ''[[The Island of Doctor Moreau]],'' in which the titular doctor—a controversial [[vivisection]]ist—has isolated himself entirely from civilisation in order to continue his experiments in surgically [[Uplift (science fiction)|reshaping animals into humanoid forms]], heedless of the suffering he causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Novels: The Island of Doctor Moreau|url=http://academic.depauw.edu/aevans_web/HONR101-02/WebPages/Spring2006/Schmid(Todd)/wells.html|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinema depictions===
[[File:Maniac9.jpg|thumb|left|[[Horace B. Carpenter]] as Dr. Meirschultz, a scientist attempting to bring the dead back to life in the 1934 film ''[[Maniac (1934 film)|Maniac]]''.]]
[[Fritz Lang]]'s movie ''[[Metropolis (1927 movie)|Metropolis]]'' ([[1927 in film|1927]]) brought the [[archetype|archetypical]] mad scientist to the screen in the form of [[Rotwang]], the evil genius whose machines had originally given life to the [[dystopia]]n city of the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Geraghty|first1=Lincoln|title=American Science Fiction Film and Television|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=WkILrUVObWQC&amp;pg=PT26&amp;dq=rotwang+metropolis+mad+scientist|accessdate=10 November 2015|isbn=9780857850768|date=2009-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rotwang's [[laboratory]] influenced many subsequent movie sets with its [[spark gap#Visual entertainment|electrical arcs]], bubbling apparatus, and bizarrely complicated arrays of dials and controls. Portrayed by actor [[Rudolf Klein-Rogge]], Rotwang himself is the prototypically conflicted mad scientist; though he is master of almost mystical scientific power, he remains a slave to his own desires for power and revenge.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Rotwang's appearance was also influential—the character's shock of flyaway hair, wild-eyed demeanor, and his quasi-[[fascist]] laboratory garb have all been adopted as shorthand for the mad scientist "look." Even his mechanical right hand has become a mark of twisted scientific power, echoed notably in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s film ''[[Dr. Strangelove|Dr. Strangelove, Or--How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb]]'' and in the novel ''[[The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch]]'' (1965) by [[Philip K. Dick]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

A recent survey of 1,000 horror films distributed in the UK between the 1930s and 1980s reveals mad scientists or their creations have been the villains of 30 percent of the films; scientific research has produced 39 percent of the threats; and, by contrast, scientists have been the heroes of a mere 11 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Frayling]], ''[[New Scientist]]'', 24 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post–World War II depictions===
Mad scientists were most conspicuous in [[popular culture]] after [[World War II]]. The sadistic [[Nazi human experimentation|human experimentation]] conducted under the auspices of the [[Nazism|Nazis]], especially those of [[Josef Mengele]], and the invention of the [[atomic bomb]], gave rise in this period to genuine fears that science and technology had gone out of control. That the scientific and technological build-up during the [[Cold War]] brought about increasing threats of unparalleled destruction of the human species did not lessen the impression. Mad scientists frequently figure in [[science fiction]] and [[film|motion pictures]] from the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=G.|first1=Fraser|title=The Particle Century|url=https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=pgasJfizmocC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=%22mad+scientist%22+%22post-war%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22mad%20scientist%22%20%22post-war%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 January 2017|isbn=9781420050332|date=1998-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The censuses of the Habsburg Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary, similarly to other pre-World War I  censuses in Europe, were based on the "first language" principle, i.e., the "mostly used language" of the person or family.&lt;ref&gt;New Europe College, Universitatea din București: Nation and National Ideology: Past, Present and Prospects : Proceedings of the International Symposium Held at the New Europe College, Bucharest.  p. 328-329, {{ISBN|9789739862493}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Magyarization''' (also ''Magyarisation'', ''Hungarization'', ''Hungarisation'', ''Hungarianization'', ''Hungarianisation''), after "Magyar"—the [[wikt:autonym#Noun|autonym]] of Hungarians—was an [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] or [[acculturation]] process by which non-Hungarian nationals came to adopt the [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] culture and language, either voluntarily or due to [[social pressure]], often in the form of a coercive policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/1903/8910/1/umi-umd-5951.pdf|title=page60|author=|date=|website=umd.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the era of national awakening, the Hungarian intellectuals transposed the concepts of the so-called "Political Nation" and Nation State from the Western European countries (especially the principles of the similarly highly multiethnic 18th century France), which included the idea of linguistic and cultural assimilation of minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Stefan Berger]] and Alexei Miller|title=Nationalizing Empires|publisher=Central European University Press|year=2015|page=409|ISBN=9789633860168|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=__9fCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA409 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hungarian Nationalities Law (1868) guaranteed that all citizens of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]), whatever their nationality, constituted politically "''a single nation, the indivisible, unitary Hungarian nation''", and there could be no differentiation between them except in respect of the official usage of the current languages and then only insofar as necessitated by practical considerations.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; In spite of the law, the use of minority languages was banished almost entirely from administration and even justice.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; Defiance of, or appeals to, the Nationalities Law met with derision or abuse.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; The [[Hungarian language]] was overrepresented in the primary schools, and almost all secondary education was in Hungarian.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

During the [[long nineteenth century]], the Hungarian politicians and intellectuals stood firmly on the contemporary liberal conception of nationality question, which based solely on [[individualism]]. With the idea of individualism, they tried to reduce the minority question into a simple linguistic rights question, thus they denied the collective nationality rights and any plans for ethnic autonomous territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Oskar Krejčí]]|title=Geopolitics of the Central European Region: The View from Prague and Bratislava|publisher= ÚPV SAV Slovak Academy of Science [[Institute of Political Science of SAS]] Published at lulu.com|page=281|year=2005|ISBN=9788022408523|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=38ciAe4J4VMC&amp;pg=PA281 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 19th century, the state apparatus was entirely Hungarian in language, as were business and social life above the lowest levels.{{Copyright violation|date=September 2016}} The Magyarization of the towns had proceeded at an astounding rate. Nearly all middle-class [[Jews]] and [[Germans]] and many middle-class [[Slovaks]] and [[Ruthenes]] had been Magyarized.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; The percentage of the population with Hungarian as its mother tongue grew from 46.6% in 1880 to 54.5% in 1910. The 1910 census (and the earlier censuses) did not register ethnicity, but mother tongue (and religion) instead, based on which it is sometimes subject to [[Treaty of Trianon#Criticism of the 1910 census|criticism]].
However, most of the Magyarization happened in the centre of Hungary and among the middle classes, who had access to education; and much of it was the direct result of [[urbanization]] and [[industrialization]]. It had hardly touched the rural populations of the periphery, and [[natural language|linguistic]] [[frontier]]s had not shifted significantly from the line on which they had stabilized a century earlier.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= |first= |author= |authorlink= |editor= |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |title=Hungary – Social and economic developments |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-34807/Hungary#411318.hook |accessdate=2008-05-20 |edition= |year=2008 |publisher= |volume= |location= |id= |isbn= |doi= |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process continued also in post-[[Treaty of Trianon|Trianon]] era. The political and cultural rights offered to interwar Hungary's ethnic minorities were more limited than their equivalents in any other country of [[East-Central Europe]].&lt;ref name=Rothschild&gt;{{Cite book|author=Joseph Rothschild|title=East Central Europe between the two World Wars|publisher=University of Washington Press|page=193|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; While anyone who resisted Magyarization was, indeed, subject to political and cultural handicaps, they were not subject to the kinds of civic and fiscal tricks (prejudicial court proceedings, overtaxation, biased application of social and economic legislation) that some of Hungary's neighbors often inflicted on their ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name=Rothschild /&gt;

The term specifically applies to the policies that were enforced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?cd=5&amp;id=PjsTeamzeN8C&amp;dq=magyarization&amp;q=%22+forced+Magyarization+%22+#search_anchor |title=Western civilization: ideas, politics &amp; society.

When referring to personal and geographic names, Magyarization refers to the replacement of a non-Hungarian name with a Hungarian one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tNzaAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=magyarization+of+names&amp;dq=magyarization+of+names&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lzE4Tp7BCoPCswbcuRE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg |title=The policy of the Hungarian state concerning the Romanian church in ... – Mircea Păcurariu – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date=1990-01-01 |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fglavred.info%2Farchive%2F2010%2F11%2F05%2F130109-5.html |title=Google Translate |publisher=Translate.google.com |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As is often the case with policies intended to forge or bolster national identity in a state, Magyarization was perceived by other ethnic groups such as the [[Romanians]], [[Slovaks]], [[Ruthenians]] ([[Rusyn people|Rusyns]] or [[Ukrainians]]), [[Croats]], [[Serbs]], etc., as aggression or active discrimination, especially where they formed the majority of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tNzaAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Magyarization+oppression&amp;dq=Magyarization+oppression&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eTM4TvDrF47xsgaSxK3nDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAw |title=The policy of the Hungarian state concerning the Romanian church in ... – Mircea Păcurariu – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date=1990-01-01 |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p_oLAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Magyarization+oppression&amp;dq=Magyarization+oppression&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eTM4TvDrF47xsgaSxK3nDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg |title=The Central European Observer – Joseph Hanč, F.

==In the Middle Ages==
At the time of the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|Magyar conquest]] the Hungarian tribal alliance consisted of tribes of different ethnic backgrounds. There had to be a substantial [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] element (e.g. [[Kabars]]).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lendvai, The Hungarians: A Thousand Years of Victory in Defeat, C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers, 2003, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The subjugated local population in the Hungarian settlement area (mainly the lowland territories) quickly merged with the Hungarians. In the period between the 9th and 13th centuries more groups of Turkic peoples migrated to Hungary ([[Pechenegs]], [[Cumans]] etc.). Their past presence is visible in the occurrence of Turkic settlement names.

According to [[History of the Székely people#Origins|one of the theories]], the ancestors of [[Székelys]] are [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]] or Turkic [[Bulgars]] who were Magyarized in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis P. Hupchick. ''Conflict and Chaos in Eastern Europe''. [[Palgrave Macmillan]], 1995. p.55.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that the Székely people descended from a Hungarian-speaking "[[Late Avar]]" population or from ethnic Hungarians who received special privileges and developed their own consciousness.

As a reward for their achievements in wars, noble titles were granted to some Romanian [[Knez (title)|knez]]es. They entered Hungarian nobility, a part of them converting to Catholicism and their families being Magyarized: the Drágffy (Drăgoşteşti), [[Hunyadi family|Hunyadi]], Kendeffy (Cândeşti), Majláth (Mailat) or Jósika families were among the Romanian-origin Hungarian noble families.&lt;ref&gt;(Romanian) László Makkai .

==Historical context of the modern-times Magyarization==
Between 1000-1784 and 1790–1844, Latin was the language of administration, legislation and schooling in Kingdom of Hungary.{Cf. http://hungarianparliament.com/history/} [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] (1780–90), a monarch influenced by the Enlightenment sought to centralize control of the empire and to rule it as an enlightened despot.&lt;ref name=Country&gt;{{cite book|url=http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/hutoc.html |title=A Country Study: Hungary – Hungary under the Habsburgs |accessdate= 2008-11-30 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |work=Federal Research Division |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt; More than two and one half centuries following upon Martin Luther's "95 Theses" (1517) that in Central Europe, finally receptive of Protestantism, Emperor Joseph ll decreed that [[German language|German]] replace [[Latin]] as the empire&amp;apos;s official language.&lt;ref name=Country/&gt; In 1790, the change in administrative and next official language had signaled the narrowing terminus of the Holy Roman Empire. This centralization/homogenization struggle was not unique to Joseph II, it was a trend that one could observe all around Europe with the birth of the enlightened idea of [[Nation State]].

Hungarians perceived Joseph's language reform as German [[cultural hegemony]], and they reacted by insisting on the right to use their own tongue.&lt;ref name=Country/&gt; As a result, Hungarian lesser nobles sparked a renaissance of the [[Hungarian language]] and culture.&lt;ref name=Country/&gt; The lesser nobles questioned the loyalty of the magnates, of whom less than half were ethnic Magyars, and even those had become [[French language|French-]] and German-speaking courtiers.&lt;ref name=Country/&gt;

The Magyarization policy actually took shape as early as the 1830s, when Hungarian started replacing Latin and German in education. Magyarization lacked any religious, racial or otherwise exclusionary component. Language was the only issue. The eagerness of the Hungarian government in its Magyarization efforts was comparable to that of tsarist [[Russification]] from the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Finno-Ugric republics and the Russian state, by Rein Taagepera  1999. p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1840s [[Lajos Kossuth]] pleaded in the newspaper ''[[Pesti Hirlap]]'' for rapid Magyarization: "Let us hurry, let us hurry to Magyarize the Croats, the Romanians, and the Saxons, for otherwise we shall perish".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ioan Lupaș]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_0ppAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22the+Croats,+the+Romanians+and+the+saxons%22&amp;dq=%22the+Croats,+the+Romanians+and+the+saxons%22&amp;hl=ro&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PenTUtriDoSmhAeR-4HACg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA The Hungarian Policy of Magyarization] (p. 14).

The term Magyarization is used in regards to the national policies put into use by the government of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], which was part of the Habsburg Empire. The beginning of this process dates to the late 18th century&lt;ref&gt;Pástor, Zoltán, ''Dejiny Slovenska: Vybrané kapitoly''. Banská Bystrica: Univerzita Mateja Bela. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and was intensified after the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], which increased the power of the Hungarian government within the newly formed [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Riff, ''The Face of Survival: Jewish Life in Eastern Europe Past and Present'', Valentine Mitchell, London, 1992, {{ISBN|0-85303-220-3}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; some of them had little desire to be declared a national minority like in other cultures. However, Jews in Hungary appreciated the emancipation in Hungary at a time when anti-semitic laws were still applied in Russia and Romania. Large minorities were concentrated in various regions of the kingdom, where they formed significant majorities. In [[Transylvania]] proper (1867 borders), the 1910 census finds 55.08% Romanian-speakers, 34.2% Hungarian-speakers, and 8.71% German-speakers.
[[Upper Hungary|In the north of the Kingdom]], Slovaks and Ruthenians formed an ethnic majority also, in the southern regions the majority were South Slavic Croats, Serbs and Slovenes and in the western regions the majority were Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Katus, László: ''A modern Magyarország születése. Magyarország története 1711–1848.'' Pécsi Történettudományért Kulturális Egyesület, 2010. p. 553.&lt;/ref&gt;
The process of Magyarization did not succeed in imposing the Hungarian language as the most used language in all territories in the Kingdom of Hungary. In fact the profoundly multinational character of historic Transylvania was reflected in the fact that during the fifty years of the dual monarchy, the spread of Hungarian as the second language remained limited.&lt;ref&gt;Katus, László: ''A modern Magyarország születése. Magyarország története 1711–1848.'' Pécsi Történettudományért Kulturális Egyesület, 2010. p. 558.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, 5.7% of the non-Hungarian population, or 109,190 people, claimed to have a knowledge of the Hungarian language; the proportion rose to 11% (183,508) in 1900, and to 15.2% (266,863) in 1910. These figures reveal the reality of a bygone era, one in which millions of people could conduct their lives without speaking the state's official language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/404.html Religious Denominations and Nationalities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929224604/http://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/404.html |date=29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The policies of Magyarization aimed to have a Hungarian language [[surname]] as a requirement for access to basic government services such as local administration, education, and justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.genealogy.ro/cont/13.htm |title=Magyarization process |publisher=Genealogy.ro |date=1904-06-05 |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1850 and 1910 the ethnic Hungarian population increased by 106.7%, while the increase of other ethnic groups was far slower: Serbians and Croatians 38.2%, Romanians 31.4% and Slovaks 10.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/igl.geschichte/vocelka/SS2002/vo_ss2002_1006.htm|title=IGL - SS 2002 - ao.

The Magyarization of Budapest was rapid&lt;ref name="Lukacs"&gt;[[John Lukacs]]. ''Budapest 1900: A Historical Portrait of a City and Its Culture'' (1994) p.102&lt;/ref&gt; and it implied not only the assimilation of the old inhabitants, but also the Magyarization of the immigrants. In the capital of Hungary, in 1850 56% of the residents were Germans and only 33% Hungarians, and in 1910 almost 90% declared themselves Magyars.&lt;ref&gt;István Deák. ''Assimilation and nationalism in east central Europe during the last century of Habsburg rule'', Russian and East European Studies Program, University of Pittsburgh, 1983 (p.11)&lt;/ref&gt; This evolution had benefic influence to the Hungarian culture and literature.&lt;ref name="Lukacs"/&gt;

According to census data, the Hungarian population of Transylvania increased from 24.9% in 1869 to 31.6% in 1910. In the same time, the percentage of Romanian population decreased from 59.0% to 53.8% and the percentage of German population decreased from 11.9% to 10.7%. Changes were more significant in cities with predominantly German and Romanian population. For example, the percentage of Hungarian population increased in [[Braşov]] from 13.4% in 1850 to 43.43% in 1910, meanwhile the Romanian population decreased from 40% to 28.71% and the German population from 40.8% to 26.41%.

The first Hungarian government after the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], the 1867–1871 [[liberalism|liberal]] government led by Count [[Gyula Andrássy]] and sustained by [[Ferenc Deák]] and his followers, passed the 1868 Nationality Act, that declared "all citizens of Hungary form, politically, one nation, the indivisible unitary Hungarian nation (''nemzet''), of which every citizen of the country, whatever his personal nationality (''nemzetiség''), is a member equal in rights." The Education Act, passed the same year, shared this view as the Magyars simply being ''primus inter pares'' ("first among equals"). At this time ethnic minorities "de jure" had a great deal of cultural and linguistic autonomy, including in education, religion, and local government.&lt;ref&gt;Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 362–363.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after education minister Baron [[József Eötvös]] died in 1871, and in Andrássy became [[List of foreign ministers of Austria-Hungary|imperial foreign minister]], Deák withdrew from active politics and [[Menyhért Lónyay]] was appointed [[prime minister of Hungary]]. He became steadily more allied with the Magyar gentry, and the notion of a Hungarian political nation increasingly became one of a Magyar nation. "[A]ny political or social movement which challenged the hegemonic position of the Magyar ruling classes was liable to be repressed or charged with 'treason'..., 'libel' or 'incitement of national hatred'. This was to be the fate of various [[Slovaks|Slovak]], [[South Slavs|South Slav]] [e.g. [[Serbs|Serb]]], [[Romanians|Romanian]] and [[Ruthenes|Ruthene]] cultural societies and nationalist parties from 1876 onward..."&lt;ref&gt;Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 363–364.&lt;/ref&gt; All of this only intensified after 1875, with the rise of [[Kálmán Tisza]],&lt;ref&gt;Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; who as [[List of Interior Ministers of Hungary#Austria-Hungary|minister of the Interior]] had ordered the closing of [[Matica slovenská]] on 6 April 1875. Until 1890, [[Kálmán Tisza]], when he served as prime minister, brought the [[Slovaks]] many other measures which prevented them from keeping pace with the progress of other [[European nations]].&lt;ref name="Struggle for Survival"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kirschbaum | first = Stanislav J. | authorlink =  | title = A History of Slovakia: The Struggle for Survival | publisher = [[Macmillan Publishers|Palgrave Macmillan]]; [[St. Martin's Press]] | date = March 1995 | location = New York | url = http://us.macmillan.com/ahistoryofslovakia | isbn = 978-0-312-10403-0 | page = a136 b139 c139 | access-date = 2 August 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080925041206/http://us.macmillan.com/ahistoryofslovakia | archive-date = 25 September 2008 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a long time, number of non-Hungarians that lived in the Kingdom of Hungary was much larger than a number of ethnic Hungarians. According to the 1787 data, the population of the Kingdom of Hungary numbered 2,322,000 Hungarians (29%) and 5,681,000 non-Hungarians (71%). In 1809, the population numbered 3,000,000 Hungarians (30%) and 7,000,000 non-Hungarians (70%). As an increasingly intense Magyarization policy was implemented after 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Bideleux and Jeffries, 1998, pp. 362–364.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hungarian 1849 bank note.jpg|thumb|320px|A so-called "''[[Lajos Kossuth|Kossuth]] banknote''" from 1849 (during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|revolution]]) with multilingual inscriptions.]]

Although in [[Slovaks|Slovak]], [[Romanians|Romanian]] and [[Serbs|Serbian]] history writing administrative and often repressive Magyarization is usually singled out as the main factor accountable for the dramatic change in the ethnic composition of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in the 19th century, it should be noted that spontaneous assimilation was also an important factor. In this regard, it must be pointed out that large territories of central and southern Kingdom of Hungary lost their previous, predominantly Magyar population during the numerous wars fought by the [[Habsburg]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires in the 16th and 17th centuries. These empty lands were repopulated, by administrative measures adopted by the Vienna Court especially during the 18th century, by Hungarians and Slovaks from the northern part of the Kingdom that avoided the devastation (see also [[Royal Hungary]]), Swabians, Serbs (Serbs were majority in most southern parts of the Pannonian Plain during Ottoman rule, i.e. before those Habsburg administrative measures), Croats and Romanians. Various ethnic groups lived side by side (this ethnic heterogeneity is preserved until today in certain parts of [[Vojvodina]], [[Bačka]] and [[Banat]]). After 1867, Hungarian became the [[lingua franca]] on this territory in the interaction between ethnic communities, and individuals who were born in mixed marriages between two non-Magyars often grew a full-fledged allegiance to the Hungarian nation.&lt;ref&gt;Ács, Zoltán: ''Nemzetiségek a történelmi Magyarországon''. Kossuth, Budapest, 1986. p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course since Latin was the official language until 1844 and the country was directly governed from Vienna (which excluded any large-scale governmental assimilation policy from the Hungarian side before the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], the factor of spontaneous assimilation should be given due weight in any analysis relating to the demographic tendencies of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Katus, László: ''A modern Magyarország születése. Magyarország története 1711–1848.'' Pécsi Történettudományért Kulturális Egyesület, 2010. p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

The other key factor in mass ethnic changes is that between 1880 and 1910 about 3&amp;nbsp;million &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ufr-anglais.univ-paris7.fr/ETUDIANTS/infopedagogiques/code%2041%20CI1US2/Immigration.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200126/http://www.ufr-anglais.univ-paris7.fr/ETUDIANTS/infopedagogiques/code%2041%20CI1US2/Immigration.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of Austro-Hungarians migrated to the [[United States]] alone. More than half of them were from Hungary (1.5&amp;nbsp;million+ or about 10% of the total population) alone.&lt;ref name="reframed"&gt;Rogers Bruebaker: ''Nationalism Reframed'', New York, Cambridge University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yosi Goldshṭain, Joseph Goldstein: Jewish history in modern times&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the 1.5&amp;nbsp;million that fled to the US (2/3 of them or about a million were ethnically non Hungarians) mainly Romanians and Serbs had migrated to their newly established mother states in large numbers, like the [[Principality of Serbia]] or the [[Romanian Old Kingdom|Kingdom of Romania]], who proclaimed their independence in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;Katus, László: ''A modern Magyarország születése. Magyarország története 1711–1848.'' Pécsi Történettudományért Kulturális Egyesület, 2010. p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=December 2013}} Amongst them were such noted people, like the early aviator [[Aurel Vlaicu]] (represented on the 50 [[Romanian leu|Romanian lei]] banknote) or famous writer [[Liviu Rebreanu]] (first illegally in 1909, then legally in 1911) or [[Ion Ivanovici]]. Also many fled to [[Western Europe]] or other parts of the [[Americas]].

===Allegation of violent oppression===

Many Slovak intellectuals and activists (such as [[Janko Kráľ]]) were imprisoned or even sentenced to death during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyklopédia spisovateľov Slovenska''.

The massacre caused the Kingdom of Hungary to lose prestige in the eyes of the world when English historian [[Robert William Seton-Watson|R. W.

Magyarország története 1711–1848.'' Pécsi Történettudományért Kulturális Egyesület, 2010. p. 570.&lt;/ref&gt;

The writers who condemned forced Magyarization in printed publications were likely to be put in jail either on charges of ''treason'' or for ''incitement of national hatred''.&lt;ref name=Bideleux&gt;Robert Bideleux and Ian Jeffries, ''A History of Eastern Europe: Crisis and Change'', Routledge, 1998, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools funded by churches and communes had the right to provide education in minority languages. These church-funded schools, however, were mostly founded before 1867, that is, in different socio-political circumstances. In practice, the majority of students in commune-funded schools who were native speakers of minority languages were instructed exclusively in Hungarian.

Beginning with the 1879 Primary Education Act and the 1883 Secondary Education Act, the Hungarian state made more efforts to reduce the use of non-Magyar languages, in strong violation of the 1868 Nationalities Law.&lt;ref name=Bideleux/&gt;

The number of minority-language schools was steadily decreasing: in the period between 1880 and 1913, when the number of Hungarian-only schools almost doubled, the number of minority language-schools almost halved.&lt;ref name="Romsics"&gt;Romsics, Ignác. ''Magyarország története a huszadik században'' ("A History of Hungary in the 20th Century"), pp. 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Transylvanian Romanians had more Romanian-language schools under the Austro-Hungarian Empire rule than there were in the Romanian Kingdom itself. Thus, for example, in 1880, in Austro-Hungarian Empire there were 2,756 schools teaching exclusively in the Romanian language, while in the Kingdom of Romania there were only 2,505 (The Romanian Kingdom gained its independence from the Ottoman Empire only two years before, in 1878).&lt;ref name="Raffay"&gt;Raffay Ernő: A vajdaságoktól a birodalomig-Az újkori Románia története = From voivodates to the empire-History of modern Romania, JATE Kiadó, Szeged, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The process of Magyarization culminated in 1907 with the ''lex Apponyi'' (named after education minister [[Albert Apponyi]]) which forced all primary school children to read, write and count in Hungarian for the first four years of their education. From 1909 religion also had to be taught in Hungarian.&lt;ref name=SlovakiaInHistory&gt;{{cite book|last=Teich|first=Mikuláš|title=Slovakia in History|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrC1HFgjJxsC&amp;pg=PA272&amp;dq=census+1910+hungary+manipulated&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=h_FdTu2XKcKo8QPkusmbAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=census%201910%20hungary%20manipulated&amp;f=false|author2=Dušan Kováč |author3=Martin D.

The effect of Magyarization on the education system in Hungary was very significant, as can be seen from the official statistics submitted by the Hungarian government to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] (formally, all the [[Jewish people]] of the kingdom were considered as Hungarians, who had higher ratio in tertiary education than Christians):

===Election system===
The census system of the post-1867 Kingdom of Hungary was unfavourable to those of non-Hungarian nationality. According to the 1874 election law, which remained unchanged until 1918, only the upper 5.9% to 6.5% of the whole population had voting rights.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-archiv.parlament.hu/fotitkar/angol/book_2011.pdf, pg. 21&lt;/ref&gt; That effectively excluded almost the whole of the peasantry and the working class from Hungarian political life. The percentage of those on low incomes was higher among other nationalities than among the Magyars, with the exception of Germans who were generally richer. From a Hungarian point of view, the structure of the settlement{{clarify|date=December 2013}} system was based on differences in earning potential and wages. The Hungarians and Germans were much more urbanised than Slovaks, Romanians and Serbs in the Kingdom of Hungary.

In 1900, nearly a third of the deputies were elected by fewer than 100 votes, and close to two-thirds were elected by fewer than 1000 votes.&lt;ref name="setonwatson1911"&gt;R. W. Seton-Watson, ''Corruption and reform in Hungary'', London, 1911&lt;/ref&gt; Transylvania had an even worse representation: the more Romanian a county was, the fewer voters it had. Out of the Transylvanian deputies sent to Budapest, 35 represented the 4 mostly Hungarian counties and the major towns (which together formed 20% of the population), whereas only 30 deputies represented the other 72%{{clarify|date=December 2013}} of the population, which was predominantly Romanian.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Seton-Watson, ''A history of the Roumanians'', Cambridge, University Press, 1934, p. 403&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="castellan89"&gt;Georges Castellan, ''A history of the Romanians'', Boulder, 1989, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, even the electorate that elected only one-third of the deputies had a non-proportional ethnic composition.&lt;ref name="setonwatson1911"/&gt; The Magyars who made up 54.5% of the population of the Kingdom of Hungary represented a 60.2% majority of the electorate. Ethnic Germans made up 10.4% of the population and 13.0% of the electorate. The participation of other ethnic groups was as follows: Slovaks (10.7% in population, 10.4% in the electorate), Romanians (16.1% in population, 9.9% in the electorate), Rusyns (2.5% in population, 1.7% in the electorate), Croats (1.1% in population, 1.0% in the electorate), Serbs (2.2% in population, 1.4% in the electorate), and others (2.2% in population, 1.4% in the electorate).

Officially, Hungarian electoral laws never contained any legal discrimination based on nationality or language. The high [[census suffrage]] was not uncommon in other European countries in the 1860s but later the countries of Western Europe gradually lowered and at last abolished their census suffrage. That never happened in the Kingdom of Hungary, although electoral reform was one of the main topics of political debates in the last decades before World War I.

===The Magyarization of personal names===
[[Image:Bánffy Dezső Ellinger.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Prime Minister [[Dezső Bánffy]] (1895–1899), strong supporter of Magyarization]]
Hungarian authorities put constant pressure upon all non-Hungarians to Magyarize their names and the ease with which this could be done gave rise to the nickname of ''Crown Magyars'' (the price of registration being one korona).&lt;ref name="setonwatson1934"&gt;R. W. Seton-Watson, ''A history of the Roumanians'', Cambridge, University Press, 1934, p. 408&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881 the "Central Society for Name Magyarization" (Központi Névmagyarositó Társaság) was founded in 1881 in [[Budapest]]. The aim of this private society was to provide advice and guidelines for those who wanted to Magyarize their surnames. [[Simon Telkes]] became the chairman of the society, and professed that "one can achieve being accepted as a true son of the nation by adopting a national name". The society began an advertising campaign in the newspapers and sent out circular letters. They also made a proposal to lower the fees for changing one's name. The proposal was accepted by the Parliament and the fee was lowered from 5 [[Forint]]s to 50 [[Krajcár]]s. After this the name changes peaked in 1881 and 1882 (with 1261 and 1065 registered name changes), and continued in the following years at an average of 750–850 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elib.hu/00000/00060/html/074/pc007478.html|title=A Pallas nagy lexikona|author=|date=|website=www.elib.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Dezső Bánffy|Bánffy]] administration there was another increase, reaching a maximum of 6,700 applications in 1897, mostly due to pressure from authorities and employers in the government sector. Statistics show that between 1881 and 1905 alone, 42,437 surnames were Magyarized, although this represented less than 0.5% of the total non-Hungarian population of the Kingdom of Hungary.&lt;ref name="setonwatson1934" /&gt; Voluntary Magyarization of German or Slavic-sounding surnames remained a typical phenomenon in Hungary during the whole course of the 20th century.

According to Hungarian statistics&lt;ref&gt;{{hu icon}} Kozma, István, [http://www.historia.hu/archivum/2000/000506kozma.htm A névmagyarosítások története. A családnév-változtatások], ''História'' (2000/05-06)&lt;/ref&gt; and considering the huge number of assimilated persons between 1700 and 1944 (~3&amp;nbsp;million) only 340,000–350,000 names were Magyarised between 1815 and 1944; this happened mainly inside the Hungarian-speaking area. One Jewish name out of 17 was Magyarised, in comparison with other nationalities: one out of 139 (Catholic) -427{{clarify|date=December 2013}} (Lutheran) for Germans and 170 (Catholic) -330 (Lutheran) for Slovaks.

The attempts to assimilate the Carpatho-Rusyns started in the late 18th century, but their intensity grew considerably after 1867. The agents of forced Magyarization endeavored to rewrite the history{{clarify|date=December 2013}} of the Carpatho-Rusyns with the purpose of subordinating them to Magyars by eliminating their own national and religious identity. Carpatho-Rusyns were pressed to add Western Rite practices to their Eastern Christian traditions and efforts were made to replace the Slavonic liturgical language with Hungarian.&lt;ref&gt;D. Oliver Herbel.

Oxford University Press (2013). p. 29-30&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Magyarization of place names===
Together with Magyarization of personal names and surnames, the exclusive use of the Hungarian forms of place names, instead of multilingual usage, was also common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sHMEIRM84ScC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=Magyarization+of+personal+names+and+surnames,+geographical+names&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gDI4TsnFAoT2sga4yMEa&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Ethnizität, Moderne und Enttraditionalisierung|first=Mosheh|last=Tsuḳerman|date=17 May 2018|publisher=Wallstein Verlag|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; For those places that had not been known under Hungarian names in the past, new Hungarian names were invented and used in administration instead of the former original non-Hungarian names. Examples of places where non-Hungarian origin names were replaced with newly invented Hungarian names are: Szvidnik&amp;nbsp;– Felsővízköz (in Slovak [[Svidník]], now [[Slovakia]]), Sztarcsova&amp;nbsp;– Tárcsó (in Serbian [[Starčevo]], now [[Serbia]]), Lyutta&amp;nbsp;– Havasköz (in Ruthenian [[Lyuta]], now [[Ukraine]]), Bruck&amp;nbsp;– Királyhida (now [[Bruck an der Leitha]], Austria).&lt;ref name=LelkesHelysegnev&gt;Lelkes György: Magyar helységnév-azonosító szótár, Talma Könyvkiadó, Baja, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; (although Bruck and Királyhida were two separate towns, separated by the boundary formed by the river Leitha)

==Migration==
During the dualism era, there was an internal migration of segments of the ethnically non-Hungarian population to the Kingdom of Hungary's central predominantly Hungarian counties and to Budapest where they assimilated. The ratio of ethnically non-Hungarian population in the Kingdom was also dropping due to their overrepresentation among the migrants to foreign countries, mainly to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;István Rácz, ''A paraszti migráció és politikai megítélése Magyarországon 1849–1914.'' Budapest: 1980. p. 185–187.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=December 2013}} Hungarians, the largest ethnic group in the Kingdom representing 45.5% of the population in 1900, accounted for only 26.2% of the emigrants, while non-Hungarians (54.5%) accounted for 72% from 1901 to 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Júlia Puskás, ''Kivándorló Magyarok az Egyesült Államokban, 1880–1914.'' Budapest: 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=December 2013}} The areas with the highest emigration were the northern mostly Slovak inhabited counties of [[Sáros county|Sáros]], [[Szepes county|Szepes]], [[Zemplén county|Zemlén]], and from [[Ung county]] where a substantial [[Rusyns|Rusyn]] population lived. In the next tier were some of the southern counties including [[Bács-Bodrog]], [[Torontál]], [[Temes County|Temes]], and [[Krassó-Szörény]] largely inhabited by Serbs, Romanians, and Germans, as well as the northern mostly Slovak counties of [[Árva (county)|Árva]] and [[Gömör-Kishont]], and the central Hungarian inhabited county of [[Veszprém (former county)|Veszprém]]. The reasons for emigration were mostly economic.&lt;ref&gt;László Szarka, ''Szlovák nemzeti fejlõdés-magyar nemzetiségi politika 1867–1918.'' Bratislava: 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=December 2013}} Additionally, some may have wanted to avoid Magyarization or the draft, but direct evidence of other than economic motivation among the emigrants themselves is limited.&lt;ref&gt;Aranka Terebessy Sápos, "Középső-Zemplén migrációs folyamata a dualizmus korában." ''Fórum Társadalomtudományi Szemle'', III, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kingdom's administration welcomed the development as yet another instrument of increasing the ratio of ethnic Hungarians at home.&lt;ref&gt;László Szarka, ''A szlovákok története.'' Budapest: 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=December 2013}}

The Hungarian government made a contract with the English-owned [[Cunard Line|Cunard Steamship Company]] for a direct passenger line from [[Rijeka]] to [[New York City|New York]]. Its purpose was to enable the government to increase the business transacted through their medium.&lt;ref&gt;James Davenport Whelpey, ''The Problem of the Immigrant.'' London: 1905.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=December 2013}}

By 1914, a total number of 3&amp;nbsp;million had emigrated,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ufr-anglais.univ-paris7.fr/ETUDIANTS/infopedagogiques/code%2041%20CI1US2/Immigration.htm Immigration push and pull factors, conditions of living and restrictive legistration] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200126/http://www.ufr-anglais.univ-paris7.fr/ETUDIANTS/infopedagogiques/code%2041%20CI1US2/Immigration.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}, UFR d'ETUDES ANGLOPHONES, Paris&lt;/ref&gt; of whom about 25% returned. This process of returning was halted by World War I and the [[partition of Austria-Hungary]]. The majority of the emigrants came from the most indigent social groups, especially from the agrarian sector. Magyarization did not cease after the collapse of Austria-Hungary but has continued within the borders of the post-WW-I Hungary throughout most of the 20th century and resulted in high decrease of numbers of ethnic Non-Hungarians.&lt;ref&gt;Loránt Tilkovszky, ''A szlovákok történetéhez Magyarországon 1919–1945.

==Jews==
[[File:Hatvany-Deutsch Sándor.jpg|thumb|170px|left|[[Sándor Hatvany-Deutsch]], a Jewish entrepreneur, who was created baron by King [[Francis Joseph I of Austria|Francis Joseph I]] in 1908]]
In the nineteenth century, the [[Neolog Judaism|Neolog]] Jews were located mainly in the cities and larger towns. They arose in the environment of the latter period of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] - generally a good period for upwardly mobile Jews, especially those of modernizing inclinations. In the Hungarian portion of the Empire, most Jews (nearly all Neologs and even most of the Orthodox) adopted the Hungarian language as their primary language and viewed themselves as "[[Magyars]] of the Jewish persuasion".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Riff, The Face of Survival: Jewish Life in Eastern Europe Past and Present, Valentine Mitchell, London, 1992, {{ISBN|0-85303-220-3}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish minority which to the extent it is attracted to a secular culture is usually attracted to the secular culture in power, was inclined to gravitate toward the cultural orientation of Budapest.&lt;ref name=Indiana&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Jews of East Central Europe Between the World Wars |last=Mendelsohn |first=Ezra |authorlink= |year=1987 |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |location= |isbn=0-253-20418-6 |url= |page=87 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (The same factor prompted Prague Jews to adopt an Austrian cultural orientation, and at least some Vilna Jews to adopt a Russian orientation.&lt;ref name=Indiana/&gt;)

After the [[Jewish Emancipation#Dates of emancipation|emancipation of Jews in 1867]], the Jewish population of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (as well as the ascending [[German people|German]] population)&lt;ref&gt;Erényi Tibor: A zsidók története Magyarországon, Változó Világ, Budapest, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; actively embraced Magyarization, because they saw it as an opportunity for [[assimilation (sociology)|assimilation]] without conceding their religion. (We also have to point out that in the case of the Jewish people that process had been preceded by a process of [[Germanization]]&lt;ref name=Indiana/&gt; earlier performed by Habsburg rulers). Stephen Roth writes, "Hungarian Jews were opposed to [[Zionism]] because they hoped that somehow they could achieve equality with other Hungarian citizens, not just in law but in fact, and that they could be integrated into the country as Hungarian Israelites. The word 'Israelite' ({{lang-hu|Izraelita}}) denoted only religious affiliation and was free from the ethnic or national connotations usually attached to the term 'Jew'. Hungarian Jews attained remarkable achievements in business, culture and less frequently even in politics. During the cabinet of pm. [[István Tisza]] three Jewish men were appointed as ministers. The first was Samu Hazai (Minister of War), János Harkányi (Minister of Trade) and János Teleszky (Minister of Finance). But even the most successful Jews were not fully accepted by the majority of the Magyars as one of their kind—as the events following the [[Nazism|Nazi]] German [[Operation Margarethe|invasion of the country]] in [[World War II]] so tragically demonstrated."  &lt;!-- punctuation follows the book cited, please leave it. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Stephen.

Valentine Mitchell, London, 1992, {{ISBN|0-85303-220-3}}. p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1930s and early 1940s [[Budapest]] was a [[wikt:safe haven|safe haven]] for Slovak, German and Austrian Jewish refugees&lt;ref name=US&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005264 |title=Budapest |accessdate=2008-06-02 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |work=Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030404223157/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005264 |archivedate=4 April 2003 |dead-url=yes |quote= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a center of Hungarian Jewish cultural life.&lt;ref name=US/&gt;

In 2006 the Company for Hungarian Jewish Minority could not collect 1000 signatures for a petition to declare Hungarian Jews a minority&lt;ref name="index"&gt;[http://index.hu/politika/belfold/zskis6272/ Index - Nem lesz kisebbség a zsidóság&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; even though there are at least 100,000 Jews in the country. The official Hungarian Jewish religious organization, [[Mazsihisz]] advised not to vote for the new status because they think that Jews identify themselves as a religious group, not as a 'national minority'. There was no real control throughout the process and non-Jewish people could also sign the petition.&lt;ref name="index"/&gt;

==Notable dates==
*1844&amp;nbsp;– Hungarian is gradually introduced for all civil records (kept at local parishes until 1895). German became an official language again after the 1848 revolution, but the laws reverted in 1881 yet again. From 1836 to 1881, 14,000 families had their name Magyarized in the area of Banat alone.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}
*1849&amp;nbsp;– Hungarian Parliament during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|revolution of 1848]] acknowledged and enacted foremost the ethnic and minority rights in the world.
*1874&amp;nbsp;– All Slovak secondary schools (created in 1860) were closed. Also the [[Matica slovenská]] was closed down in April 1875. The building was taken over by the Hungarian government and the property of Matica slovenská, which according to the statutes belonged to the [[Slovaks|Slovak nation]], was confiscated by the [[Béla Wenckheim|Prime Minister's office]], with the justification that, according to Hungarian laws, there did not exist a [[Slovaks|Slovak nation]].&lt;ref name="Struggle for Survival"/&gt;{{Dead link|date=December 2013}}

*1898&amp;nbsp;– Simon Telkes publishes the book "How to Magyarize family names".
*1907&amp;nbsp;– The Apponyi educational law made Hungarian a compulsory subject in all schools in the Kingdom of Hungary. This also extended to confessional and communal schools, which had the right to provide instruction in a minority language as well. "All pupils regardless of their native language must be able to express their thoughts in Hungarian both in spoken and in written form at the end of fourth grade [~ at the age of 10 or 11]"&lt;ref name="Romsics" /&gt;
*1907&amp;nbsp;– The [[Černová massacre]] in present-day northern Slovakia, a controversial event in which 15 people were killed during a clash between a group of gendarmes and local villagers.

==Post-Trianon Hungary==
A considerable number of other nationalities remained within the frontiers of the post-Trianon Hungary:

According to the 1920 census 10.4% of the population spoke one of the minority languages as their mother language:

*551,212 German (6.9%)
*141,882 Slovak (1.8%)
*23,760 Romanian (0.3%)
*36,858 Croatian (0.5%)
*23,228 [[Bunjevac]] and [[Šokci]] (0.3%)
*17,131 Serb (0.2%)

The number of bilingual people was much higher, for example
*1,398,729 people spoke German (17%)
*399,176 people spoke Slovak (5%)
*179,928 people spoke Croatian (2.2%)
*88,828 people spoke Romanian (1.1%).

Hungarian was spoken by 96% of the total population and was the mother language of 89%.

In interwar period, Hungary expanded its university system so the administrators could be produced to carry out the Magyarization of the lost territories for the case they were regained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-7TgkO8utHIC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=treaty+of+trianon+magyarization&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=dQl_TYzfKs3Nsgagraz3Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBw#v=snippet&amp;q=%22lost%20territories%20once%20they%20were%22&amp;f=false |title=Nationalism and territory: constructing group identity in Southeastern Europe – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this period the Roman Catholic clerics dwelled on Magyarization in the school system even more strongly than did the civil service.&lt;ref name=Rothschild/&gt;

The percentage and the absolute number of all non-Hungarian nationalities decreased in the next decades, although the total population of the country increased. Bilingualism was also disappearing. The main reasons of this process were both spontaneous assimilation and the deliberate Magyarization policy of the state.&lt;ref&gt;András Gerő, James Patterson, Enikő Koncz: Modern Hungarian society in the making: the unfinished experience, p. 214, Oxford University Press, US, 1995 [https://books.google.com/books?id=XguLA9wLqloC&amp;pg=PA214&amp;dq=social+life+in+hungary+during+the+dual+monarchy+assimilation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tWVBT4HvE5DRsgaV5eyCBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=assimilated&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Minorities made up 8% of the total population in 1930 and 7% in 1941 (on the post-Trianon territory).

After World War II about [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|200,000 Germans were deported to Germany]] according to the decree of the [[Potsdam Conference]]. Under the [[Czechoslovak-Hungarian population exchange|forced exchange of population between Czechoslovakia and Hungary]], approximately 73,000 Slovaks left Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |title= Mad̕arská otázka v Česko-Slovensku, 1944-1948|trans-title=Hungarian Question in Czechoslovakia|last=Bobák |first=Ján |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1996|publisher= Matica slovenská|language= Slovak |ref=harv|isbn=978-80-7090-354-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After these population movements Hungary became an ethnically almost homogeneous country except the rapidly growing number of [[Romani people]] in the second half of the 20th century.

After the [[First Vienna Award]] which gave [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] to [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Hungary]], a Magyarization campaign was started by the Hungarian government in order to remove Slavic nationalism from Catholic Churches and society. There were reported interferences in the Uzhorod (Ungvár) Greek Catholic seminary, and the Hungarian-language schools excluded all pro-Slavic students.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Lawrence Zugger: [https://books.google.com/books?id=HnUnJ7X10BMC&amp;pg=PA378&amp;dq=%22launched+a+Magyarization+campaign+to+eliminate+Slavic%22&amp;hl=ro&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=f6WxUqXQK4qqhQepu4GoCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22launched%20a%20Magyarization%20campaign%20to%20eliminate%20Slavic%22&amp;f=false ''The Forgotten: Catholics of the Soviet Empire from Lenin Through Stalin''].

"'''Man the Hunter'''" was the name given to a 1966 symposium organized by [[Richard Borshay Lee | Richard Lee]] and [[Irven DeVore]].  The symposium resulted in a book of the same title and attempted to bring together for the first time a comprehensive look at recent ethnographic research on [[hunter-gatherers]].

Eriksen and Nielson (2001, p.82) argue that the symposium was one of the high points of cultural ecology. They report the symposium as concentrating on contemporary hunters and gatherers and noted that the contributors were mostly American cultural anthropologists. The main point of the conference was that given that hunting was humanity's original source of livelihood, any theory of society and the nature of Man would require a deep knowledge of how hunters live. The symposium also emphasised the rivalry between cultural and materialist understanding of culture and society. &lt;ref&gt;Eriksen, Thomas Hylland, and Finn Sivert Nielsen. 2001. A history of anthropology. London: Pluto Press. http://site.ebrary.com/id/10579008. &lt;/ref&gt;

The symposium was held at the Center for Continuing Education, [[University of Chicago]], from April 6th to the 9th, 1966 and was attended by several of the most influential figures in then contemporary anthropology.  In addition to Lee and DeVore, the symposium was attended by [[Marshall Sahlins]], [[Aram Yengoyan]], [[George Peter Murdock]], [[Colin Turnbull]], [[Lewis Binford]], and [[Julian Steward]].

The corresponding book, of papers presented at the symposium, was published by [[Aldine Transaction]] in 1968, under ISBNs 020233032X and 9780202330327.

[[Image:Appia Antica - CeciliaMetella-005.JPG|thumb|300px|An inscription identifying the tomb of [[tomb of Caecilia Metella|Caecilia Metella]], daughter of [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Creticus]] and the wife of [[Marcus Licinius Crassus (quaestor)|Marcus Licinius Crassus]]; it reads ''Caeciliae, Q. Cretici. f., Metellae, Crassi'', "Caecilia, daughter of Quintus Creticus, of the Metellus family and of the Crassus family"]]
'''Naming conventions for [[women in ancient Rome]]''' differed from nomenclature for men, and practice changed dramatically from the [[Roman Republic#Early Republic (458 BC - 274 BC)|Early Republic]] to the [[Roman Empire|High Empire]] and then into [[Late Antiquity]]. Females were identified officially by the [[grammatical gender|feminine]] of the family name ''(nomen gentile'', that is, the ''[[gens]]'' name), which might be further differentiated by the [[Genitive case|genitive form]] of the father's ''[[cognomen]]'', or for a married woman her husband's. Numerical adjectives might distinguish among sisters, such as ''Tertia'', "the Third" (compare [[Suffix (name)#Generational titles|Generational titles in English names]]). By the [[Roman Republic#Late Republic (147 BC - 30 BC)|late Republic]], women also adopted the feminine of their father's ''cognomen''.

A woman kept her own family name after she married, though she might be identified in relation to her husband: the name [[Claudia Pulchra (wife of Metellus)|Clodia Metelli]], "Clodia [wife] of Metellus," preserves the birth name ''Clodia'' &lt;!-- (on the spelling of which see [[Clodius]]) --&gt; and adds her husband's name to specify which Clodia. Children usually took the father's name. In the Imperial period, however, children might sometimes make their mother's family name part of theirs, or even adopt it instead.&lt;ref&gt;Beryl Rawson, "The Roman Family," in ''The Family in Ancient Rome: New Perspectives'' (Cornell University Press, 1986), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early to Middle Republic==
Women in the early to [[Roman Republic#Mid-Republic (274 BC - 148 BC)|mid-Republic]] were usually known by their family name ''(nomen)''. A woman from the ''[[Aemilia (gens)|gens Aemilia]]'' would be called Aemilia; from the ''[[Cornelia (gens)|gens Cornelia]]'', Cornelia; from the ''[[Sempronia (gens)|gens Sempronia]]'', Sempronia; and so on. If there were many daughters, a cognomen such as Tertia (''Third'') could indicate birth order, for example, [[Aemilia Tertia]], the wife of [[Scipio Africanus]]. (She, however, is better known as [[Aemilia Paulla]].) The [[comparative adjective]]s ''Maior'' and ''Minor'', meaning "the Elder" and "the Younger" when attached to a name, might distinguish between two sisters; for example, the daughters of [[Gaius Laelius Sapiens]] are known as Laelia Maior and Laelia Minor.

Birth order is not the best or only predictor of a woman's perceived importance or prominence; [[Cornelia Africana]] most commonly refers to Cornelia Africana Minor, the younger daughter of Scipio Africanus, and not to her elder sister.

Sons, by comparison, were distinguished by a ''[[praenomen]]'', the first or personal name of a Roman male's typical three names ''(tria nomina)''. The eldest son was most often given the same ''praenomen'' as his father, with others given the name of a grandfather or uncle.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Keppie, ''Understanding Roman Inscriptions'' (Routledge, 1991), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition casts doubt on the usage of numerical names: the masculine ''praenomina'' [[Quintus (praenomen)|Quintus]] ("the Fifth"), [[Sextus (praenomen)|Sextus]] ("the Sixth"), and [[Decimus (praenomen)|Decimus]] ("the Tenth") were widely used without reference to birth order, because they were passed on. Thus the semi-legendary [[Claudia Quinta]] should have been the fifth daughter of her [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] father from the ''[[Claudia (gens)|gens Claudia]]'', but it is doubtful that four older sisters existed: ''Quinta'' is probably an archaic feminine ''praenomen'' that later Latin authors treated as a ''cognomen''.&lt;ref&gt;[[T. P. Wiseman]], ''Clio's Cosmetics'' (Bristol Phoenix Press, 2003, originally published 1979), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late Republic==

By the Late Republic, a ''cognomen'', the third of the ''tria nomina'', becomes more important in distinguishing family branches of the main ''gens''. The importance of the ''cognomen'' is reflected also in naming practice as it pertains to women, for example [[Cornelia Sulla]], [[Pompeia Magna]], [[Cornelia Metella]]. Licinia Crassa Maior and Licinia Crassa Minor were daughters of [[Lucius Licinius Crassus]].

==High Empire==
In the era of [[Augustus]] and thereafter, Roman women used more varied first names and sometimes even two first names. Naming practice became less rigid, as is evidenced among women of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]. While Augustus's wives were known by their father's ''gens'' name ([[Claudia Pulchra (wife of Augustus)|Clodia Pulchra]], [[Scribonia]], and [[Livia]]) and Tiberius's wives were known by their fathers' less-known [[gens|gentilical]] names ([[Vipsania Agrippina]] and [[Julia the Elder]]), by the third generation of the Imperial family, naming patterns had changed. Julia's daughters by her second husband [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] were [[Julia the Younger]] and [[Agrippina the Elder]], not Vipsania Tertia and Vipsania Quarta. Likewise, Agrippina the Elder's daughters were [[Agrippina the Younger]], [[Julia Drusilla|Drusilla]], and [[Julia Livilla|Livilla]], and not named for their father's adoptive family, the [[Julia (gens)|''gens'' Julia]]. Likewise, in the family of [[Octavia the Younger]] and [[Mark Antony]], the naming patterns for their daughters ([[Antonia the Elder|Antonia Major]] and [[Antonia Minor]]) and Octavia's by her first husband ([[Claudia Marcella Major]] and [[Claudia Marcella Minor]]) are conventional, but that for their granddaughter [[Livilla]] (daughter of [[Nero Claudius Drusus]]) is not.

In later generations, two names were adopted by females. This meant that [[Claudius]]'s daughters were not Claudia Major and Claudia Minor, but [[Claudia Antonia]] by his marriage to [[Aelia Paetina]] and [[Claudia Octavia]] by his marriage to [[Messalina]]. Among the elite, names such as [[Pomponia Graecina]] became common. In still later generations, women's names bore little or no resemblance to their father's family names. For example, in the Flavian dynasty, [[Titus]]'s daughter was not Flavia. In the Severan dynasty, most women bore the first name of Julia, even if it was not the family's gentilical name, but the second name was different and hence was used to distinguish them. In the Theodosian dynasty, the daughter of [[Theodosius I]] was not Theodosia but [[Galla Placidia]], and named partly for her mother.

* A woman could be named for a grandparent. For example, [[Livilla]], sister of [[Germanicus]] and Claudius, was named for her paternal grandmother [[Livia]].
* A combination of her family name and the name of a mother or grandmother. [[Claudius]]'s first wife [[Plautia Urgulanilla]] was named for her father's family, '''Plautii''', and her paternal grandmother '''[[Urgulania]]''', a close friend of Claudius's own paternal grandmother [[Livia]].
* A woman could also be named for her father's family and a place of origin (somewhat like men, but without a unique [[praenomen]]). For example, in the Robert Graves novel ''[[I, Claudius]]'', Caligula's sister [[Julia Livilla]] is named '''Lesbia''', reflecting her birthplace, [[Lesbos]].
* A woman could be named after other relatives. This naming convention applied to [[Caligula]]'s three sisters. The middle of the three sisters, [[Julia Drusilla]], was named for her paternal grandfather [[Nero Claudius Drusus]], itself a cognomen. The youngest of the three sisters, Julia Livilla, was named for her paternal aunt, [[Livilla]]. The eldest of the three sisters, [[Agrippina the Younger]], was named after [[Agrippina the Elder|her mother]]. Likewise, [[Julia the Younger]], Agrippina's maternal aunt, was also named after [[Julia the Elder|her mother]].

Some empresses were given the ''praenomen'' Julia even if they are unrelated to the ''gens'' Julia.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.forumancientcoins.com/numiswiki/view.asp?key=Julia The Dictionary Of Roman Coins]''&lt;/ref&gt; Some, like [[Livia]] and Agrippina the Younger, were awarded the ''[[agnomen]]'' of ''[[List of Augustae|Augusta]]'' ("Majestic"), a parallel of their husbands' (''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'').

==Late antiquity==
In [[Late Antiquity]], women were frequently named for their mothers or other female relatives, who in turn were often named for female (or sometimes male) Christian saints.  Thus the Empress [[Galla Placidia]]'s name shows only her mother's name, not her father's.  Other examples: Arria was a daughter of Thrasea Paetus and his wife Arria;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''Ann''. 16, 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Younger]], ''[[Epistulae (Pliny)|Ep.]]''. 3, 6, 10; 7, 19, 3&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly Considia, daughter of Servilius Nonianus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|NH]]'' 24, 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Syme; 1964a:412f{{full|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Empresses bearing pagan names—e.g. [[Aelia Eudocia]], formerly [[Athena|Athenaïs]]—were renamed to have more Christian names, sometimes for an earlier empress.  A few empresses such as [[Theodora (6th century)|Theodora]], wife of Justinian, were also allegedly renamed.  Late [[List of Roman and Byzantine Empresses|Byzantine empresses]] bore names derived via Latin from Greek:

* [[Anna (given name)|Anna]] (meaning "grace/charm" or "mercy")
* [[Agnes (name)|Agnes]] ("chaste" or "sacred"), a name of one of the earliest Christian saints, [[Agnes of Rome]]
* [[Irene (given name)|Irene]] ("peace"),
* [[Eudoxia (name)|Eudoxia]] ("good fame")
* [[Euphrosyne (disambiguation)|Euphrosyne]] ("joy")
* [[Theodora (given name)|Theodora]] ("god's gift")
* [[Zoe (name)|Zoe]] ("life")
Most of these names showed Greek influences, while a few were clearly the names of Christian female saints.

==Plot==
While making a pit stop at an interstellar truck stop, [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] buys and eats a decaying [[egg salad]] [[sandwich]] from a [[vending machine]] in the restroom. Upon returning to [[Earth]], Fry and [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] are assigned the task of fixing the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] [[nuclear fusion|fusion boiler]], which promptly explodes. Bender is not damaged, but Fry is impaled by a large pipe. Despite the severity of the injury, Fry's damaged body repairs itself in seconds, and the subsequent medical examination reveals to the crew that Fry is infested with microscopic worms from the egg salad sandwich.

To eliminate the [[infestation]], [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] makes miniature robotic versions of the crew, except for Fry and [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]]. Because the worms know all that Fry knows and would thus defend themselves if Fry knew about the mission, Leela is assigned to distract Fry, who is not told what is happening. Controlling the [[Android (robot)|micro-droids]] using [[virtual reality]] gear, the crew board a miniature Planet Express ship, and enter Fry's ear. Throughout the travel, the crew discover that the worms are drastically improving Fry's intelligence, health, and fitness.

The crew make their way into Fry's bowel, and fight their way to the [[Pelvic splanchnic nerves|pelvic splanchnic ganglion]], intending to cause a massive bowel movement to expel the worm society. Meanwhile, Leela is enchanted by the now intelligent and muscular Fry. Fry reveals that he loves Leela but only recently was he able to articulate his thoughts. Leela realizes that the worms are responsible for the new, improved Fry, and sets out to stop the Professor. Her micro-droid reaches the nerve, and hacks the rest of the micro-droid crew to pieces with an axe. The Professor tells her that the worms will burrow so deep into Fry's body, he will be stuck with them forever, but Leela reasons that Fry is better off with the worms.

Fry is informed of what has been happening, but is more interested in romancing Leela than clearing the worms out of his body. Although the two share a romantic evening at Leela's apartment&amp;mdash;made more powerful when Fry composes Leela a [[sonnet]] on the complex musical instrument the Holophonor&amp;mdash;Leela tells Fry that she loves the new him. Worried, Fry tells her that he needs to find out something, leaves, and, using his own micro-droid, enters his own body.

Fry confronts the worm leader and engages him in a sword fight after asking the worms to leave so he can learn if Leela loves him or just what they have made of him; he eventually coerces the worms into leaving by threatening to kill himself by destroying the [[medulla oblongata]]. With the worms gone, Fry returns to Leela's apartment and explains to her about the worms, and his decision to dispose of them. His awkward attempts at being romantic end when he mentions his previous relationship with [[Amy Wong|Amy]], and Leela kicks him out of her apartment. Back at his apartment, Fry begins to re-learn the Holophonor, and creates a crude image of Leela.

[[Peter Avanzino]], director of the first four broadcast seasons of ''Futurama'' and two of the [[straight-to-DVD]] movies, has stated that episodes with challenging new scenes to draw are his favorites. In particular he notes that he thinks this episode is fun because "It has microscopic characters inside a human body, a 3-D [[colonoscopy]], a sword fight, a holophoner sequence (involving otters and characters dancing on [[Saturn]]'s rings), some sweet sweet lovemaking, and a space-truck stop."&lt;ref name="cinematical"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinematical.com/2007/11/14/interview-futurama-movie-s-producer-s-and-director-s/| title=Interview: 'Futurama' Movie(s) Producer(s) &amp; Director(s)!| author=Scott Weinberg| date= 2007-11-14| accessdate= 2008-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''police procedural''', or '''police crime drama''', is a subgenre of [[detective fiction]] that emphasizes the investigative procedure of a [[police officer]] or department as the [[protagonist]](s), as contrasted with other genres that focus on a private investigator or amateur detective. Unlike traditional mysteries, which conceal the criminal's identity until the police solve the crime in the [[Climax (narrative)|narrative climax]] (the so-called [[whodunnit]]), police procedurals often reveal the perpetrator's identity to the audience early in the narrative, making it an [[inverted detective story]] or "howcatchem" {{citation needed|date=August 2018}}. Police procedurals attempt to accurately depict such police-related topics as [[forensic science]], [[autopsy|autopsies]], gathering [[Evidence (law)|evidence]], [[search warrant]]s, [[interrogation]] and adherence to legal restrictions and procedure.

==Early history==
The roots of the police procedural have been traced to at least the mid-1880's. [[Wilkie Collins]]'s novel ''[[The Moonstone]]'' (1868), a tale of a [[Scotland Yard]] detective investigating the theft of a valuable diamond, has been described as perhaps the earliest clear example of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;Wheat, Carolyn (2003) How to Write Killer Fiction: The Funhouse Of Mystery &amp; The Roller Coaster Of Suspense. Santa Barbara, PA: Perseverance Press, {{ISBN|1880284626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As detective fiction rose to worldwide popularity in the late 1800's and early 1900's, many of the pioneering and most popular characters, at least in the English-speaking world, were private investigators or amateurs. See [[C. Auguste Dupin]], [[Sherlock Holmes]], [[Sam Spade]], [[Miss Marple]] and others. [[Hercule Poirot]] was described as a veteran of the Belgian police but as a protagonist he worked independently. Only after WW2 would police procedural fiction rival the popularity of PIs or amateur sleuths.

[[Lawrence Treat]]'s 1945 novel ''V as in Victim'' is often cited as the first police procedural, by [[Anthony Boucher]] (mystery critic for the ''[[New York Times]] Book Review'') among others. Another early example is [[Hillary Waugh]]'s ''[[Last Seen Wearing ... (Hillary Waugh novel)|Last Seen Wearing ...]]'', 1952.  Even earlier examples from the 20th Century, predating Treat, include the novels ''Vultures in the Dark'', 1925, and ''The Borrowed Shield'', 1925, by [[Richard Enright]], retired [[New York City Police Commissioner]], ''Harness Bull'', 1937, and ''Homicide'', 1937, by former Southern California police officer [[Leslie T. White]], ''P.C. Richardson's First Case'', 1933, by Sir [[Basil Thomson]], former [[Assistant Commissioner]] of [[Scotland Yard]], and the short story collection ''Policeman's Lot'', 1933, by former Buckinghamshire High Sheriff and Justice of the Peace [[Sir Henry Aubrey-Fletcher, 6th Baronet|Henry Wade]].

The procedural became more prominent after [[World War II]], and, while the contributions of [[novelist]]s like Treat were significant, a large part of the impetus for the post-war development of the procedural as a distinct subgenre of the mystery was due, not to prose fiction, but to the popularity of a number of American films which dramatized and fictionalized actual crimes.  Dubbed "[[semidocumentary]] films" by movie critics, these motion pictures, often filmed on location, with the cooperation of the law enforcement agencies involved in the actual case, made a point of authentically depicting police work. Examples include ''[[The Naked City]]'' (1948), ''[[The Street with No Name]]'' (1948), ''[[T-Men]]'' (1947), ''[[He Walked by Night]]'' (1948), and ''[[Border Incident]]'' (1949).

Films from other countries soon began following the semi-documentary trend.  In [[France]], there was ''[[Quai des orfevres]]'' (1947), released in the [[United States]] as ''Jenny Lamour''.  In [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese cinema]], there was [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1949 film ''[[Stray Dog (film)|Stray Dog]]'', a serious police procedural [[film noir]] that was also a precursor to the [[buddy cop film]] genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=FilmInt|journal=Film International|year=2006|volume=4|issue=1–6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y50qAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 April 2012|page=163|publisher=[[Arts Council Norway|Kulturrådet]]|location=Sweden|quote=In addition to being a masterful precursor to the buddy cop movies and police procedurals popular today, Stray Dog is also a complex genre film that examines the plight of soldiers returning home to post-war Japan.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[UK]], there were films such as ''[[The Blue Lamp]]'' (1950) and ''[[The Long Arm (film)|The Long Arm]]'' (1956) set in London and depicting the Metropolitan Police.

One semidocumentary,  ''[[He Walked By Night]]'' (1948), released by [[Eagle-Lion Films]], featured a young radio actor named [[Jack Webb]] in a supporting role.  The success of the film, along with a suggestion from [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] Detective [[Sergeant]] Marty Wynn, the film's [[technical advisor]], gave Webb an idea for a [[radio drama]] that depicted police work in a similarly semi-documentary manner. The resulting series, ''[[Dragnet (drama)|Dragnet]]'', which debuted on radio in 1949 and made the transition to television in 1951, has been called "the most famous procedural of all time" by mystery novelists [[William L. DeAndrea]], [[Katherine V. Forrest]] and [[Max Allan Collins]].

The same year that ''Dragnet'' debuted on radio, [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning playwright [[Sidney Kingsley]]'s stage play ''[[Detective Story (play)|Detective Story]]'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].  This frank, carefully researched dramatization of a typical day in an [[NYPD]] [[police station|precinct]] detective squad became another benchmark in the development of the police procedural.

Over the next few years, the number of novelists who picked up on the procedural trend grew to include writers like Ben Benson, who wrote carefully researched novels about the [[Massachusetts State Police]], retired police officer [[Maurice Procter]], who wrote a series about North England cop Harry Martineau, and Jonathan Craig, who wrote short stories and novels about [[New York City]] police officers.  Police novels by writers who would come to virtually define the form, like [[Hillary Waugh]], [[Evan Hunter|Ed McBain]], and [[John Creasey]] started to appear regularly.

In 1956, in his regular ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' column, mystery critic [[Anthony Boucher]], noting the growing popularity of crime fiction in which the main emphasis was the realistic depiction of police work, suggested that such stories constituted a distinct subgenre of the mystery, and, crediting the success of ''Dragnet'' for the rise of this new form, coined the phrase "police procedural" to describe it.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Written stories==

===Ed McBain===
Ed McBain, the [[pseudonym]] of [[Evan Hunter]], wrote dozens of novels in the ''[[87th Precinct]]'' series beginning with ''[[Cop Hater]],'' published in 1956. Hunter continued to write 87th Precinct novels almost until his death in 2005. Although these novels focus primarily on Detective Steve Carella, they encompass the work of many officers working alone and in teams, and Carella is not always present in any individual book.

As if to illustrate the universality of the police procedural, many of McBain's 87th Precinct novels, despite their being set in a slightly fictionalized New York City, have been filmed in settings outside New York, even outside the US. [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1963 film, ''[[High and Low (1963 film)|High and Low]]'', based on McBain's ''King's Ransom'' (1959), is set in [[Tokyo]].  ''Without Apparent Motive'' (1972), set on the [[French Riviera]], is based on McBain's ''Ten Plus One'' (1963). [[Claude Chabrol]]'s ''[[Blood Relatives|Les Liens de Sang]]'' (1978), based on ''Blood Relatives'' (1974), is set in [[Montreal]].  Even ''[[Fuzz (film)|Fuzz]]'' (1972), based on the 1968 novel, though set in the US, moves the action to [[Boston]].

===John Creasey/J. J. Marric===
Perhaps ranking just behind McBain in importance to the development of the procedural as a distinct mystery subgenre is [[John Creasey]], a prolific writer of many different kinds of crime fiction, from espionage to criminal protagonist. He was inspired to write a more realistic crime novel when his neighbor, a retired [[Scotland Yard]] detective, challenged Creasey to "write about us as we are." The result was ''Inspector West Takes Charge'', 1940, the first of more than forty novels to feature Roger West of the [[London Metropolitan Police]]. The West novels were, for the era, an unusually realistic look at Scotland Yard operations, but the plots were often wildly melodramatic, and, to get around thorny legal problems, Creasey gave West an "amateur detective" friend who was able to perform the extra-procedural acts that West, as a policeman, could not.

In the mid-1950s, inspired by the success of television's ''Dragnet'' and a similar British TV series, ''[[Fabian of the Yard]]'', Creasey decided to try a more down-to-earth series of cop stories. Adopting the pseudonym "J.J. Marric", he wrote ''[[Gideon's Day]]'', 1955, in which [[George Gideon]], a high-ranking detective at Scotland Yard, spends a busy day supervising his subordinates' investigations into several unrelated crimes. This novel was the first in a series of more than twenty books which brought Creasey his best critical notices. One entry, ''Gideon's Fire'', 1961, won an [[Edgar Award]] from the [[Mystery Writers of America]] for Best Mystery Novel. The Gideon series, more than any other source, helped establish the common procedural plot structure of threading several autonomous story lines through a single novel.

===Sjöwall and Wahlöö===
[[Maj Sjöwall]] and [[Per Wahlöö]] planned and wrote the [[Martin Beck]] police procedural series of ten books between the 1960s and 1970s, set in [[Sweden]]. The series is particularly renowned for its extensive character development throughout the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Scene of the Crime: The Importance of Place in Crime and Mystery Fiction|last = Geherin|first = David|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beck himself is gradually promoted from [[detective]] in a newly nationalised Swedish police force to [[Chief of staff|Chief]] [[Inspector]] of the National Murder Squad, and the realistic depiction, as well as criticism of the Swedish [[welfare state]] at the time whilst the tedium of the police procedural continues in the background, is something still widely used today, with authors such as [[Jo Nesbø]] and [[Stieg Larsson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gumshoes: A Dictionary of Fictional Detectives|last = Brunsdale|first = Mitzi|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 62}}&lt;/ref&gt; The books gave rise to the [[Scandinavian noir|Swedish noir]] scene, and ''[[The Laughing Policeman (novel)|The Laughing Policeman]]'' earned a "Best Novel" Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America in 1971. The books were translated from Swedish into 35 different languages, and have sold roughly ten million copies. Sjöwall and Wahlöö used [[Black comedy|black humour]] extensively in the series,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.crimefictionlover.com/2014/09/cis-a-guide-to-the-martin-beck-series/|title = CIS: A GUIDE TO THE MARTIN BECK SERIES|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Megraw|first = Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is widely recognised as one of the finest police procedural series.

===Elizabeth Linington/Dell Shannon/Lesley Egan===
A prolific author of police procedurals, whose work has fallen out of fashion in the years since her death, is [[Elizabeth Linington]] writing under her own name, as well as "Dell Shannon" and "Lesley Egan." Linington reserved her Dell Shannon pseudonym primarily for procedurals featuring LAPD Central [[Homicide]] [[Lieutenant]] Luis Mendoza (1960–86). Under her own name she wrote about Sergeant Ivor Maddox of LAPD's North Hollywood Station, and as Lesley Egan she wrote about suburban cop Vic Varallo. These novels are often considered severely flawed, partly due to the author's far-right political viewpoint (she was a proud member of the [[John Birch Society]]), but primarily because Miss Linington's books, notwithstanding the frequent comments she made about the depth of her research, were all seriously deficient in the single element most identified with the police procedural, technical accuracy. However, they have a certain charm in their depiction of a kinder, gentler California, where the police were always "good guys" who solved all the crimes and respected the citizenry.

===Georges Simenon===
It has been suggested{{by whom|date=January 2017}} that the ''[[Inspector Maigret]]'' novels of [[Georges Simenon]] aren't really procedurals because of their strong focus on the lead character, but the novels have always included subordinate members of his staff as supporting characters. More importantly, Simenon, who had been a journalist covering police investigations before creating Maigret, was giving an accurate depiction, or at least the appearance of an accurate depiction, of law enforcement in Paris. Further, Simenon's influence on later European procedural writers, like [[Sweden]]'s [[Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö]], or [[A. C. Baantjer|Baantjer]], is obvious.

===Joseph Wambaugh===
Though not the first police officer to write procedurals, [[Joseph Wambaugh]]'s success has caused him to become the exemplar of cops who turn their professional experiences into fiction.  The son of a [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], policeman, Wambaugh joined the Los Angeles Police Department after a stint of military duty.  In 1970, his first novel, ''[[The New Centurions]]'', was published.  This followed three police officers through their training in the Academy, their first few years on the street, culminating in the Watts riots of 1965.  It was followed by such novels as ''The Blue Knight'', 1971, ''[[The Choirboys (book)|The Choirboys]]'', 1975, ''Hollywood Station'', 2006, and acclaimed non-fiction books like ''[[The Onion Field]]'', 1973, ''Lines and Shadows'', 1984, and ''Fire Lover'', 2002.  Wambaugh has said that his main purpose is less to show how cops work on the job, than how the job works on cops.

===Tony Hillerman===
[[Tony Hillerman]], the author of 17 novels involving Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn, wrote procedurals in which the procedures were those of the [[Navajo Tribal Police]].

===Detective novel writers===
It is difficult to disentangle the early roots of the procedural from its forebear, the traditional detective novel, which often featured a police officer as protagonist. By and large, the better known novelists such as [[Ngaio Marsh]] produced work that falls more squarely into the province of the traditional or "cozy" detective novel. Nevertheless, some of the work of authors less well known today, like [[Freeman Wills Crofts]]'s novels about Inspector French or some of the work of the prolific team of [[G. D. H. Cole|G.D.H.]] and [[Margaret Cole]], might be considered as the antecedents of today's police procedural.  British mystery novelist and critic [[Julian Symons]], in his 1972 history of crime fiction, ''Bloody Murder'', labeled these proto-procedurals "humdrums," because of their emphasis on the plodding nature of the investigators.

===TV series===
{{Main|List of police television dramas}}

====United States====
* ''[[Dragnet (series)#Television|Dragnet]]'' (1951–59, 1967–70, 1989–91 and 2003–04) was a pioneering police procedural that began on radio in 1949 and then on television in 1951. ''Dragnet'' established the tone of many police dramas in subsequent decades, and the rigorously authentic depictions of such elements as organizational structure, professional jargon, legal issues, etc., set the standard for technical accuracy that became the most identifiable element of the police procedural in all media.  The show was occasionally accused of presenting an overly idealized portrait of law enforcement in which the police (represented by Sgt. [[Joe Friday]]) were invariably presented as "good guys" and the criminals as "bad guys", with little moral flexibility or complexity between the two. However, many episodes depicted sympathetic perpetrators while others depicted unsympathetic or corrupt cops.  Further, though Jack Webb may have seemed to go to extremes to depict the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] in a favorable light, most depictions of cops at the time of ''Dragnet'''s debut were both unsympathetic and unrealistic.  Webb's depiction was meant to offer balance.  Also, the show benefited from the unprecedented technical advice, involvement, and support of the LAPD, a first in TV, which may also have been an incentive to depict the Department favorably.  After the success of ''Dragnet'', Webb produced other procedural shows like ''[[The DA's Man]]'', about an undercover investigator for the [[New York County District Attorney|Manhattan District Attorney]]'s Office, ''[[Adam-12]]'', about a pair of uniformed [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officers patrolling their beat in a radio car, and ''[[O'Hara, U.S. Treasury]]'', with [[David Janssen]] as a trouble-shooting federal officer.
* ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'' (1959–63)  fictionalized real-life Federal Agent [[Eliot Ness]]'s ongoing fight with prohibition-era gangs in [[Chicago]] and elsewhere.  Originally a two-part presentation on the anthology series ''[[Desilu Playhouse]]'', it made such a splash that a series was launched the following fall.  That two-part pilot, later released to theaters under the title ''The Scarface Mob'', stuck comparatively close to the actual events, with Ness, as played by [[Robert Stack]], recruiting a team of incorruptible investigators to help bring down [[Al Capone]]. Later episodes showed Ness and his squad, after Capone, going after just about every big name gangster of the era, and when the writers ran out of real-life figures to pit against Ness, they created new ones. [[Quinn Martin]], who would become closely associated with police and crime shows like this, produced the series during its first season, leaving to found his own company, QM Productions, which would go one to produce police procedural shows like ''[[The New Breed (TV series)|The New Breed]]'', ''[[The F.B.I. (TV series)|The F.B.I.]]'', ''[[Dan August]]'', and ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]'' over the next twenty years.  The success of the series led to an [[Academy Award]]-winning [[The Untouchables (1987 film)|motion picture]] in 1987, and a new TV [[The Untouchables (1993 TV series)|series]] that was syndicated to local stations in 1993.
* ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'' (1973–78) was an anthology series set in Los Angeles created by [[LAPD]] Detective Sergeant Joseph Wambaugh.  Hard-hitting and unflinchingly realistic, its anthology format made it possible to look at LAPD police work from many different perspectives, what it was like to be a woman in a male-dominated profession, an honest cop suspected of corruption, a rookie cop, an undercover narc, a veteran facing retirement, or a cop who had to adjust to crippling injuries incurred in the line of duty.  Despite its anthology format, there were a number of characters who appeared in more than one episode, including Robbery/Homicide partners Tony Calabrese ([[Tony Lo Bianco]]) and Bert Jameson ([[Don Meredith]]), vice cop turned homicide detective Charlie Czonka ([[James Farentino]]), and stakeout-surveillance specialist Joe LaFrieda ([[Vic Morrow]]).  Several series were spun off from the show, including ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]'', ''Joe Forrester'', and ''[[David Cassidy: Man Under Cover|Man Undercover]]''.  During its last two seasons, the show appeared as an irregular series of two-hour [[TV movies]] rather than a weekly one-hour program.  The show was revived for a season in 1988, using old scripts reshot with new casts when a writers' strike made new material inaccessible.
* ''[[Kojak]]'' (1973–78, 1989–90) created by [[Abby Mann]], focused on a veteran [[New York City]] detective-lieutenant played by [[Telly Savalas]].  Its exteriors were filmed at New York's Ninth Precinct, the same place where ''[[NYPD Blue]]'''s exteriors would be filmed.  In 1989 Savalas returned to the role briefly for five two-hour episodes, in which Kojak had been promoted to [[inspector]] and placed in charge of the Major Crimes Squad. It rotated with three other detective shows on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].  A 2005 remake for the [[USA Network]] starred [[Ving Rhames]]. Kojak's most memorable character trait was his signature lollipop.
* ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'' (1981–87) featured a number of intertwined storylines in each episode, and pioneered depiction of the conflicts between the work and private lives of officers and detectives on which the police procedural was centered.  The show had a deliberate "documentary" style, depicting officers who were flawed and human, and dealt openly with the gray areas of morality between right and wrong.  It was set in an unidentified east coast or Midwestern US city.  The show was written by [[Steven Bochco]] and Michael Kozoll.
* ''[[Cagney and Lacey]]'' (1982–88) revolved around two female NYPD detectives who led very different lives. Christine Cagney, played by [[Sharon Gless]], was a single-minded, witty, brash career woman. Mary Beth Lacey was a resourceful, sensitive working mom. [[Loretta Swit]] was the original choice for Cagney [she played the role in a TV movie] however she couldn't get out of her contract on ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]''. During the first season, [[Meg Foster]] played the part of Cagney, while [[Tyne Daly]] played Lacey, the role she had originated in the pilot. [[CBS]] canceled the series claiming low ratings. It was brought back due both to a letter-writing campaign which drew millions of letters nationwide and because the ratings went ''up'' during summer reruns. A ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine read "Welcome Back". Daly continued as Lacey, but Foster was replaced with Gless, who would become the actress most identified with the part. It had 36 nominations and 14 wins during its run.  Four TV movies were broadcast after the series ended.
* ''[[Miami Vice]]'' (1984–90) and ''[[21 Jump Street]]'' (1987–91) showed the MTV style of Police procedurals.
* The [[Law &amp; Order (franchise)|''Law &amp; Order'' franchise]], which started with the long-running series ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' (1990–2010), focuses on the two 'halves' of a criminal proceeding in the [[New York City]] criminal justice system: the investigation of the crime by the [[New York City Police Department]] homicide detectives and the subsequent prosecution of the criminals by the [[New York County District Attorney]]'s office. The success of the original ''Law &amp; Order'' inspired nine other [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series in four different countries:
** Five in the U.S.: ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' (1999–present), which focuses on sex crimes such as rape and child molestation, ''[[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent]]'' (2001–11), focusing on major crimes from the point of view of the criminal and capturing them from a psychological side, ''[[Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury]]'' (2005–06), which focuses more on the trial from both the prosecution and the defense teams' points of view, ''[[Conviction (2006 TV series)|Conviction]]'' (2006) and ''[[Law &amp; Order: LA]]'' (2010–11). ''Special Victims Unit'', ''Criminal Intent'', and ''LA'' series focused more on the police procedurals than ''Trial by Jury'' and ''Conviction''.  As of August 2011, ''Special Victims Unit'' is the only currently running American series in the ''Law &amp; Order'' franchise.
** Two in [[Russia]]: Adaptations of ''Special Victims Unit'' (2007) and ''Criminal Intent'' (2007), both set in [[Moscow]].
** ''[[Paris enquêtes criminelles]]'' (2007), a [[France|French]] adaptation of ''Criminal Intent'' set in [[Paris]].
** ''[[Law &amp; Order: UK]]'' (2009–2014), a [[United Kingdom|British]] adaptation of the original ''Law &amp; Order'' set in [[London]].
:Aside from being its depiction of police investigation, this program also relates to the [[legal drama]] and "forensic pathology" subgenres, and has inspired such other programs as the ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' [[CSI (franchise)|series]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}
* ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'' (1993–99; TV movie in 2000), a police procedural focusing on the homicide unit of the [[Baltimore]] city police department. Critically praised{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} (although frequently struggling in the ratings), the show was more of an ensemble piece, focusing on the activities of the unit as a whole (although significant characters such as Detective [[Frank Pembleton]] and Detective [[John Munch]], who has also appeared on the various ''Law &amp; Order'' shows, among others, became popular with viewers). The show (particularly in its first three seasons) used long-form arcs to depict ongoing criminal investigations, such as the investigation of a murdered child in the first season, which ran through 13 episodes but ended without an arrest or conviction, or even conclusive proof of who committed the crime. The show also heavily featured the complex internal politics of the police department, suggesting that rising through the ranks has more to do with personal connections, favors and opportunism than genuine ability.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}
* ''[[NYPD Blue]]'' (1993–2005) explored the internal and external struggles of the assorted investigators of the fictional 15th Precinct of Manhattan.  The show gained notoriety for profanity and nudity never previously broadcast on American network television. ''NYPD Blue'' was created by genre veteran [[Steven Bochco]] and [[David Milch]]. The cast of ''NYPD Blue'' included actor Dennis Franz, who previously played Detective Buntz on ''Hill Street Blues'', as well as on a spin-off series, ''Beverly Hills Buntz''. Another cast member, David Caruso, would later play Lt. Horatio Caine on ''CSI: Miami''.
* The [[CSI (franchise)|CSI franchise]] which started with ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' (2000–2015) and eventually spawned two  spin-offs focused on solving ordinary crimes using forensics, ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' (2002-2012) and ''[[CSI: NY]]'' (2004-2013).  Produced by [[Jerry Bruckheimer]], these three shows focus on three groups of forensic scientists in [[Las Vegas]], [[Miami]] and [[New York City]] who investigate how and why a person has died and if it is a murder or not by investigating not only [[whodunit]] but also howdunit. A third spin-off, ''[[CSI: Cyber]]'' (2015-2016), focused on cybercrime and its impact on modern society.
** The CSI franchise inspired other forensic shows such as ''[[Body of Proof]]'' (2011–2013), ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'' (2005-2017) and ''[[Crossing Jordan]]'' (2001–2007).
** The CSI franchise also inspired other crime dramas involving teams solving crimes but not relying on forensics; these include victim and witness memory for cold cases and missing people in ''[[Cold Case (TV series)|Cold Case]]'' (2003–2010) and ''[[Without a Trace]]'' (2002-2009) respectively, psychological profiling in ''[[Criminal Minds]]'' (2005-), using [[mathematics]] in ''[[Numbers (TV series)|Numbers]]'' (2005-2010) and using deception in ''[[The Mentalist]]'' (2008–2015).
* ''[[The Shield]]'' (2002–08) is about an experimental division of the Los Angeles Police Department set up in the fictional Farmington district ("the Farm") of Los Angeles, using a converted church ("the Barn") as their police station, and featuring a group of detectives called "The Strike Team", who will do anything to bring justice to the streets. Michael Chiklis (Chiklis previously played the title character in the TV series ''The Commish'') has top billing with his portrayal of Strike Team leader Detective Victor "Vic" Mackey. The show has an ensemble cast that will normally run a number of separate story lines through each episode. It was on the [[FX network]] and was known for its portrayal of police brutality and its realism. The show inspired other shows similar to ''The Shield'' such as ''[[Dark Blue (TV series)|Dark Blue]]'' and ''[[Southland (TV series)|Southland]]''. ''The Shield'' was created by writer/producer [[Shawn Ryan]].
* The ''[[NCIS (franchise)|NCIS]]'' franchise was spun off from the CBS series ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]'' in 2003. The original series, ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' (2003-present) follows the Major Case Response Team of the [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]], as they investigate crimes related to the [[US Navy]] and [[Marine Corps]]. ''NCIS'' has been among the top scripted series on U.S. television, and has received two spin-offs; ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]'' (2009-) deals with an LA-based branch dealing in special undercover assignments, and ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]'' (2014-) focuses on a small group of agents who handle cases from the Mississippi River to the Texas Panhandle.
* ''[[Castle (TV series)|Castle]]'' (2009-2016), ''[[The Mentalist]]'' (2008-2015), ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'' (2002–2009) and ''[[Psych]]'' (2006-2014) feature quirky investigators with their own distinct methods of solving crimes and are equally comedic shows as they are police procedurals.
* [[Chicago (franchise)|''Chicago'']] is a multi-genre franchise that focuses on the [[Chicago]] [[Chicago P.D. (TV series)|Police Department]], the [[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Fire Department]] and the [[Chicago Med|Medical branch]] respectively.

====India====
* ''[[C.I.D. (India TV series)|C.I.D.]]'' (1995–present) C.I.D. is an Indian crime detective series that airs on Sony TV. It is about a team of detectives belonging to the Criminal Investigation Department in Mumbai. The protagonists of the show are played by [[Shivaji Satam]], [[Aditya Srivastava]], [[Dayanand Shetty]], [[Dinesh Phadnis]], [[Hrishikesh Pandey]], [[Vivek Mashru]], [[Jasveer Kaur]], [[Ansha Saeed]].The forensic experts are played by [[Narendra Gupta]] and [[Shraddha Musale]] respectively.

====Austria====
* ''[[Inspector Rex]]'' (1994–2003) was an Austrian homicide detective series, whiched aired all over the world and was (and still is) incredibly popular in Australia when broadcast on [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]]. It is about a German Shepherd police dog named Rex and his owner, Detective-Inspector Richard Moser of the Vienna Kriminalpolizei. Rex was a bomb squad dog whose handler was killed at a crime scene that Moser was investigating. Moser's team consisted of Ernst Stockinger (seasons 1 and 2), and Peter Hollerer (seasons 1 to 4), and Christian Bock (seasons 3 to 6). Dr Leo Graf served as forensic pathalogist/coroner throughout the whole series, who often described autopsy scenes &amp; procedures much to the disgust of the police staff. Moser was murdered by a psychotic serial killer halfway through season 4. New detective inspector Alexander Brandtner took over Moser's role after Moser's untimely death. 
Rex frequently saved the team's necks during pursuits and catching criminals, sniffing out clues, rescuing child victims, as well as occasionally being a nuisance around the office or while interviewing suspects.
The show mixes series themes with occasional comedy, such as Rex's penchant for [[ham rolls]] (wurstsemmeln), demanding to buy many dog toys, and interfering with Moser's &amp; Brandtner's erratic love lives.

====United Kingdom====
* ''[[Fabian of the Yard]]'', (1954–55) – possibly the first police drama to be made for British TV, this series, based on the memoirs of real-life Scotland Yard detective Robert Fabian, had a lot in common with ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''.  Just as ''Dragnet'' had been the first network drama series with continuing characters to be shot on film, so ''Fabian of the Yard'' was one of the first British series to be filmed.  Both shows featured voice-over narration by the main character; both fictionalized stories derived from real-life cases; and both ended with an epilogue that revealed the ultimate fate of the criminals.  On ''Fabian'', this took the form of a medium-shot of Bruce Seton, who played Fabian in the series, seated at a desk.  The shot slowly dissolved into one of the real-life Fabian in the same pose at the same desk.  At that point, the actual Fabian stood up and told the audience what happened to the criminal he'd caught in the real-life case that had just been dramatized.
* ''[[Dixon of Dock Green]]'', (1955–76) – [[Jack Warner (actor)|Jack Warner]] reprised the role of [[Constable]] George Dixon, the uniformed beat cop he had played in ''[[The Blue Lamp]]'', despite the fact that the Dixon character had been tragically murdered in that film.  During the course of this somewhat gentle series, Warner's character became, for many, the living embodiment of what every British "bobby" was supposed to be.  As the series progressed, Dixon went through several promotions, eventually winding up as the [[Station Sergeant]] at his local division.  By the final season, with Warner now over 80, Dixon retired and the focus shifted to the younger officers he'd trained up over the years.
* ''[[No Hiding Place]]'', (1957–67) – Produced with the cooperation of Scotland Yard, this long-running series featured Raymond Francis as high-ranking Met detective Tom Lockhart.  During its run, the series went through several title changes.  When it began in 1957, it was known as ''Murder Bag'', referring to the [[murder bag|bag of investigative tools]] that [[Superintendent (police)|Superintendent]] Lockhart carried with him whenever he was called to a case.  In 1959, with Lockhart promoted to [[Chief Superintendent]], it became ''Crime Sheet''.  Later in 1959, the series was given its final and best-remembered title, ''No Hiding Place'', which lasted until the series ended in 1967.
* ''[[Z-Cars]]'', (1962–78) – a police drama about two teams of uniformed constables ([[Brian Blessed]], [[Joseph Brady (actor)|Joseph Brady]], [[James Ellis (actor)|James Ellis]], and [[Jeremy Kemp]]) assigned to "Crime Patrol" duties in a pair of powerful [[Ford Zephyr]]s, under the supervision of Detective Sergeant John Watt ([[Frank Windsor]]) and Detective [[Chief Inspector]] Charlie Barlow ([[Stratford Johns]]).  A franker, and often less flattering portrait of police work than audience were used to seeing on ''Dixon of Dock Green'', the show was an immediate hit, its popularity generating spin-offs like ''[[Softly, Softly (TV series)|Softly, Softly]]'' (1966–76), ''[[Barlow at Large]]'' (1971–75), and ''[[Second Verdict]]'' (1976).
* ''[[Gideon's Way]]'', (1965–66) – a crime series produced during 1964/65 and based on the novels by [[John Creasey]] (as J. J. Marric). The series was made at Elstree in twin production with [[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]] TV series. It starred Liverpudlian [[John Gregson]] in the title role as Commander George [[Gideon of Scotland Yard]], with [[Alexander Davion]] as his assistant, Detective Chief Inspector David Keen, [[Reginald Jessup]] as Det. Superintendent LeMaitre (nicknamed Lemmy), [[Ian Rossiter]] as Detective Chief Superintendent Joe Bell and [[Basil Dignam]] as Commissioner Scott-Marle.
* ''[[New Scotland Yard (TV series)|New Scotland Yard]]'', (1972–74) – a police drama series produced by [[London Weekend Television]] (LWT) for the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network between 1972 and 1974. It features the activities of two officers from the [[Criminal Investigations Department]] (CID) in the [[Metropolitan Police]] force headquarters at [[New Scotland Yard]], as they dealt with the assorted villains of the day.
* ''[[The Sweeney]]'', (1975–78) – a drama series focusing on the [[Flying Squad]] of the [[Metropolitan Police]] and their twenty-four-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week job of catching some of the most dangerous and violent criminals in London. The [[television program]] featured [[Detective Inspector]] Jack Regan ([[John Thaw]]) and other tough-talking hard-drinking members of his elite unit, both on and off duty. With its high level of violence, location filming, bold frankness, and well written scripts, ''The Sweeney'' revolutionized the genre.  The series was so phenomenally popular that two feature-length movies, ''Sweeney!'' (1976) and ''Sweeney 2'' (1978) were released to theatres during the show's original broadcast run.
*''[[The Gentle Touch]]'', (1980–84) – a British police drama television series made by London Weekend Television for ITV. Commencing transmission on 11 April 1980, the series is notable for being the first British series to feature a female police detective as its leading character, ahead of the similarly themed BBC series Juliet Bravo by four months.
*''[[Juliet Bravo]]'', (1980–85) – a British television series, which ran on BBC1. The theme of the series concerned a female police inspector who took over control of a police station in the fictional town of Hartley in Lancashire.
* ''[[Taggart]]'' (1983–2010)
* ''[[The Bill]]'', (1984–2010) – a drama series focusing on both the uniformed and plain-clothes police officers working out of a fictional inner-London police station. The original conception of this series was as purely procedural, with an almost fly-on-the-wall approach that survived to an extent throughout.
* The ''[[Prime Suspect (UK TV series)|Prime Suspect]]'' series, (1991–2006) – featuring [[Helen Mirren]] as Detective Chief Inspector (later Chief Superintendent) Jane Tennison, which focused on the police investigations and on Tennison's conflicts with her fellow officers as a prominent female detective in a heavily male-dominated work environment, as well as her personal problems concerning her family and after-work life.
* ''[[Cracker (UK TV series)|Cracker]]'' (1993–95) - hard-hitting drama series following dysfunctional  criminal psychologist Dr Edward "Fitz" Fitzgerald, played by [[Robbie Coltrane]]

==Comic strips and books==
The [[comic strip]] ''[[Dick Tracy]]'' is often pointed to as an early procedural. Indeed, in his introduction to a 1970 collection of ''Tracy'' strips entitled ''The Celebrated Cases of Dick Tracy'', no less an authority than [[Ellery Queen]] suggested that Tracy, predating Webb, Treat, Creasey, and McBain, was the first "truly" procedural policeman in any fictional medium.

Certainly ''Tracy'' creator [[Chester Gould]] seemed to be trying to reflect the real world. Tracy himself, conceived by Gould as a "modern-day [[Sherlock Holmes]]", was partly modeled on real-life law enforcer Eliot Ness, and his first, and most frequently recurring, antagonist, the [[Alphonse "Big Boy" Caprice|Big Boy]], was based on Ness's real-life nemesis Al Capone. Other members of Tracy's [[Recurring characters in Dick Tracy|Rogues Gallery]], like Boris Arson, [[Flattop Jones]], and Maw Famon, were inspired, respectively, by [[John Dillinger]], [[Charles "Pretty Boy" Floyd]], and [[Ma Barker|Kate "Ma" Barker]].

More to the point, Gould was making a genuine attempt to portray police work realistically.  Once ''Tracy'' was sold to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' syndicate, Gould enrolled in a criminology class at [[Northwestern University]], met with members of the [[Chicago Police Department]], and did research at the Department's crime lab, to make his depiction of law enforcement more authentic.  Ultimately, he hired retired [[Chicago]] policeman Al Valanis, a pioneering forensic sketch artist, as both an artistic assistant and police technical advisor.

Later stories, in which Gould veered into [[space opera]] and extraterrestrial contacts, mitigated somewhat against the strip's being recognized for its early use of realistic police procedure, but any examination of the ''Tracy'' strip from its beginnings in 1931 through the 1950s makes Gould's status as a pioneer in the police procedural subgenre clear.

The success of ''Tracy'' led to many more police strips.  While some, like Norman Marsh's ''[[Dan Dunn]]'' were unabashedly slavish imitations of ''Tracy'', others, like [[Dashiell Hammett]]'s and [[Alex Raymond]]'s ''[[Secret Agent X-9]]'', took a more original approach.  Still others, like Eddie Sullivan's and Charlie Schmidt's ''[[Radio Patrol]]'' and Will Gould's ''Red Barry'', steered a middle course. One of the best post-''Tracy'' procedural comics was ''[[Kerry Drake]]'', written and created by Allen Saunders and illustrated by [[Alfred Andriola]]. It diverged from the metropolitan settings used in ''Tracy'' to tell the story of the titular Chief Investigator for the District Attorney of a small-town jurisdiction. Later, following a personal tragedy, he leaves the DA's Office and joins his small city's police force in order to fight crime closer to the grass roots level.  As both a DA's man and a city cop, he fights a string of flamboyant, Gould-ian criminals like "Stitches", "Bottleneck", and "Bulldozer."

Other syndicated police strips include [[Zane Grey]]'s ''[[King of the Royal Mounted]]'', depicting police work in the contemporary Canadian Northwest, Lank Leonard's ''[[Mickey Finn (comics)|Mickey Finn]]'', which emphasized the home life of a hard-working cop, and ''Dragnet'', which adapted stories from the pioneering radio-TV series into comics. Early [[comic books]] with police themes tended to be reprints of syndicated newspaper strips like ''Tracy'' and ''Drake''.  Others adapted police stories from other mediums, like the radio-inspired anthology comic ''[[Gang Busters]]'', Dell's ''87th Precinct'' issues, which adapted McBain's novels, or ''The Untouchables'', which adapted the fictionalized TV adventures of real-life policeman Eliot Ness.

More recently, there have been attempts to depict police work with the kind of hard-edged realism seen in the novels of writers like Wambaugh, such as [[Marvel Comics|Marvel's]] four-issue mini-series ''Cops:  The Job'', in which a rookie police officer learns to cope with the physical, emotional, and mental stresses of law enforcement during her first patrol assignment. With [[superhero]]es having long dominated the comic book market, there have been some recent attempts to integrate elements of the police procedural into the universe of costumed crime-fighters.  ''[[Gotham Central]]'', for example, depicts a group of police detectives operating in [[Batman]]'s [[Gotham City]], and suggested that the caped crime-fighter is disliked by many Gotham detectives for treading on their toes. Meanwhile, ''[[Metropolis SCU]]'' tells the story of the Special Crimes Unit, an elite squad of cops in the police force serving [[Superman]]'s [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]].

The use of police procedural elements in superhero comics can partly be attributed to the success of [[Kurt Busiek]]'s groundbreaking 1994 series ''[[Marvels]]'', and his subsequent ''[[Astro City]]'' work, both of which examine the typical superhero universe from the viewpoint of the common man who witnesses the great dramas from afar, participating in them tangentially at best.

In the wake of Busiek's success, many other writers mimicked his approach, with mixed results&amp;nbsp;– the narrative possibilities of someone who does not get involved in drama are limited. In 2000, however, [[Image Comics]] published the first issue of [[Brian Michael Bendis]]'s comic ''[[Powers (comics)|Powers]]'', which followed the lives of homicide detectives as they investigated superhero-related cases. Bendis's success has led both Marvel Comics and [[DC Comics]] to begin their own superhero-themed police procedurals (''[[District X]]'' and the aforementioned ''Gotham Central''), which focus on how the job of a police officer is affected by such tropes as secret identities, superhuman abilities, costumes, and the near-constant presence of [[vigilante]]s.

While the detectives in ''Powers'' were "normal" (unpowered) humans dealing with super-powered crime, [[Alan Moore]] and [[Gene Ha]]'s ''[[Top 10 (comics)|Top 10]]'' mini-series, published by [[America's Best Comics]] in 2000–01, centered around the super-powered police force in a setting where powers are omnipresent. The comic detailed the lives and work of the police force of Neopolis, a city in which everyone, from the police and criminals to civilians, children and even pets, has super-powers, colourful costumes and secret identities.

In analysis of works of fiction, '''revisionism''' denotes the retelling of a conventional or established narrative with significant variations which deliberately "revise" the view shown in the original work.  For example, the film ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' may be regarded as a revisionist [[Western (genre)|western]] because it portrays [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] sympathetically instead of as the [[Barbarian|savages]] of traditional westerns. 
Many original works of [[fantasy]] appear to retell [[fairy tale]]s in a revisionist manner.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Revisionist Fantasy", p. 810. {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The genre of "Arthurian literature" includes innumerable variations from themes of the classic tales of [[King Arthur]]. It is debatable whether any particular examples set out to create a revised view.

==Synopsis==
Do Bong-soon ([[Park Bo-young]]) was born with superhuman strength. Her strength is hereditary and passed along only to the women in her family. Her dream is to create a video game with herself as the main character. She desperately wants to become a willowy and elegant woman, which is the ideal type of her crush, In Guk-doo ([[Ji Soo]]), a police officer. Thanks to her strength, she gets the job of a bodyguard to a rich heir Ahn Min-hyuk ([[Park Hyung-sik]]), the CEO of a gaming company, Ainsoft. Contrary to Guk-doo, Min-hyuk is an odd man who is playful, a little spoiled, has no regard for rules, and dislikes policemen. He has recently received anonymous threats, blackmails, and has even been stalked at an occasion.

One day, a series of kidnapping cases break in Dobong-dong, the district Bong-soon lives in, and she is determined to catch the culprit after her friend was targeted. With the help and training from Min-hyuk, she manages to control her strength to use it for good causes. Min-hyuk and Bong-soon find themselves and their relationship grew into something more.

'''The Chelsea Cobbler''' (also sometimes '''Chelsea Cobbler''') is a British shoe brand that was established in the 1960s in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]].

Originally a high-fashion brand creating bespoke (made-to-measure) shoes, it was regularly featured in catwalk shows and the fashion press throughout the 1970s, when it also had a retail presence in New York City. It was twice chosen as part of the [[Dress of the Year]] ensemble displayed at the [[Fashion Museum, Bath]].

Later the brand was absorbed into larger fashion companies. It was relaunched in 2009.

==Brand establishment==
The Chelsea Cobbler's first store opened in April 1967 in Draycott Avenue, Chelsea. The founders were Richard Smith (also the shoe designer), Amanda Wilkins and George Macfarlane.&lt;ref name="The Times 57236"&gt;{{cite news|last1=King-Deacon|first1=Antony|title=Men's fashion by Antony King-Deacon|issue=57236|work=The Times|date=26 April 1968|ref=pg.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[The Times]]'' in 1968, Antony King-Deacon said the brand's shoes cost from 9 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] and the founders were: "trying to get the public to accept well-made, rather expensive shoes". King-Deacon's comments were within an article bemoaning the poor quality of mass shoe production and describing the re-emergence of small and bespoke designers.&lt;ref name="The Times 57236"/&gt; This was in an era when the UK shoe market was dominated by lower-priced brands within the [[Sears|British Shoe Corporation]]; its stores accounted for an estimated 25 to 30 per cent of retail shoe sales in the UK at the end of the 1960s.&lt;ref name="The Times 57715"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lumsden|first1=Andrew|title=Which path for shoemakers?|issue=57715|work=The Times|date=12 November 1969|ref=pg.27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The factory which was in Mornington Crescent was run by Spiros Mina and Antony Achilleos. Arty Achilleos was an apprentice here.He later started his own business Baboucha.

A year later, [[Prudence Glynn]] featured The Chelsea Cobbler, alongside [[Rayne (shoe company)|Rayne]], [[Moya Bowler]], [[Ravel (shoe company)|Ravel]] and [[Bruno Magli|Magli]] in an article about London's best specialist shoe shops. By this stage, the brand also had a shoe shop in [[Sackville Street, London|Sackville Street]] in the [[West End of London|West End]].&lt;ref name="The Times 57636"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Glynn|first1=Prudence|title=That's shoe business|issue=57636|work=The Times|date=12 August 1969|ref=pg.11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1969, Richard Smith of Chelsea Cobbler and Glen Carr of Norvic were chosen to show off the versatility of a new leather substitute created by British company [[Chloride Electrical Storage Company]] and known as Porvair. Smith's shoes were worn with men's clothing created by hip womenswear designer [[Clive Evans (fashion designer)|Clive Evans]] at the launch event.&lt;ref name="The Times 57699"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Deacon-Smith|first1=Antony|title=Men's Fashion|issue=57699|work=The Times|date=24 October 1969|ref=pg.15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Mirabel Walker described it as among a crop of new shoe design companies that had caught up with continental Europe's design approach, saying: "The Chelsea Cobbler...make shoes in any colour, any style, to suit any foot".&lt;ref name="The Guardian Walker"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Mirabel|title=Glorious Jumble|work=The Guardian|date=17 July 1969|ref=pg.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970s expansion==
In 1970, The Chelsea Cobbler was chosen as part of the Dress of the Year ensemble. Its blue suede boots were worn in combination with a [[Bill Gibb]] plaid maxi skirt and a waistcoat by [[Kaffe Fassett]]. The outfit's selector was ''[[Vogue (British magazine)|Vogue]]'' editor [[Beatrix Miller]].&lt;ref name="FMB, DotY"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dress of the Year|url=http://www.fashionmuseum.co.uk/galleries/dress-year|website=fashionmuseum.co.uk|accessdate=3 June 2015|publisher=Fashion Museum, Bath}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1970, ''The Times'' featured its novelty canvas boots supplied with [[Iron-on|iron-on transfers]], enabling people to customise their footwear by decorating the canvas in acrylic paints. The boots were priced at 12 guineas a pair.&lt;ref name="The Times 57840"&gt;{{cite news|title=Paint your own boots|issue=57840|work=The Times|date=10 April 1970|ref=pg.14}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this stage, as Prudence Glynn reported, fashionable shoppers were in the grip of boot "fever": "The British, of course, love queueing and the new generation of standers in line can be seen any day in The Chelsea Cobbler or Annello and Davide preparing to wait eight to 12 weeks for a pair of boots to be made. The boot fever is such that even the Parisiennes must wait because stocks sell as fast as they are delivered".&lt;ref name="The Times 58001"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Glynn|first1=Prudence|title=Fashion by Prudence Glynn|issue=58001|work=The Times|date=20 October 1970|ref=pg.12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, the company was among the accessories designers featured in an exhibition showcasing British talent at [[The Louvre]] – at the invitation of the director of [[Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris|Musée des Arts Décoratifs]] – entitled ''L'Idee de la Forme''. Fashion designers in the mix included [[Christopher McDonnell]], [[Barbara Hulanicki]], [[Mary Quant]], [[Jean Muir]], Bill Gibb and [[Women's Home Industries|Beatrice Bellini]].&lt;ref name="The Times Glynn 58134"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Glynn|first1=Prudence|title=Brittania Crosses the Waves|issue=58134|work=The Times|date=30 March 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, the company was also producing boots – wide-legged and in quilted suede with wooden heel and platform – for main branches of [[Russell &amp; Bromley]].&lt;ref name="The Times 58258"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Glynn|first1=Prudence|title=Coming Attractions|issue=58258|work=The Times|date=24 August 1971|ref=pg.12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, a branch opened in New York City.&lt;ref name=schiro&gt;{{cite news|last=Schiro|first=Anne-Marie|title=Fit. Comfort Most Important .These Shoe Designers Sell, And Wear Their Shoes|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1870&amp;dat=19800316&amp;id=_4sfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NtMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1206,806196 |accessdate=19 February 2014 |newspaper=Daytona Beach Sunday News-Journal |date=16 March 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1973, The Chelsea Cobbler had its own department within [[Harrods]]' 'Way In' fashion department.&lt;ref name="The Times 58914"&gt;{{cite news|title=Picture Page|issue=58914|work=The Times|date=16 October 1973|ref=pg.12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prudence Glynn reported that the leather company [[Barrow Hepburn]] had taken a controlling interest, saying: "I approve of Barrow Hepburn's controlling interest in Chelsea Cobbler. Richard Smith, who heads the latter, has very sensitive antennae and a very sure style. With Manolo Blahnik of Zapata, he shares the favours to top fashion designers in this country who use his shoes to complement their clothes".&lt;ref name="The Times 58914"/&gt; Two years later, The Chelsea Cobbler was once again chosen as part of the Dress of the Year ensemble, this time for a pair of men's shoes worn with a [[Tommy Nutter]] suit and chosen by the editor of the UK edition of ''[[Brides (magazine)|Brides]]''.&lt;ref name="FMB, DotY"/&gt;

In 1976, it was reported that Richard Smith would be creating a shoe design for Rayne.&lt;ref name="The Times 59666."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Glynn|first1=Prudence|title=Shopping|issue=59666.|work=The Times|date=30 March 1976|ref=pg.10}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1978, The Chelsea Cobbler had branches in [[Bond Street|New Bond Street]], [[Fulham Road]] and [[King's Road]], as well as concessions in Harrods and [[Bentalls]] in [[Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]].&lt;ref name="The Guardian 23061978"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hot on the Heel of Fashion (advert)|work=The Guardian|date=23 June 1978|ref=pg.25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Little Golden Calf''''' ({{lang-ru|Золотой телёнок}}, ''Zolotoy telyonok'') is a satirical novel by Soviet authors [[Ilf and Petrov]], released in 1931. Its main character, [[Ostap Bender]], also appeared in a previous novel by the authors called  ''[[The Twelve Chairs]]''. The title alludes to the "[[golden calf]]" of the [[Bible]]; another possible rendering of it in English, less literal but better tuned to the air of the novel, would be "The Gilded Calf".

==Plot summary==
[[Ostap Bender]] is still alive (but sports a scar across his neck), after barely surviving the assassination attempt in the previous book, which he once briefly mentions as "stupid business". This time he hears a story about a "clandestine [[millionaire]]" named Alexandr Koreiko. Koreiko has made millions through various illegal enterprises by taking advantage of the widespread corruption in the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP) period while pretending to live on an office clerk's salary of 46 rubles a month.
Koreiko lives in ''Chernomorsk'' (literally: [[Black Sea]] city, referring to the city of [[Odessa]]) and keeps his large stash of ill-gotten money in a suitcase, waiting for the fall of the Soviet government, so that he can make use of it.
Together with two petty criminals Balaganov and Panikovsky, and an extremely naive and innocent car driver Kozlevich, Bender finds out about Koreiko and starts to collect all the information he can get on his business activities. Koreiko tries to flee, but Bender eventually tracks him down in [[Turkestan]], on the newly built [[Turkestan–Siberia Railway]]. He then blackmails him into giving him a million rubles.

Suddenly rich, Bender faces the problem of how to spend his money in a [[Communist]] country where there are no legal millionaires. Nothing of the life of the rich that Bender dreamt of seems possible in the Soviet Union. Frustrated, Bender even decides to anonymously donate the money to the [[Ministry of Finance (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Finance]], but changes his mind. He turns the money into [[jewelry|jewels]] and [[gold]], and tries to cross the [[Romania]]n border, only to be robbed by the Romanian border guards, leaving him only with a medal, the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]].

== Main characters ==

*[[Ostap Bender|Ostap Ibragimovich Bender]], the main character and protagonist
*Shura Balaganov, the second "Son of Lieutenant Schmidt"
*Mikhail Samuelevich Panikovsky, the third "Son of Lieutenant Schmidt"
*Adam Kazimirovich Kozlevich, a taxi "Wildebeest" ({{lang-ru|"Антилопа Гну"}}) driver
*Alexander Ivanovich Koreiko, a millionaire

== Two endings ==

There are two alternative endings to ''The Golden Calf''. One was written at the time the novel was originally submitted for publication to the magazine ''Thirty Days''. The other appeared later, probably due to the objections to the writers for lionizing their main character.
According to the first, Ostap Bender, after obtaining his "million", gets to know the sorrow of a lonely man who has fulfilled his purpose, renounces the fortune, and marries his beloved, Zoya Sinitskaya.
In the second, he is torn. At first, he returns his "million" to the Commissariat of Finance, but then changes his mind. Determined to travel to [[Rio de Janeiro]], he is caught crossing the Romanian border and sent back home, after being deprived of his fortune by Romanian border guards.
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“No ovations! I failed to become [[the Count of Monte Christo]]. I’ll have to retrain as an apartment manager”.&lt;ref&gt;Не надо оваций! Графа Монте-Кристо из  меня  не  вышло. Придется переквалифицироваться в управдомы.&lt;/ref&gt; (the 1932 English translation reads: "I shall have to qualify as a janitor")
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Cultural influence==
The book contributed a number of [[catchphrase]]s and colorful terms into the [[Russian language]], such as "''Horns and Hoofs'' company ("Рога и копыта")" and "[[Children of Lieutenant Schmidt]]", see the [[q:The Little Golden Calf|Wikiquote]] page for the book for more.

===Adaptations===
[[Mikhail Shveytser]] made a black-and-white film ''[[The Golden Calf (1968 film)|The Golden Calf]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0063845|Zolotoy Telyonok}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1968, with [[Sergey Yursky]] as Bender. In [[1993 in film|1993]], it was adapted as ''Mechty Idiota'' (Idiot's Dreams) by director [[Vasili Pichul]], starring pop singer [[Sergei Krylov (singer)|Sergei Krylov]] as Bender. In 2006, the Russian [[Channel One (Russia)|Channel One]] aired the eight-part TV series ''{{Interlanguage link|The Golden Calf (TV series)|lt=The Golden Calf|ru|Золотой телёнок (телесериал)}}''  starring [[Oleg Menshikov]] as Bender.

The 2009 translation into English, ''The Little Golden Calf'' by Annie O. Fisher (published by Russian Life Books) was the first unabridged, uncensored translation into English of the novel.&lt;ref name="Russian Life"&gt;[http://www.russianlife.com/books/fiction/the-little-golden-calf/ The Little Golden Calf] ''[[Russian Life]]'', retrieved 9/6/2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The translation won the 2010 AATSEEL Award for Best Translation into English from any Slavic Language.&lt;ref name="Russian Life"/&gt;

'''''The Other Log of Phileas Fogg''''' is a science fiction/[[steampunk]] [[parallel history]] novel written by American author [[Philip José Farmer]] in 1973. It was originally published by [[DAW Books]] and later reprinted in 1979 by Hamlyn and again in 1982 by [[Tor Books]]. Tor has subsequently reissued the novel in 1988 and 1993.

==Plot introduction==

The story takes place within the internal reality first imagined in the 1872 [[Jules Verne]] novel, ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days (novel)|Around the World in Eighty Days]]''. Farmer includes many of the story's original characters, including [[Phileas Fogg]] and his French valet, [[Jean Passepartout|Passepartout]]. He establishes that all of Verne's published works take place within the same shared continuity. He includes elements of [[crossover fiction]], incorporating the [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] characters of [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[Professor Moriarty|James Moriarty]] into his setting. These elements place Phileas Fogg and his entire supporting cast into the [[Wold Newton family]] of literary characters.

In an introduction, Farmer posits that Verne's story was not simply an article of fiction, but the chronology of actual events, which Verne later decided to adapt into a fictional setting. In the book's epilogue, Farmer playfully alludes to the notion that Phileas Fogg is still alive, and may in fact be the actual author of the story (Farmer notes that they both share the same initials, suggesting that Philip Farmer is actually an alias for Phileas Fogg).

From Farmer's perspective, Jules Verne revealed only a small and significantly subdued portion of the actual background and exploits of Phileas Fogg. He establishes that the events surrounding ''Around the World in Eighty Days'' is actually a singular aspect of a greater conflict taking place between two immortal alien races, the Eridani and the Capellas. Farmer's story does not challenge any of the elements of the original text, but rather it adds an ambitious secondary tale taking place behind (and often in between) the scenes of Verne's material.

==Plot summary==

Phileas Fogg is a mysterious British gentleman who lives with his valet Passepartout at No. 7 Saville-Row in [[Burlington Gardens]] during the latter half of the 19th century. Unbeknownst to his peers, he is also the immortal foster child of a race of humanoid aliens known as the Eridani. A man of great intellect and affluence, Fogg enters into a wager with a fellow Eridanian citing that he can circumnavigate the globe in exactly eighty days. Although witnesses feel that his claim is little more than the boasting of a rich eccentric, Fogg is in fact undertaking a secret mission on behalf of his Eridanian colleagues.

Along with Passepartout, Fogg begins a quest to find a piece of stolen alien technology – a teleportation device that had recently fallen into the hands of the Eridani's rivals, an alien race known as the Capellas. His journey brings him face to face with the infamous sea scourge [[Captain Nemo]], a Capellan agent who is also known in British circles by his [[nom de guerre]] – [[Professor Moriarty|James Moriarty]]. The two combatants match wits with one another at several key locations, including the mysterious ghost ship known as the ''[[Mary Celeste]]''.

The journey climaxes with a final battle at Fogg's home in London, mere moments before meeting the deadline required to win his world-spanning wager.

==Notes==
The novel concludes with a twenty-one page addendum written by H.W. Starr entitled "A Submersible Subterfuge or Proof Impositive". It originally appeared in ''Leaves from the Copper Beeches'' and published for the Sons of the Copper Beeches Scion Society of the [[Baker Street Irregulars]]; Livingston Publishing Company, [[Narberth, Pennsylvania|Narberth]], 1959.

Starr exhaustively details the irreconcilable inconsistencies that take place within Verne's ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'', and its companion novel, ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' (which likewise features the character of Captain Nemo). He further contrasts the life and personality of Nemo, as originally presented by Verne, with that of James Moriarty – nemesis of [[Sherlock Holmes]]. Information contained within the addendum actually challenges Farmer's merging of both characters, citing specific comparisons of age, personality and lineage.

The '''translation convention''' is a [[film]]ic and [[television]] [[story-telling]] device in which the characters within a fictional story are heard or seen speaking not their [[native language]] but instead the [[language]] of the film's [[audience]], which is pretended to be their native languages. Sometimes, some or all of the characters speak with an [[accent (dialect)|accent]] that reflects the actual language spoken in the fictional or historical story setting.

This conceit has been used since the beginning of [[narrative]] [[sound film]]. It uses, among other things, a degree of [[suspension of disbelief]].
