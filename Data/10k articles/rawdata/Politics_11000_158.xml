The U.S. '''Arms Control and Disarmament Agency''' ('''ACDA''') was an [[independent agency of the United States government]] that existed from 1961 to 1999.  Its mission was to strengthen United States national security by "formulating, advocating, negotiating, implementing and verifying effective arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament policies, strategies, and agreements."

In so doing, ACDA ensured that arms control was fully integrated into the development and conduct of United States national security policy. ACDA also conducted, supported, and coordinated research for arms control and disarmament policy formulation, prepared for and managed U.S. participation in international arms control and disarmament negotiations, and prepared, operated, and directed U.S. participation in international arms control and disarmament systems.

==1961 creation==
[[File:ACDA Lake Mohonk 1969 six people.jpg|thumb|right|Scholars discussing issues of American defense posture and European security during a 1969 ACDA meeting at Lake Mohonk, New York]]
The Arms Control and Disarmament Agency was established by the [[Arms Control and Disarmament Act of 1961|Arms Control and Disarmament Act]], {{USStatute|87|297|75|631|1961|09|26}}.&lt;ref name="dos-acda-dirs"/&gt; The {{USBill|87|H.R.|9118}} bill was drafted by presidential adviser [[John J. McCloy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=8214 |title=John F. Kennedy: "Letter to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House Proposing the Establishment of a United States Disarmament Agency," June 29, 1961 |author1=Peters, Gerhard |author2=Woolley, John T |work=The American Presidency Project |publisher=University of California - Santa Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=8376 |title=John F.

McCloy, Adviser to the President on Disarmament.," October 6, 1961 |author1=Peters, Gerhard |author2=Woolley, John T |work=The American Presidency Project |publisher=University of California - Santa Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its predecessor was the [[U.S. Disarmament Administration]], part of the U.S. Department of State (1960–61). 

==Early mission==
[[File:Arms Control and Disarmament Agrements 1977 Edition cover.jpg|thumb|upright=0.67|right|Cover of a 1977 ACDA report on the history of arms control agreements]]
In the 1970s emphasis of the agency was placed upon gaining an understanding of the strategic weapons capabilities of the [[Soviet Union]] and [[People's Republic of China]]. The electronic reconnaissance capability of the [[United States]] was expanded through federal agency research and private contract research, utilizing [[radio frequency]] as well as optical technologies. The theory of this mission was that a clearer understanding of other nations' strategic capabilities was an important initial step in [[Prevention of nuclear catastrophe|prevention of nuclear war]].

==1997 reorganization==
In 1997, the [[Clinton administration]] announced the partial integration of ACDA with the State Department as part of the reinvention of the agencies which implement the nation’s foreign policy.{{ref|2}}

The ACDA Director served as both the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs and a Senior Adviser to the President and the Secretary of State for Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and Disarmament. He communicated with the President through the Secretary of State. In his capacity as senior advisor to the president, the Under Secretary attended and participated, at the direction of the president, in [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] (NSC) and subordinate meetings pertaining to arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament and had the right to communicate, through the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], with the President and members of the NSC on arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament concerns.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

==1999 end==
As of April 1, 1999, ACDA was abolished and its functions merged into the Department of State.&lt;ref name="na-oar"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://catalog.archives.gov/id/10485323 | title=Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.

The functions of the ACDA Director were replaced by the office of the [[Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs]] and by the office of the Senior Advisor to the President and the Secretary of State for Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and Disarmament.&lt;ref name="na-oar"/&gt;

Additional reorganizations of the arms control function in those bureaus took place in subsequent years.

'''Bernard Charles Ecclestone''' (born 28 October 1930) is a British [[business magnate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/specials/rich_list/article3795939.ece |title=Bernie and Slavica Ecclestone|work=Rich List 2008|date= 27 April 2008|accessdate=4 July 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the former chief executive of the [[Formula One Group]], which  manages [[Formula One]] and controls the commercial rights to the sport, and part-owns Delta Topco, the ultimate parent company of the Formula One Group. As such, he was commonly described in journalism as 'F1 Supremo'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/may/15/bernie-ecclestone-f1-bribery-charges |title=Bernie Ecclestone F1 future under cloud as bribery charges are prepared |work=The Guardian |date=15 May 2013 |accessdate=25 June 2013 |first=Paul |last=Weaver |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing/mark-webber-v-sebastian-vettel-clash-f1-supremo-bernie-ecclestone-unhappy-with-red-bulls-tactics-8549651.html |title=Mark Webber v Sebastian Vettel clash: F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone unhappy with Red Bull's tactics |work=The Independent |date=26 March 2013 |accessdate=25 June 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/money/money-matters/the-fast-life-of-bernie-ecclestone/story-e6frfmd9-1226559949154 |title=The fast life of 'F1 Supremo' Bernie Ecclestone |publisher=News Limited Network |date=23 January 2012 |accessdate=25 June 2013 |first=Maria |last=Bervanakis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 January 2017, it was announced that Ecclestone had been replaced by [[Chase Carey]] as chief executive of the Formula One Group, though he has been appointed as chairman emeritus and will act as an adviser to the board.&lt;ref name="CEO"&gt;{{cite web | title=Bernie Ecclestone removed as Liberty Media completes $8bn takeover | work=[[BBC Sport]] | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/38723001 | date=23 January 2017 | accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His early involvement in the sport was as a competitor and then as a manager of drivers [[Stuart Lewis-Evans]] and [[Jochen Rindt]]. In 1972, he bought the [[Brabham]] team, which he ran for fifteen years.&lt;ref name="formulaonetremayne-pp8"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tremayne |first=David |authorlink=David Tremayne |title=Formula One: A Complete Race by Race Guide |year=1996 |url=http://www.biblio.com/details.php?dcx=23079298&amp;aid=frg |accessdate=1 March 2008|edition=1st |publisher=Parragon Book Service |location=[[Avonmouth]], Bristol, United Kingdom |isbn=0-7525-1762-7 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a team owner he became a member of the [[Formula One Constructors Association]]. His control of the sport, which grew from his pioneering the sale of [[television rights]] in the late 1970s, was chiefly financial, but under the terms of the [[Concorde Agreement]] he and his companies also managed the administration, setup and logistics of each Formula One Grand Prix, making him one of the richest men in the UK. Ecclestone entered two Grand Prix races as a driver, during the 1958 season, but failed to qualify for either of them.

Ecclestone and business partner [[Flavio Briatore]] also owned the English football club [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] between 2007 and 2011.&lt;ref name="QPRsale"&gt;{{cite web | title=Malaysian executive buys QPR from Ecclestone | work=[[The Washington Times]] | url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/aug/18/malaysian-executive-buys-qpr-from-ecclestone/ | date=18 August 2011 | accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecclestone was born in [[St Peter, South Elmham]], a hamlet three miles south of [[Bungay]], [[Suffolk]].&lt;ref name="edp"&gt;[http://www.edp24.co.uk/lifestyle/poor_suffolk_boy_to_formula_one_billionaire_1_818525 Poor Suffolk boy to Formula One billionaire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110213407/http://www.edp24.co.uk/lifestyle/poor_suffolk_boy_to_formula_one_billionaire_1_818525 |date=10 November 2013 }}, ''Eastern Daily Press'', 3 March 2011.

== Motorsports career ==

=== Early career ===
Immediately after the end of [[World War II]], Ecclestone went into business trading in spare parts for motorcycles, and formed the Compton &amp; Ecclestone motorcycle dealership with Fred Compton. His first racing experience came in 1949 in the 500cc [[Formula 3]] Series, acquiring a Cooper Mk V in 1951. He drove only a limited number of races, mainly at his local circuit, [[Brands Hatch]], but achieved a number of good placings and an occasional win.&lt;ref name="formulaonetremayne-pp8"/&gt; He initially retired from racing following several accidents at Brands Hatch, intending to focus on his business interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/connaught/motorsport/driver/733.html |title=Bernie Ecclestone – F1 Driver Profile |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his accident, Ecclestone temporarily left racing to make a number of eventually lucrative investments in real estate and loan financing and to manage the Weekend Car Auctions firm. He returned to racing in 1957 as manager of driver [[Stuart Lewis-Evans]], and purchased two chassis from the disbanded [[Connaught Engineering|Connaught]] F1 team,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lovell|first=Terry|title=Bernie Ecclestone: King of Sport|publisher=John Blake|year=2009|location=London|page=25|isbn=978-1-84454-826-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose driver line-up over the years had included Lewis-Evans, [[Roy Salvadori]], [[Archie Scott Brown]], and [[Ivor Bueb]]. Ecclestone even attempted, unsuccessfully, to qualify a car himself at [[1958 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]] in 1958 (although this has since been described as "not a serious attempt"). He also entered the [[1958 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]], but the car was raced by [[Jack Fairman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Small|first=Steve|title=The Guinness Complete Grand Prix Who's Who|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|year=1994|location=Enfield|page=411|isbn=0-85112-702-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to manage Lewis-Evans when he moved to the [[Vanwall]] team; Salvadori moved on to manage the [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]] team. Lewis-Evans suffered severe burns when his engine exploded at the [[1958 Moroccan Grand Prix]] and succumbed to his injuries six days later; Ecclestone was rather shaken up and once again retired from racing.

His friendship with Salvadori led to his becoming manager of driver [[Jochen Rindt]]&lt;ref name="formulaonetremayne-pp8"/&gt; and a partial owner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://forix.autosport.com/8w/ghill.html |title=8W – Who – Graham Hill |work=Autosport|date=10 June 2002 |accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Rindt's 1970 [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] Formula 2 team (whose other driver was [[Graham Hill]]). Rindt, on his way to the 1970 World Championship, died in a crash at the [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]] circuit, though he was awarded the championship posthumously. In early 1972, Ecclestone purchased the [[Brabham]] team from [[Ron Tauranac]].

=== Brabham ===
During the 1971 season, Ecclestone was approached by [[Ron Tauranac]], owner of the Brabham team, who was looking for a suitable business partner. Ecclestone made him an offer of £100,000 for the whole team, which Tauranac eventually accepted.&lt;ref name="formulaonetremayne-pp8"/&gt; The Australian stayed on as designer and to run the factory.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence (1999) p. 116 Tauranac claims that Ecclestone initially offered £130,000, but lowered the offer at the last minute. Ecclestone denies that this happened. Lovell (2004) pp.32–33&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colin Seeley]] was briefly brought in against Tauranac's wishes to assist in design and management.

Ecclestone and Tauranac were both dominant personalities and Tauranac left Brabham early in the [[1972 Formula One season|1972 season]]. The team achieved little during 1972, as Ecclestone moulded the team to fit his vision of a Formula One team. He abandoned the highly successful customer car production business established by [[Jack Brabham]] and Tauranac – reasoning that to compete at the very front in Formula One you must concentrate all of your resources there. For the [[1973 Formula One season|1973 season]], Ecclestone promoted [[Gordon Murray]] to chief designer. The young South African produced the triangular cross-section BT42, the first of a series of Ford-powered cars with which the Brabham team would take several victories in 1974 and 1975 with [[Carlos Reutemann]] and [[Carlos Pace]].

Despite the increasing success of Murray's nimble Ford-powered cars, Ecclestone signed a deal with [[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] to use their powerful but heavy flat-12 engine from the [[1976 Formula One season|1976 season]]. Although this was financially beneficial, the new BT45s were unreliable and the Alfa engines rendered them significantly overweight. The 1976 and [[1977 Formula One season|1977 seasons]] saw Brabham fall towards the back of the field again, before winning two races again in the [[1978 Formula One season|1978 season]] when Ecclestone signed the Austrian double world champion [[Niki Lauda]], intrigued by Murray's radical [[Brabham BT46|BT46]] design.

The Brabham-Alfa era ended in 1979, the team's first season with the up-and-coming young Brazilian [[Nelson Piquet]] when Alfa Romeo started testing their own Formula One car during this season. This prompted Ecclestone to revert to Cosworth DFV engines – a move Murray described as "like having a holiday".

Piquet formed a close and long-lasting relationship with Ecclestone and the team, losing the title after a narrow battle with [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]] in 1980 and eventually winning in 1981 and 1983. In the summer of 1981 Brabham had tested a car powered by a [[BMW in Formula One|BMW]] [[turbocharger|turbo]] engine, and [[1982 Formula One season|1982]]'s new BT50 was powered by [[BMW Sauber|BMW]]'s turbocharged 4-cylinder [[BMW M10|M10]]. Brabham continued to run the Ford-powered BT49D in the early part of the season while reliability and driveability issues were sorted out by BMW and their technical partner, [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]]. Ecclestone and BMW came close to splitting before the turbo car duly took its first win at the [[1982 Canadian Grand Prix]] but the partnership took the first turbo-powered world championship in 1983.

The team continued to be competitive until 1985. At the end of the year, Piquet left after seven years. He was unhappy with the money that Ecclestone was willing to offer him and went to [[Williams F1|Williams]] where he would win his third championship. The following year, Murray, who since 1973 had designed cars that had scored 22 GP wins, left Brabham to join McLaren. Brabham continued under Ecclestone's leadership to the end of the 1987 season, in which the team scored only eight points. BMW withdrew from Formula One after the [[1987 Formula One season|1987 season]].

Having bought the team from Ron Tauranac for approximately $120,000 at the end of 1971, Ecclestone eventually sold it for over US$5 million to a Swiss businessman, Joachim Luhti in 1988.

[[File:Michael Schumacher Bernie Ecclestone September 1991.jpg|thumb|[[Michael Schumacher]] meeting Ecclestone in September 1991 at a [[World Sportscar Championship|sportscar]] race at [[Magny-Cours]], [[France]] (Ecclestone's then-wife Slavica on the right)]]
In parallel to his activities as team owner, Ecclestone formed the [[Formula One Constructors Association]] (FOCA) in 1974 with [[Frank Williams (Formula One)|Frank Williams]], [[Colin Chapman]], [[Teddy Mayer]], [[Ken Tyrrell]], and [[Max Mosley]]. He became increasingly involved with his roles at FISA and the FOCA in the 1970s, in particular with negotiating the sport's television rights, in his decades-long advocacy for team control.&lt;ref name="formulaonetremayne-pp8"/&gt;

Ecclestone became chief executive of FOCA in 1978 with Mosley as his legal advisor; together, they negotiated a series of legal issues with the FIA and [[Jean-Marie Balestre]], culminating in Ecclestone's famous coup, his securing the right for FOCA to negotiate television contracts for the Grands Prix. For this purpose Ecclestone established [[Formula One Promotions and Administration]], giving 47% of television revenues to teams, 30% to the FIA, and 23% to FOPA (i.e. Ecclestone himself); in return, FOPA put up the prize money – ''grand prix'' could literally be translated from French as "big prize".

Television rights shuffled between Ecclestone's companies, teams, and the FIA in the late 1990s, but Ecclestone emerged on top again in 1997 when he negotiated the present [[Concorde Agreement]]: in exchange for annual payments, he maintained the television rights.

Also in 1978, Ecclestone hired [[Sid Watkins]] as official Formula One medical doctor. Following the crash at the [[1978 Italian Grand Prix]], Watkins demanded that Ecclestone provide better safety measures, which were provided at the next race. This way, Formula One began to improve safety, decreasing the number of deaths and serious injuries along the decades.

Despite heart surgery and triple coronary bypass in 1999, Ecclestone had remained as energetic as always in promoting his own business interests. In the late 1990s he reduced his share in [[SLEC Holdings]] (owner of the various F1 managing firms) to 25%, though despite his minority share he retained complete control of the companies. Also in 1999, Terry Lovell published a biography of Ecclestone, ''Bernie's Game: Inside the Formula One World of Bernie Ecclestone'' ({{ISBN|1-84358-086-1}}). In April 2000 Ecclestone sold [[International Sportsworld Communicators]] to [[David Richards (racing)|David Richards]]. ISC owned the commercial rights for the [[World Rally Championship]].

The revenue sharing with the various teams, the Concorde Agreement, expired on the last day of 2007, and the contract with the FIA expired on the last day of 2012.

Ecclestone was removed from his position as chief executive of [[Formula One Group]] on 23 January 2017, following its takeover by [[Liberty Media]] in 2016.&lt;ref name=BBC38723001&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/38723001 |title=Bernie Ecclestone removed as Liberty Media completes $8bn takeover |first=Andrew |last=Benson |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 January 2017 |accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other activities ===

Ecclestone came under fire in October 2004 when he and [[British Racing Drivers' Club]] president [[Jackie Stewart]] were unable to come to terms regarding the future [[British Grand Prix]], causing the race to be dropped from the 2005 provisional season calendar. However, when the heads of the ten teams met and agreed on a series of cost-cuts later in the month, the race was again added to the calendar, and a contract on 9 December guaranteed its continuation for five years. In mid-November 2004, the three banks who comprise [[Speed Investments]], which owns a 75% share in [[SLEC]], which in turn controls Formula One – [[BayernLB|Bayerische Landesbank]], [[J.P. Morgan Chase]], and [[Lehman Brothers]] – sued Ecclestone for more control over the sport, prompting speculation that Ecclestone might altogether lose the control he had maintained for more than thirty years. A two-day hearing began on 23 November, but after the proceedings had ended the following day, Justice Andrew Park announced his intention to reserve ruling for several weeks. On 6 December 2004, Park read his verdict, stating that "In [his] judgment it is clear that Speed's contentions are correct and [he] should therefore make the declarations which it requests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv-f1.com/News_Article.aspx?PO_ID=31709 |title=Legal blow for Ecclestone |date=7 December 2004 |accessdate=1 March 2008 |publisher=ITV F1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025013853/http://www.itv-f1.com/News_Article.aspx?PO_ID=31709 |archivedate=25 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ecclestone insisted that the verdict – seen almost universally as a legal blow to his control of Formula One – would mean "nothing at all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv-f1.com/News_Article.aspx?PO_ID=31710 |title=Bernie defiant |date=6 December 2004 |accessdate=1 March 2008 |publisher=ITV F1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025014000/http://www.itv-f1.com/News_Article.aspx?PO_ID=31710 |archivedate=25 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated his intention to appeal the decision. The following day, at a meeting of team bosses at [[Heathrow Airport]] in London, Ecclestone offered the teams a total of £260,000,000 over three years in return for unanimous renewal of the [[Concorde Agreement]], which expired in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv-f1.com/News_Article.aspx?PO_ID=31718 |title=Bernie offers £260m payday |date=7 December 2004 |accessdate=1 March 2008 |publisher=ITV F1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025014006/http://www.itv-f1.com/News_Article.aspx?PO_ID=31718 |archivedate=25 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, Gerhard Gribkowsky, a board member of Bayerische Landesbank and the chairman of SLEC, stated that the banks had no intention to remove Ecclestone from his position of control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv-f1.com/News_Article.aspx?PO_ID=31793 |title=Ecclestone to remain in charge |date=22 December 2004 |accessdate=1 March 2008 |publisher=ITV F1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929102944/http://www.itv-f1.com/News_Article.aspx?PO_ID=31793 |archivedate=29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Al'Khalifa Putin Ecclestone.jpeg|thumb|Ecclestone with King of Bahrain [[Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifah]] and Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] on tribunes of the races [[Russian Grand Prix|Formula One in Sochi]]. 12 October 2014]]
Ecclestone was a victim of theft in March 2005: two wheels were stolen from his car while it was parked outside his London home. The car, a brand new [[Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class (W219)|Mercedes-Benz CLS55 AMG]], was said to be the first of its kind in Britain. On Friday, 17 June 2005, Ecclestone made American headlines with his reply to a question about [[Danica Patrick]]'s fourth-place finish at the [[Indianapolis 500]], during an interview with Indianapolis television station WRTV:  "She did a good job, didn't she? Super. Didn't think she'd be able to make it like that. You know, I've got one of these wonderful ideas that women should be all dressed in white like all the other domestic appliances." (Following Danica Patrick's 2008 victory at Twin Ring Motegi, Ecclestone personally sent her a congratulatory letter).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Pete |last=McEntegart |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/pete_mcentegart/06/20/ten.spot/index.html |title=The 10 Spot: 20 June 2005 |date=20 June 2005 |accessdate=1 March 2008 |work=Sports Illustrated |quote=6.

The seven teams who refused to participate, stating concern over the safety of their [[Michelin]] tyres, requested rule changes and/or a change to the track configuration. Despite a series of meetings between Ecclestone, [[Max Mosley]], and the team principals, no compromise was reached by race time, and Ecclestone became an object of the public's frustration at the resultant six-car race. Despite him not having caused the problem, fans and journalists blamed him for failing to take control and enforce a solution, given the position of power in which he had placed himself.

On 25 November 2005 [[CVC Capital Partners]] announced it was to purchase both the Ecclestone shares of the Formula One Group (25% of [[SLEC]]) and Bayerische Landesbank's 48% share (held through [[Speed Investments]]). This left Alpha Prema owning 71.65% of the Formula One group. Ecclestone used the proceeds of this sale to purchase a stake in this new company (the exact ratio of the CVC/Ecclestone shareholding is not yet known). On 6 December Alpha Prema acquired [[JP Morgan Chase|JP Morgan's]] share of SLEC to increase its ownership of Formula One to 86%, the remaining 14% was held by [[Lehman Brothers]]. On 21 March 2006 the EU competition authorities approved the transaction subject to CVC selling Dorna, which controls the rights to [[MotoGP]]. CVC announced the completion of the transaction on 28 March. CVC acquired Lehman Brothers share at the end of March 2006. On 21 July 2007, Ecclestone announced in the media that he would be open to discuss the purchase of [[Arsenal Football Club]]. As a close friend to former Director of Arsenal David Dein, it was believed that the current board of the North London–based football club would prefer to sell to a British party, this after American-based investment company KSE headed by [[Stan Kroenke|"Silent" Stan Kroenke]] were thought to be preparing a £650 million takeover bid for Arsenal Holdings PLC.

After the loss of [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] as the venue for the [[British Grand Prix]] in 2008, Ecclestone came under fire from several high-profile names for his handling of Formula One's revenues. [[Damon Hill]] blamed Formula One Management as a key factor in the loss of the event: "There's always been the question of the FOM fee, and ultimately that is the deciding factor. To quote Bernie, he once said: 'You can have anything you like, as long as you pay too much for it,' but we can't pay too much for something&amp;nbsp;... The problem is money goes out and away. There's a question whether that money even returns to Formula One."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/68854|title=Hill blames F1's economy for losing GP|work=Autosport|date=4 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flavio Briatore]] also criticised FOM: "Nowadays Ecclestone takes 50% of all revenues, but we are supposed to be able to reduce our costs by 50%".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/69508|title=Briatore says F1 needs an overhaul |work=Autosport|date=29 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 January 2010, it was announced that Ecclestone had, together with [[Genii Capital]], submitted a bid for Swedish car brand [[Saab Automobile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saabsunited.com/2010/01/genii-team-up-with-bernie-ecclestone-to-bid-for-saab-automobile.html|title=Genii team up with Bernie Ecclestone to bid for Saab Automobile|date=8 January 2010|accessdate=8 January 2010|publisher=Saabs United}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of 24 November 2010, whilst returning to his apartment in his central London offices with girlfriend Fabiana Flosi, four men ambushed the pair and robbed them of jewellery, including diamond rings and a watch, with a total value of £200,000 (Ecclestone later said, "I see a figure of £200,000 mentioned but that is bollocks. They won't be going far on what they took off us").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topgear.com/au/car-news/bernie-ecclestone-hublot-advert-bruised-face-2010-12-07 Ecclestone's bruised face in new watch ad] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502001858/http://www.topgear.com/au/car-news/bernie-ecclestone-hublot-advert-bruised-face-2010-12-07 |date=2 May 2014 }}, ''Top Gear'', 7 December 2010.

==Controversies==

===Labour Party controversy===
In 1997 Ecclestone was involved in a political controversy over the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]'s policy on tobacco sponsorship.

Labour had pledged to ban [[tobacco advertising]] in its manifesto ahead of its [[United Kingdom General Election, 1997|1997 General Election victory]], supporting a proposed [[European Union Directive]] banning tobacco advertising and sponsorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4377928.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Timeline: Smoking and disease |accessdate=21 March 2008|date=30 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time all leading Formula One Teams carried significant branding from tobacco brands. The Labour Party's stance on banning tobacco advertising was reinforced following the election by forceful statements from the Health Secretary [[Frank Dobson]] and Minister for Public Health [[Tessa Jowell]].&lt;ref name="rawnsley"&gt;{{cite book |title=Servants of The People |last= Rawnsley|first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Rawnsley |year=2001 |publisher=Penguin Books|location=London |isbn=0-14-027850-8 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecclestone appealed 'over Jowell's head' to Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair's chief of staff, who arranged a meeting with Blair. Ecclestone and Mosley, both Labour Party donors, met Blair on 16 October 1997, where Mosley argued:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Motor racing was a world class industry which put Britain at the hi-tech edge. Deprived of tobacco money, Formula One would move abroad at the loss of 50,000 jobs, 150,000 part-time jobs and £900 million of exports."&lt;ref name="rawnsley"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
On 4 November the "fiercely anti-tobacco Jowell" argued in Brussels for an exemption for Formula One. Media attention initially focused on Labour bending its principles for a "glamour sport" and on the "false trail" of Jowell's husband's links to [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]].&lt;ref name="rawnsley"/&gt; On 6 November correspondents from three newspapers inquired whether Labour had received any donations from Ecclestone; he had donated £1 million in January 1997. On 11 November Labour promised to return the money on the advice of Sir Patrick Neill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = How the Ecclestone affair unfolded|publisher=BBC News | date =22 September 2000 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/937232.stm | accessdate =22 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 November Blair apologised for his government's mishandling of the affair and stated "the decision to exempt Formula One from tobacco sponsorship was taken two weeks later. It was in response to fears that Britain might lose the industry overseas to Asian countries who were bidding for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Blair apologises for mishandling F1 row|publisher=BBC News | date = 17 November 1997 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/31780.stm | accessdate =22 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the year after Blair stepped down as Prime Minister, internal Downing Street memos revealed that in fact the decision had been made at the time of the meeting, and not two weeks later as Blair stated in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Secret papers reveal Tony Blair's F1 tobacco deal |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4926737.ece | work=The Times  | date=12 October 2008 | accessdate=26 April 2010 | first1=Jonathan | last1=Oliver | first2=Isabel | last2=Oakeshott | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hitler controversy ===
In a ''[[The Times|Times]]'' interview published on 4 July 2009, Ecclestone said "terrible to say this I suppose, but apart from the fact that Hitler got taken away and persuaded to do things that I have no idea whether he wanted to do or not, he was – in the way that he could command a lot of people – able to get things done."&lt;ref name="times"&gt;Alice Thomson and Rachel Sylvester [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/formula_1/article6632991.ece "Bernie Ecclestone, the Formula One boss, says despots are underrated",] ''The Times'', 4 July 2009; [https://web.archive.org/web/20090827032853/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/formula_1/article6632991.ece (archived version)]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ecclestone: "If you have a look at a democracy it hasn't done a lot of good for many countries — including this one", in reference to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt; He also said that his friend of 40 years [[Max Mosley]], the son of British fascist leader [[Oswald Mosley]], "would do a super job" as Prime Minister and added "I don't think his background would be a problem."&lt;ref name="times" /&gt;

[[Stephen Pollard]], editor of ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'', said: "Mr Ecclestone is either an idiot or morally repulsive. Either he has no idea how stupid and offensive his views are or he does and deserves to be held in contempt by all decent people."&lt;ref&gt;Steve Bird, [[Ruth Gledhill]] and Sam Coates [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/formula_1/article6633340.ece "Hitler? He got things done, says Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone",] ''The Times'', 4 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent interview with ''The Jewish Chronicle'', Ecclestone said that his comments were taken the wrong way, but apologised, saying, "I'm just sorry that I was an idiot. I sincerely, genuinely apologise."&lt;ref&gt;Simon Rocker [http://www.thejc.com/articles/ecclestone-i-was-idiot-over-hitler "Ecclestone: I was an idiot over Hitler",] ''The Jewish Chronicle'', 6 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, when Ecclestone was later told by [[Associated Press]] that the [[World Jewish Congress]] had called for his resignation, he said "it's a pity they didn't sort the banks out," referring to the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]], and claimed "They have a lot of influence everywhere."&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press [https://www.usatoday.com/sports/motor/formula1/2009-07-06-ecclestone-remarks_N.htm "Ecclestone says he won't resign over Hitler remarks",] ''USA Today'', 6 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bribery accusation ===
In a 2012 trial against the former BayernLB Chief Risk Officer Gerhard Gribkowsky, the public prosecutor accused Ecclestone of being a co-perpetrator in the case. Gribkowsky confessed to the charges of tax evasion, breach of trust and for accepting bribes. In closing arguments at a Munich trial the public prosecutor told the court Ecclestone "hasn't been blackmailed, he is a co-perpetrator in a bribery case". According to the prosecutor and defendant, Ecclestone paid about $44 million to the former banker to get rid of the lender's stake in Formula One. Ecclestone told prosecutors he paid Gribkowsky because he blackmailed him with telling UK tax authorities about a family trust controlled by Ecclestone's former wife.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Suess [https://archive.is/20130118163348/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-06-27/ecclestone-co-perpetrator-in-bribery-scheme-prosecutor-says "Ecclestone 'Co-Perpetrator' in Bribery, Prosecutor Says",] ''[[Bloomberg BusinessWeek]]'', 27 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
In November 2012 private equity firm Bluewaters Communications Holdings filed a £409m lawsuit against the 2005 sale of Formula One, alleging it was the sports rightful owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pitpass.com/47983-Exclusive-409m-lawsuit-against-Ecclestone-and-CVC-revealed|title=£409m lawsuit against Ecclestone and CVC revealed|publisher=Pitpass.com|date=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013 ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' reported that the Munich prosecutors office had charged Ecclestone with two bribery charges after a two-year investigation into his relationship with Gribkowsky.&lt;ref name=BBCMay16&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/22544436|title=Bernie Ecclestone: Formula 1 boss reportedly facing charges|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, German prosecutors indicted Ecclestone for alleged bribery. The charge relates to a $44 million (£29m) payment to Gribkowsky. It was linked to the sale of a stake in Formula 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Formula 1 boss Ecclestone indicted|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23344423#TWEET824508|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 July 2013|date=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerhard Gribkowsky, the [[BayernLB]] bank executive, was found guilty of taking $44m in [[bribes]] and failing to pay tax on the money.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/17/bernie-ecclestone-german-court Bernie Ecclestone indicted by German court for alleged bribery] Guardian 17 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecclestone has stated that he only paid the monies, as he feared Gerhard Gribkowsky had information about his finances, that if made known to the Inland Revenue, would have been costly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-2059617/Bernie-Ecclestone-I-paid-Gerhard-Gribkowsky-27m-avoid-tax-probe.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Simon | last=Cass | title=Ecclestone: I paid German banker Gribkowsky £27m to avoid tax probe | date=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 January 2014, a court in Munich ruled that Ecclestone would indeed be [[Judiciary of Germany|tried on bribery]] charges in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25756973 | publisher=BBC News | title=Formula 1: Ecclestone to face Germany bribery charges | date=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 5 August 2014, the same court ruled that Ecclestone could pay a £60m settlement, without admitting guilt, to end the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-28656050 | publisher=BBC News | title=F1 boss Ecclestone pays to end bribery trial | date=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tax avoidance ===
Interviews conducted by a German prosecutor in the Gerhard Gribkowsky case showed that Ecclestone had been under investigation by the UK tax authorities for nine years, and that he had avoided the payment of £1.2 billion through a legal tax avoidance scheme. [[HM Revenue and Customs]] agreed to conclude the matter in 2008 with a payment of £10 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Darragh|first=MacIntyre|title=F1's Ecclestone avoided potential £1.2bn tax bill|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-27144637|accessdate=28 April 2014|publisher=BBC News|date=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
In 2011 Faber and Faber published [[Tom Bower]]'s ''No Angel: The Secret Life of Bernie Ecclestone'', a biography purportedly written with Ecclestone's co-operation. Bower is best known for exposé biographies of controversial figures such as [[Robert Maxwell]] and [[Simon Cowell]], leading some commentators (e.g. Brian Appleyard of the [[New Statesman]]) to express surprise over Ecclestone's co-operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Appleyard|first=Brian|date= 27 April 2011|title=No Angel: The Secret Life of Bernie Ecclestone|work=New Statesman|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2011/04/bernie-ecclestone-sport-bower|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book recounts an episode at the 1979 Argentine Grand Prix in which [[Colin Chapman]] offered [[Mario Andretti]] $1000 to push Ecclestone into a hotel swimming pool in Buenos Aires. A nervous Andretti approached Ecclestone and confessed the plot, to which Ecclestone replied: "Pay me half and you can".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bower|first=Tom|title=No Angel: The Secret Life of Bernie Ecclestone|year=2011|publisher=Faber and Faber|isbn=9780571269365|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
The ''[[Forbes]]'' World's Billionaires List of 2011 ranked Ecclestone as the 4th richest person in the United Kingdom, with an estimated fortune of $4.2 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/bernard-ecclestone |title=Bernard Ecclestone &amp; family |work=Forbes |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; an increase of $200 million from the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/10/billionaires-2010_Bernard-Ecclestone-family_GVGJ.html |title=#212 Bernard Ecclestone &amp; family |work=Forbes |date=12 February 2010 |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2004, he sold one of his London residences in [[Kensington Palace Gardens]], never having lived in it, to steel magnate [[Lakshmi Mittal]] for £57.1 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://most-expensive.net/homes-ever-sold Most-Expensive.net], 28 January 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501024233/http://most-expensive.net/homes-ever-sold |date=1 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At Grand Prix venues, Ecclestone uses a grey mobile home, known as "Bernie's bus", as his headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Daily Telegraph |url=http://www.ukmotorsport.com/misc/ecclestone.html |title=Bernie Ecclestone: Interview |publisher=Ukmotorsport.com |date= |accessdate=22 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820110702/http://www.ukmotorsport.com/misc/ecclestone.html |archivedate=20 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Ecclestone sold his £9 million yacht ''[[Va Bene (yacht)|Va Bene]]'' to his friend [[Eric Clapton]].

Ecclestone has been married three times. With first wife Ivy, he has a daughter, Deborah, through whom he is a great-grandfather. He has five grandchildren — two granddaughters and three grandsons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3045127/GIRL-TOWN-Hello-boys-Petra-gives-birth-twins.html Petra Stunt Ecclestone gives birth to twin boys]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecclestone had a 17-year relationship with Tuana Tan, which ended in 1984 when [[Slavica Ecclestone|Slavica Radić]], later his second wife, became pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=No Angel: The Secret Life of Bernie Ecclestone|author=Tom Bower|page=133|ISBN=9780571269365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was then married to [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]]-born former [[Armani]] model Radić for 23 years.&lt;ref&gt;Lovell (2004) p.345&lt;/ref&gt; The couple have two daughters, [[Tamara Ecclestone|Tamara]] (born 1984) and [[Petra Stunt|Petra]] (born 1988). ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper announced on 20 November 2008 that Slavica Ecclestone had moved out of the family home and filed for divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wheeler |first=Virginia |url=http://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/scotsol/homepage/news/article1953278.ece |title=F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone to divorce|publisher=The Scottish Sun |date=21 November 2008 |accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slavica settled their divorce amicably with her receiving a reported $1 to 1.5 billion settlement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gastelumlaw.com/5-expensive-divorces/ The 5 Most Expensive Divorces] [Gastelum Law], |3 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The divorce was granted on 11 March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090311/ap_on_sp_au_ra_ne/car_f1_ecclestone_divorce F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone's Divorce Finalized]{{dead link|date=January 2016}} [[Yahoo Sports]], 11 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bioregional''' is an entrepreneurial [[charitable organization|charity]], which aims to invent and deliver practical [[solution]]s for sustainability. It was founded in 1992 on the belief that [[overconsumption]] of resources was the driving force behind [[environmental degradation]], and set out to find new ways to meet more of their needs from local resources.

== History ==

Bioregional was founded in 1992 by Sue Riddlestone OBE and Pooran Desai OBE, and began life in the [[Sutton Ecology Centre]]. They first worked on local environmental projects, including the promotion of [[closed loop recycling]] in London and Surrey,&lt;ref&gt;[[TreeHugger]], December 27, 2007, [http://www.treehugger.com/files/2007/12/local_paper_for.php Local Paper for London: Get your Own (Recycled) Paper Back]&lt;/ref&gt; reviving lavender production in Mitcham and Carshalton,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pictureofchange.org.uk/index.asp?page=23 A picture of change] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020025830/http://www.pictureofchange.org.uk/index.asp?page=23 |date=October 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; setting up Croydon's TreeStation to turn waste municipal wood into [[biomass]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Carbon Trust]], case study on [http://www.carbontrust.co.uk/resource/case_studies/LondonBoroughofCroydonandBioRegional.htm London Borough of Croydon and BioRegional Development Group] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203112000/http://www.carbontrust.co.uk/resource/case_studies/LondonBoroughofCroydonandBioRegional.htm |date=December 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and establishing the Bioregional Charcoal Company Ltd who help a network of local charcoal producers sell to major retail stores.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, June 13, 2008, [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/13/pledges.carbonemissions Tread lightly: Buy British barbecue charcoal]&lt;/ref&gt; These projects reflected Bioregional's aim of setting up social enterprises that could make the use of local and waste resources mainstream.

Bioregional began to expand in the late 1990s, and with the completion of [[BedZED]] they moved into their present offices in [[Hackbridge]], [[London Borough of Sutton]]. From BedZED they developed with One Planet Living programme with [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], which is the framework for all sustainable communities projects and has an equal influence over their vision as the original [[bioregionalism]] focus. Currently a One Planet Living communities is being built in [[Brighton]].&lt;ref&gt;The Times, February 15, 2008, [http://property.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/property/buying_and_selling/article3368859.ece Green apartments in Brighton]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioregional currently have around 40 staff in London, as well as regional offices in China, Canada, South Africa, Kenya, Greece, Mexico, and Australia.

Founded in 2005, Bioregional North America is an affiliated Canadian non-profit organisation that specializes in fostering sustainable behavior change and collaborative consumption amongst occupants in new and existing buildings across the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bioregional.us&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major current projects ==

* One Planet Living communities, planned to be built in every continent by 2012 to demonstrate Bioregional's vision&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oneplanetcommunities.org&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[B&amp;Q]] One Planet Home, developing a Sustainability Action Plan for the retailer and a customer-focused campaign and product range
* The Laundry, a [[closed loop recycling]] social enterprise for small businesses in central London
* One Planet Products, a sustainable construction materials buying club

== Description ==
Carbon sequestration is the process involved in [[Carbon fixation|carbon capture]] and the long-term storage of atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] ({{chem|CO|2}})&lt;ref name=SedjoSohngen/&gt; and may refer specifically to:
* "The process of removing carbon from the atmosphere and depositing it in a reservoir."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unfccc.int/essential_background/glossary/items/3666.php#C |title=Glossary of climate change acronyms |website=[[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] |accessdate=July 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When carried out deliberately, this may also be referred to as [[carbon dioxide removal]], which is a form of [[climate engineering|geoengineering]].
* [[Carbon capture and storage]], where carbon dioxide is removed from [[flue gases]] (e.g., at [[power station]]s) before being stored in underground reservoirs.
* Natural [[biogeochemical cycling]] of [[carbon]] between the [[atmosphere]] and reservoirs, such as by [[chemical weathering]] of rocks.

Carbon dioxide may be captured as a pure by-product in processes related to [[petroleum refining]] or from flue gases from [[power generation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alberta producers rewarded for use of {{CO2}} in enhanced oil recovery |date=May 25, 2004 |website=PointCarbon |url=http://www.pointcarbon.com/article.php?articleID=3774&amp;categoryID=147 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506083543/http://www.pointcarbon.com/article.php?articleID=3774&amp;categoryID=147 |archive-date=May 6, 2008 |access-date=August 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{chem|CO|2}} sequestration includes the storage part of carbon capture and storage, which refers to large-scale, artificial capture and sequestration of industrially produced {{chem|CO|2}} using subsurface [[Saline water|saline]] [[aquifers]], reservoirs, [[ocean water]], aging [[oil field]]s, or other [[carbon sink]]s.

Carbon sequestration describes long-term storage of [[carbon dioxide]] or other forms of [[carbon]] to either [[mitigation of global warming|mitigate or defer global warming]] and [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|avoid dangerous climate change]]. It has been proposed as a way to slow the atmospheric and marine accumulation of [[greenhouse gas]]es, which are released by burning [[fossil fuel]]s.&lt;ref name="Hodrien" /&gt;

Carbon dioxide is naturally captured from the atmosphere through biological, chemical or physical processes. Some artificial sequestration techniques exploit these natural processes,&lt;ref name=glossary/&gt; while some use entirely artificial processes.

There are three ways that this sequestration can be carried out; post-combustion capture, pre-combustion capture, and oxy-combustion. A wide variety of separation techniques are being pursued, including gas phase separation, absorption into a liquid, and adsorption on a solid, as well as hybrid processes, such as adsorption/membrane systems. These above processes basically will capture carbon emitting from power plants, factories, fuel burning industries and so on.

== Biological processes ==
[[Image:Phytoplankton SoAtlantic 20060215.jpg|right|thumb|upright|An oceanic [[Algal bloom|phytoplankton bloom]] in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]], off the coast of [[Argentina]]. Encouraging such blooms with iron fertilization could lock up carbon on the seabed.]]

[[Biosequestration]] or carbon sequestration through [[biological processes]] affects the global [[carbon cycle]]. Examples include major climatic fluctuations, such as the [[Azolla event]], which created the current [[Arctic]] climate. Such processes created [[fossil fuel]]s, as well as [[clathrate]] and [[limestone]]. By manipulating such processes, geoengineers seek to enhance sequestration.

=== Peat production ===
[[Peat bogs]] act as a sink for carbon due to the accumulation of partially decayed biomass that would otherwise continue to decay completely. There is a variance on how much the peatlands act as a carbon sink or carbon source that can be linked to varying climates in different areas of the world and different times of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strack|first1=ed. by Maria|title=Peatlands and climate change|date=2008|publisher=University of Calgary|location=Calgary|isbn=978-952-99401-1-0|pages=13–23|url=http://www.peatsociety.org/peatlands-and-peat/peatlands-and-climate-change|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By creating new bogs, or enhancing existing ones, the amount of carbon that is sequestered by bogs would increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19826542.400-burying-biomass-to-fight-climate-change.html |title=Burying biomass to fight climate change |journal=New Scientist |issue=2654 |date=May 3, 2008 |first=Richard |last=Lovett |subscription=yes |accessdate=May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Forestry ===

[[Reforestation]] is the replanting of trees on marginal crop and [[pasture]] lands to incorporate carbon from atmospheric {{chem|CO|2}} into [[biomass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/08/aerial-reforestation-explored-in-discovery-project-earth-premiere.php |title=Can Aerial Reforestation Help Slow Climate Change? Discovery Project Earth Examines Re-Engineering the Planet's Possibilities |website=TreeHugger |date=August 22, 2008 |first=Matthew |last=McDermott |accessdate=May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this process to succeed the carbon must not return to the atmosphere from mass burning or rotting when the trees die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=CRS Report for Congress: Carbon Sequestration in Forests |date=March 29, 2007 |first=Ross W. |last=Gorte |publisher=Congressional Research Service |url=http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/crs/RL31432.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=August 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, land allotted to the trees must not be converted to other uses and management of the frequency of disturbances might be necessary in order to avoid extreme events. Alternatively, the wood from them must itself be sequestered, e.g., via [[biochar]], bio-energy with carbon storage ([[Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage|BECS]]), landfill or 'stored' by use in e.g. construction.  Short of growth in perpetuity, however, reforestation with long-lived trees (&gt;100 years) will sequester carbon for a more graduated release, minimizing impact during the expected [[carbon crisis]] of the 21st century.

====Urban Forestry====
[[Urban Forestry]] increases the amount of carbon taken up in cities by adding new tree sites and the sequestration of carbon occurs over the lifetime of the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/mcpherson/psw_2013_mcpherson005.pdf |format=PDF |title=A new approach to quantify and map carbon stored, sequestered and emissions avoided by urban forests |last1=McPherson |first1=E.

The results of urban forestry can have different results depending on the type of vegetation that is being used, so it can function as a sink but can also function as a source of emissions.&lt;ref name="Urb For"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Velasco|first1=Erik|last2=Roth|first2=Matthias|last3=Norford|first3=Leslie|last4=Molina|first4=Luisa T.|title=Does urban vegetation enhance carbon sequestration?|journal=Landscape and Urban Planning|date=April 2016|volume=148|pages=99–107|doi=10.1016/j.landurbplan.2015.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with sequestration by the plants which is difficult to measure but seems to have little effect on the overall amount of carbon dioxide that is uptaken, the vegetation can have indirect effects on carbon by reducing need for energy consumption.&lt;ref name="Urb For" /&gt;

=== Wetland restoration ===
Wetland soil is an important carbon sink; 14.5% of the world’s [[soil carbon]] is found in wetlands, while only 6% of the world’s land is composed of wetlands.&lt;ref name='nelson'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puaf.umd.edu/papers/nelson/carbseq.htm |last=Nelson |first=Robert |title=Carbon Sequestration: A Better Alternative for Climate Change? |date=July 1999 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agriculture ===
{{See also|Carbon farming}}

Compared to natural vegetation, cropland soils are depleted in soil organic carbon (SOC). When a soil is converted from natural land or semi natural land, such as forests, woodlands, grasslands, steppes and savannas, the SOC content in the soil reduces with about 30–40%.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poeplau|first=Christopher|last2=Don|first2=Axel|date=2015-02-01|title=Carbon sequestration in agricultural soils via cultivation of cover crops – A meta-analysis|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880914004873|journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment|volume=200|issue=Supplement C|pages=33–41|doi=10.1016/j.agee.2014.10.024}}&lt;/ref&gt; This loss is due to the removal of plant material containing carbon, in terms of harvests. When the land use changes, the carbon in the soil will either increase or decrease, this change will continue until the soil reaches a new equilibrium. Deviations from this equilibrium can also be affected by variated climate .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goglio|first=Pietro|last2=Smith|first2=Ward N.|last3=Grant|first3=Brian B.|last4=Desjardins|first4=Raymond L.|last5=McConkey|first5=Brian G.|last6=Campbell|first6=Con A.|last7=Nemecek|first7=Thomas|date=2015-10-01|title=Accounting for soil carbon changes in agricultural life cycle assessment (LCA): a review|url=https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/elsevier/accounting-for-soil-carbon-changes-in-agricultural-life-cycle-7fKGPeVfUr|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|language=en|volume=104|pages=23–39|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.05.040|issn=0959-6526}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decreasing of SOC content can be counteracted by increasing the carbon input, this can be done with several strategies, e.g. leave harvest residues on the field, use manure as fertiliser or include perennial crops in the rotation. Perennial crops have larger below ground biomass fraction, which increases the SOC content.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Globally, soils are estimated to contain approximately 1,500&amp;nbsp;gigatons of organic carbon to 1 m depth, more than the amount in vegetation and the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Batjes |first=Niels H. |journal=European Journal of Soil Science |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=151–163 |title=Total carbon and nitrogen in the soils of the world |date=June 1996 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2389.1996.tb01386.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book |first=Pete |last=Smith |chapter=Soil Organic Carbon Dynamics and Land-Use Change |editor1-first=Ademola K. |editor1-last=Braimoh |editor2-first=Paul L.G. |editor2-last=Vlek |title=Land Use and Soil Resources |chapter-url={{google books|uV7Jp9Iz1hsC|plainurl=yes|page=9}} |publisher=Springer |location=Stockholm, Sweden  |date=2007 |isbn=978-1-4020-6777-8 |lccn=2007941782 |access-date=August 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modification of agricultural practices is a recognized method of carbon sequestration as soil can act as an effective carbon sink offsetting as much as 20% of 2010 carbon dioxide emissions annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/21/opinion/iowas-climate-change-wisdom.html?action%3Dclick%26pgtype%3DHomepage%26clickSource%3Dstory-heading%26module%3Dopinion-c-col-right-region%26region%3Dopinion-c-col-right-region%26WT.nav%3Dopinion-c-col-right-region%26_r%3D0 |title=Iowa’s Climate-Change Wisdom |newspaper=New York Times |accessdate=2015-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123211510/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/21/opinion/iowas-climate-change-wisdom.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=opinion-c-col-right-region&amp;region=opinion-c-col-right-region&amp;WT.nav=opinion-c-col-right-region&amp;_r=0 |archivedate=November 23, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  (See [[No-till]])

Carbon emission reduction methods in agriculture can be grouped into two categories: reducing and/or displacing emissions and enhancing carbon removal. Some of these reductions involve increasing the efficiency of farm operations (e.g. more fuel-efficient equipment) while some involve interruptions in the natural carbon cycle. Also, some effective techniques (such as the elimination of [[stubble burning]]) can negatively impact other environmental concerns (increased herbicide use to control weeds not destroyed by burning).

=== Deep Soil ===

Soils hold four times the amount of carbon stored in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tarnocai|first=C.|last2=Canadell|first2=J.G.|last3=Schuur|first3=E.A.G.|last4=Kuhry|first4=P.|last5=Mazhitova|first5=G.|last6=Zimov|first6=S.|date=2009-06-01|title=Soil organic carbon pools in the northern circumpolar permafrost region|journal=Global Biogeochemical Cycles|language=en|volume=23|issue=2|pages=GB2023|doi=10.1029/2008gb003327|issn=1944-9224|bibcode=2009GBioC..23.2023T}}&lt;/ref&gt; About half of this is found deep within soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmidt, Torn, Abiven, Dittmar, Guggenberger, Janssens, Kleber, Kogel-Knabner, Lehmann, Manning, Nannipieri, Rasse, Weiner, Trumbore|first=M.W.I., M.S., S., T., G., I.A., M., I., J., D.A.C., P.,  D.P., S., S.E.|date=2011|title=Persistence of soil organic matter as an ecosystem property|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc844476/m2/1/high_res_d/1051632.pdf|journal=Nature|volume=478|issue=7367|pages=49–56|via=|doi=10.1038/nature10386|pmid=21979045|bibcode=2011Natur.478...49S|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 90% of this deep soil C is stabilized by mineral-organic associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advances in Agronomy Chapter 1 Mineral - Organic Associations : Formation, Properties, and Relevance in Soil Environments|last=Kleber, Eusterhues, Keiluweit, Mikutta, Mikutta, S.

==== Reducing emissions ====
Increasing yields and efficiency generally reduces emissions as well, since more food results from the same or less effort. Techniques include more accurate use of [[fertilizer]]s, less soil disturbance, better [[irrigation]], and crop strains bred for locally beneficial traits and increased yields.

Replacing more energy [[intensive farming]] operations can also reduce emissions. Reduced or [[no-till farming]] requires less machine use and burns correspondingly less fuel per acre. However, no-till usually increases use of weed-control chemicals and the residue now left on the soil surface is more likely to release its {{chem|CO|2}} to the atmosphere as it decays, reducing the net carbon reduction.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

In practice, most farming operations that incorporate post-harvest crop residues, wastes and byproducts back into the soil provide a carbon storage benefit.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} This is particularly the case for practices such as field burning of stubble – rather than releasing almost all of the stored {{chem|CO|2}} to the atmosphere, tillage incorporates the biomass back into the soil.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==== Enhancing carbon removal ====
All crops absorb {{chem|CO|2}} during growth and release it after harvest. The goal of agricultural carbon removal is to use the crop and its relation to the carbon cycle to permanently sequester carbon within the soil. This is done by selecting farming methods that return biomass to the soil and enhance the conditions in which the carbon within the plants will be reduced to its elemental nature and stored in a stable state. Methods for accomplishing this include:
* Use [[cover crop]]s such as grasses and weeds as temporary cover between planting seasons
* Concentrate livestock in small paddocks for days at a time so they graze lightly but evenly. This encourages roots to grow deeper into the soil. Stock also till the soil with their hooves, grinding old grass and manures into the soil.&lt;ref name=australia&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSTRE55G01B20090617?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0&amp;sp=true |title=FACTBOX: Carbon farming on rise in Australia |work=Reuters |date=June 16, 2009 |accessdate=May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cover bare paddocks with hay or dead vegetation. This protects soil from the sun and allows the soil to hold more water and be more attractive to carbon-capturing microbes.&lt;ref name=australia/&gt;
* Restore degraded land, which slows carbon release while returning the land to agriculture or other use.

Agricultural sequestration practices may have positive effects on [[soil]], air, and water quality, be beneficial to [[wildlife]], and expand [[food production]]. On degraded [[croplands]], an increase of 1&amp;nbsp;ton of soil carbon pool may increase crop yield by 20 to 40&amp;nbsp;kilograms per hectare of [[wheat]], 10 to 20&amp;nbsp;kg/ ha for maize, and 0.5 to 1&amp;nbsp;kg/ha for [[cowpeas]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The effects of soil sequestration can be reversed. If the soil is disrupted or tillage practices are abandoned, the soil becomes a net source of greenhouse gases. Typically after 15 to 30&amp;nbsp;years of sequestration, soil becomes saturated and ceases to absorb carbon. This implies that there is a global limit to the amount of carbon that soil can hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sundermeiera |first1=A.P. |last2=Islam |first2=K.R. |last3=Raut |first3=Y. |last4=Reeder |first4=R.C. |last5=Dick |first5=W.A. |title=Continuous No-Till Impacts on Soil Biophysical Carbon Sequestration |journal=Soil Science Society of America Journal |volume=75 |issue=5 |pages=1779–1788 |date=September 2010 |doi=10.2136/sssaj2010.0334 |url=https://www.soils.org/publications/sssaj/abstracts/75/5/1779 |access-date=August 21, 2015|bibcode=2011SSASJ..75.1779S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many factors affect the costs of carbon sequestration including soil quality, transaction costs and various externalities such as leakage and unforeseen environmental damage. Because reduction of atmospheric {{chem|CO|2}} is a long-term concern, farmers can be reluctant to adopt more expensive agricultural techniques when there is not a clear crop, soil, or economic benefit.

Natural iron fertilisation events (e.g., deposition of iron-rich dust into ocean waters) can enhance carbon sequestration. Sperm whales act as agents of iron fertilisation when they transport iron from the deep ocean to the surface during prey consumption and defecation. Sperm whales have been shown to increase the levels of primary production and carbon export to the deep ocean by depositing iron rich feces into surface waters of the Southern Ocean. The iron rich feces causes phytoplankton to grow and take up more carbon from the atmosphere. When the phytoplankton dies, some of it sinks to the deep ocean and takes the atmospheric carbon with it. By reducing the abundance of sperm whales in the Southern Ocean, whaling has resulted in an extra 200,000 tonnes of carbon remaining in the atmosphere each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lavery |first1=Trish J. |last2=Roudnew |first2=Ben |last3=Gill |first3=Peter |date=October 11, 2010 |title=Iron defecation by sperm whales stimulates carbon export in the Southern Ocean |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/277/1699/3527 |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume=277 |issue=1699 |pages=3527–3531 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2010.0863 |pmid=20554546 |pmc=2982231 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ian Jones (scientist)|Ian Jones]] proposes fertilizing the ocean with [[urea]], a [[nitrogen]] rich substance, to encourage [[phytoplankton]] growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/6369401.stm|title=Multiplying the ocean's CO2 guzzlers|date=February 19, 2007|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian company Ocean Nourishment Corporation (ONC) plans to sink hundreds of tonnes of urea into the ocean to boost {{chem|CO|2}}-absorbing phytoplankton growth as a way to combat climate change. In 2007, Sydney-based ONC completed an experiment involving 1&amp;nbsp;tonne of nitrogen in the Sulu Sea off the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2007/11/09/2085584.htm |title=Urea 'climate solution' may backfire |work=ABC Science |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Commission |first=Anna |last=Salleh |date=November 9, 2007 |accessdate=May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mixing layers ====
Encouraging various ocean layers to mix can move nutrients and dissolved gases around, offering avenues for [[climate engineering|geoengineering]].&lt;ref name=Lovelock07/&gt; Mixing may be achieved by placing large vertical pipes in the oceans to pump nutrient rich water to the surface, triggering [[algal blooms|blooms of algae]], which store carbon when they grow and export carbon when they die.&lt;ref name=Lovelock07&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lovelock |first1=James E. |last2=Rapley |first2=Chris G. |authorlink2=Chris Rapley |title=Ocean pipes could help the earth to cure itself |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v449/n7161/full/449403a.html |journal=Nature |volume=449 |issue=7161 |page=403 |date=September 27, 2007 |pmid=17898747 |doi=10.1038/449403a |bibcode=2007Natur.449..403L |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12698 |title=Ocean pumps could counter global warming |journal=New Scientist |date=September 26, 2007 |first=Fred |last=Pearce |accessdate=May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A proposal to force vertical mixing of the Pacific Equatorial Undercurrent to create a system of equatorially trapped coupled convection that counteracts global warming |url=http://www.johnduke.com/JDukeETCC09052007.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Geophysical Research Abstracts |year=2008 |last=Duke |first=John H. |accessdate=May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This produces results somewhat similar to iron fertilization.

The mechanisms related to biochar are referred to as [[bio-energy with carbon capture and storage|bio-energy with carbon storage]], BECS.

=== Ocean storage ===
If CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were to be injected to the ocean bottom, the pressures would be great enough for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be in its liquid phase.  The idea behind ocean injection would be to have stable, stationary pools of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at the ocean floor.  The ocean could potentially hold over a thousand billion tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. However, this avenue of sequestration isn’t being as actively pursued because of concerns about the impact on ocean life, and concerns about its stability.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benson|first=S.M.|last2=Surles|first2=T.|date=2006-10-01|title=Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage: An Overview With Emphasis on Capture and Storage in Deep Geological Formations|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=4016413|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|volume=94|issue=10|pages=1795–1805|doi=10.1109/JPROC.2006.883718|issn=0018-9219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

River mouths bring large quantities of nutrients and dead material from upriver into the ocean as part of the process that eventually produces fossil fuels. Transporting material such as crop waste out to sea and allowing it to sink exploits this idea to increase carbon storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es8015556 |title=Ocean Sequestration of Crop Residue Carbon: Recycling Fossil Fuel Carbon Back to Deep Sediments |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |first2=Gregory |last2=Benford |volume=43 |author=Stuart E.

=== Geological sequestration ===
{{Main|Carbon capture and storage}}

Geological sequestration refers to the storage of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; underground in depleted oil and gas reservoirs, saline formations, or deep, un-minable coal beds.

Once CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is captured from a gas or coal-fired power plant, it would be compressed to ≈100 bar so that it would be a supercritical fluid.  In this fluid form, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; would be easy to transport via pipeline to the place of storage.  The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; would then be injected deep underground, typically around 1&amp;nbsp;km, where it would be stable for hundreds to millions of years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At these storage conditions, the density of supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is 600 to 800&amp;nbsp;kg / m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aydin|first=Gokhan|last2=Karakurt|first2=Izzet|last3=Aydiner|first3=Kerim|date=2010-09-01|title=Evaluation of geologic storage options of CO2: Applicability, cost, storage capacity and safety|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421510003095|journal=Energy Policy|series=Special Section on Carbon Emissions and Carbon Management in Cities with Regular Papers|volume=38|issue=9|pages=5072–5080|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2010.04.035}}&lt;/ref&gt; For consumers, the cost of electricity from a coal-fired power plant with carbon capture and storage (CCS) is estimated to be 0.01–0.05 $ / kWh higher than without CCS. For reference, the average cost of electricity in the US in 2004 was 0.0762 $ / kWh. In other terms, the cost of CCS would be 20–70 $/ton of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; captured. The transportation and injection of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is relatively cheap, with the capture costs accounting for 70–80% of CCS costs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The important parameters in determining a good site for carbon storage are: rock porosity, rock permeability, absence of faults, and geometry of rock layers.  The medium in which the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is to be stored ideally has a high porosity and permeability, such as sandstone or limestone. Sandstone can have a permeability ranging from 1 to 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; Darcy, and can have a porosity as high as ≈30%. The porous rock must be capped by a layer of low permeability which acts as a seal, or caprock, for the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Shale is an example of a very good caprock, with a permeability of 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; Darcy. Once injected, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; plume will rise via buoyant forces, since it is less dense than its surroundings. Once it encounters a caprock, it will spread laterally until it encounters a gap. If there are fault planes near the injection zone, there is a possibility the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; could migrate along the fault to the surface, leaking into the atmosphere, which would be potentially dangerous to life in the surrounding area. Another danger related to carbon sequestration is induced seismicity. If the injection of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; creates pressures that are too high underground, the formation will fracture, causing an earthquake.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Smit, Berend; Reimer, Jeffrey A.; Oldenburg, Curtis M.; Bourg, Ian C. (2014). ''Introduction to Carbon Capture and Sequestration''. London: Imperial College Press. {{ISBN|978-1783263288}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While trapped in a rock formation, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be in the supercritical fluid phase or dissolve in groundwater/brine.  It can also react with minerals in the geologic formation to precipitate carbonates. See [[CarbFix]].

Worldwide storage capacity in oil and gas reservoirs is estimated to be 675–900 Gt CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and in un-minable coal seams is estimated to be 15–200 Gt CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Deep saline formations have the largest capacity, which is estimated to be 1,000–10,000 Gt CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the US, there is an estimated 160 Gt CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; storage capacity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

There are a number of large-scale carbon capture and sequestration projects that have demonstrated the viability and safety of this method of carbon storage, which are summarized here &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/projects/large-scale-ccs-projects#overview|title=Large-scale CCS facilities |publisher= Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute|website=www.globalccsinstitute.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Global CCS Institute. The dominant monitoring technique is seismic imaging, where vibrations are generated that propagate through the subsurface.  The geologic structure can be imaged from the refracted/reflected waves.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The first large-scale {{chem|CO|2}} sequestration project which began in 1996 is called [[Sleipner gas field|Sleipner]], and is located in the [[North Sea]] where Norway's [[StatoilHydro]] strips carbon dioxide from [[natural gas]] with [[amine]] [[solvent]]s and disposed of this carbon dioxide in a deep [[saline water|saline]] [[aquifer]]. In 2000, a coal-fueled [[synthetic natural gas]] plant in [[Beulah, North Dakota]], became the world's first coal-using plant to capture and store carbon dioxide, at the [[Weyburn-Midale Carbon Dioxide Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Weyburn-Midale {{chem|CO|2}} Project, World's first {{chem|CO|2}} measuring, monitoring and verification initiative | url=http://www.ptrc.ca/weyburn_overview.php | publisher= Petroleum Technology Research Centre| accessdate=April 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{chem|CO|2}} has been used extensively in enhanced [[crude oil]] recovery operations in the [[United States]] beginning in 1972.&lt;ref name=Hodrien/&gt; There are in excess of 10,000 wells that inject {{chem|CO|2}} in the state of [[Texas]] alone. The gas comes in part from anthropogenic sources, but is principally from large naturally occurring geologic formations of {{chem|CO|2}}. It is transported to the oil-producing fields through a large network of over {{convert|5000|km}} of {{chem|CO|2}} pipelines.

=== Mineral carbonation ===
Carbon, in the form of {{chem|CO|2}} can be removed from the atmosphere by chemical processes, and stored in stable [[carbonate mineral]] forms. This process is known as 'carbon sequestration by mineral [[carbonation]]' or mineral sequestration. The process involves reacting carbon dioxide with abundantly available metal oxides–either [[magnesium oxide]] (MgO) or [[calcium oxide]] (CaO)–to form stable carbonates. These reactions are [[exothermic]] and occur naturally (e.g., the [[weathering]] of rock over [[geologic time]] periods).&lt;ref name=herzog/&gt;&lt;ref name=goldberg&gt;{{Cite journal

:CaO + {{chem|CO|2}} → {{chem|CaCO|3}}

:MgO + {{chem|CO|2}} → {{chem|MgCO|3}}

Calcium and magnesium are found in nature typically as calcium and magnesium [[silicate minerals|silicates]] (such as [[forsterite]] and [[serpentinite]]) and not as binary oxides. For forsterite and serpentine the reactions are:
:{{chem|Mg|2|SiO|4}} + 2 {{chem|CO|2}} → 2 {{chem|MgCO|3}} + {{chem|SiO|2}}

:{{chem|Mg|3|Si|2|O|5|(OH)|4}}+ 3 {{chem|CO|2}} → 3 {{chem|MgCO|3}} + 2 {{chem|SiO|2}} + 2 {{chem|H|2|O}}

The following table lists principal metal oxides of [[Crust (geology)|Earth's crust]]. Theoretically up to 22% of this mineral mass is able to form [[carbonate]]s.

&lt;/ref&gt; This process occurs naturally over geologic time frames and is responsible for much of the Earth's surface [[limestone]]. The reaction rate can be made faster however, by reacting at higher temperatures and/or pressures, although this method requires some additional energy.

Researchers from [[British Columbia]], developed a low cost process for the production of [[magnesite]], also known as [[magnesium carbonate]], which can sequester CO2 from the air, or at the point of air pollution, eg. at a power plant.

Various [[carbon dioxide scrubber|carbon dioxide scrubbing]] processes have been proposed to remove {{chem|CO|2}} from the air, usually using a variant of the [[Kraft process]].

=== Ocean-related ===

==== Basalt storage ====
Carbon dioxide sequestration in [[basalt]] involves the injecting of {{chem|CO|2}} into deep-sea formations. The {{chem|CO|2}} first mixes with seawater and then reacts with the basalt, both of which are alkaline-rich elements. This reaction results in the release of {{chem|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{chem|Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;}} ions forming stable carbonate minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0804397105 |author1=David S. Goldberg |author2=Taro Takahashi |author3=Angela L. Slagle |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/105/29/9920.full |title=Carbon dioxide sequestration in deep-sea basalt|volume=105 |issue=29 |journal=Proc.

Underwater basalt offers a good alternative to other forms of oceanic carbon storage because it has a number of trapping measures to ensure added protection against leakage. These measures include “geochemical, sediment, gravitational and [[hydrate]] formation.” Because {{chem|CO|2}} hydrate is denser than {{chem|CO|2}} in seawater, the risk of leakage is minimal. Injecting the {{chem|CO|2}} at depths greater than {{convert|2700|m|ft|sp=us}} ensures that the {{chem|CO|2}} has a greater density than seawater, causing it to sink.&lt;ref name="environmentalresearchweb.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://environmentalresearchweb.org/cws/article/futures/35017 |title=Carbon storage in undersea basalt offers extra security |publisher=environmentalresearchweb |date=July 15, 2008|accessdate=May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One possible injection site is [[Juan de Fuca plate]]. Researchers at the [[Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory]] found that this plate at the western coast of the United States has a possible storage capacity of 208 gigatons. This could cover the entire [[Greenhouse gas emissions by the United States|current U.S. carbon emissions]] for over 100&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name="environmentalresearchweb.org"/&gt;

This process is undergoing tests as part of the [[CarbFix]] project, resulting in 95% of the injected 250 tonnes of CO2 to solidify into [[calcite]] in 2 years, using 25 tonnes of water per tonne of CO2.&lt;ref name=Matter/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/10/11901368/carbon-dioxide-capture-storage-stone-climate-change-study|title=Scientists turn carbon dioxide into stone to combat global warming|date=10 June 2016|publisher=Vox Media|work=The Verge|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--under ocean?--&gt;

==== Acid neutralisation ====
Carbon dioxide forms [[carbonic acid]] when dissolved in water, so [[ocean acidification]] is a significant consequence of elevated carbon dioxide levels, and limits the rate at which it can be absorbed into the ocean (the [[solubility pump]]).  A variety of different [[base (chemistry)|bases]] have been suggested that could neutralize the acid and thus increase {{chem|CO|2}} absorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0360-5442(95)00035-F |author=Kheshgi, H.S. |title=Sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide by increasing ocean alkalinity |journal=Energy |volume=20 |pages=915–922 |year=1995 |issue=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0360-5442(95)00071-N |author1=K.S.

== Obstruction ==

=== Danger of leaks ===
Carbon dioxide may be stored deep underground.  At depth, [[hydrostatic pressure]] acts to keep it in a liquid state. Reservoir design faults, rock fissures and tectonic processes may act to release the gas stored into the ocean or atmosphere.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

=== Financial costs ===
The use of the technology would add an additional 1–5 cents of cost per kilowatt hour, according to estimate made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The financial costs of modern coal technology would nearly double if use of CCS technology were to be required by regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=DeMonte |first=Adena |title=The Cost of Carbon Capture |date=July 2007 |website=Gigaom |url=https://gigaom.com/2007/07/30/the-cost-of-carbon-capture/ |access-date=August 21, 2015}}{{unreliable source? |date=August 2015 |reason=This seems to be a blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cost of CCS technology differs with the different types of capture technologies being used and with the different sites that it is implemented in, but the costs tend to increase with CCS capture implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gibbins|first1=Jon|last2=Chalmers|first2=Hannah|title=Carbon Capture and Storage|journal=Energy Policy|date=December 2008|volume=36|issue=12|pages=4317–4322|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2008.09.058|url=http://curryja.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/rutt_bridges_article.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.370.8479}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study conducted predicted that with new technologies these costs could be lowered but would remain slightly higher than prices without CCS technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=David|first1=Jeremy|last2=Herzog|first2=Howard|title=The Cost of Carbon Capture|journal=BASE|date=2012|url=https://sequestration.mit.edu/pdf/David_and_Herzog.pdf|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy requirements ===
The energy requirements of sequestration processes may be significant. In one paper, sequestration consumed 25 percent of the plant's rated 600 megawatt output capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=https://bioenergykdf.net/sites/default/files/zpdfzholderz/NREL_Data/KC_091102094516.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Net Energy and Global Warming Potential of Biomass Power compared to Coal-fired Electricity with CO2 Sequestration – A Life Cycle Approach |first1=Pamela L. |last1=Spath |first2=Margaret K. |last2=Mann |conference=Bioenergy 2002 Bioenergy for the Environment |location=Boise, Idaho |date=September 22, 2002 |access-date=August 21, 2015 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Colonization ''' (or '''colonisation''') is a process by which a central system of power dominates the surrounding land and its components.

The term is derived from the Latin word '''colere''', which means "to inhabit".&lt;ref name="Steele03"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Colonization of Unfamiliar Landscapes |author1=Marcy Rockman |author2=James Steele |year= 2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-25606-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, colonization refers strictly to migration, for example, to [[settler]] colonies in America or Australia, [[trading post]]s, and [[plantation]]s, while [[colonialism]] to the existing [[indigenous peoples]] of styled "new territories".

Colonization was linked to the spread of tens of millions from Western European states all over the world. In many settled colonies, Western European settlers eventually formed a large majority of the population after killing or driving away indigenous peoples. Examples include the Americas, Australia and New Zealand. These colonies were occasionally called 'neo-Europes'. In other places, Western European settlers formed minority groups, which often used more advanced weaponry to dominate the people initially living in their places of settlement.&lt;ref name=EI&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howe|first1=Stephen|title=Empire: A Very Short Introduction|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=United States|pages=21–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Britain started to [[Colonization of Australia|settle in Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and various other smaller islands, they often regarded the landmasses as ''[[terra nullius]]'', meaning 'empty land' in Latin.&lt;ref name=PG&gt;{{cite book|last1=Painter|first1=Joe|last2=Jeffrey|first2=Alex|title=Political Geography|date=2009|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd.|location=London, GBR|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the absence of European farming techniques, the land was deemed unaltered by man and therefore treated as uninhabited, despite the presence of indigenous populations. In the 19th century, laws and ideas such as [[Mexico]]'s [[general Colonization Law]] and the [[United States|United States']] [[Manifest destiny]] encouraged further [[colonization of the Americas]], already started in the 15th century.

== Historical colonizations ==

=== Classical period ===

In ancient times, maritime nations such as the city-states of [[Greece]] and [[Phoenicia]] often established colonies to farm what they believed was uninhabited land. Land suitable for farming was often occupied by migratory '[[barbarian]] tribes' who lived by hunting and gathering. To ancient Greeks and Phoenicians, these lands were regarded as simply vacant. However, this did not mean that conflict did not exist between the colonizers and local/native peoples. Greeks and Phoenicians also established colonies with the intent of regulating and expanding trade throughout the Mediterranean and Middle East.

Another period of colonization in ancient times was during the [[Roman Empire]]. The Roman Empire conquered large parts of [[Western Europe]], [[North Africa]] and [[West Asia]]. In North Africa and West Asia, the Romans often conquered what they regarded as 'civilized' peoples. As they moved north into Europe, they mostly encountered rural peoples/tribes with very little in the way of cities. In these areas, waves of Roman colonization often followed the conquest of the areas. Many of the current cities throughout Europe began as Roman colonies, such as [[Cologne]], Germany, originally called ''[[Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium]]'' by the Romans, and the [[United Kingdom|British]] capital city of [[London]], which the Romans founded as ''[[Londinium]]''.

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:Colonisation 1550.png|thumb|right|100|World empires and colonies 1550]]
[[File:Colonial empires in 1800.svg|thumb|World empires and colonies 1800]]
The decline and collapse of the Roman Empire saw (and was partly caused by) the large-scale movement of people in [[Eastern Europe]] and Asia. This is largely seen as beginning with nomadic horsemen from Asia (specifically the [[Huns]]) moving into the richer pasture land to the west, thus forcing the local peoples there to move further west and so on until eventually the [[Goths]] were forced to cross into the Roman Empire, resulting in continuous war with Rome which played a major role in the fall of the Roman Empire. During this period there were the large-scale movements of peoples establishing new colonies all over western Europe.  The events of this time saw the development of many of the modern day nations of Europe like the [[Franks]] in France and Germany and the [[Anglo-Saxons]] in England.

In West Asia, during [[Sassanid Empire]], some Persians established colonies in [[Yemen]] and [[Oman]]. The [[Arabs]] also established colonies in [[Northern Africa]], [[Mesopotamia]], and the [[Levant]], and remain the dominant majority to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Pact Of Umar

The Arabs, to whom he had brought it, were similarly restricted, with perhaps some extension in the borderlands of the Fertile Crescent.  The vast lands in southwest Asia, northern Africa, and elsewhere, which in later times came to constitute the lands of Islam, the realms of the caliphs and, in modern parlance, the Arab world, still spoke other languages, professed other religions, and obeyed other rulers. Within little more than a century after the Prophet’s death, the whole area had been transformed, in what was surely one of the swiftest and most dramatic changes in the whole of human history.  By the late seventh century, the outside world attests the emergence of a new religion and a new power, the Muslim empire of the caliphs, extending eastward in Asia as far as and sometimes beyond the borders of India and China, westwards along the southern Mediterranean coast to the Atlantic, southwards towards the land of the black peoples in Africa, northwards into the lands of the white peoples of Europe. In this empire, Islam was the state religion, and the Arabic language was rapidly displacing others to become the principal medium public life." Lewis, Bernard. THE MIDDLE EAST: A Brief History of the Last 2,000 Years, Touchstone Simon and Schuster, New York, 1995. pp 54-55&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vikings]] of [[Scandinavia]] also carried out a large-scale colonization. The Vikings are best known as raiders, setting out from their original homelands in [[Denmark]], southern [[Norway]] and southern [[Sweden]], to pillage the coastlines of northern Europe. In time, the Vikings began trading, and established colonies. The Vikings discovered [[Iceland]] and established colonies before moving onto [[Greenland]], where they briefly held some colonies. The Vikings launched an unsuccessful attempt at colonizing an area they called [[Vinland]], which is probably at a site now known as [[L'Anse aux Meadows]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], on the eastern coastline of [[Canada]].

=== Modern "Colonial Era" colonialism ===
{{main article|Colonialism}}

"Colonialism" in this context refers mostly to Western European countries' colonization of lands mainly in the Americas,  Africa, Asia and Oceania;  The main European countries active in this form of colonization included [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[France]], the [[Kingdom of England]] (later the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]), the [[Netherlands]], and the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (Now Germany), and beginning in the 18th century, the [[United States]]. Most of these countries had a period of almost complete power in world trade at some stage in the era from roughly 1500 to 1900. Beginning in the late 19th century, [[Imperial Japan]] also engaged in settler colonization, most notably in [[Hokkaido]] and [[Korea]].

Some reports characterize [[China|Chinese]] activities in [[Tibet]] as colonization.&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Tibetan Stonewall of China'', {{ISBN|1902681118}}, page 141

&lt;/ref&gt;

While many European colonization schemes focused on shorter-term exploitation of economic opportunities ([[Newfoundland Colony|Newfoundland]], for example, or [[Siberia]]) or addressed specific goals ([[Massachusetts]] or [[New South Wales]]), a tradition developed of careful long-term social and economic planning for both parties, but more on the colonizing countries themselves, based on elaborate theory-building (note [[James Oglethorpe]]'s [[Colony of Georgia]] in the 1730s and [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]]'s [[New Zealand Company|New Zealand]] in the 1840s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Modern colonization ==

[[File:World 1936 empires colonies territory.png|thumb|right|100|World empires and colonies 1936]]
Colonization may be used as a method of absorbing and assimilating foreign people into the culture of the imperial country, and thus destroying any remnant of the cultures that might threaten the imperial territory over the long term by inspiring reform.

===Russia===
During the [[Russian Empire]], a policy of [[Russification]] was followed, in order to impose the Russian language and culture on conquered people in territory adjacent to Russia itself. In this way, the Russian Empire aimed to gradually, and permanently, expand its territory by erasing foreign cultures{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}. Foreign languages within its territory were banned, as were foreign religions.

The Soviet regime in the 1920s tried to win the trust of non-Russians by promoting their ethnic cultures and establishing for them many of the characteristic institutional forms of the nation-state.&lt;ref name="Terry Martin 2001 1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Terry Martin|title=The Affirmative Action Empire: Nations and Nationalism in the Soviet Union, 1923-1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rdlSX2hsb1kC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22institutional%20forms%20of%20the%20nation-state%22&amp;f=false|year=2001|publisher=Cornell University press|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early Soviet regime was hostile to even voluntary assimilation, and tried to derussify assimilated non-Russians.&lt;ref name="Terry Martin 2001 32"&gt;{{cite book|author=Terry Martin|title=The Affirmative Action Empire: Nations and Nationalism in the Soviet Union, 1923-1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rdlSX2hsb1kC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=snippet&amp;q=%22measures%20of%20derussification%22&amp;f=false|year=2001|publisher=Cornell University press|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents and students not interested in the promotion of their national languages were labeled as displaying "abnormal attitudes". The authorities concluded that minorities unaware of their ethnicities had to be subjected to Belarusization, Yiddishization, Polonization etc.&lt;ref name="Per Anders Rudling 2014 212"&gt;{{cite book|author=Per Anders Rudling|title=The Rise and Fall of Belarusian Nationalism, 1906–1931|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rRrRBgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22abnormal%20attitudes%22&amp;f=false|year=2014|publisher=University of Pittsburgh press|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1930s this extreme multiculturalist policy proved unworkable and the Soviet regime introduced a limited russification&lt;ref name="Richard Overy 2004 558"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Overy|title=The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=32Vy2Fj4KFUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=richard+overy+dictators&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22limited%20russification%22&amp;f=false|year=2004|publisher=W.W Norton Company, Inc|page=558}}&lt;/ref&gt; for practical reasons; voluntary assimilation, which was often a popular demand,&lt;ref name="Terry Martin 2001 409"&gt;{{cite book|author=Terry Martin|title=The Affirmative Action Empire: Nations and Nationalism in the Soviet Union, 1923-1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rdlSX2hsb1kC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22long-standing%20popular%20demand%22&amp;f=false|year=2001|publisher=Cornell University press|page=409}}&lt;/ref&gt; was allowed. The list of nationalities was reduced from 172 in 1927 to 98 in 1939&lt;ref name="Richard Overy 2004 556"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Overy|title=The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=32Vy2Fj4KFUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=richard+overy+dictators&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22limited%20russification%22&amp;f=false|year=2004|publisher=W.W Norton Company, Inc|page=556}}&lt;/ref&gt; by revoking support for small nations in order to merge them into bigger ones. For example, [[Abkhazia]] was merged into Georgia and thousands of ethnic Georgians were sent to Abkhazia.&lt;ref name="George Hewitt 1999 96"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Hewitt|title=The Abkhazians: A Handbook|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=-YUfAgAAQBAJ|year=1999|publisher=Curzon Press|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Abkhaz alphabet was changed to a Georgian base, Abkhazian schools were closed and replaced with Georgian schools, the Abkhaz language was banned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abkhazworld.com/aw/history/643-summary-of-historical-events Summary of Historical Events in Abkhazian History, 1810-1993] ''Abkhaz World'', 15 October 2008, retrieved 11 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling elite was purged of ethnic Abkhaz and by 1952 over 80% of the 228 top party and government officials and enterprise managers in Abkhazia were ethnic Georgians (there remained 34 Abkhaz, 7 Russians and 3 Armenians in these positions).&lt;ref&gt;[http://abkhazworld.com/aw/history/499-stalin-beria-terror-in-abkhazia-1936-53-by-stephen-shenfield The Stalin-Beria Terror in Abkhazia, 1936-1953, by Stephen D. Shenfield] ''Abkhaz World'', 30 June 2010, retrieved 11 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Russians were now presented as the most advanced and least chauvinist people of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Richard Overy 2004 558"/&gt;

Ethnic Russians were sent to colonize captured territory such as [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}, while local languages, religions and customs were banned or suppressed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union]] was also used both as a military strategy to extinguish opposition to Soviet expansion{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}, and as a continuation of the Russification policy of assimilating{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}, or failing that, eliminating ethnic minorities{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} through exile to a distant territory such as [[Siberia]].

====Jewish oblast====
[[File:Government-hq.jpg|thumb|upright|Sign on the JAO government headquarters.]]
In 1934, the Soviet government established the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]] in the Soviet Far East to create a homeland for the Jewish people. Another motive was to strengthen Soviet presence along the vulnerable eastern border. The region was often infiltrated by the Chinese; in 1927, Chiang-Kai-Shek had ended [[First United Front|cooperation with the Chinese Communist Party]], which further increased the threat. Fascist Japan also seemed willing and ready to detach the Far Eastern provinces from the USSR.&lt;ref name="Nora Levin 1990 283"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nora Levin|title=The Jews in the Soviet Union Since 1917: Paradox of Survival, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=1Nz0N5GBW6MC|year=1990|publisher=New York University Press|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; To make settlement of the inhospitable and undeveloped region more enticing, the Soviet government allowed private ownership of land. This led to many non-Jews to settle in the oblast to get a free farm.&lt;ref name="Richard Overy 2004 567"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Overy|title=The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=32Vy2Fj4KFUC|year=2004|publisher=W.W Norton Company, Inc|page=567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1930s, a massive propaganda campaign developed to induce more Jewish settlers to move there. In one instance, a government-produced Yiddish film called ''[[Seekers of Happiness]]'' told the story of a Jewish family that fled the [[Great Depression]] in the [[United States]] to make a new life for itself in Birobidzhan. Some 1,200 non-Soviet Jews chose to settle in Birobidzhan.&lt;ref name="jewishmag.com"&gt;Arthur Rosen, [www./75mag/birobidzhan/birobidzhan.htm], February 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish population peaked in 1948 at around 30,000, about one-quarter of the region's population. By 2010, according to data provided by the Russian Census Bureau, there were  only 1,628 people of Jewish descent remaining in the JAO (1% of the total population), while ethnic Russians made up 92.7% of the JAO population.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/population/demo/per-itog/tab7.xls |title=Информационные материалы об окончательных итогах Всероссийской переписи населения 2010 года |accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The JAO is Russia's only [[autonomous oblast]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of the Russian Federation]], Article 65&lt;/ref&gt; and, aside of Israel, the world's only Jewish territory with an official status.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite journal|author=Спектор Р., руководитель Департамента Евро-Азиатского Еврейского конгресса (ЕАЕК) по связям с общественностью и СМИ|title=Биробиджан — terra incognita?|оригинал=|url=http://www.nasledie-eao.ru/services/nayka/scientific-practical-conference/bir_proekt_konf_2007.pdf#page=18|editor=под ред.

===Expatriate colonies===
Mass migrations such as [[Chinese emigration]] or the [[British diaspora]] or [[German diaspora]] have resulted in colonies abroad. In some cases, [[expatriate]] niches set up permanently in target countries masked under the spread of "religion and culture". The intentions behind the movement and settling of expatriates and in many cases (especially when not gathered into a niche ''per se'') expatriates do not necessarily seek to "expand their native civilization", but rather to [[Racial integration|integrate]] into the population of the new civilization for economic purposes. It must be recognized that expatriates are different from [[exiles]] and often there is very little if no relationship between them. Exiles are more often than not diasporic or displaced communities or persons who have fled their native territory or homeland to somewhere else and are usually in this position due to the results of war or other major political upheavals and sometimes this includes the influence of colonization.

===Subject peoples===
Many human colonists came to colonies for [[Slavery|slaves]] to their colonizing countries, so the legal power to leave or remain may not be the issue so much as the actual presence of the people in the new country. This left the indigenous natives of their lands "slaves" in their own countries.

The [[Canadian Indian residential school system]] was identified by the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)]] as colonization through depriving the youth of First Nations in Canada of their languages and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Honouring the Truth, Reconciling for the Future: Summary of the Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada|last=The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada|first=|publisher=Government of Canada|year=2015|isbn=978-0-660-02078-5|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid 20th century, there was the most dramatic and devastating attempt at colonization, and that was pursued with Nazism.&lt;ref name="EI2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howe|first1=Stephen|title=Empire: A Very Short Introduction|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=United States|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler and Heinrich Himmler and their supporters schemed for a mass migration of Germans to Eastern Europe, where some of the Germans were to become colonists, having control over the native people.&lt;ref name="EI2" /&gt; These indigenous people were planned to be reduced to slaves or wholly annihilated.&lt;ref name="EI2" /&gt;

Many advanced nations currently have large numbers of [[guest worker]]s/[[temporary work]] visa holders who are brought in to do seasonal work such as harvesting or to do low-paid manual labor. Guest workers or contractors have a lower status than workers with visas, because guest workers can be removed at any time for any reason.

===Endo-colonization===
Colonization may be a domestic strategy when there is a widespread security threat within a nation and weapons are turned inward, as noted by [[Paul Virilio]]:
:Obsession with security results in the ''endo-colonization'' of society: endo-colonization is the use of increasingly powerful and ubiquitous technologies of security turned ''inward'', to attempt to secure the fast and messy circulations of our globalizing, networked society…it is the increasing domination of public life with stories of dangerous otherness and suspicion…&lt;ref&gt;Mark Lacy (2014) ''Security, Technology and Global Politics, thinking with Virilio'', page 20, Routledge {{ISBN|978-0-415-57604-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some instances of the burden of endo-colonization have been noted:
:The acute difficulties of the Latin American and southern European military-bureaucratic dictatorships in the seventies and early eighties and the Soviet Union in the late eighties can in large part be attributed to the economic, political and social contradictions induced by endo-colonizing militarism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Luke]] &amp; [[Gearoid O Tuathail]] (2000) "Thinking Geopolitical Space: The spatiality of war, speed and vision in the work of Paul Virilio", in ''Thinking Space'', [[Mike Crang]] &amp; [[Nigel Thrift]] editors, [[Routledge]], quote page  368&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothetical permanent habitation of locations in Earth's [[ocean]]s is called ''[[ocean colonization]]''.

Related ideas such as the [[Very large floating structure|floating city]] are much less hypothetical - funds are presently being sought to build several large ships that would have permanent populations of up to 50,000 people each.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Space colonization===
{{main article|Space colonization}}

In [[science fiction]], [[space colonization]] is sometimes more benign. Humans find an uninhabited planet, and inhabit it. The [[colonization of Mars]] is an often-used example of this type of space colonization. In more recent science fiction, humans may create habitable space (by [[terraforming]] or constructing a space habitat) and call that a "colony".

On the other hand, if a planet were found to be already inhabited, much less benign consequences ensue: indeed, some science fiction authors have used the colonization of alien planets by humans, or the colonization of [[Earth]] by aliens, to explore the real-world issues surrounding the phenomenon. Such works include those of [[Mary Doria Russell]], ''The Sparrow'' and ''Children of God''.

The ultimate form of space colonization is the [[Kardashev scale]] which assumes that a single dominant civilization will take over all energy on one planet, then one star, then a whole galaxy full of stars. However, this would not necessarily be so if other species were to be discovered during a galactic expansion. This may require more than one species to share the galactic space with each other as they both develop.

'''The Commonwealth Local Government Forum''' ('''CLGF''') is a global local government organisation, bringing together local authorities, their national associations and the ministries responsible for local government in the member countries of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. CLGF works with national and [[local government]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s to support the development of [[Democracy|democratic values]] and good local governance and is the [[Associated Organisation of the Commonwealth|associated organisation]] officially recognised by [[Commonwealth Heads of Government]] as the representative body for local government in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecommonwealth.org/organisation/commonwealth-local-government-forum-clgf|title=Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF) {{!}} The Commonwealth|last=|first=|date=|website=thecommonwealth.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CLGF is unique in bringing together central, provincial and local spheres of government involved in local government policy and decision-making. CLGF members include local government associations, individual local authorities, ministries dealing with local government, and research and professional organisations who work with local government. Practitioner to practitioner support is at the core of CLGF's work across the Commonwealth and within the region, using CLGF's own members to support others both within and between regions.

==History==

CLGF was founded in 1995 and its establishment was endorsed by Commonwealth Heads of Government at their meeting in New Zealand later that year. It has received further endorsement at subsequent [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]]s and in 2003 was given official recognition as an associated Commonwealth organisation of elected representatives. At the 2005 Commonwealth Local Government Conference held in Aberdeen, the members of CLGF endorsed the [[Aberdeen Agenda: Commonwealth principles for local democracy and good governance]] which we're endorsed later that year by the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2005|Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] held in Malta, and in 2013 incorporated in the [[Charter of the Commonwealth]].

==Partnerships==

CLGF works closely with other [[Commonwealth]] and [[International organization|international organisations]] such as the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]], the [[Commonwealth Foundation]], the [[Commonwealth Parliamentary Association]] and the [[United Nations]], including [[United Nations Human Settlements Programme|UN-Habitat]] and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] ([[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]]), to promote and support democratic local government in the Commonwealth and to ensure that local government is recognised as an important sphere of government in development. CLGF is a member of the [[Global Taskforce of Local and Regional Governments]] along with its fellow global local government organisation to including [[United Cities and Local Governments|UCLG,]]  [[United Nations Advisory Committee for Local Authorities|UNACLA]], [[ICLEI]],  [[L'Association internationale des maires francophones|IAFM,]] [[Arab Towns Organization|ATO,]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;and [[C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group|C40]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gtf2016.org/about-us|title=globaltaskforce2016|website=globaltaskforce2016|access-date=2016-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also a member of [[Cities Alliance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.citiesalliance.org/our-members|title=Our Members {{!}} Cities Alliance|date=2011-08-09|website=www.citiesalliance.org|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Organisation==
The CLGF secretariat is housed in the [[Commonwealth hub]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecommonwealth.org/media/press-release/queen-launches-new-commonwealth-hub|title=The Queen launches new Commonwealth Hub {{!}} The Commonwealth|last=|first=|date=|website=thecommonwealth.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Pall Mall, London and has regional offices in the Caribbean, West Africa, Southern Africa, South Asia and the Pacific, and country programme offices in Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. The current Chair of CLGF is Cllr. Mpho Moruakgomo, President of [[Botswana Association of Local Authorities|BALA]] and Secretary-General is Dr Greg Munro, who took over from the founding Secretary-General [[Carl Wright (civil servant)|Dr Carl Wright]] in 2016. CLGF patrons include former UNDP Administrator and New Zealand Prime Minister Rt Hon. [[Helen Clark]] and Tuvaluan Prime Minister [[Enele Sopoaga]].

==Commonwealth Local Government Conferences==
CLGF organises a pan-Commonwealth biennial conference bringing together is members and partners

The last conference will be held in November 2017 in Valletta, Malta on the theme of '[http://www.clgf.org.uk/default/assets/File/CLGF_statements/CLGC17_Valletta_Outcomes.pdf Fit for the future: resources and capacity for effective local government]' and the previous held in Gaborone in June 2015 on the theme 'Local government 2030: achieving the vision' and CLGF general assembly endorsed the [http://www.clgf.org.uk/default/assets/File/CLGF_statements/CLGC2015_gaborone_declaration.pdf Gaborone Declaration - Local Government 2030].

{{Democracy}}
{{Basic forms of government}}
{{Politics sidebar|expanded=Systems}}
'''Democracy''' ({{lang-gr|δημοκρατία}} ''{{lang|grc|dēmokratía}}'', literally "rule by people"), in modern usage, has three senses—all for a system of government where the citizens exercise power by [[Vote|voting]]. In a [[direct democracy]], the citizens as a whole form a governing body and vote directly on each issue. In a [[representative democracy]] the citizens elect representatives from among themselves. These representatives meet to form a governing body, such as a [[legislature]]. In a [[constitutional democracy]] the powers of the majority are exercised within the framework of a representative democracy, but the constitution limits the majority and protects the minority, usually through the enjoyment by all of certain individual rights, e.g. freedom of speech, or freedom of association.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]: ''Democracy''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Watkins |first1=Frederick |authorlink1=Democracy |title=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=1970 |publisher=William Benton |isbn=978-0-85229-135-1 |pages=215–223 |edition=Expo '70 |language=English |format=Hardcover|volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Rule of the majority" is sometimes referred to as democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/democracy|title=Definition of DEMOCRACY|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Democracy is a system of processing conflicts in which outcomes depend on what participants do, but no single force controls what occurs and its outcomes.

The uncertainty of outcomes is inherent in democracy, which makes all forces struggle repeatedly for the realization of their interests, being the devolution of power from a group of people to a set of rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Przeworski|first1=Adam|title=Democracy and the Market|date=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=10–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Western democracy]], as distinct from that which existed in pre-modern societies, is generally considered to have originated in [[city-states]] such as [[Classical Athens]] and the [[Roman Republic]], where various schemes and degrees of enfranchisement of the free male population were observed before the form disappeared in [[Western world|the West]] at the beginning of [[late antiquity]]. The English word dates back to the 16th century, from the older [[Middle French]] and [[Middle Latin]] equivalents.

According to American political scientist [[Larry Diamond]], democracy consists of four key elements: a political system for choosing and replacing the government through free and fair [[election]]s; the active participation of the people, as citizens, in politics and civic life; protection of the [[human rights]] of all citizens; a [[rule of law]], in which the laws and procedures apply equally to all citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, L., Lecture at Hilla University for Humanistic Studies 21 January 2004: [http://web.stanford.edu/~ldiamond/iraq/WhaIsDemocracy012004.htm "What is Democracy"]; Diamond, L. and Morlino, L., The quality of democracy (2016). In Diamond, L., In Search of Democracy. London: Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0-415-78128-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Todd Landman, nevertheless, draws our attention to the fact  that democracy and [[human rights]] are two different concepts and that "there must be greater specificity in the conceptualisation and operationalization of democracy and human rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Landman |first1=Todd |title=Democracy and Human Rights: Concepts, Measures, and Relationships |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=48 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i1.1186 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1186|year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term appeared in the 5th century BC to denote the political systems then existing in [[Greek city-state]]s, notably [[Classical Athens|Athens]], to mean "rule of the people", in contrast to [[aristocracy]] ({{lang|grc|ἀριστοκρατία}}, ''{{lang|la|aristokratía}}''), meaning "rule of an elite". While theoretically these definitions are in opposition, in practice the distinction has been blurred historically.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, N. G. (2006). ''Encyclopedia of ancient Greece''. New York: Routledge. p. 511. {{ISBN|0-415-97334-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The political system of Classical Athens, for example, granted democratic citizenship to free men and excluded slaves and women from political participation. In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship consisted of an elite class, until full enfranchisement was won for all adult citizens in most modern democracies through the [[suffrage]] movements of the 19th and 20th centuries.

Democracy contrasts with forms of government where power is either held by an individual, as in an [[absolute monarchy]], or where power is held by a small number of individuals, as in an [[oligarchy]]. Nevertheless, these oppositions, inherited from Greek philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barker|first=Ernest|title=The Political Thought of Plato and Aristotle|year=1906|publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons|location=Chapter VII, Section 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1HUrAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; are now ambiguous because contemporary governments have mixed democratic, oligarchic and monarchic elements. [[Karl Popper]] defined democracy in contrast to [[dictatorship]] or [[Tyrant|tyranny]], thus focusing on opportunities for the people to control their leaders and to oust them without the need for a [[revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Jarvie, 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;218–19&lt;/ref&gt;

No consensus exists on how to define democracy, but [[legal equality]], [[political freedom]] and [[rule of law]] have been identified as important characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff  writer |url=http://www.economist.com/markets/rankings/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8908438|title=Liberty and justice for some|work=[[The Economist]] | publisher = [[Economist Group]] | date = 22 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = O'Donnell | first = Guillermo | contribution = Why the rule of law matters | editor-last1 = Diamond | editor-first1 = Larry | editor-last2 = Morlino | editor-first2 = Leonardo | title = Assessing the quality of democracy | pages = 3–17 | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | location = Baltimore | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780801882876 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=-eXJMXnraPQC&amp;pg=PA3 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; These principles are reflected in all eligible citizens being [[Equality before the law|equal before the law]] and having equal access to legislative processes.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} For example, in a [[representative democracy]], every vote has equal weight, no unreasonable restrictions can apply to anyone seeking to become a representative,{{according to whom|date=January 2015}} and the freedom of its eligible citizens is secured by legitimised rights and liberties which are typically protected by a [[constitution]].&lt;ref name="BKMIT"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Dahl | first1 = Robert A. | last2 = Shapiro | first2 = Ian | last3 = Cheibub | first3 = José Antônio | title = The democracy sourcebook | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780262541473 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=B8THIuSkiqgC Details.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BKHenaff"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hénaff | first1 = Marcel | last2 = Strong | first2 = Tracy B. | title = Public space and democracy | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | location = Minneapolis | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780816633883 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other uses of "democracy" include that of [[direct democracy]].

One theory holds that democracy requires three fundamental principles: upward control (sovereignty residing at the lowest levels of authority), political equality, and social norms by which individuals and institutions only consider acceptable acts that reflect the first two principles of upward control and political equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kimber | first = Richard | title = On democracy | journal = [[Scandinavian Political Studies]] | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 201, 199–219| doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9477.1989.tb00090.x | date = September 1989 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://tidsskrift.dk/index.php/scandinavian_political_studies/article/view/13057/24875 Full text.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "democracy" is sometimes used as shorthand for [[liberal democracy]], which is a variant of representative democracy that may include elements such as [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|political pluralism]]; equality before the law; the [[right to petition]] elected officials for redress of grievances; [[due process]]; [[civil liberties]]; [[human rights]]; and elements of [[civil society]] outside the government.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} [[Roger Scruton]] argues that democracy alone cannot provide personal and political freedom unless the institutions of [[civil society]] are also present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Scruton | first = Roger | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23607302 | title=A Point of View: Is democracy overrated? | work = [[BBC News]] | publisher= [[BBC]] | date=9 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, notably in the [[United Kingdom]] which originated the [[Westminster system]], the dominant principle is that of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], while maintaining [[judicial independence]].&lt;ref name= Kopstein2014&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Kopstein|editor1-first=Jeffrey|editor2-last=Lichbach|editor2-first=Mark|editor3-last=Hanson|editor3-first=Stephen E.|title=Comparative Politics: Interests, Identities, and Institutions in a Changing Global Order|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1139991384|pages=37–39|edition=4, revised|url=https://books.google.com/?id=L2jwAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/sovereignty/ |title=Parliamentary sovereignty |publisher=UK Parliament |accessdate=18 August 2014|postscript=none}}; {{cite web|title=Independence|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-judiciary-the-government-and-the-constitution/jud-acc-ind/independence/|publisher=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], [[separation of powers]] is often cited as a central attribute. In [[India]], parliamentary sovereignty is subject to the [[Constitution of India]] which includes [[judicial review]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Daily Express News|url=http://newindianexpress.com/nation/All-party-meet-vows-to-uphold-Parliament-supremacy/2013/08/02/article1713808.ece |title=All-party meet vows to uphold Parliament supremacy |date=2 August 2013 |accessdate=18 August 2013 |work=[[The New Indian Express]]| publisher = Express Publications (Madurai) Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the term "democracy" is typically used in the context of a [[state (polity)|political state]], the principles also are applicable to private [[organisation]]s.

[[Majority rule]] is often listed as a characteristic of democracy. Hence, democracy allows for [[minority group|political minorities]] to be oppressed by the "[[tyranny of the majority]]" in the absence of legal protections of individual or group rights. An essential part of an "ideal" representative democracy is competitive [[elections]] that are substantively and procedurally "[[wikt:fair|fair]]," i.e., [[wikt:just|just]] and [[wikt:equitable|equitable]]. In some countries, [[freedom (political)|freedom of political expression]], [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of the press]], and [[E-democracy|internet democracy]] are considered important to ensure that voters are well informed, enabling them to vote according to their own interests.&lt;ref name="Barak27"&gt;{{citation | last = Barak | first = Aharon | contribution = Protecting the constitution and democracy | editor-last = Barak | editor-first = Aharon | title = The judge in a democracy | page = 27 | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton, New Jersey | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780691120171 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=3HX7mAbjGOYC&amp;pg=PA27 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kelsen | first = Hans | title = Foundations of democracy | journal = Ethics, Special Issue: Part 2: Foundations of Democracy | volume = 66 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–101 | doi = 10.1086/291036 | jstor = 2378551 | date = October 1955 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that a basic feature of democracy is the capacity of all voters to participate freely and fully in the life of their society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nussbaum |first=Martha | author-link = Martha Nussbaum |title=Women and human development: the capabilities approach |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge New York |year=2000 |isbn=9780521003858}}&lt;/ref&gt; With its emphasis on notions of [[social contract]] and the collective will of all the voters, democracy can also be characterised as a form of political [[collectivism]] because it is defined as a form of government in which all eligible citizens have an equal say in lawmaking.&lt;ref name="JHUPress"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Snyder | first1 = Richard | last2 = Samuels | first2 = David | contribution = Devaluing the vote in Latin America | editor-last1 = Diamond | editor-first1 = Larry | editor-last2 = Plattner | editor-first2 = Marc F. | title = Electoral systems and democracy | page = 168 | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | location = Baltimore | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780801884757 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While representative democracy is sometimes equated with the republican form of government, the term "[[republic]]" classically has encompassed both democracies and [[aristocracy|aristocracies]].&lt;ref&gt;Montesquieu, ''Spirit of the Laws'', Bk. II, ch. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="William R.

{{Main|History of democracy}}

===Ancient origins===
{{see also|Athenian democracy}}

The term "democracy" first appeared in ancient Greek political and philosophical thought in the city-state of [[Athens]] during [[classical antiquity]].&lt;ref name="BKDunn1992"&gt;John Dunn, ''Democracy: the unfinished journey 508 BC&amp;nbsp;– 1993 AD'', Oxford University Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-19-827934-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Raaflaub|Ober|Wallace|2007|p={{page needed|date=July 2014}} }} The word comes from ''demos'', "common people" and ''kratos'', "strength".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=democracy |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|title=Democracy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Led by [[Cleisthenes]], Athenians established what is generally held as the first democracy in 508–507 BC. Cleisthenes is referred to as "the father of [[Athenian democracy]]."&lt;ref&gt;R. Po-chia Hsia, Lynn Hunt, Thomas R. Martin, Barbara H. Rosenwein, and Bonnie G. Smith, ''The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures, A Concise History, Volume I: To 1740'' (Boston and New York: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2007), 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Athenian democracy took the form of a direct democracy, and it had two distinguishing features: the [[sortition|random selection]] of ordinary citizens to fill the few existing government administrative and judicial offices,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle Book 6&lt;/ref&gt; and a legislative assembly consisting of all Athenian citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Leonid E. |last=Grinin |url=http://www.socionauki.ru/book/early_state_en/ |title=The Early State, Its Alternatives and Analogues |publisher=Uchitel' Publishing House |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; All eligible citizens were allowed to speak and vote in the assembly, which set the laws of the city state. However, Athenian citizenship excluded women, slaves, foreigners (μέτοικοι / ''métoikoi''), non-landowners, and men under 20 years of age.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/projects/demos/article_women_and_family?page=4|title=Women and Family in Athenian Law|website=www.stoa.org|language=en|access-date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Contradict-inline|article=Athenian democracy|date=September 2014}}
The exclusion of large parts of the population from the citizen body is closely related to the ancient understanding of citizenship. In most of antiquity the benefit of citizenship was tied to the obligation to fight war campaigns.&lt;ref name="SLape2009"&gt;Susan Lape, ''Reproducing Athens: Menander's Comedy, Democratic Culture, and the Hellenistic City'', Princeton University Press, 2009, p. 4, {{ISBN|1400825911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athenian democracy was not only ''direct'' in the sense that decisions were made by the assembled people, but also the ''most direct'' in the sense that the people through the assembly, boule and courts of law controlled the entire political process and a large proportion of citizens were involved constantly in the public business.{{sfn|Raaflaub|Ober|Wallace|2007|p=5}} Even though the rights of the individual were not secured by the Athenian constitution in the modern sense (the ancient Greeks had no word for "rights"{{sfn|Ober|Hedrick|1996|p=107}}), the Athenians enjoyed their liberties not in opposition to the government but by living in a city that was not subject to another power and by not being subjects themselves to the rule of another person.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, 2001, pp. 194–201&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Range voting]] appeared in [[Sparta]] as early as 700 BC. The [[Apella]] was an assembly of the people, held once a month, in which every male citizen of at least 30 years of age could participate. In the Apella, Spartans elected leaders and cast votes by range voting and shouting. [[Aristotle]] called this "childish", as compared with the stone voting ballots used by the Athenians. Sparta adopted it because of its simplicity, and to prevent any bias voting, buying, or cheating that was predominant in the early democratic elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rangevoting.org/SpartaBury.html |title=Full historical description of the Spartan government |publisher=Rangevoting.org |date= |accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terrence A. Boring, ''Literacy in Ancient Sparta'', Leiden Netherlands (1979). {{ISBN|90-04-05971-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the [[Roman Republic]] contributed significantly to many aspects of democracy, only a minority of Romans were citizens with votes in elections for representatives. The votes of the powerful were given more weight through a system of [[gerrymandering]], so most high officials, including members of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], came from a few wealthy and noble families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://annourbis.com/Ancient-Rome/8rome10.html |title=Ancient Rome from the earliest times down to 476 A.D |publisher=Annourbis.com |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Roman Republic was the first government in the western world to have a [[Republic]] as a nation-state, although it didn't have much of a democracy. The Romans invented the concept of classics and many works from Ancient Greece were preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watson|2005|p=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Roman model of governance inspired many political thinkers over the centuries,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Livy|2002|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; and today's modern representative democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek models because it was a state in which supreme power was held by the people and their elected representatives, and which had an elected or nominated leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watson|2005|p=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cultures, such as the [[Iroquois]] Nation in the Americas between around 1450 and 1600 AD also developed a form of democratic society before they came in contact with the Europeans. This indicates that forms of democracy may have been invented in other societies around the world.

===Middle Ages===

* The 10th Sikh [[Guru Gobind Singh]] ji (Nanak X) established the world's first Sikh democratic republic state ending the aristocracy on day of 1st Vasakh 1699 and Gurbani as sole constitution of this Sikh republic on the Indian subcontinent.{{citation needed|reason=No source found confirming democracy in Khalsa|date=August 2016}}
Most regions in medieval Europe were ruled by clergy or feudal lords.

The [[Kouroukan Fouga]] divided the [[Mali Empire]] into ruling clans (lineages) that were represented at a great assembly called the ''Gbara''. However, the charter made Mali more similar to a [[constitutional monarchy]] than a [[democratic republic]].

[[File:Magna Carta (British Library Cotton MS Augustus II.106).jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|[[Magna Carta]], 1215, England]]
The [[Parliament of England]] had its roots in the restrictions on the power of kings written into [[Magna Carta]] (1215), which explicitly protected certain rights of the King's subjects and implicitly supported what became the English writ of [[habeas corpus]], safeguarding individual freedom against unlawful imprisonment with right to appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magna Carta: an introduction|url=http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/magna-carta-an-introduction|publisher=The British Library|accessdate=28 January 2015|quote=Magna Carta is sometimes regarded as the foundation of democracy in England. ...Revised versions of Magna Carta were issued by King Henry III (in 1216, 1217 and 1225), and the text of the 1225 version was entered onto the statute roll in 1297. ...The 1225 version of Magna Carta had been granted explicitly in return for a payment of tax by the whole kingdom, and this paved the way for the first summons of Parliament in 1265, to approve the granting of taxation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/citizen_subject/making_history_citizen.htm |title=Citizen or Subject? |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first representative national assembly in [[Kingdom of England|England]] was [[Simon de Montfort's Parliament]] in 1265.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jobson|first1=Adrian|title=The First English Revolution: Simon de Montfort, Henry III and the Barons' War|date=2012|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=978-1-84725-226-5|pages=173–4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9gHWamp-TLoC&amp;pg=PA174#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Simon de Montfort: The turning point for democracy that gets overlooked|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30849472|accessdate=19 January 2015|publisher=BBC| postscript = none|date=19 January 2015}}; {{cite news|title=The January Parliament and how it defined Britain|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/11355822/The-January-Parliament-and-how-it-defined-Britain.html|accessdate=28 January 2015|publisher=The Telegraph|date=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of [[Parliament of England#The emergence of parliament as an institution|petitioning]] is some of the earliest evidence of parliament being used as a forum to address the general grievances of ordinary people.

After the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] was enacted in 1689 which codified certain rights and liberties, and is still in effect. The Bill set out the requirement for regular elections, rules for freedom of speech in Parliament and limited the power of the monarch, ensuring that, unlike much of Europe at the time, [[royal absolutism]] would not prevail.&lt;ref name=refNARoP&gt;{{cite web|title=Britain's unwritten constitution|url=http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/britains-unwritten-constitution|publisher=British Library|accessdate=27 November 2015|quote=The key landmark is the Bill of Rights (1689), which established the supremacy of Parliament over the Crown....

The rising commercial class that had supported the Tudor monarchy in the 16th century led the revolutionary battle in the 17th, and succeeded in establishing the supremacy of Parliament and, eventually, of the House of Commons. What emerged as the distinctive feature of modern constitutionalism was not the insistence on the idea that the king is subject to law (although this concept is an essential attribute of all constitutionalism). This notion was already well established in the Middle Ages. What was distinctive was the establishment of effective means of political control whereby the rule of law might be enforced. Modern constitutionalism was born with the political requirement that representative government depended upon the consent of citizen subjects.... However, as can be seen through provisions in the 1689 Bill of Rights, the English Revolution was fought not just to protect the rights of property (in the narrow sense) but to establish those liberties which liberals believed essential to human dignity and moral worth.

In the Cossack republics of Ukraine in the 16th and 17th centuries, the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] and [[Zaporizhian Sich]], the holder of the highest post of [[Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks|Hetman]] was elected by the representatives from the country's districts.

In North America, representative government began in [[Jamestown, Virginia]], with the election of the [[House of Burgesses]] (forerunner of the [[Virginia General Assembly]]) in 1619. English Puritans who migrated from 1620 established colonies in New England whose local governance was democratic and which contributed to the democratic development of the [[United States]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexis de Tocqueville|Tocqueville, Alexis de]] (2003).

The [[Puritans]] ([[Pilgrim Fathers]]), [[Baptists]], and [[Quakers]] who founded these colonies applied the democratic organisation of their congregations also to the administration of their communities in worldly matters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Allen Weinstein]] and David Rubel (2002), ''The Story of America: Freedom and Crisis from Settlement to Superpower'', DK Publishing, Inc., New York, N.Y., {{ISBN|0-7894-8903-1}}, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clifton E.

====18th and 19th centuries====
[[File:Suffrage universel 1848.jpg|thumb|The establishment of [[universal male suffrage]] in France in 1848 was an important milestone in the history of democracy.]]

The [[first Parliament of Great Britain]] was established in 1707, after the merger of the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] under the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]]. Although the monarch increasingly became a [[Constitutional monarchy|figurehead]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/rise_parliament/citizenship2.htm |title=Citizenship 1625–1789 |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
only a small minority actually had a voice; Parliament was elected by only a few percent of the population (less than 3% as late as 1780).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/struggle_democracy/getting_vote.htm |title=Getting the vote |publisher=The National Archives |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Age of Liberty]] in Sweden (1718–1772), [[civil rights]] were expanded and power shifted from the monarch to parliament. The taxed peasantry was represented in parliament, although with little influence, but commoners without taxed property had no suffrage.

The creation of the short-lived [[Corsican Republic]] in 1755 marked the first nation in modern history to adopt a democratic [[constitution]] (all men and women above age of 25 could vote&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The ungovernable rock: a history of the Anglo-Corsican Kingdom and its role in Britain's Mediterranean strategy during the Revolutionary War, 1793–1797 |first=Desmond |last=Gregory |year=1985 |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press |location=London |page=31 |isbn=978-0-8386-3225-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This [[Corsican Constitution]] was the first based on [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles and included [[female suffrage]], something that was not granted in most other democracies until the 20th century.

In the [[Colonial history of the United States|American colonial period before 1776]], and for some time after, often only adult white male property owners could vote; enslaved Africans, most free black people and most women were not extended the franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Voting in Early America|journal=Colonial Williamsburg|volume=Spring 2007|url=http://www.history.org/Foundation/journal/spring07/elections.cfm|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Frontier Thesis|American frontier]], democracy became a way of life, with more widespread social, economic and political equality.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Allen Billington, ''America's Frontier Heritage'' (1974) 117–158. {{ISBN|0-8263-0310-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not described as a democracy by the [[founding fathers of the united states|founding fathers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnston|first1=Douglas M.|last2=Reisman|first2=W.

The [[American Revolution]] led to the adoption of the [[United States Constitution]] in 1787, the oldest surviving, still active, governmental [[codified constitution]]. The Constitution provided for an elected government and protected civil rights and liberties for some, but did not end [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] nor extend [[voting rights in the United States]] beyond white male property owners (about 6% of the population).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Expansion of Rights and Liberties - The Right of Suffrage|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_13.html|website=Online Exhibit: The Charters of Freedom|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=21 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706144856/http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_13.html|archivedate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] in 1791 set limits on government power to protect personal freedoms but had little impact on judgements by the courts for the first 130 years after ratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bill Of Rights: A Brief History|url=https://www.aclu.org/bill-rights-brief-history|publisher=ACLU|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, [[slavery]] remained a social and economic institution in places around the world. This was particularly the case in the [[United States]], and especially in the last fifteen [[slave state]]s that kept slavery legal in the American South until the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. A variety of organisations were established advocating the movement of black people from the United States to locations where they would enjoy greater freedom and equality.

The United Kingdom's [[Slave Trade Act 1807]] banned the trade across the [[British Empire]], which was [[Blockade of Africa|enforced internationally]] by the Royal Navy under treaties Britain negotiated with other nations.&lt;ref name="Lovejoy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lovejoy |first=Paul E. |title=Transformations in slavery: a history of slavery in Africa |page=290 |location=New York |edition=2nd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0521780124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the voting franchise in the U.K. was increased, it also was made more uniform in a series of reforms beginning with the [[Reform Act 1832]], although the United Kingdom did not manage to become a complete democracy well into the [[20th century]]. In 1833, the United Kingdom passed the [[Slavery Abolition Act]] which took effect across the British Empire.

20th-century transitions to liberal democracy have come in successive "waves of democracy", variously resulting from wars, revolutions, [[decolonisation]], and religious and economic circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diamond|first1=Larry|title=Timeline: Democracy in Recession|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/09/13/opinion/larry-diamond-democracy-in-recession-timeline.html|accessdate=25 January 2016|work=The New York Times|date=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global waves of "democratic regression" reversing democratization, have also occurred in the 1920s and 30s, in the 1960s and 1970s, and in the 2010s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-11/mini-trumps-are-running-for-election-all-over-the-world|title=Mini-Trumps Are Running for Election All Over the World|last=Kurlantzick|first=Joshua|date=11 May 2017|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.journalofdemocracy.org/authoreditor/yascha-mounk|title=The Signs of Deconsolidation|last=Mounk|first=Yascha|date=January 2017|website=|language=en|access-date=16 May 2017|journal=Journal of Democracy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World War I]] and the dissolution of the [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] and [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] empires resulted in the creation of new nation-states from Europe, most of them at least nominally democratic.

In the 1920s democracy flourished and [[Timeline of women's suffrage|women's suffrage]] advanced, but the [[Great Depression]] brought disenchantment and most of the countries of Europe, Latin America, and Asia turned to strong-man rule or dictatorships. [[Fascism]] and dictatorships flourished in [[Nazi Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], as well as non-democratic governments in the [[Baltics]], the [[Balkans]], [[Brazil]], [[Cuba]], [[China]], and [[Japan]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snl.depaul.edu/contents/current/syllabi/HC_314.doc |title=Age of Dictators: Totalitarianism in the inter-war period |accessdate=7 September 2006 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907220746/http://www.snl.depaul.edu/contents/current/syllabi/HC_314.doc |archivedate=7 September 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World War II]] brought a definitive reversal of this trend in western Europe. The [[democratisation]] of the [[Allied Control Council|American, British, and French sectors of occupied Germany]] (disputed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?a=599 |title=Did the United States Create Democracy in Germany?: The Independent Review: The Independent Institute |publisher=Independent.org |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Austria, Italy, and the [[occupied Japan]] served as a model for the later theory of [[government change]]. However, most of [[Eastern Europe]], including the [[German Democratic Republic|Soviet sector of Germany]] fell into the non-democratic [[Soviet bloc]].

The war was followed by [[decolonisation]], and again most of the new independent states had nominally democratic constitutions. [[India]] emerged as the world's largest democracy and continues to be so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/country_profiles/1154019.stm |title=World &amp;#124; South Asia &amp;#124; Country profiles &amp;#124; Country profile: India |publisher=BBC News |date=7 June 2010 |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Countries that were once part of the [[British Empire]] often adopted the British [[Westminster system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Arjomand|editor1-first=Saïd Amir|title=Constitutionalism and political reconstruction|date=2007|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-9004151741|pages=92–94|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kYmmnYKEvE0C&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;pg=PA94#v=onepage|author1=Julian Go|chapter=A Globalizing Constitutionalism?, Views from the Postcolony, 1945–2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How the Westminster Parliamentary System was exported around the World|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/features/how-the-westminster-parliamentary-system-was-exported-around-the-world|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=16 December 2013|date=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1960, the vast majority of country-states were nominally democracies, although most of the world's populations lived in nations that experienced sham elections, and other forms of subterfuge (particularly in [[Communist state|"Communist" nations]] and the former colonies.)

A subsequent wave of [[democratisation]] brought substantial gains toward true liberal democracy for many nations. [[Spanish democratic transition|Spain]], [[Portuguese transition to democracy|Portugal]] (1974), and several of the military dictatorships in South America returned to civilian rule in the late 1970s and early 1980s ([[Argentine transition to democracy|Argentina in 1983]], [[History of Bolivia|Bolivia]], [[History of Uruguay|Uruguay in 1984]], [[History of Brazil (1985–present)|Brazil in 1985]], and [[Chilean transition to democracy|Chile in the early 1990s]]). This was followed by nations in [[East Asia|East]] and [[South Asia]] by the mid-to-late 1980s.

Economic malaise in the 1980s, along with resentment of Soviet oppression, contributed to the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|collapse of the Soviet Union]], the associated end of the [[Cold War]], and the democratisation and [[liberalisation]] of the former [[Eastern bloc]] countries. The most successful of the new democracies were those geographically and culturally closest to western Europe, and they are now members or candidate members of the [[European Union]]. In 1986, after the toppling of the most prominent Asian dictatorship, the only democratic state of its kind at the time emerged in the [[Philippines]] with the rise of [[Corazon Aquino]], who would later be known as the Mother of Asian Democracy.

[[File:Corazon Aquino inauguration.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|[[Corazon Aquino]] taking the Oath of Office, becoming the first female president in Asia]]

The liberal trend spread to some nations in Africa in the 1990s, most prominently in [[South Africa]]. Some recent examples of attempts of liberalisation include the [[Indonesian Revolution of 1998]], the [[Overthrow of Slobodan Milošević|Bulldozer Revolution]] in [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], the [[Rose Revolution]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the [[Orange Revolution]] in [[Ukraine]], the [[Cedar Revolution]] in [[Lebanon]], the [[Tulip Revolution]] in [[Kyrgyzstan]], and the [[2010–2011 Tunisian revolution|Jasmine Revolution]] in [[Tunisia]].

According to [[Freedom House]], in 2007 there were 123 electoral democracies (up from 40 in 1972).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=368&amp;year=2007 |title=Tables and Charts |publisher=Freedomhouse.org |date=10 May 2004 |accessdate=22 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090713213025/http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=368&amp;year=2007 |archivedate=13 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''World Forum on Democracy'', electoral democracies now represent 120 of the 192 existing countries and constitute 58.2 percent of the world's population. At the same time liberal democracies i.e. countries Freedom House regards as free and respectful of basic human rights and the rule of law are 85 in number and represent 38 percent of the global population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordemocracy.net/electoral.shtml List of Electoral Democracies] fordemocracy.net {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In California, a 2004 proposal to permit a quarter vote at 14 and a half vote at 16 was ultimately defeated. In 2008, the German parliament proposed but shelved a bill that would grant the vote to each citizen at birth, to be used by a parent until the child claims it for themselves.

In 2007 the [[United Nations]] declared 15 September the [[International Day of Democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/ga10655.doc.htm |title=General Assembly declares 15 September International Day of Democracy; Also elects 18 Members to Economic and Social Council |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Freedom House, starting in 2005, there have been eleven consecutive years in which declines in political rights and civil liberties throughout the world have outnumbered improvements,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2017|title=Freedom in the Word 2017|last=|first=|date=2016|website=freedomhouse.org|language=en|access-date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Populism|populist]] and [[Nationalism|nationalist]] political forces have gained ground everywhere from Poland (under the [[Law and Justice|Law and Justice Party]]) to the Philippines (under [[Rodrigo Duterte]]).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Difficulties in measuring democracy===
Because democracy is an overarching concept that includes the functioning of diverse institutions which are not easy to measure, strong limitations exist in quantifying and econometricallymeasuring the potential effects of democracy or its relationship with other phenomena - whether inequality, poverty, educationetc.&lt;ref name="Journal of Economic Methodology"&gt;Alexander Krauss, 2016. [http://personal.lse.ac.uk/kraussa/The%20scientific%20limits%20of%20understanding%20the%20%28potential%29%20relationship%20between%20complex%20social%20phenomena%20--%20the%20case%20of%20democracy%20and%20inequality.pdf ''The scientific limits of understanding the (potential) relationship between complex social phenomena: the case of democracy and inequality'']. Vol. 23(1).  [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1350178X.2015.1069372 Journal of Economic Methodology.]&lt;/ref&gt; Given the constraints in acquiring reliable data with within-country variation on aspects of democracy, academics have largely studied cross-country variations. Yet variations between democratic institutions are very large across countries which constrains meaningful comparisons using statistical approaches. Since democracy is typically measured aggregately as a macro variable using a single observation for each country and each year, studying democracy facesa range of econometricconstraints and is limited tobasic correlations. Cross-country comparison of a composite, comprehensive and qualitativeconcept like democracy may thus not always be, for many purposes, methodologicallyrigorous or useful.&lt;ref name="Journal of Economic Methodology"/&gt;

==Types of governmental democracies==
{{main|Types of democracy}}

Democracy has taken a number of forms, both in theory and practice. Some varieties of democracy provide better representation and more freedom for their citizens than others.&lt;ref&gt;G. F. Gaus, C. Kukathas, ''Handbook of Political Theory'', SAGE, 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;143–45, {{ISBN|0-7619-6787-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RGisaLxA6eMC Google Books link]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Judge in a Democracy'', Princeton University Press, 2006, p. 26, {{ISBN|0-691-12017-X}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3HX7mAbjGOYC Google Books link]&lt;/ref&gt; However, if any democracy is not structured so as to prohibit the government from excluding the people from the legislative process, or any branch of government from altering the [[separation of powers]] in its own favour, then a branch of the system can accumulate too much power and destroy the democracy.&lt;ref name="Barak40"&gt;A.

]]

The following kinds of democracy are not exclusive of one another: many specify details of aspects that are independent of one another and can co-exist in a single system.

===Basic forms===
Several variants of democracy exist, but there are two basic forms, both of which concern how the whole body of all eligible citizens executes its will. One form of democracy is [[direct democracy]], in which all eligible citizens have active participation in the political decision making, for example voting on policy initiatives directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Budge, Ian|chapter=Direct democracy|editors=Clarke, Paul A.B. &amp; Foweraker, Joe|title=Encyclopedia of Political Thought|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2001|isbn=978-0-415-19396-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=srzDCqnZkfUC&amp;pg=PA224}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most modern democracies, the whole body of eligible citizens remain the sovereign power but political power is exercised indirectly through elected representatives; this is called a [[representative democracy]].

====Direct====
[[File:Landsgemeinde Glarus, 2009.jpg|thumb|A [[Landsgemeinde]] (in 2009) of the [[Canton of Glarus]], an example of direct democracy in [[Switzerland]]]]
[[File:Swiss voting material.jpg|thumb|In [[Voting in Switzerland|Switzerland]], without needing to register, every citizen receives [[ballot papers]] and information brochures for each vote (and can send it back by post). Switzerland has a [[direct democracy]] system and votes are organised about four times a year.]]
{{Main|Direct democracy}}

Direct democracy is a political system where the citizens participate in the decision-making personally, contrary to relying on intermediaries or representatives. The use of a lot system, a characteristic of [[Athenian democracy]], is unique to direct democracies. In this system, important governmental and administrative tasks are performed by citizens picked from a lottery.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Manin. Principles of Representative Government. pp. 8–11 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; A direct democracy gives the voting population the power to:

# Change constitutional laws,
# Put forth [[initiative]]s, [[referendum]]s and suggestions for laws,
# Give binding orders to elective officials, such as revoking them before the end of their elected term, or initiating a lawsuit for breaking a campaign promise.

Within modern-day representative governments, certain electoral tools like referendums, citizens' initiatives and [[recall election]]s are referred to as forms of direct democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Beramendi, Virginia, and Jennifer Somalie.

====Representative====
{{Main|Representative democracy}}
Representative democracy involves the election of government officials by the people being represented. If the head of state is also [[Democratically-elected government|democratically elected]] then it is called a democratic [[republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/REV/RADICAL.HTM |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990203212816/http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/REV/RADICAL.HTM |archivedate=3 February 1999 |title=Radical Revolution – The Thermidorean Reaction |publisher=Wsu.edu |date=6 June 1999 |accessdate=22 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common mechanisms involve election of the candidate with a majority or a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the votes. Most western countries have representative systems.&lt;ref name=Golay/&gt;

Representatives may be elected or become diplomatic representatives by a particular district (or [[constituency]]), or represent the entire electorate through [[Proportional representation|proportional]] systems, with some using a combination of the two. Some representative democracies also incorporate elements of direct democracy, such as [[referendum]]s. A characteristic of representative democracy is that while the representatives are elected by the people to act in the people's interest, they retain the freedom to exercise their own judgement as how best to do so. Such reasons have driven criticism upon representative democracy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Köchler | first = Hans | title = The Crisis of Representative Democracy | publisher = Frankfurt/M., Bern, New York | isbn = 978-3-8204-8843-2 | year = 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Urbinati | first = Nadia | title  = Representative Democracy: Principles and Genealogy | isbn = 978-0226842790 | date = 1 October 2008 | chapter = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out the contradictions of representation mechanisms with democracy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Fenichel Pitkin | first = Hanna | title = Representation and democracy: uneasy alliance | journal = [[Scandinavian Political Studies]] | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 335–42 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9477.2004.00109.x | date = September 2004 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Aristotle | title = Politics | volume = Book 4| chapter = Ch. 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Parliamentary=====
{{Main|Parliamentary system}}
Parliamentary democracy is a representative democracy where government is appointed by, or can be dismissed by, representatives as opposed to a "presidential rule" wherein the president is both head of state and the head of government and is elected by the voters. Under a parliamentary democracy, government is exercised by delegation to an executive ministry and subject to ongoing review, checks and balances by the legislative parliament elected by the people.&lt;ref&gt;Keen, Benjamin, A History of Latin America. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuykendall, Ralph, Hawaii: A History. New York: Prentice Hall, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Charles H., The Correspondents' War. New York: Charles Scribners' Sons, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taussig, Capt. J. K., "Experiences during the Boxer Rebellion," in Quarterdeck and Fo'c'sle. Chicago: Rand McNally &amp; Company, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

Parliamentary systems have the right to dismiss a Prime Minister at any point in time that they feel he or she is not doing their job to the expectations of the legislature. This is done through a Vote of No Confidence where the legislature decides whether or not to remove the Prime Minister from office by a majority support for his or her dismissal.&lt;ref name="O'Neil, Patrick H 2010"&gt;O'Neil, Patrick H. Essentials of Comparative Politics. 3rd ed. New York: W. W. Norton 2010. Print&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, the Prime Minister can also call an election whenever he or she so chooses, and typically the Prime Minister will hold an election when he or she knows that they are in good favour with the public as to get re-elected. In other parliamentary democracies extra elections are virtually never held, a minority government being preferred until the next ordinary elections. An important feature of the parliamentary democracy is the concept of the "loyal opposition". The essence of the concept is that the second largest political party (or coalition) opposes the governing party (or coalition), while still remaining loyal to the state and its democratic principles.

=====Presidential=====
{{Main|Presidential system}}
Presidential Democracy is a system where the public elects the president through free and fair elections. The president serves as both the head of state and head of government controlling most of the executive powers. The president serves for a specific term and cannot exceed that amount of time. Elections typically have a fixed date and aren't easily changed. The president has direct control over the cabinet, specifically appointing the cabinet members.&lt;ref name="O'Neil, Patrick H 2010"/&gt;

The president cannot be easily removed from office by the legislature, but he or she cannot remove members of the legislative branch any more easily. This provides some measure of [[separation of powers]]. In consequence however, the president and the legislature may end up in the control of separate parties, allowing one to block the other and thereby interfere with the orderly operation of the state. This may be the reason why presidential democracy is not very common outside the Americas, Africa, and Central and Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="O'Neil, Patrick H 2010"/&gt;

A [[semi-presidential system]] is a system of democracy in which the government includes both a prime minister and a president. The particular powers held by the prime minister and president vary by country.&lt;ref name="O'Neil, Patrick H 2010"/&gt;

====Hybrid or semi-direct====
{{See also|Politics of Switzerland|Voting in Switzerland}}
Some modern democracies that are predominantly representative in nature also heavily rely upon forms of political action that are directly democratic. These democracies, which combine elements of representative democracy and direct democracy, are termed ''hybrid democracies'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Garret, Elizabeth |url=http://clhc.usc.edu/centres/cslp/assets/docs/cslp-wp-048.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171009224922/http://clhc.usc.edu/centres/cslp/assets/docs/cslp-wp-048.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=9 October 2017 |title=The Promise and Perils of Hybrid Democracy |publisher=The Henry Lecture, University of Oklahoma Law School |date=13 October 2005 |accessdate=7 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''semi-direct democracies'' or ''participatory democracies''. Examples include Switzerland and some [[U.S. state]]s, where frequent use is made of [[referendum]]s and [[initiatives]].

The [[Swiss confederation]] is a semi-direct democracy.&lt;ref name=Golay/&gt; At the federal level, citizens can propose changes to the constitution ([[federal popular initiative]]) or ask for a [[Optional referendum|referendum]] to be held on any law voted by the [[Federal Assembly (Switzerland)|parliament]].&lt;ref name=Golay&gt;Vincent Golay and Mix et Remix, ''Swiss political institutions'', Éditions loisirs et pédagogie, 2008. {{ISBN|978-2-606-01295-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Between January 1995 and June 2005, Swiss citizens voted 31 times, to answer 103 questions (during the same period, French citizens participated in only two referendums).&lt;ref name=Golay/&gt; Although in the past 120 years less than 250 initiatives have been put to referendum. The populace has been conservative, approving only about 10% of the initiatives put before them; in addition, they have often opted for a version of the initiative rewritten by government.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

In the [[United States]], no mechanisms of direct democracy exists at the federal level, but over half of the [[U.S. state|states]] and many localities provide for citizen-sponsored ballot initiatives (also called "ballot measures", "ballot questions" or "propositions"), and the vast majority of states allow for referendums. Examples include the extensive use of [[referendum]]s in the US state of [[California]], which is a state that has more than 20 million voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themercury.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3985561 |title=Article on direct democracy by Imraan Buccus |publisher=Themercury.co.za |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117121519/http://www.themercury.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3985561 |archivedate=17 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[New England]], [[Town meeting]]s are often used, especially in rural areas, to manage local government. This creates a hybrid form of government, with a local [[direct democracy]] and a state government which is representative. For example, most [[Vermont]] towns hold annual town meetings in March in which town officers are elected, budgets for the town and schools are voted on, and citizens have the opportunity to speak and be heard on political matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sec.state.vt.us/townmeeting/citizens_guide.html |title=A Citizen's Guide To Vermont Town Meeting |date=July 2008 |accessdate=12 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805023214/http://www.sec.state.vt.us/TownMeeting/citizens_guide.html |archivedate=5 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variants===

====Constitutional monarchy====
{{main|Constitutional monarchy}}
[[File:Elizabeth II greets NASA GSFC employees, May 8, 2007 edit.jpg|thumb|upright|Queen [[Elizabeth II]], a constitutional monarch]]

Many countries such as the United Kingdom, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian countries]], [[Thailand]], [[Japan]] and [[Bhutan]] turned powerful monarchs into constitutional monarchs with limited or, often gradually, merely symbolic roles. For example, in the predecessor states to the United Kingdom, constitutional monarchy began to emerge and has continued uninterrupted since the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 and passage of the [[Bill of Rights 1689]].&lt;ref name= Kopstein2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=refNARoP /&gt;

In other countries, the monarchy was abolished along with the aristocratic system (as in France, China, Russia, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Italy, Greece and Egypt). An elected president, with or without significant powers, became the head of state in these countries.

Elite upper houses of legislatures, which often had lifetime or hereditary tenure, were common in many nations. Over time, these either had their powers limited (as with the British [[House of Lords]]) or else became elective and remained powerful (as with the [[Australian Senate]]).

====Republic====
{{Main|Republicanism}}
The term ''[[republic]]'' has many different meanings, but today often refers to a representative democracy with an elected [[head of state]], such as a [[president]], serving for a limited term, in contrast to states with a hereditary [[monarch]] as a head of state, even if these states also are representative democracies with an elected or appointed [[head of government]] such as a [[Prime Minister|prime minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/republic |title=Republic – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=M-w.com |date=25 April 2007 |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] rarely praised and often criticised democracy, which in their time tended to specifically mean direct democracy, often without the protection of a constitution enshrining basic rights; [[James Madison]] argued, especially in [[Federalist No. 10|''The Federalist'' No. 10]], that what distinguished a direct ''democracy'' from a ''republic'' was that the former became weaker as it got larger and suffered more violently from the effects of faction, whereas a republic could get stronger as it got larger and combats faction by its very structure.

What was critical to American values, [[John Adams]] insisted,&lt;ref&gt;Novanglus, no. 7. 6 March 1775&lt;/ref&gt; was that the government be "bound by fixed laws, which the people have a voice in making, and a right to defend." As Benjamin Franklin was exiting after writing the U.S. constitution, a woman asked him "Well, Doctor, what have we got—a republic or a monarchy?". He replied "A republic—if you can keep it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch18I.html |title=''The Founders' Constitution: Volume 1, Chapter 18, Introduction'', "Epilogue: Securing the Republic" |publisher=Press-pubs.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Liberal democracy====
{{main|Liberal democracy}}
A liberal democracy is a representative democracy in which the ability of the elected representatives to exercise decision-making power is subject to the [[rule of law]], and moderated by a constitution or laws that emphasise the protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals, and which places constraints on the leaders and on the extent to which the will of the majority can be exercised against the rights of minorities (see [[civil liberties]]).

In a liberal democracy, it is possible for some large-scale decisions to [[Emergent democracy|emerge]] from the many individual decisions that citizens are free to make. In other words, citizens can "vote with their feet" or "vote with their dollars", resulting in significant informal government-by-the-masses that exercises many "powers" associated with formal government elsewhere.

====Socialist====
{{See also|Democracy in Marxism}}

[[Socialism|Socialist]] thought has several different views on democracy. [[Social democracy]], [[democratic socialism]], and the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] (usually exercised through [[Soviet democracy]]) are some examples. Many democratic socialists and social democrats believe in a form of [[participatory democracy|participatory]], [[industrial democracy|industrial]], [[economic democracy|economic]] and/or [[workplace democracy]] combined with a [[representative democracy]].

Within [[Democracy in Marxist theory|Marxist orthodoxy]] there is a hostility to what is commonly called "liberal democracy", which they simply refer to as parliamentary democracy because of its often centralised nature. Because of their desire to eliminate the political elitism they see in capitalism, [[Marxism|Marxists]], [[Leninism|Leninists]] and [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] believe in direct democracy implemented through a system of [[commune (Socialism)|communes]] (which are sometimes called [[Soviet (council)|soviets]]). This system ultimately manifests itself as council democracy and begins with workplace democracy.

====Anarchist====
Anarchists are split in this domain, depending on whether they believe that a [[Tyranny of the majority|majority-rule is tyrannic or not]]. The only form of democracy considered acceptable to many [[Anarchism|anarchists]] is direct democracy. [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] argued that the only acceptable form of direct democracy is one in which it is recognised that majority decisions are not binding on the minority, even when unanimous.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. ''General Idea of the Revolution'' See also commentary by [[Robert Graham (historian)|Graham, Robert]]. [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/ANARCHIST_ARCHIVES/proudhon/grahamproudhon.html ''The General Idea of Proudhon's Revolution'']&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[anarcho-communist]] [[Murray Bookchin]] criticised [[individualist anarchists]] for opposing democracy,&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, Murray. Communalism: The Democratic Dimensions of Social Anarchism. Anarchism, Marxism and the Future of the Left: Interviews and Essays, 1993–1998, AK Press 1999, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; and says "majority rule" is consistent with anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, Murray. [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bookchin/soclife.html Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some anarcho-communists oppose the majoritarian nature of direct democracy, feeling that it can impede individual liberty and opt in favour of a non-majoritarian form of [[consensus democracy]], similar to Proudhon's position on direct democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Graeber, David and Grubacic, Andrej. ''Anarchism, Or The Revolutionary Movement Of The Twenty-first Century''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry David Thoreau]], who did not self-identify as an anarchist but argued for "a better government"&lt;ref name="disobedience"&gt;Thoreau, H. D. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/71/71.txt On the Duty of Civil Disobedience]''&lt;/ref&gt; and is cited as an inspiration by some anarchists, argued that people should not be in the position of ruling others or being ruled when there is no consent.

====Sortition====
{{Main|Sortition}}
Sometimes called "democracy without elections", [[sortition]] chooses decision makers via a random process. The intention is that those chosen will be representative of the opinions and interests of the people at large, and be more fair and impartial than an elected official. The technique was in widespread use in [[Athenian Democracy]] and [[Republic of Florence|Renaissance Florence]]&lt;ref name="Imprint Academic"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dowlen|first1=Oliver|title=The Political Potential of Sortition: A study of the random selection of citizens for public office|date=2008|publisher=Imprint Academic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is still used in modern [[jury selection]].

====Consociational====
{{Main|Consociational democracy}}
A consociational democracy allows for simultaneous majority votes in two or more ethno-religious constituencies, and policies are enacted only if they gain majority support from both or all of them.

====Consensus democracy====
{{Main| Consensus democracy}}
A consensus democracy, in contrast, would not be dichotomous. Instead, decisions would be based on a multi-option approach, and policies would be enacted if they gained sufficient support, either in a purely verbal agreement, or via a consensus vote—a multi-option preference vote. If the threshold of support were at a sufficiently high level, minorities would be as it were protected automatically. Furthermore, any voting would be ethno-colour blind.

====Supranational====
[[Qualified majority voting]] is designed by the [[Treaty of Rome]] to be the principal method of reaching decisions in the [[European Council of Ministers]]. This system allocates votes to member states in part according to their population, but heavily weighted in favour of the smaller states. This might be seen as a form of representative democracy, but representatives to the Council might be appointed rather than directly elected.

====Inclusive====
{{Youth rights sidebar}}
{{Main|Inclusive democracy}}
Inclusive democracy is a political theory and political project that aims for [[direct democracy]] in all fields of social life: political democracy in the form of face-to-face assemblies which are confederated, [[economic democracy]] in a [[Stateless society|stateless]], moneyless and marketless economy, democracy in the social realm, i.e. [[Workers' self-management|self-management]] in places of work and education, and ecological democracy which aims to reintegrate society and nature. The theoretical project of inclusive democracy emerged from the work of political philosopher [[Takis Fotopoulos]] in "Towards An Inclusive Democracy" and was further developed in the journal ''[[Democracy &amp; Nature]]'' and its successor ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy''.

The basic unit of decision making in an inclusive democracy is the demotic assembly, i.e. the assembly of demos, the citizen body in a given geographical area which may encompass a town and the surrounding villages, or even neighbourhoods of large cities. An inclusive democracy today can only take the form of a confederal democracy that is based on a network of administrative councils whose members or delegates are elected from popular face-to-face democratic assemblies in the various demoi. Thus, their role is purely administrative and practical, not one of policy-making like that of representatives in representative democracy.

The citizen body is advised by experts but it is the citizen body which functions as the ultimate decision-taker . Authority can be delegated to a segment of the citizen body to carry out specific duties, for example to serve as members of popular courts, or of regional and confederal councils. Such delegation is made, in principle, by lot, on a rotation basis, and is always recallable by the citizen body. Delegates to regional and confederal bodies should have specific mandates.

====Participatory politics====
{{Main|Participatory politics}}
A [[Parpolity]] or Participatory Polity is a theoretical form of democracy that is ruled by a [[Parpolity|Nested Council]] structure. The guiding philosophy is that people should have decision making power in proportion to how much they are affected by the decision. Local councils of 25–50 people are completely autonomous on issues that affect only them, and these councils send delegates to higher level councils who are again autonomous regarding issues that affect only the population affected by that council.

A council court of randomly chosen citizens serves as a check on the [[tyranny of the majority]], and rules on which body gets to vote on which issue. Delegates may vote differently from how their sending council might wish, but are mandated to communicate the wishes of their sending council. Delegates are recallable at any time. Referendums are possible at any time via votes of most lower-level councils, however, not everything is a referendum as this is most likely a waste of time. A parpolity is meant to work in tandem with a [[participatory economy]].

====Cosmopolitan====
{{Main|Cosmopolitan democracy}}
Cosmopolitan democracy, also known as ''Global democracy'' or ''World Federalism'', is a political system in which democracy is implemented on a global scale, either directly or through representatives. An important justification for this kind of system is that the decisions made in national or regional democracies often affect people outside the constituency who, by definition, cannot vote. By contrast, in a cosmopolitan democracy, the people who are affected by decisions also have a say in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danielearchibugi.org/downloads/papers/CD_and_critics_A_review.pdf |title=Article on Cosmopolitan democracy by Daniele Archibugi |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725220629/http://www.danielearchibugi.org/downloads/papers/CD_and_critics_A_review.pdf |archivedate=25 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its supporters, any attempt to solve global problems is undemocratic without some form of cosmopolitan democracy. The general principle of cosmopolitan democracy is to expand some or all of the values and norms of democracy, including the rule of law; the non-violent resolution of conflicts; and equality among citizens, beyond the limits of the state. To be fully implemented, this would require reforming existing [[international organisations]], e.g. the [[United Nations]], as well as the creation of new institutions such as a [[World Parliament]], which ideally would enhance public control over, and accountability in, international politics.

Cosmopolitan Democracy has been promoted, among others, by physicist Albert Einstein,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neutrino.aquaphoenix.com/un-esa/ws1997-letter-einstein.html |title=letter by Einstein – "To the General Assembly of the United Nations" |accessdate= 2 July 2013}}, first published in United Nations World New York, Oct 1947, pp13-14&lt;/ref&gt; writer Kurt Vonnegut, columnist [[George Monbiot]], and professors [[David Held]] and [[Daniele Archibugi]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniele Archibugi &amp; David Held, eds., ''Cosmopolitan Democracy. An Agenda for a New World Order'', Polity Press, Cambridge, 1995; David Held, ''Democracy and the Global Order'', Polity Press, Cambridge, 1995, Daniele Archibugi, [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8737.html ''The Global Commonwealth of Citizens. Toward Cosmopolitan Democracy''], Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the [[International Criminal Court]] in 2003 was seen as a major step forward by many supporters of this type of cosmopolitan democracy.

====Creative democracy====
{{Main|Creative democracy}}
Creative Democracy is advocated by American philosopher [[John Dewey]]. The main idea about Creative Democracy is that democracy encourages individual capacity building and the interaction among the society. Dewey argues that democracy is a way of life in his work of "Creative Democracy: The Task Before Us"&lt;ref&gt;http://pages.uoregon.edu/koopman/courses_readings/dewey/dewey_creative_democracy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and an experience built on faith in human nature, faith in human beings, and faith in working with others. Democracy, in Dewey's view, is a [[Morality|moral ideal]] requiring actual effort and work by people; it is not an institutional concept that exists outside of ourselves. "The task of democracy", Dewey concludes, "is forever that of creation of a freer and more humane experience in which all share and to which all contribute".

====Guided democracy====
{{Main|Guided democracy}}
Guided democracy is a form of democracy which incorporates regular popular elections, but which often carefully "guides" the choices offered to the electorate in a manner which may reduce the ability of the electorate to truly determine the type of government exercised over them.  Such democracies typically have only one central authority which is often not subject to meaningful public review by any other governmental authority.  Russian-style democracy has often been referred to as a "Guided democracy."&lt;ref&gt;[https://muse.jhu.edu/article/17149/pdf Ten Years After the Soviet Breakup: From Democratization to "Guided Democracy"] Journal of Democracy. By Archie Brown. Oct. 2001. Downloaded 28 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Russian politicians have referred to their government as having only one center of power/ authority, as opposed to most other forms of democracy which usually attempt to incorporate two or more naturally competing sources of authority within the same government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russialist.org/archives/2009-35-32.php Putin’s Rule: Its Main Features and the Current Diarchy] Johnson's Russia List.

==Non-governmental democracy==
Aside from the public sphere, similar democratic principles and mechanisms of voting and representation have been used to govern other kinds of groups. Many [[non-governmental organisation]]s decide policy and leadership by voting. Most [[trade union]]s and [[cooperative]]s are governed by democratic elections. [[Corporation]]s are controlled by [[shareholder]]s on the principle of [[one share, one vote]] - sometimes supplemented by [[workplace democracy]]. [[Amitai Etzioni]] has postulated a system that fuses elements of democracy with [[sharia law]], termed ''islamocracy''.&lt;ref&gt;

==Theory&lt;!--'Democratic theory' redirects here--&gt;==
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|upright|A marble statue of [[Aristotle]]]]

===Aristotle===
[[Aristotle]] contrasted rule by the many (democracy/[[timocracy]]), with rule by the few ([[oligarchy]]/[[aristocracy]]), and with rule by a single person ([[tyranny]] or today [[autocracy]]/[[absolute monarchy]]). He also thought that there was a good and a bad variant of each system (he considered democracy to be the degenerate counterpart to timocracy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.8.viii.html |title=Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, Book VIII, Chapter 10 (1160a.31-1161a.9) |publisher=Internet Classics Archive |date= |accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/aristotl.htm|title=Aristotle |publisher= Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Aristotle the underlying principle of democracy is freedom, since only in a democracy can the citizens have a share in freedom. In essence, he argues that this is what every democracy should make its aim. There are two main aspects of freedom: being ruled and ruling in turn, since everyone is equal according to number, not merit, and to be able to live as one pleases.

{{quote|But one factor of liberty is to govern and be governed in turn; for the popular principle of justice is to have equality according to number, not worth,&amp;nbsp;... And one is for a man to live as he likes; for they say that this is the function of liberty, inasmuch as to live not as one likes is the life of a man that is a slave.|[[Aristotle]]|''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' 1317b (Book 6, Part II)}}

===Early Republican theory===
A common view among early and renaissance [[Republicanism|Republican]] theorists was that democracy could only survive in small political communities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8304.html|title=Deudney, D.: Bounding Power: Republican Security Theory from the Polis to the Global Village. (eBook and Paperback)|website=press.princeton.edu|access-date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heeding the lessons of the Roman Republic's shift to monarchism as it grew larger, these Republican theorists held that the expansion of territory and population inevitably led to tyranny.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Democracy was therefore highly fragile and rare historically, as it could only survive in small political units, which due to their size were vulnerable to conquest by larger political units.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Montesquieu]] famously said, "if a republic is small, it is destroyed by an outside force; if it is large, it is destroyed by an internal vice."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] asserted, "It is, therefore the natural property of small states to be governed as a republic, of middling ones to be subject to a monarch, and of large empires to be swayed by a despotic prince."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Rationale===
Among modern political theorists, there are three contending conceptions of the fundamental rationale for democracy: ''aggregative democracy,'' ''[[deliberative democracy]],'' and ''[[radical democracy]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/354048|last1=Springer|first1=Simon|title=Public Space as Emancipation: Meditations on Anarchism, Radical Democracy, Neoliberalism and Violence|journal=Antipode|volume=43|issue=2|year=2011|pages=525–62|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8330.2010.00827.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aggregative====
The theory of ''aggregative democracy'' claims that the aim of the democratic processes is to solicit citizens' preferences and aggregate them together to determine what social policies society should adopt. Therefore, proponents of this view hold that democratic participation should primarily focus on [[voting]], where the policy with the most votes gets implemented.

Different variants of aggregative democracy exist. Under ''minimalism'', democracy is a system of government in which citizens have given teams of political leaders the right to rule in periodic elections. According to this minimalist conception, citizens cannot and should not "rule" because, for example, on most issues, most of the time, they have no clear views or their views are not well-founded. [[Joseph Schumpeter]] articulated this view most famously in his book ''Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Schumpeter]], (1950). ''Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy''. Harper Perennial. {{ISBN|0-06-133008-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary proponents of minimalism include [[William H. Riker]], [[Adam Przeworski]], [[Richard Posner]].

According to the theory of [[direct democracy]], on the other hand, citizens should vote directly, not through their representatives, on legislative proposals. Proponents of direct democracy offer varied reasons to support this view. Political activity can be valuable in itself, it socialises and educates citizens, and popular participation can check powerful elites. Most importantly, citizens do not really rule themselves unless they directly decide laws and policies.

Governments will tend to produce laws and policies that are close to the views of the median voter—with half to their left and the other half to their right. This is not actually a desirable outcome as it represents the action of self-interested and somewhat unaccountable political elites competing for votes. [[Anthony Downs]] suggests that ideological political parties are necessary to act as a mediating broker between individual and governments. Downs laid out this view in his 1957 book ''An Economic Theory of Democracy''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Downs]], (1957). ''An Economic Theory of Democracy''. Harpercollins College. {{ISBN|0-06-041750-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert A. Dahl]] argues that the fundamental democratic principle is that, when it comes to binding collective decisions, each person in a political community is entitled to have his/her interests be given equal consideration (not necessarily that all people are equally satisfied by the collective decision). He uses the term [[polyarchy]] to refer to societies in which there exists a certain set of institutions and procedures which are perceived as leading to such democracy. First and foremost among these institutions is the regular occurrence of free and open [[elections]] which are used to select representatives who then manage all or most of the public policy of the society. However, these polyarchic procedures may not create a full democracy if, for example, poverty prevents political participation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert A. Dahl|Dahl, Robert]], (1989). ''Democracy and its Critics.'' New Haven: Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-300-04938-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Ronald Dworkin]] argues that "democracy is a substantive, not a merely procedural, ideal."&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Ronald (2006). ''Is Democracy Possible Here?'' Princeton: Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|9780691138725}}, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deliberative====
''[[Deliberative democracy]]'' is based on the notion that democracy is government by [[deliberation]]. Unlike aggregative democracy, deliberative democracy holds that, for a democratic decision to be legitimate, it must be preceded by authentic deliberation, not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting. ''Authentic deliberation'' is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power, such as power a decision-maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups.&lt;ref&gt;Gutmann, Amy, and Dennis Thompson (2002). ''Why Deliberative Democracy?'' Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-691-12019-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Cohen, "Deliberation and Democratic Legitimacy" in Essays on Reason and Politics: Deliberative Democracy Ed. James Bohman and William Rehg (The MIT Press: Cambridge) 1997,
72–73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ethan J. "Can Direct Democracy Be Made Deliberative?", Buffalo Law Review, Vol. 54, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; If the decision-makers cannot reach [[consensus]] after authentically deliberating on a proposal, then they vote on the proposal using a form of majority rule.
Many theorists is discussing the conception of Debliberative Democracy, considering specially the thought of Jürgen Habermas.

====Radical====
''[[Radical democracy]]'' is based on the idea that there are hierarchical and oppressive power relations that exist in society. Democracy's role is to make visible and challenge those relations by allowing for difference, dissent and antagonisms in decision making processes.

==Criticism==
{{Main|Criticism of democracy}}

[[File:2011 Wisconsin Budget Protests 1 JO.jpg|thumb|Protests]]

===Inefficiencies===

Some economists have criticized the efficiency of democracy, citing the premise of the irrational voter, or a voter who makes decisions without all of the facts or necessary information in order to make a truly informed decision. Another argument is that democracy slows down processes because of the amount of input and participation needed in order to go forward with a decision. A common example often quoted to substantiate this point is the high economic development achieved by China (a non-democratic country) as compared to India (a democratic country). According to economists, the lack of democratic participation in countries like China allows for unfettered economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Democracy a Pre-Condition in Economic Growth? A Perspective from the Rise of Modern China|url=https://unchronicle.un.org/article/democracy-pre-condition-economic-growth-perspective-rise-modern-china|website=UN Chronicle|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Socrates]] was of the belief that democracy without educated masses (educated in the more broader sense of being knowledgeable and responsible) would only lead to populism being the criteria to become an elected leader, and not competence. This would ultimately lead to a demise of the nation. This was quoted by Plato in book 10 of The Republic, in Socrates' conversation with Adimantus.&lt;ref name="Republic"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conversation of Socrates|first1=Plato|last2=H|first2=Translated by Spens|title=The Republic of Plato - Book ten - A conversation between Socrates and Admimantus}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates was of the opinion that the right to vote must not be an indiscriminate right (for example by birth or citizenship), but must be given only to people who thought sufficiently of their choice.

===Popular rule as a façade===

The 20th-century Italian thinkers [[Vilfredo Pareto]] and [[Gaetano Mosca]] (independently) argued that democracy was illusory, and served only to mask the reality of elite rule. Indeed, they argued that elite oligarchy is the unbendable law of human nature, due largely to the apathy and division of the masses (as opposed to the drive, initiative and unity of the elites), and that democratic institutions would do no more than shift the exercise of power from oppression to manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;Femia, Joseph V. "Against the Masses", Oxford 2001&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Louis Brandeis]] once professed, "We may have democracy, or we may have [[wealth]] concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both."{{clarify|date=March 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Dilliard, Iriving. "Mr. Justice Brandeis, Great American", Modern View Press 1941, p. 42. Quoting Raymond Lonergan. See, http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015009170443;seq=56;view=1up;num=42{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mob rule===

[[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' presents a critical view of democracy through the narration of [[Socrates]]: "Democracy, which is a charming form of government, full of variety and disorder, and dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequaled alike."&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''the Republic of Plato'' (London: J.M Dent &amp; Sons LTD.; New York: E.P. Dutton &amp; Co. Inc.), 558-C.&lt;/ref&gt; In his work, Plato lists [[Plato's five regimes|5 forms of government]] from best to worst. Assuming that ''the Republic'' was intended to be a serious critique of the political thought in Athens, Plato argues that only Kallipolis, an aristocracy led by the unwilling philosopher-kings (the wisest men), is a just form of government.&lt;ref&gt;The contrast between Plato's theory of philosopher-kings, arresting change, and Aristotle's embrace of change, is the historical tension espoused by [[Karl Raimund Popper]] in his WWII treatise, ''The Open Society and its Enemies'' (1943).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Madison]] critiqued direct democracy (which he referred to simply as "democracy") in [[Federalist No. 10]], arguing that representative democracy—which he described using the term "republic"—is a preferable form of government, saying: "...&amp;nbsp;democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths." Madison offered that republics were superior to democracies because republics safeguarded against [[tyranny of the majority]], stating in [[Federalist No. 10]]: "the same advantage which a republic has over a democracy, in controlling the effects of faction, is enjoyed by a large over a small republic".

===Political instability===

More recently, democracy is criticised for not offering enough political stability. As governments are frequently elected on and off there tends to be frequent changes in the policies of democratic countries both domestically and internationally. Even if a political party maintains power, vociferous, headline grabbing protests and harsh criticism from the popular media are often enough to force sudden, unexpected political change. Frequent policy changes with regard to business and immigration are likely to deter investment and so hinder economic growth. For this reason, many people have put forward the idea that democracy is undesirable for a developing country in which economic growth and the reduction of poverty are top priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7671283.stm | work=BBC News | title=Head to head: African democracy | date=16 October 2008 | accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This opportunist alliance not only has the handicap of having to cater to too many ideologically opposing factions, but it is usually short lived since any perceived or actual imbalance in the treatment of coalition partners, or changes to leadership in the coalition partners themselves, can very easily result in the coalition partner withdrawing its support from the government.

Biased media has been accused of causing political instability, resulting in the obstruction of democracy, rather than its promotion.&lt;ref&gt;''The Review of Policy Research, Volume 22, Issues 1–3'', Policy Studies Organization, Potomac Institute for Policy Studies. Blackwell Publishing, 2005. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fraudulent elections===

In representative democracies, it may not benefit incumbents to conduct fair elections. A study showed that incumbents who rig elections stay in office 2.5 times as long as those who permit fair elections.&lt;ref name="wp091108"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/06/AR2009110601906.html |title=5 myths about the beauty of the ballot box |accessdate= |author=Paul Collier |authorlink=Paul Collier |coauthors= |date=8 November 2009 |year= |month= |work= Washington Post |publisher=Washington Post |page=B2 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Democracies in countries with high per capita income have been found to be less prone to violence, but in countries with low incomes the tendency is the reverse.&lt;ref name="wp091108"/&gt; Election misconduct is more likely in countries with low per capita incomes, small populations, rich in natural resources, and a lack of institutional checks and balances. Sub-Saharan countries, as well as Afghanistan, all tend to fall into that category.&lt;ref name="wp091108"/&gt;

Governments that have frequent elections tend to have significantly more stable economic policies than those governments who have infrequent elections. However, this trend does not apply to governments where fraudulent elections are common.&lt;ref name="wp091108"/&gt;

===Opposition===

{{Main|Anti-democratic thought}}
Democracy in modern times has almost always faced opposition from the previously existing government, and many times it has faced opposition from social elites. The implementation of a democratic government within a non-democratic state is typically brought about by [[democratic revolution]].

Post-Enlightenment ideologies such as [[fascism]], [[nazism]], [[communism]] and [[fundamentalism|neo-fundamentalism]] oppose democracy on different grounds, generally citing that the concept of democracy as a constant process is flawed and detrimental to a preferable course of development.

==Development==
{{main|Democratization}}
Several philosophers and researchers have outlined historical and social factors seen as supporting the evolution of democracy.

Other commentators have mentioned the influence of economic development.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1951731 | author = Lipset, Seymour Martin. | year = 1959 | title = Some Social Requisites of Democracy: Economic Development and Political Legitimacy| journal = American Political Science Review | volume = 53 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–105 | jstor =  1951731 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a related theory, [[Ronald Inglehart]] suggests that improved living-standards in modern developed countries can convince people that they can take their basic survival for granted, leading to increased emphasis on [[self-expression values]], which correlates closely with democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Inglehart, Ronald. Welzel, Christian ''Modernisation, Cultural Change and Democracy: The Human Development Sequence'', 2005. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Inglehart |first1=Ronald F. |title=Cultural Evolution: People's Motivations Are Changing, and Reshaping the World |date=2018 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |doi=10.1017/9781108613880 |isbn=9781108613880 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas M. Gibler and Andrew Owsiak in their study argued about the importance of peace and stable borders for the development of democracy. It has often been assumed that [[democratic peace theory|democracy causes peace]], but this study shows that, historically, peace has almost always predated the establishment of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gibler |first1=Douglas M. |last2=Owsiak |first2=Andrew |title=Democracy and the Settlement of International Borders, 1919-2001 |journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution |volume=62 |issue=9 |pages=1847–1875 |date=2017 |doi=10.1177/0022002717708599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carroll Quigley]] concludes that the characteristics of weapons are the main predictor of democracy:&lt;ref&gt;Foreword, written by historian [http://paw.princeton.edu/memorials/24/79/index.xml Harry J Hogan] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130901040610/http://paw.princeton.edu/memorials/24/79/index.xml |date= 1 September 2013 }} in 1982, to Quigley's ''Weapons Systems and Political Stability''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also Chester G Starr, Review of ''Weapons Systems and Political Stability'', American Historical Review, Feb 1984, p98, available at [http://www.carrollquigley.net/book-reviews/Review-of-Weapons-Systems-Political-Stability-Starr.htm carrollquigley.net]&lt;/ref&gt; Democracy - this scenario - tends to emerge only when the best weapons available are easy for individuals to obtain and use.&lt;ref name="Quigley1983-38"&gt;{{cite book |author= Carroll Quigley |title= Weapons systems and political stability: a history |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=L6e2AAAAIAAJ |accessdate= 20 May 2013 |year= 1983 |publisher= University Press of America |isbn= 978-0-8191-2947-5 |pages=38–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1800s, guns were the best personal weapons available, and in the United States of America (already nominally democratic), almost everyone could afford to buy a gun, and could learn how to use it fairly easily.

Other theories stressed the relevance of [[education]] and of [[human capital]] – and within them of [[intelligence|cognitive ability]] to increasing tolerance, rationality, political literacy and participation. Two effects of education and cognitive ability are distinguished:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glaeser | first1 = E. | last2 = Ponzetto | first2 = G. | last3 = Shleifer | first3 = A. | year = 2007 | title = Why does democracy need education? | url = http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:27867132| journal = Journal of Economic Growth | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 77–99 | doi=10.1007/s10887-007-9015-1 | access-date = 3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=August 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deary | first1 = I.

One possible mediator of these relationships is the attainment of higher stages of moral judgment fostered by cognitive ability, which is necessary for the function of democratic rules in society. The other mediators for citizens as well as for leaders could be the increased competence and willingness to process and seek information necessary for political decisions due to greater cognitive ability. There are also weaker and less stable reverse effects of the rule of law and political freedom on cognitive ability.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* a cognitive effect (competence to make rational choices, better information-processing)
* an ethical effect (support of democratic values, freedom, human rights etc.), which itself depends on intelligence.

Evidence consistent with conventional theories of why democracy emerges and is sustained has been hard to come by. Statistical analyses have challenged [[modernisation theory]] by demonstrating that there is no reliable evidence for the claim that democracy is more likely to emerge when countries become wealthier, more educated, or less unequal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Albertus |first1= Michael |first2= Victor |last2= Menaldo |title= Coercive Capacity and the Prospects for Democratisation |journal= Comparative Politics |volume= 44 |issue= 2 |year= 2012 |pages= 151–69 |doi= 10.5129/001041512798838003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither is there convincing evidence that increased reliance on oil revenues prevents democratisation, despite a vast theoretical literature on "[[the Resource Curse]]" that asserts that oil revenues sever the link between citizen taxation and government accountability, seen as the key to representative democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.plawlotic.com/?p=8 | title= The Resource Curse: Does the Emperor Have no Clothes?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of evidence for these conventional theories of democratisation have led researchers to search for the "deep" determinants of contemporary political institutions, be they geographical or demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy |last1= Acemoglu |first1= Daron |authorlink1= Daron Acemoglu |first2= James A. |last2= Robinson |year= 2006 |publisher= Cambridge Books, Cambridge University Press |isbn= 978-0-521-85526-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.plawlotic.com/?p=102 | title= Rainfall and Democracy}}&lt;/ref&gt; More inclusive [[institution]]s lead to democracy because as people gain more power, they are able to demand more from the elites, who in turn have to concede more things to keep their position.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} This virtuous circle may end up in democracy.

An example of this is the disease environment. Places with different mortality rates had different populations and productivity levels around the world. For example, in Africa, the [[tsetse fly]] - which afflicts humans and livestock - reduced the ability of Africans to plow the land. This made Africa less settled. As a consequence, political power was less concentrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Alsan, Marcella|doi= 10.1257/aer.20130604|url= https://www.dartmouth.edu/~neudc2012/docs/paper_285.pdf|year= 2015|title= The Effect of the TseTse Fly on African Development|journal= American Economic Review|volume= 105|issue= 1|pages= 382–410|citeseerx= 10.1.1.1010.2955}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also affected the colonial institutions European countries established in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Acemoglu, Daron; Johnson, Simon and Robinson, James |year= 2005|chapter= Institutions as a fundamental cause of long-run growth |title= Handbook of Economic Growth |volume= 1|pages= 385–472, Sections 1 to 4|doi= 10.1016/S1574-0684(05)01006-3|series= Handbook of Economic Growth|isbn= 9780444520418}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether colonial settlers could live or not in a place made them develop different institutions which led to different economic and social paths. This also affected the distribution of power and the collective actions people could take. As a result, some African countries ended up having democracies and others [[autocracies]].

An example of geographical determinants for democracy is having access to coastal areas and rivers. This natural endowment has a positive relation with economic development thanks to the benefits of [[trade]].&lt;ref&gt;Mellinger, Andrew D., Jeffrey Sachs, and John L. Gallup. (1999). [http://www.earthinstitute.columbia.edu/sitefiles/file/about/director/pubs/024.pdf "Climate, Water Navigability, and Economic Development"]. Working Paper.&lt;/ref&gt; Trade brought economic development, which in turn, broadened power. Rulers wanting to increase  revenues had to protect property-rights to create incentives for people to invest. As more people had more power, more concessions had to be made by the ruler and in many{{quantify|date=August 2018}} places this process lead to democracy. These determinants defined the structure of the society moving the balance of political power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Acemoglu, Daron; Johnson, Simon and Robinson, James |year= 2005|chapter= Institutions as a fundamental cause of long-run growth |title= Handbook of Economic Growth |volume= 1|pages= 385–472, Sections 5 to 10|doi= 10.1016/S1574-0684(05)01006-3|series= Handbook of Economic Growth|isbn= 9780444520418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, democracy has become such a popular method of reaching decisions that its application beyond politics to other areas such as entertainment, food and fashion, consumerism, urban planning, education, art, literature, science and theology has been criticised as "the reigning dogma of our time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Farrelly |first= Elizabeth |authorlink= Elizabeth Farrelly |title= Deafened by the roar of the crowd |url= http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/deafened-by-roar-of-the-crowd-20110914-1k9lo.html |publisher= The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate= 17 September 2011 |date= 15 September 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111230084034/http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/deafened-by-roar-of-the-crowd-20110914-1k9lo.html |archive-date= 30 December 2011 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument suggests that applying a populist or market-driven approach to art and literature (for example), means that innovative creative work goes unpublished or unproduced. In education, the argument is that essential but more difficult studies are not undertaken. Science, as a [[truth]]-based discipline, is particularly corrupted by the idea that the correct conclusion can be arrived at by popular vote. However, more recently, theorists{{which|date=August 2018}} have also advanced the concept [[epistemic democracy]] to assert that democracy actually does a good job tracking the truth.

Robert Michels asserts that although democracy can never be fully realised, democracy may be developed automatically in the act of striving for democracy: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The peasant in the fable, when on his death-bed, tells his sons that a treasure is buried in the field. After the old man's death the sons dig everywhere in order to discover the treasure. They do not find it. But their indefatigable labor improves the soil and secures for them a comparative well-being. The treasure in the fable may well symbolise democracy."&lt;ref name="Michels1915"&gt;{{cite book |author= Robert Michels |title= Political Parties |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ijae_UIez38C |accessdate =5 June 2013 |date= 1999 |origyear= 1962 by [[Collier's|Crowell-Collier]] |publisher= [[Transaction Publishers]] |isbn= 978-1-4128-3116-1 |page= 243}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dr. [[Harald Wydra]], in his book ''Communism and The Emergence of Democracy'' (2007), maintains that the development of democracy should not be viewed as a purely procedural or as a static concept but rather as an ongoing "process of meaning formation".&lt;ref&gt;Harald Wydra, Communism and the Emergence of Democracy, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007, pp. 22–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on Claude Lefort's idea of the empty place of power, that "power emanates from the people [...] but is the power of nobody", he remarks that democracy is reverence to a symbolic mythical authority - as in reality, there is no such thing as the people or ''demos''. Democratic political figures are not supreme rulers but rather temporary guardians of an empty place. Any claim to substance such as the [[collective good]], the [[public interest]] or the will of the nation is subject to the competitive struggle and times of for{{clarify|date=January 2016}} gaining the authority of office and government. The essence of the democratic system is an empty place, void of real people, which can only be temporarily filled and never be appropriated. The seat of power is there, but remains open to constant change. As such, people's definitions of "democracy" or of "democratic" progress throughout history as a continual and potentially never ending process of social construction.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2990">An '''envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary''', usually known as a '''minister''', was a diplomatic head of mission who was ranked below [[ambassador]]. A diplomatic mission headed by an envoy was known as a [[legation]] rather than an [[embassy]]. Under the system of [[diplomatic rank]]s established by the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815), an envoy was a diplomat of the second class who had [[plenipotentiary]] powers, i.e., full authority to represent the government. However, envoys did not serve as the personal representative of their country's head of state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Boczek |first1=Boleslaw |title=Diplomatic Agents: Heads of Permanent Missions |encyclopedia=International Law: A Dictionary |date=2005 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=9780810850781 |pages=47-48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 20th century, most diplomatic missions were legations headed by diplomats of the envoy rank. Ambassadors were only exchanged between [[great powers]], close allies, and related monarchies.&lt;ref name="dictionary3"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Berridge |first1=G. R. |last2=Lloyd |first2=Lorna |title=Legation |encyclopedia=The Palgrave Macmillan Dictionary of Diplomacy |date=2012 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=9780230302990 |edition=3rd |page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]] it was no longer considered acceptable to treat some nations as inferior to others, given the [[United Nations]] doctrine of equality of sovereign states. The rank of envoy gradually became obsolete as countries upgraded their relations to the ambassadorial rank.&lt;ref name="dictionary3"/&gt; The envoy rank still existed in 1961, when the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] was signed, but it did not outlive the decade. The last remaining American legations, in the [[Warsaw Pact]] countries of Bulgaria and Hungary, were upgraded to embassies in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/countries/hungary|title=Hungary - Countries - Office of the Historian|website=history.state.gov|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other usages of the title==
===Popular parlance===
In popular parlance, an envoy can mean a diplomat of any rank. Moreover, the rank of envoy should not be confused with the position of [[Diplomatic rank#Multilateral diplomacy|Special Envoy]], which is a relatively modern invention, appointed for a specific purpose rather than for bilateral diplomacy, and may be held by a person of any [[diplomatic rank]] or none (though usually held by an ambassador).

===Kingdom of the Netherlands===
The [[Minister plenipotentiary (Netherlands)|minister plenipotentiary]] ({{lang-nl|gevolmachtigd minister}}) represents the Caribbean countries [[Aruba]], [[Curaçao]] and [[Sint Maarten]] in the [[Netherlands]], where they form part of the [[Council of Ministers of the Kingdom of the Netherlands|Council of Ministers of the Kingdom]].

'''Frances MacKeith''' (March 28, 1914 - December 14, 2011) was a British peace advocate.

==Biography==
MacKeith was born on March 28, 1914 in [[Young, New South Wales]]. Her father, [[Millais Culpin]], and mother were both doctors, and travelled with her extensively. In 1931, they attended a Nazi rally in Berlin. Five years later, she graduated from [[University College London]] with a degree in German. In 1938, MacKeith married Stephen MacKeith, and had six children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/jan/30/frances-mackeith-obituary|title=Frances MacKeith obituary|last=Tomic|first=Alice|date=2012-01-30|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-01-13|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A German teacher for much of her life, MacKeith also advocated for peace during the [[Aldermaston Marches]] in the 1950s and demonstrations against the Vietnam War in [[Grosvenor Square]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://peacemuseum.org.uk/object-of-the-month-blog-october-wicker-basket/|title=Object of the Month Blog – Wicker Basket » The Peace Museum|website=peacemuseum.org.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the protests, she joined the [[Quakers]], and continued to protest war. MacKeith worked against the [[Trident nuclear programme]] and taught prisoners in [[Winchester Prison]]. She died December 14, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.peacenews.info/node/6554/frances-mackeith-28-march-1914-14-december-2011|title=Frances MacKeith, 28 March 1914 - 14 December 2011 {{!}} Peace News|website=www.peacenews.info|language=en|access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacKeith was arrested over five times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/5585570.GRAN__89__IS_JAILED/|title=GRAN, 89, IS JAILED|website=Daily Echo|language=en|access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{update|date=February 2018}}
[[File:Michael Gove.jpg|thumb|right| Free schools have been advocated by the former Conservative Education Secretary [[Michael Gove]].]]

A '''free school in England''' is a type of [[Academy (English school)|academy]], a non-profit-making, independent, state-funded school which is free to attend but which is not wholly controlled by a [[local authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harrison |first=Angela |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/10138787.stm |title=What will make a school 'free'? |publisher=BBC News |date= 2010-05-26|accessdate=2010-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term applies to specific types of school; it is not a generic term for any school that does not charge fees. It is possible for a Local Authority to sponsor a free school in partnership with other organisations, provided they have no more than a 19.9% representation on the board of trustees.&lt;ref name="FreeSchoolGovernanceHandbook"&gt;{{cite web|title=Governance handbook:  For academies, multi-academy trusts and maintained schools|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/582868/Governance_Handbook_-_January_2017.pdf|website=Gov.uk|publisher=Department for Education|accessdate=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Studio school]]s and [[university technical college]]s are both sub-types of free school.&lt;ref name=FreeSchoolDefn&gt;{{cite web|title=Education Terms: Free Schools|url=http://www.education.gov.uk/vocabularies/educationtermsandtags/7123|work=DfE Website|publisher=Department for Education|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From May 2015, usage of the term free school was also extended to new academies set up via a local authority competition.&lt;ref name=FreeSchoolPresumption&gt;{{cite web|title=The free school presumption|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/451377/Academy_and_free_school_presumption_departmental_advice_2.pdf|website=Gov.uk|publisher=Department for Education|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other types of academy, free schools are governed by [[non-profit]] [[Charitable trusts in English law|charitable trusts]] that sign funding agreements with the [[Secretary of State for Education|Education Secretary]].&lt;ref name=CharitableTrust&gt;{{cite web|title=Charities and charity trustees – an introduction for school governors|url=http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Charity_requirements_guidance/Specialist_guidance/Education/introduction_for_school_governors.aspx|work=Charity Commission Website|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FundingAgreement&gt;{{cite web|title=Information for Free Schools opening in 2013 and beyond: Free School model funding agreement|url=http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/leadership/typesofschools/freeschools/b00222077/pre-opening/funding-agreement|work=Department for Education Website|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are different model funding agreements for single academy trusts and multi academy trusts.&lt;ref name=ModFundAgreement&gt;{{cite web|title=Free Schools model funding agreement|url=http://education.gov.uk/a0074737/funding-agreement|work=Department for Education Website|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FreeSchoolChains&gt;{{cite web|title=Governance Models and Challenges for Free School Chains|url=http://newschoolsnetwork.org/sites/default/files/Governance%20Models%20%26%20Challenges%20for%20FS%20Chains.pdf|work=New Schools Network Website|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2010 and 2015 more than 400 free schools were approved for opening in England by the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Coalition Government]], representing more than 230,000 school places across the country,&lt;ref name="Wave8approvals"/&gt; and numbers have continued to grow since that time.&lt;ref name="OpenAndPipelineFreeSchools"&gt;{{cite web|title=Free schools: open schools and successful applications|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-schools-open-schools-and-successful-applications|website=Gov.uk|publisher=Department for Education|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sixty-six free schools had totally or partially closed, or failed to open entirely, by April 2018, at an estimated cost of almost £150m in startup costs and capital funding. The concept has been described as a government obsession which should be abandoned as a failed experiment; the joint general secretary of the [[National Education Union]] (NEU) said "The government should hang its head in shame at this monumental waste of taxpayers’ money at a time when schools are severely underfunded".&lt;ref name=failed&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/25/free-schools-policy-under-fire-as-yet-another-closure-announced-plymouth |title=Free schools policy under fire as yet another closure announced |newspaper=The Guardian |date=25 April 2018  |author= Sally Weale  |accessdate= 25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
Free schools are subject to the same School Admissions Code as all other state-funded schools, although they are subject to [[the 50% Rule]] whereby oversubscribed free schools with a [[Faith school|faith designation]] must allocate at least half of their places without regard to faith.&lt;ref name=AdmissionsCode&gt;{{cite web|title=School admissions code|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-code|work=Gov.uk|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/increasing-the-number-of-academies-and-free-schools-to-create-a-better-and-more-diverse-school-system/supporting-pages/free-schools Increasing the number of academies and free schools to create a better and more diverse school system], Detail.&lt;/ref&gt;

Free schools are expected to offer a broad and balanced curriculum,&lt;ref name=HoCNote&gt;{{cite web|last=Gillie|first=Christine|title=Free schools|url=http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN06058.pdf|work=House of Commons Standard Note|publisher=Social Policy Section|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; are subject to the same [[Ofsted]] inspections as all other maintained schools and are expected to comply with standard performance measures.&lt;ref name="bbc-qa" /&gt;

To set up a free school, founding groups submit applications to the [[Department for Education]].&lt;ref name="GovUKSettingUpFreeSchool"/&gt; Groups include those run by parents, education charities and religious groups.&lt;ref name="FreeSchoolsWithFaithDes"/&gt;  Start-up grants are provided to establish the schools and ongoing funding is on an equivalent basis with other locally controlled [[State-funded schools (England)|state maintained schools]].&lt;ref name=Funding&gt;{{cite web|title=Free Schools FAQs – funding|url=http://www.education.gov.uk/a0075658/free-schools-faqs-funding|work=Department for Education Website|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy creation and implementation ==
Free schools were introduced by the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition]] following the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]] as part of the [[Big Society]] initiative to make it possible for parents, teachers, charities and businesses to set up their own schools.&lt;ref name=GovUKSettingUpFreeSchool&gt;{{cite web|title=Setting up a Free School|url=https://www.gov.uk/set-up-free-school|work=GOV.UK Quick Answer|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free schools are an extension of the existing [[Academy (English school)|academies programme]].&lt;ref name="bbc-qa"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/10161371.stm Q&amp;A: Academies and free schools], BBC News, 22 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Academies Act 2010]], which allowed all existing state schools to become academies, also authorised the creation of free schools. The first 24 free schools opened in autumn 2011.&lt;ref name="policy"&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/increasing-the-number-of-academies-and-free-schools-to-create-a-better-and-more-diverse-school-system Increasing the number of academies and free schools to create a better and more diverse school system] Policy.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Education Act 2011]] gave rise to the '''academy/free school presumption'''; Government advice which clarified that any local authority in need of a new school must in most circumstances seek proposals for an academy or free school,&lt;ref name=DfEAdviceNewSchools&gt;{{cite web|title=Establishing a new school advice for LAs and proposers|url=http://www.education.gov.uk/aboutdfe/advice/f00209212/establishing-new-school|work=Department for Education Website|accessdate=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a traditional [[Community school (England and Wales)|community school]] only being allowed if no suitable free school or academy is proposed.&lt;ref name=EdAct2011Schedule11&gt;{{cite web|title=Schedule 11: Establishment of new schools|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/21/schedule/11/enacted|work=Education Act 2011|accessdate=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015 the advice was renamed the '''free school presumption''' reflecting the fact that the newly elected [[Second Cameron ministry|Conservative Government]] regarded ''all'' new academies established after May 2015 as free schools.&lt;ref name=FreeSchoolPresumption/&gt;

== Types of free school ==
The majority of free schools are similar in size and shape to other [[Academy (English school)#Types of academy|types of academy]]. However, the following are distinctive sub-types of free school:&lt;ref name=AcademyTypes&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of academy|url=http://www.ssatuk.co.uk/ssat/support/academies/about-academies/types-of-academy/|work=SSAT Website|publisher=Specialist Schools and Academies Trust|accessdate=3 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503185240/http://www.ssatuk.co.uk/ssat/support/academies/about-academies/types-of-academy/|archivedate=3 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Studio school]] – A small free school, usually with around 300 pupils, using project-based learning&lt;ref name=GovTypesOfSchool&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of school|url=https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school/free-schools|work=Gov.uk|publisher=Department for Education|accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[University Technical College]] – A free school for the 14–18 age group, specialising in practical, employment focused subjects, sponsored by a university, employer or [[further education college]].&lt;ref name="GovTypesOfSchool"/&gt;&lt;ref name=UTCColleges&gt;{{cite web|title=UTC Colleges Overview|url=http://www.utcolleges.org/about/overview/|website=UTC Colleges|publisher=Baker Dearing Educational Trust|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approvals ==

The Department for Education publishes and maintains the list of established free schools and those that are due to be established.&lt;ref name=FreeSchoolList&gt;{{cite web|title=Free schools: successful applications and open schools – 2014|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-schools-successful-applications-and-open-schools-2014|website=Gov.uk|publisher=Department for Education|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Free schools approvals are processed and announced in batches, known as 'waves'.&lt;ref name=FreeSchoolFoIWave1and2&gt;{{cite web|title=Name, Local Authority, Previous school name, and Faith designation of applications to open a Free School – waves 1 and 2|url=http://www.education.gov.uk/aboutdfe/foi/disclosuresaboutschools/a00221774/wave-1-2-free-school-la-school-name-faith-designation|work=Department for Education website|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wave 1:''' In the autumn of 2010, Education Secretary [[Michael Gove]] announced that 16 proposals for free schools had been given a green light by the Government and were expected to open in September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://media.education.gov.uk/assets/files/pdf/f/written%20ministerial%20statement%20relating%20to%20new%20free%20school%20proposals.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

This number eventually grew to 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harrison|first=Angela|title=Free schools: 24 set to open in September|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-14692038|accessdate=13 April 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The free schools set to open in 2011|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-13810941|accessdate=15 April 2013|newspaper=BBC News website|date=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five of the original 16 schools were [[faith school]]s: two Jewish, one Evangelical Anglican, one Hindu and one Sikh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11197827 |date=6 September 2010 |title=First 16 'free schools' details set out |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wave 2:''' In September 2012 the Department of Education announced 55 new free schools would open that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free schools: 55 to open this month|url=http://www.education.gov.uk/inthenews/inthenews/a00213530/new-free-schools-open|work=Department for Education Press Release|accessdate=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wave 10 and beyond:''' In July 2015, the recently elected Conservative Government invited a tenth wave of free school applications to be submitted in October the same year.

== Similar models in other countries ==
The free school concept is based on similar schools found in Sweden,&lt;ref name=SwedishFreeSchools&gt;{{cite web|title=Free Schools in Sweden|url=http://newschoolsnetwork.org/free-schools/international-examples/free-schools-sweden|work=New Schools Network Website|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chile,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Schools should be run in the public interest|url=http://www.govtoday.co.uk/education/38-schools/12180-schools-should-be-run-in-the-public-interest|work=Govtoday Website|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand (an overlap between [[Designated Special Character schools|designated special character schools]] and partnership schools),&lt;ref name=NZPartnershipSchools&gt;{{cite web|title=Partnership Schools Working Group|url=http://nzmcs.education.govt.nz/|work=New Zealand Government Website|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charter Schools|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/charter-schools|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Charter School Resource Center|url=http://www.charterschoolcenter.org/|work=National Charter School Resource Centre website|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In both Canada and the US they are known as [[charter school]]s.

==Qualification of teachers==
Unlike local authority maintained schools in England, but in common with other types of [[Academy (English school)|academy]] and with independent schools, free schools are allowed to employ teachers without [[Qualified Teacher Status]] (QTS). The [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Coalition government]] said this freedom enables "innovation, diversity and flexibility"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101115/debtext/101115-0001.htm|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 15 Nov 2010  (pt 0001)|first=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons,|last=Westminster|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "the dynamism that characterises the best independent schools".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/debtext/130909-0001.htm#13090914000020|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 09 Sep 2013  (pt 0001)|first=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons,|last=Westminster|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]  have expressed their opposition to this and said that if elected they would require teachers in academies and free schools be "properly qualified".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/labour-pledge-to-stop-state-schools-employing-unqualified-teachers-9060058.html|title=Labour pledge to stop state schools employing unqualified teachers|first=Richard|last=Garner|publisher=The Independent|date=15 January 2014|accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect==
The centre-right think tank [[Policy Exchange]] claimed in 2015 that free schools affect the performance of the pupils in surrounding schools. Their assessment was that the results in low-performing schools located in the vicinity of a free school out-perform similar schools that do not have a free school nearby, and also that free schools are eight times more likely to be in England’s most deprived areas than the least deprived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/secondaryeducation/11459227/Why-500-new-free-schools-are-good-news-for-England.html|title=Why 500 new free schools are good news for England|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
When the free school policy was first announced, some commentators offered advice to potential proposers,&lt;ref name="telegraph1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tuck |first=Vicky |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/7636404/Want-to-open-a-Tory-free-school-Take-a-leaf-out-of-the-Victorians-book.html |title=Want to open a Tory 'free school'? Take a leaf out of the Victorians' book |publisher=Telegraph |date=2010-04-26 |accessdate=2010-05-26 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others expressed scepticism that the concept could be made to work at all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/63793,news-comment,news-politics,tory-free-schools-who-going-to-pay-for-them-education Tory free schools: who’s going to pay for them?], ''The First Post'', 26 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of free schools, such as the Conservative Party, claimed that they would "create more local competition and drive-up standards".&lt;ref name="telegraph2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Paton |first=Graeme |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/7505255/Teachers-attack-Tory-free-school-plans.html |title=Teachers attack Tory 'free school' plans |publisher=Telegraph |date=2010-03-23 |accessdate=2010-05-26 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also felt they would allow parents to have more choice in the type of education their child receives, much like parents who send their children to independent schools do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thorpe-Apps|first=Andrew|title=Why Free Schools are the Future|url=http://thebackbencher.co.uk/why-free-schools-are-the-future/|work=The Backbencher website|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics argued that the policy would benefit only [[middle-class]] parents with the time to set up free schools and that they would divert money away from existing schools.&lt;ref name="bbc-qa"/&gt; Supporters of free schools said that they would benefit children from all backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Young|first=Toby|title=Left unleashes furious assault on free schools in attempt to force another U-turn|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tobyyoung/100092216/left-unleashes-furious-assault-on-free-schools-in-attempt-to-force-another-u-turn/|accessdate=13 April 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=15 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people were concerned that free schools are not obliged to cap their headteachers' pay.&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1281618/Michael-Gove-sparks-anger-refusing-rule-cap-pay-academy-headteachers.html Anger as Michael Gove refuses to set a cap on pay for academy headteachers], ''[[Daily Mail]]'', 27 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of available research on the Swedish model that partially inspired the policy was published in a paper by Rebecca Allen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10376457 | date=22 June 2010 |title=Doubts cast over Swedish-style free schools |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It concluded, "The econometric evidence on the effect of the reforms suggests that, so far, Swedish pupils do not appear to be harmed by the competition from private schools, but the new schools have not yet transformed educational attainment in Sweden."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/cmpo/publications/bulletin/summer10/swedishfreeschools.pdf |title=Replicating Swedish ‘free school’ reforms in England |journal=Research in Public Policy |date=Summer 2010 |first=Rebecca |last=Allen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Wilby, writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', predicted that free schools would be run by private companies rather than parents, teachers or voluntary groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Peter Wilby |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/may/25/free-schools-private-companies |title=Private companies will run 'free schools' |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2010-05-25|accessdate=2010-05-26 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New Schools Network]] was subsequently set up to help groups develop the skills needed to set up free schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Set up a School|url=http://newschoolsnetwork.org/set-up-school|work=New Schools Network website|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harrison|first=Angela|title=Teachers are half of free school inquiries|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10354396|accessdate=14 April 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Carter, a Conservative [[councillor]], pointed out that under the funding arrangements in place at the time, "the more academies and Free Schools you operate, under the current academy funding arrangements, the less [money] maintained schools would get."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Francis Gilbert |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/27/tory-free-schools-inequality |title=Tory free schools will spread inequality |work=[[Comment is free]]|publisher=Guardian |date=2010-04-27 |accessdate=2010-05-26 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the Department for Education changed the funding arrangements for all maintained schools so that "schools in similar circumstances and with similar intakes receive similar levels of funding", whatever type of school they are.&lt;ref name=SchoolFundingReform&gt;{{cite web|title=School funding reform: Arrangements for 2013 – 14|url=https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/school%20funding%20reform%20-%20final%202013-14%20arrangements.pdf|work=Department for Education website|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A warning by the [[National Union of Teachers]] (NUT) that the policy would "fuel social segregation and undermine local democracy" was reported in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]''.&lt;ref name="telegraph2"/&gt; The NUT also said that free schools were neither wanted nor needed, based on a survey of a thousand parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-12099245 |title=Free schools 'not wanted' say teachers |date=3 January 2011 |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]] |first=Angela |last=Harrison}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Education Secretary accused free school opponents of subjecting supporters to personal attacks and even death threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Paton| first =Graeme| coauthors =| title =Michael Gove: free school applicants 'subjected to death threats'| newspaper =The Telegraph| date =19 February 2013| url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9881384/Michael-Gove-free-school-applicants-subjected-to-death-threats.html| accessdate =19 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department for Education said that free schools were popular with parents. Figures released in 2013 showed that 90% of free schools were over-subscribed with an average of three pupils competing for each place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9985028/Nine-in-10-of-the-Coalitions-free-schools-oversubscribed.html |title=Nine-in-10 of the Coalition's free schools 'oversubscribed' |journal=The Telegraph |first=Graeme |last=Paton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics pointed out that more than half of free schools opening in 2012 opened with 60% or less of the student numbers predicted by the impact assessment documents of each institution, leaving more than 10% spare places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/dec/13/half-free-schools-spare-places-figures |title=More than half of new free schools opened with spare places, figures show |journal=The Guardian |first=Warwick |last=Mansell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis by the [[British Humanist Association]] in 2013 found that the majority of free school applications were from religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Majority of identifiable Free School proposals from 2011–13 were religious|url=http://humanism.org.uk/2013/03/22/majority-of-identifiable-free-school-proposals-from-2011-13-were-religious/|work=British Humanist Association website|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FreeSchoolsWithFaithDes"&gt;{{cite web|title=List of free schools in England which are formally designated as faith schools|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List:_List_of_free_schools_in_England_which_are_formally_designated_as_faith_schools|website=Wikipedia|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=February 2018}} The Catholic Education Service  said that it would not open free schools because their [[The 50% Rule|admissions rules]] would only let them reserve 50% of places for children from Catholic families, unlike [[Voluntary aided school|Voluntary Aided]] schools which can select up to 100% of places using faith criteria.&lt;ref name=freeButFettered&gt;{{cite news|last=Sutcliffe|first=Jeremy|title=Free but fettered|url=http://www.thetablet.co.uk/features/2/677/free-but-fettered|accessdate=22 April 2014|newspaper=The Tablet|date=26 Oct 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Education Secretary [[Michael Gove]] said in 2011 he had ruled out religious fundamentalist groups being able to set up free schools.&lt;ref name=TESGoveCreationistFreeSchools&gt;{{cite news|last=Marley|first=David|title=Gove banishes creationist groups from free schools|url=http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6086004|accessdate=23 April 2013|newspaper=Times Educational Supplement|date=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, following publication of a leaked document 'Future Academy System' prepared for schools minister [[John Nash, Baron Nash|Lord Nash]], critics claimed that failing free schools were being given special fast-track attention by the government to limit potential embarrassment to Michael Gove, the Education Secretary at the time. The leaked document stated that the "political ramifications of any more free schools being judged inadequate are very high and speedy intervention is essential."&lt;ref name="Michael Gove's bid to limit fallout from failing free schools"&gt;{{cite news|first=|title=Michael Gove's bid to limit fallout from failing free schools – revealed|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/apr/06/michael-gove-failing-free-schools|accessdate=6 April 2014|newspaper=The Observer|date=5 April 2014|author=Daniel Boffey|author2=Warwick Mansell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polling in April 2015 put public support for Conservative proposals to increase the number of free schools by at least 500 at 26%.&lt;ref name=YouGov/&gt; The 2015 Labour Party election manifesto proposed banning the creation of free schools in areas where there was a surplus of places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Holehouse |first=Matthew |date=13 Apr 2015 |title=Labour manifesto 2015: the key policies and what they mean for you |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/11532277/Labour-manifesto-2015-general-election-manifesto-and-policies.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |location= |access-date=23 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Friends of WikiLeaks''', sometimes reduced and stylized as '''FoWL''', was a surveillance-resistant [[Social networking service|social network site]] created in support of [[WikiLeaks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesoir-echos.com/fowl-le-%C2%AB%E2%80%89facebook-killer%E2%80%89%C2%BB/monde/45397/|title=FoWL, le " Facebook killer "|last=Girard|first=Céline |date=22 February 2012|publisher=[[Le Soir]]|language=French|accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in May 2012, the site was intended for those who support WikiLeaks and its activities to perform advocacy.&lt;ref name="bgr"&gt;{{cite web|title=WikiLeaks launches encrypted social network |first= Dan|last= Graziano |date=22 May 2012|publisher=bgr.com|url=http://www.bgr.com/2012/05/22/wikileaks-supportes-launch-social-network/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131204102457/http://bgr.com/2012/05/22/wikileaks-supportes-launch-social-network/ | archivedate = 2013-12-04| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wlfriends.org/ |title=Friends of Wikileads | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130809164256/https://wlfriends.org/ | archivedate = 2013-08-09| deadurl=yes}} website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Friends of WikiLeaks' fight for Assange's rights in European Court |date=19 June 2012 |publisher=RT.com |url=https://rt.com/news/friends-of-wikileaks-court-appeal-221/|accessdate=31 August 2012 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130502021333/http://rt.com/news/friends-of-wikileaks-court-appeal-221/ | archivedate = 2013-05-02| deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to more traditional forms of social networking, FoWL aimed at bringing together like-minded people who do not yet know each other. To achieve this goal, the site would ask about the language the user speaks as well as any preferences in the ways of hobbies or other activities. The site would then find six friends who share the user's views within your country, and another six from other parts of the world who speak your language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/343872/20120522/wikileaks-launches-wlfriends-social-network.htm |title=Wikileaks v Facebook: Friends of Wikileaks Social Network Launched - IBTimes UK |publisher=Ibtimes.co.uk |date=2012-05-22 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; If one of those friends cancelled their account or became inactive, a new friend would be matched to the user's circle and would replace the previous inactive one. 

{{rquote|right|"Friends of WikiLeaks is a network of people from across the globe who defend WikiLeaks, its people, its alleged sources and its mission"|Friends of WikiLeaks&lt;ref name="bgr" /&gt;}}

With the establishment of [[The Wikileaks Party]], the official Friends of WikiLeaks organization was shut down in 2013.  However, several of the groups still remain active on Twitter and the web as of 28 July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fowlchicago.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/friends-of-wikileaks-international-directory/|title=Friends of WikiLeaks International Directory - Updating July 2017|work=Friends of WikiLeaks - Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hill Creek Cultural Preservation and Energy Development Act''' ({{USBill|113|H.R.|356}}; {{USPL|113|133}}) is a United States public law that was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] of the [[113th United States Congress]] on January 23, 2013 by [[Rob Bishop|Rep. Rob Bishop (R-UT)]]. The law outlines a swap in the ownership of [[mineral rights]] of certain pieces of land located in Utah.  The United States federal government, Utah's School and Institutional Trust Land Administration (SITLA), and the [[Ute people|Ute Indian Tribe]] of the [[Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation|Uintah and Ouray Reservation]] are all involved in the exchange.

==Provisions/Elements of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on information provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]] and the [[Congressional Budget Office]], both [[public domain]] sources.''&lt;ref name=356sum&gt;{{cite web |title=H.R. 356 – Summary |url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/356 |publisher=United States Congress |accessdate=May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="356cbo" /&gt;

The Hill Creek Cultural Preservation and Energy Development Act would authorize the state of [[Utah]] to relinquish for the benefit of the [[Ute people|Ute Indian Tribe]] of the [[Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation|Uintah and Ouray Reservation]] certain of its school trust or subsurface mineral lands south of the border between [[Grand County, Utah|Grand County]] and [[Uintah County, Utah]], in exchange for certain federal subsurface mineral lands north of that border.&lt;ref name="356sum" /&gt;  The bill sets out the details of a mineral rights swap between Utah's School and Institutional Trust Land Administration (SITLA), the federal government, and the Ute Indian Tribe.&lt;ref name=356cbo&gt;{{cite web |title=CBO – H.R. 356  Hill Creek Cultural Preservation and Energy Development Act |url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44171 |publisher=Congressional Budget Office |accessdate=May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hill Creek Cultural Preservation and Energy Development Act establishes a framework under which this switch can take place.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, about 18,000 acres are being considered in exchange for 18,000 different acres.&lt;ref name="356cbo" /&gt;

In setting up the conditions for the swap the bill directs the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] to reserve an overriding interest in a portion of the land being exchanged, namely that portion of the mineral estate composed of minerals subject to leasing under the [[Mineral Leasing Act of 1920|Mineral Leasing Act]] in the mineral lands conveyed to Utah.  The bill also requires Utah to reserve, for the benefit of its school trust, an overriding interest in that portion of the mineral estate composed of minerals subject to leasing under the Mineral Leasing Act in the mineral lands it relinquished to the federal government.&lt;ref name="356sum" /&gt;

==Procedural history==
The Hill Creek Cultural Preservation and Energy Development Act {{USBill|113|H.R.|356}} was introduced into the House by [[Rob Bishop|Rep. Rob Bishop (R-UT)]] on January 23, 2013.  It was referred to the [[United States House Committee on Natural Resources]] and then to two of its subcommittees, the [[United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Indian and Alaska Native Affairs]] and the [[United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=H.R. 356 – Committees |url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/356/committees |publisher=United States Congress |accessdate=May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   On April 24, 2013, it was ordered to be reported by Unanimous Consent by the House Committee on Natural Resources.&lt;ref name="356sum" /&gt; The House Majority Leader [[Eric Cantor]] announced on Friday May 10, 2013 that H.R. 1580 would be considered the following week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Majority Leader 5-13-13 |url=http://majorityleader.gov/floor/5-13-13.pdf |publisher=House Majority Leader |accessdate=May 13, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015230409/http://majorityleader.gov/floor/5-13-13.pdf |archivedate=October 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 15, 2013, the House voted in a [[voice vote]] to pass the bill.&lt;ref name=356actions&gt;{{cite web |title=H.R. 356 – Actions |url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/356/actions |publisher=United States Congress |accessdate=August 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill was sent to the [[United States Senate]] and referred to the [[United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources]]. On July 9, 2014, the Senate voted to pass the bill with [[unanimous consent]]. On July 25, 2014, President [[Barack Obama]] signed the bill into law.&lt;ref name="356actions" /&gt;

==Debate and discussion==
Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] supported the bill, arguing that it "gives Utahns greater opportunity to manage the specified lands and structures as they see fit."&lt;ref name=KUTVhatchbills&gt;{{cite news |title=Hatch Has Two Bills Pass In U.S. Senate |url=http://www.kutv.com/news/top-stories/stories/vid_12484.shtml |accessdate=August 1, 2014 |publisher=KUTV |date=July 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hatch argued that the bill "creates an important new opportunity for energy in our state."&lt;ref name="KUTVhatchbills" /&gt;

[[The Wilderness Society (United States)|The Wilderness Society]] supported the bill. A spokesman said that "this legislation will help protect one of the most ecologically critical and culturally sensitive lands in the country."&lt;ref name=WildernessSocietySupport&gt;{{cite web |last1=Spitler |first1=Paul |title=Praise for Passage of "Win-Win" Congressional Bill that Balances Conservation and Energy Development in Utah |url=http://wilderness.org/press-release/praise-passage-%E2%80%9Cwin-win%E2%80%9D-congressional-bill-balances-conservation-and-energy |publisher=The Wilderness Society |accessdate=August 1, 2014 |date=July 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Iraqi Academy of Sciences''' ([[Arabic]],'''المجمع العلمي العراقي''') is an academy in [[Baghdad]] founded in 1948 in order to develop and regulate the [[Arabic language]] in [[Iraq]] and the [[Arab World]].

The Academy also has two other departments to regulate and develop [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] and [[Aramaic]] ([[Syriac language|Syriac]]) in [[Iraq]]; those two departments were founded in 1963.

It was looted during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/3697/AlTikriti553.pdf?sequence=2 "Stuff Happens": A Brief Overview of the 2003 Destruction of Iraqi Manuscript Collections, Archives, and Libraries]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Samuel Nathaniel Tross''' (April 2, 1889 – March 30, 1971) was an evangelist and civil rights leader. He was born in Berbice, [[British Guiana]], which is located in [[South America]], on April 2, 1889. He attended [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] and later moved to Canada in 1913. During [[World War I]] Tross moved to the [[United States]] and attended [[Harvard University]]. He earned a Ph.D. in religion at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. In 1918 Tross married Geneva Hopkins. The couple eventually settled in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] where Tross continued his career as a pastor at several AME  and [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church|AME Zion]] churches in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/ark:/99166/w6k65ns7|title=Tross, J. S. Nathaniel (Joseph Samuel Nathaniel), 1889-1971.|website=socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 Tross wrote ''This Thing Called Religion''. A copy of his book is in the rare book collection of J Murrey Atkins Library.

Tross had many jobs. In 1940 he was president of the Community Crusaders, appearing before the Charlotte City Council to lobby for street lights in black neighborhoods. During World War II he was president of the Charlotte Rationing Board. After the war he lobbied for the employment of African Americans as police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.worldcat.org/archivegrid/collection/data/841574207|title=ArchiveGrid : Joseph Samuel Nathaniel Tross Collection, 1927-1971.|website=beta.worldcat.org|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1945 Tross began a weekly radio broadcast on WBT where he often discussed the idea of interracial goodwill in the community. He was the editor of ''[[The Charlotte Post]]'' an African American newspaper beginning in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rending the Veil|last=Bungarner-Davis|first=Marianne|publisher=UNC Charlotte|year=1971|isbn=|location=J Murrey Atkins Library|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960 Tross gained his American citizenship. As a result, he ran for a seat on the Charlotte School Board in 1994, 1966 and 1967, although he never won. In 1965 Tross met [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Lyndon B Johnson]] at the [[White House]] and advised Johnson not to acknowledge protesters sitting in at the White House because speaking would tarnish the dignity of the office of president. This advice created a split in the civil rights movement and created tension between Tross and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indigenous Civil Rights Movement|last=Griffin|first=Wille|publisher=UNC Charlotte|year=1972|isbn=|location=J Murrey Atkins Library|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YekTCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA154&amp;lpg=PA154&amp;dq=joseph+samuel+nathaniel+tross&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UYr-wNFnFY&amp;sig=jfmzwtLQs3UE6LObahOCK41yaZo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjx3Z7tu63QAhUq7IMKHVirBgEQ6AEIOTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=joseph%20samuel%20nathaniel%20tross&amp;f=false|title=Daddy Grace: A Celebrity Preacher and His House of Prayer|last=Dallam|first=Marie W.|date=2009-04-01|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814720370|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 30, 1971, Tross died from a stroke at the age of 82.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6994">The '''agrarian reform law of 1920''' in [[Latvia]] sought to transfer most of the land from [[Baltic nobility|Baltic German nobles]] to Latvian farmers. On September 16, 1920 [[Constitutional Assembly of Latvia]]  passed the law of the Land reform, which would break up large landholdings and redistribute land to those peasants who worked it and to the newly created Latvian State Land Fund.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucis.pitt.edu/nceeer/1996-810-23-3-Plakans.pdf Agrarian Reform in Latvia] University Center for International Studies&lt;/ref&gt;   Similar land reforms were carried out in [[Estonia]] ( September 24, 1920 ), [[Lithuania]] ( March 29, 1922 ) and [[Poland]] ( December 28, 1925 ). 
== Background ==
Before the [[World War I]] some 2% of landowners owned 53% of land in [[Kurzeme Planning Region|Kurzeme]] and [[Vidzeme]], in [[Latgale]] it was 38%. The Agrarian reform Law of September 16, 1920 created State Land Fund which took over 61% of all land.

== Objective ==
The main objectives of the reform were several - the creation of new farms and the expansion of already existing smallholder farms, by so doing, the division of land of former large-scale farms into smaller land areas, thereby acquiring land for the creation of new farms.  The creation of various economic enterprises, the satisfaction of social and cultural needs, is understood as implicit agrarian reform tasks as a consequence of the implementation of the reform.  The aim of the reform was also to find opportunities for the expansion of cities and towns, which means that the territories borrowed from the state reserve reserved areas for the development of populated areas. 
== Land reform law ==
The various parts of Land reform law has been adopted by [[Constitutional Assembly of Latvia]] at different times: 
*Part I "On the Establishment of the State Land Fund" (paragraph 26) was adopted  on 16 September, 1920. 
*Part II "On the Use of the State Land Fund" (Paragraph 19) was adopted by the Plenary Session of the Constituent Assembly on December 21, 1920.
*Part III "On strengthening agrarian reform" was issued on May 3, 1922. 
*The Law "On the Transfer of the Land Allotted to Private Ownership or Grant in the Hire of a Family " was issued on April 23rd, 1923.
*Part IV "On Land Surveillance Committees" (paragraph 21) was adopted on 17 September, 1920. 

The Land reform law expropriated the [[manor]] lands. Landowners were left with 50 hectares each and their land was distributed to the landless peasants without cost. In 1897, 61.2% of the rural population had been landless; by 1936, that percentage had been reduced to 18%. The extent of cultivated land surpassed the pre-war level already in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bleiere| first = Daina |author2=Ilgvars Butulis |author3=Antonijs Zunda |author4=Aivars Stranga |author5=Inesis Feldmanis| title = History of Latvia : the 20th century.| publisher = [[Jumava (publisher)|Jumava]]| location = [[Riga]]| pages = 195| year = 2006| isbn = 9984-38-038-6| oclc = 70240317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the World War I some 2% of landowners owned 53% of land in Kurzeme and Vidzeme, in Latgale it was 38%. The Agrarian reform Law of September 16, 1920 created State Land Fund which took over 61% of all land. The German nobles were left with no more than 50 ha of land. This destroyed their manor house system. Many of them sold their possessions and left for Germany. Former manor house buildings often were used as local schools, administrative buildings or hospitals. The land was distributed to a new class of small-holding farmers - over 54,000 Jaunsaimnieki (New farmers) with average farm size of 17,1 ha, who usually had to create their farms from nothing, in process building new houses and clearing fields. Due to their small size and unfavorable grain prices, the new farmers rapidly developed dairy farming. Butter, bacon and eggs became new export industries.
== Economic results ==
The agrarian reform was finally completed in 1937, transforming the country's economy and the Latvian society.  Agrarian reform can be regarded as a [[social revolution]] in which the foundations of changing agriculture were created from large-scale farms with large but economically inefficient farming units on small farms.  Legislators counted on emerging farms as economically productive, viable and cost-effective entities at the time.  Although many foreign economists questioned the economic justification of such a radical reform because it required huge investments - about 700 million lats, and therefore predicted an economic downturn. However agrarian reform lead to a rapid economic growth due to increased productivity, increased agricultural output per hectare and increased size of productive agricultural land.  When starting agrarian reform, Danish agriculture was largely a model, because it seemed most suitable for Latvia.  Already in 1930, at the beginning of the year, the country was fully supplied with agricultural products and exports began to grow.  In 1938  Latvia as the milk and meat exporter ranked fourth behind Denmark, Netherlands and Sweden.  
== Social consequences and owners compensation==
The driving force behind agrarian reform was more political than economic. 
As a result of agrarian reform the country's main natural treasures - land and forests changed it owners. The inherited feudal power over the state's main economic sectors was broken with elimination of feudal [[manor]] system, which connected  inherited [[mansion]]s ([[:de:Rittergut|Rittergut]]) with land around it.  At the same time, the social problems of counter-terrorism, which had radicalized the entire nation, were solved. 
 
The previous landowners affected by the reforms, mostly ethnic [[Baltic Germans]], did not received any compensation, however they were left with small fraction of previously owned land.

In 1924  the Baltic Germans demanded a payment of 1200 million [[gold franc]]s for expropriated land properties through a group of six their representatives in Latvia's parliament.  However just before the crucial vote on the 30th of April 1924, the Baltic German faction abandoned the hearing room, which led to the dismissal of the claim by a small majority.  Later, the German-speaking parliamentary faction appealed against the State of Latvia in the [[League of Nations]], requesting compensation for seized land, but that claim was also rejected. 

In 1929  Latvia signed an agreement with Poland, which resolved the controversial issues that were mostly related to the Latgale region.  The Latvian government paid 5 million lats for estates that were expropriated from [[Polish noblemen]] in course of agrarian reform.&lt;ref name="letonica"&gt;[https://www.letonika.lv/groups/default.aspx?cid=31790 1920 - 1937 Agrārā reforma ] {{lang-lv|Latvijas vēstures enciklopēdija}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) '''Lawrence O'Brien Award''' was created in 1992 by the family of [[Larry O'Brien|Lawrence Francis "Larry" O'Brien Jr.]] (1917-1990) and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] leaders to recognize the many years of service he gave to the party and his belief in the contribution of party [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s. Since then, party leaders presented this award on five occasions to 94 winners from across the [[United States]].

The award honors the importance of this contribution to the continuing success and vitality of the party. It's given to individuals and groups who exhibit a high degree of commitment and self-sacrifice on behalf of the party and its [[candidate]]s.

The award was expanded in 1998 to help mark the 150th anniversary of the DNC. Party leaders honored an individual or group from every [[commonwealth (United States)|commonwealth]], [[district]], [[U.S. state|state]] and [[territory (country subdivision)|territory]] and six individuals nationally.&lt;ref name = "1998 Lawrence O'Brien Awards: Recognizing Democratic Party Achievement"&gt;{{Cite conference

A news report which was published in 2000 by ''[[Insight (magazine)|Insight]]'' magazine described a 1998 controversy about e-mail messages which were written between [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]]-[[Al Gore|Gore]] [[Administration (government)|Administration]] staff members and [[1996 U.S. Presidential Election|1996 presidential reelection campaign]] staffers about political [[fundraising]] by Administration staffers. Some of the messages were written in 1996 and solicited the award for a campaign contributor.

==Selection==

Award winners are selected from among many [[nomination]]s received from party leaders, appointed and elected [[public official]]s, and other Democrats in the United States. Each winner worked at the local-, state- or national-party levels, including assisting candidates for elected public office. Furthermore, the winners made personal, family or financial sacrifices, or otherwise showed unusual or extraordinary dedication to the furtherance of the goals of the party, without financial remuneration or professional gain.

The '''Liberty Political Action Conference''' ('''LPAC''') was an annual political conference attended by [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] and [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] [[Activism|activists]] and elected officials from across the [[United States]]. The conference was held from 2011 to 2014, in various locations.

LPAC is hosted by [[Campaign for Liberty]], a [[501(c)(4)]] [[nonprofit]] that is currently chaired by former Congressman [[Ron Paul]] of Texas. 

==History==
The first Liberty Political Action Conference took place prior to the 2012 Republican primary season from September 15-17, 2011 in [[Reno]], [[Nevada]]. Speakers at the conference included Ron Paul, Senators [[Rand Paul]] and [[Mike Lee (U.S. politician)|Mike Lee]], Congressman [[Steve Stockman]], actors [[Vince Vaughn]] and [[Jerry Doyle]], [[Chuck Baldwin]], and [[Debra Medina]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jbs.org/commentary/join-jbs-at-lpac-2011-in-reno-sept-15-17 |title=Join JBS at LPAC 2011 in Reno, Sept. 15-17 |publisher=John Birch Society |accessdate=2013-04-05 |date=2011-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second LPAC took place following the 2012 Republican primary season, from September 13-15, 2012, and prior to the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]] in [[Chantilly, Virginia|Chantilly]], [[Virginia]] outside of [[Washington, D.C.]]. Speakers at the conference included Ron Paul, Senators Rand Paul, Mike Lee, [[Jim DeMint]] and [[Ted Cruz]], Congressman [[Justin Amash]] and [[Scott Garrett]], actor Jerry Doyle, [[Mallory Factor]], and Virginia Attorney General [[Ken Cuccinelli]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.independentamericanparty.org/2012/08/lpac-2012-heats-up/ |title=LPAC 2012 Heats Up |publisher=Independent American Party |accessdate=2013-04-05 |date=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political analysis by MassCentral.com said the ONDCP is "required by statute to 'take such actions as necessary to oppose any attempt to legalize'" cannabis at the federal level, and would be "intent on getting Donald Trump to reconsider his support for letting states go their own way in this area", labeling the effort anti-[[Federalism in the United States|federalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Anti-Pot Staffers Conspire to Turn Trump Against Marijuana Federalism|date=September 2, 2018|publisher=MassCentral.com |url=https://masscentral.com/anti-pot-staffers-conspire-to-turn-trump-against-marijuana-federalism/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Model United Nations''', also known as '''Model UN''' or '''MUN''', is an educational simulation and/or academic activity in which students can learn about [[diplomacy]], [[international relations]], and the [[United Nations]]. MUN involves and teaches participants speaking, debating, and writing skills, in addition to [[critical thinking]], teamwork, and [[leadership]] abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestdelegate.com/what-is-model-united-nations/|title=What is Model United Nations?|work=Best Delegate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.model-un.de/en/was-ist-mun/ |title=What does "Model United Nations" mean? |publisher=model-un.de |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually an extracurricular activity, some schools also offer Model UN as a class. It is meant to engage students and allow them to develop deeper understanding into current world issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.winthrop.edu/modelun/default.aspx?id=26613 |title=Model UN - Courses - Winthrop University |publisher=Winthrop University|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants in Model United Nations conferences, known as delegates, are placed in committees and assigned countries to represent, or occasionally other organizations or political figures, where they represent members of that body. They are presented with their assignments in advance, along with a topic or topics that their committee will discuss. Delegates conduct research before conferences and formulate positions that they will then [[debate]] with their fellow delegates in the committee, staying true to the actual position of the member they represent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unausa.org/global-classrooms-model-un/how-to-participate/getting-started/frequently-asked-questions#what_is |title=Getting Started - What is MUN? |publisher=UNA-USA |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of a conference, the best-performing delegates in each committee, as well as delegations, are sometimes recognized with awards.

Model UN participants include students at middle school, high school, and college/university levels, with most conferences catering to just one of these three levels (high school and college conferences being most common).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mymun.net/muns/list |title=List of MUN Conferences by High School and College level |publisher=MyMUN.net |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delegates usually attend conferences together as delegations sent by their respective schools' or universities' Model UN clubs, though some delegates attend conferences independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestdelegate.com/independent-model-un-teams/|title=The Sudden Rise of Independent Model UN Teams: Homeschool, Community, and Private Travel Teams|work=Best Delegate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Model UN began as a series of student-led Model [[League of Nations]] simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.munplanet.com/articles/model-united-nations/toward-a-history-of-model-united-nations|title=Toward a History of Model United Nations|first=KOvacevic|last=Marko|work=MUNPlanet}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the first Model League of Nations conferences were held in the 1920s, before transitioning to Model UN after the formation of the League's successor organization, the [[United Nations]], in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unausa.org/global-classrooms-model-un/how-to-participate/getting-started/frequently-asked-questions#how_did|title=Frequently Asked Questions|first=Ross|last=Feldman|work=United Nations Association of the USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, some Model United Nations conferences include simulations of the League of Nations among their committee offerings.

The first Model United Nations was held at St. Lawrence University from 11–13 February 1949.&lt;ref&gt;"Ten Colleges Participate in Model Session of United Nations Held at S. L.U. Campus," ''Watertown Daily Times'', 14 February 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was initiated by Dr. Harry Reiff, Head of the History and Government Department, with the assistance of departmental colleague Otto L. George.&lt;ref&gt;"Ten Schools Form Synthetic UN Group," ''Hill News'', 3 February 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Reiff was a technical advisor on the [[United States]] delegation to the 1945 San Francisco Conference (where the UN Charter was written) and the UN Organizational Conference in [[London]] in 1945-46 (where the UN was established).&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in America'' (Chicago: A. N. Marquis) vol. 31, 1960, p. 2394.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1949 St. Lawrence University Model UN conference included delegates from regional conferences and universities, including Adelphi, Alfred, Champlain, Clarkson, McGill, Middlebury, Potsdam, St. Michael's, and Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;"To Conduct Model Security / Ten Colleges to Follow United Nations Procedure / Sessions Will Take Place on St. Lawrence Campus February 11–13," ''St. Lawrence Plaindealer'' [Canton, N.

In 1987, a few American exchange students founded TEIMUN in [[The Hague]]. In recent decades, Model UN has spread to East and South Asia, the Middle East, Europe, North Africa, and sub-Saharan Africa.

== Procedures ==
[[File:MUN-SH2005KielGermany.jpg|thumb|Delegates negotiating during an unmoderated caucus]]
In order to maintain [[Decorum#Social decorum|decorum]], most Model UN committees use parliamentary procedure derived from [[Robert's Rules of Order]]. However, most crisis committees forgo the formality of parliamentary procedure so as to ensure smoother operation. In addition, recently the United Nations has spearheaded efforts to introduce new Model UN rules of procedure that are more closely aligned with those used by the actual UN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestdelegate.com/un4mun-workshop-recap-4-big-differences-between-model-un-and-the-real-un/|title=UN4MUN Workshop Recap: 4 Big Differences Between Model UN and the Real UN|work=Best Delegate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/14/opinion/the-un-on-the-model-un.html?smid=pl-share&amp;_r=0|title=Letter: The U.N., on the Model U.N.|author=[[Maher Nasser]]|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/about/ropga/|title=UN General Assembly - Rules of Procedure|work=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MUN Rules"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unausa.org/global-classrooms-model-un/how-to-participate/model-un-preparation/rules-of-procedure |title=Rules of Procedure |publisher=United Nations Foundation |accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since there is no [[Board of governors|governing body]] for MUNs, each conference differs in the rules of procedure. The following rules of procedure apply to general MUNs but may not apply to every MUN:

MUNs are run by a group of [[Business administration|administrators]] known as the dais. A dais is headed by a [[Secretary-General]]. Each committee usually has a chair (also known as moderator), a member of the dais that enforces the rules of procedure. A [[delegate]] may request the committee as a whole to perform a particular action; this is known as a motion. Documents aiming to address the issue of the committee are known as resolutions and are voted for ratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unausa.org/global-classrooms-model-un/how-to-participate/getting-started/model-un-glossary |title=Model UN Glossary |publisher=United Nations Foundation |accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MUN committees can be divided into three general sessions: formal [[debate]], moderated [[caucus]], and unmoderated caucus. In a formal debate, the staff maintains a list of speakers and the delegates follow the order written on the 'speaker list'. Speakers may be added to the speaker list by raising their [[placard]]s or sending a note to the chair. During this time, delegates talk to the entire committee. They make [[speech]]es, answer questions, and debate on resolutions and amendments. If there are no other motions, the committee goes back to formal debate by default. There is usually a [[time limit]]. In a moderated caucus, the committee goes into a recess and the rules of procedure are suspended. Anyone may speak if recognized by the chair. A vote on a motion is necessary to go into a moderated caucus. There is a comparatively shorter time limit per speech. In an unmoderated caucus, the delegates informally meet with other delegates and the staff for discussions.&lt;ref name="MUN Rules" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MUN Manifesto"&gt;{{cite web |last =Shen |first=Sunny |author2=Ryan Bae |author3=Amanda Chen |author4=Geneva Nam |author5=Sarah Wang |author6=Marco Wong |author7=Lance Zhou  |title=The MUN Manifesto |publisher=Connect Global Youth Association |year=2012 |url=http://project-connect.ca/resources/MUNManifesto.pdf |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Resolution (law)|Resolution]]s are the basis of all debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.utk.edu/~modelun/resolutions.htm |title=What is a Resolution? |publisher=University of Tennessee |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are considered the final results of [[conversation]]s, [[writing]]s, and [[negotiation]]s. Resolutions must go through a [[Draft document|draft]], approval by the dais, and consequent debate and modification.&lt;ref name="Resolution"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unausa.org/global-classrooms-model-un/how-to-participate/model-un-preparation/resolutions |title=Resolutions |publisher=United Nations Foundation |accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic aspects ==
Participation in Model UN is meant to foster [[negotiation]], [[public speaking|speaking]] and [[communication skills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://socialsciences.uottawa.ca/international/opportunities/un-course|title=Model United Nations Course {{!}} Faculty of Social Sciences {{!}} University of Ottawa|website=socialsciences.uottawa.ca|language=en|access-date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, crisis committees, which deal with [[crisis]] [[scenario]]s which can be contemporary or historical, can develop leadership skills and the ability to adapt and deal with unexpected situations. Material issues of [[diplomacy]] and [[policy]] are also approached through a quasi-academic process. In preparation for a conference, topics are chosen for each committee, and typically, research and background guides (called Study Guides) are made available by the organizers of a conference for each committee. Delegates of each committee are often expected to pre-formulate the position of the country or group they represent, based on these background guides, and submit the result of this preparation to their committee as a so-called Position Paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unausa.org/global-classrooms-model-un/how-to-participate/model-un-preparation/position-papers|title=Position Papers|last=Feldman|first=Ross|newspaper=United Nations Association of the USA|access-date=20 February 2017|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this procedure is to familiarize delegates with the substantial topics of debate, encourage [[academic research]] and writing, and to enable substantial preparation for conferences.

While several guides on the techniques of writing Position Papers, including templates and examples, are available,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unitedambassadors.com/single-post/2016/05/02/How-to-Write-a-Great-Position-Paper-for-a-Model-United-Nations-Conference|title=United Ambassadors for Model United Nations|website=United Ambassadors for Model United Nations|access-date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aps.schoolwires.com/Page/12903|title=Model United Nations / Writing a Position Paper|website=aps.schoolwires.com|language=en|access-date=20 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221010038/http://aps.schoolwires.com/Page/12903|archive-date=21 February 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bestdelegate.com/a-formula-for-the-perfect-position-paper-solution-oriented-research/|title=A Formula for the Perfect Position Paper: Solution-Oriented Research|newspaper=Best Delegate|access-date=20 February 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; no conferences publish their Study Guides, Position Papers or Resolutions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} Currently, only one subscription-based Position Paper database is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mymun.net/position-paper-database|title=Position Paper Database|last=|first=|date=20 February 2017|website=MyMUN.net|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mun is not arguing the nature of a question, proving research facts, or standing up and defending a foreign policy agenda but providing solutions that every nation,  human and nature can endeavour and use to resolve crises and rise in the risk of uniting strength to maintain international peace and security. This is the difference between the parliament and the UN, distinguishing power struggle from diplomacy.

== Languages ==
[[File:Buenos Aires MINU UN Model - 2007-11-06 - 4.jpg|thumb|Placard for the [[United Kingdom]] in Spanish at the International Model United Nations of Buenos Aires (MINUBA) in [[Argentina]]]]
Traditionally, [[English language|English]] has been the official and working language of most conferences, but, as Model UN has become more popular around the world, and as conferences in countries such as the United States have sought to appeal to underrepresented minorities (such as the [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking community), committees using languages other than English, or which are [[multilingualism|bilingual]], have become common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unausa.org/global-classrooms-model-un/model-un-conferences/model-un-city-conferences/minnesota|title=Global Classrooms: Minnesota Model UN Conference|first=Ross|last=Feldman|work=United Nations Association of the USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted, however, that this is still not yet a mainstream phenomenon, especially not in the United States, where most bilingual or Spanish language committees are found at conferences hosted in [[Puerto Rico]] or the [[Southern United States|South]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestdelegate.com/model-united-nations-san-antonio-munsa-finds-success-through-community/|title=Model United Nations San Antonio (MUNSA) Finds Success Through Community|work=Best Delegate}}&lt;/ref&gt;, apart from Spain.

== Attire ==
Nearly all Model United Nations conferences require delegates to wear [[Informal attire|Western business attire]], as dressing professionally is an important way to show respect for the nation, organization, or individual one is representing, as well as for the rest of one's committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unausa.org/global-classrooms-model-un/how-to-participate/model-un-preparation/dressing-for-success|title=Dressing for Success|first=Ross|last=Feldman|work=United Nations Association of the USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Committees ==
While Model United Nations conferences regularly simulate the bodies of the United Nations, the [[European Union]], government [[Cabinet (government)|cabinets]], and regional bodies such as [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] as so-called Committees, as well as corporate [[Board of directors|boards]], [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] or so-called [[Press corps|Press Corps]], idiosyncrasies and fictional Committees also exist. An example for such a special committee that does not have a parallel in the actual [[United Nations]] which deals with a [[crisis]] is known as a 'Crisis Committee.'&lt;ref name="Crisis NYT"&gt;{{cite news |last=Parrin |first=Anjli |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/education/edlife/a-new-student-run-breed-crisis-oriented-and-fiercely-competitive.html?_r=0 |title=The Dog-Eat-Dog World of Model U.N. |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=2 August 2013 |accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this committee, a crisis is given to a team of students and the teams must come up with solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Montero |first=Nicole |url=http://fiusm.com/2013/11/22/model-united-nations-team-hopes-to-rank-first-among-the-country/ |title=Model United Nations Team Hopes to Rank First Among the Country |publisher=FIU Student Media |date=22 November 2013 |accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Crisis Committee traditionally focuses on a single historical event, but recently current and future events have been used as well. The event may be [[fiction]]al or [[non-fiction]]al.&lt;ref name="Crisis NYT" /&gt;

== Organization ==
Model United Nations conferences are usually organized by [[high school club]]s or [[college]] clubs.&lt;ref name="What MUN"&gt;{{cite web |last=Yossinger |first=Nili Sarit |url=http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/publication/2012/07/2012073142614.html#axzz2lSH4DnI0 |title=What is Model UN?

{{Main article|List of Model United Nations conferences}}
Although Model United Nations originated in the United States, MUN clubs and conferences are not isolated to that country. Rather, like the actual UN, Model UN is found in countries around the globe.&lt;ref name="bestdelegate.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestdelegate.com/model-un-conferences-database/|title=Model United Nations Conference Database: 2014-2015|work=bestdelegate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Model UN is decentralized and has grown autonomously around the world, there are significant differences in how MUN is done between regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestdelegate.com/a-tale-of-two-coasts-5-key-differences-between-west-coast-versus-east-coast-model-un/|title=A Tale of Two Coasts: 5 Key Differences Between West Coast versus East Coast Model UN|work=Best Delegate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===

MUN is relatively popular in Denmark, with conferences at both [[Gymnasium (school)|high-school]] and university level. It was first introduced in 2003,&lt;ref name=EGMUN&gt;{{cite web|title=Previous MUNs|url=http://egmun.org/previous-muns/|website=egmun.org|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has since spread with 3 major conferences at high-school level, with at least 400 participants at each conference,&lt;ref name=EGMUN /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome 2016|url=https://www.facebook.com/bigmunconference/photos/a.635001486565559.1073741825.354614017937642/1023540374378333/?type=3&amp;theater|website=Facebook.com|publisher=BIGMUN|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with BIGMUN being the largest conference in Scandinavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Menzer|first1=Joram Gregers|title=Tomorrow's problem solvers are ready|url=http://sn.dk/Rudersdal/Morgendagens-problemloesere-sidder-klar/artikel/556049|website=sn.dk|accessdate=29 February 2016|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spain ===
MUN has become popular in Spain at the beginning of this decade, hosting the largest number of Conferences in Madrid. One of them is the [https://compimun.com/ Complutense International Model of United Nations (COMPIMUN)], that will include for its third edition other international organisations such as the [[Asia Cooperation Dialogue]], or the [[September 11 attacks|9-11]], apart from the traditional UN related Committees.

=== The Netherlands ===

The largest MUN in the Netherlands is The Hague International Model United Nations (THIMUN) conference, which includes over 3500 participants coming from around 200 schools and 100 different countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thimun.org/9-features/2-thimun-conference|title=THIMUN Conference The Hague|publisher=THIMUN Foundation|accessdate=1 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006070307/http://www.thimun.org/9-features/2-thimun-conference|archivedate=6 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is not located near the United-Nations Headquarters in New-York, it is one of the pioneer Model United Nations conferences in the world, since it has been founded in 1968 and located in the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) world city of the Hague. A whole network of conferences is marked by its THIMUN affiliation, a label which basically describes the universality of the procedures that rule the conference and make it part of the UN recognized foundation. In 1995 the THIMUN Foundation was accredited as a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) associated with the United Nations Department of Public Information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thimun.org/index.php/youth-in-action|title=Youth In Action|publisher=THIMUN Foundation|accessdate=1 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208134107/http://www.thimun.org/index.php/youth-in-action|archive-date=8 December 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the THIMUN has established its own conferences' network throughout time: THIMUN Qatar, THIMUN Singapore, THIMUN Online MUN (O-MUN) and THIMUN Latin America conferences have been set up from 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thimun.org/index.php/about/thimun-history|title=THIMUN History|publisher=THIMUN Foundation|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second and third biggest MUN-conferences of the Netherlands are MUNISH (Model United Nations at the International School of the Hague and HMUN (Haarlem Model United Nations). There is also The European International Model UN TEIMUN which is founded in 1987 and is the oldest university Model UN in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teimun.org|title=The European International Model UN website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Turkey ===
{{Primary sources|date=May 2018}}

In Turkey, Model United Nations conferences are mostly held by non-profit university-clubs. [[Istanbul]] hosts more conferences than all Turkish other cities combined. Yeditepe Model United Nations Club, the oldest and one of the most popular clubs in Turkey, holds three different conferences, being, Yeditepe Model United Nations Training and Development [http://www.y-mun.org Conference], Justinianus Moot [http://www.justinianusmootcourts.org Courts], and Model United Nations Conference Istanbul (MUNIST)[http://munist2017.org]. Also, Koç University Model United Nations Conference (KUMUN)[http://kumun.ku.edu.tr], Kadir Has University Model United Nations Conference (HASMUN)[http://hasmun.org], alongside with the training conference of the Kadir Has University Model United Nations Training Conference (HASTRAIN), Izmir University of Economics Model United Nations Conference (ECOMUN)[https://web.archive.org/web/20170809233018/http://ecomun2017.org/], alongside with the training conference, İzmir University of Economics Training Conference (EcoTRAIN) are most qualified conferences in Turkey. These conferences simulate not only General Assembly committees, but also Joint Crisis Cabinets, Futuristic, Fictional and Historical timeline based committees.

=== United Kingdom ===

There are a very large number of Model United Nations conferences on both the University and Sixth Form level in the United Kingdom. Almost every university that has an MUN society holds a yearly conference, of varying size, with the largest and most prestigious being [[London International Model United Nations]] - so much so a features film was shot about it ([[Winning London]]), followed by [[CUIMUN]] hosted in Cambridge and [[OxiMUN]] in Oxford, however in recent years conferences such as [[YorkMUN]] and [[ScotMUN]] in Edinburgh have been gaining popularity amongst UK delegations. The UK MUN circuit is not particularly well integrated with the European circuit, with most UK delegations not crossing international borders to get to their conferences and international delegations to UK conferences outside of the big three a rarity, but recently European conferences have begun to recruit chairing staff quite heavily from the UK.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

But the concept of MUN became a popular one in [[Bangladesh]] from 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/education/2013/nov/16/creating-future|title=Creating the future |first= |last= |publisher= [[Dhaka Tribune]]|date=16 November 2013 |accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== China ====
Model United Nations first came to China in 1995, when the elite [[China Foreign Affairs University]] held the country's first collegiate Model United Nations conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?filename=WJXY503.015&amp;DBName=cjfqtotal&amp;dbcode=cjfq|title = 记外交学院首届模拟联合国活动 - China Academic Journals Full-text Database|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/special/2013-04/25/c_132339467.htm |title=Intro to CFAU-MUNA - Xinhua &amp;#124; English.news.cn |website=News.xinhuanet.com |date=25 April 2013 |accessdate=22 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509164033/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/special/2013-04/25/c_132339467.htm |archive-date=9 May 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://zqb.cyol.com/html/2012-04/21/nw.D110000zgqnb_20120421_4-04.htm|title = 外交学院举办"2012北京模拟联合国大会"|date = |accessdate =22 January 2016 |website =Zqb.cyol.com |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arriving in Chinese high schools in 2005, Model UN expanded rapidly. [[Peking University|Peking University (PKU)]] students, after attending [[Harvard College|Harvard]]'s [[Harvard Model United Nations|HMUN]], organized the first national Model UN conference for high school students in China. PKU's conference was initially backed by [[United Nations Association of the United States of America|UNA-USA]], however support was curtailed in 2010 due to the [[Great Recession]].

Between 2005 and 2010, national Model United Nations conferencess such as those organized by PKU and the rivaling Fudan University in Shanghai drew the best high school students from around the country, who competed for limited spaces. Over time, lesser-known national conferences, as well as regional and even local conferences for high school students, began to develop and gradually spread to cities beyond [[Beijing]] and [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/04/romance-money-intrigue-its-model-un-in-china/275308/2/|title=Romance! Money! Intrigue! It's Model UN ... in China|first=Wendy|last=Qian|date=25 April 2013|work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the realm of interscholastic Model United Nations conferencess in China, the widely acknowledged{{According to whom|date=May 2018}} top 3 conferences are called "the ABC": [[Asian International Model United Nations]] held by [[Peking University]]; [http://www.bimun.org.cn/en/ Beijing International Model United Nations] held by [[China Foreign Affairs University]], and [[China National Model United Nations]], held by [[United Nations Association of China]], hosted in different cities annually. Another famous conference is the Annual NEOMUN conference, also known as SCAMUN by internal members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=模拟联合国(MUN)简介|url=http://www.unachina.org/upload/Attach/default/272497.doc|publisher=U.N.

Most Model United Nations conferences in China are organized through private or academic enterprises, however some government-affiliated MUNs have also flourished, and recently, unofficial student-run grassroots conferences have begun to dominate the Chinese MUN scene.&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt;

==== Tunisia ====

Conferences in Tunisia are mostly found in [[Tunis]] and they are usually sponsored by the Tunisian International Model United Nations (TIMUN&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timun.tn/|title=Tunisian International Model United Nations|last=|first=|date=|website=www.timun.tn/|accessdate=2012-08-01|ref=TIMUN}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The most famous conference in Tunisia is the "Grande Simulation annuelle du TIMUN" in Tunis, which host more than 300 delegates. These conferences are usually hosted by the biggest national universities. Since the 6th edition, the "Grande Simulation annuelle" is under the patronage of the Tunisian Minister of Foreign Affairs and welcomes Tunisian ministers and diplomats.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==== Other countries ====
The other conferences in Africa include NIAMUN&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naimun.org|title=North Africa International Model United Nations|last=|first=|date=|website=www.naimun.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616110200/http://naimun.org/|archive-date=2015-06-16|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2012-08-01|ref=NAIMUN}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Marrakech]]. Established in August 2012 by a coalition of North African youths, NAIMUN is the largest student-run Model United Nations conference in Africa and the Middle East, with 4 sub-branches in Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Egypt. It trains and encourages young people to address pressing global issues and engages them in resolving global problems. NAIMUN is a non-profit organization which provides an equal opportunity for all youth to actively participate in an open debate. JoMUN&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Johannesburg Model United Nations|url=https://mymun.net/muns/jomun-2015|website=JoMUN on MyMUN.net|accessdate=1 June 2015|ref=naimun}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Johannesburg]], and the recently founded IMIRAMUN&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Mirabilis Model United Nations|url=https://mymun.net/muns/imiramun-2015|website=IMIRAMUN on MyMUN.net|accessdate=1 June 2015|ref=naimun}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Windhoek]] took place in Benin, in Cotonou.

Over 5 days, approximately 500 high school and college students from different Brazilian cities discuss issues of great international relevance by performing the role as Heads of State and Government, Ministers and Diplomats.&lt;br /&gt;
The organization of FAMUN follows the orientation of the [https://outreach.un.org/mun/ ''UN4MUN''] approach: developed by the United Nations Department of Public Information, the approach proposes to bring MUNs’ practice closer to the real procedures of the United Nations. The result is a focus on debate that captures the spirit of cooperation and the process of reaching consensus.&lt;ref&gt;FAMUN 2016.

{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
[[File:Peruvian Universities.jpg|thumb|[[Peruvian Universities Debate Team|Peruvian Universities]], Best Large Delegation at WorldMUN 2014.]]
At university level, Model United Nations started in Peru in 2006 with the United Nations Studies Circle (CENU), a college team from the [[University of Lima]] founded to compete at [[Harvard National Model United Nations]]. This team would evolution into a full-scale organization, the Peruvian Association for the Study of the United Nations (AENU Peru for its Spanish acronym), a non-for-profit NGO charged with task of promoting MUN in Peru and creating Peru's first "National Delegation", using past experience to select the finest delegates from Peru's finest universities, thus creating the [[Peruvian Universities Debate Team]] (PU). Starting their new trademark since 2011, PU's has garnered the Best Large Delegation award at [[Harvard World Model United Nations]] 2014 held in Brussels, Belgium, and the Best Large Delegation award at [[Harvard International Relations Council|Harvard National Model United Nations - Latin America]] 2017, held in Lima, Peru.
[[File:PDS.jpg|thumb|[[Peruvian Debate Society]], Best Large Delegation at WorldMUN 2018.]]
In 2014, [[Peruvian Debate Society]] was founded by experienced MUN delegates as a new alternative towards competing in [[Harvard International Relations Council]] conferences. Starting their full-scale performance in 2015, PDS's has achieved the Best Large Delegation award at [[Harvard International Relations Council|Harvard National Model United Nations - Latin America]] in three editions out of four participations. Recently, the team became the second Peruvian delegation to win the Best Large Delegation award at [[Harvard World Model United Nations]] 2018, held in Panama City, Panama.

At high school level, MUN has been a popular extracurricular activity since 2012, with the first high school conference Lima Model United Nations (LiMUN) 2012, followed by Villa Maria Model United Nations (VMMUN) 2015, Newton Model United Nations (NewMUN) 2015, and Carmelitas Model United Nations 2015, being the latter school the host for the first Ivy League Model United Nations Conference Peru (ILMUNC 2016). Each school delegation hosts its own conference, transcending from the capital city of Lima to Cusco, Arequipa and Piura. 

In 2015, the [[Promotora International de Debates - Perú]] (PRIDE Peru) was founded as an NGO towards the projection of creating the first Inter-school Delegation, United Schools of Peru, in order to compete internationally. The team has garnered twice the Best International Delegation award at the Ivy League Model United Nations Conference (2016 &amp; 2018), and at the WFUNA International Model United Nations (WIMUN 2017 &amp; 2018).

'''{{lang|fr|Médecins Sans Frontières}}''' ('''MSF'''; pronounced {{IPA-fr|medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ||Fr-Médecins Sans Frontières.oga}}), also known in English as '''Doctors Without Borders''', is an international [[Humanitarian aid|humanitarian]] medical [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organisation]] (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in [[developing country|countries]] affected by [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic diseases]]. In 2015, over 30,000 personnel—mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators—provided medical aid in over 70 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Our staff |url=http://www.msf.org/our-staff |accessdate=2 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519013601/http://www.msf.org/our-staff |archive-date=19 May 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of staff are volunteers. Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msf.org/sites/msf.org/files/msf-international-financial-report-2016.pdf|title=MSF International Financial Report 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=March 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- page 89: Total programme expenses listed as 669.1 million Euros, converted to US dollars gives 755 million --&gt;

{{lang|fr|Médecins Sans Frontières}} was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the [[Nigerian Civil War|Biafra secession]], by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to [[medical care]] across national boundaries and irrespective of [[Race (classification of humans)|race]], [[religion]], creed or political affiliation.&lt;ref name=creation&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msf.fr/histoire-sommaire-book-page/1971-creation-medecins-sans-frontieres |title=La création de Médecins Sans Frontières |id=La création de Médecins Sans Frontières |publisher=Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without borders) |accessdate=14 September 2011 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; To that end, the organisation emphasises "independence and impartiality", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisation. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the [[Rwandan Genocide|1994 genocide in Rwanda]], has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,&lt;ref&gt;MSF Article [http://www.msf.org.uk/about_charter.aspx MSF's Charter – ABOUT MSF  – MSF UK] '''MSF'''. Retrieved 31 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;MSF Article [http://www.msf.dk/OmMSF/Hvemervi/LaMancha-aftalen/ La Mancha Agreement] '''MSF'''. Retrieved 31 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres ([[Amsterdam]], [[Barcelona]]-[[Athens]], [[Brussels]], [[Geneva]] and [[Paris]]). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has [[List of organizations with consultative status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council|general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council]]. It received the 1999 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/publications/reports/2006/top10_2005.html MSF-USA: Special Report: The 10 Most Underreported Humanitarian Crises of 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228162119/http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/publications/reports/2006/top10_2005.html |date=28 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Orbinski]], who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF.

MSF should not be confused with [[Médecins du Monde]] (Doctors of the World), which was formed in part by members of the former organisation, but is an entirely independent non-governmental organisation with no links to MSF today.

==Origin==

===Biafra===
[[File:Starved girl.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A child with [[kwashiorkor]] during the [[Nigerian Civil War]]]]

During the [[Nigerian Civil War]] of 1967 to 1970, the Nigerian military formed a [[blockade]] around the nation's newly [[secession|independent]] south-eastern region, [[Biafra]]. At this time, France was the only major country supportive of the Biafrans (the United Kingdom, the [[Soviet Union]] and the United States sided with the Nigerian government), and the conditions within the blockade were unknown to the world. A number of French doctors volunteered with the French [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] to work in hospitals and feeding centres in besieged Biafra.&lt;ref name=creation/&gt; One of the co-founders of the organisation was [[Bernard Kouchner]], who later became a high-ranking French politician.

After entering the country, the volunteers, in addition to Biafran health workers and hospitals, were subjected to attacks by the [[Nigerian Armed Forces|Nigerian army]], and witnessed civilians being murdered and starved by the blockading forces. The doctors publicly criticised the Nigerian government and the Red Cross for their seemingly complicit behaviour. These doctors concluded that a new aid organisation was needed that would ignore political/religious boundaries and prioritise the welfare of victims.&lt;ref name=creation/&gt;

===1971 establishment===
The ''Groupe d'Intervention Médicale et Chirurgicale en Urgence'' ("Emergency Medical and Surgical Intervention Group") was formed in 1971 by French doctors who had worked in Biafra, to provide aid and to emphasize the importance of victims' rights over neutrality. At the same time, [[Raymond Borel]], the editor of the French [[medical journal]] ''TONUS'', had started a group called ''Secours Médical Français'' ("French Medical Relief") in response to the [[1970 Bhola cyclone]], which killed at least 625,000 in [[East Pakistan]] (now Bangladesh). Borel had intended to recruit doctors to provide aid to victims of natural disasters. On 22 December 1971, the two groups of colleagues merged to form ''Médecins Sans Frontières''.&lt;ref name="hih"/&gt;

MSF’s first mission was to the Nicaraguan capital, [[Managua]], where a [[1972 Nicaragua earthquake|1972 earthquake]] had destroyed most of the city and killed between 10,000 and 30,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Bortolotti, above, puts the death toll at 10,000. An estimate of 15,000 to 30,000, warning of an inevitable dysentery epidemic, comes from: {{Cite journal |author=Camilo, V |year=1974 |title=The Earthquake in Managua |url= |journal=The Lancet |volume=303 |issue=7845 |pages=25–26 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(74)93014-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization, today known for its quick response in an emergency, arrived three days after the Red Cross had set up a relief mission. On 18 and 19 September 1974, [[Hurricane Fifi]] caused major flooding in Honduras and killed thousands of people (estimates vary), and MSF set up its first long-term medical relief mission.&lt;ref&gt;MSF Article [http://www.medecinssansfrontieres.com/site/site.nsf/pages/70 Chronologies: Années 70 (French)] '''MSF-France'''. Retrieved 10 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1975 and 1979, after [[South Vietnam]] had fallen to [[North Vietnam]], millions of Cambodians emigrated to Thailand to avoid the [[Khmer Rouge]]. In response MSF set up its first [[refugee camp]] missions in Thailand.&lt;ref name="hih"/&gt; When Vietnam withdrew from Cambodia in 1989, MSF started long-term relief missions to help survivors of [[The Killing Fields|the mass killings]] and reconstruct the country’s health care system.&lt;ref&gt;MSF Article (1999) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&amp;objectid=751B6EAC-B3D6-11D4-B1FA0060084A6370&amp;method=full_html Cambodia's second chance] '''MSF'''. Retrieved 10 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Although its missions to Thailand to help victims of war in Southeast Asia could arguably be seen as its first war-time mission, MSF saw its first mission to a true war zone, including exposure to hostile fire, in 1976. MSF spent nine years (1976–1984) assisting surgeries in the hospitals of various cities in Lebanon, during the [[Lebanese Civil War]], and established a reputation for its neutrality and willingness to work under fire. Throughout the war, MSF helped both [[Lebanese Civil War#Christian militias|Christian]] and [[Lebanese Civil War#Shi'a militias|Muslim soldiers]] alike, helping whichever group required the most medical aid at the time. In 1984, as the situation in Lebanon deteriorated further and security for aid groups was minimised, MSF withdrew its volunteers.

==New leadership==
[[Claude Malhuret]] was elected as the new president of Medicins Sans Frontieres in 1977, and soon after debates began over the future of the organisation. In particular, the concept of ''témoignage'' ("witnessing"), which refers to speaking out about the suffering that one sees as opposed to remaining silent,&lt;ref&gt;MSF Article (2005) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?objectid=F75AB4F5-E018-0C72-093A3A517D56EB33&amp;component=toolkit.article&amp;method=full_html MSF's principles and identity – The challenges ahead] '''MSF'''. Retrieved 10 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; was being opposed or played down by Malhuret and his supporters. Malhuret thought MSF should avoid criticism of the governments of countries in which they were working, while Kouchner believed that documenting and broadcasting the suffering in a country was the most effective way to solve a problem.

In 1979, after four years of refugee movement from South Vietnam and the surrounding countries by foot and [[Vietnamese boat people|by boat]], French intellectuals made an appeal in ''[[Le Monde]]'' for "A Boat for Vietnam", a project intended to provide medical aid to the refugees. Although the project did not receive support from the majority of MSF, some, including later Minister [[Bernard Kouchner]], chartered a ship called ''L’Île de Lumière'' ("The Island of Light"), and, along with doctors, journalists and photographers, sailed to the [[South China Sea]] and provided some medical aid to the boat people. The splinter organisation that undertook this, [[Médecins du Monde]], later developed the idea of [[humanitarian intervention]] as a duty, in particular on the part of Western nations such as France.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Seymour, ''The Liberal Defense of Murder'' (London 2008), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 MSF clarified that for nearly 30 years MSF and Kouchner have had public disagreements on such issues as the right to intervene and the use of armed force for humanitarian reasons. Kouchner is in favour of the latter, whereas MSF stands up for an impartial humanitarian action, independent from all political, economic and religious powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/press/release.cfm?id=2053 |title=Dr. Bernard Kouchner and MSF: A Clarification, 22 May 2007 |publisher=Doctorswithoutborders.org |date= |accessdate=3 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927220144/http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/press/release.cfm?id=2053 |archive-date=27 September 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MSF development===
In 1982, Malhuret and [[Rony Brauman]] (who became the organisation's president in 1982) brought increased financial independence to MSF by introducing fundraising-by-mail to better collect donations. The 1980s also saw the establishment of the other operational sections from MSF-France (1971): MSF-Belgium (1980), MSF-Switzerland (1981), MSF-Holland (1984), and MSF-Spain (1986). MSF-Luxembourg was the first support section, created in 1986. The early 1990s saw the establishment of the majority of the support sections: MSF-Greece (1990), MSF-USA (1990), MSF-Canada (1991), MSF-Japan (1992), MSF-UK (1993), MSF-Italy (1993), MSF-Australia (1994), as well as Germany, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Hong Kong (MSF-UAE was formed later).&lt;ref name="hih"/&gt;&lt;ref name="various"&gt;Information obtained from the various sections' websites.&lt;/ref&gt; Malhuret and Brauman were instrumental in professionalising MSF. In December 1979, after the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet army had invaded Afghanistan]], field missions were immediately set up to provide medical aid to the [[mujahideen]], and in February 1980, MSF publicly denounced the [[Khmer Rouge]]. During the [[1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia]], MSF set up nutrition programmes in the country in 1984, but was expelled in 1985 after denouncing the abuse of international aid and the forced resettlements. MSF's explicit attacks on the Ethiopian government led to other NGOs criticizing their abandonment of their supposed neutrality and contributed to a series of debates in France around humanitarian ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/5/1/6/6/pages251669/p251669-1.php Denis Kennedy, "Humanitarian NGOs and the Norm of Neutrality: A Community Approach"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davey |first=Eleanor |title=Famine, aid, and ideology: the political activism of Médecins sans frontières in the 1980s |journal=French Historical Studies |year=2011 |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=529–58 |doi=10.1215/00161071-1259157}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group also set up equipment to produce clean [[drinking water]] for the population of [[San Salvador]], capital of El Salvador, after 10 October 1986 earthquake that struck the city.&lt;ref name="hih"/&gt;&lt;ref name="frchrono80"&gt;MSF Article [http://www.medecinssansfrontieres.com/site/site.nsf/pages/80 Chronologie: Années 80 (French)] '''MSF-France'''.

===Early 1990s===
The early 1990s saw MSF open a number of new national sections, and at the same time, set up field missions in some of the most dangerous and distressing situations it had ever encountered.

In 1990, MSF first entered Liberia to help civilians and refugees affected by the [[First Liberian Civil War|Liberian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;MSF Article [http://www.medecinssansfrontieres.com/association/annees90courte Chronologie: Années 90 (French)] '''MSF-France'''.

MSF first began work in [[Srebrenica]] (in Bosnia and Herzegovina) as part of a UN convoy in 1993, one year after the [[Bosnian War]] had begun. The city had become surrounded by the [[Bosnian Serb Army]] and, containing about 60,000 [[Bosniaks]], had become an enclave guarded by a [[United Nations Protection Force]]. MSF was the only organisation providing medical care to the surrounded civilians, and as such, did not denounce the genocide for fear of being expelled from the country (it did, however, denounce the lack of access for other organisations). MSF was forced to leave the area in 1995 when the [[Bosnian Serb Army]] captured the town. 40,000 [[Bosnian Muslims|Bosniak]] civilian inhabitants were deported, and approximately 7,000 were killed in mass executions.&lt;ref&gt;MSF Article (2000) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&amp;objectid=751B6F1E-B3D6-11D4-B1FA0060084A6370&amp;method=full_html Srebrenica five years on] '''MSF'''.

===Rwanda===
When the [[genocide in Rwanda]] began in April 1994, some delegates of MSF working in the country were incorporated into the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) medical team for protection. Both groups succeeded in keeping all main hospitals in Rwanda's capital [[Kigali]] operational throughout the main period of the genocide. MSF, together with several other aid organisations, had to leave the country in 1995, although many MSF and ICRC volunteers worked together under the ICRC's rules of engagement, which held that neutrality was of the utmost importance. These events led to a debate within the organisation about the concept of balancing neutrality of humanitarian aid workers against their witnessing role. As a result of its Rwanda mission, the position of MSF with respect to neutrality moved closer to that of the ICRC, a remarkable development in the light of the origin of the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Forsythe DP (2005).

The ICRC lost 56 and MSF lost almost one hundred of their respective local staff in Rwanda, and MSF-France, which had chosen to evacuate its team from the country (the local staff were forced to stay), denounced the murders and demanded that a [[Military of France|French military]] intervention stop the genocide. MSF-France introduced the slogan ''"One cannot stop a genocide with doctors"'' to the media, and the controversial [[Opération Turquoise]] followed less than one month later.&lt;ref name="hih"/&gt; This intervention directly or indirectly resulted in movements of hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees to [[Zaire]] and Tanzania in what became known as the [[Great Lakes refugee crisis]], and subsequent cholera epidemics, starvation and more mass killings in the large groups of civilians.

The Greek MSF section had gained access to Serbia at the cost of accepting Serb government imposed limits on where it could go and what it could see – terms that the rest of the MSF movement had refused.&lt;ref&gt;Urbinski, James.

MSF has been active in Uganda since 1980, and provided relief to civilians during the country’s guerrilla war during the [[Uganda since 1979#The Second Obote Period: 1981-1985|Second Obote Period]]. However, the formation of the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] saw the beginning of a long campaign of violence in northern Uganda and southern Sudan. Civilians were subjected to mass killings and rapes, torture, and abductions of children, who would later serve as sex slaves or [[child soldier]]s. Faced with more than 1.5&amp;nbsp;million people displaced from their homes, MSF set up relief programmes in [[internally displaced person]] (IDP) camps to provide clean water, food and sanitation. Diseases such as [[tuberculosis]], measles, polio, cholera, [[ebola]], and HIV/AIDS occur in epidemics in the country, and volunteers provide vaccinations (in the cases of measles and polio) and/or treatment to the residents.

MSF first provided medical help to civilians and refugees who have escaped to camps along the Thai-Cambodian border in 1979. Due to long decades of war, a proper [[health care]] system in the country was severely lacking and MSF moved inland in 1989 to help restructure basic medical facilities.

In 1999, Cambodia was hit with a malaria epidemic. The situation of the epidemic was aggravated by a lack of qualified practitioners and poor quality control which led to a market of fake antimalarial drugs. Counterfeit antimalarial drugs were responsible for the deaths of at least 30 people during the epidemic.&lt;ref name="cdcarticle"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/malaria_worldwide/reduction/counterfeit.html CDC Article (2010) Counterfeit and Substandard Antimalarial Drugs.

Cambodia is one of 22 countries listed by WHO as having a high burden of tuberculosis. WHO estimates that 64% of all Cambodians carry the tuberculosis mycobacterium.

===Libya===
The [[2011 Libyan civil war]] has prompted efforts by MSF to set up a hospital and mental health services to help locals affected by the conflict. The fighting created a backlog of patients that needed surgery. With parts of the country slowly returning to livable, MSF has started working with local health personnel to address the needs. The need for psychological counseling has increased and MSF has set up mental health services to address the fears and stress of people living in tents without water and electricity. Currently MSF is the only International Aid organisation with actual presence in the country.

===Mediterranean Sea===
MSF is providing Maritime Search And Rescue (SAR) services on the Mediterranean Sea to save the lives of migrants attempting to cross with unseaworthy boats. The Mission started in 2015 after the EU ended its major SAR operation [[Operation Mare Nostrum|Mare Nostrum]] severely diminishing much needed SAR capacities in the Mediterranean&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/country-region/mediterranean-sea |title=Archived copy |access-date=17 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180218090835/http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/country-region/mediterranean-sea |archive-date=18 February 2018 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Throughout the mission MSF has operated its own vessels like the Bourbon Argos (2015–2016), Dignity I (2015–2016) and Prudence (2016–2017). MSF has also provided medical teams to support other NGOs and their ships like the [[Migrant Offshore Aid Station|MOAS]] Phoenix (2015) or the Aquarius with SOS Méditerranée (2017–2018) &lt;ref&gt;http://searchandrescue.msf.org/&lt;/ref&gt;.

As of January 2018 only the MSF team on board the Aquarius remains active, since 2015 MSF has assisted a total of 75,089 people at sea.

===Sri Lanka===
MSF is involved in Sri Lanka, where a [[Sri Lankan Civil War|26 year civil war]] ended in 2009 and MSF has adapted its activities there to continue its mission. For example, it helps with physical therapy for patients with spinal cord injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Armstrong |first1=JC |last2=Nichols |first2=BE |last3=Wilson |first3=JM |last4=Cosico |first4=RA |last5=Shanks |first5=L |title=Spinal cord injury in the emergency context: review of program outcomes of a spinal cord injury rehabilitation program in Sri Lanka. |journal=Conflict and Health |date=20 March 2014 |volume=8 |issue=1 |page=4 |pmid=24650231 |doi=10.1186/1752-1505-8-4 |pmc=3994551}}&lt;/ref&gt; It conducts counseling sessions, and has set up an “operating theatre for reconstructive orthopaedic surgery and supplied specialist surgeons, anaesthetists and nurses to operate on patients with complicated war-related injuries.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://doctorswithoutborders.org/publications/ar/report.cfm?id=5320 |title=International Activity Report 2010 |access-date=2 October 2011 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130414175526/http://doctorswithoutborders.org/publications/ar/report.cfm?id=5320 |archive-date=14 April 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yemen===
{{Seealso|Airstrikes on hospitals in Yemen}}
MSF is involved in trying to help with the humanitarian crisis caused by the [[Yemeni Civil War (2015–present)|Yemeni Civil War]]. The organisation operates eleven hospital and health centres in Yemen and provides support to another 18 hospitals or health centres.&lt;ref name="msf.org.uk"&gt;https://www.msf.org.uk/article/yemen-staff-and-patients-killed-after-airstrike-hits-abs-hospital&lt;/ref&gt; According to MSF, since October 2015, four of its hospitals and one ambulance have been destroyed by Saudi-led coalition airstrikes.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.msf.org.uk/country/yemen&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, an airstrike on Abs hospital killed 19 people, including one MSF staff member, and wounded 24.&lt;ref name="msf.org.uk"/&gt; According to MSF, the GPS coordinates of the hospital were repeatedly shared with all parties to the conflict, including the Saudi-led coalition, and its location was well-known.

==Field mission structure==
Before a field mission is established in a country, an MSF team visits the area to determine the nature of the humanitarian emergency, the level of safety in the area and what type of aid is needed (this is called an "exploratory mission").

Medical aid is the main objective of most missions, although some missions help in such areas as [[water purification]] and nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/aboutus/what.cfm Field Operations: What Do We Do?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316011210/http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/aboutus/what.cfm |date=16 March 2006 }} '''MSF'''.

===Field mission team===
[[File:MSF logistician showing plans.jpg|thumb|MSF logistician in [[Nigeria]] showing plans]]

A field mission team usually consists of a small number of coordinators to head each component of a field mission, and a "head of mission." The head of mission usually has the most experience in humanitarian situations of the members of the team, and it is his/her job to deal with the media, national governments and other humanitarian organizations. The head of mission does not necessarily have a medical background.

Medical volunteers include physicians, surgeons, nurses, and various other specialists. In addition to operating the medical and nutrition components of the field mission, these volunteers are sometimes in charge of a group of local medical staff and provide training for them.

Although the medical volunteers almost always receive the most media attention when the world becomes aware of an MSF field mission, there are a number of non-medical volunteers who help keep the field mission functioning. Logisticians are responsible for providing everything that the medical component of a mission needs, ranging from security and vehicle maintenance to food and electricity supplies. They may be engineers and/or [[Construction foreman|foremen]], but they usually also help with setting up treatment centres and supervising local staff. Other non-medical staff are water/sanitation specialists, who are usually experienced engineers in the fields of water treatment and management and financial/administration/human resources experts who are placed with field missions.

Vaccination campaigns are a major part of the medical care provided during MSF missions. Diseases such as [[diphtheria]], [[measles]], [[meningitis]], [[tetanus]], [[pertussis]], [[yellow fever]], [[polio]], and [[cholera]], all of which are uncommon in developed countries, may be prevented with [[vaccination]]. Some of these diseases, such as cholera and measles, spread rapidly in large populations living in close proximity, such as in a refugee camp, and people must be immunised by the hundreds or thousands in a short period of time.&lt;ref&gt;MSF Article (2003) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&amp;objectid=2371723C-A340-45A4-919DDF2685CD9289&amp;method=full_html The Vaccine Gap: NY Times editorial] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015853/http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&amp;objectid=2371723C-A340-45A4-919DDF2685CD9289&amp;method=full_html |date=30 September 2007 }} '''MSF'''.

Since most of the areas that require field missions have been affected by a natural disaster, civil war, or endemic disease, the residents usually require psychological support as well.

===Nutrition===
Often in situations where an MSF mission is set up, there is moderate or severe [[malnutrition]] as a result of war, drought, or government economic mismanagement. Intentional starvation is also sometimes used during a war as a weapon, and MSF, in addition to providing food, brings awareness to the situation and insists on foreign government intervention. Infectious diseases and [[diarrhoea]], both of which cause weight loss and weakening of a person's body (especially in children), must be treated with medication and proper nutrition to prevent further infections and weight loss. A combination of the above situations, as when a civil war is fought during times of drought and infectious disease outbreaks, can create famine.&lt;ref&gt;MSF Article (2000) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&amp;objectid=71282930-EC70-11D4-B2010060084A6370&amp;method=full_html Preventing malnutrition and famine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222723/http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&amp;objectid=71282930-EC70-11D4-B2010060084A6370&amp;method=full_html |date=27 September 2007 }} '''MSF'''.

[[File:An MSF health worker examines a malnourished child.jpg|thumb|An MSF health worker examines a malnourished child in [[Ethiopia]], July 2011]]
In emergency situations where there is a lack of nutritious food, but not to the level of a true famine, [[protein-energy malnutrition]] is most common among young children. [[Marasmus]], a form of calorie deficiency, is the most common form of childhood malnutrition and is characterised by severe wasting and often fatal weakening of the immune system. [[Kwashiorkor]], a form of calorie and protein deficiency, is a more serious type of malnutrition in young children, and can negatively affect [[Human development (biology)|physical]] and [[Developmental psychology|mental development]]. Both types of malnutrition can make opportunistic infections fatal.&lt;ref&gt;MSF Article (2001) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&amp;objectid=CB803D87-94DC-423E-98E2485EAAAC0873&amp;method=full_html Malnutrition definition and MSF treatment] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222348/http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&amp;objectid=CB803D87-94DC-423E-98E2485EAAAC0873&amp;method=full_html |date=27 September 2007 }} '''MSF'''. Retrieved 28 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In these situations, MSF sets up ''Therapeutic Feeding Centres'' for monitoring the children and any other malnourished individuals.

A Therapeutic Feeding Centre (or Therapeutic Feeding Programme) is designed to treat severe malnutrition through the gradual introduction of a special diet intended to promote weight gain after the individual has been treated for other health problems. The treatment programme is split between two phases:&lt;ref&gt;MSF Article (2001) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&amp;objectid=38EE4ACD-E76C-419D-8888955E03EF9E13&amp;method=full_html MSF Therapeutic Feeding Programmes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015539/http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&amp;objectid=38EE4ACD-E76C-419D-8888955E03EF9E13&amp;method=full_html |date=30 September 2007 }} '''MSF'''. Retrieved 28 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Phase 1 lasts for 24 hours and involves basic health care and several small meals of low energy/protein food spaced over the day.
* Phase 2 involves monitoring of the patient and several small meals of high energy/protein food spaced over each day until the individual’s weight approaches normal.

MSF uses foods designed specifically for treatment of severe malnutrition. During phase 1, a type of therapeutic milk called [[F-75 (food)|F-75]] is fed to patients. F-75 is a relatively low energy, low fat/protein milk powder that must be mixed with water and given to patients to prepare their bodies for phase 2.&lt;ref&gt;Drugs and Medical Supplies Catalogue Vol. 1 (2005) F-75 Description '''MSF'''.&lt;/ref&gt; During phase 2, therapeutic milk called [[F-100 (food)|F-100]], which is higher in energy/fat/protein content than F-75, is given to patients, usually along with a peanut butter mixture called [[Plumpy'nut]]. F-100 and Plumpy'nut are designed to quickly provide large amounts of nutrients so that patients can be treated efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Drugs and Medical Supplies Catalogue Vol. 1 (2005) F-100 Description '''MSF'''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drugs and Medical Supplies Catalogue Vol. 1 (2005) Plumpy'nut Description '''MSF'''.&lt;/ref&gt; Other special food fed to populations in danger of starvation includes [[enriched flour]] and [[porridge]], as well as a high protein biscuit called [[BP-5 Compact Food|BP5]]. BP5 is a popular food for treating populations because it can be distributed easily and sent home with individuals, or it can be crushed and mixed with therapeutic milk for specific treatments.&lt;ref&gt;Drugs and Medical Supplies Catalogue Vol. 1 (2005) BP5 Description '''MSF'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dehydration]], sometimes due to [[diarrhoea]] or cholera, may also be present in a population, and MSF set up rehydration centres to combat this. A special solution called [[Oral rehydration salt|Oral Rehydration Solution]] (ORS), which contains [[Glucose#Function|glucose]] and [[Cell electrolyte|electrolytes]], is given to patients to [[Fluid replacement|replace fluids lost]].

==Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines==
{{Main|Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines}}

The Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines was initiated in 1999 to increase access to [[essential medicines]] in developing countries. "Essential medicines" are those drugs that are needed in sufficient supply to treat a disease common to a population.&lt;ref&gt;WHO Health topic [http://www.who.int/topics/essential_medicines/en/ Essential Medicines]&lt;/ref&gt; However, most diseases common to populations in developing countries are no longer common to populations in developed countries; therefore, [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]] find that producing these drugs is no longer profitable and may raise the price per treatment, decrease development of the drug (and new treatments) or even stop production of the drug. MSF often lacks effective drugs during field missions, and started the campaign to put pressure on governments and pharmaceutical companies to increase funding for essential medicines.

In recent years, the organization has tried to use its influence to urge the drug maker [[Novartis]] to drop its case against India’s patent law that prevents Novartis from patenting its drugs in [[India]]. A few years earlier, Novartis also sued [[South Africa]] to prevent it from importing cheaper [[AIDS]] drugs. Dr. Tido von Schoen-Angerer, director of DWB's Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines, says, "Just like five years ago, Novartis, with its legal actions, is trying to stand in the way of people's right to access the medicines they need."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web1.doctorswithoutborders.org/press/release.cfm?id=1908&amp;cat=press-release |title=MSF Urges Novartis to Drop Case Against Indian Government &amp;#124; Doctors Without Borders |publisher=Web1.doctorswithoutborders.org |date=20 December 2006 |accessdate=3 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404055800/http://web1.doctorswithoutborders.org/press/release.cfm?id=1908&amp;cat=press-release |archive-date=4 April 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April 2013, it was announced that the Indian court invalidated Novartis's patent on Gleevec. This decision makes the drug available via generics on the Indian market at a considerably lower price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/01/us-india-novartis-patent-idUSBRE93002I20130401 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=1 April 2013 |title=Novartis loses landmark India cancer drug patent case |date=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dangers faced by volunteers==
Aside from injuries and death associated with stray bullets, mines and epidemic disease, MSF volunteers are sometimes attacked or kidnapped for political reasons. In some countries afflicted by civil war, humanitarian-aid organizations are viewed as helping the enemy. If an aid mission is perceived to be exclusively set up for victims on one side of the conflict, it may come under attack for that reason. However, the [[War on Terrorism]] has generated attitudes among some groups in US-occupied countries that non-governmental aid organizations such as MSF are allied with or even work for the [[Multinational force in Iraq|Coalition forces]]. Since the United States has labelled its operations "humanitarian actions," independent aid organizations have been forced to defend their positions, or even evacuate their teams.&lt;ref&gt;MSF Article (2004) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&amp;objectid=762E8B7B-2F5F-448A-8EC26F2039794E54&amp;method=full_html Military humanitarianism: A deadly confusion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514040456/http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&amp;objectid=762E8B7B-2F5F-448A-8EC26F2039794E54&amp;method=full_html |date=14 May 2006 }} '''MSF'''.

==Documentary==
{{Main|Living in Emergency: Stories of Doctors Without Borders}}

''[[Living in Emergency: Stories of Doctors Without Borders|Living in Emergency]]'' is an award-winning documentary film by [[Mark N. Hopkins]] that tells the story of four MSF volunteer doctors confronting the challenges of medical work in war-torn areas of Liberia and Congo. It premiered at the 2008 [[Venice Film Festival]] and was theatrically released in the United States in 2010.

==1999 Nobel Peace Prize==
[[File:2015JamesOrbinski.jpg|thumb|[[James Orbinski]] speaking about MSF in 2015.]]
The then president of MSF, [[James Orbinski]], gave the Nobel Peace Prize speech on behalf of the organization.  In the opening, he discusses the conditions of the victims of the Rwandan Genocide and focuses on one of his woman patients:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abrams |first=Irwin |title=The Nobel Peace Prize and the laureates: An illustrated biographical history, 1901–2001 |year=2001 |publisher=Science History Publications |location=Nantucket, Massachusetts |pages=351–352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote | There were hundreds of women, children and men brought to the hospital that day, so many that we had to lay them out on the street and even operate on some of them there.  The gutters around the hospital ran red with blood.  The woman had not just been attacked with a machete, but her entire body rationally and systematically mutilated.  Her ears had been cut off.  And her face had been so carefully disfigured that a pattern was obvious in the slashes.  She was one among many—living an inhuman and simply indescribable suffering.  We could do little more for her at the moment than stop the bleeding with a few necessary sutures.  We were completely overwhelmed, and she knew that there were so many others.  She said to me in the clearest voice I have ever heard, 'Allez, allez…ummera, ummerasha'—'Go, go…my friend, find and let live your courage.' | James Orbinski | Nobel acceptance speech for MSF}}

Orbinski affirmed the organization’s commitment to publicizing the issues MSF encountered, stating&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=MSF Article (1999) |title=The Nobel Peace Prize speech |url=http://www.msf.org/article/nobel-peace-prize-speech |work=www.msf.org |publisher=MSF |accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote | Silence has long been confused with neutrality, and has been presented as a necessary condition for humanitarian action. From its beginning, MSF was created in opposition to this assumption. We are not sure that words can always save lives, but we know that silence can certainly kill. | James Orbinski}}

==Lasker Prize==
MSF received 2015 [[Lasker-Bloomberg Public Service Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/ultimas/2015/09/08/premio-lasker-2015-para-medicos-sin-fronteras-8995.html |title=2015 Lasker Prize for MSF (in Spanish) |publisher=Jornada.unam.mx |date=2015-09-08 |accessdate=2016-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422061632/http://www.jornada.unam.mx/ultimas/2015/09/08/premio-lasker-2015-para-medicos-sin-fronteras-8995.html/ |archivedate=22 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Namesakes==
A number of other non-governmental organizations have adopted names ending in "Sans Frontières" or "Without Borders", inspired by Médecins Sans Frontières: for example, [[Engineers Without Borders]], Clowns Without Borders and [[Reporters Without Borders]].

{{Indigenous Peoples of Canada}}
The '''Métis in Canada''' ({{IPAc-en|m|eɪ|ˈ|t|iː}}; {{IPA-frdia|meˈt͡sɪs|Canadian French:}}; {{IPA-frdia|meˈtis|European French:}}; {{IPA-frdia|mɪˈtʃɪf|Michif:}}) are groups of peoples in Canada who trace their descent to [[First Nations]] peoples and [[European Canadians|European settlers]], primarily French in the early decades. They are recognized as one of [[indigenous peoples in Canada|Canada's aboriginal peoples]] under the [[Constitution Act of 1982]], along with First Nations and [[Inuit]] peoples. As of 2016, they number over 587,545.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/abpopprof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=PR&amp;Code1=01&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=Canada&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;B1=All&amp;C1=All&amp;SEX_ID=1&amp;AGE_ID=1&amp;RESGEO_ID=1|title=Aboriginal Population Profile, 2016 Census - Canada [Country]|first=Government of Canada, Statistics|last=Canada|website=www12.statcan.gc.ca|accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian Métis represent the majority of people that identify as [[Métis]], although there are a number of [[Métis in the United States]].

While the Métis initially developed as the [[mixed-race]] descendants of early unions between [[First Nations]] and colonial-era European settlers (usually indigenous women and French settler men), within generations (particularly in central and western Canada), a distinct [[#Cultural definitions|Métis culture]] developed. The women in the unions in eastern Canada were usually [[Wabanaki Confederacy|Wabanaki]], [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]], and [[Menominee]]; and in western Canada they were [[Saulteaux]], [[Cree]], [[Ojibwe]], Nakoda, and Dakota/Lakota, or of mixed descent from these peoples. Their unions with European men engaged in the fur trade in the Old Northwest were often of the type known as [[Marriage 'à la façon du pays'|Marriage ''à la façon du pays'']] ("according to the custom of the country").&lt;ref&gt;Barkwell, Lawrence J., Leah Dorion and Darren Préfontaine. ''Métis Legacy: A Historiography and Annotated Bibliography''. Winnipeg: Pemmican Publications Inc. and Saskatoon: Gabriel Dumont Institute, 2001. {{ISBN|1-894717-03-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[New France]] was ceded to Great Britain's control in 1763, there was an important distinction between ''French Métis'' born of [[francophone]] ''[[Voyageurs|voyageur]]'' fathers, and the ''[[Anglo-Métis]]'' (known as "countryborn" or Mixed Bloods, for instance in the 1870 census of [[Manitoba]]) descended from [[English people|English]] or [[Scottish people|Scottish]] fathers. Today these two cultures have essentially coalesced into location-specific Métis traditions. This does not preclude a range of other Métis cultural expressions across North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006095911/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/genealogie/022-905.004-e.html|title=What to Search: Topics - Genealogy and Family History - Library and Archives Canada|date=6 October 2014|publisher=|accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rinella, Steven. 2008.

The contemporary Métis in Canada are a specific indigenous people; the term does not apply to every person of "mixed" heritage or ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=YMdYqTvG3EgC&amp;pg=PA254&amp;lpg=PA254&amp;dq=jackatar#v=onepage&amp;q=jackatar&amp;f=false |title=Walking a Tightrope: Aboriginal People and their Representations |last1=McNab |first1=David |last2=Lischke |first2=Ute |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While people of Métis culture or heritage are found across Canada,  the traditional Métis "[[homeland]]" (areas where Metis populations and culture developed as a distinct ethnicity historically) includes much of the [[Canadian Prairies]]. The most commonly known group are the "Red River Metis", centering on southern and central parts of [[Manitoba]] along the [[Red River of the North]]. 

Closely related are the [[Métis in the United States]], primarily those in border areas such as [[northern Michigan]], the [[Red River Valley]], and [[eastern Montana]]. These were areas in which there was considerable Aboriginal and European mixing due to [[North American fur trade|the 19th-century fur trade]]. But they do not have a federally recognized status here, except as enrolled members of federally recognized tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, James H. 1965.

Reprint Co., Reprints in ''Anthropology'' 7, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; Although Metis existed further west than today's Manitoba, much less is known about the Metis of Northern Canada.

==Self-identity and legal status==

In 2016, 587,545 people in Canada self-identified as Métis. They represented 35.1% of the total Aboriginal population and 1.5% of the total Canadian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/171025/t001a-eng.htm|title=Aboriginal identity population, Canada, 2016|first=Government of Canada, Statistics|last=Canada|website=www150.statcan.gc.ca|accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Métis people today are descendants of unions between generations of Métis individuals and live in Canadian society with people of other ethnicities. The exception are the Metis in rural and northern parts, who still live in close proximity to First Nations communities.

Over the past century, countless Métis have assimilated into the general [[European Canadian]] populations. Métis heritage (and thereby Aboriginal ancestry) is more common than is generally realized.&lt;ref&gt;Barkwell, Lawrence J., Leah Dorion and Darren Préfontaine. ''Métis Legacy: A Historiography and Annotated Bibliography''. Winnipeg: Pemmican Publications Inc. and Saskatoon: [[Gabriel Dumont Institute]], 2001. {{ISBN|1-894717-03-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geneticists estimate that 50 percent of today's population in [[Western Canada]] has some Aboriginal ancestry.&lt;ref name="mettis"/&gt; Most people with more distant ancestry are not part of the Metis ethnicity or culture.&lt;ref name="mettis"/&gt; 

Unlike among [[First Nation]]s peoples, there is no distinction between Treaty status and non-Treaty status. The  Métis did not sign treaties with Canada, with the exception of an adhesion to Treaty Three in Northwest Ontario. This adhesion was never implemented by the federal government. The legal definition is not yet fully developed.  Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982|S.35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 recognizes the rights of Indian, Métis and Inuit people in Section 35; however, it does not define these groups.&lt;ref&gt;Barkwell, Lawrence J., Leah Dorion and Darren Préfontaine. ''Métis Legacy: A Historiography and Annotated Bibliography''. Winnipeg: Pemmican Publications Inc. and Saskatoon: Gabriel Dumont Institute, 2001. {{ISBN|1-894717-03-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the Supreme Court of Canada defined a Métis as someone who self-identifies as Métis, has an ancestral connection to the historic Métis community, and is accepted by the modern community with continuity to the historic Metis community.&lt;ref name="Lambrecht2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lambrecht|first=Kirk N.|title=Aboriginal Consultation, Environmental Assessment, and Regulatory Review in Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G1NnSkcjuhsC&amp;pg=PA31|year=2013|publisher=University of Regina Press|isbn=978-0-88977-298-4|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical view of identity===
The most well-known and historically documented mixed-ancestry population in Canadian history are the groups who developed during the fur trade in south-eastern Rupert's Land, primarily in the Red River Settlement (now Manitoba) and the [[Southbranch Settlement]]s (Saskatchewan). In the late nineteenth century, they organized politically (led by men who had European educations) and had confrontations with the Canadian government in an effort to assert their independence. 

This was not the only place where ''métissage'' (mixing) between European and Indigenous people occurred. It was part of the history of colonization from the earliest days of settlements on the Atlantic Coast throughout the Americas.&lt;ref name="Senate"&gt;{{Cite report |author=Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |title="The People Who Own Themselves" Recognition of Métis Identity in Canada |url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/SEN/Committee/411/appa/rep/rep12jun13-e.pdf |publisher=Canadian Senate |page= |docket= |accessdate=7 February 2014 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2, 5}} But the strong sense of ethnic [[national identity]] among the mostly French- and [[Michif]]-speaking Métis along the [[Red River of the North|Red River]], demonstrated during the [[Louis Riel|Riel Rebellions]], resulted in wider use of the term "Métis" as the main word used by Canadians for all mixed Euro-Native groups.

Continued organizing and political activity resulted in "the Métis" gaining official recognition from the national government as one of the recognized Aboriginal groups in [[Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982|S.35 of the Constitution Act, 1982]], which states:&lt;ref name="defe"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-16.html |title=Rights of the Aboriginal People of Canada |work=Canadian Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|35. (1) The existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the Aboriginal People of Canada are hereby recognized and affirmed.

:(2) In this Act, "Aboriginal Peoples of Canada" includes the Indian, Inuit, and Métis Peoples of Canada.

: ... | Constitution Act, 1982}}

Section-35(2) does not define criteria for an individual who is Métis. This has left open the question of whether "Métis" in this context should apply only to the descendants of the Red River Métis or to all mixed-ancestry groups and individuals. Many members of First Nations may have mixed ancestry, but identify primarily by the tribal nation, rather than as Métis. Since passage of the 1982 act, many groups in Canada who are not related to the Red River Métis have adopted the word "Métis" as a descriptor.&lt;ref name="Senate"/&gt;{{rp|7}}

===Lack of a legal definition===
{{Further|Powley ruling}}
It is not clear who has the moral and legal authority to define the word "Métis". There is no comprehensive legal definition of Métis status in Canada; this is in contrast to the ''Indian Act'', which creates an [[Indian Register]] for all (Status) First Nations people. Some commentators have argued that one of the [[indigenous rights|rights of an indigenous people]] is to define its own identity, precluding the need for a government-sanctioned definition.&lt;ref name="Senate"/&gt;{{rp|9–10}} The question is open as to who should receive Aboriginal rights flowing from Métis identity. No federal legislation defines the Métis.

Alberta is the only province to have defined the term in law under the ''Métis Settlements Act'' (MSA), which defines a Métis as "a person of Aboriginal ancestry who identifies with Métis history and culture". This was done in the context of creating a test for legal eligibility for membership in one of Alberta's eight Métis settlements. The MSA, together with requirements at the community level (Elder &amp; community acceptance) create the legal requirements for residency ion the Metis Settlements. In Alberta law, belonging to a "Metis Association" (Metis National Council or any of its affiliates, Metis Federation of Canada, Congress of Aboriginal People) does not grant one rights granted to members of the Alberta Metis Settlements. The MSA test excludes those people who are Status Indians (that is, a member of a First Nation), an exclusion which was upheld by the Supreme Court in ''Alberta v. Cunningham'' (2011).&lt;ref name="Senate"/&gt;{{rp|10–11}}

The number of people self-identifying as Métis has risen sharply since the late 20th century: between 1996 and 2006, the population of Canadians who self-identify as Métis nearly doubled, to approximately 390,000.&lt;ref name="Senate"/&gt;{{rp|2}} Until ''[[R v. Powley]]'' (2003), there was no legal definition of Métis other than the legal requirements found in the Metis Settlements Act of 1990.

The Powley case involved a claim by Steven Powley and his son Rodney, two members of the [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario]] Métis community who were asserting Métis hunting rights. The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] outlined three broad factors to identify Métis who have Hunting Rights as Aboriginal peoples:&lt;ref&gt;(2003), 230 D.L.R. (4th) 1, 308 N.R. 201, 2003 SCC 43 [Powley]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|
* self-identification as a Métis individual;
* ancestral connection to an historic Métis community; and
* acceptance by a Métis community.}}

All three factors must be present for an individual to qualify under the SCC legal definition of Métis. In addition, the court stated that
{{quote|[t]he term Métis in s. 35 does not encompass all individuals with mixed Indian and European heritage; rather, it refers to distinctive peoples who, in addition to their mixed ancestry, developed their own customs, ways of life, and recognizable group identity separate from their Indian or Inuit and European forebears.&lt;ref name="Senate"/&gt;{{rp|9}} The court was explicit that its ten-point test is not a comprehensive definition of Métis.}}

Questions remain as to whether Métis have [[treaty rights]]; this is an explosive issue in the Canadian Aboriginal community today. It has been stated that "only First Nations could legitimately sign treaties with the government so, by definition, Métis have no Treaty rights."&lt;ref name=mcnad&gt;McNab, David, and Ute Lischke. ''The Long Journey of a Forgotten People: Métis Identities and Family Histories.'' Waterloo, Ont: Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-88920-523-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; One treaty names Metis in the title: the Halfbreed (Métis in the French version) Adhesion to [[Treaty 3]]. Another, the [[Robinson Superior Treaty]] of 1850, listed 84 persons classified as "half-breeds" in the Treaty, so included them and their descendants.&lt;ref name=morris&gt;Morris, Alexander.'' The Treaties of Canada with the Indians of Manitoba and the North West Territories Including the Negotiations on which They Were.'' Belfords, Clarke &amp; Co., 1880&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds, if not thousands, of Métis were initially included in a number of other treaties, and then excluded under later amendments to the [[Indian Act]].&lt;ref name=mcnad/&gt;

===Definitions used by Métis representative organizations===
Two main advocacy groups claim to speak for the Métis in Canada: the [[Congress of Aboriginal Peoples]] (CAP) and the [[Métis National Council]].(MNC). Each uses different approaches to define Métis individuals. The CAP, which has nine regional affiliates, represents all Aboriginal people who are not part of the reserve system, including Métis and [[non-Status Indians]]. It does not define Métis and uses a broad conception based on self-identification.

The  Metis National Council broke away from the Native Council of Canada, CAP's predecessor, in 1983. Its political leadership of the time stated that the NCC's "pan-Aboriginal approach to issues did not allow the Métis Nation to effectively represent itself".&lt;ref name="Senate"/&gt;{{rp|11}} The MNC views the Métis as a single nation with a common history and culture centred on the fur trade of "west-central North America" in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This position has been subject to much debate and controversy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/metis-are-a-people-not-a-historical-process&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/the-other-metis&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2003 MNC had five provincial affiliates:  
*Metis Nation of Ontario Secretariat, 
*Manitoba Metis Federation Incorporated,
*Metis Nation of Saskatchewan Association,
*Metis Nation of Alberta Association, and the  
*Metis Nation of British Columbia. 


The Metis Nation of Alberta Association adopted the following "Definition of Métis":
{{quote|Métis means a person who self-identifies as a Métis, is distinct from other aboriginal peoples, is of historic Métis Nation ancestry, and is accepted by the Métis Nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albertametis.com/MNAHome/MNA-Membership-Definition.aspx Definition of Métis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222063238/http://www.albertametis.com/MNAHome/MNA-Membership-Definition.aspx |date=2014-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Several local, independent Métis organizations have been founded in Canada. In [[Northern Canada]] neither the CAP nor the MNC have affiliates; here local Métis organizations deal directly with the federal government and are part of the [[Aboriginal land claims]] process. Three of the [[Aboriginal self-government|comprehensive settlements]] (modern treaties) in force in the Northwest Territories include benefits for Métis people who can prove local Aboriginal ancestry prior to 1921 ([[Treaty 11]]).&lt;ref name="Senate"/&gt;{{rp|13}}

The federal government recognizes the Metis National Council as the representative Metis group.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/trudeau-details-work-on-new-relationship-with-canadas-aboriginal-peoples/article33333113/|title=Trudeau pledges annual meetings with indigenous leaders to advance reconciliation|publisher=|accessdate=15 November 2018|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December of 2016, Prime Minister Trudeau made a commitment to the leaders of the Assembly of First Nations, the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, and the Métis National Council to have annual meetings. He also committed to two other initiatives aimed at heeding the Calls to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) which examined abuses at Indian Residential Schools.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail.com"/&gt;,

Indigenous Affairs Canada, the relevant federal ministry, deals with the MNC. On April 13, 2017 the two parties signed the Canada-Metis Nation Accord, with the goal of working with the Metis Nation, as represented by the Metis National Council, on a Nation to Nation basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pm.gc.ca/eng/canada-metis-nation-accord|title=Canada-Metis Nation Accord|date=20 April 2017|publisher=|accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the Powley ruling, Métis organizations are issuing Metis Nation citizenship cards to their members. Several organizations are registered with the Canadian government to provide Métis cards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aboriginalcanada.gc.ca/acp/site.nsf/eng/ao35055.html Aboriginal Canada Portal&amp;nbsp;– Métis Card] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205180313/http://www.aboriginalcanada.gc.ca/acp/site.nsf/eng/ao35055.html |date=2013-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The criteria to receive a card and the rights associated with the card vary with each organization. For example, for membership in the [[Métis Nation of Alberta]] Association (MNAA), an applicant must provide a documented genealogy and family tree dating to the mid 1800s, proving descent from one or more members of historic Métis groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albertametis.com/MNAHome/mna-membership.aspx "MNA membership"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106042852/http://www.albertametis.com/MNAHome/MNA-Membership.aspx |date=2013-11-06 }}, Métis Nation of Alberta Metis&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Métis Council]] will accept persons of mixed blood (European/Aboriginal blood (Indian ancestry)) that is distinct from Indian and Inuit, and who have genealogical ties to Aboriginal ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianmetis.com/Qualifying.htm |title=Qualifying As A Métis |publisher=Canadianmetis.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Métis Nation of Ontario]] requires that successful applicants for what it calls "citizenship", must "see themselves and identify themselves as distinctly Métis. This requires that individuals make a positive choice to be culturally and identifiable Métis".&lt;ref name="metisnation.org"&gt;http://www.metisnation.org/media/83726/mno_interim_registry_package.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; They note that "an individual is not Métis simply because he or she has some Aboriginal ancestry, but does not have Indian or Inuit status".&lt;ref name="metisnation.org"/&gt; It also requires proof of Métis ancestry: "This requires a genealogical connection to a 'Métis ancestor'&amp;nbsp;– not an Indian or aboriginal ancestor".&lt;ref name="metisnation.org"/&gt;

===Cultural definitions===
Cultural definitions of Métis identity inform legal and political ones.

The 1996 Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples stated:
{{quote|Many Canadians have mixed Aboriginal/non-Aboriginal ancestry, but that does not make them Métis or even Aboriginal ... What distinguishes Métis people from everyone else is that they associate themselves with a culture that is distinctly Métis.&lt;ref name="Senate"/&gt;{{rp|12}}}}

Traditional markers of Métis culture include use of [[creole language|creole]] Aboriginal-European languages, such as [[Michif]] (French-Cree-Dene) and [[Bungi Creole|Bungi]] (Cree-Ojibwa-English); distinctive clothing, such as the arrow sash ([[ceinture flêchée]]); and a rich repertoire of [[Metis fiddle|fiddle music, jigs and square dances]], and practicing a traditional economy based on hunting, trapping, and gathering. But, there is increasing recognition that not all Métis hunted, or wore the sash, or spoke a creole language.&lt;ref name="Senate"/&gt;{{rp|14–15}}

===Origin===
During the height of the [[North American fur trade]] from 1650 onward, many [[French people|French]] and British fur traders married First Nations and Inuit women, mainly Cree, Ojibwa, or Saulteaux located in the Great Lakes area and into the north west. The majority of these fur traders were [[French people|French]] and Scottish; the French traders were usually [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], while the British fur-traders were Protestant.&lt;ref name="mettis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telusplanet.net/public/dgarneau/metis.htm|title=Complete History of the Canadian Métis Culturework=Métis nation of the North West}}&lt;/ref&gt; These marriages are commonly referred to as [[Marriage 'à la façon du pays'|marriage à la façon du pays]] or marriage according to the "custom of the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Canadian Prairies|last = Friesen|first = Gerald|publisher = Toronto University Press|year = 1987|isbn = 0-8020-6648-8|location = Toronto|page = 67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their children often grew up primarily in their mothers' cultures, but were often also introduced to Catholicism. In many cases, as the fur traders lived with the native women at the location of their tribes, the children grew up in primarily First Nations societies.

But, as more Métis lived in communities with a fur-trapping tradition, they created a new, distinct Aboriginal people in [[North America]]. First Nations women were the link between cultures; they provided companionship for the fur traders, introductions to their people and culture, and also aided in their survival. First Nations women were able to translate the native languages, sewed new clothing for their husbands and children, and generally were involved in resolving any cultural issues that arose. The First Peoples had survived in the west for thousands of years, so the fur traders benefited greatly from their First Nations wives' knowledge of the land and its resources. Métis people were thought of as the familial bond between the Europeans and First Nations and Inuit peoples of North America. As adults, the men often worked as fur-trade company interpreters, as well as fur trappers in their turn.&lt;ref name="mettis"/&gt; Many of the first generations of Métis lived within the First Nations societies of their wives and children, but also started to marry Métis women.

According to historian Jacob A. Schooley, the Métis developed over at least two generations and within different economic classes. In the first stage, "servant" (employee) traders of the fur trade companies, known as wintering partners, would stay for the season with First Nations bands, and make a "country marriage" with a high-status native woman. This woman and her children would move to live in the vicinity of a trading fort or post, becoming "House Indians" (as they were called by the company men). House Indians eventually formed distinct bands. Children raised within these "House Indian" bands often became employees of the companies. (Foster cites the legendary [[York boat]] captain Paulet Paul as an example). Eventually this second-generation group ended employment with the company and became commonly known as "freemen" traders and trappers. They lived with their families raising children in a distinct culture, accustomed to the fur-trade life, that valued free trading and the buffalo hunt in particular. He considered that the third generation, who were sometimes Métis on both sides, were the first true Métis. He suggests that in the [[Red River of the North|Red River]] region, many "House Indians" (and some non-"House" First Nations) were assimilated into Métis culture due to the Catholic church's strong presence in that region. In the [[Fort Edmonton]] region however, many House Indians never adopted a Métis identity but continued to identify primarily as Cree, Saulteaux, Ojibwa, and Chipweyan descendants up until the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="foster"&gt;

In 1812, many immigrants (mainly Scottish farmers) moved to the [[Red River Valley]] in present-day [[Manitoba]].

Most references to the Métis in the 19th century applied to the Plains Métis, but more particularly the Red River Métis.&lt;ref name="foster"/&gt; But, the Plains Métis tended to identify by occupational categories: [[Métis buffalo hunt|buffalo hunters]], pemmican and fur traders, and "tripmen" in the York boat [[fur brigade]]s among the men;&lt;ref name="foster"/&gt; the [[moccasin]] sewers and cooks were among the women.

The remaining 1,565 people were of predominately European, Canadian or American background.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Métis_in_Canada&amp;action=edit "The Metis"], Alberta Settlement, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; 

During this time the Canadian government signed treaties (known as the "[[Numbered Treaties]]") with various First Nations. These Nations ceded property rights to almost the entire western plains to the Government of Canada. In return for their ceding traditional lands, the Canadian government promised food, education, medical help, etc.&lt;ref name=Treaties&gt;{{cite web|title=Numbered Treaty Overview|url=http://www.canadiana.org/citm/specifique/numtreatyoverview_e.html |publisher=Canada in the Making |work=Canadiana.org (Formerly Canadian Institute for Historical Microreproductions)|accessdate=2009-11-16|quote=The Numbered Treaties—also called the Land Cession or Post-Confederation Treaties—were signed between 1871 and 1921, and granted the federal government large tracts of land throughout the Prairies, Canadian North, and Northwestern Ontario for white settlement and industrial use.  The disruptive effects of these treaties can be still felt in modern times.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Métis generally did not sign any treaty as a group, they were sometimes included, even listed as "half-breeds" in some records.

In the late 19th century, following the British North America Act (1867), [[Louis Riel]], a Metis who was formally educated, became a leader of the Métis in the Red River area. He denounced the Canadian government surveys on Metis lands &lt;ref name="biographi.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/riel_louis_1844_85_11E.html|title=Biography – RIEL, LOUIS (1844-85) – Volume XI (1881-1890) – Dictionary of Canadian Biography|publisher=|accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a speech delivered in late August 1869 from the steps of [[Saint Boniface Cathedral]].&lt;ref name="mettis"/&gt; The Métis became more fearful when the Canadian government appointed the notoriously [[Francophobia|anti-French]] [[William McDougall (politician)|William McDougall]] as the [[List of lieutenant governors of the Northwest Territories|Lieutenant Governor of the Northwest Territories]] on September 28, 1869, in anticipation of a formal transfer of lands to take effect in December.&lt;ref name="mettis"/&gt; On November 2, 1869 Louis Riel and 120 men seized Upper Fort Garry, the administrative headquarters of the Hudson's Bay Company. This was the first overt act of Metis resistance.&lt;ref name="biographi.ca"/&gt; On March 4, 1870 the Provisional Government, led by Louis Riel, executed Thomas Scott after Scott was convicted of insubordination and treason.&lt;!-- And who was he? --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/thomas-scott|title=Thomas Scott - The Canadian Encyclopedia|website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elected Legislative Assembly of Assiniboia &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/inr/resources/print,the-legislative-assembly-of-assiniboia.html|title=Indigenous and Northern Relations - Province of Manitoba|publisher=|accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently sent three delegates to Ottawa to negotiate with the Canadian government. This resulted in the ''[[Manitoba Act]]'' and that province's entry into the [[Canadian Confederation]]. Due to the execution of Scott, Riel was charged with murder and fled to the United States in exile.&lt;ref name="riel"/&gt;
[[File:Warrant To Apprehend.jpg|thumb|300px|Copy of the "Warrant To Apprehend" Riel and [[Ambroise-Dydime Lépine|Lépine]], issued in [[Winnipeg]]]]

In March 1885, the Métis heard that a contingent of 500 [[North-West Mounted Police]] was heading west.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, John. ''Quiet Revolution West: The Rebirth of Métis Nationalism''. (Calgary: Fifth House Publishers, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; They organized and formed the [[Provisional Government of Saskatchewan]], with Pierre Parenteau as President and [[Gabriel Dumont (Métis leader)|Gabriel Dumont]] as adjutant-general. Riel took charge of a few hundred armed men. They suffered defeat by Canadian armed forces in a conflict known as the [[North West Rebellion]], which occurred in northern Saskatchewan from March 26 to May 12, 1885.&lt;ref name="riel"/&gt; Gabriel Dumont fled to the United States, while Riel, Poundmaker, and Big Bear surrendered. Big Bear and Poundmaker each were convicted &lt;!-- what were the charges? --&gt;and received a three-year sentence. On July 6, 1885, Riel was convicted of [[Treason#Canada|high treason]] and was [[Trial of Louis Riel|sentenced to hang]]. Riel appealed but he was executed on November 16, 1885.&lt;ref name="riel"/&gt;

===Land ownership===
Issues of land ownership became a central theme, as the Metis sold most of the 600,000 acres they received in the first settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Ens, "Métis Lands in Manitoba," ''Manitoba History'' (1983), Number 5, [http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/mb_history/05/metislands.shtml online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. N. Sprague, "The Manitoba Land Question 1870–1882," ''Journal of Canadian Studies'' 15#3  (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1930s, political activism arose in Métis communities in Alberta and Saskatchewan over land rights, and some filed land claims for the return of certain lands.&lt;ref&gt;Barkwell, Lawrence. ''The Metis homeland: its settlements and communities''. Winnipeg, Manitoba: Louis Riel Institute, 2016. {{ISBN|978-1-927531129}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Five men, sometimes dubbed "The Famous Five", ([[James P. Brady]], [[Malcolm Norris]], Peter Tomkins Jr., Joe Dion, Felix Callihoo) were instrumental in having the Alberta government form the 1934 "Ewing Commission", headed by [[Albert Ewing]], to deal with land claims.&lt;ref name=Making&gt;{{cite web|title=The Métis|url=http://www.canadiana.org/citm/specifique/metis_e.rtf|publisher=Canada in the Making|year=2005|format=rtf|accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alberta government passed the [[Métis Population Betterment Act]] in 1938.&lt;ref name=Making/&gt; The act provided funding and land to the Métis. (The provincial government later rescinded portions of the land in certain areas.)&lt;ref name=Making/&gt;

==The Métis settlements of Alberta – a distinct Métis identity==
[[File:Federation of Metis Settlements (Metisland) Flag.gif|thumb]]
*OUR PEOPLE, OUR LAND, OUR CULTURE, OUR FUTURE – Metis Settlements Motto

The Métis settlements in Alberta are the only recognized land base of Métis in Canada. They are represented and governed collectively by a unique Métis government known as the Métis Settlements General Council (MSGC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metissettlements.com|title=Metis Settlement General Council – Our Land. Our Culture. Our Future.|website=www.metissettlements.com|accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the "All-Council". The MSGC is the provincial, national, and international representative of the Federated Metis Settlements. It holds [[fee simple]] land title via Letters Patents to 1.25 million acres of land, making the MSGC the largest land holder in the province, other than the Crown in the Right of Alberta. The MSGC is the only recognized Metis Governerment in Canada with prescribed land, power, and jurisdiction via the Metis Settlements Act. (This legislation followed legal suits filed by the Metis Settlements against the Crown in the 1970’s). 

The Métis Settlements consist of predominantly Indigenous Métis populations native to Northern Alberta – unique from those of the Red River, the Great Lakes, and other migrant Métis from further east. However, following the Riel and Dumont resistances some Red-River Métis fled westward, where they married into the contemporary Métis settlement populations during the end of the 19th century and into the early 20th century. Historically referred to as the "Nomadic Half-breeds", the Métis of [[Northern Alberta]] have a unique history. Their fight for land is still evident today with the eight contemporary Métis settlements.

Following the formal establishment of the Métis settlements, then called Half-Breed Colonies, in the 1930s by a distinct Métis political organization, the Metis populations in Northern Alberta were the only Metis to secure communal Metis lands. During renewed Indigenous activism during the 1960s into the 1970s, political organizations were formed or revived among the Métis. In [[Métis in Alberta|Alberta, the Métis settlements]] united as: The "Alberta Federation of Métis Settlement Associations" in the mid-1970s. Today, the Federation is represented by the Métis Settlements General Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://metissettlements.com/updates/|title=Métis Settlements General Council|publisher=|accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the constitutional talks of 1982, the Métis were recognized as one of the three Aboriginal peoples of Canada, in part by the Federation of Metis Settlements. In 1990, the Alberta government, following years of conferences and negotiations between the Federation of Métis Settlements (FMS) and the Crown in the Right of Alberta, restored land titles to the northern Métis communities through the "Métis Settlement Act", replacing the Métis Betterment Act.&lt;ref name=Making/&gt; Originally the first Métis settlements in Alberta were called colonies and consisted of:
* Buffalo Lake (Caslan) or Beaver River
* Cold Lake
* East Prairie (south of Lesser Slave Lake)
* Elizabeth (east of Elk Point)
* Fishing Lake (Packechawanis)
* Gift Lake (Ma-cha-cho-wi-se) or Utikuma Lake
* Goodfish Lake
* Kikino
* Kings Land
* Marlboro
* Paddle Prairie (or Keg River)
* Peavine (Big Prairie, north of High Prairie)
* Touchwood
* Wolf Lake (north of Bonnyville)

In the 1960s, the settlements of Marlboro, Touchwood, Cold Lake, and Wolf Lake were dissolved by Order-in-Council by the Alberta Government. The remaining Metis Settlers were forced to move into one of the eight remaining Metis Settlements – leaving the eight contemporary Métis Settlements.

The position of [[Federal Interlocutor for Métis and Non-Status Indians]] was created in 1985 as a portfolio in the [[Cabinet of Canada|Canadian Cabinet]].&lt;ref name=Interlocutor&gt;{{cite web|title=Office of the Federal Interlocutor for Métis and Non-Status Indians (Mandate, Roles and Responsibilities)|url=http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ai/arp/mrr-eng.asp|publisher=Indian and Northern Affairs Canada|year=2009|accessdate=2010-04-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128070204/http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ai/arp/mrr-eng.asp|archivedate=2010-01-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada|Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development]] is officially responsible only for [[Indian Register|Status Indians]] and largely with those living on [[Indian reserve]]s. The new position was created in order provide a liaison between the federal government and Métis and non-status Aboriginal peoples, urban Aboriginals, and their representatives.&lt;ref name=Interlocutor/&gt;

===Organizations===
The Provisional Government of Saskatchewan was the name given by Louis Riel to the independent state he declared during the North-West Rebellion (Resistance) of 1885 in what is today the Canadian province of [[Saskatchewan]]. The governing council was named the [[Exovedate]], Latin for "of the flock".&lt;ref&gt;https://indigenouspeoplesatlasofcanada.ca/article/1885-northwest-resistance/&lt;/ref&gt; The council debated issues ranging from military policy to local bylaws and theological issues. It met at [[Batoche, Saskatchewan]], and exercised real authority only over the [[Southbranch Settlement]]. The provisional government collapsed that year after the [[Battle of Batoche]].
[[File:ProvisionalMetisGovernment.jpg|thumb|Councillors of the Métis Provisional Government, 1870. [[Louis Riel]] sits in the centre.]]
The [[Métis National Council]] was formed in 1983, following the recognition of the Métis as an Aboriginal Peoples in Canada, in [[Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982|Section Thirty-five]] of the [[Constitution Act, 1982]]. The MNC was a member of the World Council of Indigenous (WCIP). In 1997 the Metis National Council was granted NGO Consultative Status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. The MNC's first ambassador to this group was Clement Chartier. MNC is a founding member of the American Council of Indigenous Peoples (ACIP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metisnation.ca/index.php/news/founding-meeting-of-the-american-council-of-indigenous-peoples|title=Founding Meeting of the American Council of Indigenous Peoples - Métis National Council|website=www.metisnation.ca|accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Métis National Council is composed of five provincial Métis organizations,&lt;ref&gt;National Council(Canada), and Michelle M. Mann.

Ottawa: National Council of Welfare, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-662-46640-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; namely,
* [[Métis Nation British Columbia]]
* [[Métis Nation of Alberta]]
* [[Métis Nation-Saskatchewan]]
* [[Manitoba Métis Federation]]
* [[Métis Nation of Ontario]]

The Métis people hold province-wide ballot box elections for political positions in these associations, held at regular intervals, for regional and provincial leadership. Métis citizens and their communities are represented and participate in these Métis governance structures by way of elected Locals or Community Councils, as well as provincial assemblies held annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metisnation.ca/|title=Métis National Council Online|work=MÉTIS NATIONAL COUNCIL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Congress of Aboriginal Peoples (CAP) and its nine regional affiliates represent all Aboriginal people who are not part of the reserve system, including Métis and [[non-Status Indians]].

Due to political differences to the MNBC, a separate Métis organization in British Columbia was formed in June 2011; it is called the British Columbia Métis Federation (BCMF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcmetis.com|title=BC Métis Federation|website=www.bcmetis.com|accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have no affiliation with the Métis National Council and have not been officially recognized by the government.

The Ontario Métis Aboriginal Association–Woodland Métis is based in Ontario and is not affiliated with the Métis National Council. Its representatives think the MNC is too focused on the Métis of the prairies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omaa.or/about_us.html The Ontario Métis Aboriginal Association – Woodland Métis]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Woodland Métis are also not affiliated with the Métis Nation of Ontario (MNO) and MNO President Tony Belcourt said in 2005 that he did not know who OMAA members are, but that they are not Metis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ammsa.com/publications/ontario-birchbark/omaa-names-mno-legal-action-against-governments|title=OMAA names MNO in legal action against governments|website=Ammsa.com|accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Supreme Court of Canada appeal (Document C28533, page 17), the federal government states that "membership in OMAA and/or MNO does not establish membership in the specific local aboriginal community for the purposes of establishing a s. 35 [indigenous and treaty] right. Neither OMAA nor the MNO constitute the sort of discrete, historic and site-specific community contemplated by Van der Peet capable of holding a constitutionally protected aboriginal
right".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitutional-law.net/index.php?option=com_mtree&amp;task=att_download&amp;link_id=222&amp;cf_id=24,|title=http://www.constitutional-law.net/index.php?option=com_mtree&amp;task=att_download&amp;link_id=222&amp;cf_id=24|publisher=|accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of these claim to represent all Métis. Other Métis registry groups also focus on recognition and protection of their culture and heritage. They reflect their communities' particular extensive kinship ties and culture that resulted from settlement in historic villages along the fur trade.

===Language===
{{Further|Michif language|Bungi creole}}
A majority of the Métis once spoke, and many still speak, either [[Métis French]] or an indigenous language such as Mi'kmaq, Cree, Anishinaabemowin, Denésoliné, etc. A few in some regions spoke a [[mixed language]] called [[Michif language|Michif]] which is composed of Plains Cree verbs and French nouns. ''Michif'', ''Mechif'' or ''Métchif'' is a phonetic spelling of the Métis pronunciation of ''Métif'', a variant of ''Métis''.&lt;ref&gt;*Barkwell, Lawrence J. ''Michif Language Resources: An Annotated Bibliography.'' Winnipeg, Louis Riel Institute, 2002. See also www.metismuseum.com&lt;/ref&gt; The Métis today predominantly speak Canadian English, with [[Canadian French]] a strong second language, as well as numerous Aboriginal tongues.&lt;ref name=refs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metisresourcecentre.mb.ca/fastfacts/|title=Fast Facts on Métis|work=Métis Culture &amp; Heritage Resource Centre|access-date=2009-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110050545/http://www.metisresourcecentre.mb.ca/fastfacts/|archive-date=2010-01-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Métis French is best preserved in Canada.

Michif is most used in the United States, notably in the [[Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation]] of North Dakota. There Michif is the [[official language]] of the Métis who reside on this Chippewa (Ojibwe) reservation.&lt;ref name=lag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metisresourcecentre.mb.ca/language/language.htm|title=The Michif language|work=Metis Culture &amp; Heritage Resource Centre|access-date=2009-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517034625/http://www.metisresourcecentre.mb.ca/language/language.htm|archive-date=2009-05-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After years of decline in use of these languages, the provincial Métis councils are encouraging their revival, teaching in schools and use in communities. The encouragement and use of Métis French and Michif is growing due to outreach after at least a generation of decline.&lt;ref name="Barkwell, Lawrence J. 2006"&gt;Barkwell, Lawrence J., Leah Dorion, and Audreen Hourie. ''Métis Legacy: Michif Culture, Heritage, and Folkways.'' Métis Legacy Series, v. 2. Saskatoon: Gabriel Dumont Institute, 2006. {{ISBN|0-920915-80-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th-century community of Anglo-Métis, more commonly known as ''Countryborn'', were children of people in the Rupert's Land fur trade; they were typically of Orcadian, other Scottish, or English paternal descent and Aboriginal maternal descent.&lt;ref name="Barkwell, Lawrence J. 2006"/&gt; Their first languages would have been Aboriginal ([[Cree language]], [[Western Ojibwa language|Saulteaux language]], [[Assiniboine language]], etc.) and [[English language|English]]. The [[Canadian Gaelic|Gaelic]] and [[Scots language|Scots]] spoken by  Orcadians and other Scots became part of the [[creole language]] referred to as "[[Bungi creole|Bungee]]".&lt;ref&gt;Blain, Eleanor M. (1994). ''The Red River Dialect''. Winnipeg: Wuerz Publishing.[http://tceplus.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0001097 Bungee] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315101109/http://tceplus.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0001097 |date=2008-03-15 }} (Canadian Encyclopedia)| accessdate =2009-10-06&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flag===
The [[Métis flag]] is one of the oldest patriotic flags originating in Canada.&lt;ref name=refff&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metisresourcecentre.mb.ca/history/flag.htm|title=The Métis flag|work=Gabriel Dumont Institute (Métis Culture &amp; Heritage Resource Centre)|access-date=2009-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304015251/http://www.metisresourcecentre.mb.ca/history/flag.htm|archive-date=2009-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Métis have two flags. Both flags use the same design of a central [[infinity symbol]], but are different colours.  The red flag was the first flag used.  It is currently the oldest flag made in Canada that is still in use.  The first red flag was given to [[Cuthbert Grant]] in 1815 by the North-West Company.  The red flag was also used at the [[Battle of Seven Oaks]], "La Grnoullière" in 1816.  Contrary to popular beliefs the red and blue are not cultural or linguistique identifiers and do not represent the companies.&lt;ref name=refff/&gt;

===Distinction of lower-case ''m'' versus upper-case ''M''===
The term Métis was originally used simply to refer to mixed-race children of the union of Frenchmen (Europeans) and Native women. The first records of "Métis" were made by 1600 on the East Coast of Canada ([[Acadia]]), where French exploration and settlement started.

As [[French Canadians]] followed the fur trade to the west, they made more unions with different [[First Nations]] women, including the Cree. Descendants of English or Scottish and natives were historically called "half-breeds" or "country born". They sometimes adopted a more agrarian culture of subsistence farming and tended to be reared in Protestant denominations.&lt;ref&gt;E. Foster, "The Métis: The People and the Term" (1978) ''3 Prairie Forum'' 79, at 86–87.107&lt;/ref&gt; The term eventually evolved to refer to all 'half-breeds' or persons of mixed First Nations-European ancestry, whether descended from the historic Red River Métis or not.

Lower case 'm' métis refers to those who are of mixed native and other ancestry, recognizing the many people of varied racial ancestry. Capital 'M' Métis refers to a particular sociocultural heritage and an ethnic self-identification that is based on more than racial classification.&lt;ref&gt;J. Brown, "Métis", ''Canadian Encyclopedia'', vol. 2 (Edmonton: Hurtig, 1985) at 1124.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that people who identify as métis should not be included in the definition of 'Métis'. Others view this distinction as recent, artificial, and offensive, criticized for creating from what are newly imagined and neatly defined ethnological boundaries, justification to exclude "other Métis".

Some Métis have proposed that only the descendants of the Red River Métis should be constitutionally recognized, as they had developed the most distinct culture as a people in historic times.&lt;ref&gt;Paul L.A.H. Chartrand &amp; John Giokas, "Defining 'the Métis People': The Hard Case of Canadian Aboriginal Law" in Paul L. A. H. Chartrand, ed., ''Who Are Canada's Aboriginal Peoples?: Recognition, Definition, and Jurisdiction'', (Saskatoon: Purich, 2002) 268 at 294&lt;/ref&gt; Such a limitation would result in excluding some of the Maritime, Quebec, and Ontario Métis, classifying them simply by the lower case ''m'' métis status. In a recent decision ({{cite CanLII|litigants=Daniels v Canada (Indian Affairs and Northern Development)|link = Daniels v. Canada (Indian Affairs and Northern Development)|year=2016|court=scc|num=12|parallelcite=}}), the Supreme Court of Canada has rejected such homogenizing and essentializing definition of Métis identity based on a narrow nationalistic interpretation of Métis identity, recognizing the diversity of Métis communities across Canada, including the existence of Métis communities in Nova Scotia at para 17:&lt;ref name=Daniels&gt;{{cite CanLII

{{quote|[17] There is no consensus on who is considered Métis or a non-status Indian, nor need there be. Cultural and ethnic labels do not lend themselves to neat boundaries. ‘Métis’ can refer to the historic Métis community in Manitoba’s Red River Settlement or it can be used as a general term for anyone with mixed European and Aboriginal heritage. Some mixed-ancestry communities identify as Métis, others as Indian:

:There is no one exclusive Metis People in Canada, anymore than there is no one exclusive Indian people in Canada. The Metis of eastern Canada and northern Canada are as distinct from Red River Metis as any two peoples can be&amp;nbsp;... As early as 1650, a distinct Metis community developed in LeHeve [sic], Nova Scotia, separate from Acadians and Micmac Indians. All Metis are aboriginal people. All have Indian ancestry.{{rp|12}}}}

'''National League for the Defense of Religious Liberty''' (''Liga Nacional Defensora de la Libertad Religiosa'' - LNDLR) or '''National League for the Defense of Religious Freedom''' was a Mexican Catholic religious civil rights organization formed in March 1925 that played a crucial role in the [[Cristero War]] of 1926-1929.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, Michael S., [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qxp-GWiDPioC&amp;pg Concise encyclopedia of Mexico] p. 147, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mexico City]]-based organization&lt;ref&gt;Tuck, Jim, [http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/mexico/gorostieta.htm The Anti-clerical Who Led a Catholic Rebellion], Latin American Studies&lt;/ref&gt; was created by former members of the short-lived [[National Catholic Party]] (Partido Católico Nacional),&lt;ref&gt;Jennie Purnell, "Cristero Rebellion", in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Vol. 1, p. 372. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; the Union of Mexican Catholic Ladies (''Unión de Damas Católicas Mexicanas''); a student organization, the [[Jesuit]]-led Catholic Association of Mexican Youth (''Asociación Católica de la Juventud Mexicana'', ACJM); the [[Knights of Columbus]]; the National Parents' Association; and the National Catholic Labor Confederation.&lt;ref&gt;David Espinosa, ''Jesuit Student Groups, the Universidad Iberoamericana, and Political Resistance in Mexico, 1913-1979.'' Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 2014, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The League had by June of its founding year about 36,000 members and chapters in almost every state of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, Michael S., [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qxp-GWiDPioC&amp;pg Concise encyclopedia of Mexico] p. 147, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The organization arose after the [[anti-clerical]] provisions of the [[Political Constitution of the United Mexican States|1917 Mexican Constitution]] were strictly enforced by the fiercely [[anti-Catholic]] President [[Plutarco Calles]] and after he enacted further draconian provisions in the [[Calles Law]].&lt;ref&gt;Werner, Michael S., [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qxp-GWiDPioC&amp;pg Concise encyclopedia of Mexico] p. 147, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The LNDLR, along with the Catholic hierarchy, initially advocated peaceful resistance to the Calles Laws including a boycott of tax payment and nonessential goods and a petition drive to rescind the offending constitutional provisions. When the Church failed to obtain a compromise from Calles, the Mexican hierarchy ordered the priests to go on strike beginning July 31, 1926, the day the Calles Law was to go into effect.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, Michael S., [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qxp-GWiDPioC&amp;pg Concise encyclopedia of Mexico] p. 147, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the clerical strike began on July 31, 1926, sporadic popular uprisings began and beginning in September 1926 the LNDLR began to discuss revolt, but they maintained the policy of boycott.&lt;ref&gt;Purnell, "Cristero Rebellion" p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; As the popular uprisings continued, especially in [[Jalisco]] and [[Colima]], despite the lack of formal support from the bishops, the LNDLR advocated on January 1, 1927, open rebellion to overthrow the regime and institute a new constitution with guarantees of religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Purnell, "Cristero Rebellion", p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the LNDLR served the purpose of giving the rebelling peasants organizational structure and military guidance, the onset, development and character of the war were more rooted in grass roots circumstance and groups.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, Michael S., [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qxp-GWiDPioC&amp;pg Concise encyclopedia of Mexico] p. 148, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; At first the rebellion was only able to sustain suppression in a half dozen western states where there was intense popular support and the organizational aid of local groups, the Popular Union (UP), initially spearheaded by [[Anacleto González Flores]] and the covert U, with cells dispersed throughout Jalisco and Michoacan.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, Michael S., [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qxp-GWiDPioC&amp;pg Concise encyclopedia of Mexico] p. 148, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, the LNDLR reorganized the rebellion in the west and, in August 1928, gave the rebellion its first military leader, the well experienced soldier who had fought in the Federal Army under [[Huerta]], but anticlerical and mercenary, General [[Enrique Gorostieta]], who was a 33rd degree [[Anticlericalism and Freemasonry|Mason]].&lt;ref&gt;Tuck, Jim, [http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/mexico/gorostieta.htm The Anti-clerical Who Led a Catholic Rebellion], Latin American Studies&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Werner, Michael S., [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qxp-GWiDPioC&amp;pg Concise encyclopedia of Mexico] p. 148, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The Cristeros began to engage in large scale military assaults.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, Michael S., [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qxp-GWiDPioC&amp;pg Concise encyclopedia of Mexico] p. 148, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The LNDLR were excluded from any participation in the peace negotiations between the Mexican State and the Church. They rejected the argument of the Archbishop of Mexico, Pascual Díaz, "that the Cristeros were doomed to failure because they lacked the two critical elements: adequate military resources and the diplomatic support of the United States government.&lt;ref&gt;Espinosa, ''Jesuit Student Groups'', p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Alberto María Carreño, who was close to the archbishop of Mexico, "questioned the morality of continuing a war that could not be won."&lt;ref&gt;Espinosa, ''Jesuit Student Groups'', pp. 154-55, n. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

After intense and lengthy negotiations by the U.S. ambassador [[Dwight W. Morrow]], an accord (''Arreglos'') acceptable to both Calles and the Catholic hierarchy was reached and the bishops ordered the LNDLR to cease military and political activities and the Cristeros to lay down their weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Purnell, "Cristero Rebellion", p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of Cristeros continued fighting, in what some have called "La Segunda", that is the second Cristiada, but they did so without the support of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Purnell, "Cristero Rebellion," p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt; The LNDLR's criticisms of the episcopal hierarchy's signing on to the Arreglos were blunted given the Vatican's support of the diplomatic accord, but also because [[Catholic Action]], a new lay group firmly under the hierarchy's control, was used to rein in radicalized Catholic organizations following the Arreglos.&lt;ref&gt;Espinosa, ''Jesuit Student Groups'', p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==China Pakistan Economic Corridor==
National Youth Organisation NYO has played a central role in raising the issue of China Pakistan Economic Corridor on all forums, rallies have been taken out throughout Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan against the change in route that was to pass through Dera Ismail Khan, Zhob and Quetta. National Youth Organization called first ever All Parties Conference on the issue on 17 February 2015 with the approval from parent party [[Awami National Party]] in Islamabad, which was participated by major political leaders including Party President [[Asfandyar Wali Khan]], Opposition Leader [[Syed Khursheed Shah]], [[Shah Mehmood Qureshi]] Vice Chairman of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf, [[Maulana Atta-ur-Rehman]] and [[Maulana Sherani]] of JUI-F, [[Hasil Bizenjo]] President [[Balochistan National Party (Mengal)|National Party]], [[Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao]] Chairman [[Qaumi Wattan Party]]. The All Parties Conference was chaired by Central President of National Youth Organization Khushal Khan Khattak, a presentation on the subject was delivered by its Senior Vice President and Chair of Research and Action Committee China Pakistan Economic Corridor [[Sulaiman Mandanr]]. The All Parties Conference acted as a launchpad for the movement against change in route. It was followed by protests, rallies and public gatherings in different cities of the country. The [[Awami National Party]] Balochistan Chapter along with National Youth Organization Balochistan Chapter organized a large public gathering in Quetta followed by a shutter down strike and another All Parties Conference. This pressurized the Federal Government to call an All Parties Conference in which all participating parties agreed on building of western route on priority. While the issue is still being discussed in-sufficient funds allocated to the western route has raised concerns over miscommitment by the Federal Government and Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]]. [[Awami National Party]] Parliamentary leader in the Senate with help of National Youth Organisation research committee prepared proposals for amendment in the proposed budget and while chairing the [[Senate of Pakistan]] Finance Committee rejected the allocations of funds for Western Corridor and asked the Federal Government to allocate at least 100 billion for the route. The Federal Government has held talks with [[Awami National Party]] leadership which were also participated by National Youth Organization Central Leadership before the APC and after the pre-budget announcement of PSDP. National Youth Organisation continues to play an important role on the issue.

'''Operation Serenata de Amor''' is an [[artificial intelligence]] project to analyze public spending in Brazil. The project has been funded by a recurrent financing campaign since [[Independence Day (Brazil)|September 7]], 2016, and came in the wake of major scandals of misappropriation of public funds in Brazil, such as the [[Mensalão scandal]] and what was revealed in the [[Operation Car Wash]] investigations. 

The analysis began with data from the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]] and then expanded to other types of budget and other instances of government, such as the [[Federal Senate]]. The project is built through collaboration on [[GitHub]] and using a public group with more than 600 participants on [[Telegram (messaging service)|Telegram]].

The name "Serenata de Amor," which means "serenade of love," was taken from a popular cashew cream bonbon produced by [[Garoto|Chocolates Garoto]] in Brazil.

==Modules==
Throughout the development of the project new modules have been developed in addition to the main repository:
* The [https://github.com/datasciencebr/serenata-de-amor/ main repository, serenata-de-amor], serves as the starting point for investigative work.
* [https://github.com/datasciencebr/rosie Rosie] is the robot programmed to identify public funds expenses with discrepancies, starting with CEAP (Quota for Exercise of Parliamentary Activity); it analyzes each of the reimbursements requested by the deputies and senators, indicating the reasons that lead it to believe they are suspicious.
* From Rosie was born [https://github.com/okfn-brasil/whistleblower whistleblower], which tweets under the name of @RosieDaSerenata, distributing the results found on social media.
* [https://jarbas.serenatadeamor.org/ Jarbas] ([https://github.com/okfn-brasil/jarbas Github repository]) is a data visualization tool which shows a complete list of reimbursements made available by the Chamber of Deputies and mined by Rosie.
* [https://github.com/datasciencebr/serenata-toolbox Toolbox] is a [[Python (programming language)|Python]] installable package to support the development of Serenata de Amor and Rosie.

==History==
Operation Serenata de Amor is an artificial intelligence project for the analysis of public expenditures. It was conceived in March 2016 by data scientist Irio Musskopf, sociologist Eduardo Cuducos and entrepreneur Felipe Cabral. The project was financed collectively in the Catarse platform, where it reached 131% of the collection goal &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.catarse.me/serenata|title=Operação Serenata de Amor|access-date=2017-09-07|work=Catarse}}&lt;/ref&gt; paying 3 months of project development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/data-science-brigade/a-%C3%BAltima-serenata-c538f145c2f3|title=A Última Serenata|date=2017-02-01|access-date=2017-09-07|work=Data Science Brigade}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2017/01/1852180-jovens-criam-robo-que-monitora-despesas-de-deputados-federais.shtml Jovens criam robô que monitora despesas de deputados federais]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/sistema-que-fiscaliza-gastos-de-deputados-gera-680-denuncias-na-camara.ghtml Sistema que fiscaliza gastos de deputados gera 680 denúncias na Câmara]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tecmundo.com.br/software/113732-jovens-criaram-bot-capaz-monitorar-despesas-deputados-federais.htm Jovens criaram bot capaz de monitorar despesas de deputados federais]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.correiodobrasil.com.br/robo-com-nome-de-bombom-promete-recuperar-r-1-bilhao-por-mes-da-corrupcao/ Robô com nome de bombom promete recuperar R$ 1 bilhão por mês da corrupção]&lt;/ref&gt; Ana Schwendler, also a data scientist; Pedro Vilanova "Tonny", data journalist; Bruno Pazzim, software engineer; Filipe Linhares, a frontend engineer, Leandro Devegili, an entrepreneur and André Pinho took the first steps towards constructing the platform, such as collecting and structuring the first datasets.

Jessica Temporal, data scientist and [[Yasodara Córdova]] "Yaso", researcher; Tatiana Balachova "Russa", UX designer; joined the project after the financing took place.

The members created a [https://apoia.se/serenata recurring financing campaign], expanding the analysis of public spending to the Federal Senate. Donors make monthly payments ranging from 5 BRL to 200 BRL to maintain group activities. The monthly amount collected is around 10,000 BRL.

In January 2017, concluding the period financed by the initial campaign, the group carried out an investigation into the suspicious activities found by the data analysis system. 629 complaints were made to the Ombudsman's Office of the Chamber of Deputies, questioning expenses of 216 federal deputies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/data-science-brigade/a-%C3%BAltima-serenata-c538f145c2f3|title=A Última Serenata|date=2017-02-01|access-date=2017-09-07|work=Data Science Brigade}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Facebook project page has more than 25,000 followers, and users frequently cite the operation as a benchmark in transparency in the Brazilian government. One of the examples of results obtained by the operation is the case of the Deputy who had to return about 700 BRL to the House &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Após ser flagrado por app, deputado devolve à Câmara R$ 727 por 13 refeições no mesmo dia|url=https://g1.globo.com/distrito-federal/noticia/apos-ser-flagrado-por-app-deputado-devolve-a-camara-r-727-por-13-refeicoes-no-mesmo-dia.ghtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; after his expenses were analyzed by the platform.

The '''Party of the Cuban People – Orthodox''' ({{lang-es|Partido del Pueblo Cubano – Ortodoxos}}, PPC-O), commonly called '''Orthodox Party''' ({{lang-es|Partido Ortodoxo}}), was a [[Cuba]]n [[left-wing populism|left-wing populist]] [[political party]]. It was founded in 1947 by [[Eduardo Chibás]] in response to [[government corruption]] and lack of reform. Its primary aims were the establishment of a distinct [[national identity]], economic independence and the implementation of social reforms.

==History==
In the [[Cuban general election, 1948|1948 general elections]] Chibás came third in the presidential election, whilst the party won four seats in the House of Representatives. In the [[Cuban parliamentary election, 1950|1950 mid-term elections]] they won nine. Chibás' cousin, [[Roberto Agramonte]], was the favorite to win the 1952 election (for the Ortodoxos) but [[Fulgencio Batista]] staged a coup before the winner was determined.

[[Fidel Castro]] was an active member of the Orthodox Party in the late 1940s and early 1950s. He intended to run as an Orthodox Party candidate for the Cuban parliament prior to the coup by  Batista.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The United States and the Origins of the Cuban Revolution|author=Jules Robert Benjamin|year=1990|publisher=Princeton University Press|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=tjXDKPVUoy0C&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=%22Partido+Ortodoxo%22&lt;!--|ISBN=0691025363 --&gt;|isbn=978-0-691-02536-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soc.duke.edu/~nvaldes/Cuba/fidel.htm Castro biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317091509/http://www.soc.duke.edu/~nvaldes/Cuba/fidel.htm |date=2007-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology and platform==
The Orthodox Party was a catch-all party, open to the all that wanted join to it. Like a [[populist]] party, there weren't internal factions or organizations, but only the support to the [[Eduardo Chibás]]' goals and ideals. With this opening, the party's composition were miscellaneous:
*Former [[Partido Auténtico|PRC-A]]: radical [[nationalist]]s, supporting [[anti-imperialism]] and revolutionary goals
*Former [[Popular Socialist Party (Cuba)|PSP]]: young [[socialist]]s and [[communist]] soldiers, disappointed by their party's misconduct
*Former [[Liberal Party of Cuba|PLC]]: [[Petite bourgeoisie|Small bourgeoises]], with [[conservative]] pro-business views

The political program reflect PPC-O's catch-all nature, claiming:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Partido Ortodoxo|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=Bt8OAAAAYAAJ|title=Doctrina del Partido Ortodoxo}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Direct democracy]]
* [[Free market]] and respect of the [[private ownership]]
* [[Progressivism]]
* [[Anti-imperialism]] (mainly [[anti-Americanism]]) and [[nationalism]]
* [[Agrarianism]]: Abolition of [[latifondium]] and [[monoculture]], agricultural diversification
* Fair payments and [[economic redistribution]]
* [[Nationalization]] of [[railway]]s, [[power plant]]s, [[telephononic]] communications, etc.
* Fight against [[political corruption]], [[embezzlement]] and [[criminal]]s
* [[Corporatism]] and [[labor rights]].

{{Federal Bureau of Investigation}}
'''Project Megiddo''' was a report researched and written by the [[United States]]' [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] under [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|Director]] [[Louis Freeh]]. Released on October 20, 1999, the report named followers of [[white supremacy]], [[Christian Identity]], the [[Militia movement (United States)|militia movement]], [[Black Hebrew Israelites]], and [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] [[cult]]s as potential [[Terrorism|terrorists]] who might become violent in reaction to the new [[millennium]].

The report began:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For over four thousand years, MEGIDDO, a hill in northern [[Israel]], has been the site of many battles.  Ancient cities were established there to serve as a fortress on the [[Jezreel Valley|plain of Jezreel]] to guard a mountain pass.  As Megiddo was built and rebuilt, one city upon the other, a mound or hill was formed.  The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word "[[Armageddon]]" means "hill of Megiddo."  In [[English language|English]], the word has come to represent battle itself.  The [[Book of Revelation|last book]] in the [[New Testament]] of the [[Bible]] designates Armageddon as the assembly point in the apocalyptic setting of [[God]]'s final and conclusive battle against evil.  The name "Megiddo" is an apt title for a project that analyzes those who believe the year 2000 will usher in the end of the world and who are willing to perpetrate acts of violence to bring that end about.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The report's purpose was to warn other domestic [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]] to "the potential for extremist criminal activity in the United States by individuals or domestic groups who attach special significance to the year 2000." The report also stated: "The threat posed by extremists as a result of [[Year 2000 problem|perceived events associated with the Year 2000]] is very real. The volatile mix of apocalyptic religious and [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|(New World Order)]] [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] may produce violent acts aimed a precipitating the [[Ultimate fate of the universe|end of the world]] as prophesied in the Bible."

The groups named as "potentially violent" were "biblically-driven cults," "militias, adherents of racist belief systems such as [[Christian Identity]] and [[Wotanism]], and other radical domestic extremists."  The report ends by discussing the possibility of terrorist attacks in the city of [[Jerusalem]], saying, "The extreme terrorist fringes of [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], and [[Islam]] are all present in the United States.  Thus, millennial violence in Jerusalem could conceivably lead to violence in the United States as well."

''[[Insight on the News]]'' commented, "In a [[polemic]] presented as a threat report, the FBI has targeted religious groups and [[Right-wing politics|rightwing]] eccentrics as potential terrorists likely to [[Going postal|go postal]] as the new millennium arrives...Even at the height of the [[Cold War]] during the 1970s and 1980s the FBI was not allowed to pursue openly declared [[revolutionary]] [[Marxism|Marxists]] in this way, being required by the courts to show cause by establishing an actual attempt to commit illegal acts."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1571/is_48_15/ai_58361253 FBI Targets `Right Wing' - Project Megiddo lists possible threats in the millenium&lt;!--PLEASE NOTE that "Millenium" is deliberately spelled incorrectly here, reflecting the mistake on the external page.--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] cited Project Megiddo in its defense of filmmaker [[Zieper v. Metzinger|Mike Zieper]], whose film about a military takeover of [[Times Square]] was removed from the [[Internet]] due to FBI pressure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aclu-nj.org/legal/closedcasearchive/mikeziepervashcroft.htm Mike Zieper v. Ashcroft]&lt;/ref&gt; On November 10, 1999, the [[International Asatru-Odinic Alliance]] accused the FBI of violating its [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights to [[freedom of religion]], [[free speech]], and [[Freedom of assembly|peaceful assembly]]. The reason given for this accusation was the propagation of "numerous false statements and innuendos" about [[Odinism]] in the Project Megiddo report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesnur.org/testi/FBI_007.htm IAOA news release]&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 6, 2000, [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] [[Janet Reno]] said in response to a question at a [[news conference]] asking why the terrorist acts predicted in the report did not happen:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/archive/ag/speeches/2000/1600avail.htm WEEKLY MEDIA BRIEFING WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL JANET RENO, JANUARY 6, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think that speculation as to why it didn't -- it -- the nice answer would be that there was no threat. What we must all do, I think, is make sure that we pursue situations, consistent with the law, consistent with due process; that we take reasonable precautions; that we -- when we have specific information that can inform the American people, that we advise them; and that America proceed in the way it has always proceeded, that it won't back down, that it won't be intimidated, that it will take reasonable precautions, and that we will see our laws honored.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Pyromania''' is an [[impulse control disorder]]&lt;ref name=dsm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://behavenet.com/pyromania |title=Pyromania &amp;#124; BehaveNet |publisher=behavenet.com |accessdate=27 February 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150303054418/http://behavenet.com/pyromania |archivedate=3 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which individuals repeatedly fail to resist impulses to deliberately start fires,&lt;ref name = dsm /&gt; in order to relieve tension or for instant gratification. The term pyromania comes from the Greek word πῦρ (''pyr'', fire). Pyromania is distinct from [[arson]], the deliberate setting of fires for personal, monetary or political gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2RzFWRIAsPAC&amp;pg=PA793|title=The American Psychiatric Publishing Textbook of Psychiatry|author=Robert E. Hales|year=2008 |editor1=Stuart C. Yudofsky|editor2=Glen O. Gabbard|publisher=American Psychiatric Pub|isbn=9781585622573|page=793|section=Impulse Disorders Not Elsewhere Classified}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pyromaniacs start fires to induce euphoria, {{citation needed span |date=November 2018 |and often fixate on institutions of fire control like fire houses and firemen.}}{{dubious |date=November 2018}} Pyromania is a type of impulse control disorder, along with [[kleptomania]], [[intermittent explosive disorder]] and others.

==Signs and symptoms==
There are specific symptoms that separate pyromaniacs from those who start fires for criminal purposes or due to emotional motivations not specifically related to fire. Someone suffering from this disorder deliberately and purposely sets fires on more than one occasion, and before the act of lighting the fire the person usually experiences tension and an emotional buildup. When around fires, a person suffering from pyromania gains intense interest or fascination and may also experience pleasure, gratification or relief {{harv|Frey|2001}}. Another long term contributor often linked with pyromania is the buildup of [[Chronic stress|stress]]. When studying the lifestyle of someone with pyromania, a buildup of stress and emotion is often evident and this is seen in teens' attitudes towards friends and family {{harv|Gale|1998}}. At times it is difficult to distinguish the difference between pyromania and experimentation in childhood because both involve pleasure from the fire.&lt;ref name="FirstFrances2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael B. First |author2=Allen J. Frances |author3=Harold Alan Pincus |title=Dsm-iv Tr Guidebook |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hU_L1KUsNfIC&amp;pg=PA337 |accessdate=24 February 2013 |year=2004 |publisher=American Psychiatric Pub |isbn=978-1-58562-068-5 |page=337 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925101242/http://books.google.com/books?id=hU_L1KUsNfIC&amp;pg=PA337 |archivedate=25 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Most studied cases of pyromania occur in children and teenagers {{harv|Gale|1998}}. There is a range of causes, but an understanding of the different motives and actions of fire setters can provide a platform for prevention. Common causes of pyromania can be broken down into two main groups: individual and environmental. This includes the complex understanding of factors such as individual temperament, parental psychopathology, and possible neurochemical predispositions.&lt;ref name="psycnet.apa.org"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1992-27659-001 |title=Pyromania and Firesetting Behaviors |first=Stephen M |last=Soltys |date=1 February 1992 |publisher= |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=79–83 |doi=10.3928/0048-5713-19920201-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509014334/http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1992-27659-001 |archivedate=9 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many studies have shown that patients with pyromanias were in households without a father figure present.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Kaplan &amp; Sadock's Concise Textbook of Clinical Psychiatry|author1=Sadock, B.J.|author2=Sadock, V.A.|date=2008|publisher=Wolters Kluwer/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=9780781787468|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ubG51n2NgfwC|page=365|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Individual ===
Individual factors that can lead to pyromania mainly deal with personal issues in someone's life. This category includes adolescents who have committed crimes in the past. For example, 19% of adolescents suffering from pyromania have been charged with [[vandalism]] and 18% are non-violent [[Sex and the law|sexual offenders]]. Other causes may include the seeking of attention from authorities or parents and resolving social issues such as [[bullying]] or [[loneliness|lack of friends or siblings]]. Another cause may be that the patient is subconsciously seeking [[revenge]] for something that has occurred in the past. Individuals with pyromania have also been prominent in having antisocial traits. These include truancy, running away from home, and delinquency. Child and adolescent cases are usually associated with ADHD or adjustment disorders.

=== Environmental ===
Environmental factors that may lead to pyromania include an event that the patient has experienced in the environment they live in. Environmental factors include [[neglect]] from parents and physical or [[sexual abuse]] in earlier life. Other causes include early experiences of watching adults or teenagers using fire inappropriately and lighting fires as a stress reliever {{harv|Frey|2001}}.

==Prevention==
Pyromania is best prevented by parents taking the time to educate their children on fire safety and the dangers of fires. Parents should also keep all fire lighting devices out of reach of children and any teenagers to reduce the risk of their starting any fires {{harv|Australian Brushfire Arson Bulletin|2005}}.

==Treatment and prognosis==
The appropriate treatment for pyromania varies with the age of the patient and the seriousness of the condition. For children and adolescents treatment usually is [[cognitive therapy|cognitive behavioral therapy]] sessions in which the patient’s situation is diagnosed to find out what may have caused this impulsive behavior. Once the situation is diagnosed, repeated therapy sessions usually help continue to a recovery {{harv|Frey|2001}}. Other important steps must be taken as well with the interventions and the cause of the impulse behavior. Some other treatments measures include parenting training, over-correction/satiation/negative practice with corrective consequences, behavior contracting/token reinforcement, special problem-solving skills training, relaxation training, covert sensitization, [[fire safety]] and prevention education, individual and family therapy, and medication.&lt;ref name="psycnet.apa.org"/&gt; The prognosis for recovery in adolescents and children who suffer from pyromania depends on the environmental or individual factors in play, but is generally positive. Pyromania is generally harder to treat in adults, often due to lack of cooperation by the patient. Treatment usually consists of  more medication to prevent stress or emotional outbursts {{harv|Oliver}} in addition to long-term [[psychotherapy]] {{harv|Frey|2001}}. In adults, however, the recovery rate is generally poor and if an adult does recover it usually takes a longer period of time {{harv|Frey|2001}}.

==History==
Pyromania was thought in the 1800s to be a concept involved with [[moral insanity]] and [[moral treatment]], but had not been categorized under impulse control disorders. Pyromania is one of the four recognized types of [[arson]], alongside burning for profit, to cover up an act of crime and for revenge. Pyromania is the second most common type of arson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1967-12122-001 |title=ARSON: WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO PYROMANIA. |date=1 January 1967 |publisher= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509015320/http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1967-12122-001 |archivedate=9 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Common [[synonym]]s for pyromaniacs in colloquial English include firebug (US) and fire raiser (UK), but these also refer to arsonists. Pyromania is a rare disorder with an incidence of less than one percent in most studies; also, pyromaniacs hold a very small proportion of psychiatric hospital admissions {{harv|The Arsonist's Mind|2006}}. Pyromania can occur in children as young as age three, though such cases are rare. Only a small percentage{{Quantify|date=June 2011}} of children and teenagers arrested for arson are [[child pyromania]]cs. A preponderance of the individuals are male;&lt;ref&gt;Barker AF (1994) Arson: A Review of the Psychiatric Literature. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; one source states that ninety percent of those diagnosed with pyromania are male.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gale|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on a survey of 9,282 Americans using the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'', 4th edition, impulse-control problems such as gambling, pyromania and compulsive shopping collectively affect 9% of the population {{harv|Alspach|2005}}. A 1979 study by the [[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]] found that only 14% of fires were started by pyromaniacs and others with mental illness {{harv|Smith|1999}}. A 1951 study by Lewis and Yarnell, one of the largest epidemiological studies conducted, found that 39% of those who had intentionally set fires had been diagnosed with pyromania.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23719">[[File:Spartakiade.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Poster of the 2nd International Spartakiad of the Sportintern, held in Berlin in the Summer of 1931.]]
The '''International Association of Red Sports and Gymnastics Associations''', commonly known as '''Red Sport International (RSI)''' or '''Sportintern''' was a [[Comintern]]-supported international sports organization established in July 1921. The RSI was established in an effort to form a rival organization to already existing [[bourgeoisie|"bourgeois"]] and [[social democracy|social democratic]] international sporting groups. The RSI was part of a [[physical culture]] movement in [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Russia]] linked to the physical training of young people prior to their enlistment in the military. The RSI held 3 summer games and 1 winter games called "[[Spartakiad]]" in competition with the [[Olympic games]] of the [[International Olympic Committee]] before being dissolved in 1937.

==Organizational history==

===Background===

The notion of a separate [[working class]] national athletic federation emerged first in Germany during the decade of the 1890s, when a [[Workers Gymnastics Association]] was established by activists in the [[socialism|socialist]] movement in opposition to the [[nationalism|nationalist]] [[German Gymnastics Society]] ''(Turnen).''&lt;ref name=RK107&gt;James Riordan and Arnd Krüger, ''The International Politics of Sport in the Twentieth Century.'' London: Routledge, 1999; pg. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Other "proletarian" sports organizations emerged soon thereafter in that country, including the Solidarity Worker Cycling Club, the Friends of Nature Rambling Association, the Worker Swimming Association, the Free Sailing Association, and the [[Worker Track and Field Athletics Association]], among others.&lt;ref name=RK107 /&gt; By the time of [[World War I]], the German proletarian sports movement included more than 350,000 participants.&lt;ref name=RK107 /&gt;

Following the bloodbath of World War I, the German workers' sports movement began to reemerge, with a new competitive orientation beginning to take the place of individualistic club activities.&lt;ref name=RK107 /&gt; The international [[social democracy|social democratic]] movement also experienced a rebirth after its connections had been severed by war. In 1920 the social democrats established an International Association for Sports and Physical Culture, echoing its efforts in the pre-war period.&lt;ref name=RK107 /&gt; This organization was rechristened as the [[Socialist Workers' Sport International]] (SWSI) in 1925.&lt;ref name=RK107 /&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] the international socialist movement divided into two antagonistic camps, socialist and [[communism|communist]] — a division exacerbated with the establishment of the [[Communist International]] (Comintern) in 1919. Parallel political organizations sprung up in every country and a state of bitter enmity prevailed.

===Establishment===
[[File:Podvoisky 1903.jpg|thumb|right|Nikolai Podvoisky, first head of the Red Sports International, as he appeared as a young man.]]
The idea of a rival Red Sport International (RSI) was the inspiration of [[Nikolai Podvoisky]], who at the [[2nd World Congress of the Comintern]] in the summer of 1920 discussed with a number of delegates from around the world the idea of establishing an organization to coordinate the physical training of youth.&lt;ref name=Carr8-957&gt;E.H. Carr, ''A History of Soviet Russia: Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926: Volume 3, Part 2.'' London: Macmillan, 1964; pg. 957.&lt;/ref&gt; Podvoisky, a military specialist in charge of Soviet Russia's military training organization, believed systematic physical training to be beneficial for the needs of the [[Red Army]] for healthy and fit youth in its ranks.&lt;ref name=Carr8-957 /&gt; An international sports organization was also seen as a potential ideological counterweight to the [[Olympic games]] of the "[[bourgeois]]" [[International Olympic Committee]] as well as the activities of the rival International Association for Sports and Physical Culture of the socialists.&lt;ref name=Carr8-958&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 958.&lt;/ref&gt;

Podvoisky gathered interested delegates who were already in Moscow for the Comintern Congress and the group constituted itself a founding conference for an international sports organization.&lt;ref name=Carr8-957 /&gt; It is worthy of emphasis that the Comintern did not itself directly found the Red Sport International, the group being established through independent initiative and the Comintern being preoccupied with other affairs.&lt;ref&gt;André Gounot, [http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH2001/JSH2801/JSH2801d.pdf "Sport or Political Organization? Structures and Characteristics of the Red Sport International, 1921-1937,"] ''Journal of Sport History,'' vol. 28, no. 1 (Spring 2001), pg. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The group issued a public manifesto declaring the establishment of a Red Sport International and elected a governing Executive Committee, consisting of representatives from Soviet Russia, Germany, [[Czechoslovakia]], France, Sweden, Italy, and [[Alsace-Lorraine]].&lt;ref name=Carr8-957 /&gt; Podvoisky was elected President of the new organization.&lt;ref name=Carr8-957 /&gt;

The establishment of an international sports organization in Soviet Russia in 1921 was not without its utopian elements, since no official Soviet sport organizations existed in famine stricken post-civil war Soviet Russia at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pp. 957-958.&lt;/ref&gt; Germany, on the other hand, had a well-developed workers' sport movement at this time.&lt;ref name=Carr8-958 /&gt; Consequently, Sportintern from its outset maintained a strong German flavor and it was there in the city of [[Berlin]] that the 2nd Conference of the organization was held in July 1922.&lt;ref name=Carr8-958 /&gt; The only national "proletarian" sports organization to join the German group at that early date was the [[Czechoslovak Federation of Workers' Gymnastic Leagues]], said to represent 100,000 athletes.&lt;ref name=Carr8-958 /&gt;

The Comintern moved closer to the fledgling Sportintern in November 1922 when, in conjunction with the [[4th World Congress of the Comintern|4th World Congress]], the governing [[Executive Committee of the Communist International]] decided to name a representative to the "independent" proletarian sport organization.&lt;ref name=Carr8-958 /&gt; The [[Communist International of Youth]] (KIM) did not take action until the meeting of its governing Bureau in Moscow in July 1923, when it issued a general recommendation of support for the Sportintern and the national sports organizations affiliated to it as a useful "proletarian class instrument."&lt;ref name=Carr8-960&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 960.&lt;/ref&gt; It did not, however, delve into the contentious issue of in what manner and to what extent these two international bodies should be related.&lt;ref name=Carr8-960 /&gt;

The governing Executive Committee of Sportintern met in Moscow in February 1923 and decided to establish a satellite bureau of the organization in Berlin, with a view to increasing participation among Western European workers' sports organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pp. 960-961.&lt;/ref&gt; The maneuver proved successful in helping to build the organization, triggering a split of the French Workers Sports Federation later that year and the affiliation of 80% of its membership with the Red Sport International.&lt;ref name=Carr8-961&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 961.&lt;/ref&gt; The RSI's increased place in the public eye motivated the governing body of the rival international socialist sports authority, meeting in [[Zurich]] in August 1923, to discuss issuing an invitation to Sportintern to help organize a joint "Workers' Olympiad" — a proposal which was narrowly defeated, despite indications that a majority of individual members of the socialist organization favored joint participation.&lt;ref name=Carr8-961 /&gt;

===End of autonomy===

In October 1924 the Red Sport International held its 3rd Congress in Moscow.&lt;ref name=Carr8-963&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 963.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time the organization decided to enlarge its governing Executive Committee to include four members of the Executive Committee of the Communist International of Youth — an organization which saw the national affiliates of Sportintern as comprised overwhelmingly of young workers and sought to insert its influence in the organization.&lt;ref name=Carr8-963 /&gt; As the membership of Sportintern was formally "open to all proletarian elements which recognize the class struggle" it was not an explicitly communist organization, a situation which the KIM saw as a significant shortcoming.&lt;ref name=Carr8-963 /&gt;

The RSI was a large and growing organization in this interval, with some 2 million affiliated members in the Soviet Union, joined by others sections in Germany, Czechoslovakia, France, Norway, Italy, Finland, Switzerland, the United States, [[Estonia]], Bulgaria, and [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pp. 963-964.&lt;/ref&gt; As the size of the organization grew, so, too, did pressure to bring the organization's [[ideology|ideological]] character under tighter centralized Communist Party control.

Nikolai Podvoisky was himself a voice for such an insertion of such ideological hegemony, declaring in a lengthy speech to the [[5th Enlarged Plenum of the Comintern]], held in the spring of 1925, that Sportintern should henceforth adopt as its motto:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Convert sport and gymnastics into a weapon of the class revolutionary struggle, concentrate the attention of workers and peasants on sport and gymnastics as one of the best instruments, methods, and weapons for their class organization and struggle."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Carr, Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 963.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the same time the international communist movement moved to further politicize the RSI, efforts were made to make political hay over the refusal of the Socialist Workers' Sport International to conduct joint activities, such as its decision to bar the Red Sport International from participation at the July 1925 "Workers' Olympiad" held in Frankfurt under its auspices.&lt;ref name=Carr8-965&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 965.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in this period, 1924 to 1925, that the Red Sport International effectively became an auxiliary of the Communist International.&lt;ref&gt;Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; This control was effected by the subordinate youth section of the Comintern, the Communist International of Youth, although the Comintern reserved for itself ultimate authority to decide issues of great importance.&lt;ref name=Gounot27&gt;Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Comintern was itself in the process of being absorbed as an instrument of Soviet foreign policy in this interval, the RSI likewise gradually lost its ability to function independently as an international entity.&lt;ref name=Gounot27 /&gt;

In the words of French sports historian André Gounot:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...The RSI's dependence on the Comintern was accompanied, almost inevitably, by the Soviet section's dominance within the RSI. The interests of the Soviet Union and Soviet sport were decisive factors in the RSI's decisions and actions — even if, as was frequently the case, they were incompatible with those of European worker sport."&lt;ref name=Gounot27 /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The last International Congress of the Red Sport International came in 1928 and was marked by no serious discussion of contemporary sporting issues.&lt;ref name=Gounot28&gt;Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead the 1928 gathering consisted of a mechanical attempt to apply the Comintern's ultra-radical [[Third Period]] slogan of "Class versus Class" and its corollary theory of [[social fascism]] to world sport — splitting the fissure between the two camps of the European workers' sport movement wider than ever.&lt;ref name=Gounot28 /&gt;

===Social composition===

Membership of the various national sections of the Red Sport International was by no means monolithic. According to the RSI's own study of the issue, members of the organizations were predominantly male, but hailed from a variety of communist, socialist, [[syndicalism|syndicalist]], and [[anarchism|anarchist]] tendencies, including many of whom who were members of no party.&lt;ref name=IAS&gt;''Internationaler Arbeitersport: Zeitschrift für Fragen der internationalen revolutionären Arbeitersportbewegung.'' Aug. 1931, pg. 303. Quoted in Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Although many of these were of the working class, also included were white collar employees, students, and government workers.&lt;ref name=IAS /&gt; Membership records of the French section, for example, indicate that approximately 80% of participants were from the working class, with the remaining 20% members of other social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 38, fn. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

No details exist for the exact Communist Party membership of any national section of the RSI, although in the considered opinion of a leading historian on the topic, "it is safe to assume that this group represented a minority of the whole membership of each section."&lt;ref name=Gounot29&gt;Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The Czechoslovakian federation, thought to include the largest Communist Party contingent from outside the USSR, is believed to have included something in the range of 20 to 30% who were members of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref name=Gounot29 /&gt;

The fact that members of other parties or no parties participated in the national sections of the Red Sport International is testimony to the limited impact that RSI programmatic rhetoric had upon grassroots participants.&lt;ref name=Gounot29 /&gt; It was rather the fun and excitement of training and competition that bound together local groups and their national units more than ideological proclivities.&lt;ref name=Gounot29 /&gt; The difference in perception of the organization between its rank-and-file participants and the Moscow dominated leadership of the organization has led one scholar to conclude that the RSI was a "split organization, living in two universes," bureaucratic in political discourse but remaining well within the less intense social democratic workers' sports tradition at the individual club level.&lt;ref name=Gounot35&gt;Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; In this view politics was merely a piece of a broader participatory sports movement.&lt;ref name=Gounot35 /&gt;

===International competitions===

The international workers' sports organizations of the socialist and communist movements did not necessarily object to some of the most noble goals of the International Olympic Committee (IOC),&lt;ref name=RK109&gt;Riordan and Krüger, ''The International Politics of Sport in the Twentieth Century,'' pg. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; but they did each share fundamental reservations about the modern Olympic games that were the inspiration of [[Pierre de Coubertin|Baron Pierre de Coubertin]], a hereditary French nobleman.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher R. Hill, ''Olympic Politics: Athens to Atlanta, 1896-1996.'' Manchester, England: Manchester University Press, 1996; pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; First and foremost, the Olympics of the IOC stressed competition between nations — regarded by the radicals as a manifestation of national [[chauvinism]].&lt;ref name=RK109 /&gt; Rather than the accentuation of national rivalry and patriotic feeling, international competition should focus on the actual athletic effort in a setting designed to build the ethic of [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], both the socialists and communists agreed.&lt;ref name=RK109 /&gt;

The IOC games also were based upon rigid entrance standards, while the international festivals of the worker athletic movement instead attempted to build mass participation through pageantry, artistic and cultural activities, and unifying political presentations.&lt;ref name=RK109 /&gt; Moreover, the sort of athletes dominating the IOC games were objectionable to the radicals on the basis of [[social class]], dominated as they were by the privileged children of the rural aristocracy and the bourgeoisie.&lt;ref name=RK109 /&gt; Such international competitions should be open to the participation of less privileged national and social groups, without distinction to race or creed, in the view of the radical sports organizations.&lt;ref name=RK109 /&gt;

Therefore, the Red Sport International and its socialist rival, the organization emerging as the Socialist Workers' Sport International, conducted a series of their own workers' sports festivals in distinction to and competition with the Olympiads of the IOC. Four such events (called Spartakiads in honor of the heroic slave leader, [[Spartacus]]) were sponsored by the RSI. Two of these were held in 1928,  and one each in 1931 and 1937.

While a major national workers' sport festival had already been held in Czechoslovakia in 1921, it was the socialist organization in 1925 that conducted the first pair of Workers' Olympics events — Summer Games in Frankfurt attracting 150,000 spectators and competitors from 19 country, and Winter Games in Schreiberhau (today's [[Szklarska Poręba]], Poland), attended by athletes from 12 countries.&lt;ref name=RK110&gt;Riordan and Krüger, ''The International Politics of Sport in the Twentieth Century,'' pg. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; No national flags or anthems graced the closing or opening ceremonies, replaced instead by universal use of the [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] and singing of "[[The Internationale]]."&lt;ref name=RK110 /&gt; "Soviet and other communist athletes were excluded from these games, however, and there was therefore little actual unity of the workers' sports movement for all the universalist pageantry employed.

From the middle 1930s the political line of the world communist movement changed. The so-called [[Popular Front]] against the threat of [[fascism]] rendered cooperation with socialists and others through unified workers' athletic festivals not only a possibility but the tactical order of the day. Plans were laid for a so-called 3rd Workers' Olympiad to be held in [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], Spain in June 1936, under joint auspices of the RSI and the SWSI. The time and place proved inauspicious, however, coinciding with outbreak of hostilities in the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref name=RK113&gt;Riordan and Krüger, ''The International Politics of Sport in the Twentieth Century,'' pg. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; This forced postponement of the event, which was rescheduled for the next summer in [[Antwerp]], Belgium.&lt;ref name=RK113 /&gt;

The 3rd Workers' Olympiad proved to be less successful than previous endeavors, but it still managed to attract 27,000 participating athletes, and put 50,000 people in the stadium for the final day of competition.&lt;ref name=RK113 /&gt; An estimated 200,000 people turned out for the traditional closing parade through the city.&lt;ref name=RK113 /&gt;

===Dissolution===

With the Soviet Union becoming immersed in the first months of 1937 in a massive and [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] secret police campaign against perceived underground [[espionage|espionage networks]] remembered as the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]], the Red Sport International was summarily dissolved by the Comintern in April of that year.

Women’s Concerns.] Retrieved 14 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Common challenges for all refugee women, regardless of other demographic data, are access to healthcare and physical abuse and instances of [[discrimination]], [[sexual violence]], and [[human trafficking]] are the most common ones.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Indra|first=Doreen|date=1987|title=Gender: a key dimension of the refugee experience|url=|journal=Canada's Journal on Refugees|volume=6|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But even if women don't become victims of such actions, they often face abuse and disregard for their specific needs and experiences, which leads to complex consequences including demoralization, [[stigmatization]], and mental and physical health decay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theirc.org/forgotten-frontline-effects-war-women International Rescue Committee.

==Health==

[[File:Health clinic at the camp, in A Day in the Life of a Refugee (24394123162).jpg|thumb|Health clinic inside of a refugee camp]]
Health issues faced by refugee women range from dehydration and diarrhea, to high fevers and malaria. They also include more broad reaching phenomena, such as [[gender-based violence]] and [[maternal health]]. The leading causes of death to refugee women include [[malnutrition]], diarrhea, respiratory infections, and reproductive complications.&lt;ref name="UNHCR" /&gt; Health concerns of refugee women are influenced by a variety of factors including their physical, mental, and social wellbeing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Health complications and concerns for refugee women are prevalent both during their time as refugees living in transient camps or [[Refugee shelter|shelters]], as well as once they relocate to countries of asylum or [[third country resettlement|resettlement]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   
External factors contributing to the health concerns of refugee women include culturally-reinforced [[gender inequality]], limited mobility, lack of access to healthcare facilities, high population density within the refugee camps, and low levels of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poureslami|first=IM|display-authors=etal|date=September 20, 2004|title=Sociocultural, Environmental, and Health Challenges Facing Women and Children Living Near the Borders Between Afghanistan, Iran, and Pakistan (AIP Region)|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/487825|journal=MedGenMen|volume=6|issue=3|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalhealth.org/images/pdf/events/krause_041806.pdf|title=Women as Refugees: A Health Overview|publisher=Women’s Commission for Refugee Women and Children|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49c3646c1e2.html|title=Women’s Concerns|publisher=UNHCR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reproductive health ===

International humanitarian aid organizations, such as the [[United Nations]], agree that adequate reproductive care must be "safe, effective...[and] affordable.&lt;ref name="UNHCR" /&gt;" According to the United Nations, while universal values in [[human rights]] support the availability of reproductive health care needs of all women, services that conform to adequate standards while respecting cultural differences are rarely provided to refugee women.&lt;ref name="UNHCR"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr|title=Reproductive Health in Refugee Situations: An Interagency Field Manual|publisher=UNHCR|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the lack of satisfactory [[Reproductive health|reproductive health care]] in refugee camps, complications related to child delivery and pregnancy was one of the leading cause of both death and illness among refugee women living in transitory camps in 2010.&lt;ref name="UNHCR" /&gt;

Refugee women who have left humanitarian aid camps and have moved permanently to countries of asylum and resettlement also face reproductive health challenges.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A study published in 2004 by the Journal of Midwifery and Women's Health found that refugee women living in wealthy nations face troubles in accessing appropriate reproductive care due to stereotyping, language barriers, and lack of cultural respect and understanding.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herrel|first=Nathaly|date=July 2005|title=Somali refugee women speak out about their needs for care during pregnancy and delivery|pmid=15236715|journal=Journal of Midwifery and Women's Health|volume=49|pages=345–349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mental Health ===

Refugee women often face a host of [[mental health]] complications in their home countries, in refugee camps, and in countries of [[Population transfer|resettlement]] or [[Right of asylum|asylum]].&lt;ref name="unhcr.org" /&gt; In their native countries, women who have fled as refugees may have been psychosocially or physically abused for a variety of reasons, including [[genocide]]; an attempted shaming of a family, community, or culture; or for being seen as " politically dangerous.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Blue room. Trauma and testimony among refugee women. A psycho-social exploration|last=Agger|first=Inger|publisher=Zed Books|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;" These forms of abuse often lead to exile or fleeing, and have the propensity to cause distress and detrimental harm to the mental health and wellbeing of refugee women.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In refugee camps, the mental health of refugee women is also affected by incidences of discrimination based on gender, sexual and [[domestic violence]], [[Unfree labour|forced labor]], and heavy responsibilities.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cole|first=Ellen|date=October 2008|title=Refugee women and their mental health: Shattered societies, shattered lives|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J015V13N01_01|journal=Women and Therapy|volume=13|pages=1–4|via=Taylor and Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In countries of asylum and resettlement, complications with mental health also prevail due to language and cultural barriers, the [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post traumatic stress]] of fleeing persecution in their home countries, difficulty seeking mental health treatment, and an increased likelihood of facing abuse as compared to host-country nationals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Nutrition ===

[[Malnutrition]] of refugee women manifests in a variety of ways both in refugee camps and in countries of asylum and resettlement.&lt;ref name="unhcr.org" /&gt; Issues of [[food security]], economic and political misunderstanding, and discrimination within refugee camps contribute to the poor nutrition and health of many refugee women.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pottier|first=Johan|date=December 1996|title=Why Aid Agencies Need Better Understanding of the Communities They Assist: The Experience of Food Aid in Rwandan Refugee Camps|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-7717.1996.tb01047.x/full|journal=School of Oriental and African Studies|volume=20|pages=324-227|via=Wiley Online Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of food aid in Rwandan refugee camps, experts found that international aid agencies' lack of consideration and attention to the political, economic, and cultural workings of countries in crises can lead to inadequate and inappropriate food aid, which in turn may result in malnutrition for refugees.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Likewise, studies have shown that despite no legal distinction between male and female refugees, international refugee communities and even aid organizations tend to uphold discrimination based on gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnsson|first=Anders|date=January 1989|title=The International Protection of Women Refugees A Summary of Principal Problems and Issues|url=https://academic.oup.com/ijrl/article-abstract/1/2/221/1602788|journal=International Journal of Refugee Law|volume=1|pages=221–232|via=Oxford Academic}}&lt;/ref&gt; This translates into disproportionate malnutrition for refugee women through lack of priority in food distribution as well as medical attention for nutrition-related issues and lack of reproductive nutritional care.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; 
[[File:South Sudanese refugees being served food. Many of the complain of hunger due to the food rationing by World Food Program. PHOTO BY FELIX WAROM OKELLO.jpg|thumb|South Sudanese refugees being served food. Many of them complain of hunger due to the food rationing by World Food Program]]
Issues of malnutrition persist in countries of asylum and resettlement for refugee women though mechanisms of [[Food security|food insecurity]] and lack of nutritional education.&lt;ref name="unhcr.org" /&gt; A study on Somali refugee women in 2013 found that rates of meat and egg intake were significantly higher in refugee women than comparable populations of host-country national women, while rates of fruit and vegetable intake were significantly lower.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dharod|first=JM|date=January 2013|title=Food insecurity: its relationship to dietary intake and body weight among Somali refugee women in the United States.|pmid=23084983|journal=Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior|volume=45|pages=47–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related study of Cambodian refugee women found that common reasons for poor nutritional intake were living in food insecure, low-income areas, lack of economic means to purchase  nutritious food, and lack of education about nutritious eating in their new country of residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peterman|first=Jerusha Nelson|date=August 2010|title=Relationship between past food deprivation and current dietary practices and weight status among Cambodian refugee women in Lowell, MA.|pmid=20724691|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=100|pages=1930–1937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Labor==
Refugee women are often subjected to forced labor in [[refugee camp]]s through the reinforcement of traditional [[gender role]]s and stereotypes.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Women in refugee camps are often the primary sources of physical labor for water collection and filtration, as well as small gardening and agricultural tasks and food preparation.&lt;ref name="Wallace"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallace|first=Tina|date=1993|title=Refugee women: their perspectives and our responses|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09682869308519965|journal=Gender &amp; Development, special issue: Women and Conflict|publisher=Taylor and Francis|volume=1|issue=2|pages=17–23|doi=10.1080/09682869308519965|postscript=.|ref=harv}} Also as {{Citation|last=Wallace|first=Tina|title=Women and conflict|year=1993|pages=17–23|contribution=Refugee women: their perspectives and our responses|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxfam|editor-last=O'Connell|editor-first=Helen|isbn=9780855982225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their large roles in these areas, women are excluded from leadership on committees and planning parties within refugee camps and are relegated to strictly laborious roles. Meanwhile, male refugees are frequently seen in positions of influence and power within the camp and among international aid agencies.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Refugee women in transitory camps are also frequently subjected to forced labor, encompassing both forced prostitution and forced physical labor.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In addition to violating the legal rights of refugees, forced labor experienced by women in refugee camps has been found to be detrimental to their physical, mental, and social well-being.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pittaway|first=Ellen|date=2001|title=Refugees, race, and gender: The multiple discrimination against refugee women|url=|journal=Refuge: Canada's Journal on Refugees|volume=19|pages=|via=Consortium on Gender, Security, and Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, women subjected to these and other forced labors are sought out on the basis of their race and stereotyped low position in society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Assault ==
According to the [[United Nations]], [[Domestic violence|gender based violence]] in the context of assault against refugee women is "any act of violence that results in...physical, sexual, or mental harm or suffering to women including threats..coercion, or arbitrary deprivation of liberty.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hynes|first=Michelle|date=October 2000|title=Sexual violence against refugee women|pmid=11074947|journal=Journal of Women's Health and Gender Based Medicine|volume=9|pages=819–823}}&lt;/ref&gt;" Assault on refugee women is both sexual and non-sexual, although instances of violence manifest most often in the form of [[sexual violence]] for refugee women.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

According to a 2000 study, women are particularly vulnerable to [[rape]] and other forms of [[sexual assault]] in times of war and "disintegration of social structures" for a variety of reasons.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These reasons include social unrest, the mingling of diverse cultures and values, prevalent power dynamics, and the vulnerability of women seeking refuge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Isolated, afraid and forgotten: The service delivery needs and realities of immigrant and refugee women who are battered|last=MacLeod|first=Linda|publisher=National Clearinghouse on Family Violence, Health, and Welfare|year=1990|isbn=|location=Ottawa, Canada|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ways in which violence and sexual assault manifest themselves against refugee women include forced prostitution or coerced sex by international aid agency workers / volunteers, [[forced prostitution]] or coerced sex by fellow members of the refugee camp, forced prostitution or coerced sex by local community members, rape by any of the above demographics, exchange of sex for vital material goods or services, or an attempt to dishonor a woman, her husband, or her father.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Sexual violence is considered a taboo subject in many cultures, and therefore gender-based violence often goes unreported as well. Even if women did seek to report violence, often there is nowhere within the refugee camp for them to turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=International public health: diseases, programs, systems, and policies|year=2006|last1=Norton|last2=Hyder|last3=Gururaj|first1=Robyn|first2=Adrian A.|first3=Gopalakrishna|page=337|contribution=Unintentional injuries and violence|edition=2nd|location=Sudbury, Massachusetts|publisher=Jones and Bartlett|isbn=9780763729677|editor-last1=Mills|editor-first1=Anne J.|editor-last2=Black|editor-first2=Robert E.|editor-last3=Merson|editor-first3=Michael|editor-link1=Anne Mills}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humanitarian assistance==
Numerous [[Nongovernmental organization]]s (NGOs) and [[intergovernmental organization]]s work to advocate on behalf of refugee women and children.

In 1989, the first efforts towards gender specific aid for refugees was published in [[UNHCR|United Nations High Commission on Refugee]] manuals.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vulnerable bodies : gender, the UN and the global refugee crisis|last=Baines|first=Erin|publisher=Ashgate|year=2004|isbn=|location=Aldershot, Hants, England|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first initiatives of gender mainstreaming in refugee aid were developed in response to the refugee crises of [[Guatemalan genocide|Guatemala]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia-Herzegovina]], and [[Rwandan genocide|Rwanda]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Since that time, the concept of [[gender mainstreaming]] has gained traction in a variety of refugee aid initiatives, yet experts believe that there are gaps between the policies they outline and the experience of refugee women.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Studies by Doreen Indra found that while there are many institutions providing [[humanitarian aid]] to refugee women, it may not reach its full potential due to a lack of refugee input in the programming and policies meant to provide them assistance.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=INDRA|first=DOREEN MARIE|date=1989-01-01|title=Ethnic Human Rights and Feminist Theory: Gender Implications for Refugee Studies and Practice|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/jrs/2.2.221|journal=Journal of Refugee Studies|language=en|volume=2|issue=2|pages=221–242|doi=10.1093/jrs/2.2.221|issn=0951-6328}}&lt;/ref&gt; When refugee women are excluded from the development process of humanitarian assistance, it was found that policies are often made rooted in traditional gender assumptions, thereby reinforcing traditional and sometimes harmful gender roles in refugee camps.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

A review by Linda Cipriano revealed that another barrier in executing effective aid for refugee women is that women are disproportionately denied status as a refugee, which in turn acts as a barrier to receiving the assistance they need.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cipriano|first=Laura|date=1993|title=Gender and Persecution: Protecting Women under International Refugee Law|url=|journal=Journal of International Law|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception, the universal definition for a refugee as described by the [[United Nations]] is a person with a “well-founded fear of persecution due to race, religion, nationality, or political opinion.&lt;ref name="unhcr.org" /&gt;” Under this definition, persecution on the basis of gender and sexual violence are not protected. Many countries abide by this strict language and deny women access to services of declared refugees on these grounds.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The [[International Rescue Committee]] serves as an advocate for women to foreign governments to pass laws concerning the health and well-being of refugee women. They also educate men and boys to change the culture of violence towards women.&lt;ref name="theirc.org"&gt;[http://www.theirc.org/irc-a-glance International Rescue Committee.

{{History of Georgia (country)}}
The '''Republic of Guria''' or the '''Gurian Peasant Republic''' was an insurrection that took place in the western [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]n province [[Guria]], against [[Imperial Russia]], prior to and during the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]].

==Background==
Underdeveloped and rather poor part of the [[Kutais Governorate]], Guria, officially called the [[Ozurgeti]] district (''Ozurgetsky uyezd''), was known not only for its oppositionist stance towards the Russian rule, but also for the unprecedented support for the [[Social Democratic Party of Georgia|Social Democratic (Menshevik) Party]]. The unrest began as the peasants' boycott of the local estate of Prince [[Machutadze]] in 1902. The so-called agrarian movement involving landless peasants evolved almost into an overt revolt early in 1903. The peasants stopped paying taxes and refused to work for the landlords. After a harsh official reaction, the peasants initiated a [[boycott]] of all government services. By summer, local government in the area had almost completely disintegrated. [[Nicholas II]] took no action against Guria throughout 1904, assuming that the cost of dealing with the rebellion would not be justified.

== History ==
[[File:Gogiashvili A., 'Gurians', 1906.jpg|thumb|''The Gurians hiding in the forest'' by Anton Gogiashvili, 1906.|left]]
After the beginning of the [[1905 Russian Revolution|1905 Revolution]], however, the revolt began spreading throughout [[Georgia within the Russian Empire|Georgia]] and the Gurian revolution proceeded even in a more radical way. The peasants sent away all the authorities, and, nominating their own judges, they organized independent village communities and armed ''red detachments'' also known as ''forest brothers'', embodying a whole territory. The [[Guria]]n peasant women at village meetings adopted resolutions demanding political equality with men. The revolutionaries largely used terrorism against the [[Tsar]]ist officers and loyal landlords. By February the whole of Guria was in the power of the revolutionaries, perhaps the world’s first [[Marxism|Marxist]] national-liberation movement.

On February 20, 1905 a Tsarist official warned that the government had lost control of much of the area. In March, the government declared [[martial law]] and a force of 10,000 soldiers was sent to the rebellious province. The Gurians offered a fierce resistance to the expedition and General Alikhanov-Avarsky, unable to regain control, had to withdraw in July. Several attempts to negotiate the conflict yielded no result. The [[Russia]]n forces returned in October, but were severely defeated at Nasakirali. In December 1905 the rebels took control of [[Ozurgeti]], Guria’s chief town. On January 10, 1906 Colonel Krilov’s strong reinforcements of all arms attacked the province and ruthlessly crushed the insurrection putting an end to the “Gurian Republic”.

'''Self-ownership''' (also known as '''sovereignty of the individual''' or '''individual sovereignty''') is the concept of property in one's own person, expressed as the [[Natural and legal rights|moral or natural right]] of a person to have [[bodily integrity]] and be the exclusive controller of one's own body and life. Self-ownership is a central idea in several [[Political philosophy|political philosophies]] that emphasize [[individualism]], such as [[liberalism]] and [[anarchism]].

== Definitional issues ==
=== The self ===
Discussion of the boundary of self with respect to ownership and responsibility has been explored by legal scholar [[Meir Dan-Cohen]] in his essays on ''The Value of Ownership'' and ''Responsibility and the Boundaries of the Self''. The emphasis of this work illuminates the phenomenology of ownership and our common usage of personal pronouns to apply to both body and property—this serves as the folk basis for legal conceptions and debates about responsibility and ownership. Another view holds that labor is alienable because it can be contracted out, thus alienating it from the self. In this view, the choice of a person to [[Voluntary slavery|voluntarily sell oneself into slavery]] is also preserved by the principle of self-ownership.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/library/toward-libertarian-theory-inalienability-critique-rothbard-barnett-smith-kinsella-gordon-and ''Toward a Libertarian Theory of Inalienability: A Critique of Rothbard, Barnett, Smith, Kinsella, Gordon, and Epstein''].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Labour markets and private property ===
For anarchist political philosopher [[L. Susan Brown]]: "Liberalism and anarchism are two political philosophies that are fundamentally concerned with [[Individual rights|individual freedom]] yet differ from one another in very distinct ways. Anarchism shares with liberalism a  commitment to individual freedom while rejecting liberalism's competitive property relations".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[L. Susan Brown]]. ''[[The Politics of Individualism: Liberalism, Liberal Feminism, and Anarchism]]''. Black Rose Books Ltd. 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar [[Ellen Meiksins Wood]] says that "there are doctrines of individualism that are opposed to [[John Locke|Lockean individualism]]... and non-Lockean individualism may encompass [[socialism]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ellen Meiksins Wood]]. ''Mind and Politics: An Approach to the Meaning of Liberal and Socialist Individualism''. [[University of California Press]]. 1972.  {{ISBN|0-520-02029-4}}. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Right-libertarianism|Right-libertarian]] conceptions of self-ownership extend the concept to include control of private property as part of the self. According to [[Gerald Cohen]], "the libertarian principle of self–ownership says that each person enjoys, over himself and his powers, full and exclusive rights of control and use, and therefore owes no service or product to anyone else that he has not contracted to supply".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy. 2004. Blackwell Publishing. p. 630&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Ian Shapiro]] says that labor markets affirm self-ownership because if self-ownership were not recognized, then people would not be allowed to sell the use of their productive capacities to others. He says that the individual sells the use of his productive capacity for a limited time and conditions but continues to own what he earns from selling the use of that capacity and the capacity itself, thereby retaining sovereignty over himself while contributing to economic efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, Ian. 2001. Democratic Justice. Yale University Press. pp. 145–46&lt;/ref&gt; A common view within [[classical liberalism]] is that sovereign-minded individuals usually assert a right of [[private property]] external to the body, reasoning that if a person owns themselves, they own their actions, including those that create or improve resources, therefore they own their own labour and the fruits thereof.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, J. W. 1996. Property and Justice. Oxford University Press. p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Human Action]]'', [[Austrian School]] [[economist]] [[Ludwig von Mises]] argues that labor markets are the rational conclusion of self-ownership and argues that collective ownership of labor ignores differing values for the labor of individuals:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of course, people believe that there is an essential difference between the tasks incumbent upon the comrades of the socialist commonwealth and those incumbent upon slaves or serfs. The slaves and serfs, they say, toiled for the benefit of an exploiting lord. But in a socialist system the produce of labor goes to society of which the toiler himself is a part; here the worker works for himself, as it were. What this reasoning overlooks is that the identification of the individual comrades and the totality of all comrades with the collective entity pocketing the produce of all work is merely fictitious. Whether the ends which the community's officeholders are aiming at agree or disagree with the wishes and desires of the various comrades, is of minor importance. The main thing is that the individual's contribution to the collective entity's wealth is not requited in the shape of wages determined by the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=von Mises |first1=Ludwig |authorlink=Ludwig von Mises |url=https://mises.org/sites/default/files/Human%20Action_3.pdf |title=Human Action |chapter=Work and Wages |page=628 |accessdate=2017-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nevertheless, there can be defense of self-ownership which can be critical of the idea of private property, specifically within the socialist branch of anarchism. The anarchist [[Oscar Wilde]] said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the recognition of private property has really harmed Individualism, and obscured it, by confusing a man with what he possesses. It has led Individualism entirely astray. It has made gain not growth its aim. So that man thought that the important thing was to have, and did not know that the important thing is to be. The true perfection of man lies, not in what man has, but in what man is...With the abolition of private property, then, we shall have true, beautiful, healthy Individualism. Nobody will waste his life in accumulating things, and the symbols for things. One will live. To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all".&lt;ref&gt;[[Oscar Wilde]]. ''[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/oscar-wilde-the-soul-of-man-under-socialism The Soul of Man under Socialism]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Within anarchism the concept of [[wage slavery]] refers to a situation perceived as quasi-voluntary slavery,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ellerman|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; where a person's [[livelihood]] depends on [[wage]]s, especially when the dependence is total and immediate.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;{{Cite web |title=wage slave |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wage%20slave |publisher=[[Merriam Webster|merriam-webster.com]] |accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=wage slave |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/wage%20slave |publisher=[[dictionary.com]] |accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[connotation|negatively connoted]] term used to draw an analogy between [[slavery]] and [[wage labor]] by focusing on similarities between owning and [[employment|renting]] a person. The term "wage slavery" has been used to criticize [[economic exploitation]] and [[social stratification]], with the former seen primarily as unequal bargaining power between labor and capital (particularly when workers are paid comparatively low wages, e.g. in [[sweatshops]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sandel|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_KdrTfTxqvgC&amp;pg=PA184 184]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the latter as a lack of [[workers' self-management]], fulfilling job choices and leisure in an economy.&lt;ref name="globetrotter.berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people2/Chomsky/chomsky-con2.html |title=Conversation with Noam Chomsky |page=2 |publisher=Globetrotter.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HB"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hallgrimsdottir|Benoit|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spunk.org"&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Bolsheviks and Workers Control, 1917–1921: The State and Counter-revolution |url=http://www.spunk.org/texts/places/russia/sp001861/bolintro.html |publisher=[[Spunk Library]] |accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of the [[Industrial Revolution]], thinkers such as [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Karl Marx]] elaborated the comparison between wage labor and slavery in the context of a critique of societal property not intended for active personal use&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Proudhon|1890}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marx 1863 c7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Marx|1969|loc=[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1863/theories-surplus-value/ch07.htm Chapter VII]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Luddite]]s emphasized the [[dehumanization]] brought about by machines. [[Emma Goldman]] famously denounced wage slavery by saying: "The only difference is that you are hired slaves instead of block slaves".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goldman|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0IF7CusxuMcC&amp;pg=PA283  283]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[left-libertarianism]], scholars such as [[Hillel Steiner]],&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, Hillel (1994). ''An Essay on Rights''. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Vallentyne]],&lt;ref&gt;(2000). ''Left Libertarianism and Its Critics: The Contemporary Debate''. In Vallentyne, Peter; and Steiner, Hillel. London: Palgrave.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philippe Van Parijs]],&lt;ref&gt;Van Parijs, Philippe (2009). ''Marxism Recycled''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Otsuka]]&lt;ref&gt;Otsuka, Michael (2005). ''Libertarianism without Inequality''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and David Ellerman&lt;ref&gt;Ellerman, David (1992). ''Property and Contract in Economics: The Case for Economic Democracy''. Cambridge MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellerman, David (1990). ''The Democratic Worker-Owned Firm''. London:Unwin Hyman.&lt;/ref&gt; root an economic egalitarianism in the classical liberal concepts of self-ownership and [[land appropriation]], combined with [[geoist]] or [[physiocrat]]ic views regarding the ownership of land and [[natural resources]] (e.g. those of [[John Locke]] and [[Henry George]]). Left-libertarians "maintain that the world's natural resources were initially unowned, or belonged equally to all, and it is illegitimate for anyone to claim exclusive private ownership of these resources to the detriment of others. Such private appropriation is legitimate only if everyone can appropriate an equal amount, or if those who appropriate more are taxed to compensate those who are thereby excluded from what was once common property". This position is articulated in contrast to the position of other libertarians who argue for a right to appropriate parts of the external world based on sufficient use, even if this [[homesteading]] yields unequal results.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. (1982). ''The Ethics of Liberty''. Atlantic Heights, NJ: Humanities.&lt;/ref&gt; Some left-libertarians of the Steiner–Vallentyne type support some form of income redistribution on the grounds of a claim by each individual to be entitled to an equal share of natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;(2000). ''Left-Libertarianism and Its Critics: The Contemporary Debate''. In Steiner, Hillel and Vallentyne, Peter. London: Macmillan p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(2004). ''Handbook of Political Theory''. In Gaus, Gerald F. and Kukathas, Chandran. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[John Locke]] wrote in his ''Two Treatises on Government'' that "every man has a Property in his own Person". Locke also said that the individual "has a right to decide what would become of himself and what he would do, and as having a right to reap the benefits of what he did".&lt;ref&gt;Olsaretti, Serena. 2004. ''Liberty, Desert and the Market''. Cambridge University Press. p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dan-Cohen, Meir. 2002. ''Harmful Thoughts: Essays on Law, Self, and Morality''. Princeton University Press.  p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; [[Josiah Warren#Philosophy|Josiah Warren]] was the first who wrote about the "sovereignty of the individual".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bright/warren/WarrenManifesto/Pages/6.html ''Josiah Warren Manifesto''].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Spirit Fruit Society''' was a [[communitarian]] group in the United States that was organized after a period of repeated business [[Panic of 1893|depressions]] during the 1890s. The society had its beginnings in [[Lisbon, Ohio]] and, over the years of its existence moved to [[Ingleside, Illinois]] and, finally, to [[California]]. Plagued by rumor, suspicion, and attacks in the press during its early years, the group remained active until 1930. Although it never numbered more than a handful of adherents, the Spirit Fruit Society existed longer and more successfully than any other American [[utopian]] group.

The name is derived from the group's belief that mankind's spiritual state is that of a [[bud]] or [[blossom]] on a plant and that man's soul has not yet developed into a fruit from a blossom. The goal of the society was to bring the soul to fruition. As the society's founder, [[Jacob L. Beilhart|Jacob Beilhart]], said in documents for incorporation of the society, "...&amp;nbsp;as yet, man is an underdeveloped 'plant' which has not manifested the final fruit, which he is to produce."&lt;ref name=Murphy/&gt; The essential philosophy of the group was based upon a belief in self-renunciation, hard work, tolerance, and peace.

==Jacob L. Beilhart, founder==
{{Main|Jacob L. Beilhart}}
[[Image:Beilhart.png|thumb|160px|alt=Jacob L. Beilhart, 1904|Jacob Beilhart, 1904]]
The Spirit Fruit Society was started by Jacob Beilhart (4 March 1867&amp;nbsp;– 24 November 1908),&lt;ref name=OhioHistory /&gt; who was born in [[Columbiana County]], [[Ohio]],&lt;ref name=Tutwiler /&gt; to a Lutheran father and a [[Mennonite]] mother. Beilhart was raised in the [[Lutheran]] church and his early home environment was strictly religious.&lt;ref name=Hinds /&gt;

When he was 18, Beilhart moved to [[Kansas]], where he met and married Olive Louema Blow, whose family belonged to the Seventh-day Adventist church, which Beilhart then joined. Jacob and Louema traveled to [[California]] to attend the [[Pacific Union College|Adventist College]] at [[Healdsburg, California|Healdsburg]]. Jacob received a preacher's license and the couple returned to Kansas where he began preaching.&lt;ref name = Murphy /&gt; After two years, however, faced with the prospect of being sent to work in other areas of the country, Beilhart left preaching, maintaining that he wanted to do something "besides talk".&lt;ref name= OhioHistory /&gt; Beilhart felt a strong need to help the sick so he enrolled in a nursing program at the [[Battle Creek Sanitarium]],{{Cref2|a}} which was run by Dr. [[John Harvey Kellogg]].{{Cref2|b}}&lt;ref name=OhioHistory /&gt;

Beilhart became friends with [[C. W. Post]],{{Cref2|c}} who had been a patient at the sanitarium. Post's health improved dramatically while under the care of a [[Christian Science]] [[faith healing|"faith healer"]], Mrs. Elizabeth K. Gregory.&lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt; In 1892, Post started ''La Vita Inn'', a sanitorium of his own, and hired Beilhart as an associate. The two men took instruction in Christian Science while Beilhart worked at the inn and helped develop Post's cereal drink, [[Postum]]. Post and Beilhart rejected much of the Christian Science doctrine, but embraced the religion's view that illness was an illusion and could be overcome by mental suggestion and self-sacrifice.&lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tutwiler /&gt;

During his time in Kansas, Beilhart obsessively investigated a variety of beliefs, including Christian Science, [[Church of Divine Science|Divine Science]], [[Spiritualism]], and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]. He found, however, that none of these religions held his interest. In time, he came to the realization that he would not adhere to any one denomination, but develop a faith of his own by combining aspects of [[syncretism|several different religions]].&lt;ref name=OhioHistory /&gt;

Beilhart rejected [[Economic materialism|materialism]] and disavowed personal property. He held that jealousy, doubt, and the fear of losing the love of another caused much of the disease people experienced. He felt that rejecting personal possessions was a means of attaining the Fruit of the Universal Spirit.&lt;ref name=OhioHistory /&gt;

Members of the Spirit Fruit Society lived according to the following basic principles: seek happiness through selflessness; follow one's conscience; take responsibility for one's actions—and develop an awareness of the consequences of one's actions on others; and accept whatever happens. Beilhart believed very strongly in the individual's right to guide his own actions, and not be dictated to by others.&lt;ref name = Murphy /&gt; While there was no mention of any kind of organization or hierarchy in any documents, as the leader, Beilhart likely made important decisions concerning the group. There is no record of any kind of internal conflict between members.&lt;ref name=OhioHistory /&gt;

Newspapers of the time reported that the society promoted [[free love]], but the society promoted free love only in the sense that consenting adults had a right to change partners and even to have more than one partner at a time. Rather than promiscuousness, though, the society promoted tolerance, including tolerance of homosexuality. The Spirit Fruit Society, unlike most other communitarian groups of that time, did not seek to convert or recruit others to the group. Members were permitted to come and go as they pleased.&lt;ref name=Dretske /&gt; The goal of the commune was not to convert or to expand membership in the society—it was simply to live as the adherents wished to live.&lt;ref name = Murphy /&gt;

Very little exists in the way of firsthand accounts of life within the society. In an effort to dispel some of the misconceptions and rumors about the society, Beilhart wrote extensively for newspapers to explain the workings of the group.&lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt;

The members worked together and shared all property. If a member of the society needed money for some purpose, they were free to take it from a community supply. Women of the society worked in the house sewing, setting type for newsletters, and general housework, while the men worked the farm. One of the founding principles of the society was that of the "free gift". It dictated that, if anyone wanted something that they had to give—printed materials in particular—they had only to ask and it would be given to them without charge. After reading or seeing the society in practice, those people were free to contribute if they wished, but it was stressed that this was a "free gift" and not payment. In order to rise from their lower, selfish nature into an unselfish, spiritual nature, the society taught, everyone should obey the law of their being and subdue passions and impulses that control them by nature. The society believed in business and societal laws, but they felt that man would rise above those laws when they gained full control of their lower nature. They maintained, however, that they should still be obedient to those laws.&lt;ref name= Buckeye /&gt;

==History==
===Lisbon, Ohio, the beginning===

In 1896, Beilhart returned to Ohio and settled in [[Lisbon, Ohio|Lisbon]], close to where he was reared. Paramount among the reasons for his return was the confession of Louema Beilhart that her two children were not his, but C. W. Post's. She soon left Lisbon for her home in [[La Cygne, Kansas]]. In 1899, Beilhart decided to create an [[intentional community]] to practice his newly developed beliefs and to demonstrate this practice to others.&lt;ref name=OhioHistory /&gt; In the aftermath of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], a number of communitarian groups were started around the United States. The rise in activism was further promoted by the effects of the [[Long depression|depression]] at end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Dretske /&gt; By this time, however, [[William McKinley|McKinley]] prosperity had developed and, in any case, Beilhart never displayed a particular interest in politics or economics. At this time he started two newspapers, ''Spirit Fruit'' and ''Spirit Voice'', which were widely distributed and supported by donations.&lt;ref name=Murphy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tutwiler /&gt; The Spirit Fruit Society was officially [[incorporation (business)|incorporated]] as a religious organization in 1901. The stated goal in the incorporation documents was to "teach mankind how to apply the truths taught by [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]."&lt;ref name=Murphy/&gt;&lt;ref name=OhioHistory /&gt; Beilhart made no attempt to solicit members for his commune and sometimes rejected applicants when he felt they were not fit candidates. As a result, the commune only attracted about a dozen residents, mostly from outside the area.&lt;ref name=OhioHistory /&gt;

The group did not beg or in any way disturb their neighbors.&lt;ref name=Tutwiler /&gt; Beilhart preached in Chicago and elsewhere, but was not known to proselytize strongly. While the group typically kept to themselves, their mysterious nature led to misconceptions and suspicion in the press. Specifically, the birth of Beilhart's niece, Evelyn, was cause for concern as her mother, Mary Beilhart (Jacob's sister), was not married to the child's father, Ralph E. Galbreath (cousin of Ohio State Librarian [[Charles Burleigh Galbreath]] and State Senator [[Asher A. Galbreath]]). Dubbed the "Love Child", this birth prompted newspapers to characterize the group as a free-love society of promiscuity. The arrival of "Blessed" Katherine Herbeson, a teenager from Chicago, also gave concern. It was reported in the press that "Blessed" was either held against her will or [[Mind control|brainwashed]] by the society. Her father and brother came and 'rescued' her and she was forced to leave the society against her wishes.&lt;ref name=Echoes /&gt; Additional negative publicity occurred when Beilhart objected to his wife's petition for alimony.{{Cref2|d}}&lt;ref name=Murphy/&gt;

In 1904, numerous newspaper articles and editorials were written, mostly in Chicago, about the society. Those articles were often sensationalist and tended to put the society in a bad light. The views of the society, particularly those against marriage and promoting free love, were not accepted well in the small Ohio village of Lisbon. In fact, a local newspaper reprinted a warning that had been distributed in the community: "Wanted – Fifty good women, over twenty and under fifty years of age; also fifty good honest-hearted men with families, to meet upon the Square when called upon, and go to the Spirit Fruit farm and tell them to take their departure at once or take the consequences, as tar is cheap and feathers plentiful."&lt;ref name=OhioHistory /&gt;

[[Image:Lisbon open house 1904.png|thumb|right|alt=Spirit Fruit Society Open House -Lisbon, OH 1904|Spirit Fruit Society Open House – Lisbon, Ohio, 1904]]

In June 1904, Beilhart invited the public to an 'open house' where he attempted to explain the motives and beliefs of the society. Over 400 people attended the gathering. Among them, it has been claimed, were [[Clarence Darrow]] and [[Elbert Hubbard]] but this has not been documented, although Beilhart is known to have visited Hubbard in East Aurora and Darrow was a frequent visitor to the society during the Chicago and Ingleside years. In the end, the society's rejection of marriage on the grounds that it made a 'slave of the woman', and the misinterpretations of their views on free-love were too much for the people of Lisbon to accept.&lt;ref name=Echoes /&gt; In late 1904, the group left Lisbon for [[Chicago]], in the hope that their progressive ideas might be better tolerated there.&lt;ref name=Murphy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dretske /&gt;

===Ingleside, Illinois, and the death of Beilhart===
In 1905, Beilhart purchased {{convert|90|acre|ha|lk=off}} near [[Ingleside, Illinois]], along [[Lake County, Illinois#Lakes|Wooster Lake]], a tract known as the Dalziel Farm. About a dozen established members of the Spirit Fruit Society moved with Beilhart to Illinois, along with a few new members. Over the next two years the society built a spacious house and later a large barn entirely by hand.&lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt; They were better received by their Illinois neighbors than they had been in Lisbon.&lt;ref name=Tutwiler /&gt; On the property by the lake, the society's members hand-built a concrete-block home that they called the "Spirit Fruit Temple". The 2½-story residence had 32 rooms, a full basement, and modern (for the time) conveniences. The dining room accommodated up to 100 people. The society continued to live peacefully in Ingleside for several years. They provided for themselves from what came to be known as the "Spirit Fruit Farm",&lt;ref name=OttawaObit /&gt; opened the farm and temple to visitors, and produced their newsletter. Beilhart continued to speak to groups in Chicago promoting the ideals of the society.&lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt;

In November 1908, Beilhart became ill from acute [[appendicitis]]. Despite attention from a surgeon who performed an [[appendectomy]], Beilhart developed [[peritonitis]] and died three days later. In keeping with the society's beliefs in simplicity, Beilhart was buried in a plain coffin in an unmarked grave overlooking Wooster Lake. None of the buildings remain, having been covered by a housing development, although Beilhart's grave remains in a brush-obscured corner of the tract.&lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dretske /&gt;&lt;ref name=OttawaObit /&gt;

The loss of a charismatic and dominant leader often precipitates the decline of such groups, but the Spirit Fruit Society persevered. This made the society unique among other groups of this time. Though the commune continued after his death, their two publications, ''Spirit Voice'' and ''Spirit Fruit'', ceased to be produced.&lt;ref name=Tutwiler /&gt; Virginia Moore was chosen president of the society upon Beilhart's death, and the community stayed together and carried on its activities as before. In 1911, the society put an advertisement in the local papers seeking to sell their lakefront property and 'temple'. Virginia Moore stated that the Illinois climate was not suitable for their activities and the decision had been made to move to California. In the winter of 1914–1915, the society moved west.&lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt;

===California and the end===
In 1915, the society purchased {{convert|80|acre|ha|lk=off}} of land in [[Soquel, California]], which they named "Hilltop Ranch". At this point, only 12 of the society's members remained. They included Mary Beilhart's two 'illegitimate' children born in Ohio, now 11 and 15 years old. Just as in Ohio and Illinois, the group made no efforts at recruiting new members, although three new members did join during this time.&lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt;

The primary focus of the society at this time was simple subsistence. To continue as a group, they had to focus all of their energies on producing food. This was problematic because many of the members were becoming old and several suffered illnesses. Since the beginning, Beilhart and the other members had not actively sought out new members, believing that a small group was more viable. This proved to be their undoing as there were no younger members to sustain the farm. The original members, who had stayed with the group since its inception, began to leave and by 1928, only six were left. Financial strains forced them to relinquish the ranch and move to a house in the village of Soquel.&lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tutwiler /&gt;

The group finally disbanded in 1930 when Virginia Moore died of cancer. After her death, the remaining members of the Spirit Fruit Society dispersed to various homes of friends and family. Despite the small membership, the society had been in existence for almost 30 years&amp;nbsp;– 20 years beyond the death of its founder.&lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt;
==Success of the society==
Throughout its existence, the society never claimed more than a couple dozen members. They never actively recruited new members nor proselytized in the communities. Like many such organizations, they were often persecuted by the press and were the subject of dubious reports. Despite this, and, more significantly, despite the loss of their spiritual leader, Beilhart, the society continued to exist longer than most other communes at that time.
&lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt;

Though rooted in Christianity yet exhibiting traits of communalism, the members of the society were not bound by either set of beliefs or values. Murphy suggests that this is one of the reasons for the society's longevity&amp;nbsp;– that, rather than be confined by one belief system, the members could easily adapt to, and solve, everyday issues arising within the community as well as threats from outside. &lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt;

'''Stanley Jasspon Kunitz''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|juː|n|ɪ|t|s}}; July 29, 1905{{spaced ndash}}May 14, 2006) was an American [[poet]]. He was appointed [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress]] twice, first in 1974 and then again in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Poet Laureate Timeline: 1971-1980 | url=https://www.loc.gov/poetry/laureate-1971-1980.html | publisher=Library of Congress | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Kunitz was born in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], the youngest of three children, to Yetta Helen (''née'' Jasspon) and Solomon Z. Kunitz,&lt;ref name=OrrG-pxxvii&gt;{{citation |author=Orr, Gregory |year=1985 |title=Stanley Kunitz: An Introduction to the Poetry |publisher=Columbia University Press |page=xxvii |isbn=978-0-231-05234-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  both of [[Jew]]ish [[Russia]]n [[Lithuania]]n descent.&lt;ref name=KimmelmanBTCRH-p323&gt;{{cite book |author1=Kimmelman, Burt |author2=Temple Cone |author3=Randall Huff |last-author-amp=yes |title=The Facts on File Companion to American Poetry: 1900 to the Present |year=2008 |publisher=Facts On File |isbn=978-0-8160-6950-7 |page=323 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father, a dressmaker of Russian Jewish heritage,&lt;ref name=KimmelmanBTCRH-p323/&gt;  committed [[suicide]] in a public park six weeks before Stanley was born.&lt;ref name=BrahamJ-p65&gt;{{cite book |author=Braham, Jeanne |title=The Light Within the Light |year=2007 |publisher=David R. Godine Publisher |isbn=978-1-56792-316-2 |page=65 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After going bankrupt, he went to Elm Park in Worcester,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Williamson, Chet |title=A Poetic Structure |journal=Worcester Mag |publisher=Holden Landmark Corporation |date=June 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and drank [[carbolic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davison, Peter |title=The Fading Smile |year=1994 |publisher=Knopf |isbn=978-0-679-40658-7 |page=230 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His mother removed every trace of Kunitz's father from the household.&lt;ref name=BrahamJ-p65/&gt;  The death of his father would be a powerful influence of his life.&lt;ref name=HarrisonSue-2006-05-18&gt;{{cite news |author=Harrison, Sue  |title=Farewell, Stanley: Former Poet Laureate Stanley Kunitz dies at 100 |newspaper=Proviencetown Banner |publisher=GateHouse Media |date=May 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kunitz and his two older sisters, Sarah and Sophia, were raised by his mother, who had made her way from [[Josvainiai|Yashwen]], Kovno, Lithuania by herself in 1890,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Feingold, Norma |author2=Nancy Sadick |last-author-amp=yes |title=Water Street: World Within a World |year=1983 |publisher=Worcester Historical Museum |page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and opened a [[dry goods]] store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Magill, Frank Northen |title=Critical Survey of Poetry: English Language Series |year=1992 |publisher=Salem Press |isbn=978-0-89356-838-2 |page=1881 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yetta remarried to Mark Dine in 1912. Yetta and Mark filed for [[bankruptcy]] in 1912 and then were indicted by the [[United States District Court|U.S. District Court]] for concealing assets.  They pleaded guilty and turned over [[United States dollar|USD$]]10,500 to the trustees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Creditors Get Property|newspaper=[[Boston Evening Transcript]]|date=June 28, 1912|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mark Dine died when Kunitz was fourteen,&lt;ref name=OrrG-pxxvii/&gt;  when, while hanging curtains, he suffered a heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Goodyear, Dana |title=Profiles: THE GARDENER |page=107 |journal=The New Yorker: Volume 79, Issues 21-28 |date=September 1, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At fifteen, Kunitz moved out of the house and became a butcher's assistant.&lt;ref name=OrrG-pxxvii/&gt;  Later he got a job as a cub reporter on [[Telegram &amp; Gazette|''The Worcester Telegram'']], where he would continue working during his summer vacations from college.&lt;ref name=OrrG-pxxvii/&gt;

Kunitz graduated ''[[summa cum laude]]'' in 1926 from [[Harvard University|Harvard College]] with an English major and a philosophy minor,&lt;ref name=OrrG-pxxvii/&gt; and then earned a [[master's degree]] in English from Harvard the following year.  He wanted to continue his studies for a doctorate degree, but was told by the university that the Anglo-Saxon students would not like to be taught by a Jew.&lt;ref name=OrrG-pxxvii/&gt;

After Harvard, he worked as a reporter for ''The Worcester Telegram'', and as editor for the H. W. Wilson Company in [[New York City]].  He then founded and edited ''[[Wilson Library Bulletin]]'' and started the ''Author Biographical Studies''.&lt;ref name=OrrG-pxxvii/&gt;  Kunitz married Helen Pearce in 1930;&lt;ref name=OrrG-pxxvii/&gt; they divorced in 1937.&lt;ref name=OrrG-pxxviii&gt;Orr. p.xxviii.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1935 he moved to New Hope, Pennsylvania and befriended [[Theodore Roethke]].&lt;ref name=OrrG-pxxviii/&gt;  He married Eleanor Evans in 1939; they had a daughter Gretchen in 1950.&lt;ref name=OrrG-pxxviii/&gt; Kunitz divorced Eleanor in 1958.&lt;ref name=OrrG-pxxix&gt;Orr. p.xxix.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Wilson Company, Kunitz served as co-editor for ''Twentieth Century Authors'', among other reference works.  In 1931, as Dilly Tante, he edited ''Living Authors, a Book of Biographies''.  His poems began to appear in [[Poetry (magazine)|''Poetry'']], ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]'', ''[[The New Republic]]'', ''[[The Nation]]'', and ''[[The Dial]]''.

During [[World War II]], he was drafted into the [[United States Army|Army]] in 1943 as a [[conscientious objector]], and after undergoing basic training three times, served as a noncombatant at Gravely Point, Washington in the Air Transport Command in charge of information and education. He refused a [[Commissioned officer|commission]] and was discharged with the rank of [[staff sergeant]].&lt;ref name=OrrG-pxxviii/&gt;

After the war, he began a peripatetic teaching career at [[Bennington College]] (1946–1949; taking over from his friend Roethke).&lt;ref name=OrrG-pxxviii/&gt; He subsequently taught at the [[State University of New York at Potsdam]] (then the New York State Teachers College at Potsdam) as a full professor (1949-1950; summer sessions through 1954), the [[New School for Social Research]] (lecturer; 1950-1957), the [[University of Washington]] (visiting professor; 1955-1956), [[Queens College]] (visiting professor; 1956-1957), [[Brandeis University]] (poet-in-residence; 1958-1959) and [[Columbia University]] (lecturer in the [[Columbia University School of General Studies|School of General Studies]]; 1963-1966) before spending 18 years as an adjunct professor of writing at Columbia's [[Columbia University School of the Arts|School of the Arts]] (1967-1985). Throughout this period, he also held visiting appointments at [[Yale University]] (1970), [[Rutgers University–Camden]] (1974), [[Princeton University]] (1978) and [[Vassar College]] (1981).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.marquiswhoswho.com/profile/100002462887|title=Marquis Biographies Online|website=search.marquiswhoswho.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his divorce from Eleanor, he married the painter and poet [[Elise Asher]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Elise Asher, 92, Painter-Poet Who Blended Images and Words |author=Saxon, Wolfgang |date=March 13, 2004 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; His marriage to Asher led to friendships with artists like [[Philip Guston]] and [[Mark Rothko]].&lt;ref name=OrrG-pxxix/&gt;

Kunitz's poetry won wide praise for its profundity and quality. He was the New York State Poet Laureate from 1987 to 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/main/poets/newyork.html|work=US State Poets Laureate|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to write and publish until his centenary year, as late as 2005. Many consider that his poetry's [[symbol]]ism is influenced significantly by the work of [[Carl Jung]]. Kunitz influenced many 20th-century poets, including [[James Wright (poet)|James Wright]], [[Mark Doty]], [[Louise Glück]], Joan Hutton Landis, and Carolyn Kizer.

For most of his life, Kunitz divided his time between New York City and [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]]. He enjoyed gardening and maintained one of the most impressive seaside gardens in Provincetown. There he also founded [[Fine Arts Work Center]], where he was a mainstay of the literary community, as he was of [[Poets House]] in Manhattan.

He was awarded the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience award in Sherborn, Massachusetts in October 1998 for his contribution to the liberation of the human spirit through his poetry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peaceabbey.org/awards/cocrecipientlist.html The Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Recipients List] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214172308/http://www.peaceabbey.org/awards/cocrecipientlist.html |date=2009-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in 2006 at his home in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lehmann-Haupt |first=Christopher |title=Stanley Kunitz, Poet Laureate, Dies at 100 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He had previously come close to death, and reflected on the experience in his last book, a collection of essays, ''The Wild Braid: A Poet Reflects on a Century in the Garden''.

==Poetry==
Kunitz's first collection of poems, ''Intellectual Things,'' was published in 1930. His second volume of poems, ''Passport to the War'', was published fourteen years later; the book went largely unnoticed, although it featured some of Kunitz's best-known poems, and soon fell out of print. Kunitz's confidence was not in the best of shape when, in 1959, he had trouble finding a publisher for his third book, ''Selected Poems: 1928-1958.'' Despite this unflattering experience, the book, eventually published by Little Brown, received the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]].

|title=''The Testing-Tree'' - (partial excerpt)
|date=}}

His next volume of poems would not appear until 1971, but Kunitz remained busy through the 1960s editing reference books and translating Russian poets. When twelve years later ''The Testing Tree'' appeared, Kunitz's style was radically transformed from the highly intellectual and philosophical musings of his earlier work to more deeply personal yet disciplined narratives; moreover, his lines shifted from [[iambic pentameter]] to a freer [[prosody (poetry)|prosody]] based on instinct and breath—usually resulting in shorter stressed lines of three or four beats.

Throughout the 70s and 80s, he became one of the most treasured and distinctive voices in American poetry. His collection ''Passing Through: The Later Poems'' won the [[National Book Award for Poetry]] in 1995.&lt;ref name=nba1995/&gt; Kunitz received many other honors, including a [[National Medal of Arts]], the [[Bollingen Prize]] for a lifetime achievement in poetry, the [[Robert Frost Medal]], and [[Harvard University|Harvard]]'s Centennial Medal. He served two terms as Consultant on Poetry for the [[Library of Congress]] (the precursor title to Poet Laureate), one term as Poet Laureate of the United States, and one term as the State Poet of [[New York State|New York]]. He founded the [[Fine Arts Work Center]] in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]], and [[Poets House]] in [[New York City]]. Kunitz also acted as a judge for the [[Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition]].

==Library Bill of Rights==
Kunitz served as editor of the ''[[Wilson Library Bulletin]]'' from 1928 to 1943. An outspoken critic of censorship, in his capacity as editor, he targeted his criticism at librarians who did not actively oppose it. He published an article in 1938 by [[Bernard Berelson]] entitled "The Myth of Library Impartiality". This article led [[Forrest Spaulding]] and the Des Moines Public Library to draft the [[Library Bill of Rights]], which was later adopted by the [[American Library Association]] and continues to serve as the cornerstone document on intellectual freedom in libraries.&lt;ref&gt;McCook, Kathleen de la Peña (2011).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24769">[[Structural discrimination]] (also known as [[structural inequality]], systemic discrimination, or [[institutional racism]]) occurs in a society "when an entire network of rules and practices disadvantages less empowered groups while serving at the same time to advantage the dominant group".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssc.govt.nz/node/5282] Definition from 'EEO Policy to 2010: Future Directions of EEO in the New Zealand Public Service'.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Human Rights Commission]] in [[New Zealand]] have asserted that there is strong, consistent evidence that structural discrimination is a real and ongoing issue in the country.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.hrc.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/HRC-Structural-Report_final_webV1.pdf] Human Rights Commission (2012) Report, 'A Fair Go For All - Addressing Structural Discrimination in Public Services', at 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission has acknowledged the importance of addressing institutional barriers within New Zealand's social institutions, stating that these barriers help to create [[social inequalities]] which in turn limit the access to and fulfillment of New Zealand's [[human rights]] obligations.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.hrc.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/HRC-Structural-Report_final_webV1.pdf] Human Rights Commission (2012) Report.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ministry of Social Development (New Zealand)|New Zealand Department of Social Welfare's]] (1988) Report, [[Puao-te-Ata-tu]], it was noted that structural discrimination is “the most insidious and destructive form of racism.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msd.govt.nz/documents/about-msd-and-our-work/publications-resources/archive/1988-puaoteatatu.pdf] Department of Social Welfare (1988) Report, Puao-te-atu-tu (Daybreak), at 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The Report found that the negative effects of structural discrimination were wide reaching and inter-generational and primarily disadvantaged New Zealand’s most vulnerable groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msd.govt.nz/documents/about-msd-and-our-work/publications-resources/archive/1988-puaoteatatu.pdf] Department of Social Welfare (1988) Report, Puao-te-atu-tu (Daybreak).&lt;/ref&gt; Joris de Bres, New Zealand’s [[New Zealand Human Rights Commission|Race Relations Commissioner]] from 2002-2013, stated that the systems and processes in New Zealand public services are not sufficiently sensitive to the diversity of its population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3news.co.nz/Structural-discrimination-still-needs-work---Human-Rights-Commission/tabid/423/articleID/266000/Default.aspx] 3news interview with Joris de Bres, (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that addressing structural discrimination is vitally important for New Zealand as currently structural disadvantage is being perpetuated with [[Māori people|Māori]], [[Pacific Islander|Pasifika]], and ethnic minorities not getting equal outcomes through their access and interaction with public service bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3news.co.nz/Structural-discrimination-still-needs-work---Human-Rights-Commission/tabid/423/articleID/266000/Default.aspx] Interview (2012), as above.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislative context==
At a domestic level [[human rights in New Zealand]] are primarily contained in the [[Human Rights Act 1993 (New Zealand)|Human Rights Act 1993]] (HRA) and [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]] (NZBORA). Structural Discrimination is not given a definition in the domestic legislation, however, under the HRA (following the NZBORA non-discrimination standard) it is unlawful to discriminate on the grounds of race, colour, ethnicity or national origin, with this including both direct and [[indirect discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;As was stated in ''Northern Regional Health Authority v Human Rights Commission'' [1998] 2 NZLR 218; (1997) 4 HRNZ 37 (HC)..... CITE THE HRA as well......&lt;/ref&gt; Structural discrimination can be considered a form of indirect discrimination as it occurs when an action, omission, or policy that appears to treat everyone in the same manner, actually creates negative effects unfairly impacting a particular group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/HRC-Structural-Report_final_webV1.pdf] Human Rights Commission (2012) Report.&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights are also protected at an international level with New Zealand having ratified numerous international human rights treaties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://treaties.un.org/Pages/Treaties.aspx?id=4&amp;subid=A&amp;lang=en] UN Treaty Collection: New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Article 2(1)(c) of the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] (CERD) it is stated that, “each State party shall take effective measures to review governmental, national and local policies, and to amend, rescind or nullify any laws and regulations which have the effect of creating or perpetuating racial discrimination wherever it exists."&lt;ref&gt;See Article 2(1)(c), accessed http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CERD.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; As is affirmed by Geiringer and Palmer, this brings about positive obligations on the State to address matters of structural discrimination, meaning that a State must, "ensure that formal rights and entitlements are extended without discrimination", by looking to, "eliminate structural inequalities and actual social and economic disparities.”&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights and Social Policy in New Zealand, article found at http://www.msd.govt.nz/about-msd-and-our-work/publications-resources/journals-and-magazines/social-policy-journal/spj30/30-human-rights-and-social-policy-in-new-zealand-pages12-41.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] is another key legislative document to acknowledge when discussing structural discrimination in New Zealand. Despite the well documented translation disagreements and lack of higher protective status of the Treaty in a domestic constitutional context,&lt;ref&gt;See summary of such arguments at http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/treaty/read-the-Treaty/differences-between-the-texts.&lt;/ref&gt; it is well recognised that the Treaty's articles concern recognition of rights and responsibilities which are necessary considerations when looking to address structural discrimination. The Human Rights Commission found in its (2010) Report, ‘Human Rights and the Treaty of Waitangi’, that, “the guarantee of equal rights promised in the Treaty remains unfulfilled today, as systemic disadvantage remains to be fully addressed.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.co.nz/human-rights-and-the-treaty-of-waitangi/human-rights-and-the-treaty] Human Rights Commission (2010) Report, 'Te Mana i Waitangi: Human Rights and the Treaty of Waitangi', at 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social context==
Overall, New Zealand's positive human rights record is well acknowledged and documented. Carlos Vazquez, Country [[Rapporteur]] for New Zealand for the CERD Committee (2013) Report, stated that 'the human rights situation in New Zealand was very positive and that remaining challenges were being addressed.'&lt;ref&gt;Summary accessed at http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO1302/S00238/committee-on-racial-discrimination-considers-report-of-nz.htm on 30/04/14.&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that New Zealand had implemented most of the recommendations made during the last review and that there were many examples of best practices which would be recommended to other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Summary accessed at http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO1302/S00238/committee-on-racial-discrimination-considers-report-of-nz.htm on 30/04/14.&lt;/ref&gt; These sentiments were echoed in New Zealand's dealings with the [[United Nations]] [[Universal Periodic Review of New Zealand|Universal Periodic Review]] (UPR) process. In 2014 the reviewing body, "recognised the high realisation of human rights in New Zealand and commended the Government on its ongoing commitment to improve the realisation of rights for all people in [[Aotearoa]] New Zealand.”&lt;ref&gt;Summary accessed at, http://www.hrc.co.nz/international-human-rights-new/upr-1314-nzs-second-universal-periodic-review/ on 30/04/14.&lt;/ref&gt; However, like any nation New Zealand has a specific set of human rights difficulties which arise because of the nation's history and the subsequent development of social policy.

Several United Nations human rights monitoring bodies have expressed their concern about inequalities in New Zealand, and have suggested several ways to address these, including acknowledgment and reduction of structural discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;A few examples being the UPR Committees, CERD, and Amnesty International New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt; The CERD Committee (2013) Report stated that despite several positive steps being taken to address the issue of structural discrimination in New Zealand, they were concerned that the problem remained.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, CERD (2013) Report, accessed at http://www.converge.org.nz/pma/CERD-C-NZL-CO-18-20.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee welcomed New Zealand's, "recognition that structural discrimination in the State party is partly responsible for the persistent poor outcomes that the members of the Maori and Pasifika communities experience", and that, "the Committee recommends that the State party intensify its efforts to improve the outcomes of the Maori and Pasifika in the fields of employment, health and in the administration of criminal justice by, inter alia, addressing the existing structural discrimination in the State party.”&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, CERD (2013) Report, accessed at http://www.converge.org.nz/pma/CERD-C-NZL-CO-18-20.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the United Nations Committee on [[Economic, social and cultural rights]] recommended that the New Zealand Government, “strengthen its efforts aimed at eliminating the disadvantages faced by Maori and Pasifika in the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights by addressing structural factors.”&lt;ref&gt;UNESCR (2012) Report, accessed at http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cescr/docs/co/E.C.12.NZL.CO.3_en.doc on 29/04/14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
In the Human Rights Commission’s (2010) annual review of race relations, 'Tui Tui Tuituia Race Relations', it was stated that structural discrimination and the institutional barriers it creates affect the full spectrum of human rights including, “civil, political, social and economic rights.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/RaceRelationsReport_2011_final.pdf] Human Rights Commission (2011) Report, 'Tüi Tüi Tuituiä: Race Relations in 2010', at 4.&lt;/ref&gt; When examining the effects of structural discrimination it can be seen that the [[Pakeha]] majority in New Zealand, “have better outcomes on nearly every socio-economic indicator, but they have also accumulated inter-generational benefits over time that concentrate and sustain ethnic differences in wealth, power and other indicators of wellbeing.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/HRC-Structural-Report_final_webV1.pdf] Human Rights Commission (2012) Report, at 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of structural discrimination are cumulative with disadvantages crossing both public institutions and generations. It is an unfortunate reality that in New Zealand there is no equality in access to rights to health, education, and justice due to a various socio-economic obstacles, including structural discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/HRC-Structural-Report_final_webV1.pdf] Human Rights Commission (2012) Report, at 3.&lt;/ref&gt; As is acknowledged by the Human Rights Commission, "although frequent citation of negative statistics about inequality can have the unintentional impact of further perpetuating negative messages about Maori and Pacific communities, statistics do provide an evidence base for analysing structural discrimination and encouraging government action."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/HRC-Structural-Report_final_webV1.pdf] Human Rights Commission (2012) Report, at 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
Article 12 of the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR) states that everyone has the right to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Article 12, accessed at http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CESCR.aspx on 30/04/14.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a vast amount of research into structural discrimination within the country's health institutions has found that "significant and deep-seated ethnic disparities in health and well-being continue to afflict New Zealand".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/HRC-Structural-Report_final_webV1.pdf] Human Rights Commission (2012) Report, at 18.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, research suggests that, “pacific peoples turn up for GP appointments at higher rates than the general New Zealander population, but experience worse outcomes and receive fewer referrals, despite statistically having a higher burden of disease.”&lt;ref&gt;Medical Council of New Zealand (2010) Report, ‘Best health outcomes for Pacific Peoples: Practice implications, at 9, accessed at http://www.mcnz.org.nz/assets/News-and-Publications/Statements/Best-health-outcomes-for-Pacific-Peoples.pdf on 29/04/14.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found that structural discrimination in health care institutions has been associated with lower odds of breast and cervical cancer screening among Maori women, as well as negative patient experiences for all participants.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, et al, “Self-reported experience of racial discrimination and health care use in New Zealand: results from the 2006/07 New Zealand Health Survey” (2012), accessed at http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.2011.300626 on 29/04/14.&lt;/ref&gt; This can help to explain why the life expectancy of Māori people is significantly lower than for non-Māori.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics stated in the Human Rights Commission (2011) Report, ‘Tui Tui Tuituia: Race Relations in 2010’, at 4, accessed at http://www.hrc.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/RaceRelationsReport_2011_final.pdf on 29/04/14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Article 26 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], (UDHR) states that everyone has the right to an education and that education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality.&lt;ref&gt;UDHR, Article 26, accessed at http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Documents/UDHR_Translations/eng.pdf on 29/04/14.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately in New Zealand it is easy to make connections between some of the continual ethnic inequalities in the education institutions and structural discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/HRC-Structural-Report_final_webV1.pdf] Human Rights Commission (2012) Report, at 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that approximately 50 per cent of Māori students leave school without any educational qualifications, compared to 21 per cent of the overall New Zealand population.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, R, et al, (2009), ‘Te Kotahitanga: Addressing educational disparities facing Maori students in New Zealand - Teaching and Teacher Education', at 1, accessed at http://tekotahitanga.tki.org.nz/Publications/Addressing-educational-disparities-facing-Maori-students-in-New-Zealand at 29/04/14.&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that some institutional approaches look at Maori and Pacific students as the problem instead of examining the structures and systems as the main contributors to educational inequity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/HRC-Structural-Report_final_webV1.pdf] Human Rights Commission (2012) Report, at 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a discussion paper on educational structural discrimination a New Zealand school principal gives a pertinent analogy between a colouring book and "the normalised nature of dominant culture world views and practices in education systems". She explains that in a colouring book white is the ‘invisible’ colour, because it’s just there as the whole background. Mainstream schools are described as “white spaces” that reflect the white spaces present in society where a set of rules and practices dictate “whose knowledge is important, what success looks like, what achievement matters, how the space is organised and who has the power."&lt;ref&gt;Milne, A. (2009), ‘Colouring in the White Spaces: Cultural Identity and Learning in School. Report for the ASB/APPA Travelling’, accessed at http://myportfolio.school.nz/artefact/file/download.php?file=468863&amp;view=92809&lt;/ref&gt; Such institutionalsied disadvantage starts at an early age with barriers in early childhood education then contributing to lower levels of higher educational achievement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/HRC-Structural-Report_final_webV1.pdf] Human Rights Commission (2012) Report, at 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Justice===
Article 26 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) states that all persons are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to the equal protection of the law.&lt;ref&gt;Article 26, accessed at http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx on 30/04/14.&lt;/ref&gt; However the Human Rights Commission has stated that the differences in convictions and sentencing for Māori and non-Māori illustrate evidence of structural discrimination and unconscious bias within the justice system sentencing process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/HRC-Structural-Report_final_webV1.pdf] Human Rights Commission (2012) Report, at 34.&lt;/ref&gt; This can is furthered by statistics relating to imprisonment. Ethnic minorities make up a disproportionately high percentage of prisoners despite their low percentage of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics New Zealand National Population projections, accessed online at http://www.statistics.govt.nz/tools_and_services/tools/TableBuilder/population-projections-tables.aspx on 30/04/14.&lt;/ref&gt; To explain this research suggests that there are two forms of structural discrimination that exist within the justice system in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/HRC-Structural-Report_final_webV1.pdf] Human Rights Commission (2012) Report, at 34.&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these is based upon the inherent nature of the New Zealand justice system. This system features a lack of engagement with the affected minorities in policy creation and implementation and demonstrates a lack of cultural sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/HRC-Structural-Report_final_webV1.pdf] Human Rights Commission (2012) Report, at 34.&lt;/ref&gt; The second relates to practice within the system. There is evidence of bias at different points throughout the system from arrests to sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/HRC-Structural-Report_final_webV1.pdf] Human Rights Commission (2012) Report, at 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government responses==
===Inaction and inclusion===
The Robson Hanan Trust concluded that despite the overwhelming evidence that structural discrimination exists in New Zealand, there has been a historical reluctance on the part of successive governments to address this key issue.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rethinking.org.nz/assets/Maori%20and%20the%20CJS/04_Shadow_Report_on_CERD.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Human Rights Commission has affirmed that, “inaction is a form of structural discrimination," and have stated that, "where government services do not respond to the specific needs of ethnic groups, the absence of initiatives perpetuates barriers.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/HRC-Structural-Report_final_webV1.pdf] Human Rights Commission (2012) Report, at 48.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted by several influential bodies within New Zealand and through international human rights monitoring that inaction has been a leading contributing factor in restricting New Zealand’s progress in eliminating structural discrimination and upholding all of New Zealand's international human rights obligations as such.&lt;ref&gt;For examples see arguments from the Human Rights Commission in their (2012) Report and also Amnesty International New Zealand, accessed at https://www.amnesty.org.nz/files/Amnesty_International_submission_UPR_New_Zealand_June_2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Public institutions may not have knowledge of the disadvantages and disparities their discriminatory systems and procedures are creating, but an ignorance of the “these unconscious practices serves to perpetuate disadvantage.”&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.rethinking.org.nz/assets/Maori%20and%20the%20CJS/04_Shadow_Report_on_CERD.pdf] Rethink website, as above.&lt;/ref&gt; This is best exemplified in the fact that academics have identified a specialised form of structural discrimination that has developed in New Zealand which provides for “inclusion in principle, through use of encompassing and inclusive speech," but is coupled, "with a resource-based exclusion supporting disparity in fact.”&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Commission (2012) Report, discussing analysis in James, Liu and Caren (2012), ‘The Medium shapes the Message: Marshall McLuhan and Grice Revisited in Race Talk On-line'.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, New Zealand has made some positive steps towards addressing the problem it has with structural discrimination. For example, following recommendations made by an ICESCR Committee in 2012 to address structural discrimination in public institutions, [[Iwi]] (Tribes) and the police have developed several strategies aimed at reducing victimisation among Māori.&lt;ref&gt;'New Zealand Police The Turning of the Tide – a Whanau Ora Crime and Crash Prevention Strategy', (2012), available at http://www.police.govt.nz/sites/default/files/resources/the-turning-of-the-tide-strategy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Regretfully [[Amnesty International Aotearoa New Zealand]] have found that, "similar strategies to address institutional bias are yet to be developed across all public service sectors, including health, education and justice.”&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International New Zealand Submission to UN UPR 2014: https://www.amnesty.org.nz/files/Amnesty_International_submission_UPR_New_Zealand_June_2013.pdf on 30/04/14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future directions===
It is well known that disparities in the enjoyment of human rights remains a complex issue in New Zealand that needs to be addressed with the collaboration and cooperation of civil society.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, CERD (2013) Report, accessed at http://www.converge.org.nz/pma/CERD-C-NZL-CO-18-20.pdf on 30/04/14.&lt;/ref&gt; When looking at the Waitangi Tribunal’s 2011 report ‘Ko Aotearoa Tenei’ the Human Rights Commission has stated that drawing on diverse cultural values and practices to inform more responsive social services that cater to the needs of different communities is a central part of addressing structural discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/HRC-Structural-Report_final_webV1.pdf] Human Rights Commission (2012) Report, at 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission has also stated that they support the recommendation made by the UN Committee Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to address structural discrimination that the Government set specific equality targets by year and closely monitor the achievement of these.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/HRC-Structural-Report_final_webV1.pdf] Human Rights Commission (2012) Report, at 49.&lt;/ref&gt; They go on to conclude that a failure to address the causes of New Zealand's socio-economic inequities is itself a form of structural discrimination and that the continuing gap in socio-economic indicators between ethnic groups underscores the need to tackle structural sources of inequality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/HRC-Structural-Report_final_webV1.pdf] Human Rights Commission (2012) Report, at 16.&lt;/ref&gt; As such the Commission suggest that a comprehensive policy approach should take into account and seek to address both structural barriers to equality and embedded social and economic factors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/HRC-Structural-Report_final_webV1.pdf] Human Rights Commission (2012) Report, at 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4799">'''Student financial aid''' in Finland consists of government payments (through [[Kela (Finnish institution)|Kela]]) that provide economic security to students and enable all students to study. Almost all Finnish students receive financial aid, including foreigners who are permanent residents or EU citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kela.fi/web/en/financial-aid-for-students-eligibility Financial aid for foreign students], Kela website&lt;/ref&gt; It is available in the form of:

* a study grant
* a government-backed student loan
* a housing supplement (starting 1 August 2017, available only to those who are studying abroad or enrolled in a tuition-based programme at a folk high school or sports institute and living in the school dormitory).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kela.fi/web/en/financial-aid-for-students Kela website]&lt;/ref&gt;
**students are egilible for general housing benefits &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kela.fi/web/en/housing-benefits]&lt;/ref&gt;

The qualifying conditions for student financial aid are:

* admission to a school
* full-time study
* academic progress
* need of financial assistance.

They are a kind of [[transfer payment]]. Similar systems, some of which are older, exist in some other countries where education is free of charge, e.g. [[Germany]] and [[Sweden]]. Student benefit is paid by the state to all qualifying students, excluding only those with full-time employment and income, and is thus distinct from an individually evaluated [[scholarship]].

In addition, Finnish students enjoy several kinds of student benefits such as:
* Partially state-funded meals at student cafeterias.

==Details==
Secondary and tertiary education is free of charge in Finland. Monetary support is paid by the government agency [[KELA (Finnish Social Insurance)|KELA]]. Most student financial aid is paid to students in tertiary education, but smaller amounts are available also on the secondary level. Student benefits are independent of parents' income in tertiary education for students over the age of 20 who live alone. In tertiary education, students in bachelor's and master's programmes qualify for financial aid. Only those months spent actively studying are supported; i.e. in summer, benefits cease unless a special summer studying plan is submitted and followed. 

For students in tertiary education, the figures are as follows. Direct monetary support for students over the age of 20 who live alone is [[€]]303.19 per month for those who have started their studies before autumn 2014 and €336.76 for people starting their education in autumn 2014 or later. Rent support is 80% of rent or maximum €201.60. The state or the universities generally do not provide student accommodation. Dormitories are usually run by foundations and student unions, and cannot accommodate all students. The state secures student loans (from private banks) for up to €400 per month. Student meals are supported by €1.94 per meal and available for example on (privately operated) student cafeterias on campus, thus the effective price is about €2-3.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kela.fi/web/en/financial-aid-for-students_study-grant&lt;/ref&gt;

Persistent failure to progress in studies ultimately leads to the termination of student benefits. Likewise, when evaluated on a yearly basis, income of over €660 per month on supported months and over €1,970 per month on unsupported months reduces the student benefit. Typically, nine months are supported and three summer months are not, which gives a maximum annual income of €11,850.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kela.fi/web/en/student-s-own-income&lt;/ref&gt;

The benefits were raised in 2008 and 2014: in 2008 the direct support was increased by 15% and the income limits were raised by 30%; in August 2014 the direct support was raised by approx. 1.3% for those already studying and 11% larger for those starting their studies in 2014 accompanied by a 5-month decrease in the period of financial aid and a €100 increase in the student loan security.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kela.fi/web/en/changes-as-of-1-august-2014&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, students often find the benefit insufficient, thus working while studying or spending the entire summer at summer jobs is popular. Student loans are less popular than elsewhere.

Student benefits are available to Finnish citizens. They are not available for students entering the country for the sole purpose of studying.

[[File:FORA Demonstration.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Demonstration by the Argentine syndicalist union [[Argentine Regional Workers' Federation|FORA]] in 1915]]
'''Syndicalism''' is a radical current in the labor movement, and was most active in the early 20th century. According to the Marxist historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]], it predominated the revolutionary left in the decade preceding World War I, as Marxism was mostly reformist at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Hobsbawm 1973, pg. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Major syndicalist organizations included the [[General Confederation of Labour (France)|General Confederation of Labor]] in France, the [[National Confederation of Labor]] in Spain, the [[Italian Syndicalist Union]], the [[Free Workers' Union of Germany]], and the [[Argentine Regional Workers' Federation]]. The [[Industrial Workers of the World]], the [[Irish Transport and General Workers' Union]], and the Canadian [[One Big Union (Canada)|One Big Union]], though they did not regard themselves as syndicalists, are considered by most historians to belong to this current. A number of syndicalist organizations were, and still are to this day, linked in the [[International Workers' Association]].

== Terminology ==
The term ''syndicalism'' has French origins. In French, a ''syndicat'' is a trade union, usually a local union. The corresponding words in Spanish and Portuguese, ''sindicato'', and Italian, ''sindacato'', are similar. By extension, the French ''syndicalisme'' refers to trade unionism in general.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 4, Thorpe 2010b, pg. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept ''syndicalisme révolutionnaire'' or ''revolutionary syndicalism'' emerged in French socialist journals in 1903&lt;ref&gt;Gervasoni 2006, pg. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; and the French [[General Confederation of Labour (France)|General Confederation of Labor]] (''Confédération générale du travail'', CGT) came to use the term to describe its brand of unionism. ''Revolutionary syndicalism'', or more commonly ''syndicalism'' with the ''revolutionary'' implied, was then adapted to a number of languages by unionists following the French model.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 4&amp;ndash;5, Thorpe 2010b, pg. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The transplantation of the term into languages in which the etymological link to ''unionism'' was lost, was frequently criticized. Opponents of syndicalism in Northern and Central Europe seized upon this to characterize it as something non-native, even dangerous. When the [[Free Association of German Trade Unions]] (''Freie Vereinigung deutscher Gewerkschaften'', FVdG) endorsed syndicalism in 1908, it did not at first use the term for fear of using "foreign names".&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2010b, pg. 25&amp;ndash;26.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many scholars, including Darlington, [[Marcel van der Linden]], and Wayne Thorpe, apply the term ''syndicalism'' to a number of organizations or currents within the labor movement that did not identify as ''syndicalist''. They apply the label to [[One Big Union (concept)|one big unionists]] or [[industrial unionism|industrial unionists]] in North America and Australia, [[James Larkin|Larkinists]] in Ireland, and groups that identify as revolutionary industrialists, revolutionary unionists, anarcho-syndicalists, or councilists. This includes the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) in the United States, for example, which claimed its industrial unionism was "a higher type of revolutionary labor organization than that proposed by the syndicalists". Van der Linden and Thorpe use ''syndicalism'' to refer to "all revolutionary, direct-actionist organizatons". Darlington proposes that syndicalism be defined as "revolutionary trade unionism".{{refn|group=note|He adds that this definition does not encompass communist or socialist unions, because the syndicalist conception "differed from both socialist and communist counterparts in viewing the decisive agency of the revolutionary transformation of society to be unions, as opposed to political parties or the state and of a collectivized worker-managed socio-economic order to be run by unions, as opposed to political parties or the state."&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;}} He and van der Linden argue that it is justified to group together such a wide range of organizations because their similar modes of action or practice outweigh their ideological differences.&lt;ref&gt;van der Linden/Thorpe 1990, pg. 1&amp;ndash;2, Darlington 2008, pg. 5&amp;ndash;7, van der Linden 1998, pg. 182&amp;ndash;183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, like Larry Peterson and Erik Olssen, disagree with this broad definition. According to Olssen, this understanding has a "tendency to blur the distinctions between industrial unionism, syndicalism, and revolutionary socialism".&lt;ref&gt;Olssen 1992, pg. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Peterson gives a more restrictive definition of ''syndicalism'' based on five criteria: 
#a preference for federalism over centralism,
#opposition to political parties,
#seeing the general strike as the supreme revolutionary weapon,
#favoring the replacement of the state by "a federal, economic organization of society",
#and seeing unions as the basic building blocks of a post-capitalist society.
This definition excludes the IWW and the Canadian [[One Big Union (Canada)|One Big Union]] (OBU). Peterson proposes the broader category ''revolutionary industrial unionism'' to encompass syndicalism, groups like the IWW and the OBU, and others. The defining commonality between these groups is that they sought to unite all workers in a general organization.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson 1981, pg. 53&amp;ndash;56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Syndicalism originated in France and spread from there. The French CGT was the model and inspiration for syndicalist groups throughout Europe and the world.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2010b, pg. 17&amp;ndash;18.&lt;/ref&gt; Revolutionary industrial unionism, part of syndicalism in the broader sense, originated with the IWW in the United States and then caught on in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Cole/Struthers/Zimmer 2017, pg. 2&amp;ndash;3.&lt;/ref&gt; In a number of countries, however, certain syndicalist practices and ideas predate the coining of the term in France or the founding of the IWW. In Bert Altena's view, a number of movements in Europe can be called syndicalist, even before 1900. According to the English social historian [[E.P. Thompson]] and the anarcho-syndicalist theorist [[Rudolf Rocker]], there were syndicalist tendencies in Britain's labor movement as early as the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;Altena 2010, pg. 197, Zimmer 2018, pg. 353.&lt;/ref&gt; Syndicalists saw themselves as the heirs of the [[First International]], the international socialist organization formed in 1864, particularly its anti-authoritarian wing led by [[Mikhail Bakunin]]. Bakunin and his followers advocated the general strike, rejected electoral politics, and anticipated workers' organizations replacing rule by the state.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 1989, pg. 1&amp;ndash;2, 5&amp;ndash;6, Zimmer 2018, 353&amp;ndash;354.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Lucien van der Walt]], the [[Spanish Regional Federation|Spanish section of the First International]], formed in 1870, was in fact syndicalist.&lt;ref&gt;van der Walt 2018, pg. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; Kenyon Zimmer sees a "proto-syndicalism" in the influence the anarchist-led [[International Working People's Association]] (IWPA) and [[Central Labor Union (Chicago)|Central Labor Union]], which originated in the American section of the First International, had in the Chicago labor movement of the 1880s. They were involved in the nationwide struggle for an [[eight-hour day]]. On May 3, 1886, the police killed three striking workers at a demonstration in Chicago. Seven policemen and four workers were killed the following day when someone, possibly an IWPA member, threw a bomb at the police. Four anarchists were eventually executed for allegedly conspiring with the man who threw the bomb. The [[Haymarket Affair]], as these events become known, led anarchists and labor organizers, including syndicalists, in both the United States and Europe to re-evaluate the revolutionary meaning of the general strike.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer 2018, pg. 354&amp;ndash;358.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Anarchist dominance in Latin American labor movements --&gt;

According to [[Émile Pouget]], a French anarchist and CGT leader, from "the United States, the idea of the general strike{{spaced ndash}} fertilized by the blood of anarchists hanged in Chicago [...]{{spaced ndash}} was imported to France".&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer 2018, pg. 357&amp;ndash;358.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1890s, French anarchists, conceding that individual action such as assassinations had failed, turned their focus to the labor movement. They were able to gain influence, particularly in the ''[[bourses du travail]]'', which served as [[labor exchange]]s, meeting places for unions, and [[trades council]]s and organized in a national federation in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley 1970, pg. 43&amp;ndash;44, 65&amp;ndash;66, Mitchell 1990, pg. 27&amp;ndash;28.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, the CGT was formed as a rival to the ''bourses'', but was at first much weaker. From the start, it advocated the general strike and aimed to unite all workers. Pouget, who was active in the CGT, supported the use of sabotage and direct action. In 1902, the ''bourses'' merged into the CGT.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley 1970, pg. 67&amp;ndash;70, Mitchell 1990, pg. 28&amp;ndash;29.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, the federation adopted the [[Charter of Amiens]], which reaffirmed the CGT's independence from party politics and fixed the goal of uniting all French workers.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1990, pg. 33&amp;ndash;34, Ridley 1970, pg. 88&amp;ndash;92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, the Industrial Workers of the World were formed in the United States by the [[Western Federation of Miners]], the [[American Labor Union]], and a broad coalition of socialists, anarchists, and labor unionists. Its base was mostly in the Western US where labor conflicts were most violent and workers therefore radicalized.&lt;ref&gt;Dubofsky 1969, pg. 36&amp;ndash;37, 81&amp;ndash;82, Zimmer 2018, pg. 359.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Wobblies insisted their union was a distinctly American form of labor organization and not an import of European syndicalism, the IWW was syndicalist in the broader sense of the word. According to [[Melvyn Dubofsky]] and most other IWW historians, the IWW's industrial unionism was the specifically American form of syndicalism.&lt;ref&gt;Dubofsky 1969, 147&amp;ndash;148, 169&amp;ndash;170, Peterson 1981, pg. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the IWW also had a presence in Canada and Mexico nearly from its inception, as the US economy and labor force was intertwined with those countries.&lt;ref&gt;Cole/Struthers/Zimmer 2017, pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Émile Pouget.jpg|thumb|right|French syndicalist leader Émile Pouget]]
French syndicalism and American industrial unionism influenced the rise of syndicalism elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer 2018, pg. 359.&lt;/ref&gt; Syndicalist movements and organizations in a number of countries were established by activists who had spent time in France. [[Ervin Szabó]] visited Paris in 1904 and then established a Syndicalist Propaganda Group in his native Hungary in 1910. Several of the founders of the Spanish CNT had visited France. [[Alceste de Ambris]] and [[Armando Borghi]], both leaders in Italy's USI, were in Paris for a few months from 1910 to 1911. French influence also spread through publications. Emile Pouget's pamphlets could be read in Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, English, German, and Swedish translations. Journals and newspapers in a number of countries advocated syndicalism. For example, '' L'Action directe'', a journal mainly for miners in [[Charleroi]], Belgium, urged its readers to follow "the example of our confederated friends of France".&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2010b, pg. 20&amp;ndash;23.&lt;/ref&gt; The IWW's newspapers published articles on French syndicalism, particularly the tactic of sabotage and the CGT's ''[[La Vie Ouvrière]]'' carried articles about Britain's labor movement by the British syndicalist [[Tom Mann]].&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 90&amp;ndash;91.&lt;/ref&gt; Migration played a key role in spreading syndicalist ideas. The [[Argentine Regional Workers' Federation]] (''Federación Obrera Regional Argentina'', FORA), openly anarchist by 1905, was formed by Italian and Spanish immigrants in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer 2013, pg. 2, Thompson 1990, pg. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Many IWW leaders were European immigrants, including [[Edmondo Rossoni]] who moved between the United States and Italy and was active in both the IWW and USI.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; International work processes also contributed to the diffusion of syndicalism. For example, sailors helped establish IWW presences in port cities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Syndicalists formed different kinds of organizations. Some, like the French radicals, worked within existing unions to infuse them with their revolutionary spirit. Some found existing unions entirely unsuitable and built federations of their own, a strategy known as ''dual unionism''. American syndicalists formed the IWW, though [[William Z. Foster]] later abandoned the IWW after a trip to France and set up the [[Syndicalist League of North America]] (SLNA), which sought to radicalize the established [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL). In Ireland, the ITGWU broke away from a more moderate, and British-based, union. In Italy and Spain, syndicalists initially worked within the established union confederations before breaking away and forming USI and the CNT respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 31&amp;ndash;32.&lt;/ref&gt; In Norway, there were both the Norwegian Trade Union Opposition (''Norske Fagopposition'', NFO), syndicalists working within the mainstream [[Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions]] (''Landsorganisasjonen i Norge'' in Norwegian, LO), and the Norwegian Syndicalist Federation (''Norsk Syndikalistik Federation'' in Norwegian, NSF), an independent syndicalist organization set up by the Swedish SAC.&lt;ref&gt;Persson 1990, pg. 94&amp;ndash;95.&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, there was a similar conflict between ISEL and the [[Industrial Workers of Great Britain|local IWW organization]].&lt;ref&gt;Challinor 1977, pg. XXX, Darlington 2008, pg. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1914, there were syndicalist national labor confederations in Peru,&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch 2010, pg. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil,&lt;ref&gt;Toledo/Biondi 2010, pg. 367.&lt;/ref&gt; Argentina,&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1990, pg. 169, van der Linden/Thorpe 1990, pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;Hart 1990, pg. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Spain, Italy, and France, while Belgian syndicalists were in the process of forming one.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2010b, pg. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also groups advocating syndicalism in Russia,&lt;ref&gt;Avrich 1967, pg. 78&amp;ndash;79&lt;/ref&gt; Japan,&lt;ref&gt;Crump 1993, pg. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;, the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; Portugal, Norway, Denmark, Hungary, and Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2010b, pg. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of North America, the IWW also had organizations in Australia,&lt;ref&gt;Burgmann 1995, pg. XXX.&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand, where it was part of the [[New Zealand Federation of Labour (1909)|Federation of Labour]] (FOL),&lt;ref&gt;Olssen 1988, pg. XXX.&lt;/ref&gt; Great Britain, though its membership had imploded by 1913,&lt;ref&gt;Challinor 1977, pg. XXX, Darlington 2008, pg. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;van der Walt 2010, pg. 58&amp;ndash;59.&lt;/ref&gt; In Ireland, syndicalism took the form of the ITGWU, which espoused a mix of industrial unionism and socialist [[Irish republicanism|republicanism]], and was labeled Larkinism.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor 2010, pg. 194&amp;ndash;196, 199, 202&amp;ndash;204, 213, Darlington 2008, pg. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reasons===
Scholars have given several explanations for the emergence of syndicalism. [[Werner Sombart]], a German economist and sociologist, commenting in 1905, ascribes the rise of syndicalism to the Italian and particularly the French mentality. He writes: "The only people who could possibly act up to such a system of teaching are Frenchmen and Italians. They are generally men who do things impulsively [...],  who are seized upon by a sudden passionate enthusiasm [...], but they have little application, perseverance, calm or steadiness."&lt;ref&gt;Sombart 1909, pg. 110&amp;ndash;111.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a significant uptick in workers' radicalism in most developed capitalist countries from 1911 to 1922, though they relented during World War I. Strikes increased in frequency, numbers of workers involved, and duration. According to van der Linden and Thorpe, syndicalism was only one way this radicalization expressed itself.&lt;ref&gt;Screpanti 1984, pg. 512&amp;ndash;513, van der Linden/Thorpe 1990, pg. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, for example, the period from 1910 to 1914 became known as the [[Great Labour Unrest]]. Many historians see syndicalism as a consequence of this unrest, but [[Elie Halévy]] and the politician [[Lord Robert Cecil]] claim it was its cause. Employers in France likewise blamed an upsurge in workers' militancy in the same period on syndicalist leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2013, pg. 38&amp;ndash;39.&lt;/ref&gt; Syndicalism was further encouraged by employers' hostility to workers' actions.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 55&amp;ndash;56.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to van der Linden and Thorpe, workers' radicalization manifested itself in their rejection of the dominant strategies in the, mostly socialist, labor movement, which was led by reformist trade unions and socialist parties. Lenin posited that "revolutionary syndicalism in many countries was a direct and inevitable result of opportunism, reformism and parliamentary cretinism." A feeling that ideological disputes were draining workers' power led Dutch, French, and American syndicalist organizations to declare themselves independent of any political groups. In countries like Italy, Spain, and Ireland, which was still under British rule, parliamentary politics were not seen as a serious means for workers to express their grievances. Most workers were disenfranchised. Yet even in France or Britain, where most male workers had the right to vote, many workers did not trust party politics. The enormous numerical growth of well-organized socialist parties, such as in Germany and Italy, did not, in the minds of many workers, correlate with any real advance in the class struggle as these parties were thought to be overly concerned with building the parties themselves and with electoral politics than with the class struggle and had therefore lost their original revolutionary edge. The socialists preached the inevitability of socialism, but were in practice bureaucratic and reformist. Similarly, the trade unions frequently allied with those parties, equally growing in numbers, were denounced for their expanding bureaucracies, their centralization, and for failing to represent workers' interests. For example, between 1902 and 1913 the German [[Free Trade Unions (Germany)|free trade unions]]'s membership grew by 350% but its bureaucracy by more than 1900%.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 57&amp;ndash;61, van der Linden/Thorpe 1990, pg. 12&amp;ndash;14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common explanation for the rise of syndicalism that it is a result of the economic backwardness of the countries in which it emerged, particularly France. Newer studies have questioned this account.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 50&amp;ndash;52.&lt;/ref&gt; The economist [[Ernesto Screpanti]] hypothesized that strike waves such as the one from 1911 to 1922 generally occur during the upper turning-points of the periodic global long [[business cycle|cycles of boom and bust]] known as [[Kondratieff waves]]. Such waves of proletarian insurgency, claims Screpanti, were global in reach, saw workers breaking free of the dynamics of the capitalist system, and aimed to overthrow that system.&lt;ref&gt;Screpanti 1984, pg. 516&amp;ndash;519, 544&amp;ndash;545.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to van der Linden and Thorpe, changes in labor processes also contributed to the radicalization of workers and thereby to the rise of syndicalism. This rise took place during the [[Second Industrial Revolution]]. Two groups of workers were most attracted to syndicalism: casual or seasonal laborers who frequently changed jobs and workers whose occupations were being as a result of technological advances. The first group includes landless agricultural workers, construction workers, and dockers, all of whom were disproportionately represented in several countries' syndicalist movements. Because they frequently changed jobs, such workers did not have close relationships with their employers and the risk of losing one's job as a result of a strike was reduced. Moreover, because of the time constraints of their jobs they were forced to act immediately in order to achieve anything and could not plan for the long term by building up strike funds or powerful labor organizations or by engaging in mediation. Their working conditions gave them an inclination to engage in direct confrontation with employers and apply direct action. The second group includes miners, railway employees, and certain factory workers. Their occupations were [[Deskilling|deskilled]] by technological and organizational changes. These changes made workers from the second group similar in some respects to the first group. They did not entirely result from the introduction of new technology, but were also caused by changes in management methods. This included increased supervision of workers, [[piecework]], internal promotions, all designed make workers docile and loyal and to transfer knowledge and control over the process of production from workers to employers. Frustration with this loss of power led to formal and informal resistance by workers.&lt;ref&gt;van der Linden/Thorpe 1990, pg. 4, 7&amp;ndash;11.&lt;/ref&gt; Altena disagrees with this explanation. According to him, it was workers with significant autonomy in their jobs and pride in their skills who were most attracted to syndicalism. Moreover, he argues, explanations based on workers' occupations cannot explain why only a minority of workers in those jobs became syndicalists or why in some professions workers in different locations had vastly different patterns of organization. The small size of many syndicalist unions also makes observations about which workers joined statistically irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;Altena 2010, pg. 205&amp;ndash;207.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hornsbergshage 1909.jpg|thumb|right|Meeting during the 1909 general strike in Sweden]]
Syndicalism came to be seen as a viable strategy because the general strike became a practical possibility. Although it had been advocated before, there were not sufficient numbers of wage workers to bring society to a standstill and they had not achieved a sufficient degree of organization and solidarity until the 1890s, according van der Linden and Thorpe. Several general or political strikes then took place before World War: [[Belgian general strike of 1893|in 1893]] and [[Belgian general strike of 1902|in 1902]] in Belgium, [[Swedish general strike of 1902|in 1902]] and [[Swedish general strike|in 1909]] in Sweden, [[Railroad strikes of 1903 in the Netherlands|in 1903]] in the Netherlands, [[1904 Italian general strike|in 1904]] in Italy in addition to significant work stoppages during the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]].&lt;ref&gt;van der Linden/Thorpe 1990, pg. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Darlington cites the significance of the conscious intervention by syndicalist militants. The industrial unrest of the period created conditions which made workers receptive to syndicalist leaders' agitation. They spread their ideas through pamphlets and newspapers and had considerable influence in a number of labor disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 82&amp;ndash;85.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, van der Linden and Thorpe point to spatial and geographical factors that shaped the rise of syndicalism. Workers who would otherwise not have had an inclination to syndicalism joined because syndicalism was dominant in their locales. Workers in the Canadian and American West for example, were generally more radical and drawn to the IWW and One Big Union than their counterparts in the East. Similarly, southern workers were more drawn to syndicalism in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;van der Linden/Thorpe 1990, pg. 15&amp;ndash;16.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Altena, the emergence of syndicalism must be analyzed at the level of local communities. Only differences in local social and economic structures explain why some towns had a strong syndicalist presence, but others did not.&lt;ref&gt;Altena 2010, pg. 209&amp;ndash;214.&lt;/ref&gt;

 --&gt;

==Principles==
Syndicalism was not informed by theory or a systematically elaborated ideology the same way socialism was by [[Marxism]]. [[Émile Pouget]], a CGT leader, maintained that: "What sets syndicalism apart from the various schools of socialism{{spaced ndash}} and makes it superior{{spaced ndash}} is its doctrinal sobriety. Inside the unions, there is little philosophising. They do better than that: they act!" Similarly, [[Andreu Nin]] of the Spanish CNT proclaimed in 1919: "I am a fanatic of action, of revolution. I believe in actions more than in remote ideologies and abstract questions." Though workers' education was important at least to committed activists, syndicalists distrusted bourgeois intellectuals, wanting to maintain workers' control over the movement. Syndicalist thinking was elaborated in pamphlets, leaflets, speeches, and articles and in the movement's own newspapers. These writings consisted mainly in calls to action and discussions of tactics in class struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 18&amp;ndash;20, Thorpe 1989, pg. 14&amp;ndash;15.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Georges Sorel]]'s ''[[Reflections on Violence]]'' introduced syndicalist ideas to a broader audience. Sorel fancied himself the premier theorist of syndicalism and was frequently thought of as such, but he was not a part of the movement and his influence on syndicalism was insignificant, except in Italy and Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 18, Chwedoruk 2010, pg. 142, Ridley 1970, pg. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent to which syndicalist positions reflected merely the views of leaders and to what extent those positions were shared by syndicalist organizations' rank-and-file is a matter of dispute. The historian [[Peter Stearns]], commenting on French syndicalism, concludes that most workers did not identify with syndicalism's long-range goals and that syndicalist hegemony accounts for the relatively slow growth of the French labor movement as a whole. Workers who joined the syndicalist movement, he claims, were on the whole indifferent to doctrinal questions, their membership in syndicalist organizations was partly accidental and leaders were unable to convert workers to syndicalist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns 1971, pg. 35&amp;ndash;38, 100&amp;ndash;101.&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick Ridley, a political scientist, is more equivocal. According to him, leaders were very influential in the drafting of syndicalist ideas, but syndicalism was more than a mere tool of a few leaders, but a genuine product of the French labor movement.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley 1970, pg. 182&amp;ndash;184.&lt;/ref&gt; Darlington adds that in the Irish ITGWU most members were won over by the union's philosophy of direct action.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Bert Altena argues that, though evidence of ordinary workers' convictions is scant, it indicates that they were aware of doctrinal differences between various currents in the labor movement and able to defend their own views. He points out that they likely understood syndicalist newspapers and debated political issues.&lt;ref&gt;Altena 2010, pg. 189&amp;ndash;190.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Syndicalism'' is used by some interchangeably with ''[[anarcho-syndicalism]]''. This term was first used in 1907, by socialists criticizing the political neutrality of the CGT, although it was rarely used until the early 1920s when communists used it disparagingly. Only from 1922 was it used by self-avowed anarcho-syndicalists.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2009, pg. 29&amp;ndash;30, 32&amp;ndash;33, Thorpe 2010b, pg. 17, Berry 2002, pg. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Syndicalism has traditionally been seen as a current within anarchism,&lt;ref&gt;McKay 2012, pg. 97, Darlington 2009, pg. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; but in some countries it was dominated by Marxists rather than anarchists. This was the case in Italy and much of the Anglophone world, including Ireland where anarchists had no significant influence on syndicalism.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor 2010, pg. 195, Zimmer 2018, pg. 360.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which syndicalist doctrine was a product of anarchism is debated. The anarchist Iain McKay argues that ''syndicalism'' is but a new name for ideas and tactics developed by Bakunin and the anarchist wing of the First International, while it is wholly inconsistent with positions Marx and Engels took. According to him, the fact that many Marxists embraced syndicalism merely indicates that they abandoned Marx's views and converted to Bakunin's.&lt;ref&gt;McKay 2021, pg. 97&amp;ndash;98.&lt;/ref&gt; Altena too views syndicalism as part of the broader anarchist movement, but concedes there was a tension between this and the fact that it was also a labor movement. He also sees Marxist ideas reflected in the movement, as leading syndicalists such as [[Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis|F. Domela Nieuwenhuis]] and [[Christiaan Cornelissen]] as well as much of the Australian syndicalist movement were influenced by them, as well as older socialist notions.&lt;ref&gt;Altena 2010, pg. 188, 191&amp;ndash;194.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Darlington, anarchism, Marxism, and revolutionary trade unionism equally contributed to syndicalism, in addition to various influences in specific countries, including [[Blanquism]], [[anti-clericalism]], [[republicanism]], and [[Peasant movement|agrarian radicalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2009, pg. 46&amp;ndash;48.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critique of capitalism and the state===
[[File:Pyramid of Capitalist System.png|thumb|right|The ''Pyramid of Capitalist System'' from 1911 illustrates the IWW's critique of capitalism.]]
[[Bill Haywood]], a leading figure in the IWW, defined the union's purpose at [[First Convention of the Industrial Workers of the World|its founding congress]] as "the emancipation of the working class from the slave bondage of capitalism". Syndicalists held that society was divided into two great classes, the working class and the bourgeoisie. Their interests being irreconcilable, they must be in a constant state of [[class struggle]]. [[Tom Mann]], a British syndicalist, declared that "the object of the unions is to wage the Class War". This war, according to syndicalist doctrine, was aimed not just at gaining concessions such as higher wages or a shorter working day, but at the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg 21&amp;ndash;22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Syndicalists agreed with [[Karl Marx]]'s characterization of the [[State (polity)|state]] as the "executive committee of the ruling class". They held that a society's economic order determined its political order and concluded that the former could not be overthrown by changes to the latter. Nevertheless, a number of leading syndicalist figures worked in political parties and some ran for elected office. [[Jim Larkin]], the leader of the Irish ITGWU, was active in the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]], Haywood in the [[Socialist Party of America]]. Yet, they saw the economic sphere as the primary arena for revolutionary struggle, while involvement in politics could at best be an "echo" of industrial struggle. They were skeptical of parliamentary politics. According to Father [[Thomas Hagerty]], a Catholic priest and IWW leader, "dropping pieces of paper into a hole in a box never did achieve emancipation for the working class, and to my thinking it will never achieve it". Syndicalist trade unions declared their political neutrality and autonomy from political parties. Political parties, syndicalists reasoned, grouped people according to their political views, uniting members of different classes. Unions, on the other hand, were to be purely working-class organizations, uniting the entire class, and could therefore not be divided on political grounds. The French syndicalist Pouget explained: "The CGT embraces{{spaced ndash}} outside of all the schools of politics{{spaced ndash}} all workers cognisant of the struggle to be waged for the elimination of wage-slavery and the employer class." In practice, however, this neutrality was more ambiguous. The CGT, for example, worked with the Socialist Party in the struggle  against the [[Conscription in France|Three-Year Law]], which extended conscription. During the [[Spanish Civil War]] the CNT, whose policy barred anyone who had been a candidate for political office or had participated in political endeavors from representing it, was intimately connected with the [[Iberian Anarchist Federation]] (''Federación Anarquista Ibérica'', FAI).&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 22&amp;ndash;28.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1906 - Grève pour les 8 heures.jpg|thumb|right|''Bourse du travail'' in Paris during a strike for the eight-hour day in 1906]]
In the syndicalist conception, unions played a dual role. They were organs of struggle within capitalism for better working conditions, but they were also to play a key role in the revolution to overthrow capitalism. [[Victor Griffuelhes]] expressed this at the CGT's 1906 congress in the following manner: "In its day-to-day demands, syndicalism seeks the co-ordination of workers' efforts, the increase of workers' well-being by the achievement of immediate improvements, such as the reduction of working hours, the increase of wages, etc. But this task is only one aspect of the work of syndicalism; it prepares for complete emancipation, which can be realised only by expropriating the capitalist class". For unions to fulfill this role, it was necessary to prevent bureaucrats{{spaced ndash}} "whose sole purpose in life seems to be apologising for and defending the capitalist system of exploitation", according to Larkin{{spaced ndash}} from inhibiting workers' militant zeal. Battling bureaucracy and reformism within the labor movement was a major theme for syndicalists. One expression of this was many syndicalists' rejection of [[collective bargaining agreements]], which were thought to force labor peace upon workers and break their solidarity. The Wobblie [[Vincent St. John]] declared: "There is but one bargain that the Industrial Workers of the World will make with the employing class{{spaced ndash}} complete surrender of the means of production." The [[Argentine Regional Workers' Federation]] (''Federación Obrera Regional Argentina'', FORA) and the OBU did, however, accept such deals and others began accepting them eventually. Similarly, syndicalist unions did not work to build large strike funds, for fear that they would create bureaucracy separate from the rank-and-file and instill in workers the expectation that the union rather than they would wage the class struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 28&amp;ndash;31, van der Linden/Thorpe 1990, pg. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anarchist black cat.svg|thumb|right|Wobblies used the black cat as a symbol for sabotage.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Syndicalists advocated [[direct action]], including [[working to rule]], passive resistance, sabotage, and strikes, particularly the [[general strike]], as tactics in the class struggle, as opposed to indirect action such as electoral politics. The IWW engaged in around 30 mostly successful civil disobedience campaigns they deemed [[free speech fights]]. Wobblies would defy laws restricting public speeches, in order to clog up prisons and court systems as a result of hundreds of arrests, ultimately forcing public officials to rescind such laws. Sabotage ranged from slow or inefficient work to destruction of machinery and physical violence. French railway and postal workers cut telegraph and signal lines during strikes in 1909 and 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 32&amp;ndash;39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final step towards revolution, according to syndicalists, would be a [[general strike]]. It would be "the curtain drop on a tired old scene of several centuries, and the curtain raising on another", according to Griffuelhes.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 39&amp;ndash;42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Syndicalists remained vague about the society they envisioned to replace capitalism, claiming that it was impossible to foresee in detail. Labor unions were seen as being the embryo of a new society in addition to being the means of struggle within the old. Syndicalists generally agreed that in a free society production would be managed by workers. The state apparatus would be replaced by the rule of workers' organizations. In such a society individuals would be liberated, both in the economic sphere but also in their private and social lives.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 42&amp;ndash;45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender===
&lt;!-- [[File:Elizabeth Gurley Flynn point.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]], a Wobbly organizer]] --&gt;
Syndicalist policies on gender issues were mixed. The CNT did not admit women as members until 1918. The CGT dismissed feminism as a bourgeois movement. Syndicalists were mostly indifferent to the question of [[women's suffrage]]. [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]], an IWW organizer, insisted that women "find their power at the point of production where they work", rather than at the ballot box.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 105&amp;ndash;106.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 230 delegates present at the founding of Canada's One Big Union, a mere 3 were women. When a female radical criticized the masculinist atmosphere at the meeting, she was rebuffed by men who insisted that labor only concern itself with class rather than gender issues.&lt;ref&gt;McCallum 1998, pg. 15&amp;ndash;16.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Todd McCallum concludes that syndicalists in the OBU advocated values of "radical manhood".&lt;ref&gt;McCallum 1998, pg. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

--&gt;
Syndicalists were involved in a number strikes, labor disputes, and other struggles. In the United States, the IWW was involved in at least 150 strikes including [[Goldfield, Nevada labor troubles of 1906-1907|miners' strikes]] in [[Goldfield, Nevada|Goldfield]], Nevada in 1906&amp;ndash;1907, a [[Pressed Steel Car strike of 1909|steel workers' strike]] in [[McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania|McKees Rocks]], Pennsylvania in 1909, a [[1912 Lawrence textile strike|textile workers' strike]] in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts|Lawrence]], Massachusetts, [[The Brotherhood of Timber Workers|timber workers' strikes]] in Louisiana and Arkansas in 1912&amp;ndash;1913, and a [[1913 Paterson silk strike|silk workers' strike]] in [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], New Jersey. The most prominent was the struggle in Lawrence. Wobblie leaders brought together 23,000 mostly immigrant workers, many of whom did not speak English. They arranged for workers' children to be sent to live with sympathetic families outside of Lawrence for the duration of the strike so their parents could focus on the struggle. Unlike most IWW-led strikes, the struggle was successful.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 62&amp;ndash;63, 86&amp;ndash;87, Dubofsky 1969, pg. 120&amp;ndash;125, 202&amp;ndash;208, 210&amp;ndash;220, 227&amp;ndash;283.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- To-do: Read up details on Southern timber strikes  --&gt; In Mexico, syndicalism first emerged in 1906 during a violent [[Cananea strike|miners' strike]] in [[Cananea]]  and an even more violent [[Río Blanco strike|textile workers' strike]] in [[Río Blanco, Veracruz|Río Blanco]], Veracruz. In 1912, during the 1910&amp;ndash;1920 [[Mexican Revolution]], anarchists formed the syndicalist union [[Casa del Obrero Mundial|House of the World Worker]] (''Casa del Obrero Mundial''). It led a series of successful strikes in 1913 in Mexico City and central Mexico. After the [[Constitutionalist Army]] occupied the capital in 1914, syndicalists allied with the government it established to defeat rural forces such as the [[Liberation Army of the South|Zapatistas]] and therefore received government support. Once those forces had been suppressed, this alliance broke apart and the ''Casa'' campaigned for workers' control of factories and the nationalization of foreign capital. It contributed to a rise in labor unrest that began in mid-1915. It led general strikes [[May 1916 Mexico general strike|in May]] and [[July–August Mexico general strike|in July–August]] 1916 in greater Mexico City. The latter was quelled by the army, marking the defeat of the ''Casa'', which was also suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;Hart 1990, pg. 188&amp;ndash;199.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Portugal, the [[5 October 1910 revolution|deposition of the King]] in 1910 was followed by a strike wave throughout the country. After the police occupied the offices of an agricultural union, syndicalists called for a general strike. During the strike, Lisbon was controlled by workers and there were armed uprisings in several other cities. In 1912, the strike wave ebbed off.&lt;ref&gt;Bayerlein/van der Linden 1990, pg. 157&amp;ndash;158.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish CNT, shortly after its first congress, participated in [[1911 Spanish general strike|a general strike]]. It was accused of having instigated the strike, but it is unclear to what extent it was responsible. In any case, the CNT was banned by the state for its role.&lt;ref&gt;Bar 1990, pg. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

British Wobblies were involved in two major strikes in Scotland, one at [[Argyll Motor Works]] and the second at a [[Singer Corporation|Singer's sewing machine factory]] in [[Clydebank]]. In 1906, several industrial unionists began to spread their ideas and organize workers at Singer's.  In 1911, they organized [[Red Clydeside#1911 strike at Singer|a strike]] after a woman was fired for not working hard enough. The strike was cleverly defeated by management and most activists lost their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Challinor 1977, pg. XXX.&lt;/ref&gt; The ISEL leader Tom Mann was also at the center of several labor disputes during the Great Labour Unrest, including the [[1911 Liverpool general transport strike]] where he chaired the  strike committee.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2013, pg. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In Ireland, Jim Larkin and the ITGWU led 20,000 during the 1913 [[Dublin lockout]]. After the ITGWU attempted to unionize [[Dublin United Tramway Company|Dublin's trams]] and tram workers went on strike, the city's employers threatened to fire any workers who did not sign a pledge to not support the ITGWU, thereby turning the dispute into a city-wide conflict in late September. Workers' resistance crumbled in January 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2013, pg. 42, O'Connor 2010, pg. 205&amp;ndash;207&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Congress london 1913.jpg|thumb|right|A session of the First International Syndicalist Congress in 1913]]
There was no international syndicalist organization prior to World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 1989, pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, CGT activists presented the Charter of Amiens and syndicalism to an international audience a higher form of anarchism at the [[International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam]] in 1907. Discussions at the Congress led to the formation of the international syndicalist journal ''[[Bulletin international du mouvement syndicaliste]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2010b, pg. 32, 34, Altena 2010, pg. 185&lt;/ref&gt; The CGT was affiliated with the [[International Secretariat of National Trade Union Centers]] (ISNTUC), which brought together reformist socialist unions. Both the Dutch NAS and the British ISEL attempted to remedy the lack of a syndicalist counterpart to ISNTUC in 1913, simultaneously publishing calls for an international syndicalist congress in 1913. The CGT rejected the invitation. Its leaders feared that leaving ISNTUC, which it intended to revolutionize from within, would split the CGT and harm working class unity. The IWW also did not participate, as it considered itself an international in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;Lehning 1982, pg. 77&amp;ndash;78, Thorpe 1989, pg. 53&amp;ndash;54.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[First International Syndicalist Congress]] was held in London from September 27 to October 2. It was attended by 38 delegates from 65 organizations in Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Cuba, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.{{refn|group=note|The CGT's absence led the ''[[New Statesman]]'' to liken the Congress to "to playing ''Hamlet'' without the Prince of Denmark".&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 1989, pg. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Discussions were contentious and did not lead to the founding of a syndicalist international. Delegates did agree on a declaration of principles describing syndicalism's core tenets. They also decided to launch an International Syndicalist Information Bureau and to hold another congress in Amsterdam. This congress did not take place due to the outbreak of World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Lehning 1982, pg. 78&amp;ndash;80, Thorpe 1989, pg. 69, 72, 75&amp;ndash;76, 79&amp;ndash;80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===
Syndicalists had long opposed nationalism and militarism. Haywood held that "it is better to be a traitor to your country than to your class". French syndicalists viewed the Army as the primary defender of the capitalist order. In 1901, the CGT published a manual for soldiers encouraging desertion. Similarly, in 1911 British syndicalists distributed an "Open Letter to British Soldiers" imploring them not to shoot on striking workers, but to join the working class's struggle against capital. Patriotism, syndicalists argued, was a means of integrating workers into capitalist society by distracting them from their true class interest. In 1908, the CGT's congress invoked the slogan of the First International, proclaiming that the "workers have no fatherland".&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 45&amp;ndash;47.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Christian-cornelissen.jpg|thumb|right|Christiaan Cornelissen, a Dutch anarcho-syndicalist who supported World War I]]
When World War I broke out in July 1914, socialist parties and trade unions{{spaced ndash}} both in neutral and belligerent countries{{refn|group=note|Russian, Serbian, and Italian socialists did not.&lt;ref&gt;Eley 2002, pg. 125, 127.&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{spaced ndash}} supported their respective nations' war efforts or national defense, despite previous pledges to do the opposite. Socialists agreed to put aside class conflict and vote for [[War bond|war credits]]. German socialists argued that war was necessary to defend against Russia's barbaric [[Tsarism]], while their French counterparts pointed to the need to defend against Prussian militarism and the German "instinct of domination and of discipline". This collaboration between the socialist movement and the state was known as the ''[[union sacrée]]'' in France, the ''[[Burgfriedenspolitik|Burgfrieden]]'' in Germany, and ''[[godsvrede]]'' in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Eley 2002, pg. 125&amp;ndash;127, Thorpe 2006, pg. 1005, Thorpe 2010a, pg. 24&amp;ndash;27.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, a number of anarchists led by [[Peter Kropotkin]], including the influential syndicalist Christiaan Cornelissen, issued the [[Manifesto of the Sixteen]], supporting the Allied cause in the war.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 47, Thorpe 1989, pg. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Most syndicalists, however, remained true to their internationalist and anti-militarist principles by opposing the war and their respective nation's participation in it.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2006, pg. 983.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the French CGT and a sizable minority in the Italian USI did not.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2006, pg. 984.&lt;/ref&gt; The CGT had long had a moderate, reformist wing, which gained the upper hand. As a result, according to historians like Darlington or van der Linden and Thorpe, the CGT was no longer a revolutionary syndicalist organization after the start of World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2006, pg. 990, van der Linden/Thorpe 1990, pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; It followed the French president's call for national unity by agreeing to a no-strike pledge and to resolve labor disputes through arbitration and by actively participating in the French war effort. Most of the its members of military age were conscripted without resistance and its ranks shrank from 350,000 in 1913 to 49,000 dues-paying members in 1915. CGT leaders defended this course by arguing that France's war against Germany was a war between democracy and republicanism on the one side and barbaric militarism on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2006, pg. 992.&lt;/ref&gt; Italy did not initially participate in World War I, which was deeply unpopular in the country, when it broke out. The [[Italian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] and the reformist [[Italian General Confederation of Labour|General Confederation of Labor]] opposed Italian intervention in the Great War. Once Italy became a participant, the socialists refused to support the war effort, but also refrained from working against it. From the start of the war, even before Italy did so, a minority within USI, led by the most famous Italian syndicalist, [[Alceste De Ambris]], called on the Italian state to take the Allies' side. The pro-war syndicalists saw Italian participation in the war as the completion of nationhood. They also felt compelled to oppose the socialists' neutrality and therefore support the war. Finally, they gave similar arguments as the French, warning of the dangers posed by the "suffocating imperialism of Germany", and felt obliged to follow the CGT's lead.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2001, pg. 11&amp;ndash;13, Darlington 2006, pg. 994.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Die einigkeit.PNG|thumb|right|August 1914 edition of ''[[Die Einigkeit]]'', a German syndicalist newspaper, protesting the outbreak of war]]
USI's pro-war wing had the support of less than a third of the organization's members and it was forced out in September 1914. Its anarchist wing, led by [[Armando Borghi]], was firmly opposed to the war, deeming it incompatible with workers' internationalism and predicting that it would only serve elites and governments. Its opposition was met with government repression and Borghi and others were interned by the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2001, pg. 13&amp;ndash;14 , Darlington 2006, pg. 995.&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-war faction in the CGT, on the other hand, was a small minority. It was led by the likes of [[Pierre Monatte]] and [[Alphonse Merrheim]]. They would link up with anti-war socialists from around Europe at the 1915 [[Zimmerwald conference]]. They faced considerable difficulties putting up meaningful resistance against the war. The government called up militants to the Army, including Monatte. He considered refusing the order and being summarily executed, but decided this would be futile.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2006, pg. 992&amp;ndash;993.&lt;/ref&gt; Syndicalist organizations in other countries nearly unanimously opposed the war.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2006, pg. 983&amp;ndash;984, Thorpe 2001, pg. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; "Let Germany win, let France win, it is all the same to the workers," [[José Negre]] of the CNT in neutral Spain declared. The CNT insisted that syndicalists could support neither side in an imperialist conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2006, pg. 985, Thorpe 2011, pg. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; A wave of pro-British sentiment swept Ireland during the war, although the ITGWU and the rest of the Irish labor movement opposed it,  and half of the ITGWU's membership enlisted in the British military. The ITGWU had also been significantly weakened in 1913 in the [[Dublin Lockout]]. After Jim Larkin left Ireland in 1914, [[James Connolly]] took over leadership of the union. Because of the organization's weakness, Connolly allied it along with its paramilitary force, the [[Irish Citizen Army]], with the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]]. Together, they instigated the [[Easter Rising]], seeking to weaken the British Empire and hoping that the insurrection would spread throughout Europe. The uprising was quickly quelled by the British army and Connolly was executed.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2006, pg. 987&amp;ndash;989.&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, the small FVdG opposed the socialists' ''Burgfrieden'' and Germany's involvement in the war, challenging the claim that the country was waging a defensive war. Its journals were suppressed and a number of its members were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2001, pg. 6&amp;ndash;7.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States did not enter the war until the spring of 1917. The start of the war had induced an economic boom in the US, tightening the labor market and thereby strengthening workers' bargaining position. The IWW profited from this, more than doubling its membership between 1916 and 1917. At the same time, the Wobblies fervently denounced the war and mulled calling an anti-war general strike. Once America became a combatant, the IWW maintained its anti-war stance, while its bitter rival, the AFL, supported the war. It did not, however, launch an anti-war campaign, as it feared the government would crush it if it did and wanted to focus on its economic struggles. The IWW's practical opposition to the war was limited, 95% of eligible IWW members registered for the draft, and most of those drafted served.&lt;ref&gt;Dubofsky 1969, pg. 349&amp;ndash;355, 357, Darlington 2006, pg. 997&amp;ndash;999.&lt;/ref&gt; Syndicalists in the Netherlands and Sweden, both neutral countries, criticized the truce socialists entered with their governments in order to shore up national defense. The Dutch NAS disowned Cornelissen, one of its founders, for his support for the war.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2001, pg. 8&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Maybe add Australia: Burgmann --&gt;

Syndicalists from Spain, Portugal, Great Britain, France, Brazil, Argentina, Italy, and Cuba met at an anti-war congress in [[El Ferrol]], Spain, in April 1915. The congress was poorly planned and prohibited by the Spanish authorities, but delegates managed to discuss resistance to the war and extending international cooperation between syndicalist groups.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2006, pg. 1010&amp;ndash;1012, 1016.&lt;/ref&gt; Argentine, Brazilian, Spanish, and Portuguese delegates later met in October in [[Rio de Janeiro]] to continue discussions and resolved to deepen cooperation between South American syndicalists.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2006, pg. 1013&amp;ndash;1014.&lt;/ref&gt; While syndicalists were only able to put up a rather limited practical struggle against World War I,&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2006, pg. 984.&lt;/ref&gt; they also looked to challenge the war on an ideological or cultural level.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2001, pg. 14&amp;ndash;15, Thorpe 2010a, pg. 23&amp;ndash;24.&lt;/ref&gt; They pointed to the horrors of war and spurned efforts to legitimate it as something noble. German syndicalists drew attention to the death, injury, destruction, and misery that the war wrought.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2001, pg. 15, Thorpe 2010a, pg. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; German, Swedish, Dutch, and Spanish syndicalists denounced nationalism with ''Tierra y Libertad'', a syndicalist journal in Barcelona, calling it a "grotesque mentality". The Dutch newspaper ''De Arbeid'' criticized nationalism, because "it finds its embodiment in the state and is the denial of class antagonism between the haves and the have-nots". German and Spanish syndicalists went further still by putting into question the concept of nationhood itself and dismissing it as a mere social construct. The Germans pointed out that most inhabitants of the German Empire identified not as Germans, but in regional terms as Prussians or Bavarians and the like. Multilingual countries like Germany and Spain also could not claim a common language as a defining characteristic of the nation nor did members of the same nation share the same values or experiences, syndicalists in Spain and Germany argued.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2001, pg. 16&amp;ndash;17, Thorpe 2010a, pg. 32&amp;ndash;34.&lt;/ref&gt; Syndicalists also argued against the notion that the war was a clash of different cultures or that it could be justified as a defense of civilization. Various cultures were not mutually hostile, they claimed, and the state should not be seen as the embodiment of culture, since culture was the product of the entire population, while the state acted in the interests of just a few. Moreover, they argued that if culture was to be understood as ''[[high culture]]'', the very workers dying in the war were denied access to that culture by capitalist conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2001, pg. 17, Thorpe 2010a, pg. 34&amp;ndash;37.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, syndicalists railed against religious justifications for war. Before the war, they had rejected religion as divisive at best, but support for the war by both Catholic and Protestant clergy revealed their hypocrisy and disgraced the principles Christianity claimed to uphold, they claimed.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2010a, pg. 28&amp;ndash;31.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the war progressed, disaffection with worsening living conditions at home and a growing numbers of casualties at the front eroded the enthusiasm and patriotism the outbreak of war had aroused. Prices were on the rise, food was scarce, and it became increasingly clear that the war would not be short. In Germany, for example, food shortages led to demonstrations and riots in a number of cities in the summer of 1916. At the same time, anti-war demonstrations started. Strikes picked up from around 1916 or 1917 on across Europe and soldiers began to [[mutiny]]. Workers distrusted their socialist leaders who had joined the war effort. Thanks in part to their fidelity to internationalism, syndicalist organizations profited from this development and expanded as the war drew to an end.&lt;ref&gt;Eley 2002, pg. 131&amp;ndash;133, 136&amp;ndash;137, Thorpe 2001, pg. 19, Darlington 2006, pg. 1002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian Revolution and post-war turmoil===
[[File:Golos Truda, Sept 14 (Sept 1).jpg|thumb|right|September 14, 1917, issue of ''Golos Truda'': The headline reads "To the workers of the world".]]
Disaffection with the war condensed in the [[Revolutions of 1917–1923|post-World War I revolutions]] that began with the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Eley 2002, pg. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1917, strikes, riots, and troop mutinies broke out in [[Petrograd]], forcing the Russian Tsar [[Nicholas II]] to abdicate on March 2 in favor of a [[Russian Provisional Government|provisional government]]. Immediately, anarchist groups emerged. Russian syndicalists organized around the journal ''[[Golos Truda]]'' (''The Voice of Labor''), which had a circulation of around 25,000, and the Union of Anarcho-Syndicalist Propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich 1967, pg. 115, 123&amp;ndash;125, 139&amp;ndash;140, Thorpe 1989, pg. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Most syndicalists were exiled to Western Europe or America before the revolution and started returning in the summer. The most prominent syndicalists who returned to Russia were [[Maksim Raevskii]], [[Vladimir Shatov]], [[Alexander Schapiro]], a participant in the 1913 syndicalist congress in London, and Vseolod Mikhailovich Eikhenbaum, known as [[Volin]]. They were joined by the young local [[Gregori Maximoff|Grigorii Petrovitch Maksimov]]. In their New York exile, Raevskii, Shatov, and Volin had worked on the syndicalist journal ''Golos Truda'', then the organ of the [[Union of Russian Workers]]. They brought it with them proceeded to publish in Petrograd looking to spread syndicalist ideas among workers by introducing them to French movement and the general strike. Outside of Petrograd, syndicalism also gained followers in [[Vyborg]], Moscow, and in the south among the miners in the [[Donets Basin]] and cement workers and longshoremen in [[Ekaterinodar]] and [[Novorossiisk]].&lt;ref&gt;Avrich 1969, pg. 137&amp;ndash;140, 146&amp;ndash;147, Thorpe 1989, pg. 71, 96.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Anarchists found themselves agreeing with the [[Bolsheviks]] led by [[Vladimir Lenin]], who returned to Russia in April, as both sought to bring down the provisional government. Lenin abandoned the idea that capitalism is a [[Theory of historical trajectory|necessary stage]] on Russia's path to communism; dismissed the establishment of a parliament, favoring that power be taken by [[Soviet (council)|soviets]]; and called for the abolition of the police, the army, the bureaucracy, and finally the state{{spaced ndash}} all sentiments syndicalists shared.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich 1967, pg. 127&amp;ndash;129&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the syndicalists also welcomed the soviets, they were most enthusiastic about the [[factory committees]] and [[workers' councils]] that had emerged in all industrial centers in the course of strikes and demonstrations in the February Revolution. The committees fought for higher wages and shorter hours, but above all for [[workers' control]] over production, which both the syndicalists and Bolsheviks supported. The syndicalists viewed the factory committees as the true form of syndicalist organization, not unions.{{refn|group=note|Volin derided the unions, which were dominated by [[Mensheviks]], as a "mediator between labor and capital" and as "reformist".&lt;ref&gt;Avrich 1967, pg. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Because they were better organized, the Bolsheviks were able to gain more traction in the committees with six times as many delegates in a typical factory. Despite the goals they had in common, syndicalists became anxious about the Bolsheviks' growing influence, especially after they won majorities in the Petrograd and Moscow soviets in September.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich 1967, pg. 140&amp;ndash;147, 152&amp;ndash;153, Thorpe 1989, pg. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Petrograd Soviet established the 66-member [[Petrograd Military Revolutionary Committee|Military Revolutionary Committee]], which included four anarchists, among them the syndicalist Shatov. On October 25, this committee led the [[October Revolution]];{{refn|group=note|Compared with the mass revolts in February it was more of a ''[[coup d'état]]''. No more than 30,000 participated, according to its commander [[Leon Trotsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Avrich 1969, pg. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;}} after taking control of the [[Winter Palace]] and key points in the capital with little resistance, it proclaimed a Soviet government. Anarchists were jubilant at the toppling of the provisional government. They were concerned about the proclamation of a new government, fearing a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], even more so after the Bolsheviks created the central [[Soviet of People's Commissars]] composed only of members of their party. They called for decentralization of power, but agreed with Lenin's labor program, which endorsed workers' control in all enterprises of a certain minimum size. The introduction of workers' control led to economic chaos.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich 1967, pg. 158&amp;ndash;164, Thorpe 1989, pg. 97&amp;ndash;98.&lt;/ref&gt; Lenin turned to restoring discipline in the factories and order to the economy in December by putting the economy under state control. At a [[First All Russian Congress of Trade Unions|trade union congress]] in January, the syndicalists, who had paid little attention to the unions, only had 6 delegates, while the Bolsheviks had 273. No longer depending on their help in toppling the provisional government, the Bolsheviks were now in a position to ignore the syndicalists' opposition and outvoted them at this congress. They opted to disempower local committees by subordinating them to the trade unions, which in turn became organs of the state. The Bolsheviks argued that workers' control did not mean that workers controlled factories at the local level and that this control had to be centralized and put under a broader economic plan.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich 1967, pg. 165&amp;ndash;170, Thorpe 1989, pg. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The syndicalists criticized the Bolshevik regime bitterly, characterizing it as [[state capitalism|state capitalist]]. They denounced state control over the factories and agitated for decentralization of power in politics and the economy and "syndicalization" of industry.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich 1967, pg. 181, 191&amp;ndash;195, Thorpe 1989, 99&amp;ndash;100.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|''Golos Truda'' was suppressed and replaced with a new, but short-lived journal, ''Vol'nyi Golos Truda'' (''The Free Voice of Labor'').

Their demands had some sway with workers and dissidents within the Bolshevik party and the Bolshevik leadership viewed them as the most dangerous part of the libertarian movement.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich 1967, pg. 222&amp;ndash;225, Thorpe 1989, pg. 163&amp;ndash;164.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Civil War ended, workers and sailors, including both anarchists and Bolsheviks, [[Kronstadt Rebellion|rose up]] in 1921 in [[Kronstadt]], a bastion of radicalism since 1905, against what they saw as the rule of a small number of bureaucrats. Anarchists hailed the rebellion as the start of the third revolution. The government reacted by having anarchists throughout the country arrested, including a number of syndicalist leaders. The Russian syndicalist movement was thereby defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich 1967, pg. 228&amp;ndash;231, 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

Syndicalists in the West who had opposed World War I reacted gushingly to the Russian Revolution.{{refn|group=note|Pro-war syndicalists in the CGT, on the other hand, viewed the revolution as treason, because the Bolsheviks withdrew Russia from the war. Alceste De Ambris and the syndicalist supporters of war in Italy also denounced the upheaval as a challenge to nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 1989, pg. 92&amp;ndash;93&lt;/ref&gt;}} Though they were still coming to grips with the evolving Bolshevik ideology and despite traditional anarchist suspicions of Marxism, they saw in Russia a revolution that had taken place against parliamentary politics and under the influence of workers' councils. They also, at this point, had only limited knowledge of the reality in Russia. [[Augustin Souchy]], a German anarcho-syndicalist, hailed it "the great passion that swept us all along. In the East, so we believed, the sun of freedom rose." The Spanish CNT declared: "Bolshevism is the name, but the idea is that of all revolutions: economic freedom. [...] Bolshevism is the new life for which we struggle, it is freedom, harmony, justice, it is the life that we want and will enforce in the world." Borghi recalled: "We exulted in its victories. We trembled at its risks.[...] We made a symbol and an altar of its name, its dead, its living and its heroes."&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 1989, pg. 92&amp;ndash;93, Tosstorf 2009, pg. 14&amp;ndash;15.&lt;/ref&gt; He called on Italians to "do as they did in Russia".&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, a revolutionary wave, inspired in part by Russia, swept Europe in the following years.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2009, pg. 187, Eley 2002, pg. 138, 152&amp;ndash;155.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, strikes and protests against food shortage, mainly by women, escalated and by 1917 had eroded public confidence in the government. The German Emperor was [[Abdication of Wilhelm II|forced to abdicate]] in November 1918 after [[Kiel mutiny|sailors' mutinies]] sparked an [[German Revolution of 1918–19|insurrectionary movement]] throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;Eley 2002, pg. 136&amp;ndash;138, 153&amp;ndash;154, 165.&lt;/ref&gt; The syndicalist FVdG, which had just 6,000 members before the war and was almost completely suppressed by the state during the war, regrouped at a conference in Berlin in December 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2001, pg. 6, Bock 1969, pg. 33, 86, 102&amp;ndash;103.&lt;/ref&gt; It was active in the revolutionary events of the following years, particularly in the [[Ruhr area]]. It supported spontaneous strikes and championed direct action and sabotage. The FVdG started to be held in high regard for its radicalism by workers, particularly miners, who appreciated the syndicalists' ability to theorize their struggles and their experience with direct action methods. Starting in the second half of 1919, workers disappointed by the socialist party's and unions' support for the war and previously non-unionized unskilled workers who were radicalized during the war flocked to the FVdG.&lt;ref&gt;Bock 1969, pg. 105, 108&amp;ndash;109, 118&amp;ndash;120.&lt;/ref&gt; The revolution also saw the introduction to Germany of industrial unionism along the lines of the IWW with some support from the American organization, but also with links to the left wing of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Bock 1969, pg. 124&amp;ndash;126.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1919, the [[Free Workers' Union of Germany|Free Workers' Union of Germany (Syndicalists)]] (''Freie Arbeiter-Union Deutschlands (Syndikalisten)'', FAUD) was formed, claiming to represent over 110,000 workers, more than eighteen times the FVdG's pre-war membership. Most of the new organization came from the FVdG, but industrial unionists, whose influence was dwindling, were also involved. [[Rudolf Rocker]], an anarchist recently returned to Germany after spending several years in London, wrote the FAUD's program.&lt;ref&gt;Bock 1969, pg. 105&amp;ndash;106, 155&amp;ndash;156, Torpe 2001, pg. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Ideology,Radicalization: Bock, 105-108, 156-160, 167-179 --&gt;

In Portugal, working class unrest picked up from the start of the war. In 1917, radicals began to dominate the labor movement as a result of the war, [[Sidónio Pais|the dictatorship established that year]], and the influence of the Russian Revolution. In November 1918, [[1918 Portugal general strike|a general strike]] was called but failed and in 1919 the syndicalist [[General Confederation of Labour (Portugal)|General Confederation of Labour]] (''Confederação Geral do Trabalho'', CGT) was formed as the country's first national union confederation.&lt;ref&gt;Bayerlein/van der Linden 1990, pg. 159&amp;ndash;161.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:São Paulo (Greve de 1917).jpg|thumb|right|The 1917 general strike in São Paulo]]
In Brazil, in both Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, syndicalists, along with anarchists and socialists, were leaders in a [[1917–1919 Brazil strike movement|cycle of labor struggles]] from 1917 to 1919. It included a general strike in 1917, a failed uprising in 1918 inspired by the Russian Revolution, and a number of smaller strikes. The movement was put down by increased organization by employers to resist workers' demands and by government repression, including the closure of unions, arrests, deportations of foreign militants, and violence, with some 200 workers killed in São Paulo alone.&lt;ref&gt;Batalha 2017, pg. 92&amp;ndash;98, Toledo/Biondi 2010, pg. 387&amp;ndash;391.&lt;/ref&gt; In Argentina, FORA had split into the anarcho-communist FORA V and the syndicalist FORA IX. While FORA V called for a futile general strike in 1915, FORA IX was more careful. It called off general strikes it had planned in 1917 and 1918. In January 1919, five workers were by the authorities during a strike led by a union with tenuous links to FORA V. At the funeral, police killed another 39 workers. Both FORA organizations called for a general strike, which continued after FORA IX reached a settlement. Vigilantes, supported by business and the military, attacked unions and militants. In all, between 100 and 700 people died in what became known as the [[Tragic Week (Argentina)|Tragic Week]]. Nevertheless, strikes continued to increase and both FORA V and IX grew.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1990, pg. 169, 174&amp;ndash;178.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States underwent an increase in labor militancy during the post-war period. 1919 saw a [[Seattle General Strike|a general strike in Seattle]], large miners' strikes, [[Boston Police Strike|a police strike in Boston]], and [[Steel strike of 1919|a nationwide steel strike]]. The IWW, however, had been nearly destroyed in the previous two years by local [[criminal syndicalism]] laws, the federal government, and vigilante violence. It attempted to take credit for some of the strikes, but in reality was too weak to play a significant role. The post-war [[First Red Scare|Red Scare]] intensified the attacks on the IWW and by the end of 1919 the IWW was practically powerless.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2006, pg. 999&amp;ndash;1000, Darlington 2008, pg. 162&amp;ndash;163, Dubofsky 1969, pg. 452&amp;ndash;456.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 Canada was hit by a [[Canadian Labour Revolt|labor revolt]], leading to the formation of One Big Union, which was only partly industrial unionist.&lt;ref&gt;Bercuson 1990, pg. 221, 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

===IWA===
Though the Bolsheviks suppressed syndicalism in Russia, they courted syndicalists abroad as part of their international strategy. In March 1919, the [[Comintern]] or Third International was [[1st Congress of the Comintern|founded at a conference in Moscow]]. The Bolsheviks acknowledged syndicalism's opposition to socialist reformism and saw them as part of the revolutionary wing of the labor movement. No syndicalists attended the founding convention, mainly because the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|blockade of Russia]] by the Allies powers made travel to Moscow near impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 1989, pg. 100&amp;ndash;101, 104, Tosstorf 2009, pg. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; After long discussions, the CNT opted to join the Comintern, though it classified its adherence as provisional as a concession to detractors of Bolshevism. USI also decided to join, though some like Borghi had reservations about the course of events in Russia. In France, the CGT's radical minority that had opposed the war enthusiastically supported Bolshevism. They formed the [[Revolutionary Syndicalist Committees]] and attempted to push the CGT as a whole to support the Comintern.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 1989, pg. 112&amp;ndash;116.&lt;/ref&gt; The General Executive Board of the IWW decided join the Comintern, but this decision was never confirmed by a convention.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 2017, pg. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; German and Swedish syndicalists were more critical of Bolshevism from the start. Rocker declared already in August 1918 that the Bolshevik regime was "but a new system of tyranny" and they clashed on a number of issues.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 1989, pg. 116, 122, Tosstorf 2009, pg. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2nd World Congress of the Comintern|second congress of the Comintern]] in the summer of 1920 was attended by numerous syndicalists. The Italian USI, the Spanish CNT, the British shop stewards, and the revolutionary minority of the CGT had official representatives, but others like [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]] of the American IWW and [[Augustin Souchy]] of the German FAUD also attended in an unofficial capacity. Western syndicalists' knowledge of the facts on the ground in Russia was at this point rather limited. They thought of the soviets as organs of workers' control over production and the Bolsheviks depicted them as such. Syndicalists were not aware of the extent to which they were in reality subordinated to the communist party. The congress, however, revealed the irreconcilable differences between the syndicalist and the Bolshevik approach.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 1989, pg. 126&amp;ndash;129, 132, Tosstorf 2009, pg. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Even before the congress, at a meeting of the Comintern's Executive Committee a document, a document was proposed that derided the apolitical unions as "lackeys of imperialist capitalism" for their betrayal during the war, to which syndicalists replied that of the syndicalist unions this only applied to the CGT.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 1989, pg. 132&amp;ndash;133.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[International Workers' Association]], formed in 1922, is an international syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries. At its peak, it represented millions of workers and competed directly for the hearts and minds of the working class with social democratic unions and parties.

==Decline==
From the early 1920s, syndicalist movements in most countries began to wane. State repression played a significant role, but movements that were not suppressed also declined. Faced with this decline, syndicalist organizations had three choices: They could stay true to their revolutionary principles and be marginalized. They could give up those principles in order to adapt to new conditions. Finally, they could disband or merge into non-syndicalist organizations. The IWW is an example of the first case. The French CGT, which according to van der Linden and Thorpe was no longer syndicalist after 1914, went the second route.&lt;ref&gt;van der Linden/Thorpe 1990, pg. 4&amp;ndash;5, 17&amp;ndash;18.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The Swedish SAC initially chose the first option, but as an increasing number of workers left to join the mainstream unions, it changed course and became increasingly reformist. For example, in the 1930s unemployment funds were set up in Sweden, managed by unions but with significant contributions from the state. The SAC initially refused to participate, but the ensuing loss in membership forced the SAC to give in. SAC membership then started to slowly rise.&lt;ref&gt;van der Linden/Thorpe 1990, pg. 18&amp;ndash;19.&lt;/ref&gt;}} By the end of the 1930s, meaningful legal syndicalist organizations existed only in Bolivia, Chile, Sweden, and Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;van der Walt 2018, pg. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fascism===
[[Georges Sorel]] played a role in shaping the views of [[Benito Mussolini]] and by extension the wider [[Italian Fascism|Italian fascist]] movement. In March 1921, Sorel wrote that Mussolini was "a man no less extraordinary than Lenin".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacob Talmon|J. L. Talmon]], ''The Myth of the Nation and the Vision of Revolution: The Origins of Ideological Polarization in the 20th Century'', (University of California Press, 1981), p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt; After Sorel's death in 1922, [[Agostino Lanzillo]], a one-time syndicalist leader who had become a fascist, wrote in the Italian fascist review ''Gerarchia'', which was edited by Mussolini: "Perhaps fascism may have the good fortune to fulfill a mission that is the implicit aspiration of the whole oeuvre of the master of syndicalism: to tear away the proletariat from the domination of the Socialist party, to reconstitute it on the basis of spiritual liberty, and to animate it with the breath of creative violence. This would be the true revolution that would mold the forms of the Italy of tomorrow".&lt;ref&gt;[[Zeev Sternhell]], Mario Sznajder, Maia Ashéri, ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution'',(Princeton University Press, 1994), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish Civil War===
The [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|anarcho-syndicalist revolution]] during the Spanish Civil War resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly socialist organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years, primarily Catalonia, [[Aragon]], [[Andalusia]] and parts of the [[Levante, Spain|Levante]]. Much of Spain's economy was put under worker control—in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia, the figure was as high as 75%.
&lt;!-- Still need good sources --&gt;

===Reasons===
Syndicalism's decline was the result of a number of factors. In Russia, Italy, Portugal, Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands, syndicalist movements were suppressed by authoritarian governments. The IWW in the United States and the Mexican House of the World Worker were weakened considerably by state repression. Syndicalist movements that were not suppressed also declined. According to van der Linden and Thorpe, this was primarily the result of the integration of the working class into capitalist relations. Proletarian families became units of individualized consumption as standards of living increased. This was partly the result of state intervention, particularly the emergence of the welfare state.&lt;ref&gt;van der Linden/Thorpe 1990, pg. 17&amp;ndash;18.&lt;/ref&gt; Avenues for social reform opened up and the franchise was widened, giving parliamentary reformism legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 177&amp;ndash;179.&lt;/ref&gt; Altena agrees that the state's growing influence in society was decisive for syndicalism's diminished influence. In addition to the welfare state, he refers to the increased significance of national policies, which eroded local autonomy. This made centralized unions able to negotiate national agreements more important and national and parliamentary politics more enticing for workers. They therefore turned to social democracy in larger numbers. Additionally, syndicalism lost out to sports and entertainment in the cultural sphere, according to Altena.&lt;ref&gt;Altena 2010, pg. 217&amp;ndash;219.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vadim Dam'e adds to this that the development of capitalist production and changes in the division of labor diminished syndicalism's recruitment base.&lt;ref&gt;Altena 2010, pg. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; According to authors like Stearns, Edward Shorter, [[Charles Tilly]], and Bob Holton, who deem syndicalism a transitional form of workers' resistance between older craft-based and modern factory-based industry, syndicalism's decline was a product of that transition having been completed and workers being assimilated to capitalist factory discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 158&amp;ndash;159.&lt;/ref&gt; Darlington counters that syndicalism attracted a variety of workers, not just artisans and skilled workers, but concedes that such changes did play a role in Spain, France, and some other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 159&amp;ndash;160&lt;/ref&gt;

Several authors claim that syndicalism's demise was the result of workers' inherent pragmatism or conservatism, causing them to only be interested in immediate material gains, rather than long-term goals like overthrowing capitalism. [[Robert Hoxie]], [[Selig Perlman]], and Patrick Renshaw invoke this argument to explain the IWW's decline and Stearns, [[Dermot Keogh]], and [[G. D. H. Cole]] do so with respect to French, Irish, and British syndicalism, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 145&amp;ndash;146.&lt;/ref&gt; Darlington disputes the assumption that workers are incapable of developing a revolutionary consciousness. Seeking material gains is not incompatible, he claims, with developing class consciousness, which entails the awareness that workers' material interests conflict with capitalism, particularly in times of crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 151&amp;ndash;152.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to many Marxists, syndicalism was a reaction to reformism in the labor movement and could not survive without it. The collapse of reformism after the war therefore automatically weakened syndicalism. According [[Eric Hobsbawm]], the biggest reason for syndicalism's decline, however, was the rise of communism. Several communist parties drew their cadres from the syndicalists' ranks. To radical workers the programmatic distinctions between syndicalism and communism were not all that relevant. The key is that after the war communism represented militancy or revolutionary attitude as such.&lt;ref&gt;Hobsbawm 1973, pg. 69, 73&amp;ndash;74.&lt;/ref&gt; Darlington, too, sees the effects of the Russian Revolution as an important reason for the decline of syndicalism. The emergence of communism highlighted syndicalism's inherent weaknesses: the contradiction of building organizations that sought to be both revolutionary cadre organizations and mass labor unions, the emphasis on economic struggle to the detriment of political action, and the commitment to localism limiting its ability to provide an effective centralized organization and leadership. Bolshevism's overcoming of these limitations and its success in Russia drew syndicalist leaders and members. It also exacerbated splits within the syndicalist camp.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Fascist victory in the Spanish Civil War put an end to syndicalism as a mass movement.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 3, 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after World War II, there were attempts to rekindle anarcho-syndicalism in Germany, but they were thwarted by Cold War anti-communism, [[Stalinism]], and a failure to attract newer younger activists.&lt;ref&gt;Bock 1969, pg. 348, Bock 1976, pg. 173&amp;ndash;174.&lt;/ref&gt; Syndicalists maintained some influence in Latin American labor movements into the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer 2018, pg. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1968 protests|protest movements]] of the late 1960s saw renewed interest in syndicalism by activists in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;Bock 1976, pg. 253, 256.&lt;/ref&gt; the US,&lt;ref&gt;Buhle 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Travis 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, in communist Poland, the trade union [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] (''Solidarność''), though not strictly syndicalist, attracted masses of dissident workers by reviving many syndicalist ideas and practices.&lt;ref&gt;van der Linden/Thorpe 1990, pg. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IWA exists to this day, but with very little influence. At most, it is a "flicker of history, the custodian of doctrine" according to Wayne Thorpe.&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe 1990, pg. 257&amp;ndash;258.&lt;/ref&gt; Among its member organizations is the British [[Solidarity Federation]], which was formed in 1994, but has roots going back to 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Barberis/McHugh/Tyldesley 2000, pg. 167&amp;ndash;168.&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes the German [[Free Workers' Union]] (''Freie Arbeiterinnen- und Arbeiter-Union'', FAU). It was formed to carry on the FAUD's tradition in 1977, but has a membership of just 350 as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Drücke 2011, pg. 39, Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz 2011, pg. 165&amp;ndash;166.&lt;/ref&gt; Spain has several syndicalist federations, including the CNT, which is still part of the IWA and has around 50,000 members as of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Cleminson 2012, pg. 412&amp;ndash;413, Pascual 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; After being defeated in the Civil War, tens of thousands of CNT militants went into exile, mostly in France. In exile, the organization atrophied, with just 5,000 mostly older members by 1960. During [[Spanish transition to democracy|Spain's transition to democracy]], the CNT was revived with a peak membership of over 300,000 in 1978. However, it was soon weakened, first by accusations of having been involved in the [[Scala affair|bombing of a nightclub]], then by a schism.&lt;ref&gt;Ealham 2015, pg. 122, 180&amp;ndash;181, 212&amp;ndash;215.&lt;/ref&gt; Members who favored participation in state-sponsored union elections left and formed an organization they would eventually name the [[General Confederation of Labour (Spain)|General Confederation of Labor]] (''Confederación General del Trabajo'', CGT). Despite these concessions, the CGT still views itself as an anarcho-syndicalist organization and has around 100,000 members as of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Ealham 2015, pg. 215&amp;ndash;216, Pascual 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Darlington, syndicalism left a legacy that was widely admired by labor and political activists in a number of countries. For example, the IWW song "[[Solidarity Forever]]" became part of the American labor movement's canon. The strike wave, including the recruitment of unskilled and foreign-born workers by the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]], that swept the United States in the 1930s followed in the IWW's footsteps. The tactic of the [[sit-down strike]], made famous by the [[United Auto Workers]] in the [[Flint sit-down strike]], was pioneered by Wobblies in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Darlington 2008, pg. 278&amp;ndash;279.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stearns, in his study of French syndicalism, concludes that it was a dismal failure. The radicalism of syndicalist labor leaders, he claims, shocked French workers and the government and thereby weakened the labor movement as a whole. Syndicalism was most popular among workers not yet fully integrated into modern capitalist industry, but most French workers had adapted to this system and accepted it, according to Stearns. Therefore, syndicalism was not able to seriously challenge prevailing conditions or even scare politicians and employers.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns 1971, pg. 103&amp;ndash;107.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8031">{{Intelligent Design}}
A '''universal probability bound''' is a probabilistic threshold whose existence is asserted by [[William A. Dembski]] and is used by him in his works promoting [[intelligent design]]. It is defined as {{quote|A degree of improbability below which a specified event of that probability cannot reasonably be attributed to chance regardless of whatever probabilitistic resources from the known universe are factored in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iscid.org/encyclopedia/Universal_Probability_Bound ISCID Encyclopedia of Science and Philosophy] (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dembski asserts that one can effectively estimate a positive value which is a universal probability bound. The existence of such a bound would imply that certain kinds of random events whose probability lies below this value can be assumed not to have occurred in the observable universe, given the resources available in the entire history of the observable universe. Contrapositively, Dembski uses the threshold to argue that the occurrence of certain events cannot be attributed to chance alone. Universal probability bound is then used to argue against random [[evolution]]. However evolution is not based on random events only ([[genetic drift]]), but also on [[natural selection]].

The idea that events with fantastically small, but positive probabilities, are ''effectively'' negligible&lt;ref&gt;Negligible means having probability zero. Effectively negligible means, roughly,  that in some [[operational definition|operational]] sense or in some computational sense, the event is indistinguishable from a negligible one.&lt;/ref&gt; was discussed by the [[France|French]] [[mathematician]] [[Émile Borel]] primarily in the context of [[cosmology]] and [[statistical mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;Émile Borel, ''Elements of the Theory of Probability'' (translated by John Freund), Prentice Hall, 1965, Chapter 6. See also [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/abioprob/borelfaq.html Citations from Borel's articles].&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there is no widely accepted scientific basis for claiming that certain positive values are ''universal'' cutoff points for effective negligibility of events. Borel, in particular, was careful to point out that negligibility was relative to a model of probability for a specific physical system.&lt;ref&gt;Though Dembski credits Borel for the idea, there is clear evidence that Borel, following accepted scientific practice in the foundations of statistics, was not referring to a ''universal'' bound, independent of the statistical model used.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, L. (2005) ''[http://www.aetheling.com/essays/Borel.html Borel's Law and Creationism]'', Aetheling Consultants.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dembski appeals to [[cryptography|cryptographic]] practice in support of the concept of the universal probability bound, noting that cryptographers have sometimes compared the security of encryption algorithms against [[brute force attack]]s  by the likelihood of success of an adversary utilizing computational resources bounded by very large physical constraints. An example of such a constraint might be obtained  for example, by assuming that every atom in the observable universe is a computer of a certain type and these computers are running through and testing every possible key. Although universal measures of security are used much less frequently than asymptotic ones&lt;ref&gt;For a precise definition of effective negligibility in cryptography, see [[Michael Luby]], ''Pseudorandomness and Cryptographic Applications'', Princeton Computer Science Series, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and the fact that a keyspace is very large may be less relevant if the cryptographic algorithm used has vulnerabilities which make it susceptible to other kinds of attacks,&lt;ref&gt;Though Dembski repeatedly appeals to cryptography in support of the concept of the universal probability bound, in practice cryptographers hardly use measures which are in any way related to it.  A more useful concept is that of [[work factor]].  See p. 44, A. J. Menezes, P. C. van Oorschot, S. A. Vanstone, ''Handbook of Applied Cryptography'', CRC Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; asymptotic approaches and directed attacks would, by definition, be unavailable under chance-based scenarios such as those relevant to Dembski's universal probability bound.  As a result, Dembski's appeal to cryptography is best understood as referring to brute force attacks, rather than directed attacks.

==Dembski's estimate==

Dembski's original value for the universal probability bound is 1 in 10&lt;sup&gt;150&lt;/sup&gt;, derived as the inverse of the product of the following approximate quantities:&lt;ref&gt;William A. Dembski (1998). ''[[The Design Inference]]'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=zvToAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=dembski+%22universal+probability+bound%22+%22the+design+inference%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rxQJVey9NYSkgwSGnoOwBA&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dembski%20%22universal%20probability%20bound%22%20%22the%20design%20inference%22&amp;f=false pg 213, section 6.5]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William A. Dembski (2004). ''[[The Design Revolution|The Design Revolution: Answering the Toughest Questions About Intelligent Design]]'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=sKVqpXqE0VwC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=universal+probability+bound&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0vtqjR1_3f&amp;sig=bpCBVhooWOjlRkELvtEkv2XniHM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kucIVeXEAsaogwTUtISwBQ&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=universal%20probability%20bound&amp;f=false pg 85]&lt;/ref&gt;

* 10&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt;, the number of elementary particles in the [[observable universe]].
* 10&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;, the maximum rate per second at which transitions in physical states can occur (i.e., the inverse of the [[Planck time]]).
* 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;, a [[Billion (word)|billion]] times longer than the typical estimated age of the universe in seconds.

Thus, 10&lt;sup&gt;150&lt;/sup&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;.  Hence, this value corresponds to an upper limit on the number of physical events that could possibly have occurred in the observable part of the universe since the [[big bang]].

Dembski has recently (as of 2005) refined his definition to be the inverse of the product of two different quantities:&lt;ref&gt;William A. Dembski (2005). "[http://www.designinference.com/documents/2005.06.Specification.pdf  "Specification: The Pattern That Signifies Intelligence (382k PDF)]".&lt;/ref&gt;

* An upper bound on the computational resources of the universe in its entire history. This is estimated by [[Seth Lloyd]] as 10&lt;sup&gt;120&lt;/sup&gt; elementary logic operations on a register of 10&lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt; bits&lt;ref&gt;Seth Lloyd, ''[https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0110141 Computational Capacity of the Universe]'', arXiv:quant-ph/0110141 v1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The number 10&lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt; seems to play no role in Dembski's analysis,  On page 23 of ''Specification: The Pattern That Signifies Intelligence'', Dembski says
:"Lloyd has shown that 10&lt;sup&gt;120&lt;/sup&gt;constitutes the maximal number of bit operations that the known,  observable universe could have performed throughout its entire multi-billion year history."&lt;/ref&gt;
* The (variable) rank complexity of the event under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;The rank complexity is Dembski's &amp;phi; function which ranks patterns in order of their [[Kolmogorov complexity|descriptive complexity]]. See [[specified complexity]].&lt;/ref&gt;

If the latter quantity equals 10&lt;sup&gt;150&lt;/sup&gt;, then the overall universal probability bound corresponds to the original value.

== The observable universe ==
Dembski's estimate is dependent on the number of protons in the observable universe. Given that the observable universe is only a lower bound to the size of the entire universe, it is entirely possible that the total number of protons in the entire universe is very many times more than used by Dembski. For this reason, Dembski's probability bound is not a limit to what may or may not plausibly happen in the entire universe, only the fraction of it that is observable from earth.&lt;ref&gt;Citation needed&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The release of some logs to the public have been a goal of, and can be credited to the pressure from, [[Watchdog journalism|watchdog groups]] concerned with possible undue influence of [[Lobbying|lobbyists]] over the US government.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.govtech.com/data/White-House-Publishes-5-Million-Visitor-Access-Records.html|title=White House Publishes 5.02 Million Visitor Access Records|website=www.govtech.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups such as [[Judicial Watch]], [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington|CREW]], and [https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/ The National Security Archive] have been suing the government to release such logs under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] since at least the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-08-30/secret-service-must-produce-white-house-visitor-records|title=Secret Service Must Produce Some White House Records – Bloomberg|date=2016-11-15|access-date=2017-06-20|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115084148/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-08-30/secret-service-must-produce-white-house-visitor-records|archivedate=2016-11-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.publicintegrity.org/2011/04/13/4115/white-house-visitor-logs-riddled-holes|title=White House visitor logs riddled with holes|date=2011-04-13|website=Center for Public Integrity|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton]] and [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush]] administrations refused to release visitor records to the public, arguing they are part of presidential communications and not public records.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]], however, after initially following the same policy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/31373407/ns/politics-white_house/t/obama-blocks-list-visitors-white-house/#.WUjPfOWGNhE|title=Obama blocks list of visitors to White House|date=2009-06-16|work=msnbc.com|access-date=2017-06-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually reversed it and by mid-2009 released the visitor logs as part of its stated commitment to [[Open government|government transparency]], under the White House Voluntary Disclosure Policy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was the first US administration to release those logs to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2015/12/30/more-502-million-records-released|title=More than 5.02 Million Records Released|date=2015-12-30|work=whitehouse.gov|access-date=2017-06-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/statement-president-first-time-disclosure-policy-white-house-visitor-logs|title=Statement from the President on the First Time Disclosure Policy for White House Visitor Logs {{!}} whitehouse.gov|date=2017-01-18|access-date=2017-06-20|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118000633/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/statement-president-first-time-disclosure-policy-white-house-visitor-logs|archivedate=2017-01-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logs were nonetheless redacted to remove sensitive meetings (such as visits by potential Supreme Court nominees) and purely personal guests.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/VoluntaryDisclosure|title=White House Voluntary Disclosure Policy Visitor Access Records|date=2015-08-27|work=whitehouse.gov|access-date=2017-06-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Logs for the period between January 20 and September 15, 2009, are subject to different policy and require specific requests.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] withdrew its support for release of the logs, and is not making visitor logs available to the public, though some comments suggest the logs could be made available "five years after Trump leaves office".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4740499/white-house-visitor-logs-public-record-trump/|title=The White House Will Keep Its Visitor Logs Secret|last=Miller|first=Zeke J.|website=Time|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; This has led to several groups suing the government again, demanding the release of such logs, which should be seen as a matter of public record.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/04/13/523774821/as-trump-continues-mar-a-lago-trips-watchdogs-want-to-know-who-s-joining-him|title=As Trump Continues Mar-A-Lago Trips, Watchdogs Want To Know Who's Joining Him|website=NPR.org|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breaking News: Judge Lets Secret Service Hide White House Visitor Logs|editor=Lauren Harper|publisher=[[National Security Archive]]|url=https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/news/foia/2018-07-27/breaking-news-judge-lets-secret-service-hide-white-house-visitor-logs|accessdate=August 2, 2018|date=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analysis ==
[[File:Dave Cote Headshot.jpg|thumb|[[David M. Cote]] (Chairman and CEO of [[Honeywell|Honeywell International]]) was the most frequent business visitor to the White House during the Obama administration.]]
While Obama's release of the logs was generally praised by transparency activists,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the [[Sunlight Foundation]] noted, "The voluntary system can be too easily circumvented. Because it only captures visitors to the White House, if an administration official wishes to keep a meeting with a lobbyist secret, he or she merely has to schedule it at a nearby location" and "Phone calls are also used to avoid disclosure".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sunlightfoundation.com/policy/one-pagers/disclose-all-lobbyist-meetings-white-house-staff/|title=Disclose All Lobbyist Meetings With White House Staff|work=Sunlight Foundation|access-date=2017-06-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Omission of significant visits was criticised by other groups.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; ''Time'' noted that "The Obama-era process allowed the White House Counsel’s office to unilaterally redact records of those visiting the complex for any reason. The Obama Administration, for instance, took a wide-ranging view of what were considered personal events hosted by the Obamas, leaving off celebrity sightings and meetings with top donors." The visitors could request to have their records shielded from public through a simple checkbox on the visitor form.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;

A 2017 study showed that companies whose executives have met the president report a raise of their share values, by approximately 0.5% following a month or two after the disclosure of the meeting. The authors note that direct causation is difficult to prove, but it is likely that investors view such news as indication that companies will perform better, for example winning more government procurement contracts.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21722217-white-house-visitor-logs-help-show-lobbying-pays-when-bosses-visit-white-house-their|title=When bosses visit the White House, their firms make more money|website=The Economist|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Jeffrey|last2=Huang|first2=Jiekun|title=All the President's Friends: Political Access and Firm Value |work=NBER Working Paper No. 23356 |doi=10.3386/w23356 |date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; That study identified  2,286 meetings between corporate executives and federal government officials with the top three most frequent visitors for that period being [[David M.

[[Image:Gérôme Eminence grise 1873.jpg|300px|thumb|[[François Leclerc du Tremblay]] is the figure in black depicted descending the staircase in this oil painting by [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]]]
An '''''éminence grise''''' ({{IPA-fr|eminɑ̃s ɡʁiz}}) or '''grey eminence''' is a powerful decision-maker or adviser who operates "behind the scenes", or in a non-public or unofficial capacity.

== Origin ==
This phrase originally referred to [[François Leclerc du Tremblay]], the right-hand man of [[Cardinal Richelieu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = O'Connell|first = D.P.|year = 1968|title = Richelieu|location = New York |publisher = The World Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leclerc was a [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin friar]] who was renowned for his beige robe attire, as beige was termed "grey" in that era. The style ''[[His Eminence]]'' is used to address or refer to a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in the [[Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Talk:Éminence grise#Very good article|Historical reference to address in the Roman Catholic Church]]&lt;/ref&gt; Although Leclerc never achieved the rank of cardinal, those around him addressed him as such in deference to the considerable influence this "grey" friar held over "His Eminence the Cardinal".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mould |first=Michael |title=The Routledge Dictionary of Cultural References in Modern French |year=2011 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |location=New York |isbn=978-1-136-82573-6 |page=149 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x-FNTmUwfpEC&amp;pg=PA149 |accessdate=15 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leclerc is referred to in several popular works. [[Aldous Huxley]] wrote an English biography of Leclerc entitled, ''[[Grey Eminence]]''. There is also an 1873 painting by [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]], ''L'Éminence Grise'', which depicts him descending the grand staircase of the [[Palais-Royal|Palais Cardinal]] and the deference shown to him by others present. Leclerc is referred to in [[Alexandre Dumas]]' ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' as the character Father Joseph, a powerful associate of Richelieu and one to be feared.

As women were barred from reigning in their own right, the [[history of China]] is replete with cases of [[Women in ancient and imperial China|women exercising political power]] through their male relatives.&lt;ref name=mcmahon&gt;{{cite book | last1=McMahon | first1=Keith | title=Women Shall Not Rule: Imperial Wives and Concubines in China from Han to Liao | page=16 | date=2013 | publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] | location=[[Lanham, Maryland]] | isbn=9781442222908 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gc_3IXkwG3QC&amp;printsec=frontcover | accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
