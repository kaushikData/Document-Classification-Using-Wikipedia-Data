'''Abandonware''' is a [[Product (business)|product]], typically [[software]], ignored by its owner and manufacturer, and for which no support is available. Although such software is usually still under [[copyright]], the owner may not be tracking copyright violations.

In [[intellectual rights]] context, abandonware is a software (or hardware) special case of the general concept of ''[[orphan works]]''.

==Definition==
Definitions of "abandoned" vary, but in general it is like any item that is abandoned – it is ignored by the owner, and as such product support and possibly copyright enforcement are also "abandoned". It can refer to a product that is no longer available for legal purchase, over the age where the product creator feels an obligation to continue to support it, or where [[operating systems]] or [[Computer hardware|hardware]] platforms have evolved to such a degree that the creator feels continued support cannot be financially justified. In such cases, copyright and support issues are often ignored. Software might also be considered abandoned when it can be used only with [[Obsolescence|obsolete technologies]], such as [[Apple II series|pre-Macintosh]] Apple computers. A difference between ''abandonware'' and a ''discontinued product'' is that the manufacturer has not officially 'discontinued' the software, but only ended their official efforts at technical support.

Abandonware may be [[computer software]] or physical devices which are usually computerised in some fashion, such as [[personal computer games]], [[Office suite|productivity applications]], [[utility software]], or [[mobile phones]].

===Types===
The term "abandonware" is broad, and encompasses many types of old software.
;Commercial software unsupported but still owned by a viable company: The availability of the software depends on the company's attitude toward the software. In many cases, the company which owns the software rights may not be that which originated it, or may not recognize their ownership. Some companies, such as [[Borland]], make some software available online,&lt;ref name="edn"/&gt; in a form of [[freeware]]. Others do not make old versions available for [[Freeware|free use]] and do not permit people to copy the software. Many abandonware websites have been set up to archive and make available copies of unsupported and discontinued [[operating systems]] made by [[Microsoft]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], as well as rare development builds of such operating systems that have been leaked by the media or technicians working for said companies &amp;mdash; the latter is popular among [[retrogaming]] and computing enthusiasts, who value the availability of these operating systems for the ease of access they provide. After [[Windows XP]] support was discontinued in April 2014, numerous websites started providing the operating system for free. The operating system's usage and popularity thus prevented it from being entirely abandoned.
;Commercial software owned by a company no longer in business: When no owning entity of a software exists, all activities (support, distribution, [[Intellectual property|IP]] activities etc.) in relationship to this software have ceased. If the rights to a software are non-recoverable in legal limbo ("orphaned work"), also the software's rights can not be bought by another company, there can not be copyright enforcement etc. An example of this is [[Digital Research]]'s original [[PL/I]] compiler for [[DOS]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpm.z80.de/ The Unofficial CP/M Web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203184144/http://www.cpm.z80.de/ |date=February 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was considered for many years without owner (now probably owned by [[Novell]]).
;[[Shareware]] whose author still makes it available: Finding historical versions, however, can be difficult since most shareware archives remove past versions with the release of new versions. Authors may or may not make older releases available. Some websites collect and offer for download old versions of shareware, freeware, and (in some cases) commercial applications. In some cases these sites had to remove past versions of software, particularly if the company producing that software still maintains it, or if later software releases introduce [[digital rights management]], whereby old versions could be viewed as DRM circumvention.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
;Unsupported or unmaintained shareware
;[[Open-source software|Open source]] and freeware programs that have been abandoned: In some cases, source code remains available, which can prove a historical artifact. One such case is [[PC-LISP]], still found online, which implements the [[Franz Lisp]] dialect. The DOS-based PC-LISP still runs well within emulators and on [[Microsoft Windows]].

==Implications==
If a software product reaches [[End-of-life (product)|end-of-life]] and becomes abandonware, users are confronted with several potential problems: missing purchase availability (besides used software) and missing [[technical support]], e.g. compatibility fixes for newer hardware and operating systems. These problems are exacerbated if software is bound ("[[dongle]]") to physical media with a limited life-expectancy ([[floppy disc]]s, [[optical media]] etc.) and backups are impossible because of [[copy protection]] or copyright law. If a software is distributed only in a [[Digital distribution|digital]], [[Digital rights management|DRM]]-locked form&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/nothing-lasts-forever-confronting-the-problem-of-video-game-preservation |title=Nothing Lasts Forever: Confronting the Problem of Video Game Preservation |quote=''How game historians are working to ensure the future of archiving as the medium shifts to an all-digital format.'' |publisher=usgamer.net |first=Anthony John |last=Agnello |date=February 19, 2014 |accessdate=July 10, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702151113/http://www.usgamer.net/articles/nothing-lasts-forever-confronting-the-problem-of-video-game-preservation |archivedate=July 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or as [[SaaS]], the shutdown of the servers will lead to a public loss of the software. If the software product is without alternative, the missing replacement availability becomes a challenge for continued software usage.

Also, once a software product has become abandonware for a developer, even historically important software might get lost forever very easily, as numerous cases have shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6271/where_games_go_to_sleep_the_game_.php |title=Where Games Go To Sleep: The Game Preservation Crisis, Part 1 |first=John |last=Andersen |quote=''The existence of decaying technology, disorganization, and poor storage could in theory put a video game to sleep permanently -- never to be played again. Troubling admissions have surfaced over the years concerning video game preservation.

Certain game titles could not see a re-release due to various issues.

==Response to abandonware==

===Early abandonware websites===
As response to the missing availability of abandonware, people have distributed old software since shortly after the beginning of [[Personal computer|personal computing]], but the activity remained low-key until the advent of the [[Internet]]. While trading old games has taken many names and forms, the term "abandonware" was coined by Peter Ringering in late 1996.&lt;ref name="ARingFAQ"/&gt; Ringering found classic game websites similar to his own, contacted their webmasters, and formed the original ''Abandonware Ring'' in February 1997.&lt;ref name="ARingFAQ"&gt;{{cite web |title =The Abandonware Ring FAQ | work = | publisher =The Official Abandonware Ring | year =2006 | url =http://www.abandonwarering.com/?Page=FAQ |accessdate=August 22, 2016 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070328073919/http://www.abandonwarering.com/?Page=FAQ| archivedate= March 28, 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This original [[webring]] was little more than a collection of sites linking to adventureclassicgaming.com. Another was a site indexing them all to provide a rudimentary search facility. In October 1997, the [[Interactive Digital Software Association]] sent [[cease and desist]] letters to all sites within the Abandonware Ring, which led to most shutting down. An [[unintended consequence]] (called the [[Streisand effect]] in Internet [[wiktionary:parlance|parlance]]) was that it spurred others to create new abandonware sites and organizations that came to outnumber the original Ring members. Sites formed after the demise of the original Abandonware Ring include [[Abandonia]], Bunny Abandonware and [[Home of the Underdogs]]. In later years abandonware websites actively acquired and received permissions from developers and copyright holders (e.g. [[Jeff Minter]], [[Magnetic Fields (video game developer)|Magnetic Fields]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemon64.com/games/permissions.php Permissions] on lemon64.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110814042804/http://www.c64gg.com/Mr_Chip_MF_DL.html Mr_Chip_MF_DL] on c64gg.com (archived)&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Gremlin Interactive]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gremlinworld.emuunlim.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402114725/http://gremlinworld.emuunlim.com/ |archivedate=April 2, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) for legal redistribution of abandoned works,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amigaforever.com/games/ Games] on [[Amiga Forever]] ''"The following is a list of the major sites which include thousands of downloadable Amiga games with permission of the copyright holders: Amiga Future, Amigaland, Ami Sector One, Back to the Roots, Borrowed Time, Dream17, Gremlin Graphics World, Games Coffer"''&lt;/ref&gt; an example is ''[[World of Spectrum]]'' who acquired the permission from many developers and successfully retracted a DMCA case.&lt;ref&gt;[https://slashdot.org/story/03/02/28/0747252/world-of-spectrum-gets-a-visit-from-the-idsa world-of-spectrum-gets-a-visit-from-the-idsa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531080840/http://slashdot.org/story/03/02/28/0747252/world-of-spectrum-gets-a-visit-from-the-idsa |date=May 31, 2012 }} on [[slashdot.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/03/07/games_anti_piracy_bot_fingers/ Games anti piracy bot fingers ZX Spectrum archive site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507033537/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/03/07/games_anti_piracy_bot_fingers/ |date=May 7, 2010 }} on [[theregister.com]] by John Lettice (7 Mar 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/permits/#sofar ARCHIVE - COPYRIGHTS AND DISTRIBUTION PERMISSIONS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417235847/http://www.worldofspectrum.org/permits/ |date=April 17, 2016 }} on worldofspectrum.org ''"Cases filed against World of Spectrum: IDSA / DMCA #922932 (14/2/2003 - result: case retracted)"''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/permits/publishers.html ARCHIVE - DISTRIBUTION PERMISSIONS - SOFTWARE HOUSES] on worldofspectrum.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archives===
Several websites archive abandonware for download, including old versions of applications which are difficult to find by any other means.

==Arguments for and against distribution==
Proponents of abandonware preservation argue that it is more ethical to make copies of such software than new software that still sells. Those ignorant of copyright law have incorrectly taken this to mean that abandonware is legal to distribute, although no software written since 1964 is old enough for copyright to have expired in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital-law-online.info/lpdi1.0/treatise17.html |title=Copyright of Computer Programs | year=2002 | first=Lee |last=Hollaar |accessdate=August 7, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080711181121/http://digital-law-online.info/lpdi1.0/treatise17.html| archivedate= July 11, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in cases where the original company no longer exists, the rights usually belong to someone else, though no one may be able to trace actual ownership, including the owners themselves.

Abandonware advocates also frequently cite historical preservation as a reason for trading abandoned software.&lt;ref name="ARingFAQ"/&gt; Older computer media are fragile and prone to rapid deterioration, necessitating transfer of these materials to more modern, stable media and generation of many copies to ensure the software will not simply disappear. Users of still-functional older computer systems argue for the need of abandonware because re-release of software by copyright holders will most likely target modern systems or incompatible media instead, preventing legal purchase of compatible software.

Those who oppose these practices argue that distribution denies the copyright holder potential sales, in the form of re-released titles, official emulation, and so on. Likewise, they argue that if people can acquire an old version of a program for free, they may be less likely to purchase a newer version if the old version meets their needs.

Some game developers showed sympathy for abandonware websites as they preserve their classical game titles.

==Law==
In most cases, software classed as abandonware is not in the [[public domain]], as it has never had its original copyright officially revoked and some company or individual may still own rights. While sharing of such software is usually considered copyright infringement, in practice copyright holders rarely enforce their abandonware copyrights for a number of reasons – chiefly among which the [[Digital obsolescence|software is technologically obsolete]] and therefore has no commercial value, therefore rendering copyright enforcement a pointless enterprise. By default, this may allow the product to de facto lapse into the public domain to such an extent that enforcement becomes impractical.

Rarely has any abandonware case gone to court, but it is still unlawful to distribute copies of old copyrighted software and games, with or without compensation, in any [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] signatory country.&lt;ref name="Joystiq"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.joystiq.com/2006/11/23/us-copyright-office-grants-abandonware-rights/ | title=US Copyright Office grants abandonware rights |first=Ross |last=Miller |accessdate = January 2, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080128134926/http://www.joystiq.com/2006/11/23/us-copyright-office-grants-abandonware-rights/| archivedate= January 28, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enforcement of copyright===
Old copyrights are usually left undefended. This can be due to intentional non-enforcement by owners due to software age or obsolescence, but sometimes results from a [[Corporation|corporate]] copyright holder going out of business without explicitly transferring ownership, leaving no one aware of the right to defend the copyright.

Even if the copyright is not defended, copying of such software is still unlawful in most jurisdictions when a copyright is still in effect. Abandonware changes hands on the assumption that the resources required to enforce copyrights outweigh benefits a copyright holder might realize from selling software licenses. Additionally, abandonware proponents argue that distributing software for which there is no one to defend the copyright is morally acceptable, even where unsupported by current law. Companies that have gone out of business without transferring their copyrights are an example of this; many hardware and software companies that developed older systems are long since out of business and precise documentation of the copyrights may not be readily available.

Often the availability of abandonware on the Internet is related to the willingness of copyright holders to defend their copyrights. For example, unencumbered games for [[Colecovision]] are markedly easier to find on the Internet than unencumbered games for [[Mattel]] [[Intellivision]] in large part because there is still a company that sells Intellivision games while no such company exists for the Colecovision.

===DMCA===
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) can be a problem for the preservation of old software as it prohibits required techniques. In October 2003, the US Congress passed 4 clauses to the DMCA which allow for reverse engineering software in case of preservation. {{quote|"3. Computer programs and video games distributed in formats that have become obsolete and which require the original media or hardware as a condition of access. ...The register has concluded that to the extent that libraries and archives wish to make preservation copies of published software and videogames that were distributed in formats that are (either because the physical medium on which they were distributed is no longer in use or because the use of an obsolete operating system is required), such activity is a noninfringing use covered by section 108(c) of the Copyright Act."|Exemption to Prohibition on Circumvention of Copyright Protection Systems for Access Control Technologies&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/1201/docs/fedreg-notice-final.pdf Exemption to Prohibition on Circumvention of Copyright Protection Systems for Access Control Technologies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928063920/http://www.copyright.gov/1201/docs/fedreg-notice-final.pdf |date=September 28, 2012 }} by LIBRARY OF CONGRESS Copyright Office 37 CFR Part 201 (Docket No. RM 2002-4E) (October 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In November 2006 the Library of Congress approved an exemption to the DMCA that permits the cracking of copy protection on software no longer being sold or supported by its copyright holder so that they can be archived and preserved without fear of retribution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2006/index.html Rulemaking on Exemptions from Prohibition on Circumvention of Technological Measures that Control Access to Copyrighted Works] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131123031312/http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2006/index.html |date=November 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/abandonware-now-legal/1100-6162308/ |title=Abandonware now legal? - Changes in copyright rules let gamers break copy protection on old games--in some circumstances. |date=November 27, 2006 |first=Emma |last=Boyes |publisher=[[GameSpot]].com |accessdate=January 11, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325120959/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/abandonware-now-legal/1100-6162308/ |archivedate=March 25, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===US copyright law===
Currently, US copyright law does not recognize the term or concept of "abandonware" while the general concept "orphan works" is recognized (see [[Orphan works in the United States]]). There is a long-held concept of abandonment in [[trademark law]] as a direct result of the infinite term of trademark protection. Currently, a copyright can be released into the public domain if the owner clearly does so in writing; however this formal process is not considered abandoning, but rather releasing. Those who do not own a copyright cannot merely claim the copyright abandoned and start using protected works without permission of the copyright holder, who could then seek [[legal remedy]].

Hosting and distributing copyrighted software without permission is illegal. Copyright holders, sometimes through the [[Entertainment Software Association]], send [[cease and desist letter]]s, and some sites have shut down or removed infringing software as a result. However, most of the Association's efforts are devoted to new games, due to those titles possessing the greatest value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/news/2002/01/49723?currentPage=1 | title = Abandonware: Dead Games Live On | publisher = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | last = King | first = Brad | date = January 19, 2002 | accessdate = April 2, 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121025232338/http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/news/2002/01/49723?currentPage=1 | archivedate = October 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the original copyright holder may be barred from bringing a court action, via a civil doctrine known as [[laches (equity)|laches]], which requires litigants to bring a viable civil action within a reasonable amount of time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

=== EU law ===
In the EU in 2012 an "Orphan Works Directive" ([[Directive 2012/28/EU]]) was constituted and is transferred into the member's laws. While the terminology has ambiguities regarding software and especially video games, some scholars argue that abandonware software video games fall under the definition of ''audiovisual works'' mentioned there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiig.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Maier_JIPITEC-2015-120_Games-as-cultural-heritage.pdf |title=Games as Cultural Heritage Copyright Challenges for Preserving (Orphan) Video Games in the EU |accessdate=January 18, 2016 |first=Henrike |last=Maier |publisher=[[Humboldt Universität zu Berlin]] |date=2015 |format=PDF |work=JIPITEC |page=120 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118035553/http://www.hiig.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Maier_JIPITEC-2015-120_Games-as-cultural-heritage.pdf |archivedate=January 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyright expiration===
{{main|List of countries' copyright lengths}}
Once the copyright on a piece of software has expired, it automatically falls into [[public domain]]. Such software can be legally distributed without restrictions. However, due to the length of [[copyright terms]] in most countries, this has yet to happen for most software. All countries that observe the [[Berne Convention]] enforce copyright ownership for at least 50 years after publication or the author's death. However, individual countries may choose to enforce copyrights for longer periods. In the United States, copyright durations are determined based on authorship. For most published works, the duration is 70 years after the author's death. However, for anonymous works, works published under a pseudonym or works made for hire, the duration is 120 years after publication. In France, copyright durations are 70 years after the relevant date (date of author's death or publication) for either class.

However, because of the length of [[copyright enforcement]] in most countries, it is likely that by the time a piece of software defaults to public domain, it will have long become obsolete, irrelevant, or incompatible with any existing hardware. Additionally, due to the relatively short commercial, as well as physical, lifespans of most digital media, it is entirely possible that by the time the copyright expires for a piece of software, it will no longer exist in any form. However, since the largest risk in dealing with abandonware is that of distribution, this may be mitigated somewhat by private users (or organizations such as the Internet Archive) making private copies of such software, which would then be legally redistributable at the time of copyright expiry.

==Alternatives to software abandoning==
There are alternatives for companies with a software product which faces the end-of-life instead of abandoning the software in an unsupported state.

===Availability as freeware===
{{main|List of commercial video games released as freeware}}
Sometimes user-communities convince companies to voluntarily relinquish copyright on software, putting it into the public domain, or [[Software relicensing|re-license]] it as [[free software]] or as freeware. Transfer of public domain or freely licensed software is perfectly legal, distinguishing it from abandonware which still has full copyright restrictions.

[[Amstrad]] is an example which supports emulation and free distribution of [[Amstrad CPC|CPC]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] hardware ROMs and software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!msg/comp.sys.amstrad.8bit/HtpBU2Bzv_U/HhNDSU3MksAJ |title=Amstrad ROM permissions |first=Cliff |last=Lawson |publisher=comp.sys.amstrad.8bit |quote=''1) What exactly do you have to do to use Sinclair ROMs in an emulator, such as acknowledgements etc?"

There are groups that lobby companies to release their software as freeware. These efforts have met with mixed results. One example is the library of educational titles released by [[MECC]]. MECC was sold to Brøderbund, which was sold to [[The Learning Company]]. When TLC was contacted about releasing classic MECC titles as freeware, the documentation proving that TLC held the rights to these titles could not be located, and therefore the rights for these titles are "in [[limbo]]" and may never be legally released.&lt;ref name="CanAbandonware"&gt;{{cite web | last=Savetz | first=Kevin | title =Can "Abandonware" Revive Forgotten Programs? | work = | publisher=byte.com |date=September 17, 2001 |url=http://www.savetz.com/articles/byte-abandonware.php?sort=date | accessdate = March 8, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213191159/http://www.savetz.com/articles/byte-abandonware.php?sort=date | archivedate=February 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That the copyright situation of vintage out-of-print software is lost or unclear is not uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/lost-in-limbo-on-the-hunt-for-pc-gamings-abandoned-classics/ |quote=''The saga of No One Lives Forever's resurrection has been a rollercoaster of ups and downs.

Even though many of the games on this list were made by small, dedicated studios, they still relied on companies like EA to get to market.

===Support by source code release===
{{main|Source code escrow}}
{{see also|List of commercial video games with later released source code}} {{see also|List of commercial software with available source code}}
The problem of missing technical support for a software can be most effectively solved when the source code becomes available. Therefore, several companies decided to release the source code specifically to allow the user communities to provide further technical software support (bug fixes, compatibility adaptions etc.) themselves,&lt;ref name="homesource"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidemacgames.com/news/story.php?ArticleID=8516 |title=Homeworld Source Code Released |date=October 8, 2003 |first=Andy |last=Largent |publisher=insidemacgames.com |accessdate=November 24, 2012 |quote=''With the release of Homeworld 2 for the PC, Relic Entertainment has decided to give back to their impressive fan community by releasing the source code to the original Homeworld.'' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012012745/http://www.insidemacgames.com/news/story.php?ArticleID=8516 |archivedate=October 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="allegiancesource"&gt;{{cite web|last=Colayco |first=Bob |title=Microsoft pledges Allegiance to its fanbase |publisher=[[gamespot.com]] |accessdate=July 22, 2011 |date=February 6, 2004 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-pledges-allegiance-to-its-fanbase/1100-6087574/ |quote=''The release of the source code came in response to the enthusiasm of Allegiance's small-but-dedicated fanbase. Microsoft's Joel Dehlin commented that the development team has "been amazed at the level to which some of the Allegiance fans have remained hard-core. We’re astounded at the progress that has been made at creating new factions, hosting new servers, replacing authentication, etc. It seems that Allegiance hasn’t really died. With that in mind, we’re releasing the Allegiance source code to the community."'' |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210103542/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-pledges-allegiance-to-its-fanbase/1100-6087574/ |archivedate=December 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. by [[community patch]]es or [[source port]]s to new [[computing platforms]]. For instance, in December 2015 Microsoft released the [[Windows Live Writer]] [[source code]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/12/microsoft-open-sources-live-writer-beloved-but-abandoned-blogging-tool/ Microsoft open-sources Live Writer, beloved but abandoned blogging tool] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612020134/http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/12/microsoft-open-sources-live-writer-beloved-but-abandoned-blogging-tool/ |date=June 12, 2016 }} by Peter Bright on [[Ars Technica]] ''"Opening the app means that it'll get some much-needed maintenance."'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; to allow the community to continue the support.

[[Id Software]] and [[3D Realms]] are early proponents in this practice, releasing the source code for the [[game engine]]s of some older titles under a [[free software license]] (but not the actual game content, such as levels or textures). Also [[Falcon 4.0]]'s lead designer Kevin Klemmick argued in 2011 that availability of the source code of his software for the community was a good thing: {{quote

The [[Chilling effect (law)|chilling effect]] of drawing a possible lawsuit can discourage release of source code. Efforts to persuade [[IBM]] to release [[OS/2]] as [[open source software]] were ignored&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osnews.com/story/19298/_I_m_Glad_That_IBM_Declined_to_Release_the_OS_2_Source_ | title=I'm Glad That IBM Declined to Release the OS/2 Source |date= February 7, 2008 |first= Michael |last=Reed |publisher=OSNews LLC |accessdate= May 30, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221095812/http://www.osnews.com/story/19298/_I_m_Glad_That_IBM_Declined_to_Release_the_OS_2_Source_ |archivedate=February 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; since some of the code was co-developed by Microsoft.

Nevertheless, several notable examples of successfully opened commercial software exist, for instance, the web browser [[Netscape Communicator]], which was released by [[Netscape Communications]] on March 31, 1998.&lt;ref name="netscapeopensource"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease558.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401072854/http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease558.html |archivedate=April 1, 2007 |date=January 22, 1998 |accessdate=August 8, 2013 |publisher=[[Netscape Communications Corporation]] |title=NETSCAPE ANNOUNCES PLANS TO MAKE NEXT-GENERATION COMMUNICATOR SOURCE CODE AVAILABLE FREE ON THE NET |quote=''BOLD MOVE TO HARNESS CREATIVE POWER OF THOUSANDS OF INTERNET DEVELOPERS; COMPANY MAKES NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR AND COMMUNICATOR 4.0 IMMEDIATELY FREE FOR ALL USERS, SEEDING MARKET FOR ENTERPRISE AND NETCENTER BUSINESSES ''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development was continued under the umbrella of the [[Mozilla Foundation]] and Netscape Communicator became the basis of several browsers, such as [[Mozilla Firefox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/netscape-celebrates-first-anniversary-of-open-source-software-release-to-mozillaorg-73806207.html |title= MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., April 1 /PRNewswire/ -- Netscape Communications and open source developers are celebrating the first anniversary, March 31, 1999, of the release of Netscape's browser source code to mozilla.org |accessdate=January 10, 2013 |date=March 31, 1999 |quote=''[...]The organization that manages open source developers working on the next generation of Netscape's browser and communication software.

Another important example for open sourced general software is the office suite [[StarOffice]] which was released by [[Sun Microsystems]] in October 2000 as [[OpenOffice.org]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxtoday.com/developer/2000101300221NWDTSW |title=StarOffice Code Released in Largest Open Source Project |date=October 13, 2000| first=Brian |last=Proffitt |quote=''Sun's joint effort with CollabNet kicked into high gear on the OpenOffice Web site at 5&amp;nbsp;a.m. PST this morning with the release of much of the source code for the upcoming 6.0 version of StarOffice.

There are also many examples in the video game domain: [[Revolution Software]] released their game ''[[Beneath a Steel Sky]]'' as freeware and gave the engine's source code to the authors of [[ScummVM]] to add support for the game. Other examples are ''[[Myth II]]'',&lt;ref name="mythalive2004"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2004/06/10/mythdevelopers.html |title=Keeping the Myths Alive |first=Howard |last=Wen |date=June 10, 2004 |accessdate=December 22, 2012 |publisher=linuxdevcenter.com |quote=''[...]fans of the Myth trilogy have taken this idea a step further: they have official access to the source code for the Myth games.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2203">At [[common law]] an '''abatement in pleading''' or '''plea in abatement''', was a [[defense (legal)|defence]] to [[legal proceedings]], which did not contest the principle of the [[plaintiff]]'s [[Legal_remedy|right to relief]], but contended that the plaintiff had made a procedural error, and needed to bring fresh proceedings, which followed the correct procedure. The objection could deal with (among others) place, time, or method of assertion. The plea in abatement was abolished as a particular form of response by the defendant when common-law pleading was replaced by Code Pleading and later by pleading rules, such as the [[federal Rules of Civil Procedure]].&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|1993|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=black&gt;{{harvnb|Garner|Schultz|Cooper|Powell|1999|p=1172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Successful assertion of pleas in abatement merely pause proceedings until the problem is remedied.&lt;ref name=black/&gt; There were two fundamental styles of abatement. The first was abatement in proceedings which would merely suspend the proceeding until the error was fixed. Abatement in law would terminate it completely, although it could be restarted at the plaintiff's request. The second term is more common.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; It has now been abolished in most if not all common law jurisdictions.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4267">'''Administrative guidance''' is non-binding [[advice (opinion)|advice]] given by an [[administrative agency]] to the public regarding how best to [[regulatory compliance|comply]] with a particular law or regulation. It may also be referred to by terms such as "advice" or "recommendation."  
Guidance is often used to explain the objective or interpretation of a vague or nonspecific law or requirement.

==Types of guidance documents==

While guidance documents are not usually enforceable rules or requirements by themselves, they often define standards or expectations which are part of a rule or requirement.   For example, a regulation might require adequate testing for relevant microorganisms in sterile containers and a guidance document would be used to explain what testing is adequate and which organisms are relevant.

Guidance documents are also used to explain internal policies or practices to simplify an organization's interactions with other parties.  For example, a guidance document could explain how to prepare a report or what information should be gathered before submitting a complaint.

==Japan==
{{nihongo|Administrative guidance|行政指導|gyōsei shidō}} is a [[Japan]]ese government practice defined under Article 2 of the [[Administrative Procedure Act (Japan)|Administrative Procedure Act]] of 1993 as "guidance, recommendations, advice, or other acts by which an Administrative Organ may seek, within the scope of its duties or affairs under its jurisdiction, certain action or inaction on the part of specified persons in order to realize administrative aims, where such acts are not Dispositions."&lt;ref name="apa-ja"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.cas.go.jp/jp/seisaku/hourei/data/APA_2.pdf |title=Administrative Procedure Act (Japanese/English text)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the [[government of Japan]] employed this practice in imposing its policies on individuals and organizations, implying poorer treatment for those who failed to comply with its non-binding advice.

The Act of 1993 was the first [[statute]] to specifically regulate the practice of administrative guidance. Under the Act:

* A government agency may not treat a person in an adverse manner solely because that person failed to follow administrative guidance (article 32.2).
* Administrative guidance may not be used to pressure a petitioner into withdrawing or modifying a petition once they have indicated an intent not to do so (article 33).
* The content of administrative guidance and the identity of the official responsible must be made clear to the counterparty (article 35.1).
* Verbal administrative guidance must be followed by a summary in writing if the counterparty demands it (article 35.2).

==United States==
In [[United States]] law, although administrative guidance is not generally binding on the public as a whole, it may serve as [[persuasive authority]] regarding the correct interpretation of the law.&lt;ref name="aman"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=American Journal of Comparative Law|last=Aman|first= Alfred C.|title=Informal Agency Actions and U.S. Administrative Law -- Informal Procedure in a Global Era|year=1994|url=http://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1579&amp;context=facpub}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, if guidance has been voluntarily sought by a member of the public, it may be binding on the person who sought it.&lt;ref name="aman"/&gt;

===Good guidance practice===

In the United States, guidance documents published by [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] agencies are required to follow a set of requirements to ensure that the documents they publish are useful and accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oig.hhs.gov/guidance/docs/OMB_FedReg_good_guidance.pdf|title=Final Bulletin for Agency Good Guidance Practices|publisher=[[Federal Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These rules are referred to as "[[GxP|good guidance practice]]" (GGP) and require specific controls.  For example, agencies have to ask for public comment before publishing major guidance documents, similar to the requirements for new rules and regulations.

The '''Allied Forces Act 1940''' (3 &amp; 4 Geo. VI c. 51) was an [[Act of Parliament]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] passed in late 1940, after the fall of France.

The Act gave legal authority for the recognised sovereign governments of [[Belgium]], [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]] and [[Poland]] – all countries then under German occupation – to raise, equip and maintain independent armed forces on British soil. A sixth country, [[France]], was provided for by authorising the activity of the [[Free French]] forces under [[Charles de Gaulle|General de Gaulle]]. The forces would be fully independent, under their own operational command and military law, though in practice it was expected that the British high command would direct general strategy and control joint operations. The Act would later be extended to cover [[Luxembourg]], [[Greece]] and [[Yugoslavia]].

It allowed these nations to remain active and independent allies in the war, rather than simply providing manpower and moral support to the [[United Kingdom]] and the remainder of the British Empire.

{{cquote|It was essential that these foreign Governments, after being invited to come to this country, should have their own national armies here. These armies are the symbol of nationhood to millions of people and to their enslaved countrymen throughout Europe. I trust that, when the time arrives to which the Prime Minister pointed yesterday, and when there is a great resurgence in those countries, these armies will be the spearhead of the Forces of liberation and will see them through their present perils and trials.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hastings Lees-Smith]], debate in Parliament on the Armed Forces Bill, 21 August 1940&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the Act was passed, national units were quickly formed or reconstituted; by late October, the size of the Allied contingents serving with Home Forces were given as 18,000 Poles, 15,000 Norwegians and 3,000 Czechs, as well as around 3,000 Belgian, Dutch and French soldiers, as well as a large number of naval and air-force personnel.&lt;ref&gt;p.60. ''Invasion 1940'', [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter Fleming]]. Hamish Hamilton, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bamberg State Library ''' ({{lang-de|'''Staatsbibliothek Bamberg'''}}) is a combined [[universal library|universal]], [[regional library|regional]] and [[research library]] with priority given to the [[humanities]]. Today it is housed in the [[Bamberg#Sights|New Residence]], the former [[prince-bishop]]'s new palace. The [[Free State of Bavaria]] is responsible for the library.

== Overview ==
The Bamberg State Library supplies the town of [[Bamberg]] and the region [[Upper Franconia]] with literature for [[research]] and [[higher education]] purposes, professional work and advanced training. The historically grown holdings of more than 500,000 [[volume (bibliography)|volumes]] are continuously supplemented and enlarged by acquisitions in all general fields, and in specialized areas such as the [[history]] and [[geography]] of (Upper) [[Franconia]], [[art history]] and appreciation, [[manuscripts]] and the printed [[book]].

It cooperates in all areas of [[librarianship]] with the [[University Library of Bamberg]].

One of its regional tasks is to acquire documentary material on and of persons who are connected with the region.

More over it gets the [[legal deposit]] for the region of Upper Franconia; that means the Bamberg State Library receives a [[copy (written)|copy]] of every book published in Upper Franconia and continues to compile a complete [[bibliography]] of the region.

It also provides space for book collections belonging to Bamberg institutions such as the Bamberg [[Historical Society]] ({{lang-de|Historischer Verein Bamberg}}), the Bamberg Society of [[Naturalists]] ({{lang-de|Naturforschende Gesellschaft Bamberg}}), the Bamberg [[Art Association]] ({{lang-de|Kunstverein Bamberg}}) the [[E.-T.-A.-Hoffmann-Gesellschaft]] and the Bamberg group of the [[Frankenbund]].

Its high esteem to be a [[research library]] of international rank is based on its rich manuscripts holdings. This collection may be traced back to the [[Holy Roman Emperor|emperor]] [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]], who founded the [[bishopric of Bamberg]] on November 1, 1007. Three of these manuscripts became part of [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World]]: 
* the [[Bamberg Apocalypse]] ({{lang-de|Bamberger Apokalypse}}; Msc.Bibl.140), 
* the Commentary on the [[Song of Songs]], on the [[Book of Proverbs]] and on the [[Book of Daniel]] ({{lang-de|Kommentar zum Hohen Lied, zu den Sprüchen Salomos und zum Buch Daniel}}; Msc.Bibl.22), and
* the Lorsch [[Pharmacopoeia]] ({{lang-de|Lorscher Arzneibuch}}; Msc.Med.1).

== Holdings in figures ==
* 545,000 [[volume (bibliography)|volumes]] in total
* 80,000 [[graphics]]  and [[photographs]]
* 3,550 [[incunabula]]  (15th century prints)
* 6,350 [[manuscript]]s  in total (1,000 [[Middle Ages|medieval]]  manuscripts)
* 1,750 current [[Academic journal|journals]]

== History ==
The nucleus of the collection may be traced back to the emperor Henry II, who founded the bishopric of Bamberg in 1007. Among his gifts to the [[Bamberg Cathedral|cathedral]] were many precious manuscripts, which he and his predecessors had collected or commissioned. Manuscripts from various spiritual centres of the [[Western world]] were brought to Bamberg as a result. In the ensuing period many books were written and [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] in the town, notably in the 12th century by the [[Benedictine]] monks of the [[Michaelsberg Abbey, Bamberg|Michaelsberg Abbey]].

Bamberg was the first place where printed books in the German language were illustrated with [[woodcut]]s. Although only fragments of the very first period of printing in Bamberg can be found in the library, the collection of 3,500 [[incunabula]] documents the wide range of book production in the 15th century.

All that remained of these manuscripts and books in the monasteries of the town and bishopric up to 1802/1803 was incorporated into one library (now the Bamberg State Library) during the period of [[German Mediatisation]]  and merged with the library of the old [[University of Bamberg]], which had been founded in 1648 as a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] academy and was closed at that time. Bamberg became part of the [[Electorate of Bavaria]]. In the course of the 19th century the library was enriched by gifts such as [[Joseph Heller (art historian)|Joseph Heller's]] collection, which today comprises 80,000 prints and drawings. The [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]] material became a [[special collections|special collection]] in our times, as did, more recently, [[autograph book]]s from the 18th and 19th century.

== Building ==
The Bamberg State Library nowadays is housed in the east wing of the [[Bamberg#Sights|New Residence]] of Bamberg which was  built in 1697–1703 by [[Johann Leonhard Dientzenhofer]] on behalf of Prince-Bishop [[Lothar Franz von Schönborn]]. Originally, the administration of the bishopric was placed in that wing of the building.

The so-called Dominikanerräume are part of the library's showrooms which are not open to public. They are so called because of the [[bookcase|bookshelves]] from Bamberg's [[Dominican Order|Dominican monastery]] that were brought to the library during the secularisation when the monastery was closed down.

The Vierzehnheiligenpavillion on the third floor also belongs to the internal showrooms. It was the prince-bishop's library room. Since 1978, the former [[wine cellar]] serves as closed access stacks.
The library presents in the entrance hall precious [[stained glass]] dating from the 16th and 17th centuries. Joseph Heller, an art historian and collector, left them as legacy to the library.
The [[Reference library|reading room]] can be reached from the entrance hall. In former times, it served the prince-bishop as audience room and summer room. The reading room provides a view over the [[Bamberg#Sights|rose garden]] which also was built on behalf of Prince-Bishop Lothar Franz von Schönborn.
During the exhibitions taking place several times a year the Sternengewölbe and the former Gartensaal – or Scagliolasaal – can be visited.

The '''Brussels Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules with Respect to Assistance and Salvage at Sea''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|Convention pour l'unification de certaines règles en matiere assistance et de sauvetage maritimes}}) is a treaty on [[marine salvage]] that was concluded on 23 September 1910, in [[Brussels]], Belgium.&lt;ref name="LoS"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161220101451/https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/jus/jus/JUR5401/h08/undervisningsmateriale/Svante_Salvage.ppt The Law of Salvage], Professor, jur. dr Svante O. Johansson, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, the convention remains in force in over 70 states.&lt;ref name=ratifications&gt;[http://diplomatie.belgium.be/fr/binaries/i2a_tcm313-79745.pdf Ratifications] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913012926/http://diplomatie.belgium.be/fr/binaries/i2a_tcm313-79745.pdf |date=13 September 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The states that have denounced the convention after accepting it are [[Canada]], [[Croatia]], [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], [[Iran]], [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Spain]], and [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name = ratifications/&gt;

The Brussels Convention forms the basis of current international [[marine salvage]] law.&lt;ref name="LoS"/&gt; The Convention was amended by a Protocol issued in Brussels on 27 May 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Protocol to amend the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law relating to Assistance and Salvage at Sea of 23 September 1910|url=http://www.admiraltylawguide.com/conven/protosalvage1967.html| accessdate= 2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Brussels Convention has been overridden in some countries by the 1989 [[International Convention on Salvage]], which took effect in 1996. Some states that have ratified the 1989 Convention have denounced the 1910 Convention.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10339">The '''business judgment rule''' is a [[case law]]-derived doctrine in [[corporations law]] that courts defer to the business judgment of corporate executives. It is rooted in the principle that the "directors of a corporation... are clothed with [the] presumption, which the law accords to them, of being [motivated] in their conduct by a [[bona fide]] regard for the interests of the corporation whose affairs the stockholders have committed to their charge".&lt;ref name=Gimbel&gt;''Gimbel v. Signal Cos.'', 316 A.2d 599, 608 (Del. Ch. 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;  The rule exists in some form in most [[common law]] countries, including the United States,&lt;ref name=Gimbel /&gt; Canada,&lt;ref&gt;''[[BCE Inc v 1976 Debentureholders]]'', 2008 SCC 69 (CanLII), [2008] 3 SCR 560&lt;/ref&gt; England and Wales,&lt;ref&gt;[[Companies Act 2006]] section 172; ''[[Re Smith &amp; Fawcett Ltd]]'' [1942] Ch 304&lt;/ref&gt; and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Corporations Act 2001]], section 180(2); ''[[Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich]]'' [2009] NSWSC 1229&lt;/ref&gt;

To challenge the actions of a corporation's [[board of directors]], a plaintiff assumes "the burden of providing evidence that directors, in reaching their challenged decision, breached any one of the triads of their [[fiduciary duty]] — [[good faith]], [[Duty of Loyalty|loyalty]], or [[Duty of care (business associations)|due care]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Cede &amp; Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., 634 A.2d 345, 361 (Del. 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;  Failing to do so, a plaintiff "is not entitled to any remedy unless the transaction constitutes waste... [that is,] the exchange was so one-sided that no business person of ordinary, sound judgment could conclude that the corporation has received adequate consideration".&lt;ref&gt;''In re The Walt Disney Co. Derivative Litigation'', 906 A.2d 27 (Del. June 8, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis ==
{{Corporate law|doctrines}}

Given that the directors cannot ensure corporate success, the business judgment rule specifies that the court will not review the business decisions of directors who performed their duties (1) in [[good faith]]; (2) with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances; and (3) in a manner the directors reasonably believe to be in the best interests of the corporation.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Aronson v. Lewis]]'', 473 A.2d 805, 812 (1984); ''[[Kaplan v. Centex Corp.]]'', Del. Ch., 284 A.2d 119, 124 (1971); ''[[Robinson v. Pittsburgh Oil Refinery Corp.]]'', Del. Ch., 14 Del. Ch. 193, 126 A. 46 (1926)&lt;/ref&gt; As part of their duty of care, directors have a duty not to waste corporate assets by overpaying for property or employment services. The business judgment rule is very difficult to overcome and courts will not interfere with directors unless it is clear that they are guilty of fraud or misappropriation of the corporate funds, etc.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Aronson v. Lewis]]'', 473 A.2d 805, 812 (1984); ''[[Puma v. Marriott]]'', Del. Ch., 283 A.2d 693, 695 (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

In effect, the business judgment rule creates a strong [[presumption]] in favor of the board of directors of a corporation, freeing its members from possible liability for decisions that result in harm to the corporation. The presumption is that "in making business decisions not involving direct self-interest or self-dealing, corporate directors act on an informed basis, in good faith, and in the honest belief that their actions are in the corporation's best interest."&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In short, it exists so that a board will not suffer legal action simply from a bad decision. As the [[Delaware Supreme Court]] has said, a court "will not substitute its own notions of what is or is not sound business judgment"&lt;ref name="Aronson"&gt;''[https://law.justia.com/cases/delaware/supreme-court/1971/280-a-2d-717-3.html Sinclair Oil Corp. v. Levien]'', 280 A.2d 717, 720 (Del. 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; if "the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sinclair Oil Corp. v. Levien]]'', 280 A.2d 717, 720 (Del. 1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duty of care and duty of loyalty==

Although a distinct common law concept from [[Duty of care (business associations)|duty of care]], [[duty of loyalty]] is often evaluated by courts in certain cases dealing with violations by the board. While the business judgment rule is historically linked particularly to the duty of care standard of conduct,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Smith v. Van Gorkom]]'', 488 A.2d 858 (1985), at 872-73. The judgment notes "A director's duty to exercise an informed business judgment is in the nature of a duty of care, as distinguished from a duty of loyalty."&lt;/ref&gt; shareholders who sue the directors often charge both the duty of care and duty of loyalty violations. 

This forced the courts to evaluate duty of care (employing the business judgment rule standard of review) together with duty of loyalty violations that involve self-interest violations (as opposed to gross incompetence with duty of care). Violations of the duty of care are reviewed under a [[gross negligence]] standard, as opposed to simple [[negligence]]. 

Consequently, over time, one of the points of review that has entered the business judgment rule was the prohibition against self-interest transactions. Conflicting interest transactions occur when a director, who has a conflicting interest with respect to a transaction, knows that she or a related person is (1) a party to the transaction; (2) has a beneficial financial interest in, or closely linked to, the transaction that the interest would reasonably be expected to influence the director's judgment if she were to vote on the transaction; or (3) is a director, general partner, agent, or employee of another entity with whom the corporation is transacting business and the transaction is of such importance to the corporation that it would in the normal course of business be brought before the board.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Guth v. Loft]]'', 5 A.2d 503 (1939), at 510.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standard of review==
The following test was constructed in the opinion for ''Grobow v. Perot'', 539 A.2d 180 (Del. 1988), as a guideline for satisfaction of the business judgment rule.  Directors in a business should:
*act in good faith;
*act in the best interests of the corporation;
*act on an informed basis;
*not be wasteful;
*not involve self-interest (duty of loyalty concept plays a role here).

==Rationale==
Under the [[Delaware General Corporation Law]], the business judgment rule is the offspring of the fundamental principle, codified in Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, § 141(a), that the business and affairs of a Delaware corporation are managed by or under its board of directors. In carrying out their managerial roles, directors are charged with an unyielding fiduciary duty to the corporation.&lt;ref name="Gorkom"&gt;''[[Smith v. Van Gorkom]]'', 488 A.2d 858 (Del. 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale for the rule is the recognition by courts that, in the inherently risky environment of business, Boards of Directors need to be free to take risks without a constant fear of lawsuits affecting their judgment.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Gagliardi v. TriFoods Int’l Inc.'', 683 A.2d 1049, 1052 (Del. Ch. 1996) (setting out rationale for the rule).&lt;/ref&gt;

The presumption raised by the Business Judgment Rule may be rebutted by the [[plaintiff]]. "The business judgment rule is a presumption that in making a business decision, the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company. Thus, the party attacking a board decision as uninformed must rebut the presumption that its business judgment was an informed one."&lt;ref name="Gorkom"/&gt; Further, rebuttal typically requires a showing that the defendants violated duty of care or loyalty (with courts assuming director's good faith otherwise). 

If the plaintiff can show that an action should not be protected by the business judgment rule (such as when a director decides to give over a certain percentage of the company's profits to charity (duty of care violation) or lines his/her own pockets with company's money (self-interest/duty of loyalty violation)), then the burden will shift to the defendant to show that the action meets the burden of [[good faith]]/rational decision. In many cases, it is relatively easy for a director to find some rational reason for his actions and, with the courts using the business judgment rule, the case will likely be dismissed (U.S. courts disdain getting involved in business matters). All directors must have the option of vetoing the decision.

Frequently, the winning cases for plaintiffs involving the business judgment rule involve acts constituting corporate waste. Also, note that some Board decisions lie outside the business judgment rule.  For instance, in the takeover context, courts will apply the more stringent [[Unocal Corp. v. Mesa Petroleum Co.|''Unocal'' test]], also called intermediate scrutiny. Illegal decisions are also not protected by the business judgment rule. &lt;ref&gt;''[[Miller v. American Telephone %26 Telegraph Co.]]'' 507 F.2d 759 (3rd Cir. 1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest cases, ''[[Dodge v. Ford Motor Co.]]'', ruled, for example, that "courts of equity will not interfere in the management of the directors unless it is clearly made to appear that they are guilty of fraud or misappropriation of the corporate funds, or refuse to declare a dividend when the corporation has a surplus of net profits which it can, without detriment to its business, divide among its stockholders, and when a refusal to do so would amount to such an abuse of discretion as would constitute a fraud, or breach of that good faith which they are bound to exercise towards the stockholders."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dodge v. Ford Motor Co.]]'', 204 Mich. 459, 170 N.W. 668 (1919).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Capitol Square Review &amp; Advisory Board v. Pinette''''', 515 U.S. 753 (1995),&lt;ref name=SCOTUS&gt;{{ussc|name=Capitol Square Review &amp; Advisory Board v. Pinette|volume=515|page=753|pin=|year=1995}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case that focused on [[First Amendment]] rights and the [[Establishment Clause]].  Vincent Pinette, an active member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in Columbus, Ohio, wanted to place an unattended cross on the lawn of the Capitol Square during the 1993 Christmas season.  Pinette and his fellow members of the KKK submitted their request.  The advisory board originally denied this request.  However, Pinette and the other members of the Ohio Chapter of the Klan fought this decision in the United States District Court of Southern Ohio.  The court found in favor of the Klan and the Advisory Board issued the permit.  The Board appealed to the United States Court of Appeals, which affirmed the decision of the district court.  The board made one last petition to the Supreme Court where the decision was made, by a vote of seven to two, that the Klan was permitted to display the cross at the public forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board v. Pinette|url=http://www.casebriefs.com/blog/law/constitutional-law/constitutional-law-keyed-to-cohen/religion-and-the-constitution/capitol-square-review-and-advisory-board-v-pinette/|accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Historical Context===
The land in question was the Capitol Square in [[Columbus, Ohio]].  The ten acre area had always been "available for discussion of public questions and for public activities an advisory board was responsible for regulating public access to the square, and to use the square a group simply had to submit an application to the board and meet several criteria that were neutral as to the speech content of the proposed use." &lt;ref name=SCOTUS/&gt; In the past, the advisory board approved displays had included Christmas trees, menorahs, and various other religious-based decorations.

Beneath the surface, there was an issue that was more worrisome than the religious implications of the cross itself.  The cross's association with the Ku Klux Klan was a concern to the State of Ohio.  In 1993, racial tensions between whites and blacks in the United States were high.  There were race riots in Los Angeles, the KKK had several active chapters across the country, and the United States was struggled to maintain equality and peace for all citizens.  These underlying tensions accounted for much of the conflict in Capitol Square. Allowing the Ku Klux Klan to erect one of their white crosses on the lawn of the Statehouse in Ohio went much deeper than religion. However, as recognized by the Justices, "the facts before us and the opinions address only the Establishment Clause issue, and that is the sole question before us to decide."  The Advisory Board could do nothing to prevent the Klan from displaying their cross on state-owned land.

===The Conflict===
The case surrounded the issue of the interpretation of both the First Amendment and the Establishment Clause in the United States Constitution.  The Capitol Square in Columbus, Ohio was a state-owned piece of land and any and all unattended displays had to be approved by the Advisory Board.  However, over the years the area had become a [[public forum]] where people were permitted to hold public gatherings and leave unattended displays that were both secular and religious in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Biers|first=Sam|title=Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U.S. 753 (1995|url=http://www.4lawschool.com/conlaw/pinette.shtml|accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The job of the Advisory Board was to issue permits and regulate the content of the displays that took place in the Square.  They were to make their decisions within the bounds of the First Amendment and the Establishment Clause.  The Establishment Clause states that Congress cannot make a law "respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to the Establishment Clause|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/estabinto.htm|accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  so the Board had to follow the same protocol in their decisions as well.  The Board denied the Ku Klux Klan's permit request "on the grounds that the permit would violate the Establishment Clause," on the same day that they approved the display of a menorah on the square.&lt;ref name=SCOTUS/&gt; Pinette and the other Klansmen appealed this decision.

==Opinion of the Court==

===Summary of Majority Opinion===
Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] delivered the majority opinion of the court on June 22, 1995.  He was joined by Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]], Justice [[Stephen Breyer]], and Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]].  The court held that:

# Private religious speech is protected under the free speech clause of the First Amendment
# Although the state has the right to make content-based restrictions on speech, the board's denial of the Klan's application to display the cross on the statehouse square was not justified on the grounds of the establishment clause.

Traditionally, the square had been recognized as a public forum by the general population and because the display of religion was purely private it could not violate the Establishment Clause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CAPITOL SQUARE REVIEW AND ADVISORY BD. v. PINETTE|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1990-1999/1994/1994_94_780/|accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Advisory Board was still responsible for the content displayed on the square, but they could not intentionally block a religious display from being set up.

===Concurrence===
*Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] concurred with the Court's ruling on the Establishment Clause, but felt that the Klan's primary goal with the cross did not exclusively serve a religious purpose, but also included political motive.  He wanted to make the note that the KKK was likely using the cross as both a religious display as well as an obvious political statement.
*Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] concurred in part and concurred "in the judgment," but recognized the benefit of a sign disclaiming government sponsorship or endorsement on the Klan cross, which would make the State's role clear to the community.  The state would benefit from prominently displaying signs that tell the public that they have no direct connection to anything displayed on the square.
*Justice [[David Souter]] concurred with the court's ruling, but he also wanted to add that he felt it was in the best interest of the State of Ohio to place a permanent sign that served as a disclaimer for any and all government sponsorship or endorsement of the display.

===Dissenting Opinion===
*Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] dissented from the majority opinion, and was joined by Justice Ginsburg.
Stevens felt that the situation violated the establishment clause under the [[Endorsement Test]].  Even though Capitol Square in Ohio had turned into a public forum and it had allowed other various private groups to place unattended displays on the property, that did not prove that it was not in violation of the Establishment Clause.  Stevens wanted to strengthen the separation of church and state. 
*Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] also dissented. She stated that if the Establishment Clause is truly intended to separate church and state then the government can neither permit, and the court cannot order, any religious items to be displayed.  She felt that, if based on the Constitution, the board was not permitted to not allow certain displays to be shown, then by the same interpretation the court cannot force any particular display to be shown either.&lt;ref name=SCOTUS/&gt;

==Historical Significance==
Capital Square Review v. Pinette is an important case because of its relationship to the various other cases dealing with the Establishment Clause and the First Amendment.  
Cases such as ''[[Lemon v. Kurtzman]]'', ''[[Lynch v. Donnelly]]'', and ''[[County of Allegheny v. ACLU]]'' are similarly themed situations.  All of these cases showcase the Supreme Court's unclear stance on issues involving the First Amendment and the Establishment Clause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Kathryn|title=Constitutional Law- Squeezing Lemons- Capitol Square Review &amp; Advisory Board v. Pinette|journal=Temple Law Review|issue=Winter, 1996|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/|accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In ''[[Lemon v. Kurtzman]]'', {{ussc|403|602|1971|el=no}}, the Establishment of Religion Clause was brought into question.  This 1971 case was one of the earlier cases, which involved the Supreme Court ruling that Pennsylvania's 1968 Nonpublic Elementary and Secondary Act violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  The act established a system that had the public school system financially aiding nonpublic, and usually Catholic, schools for their school's expenses.  The court decided that the act was unconstitutional, and their decision established the "Lemon Test" which offered a three-pronged approach to religion related cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Lemon v. Kurtzman|403|602|1971}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In ''[[Lynch v. Donnelly]]'', {{ussc|465|668|1984|el=no}} the Supreme Court was faced with another issue of with the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  It was alleged that the seasonal Christmas display that included a crèche in Pawtucket, Rhode Island was unconstitutional and in violation of the Establishment Clause.  Daniel Donnelly filed suit against Pawtucket mayor, Dennis Lynch and won in both the District Court and the Court of Appeals.  However the U.S Supreme Court overturned the past decisions and ruled that the Christmas display was not a government endorsement of any particular message and did not violate the Establishment Clause.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Lynch v. Donnelly|465|668|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In ''[[County of Allegheny v. ACLU]]'', {{ussc|492|573|1989|el=no}} two separate holiday displays in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania were challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union.  The first display was a Christian nativity scene inside the Allegheny County Courthouse.  The other display was a large Hanukkah menorah placed outside the City-County building.  The court found the crèche in violation of the Establishment Clause because they felt the main purpose of the display was to endorse religion.  However, the same court ruled that the menorah was within constitutional appropriateness because of its "particular physical setting." &lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=County of Allegheny v. ACLU|492|573|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these court cases, along with the numerous others, show that American courts have not articulated a consistent, clear rule explaining the government's relationship to religious expression, particularly if that expression occurs in government-supported settings. The Supreme Court is still searching for a consistent rationale for deciding cases in which the First Amendment's speech and establishment clauses intersect.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10930">The [[People's Republic of China]] is an officially atheist state, which while having freedom of religion as a principle nominally enshrined with the laws and constitution of the country, nevertheless possesses a number of laws that restrict religious activities within China.

This article details the various pieces of legislation governing religious activities in China. For a more detailed look at the topic of freedom of religion in China, see article: [[Religious freedom in China]].

== 1982 Constitution (last amended in 2004) ==

(see [[s:Constitution of the People's Republic of China|Constitution of China]])

Article 36 of the Chinese constitution explicitly deals with religious affairs. It states:

"The People's Republic of China has freedom of faith and religion

No state organization, social group or individual may force a citizen to accept or not to accept a religious faith, nor can they discriminate against either religious or non-religious citizens.

The state protects normal religious activities. No one may use religion to make an attack on the order of society, harm the physical health of citizens, or impede the activities of the state's education system.

Religious groups and religious affairs shall not be subject to the power of foreign domination." &lt;ref&gt;http://news.newsxc.com/folder696/2014-12-04/200429.html, retrieved May 4th 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Banning discrimination against religious citizens in China is usually not interpreted to mean that positions in the government or military are equally open to believers in religions. Communist party membership is often a prerequisite for many government or military positions, and the communist party will frequently not allow religious believers to be members on account of their religious beliefs.

'Normal religious activities' is interpreted to mean religious activities carried out by religious bodies that have official government approval. Religions that are not legally permitted to exist in China, like the [[Falun Gong]] or [[Jehovah's witnesses]] are not protected by the constitution. Religious groups that are not registered by the government, like Catholics who are part of an underground church or protestant house churches, are not protected by the constitution. Furthermore, religious activities by approved groups that do not conform to the many regulations governing religion in China are also not protected by the constitution.

'impede the activities of the state's education system' is usually interpreted to mean that educational institutions in China are not permitted to teach religion to students. What this means is that religion can be taught as a subject, but actual religious teaching (ie. teaching that is intended to help a person to follow a particular religious faith) is considered to be a form of 'impeding the activities of the state's education system' and as such, it is banned by the constitution.

'the power of foreign domination' is usually interpreted to mean that religious bodies in China may not be under the control of foreigners. For example, Roman Catholics may not be under the control of the Pope and the bishops of China must not be subject to the Vatican.

== 2004 Regulations on Religious Affairs==
(see [[s:Regulations on Religious Affairs (PRC)|Regulations on Religious Affairs]])

In 2004, the Chinese government issued a detailed set of regulations governing religious activities in China. These regulations replaced a previous set of regulations from 1994.

The regulations required that religious sites, religious ministers, religious schools, religious publications and collective religious activities in general needed government registration or approval, and the regulations set out the procedures by which registration or permissions were to be given. Most of these activities or items were placed under the supervision of religious affairs departments at different levels of the Chinese government and religious bodies in China were obligated to accept government supervision from these departments.

The regulations also gave a number of protections to religions in China. For example, it banned Chinese citizens from going to approved religious sites with the purpose of disrupting religious activities or of trying to spread atheism. It also guaranteed the lawful rights of believers in carrying out religious activities within approved religious sites.

One of the key parts of the document is chapter 3, governing 'religious activity centres'. In article 12, it states:

"Article 12 – Collective religious activities of believing citizens, in general should be held in the registered religious activity centre (Buddhist temple, Taoist temple, mosque, church and other fixed religious activity centres), under the management of the religious activity centre or the religious organization, conducted by the religious ministers or others who meet the relevant rules of the religion, and done in accordance with the religious creeds and canons."

While the text of the document itself places no explicit universal ban on religious activities from taking place outside of approved religious sites, these regulations are usually interpreted to mean that religious activities involving a large number of people are not allowed to be conducted outside of an approved religious site. There is no definition given as to how many people constitute a 'collective religious activity', however, the regulations in article 6 state:

"Article 6 - The establishment, alteration or cancellation of religious groups shall be handled in accordance with the &lt;&lt;Regulations on Administration and Registration of Social Groups&gt;&gt;

The statutes of religious groups should conform with the relevant rules of the &lt;&lt;Regulations on Administration and Registration of Social Groups&gt;&gt;.

Religious groups that conduct activities in accordance with the statutes, are protected by the law."

The 'Regulations on Administration and Registration of Social Groups' (社会团体登记管理条例) are a group of regulations from 1998 governing the registration of any social group (whether religious or not) within China, and those regulations themselves state that a minimum of 50 persons is required in order to make the application to become a registered group.

These regulations concerning religious sites in China are usually interpreted to mean that things like [[house churches]] or other similar sites where believers of a particular religion congregate in large numbers on a regular basis to conduct religious services or religious activities, are not permitted to legally exist.

Things that involve tiny numbers of believers, like religious believers who read scriptures or pray at home, are usually not interpreted to be banned by these regulations. Similarly, the burning of [[joss paper]], a traditional Chinese religious practice wherein people will burn fake paper money or similar things as a ritual offering to dead ancestors or Taoist gods, is actually widely practiced in the open public in China (literally on the city streets themselves), but these laws are usually not interpreted to forbid this.

==1994 Rules on the Religious Activities of foreigners in China==
(see [[s:Administrative Rules for the Religious Activities of Foreigners within the borders of the People's Republic of China|Administrative Rules for the Religious Activities of Foreigners within the borders of the People's Republic of China]])

These rules from 1994 are rules governing the religious activities of foreigners within China. The rules protect the rights of foreigners in China to attend religious services or participate in religious activities at approved religious sites. The rules even allow for foreigners to engage in religious preaching or teaching within approved religious sites, so long as they do so with the permission of the approved Chinese religious group.

However, these rules also place a number of restrictions on foreigners in China. They do not allow for foreigners to engage in missionary activities, such as ordaining new religious ministers or converting Chinese citizens to their religion.

Foreign missionaries who come to China are permitted to carry out preaching or religious services within approved religious sites, by these rules, so long as they have the permission of the Chinese religious group, however, outside of the approved religious sites, they are not permitted to carry out most kinds of missionary activities. They can be a religious 'presence', but they cannot engage in preaching in the open public.

==2000 Implementation instructions on Rules for Religious Activities of foreigners ==
(see [[s:Detailed Instructions on the Implementation of the Administrative Rules for the Religious Activities of Foreigners within the Borders of the People's Republic of China|Detailed Instructions on the Implementation of the Administrative Rules for the Religious Activities of Foreigners within the Borders of the People's Republic of China]]

In 2000, the Chinese government issued guidelines regarding the rules for the religious activities of foreigners. These guidelines reiterated, clarified and expanded many of the things from the previous rules. Included among the things mentioned were such things like the explicit banning of foreigners from making religious publications in China, banning foreigners from spreading religious materials in China, banning foreigners from running religious training classes and requiring foreign religious ministers (other than visitors) that preach at Chinese religious sites to be registered with the government.

These instructions provided guidelines for how relations between foreigners and Chinese should occur in the religious sphere, such as rules regarding foreign teachers hired by Chinese religious schools, rules regarding Chinese ministers that give religious rites to foreigners or rules regarding foreign students that study at Chinese religious schools.

The rules once again allowed for foreigners to take part or engage in religious activities at approved religious sites, including preaching or teaching, so long as the relevant rules and guidelines were followed. It once again also did not allow for foreigners to convert Chinese citizens or ordain Chinese citizens as religious ministers.

==2006 Procedures for the Registration of Religious Ministers==

These rules from 2006 simply detail the procedures used in order to register religious ministers in China. Religious ministers who do not conform to these procedures are not permitted to serve in Chinese religious bodies.&lt;ref&gt;http://baike.baidu.com/link?url=lQn8nWFWbGojpdoEHYs-sBrS8jjtVFk-dBPh2Acl0Se6Zu7bBs1GPWNmwelRfyrJabqK0B8H5rQmXwRF3rTLkuVUng51RKRh6bxO_WBo_loeIpd7MIQE9DVfGqC62CldvhHFc-mmUvlefR3dlRocY2oIwpWKhIC3ZUfjR3xNiEeHl_9eaiKEBNLizmqKGu6FKND4kolq0v-MNkvn2Ra2cK, retrieved June 5th 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Civil procedure''' is the body of [[law]] that sets out the rules and standards that [[court]]s follow when [[adjudication|adjudicating]] [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] [[lawsuits]] (as opposed to [[criminal procedure|procedures]] in [[criminal law]] matters). These rules govern how a [[lawsuit]] or [[Legal case|case]] may be commenced; what kind of [[service of process]] (if any) is required; the types of [[pleading]]s or [[statements of case]], [[motion (legal)|motion]]s or applications, and [[court order|order]]s allowed in civil cases; the timing and manner of [[deposition (law)|deposition]]s and [[discovery (law)|discovery]] or disclosure; the conduct of [[trial (law)|trial]]s; the process for [[Judgment (law)|judgment]]; various available [[Legal remedy|remedies]]; and how the courts and clerks must function.

==Differences between civil and criminal procedure==
Some systems, including the [[England|English]] and [[France|French]], allow governmental persons to bring a [[criminal prosecution]] against another person. Prosecutions are nearly always started by the [[State (polity)|state]] in order to punish the accused. [[Civil action]]s, on the other hand, are started by private [[individual]]s, companies or organizations, for their own benefit. In addition, governments (or their subdivisions or agencies) may also be parties to civil actions.  The cases are usually in different courts.  However this is distinguished from civil penal actions.

In jurisdictions based on English common-law systems, the party bringing a criminal charge (in most cases, the state) is called the "prosecution", but the party bringing most forms of civil action is the "plaintiff"  or "claimant". In both kinds of action the other party is known as the "defendant". A criminal case against a person called Ms. Sanchez would be described as “The People v. (=&amp;nbsp;"versus", "against" or "and") Sanchez,” "The State (or Commonwealth) v. Sanchez" or "[The name of the State] v. Sanchez"  in the United States and “R. (Regina, that is, the [[Queen regnant|Queen]]) v. Sanchez” in England and Wales. But a civil action between Ms. Sanchez and a Mr. Smith would be “Sanchez v. Smith” if it were started by Sanchez, and “Smith v. Sanchez” if it were started by Mr. Smith (though the order of parties' names can change if the case is appealed).&lt;ref&gt;[[Case citation#Supreme Court of the United States]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most countries make a clear distinction between civil and criminal procedure. For example, a [[criminal court]] may force a convicted defendant to pay a fine as punishment for his crime, and the [[criminal costs|legal cost]]s of both the [[prosecution]] and defence. But the victim of the [[crime]] generally pursues his claim for [[Damages|compensation]] in a civil, not a criminal, action.&lt;ref name = "law1" /&gt; In France and England, however, a victim of a crime may incidentally be awarded compensation by a criminal court [[judge]].

Evidence from a [[criminal trial]] is generally admissible as evidence in a civil action about the same matter. For example, the victim of a road accident does not directly benefit if the driver who injured him is found guilty of the crime of careless driving. He still has to prove his case in a civil action, unless the doctrine of [[collateral estoppel]] applies, as it does in most American jurisdictions.&lt;ref name = "law1" /&gt; In fact he may be able to prove his civil case even when the driver is found not guilty in the criminal trial, because the standard to determine guilt is higher than the standard to determine fault. However, if a driver is found by a civil jury not to have been negligent, a prosecutor may be estopped from charging him criminally.

If the plaintiff has shown that the defendant is liable, the main remedy in a civil court is the amount of [[money]], or "damages", which the defendant should pay to the plaintiff.&lt;ref name="law1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard Powell|title=Law today|publisher=Longman|location=Harlow|year=1993 |pages=34|isbn=978-0-582-05635-0 |oclc=30075861|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative civil remedies include restitution or transfer of property, or an injunction to restrain or order certain actions.

The [[Legal burden of proof|standards of proof]] are higher in a [[criminal]] case than in a civil one, since the state does not wish to risk punishing an innocent person. In [[English law]] the prosecution must prove the guilt of a criminal “[[beyond reasonable doubt]]”; but the [[plaintiff]] in a civil action is required to prove his case “on the balance of probabilities”.&lt;ref name = "law1" /&gt; Thus, in a criminal case a crime cannot be proven if the person or persons judging it doubt the guilt of the suspect and have a reason (not just a feeling or intuition) for this doubt. But in a civil case, the court will weigh all the evidence and decide what is most probable.

==Civil procedural types==
Civil procedure is traditionally divided into inquisitorial and adversarial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=2280682|title=Civil Procedure in Cross-Cultural Dialogue: Eurasia Context|author=|date=|work=ssrn.com|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''collateralized debt obligation''' ('''CDO''') is a type of [[structured finance|structured]] [[asset-backed security]] (ABS).&lt;ref&gt;An "asset-backed security" is sometimes used as an umbrella term for a type of security backed by a pool of assets—including collateralized debt obligations and [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] (Example: "A capital market in which ''asset-backed securities'' are issued and traded is composed of three main categories: ABS, MBS and CDOs". (italics added) (source: {{cite web|last=Vink|first=Dennis|title=ABS, MBS and CDO compared: an empirical analysis|url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/10381/2/MPRA_paper_10381.pdf|work=August 2007|publisher=Munich Personal RePEc Archive|accessdate=13 July 2013}})&lt;br&gt;—and sometimes for a particular type of that security—one backed by consumer loans (example: "As a rule of thumb, securitization issues backed by mortgages are called MBS, and securitization issues backed by debt obligations are called CDO, [and] Securitization issues backed by consumer-backed products—car loans, consumer loans and credit cards, among others—are called ''ABS'' ... (italics added, source {{cite web|last=Vink|first=Dennis|title=ABS, MBS and CDO compared: an empirical analysis|url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/10381/2/MPRA_paper_10381.pdf|work=August 2007|publisher=Munich Personal RePEc Archive|accessdate=13 July 2013}}, &lt;br&gt;see also {{cite web|title=What are Asset-Backed Securities? |url=http://www.investinginbonds.com/learnmore.asp?catid=5&amp;subcatid=16&amp;id=10#sthash.roSaSia3.dpuf|publisher=SIFMA|accessdate=13 July 2013|quote=Asset-backed securities, called ABS, are bonds or notes backed by financial assets. Typically the assets consist of receivables other than mortgage loans, such as credit card receivables, auto loans, manufactured-housing contracts and home-equity loans.}})&lt;/ref&gt; Originally developed as instruments for the corporate debt markets, after 2002 CDOs became vehicles for refinancing mortgage-backed securities (MBS).&lt;ref name="Lepke 2013"&gt;Lepke, Lins and Pi card, ''Mortgage-Backed Securities'', §5:15 (Thomson West, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://philadelphiafed.org/-/media/research-and-data/publications/working-papers/2011/wp11-30R.pdf|title=COLLATERAL DAMAGE: SIZING AND ASSESSING THE SUBPRIME CDO CRISIS|last=Cordell|first=Larry|date=May 2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Like other private label securities backed by assets, a CDO can be thought of as a promise to pay investors in a prescribed sequence, based on the cash flow the CDO collects from the pool of bonds or other assets it owns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Azad|first1=C|title=Collaterised debt obligations (CDO)|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cdo.asp|website=www.investopedia.com|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distinctively, CDO credit risk is typically assessed based on a PD derived from ratings on those bonds or assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bis.org/publ/work163.pdf|title=CDO rating methodology: Some thoughts on model risk and its implications|last=Kiff|first=John|date=November 2004|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDO is "sliced" into [[tranche|"tranches"]], which "catch" the cash flow of interest and principal payments in sequence based on seniority.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koehler|first1=Christian|title=The Relationship between the Complexity of Financial Derivatives and Systemic Risk|journal=Working Paper|pages=17|ssrn=2511541}}&lt;/ref&gt; If some loans default and the cash collected by the CDO is insufficient to pay all of its investors, those in the lowest, most "junior" tranches suffer losses first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Azad|first1=C|title=How CDOs work|url=http://www.investinganswers.com/financial-dictionary/bonds/collateralized-debt-obligation-cdo-2123|website=www.investinganswers.com|publisher=Investing answers|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last to lose payment from default are the safest, most senior tranches. Consequently, [[coupon (bond)|coupon]] payments (and interest rates) vary by tranche with the safest/most senior tranches receiving the lowest rates and the lowest tranches receiving the highest rates to compensate for higher [[default risk]]. As an example, a CDO might issue the following tranches in order of safeness: Senior AAA (sometimes known as "super senior"); Junior AAA; AA; A; BBB; Residual.&lt;ref name="Lemke 2014"&gt;Lemke, Lins and Smith, ''Regulation of Investment Companies'' (Matthew Bender, 2014 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

Separate [[Special purpose entity|special purpose entities]]—rather than the parent [[investment bank]]—issue the CDOs and pay interest to investors. As CDOs developed, some sponsors repackaged tranches into yet another iteration, known as "[[CDO-Squared]]", "CDOs of CDOs" or "[[synthetic CDO]]s".&lt;ref name="Lemke 2014"/&gt;

In the early 2000s, the debt underpinning CDOs was generally diversified,&lt;ref&gt;McLean, Bethany and Joe Nocera, ''All the Devils Are Here, the Hidden History of the Financial Crisis'', Portfolio, Penguin, 2010, p.120&lt;/ref&gt; but by 2006–2007—when the CDO market grew to hundreds of billions of dollars—this had changed. CDO collateral became dominated by high risk ([[Credit ratings#Corporate credit ratings|BBB or A]]) tranches recycled from other asset-backed securities, whose assets were usually subprime mortgages.&lt;ref name=FCIR-p127&gt;''[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf Final Report of the National Commission on the Causes of the Financial and Economic Crisis in the United States]'', aka ''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', p.127&lt;/ref&gt; These CDOs have been called "the engine that powered the mortgage supply chain" for subprime mortgages,&lt;ref name=FCIR-130/&gt; and are credited with giving lenders greater incentive to make subprime loans,&lt;ref name=FCIR-133/&gt; leading to the 2007-2009 [[subprime mortgage crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Michael |year=2010 |title=The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine |location=England |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=9781846142574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market history==

===Beginnings===

In 1970, the US government backed mortgage guarantor [[Ginnie Mae]] created the first MBS ([[mortgage-backed security]]), based on FHA and VA mortgages. It guaranteed these MBSs.&lt;ref&gt;McClean, Nocera, p 7&lt;/ref&gt; This would be the precursor to CDOs that would be created two decades later. In 1971, [[Freddie Mac]] issued its first Mortgage Participation Certificate . This was the first [[mortgage-backed security]] made of ordinary mortgages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/freddie-mac-nyse-fre History of Freddie Mac].&lt;/ref&gt; All through the 1970s, private companies began mortgage asset securitization by creating private mortgage pools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Asset Securitization Comptroller's Handbook |url= http://www.dallasfed.org/news/ca/2005/05wallstreet_assets.pdf |date= November 1997 |publisher= US Comptroller of the Currency Administrator of National Banks |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081218013346/http://www.dallasfed.org/news/ca/2005/05wallstreet_assets.pdf |archivedate= 2008-12-18 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, the [[Equal Credit Opportunity Act]] in USA imposed heavy sanctions for financial institutions found guilty of discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age&lt;ref&gt;Regulation B, Equal Credit Opportunity 12 CFR 202.14(b) as stated in [http://www.bos.frb.org/commdev/commaff/closingt.pd Closing the Gap: A Guide to Equal Opportunity Lending]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[Federal Reserve System]] of Boston.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a more open policy of giving loans (sometimes subprime) by banks, guaranteed in most cases by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In 1977, the [[Community Reinvestment Act]] was enacted to address historical discrimination in lending, such as '[[redlining]]'. The Act encouraged commercial banks and savings associations (Savings and loan banks) to meet the needs of borrowers in all segments of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods (who might earlier have been thought of as too risky for home loans).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/6500-2515.html Text of Housing and Community Development Act of 1977—title Viii (Community Reinvestment)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916032800/http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/6500-2515.html |date=2008-09-16 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Federal Reserve"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/dcca/cra/|title=Community Reinvestment Act|publisher=Federal Reserve|accessdate=2008-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the investment bank [[Salomon Brothers]] created a  "private label" MBS (mortgage backed security) - one that did not involve GSE mortgages. However, it failed in the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;McClean, Nocera, p 12&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, [[Lewis Ranieri]] ([[Salomon Brothers|Salomon]]) and [[Laurence D. Fink|Larry Fink]] ([[First Boston]]) invented the idea of [[securitization]]; different mortgages were pooled together and this pool was then sliced into [[tranche]]s, each of which was then sold separately to different investors.&lt;ref&gt;McClean, Nocera, p 5&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these tranches were in turn bundled together, earning them the name CDO (Collateralised debt obligation).&lt;ref&gt;Liar's Poker, Michael Lewis&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first CDOs to be issued by a private bank were seen in 1987 by the bankers at the now-defunct [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]] Inc. for the also now-defunct Imperial Savings Association.&lt;ref name=Cresci&gt;{{cite web|last=Cresci|first=Gregory|title=Merrill, Citigroup Record CDO Fees Earned in Top Growth Market|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a.FcDwf1.ZG4|work=August 30, 2005|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s the collateral of CDOs was generally [[Corporate bond|corporate]] and [[Emerging market debt|emerging market bonds]] and bank loans.&lt;ref name=FCIR-129&gt;''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', 2011, p.129&lt;/ref&gt; After 1998 "multi-sector" CDOs were developed by Prudential Securities,&lt;ref name=FCIR-129-30&gt;''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', 2011, p.129-30&lt;/ref&gt; but CDOs remained fairly obscure until after 2000.&lt;ref name="Nocera, p.120"&gt;McLean and Nocera, ''All the Devils Are Here'', 2010 p.120&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 and 2003 CDOs had a setback when rating agencies "were forced to downgrade hundreds" of the securities,&lt;ref name="Nocera, p.121"&gt;McLean and Nocera, ''All the Devils Are Here'', 2010 p.121&lt;/ref&gt; but sales of CDOs grew—from $69 billion in 2000 to around $500 billion in 2006.&lt;ref name=mclean-p123/&gt; From 2004 through 2007, $1.4 trillion worth of CDOs were issued.&lt;ref name=Endangerment-283&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgenson|first=Gretchen|title=Reckless Endangerment : How Outsized ambition, Greed and Corruption Led to Economic Armageddon|year=2011|publisher=Times Books, Henry Holt and Company|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FwUW2yuJzW0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Morgenson+and+Rosner+%27%27Reckless+Endangerment%27%27,+2010&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GHXhUdSjKJTYyQGc6oGABA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Morgenson%20and%20Rosner%20%27%27Reckless%20Endangerment%27%27%2C%202010&amp;f=false|author2=Joshua Rosner|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early CDOs were diversified, and might include everything from aircraft lease-equipment debt, manufactured housing loans, to student loans and credit card debt. The diversification of borrowers in these "multisector CDOs" was a selling point, as it meant that if there was a downturn in one industry like aircraft manufacturing and their loans defaulted, other industries like manufactured housing might be unaffected.&lt;ref name="reckless-279"&gt;Morgenson and Rosner ''Reckless Endangerment'', 2010 pp.279-280&lt;/ref&gt; Another selling point was that CDOs offered returns that were sometimes 2-3 percentage points higher than corporate bonds with the same credit rating.&lt;ref name="reckless-279"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLean and Nocera, ''All the Devils Are Here'', 2010 p.189&lt;/ref&gt;

====Explanations for growth====
* '''Advantages of securitization''' – Depository banks had incentive to "[[Securitization|securitize]]" loans they originated—often in the form of CDO securities—because this removes the loans from their books. The transfer of these loans (along with related risk) to security-buying investors in return for cash replenishes the banks' capital. This enabled them to remain in compliance with [[capital requirement]] laws while lending again and generating additional origination fees.
* '''Global demand for fixed income investments''' – From 2000 to 2007, worldwide fixed income investment (i.e. investments in bonds and other conservative securities) roughly doubled in size to $70 trillion, yet the supply of relatively safe, income generating investments had not grown as fast, which bid up bond prices and drove down interest rates.&lt;ref name="giantpoolpeabody"&gt;Public Radio International.

* '''Low interest rates''' – Fears of deflation, the bursting of the [[dot-com bubble]], a U.S. recession, and the U.S. trade deficit kept interest rates low globally from 2000 to 2004-5, according to Economist [[Mark Zandi]].&lt;ref&gt;of [[Moody's Analytics]]&lt;/ref&gt; The low yield of the safe [[United States Treasury security|US Treasury bonds]] created demand by global investors for subprime mortgage-backed CDOs with their relatively high-yields but credit ratings as high as the Treasuries.

Around 2005, as the CDO market continued to grow, subprime mortgages began to replace the diversified consumer loans as collateral. By 2004, mortgage-backed securities accounted for more than half of the collateral in CDOs.&lt;ref name=FCIR-130/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;One study based on a sample of 735 CDO deals originated between 1999 and 2007, found the percentage of CDO assets made up of lower level tranches from non-prime mortgage-backed securities (nonprime means subprime and other less-than-prime mortgages, mainly [[Alt-A]] mortgages) grew from 5% to 36% (source: [http://www.hks.harvard.edu/m-rcbg/students/dunlop/2009-CDOmeltdown.pdf Anna Katherine Barnett-Hart The Story of the CDO Market Meltdown: An Empirical Analysis-March 2009]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Other sources give an even higher proportion. In the fall of 2005 Gene Park, an executive at AIG Financial Products division found, "The percentage of subprime securities in the CDOs wasn't 10 percent – it was 85 percent!" (source: McLean and Nocera, ''All the Devils Are Here'', 2010 (p.201)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An email by Park to his superior is also quoted in the ''Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'' p.201: "The CDO of the ABS market ... is currently at a state where deals are almost totally reliant on subprime/nonprime mortgage residential mortgage collateral."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Still another source (''[[The Big Short]]'', [[Michael Lewis]], p.71) says:&lt;br&gt;"The 'consumer loans' piles that Wall Street firms, led by Goldman Sachs, asked AIG FP to insure went from being 2% subprime mortgages to being 95% subprime mortgages. In a matter of months, AIG-FP, in effect, bought $50 billion in triple-B-rated subprime mortgage bonds by insuring them against default. And yet no one said anything about it ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 2007, 47% of CDOs were backed by structured products, such as mortgages; 45% of CDOs were backed by loans, and only less than 10% of CDOs were backed by fixed income securities. (source: [http://www.abalert.com/Public/MarketPlace/Ranking/index.cfm?files=disp&amp;article_id=1044676277 Securitization rankings of bookrunners, issuers, etc.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929065713/http://www.abalert.com/Public/MarketPlace/Ranking/index.cfm?files=disp&amp;article_id=1044676277 |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', "the CDO became the engine that powered the mortgage supply chain",&lt;ref name=FCIR-130/&gt; promoting an increase in demand for mortgage-backed securities without which lenders would have "had less reason to push so hard to make" non-prime loans.&lt;ref name=FCIR-133&gt;''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', 2011, p.133&lt;/ref&gt; CDOs not only bought crucial tranches of subprime mortgage-backed securities, they provided cash for the initial funding of the securities.&lt;ref name=FCIR-130&gt;''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', 2011, p.130&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2003 and 2007, Wall Street issued almost $700 billion in CDOs that included mortgage-backed securities as collateral.&lt;ref name="FCIR-130"/&gt;

CDOs, like mortgage-backed securities, were financed with debt, enhancing their profits but also enhancing losses if the market reversed course.&lt;ref name=FCIR-134&gt;''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', 2011, p.134, section="Leverage is inherent in CDOs"&lt;/ref&gt;

====Explanations for growth====
Subprime mortgages had been financed by [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] (MBS). Like CDOs, MBSs were structured into tranches, but issuers of the securities had difficulty selling the more lower level/lower-rated "mezzanine" tranches—the tranches rated somewhere from AA to BB.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Because most traditional mortgage investors are risk-averse, either because of the restrictions of their investment charters or business practices, they are interested in buying the higher-rated segments of the loan stack; as a result, those slices are easiest to sell. The more challenging task is finding buyers for the riskier pieces of at the bottom of the pile. The way mortgage securities are structured, if you cannot find buyers for the lower-rated slices, the rest of the pool cannot be sold.&lt;ref name=reckless-278&gt;Morgenson and Rosner ''Reckless Endangerment'', 2010 p.278&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also ''Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', p.127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To deal with the problem investment bankers "recycled" the mezzanine tranches, selling them to underwriters making more structured securities—CDOs. Though the pool that made up the CDO collateral might be overwhelmingly mezzanine tranches, most of the tranches (70&lt;ref&gt;70%. "Firms bought mortgage-backed bonds with the very highest yields they could find and reassembled them into new CDOs. The original bonds ... could be lower-rated securities that once reassembled into a new CDO would wind up with as much as 70% of the tranches rated triple-A. Ratings arbitrage, Wall Street called this practice. A more accurate term would have been ratings laundering." (source: McLean and Nocera, ''All the Devils Are Here'', 2010 p.122)&lt;/ref&gt; to 80%&lt;ref&gt;80%. "Approximately 80% of these CDO tranches would be rated triple-A despite the fact that they generally comprised the lower-rated tranches of mortgage-backed securities. (source: ''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', 2011, p.127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;80%. "In a CDO you gathered a 100 different mortgage bonds—usually the riskiest lower floors of the original tower ... They bear a lower credit rating triple-B. ... if you could somehow get them rerated as triple-A, thereby lowering their perceived risk, however dishonestly and artificially. This is what Goldman Sachs had cleverly done. It was absurd. The 100 buildings occupied the same floodplain; in the event of flood, the ground floors of all of them were equally exposed. But never mind: the rating agencies, who were paid fat fees by Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms for each deal they rated, pronounced 80% of the new tower of debt triple-A." (source: Michael Lewis, ''The Big Short : Inside the Doomsday Machine'' WW Norton and Co, 2010, p.73)&lt;/ref&gt;)
of the CDO were rated not BBB, A-, etc., but triple A. The minority of the tranches that were mezzanine were often bought up by other CDOs, concentrating the lower rated tranches still further. (See the chart on "The Theory of How the Financial System Created AAA-rated Assets out of Subprime Mortgages".)

As one journalist ([[Gretchen Morgenson]]) put it, CDOs became "the perfect dumping ground for the low-rated slices Wall Street couldn't sell on its own."&lt;ref name=reckless-278/&gt;

Other factors explaining the popularity of CDOs include:
* Growing demand for fixed income investments that started earlier in the decade continued.&lt;ref name="giantpoolpeabody"/&gt;&lt;ref name="giantpool"/&gt; A "global savings glut"&lt;ref&gt;''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', 2011, p.103&lt;/ref&gt; leading to "large capital inflows" from abroad helped finance the housing boom, keeping down US mortgage rates, even after the [[Federal Reserve Bank]] had raised interest rates to cool off the economy.&lt;ref&gt;''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', 2011, p.104&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Supply (economics)|Supply]] generated by "hefty" fees the CDO industry earned. According to "one hedge fund manager who became a big investor in CDOs", as much "as 40 to 50 percent" of the cash flow generated by the assets in a CDO went to "pay the bankers, the CDO manager, the rating agencies, and others who took out fees."&lt;ref name="Nocera, p.121"/&gt; Rating agencies in particular—whose high ratings of the CDO tranches were crucial to the industry and who were paid by CDO issuers—earned extraordinary profits. [[Moody's Investors Service]], one of the two biggest rating agencies, could earn "as much as $250,000 to rate a mortgage pool with $350 million in assets, versus the $50,000 in fees generated when rating a municipal bond of a similar size." In 2006, revenues from Moody's structured finance division "accounted for fully 44%" of all Moody's sales.&lt;ref name=reckless-280&gt;Morgenson and Rosner ''Reckless Endangerment'', 2010 p.280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also: [https://archive.is/20120716084801/http://noir.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a6NdKd8CfR2A Bloomberg-Flawed Credit Ratings Reap Profits as Regulators Fail Investors-April 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Moody's [[operating margin]]s were "consistently over 50%, making it one of the most profitable companies in existence"—more profitable in terms of margins than [[Exxon Mobil]] or [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref name=McLean-124/&gt; Between the time Moody's was spun off as a public company and February 2007, its stock rose 340%.&lt;ref name=McLean-124&gt;McLean and Nocera, ''All the Devils Are Here'', p.124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/now/shows/446/index.html PBS-Credit and Credibility-December 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Trust in rating agencies. CDO managers "didn't always have to disclose what the securities contained" because the contents of the CDO were subject to change. But this lack of transparency did not affect demand for the securities. Investors "weren't so much buying a security. They were buying a triple-A rating," according to business journalists [[Bethany McLean]] and [[Joe Nocera]].&lt;ref name="Nocera, p.121"/&gt;
* [[Financial innovation]]s, such as [[credit default swap]]s and [[synthetic CDO]]. Credit default swaps provided insurance to investors against the possibility of losses in the value of tranches from default in exchange for premium-like payments, making CDOs appear "to be virtually risk-free" to investors.&lt;ref name=FCIR-132&gt;''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', 2011, p.132&lt;/ref&gt; Synthetic CDOs were cheaper and easier to create than original "cash" CDOs. Synthetics "referenced" cash CDOs, replacing interest payments from MBS tranches with premium-like payments from credit default swaps. Rather than providing funding for housing, synthetic CDO-buying investors were in effect providing insurance against mortgage default.&lt;ref&gt;"Unlike the traditional cash CDO, synthetic CDOs contained no actual tranches of mortgage-backed securities ... in the place of real mortgage assets, these CDOs contained credit default swaps and did not finance a single home purchase." (source: ''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', 2011, p.142)&lt;/ref&gt; If the CDO did not perform per contractual requirements, one counterparty (typically a large [[investment bank]] or [[hedge fund]]) had to pay another.&lt;ref name="propublica.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.propublica.org/feature/all-the-magnetar-trade-how-one-hedge-fund-helped-keep-the-housing-bubble |title=The Magnetar Trade: How One Hedge Fund Helped Keep the Bubble Going (Single Page)-April 2010 |access-date=2017-10-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410084812/http://www.propublica.org/feature/all-the-magnetar-trade-how-one-hedge-fund-helped-keep-the-housing-bubble |archive-date=2010-04-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As underwriting standards deteriorated and the housing market became saturated, subprime mortgages became less abundant. Synthetic CDOs began to fill in for the original cash CDOs. Because more than one—in fact numerous—synthetics could be made to reference the same original, the amount of money that moved among market participants increased dramatically.

While non-prime mortgage defaults affected all securities backed by mortgages, CDOs were especially hard hit. More than half—$300 billion worth—of tranches issued in 2005, 2006, and 2007 rated most safe (triple-A) by rating agencies, were either downgraded to junk status or lost principal by 2009.&lt;ref name=impaired/&gt; In comparison, only small fractions of triple-A tranches of Alt-A or subprime mortgage-backed securities suffered the same fate. (See the Impaired Securities chart.)

Collateralized debt obligations also made up over half ($542 billion) of the nearly trillion dollars in losses suffered by financial institutions from 2007 to early 2009.&lt;ref name=hart/&gt;

===Criticism===
Prior to the crisis, a few academics, analysts and investors such as [[Warren Buffett]] (who famously disparaged CDOs and other derivatives as "financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Warren Buffet on Derivatives|url=http://www.fintools.com/docs/Warren%20Buffet%20on%20Derivatives.pdf|work=Following are edited excerpts from the Berkshire Hathaway annual report for 2002.|publisher=fintools.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]'s former chief economist [[Raghuram Rajan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://mostlyeconomics.wordpress.com/2008/01/22/raghu-rajan-analyses-subprime-crisis/ Raghu Rajan analyses subprime crisis]| Mostly Economics| (from a speech given on December 17, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; warned that rather than reducing risk through diversification, CDOs and other derivatives spread risk and uncertainty about the value of the underlying assets more widely.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

During and after the crisis, criticism of the CDO market was more vocal. According to the radio documentary "Giant Pool of Money", it was the strong demand for MBS and CDO, that drove down home lending standards. Mortgages were needed for collateral and by approximately 2003, the supply of mortgages originated at traditional lending standards had been exhausted.&lt;ref name=giantpool/&gt;

The head of banking supervision and regulation at the Federal Reserve, Patrick Parkinson, termed "the whole concept of ABS CDOs", an "abomination".&lt;ref name="FCIR-129"/&gt;

In December 2007, journalists Carrick Mollenkamp and Serena Ng wrote of a CDO called Norma created by Merrill Lynch at the behest of Illinois hedge fund, Magnetar. It was a tailor-made bet on subprime mortgages that went "too far." Janet Tavakoli, a Chicago consultant who specializes in CDOs, said Norma "is a tangled hairball of risk." When it came to market in March 2007, "any savvy investor would have thrown this...in the trash bin."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB119871820846351717 Wall Street Wizardry Amplified Risk], ''Wall Street Journal'', December 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ng, Serena, and Mollenkamp, Carrick.

According to journalists Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera, no securities became "more pervasive -- or [did] more damage than collateralized debt obligations" to create the [[Great Recession]].&lt;ref name="Nocera, p.120"/&gt;

Gretchen Morgenson described the securities as "a sort of secret refuse heap for toxic mortgages [that] created even more demand for bad loans from wanton lenders."
&lt;blockquote&gt;CDOs prolonged the mania, vastly amplifying the losses that investors would suffer and ballooning the amounts of taxpayer money that would be required to rescue companies like Citigroup and the American International Group." ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgenson|first=Gretchen|title=Reckless Endangerment : How Outsized ambition, Greed and Corruption Led to Economic Armageddon|year=2011|publisher=Times Books, Henry Holt and Company|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FwUW2yuJzW0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Morgenson+and+Rosner+%27%27Reckless+Endangerment%27%27,+2010&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GHXhUdSjKJTYyQGc6oGABA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Morgenson%20and%20Rosner%20%27%27Reckless%20Endangerment%27%27%2C%202010&amp;f=false|author2=Joshua Rosner|page=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the first quarter of 2008 alone, [[Credit rating agency|credit rating agencies]] announced 4,485 downgrades of CDOs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/marketsNewsUS/idUKN0947372020080409 | work=Reuters | title=CDO deals resurface but down 90 pct in Q1-report | date=2008-04-09 | first=Dena | last=Aubin}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least some analysts complained the agencies over-relied on computer models with imprecise inputs, failed to account adequately for large risks (like a nationwide collapse of housing values), and assumed the risk of the low rated tranches that made up CDOs would be diluted when in fact the mortgage risks were highly correlated, and when one mortgage defaulted, many did, affected by the same financial events.&lt;ref name=hart/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', 2011, p.118-121&lt;/ref&gt;

They were strongly criticized by economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]], among others. Stiglitz considered the agencies "one of the key culprits" of the crisis that "performed that alchemy that converted the securities from F-rated to A-rated. The banks could not have done what they did without the complicity of the ratings agencies."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;sid=ah839IWTLP9s Bloomberg-Smith-Bringing Down Ratings Let Loose Subprime Scourge]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;sid=ax3vfya_Vtdo Bloomberg-Smith-Race to Bottom at Rating Agencies Secured Subprime Boom, Bust]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Morgenson, the agencies had pretended to transform "dross into gold."&lt;ref name=reckless-280/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"As usual, the ratings agencies were chronically behind on developments in the financial markets and they could barely keep up with the new instruments springing from the brains of Wall Street's rocket scientists. Fitch, Moody's, and S&amp;P paid their analysts far less than the big brokerage firms did and, not surprisingly wound up employing people who were often looking to befriend, accommodate, and impress the Wall Street clients in hopes of getting hired by them for a multiple increase in pay. ... Their [the rating agencies] failure to recognize that mortgage underwriting standards had decayed or to account for the possibility that real estate prices could decline completely undermined the ratings agencies' models and undercut their ability to estimate losses that these securities might generate."&lt;ref&gt;Morgenson and Rosner, ''Reckless Endangerment'', 2010 p.280-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Michael Lewis also pronounced the transformation of BBB tranches into 80% triple A CDOs as "dishonest", "artificial" and the result of "fat fees" paid to rating agencies by Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms.&lt;ref name=big&gt;{{cite book

Synthetic CDOs were criticized in particular, because of the difficulties to judge (and price) the risk inherent in that kind of securities correctly. That adverse effect roots in the pooling and tranching activities on every level of the derivation.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt;

Others pointed out the risk of undoing the connection between borrowers and lenders—removing the lender's incentive to only pick borrowers who were creditworthy—inherent in all securitization.&lt;ref&gt;''All the Devils Are Here'', MacLean and Nocera, p.19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mortgage lending using securitization is sometimes referred to as the ''originate-to-distribute'' approach, in contrast to the traditional ''originate-to-hold'' approach. (''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', 2011, p.89)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koehler|first1=Christian|title=The Relationship between the Complexity of Financial Derivatives and Systemic Risk|journal=Working Paper|pages=42|ssrn=2511541}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to economist [[Mark Zandi]]: "As shaky mortgages were combined, diluting any problems into a larger pool, the [[moral hazard|incentive for responsibility]] was undermined."&lt;ref name="Zandi 2009"/&gt;

Zandi and others also criticized lack of regulation. "Finance companies weren't subject to the same regulatory oversight as banks. Taxpayers weren't on the hook if they went belly up [pre-crisis], only their shareholders and other creditors were. Finance companies thus had little to discourage them from growing as aggressively as possible, even if that meant lowering or winking at traditional lending standards."&lt;ref name="Zandi 2009"/&gt;

==Concept, structures, varieties==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2013}}

===Concept===
CDOs vary in structure and underlying assets, but the basic principle is the same. A CDO is a type of [[asset-backed security]]. To create a CDO, a [[corporation|corporate entity]] is constructed to hold assets as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] backing packages of [[cash flow]]s which are sold to investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koehler|first1=Christian|title=The Relationship between the Complexity of Financial Derivatives and Systemic Risk|journal=Working Paper|pages=12–13|ssrn=2511541}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sequence in constructing a CDO is:
* A [[special purpose entity]] (SPE) is designed/constructed to acquire a [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] of underlying assets. Common underlying [[assets]] held may include [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]], commercial real estate bonds and corporate loans.
* The SPE issues [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] to investors in exchange for cash, which are used to purchase the portfolio of underlying assets. Like other ABS private label securities, the bonds are not uniform but issued in layers called tranches, each with different risk characteristics. Senior tranches are paid from the cash flows from the underlying assets before the junior tranches and equity tranches. Losses are first borne by the equity tranches, next by the junior tranches, and finally by the senior tranches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koehler|first1=Christian|title=The Relationship between the Complexity of Financial Derivatives and Systemic Risk|journal=Working Paper|pages=13|ssrn=2511541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common analogy compares the cash flow from the CDO's portfolio of securities (say mortgage payments from mortgage-backed bonds) to water flowing into cups of the investors where senior tranches were filled first and overflowing cash flowed to junior tranches, then equity tranches. If a large portion of the mortgages enter default, there is insufficient cash flow to fill all these cups and equity tranche investors face the losses first.

The risk and return for a CDO investor depends both on how the tranches are defined, and on the underlying assets. In particular, the investment depends on the assumptions and methods used to define the risk and return of the tranches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koehler|first1=Christian|title=The Relationship between the Complexity of Financial Derivatives and Systemic Risk|journal=Working Paper|pages=19|ssrn=2511541}}&lt;/ref&gt; CDOs, like all [[Asset-backed security|asset-backed securities]], enable the originators of the underlying assets to pass credit risk to another institution or to individual investors. Thus investors must understand how the risk for CDOs is calculated.

The issuer of the CDO, typically an investment bank, earns a commission at the time of issue and earns management fees during the life of the CDO. The ability to earn substantial fees from originating CDOs, coupled with the absence of any residual liability, skews the incentives of originators in favor of loan volume rather than loan quality.

In some cases, the assets held by one CDO consisted entirely of equity layer tranches issued by other CDOs. This explains why some CDOs became entirely worthless, as the equity layer tranches were paid last in the sequence and there wasn't sufficient cash flow from the underlying subprime mortgages (many of which defaulted) to trickle down to the equity layers.

Ultimately the challenge is in accurately quantifying the risk and return characteristics of these constructs. Since the introduction of David Li's 2001 model, there have been material advances in techniques that more accurately model dynamics for these complex securities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levy|first=Amnon|last2=Yahalom|first2=Tomer|last3=Kaplin|first3=Andrew|date=2010|title=Modeling Correlation of Structured Instruments in a Portfolio Setting|url=|journal=Encyclopedia of Quantitative Finance, John Wiley &amp; Sons|volume=|pages=1220-1226|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structures===
CDO refers to several different types of products. The primary classifications are as follows:

;Source of funds—cash flow vs. market value
* ''Cash flow CDOs'' pay interest and principal to tranche holders using the cash flows produced by the CDO's assets. Cash flow CDOs focus primarily on managing the credit quality of the underlying portfolio.
* ''Market value CDOs'' attempt to enhance investor returns through the more frequent trading and profitable sale of collateral assets. The CDO asset manager seeks to realize capital gains on the assets in the CDO's portfolio. There is greater focus on the changes in market value of the CDO's assets. Market value CDOs are longer-established, but less common than cash flow CDOs.

;Motivation—arbitrage vs. balance sheet
* ''Arbitrage transactions'' (cash flow and market value) attempt to capture for equity investors the spread between the relatively high yielding assets and the lower yielding liabilities represented by the rated bonds. The majority, 86%, of CDOs are arbitrage-motivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives1.sifma.org/assets/files/SIFMA_CDOIssuanceData2007q1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928072530/http://archives1.sifma.org/assets/files/SIFMA_CDOIssuanceData2007q1.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Balance sheet transactions'', by contrast, are primarily motivated by the issuing institutions' desire to remove loans and other assets from their balance sheets, to reduce their regulatory [[capital requirements]] and improve their return on risk capital. A bank may wish to offload the credit risk to reduce its balance sheet's credit risk.

;Funding—cash vs. synthetic
* ''Cash CDOs'' involve a portfolio of cash assets, such as loans, [[corporate bond]]s, [[asset-backed security|asset-backed securities]] or [[mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]]. Ownership of the assets is transferred to the legal entity (known as a special purpose vehicle) issuing the CDO's tranches. The risk of loss on the assets is divided among tranches in reverse order of seniority. Cash CDO issuance exceeded $400 billion in 2006.
* ''Synthetic CDOs'' do not own cash assets like bonds or loans. Instead, [[synthetic CDO]]s gain credit exposure to a portfolio of fixed income assets without owning those assets through the use of [[credit default swap]]s, a derivatives instrument. (Under such a swap, the credit protection seller, the CDO, receives periodic cash payments, called premiums, in exchange for agreeing to assume the risk of loss on a specific asset in the event that asset experiences a default or other [[credit event]].) Like a cash CDO, the risk of loss on the CDO's portfolio is divided into tranches. Losses will first affect the equity tranche, next the junior tranches, and finally the senior tranche. Each tranche receives a periodic payment (the swap premium), with the junior tranches offering higher premiums.
** A synthetic CDO tranche may be either funded or unfunded. Under the swap agreements, the CDO could have to pay up to a certain amount of money in the event of a credit event on the reference obligations in the CDO's reference portfolio. Some of this credit exposure is funded at the time of investment by the investors in funded tranches. Typically, the junior tranches that face the greatest risk of experiencing a loss have to fund at closing. Until a credit event occurs, the proceeds provided by the funded tranches are often invested in high-quality, liquid assets or placed in a GIC ([[Guaranteed Investment Contract]]) account that offers a return that is a few basis points below [[LIBOR]]. The return from these investments plus the premium from the swap counterparty provide the cash flow stream to pay interest to the funded tranches. When a credit event occurs and a payout to the swap counterparty is required, the required payment is made from the GIC or reserve account that holds the liquid investments. In contrast, senior tranches are usually unfunded as the risk of loss is much lower. Unlike a cash CDO, investors in a senior tranche receive periodic payments but do not place any capital in the CDO when entering into the investment. Instead, the investors retain continuing funding exposure and may have to make a payment to the CDO in the event the portfolio's losses reach the senior tranche. Funded synthetic issuance exceeded $80 billion in 2006. From an issuance perspective, synthetic CDOs take less time to create. Cash assets do not have to be purchased and managed, and the CDO's tranches can be precisely structured.
* ''Hybrid CDOs'' have a portfolio including both cash assets—like cash CDOs—and swaps that give the CDO credit exposure to additional assets—like a synthetic CDO. A portion of the proceeds from the funded tranches is invested in cash assets and the remainder is held in reserve to cover payments that may be required under the credit default swaps. The CDO receives payments from three sources: the return from the cash assets, the GIC or reserve account investments, and the CDO premiums.

;Single-tranche CDOs
:The flexibility of credit default swaps is used to construct Single Tranche CDOs (bespoke tranche CDOs) where the entire CDO is structured specifically for a single or small group of investors, and the remaining tranches are never sold but held by the dealer based on valuations from internal models. Residual risk is [[Delta neutral#Creating the position|delta-hedged]] by the dealer.

;Structured Operating Companies
:Unlike CDOs, which are terminating structures that typically wind-down or refinance at the end of their financing term, Structured Operating Companies are permanently capitalized variants of CDOs, with an active management team and infrastructure. They often issue term notes, [[commercial paper]], and/or [[auction rate security|auction rate securities]], depending upon the structural and portfolio characteristics of the company. [[Credit Derivative Products Company|Credit Derivative Products Companies]] (CDPC) and [[Structured investment vehicle|Structured Investment Vehicles]] (SIV) are examples, with CDPC taking risk synthetically and SIV with predominantly 'cash' exposure.

===Taxation===
The issuer of a CDO—usually a special purpose entity—is typically a corporation established outside the United States to avoid being subject to U.S. federal income taxation on its global income. These corporations must restrict their activities to avoid U.S. tax liabilities; corporations that are deemed to engage in trade or business in the U.S. will be subject to federal taxation.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps;"&gt;Peaslee, James M. &amp; David Z. Nirenberg. ''Federal Income Taxation of Securitization Transactions and Related Topics''.&lt;/span&gt; Frank J. Fabozzi Associates (2011, with periodic supplements, www.securitizationtax.com): 1018.&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign corporations that only invest in and hold portfolios of U.S. stock and debt securities are not. Investing, unlike trading or dealing, is not considered to be a trade or business, regardless of its volume or frequency.&lt;ref&gt;Peaslee &amp; Nirenberg. ''Federal Income Taxation of Securitization Transactions'', 1023.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a safe harbor protects CDO issuers that do trade actively in securities, even though trading in securities technically is a business, provided the issuer's activities do not cause it to be viewed as a dealer in securities or engaged in a banking, lending or similar businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Peaslee &amp; Nirenberg. ''Federal Income Taxation of Securitization Transactions'', 1026.&lt;/ref&gt;

CDOs are generally taxable as debt instruments except for the most junior class of CDOs which are treated as equity and are subject to special rules (such as PFIC and CFC reporting). The PFIC and CFC reporting is very complex and requires a specialized accountant to perform these calculations and manage the tax reporting obligations.

===Types===
'''A) Based on the underlying asset:'''
* [[Collateralized loan obligation]]s (CLOs): CDOs backed primarily by leveraged bank loans.
* [[Collateralized bond obligation]]s (CBOs): CDOs backed primarily by leveraged [[fixed income]] securities.
* Collateralized synthetic obligations (CSOs): CDOs backed primarily by [[credit derivative]]s.
* Structured finance CDOs (SFCDOs): CDOs backed primarily by structured products (such as [[Asset-backed security|asset-backed securities]] and mortgage-backed securities).&lt;ref name="marketplace1"&gt;{{cite video

'''B) Other types of CDOs by assets/collateral include:'''
* Commercial Real Estate CDOs (CRE CDOs): backed primarily by commercial real estate assets
* [[Collateralized Bond Obligation|Collateralized bond obligations]] (CBOs): CDOs backed primarily by corporate bonds
* Collateralized Insurance Obligations (CIOs): backed by insurance or, more usually, reinsurance contracts
* [[CDO-Squared]]: CDOs backed primarily by the tranches issued by other CDOs.&lt;ref name="marketplace1"/&gt;
* [[CDO^n]]: Generic term for CDO&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ([[CDO cubed]]) and higher, where the CDO is backed by other CDOs/CDO&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/CDO&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. These are particularly difficult vehicles to model because of the possible repetition of exposures in the underlying CDO.

===Types of collateral===
The collateral for cash CDOs include:
* [[Structured finance]] securities ([[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]], home equity [[Asset-backed security|asset-backed securities]], [[Commercial mortgage-backed security|commercial mortgage-backed securities]])
* [[Leverage (finance)|Leveraged loans]]
* [[Corporate bond]]s
* [[Real estate investment trust]] (REIT) debt
* Commercial real estate mortgage debt (including whole loans, B notes, and Mezzanine debt)
* [[Emerging market debt|Emerging-market sovereign debt]]
* Project finance debt
* Trust Preferred securities

===Transaction participants===
Participants in a CDO transaction include investors, the underwriter, the asset manager, the trustee and collateral administrator, accountants and attorneys. Beginning in 1999, the [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]] allowed banks to also participate.

====Investors====
Investors—buyers of CDO—include [[insurance company|insurance companies]], [[mutual fund]] companies, [[unit trust]]s, [[investment trust]]s, [[commercial bank]]s, [[investment bank]]s, [[pension fund]] managers, [[private banking]] organizations, other CDOs and [[structured investment vehicle]]s. Investors have different motivations for purchasing CDO securities depending on which tranche they select. At the more senior levels of debt, investors are able to obtain better yields than those that are available on more traditional securities (e.g., corporate bonds) of a similar rating. In some cases, investors utilize leverage and hope to profit from the excess of the spread offered by the senior tranche and their cost of borrowing. This is true because senior tranches pay a spread above LIBOR despite their AAA-ratings. Investors also benefit from the diversification of the CDO portfolio, the expertise of the asset manager, and the credit support built into the transaction. Investors include banks and insurance companies as well as investment funds.

Junior tranche investors achieve a leveraged, non-recourse investment in the underlying diversified collateral portfolio. Mezzanine notes and equity notes offer yields that are not available in most other fixed income securities. Investors include hedge funds, banks, and wealthy individuals.

====Underwriter====
The [[underwriting|underwriter]] of a CDO is typically an [[investment bank]], and acts as the structurer and arranger. Working with the asset management firm that selects the CDO's portfolio, the underwriter structures debt and equity tranches. This includes selecting the debt-to-equity ratio, sizing each tranche, establishing coverage and collateral quality tests, and working with the credit rating agencies to gain the desired ratings for each debt tranche.

The key economic consideration for an underwriter that is considering bringing a new deal to market is whether the transaction can offer a sufficient return to the equity noteholders. Such a determination requires estimating the after-default return offered by the portfolio of debt securities and comparing it to the cost of funding the CDO's rated notes. The excess spread must be large enough to offer the potential of attractive IRRs to the equityholders.

Other underwriter responsibilities include working with a law firm and creating the special purpose legal vehicle (typically a trust incorporated in the [[Cayman Islands]]) that will purchase the assets and issue the CDO's tranches. In addition, the underwriter will work with the asset manager to determine the post-closing trading restrictions that will be included in the CDO's transaction documents and other files.

The final step is to price the CDO (i.e., set the coupons for each debt tranche) and place the tranches with investors. The priority in placement is finding investors for the risky equity tranche and junior debt tranches (A, BBB, etc.) of the CDO. It is common for the asset manager to retain a piece of the equity tranche. In addition, the underwriter was generally expected to provide some type of secondary market liquidity for the CDO, especially its more senior tranches.

According to [[Thomson Financial]], the top underwriters before September 2008 were [[Bear Stearns]], [[Merrill Lynch]], [[Wachovia]], [[Citigroup]], [[Deutsche Bank]], and [[Bank of America|Bank of America Securities]].&lt;ref name=dealbook&gt;{{cite web|last=Dealbook|title=Citi and Merrill Top Underwriting League Tables|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2008/01/02/citi-and-merrill-top-underwriting-league-tables/|work=January 2, 2008,|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; CDOs are more profitable for underwriters than conventional bond underwriting because of the complexity involved. The underwriter is paid a fee when the CDO is issued.

====The asset manager====
The asset manager plays a key role in each CDO transaction, even after the CDO is issued. An experienced manager is critical in both the construction and maintenance of the CDO's portfolio. The manager can maintain the credit quality of a CDO's portfolio through trades as well as maximize recovery rates when defaults on the underlying assets occur.

In theory, the asset manager should add value in the manner outlined below, although in practice, this did not occur during the credit bubble of the mid-2000s (decade). In addition, it is now understood that the structural flaw in all asset-backed securities (originators profit from loan volume not loan quality) make the roles of subsequent participants peripheral to the quality of the investment.

The asset manager's role begins in the months before a CDO is issued, a bank usually provides financing to the manager to purchase some of the collateral assets for the forthcoming CDO. This process is called warehousing.

Even by the issuance date, the asset manager often will not have completed the construction of the CDO's portfolio. A "ramp-up" period following issuance during which the remaining assets are purchased can extend for several months after the CDO is issued. For this reason, some senior CDO notes are structured as delayed drawdown notes, allowing the asset manager to draw down cash from investors as collateral purchases are made. When a transaction is fully ramped, its initial portfolio of credits has been selected by the asset manager.

However, the asset manager's role continues even after the ramp-up period ends, albeit in a less active role. During the CDO's "reinvestment period", which usually extends several years past the issuance date of the CDO, the asset manager is authorized to reinvest principal proceeds by purchasing additional debt securities. Within the confines of the trading restrictions specified in the CDO's transaction documents, the asset manager can also make trades to maintain the credit quality of the CDO's portfolio. The manager also has a role in the redemption of a CDO's notes by auction call.

There are approximately 300 asset managers in the marketplace. CDO Asset Managers, as with other Asset Managers, can be more or less active depending on the personality and prospectus of the CDO. Asset Managers make money by virtue of the senior fee (which is paid before any of the CDO investors are paid) and subordinated fee as well as any equity investment the manager has in the CDO, making CDOs a lucrative business for asset managers. These fees, together with underwriting fees, administration—approx 1.5 - 2% -- by virtue of capital structure are provided by the equity investment, by virtue of reduced cashflow.

====The trustee and collateral administrator====
The trustee holds title to the assets of the CDO for the benefit of the "noteholders" (i.e., the investors). In the CDO market, the trustee also typically serves as collateral administrator. In this role, the collateral administrator produces and distributes noteholder reports, performs various compliance tests regarding the composition and liquidity of the asset portfolios in addition to constructing and executing the priority of payment waterfall models.&lt;ref&gt;Two notable exceptions to this are Virtus Partners and Wilmington Trust Conduit Services, a subsidiary of [[Wilmington Trust]], which offer collateral administration services, but are not trustee banks.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the asset manager, there are relatively few trustees in the marketplace. The following institutions offer trustee services in the CDO marketplace:
* [[Bank of New York Mellon]] (note: the Bank of New York Mellon acquired the corporate trust unit of [[JP Morgan]]),
* [[BNP Paribas]] Securities Services (note: currently serves the European market only)
* [[Citibank]]
* [[Deutsche Bank]]
* [[Equity Trust]]
* [[Intertrust Group]] (note: until mid-2009 was known as Fortis Intertrust; Acquired ATC Capital Markets in 2013)
* [[HSBC]]
* [[Sanne Trust]]
* [[State Street Corporation]]
* [[US Bank]] (note: US Bank acquired the corporate trust unit of [[Wachovia]] in 2008 and Bank of America in September 2011, which had previously acquired LaSalle Bank in 2010, and is the current market share leader)
* [[Wells Fargo]]
* [[Wilmington Trust]]: Wilmington shut down their business in early 2009.

====Accountants====
The underwriter typically will hire an accounting firm to perform due diligence on the CDO's portfolio of debt securities. This entails verifying certain attributes, such as credit rating and coupon/spread, of each collateral security. Source documents or public sources will typically be used to tie-out the collateral pool information. In addition, the accountants typically calculate certain collateral tests and determine whether the portfolio is in compliance with such tests.

The firm may also perform a cash flow tie-out in which the transaction's waterfall is modeled per the priority of payments set forth in the transaction documents. The yield and weighted average life of the bonds or equity notes being issued is then calculated based on the modeling assumptions provided by the underwriter. On each payment date, an accounting firm may work with the trustee to verify the distributions that are scheduled to be made to the noteholders.

====Attorneys====
Attorneys ensure compliance with applicable securities law and negotiate and draft the transaction documents. Attorneys will also draft an offering document or prospectus the purpose of which is to satisfy statutory requirements to disclose certain information to investors. This will be circulated to investors. It is common for multiple counsels to be involved in a single deal because of the number of parties to a single CDO from asset management firms to underwriters.

==In popular media==
In the 2015 biographical film [[The Big Short (film)|''The Big Short'']], CDOs are described metaphorically as "dog shit wrapped in cat shit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Adam McKay (Director) |date=November 12, 2015 |title=The Big Short |medium=Motion picture |minutes=33 |location=United States |publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]] (distributor) |quote="So mortgage bonds are dog shit.

==Early history==
The Constituent Assembly that founded Bolivia in 1825 wrote the nation's first constitution establishing a centralized government with executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Based on the United States Constitution and borrowing a few premises from the French Republic, the first charter adopted liberal and representative democracy granting the congress autonomy and policy-making prerogatives. This constitution, however, was never adopted.&lt;ref name=cs&gt;{{Country study

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 26, 1826, the Bolivarian constitution, written in Lima by the liberator Simón Bolívar Palacio, replaced the original document and instituted a fourfold separation of powers among a lifetime presidency, an independent judiciary, a tricameral congress, and an electoral body. The tricameral congress comprised the Senate and the Chamber of Tribunes, whose members had fixed terms, as well as a Chamber of Censors, whose members served for life. Theoretically, the Senate was responsible for codifying laws and reorienting church and court officials, the Chamber of Tribunes possessed general legislative powers, and the Chamber of Censors had oversight powers that included impeachment of members of the executive. In reality, the legislature's key functions were to name the president and to approve a list of successors submitted by the president. One of the long-lasting effects of the Bolivarian constitution was the establishment of an executive-based system. The Bolivarian constitution reflected the Spanish tradition of bureaucratic patrimonialism in which power rested in the executive branch.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

In many ways, the Bolivarian constitution reflected Bolívar's desire to prevent rule by the masses. As a result, the franchise was extended only to those literate in Spanish who either possessed property then worth 400 bolivianos or engaged in an art, in a science, or in some other remunerative position. Domestic and personal servants were also denied the franchise. In short, voting rights were limited to a very small and privileged elite. Voting qualifications and restrictions remained until [[universal suffrage]] was adopted during the 1952 Revolution. Bolívar also feared that rival elite factions would wage battle against each other for control over the new nation and became convinced that the best way to prevent instability and chaos was to institutionalize a strong, centralized, and lifetime presidency.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

However, the Bolivarian constitution did not last long because of the great disparity that existed between the national aspirations of the state and its effective power over Bolivia's disparate regions and population. Between 1825 and 1880, Bolivian political life was dominated by a series of quasi-military leaders, known as caudillos, who had emerged with the collapse of the Spanish Empire. Within the context of economic crisis, warring caudillos, and a semifeudal social structure, constitutions and the national government became prizes to be captured by one or another caudillo.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

Under the presidency of General [[Andrés de Santa Cruz y Calahumana]], a new constitution was adopted on August 31, 1831. The new constitution introduced bicameralism, dividing the body between the Chamber of Senators (Senate) and the Chamber of Deputies elected by proportional representation. Annual sessions for the National Congress (hereafter, Congress) were to run between sixty and ninety days. Although the president was given the power to dissolve congress, the new constitution abolished the lifetime presidency and limited the president to renewable four-year terms. Despite these limitations, however, presidential power actually increased during the presidency of Santa Cruz, and the trend toward greater concentration of power in the executive continued throughout Bolivia's history.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

Under the short-lived [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]] of 1836-39, Santa Cruz promulgated a new constitution that basically applied the principles of the 1831 charter to the alliance. The end of the confederation motivated Santa Cruz to institutionalize the strong executive model embodied in the 1831 charter. Because the president was given the power to dissolve the legislature, Congress was condemned to a passive and submissive role.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

For the next forty-two years, Bolivia was subjected to the whims of caudillos who dictated constitutional charters almost as regularly as changes of government occurred. Between 1839 and 1880, six constitutions were approved by the legislative power. Except for the constitution of 1839, which limited presidential power, the constitutions promulgated under José Ballivián y Segurola (1843), Manuel Isidoro Belzú Humérez (1851), José María Achá Valiente (1861), Mariano Melgarejo Valencia (1868), and Agustín Morales Hernández (1871) further concentrated power in the hands of the executive. As a rule, during this era Congress responded to the demands of whatever caudillo was in power.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

==1880 Constitution==
Caudillo politics came to an end after the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–80), in which the combined forces of Bolivia and Peru suffered a humiliating defeat against Chile's armed forces. The end of the war gave rise to a new mining elite oriented to laissez-faire capitalism. Aided by the failure of Bolivia's armed forces in the war effort, this new elite was able to design a new civilian regime of "order and progress."&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

In 1880 Bolivia's most durable constitution was approved; it was to remain in effect for the next fifty-eight years. Under this constitution, bicameralism was fully adopted, and the legislative power became an important arena for political debate. During this period, Bolivia achieved a functioning constitutional order complete with political parties, interest groups, and an active legislature. The country was also a prime example of a formal democracy with legally limited participation. Literacy and property requirements were still enforced to exclude the Indian population and the urban working class from politics. Political life was reserved for the privileged and a minuscule upper class.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

The basic premises of representative democracy introduced in 1880 still prevailed in 1989. Specifically, congressional oversight prerogatives over executive behavior were introduced by law in 1884 when Bolivia emerged from the War of the Pacific. The Law Governing Trials of Responsibilities was to become an integral part of Bolivia's restricted democracy.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

==Chaco War to 1952 Revolution==
The economic crisis of the 1930s and the disastrous Chaco War (1932–35) exacerbated social tensions. The effects of the war would in turn have a dramatic effect on Bolivian political life and its institutions. Between 1935 and 1952, middle-class reformist efforts converged into populist movements led by both military officers and middle-class civilian intellectuals. Under Colonel Germán Busch Becerra (1937–39), a constituent assembly approved reforms in 1938 that were to have a lasting and profound impact on Bolivian society. Of greatest significance were changes that altered the pattern of relations between state and society. According to its provisions, human rights outweighed property rights, the national interest in the subsoil and its riches predominated, the state had a right to intervene in economic life and to regulate commerce, workers could organize and bargain collectively, and educational facilities for all children were mandated. The labor provision helped establish the basis for political parties by allowing the formation of miners' and peasants' unions that eventually played central roles in the 1952 Revolution.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

Bolivia's constitution was again reformed in 1944 during the presidency of Colonel [[Gualberto Villarroel López]] (1943–46), another populist reformer. The principal changes included suffrage rights for women, but only in municipal elections, and the establishment of presidential and vice presidential terms of six years without immediate reelection. Reforms undertaken by military-populist governments, however, were partially rolled back following the overthrow and assassination of Villarroel in 1946. In 1947 a new constitution reduced the presidential term to four years and increased the powers of the Senate.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

The post-Chaco War reformist efforts increased the role of the state, especially in terms of redressing social and economic grievances. The constitutions of this period reflected the rise of movements and groups that were to dominate Bolivian politics for the next forty years. For example, the [[Nationalist Revolutionary Movement]](Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario—MNR) espoused a broad multiclass alliance of workers, peasants, and middle-class elements to do battle with the antinational forces of the mining oligarchy and its foreign allies. It went on to conduct the 1952 Revolution, and in 1988 the MNR was back in power with Paz Estenssoro, its founder and leader, as president. Although the 1952 Revolution fundamentally transformed Bolivian society, a new political order was never fully implemented. Between 1952 and 1956, factions of the MNR debated alternative and novel modes of political organization, including proposals to implement a worker's assembly. By 1956, however, the 1947 constitution had been ratified. Apart from a powerful labor movement, organized as the Bolivian Labor Federation (Central Obrera Boliviana—COB), the MNR failed to create new institutions capable of channeling and controlling the demands of the groups mobilized by the 1952 Revolution.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

The 1961 constitution institutionalized the gains of the 1952 Revolution by adopting universal suffrage, the nationalization of the mines, and agrarian reform. Factional disputes within the MNR, rooted in demands for access to state employment, undermined the party's capacity to carry out further reforms. In fact, the 1961 constitution served mainly the interests of Paz Estenssoro's faction of the MNR by providing for his reelection in 1964.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

==1960s constitutions==
The overthrow of the MNR by General René Barrientos Ortuño (president, 1964–65; copresident, May 1965-January 1966; and president, 1966–69) in 1964 initiated the contemporary era in Bolivian constitutional development. After calling elections in 1966 and invoking the 1947 constitution, Barrientos attempted to force through Congress a new corporatist charter. Because he sought democratic legitimacy, however, he was forced to give up his original project in favor of a constitution rooted firmly in the liberal democratic tradition that had inspired the authors of the 1880 charter.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

Under the terms of the Constitution of 1967, Bolivia was a unitary republic that retains a democratic and representative democracy. Article 2 stipulated that sovereignty resides in the people, that it is inalienable, and that its exercise is delegated to the legislative, executive, and judicial powers. The functions of the public power—executive, legislative, and judicial—could not be united in a single branch of government. Although the Constitution of 1967 recognized Roman Catholicism as the official state religion, it also guaranteed to all faiths the right to worship publicly. In theory, the people governed through their representatives and through other authorities established by law. The Constitution of 1967 became known to most Bolivians only in the 1980s because, for all practical purposes, it was in effect only until 1969 when a coup by General Alfredo Ovando Candia (copresident, May 1965-January 1966, and president, January-August 1966 and 1969–70) overthrew the civilian regime. Between then and 1979, the Constitution of 1967 was given only lip service by the military rulers who governed Bolivia.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

==Decentralization and 21st century constitutional reform==
{{main|Constitution of Bolivia}}
{{Expand section|date=July 2011}}

Bolivia's most recent Constitution was drafted by the [[Bolivian Constituent Assembly of 2006–2007|Constituent Assembly]], an elected body that met in [[Sucre]] and [[Oruro, Bolivia|Oruro]] from 6 August 2006 to 9 December 2007. The constitution was further modified by an Editing Commission before being present to Congress on 14 December 2007; by the Cochabamba Dialogue between the President and opposition Prefects in September 2008; and in Congress during negotiations for a referendum in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Le Monde Diplomatique, edicion boliviana | editors = Maristella Svampa, Pablo Stefanoni, Bruno Fornillo (eds.) | last = Prada Alcoreza | first = Raúl | title = Balance y perspectivas: Intelectuales en el primer gobierno de Evo Morales | chapter = Raúl Prada: A la interior de la Asamblea Constituyente | location = La Paz | year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The referendum was held on January 25, 2009, and the constitution was approved by 61.43% of voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cne.org.bo/ResultadosRNC2009/ |title=Referéndum Nacional Constituyente 2009 |accessdate=2009-02-09 |author=[[Corte Nacional Electoral]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203110442/http://www.cne.org.bo/ResultadosRNC2009/ |archivedate=2009-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 Constitution defines Bolivia as a [[unitary state|unitary]] plurinational, and secular (rather than a Catholic, as before) state, formally known as the Plurinational State of Bolivia. It calls for a mixed economy of state, private, and communal ownership; restricts private land ownership to a maximum of 5,000 [[hectare]]s (12,400 [[acre]]s); recognizes a variety of [[autonomy|autonomies]] at the local and departmental level. It elevates the electoral authorities, to become a fourth constitutional power; introduces the possibility of [[recall election]]s for all elected officials; and enlarges the Senate. Members of the enlarged National Congress will be elected by [[Plurality voting system|first past the post voting]] in the future,{{dubious|date=December 2010}} in a change from the previous [[Mixed member proportional representation|mixed member proportional system]]. The judiciary is reformed, and judges will be elected in the future and no longer appointed by the National Congress. It declares natural resources to be the exclusive dominion of the Bolivian people, administered by the state. [[Sucre]] will be acknowledged as Bolivia's capital, but the institutions will remain where they are (executive and legislative in [[La Paz]], judiciary in Sucre). The electoral authorities will be situated in Sucre.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23730">'''Content delivery network interconnection''' (CDNI) is a set of interfaces and mechanisms required for interconnecting two independent [[content delivery network]]s (CDNs) that enables one to deliver content on behalf of the other. Interconnected CDNs offer many benefits, such as [[#Footprint extension|footprint extension]], reduced infrastructure costs, higher availability, etc., for content service providers (CSPs), CDNs, and end users. Among its many use cases, it allows small CDNs to interconnect and provides services for CSPs that allows them to compete against the CDNs of global CSPs.

== Rationale ==

Thanks to the many benefits of CDNs, e.g. reduced delivery cost, improved quality of experience (QoE), and increased robustness of delivery, CDNs have become popular for large-scale content delivery of cacheable content. For this reason, CDN providers are scaling up their infrastructure and many Internet service providers (ISPs)/network service providers (NSPs) have deployed or are deploying their own CDNs for their own use or for lease, if a business and technical arrangement between them and a CDN provider were made. Those stand-alone CDNs with well-defined request routing, delivery, acquisition, accounting systems and protocols may sooner or later face either footprint, resource or capability limits. The CDNI targets at leveraging separate CDNs to provide end-to-end delivery of content from CSPs to end users, regardless of their location or attachment network.

== Example of operation ==
Let’s consider an interconnection of two CDNs as presented in the below figure. The ISP-A deploys an authoritative upstream CDN (uCDN), and he has established a technical and business arrangement with the CSP. Because the CDN-A is authorised to serve on behalf of the CSP, a user in the network of ISP-B requests content from CDN-A (1). The uCDN can either serve the request itself or redirect it to a downstream CDN (dCDN) if, for example, dCDN is closer to the user equipment (UE). If the request is redirected, the interconnected CDNs must provide the requested content to the dCDN. If the content is not available in the uCDN, it can be acquired first from CSP (2) and then submitted to a surrogate in the dCDN (3). The UE following the redirection will request the content from the dCDN (4), and finally, the requested content will be distributed from the surrogate.

[[image:cdni usage example.png|thumb|none|600px|alt=An example of end-to-end content delivery using CDNI.|An example of end-to-end content delivery using CDNI.]]

In this example, all four parties can benefit from the interconnection: the end users can benefit from better quality of service (QoS); the CSP benefits because it has to make only one business and technical arrangement with uCDN; the uCDN benefits because it does not have to deploy such an extensive CDN; and the dCDN will receive some compensation for the delivery. The procedures and algorithms responsible for choosing the right dCDN, choosing a surrogate and the procedure for acquiring the content to be submitted to the surrogate can differ, but the dCDN serves the content on behalf of the uCDN.

== Use cases ==

Below is an incomplete list of use cases for which CDNI was presented.&lt;ref name=rfc6770&gt;G. Bertrand, E. Stephan, T. Burbridge, P. Eardley, K. Ma, and G. Watson. Use Cases for Content Delivery Network Interconnection. RFC 6770 (Informational), November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The use cases seem to be convergent among the standardisation approaches (see [[#Standardisation status|Standardisation status]] section).

=== Footprint extension ===

Footprint is defined as a region for which a CDN is able to deliver content. With a deployed CDNI, non-global CDN providers may offer CSPs an extended geographical footprint without

* compromising the quality of delivery;
* additional transit costs, if the content is to be served from geographically or topologically remote surrogates; and
* deploying and operating surrogates not justified in the corresponding region, e.g. high investments costs and low delivery volume.

An interconnection may be attractive to a large CDN provider who possesses many CDNs in various locations and who may want to make them interoperable.

A CDNI footprint extension is also beneficial for cases in which CDN providers deliver a lot of popular content to networks of a few ISPs. If so, interconnection of such CDNs would offer improved QoS and QoE to end users, reduce and allow control of ingress traffic in the ISP’s network, reduce hardware capacity and footprint of uCDN and allow the ISP to derive some revenue.

Additionally, interconnected networks may allow nomadic end users to access content with a consistent QoE across a range of devices and/or geographic regions.

=== Offload ===

A CDNI can be very useful in overload handling because it allows the unexpected spikes in traffic, e.g. a ﬂash crowd that exceeds the peaks for which a CDN was dimensioned, to be spread between the uCDN and the dCDN. If the CDNs share their resources, they may benefit from dimensioning savings. For such a mechanism to work properly, the uCDN requires information in real time from a dCDN on the amount of traﬃc it can oﬄoad. Whereas for planned events, such as maintenance or special event distribution, a static resource reservation can be sufficient.

Additionally, a CDNI provides means for resiliency against content delivery and acquisition failure. Deploying it, for cases in which the CSPs’ surrogates and origin servers are unavailable, allows delivery requests to be redirected towards another CDN. Similarly, with a deployed CDNI, if a default acquisition source fails, other sources within the interconnection, e.g. an alternate uCDN, can be used. This, in turn, provides load balancing between content acquisition sources.

=== Capability ===

A CDNI can be a means of extending a supported range of devices and network technologies if a CDN is not able to support them or if its provider is not willing to provide them. For example, a CDN provider may want to extend its portfolio of services to HTTP Adaptive streaming and/or IPv6 while supporting HTTP streaming and/or IPv4 only. This extension can be realized by interconnecting to a CDN that can provide the requested protocols. Similarly, an interconnection may enable a fixed-line CDN provider to extend its services to mobile devices.

When a CDN provider runs many networks in different technologies, has a multi-vendor strategy or deploys separate networks for many CSPs an interconnection can ease its establishing technology and vendor interoperability by simplification or automatisation of some inter-CDN operations.

Another use case would be an improvement of QoS and QoE for a CDN provider if an interconnection option with a network of surrogates closer to end users existed.

== Interfaces in CDNI ==

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) (see [[#Standardisation status|Standardisation status]] section) &lt;ref name=rfc6770 /&gt;&lt;ref name="draft-ietf-cdni-framework-06"&gt;L. Peterson and B. Davie. Framework for CDN Interconnection. draft-ietf-cdni-framework-06 (Active Internet-Draft), October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; defines five interfaces required to interconnect a pair of CDNs from a technical perspective, as depicted in Figure 2. The interfaces are control plane interfaces operating at the application layer that aim to reuse or leverage existing protocols, e.g. HTTP, rather than to define a new one. This model of the CDNI does not define content acquisition, delivery, request interfaces and mechanisms because today CDNs already use standardised protocols for them, e.g. HTTP, FTP, rsync, etc. are used for content acquisition. The interconnection allows a number of CDNs to be connected in various topologies, such as line, mesh or start topology. It is important to note that in order to deploy a CDNI, additional business arrangements have to be established between the CSP and the uCDN and between the uCDN and the dCDN. At the time of this writing detailed operations of interfaces and the structure of exchanged objects are under standardisation process.&lt;ref name="draft-ietf-cdni-framework-06"/&gt;&lt;ref name=rfc6707&gt;B.

He, Chen. Ge, and Wei. Ni. Request Routing Redirection Interface for CDN Interconnection. draft-ietf-cdni-redirection-01 (Active Internet-Draft), October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The defined interfaces are briefly described as follows.

[[image:cdni ietf model.png|thumb|none|400px|alt=A CDNI model as defined by the IETF.|A CDNI model as defined by the IETF.]]

=== Control interface (CI) ===

The CI is designed to initiate an interconnection across two CDNs and bootstrap the other CDNI interfaces. For example, the control interface can be used to provide the address of the logging server in order to bootstrap the logging interface, or it can be used to establish security associations for other interfaces. It can also allow an uCDN to preposition, revalidate or purge metadata and content on a dCDN.

=== Request routing redirection interface (RI) ===

Redirects and selects a delivery dCDN for a given user request. This interface provides loop prevention and detection mechanism for the served requests.

=== Footprint and capabilities advertisement interface (FCI) ===

Enables asynchronous exchange of routing information on capabilities and footprint to support dCDN selection for subsequent user requests. The union of the RI and FCI interfaces denotes the request interface.

=== Metadata interface (MI) ===

Allows a dCDN to provide content metadata from an uCDN. The metadata may include information on required authorization, geo-blocking, availability windows and delegation white- and blacklists. This information can, for example, limit the distribution to a given country or make content intended for adults available only in late-night hours. The collected metadata is used later for CDNI redirection and user content request responses.

=== Logging interface (LI) ===

Enables content distribution and delivery activity details to be exchanged via interconnection. Real-time exchange can be used for traﬃc monitoring and offline exchange can be used for billing of end user or billing between interconnected CDNs.

== Downstream CDN selection criteria ==

For selection of a dCDN, the information on its footprint and capabilities is mainly used. The footprint can be specified with the use of IP subnets, autonomous systems (AS) numbers or country, state and code combinations.&lt;ref name="draft-ietf-cdni-footprint-capabilities-semantics-01"&gt;J. Seedorf, J. Peterson, S. Previdi, R. van Brandenburg, and K. Ma. CDNI Request Routing: Footprint and Capabilities Semantics. draft-ietf-cdni-footprint-capabilities-semantics-01 (Active Internet-Draft), October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The capabilities describe features, services and states a CDN can or cannot meet and includes network and administrative capabilities, information about caches and the resources. The network information may disclose details on QoS or the supported streaming bandwidth. The administrative capabilities may inform on established limits and policies. The data about the caches may inform about the load and the available resources. The resource information may specify supported delivery technologies and content types, such as the ability to stream video to a particular device type.

Given the information on footprint and capabilities, the uCDN may proceed to the initial selection of a dCDN—first on the basis of footprint and then on the basis of capabilities. However, such procedures may lead to suboptimal or incorrect decisions; for example when the dCDN is selected on the basis of footprint, it cannot provide the requested delivery technology. Therefore, a more approved procedure involves making the footprint information part of the capabilities requirements.

Various protocols are considered for exchange of information on either footprint, such as BGP, on capabilities, such as HTTP, or on both footprint and capabilities, such as Application Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO).&lt;ref name="draft-stephan-cdni-alto-session-ext-04"&gt;E. Stephan and S. Ellouze. ALTO session for CDN Interconnection. draft-stephan-cdni-alto-session-ext-04 (Active Internet-Draft), October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Redirection of content request in CDN ==

For user request redirection, two mechanisms, among others, are used in CDNs: mainly HTTP and DNS redirection.

The HTTP method uses the HTTP redirection response, e.g. 302, containing a new URL to visit. Besides the option of changing the name of the server in the new URL, the URL can contain the name of the original server, which provides a means for an in-band communication. Moreover, the redirection mechanism can use the information on the IP address of a client, the requested content type or user agent for target surrogate selection. Unfortunately, change of a URL’s domain will cause web browsers to not send cookies.

The DNS redirection is completely transparent to the end user in comparison to the HTTP method. In the simple DNS redirection, the authoritative DNS server for the name returns an IP address based on the characteristic of a client. Which IP address is returned as a result depends, among other factors, on either the localisation of the end user or the surrogate server’s load. There is another DNS redirection method in which the authoritative server returns a CNAME response. This forces the peer to restart the name lookup using a new name. To preserve the freshness of the redirection in case of cached DNS responses, an appropriate value of the time-to-live parameter is set. A drawback of this method is that DNS caches hide the end user’s IP address.

Both redirection methods, HTTP and DNS based, can be performed in the CDNI, either iteratively or recursively. The recursive redirection is more transparent for the end user because it involves only one UE redirection, but it has other dependencies on the interconnection realisation. A single UE redirection may be preferable if the number of interconnected CDNs exceeds two.

== Exemplary operation of CDNI interfaces in content delivery ==

The sequence diagram presented in the figure below provides some details on CDNI and the iterative DNS redirection operation. In the depicted example, a UE downloads content from the address &lt;tt&gt;cdn.csp.com/foo&lt;/tt&gt;, which is primarily delivered by the CDN-A on behalf of a CSP with the address &lt;tt&gt;csp.com&lt;/tt&gt;.

[[image:cdni request redirection.png|thumb|none|400px|alt=An example of iterative DNS redirection of content request in CDNI.|An example of iterative DNS redirection of content request in CDNI.]]

# Before any request redirection, the CDN-B (dCDN) announces information on supported footprint and capabilities.
# The UE performs a DNS lookup for a server &lt;tt&gt;cdn.csp.com&lt;/tt&gt; in the domain of the CSP from which it is going to download the content.
# A request router in CDN-A (uCDN) servicing the domain &lt;tt&gt;cdn.csp.com&lt;/tt&gt; processes the request and recognises, based on the source IP address of the request, that the end user could be better served by the dCDN. Therefore, it performs an inquiry in dCDN to determine if it is willing and able to serve this request.
#  If the dCDN is able to handle the request, the request router in uCDN returns a DNS CNAME response. This response contains a new domain, e.g. &lt;tt&gt;b.cdn.csp.com&lt;/tt&gt;, indicating dCDN and the original domain and an NS record that maps this new domain to a request router in dCDN.
# The UE does a DNS lookup using the new domain (&lt;tt&gt;b.cdn.csp.com&lt;/tt&gt;). A request router in dCDN responds to this request with the IP address of a suitable delivery node.
# The UE requests the content &lt;tt&gt;/foo&lt;/tt&gt; from the delivery node in dCDN. At this point, the delivery node receives the real IP address of the UE and the information on the requested content. If the redirections in previous steps were incorrect, the delivery node could perform a HTTP redirection.
# If the metadata for content &lt;tt&gt;/foo&lt;/tt&gt; is not available in dCDN, the metadata interface is used to request it from the uCDN.
# If the request is going to be served, i.e. metadata restrictions were met and a cache miss occurs, the delivery node in dCDN must start the acquisition process. The delivery node does a DNS lookup for an internal domain address &lt;tt&gt;op-b-acq.op-a.net&lt;/tt&gt;. The uCDN recognises that the request is from a dCDN, rather than from a UE, and returns an IP address of a delivery node in the uCDN.
# The content &lt;tt&gt;/foo&lt;/tt&gt; is delivered to the delivery node in dCDN from the delivery node in uCDN.
# The content &lt;tt&gt;/foo&lt;/tt&gt; is delivered to the UE from the delivery node in dCDN.
# After some time, the uCDN may instruct the dCDN to purge the content &lt;tt&gt;/foo&lt;/tt&gt; to ensure that it is not delivered again.
# After the content is delivered a log of delivery actions is provided to the uCDN.

== HTTP adaptive streaming ==

If addressed in CDNI specifications, support of HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS) &lt;ref name=rfc6983&gt;R. van Brandenburg, O. van Deventer, F. Le Faucheur, and K. Leung. Models for HTTP-Adaptive-Streaming-Aware Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI). RFC 6983 (Informational), July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; is particularly realised. Large objects are broken into a sequence of small, independent chunks, e.g. videos, that are perceived as if there were no relationship between the chunks. As a result, content acquisition and chunk purging are performed on a per-chunk basis. In order to reduce the CDNI load, specifications either allow relative Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) or modify absolute URLs in the manifest file of a resource distributed via HAS.

== Security ==

The security of the CDNI is optional, and its support is introduced as a capability of a CDN. Security of the CDNI involves content confidentiality protection, authenticated peers communication and [[data origin authentication]]. The data origin authentication is of high importance if the trust of the link between CDN is questioned. The security is enforced by switching to secure versions of protocols deployed in the CDNI, e.g. HTTPS. Usually, if a CDNI is established via secure protocols, secure protocols are also used for content acquisition and distribution.

Further issues related to security could be various end user privacy requirements in relation to the exchanged logs across different countries or authenticity of logs for delivery charging across CDNs. What consequences a security breakage would have depends on the interface and its function; for example, a corruption of the control interface could corrupt other interfaces, while a corrupted logging interface could enable a fraud in charging.

== Standardisation status ==

A number of organisations and projects, i.e. IETF, European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS) and Open ContEnt Aware Networks (OCEAN), have been working or are working on the standardisation of CDNI interfaces and methods. There exist some mismatches and differences between the specifications in the defined interfaces as well as in terminology.

The ETSI specifications &lt;ref name=TS_102_990&gt;Media Content Distribution (MCD); CDN Interconnection, use cases and requirements. Technical report, ETSI, 2012. TS 102 990.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=TS_182_032&gt;CDN Interconnection Architecture. Technical report, ETSI, 2013. TS 182 032.&lt;/ref&gt; describe three CDNI interfaces. The first one, the interconnection control, seems to map on the union of ETSI’s control and logging interfaces. The next one, the request and content control, seems to map in turn on the union of ETSI’s request routing and metadata interfaces. The third one is the distribution of content interface.

The OCEAN framework exhaustively specifies the open interfaces and processes of the proposed CDNI.&lt;ref name=OCEAN_D3.1&gt;D3.1 OCEAN Functional Architecture and Open Interface Specification. Technical report, OCEAN, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OCEAN_D2.2&gt;Deliverable D2.2 Final requirements for Open Content Aware Networks. Technical report, OCEAN, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The documents define additional business, acquisition and inner metadata interfaces. Further, the metadata interface as defined by the ETSI is split into two more specialised interfaces that, together, result in the reference model with nine interfaces.

The paid ATIS standards and technical reports define specification of use cases and high-level requirements for a CDNI. According to the freely available abstracts these specifications cover, among other aspects, the interconnection of two CDN providers &lt;ref name="ATIS-0200003"&gt;CDN Interconnection Use Case Specification and High Level Requirements. Technical report, ATIS, 2011.

The doctrine of '''deviation''' is a particular aspect of [[legal contract|contracts]] of carriage of goods by sea. A deviation is a departure from the "agreed route" or the "usual route", and it can amount to a serious  a [[breach of contract]].  The consequences of unjustified deviation are very grave for the carrier, who is thereby prevented from relying upon any exclusion clause which limits his liability.

==The scope of deviation ==

The "agreed route" is identified from the [[contract of carriage]], as evidenced by the [[bill of lading]].  The ports of origin and destination (e.g. "Piraeus to Liverpool"') define the route.  The "usual route" is not necessarily the shortest route, but is a version of the agreed route, taking into account safety issues, distances, seasonal conditions and war zones.  For instance, the route "Auckland to London" could be via Suez, Panama, the Cape of Good Hope, or Cape Horn, but the usual route will be identified by reference to current practice or to any previous dealings of the  parties.

Although a deviation is primarily a departure from the agreed route or the usual route, the concept of deviation extends beyond this.  Deviation may include any unjustified delay such as remaining at authorised ports longer than necessary, or acting beyond the agreed scope of the voyage.  For example, if a ship makes an authorised call at a port, but stays on to trade or break bulk, this action may amount to a deviation.

The concept of deviation has been extended (''sub nom'' “quasi deviation”) to cover wrongful transhipment, careless stowage, and stowage in the wrong part of the ship (such as on deck, rather than below decks).&lt;ref&gt;Brandt v Liverpool [1920] 1 KB 575&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Berkshire [1974] 1 LL R 185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Royal Exchange v Dixon (1886) 12 App Cas 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Antares [1987] 1 LL R 424&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Chanda [1989] 2 LL R 494&lt;/ref&gt;  The consequences of quasi-deviation are the same as for ordinary deviation.
 
Article IV Rule 4 of the [[Hague-Visby Rules]]  provides: "Any deviation in saving or attempting to save life or property at sea or any reasonable deviation shall not be deemed to be an infringement or breach of these Rules or of the contract of carriage, and the carrier shall not be liable for any loss or damage resulting therefrom".  The Hague-Visby Rules do not define deviation, but rely on existing common law definitions.  Nor do the  Rules define “any reasonable deviation”, but in decided cases{{cn|date=January 2018}} the phrase has been taken to include deviation…..
#to avoid foul weather,
# to join a [[convoy]],
# to avoid capture or detention,
# to take stricken passengers or crew for medical attention, 
# to effect necessary repairs, (though this may be evidence of unseaworthiness),
# [[mutiny]] of the crew.

If a justified deviation is followed by an unjustified deviation,  the doctrine of deviation will apply from the unjustified deviation.&lt;ref&gt;Stag Line v Foscolo, Mango &amp; Co [1932] AC 328&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scaramanga v Stamp (1880) 5 CPD 295&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishing the doctrine==
Deviation in carriage of goods by sea is treated as a serious breach because it undermines the carrier's prime duty to the shipper of the cargo, namely to carry the cargo to its destination will "all due despatch".&lt;ref&gt;[[Hadley v Baxendale]] (1854) 9 ex 341&lt;/ref&gt;

The English common law of deviation is establish by two cases, ''Glynn v Margetson''&lt;ref&gt;Glynn v Margetson 1893 AC351&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Leduc v Ward''.&lt;ref&gt;Leduc v Ward 1888 20 QBD 475&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Glynn v Margetson'' (1893), a vessel was to carry a perishable consignment of Seville marmalade oranges from Malaga to Liverpool.  The contract included a "liberty clause" which allowed the vessel "liberty to proceed and stay at any ports in any rotation in the Mediterranean, Levant, Black sea or Adriatic, or on the coasts of Africa, Spain, Portugal or France.."  On leaving Malaga, the vessel did not head straight for Liverpool, but made her way to Burriana, 350 miles up the coast.  As a result of the delay, the cargo had deteriorated by the time it reached England.  The [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] (establishing the so-called "main purpose rule"), held that the clause, if given full effect, would defeat the main purpose of the contract and would be, in effect, an exemption clause which should be ignored. They gave the clause a limited construction, namely that the vessel could have liberty to proceed and stay only at ports reasonably close to the agreed route from Malaga to Liverpool, such as Cadiz or Lisbon.&lt;ref&gt;Cases &amp; Materials on Carriage of Goods by Sea, 3rd edition - Martin Dockray - {{ISBN|1-85941-796-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Leduc v Ward''(1882), a vessel was to voyage from Fiume (modern day Rijeka) to Dunkirk.  The bill of lading gave "liberty to call at any ports in any order".  She did not proceed to Dunkirk, but headed for Glasgow, and was lost in a storm near Ailsa Craig.  Just as in ''Glynn v Margetson'', the Court of Appeal held that the deviation was unjustifiable and was not permitted by the liberty clause, so the carrier was liable for the lost cargo.&lt;ref&gt;Cases &amp; Materials on Carriage of Goods by Sea, 3rd edition - Martin Dockray - {{ISBN|1-85941-796-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Had the court held that the deviation was justified, the carrier would have avoided liability as the storm would have been an "Act of God").  Even though it was accepted that the shipper had been verbally informed that the vessel might make passage to Glasgow, this evidence was not admissible, because the [[parol evidence rule]] prevents recourse to extraneous evidence when construing a written document. Using the criteria of [[Inequality of bargaining power|differential bargaining strength]] of the parties,  whereby the carrier is usually deemed to have greater bargaining power than the shipper, note that the parol evidence rule may be relaxed if a shipper seeks to rely on any verbal promises of the carrier (rather than ''vice versa'', as in  ''Leduc v Ward'') .

==The consequences of deviation==

An unjustified deviation can be a serious breach of the contract of carriage, and the carrier will be prevented from relying upon any exclusion clause which limits his liability.  Such clauses include the "liberty clauses" of ''Leduc v Ward'', but in particular include the huge range of exemptions granted to carriers by Article IV of the [[Hague-Visby Rules]].

===Extending the scope of the rule===
Although a shipping case, the "Main Purpose Rule" within ''Glynn v Margetson'' for a time became the basis of the common law of exemption clauses in [[English contract law]], as shown in the case of [[Karsales (Harrow) Ltd v Wallis|''Karsales v Wallis'']].&lt;ref&gt;''Karsales v Wallis'' [1956] 2 All ER 866&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, a comprehensive and well-drafted exemption clause could not protect a car dealer who had supplied a used Buick with its cylinder head adrift.  The court held that the contract was to supply a car ("a vehicle capable of self-propulsion"), so the Buick was not a "car", and the seller could not rely on a clause when there was "breach of a fundamental obligation". (Note that ''"breach of a fundamental obligation"'' seems little more than a rewording of ''Glynn v Margetson's'' ''"breach of the main purpose"'').

However, the English law of contract has progressed beyond the ''Karsales'' case.  The definitive statements of the common law of contract are the ''[[Suisse Atlantique Societe d'Armament SA v NV Rotterdamsche Kolen Centrale|Suisse Atlantique]]''&lt;ref&gt;Suisse Atlantique Societe d'Armament SA v NV Rotterdamsche Kolen Centrale [1967] 1 AC 361&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Photo Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd|Photo Productions v Securicor]]''&lt;ref&gt;Photo Production v Securicor Transport [1980] AC 827&lt;/ref&gt;  These two cases provide that in the event of really serious breach, or [[fundamental breach]], whether or not an exemption clause is effective is '''a question of construction, not of law'''; so that exemption clauses may not be automatically be ignored after a fundamental breach. The common law approach has been to some extent superseded by statutory provisions, such as the [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977]], as amended by the [[Consumer Rights Act 2015]].  However, although the general law of contract has "moved on", the strict rule of ''Glynn v Margetson'' is, for the time being, still central to the law of deviation.

==Insurance issues==

When goods are carried by sea, they are effectively insured twice.  First, prudent cargo-owners (shippers or consignees) will insure their cargo, and, secondly,  carriers (shipowners) will have cover for third-party liability from their [[Protection and indemnity insurance|P&amp;I Club]].  If the carrier is responsible for causing loss or damage, the P&amp;I Club will pay; but if the carrier can avoid liability, say, via an exemption clause or via Article IV of the Hague-Visby Rules, the cargo-owner will have to make a claim on his own insurance.

If an unjustified deviation occurs, the voyage has changed, and the insurer may be discharged from subsequent liability. Under the policy, the insurer accepts only the agreed risks.  A crucial policy requirement is that the ship shall proceed to her port of destination by the shortest and safest route (or usual route), and not to make any unjustified deviation.

An unjustifiable deviation does not necessarily avoid the policy, but it may cancel any liability of the [[underwriter]]s for any loss incurred after the time of the deviation; but the insurer remains bound to indemnify any losses sustained prior to the deviation. Although the insurer is discharged from subsequent responsibility, he is normally entitled to retain the whole premium.

The '''''Duke Journal of Gender Law &amp; Policy''''' ('''''DJGLP''''') is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] [[law journal]] published by students at the [[Duke University School of Law]].

The journal describes itself as focusing on topics "relating to [[gender]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], and [[Social class|class]] in the context of [[law]] and [[public policy]]" and with the mission to "foster debate, to publish work largely overlooked by other law reviews, and to encourage scholarship outside the bounds of conventional law school curricula...[t]aking an expansive view of law, engaging other disciplines including [[literature]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[psychology]], [[politics]], and [[critical theory]]. Our goal is not only to explore what the law was and is, but what it could and should be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About | url=http://www.law.duke.edu/journals/djglp/about | website = law.duke.edu | publisher = [[Duke University School of Law]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Published twice yearly, ''DJGLP'' issues are usually centered on a selected topic which in past years has included "Gender and Race in [[Adoption]]," "[[HIV]] Law and Policy," "Gender and Sports," "Gender Issues in [[Divorce]]," and "[[Queer theory|Queer Theory]]." In January 2007, ''DJGLP'' published "Makeup, Identity Performance &amp; Discrimination," the largest issue ever published by any journal at Duke Law School. In May 2007, ''DJGLP'' published "Gender, Sexuality &amp; the Military," the second largest issue ever published by any journal at Duke Law School.

The staff of ''DJGLP'' consists of 25-30 student editors, selected for membership based on performance in the 1L Casenote Competition and the 2L Work-on/Note-on Program. The faculty advisor is Professor Katharine Bartlett, who provides general guidance and advises the editors in topic and author selection.

An '''edict''' is a decree or announcement of a [[law]], often associated with [[monarchy|monarchism]], but it can be under any official authority. Synonyms include dictum and pronouncement.

''Edict'' derives from the Latin [[wikt:edictum#Latin|edictum]]. In the late [[15th century]] the spelling was edycte and known as meaning a "proclamation having the force of law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/edict|title=edict – Definition of edict in English by Oxford Dictionaries|author=|date=|website=Oxford Dictionaries – English|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable edicts==
*[[Edicts of Ashoka]], by the [[Mauryan]] emperor, [[Ashoka]], during his reign from 272 BCE to 231 BCE.
*[[Edictum perpetuum]] (129), an [[Roman Empire|Imperial]] revision of the long-standing [[Praetor's Edict]], a periodic document which first began under the late [[Roman Republic]] (c.509–44 BC).
*[[Edict on Maximum Prices]] (301), by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Diocletian]]. It attempted to reform the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] system of taxation and to stabilize the coinage.
*[[Edict of Toleration by Galerius|Edict of Toleration]] (311), by [[Galerius]] before his death. This proclamation removed all previous restrictions on the [[Christianity|Christian]] religion, allowing it and all other religions to be practiced throughout the [[Roman Empire]].
*[[Edict of Milan]] (313), by [[Constantine the Great]], and [[Licinius]], the Eastern [[Tetrarchy|tetrarch]]. It declared that the [[Roman Empire]] would be neutral with regard to religious worship, officially ending all government-sanctioned religious persecution, especially of Christianity.
*[[Edict of Paris]] (614), by [[Clotaire II]] of [[Neustria]]. It tried to establish order by standardising the appointment process for public officials across the realm. It guaranteed the nobility their ancient rights, and in this respect has been seen as a French [[Magna Carta]].
*[[Edict of Pistres]] (864), by [[Charles the Bald]]. It reformed the [[West Franks|West Frankish]] army and laid the foundations for the famous French [[chivalry]] of the [[High Middle Ages]]. It also ordered the construction of fortified bridgeheads to deal with [[Viking]] raiders.
*[[Edict of Expulsion]] (1290), by King [[Edward I of England]]. It ordered the expulsion of all [[Jews]] from England and the [[confiscation]] of their real property.
*[[Diet of Worms|Edict of Worms]] (1521), by the [[Diet of Worms]], with [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] presiding. It declared [[Martin Luther]] to be an outlaw and banned the reading or possession of his writings. The edict permitted anyone to kill Luther without legal consequence.
* [[Sakoku Edict of 1635]]. This '''[[Sakoku]] Edict''' (''Sakoku-rei'', 鎖国令) of 1635 was the third of a series issued by [[Tokugawa Iemitsu]] (徳川 家光), ''[[shōgun]]'' (将軍) of [[Japan]] from 1623 to 1651. The Edict of 1635 is considered a prime example of the Japanese desire for seclusion.  This decree is one of the many acts that were written by Iemitsu to eliminate Catholic influence, and enforced strict government rules and regulations to impose these ideas.  The Edict of 1635 was written to the two commissioners of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] (長崎), a port city located in southwestern Japan.
*[[Edict of Saint-Germain]] (1562), by [[Catherine de' Medici]], Queen of [[France]], in January 1562. It was an [[edict of toleration]] that recognized the existence of the [[Protestants]] and guaranteed [[freedom of conscience]] and private worship. It forbade [[Huguenot]] worship within towns (where conflicts flared up too easily), but permitted Protestant [[synod]]s and [[session (Presbyterianism)|consistories]].
*[[Edict of Nantes]] (1598), by King [[Henry IV of France]]. It granted all of the above listings the French Protestants (also known as [[Huguenots]]) substantial rights in [[France]], a [[Catholic]] nation.
*[[Edict of Restitution]] (1629), by [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]]. It attempted to restore the religious and territorial settlement after the [[Peace of Augsburg]] (1555). It forbade the [[secularization]] of land and property belonging to the [[Catholic Church]].
*[[Edict of Fontainebleau]] (1685), by [[Louis XIV of France]]. It revoked the [[Edict of Nantes]] (1598) and ordered the destruction of [[Huguenot]] churches.
* A [[France|French]] edict by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Finance Minister Colbert]] (17th century) was intended to improve the quality of [[cloth]]. This law declared that if a [[merchant]]'s cloth was not found to be satisfactory on three separate occasions, then he was to be tied to a post with the cloth attached to him.
*[[Edict of Toleration (Hawaii)|Edict of Toleration]] (1839), by King [[Kamehameha III]] of [[Hawaii]]. It allowed for the establishment of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu|Catholic Church in Hawaii]].
*[[Hatt-ı Hümayun of 1856]] (Reform Edict of 1856) by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan [[Abdülmecid I]], promised equality in education, government appointments, and administration of justice to all regardless of creed.

This expression is the base of the Islamic institution of ''[[hisbah]]''. It forms a central part of the Islamic doctrine for all Muslims. It is also explicitly referred to in two [[Ancillaries of the Faith]] in [[Shia Islam]], [[commanding what is just]] and [[forbidding what is evil]].{{cn|date=November 2015}}

==Some Quranic examples==

*[[Sura]] [[Al Imran|3]].104 &lt;sup&gt;[[Translation of the Qur'an|translated]] by [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]]&lt;/sup&gt;
::''Let there arise out of you a band of people inviting to all that is good, '''enjoining what is right, and forbidding what is wrong''': They are the ones to attain felicity.''
alternative translation:
::''Let there arise out of you a nation who invites to goodness and '''enjoin What is right and forbid What is evil''': They are the one's to attain felicity.''&lt;ref name="GFQ" /&gt;

*[[Sura]] [[Al Imran|3]].110 &lt;sup&gt;[[Translation of the Qur'an|translated]] by [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]]&lt;/sup&gt;
::''Ye are the best of peoples, evolved for mankind, '''enjoining what is right, forbidding what is wrong''', and believing in Allah. If only the People of the Book had faith, it were best for them: among them are some who have faith, but most of them are transgressors.''
alternative translation:
::''You are the best community that has been raised up for mankind: '''You enjoin What is right and forbid What is evil''', and You believe in Allah; if the people of the scripture deary it, it had been better for them, some of them believers, but most of them are evil-livers.''&lt;ref name="GFQ" /&gt;

Other examples include:
*[[Sura]] 9, v.71&lt;ref name="GFQ" /&gt;
*[[Sura]] 9, v.112&lt;ref name="GFQ" /&gt;
*[[Sura]] 31, v.17&lt;ref name="GFQ" /&gt;

==Hadith examples==
[[Abu Sa‘id al-Khudri]] reported that the prophet [[Muhammad]] said, "Whoever amongst you sees an evil, he must change it with his hand. If he is not able to do so, then with his tongue. And if he is not able to do so, then with his heart, and that is the weakest form of faith".&lt;ref name="TKFD" /&gt;

A standard medieval interpretation of this Hadith is, as [[Al-Nawawi]] had explained, that such passages of scripture had to be interpreted in accordance with established Shariah principles, such as the state's sole prerogative in declaring [[jihad]]. 'Changing the reprehensible by hand,' or by compulsion, was the purview of the state alone. 'Changing with the tongue' was the right of the ulama. Ordinary, individual Muslims should only reject the reprehensible with their hearts.&lt;ref name="jacb"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = A.C. Brown|first1 = Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan A.C.

Quote: "Commanding the good with hand is for those in position of political authority, with tongue it is for the scholars and with the heart it for the laymen."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditions (interpretation)==
A person should have knowledge of what is considered ''[[Fard|wajib]]'' (obligatory or duty) and ''[[haram]]'' (sinful or forbidden) in relation to interpreting the two requisites although in a broad-spectrum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4119">{{Chinese Legalism}}
'''Fa''' ({{zh|s=法}};{{IPA-cmn|fà}}) is a concept in [[Chinese philosophy]] that covers ethics, logic, and law. It can be translated as "law" in some contexts, but more often as "model" or "standard." First gaining importance in the [[Mohism|Mohist]] school of thought, the concept was principally elaborated in [[Chinese Legalism|Legalism]]. In [[Han Fei]]'s philosophy, the king is the sole source of ''fa'' (law), taught to the common people so that there would be a harmonious society free of chance occurrences, disorder, and "appeal to privilege". High officials were not to be held above ''fa'' (law or protocol), nor were they to be allowed to independently create their own ''fa'', uniting both [[Fiat (policy debate)|executive fiat]] and [[rule of law]].&lt;ref&gt;Han Fei. (2003). Basic Writings. Columbia University Press: New York, p. 7, 21- 28, 40, 91&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Xun Kuang|Xunzi]], a philosopher that would end up being foundational in [[Han dynasty]] [[Confucianism]], also took up ''fa'', suggesting that it could only be properly assessed by the Confucian [[Sage (Sophos)|sage]] (ruler), and that the most important ''fa'' were the very rituals that Mozi had ridiculed for their ostentatious waste and lack of benefit for the people at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Robins |first=Dan |title=Xunzi |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=Fall 2008 |editor-first=Edward N. |editor-last=Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/xunzi/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mohism and the School of Names==
The concept of ''fa'' first gained importance in the [[Mohism|Mohist]] school of thought. To [[Mozi]], a standard must stand "three tests" in order to determine its efficacy and morality.&lt;ref name="University of Idaho Press"&gt;[http://www.class.uidaho.edu/ngier/308/mozipp.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these tests was its origin; if the standard had precedence in the actions or thought of the semi-mythological [[Three Sovereigns and the Five Emperors|sage kings]] of the [[Xia dynasty]] whose examples are frequently cited in classical Chinese philosophy. The second test was one of validity; does the model stand up to evidence in the estimation of the people? The third and final test was one of applicability; this final one is a [[utilitarian]] estimation of the net good that, if implemented, the standard would have on both the people and the state.&lt;ref&gt;Mozi. (2003). Basic Writings. Burton Watson, Ed. Columbia University Press: New York, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

The third test speaks to the fact that to the Mohists, a ''fa'' was not simply an abstract model, but an active tool. The real-world use and practical application of ''fa'' were vital. Yet ''fa'' as models were also used in later Mohist logic as principles used in [[Inference|deductive]] reasoning. As classical Chinese philosophical logic was based on [[analogy]] rather than [[syllogism]], ''fa'' were used as benchmarks to determine the validity of logical claims through comparison. There were three ''fa'' in particular that were used by these later Mohists (or "[[School of Names|Logicians]]") to assess such claims, which were mentioned earlier. The first was considered a "root" standard, a concern for precedence and origin. The second, a "source", a concern for [[empiricism]]. The third, a "use", a concern for the [[Consequentialism|consequence]] and pragmatic utility of a standard. These three ''fa'' were used by the Mohists to both promote social welfare and denounce ostentation or wasteful spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fraser |first=Chris |title=Mohism |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=Summer 2010 |editor-first=Edward N. |editor-last=Zalta |url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2010/entries/mohism/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lei da Ficha Limpa''''' (''English:'' '''Clean Record Act''') or Supplementary Law no. 135 of 2010 is a Brazilian act that amended the ''Conditions of Ineligibility Act'' (''Supplementary Law no. 64'' of 1990). It was the fourth [[bill (law)|bill]] proposed by direct people's [[initiative]] as law in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;http://g1.globo.com/especiais/eleicoes-2010/noticia/2010/05/ficha-limpa-e-o-quarto-projeto-de-iniciativa-popular-se-tornar-lei.html&lt;/ref&gt; It was devised by Judge Marlon Reis and received about 1.3 million signatures before being submitted to the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]].&lt;ref name="pequeno"/&gt; The act makes a candidate who has been impeached, has resigned to avoid impeachment, or been convicted by a decision of a collective body (with more than one judge) ineligible to hold public office for eight years, even if possible appeals remain.&lt;ref name="Veja"/&gt;

The project was approved in the [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)|Chamber of Deputies]] on May 5, 2010 and by the [[Federal Senate]] on May 19, 2010 by unanimous vote. It was sanctioned by the [[President of Brazil|President]], [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]], and became the Supplementary Law no. 135 of June 4, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brasileconomico.com.br/noticias/a-reforma-possivel_107950.html |author= |title=A reforma possível |trans-title=The reform possible |accessdate=11 October 2011 |date=11 October 2011 |publisher=[[Brasil Econômico]] |quote=A Lei da Ficha Limpa proíbe a candidatura de políticos que foram condenados em decisões colegiadas de segunda instância. |language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2012, the [[Supreme Federal Court]] (STF) deemed the law constitutional and valid for the next elections to be held in Brazil, which was considered a victory for the position advocated by the Superior Electoral Court in the [[Brazilian general election, 2010|2010 elections]].&lt;ref name="Veja"/&gt;

== Origin ==

The story of the Bill 519/09 began with an anti-corruption campaign in February 1997 by the Brazilian Commission for Justice and Peace (CBJP), and the [[Episcopal Conference of Brazil|National Conference of Bishops of Brazil]] (CNBB). This project continued a 1996 fraternity campaign of the CNBB titled "Brotherhood and Politics".

The petition was delivered to Congress on September 24, 2009, with 85% of the signatures collected in the parishes and dioceses of the CNBB (24 September 2009).&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.cancaonova.com/noticia.php?id=274146 Michel Temer receives Dom Dimas and leaders Campaign Clean Record]. New Song. Retrieved on September 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; was approved after a national campaign for its approval, the Clean Record campaign, led by the Movement to Combat Electoral Corruption (MCCE).&lt;ref name="correio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/app/noticia182/2010/04/04/politica,i=183765/PROJETO+FICHA+LIMPA+INVADE+TWITTER.shtml |title=Projeto Ficha Limpa invade Twitter |author=Almeida, Daniela |publisher=Correio Braziliense |date=4 April 2010 |accessdate=2 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement worked over a year to collect 1.3 million signatures (1% of the national electorate) in 26 states of the federation and the Federal District.&lt;ref name="pequeno"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jornalpequeno.com.br/blog/manoelsantos/?p=2649 |title=Marlon Reis, juiz maranhense, é um dos 100 brasileiros mais influentes |trans-title=Marlon Reis, Judge Maranhão, is one of the 100 most influential Brazilians. |author=Santos, Manoel |date=7 December 2009 |publisher=Jornal Pequeno |accessdate=2 September 2010 |language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign to send the Chamber of Delegates a bill of popular initiative also included mobilizing through [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[Orkut]] and the Brazilian chapter of [[Avaaz]], a global network of activists.&lt;ref name="correio" /&gt;

== Superior Electoral Court ==

=== The first legal challenge to Clean Record ===

The first major challenge to the Clean Record Act for elections took place in the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. It concerned the 2010 general elections, presided by Justice [[Ricardo Lewandowski]]. By six votes to one, Justice Marco Aurélio's vote prevailed, holding that the law would apply to that year's election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://noticias.terra.com.br/eleicoes/2010/noticias/0,,OI4628626-EI15311,00-TSE+reafirma+validade+da+Ficha+Limpa+para+este+ano.html|author= |title=TSE reafima validade da Ficha Limpa para este ano |accessdate=17 August 2010|publisher=Terra Notícias|date=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewandowski, as president of the TSE, visited many Regional Electoral Courts, seeking the enforcement of the law.

Visiting TRE Ceará, on 29 July 2010, the then-president of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal said:&lt;blockquote&gt;The TSE guides all TREs to adopt the Clean Record earlier this year. This is the orientation of the TSE, as we move away from the article 16 of the Constitution which deals with the principle of annuality, which is one device that law says that all entailing changes in the electoral process only comes into force a year later. But we said that this does not apply because there was a change in the electoral process|author=[[Ricardo Lewandowski|Enrique Ricardo Lewandowski]]|source=&lt;ref name="parlamentopb" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This guidance told Regional Electoral Courts to apply the Clean Slate Law to the current elections.&lt;ref name="parlamentopb"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.parlamentopb.com.br/Noticias/?presidente-do-tse-diz-que-ficha-limpa-vale-para-casos-passados-29.07.2010 |author= |title=Presidente do TSE orienta Tribunais Regionais |accessdate=29 July 2010|publisher=Parlamento|date=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- if someone can fix the translation on this and wants to to incorporate it after they do, I guess that would be ok but I suggest not using the pull quote ~{{centered pull quote|When approving the Law of Clean Record, the legislature sought to protect the administrative probity, morality for the exercise of the mandate and the normality and legitimacy of the elections.

For Lewandowski, the Law of Clean Record put a "filter" on Brazilian politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2012/02/ficha-limpa-coloca-filtro-na-politica-brasileira-diz-presidente-do-tse.html |author= |title=Ficha Limpa coloca filtro na política brasileira, diz presidente do TSE |accessdate=18 October 2010|publisher=Globo G1|date=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluation of Supreme Court ==
=== Impasse ===
[[Image:Brazilian Supreme Federal Tribunal.jpg|thumb|300px|Interior of the building of the [[Supreme Federal Court]] building]]
ons
After the electoral court decision that upheld the validity for the 2010 elections, on account of criticisms made by members of the Supreme Court against the application of the law, such as Justice Gilmar Mendes and Marcus Aurelius. Several candidates barred by law from Clean Slate filed legal motions with the Supreme, for the right to run for office on the grounds that the law was unconstitutional or not in effect yet since another law bars changes in the electoral process that take effect the same election year. Those who were in favour of the law taking effect that year claimed, among other things, that the law would not change the election process, but only the rules for registration of candidates.

On Sept. 22, less than a month to the elections, the justices of the Federal Supreme Court (STF) began the trial of the case of Joaquim Roriz, a former senator who resigned in 2007 to escape a lawsuit for breach of parliamentary decorum. So Roriz, trying to fight the government of the Federal District for the fourth time, had his record challenged by lower courts. The outcome of this trial was important because it would define all other cases in that election. After Justice [[Carlos Ayres Britto]], [[rapporteur]] for the case, voted in favour of the law being applied to Roriz, President Cezar Peluso interrupted the proceedings to question the constitutionality of the law. This surprised the other magistrates, and after a standoff, justice Dias Toffoli asked for in-chambers review. The trial resumed the next day, the 23rd, and the vote was tied, with five justices voting in favour and five against:
In favor: Carlos Ayres Britto, Carmen Lucia, Joaquim Barbosa, Ricardo Lewandowski, Ellen Gracie Northfleet.
Cons: Gilmar Mendes, Dias Toffoli, Marco Aurélio Mello, Celso de Mello, Cezar Peluso.

==== Stalemate ====

The court had at the time of the trial only ten justices, since justice {{ILL|Eros Grau|pt}} had retired voluntarily on August 2, 2010  and the position had not been filled. Since the full court had an even number of justices and the vote tied at 5-5, intense arguments broke out between the justices. [[Cezar Peluso]], the chief justice, chose to suspend judgement without announcing the result. According to ''O Globo'' the "expectation is that the justices will return to the issue next Wednesday, four days before the election." The report also noted that possible results, according to the votes cast:

* Ricardo Lewandowski, Carmen Lucia, Joaquim Barbosa, Ellen Gracie and Carlos Ayres Britto (rapporteur of the case) proposed upholding the TSE decision, i.e. that the Clean Record Act was already in effect;
* Antonio Dias Toffoli, Gilmar Mendes and Marcus Aurelius suggested that the court wait for the appointment of a new justice, and the court decides the vote using the newly named judge casting a vote, or a tie-breaker given by the president. President [[Cezar Peluso]] refused to have his vote counted twice, declaring he was not a "despot".

==== Decision ====

The [[Supreme Federal Court]] ruled in 2010 that the Clean Record law applies to that year's elections and applied to resigning the political office to escape impeachment process, even in situations that occurred before the law.&lt;ref name="terra"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://noticias.terra.com.br/eleicoes/2010/noticias/0,,OI4759280-EI15311,00-Maioria+do+STF+vota+por+validade+da+Lei+da+Ficha+Limpa.html |author= |title=Após empate, STF decide que Lei da Ficha Limpa vale em 2010 |publisher=Terra - Eleições 2010 |date=27 October 2010 |accessdate=28 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uol"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eleicoes.uol.com.br/2010/ultimas-noticias/2010/10/27/empate-no-supremo-mantem-lei-da-ficha-limpa-em-vigor.jhtm |title=Empate no Supremo mantém Lei da Ficha Limpa em vigor |author=D'Agostino, Rosanne |publisher=UOL - Eleições 2010 |date=27 October 2010 |accessdate=28 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="G1-2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://g1.globo.com/especiais/eleicoes-2010/noticia/2010/10/apesar-de-empate-stf-confirma-validade-da-lei-da-ficha-limpa.html |title=Apesar de empate, STF confirma validade da Lei da Ficha Limpa |author=Santos, Débora |publisher=G1.com |date=27 October 2010 |accessdate=28 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial on the case of Congressman [[Jader Barbalho]], again ended in a draw.&lt;ref name="terra" /&gt; Ricardo Lewandowski, Carmen Lucia, Ellen Gracie, Joaquim Barbosa and Ayres Britto again manifest by the immediate application of the law.

On March 23, 2011, the validity of the election law was overturned in 2010  6-5 by the Supreme Court.

{{pull quote|I am under the impression that the Supreme Law of the land killed Clean Record.|author=Pedro Simon}}

=== Constitutionality ===

The [[Order of Attorneys of Brazil]] (OAB) filed a declaratory action of constitutionality of the law, expected to be tried in the second half of 2011. [28] The trial was suspended from the beginning of November to the 28th due to a request from justice [[Joaquim Barbosa]] for in-chambers review. Besides its scope -- when it would take effect -- the Supreme Court was debating the constitutionality of the provision itself. This discussion was initiated by a lawsuit filed by OAB that tried to resolve any doubt about the constitutionality of the law.

After that two more actions were entered. The three actions were:

* ADC 30, [30] proposed by the Federal Council of the [[Order of Attorneys of Brazil|Bar Association of Brazil]] (CFOAB);
* ADC 29, [31] proposed by the [[Popular Socialist Party (Brazil)|Popular Socialist Party]];
* ADI 4578, [32] proposed by the National Confederation of Liberal Professions (CNPL).

They were tried jointly. The plenary session on February 15, 2012 was closed, suspending the trial, scheduled to resume on February 16, 2012 (Thursday). They expressed the parties as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stf.jus.br/portal/cms/verNoticiaDetalhe.asp?idConteudo=193508&amp;tip=UN STF (Notícias) - Partes apresentam argumentos no julgamento sobre Ficha Limpa] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*the [[Office of the Solicitor-General in Brazil|Solicitor-General of the Union]], [[Luís Inácio Adams]], the [[attorney general]] [[Roberto Gurgel]], the national president of the Bar Association of Brazil, Ophir Cavalcante, and the Popular Socialist Party, argued the constitutionality of the law and its applicability to the events that occurred before 2012, when candidates registered for the upcoming municipal elections;
* the National Confederation of Liberal Professions protested against sub-paragraph "m", section I, article 1, the LC 64/90, with the wording given by LC 135/2010, which made ineligible "those who are excluded of the profession, by the penalty decision of the competent professional body, due to ethical and professional infraction for a period of eight (8) years, unless the act there been annulled or suspended by the judiciary."

==== Result ====
On February 16, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled that the law did not violate the Brazilian Constitution and was in force for the [[Brazilian municipal elections, 2012|2012 elections]] and for elections to come.&lt;ref name="Veja"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://veja.abril.com.br/noticia/brasil/stf-chancela-lei-da-ficha-limpa-depois-de-20-meses-de-duvidas |publisher=Veja.abril.com.br |title=STF chancela Lei da Ficha Limpa, que valerá em 2012|trans-title=STF seal Clean Record Act, which will cost in 2012. |editor=[[Revista Veja]] |author=Luciana Marques |date=16 February 2012 |accessdate=2 March 2012 |language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

STF justices voted 7-4 in favour of the law. The affirmative votes were based on the "principle of morality," in the ninth paragraph of Article 14 of the Constitution of Brazil: "conditions of ineligibility to protect the administrative probity, morality for the exercise of mandate, considered the candidate's past life." The four dissenting opinions argued on the basis of the principle of [[presumption of innocence]], in section 57 of Article 5 (an entrenched clause) of the Constitution of Brazil, which says that no one shall be considered guilty until a penal sentence was final and unappealable. The Clean Record Act says that anyone convicted of crime was ineligible for a collective body, even though recourse was still available, would become ineligible. Justices opposed to the constitutionality of the law deemed that section of the legislation unconstitutional. However, justice Ricardo Lewandowski said the presumption of innocence that applies to criminal cases, is not being wide enough to reach the text of the Clean Record.&lt;ref name="Veja"/&gt;
&lt;!-- no idea what the following says. Can return if someone fixes the translation, because I am sure this isn't what he said.;
Justices Carlos Ayres Britto and Rosa Weber during their arguments in favor of their votes for the law, stated:&lt;ref name="Veja"/&gt;

== Legacy ==

In [[Novo Hamburgo]] a law was proposed to prohibit persons, convicted among other offences, of crimes against public faith and popular economy from being appointed to executive positions in the city administration.&lt;ref name="burgo"/&gt; The city already had a similar law.&lt;ref name="burgo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://novohamburgo.org/site/noticias/novo-hamburgo/2011/12/21/camara-aprova-ficha-limpa-para-cargos-do-executivo-por-unanimidade/ |author= |title=Câmara aprova Ficha Limpa para cargos do Executivo por unanimidade |language= Portuguese |accessdate=22 December 2011 |date=21 December 2011 |work=CNMH |publisher=Novo Hamburgo |quote=“Novo Hamburgo agora também terá sua lei da ficha limpa.” [...] A proposta veda a nomeação para cargos e funções públicas de cidadãos condenados por crimes contra a economia popular, a fé pública, o meio ambiente, a saúde pública e de lavagem ou ocultação de bens, entre outros.

[...]  A Câmara já havia aprovado um projeto nesse sentido para o Poder Legislativo (PL n° 74/2011, de Leonardo Hoff, Raul Cassel, Jesus Maciel e Sergio Hanich, hoje Lei Municipal n° 2.335/2011).}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ijuí]] on March 5, 2012 the Law of Clean Record (Law No. 5586) was enacted by the president of the City Council disciplining appointments in committee and functions gratified in the bodies of the executive and legislative branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ijui.com/noticias/ijui/31907-lei-da-ficha-limpa-municipal-e-sancionada-pelo-presidente-da-camara-de-ijui |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304202659/http://www.ijui.com/noticias/ijui/31907-lei-da-ficha-limpa-municipal-e-sancionada-pelo-presidente-da-camara-de-ijui |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }} {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 many municipalities are adapting their legislation to implement the Clean Record.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.camara.sp.gov.br/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9283:entenda-como-vai-funcionar-a-lei-de-ficha-limpa-municipal&amp;catid=33:cidadania&amp;Itemid=90 {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Ranking of corruption ==
Based on data released by the [[Superior Electoral Court]], the Movement to Combat Electoral Corruption released a balance on 4 October 2007 with the parties that include the largest number of parliamentarians quashed by electoral corruption since 2000. The [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]]  appeared in third place on the list with 58 cases, behind only the [[Democrats (Brazil)|Democrats]] and the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]].&lt;ref name="O Globo 04-10-2007"&gt;{{cite web|title=Desde 2000, 623 políticos foram cassados. DEM lidera ranking|work=O Globo|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/pais/mat/2007/10/04/298003467.asp|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to analysis released on 8 September 2012, of 317 Brazilian politicians who were barred from running in elections by the Clean Record Act the [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]] is the party that has the largest number of barred candidates with 56 party members.&lt;ref name="FichaLimpa"&gt;{{cite web|author=Talita Abrantes|title=PSDB tem o maior número de barrados pelo Ficha Limpa|work=Exame|url=http://exame.abril.com.br/brasil/noticias/psdb-tem-o-maior-numero-de-barrados-pelo-ficha-limpa|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

The law provides for the ineligibility of candidates who have been found guilty by courts of account, among other associations, without, however, requiring a [[prejudice (legal procedure)|final and unappealable]] conviction. Thus, some argue that the law goes against Article 5 subsection LVII of the [[Constitution of Brazil]], the clause concerning the [[presumption of innocence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conjur.com.br/2012-mar-13/direito-defesa-lei-ficha-limpa-fere-principio-presuncao-inocencia|author=Conjur|title=Lei da Ficha Limpa fere a presunção de inocência|accessdate=2 February 2013|date=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; And furthermore, since these courts and entities do not hold the last word in the Brazilian courts, note justice [[Gilmar Mendes]] and columnist [[Reinaldo Azevedo]]. So could create up several courts with broad discretion in decision outside the legal framework. For instance, courts of accounts that can not pass the bill mayors, who would thus ineligible. Since the appointment of judges of the courts of account is made by state governors, it is feared the political use of state courts account, making ineligible mayors opposing the state government. Moreover, it is feared that the legislation hurts innocent people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/impresso,ficha-limpa-e-uma-roleta-russa-fara-vitimas-para-todo-lado-diz-gilmar-mendes,843835,0.htm |author= |title=‘Ficha limpa é uma roleta russa.

'''Geltungsjude''' was the term for people who were considered [[Jews]] by the first supplementary decree to the [[Nuremberg Laws]] from 14 November 1935. The term wasn't used officially, but was coined because the persons were deemed (''gelten'' in [[German language|German]]) Jews rather than exactly belonging to any of the categories of the previous Nuremberg Laws. There were three categories of Geltungsjuden: 1. offspring of an intermarriage who belonged to the Jewish community after 1935; 2. offspring of an intermarriage who was married to a Jew after 1935; 3. illegitimate child of a Geltungsjude, born after 1935.

==Definition==
The definition of these persons in the decree is as follows:
:''ARTICLE 5  (2)  A Jew is also an individual'' [jüdischer Mischling] ''who is descended from two full-Jewish grandparents if:''
::''(a)  he was a member of the Jewish religious community when this law was issued, or joined the community later;''
::''(b)  when the law was issued, he was married to a person who was a Jew, or was subsequently married to a Jew;''
::''(c)  he is the issue from a marriage with a Jew, in the sense of Section I, which was contracted after the coming into effect of the [[Nuremberg Laws|Law for the Protection of German Blood and Honor of 15 September 1935]];''
::''(d)  he is the issue of an extramarital relationship with a Jew, in the sense of Section I, and was born out of wedlock after 31 July 1936.''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mtsu.edu/~baustin/nurmlaw2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of these is ''considered'' a Jew, hence the name ''Geltungsjude''. The term ''jüdischer [[Mischling]]'' in the first sentence means ''Jewish half-breed''. A person with two Jewish grandparents who satisfied none of the criteria (a) through (d) was not considered a "Geltungsjude" but a [[Mischling|Mischling of the First Degree]]. (See also the article on the [[Mischling test]].)

==Consequences==
''Geltungsjuden'' were not citizens of the [[Nazi Germany|Reich]] anymore and did not have the right to vote. They were also prohibited to marry a ''quarter Jew''. In the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|Protectorate]], they were routinely deported. They were sometimes deported from the "Old Reich" (Altreich), and only very rarely from Austria{{cn|date=March 2017}}.

In contrast, while Mischlinge of the First Degree within the Old Reich were subject to various forms of discrimination, they were at least in principle exempt from deportation. Their status as "provisional citizens" was subject of an intra-regime tug-of-war between maximalists like [[Heydrich]] (who wanted them treated like Jews) and minimalists who pleaded against "throwing  out the Aryan with the Jewish blood" (such as [[Wilhelm Stuckart]] and his assistant [[Hans Globke]]).

The '''Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999''' (GI Act) is a ''[[sui generis]]'' [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of India]] for protection of [[geographical indication]]s in India. India, as a member of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), enacted the Act to comply with the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]].&lt;ref name=darjeelingtea&gt;{{cite web|title=The Protection of Geographical Indication in India – Case Study on ‘Darjeeling Tea’|url=http://www.altacit.com/pdf/The%20Protection%20of%20Geographical%20Indication%20in%20India%20Case%20Study%20on%20Darjeeling%20Tea.pdf|publisher=Property Rights Alliance|accessdate=21 April 2013|author=Dr. Sudhir Ravindran|author2=Arya Mathew|format=PDF|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GI tag ensures that none other than those registered as authorised users (or at least those residing inside the geographic territory) are allowed to use the popular product name. [[Darjeeling tea]] became the first [[GI tag]]ged product in India, in 2004–05, since then 323 goods had been added to the list as of August 2018.

==Geographical indication==
{{Main|Geographical indication}}
According to section 2 (1)(e) of the Act, Geographical indication has been defined as "an indication which identifies such goods as agricultural goods, natural goods or manufactured goods as originating, or manufactured in the territory of a country, or a region or locality in that territory, where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of such goods is essentially attributable to its geographical origin and in case where such goods are manufactured goods one of the activities of either the production or of processing or preparation of the goods concerned takes place in such territory, region or locality, as the case may be."&lt;ref&gt;Section 1 (3)(e) of Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the registered geographical indications includes, agricultural goods like [[Darjeeling tea]], [[Malabar pepper|Malabar Pepper]], [[Bangalore Blue Grapes]], manufactured goods like [[Pochampalli Ikat]], [[Kancheepuram Silk]], solapuri chadars [[Bagh Print]]s, [[Madhubani paintings]] etc.&lt;ref name="journal"&gt;{{cite web|title=STATE WISE REGISTRATION DETAILS OF G.I APPLICATIONS 15th September, 2003 – 31st March, 2013|url=http://ipindia.nic.in/girindia/treasures_protected/registered_GI_31March2013.pdf|publisher=Geographical Indications Registry, Government of India|accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete list is available at [[List of Geographical Indications in India]].

==Registration process==
*An application for registration must be made before the Registrar of Geographical Indications by any association of persons or producers or any organization or authority established by or under any law for the time being in force representing the interest of the producers of the concerned goods.&lt;ref&gt;Section 11(1) of Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;
*The application must be made in an appropriate form containing the nature, quality, reputation or other characteristics of which are due exclusively or essentially to the geographical environment, manufacturing process, natural and human factors, map of territory of production, appearance of geographical indication (figurative or words), list of producers, along with prescribed fees.&lt;ref&gt;Section 11(2) of Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;
*The examiner will make a preliminary scrutiny for deficiencies, in case of deficiencies, the applicant have to remedy it within  a period of one month from the date of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Section 11(5) of Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Registrar may accept, partially accept or refuse the application. In case of refusal, the Registrar will give written grounds for non acceptance. The applicant must within two months file reply. In case of re-refusal, the applicant can make an appeal within one month of such decision.&lt;ref&gt;Section 11(6) &amp; 11(7) of Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;
*Registrar shall, within three months of acceptance may advertise the application in the GI Journal.&lt;ref&gt;Section 13 of Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;
*If there is no opposition, the Registrar will grant a certificate of registration to the applicant and authorised users.&lt;ref&gt;Section 16 of Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duration==
A GI is registered for an initial period of ten years, which may be renewed from time to time.&lt;ref&gt;Section 18 of Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1995
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exclusions==
Under Section 9 of the Act, the following indications cannot be registered:&lt;ref&gt;Section 9 of Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; 
*which would likely to deceive or cause confusion
* which would be contrary to any law for the time being in force; or
* which comprises or contains scandalous or obscene matter; or
* which comprise or contains any matter likely to hurt the religious susceptibilities of any class or section of the citizens of India; or
* which would otherwise be disentitled to protection in a court; or
* generic names 
*falsely represent to the persons that the goods originate in another territory, region or locality, as the case may be

==Effect of registration and infringement==
Registration of a GI gives its owner and the authorised users the exclusive right to use the indications on the good in which it is registered. Further, registration gives right to institution of suit against infringement and recovery of damages for such infringement.&lt;ref&gt;Section 21 of Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Infringement can be caused by use of the GI on such goods which indicates that such goods originate in such place other than its true place of origin or due to [[unfair competition]].&lt;ref&gt;Section 22 of Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; However, in case of non-registered GIs, a case of [[passing off]] can be instituted.&lt;ref&gt;Section 20(2) of Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Registration acts as a prima facie evidence of validity of the indication and ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Section 23 of Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The registration cannot be transferred, mortgaged, assigned or licensed, except in case of inheritance of the mark upon death of an authorised user.&lt;ref&gt;Section 24 of Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Any person who falsely applies or falsifies any geographical indication, tampers the origin of a  good, make or have in possession of dye, blocks, machines to use in falsification of GI may be punished shall not be less than six months but which may extend to three years and with fine which shall not be less than fifty thousand rupees but which may extend to two lakhs rupees.&lt;ref&gt;Section 39 of Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In case of second and for every subsequent offence, a person can be punished with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one year but which may extend to three years and with fine which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to two lakh rupees.&lt;ref name="sec41"&gt;Section 41 of Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; However, the judge may under certain condition may reduce the sentence, and reasons for reduction of punishment must be written in the judgment.&lt;ref name="sec41"/&gt; Other offences includes, falsely represent a GI to be registered, falsification of entries in register, falsely representing a place to be connected with GI Registry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16785">'''Green development''' is a real estate development concept that carefully considers social and environmental impacts of development. It is defined by three sub-categories: environmental responsiveness, resource efficiency, and community and cultural sensitivity. Environmental responsiveness respects the intrinsic value of nature, and minimizes damage to an ecosystem. Resource efficiency refers to the use of fewer resources to conserve energy and the environment. Community and cultural sensitivity recognizes the unique cultural values that each community hosts and carefully considers them in real estate development, unlike more discernable signs of sustainability, like [[solar energy]], (solar panels are more visibly "green" than the use of local materials). Green development manifests itself in various forms, however it is generally based on solution multipliers: features of a project that provide additional benefits, which ultimately reduce the projects' environmental impacts.&lt;ref name="RMI"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rocky Mountain Institute |title=Green Development: Integrating Ecology and Real Estate |date=1998 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=New York |isbn=9780471188780}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3-8}}

== History ==
Green development emerged as a result of the environmental movement in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Kline"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kline |first1=Benjamin |title=First Along the River: A Brief History of the U.S. Environmental Movement |date=2011 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the real estate industry, use of the term commenced in 1987 with a report from the [[Brundtland Commission|World Commission on Environment and Development]], entitled "Our Common Future". The report includes 16 principles of environmental management, designed to foster green development. It also discusses the traditional model of macroeconomic growth, and its disregard for environmental consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development: Our Common Future |date=1987 |publisher=WCED}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this initial movement, the real estate industry experienced a back-and-forth relationship with "green" methodologies; environmental issues often came second behind purely economic factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harris |first1=Jonathan |last2=Goodwin |first2=Neva |title=Reconciling Growth and the Environment |journal=Global Development and Environment Institute, Tufts University |date=March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incessant environmental concern and legislation affecting the real estate sector began to emerge, i.e. Green development.&lt;ref name="Kline"/&gt; However, a common concern of green development is that it may increase project costs and completion times. Hence there has been an ongoing argument of whether green strategies can be [[Sustainable development|sustainable]] as well as economically stimulating.&lt;ref name="Zotter"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zotter Jr. |first1=Frank |title=Legal Aspects of Real Estate |date=2016 |publisher=Ashley Crown Systems Inc. |location=Laguna Hills, CA |page=137 |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|137}} National environmental attention has since worked its way down to real estate developers, and become an increasing priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CBRE Surpasses 300 Leed-Certified Buildings |url=http://www.cbre.com/about/media-center/300-leed-certified-buildings |publisher=CBRE Group, Inc. |location=Los Angeles, CA |accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developers today must work within the parameters of legislation that now considers the environmental implications of development.&lt;ref name="Zotter"/&gt;{{rp|134}}

== Legislation ==
In response to increasing public concern regarding environmental issues, governments have enacted legislation that regulates various aspects of the real estate industry, as well as other sectors of the economy. In the United States such legislation includes the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA), the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], the [[Clean Water Act]], the [[Coastal Zone Management Act]], and the [[Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act]] (CERCLA; also known as "Superfund."). NEPA, enacted in 1970, changed how federal agencies made decisions because it required them to propose environmental analysis before starting a project. The Clean Air Act (1970) requires the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to set national standards for clean air and pollution control regulations. The Clean Water Act (1972) was designed to minimize pollution in natural bodies of water, and also to ensure water quality that protects [[drinking water]] sources and supports recreational activities such as fishing or swimming. The Coastal Zone Management Act (1972) manages the nation's coastal resources such as Great Lakes and estuaries. CERCLA is commonly referred to as "Superfund" because it comprises two trust funds that provide help to improve areas that have been polluted by hazardous waste. The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 allows the government to lien a property that is being cleaned up. Additionally, the [[California Environmental Quality Act]] (CEQA) is California's most comprehensive piece of legislation regarding the environment.  This act applies to all decisions made by cities and counties in California, and includes the mandate of an [[Environmental impact statement|Environmental Impact Report]] (EIR), to both public and private projects. Subsequently, any new real estate development is subject to a detailed environmental analysis before starting a project.&lt;ref name="Zotter"/&gt;{{rp|133–135}}

California's Senate Bill (SB) 375 (2008) is another piece of legislation that promotes green development. It aims to achieve California's climate goals via more efficient land use and development patterns. More specifically, [[Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act of 2008|SB 375]] seeks to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through close coordination between land-use and transportation. One way this is achieved is through demand-side measures. This strategy would decrease [[Traffic calming|driving]] demand, and therefore reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and ultimately reduce GHG emissions. For example, a demand-side policy component may include placing public transit stops near development, in order to maximize walkability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barbour |first1=Elisa |last2=Deakin |first2=Elizabeth |title=Smart Growth Planning for Climate Protection: Evaluating California's Senate Bill 375 |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, California state law requires minimum energy conservation levels for all new and/or existing development projects. The seller of a home is required to include information regarding energy conservation retrofitting and thermal insulation in the sales contract.&lt;ref name="Zotter"/&gt;{{rp|133}}

== In practice ==
=== Broad development patterns ===
Senate Bill 375 demonstrates an urban planning strategy called [[Smart growth|growth management]]. It is defined by a close coordination between land-use controls and capital investment and heavily motivated by environmental issues. It is defined by "the regulation of the amount, timing, location, and character of development."&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Levy |first1=John |title=Contemporary Urban Planning |date=2011 |publisher=Routledge |chapter=Growth Management, Smart Growth, and Sustainable Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the name may suggest, growth management may not imply limiting any growth. "Growth control" carries the connotation of managing or limiting growth, and "no growth" would indicate stopping growth all together. Moreover, Growth Management requires the cooperation of all three of these connotations.&lt;ref name="Levy"/&gt;

Urban Growth Boundaries (UBG's), are popular growth management strategies. They are designed to encourage growth within a given boundary and discourage it outside the boundary. The goal of the UGB is to promote dense development, in order to decrease urban sprawl.  This growth management technique ultimately seeks to revitalize central cities, and create vibrant, walk-able spaces for community development.&lt;ref name="Levy"/&gt;

These clustered development patterns are solution multipliers. Reducing demand for infrastructure can save money and resources. These multipliers can increase walkability, which fosters social interaction and community togetherness.&lt;ref name="RMI"/&gt;{{rp|5}}

=== Intelligent building ===
In the US, commercial and residential buildings are the highest consumers of electricity and [[HVAC]] systems comprise a large portion of this usage. In fact, the US Department of Energy projects that 70% of the electricity used in the US is from buildings. [[Building automation|Intelligent building]] methods such as occupancy detection systems, wireless sensor networks, and HVAC control systems aim to more efficient energy usage. A team of researchers at the University of San Diego, project that their smart building automation systems will save 10–15% in building energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Agarwal |first1=Yuvraj |last2=Balaji |first2=Bharathan |last3=Gupta |first3=Rajesh |last4=Lyles |first4=Jacob |last5=Wei |first5=Michael |last6=Weng |first6=Thomas |title=Occupancy-Driven Energy Management for Smart Building Automation |url=http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/1880000/1878433/p1-agarwal.pdf?ip=128.32.10.164&amp;id=1878433&amp;acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&amp;key=CA367851C7E3CE77%2E3158474DDFAA3F10%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&amp;CFID=692426707&amp;CFTOKEN=70191412&amp;__acm__=1478802161_2b8c437d09c8f14813b66c266db3d0ed |publisher=BuildSys |accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case studies ==
=== The Holly Street Village Apartments ===
The city of [[Pasadena, California]] has recently adopted a general plan based on seven guiding principles: community needs and quality of life, preservation of Pasadena's historic character, economic vitality, a healthy family community, lack of need for automobiles, promoted as a cultural, scientific, corporate, entertainment and educational center for the region, and community participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=City of Pasadena Comprehensive General Plan |url=http://ww2.cityofpasadena.net/planning/deptorg/commplng/GenPlan/pdf/LandUseElement_110804.pdf|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This project included environmental concern and social considerations in the process of construction. The Holly Street Village Apartments in Pasadena address several of the principles outlined in Pasadena's general plan. It incorporates mixed-use development with ground-floor retail center including a deli, a convenience store and an art gallery. Also, the Holly Street Village Apartments is located near a light rail station. The goal of these strategies is to reduce the demand for automobiles, and making it easier for people to use public transportation.&lt;ref name="RMI"/&gt;{{rp|80}}

=== Inn of the Anasazi ===
Zimmer Associates International, a real estate development firm, completed the Inn of the Anasazi in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] in 1991. Robert Zimmer (co-founder) and his partners, Steve Conger and Michael Fuller, set a goal to construct a building that would, "showcase energy- and resource-saving technologies, strengthen local community, offer first class elegance, and financially reward its participants."&lt;ref name="RMI"/&gt;{{rp|3}} The interior design of the hotel pays respect to the ancient Anasazi Indians, including locally crafted furniture, hand-made rugs, and Native American, Hispanic and cowboy wall art. The use of adobe on the exterior of the hotel includes the historic pueblo style. Also, Zimmer and his partners repurposed a steel-framed building that had previously been used in the 1960s as a juvenile detention center, instead of starting the project from the beginning. Other "green" characteristics of this Santa Fe hotel are skylights, energy-efficient lighting, and water-saving fixtures. Also, the Inn of the Anasazi stimulates the regional economy by purchasing locally grown organic food from Hispanic farmers. Lastly the Inn encourage that the staff participate in local nonprofit organizations and events that sponsor diverse local cultures. The Inn of the Anasazi integrates "social and environmental goals with financial considerations…"&lt;ref name="RMI"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

=== Taipei 101 ===
[[Taipei 101]], stylized as TAIPEI 101, is a {{convert|1667|ft|m}} tall skyscraper located in [[Taipei, Taiwan]] which has received [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification from the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] as the highest score in history. In this project, "TAIPEI" is an acronym for "technology," "art," "innovation," "people," "environment," and "identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TAIPEI 101 Receives LEED v4 Certification from U.S. Green Building Council as All-Time Top Scorer |url=http://www.taipei-101.com.tw/en/news-detail.aspx?cid=598|website=Taipei 101 |publisher=Taipei Financial Center Corp. |accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Hubert Keiber, CEO of Siemens Building Automation in Taipei, stresses energy efficiency on the grounds that energy is the single largest expense for commercial buildings. Since 2011, the Taipei 101 has become the world's most environmentally responsible skyscraper, reducing water use, energy use, and carbon emissions all by 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Keiber |first1=Hubert |title=Taipei 101: Responsibility in Counteracting Global Warming |url=https://www.downloads.siemens.com/download-center/Download.aspx?pos=download&amp;fct=getasset&amp;id1=A6V10343478 |publisher=Siemens AG |location=Taipei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Boulder, Colorado ===
Growth management/limitation (discussed previously) manifests itself in [[Boulder, Colorado]]. The city of Boulder very tightly restricts housing development by limiting housing permits to 400 per year, which is 1 percent of the city's total housing stock. Additionally, the city has purchased land outside of the city limits, designated for permanent, green open space. This 400-unit cap seriously hinders population growth in the city.

This shortage of housing has several repercussions. First, it increases housing prices. Also, because Boulder restricts housing development more than it does commercial development, the number of available workers in Boulder grows faster than the housing stock.  This results in many workers who commute from beyond the city limits.&lt;ref name="Levy"/&gt;

== Controversy ==
A common critique of green development is that it negatively affects the way real estate developers do business, as it can increase cost and create delay.&lt;ref name="Zotter"/&gt;{{rp|137}} For example, becoming LEED-certified can contribute to additional costs. This includes additional building design and construction fees, interior design and construction fees, building operations and maintenance fees, neighborhood development fees, home and campus fees, and volume program fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LEED Certification Fees |url=http://www.usgbc.org/cert-guide/fees |publisher=US Green Building Council |location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, green development has been critiqued on a residential level. High-performance homes have proven to save energy in the long run, but they rapidly increase up-front capital costs, via tankless water heaters, radiant barriers and reflective insulation systems, and high efficiency air conditioning systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Widder |first1=SH |last2=Kora |first2=AR |last3=Baechler |first3=MC |last4=Fonorow |first4=KD |last5=Jenkins |first5=DW |last6=Stoer |first6=DJ |title=Transitioning to High-Performance Homes: Successes and Lessons Learned From Seven Builders |publisher=US Department of Energy |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, developers are often unable to develop on certain portions of land due to conservation [[easement]]s. These easements are purchased by governments or non-governmental organizations, in order to "preserve land in its natural, scenic, agricultural, historical, forested, or open-space condition."&lt;ref name="Zotter"/&gt;{{rp|132}}

'''Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area''', 1992 (Helsinki Convention) is an international convention encompassing various measures for the prevention and elimination of pollution of the [[Baltic Sea]].

== History ==
The first Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area was signed by [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[West Germany]], [[East Germany]], [[Poland]], [[USSR]] and [[Sweden]] in 1974 and entered into force on 3 May 1980.
A new convention was signed in 1992 by [[Czechoslovakia]], Denmark, [[Estonia]], the [[European Community]], Finland, [[Germany]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], Poland, [[Russia]] and Sweden. The Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area, 1992, entered into force on 17 January 2000.

== Summary of Provisions ==
The States-Parties to the Convention agreed individually or jointly to take all appropriate legislative, administrative or other relevant measures to prevent and eliminate pollution in order to promote the ecological restoration of the Baltic Sea Area and the preservation of its ecological balance.&lt;ref&gt;Article 3 of the Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area, 1992 [http://www.helcom.fi/Convention/en_GB/convention]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Parties undertake to apply:&lt;ref&gt;M. Fitzmaurice. The new Helsinki Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area. Marine pollution bulletin, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Precautionary principle]], that is, to take preventive measures when there is reason to assume that substances or energy introduced, directly or indirectly, into the marine environment may create hazards to human health, harm living resources and marine ecosystems, damage amenities or interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea;
*Best Environmental Practice and [[Best Available Technology]] (criteria set out in Annex II);
*[[Polluter pays principle]], that is, make the party responsible for producing pollution responsible for paying for the damage done to the environment.

The aim of the States-Parties to the Convention is to prevent and eliminate pollution of the marine environment of the Baltic Sea Area caused by harmful substances&lt;ref&gt;The definition and list of harmful substances are set out in Annex I to the Convention&lt;/ref&gt; from all sources, including:

* from land-based sources (measures set out in Annex III);
* from ships (measures outlined in Annex IV);
* from incineration and dumping (exemptions from dumping provisions set out in Annex V); 
* from exploration and exploitation on the seabed (measures related to the offshore exploration and exploration activities set out in Annex VI).&lt;ref&gt;Articles 6, 8, 10-12 of the Convention&lt;/ref&gt;

The States-Parties to the Convention are obligated to notify and enter into consultations with each other when an [[environmental impact assessment]] of a proposed activity is likely to cause a significant adverse impact on the marine environment of the Baltic Sea Area.

'''IDA Indoor''' '''Climate and''' '''Energy''' (IDA ICE) is a [[Building performance simulation]] (BPS) software. IDA ICE is a simulation application for the multi-zonal and dynamic study of indoor climate phenomenas as well as energy use. The implemented models are [[state of the art]], many studies show that simulation results and measured data compare well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cornaro|first=Cristina|last2=Puggioni|first2=Valerio Adoo|last3=Strollo|first3=Rodolfo Maria|title=Dynamic simulation and on-site measurements for energy retrofit of complex historic buildings: Villa Mondragone case study|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2016.02.001|journal=Journal of Building Engineering|volume=6|pages=17–28|doi=10.1016/j.jobe.2016.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christensen|first=Jørgen Erik|last2=Chasapis|first2=Kleanthis|last3=Gazovic|first3=Libor|last4=Kolarik|first4=Jakub|title=Indoor Environment and Energy Consumption Optimization Using Field Measurements and Building Energy Simulation|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1876610215020135|journal=Energy Procedia|volume=78|pages=2118–2123|doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2015.11.281}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nageler|first=P.|last2=Schweiger|first2=G.|last3=Pichler|first3=M.|last4=Brandl|first4=D.|last5=Mach|first5=T.|last6=Heimrath|first6=R.|last7=Schranzhofer|first7=H.|last8=Hochenauer|first8=C.|title=Validation of dynamic building energy simulation tools based on a real test-box with thermally activated building systems (TABS)|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.03.025|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=168|pages=42–55|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.03.025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== User interface ==
The user interface of IDA ICE makes it easy to create simple cases but also offers the flexibility to go into detail of advanced studies. Many inputs are adaptable to local requirements such as climate data, material data, system components or result reports. IDA ICE provides a [[3D modeling|3D]] environment for geometry modeling, the table-based input of boundary conditions provide good visual feedback and enables efficient quality check. A simple procedure for calculating and reporting cooling, heating, air demand, and energy, together with a built-in version handling system, makes it efficient to compare different systems and results. 

Advanced daylight calculation are achieved by interfacing the [[Radiance (software)|Radiance]] lighting simulation tool with result visualization in the 3D environment. A module for Appendix G of [[ASHRAE 90.1]]-2010 is available, this is used for example in [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] and [[BREEAM]]. The integrated [[Radiosity (computer graphics)|radiosity method]] with single reflexion and one measuring point can be used for whole-year daylight analysis and allows modeling daylight-based control strategies (e.g. shading devices, artificial lightening).

There is also the "Early Stage Building Optimization" (ESBO)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.equa.se/en/esbo|title=ESBO user interface|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=EQUA Simulation AB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; user interface which makes it possible for users to experiment with variations in both buildings and systems at an early stage with a minimum of user input. A full range of component models for [[renewable energy]] studies is available, with boreholes, stratified tanks, heat pumps, solar collectors, [[Cogeneration|CHP]], [[Photovoltaics|PV]], [[Wind turbine|wind turbines]], etc.

An interface with [[OpenFOAM]] for detailed [[CFD in buildings|CFD]] studies is in development.

== Strengths ==
IDA ICE can be used for complete energy and design studies, involving the envelope, systems, plant and control strategies. The equation-based approach enables solving more complex mathematical problems than software using [[Imperative programming|imperative programming languages]]. The IDA ICE model library is [[Open-source software|open source]], the model equations can be viewed and adapted, every variable in the whole system can be logged. The flexible architecture of the software makes it easy to develop the software continuously to adapt it to local requirements and languages, and to expand it with new capabilities. Additional features like parametric simulation runs and [[Visual programming language|visual scripting]] support decision making in a [[parametric design]] process. The coupling with optimization engines like [https://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/GO/ GenOpt]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/GO/|title=GenOpt project website|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; is available directly in the program.

The big advantage compared to other BPS software is the coupled simulation of building envelope, systems and controls. IDA ICE library components are either written in the [[Neutral Model Format]] (NMF) or [[Modelica]].&lt;ref&gt;Sahlin, P. and Sowell, E.F. (1989). A neutral format for building simulation models, Proceedings of the Second International IBPSA Conference, Vancouver, BC, Canada, pp. 147-154, http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS1989/BS89_147_154.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The software is fully scriptable with [[Common Lisp|Common LISP]]. The IDA general purpose solver comes with a variable timestep, which guarantees that no event in the system will be missed.

== Input ==
IDA ICE supports [[Industry Foundation Classes|IFC]] [[Building information modeling|BIM]] models generated by tools such as [[ArchiCAD]], [[Revit]], MagiCAD, and others. Geometry an shading on site can also be imported from [[SketchUp]], [[Rhinoceros 3D|Rhino]] or other geometry tools. Solar influx is evaluated through windows (also internal) with full 3D accounting for the local shading situation. Additionally it has an integrated geometry editor where building and zone geometry can be modeled with 2D architectural drawings or pictures serving as template.

Climate files like EnergyPlus weather files (EPW) or ASHRAE climate files, can be downloaded and installed. The table-based input structure allows full interoperability with [[Microsoft Excel|MS Excel]] and comparable software. Modern features like [[Cut, copy, and paste|copy and paste]] and [[Drag&amp;drop]] combined with visual input data check make input data management easier.

== Output ==
IDA ICE output include tables, charts, reports and plots. 3D visualizations (both stills and animations) show geometry, solar shadings, color coded input data as well as results. Arrow animations in 3D visualize ventilation air flows, window energy balance, and wind driven flows. There are special reports for [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] submittal forms included. The diagram plots deliver [[vector graphics]] which allows detailed result analysis in custom reports. Results can be exported to [[Microsoft Word]] or Excel. A single zone IDA ICE model with default systems comprises a total of approximately 2 000 time dependent variables, any of which may be plotted.

Predfined output files and reports cover
* '''Zone heat and energy balances:''' solar radiation, occupants, equipment, lights, mechanical ventilation, heating and cooling devices, air leakage, heat bridge losses and surface transmission
* '''Control signals:''' window opening and shading, signals for secondary and primary systems
* '''Building occupancy:''' for each zone or the whole building
* '''Heat and mass transfer:''' detailed heat fluxes of surfaces and air streams
* '''Indoor air quality:''' CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-content of indoor air and moisture levels, air change rate
* '''Comfort indices:''' operative temperature, surface temperatures, [[Thermal comfort#PMV.2FPPD method|PPD and PMV]], unmet load hours, EN15251 comfort results and daylight availability
* '''Energy demand:''' total energy separated by application, including energy costs based on time-dependent prices, primary energy results and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission

"Authorization" and "[[Secondary infringement|Secondary Infringement]]" are two instances of "indirect infringement" in [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Copyright law]]. In cases of indirect infringement, individuals can be held liable for [[Copyright infringement|infringement]] even where they did not personally make the copies of the copyrighted subject-matter.&lt;ref name="David Vaver 2011"&gt;David Vaver, Intellectual Property Law: Copyright Patents Trade-Marks, 2d ed (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2011) at 176.&lt;/ref&gt; This expands the scope of liability. The Canadian courts have dealt with these concepts in a number of cases, several of which will be elaborated upon below.

==Authorization==
A [[copyright]] owner has the right to authorize any of the acts found in S. 3(1) of the [[Copyright Act of Canada|Copyright Act]] [see below]. Anyone who grants, or purports to grant, the right to reproduce or perform a work has authorized it. He is liable for copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;David Vaver, Intellectual Property Law: Copyright Patents Trade-Marks, 2d ed (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2011) at 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Related Provisions in the Canadian Copyright Act===
S. 27(1): Infringement Generally: It is an infringement of copyright for any person to do, without the consent of the owner of the copyright, anything that by this Act only the owner of the copyright has the right to do.&lt;ref&gt;Copyright Act, RS 1985, c C-42, s 27(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

S. 3. (1): For the purposes of this Act, "copyright", in relation to a work, means the sole right to produce or reproduce the work or any substantial part thereof in any material form whatever, to perform the work or any substantial part thereof in public or, if the work is unpublished, to publish the work or any substantial part thereof, and includes the sole right

(a) to produce, reproduce, perform or publish any [[translation]] of the work,

(b) in the case of a dramatic work, to convert it into a [[novel]] or other non-dramatic work,

(c) in the case of a novel or other non-dramatic work, or of an artistic work, to convert it into a dramatic work, by way of performance in public or otherwise,

(d) in the case of a literary, dramatic or musical work, to make any sound recording, cinematograph film or other contrivance by means of which the work may be mechanically reproduced or performed,

(e) in the case of any literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, to reproduce, adapt and publicly present the work as a cinematographic work,

(f) in the case of any literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, to communicate the work to the public by [[telecommunication]],

(g) to present at a public exhibition, for a purpose other than sale or hire, an artistic work created after June 7, 1988, other than a map, chart or plan,

(h) in the case of a [[computer program]] that can be reproduced in the ordinary course of its use, other than by a reproduction during its execution in conjunction with a machine, device or computer, to rent out the computer program, and

(i) in the case of a musical work, to rent out a sound recording in which the work is embodied,

and to authorize any such acts &lt;ref&gt;Copyright Act, RS 1985, c C-42, s 3(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supreme Court Definition of "Authorization": CCH v LSUC &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;CCCH Canadian Limited v. The Law Society of Upper Canada, 2008 SCJ 12 at para 4.&lt;/ref&gt;===
The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] defines and discusses the definition of "authorization" in a 2004 case, [[CCH Canadian Ltd. v. Law Society of Upper Canada]]. In this case, the LSUC, which maintains and operates the Great Library at [[Osgoode Hall]], engaged in two relevant behaviours.
* It made photocopies of CCH’s copyrighted law reports for library members
* It provided self-service [[photocopy]] machines for use by library members

The relevant issue for the court with regard to "authorization" is whether the Law Society authorized copyright infringement by maintaining self-service photocopy machines, allowing members to illegally photocopy copyrighted material.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The court found that it did not.&lt;ref&gt;CCCH Canadian Limited v. The Law Society of Upper Canada, 2008 SCJ 12 at paras 41-46.&lt;/ref&gt; In the court’s analysis, it concluded that "authorization" in Canadian Copyright law has the following characteristics:

# The definition of "authorize" is to "sanction, approve, countenance."&lt;ref name=test&gt;CCCH Canadian Limited v. The Law Society of Upper Canada, 2008 SCJ 12 at para 38.&lt;/ref&gt;
# "Countenance" in the context of authorizing copyright infringement, must be understood in the strongest dictionary meaning, namely "give approval to, sanction, permit, favour, encourage." &lt;ref name="test" /&gt;
# Authorization is a question of fact that depends on the circumstances of each particular case and can be inferred from acts that are less than direct and positive, including a sufficient degree of indifference. (For example, if there is a sufficient degree of control, passivity may be taken as authorization).&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;
# A person does not authorize infringement by authorizing the mere use of equipment [such as services and technologies that have a dual use (one which is infringing and one which is not, i.e. photocopier) that could be used to infringe copyright].&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;
# Courts should presume that a person who authorizes an activity does so only so far as it is in accordance with the law. That is, there is a presumption that there is no knowledge of the infringing activity of potential primary infringers. Moreover, knowledge is not enough to attach liability. There must also be some legal capacity to control the activity of the primary infringer. Thus, the presumption can be rebutted if it is shown that a certain relationship or degree of control existed between the alleged authorizer and the persons who committed the copyright infringement.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;

However, some aspects of authorization remain unclear. While "authorization" is considered a primary infringement (rather than secondary infringement, which will be discussed later), it is not clear whether liability for authorizing infringement requires that actual infringement has taken place. According to Vaver, an expert in the field, actual infringement is required.&lt;ref name="David Vaver 2011"/&gt; According to [[University of Toronto]] Law Professor, Ariel Katz, the decision in CCH is policy driven: preventing photocopying in libraries would shift the balance of copyright too far in favour of owner’s rights, and unnecessarily interfere with the proper use of copyrighted works for the good of society as a whole.

===Authorization and Peer-to-Peer Networks: BMG Canada v John Doe &lt;ref&gt;BMG Canada Inc v John Doe 2004 FC 488, [2004] 3 FCR 241.&lt;/ref&gt;===
[[BMG Canada Inc. v. John Doe|BMG]] was an attempt by the record companies to sue individuals for copyright infringement of their songs. The court said that, according to S. 80(1) &lt;ref&gt;Copyright Act, RS 1985, c C-42, s 80(1).&lt;/ref&gt; of the Copyright Act, making a personal copy of a sound recording for one's own private purposes is not infringement.&lt;ref&gt;BMG Canada Inc v John Doe 2004 FC 488, [2004] 3 FCR 241 at para 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The record companies went further, suggesting that the individuals were involved in authorization of copyright infringement, since they were members of a peer (shared) network. The court disagreed, and suggested that there is no difference between making personal copies and making a shared folder. The court uses an analogy: there is no difference between a library full of copyrighted materials with a self-service photocopier, per CCH, and making a shared folder on the [[Internet]]. Therefore, the mere fact of placing a copy on a shared directory in a computer where that copy can be accessed via a peer-to-peer service does not amount to distribution, and hence authorization.&lt;ref&gt;BMG Canada Inc v John Doe 2004 FC 488, [2004] 3 FCR 241 at para 27.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the case, "before it constitutes distribution, there must be a positive act by the owner of the shared directory, such as sending out the copies or advertising that they are available for copying." &lt;ref&gt;BMG Canada Inc v John Doe 2004 FC 488, [2004] 3 FCR 241 at para 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Some experts, such as University of Toronto Law Professor Ariel Katz, suggest that the analogy to CCH is flawed, since [[library]] use is far more constrained and requires higher transaction costs than does Internet use.

==Secondary Infringement==
A person is a secondary infringer where he knows or should have known that a work either a) infringes a copyright or, b) would infringe a copyright had it been made in Canada (hypothetical infringement test) and, without the consent of the copyright owner he does anything set out in S. 27(2) of the Copyright Act [see below]. If a person turns a blind eye or honestly but mistakenly believes the goods are non-infringing, he will still be presumed to have the requisite knowledge. There can only be secondary infringement if there has been a primary infringement.&lt;ref&gt;David Vaver, Intellectual Property Law: Copyright Patents Trade-Marks, 2d ed (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2011) at 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Related Provisions in the Canadian Copyright Act===
S. 27(2) It is an infringement of copyright for any person to

(a) sell or rent out,

(b) distribute to such an extent as to affect prejudicially the owner of the copyright,

(c) by way of trade distribute, expose or offer for sale or rental, or exhibit in public,

(d) possess for the purpose of doing anything referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c), or

(e) import into Canada for the purpose of doing anything referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c),

a copy of a work, sound recording or fixation of a performer’s performance or of a communication signal that the person knows or should have known infringes copyright or would infringe copyright if it had been made in Canada by the person who made it.&lt;ref&gt;Copyright Act, RS 1985, c C-42, s 27(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

===CCH on Secondary Infringement===
According to CCH, S. 27(2) requires 3 things:
# copy must be the product of primary infringement
# secondary infringer must have known or should have known that he is dealing with a product of infringement
# secondary dealing must be established (must have been a sale)

===The Supreme Court of Canada on Secondary Infringement: Euro-Excellence v Kraft Canada&lt;ref&gt;Euro-Excellence Inc v Kraft Canada Inc, 2007 SCC 37, [2007] 3 SCR 20.&lt;/ref&gt;===
[[Euro-Excellence Inc. v. Kraft Canada Inc.]] involves the plaintiff, [[Kraft Canada]], who sues the defendant, Euro-Excellence, for importing chocolate bars with a copyrighted logo into Canada for the purpose of sale and distribution ([[parallel import]]ation). Parallel importation takes place where a product is imported from abroad to be sold locally.&lt;ref&gt;David Vaver, Intellectual Property Law: Copyright Patents Trade-Marks, 2d ed (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2011) at 191.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue is whether parallel importation is secondary infringement pursuant to s. 27(2)(e).

The case is composed of four distinct judgments:&lt;ref&gt;Drassinower, Abraham, "The Art of Selling Chocolate: Remarks on Copyright's Domain," in Michael Geist ed, "Radical Extremism" to "Balanced Copyright" (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc, 2010) at 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Justice Rothstein (Majority): (writing for himself, Justice Binnie and Deschamps JJ): Pursuant to s. 27(2)(e), parallel importation is secondary infringement where the parallel importer is an assignee. Where the parallel importation is merely an [[exclusive license]]e (like Euro-Excellence in this case), however, the act of parallel importation is not secondary infringement.&lt;ref&gt;Drassinower, Abraham, "The Art of Selling Chocolate: Remarks on Copyright's Domain," in Michael Geist ed, "Radical Extremism" to "Balanced Copyright" (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc, 2010) at 126.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Justice Fish: Concurs with Justice Rothstein with respect to the exclusive licensee issue, but does not necessarily agree than [[Legal liability|liability]] would have attached to the parallel importer had the copyright holder been an assignee. His concern is that the Act was not meant to be an instrument of trade control to such an extent.&lt;ref name="Drassinower, Abraham 2010"&gt;Drassinower, Abraham, "The Art of Selling Chocolate: Remarks on Copyright's Domain," in Michael Geist ed, "Radical Extremism" to "Balanced Copyright" (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc, 2010) at 127.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Justice Abella (dissent): (writing for herself and Justice McLachlin): The Act does make parallel importation an infringement even where the copyright owner is an exclusive licensee.&lt;ref name="Drassinower, Abraham 2010"/&gt;
# Justice Bastarache: Finds that a copyrighted logo should not prevent the sale/trade of a non-copyrighted chocolate bar. Section 27(2)(e) covers only copyrighted materials and not merely ancillary attachments to the products.&lt;ref name="Drassinower, Abraham 2010"/&gt;

With four judgments, it is hard to grasp where the law lies. According to Vaver, the case stands for the following: that an exclusive licensee cannot sue the importer of non-copyrighted materials (i.e. the chocolate bars) based on the incidental copyrighted subject matter associated with it (i.e. the wrappers).&lt;ref&gt;David Vaver, Intellectual Property Law: Copyright Patents Trade-Marks, 2d ed (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2011) at 194-195.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, if the copyright had been assigned to Kraft Canada (rather than exclusively licensed), parallel importation of a genuinely copyrighted product (rather than the incidental copyright of the chocolate wrapper) would be an infringement according to S. 27(2)(e). Therefore, parallel importation of copyright materials is an infringement according to S. 27(2)(e) where the copyright owner is an assignee.

===Critical Analysis: Does S. 27(2)(e) Really Cover Parallel Importation?===
According to intellectual property expert and professor, Ariel Katz, S. 27(2)(e) is not meant to prevent parallel importation and the resulting market arbitrage. Rather, its purpose is to prevent [[regulatory arbitrage]] (protecting the integrity of Canada’s regulatory sovereignty). Section 3 of the Copyright Act does not give a general distribution right; it only gives the right to make copies and publish a work if it is unpublished. This means that a copyright owner does not have the right to prevent parallel importation if he owns the copyright in both countries, since he does not have the general right to distribute (so cannot exclude others). Thus, he should not be able to prevent parallel importation merely by assigning his copyright. He cannot assign a right that did not exist in the first place. Moreover, Canadian law does not prevent [[parallel trade]] domestically (that is, between provinces), so there is no reason to prevent it internationally.

'''Insubordination''' is the act of willfully [[obedience (human behavior)|disobeying]] an order of one's superior. Refusing to perform an action that is unethical or illegal is not insubordination; neither is refusing to perform an action that is not within the scope of authority of the person issuing the order.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Insubordination is generally a punishable offense in [[hierarchical organization]]s which depend on people lower in the [[Command hierarchy|chain of command]] doing what they are expected to do.

[[File:Partisan youth execution.jpg|thumb|200px|Sixteen blindfolded partisan youth await execution by German forces in Serbia, August 1941. Allegedly, German soldier [[Josef Schulz]] refused to take part in the action and was executed along with the youth.]]
Insubordination is when a serviceman or servicewoman willfully disobeys the lawful orders of a superior [[officer]]. If a [[military officer]] were to disobey the lawful orders of their [[civilian]] superiors, this would also count. For example, the [[head of state]] in many countries, is also the most superior officer of the military as the [[Commander in Chief]]. (see [[Civilian control of the military]])&lt;ref&gt;usmilitary.about.com. [http://usmilitary.about.com/od/punitivearticles/a/mcm90.htm Article 90—Assaulting or willfully disobeying superior commissioned officer].

Accessed December 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, an officer or soldier may be insubordinate to the point of mutiny if given an unlawful order, however. (see [[Nuremberg defense]])

In the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]], insubordination is covered under Article 91 of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;usmilitary.about.com.[http://usmilitary.about.com/od/punitivearticles/a/mcm91.htm Article 91—Insubordinate conduct toward warrant officer, NCO, or PO]. Accessed November 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It covers disobeying lawful orders as well as disrespectful language or even striking a superior. The article for insubordination should not be confused with the article for contempt. While Article 91 of the UCMJ deals predominately with disobeying or disrespecting a superior and applies to [[Enlisted rank#United States Armed Forces|enlisted]] members and [[Warrant officer (United States)|warrant officers]], Article 88 involves the use of [[contempt]]uous words against certain appointed or elected officials and only applies to [[Officer (armed forces)#United States|commissioned officers]].&lt;ref&gt;usmilitary.about.com.[http://usmilitary.about.com/od/punitivearticles/a/mcm88.htm Article 88—Contempt toward officials]. Accessed December 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private Sector==
Other types of hierarchical structures, especially corporations, may use insubordination as a reason for [[Termination of employment|dismissal]] or [[censure]] of an employee.

There have been court cases in the [[United States]] which have involved charges of insubordination from the employer with counter charges of infringement of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights from the employee. A number of these cases have reached the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] usually involving a conflict between an institution of [[higher education]] and a [[Faculty (university)|faculty]] member.&lt;ref&gt;Imber, Michael and Tyll Van Geel (2001).

Google Book Search. Retrieved on December 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]] in the [[Western world]], hierarchical power relationships are usually sufficiently internalized so that the issue of formal charges of insubordination are rare. In his book ''[[Disciplined Minds]]'', American physicist and writer Jeff Schmidt points out that professionals are trusted to run organizations in the interests of their employers. Because employers cannot be on hand to manage every decision, professionals are trained "to make sure that the subtext of each and every detail of their work advances the right interests—or skewers the disfavored ones" in the absence of overt control.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Jeff (2001).

==Examples==
There have been a number of famous and notorious people who have committed insubordination or publicly objected to an organizational practice.
* [[Stanislav Petrov]] – Russian army officer who refused to report a detected missile strike averting nuclear war. 
* [[George Grosz]] – artist and soldier in the German army.
* [[Desmond Hume|Desmond Hume (fictional character)]] – dishonorably discharged (and imprisoned) from the Royal Scots Regiment of the British Army.
* [[Douglas MacArthur]] – United States General relieved of command by President [[Harry S. Truman]] during the [[Korean War]].
* [[Billy Mitchell]] – famous [[aviator]], United States Army Air Corps commander during [[World War I]] and proponent of [[air power]] during the interwar years.
* [[Albert Pike]] – charged by the [[Confederate Army]] with insubordination.
* [[Jackie Robinson]] – American [[baseball]] player accused of insubordination while in the military, but exonerated at a [[court martial]].
* [[Daniel V. Gallery]] – United States Navy admiral whose published articles played a role in the public debate during the [[Revolt of the Admirals]]

{{Intellectual property}}
Layout designs (topographies) of [[integrated circuit]]s are a field in the protection of [[intellectual property]].

In [[United States]] intellectual property law, a "mask work" is a two or three-dimensional layout or topography of an [[integrated circuit]] (IC or "chip"), i.e. the arrangement on a chip of [[semiconductor devices]] such as [[transistor]]s and passive [[electronics|electronic]] components such as [[resistor]]s and interconnections. The layout is called a ''mask'' work because, in [[photolithography|photolithographic]] processes, the multiple etched layers within actual ICs are each created using a mask, called the [[photomask]], to permit or block the light at specific locations, sometimes for hundreds of chips on a [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]] simultaneously.

Because of the functional nature of the mask geometry, the designs cannot be effectively protected under [[copyright]] law (except perhaps as decorative art). Similarly, because individual lithographic mask works are not clearly protectable subject matter, they also cannot be effectively protected under [[patent]] law, although any processes implemented in the work may be patentable. So since the 1990s, national governments have been granting copyright-like exclusive rights conferring time-limited exclusivity to reproduction of a particular layout. Term of integrated circuit rights are usually shorter than copyrights applicable on pictures.

== International law ==

A diplomatic conference was held at [[Washington, D.C.]], in 1989, which adopted a [[Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits]], also called the Washington Treaty or IPIC Treaty. The Treaty, signed at Washington on May 26, 1989, is open to States Members of [[WIPO]] or the [[United Nations]] and to intergovernmental organizations meeting certain criteria. The Treaty has been incorporated by reference into the [[TRIPS Agreement]] of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), subject to the following modifications: the term of protection is at least 10 (rather than eight) years from the date of filing an application or of the first commercial exploitation in the world, but Members may provide a term of protection of 15 years from the creation of the layout-design; the exclusive right of the right-holder extends also to articles incorporating integrated circuits in which a protected layout-design is incorporated, in so far as it continues to contain an unlawfully reproduced layout-design; the circumstances in which layout-designs may be used without the consent of right-holders are more restricted; certain acts engaged in unknowingly will not constitute infringement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wto.int/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_04c_e.htm#6 TRIPS Articles]&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPIC Treaty is currently not in force, but was partially integrated into the TRIPS agreement.

Article 35 of TRIPS in Relation to the IPIC Treaty states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Members agree to provide protection to the layout-designs (topographies) of integrated circuits (referred to in this Agreement as "layout-designs") in accordance with Articles 2 through 7 (other than paragraph 3 of Article 6), Article 12 and paragraph 3 of Article 16 of the Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits and, in addition, to comply with the following provisions.[http://www.wto.int/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_04c_e.htm#6 TRIPS Document]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Article 2 of the IPIC Treaty gives the following definitions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(i) 'integrated circuit' means a product, in its final form or an intermediate form, in which the elements, at least one of which is an active element, and some or all of the inter-connections are integrally formed in and/or on a piece of material and which is intended to perform an electronic function,

(ii) 'layout-design (topography)' means the three-dimensional disposition, however expressed, of the elements, at least one of which is an active element, and of some or all of the interconnections of an integrated circuit, or such a three-dimensional disposition prepared for an integrated circuit intended for manufacture ...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under the IPIC Treaty, each Contracting Party is obliged to secure, throughout its territory, exclusive rights in layout-designs (topographies) of integrated circuits, whether or not the integrated circuit concerned is incorporated in an article. Such obligation applies to layout-designs that are original in the sense that they are the result of their creators' own intellectual effort and are not commonplace among creators of layout designs and manufacturers of integrated circuits at the time of their creation.

The Contracting Parties must, as a minimum, consider the following acts to be unlawful if performed without the authorization of the holder of the right: the reproduction of the lay-out design, and the importation, sale or other distribution for commercial purposes of the layout-design or an integrated circuit in which the layout-design is incorporated. However, certain acts may be freely performed for private purposes or for the sole purpose of evaluation, analysis, research or teaching.

== National laws ==

=== United States ===

The United States Code (USC) defines a mask work as "a series of related images, however fixed or encoded, having or representing the predetermined, three-dimensional pattern of metallic, insulating, or semiconductor material present or removed from the layers of a semiconductor chip product, and in which the relation of the images to one another is such that each image has the pattern of the surface of one form of the semiconductor chip product" [(17 U.S.C. § 901(a)(2))]. Mask work exclusive rights were first granted in the US by the [[Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984]].

According to {{UnitedStatesCode|17|904}}, rights in semiconductor mask works last 10 years. This contrasts with a [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act|term of 95 years]] for modern copyrighted works with a corporate authorship; alleged infringement of mask work rights are also not protected by a statutory [[fair use]] defense, nor by the typical [[backup]] copy exemptions that {{UnitedStatesCode|17|117}} provides for [[computer software]]. Nevertheless, as fair use in copyrighted works was originally recognized by the judiciary over a century before being codified in the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], it is possible that the courts might likewise find a similar defense applies to mask work.

The non-obligatory symbol used in a mask work protection notice is Ⓜ ([[M]] enclosed in a circle; [[Unicode]] code point &lt;code&gt;U+24C2&lt;/code&gt; or [[Unicode and HTML|HTML numeric character entity]] &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#9410;&lt;/code&gt;) or *M*.

The exclusive rights in a mask work are somewhat like those of [[copyright]]: the right to reproduce the mask work or (initially) distribute an IC made using the mask work. Like the [[first sale doctrine]], a lawful owner of an authorized IC containing a mask work may freely import, distribute or use, but not reproduce the chip (or the mask). Mask work protection is characterized as a ''[[sui generis]]'' right, i.e., one created to protect specific rights where other (more general) laws were inadequate or inappropriate.

Note that the exclusive rights granted to mask work owners are more limited than those granted to copyright or patent holders. For instance, modification (derivative works) is not an exclusive right of mask work owners. Similarly, the exclusive right of a patentee to "use" an invention would not prohibit an independently created mask work of identical geometry. Furthermore, reproduction for [[reverse engineering]] of a mask work is specifically permitted by the law. As with copyright, mask work rights exist when they are created, regardless of registration, unlike patents, which only confer rights after application, examination and issuance.

Mask work rights have more in common with copyrights than with other [[exclusive right]]s such as [[patent]]s or [[trademark]]s. On the other hand, they are used alongside copyright to protect a [[read-only memory]] (ROM) component that is encoded to contain computer software.

The publisher of software for a cartridge-based [[video game console]] may seek simultaneous protection of its property under several legal constructs:

* A trademark registration on the game's title and possibly other marks such as fanciful names of worlds and characters used in the game (e.g., PAC-MAN®);
* A copyright registration on the program as a literary work or on the audiovisual displays generated by the work; and
* A mask work registration on the ROM that contains the binary.

Ordinary copyright law applies to the underlying software (source, binary) and original characters and art.
But the expiration date for the term of ''additional'' exclusive rights in a work distributed in the form of a mask ROM would depend on an {{as of|2010|alt=as yet}} untested interpretation of the originality requirement of § 902(b):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(b) Protection under this chapter (i.e., as a mask work) shall not be available for a mask work that—
:(1) is not original; or
:(2) consists of designs that are staple, commonplace, or familiar in the semiconductor industry, or variations of such designs, combined in a way that, considered as a whole, is not original
({{UnitedStatesCode|17|902}}, {{As of|2010|11|lc=y}}).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under one interpretation, a mask work containing a given game title is either entirely unoriginal, as mask ROM in general is likely a familiar design, or a minor variation of the mask work for any of the [[launch title|first titles released for the console]] in the region.

=== Other countries ===

Equivalent legislation exists in [[Australia]], [[India]] and [[Hong Kong]].

Australian law refers to mask works as "eligible layouts" or ELs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|584|1992|litigants=Re Centronics Systems Pty Ltd; Maurice Latin; Tiberio Salice and Fabrizio Latin v Nintendo Company Ltd |parallelcite=(1992) 39 [[Federal Court Reports|FCR]] 147 |date=1 December 1992 |courtname=[[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court (Full Court)]] |juris=Australia}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]] these rights are protected under the [Integrated Circuit Topography Act (1990, c. 37)].

In the [[European Union]], a ''sui generis'' design right protecting the design of materials was introduced by the [[Directive 87/54/EEC]] which is transposed in all member states.

[[India]] has the Semiconductor Integrated Circuits Layout Design Act, 2000 for the similar protection.

[[Japan]] relies on "The Act Concerning the Circuit Layout of a Semiconductor Integrated Circuit".

[[Brazil]] has enacted Law No. 11484, of 2007, to regulate the protection and registration of integrated circuit topography.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12239">In the United Kingdom, the '''Judge Advocate General and Judge Martial of all the Forces''' is a judge responsible for the [[court-martial]] process within the [[Royal Navy]], [[British Army]] and [[Royal Air Force]]. As such the post has existed since 2008; prior to this date the Judge Advocate General's authority related to the Army and the RAF while the [[Judge Advocate of the Fleet]] was his equivalent with regard to the Royal Navy.&lt;ref name=Roper1998&gt;{{cite book |last1=Roper |first1=Michael |title=The Records of the War Office and Related Departments, 1660-1964 |date=1998 |publisher=Public Record Office |location=Kew, Surrey }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
A Judge Martial is recorded as serving under the [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Earl of Leicester]] in the Netherlands in 1587-88. There were Judge Advocates on both sides during the [[English Civil War]] and following the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]] the office of Judge Advocate of the Army (soon to be known as Judge Advocate General) was established on a permanent basis in 1666.&lt;ref name="Roper1998" /&gt; Since 1682 the Judge Advocate General has been appointed by [[Letters patent]] of the Sovereign; until 1892 most Judge Advocates were [[Members of Parliament]], indeed from 1806 the office was a political one, the holder resigning on a change of [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]]. After 1892 the role of Judge Advocate General became a [[judicial]] rather than a [[ministerial office]]; at first it was combined with the [[President of the Probate Divorce and Admiralty Court|President of the Probate Divorce and Admiralty Division]] before being made fully independent in 1905.

The Judge Advocate General has been entitled to appoint Deputies since 1682.&lt;ref name="Roper1998" /&gt;

==Role==
The Judge Advocate General is Head of the [[Military courts of the United Kingdom|Service Justice System]] and is one of the [[Law Officers of the Crown]].&lt;ref name="JudiciaryMil"&gt;{{cite web |title=Military jurisdiction |url=https://www.judiciary.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-justice-system/jurisdictions/military-jurisdiction/ |website=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary |publisher=Judiciary Office |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Judge Advocate General is the senior [[Judge Advocate]] and is the overall lead for the jurisdiction (i.e. is not under the authority of the [[Lord Chief Justice]] or any other presiding judge).&lt;ref name="JudiciaryJAG"&gt;{{cite web |title=Judge Advocate General |url=https://www.judiciary.uk/about-the-judiciary/who-are-the-judiciary/judicial-roles/judges/judge-advocate-general/ |website=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Judge Advocate General is assisted by a team of judges who comprise the permanent judiciary, plus a small staff of civil servants. There is a total of seven judges, comprising one Vice-Judge Advocate General, and six Assistant Judge Advocates General, all of whom must be [[barrister]]s or [[Faculty of Advocates|advocate]]s of seven years standing. As Judge Advocates they preside over all proceedings in the [[Military Courts of the United Kingdom|Service courts]], which comprise the Court Martial, the Summary Appeal Court, and the Service Civilian Court.  The judges control the practice and procedure, give rulings on legal matters, and sum up the evidence for the [[jury]] (known as a "Board"). Defendants are entitled to a defending counsel or [[solicitor]], and their unit may provide an Accused's Assisting Officer if they so wish.

The Judge Advocate General's office holds cases deposited the originals of all Records of Proceedings, which are kept for at least six years. 

===Historic role===
Historically the Judge Advocate General had responsibility for prosecuting cases as well as for summoning and supervising the court. In 1923 moves were made to separate responsibility for prosecutions from the judicial responsibilities of the Judge Advocate General's office; complete separation was achieved 25 years later with the establishment of the Directorate of Army Legal Services in the War Office (and a parallel Directorate in the Air Ministry).

===Changes in the 2000s===
In the 1990s significant changes to the courts-martial system were instigated following [[European Court of Human Rights]] judgments. The Judge Advocate General was formerly the legal adviser of the Armed Forces, a role that ended in 2000. In both naval and military cases, all proceedings in the [[Military Courts of the United Kingdom]] are held under his or her authority (the former office of Judge Advocate of the Fleet having been amalgamated into that of the Judge Advocate General in 2008). Previously the Royal Navy, the British Army and the Royal Air Force had separate court martial arrangements, but all three Services have operated under a single system of Service law since November 2009.

The former practice of reviewing the findings and sentences of all trials of the old courts-martial was abolished in October 2009.  Now the outcome of each trial in the Court Martial (now a standing court) is final, subject to appeal to the [[Military Courts of the United Kingdom#Court Martial Appeal Court|Court Martial Appeal Court]].  The Judge Advocate General also has power to refer a case to the Court Martial Appeal Court if it gives rise to an important [[point of law]].
  
==Qualifications==
The post is regulated by the [[Courts-Martial (Appeals) Act 1951]]. The appointment is made by the [[British Sovereign]] on the recommendation of the [[Lord Chancellor]]. Formerly, the Judge Advocate General had to be a [[barrister]], [[Faculty of Advocates|advocate]], or [[solicitor]] with higher [[rights of audience]], of 10 years' standing.&lt;ref&gt;Courts-Martial (Appeals) Act 1951, s.31&lt;/ref&gt; As of 21 July 2008 the experience needed to qualify was reduced in line with a general move to broaden [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] in the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.dca.gov.uk/consult/judiciary/diversitycp25-04.htm | publisher=Department for Constitutional Affairs | title=Increasing Diversity in the Judiciry | year=October 2004 | quote=CP 25/04 | accessdate=2008-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="explan2"&gt;{{ cite web|accessdate=2008-03-05 |url=http://www.england-legislation.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts2007/en/07en15-d.htm |title=Explanatory Notes to Tribunals, Courts And Enforcement Act 2007 |year=2007 |publisher=Office of Public Service Information |quote=paras.281-316 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221000105/http://www.england-legislation.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts2007/en/07en15-d.htm |archivedate=2009-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An appointee who has practised in [[England and Wales]] now has to satisfy the [[judicial-appointment eligibility condition]] on a 7-year basis, while a practitioner from [[Scotland]] or [[Northern Ireland]] will need 7-years' standing as barrister, advocate or solicitor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007]], s.50/ Sch.10, Pt.1&lt;/ref&gt; The post is always held by a civilian rather than a [[commissioned officer]], however an appointee may have previously been a member of the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-judiciary-in-detail/jurisdictions/military-jurisdiction | publisher=Judiciary of England and Wales | title=Military | year=2011 | accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice the post is held by a Senior [[Circuit judge (UK)|Circuit Judge]].

The Judge Advocate General can also be appointed from the Vice Judge Advocate General or Assistant Judge Advocates General.&lt;ref&gt;Courts-Martial (Appeals) Act 1951, s.31(d)-(e)&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of Judge Advocates General==
Through 1847, the dates are those of actual entrance upon office, not of the appointment, which is usually a few days earlier; or of the patent, commonly some days later than those adopted in this list. After 1847 the dates are those of the ''[[London Gazette|Gazette]]'' notices of the appointment.

== Background ==
The "Algonquian-speaking Wabanaki People" have occupied many of the Maritime areas in Canada ([[Quebec]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Nova Scotia|Nova-Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]]) and the United States ([[Maine]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Vermont]] and [[Massachusetts]]) for thousands of years. According to the ''Institute for the Study of Human Rights at [[Columbia University]]'', the Wabanaki people share a history of experiencing discriminatory policies. The [[Discovery doctrine|Doctrine of Discovery]] (DOD) is one of the policies which was cited a number of times by individuals interviewed by the MWTRC as "the foundation of oppression of Wabanaki Tribes." It has been institutionalized in Unites States Law by [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[Case law|Cases]] and was responsible for giving Christian Colonizers the power to enslave Indigenous People and take control of their lands. The DOD was also responsible for the creation of the Indian Schooling Board System in the United States which developed schools like the [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] (1879-1918) whose main purpose was to assimilate Indian children into mainstream culture. More than 10 000 aboriginal children attended Carlisle, 186 of whom died while attending.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1958, the Indian Adoption Project (IAP) was put in place by the help of the United States federal government, the [[Child Welfare League of America|Child Welfare League]] and the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]. The IAP replaced the institutionalization of Native Children within Boarding School "with a policy of placing Native children for adoption into white homes."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1966, the IAP was replaced by the Adoption Resource Exchange of North America (ARENA), which continued the work of the IAP by placing Native Indian Children in white homes. Although official numbers cite the IAP as being responsible for only 395 Native Children, others have argued that in its scope (IAP &amp; ARENA) it has been responsible for the adoption of over 12,486 Native children between 1961 and 1976.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palmiste|first=Claire|date=2011|title=From the Indian Adoption Project to the Indian Child Welfare Act: the resistance of Native American communities|url=http://www.indigenouspolicy.org/index.php/ipj/article/view/4|journal=Indigenous Policy Journal|language=en|volume=22|issue=1|issn=2158-4168}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1978, the United States Federal Government put in place the Indian Child Welfare Act in response to the crisis affecting Native children and families. Research had found 25% to 30% of Native children were being taken from their homes and that 85% of these children were being placed outside of their families and communities even when relatives deemed fit and willing were available. The ICWA was created to protect "Indian Childrens' best interest" while promoting "the stability and security of Indian tribes and families".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nicwa.org/about-icwa/|title=About ICWA » NICWA|work=NICWA|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yes Mag"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/good-money/telling-the-truth-as-a-means-of-healing-20181107|title=Telling the Truth as a Means of Healing|author=Abaki Beck|date=7 November 2018|publisher=Yes Magazine|accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== MWTRC mandate ==
When the Maine Wabanaki-State Truth and Reconciliation Commission was created, it had seven objectives: 

* giving a "voice to Wabanaki people who have had experiences with Maine state child welfare", 
* giving a voice to those working in tribal and state welfare system as well as care providers and those involved in the legal system with regards to their experiences with Wabanaki families, 
* establishing a more complete history "of the Wabanaki people in the state child welfare system", 
* collaborating with TRC Community and Convening Groups "to provide opportunities for healing and deeper understanding for Wabanaki people and state child welfare staff", 
* improving child welfare practices and creating sustainable changes which strive to create the best child welfare system, 
* ensuring that lessons learnt by MWTRC are not forgotten by providing recommendations to tribal and state governments and "to further the objectives of the Commission", 
* and to "Promote individual, relational, systemic and cultural reconciliation."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Final report and recommendations==
When the WBTRC submitted its final report it had gathered approximately a hundred and fifty nine statements from native and non-native individuals which included native elders, foster parents, former children who were in the child welfare system, judges, tribal attorneys, former DHHS caseworkers and leaders, service providers and adoptees. Members from all  four Wabanaki groups --  the [[Maliseet]], [[Mi'kmaq|Micmac]], [[Passamaquoddy]] and [[Penobscot]] -- participated in the WBTRC.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Principal findings from the MWTRC included that aboriginal children were 5.1 times more likely to be put into foster care than other children, and that federal reviews from from 2006 and 2009 indicated that over fifty percent of aboriginal children did not have their native ancestry verified. This means that the number of aboriginal children within the system who would be eligible within the ICWA is unknown.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mainewabanakitrc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/TRC-Report-Expanded_July2015.pdf|title=MWTRC Report|last=|first=|date=|website=Maine Wabanaki TRC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;             

The WBTRC found that there continues to be significant public and institutional racism towards the Wabanaki people as well as issues over contested sovereignty and jurisdiction which have made administrating child welfare more challenging. They also concluded that their findings constituted [[cultural genocide]] as defined in the 1948 United Nations [[Genocide Convention|Convention on Genocide]] by “Causing serious bodily or mental harm” and “Forcibly transferring members of the group to another group.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;      

In total the WBTRC made fourteen recommendations. Among these recommendations were: 

* respecting the sovereignty and committing to uphold tribal, state, federal  protocols for both state and local levels 
* honouring "the Wabanaki choice to support healing as the tribes see fit and celebrate the cultural resurgence of the tribes within the Wabanaki confederacy so that both individuals and communities may be strengthened"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* developing [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]], "legal and judicial trainings that go beyond the basics of checklists and toolkits to recognize bias and build cultural awareness at all levels of leadership and accountability in ways that frame ICWA within historical context."
* creating better support to non-native adoptive or foster families to ensure Wabanaki children have stronger cultural ties
* creating more Native foster and therapeutic homes
* renewing the ICWA Workgroup to help create and implement new training methods, 
* with the help of the Wabanaki tribes, creating a policy to "monitor regular compliance" with the ICWA.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2385">According to their official website, the '''Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Justice and Culture of Liechtenstein''' unites three complimentary policy areas. For instance, the foreign policy tasks involve maintaining the independence of the country and handling policies that pertain to foreign economics, human rights, and international solidarity. The justice sector of the ministry handles civil law, criminal law, penal system, victim assistance, coordination of official liability, basic traffic and land valuation. Lastly, cultural policy means addressing Liechtenstein's national identity by way of institutions such as museums and the state library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.regierung.li/ministerien/ministerium-fuer-aeusseres-justiz-und-kultur|title=Regierung des Fürstentums Liechtenstein|website=www.regierung.li|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US Map 2.png|alt=|thumb|400x400px|Map showing dry (red), wet (blue), and moist (yellow) counties in the United States]]
In the [[United States]], a '''moist county''' is a [[County (United States)|county]] in between a "[[dry county]]" (where the [[sales|sale]] of [[alcoholic beverage]]s is [[prohibition of alcohol|prohibited]]) and a "[[wet county]]" (where alcohol is sold). The term is typically used for any county that allows alcohol to be sold in certain situations, but has limitations on alcohol sales that a normal "wet" county would not have. Some historically "dry" counties are switching to this system to avoid losing money to businesses in other counties, but do not wish to become completely "wet." The term in itself does not have any specific meaning, just that the county is not completely "wet" but is not "dry", either. The terms are applicable in states in which each county makes its own rules on alcohol sales.  A "dry" county that contains one or more "wet" [[US cities|cities]] is typically called "moist".

== Examples ==

In [[Kentucky]], the term can be used in two different senses:
*Two different [[Alcohol laws of Kentucky|statutes]] allow any dry territory—which can be a dry county or a city located in a dry county—to vote to authorize limited sales of alcoholic beverages by the drink in restaurants. Both statutes require that restaurants make at least 70% of their money from food (rather than alcohol) sales. One statute requires that the restaurant seat at least 100 patrons. The other, signed into law in June 2007, requires only 50 seats, but prohibits licensed establishments from having a dedicated bar and requires that the drinks be sold in association with a meal. Once a jurisdiction votes for such sales, qualifying restaurants  can apply for a permit, which are distributed on a somewhat limited basis. For example, the [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] suburban jurisdiction of [[Oldham County, Kentucky|Oldham County]] voted to allow such sales in the early 2000s (its county seat of [[La Grange, Kentucky|La Grange]] later approved full package sales in 2012).&lt;ref name="La Grange"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/19111180/la-grange-votes-for-expanded-alcohol-sales |title=La Grange voters approve expanded alcohol sales |author=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[WDRB]] |date=July 25, 2012 |accessdate=July 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note, however, that Kentucky's Office of Alcoholic Beverage Control does not use the term "moist county" to describe a county in which such sales are allowed, calling it instead a "limited" county.&lt;ref name=KYABC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abc.ky.gov/Licensing/Wet%20Dry%20List%20-%20Revised%208-21-14.pdf |title=Wet-Dry-Moist Territories August 21, 2014 |publisher=Kentucky Office of Alcoholic Beverage Control |accessdate=September 2, 2014 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224030253/http://abc.ky.gov/Licensing/Wet%20Dry%20List%20-%20Revised%208-21-14.pdf |archivedate=December 24, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Officially, a "moist county" is an otherwise dry county in which a city in the county's jurisdiction has voted to allow full retail sales of alcoholic beverages. The following Kentucky counties&lt;ref name="La Grange"/&gt;&lt;ref name=KYABC /&gt; fall in this category:

Note that once a city votes itself fully wet, state law mandates a 60-day period, starting on the date that the election results are certified, before vendors can apply for licenses to sell distilled spirits and wine. At the end of that period, the state will then advertise in that city's newspaper of record to announce the number of licenses that will be granted. However, beer licenses are not subject to quotas, and can be applied for once the city enacts a governing ordinance.&lt;ref name="Murray certified"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://murrayledger.com/news/local/wet-dry-results-certified-thursday/article_60a4e6e4-d274-11e1-b2af-0019bb2963f4.html |title=Wet-dry results certified Thursday |first=Hawkins |last=Teague |newspaper=Murray Ledger &amp; Times |date=July 20, 2012 |accessdate=July 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the '''Multi-Use Radio Service (MURS)''' is a licensed by rule [[two-way radio]] service similar to [[Citizens band radio|Citizens Band]] (CB). Established by the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Federal Communications Commission]] in the fall of 2000, MURS created a radio service allowing for licensed by rule (Part 95) operation in a narrow selection of the [[Very high frequency|VHF band]], with a power limit of 2 [[watt]]s. The FCC formally defines MURS as "a private, two-way, short-distance voice or data communications service for personal or business activities of the general public." MURS stations may not be connected to the public telephone network, may not be used for [[store and forward]] operations, and [[radio repeater]]s are not permitted.

In 2009 [[Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada|Industry Canada]] (IC) established a five-year transition plan, which would have permitted the use of MURS in Canada starting June 2014.&lt;ref name=IC-allows-MURS/&gt;  In August 2014 IC announced a deferral of MURS introduction, as "the Department does not feel that the introduction of MURS devices in Canada is warranted at this time, and has decided to defer the introduction of MURS devices in Canada until a clearer indication of actual need is provided by Canadian MURS advocates and/or stakeholders&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name=SAB-002-14/&gt;

== Eligibility ==
No licenses are required or issued for MURS within the [[United States]].
:Any person is authorized to use the MURS frequencies given that it:&lt;ref&gt;http://wireless.fcc.gov/services/index.htm?job=service_home&amp;id=multi_use&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Is not a foreign government or a representative of a foreign government.
:* Uses the transmitter in accordance with 47 CFR. 95.1309.
:* Operates in accordance with the rules contained in Sections 95.1301-95.1309.
:* Operates only legal, type-accepted MURS equipment.

== Frequencies ==
MURS comprises the following five [[frequency|frequencies]]:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Channel
! Frequency
! Maximum&lt;br /&gt;authorized bandwidth
! Channel name
|-
| 1
| 151.820 [[Hertz|MHz]]
| 11.25&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|kHz]]
|MURS 1
|-
| 2
| 151.880&amp;nbsp;MHz
| 11.25&amp;nbsp;kHz
|MURS 2
|-
| 3
| 151.940&amp;nbsp;MHz
| 11.25&amp;nbsp;kHz
|MURS 3
|-
| 4
| 154.570&amp;nbsp;MHz 
| 20.00&amp;nbsp;kHz
| [[Business band#VHF frequencies|Blue Dot]]
|-
| 5
| 154.600&amp;nbsp;MHz 
| 20.00&amp;nbsp;kHz
| [[Business band#VHF frequencies|Green Dot]]
|}

Channels 1–3 must use "narrowband" [[frequency modulation]] (2.5&amp;nbsp;kHz deviation). Channels 4 and 5 may use either "wideband" FM (5&amp;nbsp;kHz deviation) or "narrowband" FM.  MURS falls under part 95 and was not mandated for narrow-banding, such as those of Part 90 in the public service bands by January 2013.

Because previous business band licensees who have maintained their active license remain [[Grandfather clause|grandfathered]] with their existing operating privileges, it is possible to find repeaters or other operations not authorized by Part 95 taking place. These are not necessarily illegal. If legal, such operations may enjoy primary status on their licensed frequency and as such are legally protected from harmful interference by MURS users.&lt;ref name="95.1317"&gt;{{CodeFedReg|47|95|1317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Range==
MURS range will vary, depending on antenna size and placement. With an external antenna, ranges of {{convert|10|mi|km}} or more can be expected.&lt;ref name="fcc.gov"&gt;http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/multi-use-radio-service-murs-0&lt;/ref&gt;  Full [[line-of-sight propagation]] is usually not possible due to the relatively low power restriction of 2 watts. {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Permitted areas of operation==
MURS operation is authorized anywhere a [[Citizens band radio|CB]] station is authorized and within or over any area of the world where radio services are regulated by the FCC. Those areas are within the territorial limits of:
* The fifty United States
* The District of Columbia
* Caribbean Insular areas
* Commonwealth of Puerto Rico
* [[Navassa Island]]
* United States Virgin Islands (50 islets and cays)
* Pacific Insular areas
* [[American Samoa]] (seven islands)
* [[Baker Island]]
* Commonwealth of Northern [[Mariana Islands]]
* [[Guam]] Island
* [[Howland Island]]
* [[Jarvis Island]]
* [[Johnston Atoll]] (Islets East, Johnston, North and Sand)
* [[Kingman Reef]]
* [[Midway Atoll]] (Islets Eastern and Sand)
* [[Palmyra Atoll]] (more than fifty [[islet]]s)
* [[Wake Island]]
* Aboard any vessel of the United States, with the permission of the captain, while the vessel is traveling either domestically or in international waters.

==Restrictions==
* Transmitter power output is limited to 2 watts.
* The highest point of any MURS antenna must not be more than {{convert|18.3|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} above the ground or {{convert|6.10|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} above the highest point of the structure to which it is mounted, whichever is higher.&lt;ref name="part95" /&gt;
* Transmitting on MURS frequencies is not allowed while aboard aircraft in flight.&lt;ref name="part95" /&gt;
* When transmitting in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Desecheo]], [[Mona, Puerto Rico|Mona]], [[Vieques]], and [[Culebra, Puerto Rico|Culebra]], care must be taken to not interfere with the [[Arecibo Observatory]].
* Devices that use MURS must be specially labeled and certified.&lt;ref name="fcc.gov"/&gt;

==Products==
There are a wide variety of radio products that use MURS frequencies. MURS devices consist of wireless base station intercoms, handheld two-way radios, wireless dog training collars, wireless public address units, customer service callboxes, wireless remote switches, and wireless callboxes with or without gate opening ability. Since MURS uses standard frequencies, most devices that use MURS are compatible with each other.

The [[goTenna]] version1 (non-mesh) digital radio product operates on the MURS band and pairs with [[smartphone]]s to enable users to send texts and share locations on a [[peer-to-peer]] basis.  goTenna is not interoperable with other MURS devices, even though they operate on the same spectrum, employing "listen-before-talk" to reduce interference in the band's five channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8058473|website=news.ycombinator.com| title=Hacker News — goTenna | access-date=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNET&gt;{{cite web|last1=Statt|first1=Nick|title=GoTenna creates a cell network out of thin air anywhere on Earth|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/gotenna-creates-c——ell-network-out-of-thin-air-anywhere-on-earth/|website=CNET|publisher=CBS Interactive|access-date=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Network World"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nelson|first1=Patrick|title=Device lets smartphones communicate during network outage|url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/2871661/business-continuity/outage-device-lets-smartphones-communicate.html|website=Network World|publisher=Network World|access-date=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Munn v. Illinois''''', 94 U.S. 113 (1876),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Munn v. Illinois|volume=94|page=113|pin=|year=1876}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Supreme Court|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court upheld the power of government to regulate private industries.

==Facts==
The case was developed because in 1871, the legislature of [[Illinois]] responded to pressure from the [[National Grange]], an association of farmers, by setting maximum rates that private companies could charge for the storage and transport of agricultural products. The [[Chicago]] grain warehouse firm of Munn and Scott was found guilty of violating the law but appealed the conviction on the grounds that the law was an unconstitutional deprivation of property without due process of law that violated the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Munn v. Illinois|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/397610/Munn-v-Illinois|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment==
The Supreme Court decided the appeal in 1877. Chief Justice [[Morrison Remick Waite]] spoke for the majority, which affirmed the constitutionality of state regulation extending to private industries that affect public interests. Because grain storage facilities were devoted to public use, their rates were subject to public regulation.

Moreover, Waite declared that even if Congress alone is granted control over interstate commerce, a state could take action in the public interest without impairing that federal control.

The decision was reversed in [[Wabash, St. Louis &amp; Pacific Railway Co. v. Illinois|Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway Co. v. Illinois]].

The '''National Library of Indonesia''' ({{lang-id|Perpustakaan Nasional Republik Indonesia}}, PNRI) is the [[legal deposit]] [[National library|library]] of [[Indonesia]]. It is located at [[Gambir, Jakarta|Gambir]], on the south side of [[Merdeka Square, Jakarta]]. It serves primarily as a [[humanities]] library alongside several others holding national responsibilities for science and [[agriculture]]. The national library was established in 1980 through a decree of the [[Ministry of Education and Culture (Indonesia)|Ministry of Education and Culture]] and the consolidation of four different libraries. It maintains the status of a non-departmental government institution and is responsible to the [[President of Indonesia]]. The earliest collections originated from the library of the [[National Museum (Indonesia)|National Museum]], opened in 1868 and formerly operated by the [[Royal Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences]]. The previous library building was opened in 1988 with financial support from [[Siti Hartinah|Tien Suharto]]. The new twenty-four storey building is claimed to be the tallest library building in the world. It was inaugurated by Indonesian president [[Joko Widodo]] on 14 September, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kompas.tv/content/article/12982/video/sapa-indonesia/perpustakaan-nasional-ri-yang-baru|title=Jokowi Resmikan PNRI, Perpustakaan Tertinggi di Dunia|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/travel/2017/11/11/jakpost-guide-to-the-national-library-of-indonesia.html|title=Jakpost guide to the National Library of Indonesia |newspaper=The Jakarta Post|accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
=== Origins ===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Het gebouw annex museum van het Bataviaasch Genootschap. TMnr 60005154.jpg|thumb|left|Museum of the Royal Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences, now the [[National Museum (Indonesia)|National Museum of Indonesia]], {{circa}} 1875–1885]]
The origins of the national library date back to the 1778 foundation of the [[Royal Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences]], the first of its kind in Asia. Through its promotion of scholarship in the [[Dutch East Indies]], the society created numerous publications and accumulated a number of collections, including establishing a library. After increasing its collections during the first half of the 19th century, the society and its library moved in 1868 to a new location at the current [[National Museum (Indonesia)|National Museum]] at [[Merdeka Square, Jakarta|Merdeka Square]]. Attempts to divert some collections to the new [[Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies]] (KITLV) were resisted by members. Between 1846 and 1920, the library's collection grew from 1,115 items to over 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Massil|2001|p=520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society's library survived the years of conflict during and following [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Massil|1994|p=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese forces occupying Indonesia during the war years were impressed by the number Japanese scholars in the society and did not interfere with the affairs of the museum. Because authorities also upheld the library's powers of [[legal deposit]], it holds a substantial collection of official wartime publication. Following independence, the society was renamed the Indonesian Institute of Culture (''{{lang|id|Lembaga Kebudayaan Indonesia}}'') before being dissolved in 1962. The library was then placed under the museum's jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="Massil 521"&gt;{{Harvnb|Massil|2001|p=521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National library===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De bibliotheek in het museum van het Koninklijk Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen Batavia TMnr 60025184.jpg|thumb|Library collection of the Royal Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences, {{circa}} 1896]]
Although a plan for a national library was included in the 1961 First National Development Plan, it was not sustained in the following years. In 1973, Mastini Hardjoprakoso, an employee of the National Museum library, developed a concept for the national library, but it was not immediately adopted by the [[Ministry of Education and Culture (Indonesia)|Ministry of Education and Culture]]. However, the plan caught the attention of the [[National Development Planning Agency]] (Bappenas) and other information services. When a new culture director took office in 1978, the ministry finally gave its support for the project. Funding for the library was also provided by Madam [[Siti Hartinah|Tien Suharto]], who was impressed by a 1968 exhibition of colonial and national newspapers at the National Museum.&lt;ref name="Massil 521" /&gt;

The National Library of Indonesia was created through a 1980 decree by the Minister of Education and Culture [[Daoed Joesoef]].&lt;ref name="Saputro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hardjoprakoso 222"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardjoprakoso|1995|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four libraries were consolidated in the process: two departments of the [[Library Development Centre]] (the Library of Political and Social History, founded in 1952, and the Department of Bibliography and Deposits, founded in 1953); the library of the [[Jakarta]] regional office of the Ministry of Education and Culture, founded in 1953; and the library of the National Museum. In addition to the establishment of a national library system, the decree granted the library powers of [[legal deposit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Massil|2001|p=519}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library was placed under the jurisdiction of the Directorate General for Culture within the ministry.&lt;ref name="Saputro" /&gt; The new library building opened in 1988.&lt;ref name="Massil 521" /&gt;

Under Presidential Decree 11 of (6 March) 1989, the National Library fully subsumed the assets of the Library Development Centre and became a non-departmental government institution. It no longer reports to the ministry and is responsible to the [[President of Indonesia]] through the State Secretariat.&lt;ref name="Saputro" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardjoprakoso|1995|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library's operations were once again revised through a 1997 decree in order to meet the needs of globalization.&lt;ref name="Saputro" /&gt;

==New building==
The new library building, which took almost three years to build, is 126.3 meters tall, and has 24 floors. It was planned in line with "green building" concepts. Membership cards and books are equipped with [[Radio-frequency identification]] devices for security and to monitor the inventory.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web  | url = http://perpusnas.go.id/2017/09/presiden-jokowi-resmikan-gedung-fasilitas-layanan-perpustakaan-nasional-ri/

==Services==
The library serves the entire Indonesian people and is primarily a [[humanities]] library. National responsibility for science belongs to the [[Centre for Scientific Documentation and Information]] (''{{lang|id|Pusat Dokumentasi dan Informasi Ilmiah}}''). The [[Centre for Agricultural Library and Technology Dissemination]] (''{{lang|id|Pusat Perpustakaan dan Penyebaran Teknologi Pertanian}}''), formerly part of the [[Bogor Botanical Gardens]], holds the responsibility for an [[agriculture]] library.&lt;ref name="Massil 521" /&gt; Other libraries of national importance include the library of the [[Bandung Institute of Technology]] and the [[University of Indonesia]] medical faculty library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Massil|1994|p=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the national library, Indonesia began its own [[International Standard Book Number]] and [[Cataloging in Publication]] programs. The library maintains [[Bibliography|bibliographies]] of the state ideology [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] and Javanese manuscripts. It also develops an independent computer housekeeping system and implements the [[MARC standards]]. Both the United States [[Library of Congress]] and the [[National Library of Australia]] maintain regional offices in Jakarta.&lt;ref name="Massil 521" /&gt;

In January 2017, the National Library of Indonesia partnered with [[Neliti]], a freely available [[Disciplinary repository|repository]] of publications from Indonesian research institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.neliti.com/|title=Neliti - Indonesia's Think Tank Database|website=www.neliti.com|access-date=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Library system===
The 1980 [[ministerial decree]] also outlined a library system for the country. Aside from the national library, the decree established libraries at the provincial and other administrative levels. It outlined plans for an integrated system of school, academic/university, and mobile libraries.&lt;ref name="Hardjoprakoso 222" /&gt;

The '''National Library of Israel''' ('''NLI'''; {{lang-he|הספרייה הלאומית|translit=HaSifria HaLeumit}}; {{lang-ar|المكتبة الوطنية في إسرائيل}}), formerly '''Jewish National and University Library''' ('''JNUL'''; {{lang-he|בית הספרים הלאומי והאוניברסיטאי|translit=Beit Ha-Sfarim Ha-Le'umi ve-Ha-Universita'i}}), is the library dedicated to collecting the cultural treasures of [[Israel]] and of [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[Cultural heritage|heritage]]. The library holds more than 5 million books, and is located on the [[Givat Ram]] campus of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. 

The National Library owns the world's largest collections of [[Hebraica]] and [[Judaica]], and is the repository of many rare and unique manuscripts, books and artifacts.

==History==
[[File:Ardon Windows JNUL.jpg|thumb|[[Mordecai Ardon|Ardon]] windows in the lobby of NLI.]]
[[File:B'nai B'rith library.jpg|thumb|B'nai Brith library, Jerusalem]]
The [[B'nai Brith]] library, founded in [[Jerusalem]] in 1892, was the first public library in [[Palestine_(region)|Palestine]] to serve the Jewish community. The library was located on [[B'nai Brith]] street, between the [[Meah Shearim]] neighborhood and the [[Russian Compound]].&lt;ref name=Haaretz&gt;{{cite news |author = [[Aryeh Dayan]] |title = New chapter in a sad saga |publisher = [[Haaretz]] |url = http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/new-chapter-in-a-sad-saga-1.232285 |accessdate=2017-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years later, the Bet Midrash Abrabanel library, as it was then known, moved to Ethiopia Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cfhu.org/news/hebrew-university-hails-landmark-legislation-establishment-national-library |title= Hebrew University Hails ‘Landmark Legislation’ for the Establishment of the National Library |accessdate=2008-10-01 |publisher=Canadian Friends of the Hebrew University |date=2007-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, when plans were drawn up for the Hebrew University, the B'nai Brith collection became the basis for a university library. The books were moved to [[Mount Scopus]] when the university opened five years later.&lt;ref name=Haaretz /&gt; 

In 1948, when access to the university campus on Mount Scopus was blocked, most of the books were moved to the university's temporary quarters in the Terra Sancta building in [[Rehavia]]. By that time, the university collection included over one million books. For lack of space, some of the books were placed in storerooms around the city. In 1960, they were moved to the new JNUL building in Givat Ram.&lt;ref name=Haaretz /&gt;

In the late 1970s, when the new university complex on Mount Scopus was inaugurated and the faculties of Law, Humanities and Social Science returned there, departmental libraries opened on that campus and the number of visitors to the Givat Ram library dropped. In the 1990s, the building suffered from maintenance problems such as rainwater leaks and insect infestation.&lt;ref name=Haaretz /&gt; 

In 2007 the library was officially recognized as The National Library of the State of Israel after the passage of the National Library Law.&lt;ref name=Haaretz /&gt; The law, which came into effect on 23 July 2008, changed the library's name to "National Library of Israel" and turned it temporarily to a [[subsidiary company]] of the University, later to become a fully independent [[community interest company]], jointly owned by the [[Government of Israel]] (50%), the Hebrew University (25%) and other organizations.

In 2011, the library launched a website granting public access to books, periodicals, maps, photos and music from its collections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/israel-s-national-library-puts-collection-online-1.399377 Israel's National Library puts collection online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the project for a new home of the Library in Jerusalem was unveiled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archdaily.com/366202/herzog-and-de-meuron-to-design-the-national-library-of-israel Herzog &amp; de Meuron to Design the National Library of Israel], ArchDaily, 29 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The 34,000 square meters building, designed by the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] architecture firm [[Herzog &amp; de Meuron]], is scheduled for full completion in 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= herzog &amp; de meuron reveals designs for national library of israel | url=http://www.designboom.com/architecture/herzog-de-meuron-national-library-of-israel-jerusalem-11-10-2014/ |publisher=[[Designboom]]|accessdate=December 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archdaily.com/785556/herzog-and-de-meuron-share-new-images-of-the-national-library-of-israel Herzog &amp; de Meuron Share New Images of the National Library of Israel], ArchDaily, 14 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals and objectives==
[[File:הספרייה הלאומית - 2.jpg|thumb|Future home of the National Library of Israel]]

The library's mission is to secure copies of all material published in Israel, in any language; all publications on the subject of Israel, the [[Land of Israel]], [[Judaism]] and the [[Jewish people]], published in any language, in any country in the world; and all material published in [[Hebrew]] or any of the languages spoken in the [[Jewish Diaspora]] (such as [[Yiddish]] and [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]]). 

By law, two copies of all printed matter published in Israel must be deposited in the National Library. In 2001, the law was amended to include audio and video recordings, and other non-print media.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.jnul.huji.ac.il/eng/history.html Jewish National &amp; University Library History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421084915/http://www.jnul.huji.ac.il/eng/history.html |date=21 April 2007 }} {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many manuscripts, including some of the library's unique volumes such the 13th century [[Worms Mahzor]], have been scanned and are now available on the [[Internet]].

==Special collections==
[[File:Reading room of the National Library of Israel 2.jpg|thumb|Reading room]]
Among the library's special collections are the personal papers of hundreds of outstanding Jewish figures, the National Sound Archives, the Laor Map Collection and numerous other collections of Hebraica and Judaica. The library also possesses some of [[Isaac Newton]]'s manuscripts dealing with theological subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jnul.huji.ac.il/dl/mss/newton/collection_eng.html Newton Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070724080024/http://www.jnul.huji.ac.il/dl/mss/newton/collection_eng.html |date=24 July 2007 }} {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection, donated by the family of the collector [[Abraham Yahuda]], includes a large number of works by Newton about mysticism, analyses of holy books, predictions about the end of days  and the appearance of the ancient Temple in Jerusalem. It also contains maps that Newton sketched about mythical events to assist him in his end of days calculations.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.haaretz.com/israel-national-library-uploads-trove-of-newton-s-theological-tracts-1.411811 Israeli National Library uploads trove of Newton's theological tracts]&lt;/ref&gt; The library houses the personal archives of [[Martin Buber]] and [[Gershom Scholem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/national-library-germany-partner-to-put-papers-online-1.343622 National Library, Germany partner to put papers online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palestinian books===
Following the occupation of [[West Jerusalem]] by [[Haganah]] forces in May 1948, the libraries of a number Palestinians who fled the country as well as of other well-to-do Palestinians were transferred to the National Library.&lt;ref name=Amit&gt;[http://cmsprod.bgu.ac.il/Eng/Centers/Templates/GeneralTemplateENG.aspx?NRMODE=Published&amp;NRORIGINALURL=%2fEng%2fCenters%2freview%2fsummer2008%2flooting%2ehtml&amp;NRNODEGUID=%7b2C62F8D7-1D9B-4F90-85E6-9D67B902D7A7%7d&amp;NRCACHEHINT=NoModifyGuest#_ednref15 The Looting of the Palestinian Books] Mitaam: a Review for radical thought 8 (December 2006), pp. 12-22, by Gish Amit&lt;/ref&gt; These collections included those of [[Henry Cattan]], [[Khalil Beidas]], [[Khalil al-Sakakini]] and [[Nashashibi|Aref Hikmet Nashashibi]].&lt;ref&gt;Israel State Archive, Jerusalem, 1429/3&lt;/ref&gt; About 30,000 books were removed from homes in West Jerusalem, with another 40,000 taken from other cities in Mandatory Palestine. It is unclear whether the books were being kept and protected or if they were looted from the abandoned houses of their owners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/preserving-or-looting-palestinian-books-in-jerusalem.premium-1.483352 Preserving or looting Palestinian books in Jerusalem]&lt;/ref&gt; About 6,000 of these books are in the library today indexed with the label AP – "Abandoned Property".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jerusalemquarterly.org/images/ArticlesPdf/47-%20Over%20Due%20Books.pdf Overdue Books: Returning Palestine’s “Abandoned Property” of 1948] by Hannah Mermelstein, Jerusalem Quarterly, Autumn 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The books are cataloged, can be viewed from the Library's general catalog and are regularly consulted by the public, including Arab scholars from all over the world.

The '''United States Progressive Party of 1948''' was a [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[political party]] that served as a vehicle for former Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace]]'s 1948 presidential campaign. The party sought desegregation, the establishment of a national health insurance system, an expansion of the welfare system, and the nationalization of the energy industry. The party also sought conciliation with the [[Soviet Union]] during the early stages of the [[Cold War]].

Wallace had served as vice president under [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] but was dumped from the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] ticket in 1944. After the end of [[World War II]], Wallace emerged as a prominent critic of President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s Cold War policies. Wallace's supporters held the [[1948 Progressive National Convention]], which nominated a ticket consisting of Wallace and Democratic Senator [[Glen H. Taylor]] of [[Idaho]]. Despite challenges from Wallace, Republican nominee [[Thomas E. Dewey]], and [[Strom Thurmond]] of the [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregationist]] [[Dixiecrat]]s, Truman won re-election in the 1948 election. Wallace won 2.4% of the vote, which was far less than the share received by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|Robert La Follette]], the presidential candidates of the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|1912]] and [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924–34)|1924 Progressive Party]] tickets, respectively. Neither of those parties were directly related to Wallace's party, though these parties did carry over ideological groups and influenced many members of the 1948 Progressive Party.

After the election, Wallace recanted his foreign policy views and became estranged from his former supporters. The party nominated attorney [[Vincent Hallinan]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952 presidential election]], and Hallinan won 0.2% of the national popular vote. The party began to disband in 1955 as opponents of [[Anti-communism|anti-Communism]] became increasingly unpopular, and was mostly fully dissolved by the late 1960s with the exception of a few affiliated state Progressive Parties.

The Progressive Party of Henry Wallace was, and remains, controversial due to the issue of [[Communism|communist influence]]. The party served as a safe haven for communists, [[fellow travelers]], and anti-war [[Modern American liberalism|liberals]] during the [[Red Scare|Second Red Scare]]. Prominent Progressive Party supporters included U.S. Representative [[Vito Marcantonio]] and writer [[Norman Mailer]].&lt;ref name="A Double Life"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lennon|first1=Michael|title=Norman Mailer: A Double Life|date=2013|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=9781439150191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of the Progressive Party began in 1946, after [[Secretary of Commerce]] and former Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace]] quit the [[Harry S. Truman|Truman administration]] and began to publicly agitate against Truman's policies. Calls for a [[Third party (politics)|third party]] had been growing even before Wallace, who was replaced as vice president by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] with the more conservative Truman at the [[1944 Democratic National Convention]],  left the Truman Administration. One of the ironies of the contest between Wallace and Truman was that, if FDR had not [[Democratic vice presidential nomination of 1944|replaced Wallace with Truman]] at the 1944 Democratic convention—at the behest of Democratic Party bosses who felt that Wallace was too liberal and too erratic—Wallace would have been President of the United States, not Truman.

Wallace disliked the hard line that Truman had taken against the [[Soviet Union]], a stance that won him favor among liberals and [[fellow travelers]] who were opposed to what became known as the [[Cold War]]. He received support from two major organizations, the National Citizens Political Action Committee (NCPAC) and the Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions (ICCASP), [[political action committees]] (PACs) that had been created to support FDR.&lt;ref name="digital.lib.uiowa.edu"&gt;

In her 1954 book ''School of Darkness'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dodd|first1=Bella|title=School of Darkness|date=1954|publisher=The Devin-Adair Company|location=New York|url=https://www.amazon.com/School-Darkness-B-V-Dodd/dp/0815968043|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bella Dodd]], a Communist Party US National Committee member who later left and went on to give anti-Communist testimony before Congress, wrote about a June 1947 Communist National Committee meeting she attended at which the founding of the 1948 Progressive Party was planned:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The point of it all came near the end, when [[John Gates|[John] Gates]] read that a third party would be very effective in 1948, but only if we could get Henry Wallace to be its candidate.

There it was, plainly stated. The Communists were proposing a third party, a farmer-labor party, as a political maneuver for the 1948 elections. They were even picking the candidate.

When Gates had finished, I took the floor. I said that while I would not rule out the possibility of building a farmer-labor party, surely the decision to place a third party in 1948 should be based not on whether Henry Wallace would run, but on whether a third party would help meet the needs of workers and farmers in America. And if a third party were to participate in the 1948 elections, the decision should be made immediately by bona-fide labor and farmer groups, and not delayed until some secret and unknown persons made the decision.

My remarks were heard in icy silence. When I had finished, the committee with no answer to my objection simply went on to other work.

However, it was becoming evident that the top clique was having a hard time with this proposition. It was also clear that [[Eugene Dennis|[Eugene] Dennis]] and his clique of smart boys were reserving to themselves the right to make the final decision, and that the Party in general was being kept pretty much in the dark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dodd|first1=Bella|title=School of Darkness|date=1954|publisher=The Devin-Adair Company|location=New York|pages=203–204|url=https://www.amazon.com/School-Darkness-B-V-Dodd/dp/0815968043|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Communist influence==

In February 1948, two days before a special election put American Labor Party candidate [[Leo Isacson]] into Congress, the ''New York Times'' analyzed the shifting background of the Progressive Party:   &lt;blockquote&gt; The question involved in the special election is how strongly the Labor [ALP] party vote will hold up after withdrawal of the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America]] and other [[anti-Communist]] unions from the Labor party because of its support of Mr. Wallace's candidacy for President, which has left the [[Communist Party of the USA|Communists]] and other left-wing elements in complete control of that party's organization.&lt;ref name=Test&gt;

Dewey had defeated the isolationist, non-interventionist [[Robert A. Taft]] for the GOP nomination and favored an aggressive policy against the USSR.

The [[Communist Party USA]] did not field a presidential candidate, and instead endorsed Wallace for President; given that the [[Cold War]] was beginning to gain momentum and with it the [[Second Red Scare|Red Scare]] and anti-Communist sentiment. This endorsement was to hinder Wallace far more than it would help him. Wallace had served [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] as [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]], Vice President, and [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]]. He was fired by President [[Harry S. Truman]] because he denounced Truman's foreign policy regarding the Cold War. When Wallace refused to expel Communists working in the party during the 1948 election, his campaign was severely criticized by both the rigidly anti-Communist Truman and [[Thomas E. Dewey|Dewey]] camps.

The former Communist National Committee member [[Bella Dodd]] asserts in her 1954 memoir ''School of Darkness'' that the Progressive Party of 1948 had Wallace as its voice and "inspirational leader" but was really controlled by top U.S. Communists, particularly [[William Z. Foster]] and [[Eugene Dennis]], who filled the staff of the new party with people loyal to themselves and dictated self-defeating policies to the Progressive Party. Dodd concluded:  &lt;blockquote&gt;The reason they wanted a small limited Progressive Party was because it was the only kind they could control. They wanted to control it because they wanted a political substitute for the Communist Party, which they expected would soon be made illegal. A limited and controlled Progressive Party would be a cover organization and a substitute for the Communist Party if the latter were outlawed." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dodd|first1=Bella|title=School of Darkness|date=1954|publisher=The Devin-Adair Company|location=New York|page=205|url=https://www.amazon.com/School-Darkness-B-V-Dodd/dp/0815968043|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;     Historians have disputed the degree to which Communists shaped the party. Most agree that Wallace himself was not a Communist, but they also agree that he paid very little attention to internal party affairs.  Historians Schapsmeier and Schapsmeier argue &lt;!-- Wrong citation style --&gt;(1970 p 181):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[The Progressive Party] stood for one thing and Wallace another. Actually the party organization was controlled from the outset by those representing the radical left and not liberalism per se. This made it extremely easy for Communists and fellow travelers to infiltrate into important positions within the party machinery. Once this happened, party stands began to resemble a party line. Campaign literature, speech materials, and campaign slogans sounded strangely like echoes of what Moscow wanted to hear. As if wearing moral blinkers, Wallace increasingly became an imperceptive ideologue. Words were uttered by Wallace that did not sound like him, and his performance took on a strange Jekyll and Hyde quality—one moment he was a peace protagonist and the next a propaganda parrot for the Kremlin.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
One historian (further to the left than the Schapsmeiers) explores the internal dynamic (Schmidt 258-9):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* At one pole were the extreme leftists, three closely related groups—admitted Communists, past and present; the party-liners and fellow travelers who failed to differ noticeably with the Communists as to either policy or principle; and finally those non-Communists who, in …  1944-50 failed to take issue with the Communists on policy, but whose underlying principles seemingly differed….
* In the middle were grouped an apparently large majority of Progressive Party followers—the moderates. Exemplified by both national candidates, these individuals were willing to accept Communist support, because they felt that it was inconsistent, in the light of their ideals, to oppose Redbaiting by others, yet attempt to read Communists out of the new party.
* At the right were arrayed those who, feeling that Communist support should have been disavowed in no uncertain terms, yet were unwilling to adopt the [[Americans For Democratic Action|ADA]] tactic of violent attack on the Communists. This group would have approved making the Progressives "non-Communist" rather than "antiCommunist", excluding but not assailing the Reds. Most persons sharing this view had, like [[Max Lerner]], completely avoided the party, but others like [[Rexford Guy Tugwell]] joined and stayed, if reluctantly, through the campaign….
* In the period following 1948, party members were hounded by the [[House Unamerican Activities Committee]], from job to job. Members found themselves fired from even the lowest of [[day labor]] jobs by FBI agents and others. Although historians point out that groups tended to leave the party in the order of their views from right to left, with most of the rightists departing during or shortly after the campaign, accompanied by many of the moderates. And the moderate defection, so marked following election day, 1948, becoming a nearly complete walkout in the summer of 1950, with the policy rift over Korea and Wallace's departure. Consequently, by the close of 1951 the few remaining portions of the Wallace Progressive Party were composed almost exclusively of the earlier extreme left group. These were the ones who had favored a "narrow" organization; after the Wallace break, they finally achieved this goal, with the departure of almost everyone else, this does not take into account the huge pressure to conform and stop the activism by HUAC and FBI. The fact that the member of congress defeated by [[Joe McCarthy]] was [[Robert La Follette Jr]], as an irony not lost on these activists. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

U.S. Senator [[Robert M. La Follette, Jr.]], whose father [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|"Fighting Bob" La Follette]] had run for president on the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive Party]] ticket in 1924, had been head of the [[Wisconsin Progressive Party]] (which was not related to Wallace's party), though he had returned to the Republican fold by 1946. He was defeated by McCarthy in the Republican primary.

[[Orson Welles]], a friend of Roosevelt who had endorsed him in the 1944 election, refused to be involved with Wallace's Presidential campaign. Welles later described Wallace as "a prisoner of the [U.S.] Communist Party. He would never do anything to upset them."&lt;ref name=Biskind&gt;Peter Biskind (ed.). ''My Lunches with Orson: Conversations Between Henry Jaglom and Orson Welles'', Macmillan (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p. 66&lt;/sup&gt;

If we are going to be a party of 20 million, there are going to be many kinds of people in that party. Keep the door open.|[[Henry A. Wallace]], from a speech given in April 1948&lt;ref&gt;Karl M. Schmidt, ''Henry A. Wallace: Quixotic Crusade 1948''. Syracuse University Press, 1960, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The slogan of the "New Party", and the name many used to refer to the party forming around Henry Wallace, was appropriately "Fight for Peace". A major drive for Henry Wallace had always been the ending of the hostile relations between the Soviet Union and the United States and the acceptance of Russian influence in Europe.&lt;ref name="digital.lib.uiowa.edu"/&gt; These sentiments were first put forward by Wallace in 1944, but those same sentiments soon began to take a more dramatic tone, as a sense of urgency and anxiety for peace settled in with the beginning of the arms race and the Cold War. Yet, while the "New Party" may be most famous for its anti-war, pro-Russian relations, it sought to include an incredibly broad range of issues and interests. The quote by Henry Wallace above shows how he, and many others in the party, sought to create something more than a single-issue party, to the objection of other leaders in the party who felt that would be their undoing.&lt;ref&gt;Karl M. Schmidt "Henry A. Wallace: Quixotic Crusade 1948" Syracuse ''Syracuse University Press'', 1960, pg 93-94&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the platform of the party and the range of issues it covered show the diversity of the people who formed the "New Party" in 1948, which included many socialists as well as communists. Among the policies the Progressive Party hoped to implement were the end of all Jim Crow laws/segregation in the South, the advancement of women's rights, the continuation of many New Deal policies including national health insurance and unemployment benefits, the expansion of the welfare system, and the nationalization of the energy industry among others.&lt;ref name="digital.lib.uiowa.edu"/&gt;

The ALSP also helped form a "New York State Wallace for President" conference, held on April 3, 1948.  ALP leaders Isacson and Marcantonio both spoke there.&lt;ref name=Withering /&gt;

During the Progressive Party's convention in July 1948 in Philadelphia, the following committees had the following ALP members:
* Arrangements: [[Elinor S. Gimbel|Elinor Liebmann Gimbel]] (wife of Louis [[Gimbels|Gimbel]], Jr.)
* Credentials:  [[Leo Isacson]], Charles Collins, Jose Lopez

==Prominent supporters==
Henry Wallace's bid for the presidency attracted the support of many prominent people in academia and the arts. Among those who publicly supported Wallace were [[Larry Adler]], [[George Antheil]], [[Marc Blitzstein]], [[Kermit Bloomgarden]], [[Morris Carnovsky]], [[Lee J. Cobb]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Howard da Silva]], [[W. E. B. DuBois]], [[Howard Fast]], [[Uta Hagen]], [[Dashiell Hammett]], [[Lillian Hellman]], [[Judy Holliday]], [[Libby Holman]], [[John Huston]], [[Burl Ives]], [[Sam Jaffe]], [[Garson Kanin]], [[Howard E. Koch]], [[John Howard Lawson]], [[Canada Lee]], [[Norman Mailer]], [[Albert Maltz]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Lewis Milestone]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[Clifford Odets]], [[Linus Pauling]], [[S. J. Perelman]], [[Anne Revere]], [[Budd Schulberg]], [[Adrian Scott]], [[Artie Shaw]], [[Philip Van Doren Stern]], [[I. F. Stone]], [[Louis Untermeyer]], [[Mark Van Doren]],  and [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].&lt;ref name="We Are For Wallace"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson and Ruth Krauss|first1=Crockett|title="We Are For Wallace" (Crockett Johnson and Ruth Krauss Biography, Appendix B|url=http://www.philnel.com/2011/07/30/cjrk_b/|website=Nine Kinds of Pie|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lawson, Maltz and Scott were members of the [[Hollywood 10]], members of the movie industry who were called before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) for suspected membership in the Communist Party. Many of Wallace's public supporters were similarly hauled before HUAC and were blacklisted if they did not cooperate.

==Election results==
Running as peace candidates in the nascent Cold War era, the Wallace-Taylor ticket garnered no electoral votes and only 2.4 percent of the popular vote, far less than most pundits had anticipated; some historians have suggested that the Progressive campaign did Truman more good than harm, as their strident criticism of his foreign policy helped to undercut Republican claims that the administration's policies were insufficiently anti-Communist.  Nearly half of these votes were obtained in [[New York State]] (tipping the state and its 47 electoral votes from Truman to Dewey), where Wallace ran on the [[American Labor Party]] ballot line.

On September 11, 1948, for instance, the national committee of the Progressive Party passed a resolution which observed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The totally unjustified decisions of the Illinois Electoral Board to rule the Progressive Party off the ballot is a clear violation of the most basic democratic concepts.

The decisions rob millions of the free citizens of Illinois of their right to vote for the Party and candidate of their choice.  They force the war policies of the old parties down the throats of freedom and peace-loving Americans.

Free Americans cannot—and will not—tolerate stolen elections.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This reflects a growing move by states to limit ballot access by any candidate other than the Republican or Democratic party candidates.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

== The party at state level ==
In [[Massachusetts]], the anti-war Progressive Party was active in 1948 and faced discrimination in this state also.  On May 31, 1948, for instance, the Democratic Mayor of Boston, [[James Michael Curley|James Curley]], denied the use of the bandstand on the [[Boston Common (park)|Boston Common]] to the Progressive Party of Massachusetts. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The following month, however, on June 29, one of the African-American leaders of the Progressive Party, Paul Robeson, was allowed to speak in the Crystal Ballroom in Boston's Hotel Bradford.

In [[Virginia]], in 1948, [[Virginia Foster Durr]] ran for the U.S. Senate seat on the Progressive ticket.

== Pop culture connection ==
One of the [[Kingston Trio]]'s most popular folk songs in the 1950s, "The MTA Song", was written by supporters of the Progressive Party of Massachusetts' 1949 [[Boston]] mayoralty candidate, [[Walter A. O'Brien]].  After Boston's publicly funded MTA purchased the privately owned Boston Elevated Railway's subway and trolley system for $30 per share more than each share was worth, the MTA imposed a fare increase on the citizens of Boston. Progressive Party mayoral candidate O'Brien then led unusually large protests against the MTA fare increase before the 1949 mayoral election. But although his campaign's anti-fare increase song was subsequently turned into a national hit record in the 1950s, O'Brien failed to win the local Boston election in 1949. When the Kingston Trio decided to record "The MTA Song", it was apparently agreed to change the first name of the O'Brien referred to in the song from "Walter" to "George", because it was feared that a hit record which referred to "Walter O'Brien" would make it even more difficult than it already was for the former Progressive Party candidate to find a New England employer who was willing to hire him during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy Era]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

== Disbandment ==
After the 1948 election, Henry Wallace grew increasingly estranged from the Progressive Party. His speeches started to include mild criticism of Soviet foreign policy, which was anathema to many leftists in the party. The final break came in 1950, when the Progressive Party's executive committee issued a policy statement against US military involvement in Korea, and soundly rejected Wallace's proposed language criticizing the invasion by communist North Korea. Wallace came out in support of the US intervention in the Korean War, and quit the Progressive Party three weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Culver and John Hyde, ''American Dreamer: a Life of Henry A&gt; Wallace'' (New York: Norton, 2000) 505-507.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952]], the Progressive Party ran lawyer [[Vincent Hallinan]] for president. Their vice presidential candidate was [[Charlotta Bass]], the first [[African-American]] woman ever to run for national office. The campaign attracted little media attention and few votes, and was not even on the ballot in many states. Erstwhile Progressive candidate Henry A. Wallace supported Dwight D. Eisenhower, published an article in the September 7, 1952, issue of ''[[This Week (magazine)|This Week]]'' magazine (a Sunday supplement that was included in 37 American newspapers) entitled "Where I Was Wrong," detailing some of his mistakes in not having opposed Stalin strenuously enough. The Progressive Party disbanded in 1955, as the Cold War dominated the political spectrum, and any party which had not taken an anti-Communist position was deemed to be unviable.

The 1948 Progressive Party is but tenuously connected to the original Progressive Party (1912-1932) (although Henry A. Wallace's father had been a fervent [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Bull Mooser]], and Wallace himself had only officially left the Republican party in 1936); members of the 1948 Progressive Party, however, have joined the later state Progressive Parties, thus linking the 1948 group to the [[Vermont Progressive Party]], the [[Progressive Dane|Wisconsin Prodanes]], and the [[Progressive Party of Washington]].

'''''Smith and Grady v UK''''' (1999) 29 EHRR 493 was a notable decision of the  [[European Court of Human Rights]] that unanimously found that the investigation into and subsequent discharge of personnel from the [[Royal Navy]]  on the basis they were homosexual was a breach of their right to a private life under Article 8 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. The decision, which caused widespread controversy at the time&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Delight and despair at gay ban ruling | publisher = BBC | date = 27 September 1999 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/458842.stm | accessdate = 28 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  led the UK to adopt a revised sexual-orientation-free Armed Forces Code of Social Conduct  in January 2000.&lt;ref name="Armed Forces Code of Social Conduct"&gt;[http://www.proud2serve.net/military/codeofconduct.htm Armed Forces Code of Social Conduct], retrieved 28 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  In UK law the decision is notable because the applicants' case had previously been dismissed in both the High Court and Court of Appeal, who had found that the authorities' actions had not violated the principles of legality including [[Wednesbury unreasonableness]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Facts==
Smith had been a member of the Royal Air Force since 1989. In June 1994 a woman telephoned the air force alleging that Smith was a lesbian and had been sexually harassing the caller. Smith was questioned by the service police and admitted that she was gay and that she had a same-sex relationship while in the RAF. The service police asked her intimate questions on the details of her sexual life, asking for the names of previous partners, her HIV status and other details. A few months later Smith was given an administrative discharge from the Royal Air Force.{{sfn | Mowbray | 2007 | p=489}}
Grady had been a member of the Armed forces since 1980 but was discharged following disclosures of a nanny working for the [[British Defence Liaison Service]].{{sfn | Mowbray | 2007 | p=489}}
The applicants sought to challenge their discharges first through a domestic judicial review, and when this was unsuccessful they launched an application to the European Court of Human Rights.{{fact|date=February 2014}}

==Judgment==
The British government conceded that there had been an interference with the applicants' right to a private life under [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|article 8]] of the European Convention. The issue for the court was therefore whether such an interference could be justified. In order for an interference under article 8 to be justified it is necessary that it is in accordance with the law, in the pursuit of a legitimate aim, and must be considered necessary in a democratic society. The government policy had been given both statutory recognition and recognition by the lower courts and the court considered that the policy could be said to be in the pursuit of the legitimate aim interests of national security" and "the prevention of disorder". However, the court was not satisfied that the policy could be considered "necessary in a democratic society".
The court was not satisfied that the government had provided credible justification for its treatment of homosexual personnel. Observing that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

&lt;blockquote&gt;
”these attitudes, even if sincerely felt by those who expressed them, ranged from stereotypical expressions of hostility to those of homosexual orientation, to vague expressions of unease about the presence of homosexual colleagues. To the extent that they represent a predisposed bias on the part of a heterosexual majority against a homosexual minority, these negative attitudes cannot, of themselves, be considered by the Court to amount to sufficient justification for the interferences with the applicants’ rights outlined above any more than similar negative attitudes towards those of a different race, origin or colour.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The court considered that the government had not offered convincing and weighty reasons for the investigation of the applicants sexual orientation or their subsequent discharge and therefore considered that there had been a breach of their right to a private life under Article 8 of the European Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

Mowbray has suggested that the court may have been influenced in its decision by the doubts expressed by some of the [[Obiter dicta]] of the domestic proceedings which expressed doubts about the durability of the armed forces policy towards homosexuals.{{ sfn | Mowbray | 2007| p=495 }}

==Significance==
The decision was initially controversial,&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;  with gay rights advocates arguing that it represented a breakthrough but some politicians and commentators expressing concerns that the decision would disrupt army morale. Today, such fears are widely regarded as having been proven unfounded. The Ministry of Defence has concluded that the policy had "been hailed as a solid achievement"  and that "there has been no perceived effect on morale, unit cohesion or operational effectiveness".

The decision has come to be widely accepted both within the military and outside it with Wing Commander Phil Sagar of the armed forces' joint equality and diversity training centre issuing a formal apology on behalf of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] in 2007 to those affected by the MOD's former policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

{{Police Investigative Stops}}

A '''Terry stop''' in the United States allows the police to briefly detain a person based on [[reasonable suspicion]] of involvement in criminal activity. Reasonable suspicion is a lower standard than [[probable cause]] which is needed for [[arrest]]. When police stop and search a pedestrian, this is commonly known as a '''stop and frisk.''' When police stop an automobile, this is known as a '''[[traffic stop]]'''. If the police stop a motor vehicle on minor infringements in order to investigate other suspected criminal activity, this is known as a '''pretextual stop'''. Additional rules apply to stops that occur on a bus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Motions to Suppress in Removal Proceedings |url=https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/sites/default/files/practice_advisory/motions_to_suppress_in_removal_proceedings_fighting_back_against_unlawful_conduct_by_customs_and_border_protection.pdf |website=American Immigration Council |accessdate=13 November 2018 |date=1 August 2017}}, page 8 (Bus and Train Sweeps)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a difference between one police officer stopping one individual, which is a tactical definition, and systematic promotion of this tactic on either the departmental or municipal level, which can damage police–community trust and lead to charges of [[racial profiling]].

Although the Supreme Court has published many cases that define the intersection between policing and the Fourth Amendment in America, the U.S. Congress has not defined a baseline for police behavior. There has been some state action at both the legislative and judicial levels, and also some cities have passed laws on these issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Barry Friedman, Tracey Meares, and Charles H.

The concept of a Terry stops originated in the 1968 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case ''[[Terry v. Ohio]]'', in which a police officer detained three [[Cleveland]] men on the street behaving suspiciously, as if they were preparing for [[armed robbery]]. The police conducted a pat down search and discovered a revolver, and subsequently, two of the men were convicted of [[carrying a concealed weapon]].&lt;ref name=Oyez-2018&gt;{{cite web |title=''Terry v. Ohio'' |url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1967/67 |website=Oyez |accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The men appealed their case to the Supreme Court, arguing that the revolver was found during an illegal search under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]. This brief detention and search were deemed admissible by the court, judging that the office had reasonable suspicion which could be articlulated (not just a hunch) that the person detained may be armed and dangerous. It is key to note that not just "mere" suspicion was used, but "reasonable" suspicion which could be articulated at a later date.&lt;ref name=samaha&gt;{{cite book | last1=Samaha | first1=Joel | title=Criminal Procedure | date=2011 | isbn=1133171176 | edition=8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=edw8AAAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This decision was made during a period of great social unrest in America in the [[1960s]], with rising crime, antiwar protests and race riots. It was thought that law enforcement needed to be provided with tools to deal with the unrest and new issues of urban crime. Some criticized the decision for watering down the [[prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures]], others praised it for balancing safety and individual rights.{{r|samaha|p=94}}

==Expansion of Terry stop through case law==

===Reasonable suspicion===

To have reasonable suspicion that would justify a stop, police must have "specific and articulable facts" that indicate the person to be  stopped is or is about to be engaged in criminal activity. Reasonable suspicion depends on the "[[totality of the circumstances]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Susskind|first1=R.S.|title=Race, Reasonable Articulable Suspicion, and Seizure |journal=American Criminal Law Review |date=1993 |volume=31 |page=327 |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/amcrimlr31&amp;div=20&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasonable suspicion is a vague term and the Supreme Court concluded it should be decided on a case-by-case basis. Often it is built out of a combination of facts, each of which would, in itself, not be enough justification for the stop.

{{Police-civilian encounters}}

The suspicion must be individualized. Suspecting people because they fit into a broad category, such as being in a particular location, being of a particular race or ethnicity, or fitting a profile, are insufficient for reasonable suspicion. However, stop-and-frisk has been validated on the basis of furtive movements; inappropriate attire; carrying suspicious objects such as a television or a pillowcase; vague, nonspecific answers to routine questions; refusal to identify oneself; and appearing to be out of place.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author1=Kären M. Hess | author2=Christine Hess Orthmann | title=Criminal Investigation | edition=9th | year=2010 | page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cases following ''Terry'' expanded the power of the police. While the original case was concerned with armed violence and firsthand observation by officers, ''Adams v. Williams'' (1972) extended the doctrine to [[drug possession]] backed up by the secondhand hearsay of an informant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harris |first1=David A. |title=Frisking Every Suspect: The Withering of Terry |journal=UC Davis Law Review |date=1994 |volume=28 |issue=1 |url=https://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/28/1/Articles/DavisVol28No1_Harris.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''United States v. Hensley'' (1985) ruled that police officers may stop and question suspects when they believe they recognize them from "wanted" flyers issued by another police department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weiss |first1=Rachel S. |title=Defining the Contours of United States v. Hensley: Limiting the Use of Terry Stops for Completed Misdemeanors |journal=Cornell Law Review |date=2009 |volume=94 |issue=5 |url=https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3146&amp;context=clr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Illinois v. Wardlow]]'' (2000), a person's unprovoked flight from Chicago police officers in "an area known for heavy narcotics trafficking" constituted reasonable suspicion to stop him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bernache |first1=Damien |title=The "High-Crime Area" Question: Requiring Verifiable and Quantifiable Evidence for Fourth Amendment Reasonable Suspicion Analysis |journal=American University Law Review |url=https://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1036&amp;context=aulr |date=2008 |volume=57 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually during a Terry stop, the police ask those they detain to identify themselves. Several states require people to provide their names to the police. In ''[[Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada]]'' (2004), these [[stop and identify statutes]] were deemed constitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nederhood |first1=Robert |title=All or Nothing: The Supreme Court Answers the Question What's in a Name |journal=Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology |url=https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7196&amp;context=jclc |date=2005 |volume=95 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Search===

A [[frisking|frisk]], also known as a patdown, of the surface of a suspect's garments is permitted during a Terry stop, but must be limited to what is necessary to discover weapons, and must be based on a reasonable suspicion the individual may be armed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Argiriou|first1=Steven|title=Terry Frisk Update|url=https://www.fletc.gov/sites/default/files/imported_files/training/programs/legal-division/downloads-articles-and-faqs/research-by-subject/4th-amendment/terryfriskupdate.pdf|website=Federal Law Enforcement Training Center|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, pursuant to the plain feel doctrine, police may seize [[contraband]] discovered in the course of a frisk, but only if the contraband's identity is immediately apparent.,&lt;ref name="el"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Larson |first1=Aaron |title=What Are Your Fourth Amendment Rights |url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/fires/fourth_amendment.html |website=ExpertLaw |accessdate=5 September 2017 |date=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=samaha/&gt; 

The Supreme Court has placed very liberal requirements on what is "immediately apparent" in regards to contraband. For example, in conducting a pat-down search, an officer feels a hard pack of cigarettes, the officer removes the pack and examines the inside, discovering drugs.

Subsequent court cases have expanded the definition of what constitutes a frisk, and what is considered as admissible evidence. In ''[[Michigan v. Long]]'', Terry stops were extended to searching the inside of a car passenger compartment if police have reasonable suspicion an occupant may have access to a weapon there. In ''[[Minnesota v. Dickerson]]'', the court ruled that "immediately recognized" contraband discovered during a Terry stop is also a lawful seizure.&lt;ref name=Gandy-2016&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gandy |first1=Imani |title=Boom!

==== Consensual search ====

Just as important to understanding Fourth Amendment rights surrounding terry stops are cases which fall outside of Fourth Amendment protection. Based on the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Schneckloth v. Bustamonte]]'' (1972), a person waives Fourth Amendment protections when giving voluntary [[consent search|consent to a search]]. The police are not required to inform a person of their right to decline the search. [[Thurgood Marshall|Justice Marshall]], in his dissent in the case, stated the obvious by saying it is a "''curious result'' that one can choose to relinquish a constitutional right — the right to be free from unreasonable searches — without knowing that he has the alternative of refusing to accede to a police request".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loewy |first=Arnold H. |date=2010 |title=Knowing 'Consent' Means 'Knowing Consent' - The Underappreciated Wisdom of Justice Marshall’s Schneckloth v. Bustamonte Dissent |url=https://olemiss.edu/depts/ncjrl/pdf/2009%20Loewy.pdf |journal=Mississippi Law Journal |volume=79 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burke |first=Alafair S.  |date=2016 |title=Consent Searches and Fourth Amendment Reasonableness |url=https://scholarship.law.ufl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1227&amp;context=flr |journal=Florida Law Review |volume=67 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, several cities and states require police to inform citizens of their right to deny a search (see [[Consent search]]).

== Traffic stops ==
[[File:New Jersey State Police Traffic Stop.jpg|thumb|New Jersey State Police temporarily detain a driver during a [[traffic stop]] on the [[New Jersey Turnpike]].]]
For practical purposes, a traffic stop is essentially the same as a ''Terry stop''; for the duration of a stop, driver and passengers are "seized" within the meaning of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that drivers and passengers may be ordered out of the vehicle without violating the Fourth Amendment's proscription of unreasonable searches and seizures. Drivers and passengers may be patted down for weapons upon reasonable suspicion they are armed and dangerous. If police reasonably suspect the driver or any of the occupants may be dangerous and that the vehicle may contain a weapon to which an occupant may gain access, police may perform a protective search of the passenger compartment. Otherwise, lacking a warrant or the driver's consent, police may not search the vehicle, but under the [[plain view doctrine|"plain view" doctrine]] may seize and use as evidence weapons or contraband that are visible from outside the vehicle.&lt;ref name=samaha/&gt;

As decided in ''[[Ohio v. Robinette]]'' (1996), once an officer returns the drivers identification, there is no requirement that the officer inform the driver they are free to go. Therefore, although the encounter has been turned into a consensual encounter, questioning can continue, including a request to search the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dery |first=George M. III |date=1998 |title="When Will This Traffic Stop End?": The United States Supreme Court's Dodge of Every Detained Motorist's Central Concern—Ohio v. Robinette |url=https://ir.law.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1411&amp;context=lr |journal=Florida State University Law Review |volume=25 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pretextual stops===
Pretextual stops are a subset of traffic stops deemed constitutional by the Supreme Court in ''[[Whren v. United States]]'' (1996). They occur when a police officer wishes to investigate a motorist on other suspicions, generally related to drug possession, and uses a minor traffic infringement as a ''pretext'' to stop the driver. In the case of ''Whren'', the defense used a "would have" rule; would a reasonable police officer have made the stop without the suspicion of other criminal behavior. On the surface, this is a sensible ruling, but there is much controversy about whether it leaves the door open to racial profiling. This is due to the fact that there are numerous petty violations a driver may violate and the officer can be selective about who to pull over to investigate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harris |first=David A. |date=1997 |title=Driving While Black and All Other Traffic Offenses: The Supreme Court and Pretextual Traffic Stops |url=https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6913&amp;context=jclc |journal=Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology |volume=87 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currenty the following 17 states ban pretextual stops: AZ, AR, CA, CO, CT, KS, MD, MS, MT, NE, NJ, NM, OK, RI, UT, and WV.&lt;ref name=naacp&gt;{{cite web |title=Born Suspect: Stop-and-Frisk Abuses &amp; the Continued Fight to End Racial Profiling in America |url=https://www.naacp.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Born_Suspect_Report_final_web.pdf |publisher=NAACP |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data on Terry stops==
The following states require stop-and-frisk data collection: AL, CA, CT, FL, IL, LA, MD, MA, MN, MO, MT, NC, NE, NV, RI, TX, WA, and WV. State that require this data to be published are: AL, CA, CT, FL, IL, KS, LA, MD, MA, MO, NE, NV, RI, TX, and WV.&lt;ref name=naacp/&gt; Using public records requests, the Stanford Open Policing project amassed 60 million state traffic stops in 20 states over the period 2011 through 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stanford Open Policing project |publisher=Stanford Computational Journalism Lab |url=https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1=Pierson |first1=Emma |title=A large-scale analysis of racial disparities in police stops across the United States |eprint=1706.05678 |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North Carolina was the first state in the country to require the release of all traffic stop data starting in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;cite web |title=North Carolina Traffic Stop Statistics: Frequently Asked Questions |url=https://www.ncdoj.gov/Crime/View-Traffic-Stop-Statistics/FAQ.aspx |publisher=North Carolina Attorney General}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have analysed 20 million traffic stops from this data finding that blacks as a share of the population were twice as likely to be pulled over than whites and four times as likely to be searched. Hispanics were not more likely to be pulled over, but had a higher likelihood of being searched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baumgartner |first1=Frank R. |last2=Epp |first2=Derek A. |last3=Shoub |first3=Kelsey |title=Suspect Citizens: What 20 Million Traffic Stops Tell Us About Policing and Race |date=2018 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=1108454046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a push to release more open police data nationwide. For example, the White House launched the Police Data Initiative which, as of 2018, has 130 participating police departments, some of which provide data sets on stop-and-frisk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Police Foundation Publishes Best Practices Guide for Police Open Data |url=https://www.policefoundation.org/national-police-foundation-publishes-best-practices-guide-for-police-open-data/ |publisher=Police Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, this is a very small percentage of the 17,000 police departments nationwide, only accounting for around 15% of the country's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jackman |first1=Tom |title=Only 53 police agencies participating in national push for use of force statistics |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2016/04/26/only-53-police-agencies-participating-in-national-push-for-use-of-force-statistics/?utm_term=.bbb61caf328e |publisher=Washington Post |date=April 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arms of the Duke of Norfolk.svg|thumb|170px|Arms of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk.]]
'''Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|KG}} (10 March 1536 – 2 June 1572) was an [[England|English]] nobleman and politician. Although hailing from a family with strong Catholic leanings, he was raised a Protestant. He was a second cousin  of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] through her maternal grandmother, and held many high offices during her reign.

Norfolk was the son of the poet [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey]]. He commissioned [[Thomas Tallis]], probably in 1567, to compose his renowned [[motet]] in forty voice-parts ''[[Spem in alium]]''.

==Early life, family, and religion==
Norfolk was taught as a child by [[John Foxe]], the Protestant [[martyrology|martyrologist]], who remained a lifelong recipient of Norfolk's patronage.  His father predeceased his grandfather, so Norfolk inherited the [[Duke of Norfolk|Dukedom of Norfolk]] upon the death of his grandfather, [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk]] in 1554.

He was a second cousin  of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] through her maternal grandmother, [[Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire|Lady Elizabeth Howard]], and he was trusted with public office despite his family's history and leanings towards [[Catholicism]] (although he was brought up a Protestant).  He commissioned [[Thomas Tallis]], probably in 1567, to compose his renowned [[motet]] in forty voice-parts ''[[Spem in alium]]''.

==Career==
Norfolk was Earl Marshal of England and Queen's Lieutenant in the North. From February to July 1560, Norfolk was commander of the English army in Scotland in support of the [[Lords of the Congregation]] opposing [[Mary of Guise]]. He negotiated the [[Treaty of Berwick (1560)]] by which the Congregation invited English assistance.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar of State Papers Scotland'', vol. 1 (1898), 323, 440.&lt;/ref&gt;

Norfolk was the Principal of the commission at York in 1568 to hear evidence against [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] presented by [[Regent Moray]], including the [[casket letters]].&lt;ref&gt;HMC: ''Manuscripts of the Earl of Salisbury at Hatfield'', vol.1 (1883), p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal troubles and execution==
[[Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth]] imprisoned Norfolk in 1569 for scheming to marry [[Mary, Queen of Scots]].

Following his release, he participated in the [[Ridolfi plot]] with King [[Philip II of Spain]] to put Mary on the English throne and restore [[Catholicism]] in England. After a 1571 trial, he was executed for treason in 1572.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Jardine (barrister)|Jardine, David]].  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ScBCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA121 Criminal Trials, Supplying Copious Illustrations of the Important Periods of English History During the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and James I.: To which is Added a Narrative of the Gunpowder Plot, with Historical Prefaces and Notes]'', Volume 1, pp. 121-245 (Nattali and Bond, 1847).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Matthew Bacon|Bacon, Matthew]] et al.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=m2kyAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA399 A New Abridgment of the Law with Large Additions and Corrections]'', Volume 9, p. 399 (T. Davis, 1846).&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried at the [[Church of St Peter ad Vincula]] within the walls of the [[Tower of London]].

Norfolk's lands and titles were forfeit, although much of the estate was later restored to his sons. The title of [[Duke of Norfolk]] was restored, four generations later, to [[Thomas Howard, 5th Duke of Norfolk|Thomas Howard]].

==Marriages and issue==
===First wife===
[[File:Hans Eworth called Mary Fitzalan Duchess of Norfolk.jpg|thumb|170px|Mary FitzAlan]]
[[File:MargaretAudley.jpg|thumb|170px|Margaret Audley]]
[[File:Elizabeth leyburne.jpg|thumb|170px|Portrait of Elizabeth Leyburne attributed to [[Hans Eworth]], c.1560]]
Thomas Howard's first wife was [[Mary FitzAlan]], who after the death of her brother Henry in 1556 became heiress to the [[Arundel]] estates of her father [[Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel]].  She died after a year of marriage, having given birth to a son:

* [[Philip Howard, 20th Earl of Arundel|Philip Howard]] (28 June 1557 – 19 October 1595), who  became the 20th Earl of Arundel.

It is from this marriage that modern Dukes of Norfolk derive their surname of 'FitzAlan-Howard' and their seat in Arundel. Though her funeral effigy is found at [[St Michael the Archangel, Framlingham|Framlingham church]], Mary FitzAlan was not buried there but first at the church of [[St. Clement Danes]], [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]] and then, under the direction of her grandson's will, at Arundel.

===Second wife===
Norfolk next married another heiress, [[Margaret Audley, Duchess of Norfolk|Margaret Audley]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp88204/margaret-howard-ne-dudley-duchess-of-norfolk "Margaret Howard", National Portrait Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; widow of Sir [[Henry Dudley (1531–1557)|Henry Dudley]] and daughter of [[Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden]]. Margaret's children by her marriage to Norfolk were:
* [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk]];
* [[Lord William Howard]], ancestor of the [[Earls of Carlisle]];
* Lady Elizabeth Howard;
* [[Lady Margaret Sackville (1562–1591)|Lady Margaret Howard]], Countess of Dorset&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geni.com/people/Margaret-Howard/6000000000151561135&lt;/ref&gt;

Margaret Audley Howard's tomb effigies is found at [[St Michael the Archangel, Framlingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/peter.fairweather/docs/framlingham.htm |title=Churchmouse: Framlingham, Suffolk.

===Third wife===
After Margaret's death in 1563, Norfolk married [[Elizabeth Leyburne]] (1536 &amp;ndash; 4 September 1567), widow of [[Thomas Dacre, 4th Baron Dacre]] of [[Gillesland]] and daughter of Sir [[James Leyburn]]e.

Norfolk's three sons by his first two wives, Philip, Thomas, and William, married, respectively, [[Anne Howard, Countess of Arundel|Anne]], Margaret, and Elizabeth Dacre. The Dacre sisters were the daughters of Elizabeth Leyburne by her marriage to Thomas Dacre and were, thereby, stepsisters to Norfolk's sons.

===Attempted fourth marriage===
Following the death of his third wife, Norfolk made an effort in 1569 to marry [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. The marriage, of course, never happened, and Norfolk was imprisoned by [[Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth]] and executed for this.

==Depictions==
*Thomas Howard appears as a character in the [[Philippa Gregory]] novels ''The Virgin's Lover'' and ''The Other Queen'', and in the novel ''I, Elizabeth'' by [[Rosalind Miles]].
*A highly fictionalized version of the 4th Duke of Norfolk appears as a villain, played by [[Christopher Eccleston]], in the 1998 film ''[[Elizabeth (film)|Elizabeth]]''. 
*Another version of the Duke is in the BBC mini-series ''[[The Virgin Queen (TV serial)|The Virgin Queen]]'', played by [[Kevin McKidd]].
*In the [[Channel 4]] [[documentary]] ''Elizabeth'' (2000) presented by [[David Starkey]], the Duke is portrayed by actor John Gully.

The '''Uniform Firearms Act''' ('''UFA''') is a set of statutes in the [[Pennsylvania|Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] that defines the limits of Section 21 of the [[Pennsylvania Constitution]], the right to bear arms, which predates the United States Constitution and reads: "The right of the citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State shall not be questioned."  The laws range in scope from use of force in [[self-defense]] situations, to specific categories citizens that are ineligible to purchase or possess firearms.

UFA for Pennsylvania is generally a more liberal interpretation of the [[Right to keep and bear arms in the United States|Right to Bear Arms]], in that it does not prohibit the sale and transfer of [[Class III NFA firearm]]s, contains no duty for a citizen lawfully carrying a weapon to notify law enforcement, and mandates [[Concealed carry in the United States#Shall-Issue|shall-issue]] licenses to carry firearms to eligible citizens.

==Object of the laws==

The object of concealed weapons statutes is to protect the public by preventing an individual from having at hand, a weapon of which the public is unaware.&lt;ref&gt;''Com.  v.  Butler'', 150 A.2d 172 (Pa.  Super.  1959).&lt;/ref&gt;    The Pennsylvania Uniform Firearms Act (Pa.  UFA)  follows the practice of the majority of states in prohibiting and criminalizing the carrying of concealed weapons.&lt;ref&gt;79 Am.  Jur.  2d, ''Weapons and Firearms'', Sec. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the title of the law is a bit of a misnomer as the Pa. UFA does not follow the ''Model Penal Code''.&lt;ref&gt;Comment, 1972, Sec.  6102.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Pa. UFA,&lt;ref&gt;18 Pa. C.S.A. Sec.  6106, et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;  prohibits the carrying of certain firearms in vehicles or concealed on the person without a license; prohibits ownership or possession of firearms by certain persons; provides for the licensing for concealed carry; provided strictures for dealers in firearms and; provides penalties for violations of the law.  The regulation of firearms in the Commonwealth is preempted by the Legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Sec.  6120&lt;/ref&gt;   That means that local municipalities, including  the large municipalities, cannot regulate firearms as this is the sole province of the State Legislature.&lt;ref&gt;18 Pa.  C.S.A. Sec.  67120(a).&lt;/ref&gt;  By way of illustration, a Philadelphia ordinance requiring a city license to transfer a firearm was held to be ''ultra-vires'' and struck down.&lt;ref&gt;''Schneck v.  Phila.'',  383 A.2d 227 (Pa.  Comwlth 1978).&lt;/ref&gt;  Notwithstanding Sec.  6108 makes it a violation of State law to carry a firearm,&lt;ref&gt;(defined by Sec 6102 and including a handgun, pistol or revolver)&lt;/ref&gt; rifle or shotgun, at any time on the public street or public property of any city of the first class (currently only Philadelphia), without first obtaining a license to carry a firearm.

The Pa.  UFA at Sec.  6106 (a), provides that no person shall carry a firearm in any vehicle or concealed on or about his person, except in his place of abode or fixed place of business, without a license to do so.  Carrying a gun in the trunk of an automobile has been held to be a violation of the law,&lt;ref&gt;''Com.  v.  Carrington'', 324 A.2d 531 (Pa.  Super.  1974)&lt;/ref&gt;  but the Commonwealth has to establish that the person had both the power of control over the weapon and the intention to exercise that control.&lt;ref&gt;''Com.  v.  Gladden'', 311 A.2d 711 (Pa Super.  1973).&lt;/ref&gt;  The burden of proof of the fact that a person carried a firearm outside of his place of abode or fixed place of business  without a license rests with the Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;''Com.  v.  Loez'',  565 A.2d 437 (Pa. 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  Where the Commonwealth cannot prove that a person carried a concealed weapon, it may nonetheless prove that the firearm was carried without a license as that offense does not require intent.&lt;ref&gt;''Com.  v.  Pauze'', 70 D&amp;C 2d 368 (CCP 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

	Concealment as an offense is factually specific and for a jury to decide.&lt;ref&gt;''Com v.  Scott'' 436 A.2d 607 (Pa.  1981); 43 ALR 2d 492.&lt;/ref&gt;  Where there is no evidence of an attempt to conceal a weapon, there cannot be a conviction.&lt;ref&gt;''Com.  v.  Williams'' 346 A.2d 308 (Pa.  Super.  1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

	The Pa. UFA&lt;ref&gt;18 Pa. C.S.A. Sec.  6115&lt;/ref&gt; prohibits the making of a loan secured by a firearm and from lending or giving a firearm to another in contravention of the law with the purpose to prevent persons with disabled (a term indicating the loss of a civil right) from possessing firearms from obtaining them by loan, gift or other transfer.  However, a 2005 amendment,&lt;ref&gt;18 Pa. C.S.A. Sec.  6115 (b)(4)&lt;/ref&gt; provides that nothing in this section prohibits the relinquishing of a firearm for safekeeping.&lt;ref&gt;23 PA. C.S.A. Sec.  6108.3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Licensing Procedures and Guidelines==

'''UFA''' establishes mandatory, statewide procedures for issuing a license to carry firearms. No municipality may establish their own rules regarding firearms, and changes to any firearms-related regulations must go through the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]]. The act outlines the express right to a license in §6109:

*: "A license to carry a firearm shall be for the purpose of carrying a firearm concealed on or about one's person or in a vehicle and shall be issued if, after an investigation not to exceed 45 days, it appears that the applicant is an individual concerning whom no good cause exists to deny the license."

Section 6111(i) of the act provides that "[a]ll information provided by the potential purchaser, transferee or applicant, including, but not limited to, the potential purchaser, transferee or applicant's name or identity, furnished by a potential purchaser or transferee under this section or any applicant for a license to carry a firearm as provided by section 6109 shall be confidential and not subject to public disclosure." A violation of this section gives rise to a private right of action against the violator for damages of "$1,000 per occurrence or three times the actual damages incurred as a result of the violation, whichever is greater, as well as reasonable attorney fees."

On December 31, 2012, a class action lawsuit captioned ''Doe, et al. v. City of Philadelphia, et al.'', was filed in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas&lt;ref&gt;Case No. 121203785 (filed under seal).&lt;/ref&gt; against the City of Philadelphia and several of its departments for placing on its website the confidential information of more than 1,500 individuals who appealed from the denial or revocation of their gun permit, in alleged violation of Section 6111(i). In 2014, the lawsuit was settled for $1.425 million, with the City paying the cost of administering the settlement. In addition, the City agreed to make expansive changes to its firearm-related and gun permit-related policies and procedures.

==Comity and Reciprocity==

Once a permit to carry a firearm is issued in Pennsylvania in accordance with the requirement and strictures of the law, pursuant to Sec.  6109 (k) (2) and any agreements brokers between the Attorney General of the Commonwealth and the appropriate legislatively authorizes official in a sister State, that license will be recognized in those subscribing States.  This is called "reciprocity" and it is enjoyed (at this time) with the States listed below.  Under Pennsylvania law, there are six categories of firearms reciprocity status.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' website of the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Written reciprocity agreements with Pennsylvania===
Category 1: States that have entered into written reciprocity agreements with Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;18 Pa.C.S.A. § 6109(k)&lt;/ref&gt; These agreements provide for reciprocal recognition of valid permits issued by both states.  Recognition in Pennsylvania varies based on the written agreement.&lt;ref&gt;As of 12/27/2015&lt;/ref&gt;

*Georgia
*Kentucky
*Michigan
*Mississippi
*Missouri
|
*New Hampshire
*North Carolina
*Oklahoma
*South Dakota
*Tennessee
*Texas
*Utah
*Virginia&lt;ref&gt;
written reciprocity agreement effective until July 1, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; {{Update after|2016|06|30|reason=Virginia will allow all license holders to carry after July 1.}}
*West Virginia
*Wyoming
|}

===Statutory reciprocity based on the determination of the Attorney General that the other state has granted reciprocity to Pennsylvania===
Category 2: States that have statutory reciprocity under 6106(b)(15) of the Uniform Firearms Act.&lt;ref&gt;18 Pa. C.S.A. 6106(b)(15)&lt;/ref&gt;  The following states have been granted statutory reciprocity without a formal written agreement,&lt;ref&gt;18 Pa.C.S.A. 6106(b)(15)&lt;/ref&gt; based on the determination of the Attorney General that the other state has granted reciprocity to Pennsylvania license holders, and that the other state's laws governing firearms are similar:&lt;ref&gt;as of 12/27/2015&lt;/ref&gt;

{|
|
*Colorado
*Iowa
*Indiana
*Kansas
*Louisiana
|
*Montana
*North Dakota&lt;ref&gt;Effective August 1, 2013 only North Dakota Class I permits are recognized in Category 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ohio
*Wisconsin
|}

===Unilateral reciprocity granted by another state for Pennsylvania===
Category 3: Unilateral reciprocity granted by another state for Pennsylvania license holders. 
This category encompasses states which allow an individual issued a valid License To Carry Firearms from Pennsylvania to carry a firearm while in those respective states:&lt;ref&gt;as of 12/27/2015&lt;/ref&gt;

{|
|
*Alabama
*Idaho
|}

===Application states===
Category 4: Pennsylvanians may apply for a permit from another state ("Application states"):
{|
|
*Connecticut
*Hawaii
*Maine
*Maryland
|
*Massachusetts
*Minnesota
*Washington (State)
|}

===Carry Permitted Without License===
Category 5: Pennsylvanians may carry without a license, included here for reference:

*Alaska
*Maine
*Vermont
*Arkansas

==Cities of the First Class exception==

The act does not address the carrying of firearms in the open (also known as "open carry"). Thus it is legal to do so without a permit.  However, the act states that any person may not carry a firearm in a city of the first class (Philadelphia is the only one in the Commonwealth) without a permit or falling under an exception.  While carrying a firearm in the open in Philadelphia is legal for license holders, it is not a commonly used carrying technique.  Philadelphia law enforcement officers are likely to detain an individual who is openly carrying a firearm.

==Criminal violations==

Should a citizen break one or more of the enumerated statutes in the UFA, they are subject to penalties outlined in the act. Police and court officers commonly refer to the charges collectively as VUFA; or, Violation of the Uniform Firearms Act.  Penalties depend on the severity of the infraction.

Some jurisdictions within the [[Pennsylvania Unified Court System]] have set up specialized court sessions to deal with violations of the Uniform Firearms Act. For example, the [[First Judicial District of Pennsylvania]] has allocated "Gun Court" sessions for defendants accused of violating certain parts of UFA. Upon conviction, the defendants can be sentenced to serve [[Probation]] under the supervision of special Gun Court [[Probation officer|Probation Officers]].
